WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
You want the soul, go here and sleep

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
And any word word is counting the dream

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
But the end is near

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
And all we see is our ages and its breaks

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
We don't have time to waste

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
We don't have time to waste

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
We don't have time to waste

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
We don't have time to waste

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
It's all over for us

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon, and I'll see if that's a little, there we go, oh boy

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Good rainy Lethbridge, I'm in the parking lot of McDonald's, court just ended

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
We'll have a full update on what happened with the Coutes Trio for you tomorrow morning

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So tune in 6 a.m. Eastern

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You get a full Coutes Trio update

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Lots of notes, lots of notes

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And then we won't be able to give you much of an update from the Coutes duo who's left

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Chris Carver, Tony Olenek

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
But we are expected back in court on April 16th, 10 a.m.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
So it's adjourned until then

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
But the Coutes Trio trial is going to continue

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Paige, let's go ahead and have our good afternoon and say hello to everybody and then we'll get on with the show

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Rainhill, freezing rain in Nova Scotia as well

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Not great weather

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Hi from Roxanne, hello again from Gail

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And yes, Quilter

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
We've got Vanessa, is that great to see you yesterday?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Right there, two cars away from me

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So hello Vanessa

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I know you're watching from there

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
She was just in court, we all ran to our cars to get to the Levine show

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Hi Lori as well, good afternoon to you too

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And your fellow chatters

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And Wanda from Peterborough, Ontario

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Thank you all for joining us

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Really appreciate it

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And yes, it's going to be a really good show

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Looking forward to the information that our three guests will be providing to us

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
On that note, I'll step out and let me know who you want to bring on

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Well first, I'm going to say my hello's here

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And welcome everybody

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
So yeah, we have an excellent episode today

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We got Dr. Jay Kui back

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Dr. Jay Kui back

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
And we also have Chet Chisholm

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't know how to say her name now

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
And we also have Kyra

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Ooh, I'm drawing a blank on her last in Kirsten

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I think it's a Kirsta, something like that

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Sorry Kira, we love you

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
You know I do

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
But we're going to have a good episode

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So I do want to warn everybody here on YouTube

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I just wanted to give you the welcome

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And hello, so now's the time to pick another platform

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Whether it's Facebook, Rumble or X

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Rumble's going to be your best bet

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
You never censor us there

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
But we're going to be able to conversation about Bax

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
So at a certain point, I think maybe soon

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
If you're on YouTube, please jump over to another platform

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
That lets us speak the truth

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Because before we bring anybody on, Pads

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
It's going to hit that button that removes YouTube from this

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So again, last warning

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
If you're on YouTube, please move over

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
It's going to be a very important conversation about

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
All the vaccines, not just a particular one

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
But all the vaccines

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
But on YouTube, you're going to buy us

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So Pads, go ahead and end YouTube

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And then go ahead and bring all our guests on

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And we'll get started

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
But I'm excited about this one because

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
The biologist Dr. J is back

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And we're going to get into

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
What are we talking about here?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
How do vaccines cause problems?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I'll wait for the confirmation that we are off YouTube

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Before we get into any more of this

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
So again, if you're on YouTube

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You'll find us on LinkedIn as well

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And Twitch is a good place to watch us

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Or you can go to levinshow.com itself

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
And you'll find us right there on homepage

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
All of this is free

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So feel free to go ahead and move to that

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Pads, are we done with YouTube?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And we can go ahead and bring on Dr. Cooey

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Chat and Krista

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Krista

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh my gosh, why am I trying to blank on your name right now

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
There we go

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Kira

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Kira

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
There we go. Is it right Kira Kristin?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
It's Kira Kristin

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
But I know who you mean I never correct people

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's fine

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm not an artist

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
The last name I got it

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's the first time I was messing up

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Kyra

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Nice to see you all

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And thank you again Dr. J Cooey for joining us

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And chat you too

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I guess you can say hi to Ant Evelyn if you would like

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Hi

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So I'm glad that you're back to the show

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You come on frequently

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
When we have important conversations

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So thank you very much for being here

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Kyra, thank you very much for taking some time away from work

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I see you're in the car as well

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So the two cars on the top and then

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Two people who got to be at home today are on the bottom

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then Dr. Cooey, thank you very much for coming back

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You were well loved, well received

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And people said bring it back right away

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
So here we are, we brought you back

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, I'm happy to be here

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm at your service

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
At my service, well thank you very much

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So today what we wanted to kind of talk about

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Was going to have an update from you the last time we saw you

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
How are things been going with you

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And then we'll get into introducing you to Kyra

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And chat

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Everything is going okay

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm just trying to stream as often as possible

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I have a real problem with meeting a schedule

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Like you just showed me how to do

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And I think

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I probably should take a little

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
This is a learning experience

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And realize how much I have to gain

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
By being on at the same time every day

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But I'm trying to teach

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
When I can

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And it's usually every day

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And you know, it's just day by day

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You know as well as I do

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't know, we've got to keep doing this

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And I don't plan to stop

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
My family is supporting me

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And I'm very lucky to have

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
The support of my kids and my wife

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
But I don't think this should be about me

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So I want to meet these two people

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And I've heard of chat

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
For quite some time now

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And I actually saw something on NCI

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And so just please

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Let me meet your guests

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And use me as you will

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Well, thank you very much, Dr. Cooey

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So Kyra, let's start with you

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Because you were the first

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Max injured on this panel here

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You were actually injured prior to

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
COVID

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
So let's go ahead and introduce yourself

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
To everybody to Dr. Cooey and

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Your story

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Sure, hi there, nice to meet you

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Dr. J.J.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I really enjoyed your

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Your visit on the show with Jason

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Last time and

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Said to chat, I need to get on

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
With this man, so it's super

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Super nice to meet you

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I was injured by teed-up shots

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So a tetanus shot in my 20s

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
And I've had a lifetime of issues

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
As a result

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So I know that vaccine injury is real

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And not rare

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Even with childhood vaccines

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So I only had eight of them

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
And the eighth one almost killed me

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So that's kind of just the introduction

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Of my story

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, what was the temporal relationship

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Like a day or hours or week

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Or when did it start?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
So it started with

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Anaphylactic reaction right away

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I was rushed to hospital

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Where I was intubated

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And given a whole bunch of stuff

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't quite remember what happened

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And then after that

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It was a cytokine storm

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And then autoimmune disease

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
That I've been still dealing with

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm coming up on my seventh surgery

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Next month

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, wow

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That is absolutely heartbreaking

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Wow

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Did you have the support of family

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And friends or did you have to

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Have the system of the alien

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Over many years

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
No, because it happened right away

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I had a good family doctor

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
He recognized it

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It was in my chart as a vaccine

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Adverse reaction

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
He didn't file it

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
We don't have bears here in Canada

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And it's a very long process

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
To file an injury

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But it was on my chart

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Unfortunately, he passed away

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So every time I go to the hospital

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I get the eye rolls

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
But usually I can make them listen

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Because I have an extensive knowledge

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Of what happened to Jesus

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I know more about my medical condition

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Than most doctors

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I guess that's the only way out

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Really

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
You have to be an expert

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
You do

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You have to be an expert in an advocate

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
So you have to take on the dual role

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And then a survivor

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So really three

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Check your is more recent

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Let's go ahead and do the same thing

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Let's introduce you to Dr. JJ

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I like that name

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And let him know what happened to you

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
JU and I have crossed past a few times

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Over the last year

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
We've spoken on later spaces

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
With the NCI together

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
But I've been

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
A paramedic for 12 years

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
13 years

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Going on 13 years now

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I was off work

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Did a workplace injury

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
When COVID kicked off

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And tried to follow

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Things as best I could

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And there's a whole story behind that

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Didn't get everything right

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
But you try

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And in an attempt to

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Get back to work

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Because there was such a

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Feeling a tremendous sense of

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Duty to return to work

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
In EMS or fire

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
When you watch the healthcare system

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Crumbling around you and

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Your colleagues are

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
At their wit's end

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I had to get

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Vaccinated

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
As it was being mandated

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And I developed

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Paracarditis as a result

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Was

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Basically told

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I was crazy, told to shut up by

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Doctors and stuff

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And go in with my EKGs

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But Paracarditis

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Everything's there

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
My blood work is

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Exactly what you would expect

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Paracarditis

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
My own family doctor

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Told me to just shut the fuck up

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That I was crazy

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Had friends

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Alien ate me and stuff

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Because I was talking nuts

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The most sick I've ever been

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
In my entire life

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Recovered quite a bit in the last

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Geez, how long has it been now?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It's coming up on three years

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I helped

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Set up and organize

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
The national citizens

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Inquiry on the east coast

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Here in Canada

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I testified on the first day

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Along with people such as

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Dr. Patrick Phillips

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And Dr. Peter McCullough

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You know, I worked alongside

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Like Kara and Jeff, who I'm sure

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You both know

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And they're great, wonderful people

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
But that's kind of been

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
That's the Coles Note version

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Of what we're going through

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And as

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I was injured by the first shot

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I wasn't allowed to return

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
To work because Paracarditis

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And myocarditis were scrubbed

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
From the medical exemption list

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And I kept off work

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Long enough that I was actually

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Terminated and haven't been able to

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Wasn't allowed to return to work

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
They've since dropped the

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Vaccine mandates, but like

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Like only like a couple weeks ago

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
To be honest with you

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
But I

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Wasn't necessarily fired for

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Refusing, I was off work

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
To do it a workplace injury

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
This prolonged that time frame

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And time ran out

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
No, I don't want to take this twice

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Because it injured me

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And injured other people I know

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Some of my colleagues

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And friends

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And so anyways, I helped

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
With the NCI

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And I've been on with Jason here

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
You know, and the reason why

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Sometimes the show has a

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
About language, filter warning

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And we can't really go into

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
YouTube when you're around either

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No, no

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
But yeah, and like

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I've been around

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Talking to everybody

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But yeah, that's the

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Coles Notes version of it

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I assume that's the Canadian version

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Of Cliff Notes

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, Coles Notes and Cliff Notes

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, Coles is a book store

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Okay, I got here

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
How did you approach this?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Did you think of it as

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Your body producing spike protein

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Or anything like that?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Myocarditis

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
The way that a cardiologist would have

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Treated it before the pandemic

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Initially, it was

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Well, I kind of figured out what it was

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Pretty quick, like

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I wasn't feeling good like the day

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I got the shot, and like I was

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You know, like I wasn't against it

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
At first, and then I was like

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
This doesn't sound great, and then

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It's like, they put your back against

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
The wall, and it's like what are you

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
What are you going to do?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm going to lose everything

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
So I treated it with an immense

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Amount of rest when full dead stop

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Like stopped exercising

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Stopped doing everything

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Like my folks that were awesome

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
They actually like

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
During the winter, like they would

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
They'd like to hire some of the guys who

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Worked with the government like clear snow for me

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Because I couldn't do it

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Took any inflamatories

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Pretty consistently

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Did intermittent fasting, which I found

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Helped quite a bit

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And I've been trying a few other things

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Like black seed oil and

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Other stuff, but like the big thing was

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The number one thing was just

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You need to go full stop, you can't

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You can't push your body hard

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Like I should have been put on

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Like Coltracyne, which is a

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Really strong anti-inflammatory

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
They used to use it for gout, but

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I was any time I tried to get

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Help with this, I was either

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
The either shrugged at me

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Or told me to pound sand

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So I

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Managed it the best I could

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Without access to everything

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I should have had

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It's a lot better than it was

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It still flares up from time to time

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Like when we're probably like

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
80% there maybe

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Compared to where I was

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Like I got a

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Lost some of my like conditioning and stuff

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
When you have to stop exercising

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
For a couple of years

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It has an effect on you, right?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's that catch 22

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
So

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
No, I mean that's a

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's a spectacular lesson that I'm

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Trying to pass on to my little boys now

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
I mean once you lose it

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
It's very hard to get it back

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And as an adult

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
It's it can be crippling

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Especially if it comes with additional

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Weight and all this other stuff

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So then you're not carrying more weight

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
And you're also out of shape

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, that sounds

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
That sounds unfortunate man

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I really hate to hear the idea that

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You would make this choice

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And then actually it didn't even get you

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Across the finish line that you

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Originally intended to get over

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't want to put salt in the wounds

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But it just sounds like it's a terrible story

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It's been wild and like

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
The East Coast of Canada was

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Some of the most draconian

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Nonsense you've ever seen

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Like you weren't allowed to

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Like leave your county at times

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like I've been running my sister's house

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I got

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Because I said no right around the

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Trucker convoy

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And because like I had left here

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
You could put under quarantine for two weeks

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Which is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Basically house arrest

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Because you weren't allowed to leave

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Your home

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Or it was a $12,000 fine

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
If you stabbed Dr. Property

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
And you were tracked and followed by the RCMP

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
And the government checked in on you every day

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I wasn't allowed in the hospital

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
To get my own damn blood work

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
At one point

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Like my best friend died of cancer

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
During all this

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
And I wasn't allowed to visit him in the hospital

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It was crazy

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And actually it's surprising me

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It's really sounding as though

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
There might be

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
At least from the

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
From the sheer amount of pain that they caused

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
It might have been much worse in Canada

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Than it was in America

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I mean

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh I think so

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And I got not

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That's not something for us to brag about

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
It's a mark of shame on this country, right?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It's

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Maybe it's a bigger opportunity though

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You know, more people got burnt

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Which means you have more opportunity to organize

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I think right now America is so

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Split between people who dodged a bullet

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
For whatever reason they took the shot

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
And nothing happened to them

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And you know, God bless them

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
That doesn't mean that everybody didn't have a problem

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
And so

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It's frustrating

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But Americans are that simple at this stage

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
You know, they think I took off shots

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Nothing happened to me

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
And the unfortunate thing is

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Is that a lot of Americans are so

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Baseline unhealthy

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That if they couldn't get up the stairs

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
After the shot

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
They probably couldn't get up the stairs before the shot

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
They can't

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
They don't notice

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I mean, you know, it

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That's why I think also talking to

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Any professional athletes that are willing to speak

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Or anybody that, you know, it was in decent shape

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I mean, it doesn't surprise me at all that

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
You know, as we go forward

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
We need to have more and more people

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Understand that it's okay to admit that

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
For a very long time they've been trying to tell themselves

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
They're not injured, but they're injured

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
I mean, I think that's where we have to be

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
And I think a lot of this isn't going to show up

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
For some people that are like, it's like, I'll just use

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Like myocarditis is an example

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
If someone lives a relatively sedentary life

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Or they're not like athletic and stuff

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Like it's not necessarily going to

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
The injury is not necessarily going to show up right away

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Like that kind of thing like

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's going to show up for someone who put strain on their

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
On their system like if you have like an athlete

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Sorry, my cat is very loud

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But the way I've described it to some people

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It's like, like imagine like you step out of like

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You get out of the truck and you roll your ankle

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
And you need to go over there

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
And it doesn't hurt right away

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Like, but you know you rolled it

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And you can walk on it, you can walk in the house fine

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But it's the moment you go to walk upstairs

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And you actually have to put like a lot of weight on your ankle

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Then you feel it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Like some of these cardiac injuries are like that

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Like you're not going to notice them until your heart gets pushed

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And that's why you see like athletes in that

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
In such collapse and stuff

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
It's like it's once they've been pushed to that point

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And their heart rate goes up and their blood pressure goes up

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And then it just can't handle

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
It's the worst

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
The injury becomes apparent

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
In my case, mine was

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I noticed it right soon after

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
It took like I felt crappy and then like

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
It was maybe like two or three weeks later

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
That I ended up in the hospital

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Like it built up to that point

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Like it was me trying to help my dad do some yard work

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
And then that pushed me over the edge

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But like, yeah, there's a lot of people that

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
Don't know they've potentially been harmed

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Because it's blending in with something else

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Or they may be attributing it to something else

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Like it's hard to say

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You can never really

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I think it's almost impossible

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
To know the extent of the injury to some people

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I know personally

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I know tons of people

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Like by name

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I won't say their names here

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
For obvious reasons, it's their private medical thing

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
But like, I know

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Dozens and dozens and dozens of people

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Like I know guys I work with

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Like nurses, friends

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
A bunch of guys in the Canadian Armed Forces

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And I just had a colleague of mine who works in New Brunswick

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
He's one of my very good friends

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
He texted me

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
It was sometime last week

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
But like, they had two kids

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Under the age of 12 both have strokes

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Almost 12 and one was five

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And like, one he knows

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Like, it wasn't his patient

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Like, he's paranoid too, but like, he's like

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
He was there and he saw the kid in like the emerge

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
It's like the kid with full-blown

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Like, stroke symptoms

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
And like, that's unheard of

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Like, kids can have a stroke

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But like, it's usually

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
It'd be due to something underlying cause

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Like, some form of like head injury

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Or

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Something else that was

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Like, maybe like a pre-existing condition

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
But it's not like calm

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
And like, if you saw a kid who had stroke symptoms

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It's usually like

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Downstream of a head injury of some sort

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
But like, when you see two

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Like, last week

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And he said there was more

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
But like, those are the ones that he saw

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
It's...

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Kyra, are you a activist from the very beginning?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Like, did you just immediately

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
The moment the whistle went up, you were like

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
No, thanks

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
And spread it all around?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Oh yeah, no, I've been

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I've been an anti-vaxxer for

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Since it happened to me, pretty much

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Like, for 25 years

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
So like you say how there's more people around

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
In weird way, I'm kind of thankful for

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
COVID because now there's more of us

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Because I was alone for a very long time

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But yes, I was screaming

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
From the rooftops for everybody

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Not to get this vaccine

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I saw it coming a mile away

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
A lot of my friends

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Predicted that this would happen

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Since SB277 and

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Senator Richard Dick Pan

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
In California

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Mandating vaccines for

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Children over the Disneyland measles outbreak

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I saw this coming a mile off

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
So it's unfortunate that not everybody could hear me

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
But yeah, there's a lot more hesitant people

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
In the world now

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, it's...

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I just... I hope we can sustain this

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
As a tipping point and not

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Let people fall back into the

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Fall back asleep, so to speak

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And I'm also worried, I mean, what do you guys have

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I can't... I can't see through the thing

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm 52 years old

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So I'm gonna roll the dice and say

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I'm older than both of you

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
What are the college kids in Canada?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Are they full on...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
On board with Trudeau

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And everything is great

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Or did they get...

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
They get screwed over and we can wake them up

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Because that's what we need to do in America

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
We let all those college kids

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Go to university and just said

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Okay, well, do what they tell you

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And I think that was a huge opportunity

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
We missed, we should have just kept them home

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
For a year

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
And those universities would have been putting

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
In a very different position, I think

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's hard to say

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I'm older than I look

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I'll tell you that much

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm 38

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
But I know a lot

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
In my social circle

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
In my age bracket

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
They want nothing to do with Justin Trudeau

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
They despise him

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Like I would consider

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Like if you put me on like a

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Political compass

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Thing like I'm

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I guess just left of center

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And pretty close to the bottom

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Like a classical

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Liberal libertarian-ish type person

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
But like

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
What is classified as

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Liberal in

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Canada right now

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Is so far out to see

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Like beyond communism

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Like

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
But like it's

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I don't think we're that far behind

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
We just have this old guy

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
We put like weekend invertees

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
We put in front of that

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But everybody else behind him is fully

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
They're all about it

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I mean, yeah

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And I do know people

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
That are like

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Trudeau is the B's needs

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
But like they're

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Like

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Living like Ottawa

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Or Toronto and stuff

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But like you go to like

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
The rural areas like where I'm from

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And like every day

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
There's a guy that just lives down the road

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
From me, you watch his jeep drive-in

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
It's got the big

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
F**k Trudeau flag up flying off the back of it

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And stuffs like I like you man

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
How do you guys feel about elections in Canada?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Is it fair?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And elections up there

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Because, you know, down here in America

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
It's either yeah, it's perfect

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Or mail-in ballots are used to cheat

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
And every state

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
And depends on what you talk

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
That's kind of starting to happen

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
We had a good system here

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
That

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
I think you could run a

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Decent election with

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And I used to trust them

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
But like there's so much Chinese interference

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Right now

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It's

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
By don't trust any of it right now

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Like when the time comes I'm going to go

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
It volunteers a scrutiny

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
So I can at least, you know, have

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Some

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
At least have, like I said, eyes

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
On what's happening in my area

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And like

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
But what we have here is we have a

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I can explain some of this stuff better than I can

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
But like we have elections Canada

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Which basically set up the rules for the election

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And dictate to the governments like this

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
These are the rules of what you have to follow

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
And

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
So you're not allowed to step outside of that

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And like each

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
They need to have representatives from each party

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
As scrutinyers and stuff there

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
We need to have photo ID and your photo card and stuff

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So like there's a lot of

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Systems in place

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, it's based off the British system

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
But

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
What's been happening and

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Jason may know more of this

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
But like they're the Chinese have just

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
Come in and they're just butchering it and using like

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Like international students to like

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Sling votes around and stuff

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
It's crazy

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It's yeah

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I'll hand it off somebody else and that's more than I can

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah, I would kind of concur with chat to there that we have some problems

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Not so much on the dominion voting machine level like you do in the United States

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
But it's more like the elections are purchased around here

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
So the marijuana passing was an attempt to make sure that people wanted to vote for Trudeau

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
So basically he kind of entices the votes more than anything else

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
Right now he's given a break on the carbon tax to the east coast

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Because they were upset with him

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
And I think that's a way to kind of butter up to them in order to get some more votes

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
But we certainly have a lot of immigration

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
In Canada in nine months we added a million people

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Which is a huge amount of people in nine months

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
And all of those become liberal voters

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
So there's a lot of that going on as well

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
And then there's some jury mandarin that goes around here

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
So particular writings that need some work

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You see a lot of efforts happening there

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
When Trudeau took power

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
He only needed 16 writings to take power

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
So there's a large focus there

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
But I would say more or less

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
It's being purchased by using our money to give programs

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And to give money to particular groups

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And I'm pretty sure UBI is going to be a big thing for a lot of people

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
So if there's some sort of announcement or some sort of promise that UBI is going to come

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
That may influence some votes

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
But I don't think we're going to have much of a problem in the next election

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
The Liberal Party has almost no support now

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
NDP has almost no support now

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
So it's going to likely be a very strong conservative win

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
But here JJ our problem isn't so much the elections

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
It's the Uniparty

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It doesn't really matter who you vote in

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
They're both basically the same

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
They're just taking turns

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
So really really if you look at it that way

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
We don't have elections

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
We have selections because it's really only the two uniparties

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Now I'm running as an independent candidate

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Because I want to break that mold

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So I'm not in a party

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Kind of like RFK juniors doing

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So I'm an independent candidate for the MP

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Of yellowhead

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And I think that's really where we need to start focusing

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Is getting a few of us in there

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Because if we don't we're just going to have two wings of the same bird

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
The Uniparty the entire time

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
So it doesn't matter really who's elected

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Wow I didn't even press

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Dude I didn't know you were doing that

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That's pretty exciting

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Yeah I know that's really why I have my show

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And it's why I'm working so hard on meeting so many Canadians

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Learning so much

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Because this is what I call my member parliament bootcamp

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I'm working really hard

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
To do that twice a day every day

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
To learn as much as I can

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
And then demonstrate this to Canadians

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Because I believe that's what an MP should be doing

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And they should be doing their best to learn all the issues

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And talk to all the Canadians

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
So that when they do go to the house

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
They can be a representative instead of somebody

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
To bring it forward their own beliefs

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I actually want to represent my neighbours

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And this is what I'm demonstrating with this show

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Wow nice

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I like that

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I didn't mean to send it over there

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But I just really

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I wrote down a note here about free and fair elections

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
And then that's why I asked the question

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
That's really great Wow

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah I know there's a problem with the last one

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That because like CSIS

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Which is like our equivalent of like the CIA

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
The Canadians

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Well FBI and CIA together

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah it's all intelligent

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
They've been

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Some of them have been raising the alarm

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Of like Chinese interference on our elections

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And like one of the things that just came out recently

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Was

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
There was 250,000 ballots that weren't even counted

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
In the last election

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
And they don't have an explanation

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
As to why they weren't counted

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Like it's

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
My buddy Jeff Eavley

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Does a show he just finished his

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
When he was talking about it yesterday

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And just it's the end of the moment

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Any of this like comes up for like

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Indivestigation

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
The NDP just shut everything down

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It's like no we're not doing this

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
We're not going to look

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It's like well

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Nothing to see here

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
When are your elections

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Like are you also organizing

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
This

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I don't know, aware, coven movement

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
What is the organization in Canada

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Now I thought NCI was kind of a

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Hub of organization

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Did Cairo

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
That NCI, for example

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Or

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Well, if you don't mind, I want to wrap up

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
This election kind of thing

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
There's another thing that we have unique here in Canada

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Is we can have minority governments

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So government actually wins the power

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But they have a minority vote

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So what they normally do is they'll team up with another party

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
So what we've had is the liberal party

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Got a minority government

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
But they've teamed up with the NDP government

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Or the NDP party

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And together they're able to make a majority

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Of what happens

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
There's a lot of deals going on

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
They're using

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Our money

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
To satisfy this other party

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
To basically buy their votes

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Buy their allegiance

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And then create a

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Consortium that actually takes power

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Something you don't see in the United States

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Because it's usually a majority of that

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
When you don't get minority governments

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
But in Canada we do

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
We do have minority governments

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
We only have

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Correct

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, we really have four

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Parties, major parties

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
So they'll be liberal, conservative, NDP, block

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And then there's a smaller one

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The green party

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And then independence, we don't get in there

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But yeah, we have four

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Large parties, block is Quebec

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Basically, Quebec is all block

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And then the rest of us

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah, so that's how we're run

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Which is unfortunate

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Did not win the popular vote

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And did not win a majority

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
But won the most out of the parties

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
That's a minority government

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
People don't directly vote for

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Justin Trudeau to be prime minister

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
They vote for their party

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Because he's the leader, he gets to sit in the chair

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
You asked another

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
What was the other question you asked, Jay?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
No, I was asking if you guys

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
How are you

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Organizing right now?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
What's the next election?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Is there a

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Something that's taking the place of NCI

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Is NCI evolved?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Is it still a place where we should be

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
That's a lot of questions

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I'll start with the NCI

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I think I can answer that one

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And I think Kyra's

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Connection pros are crashed

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But so the NCI

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Is just a

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Citizen run kind of like

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It's an inquiry

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
My friend Alex Cabana

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I like the way he always put it

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
He described it as

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Us building the library of Alexandria

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So we can collect

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
All this data

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
We can put it together

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And so you have

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
We completed the first volume

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Which was the one that you and I

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Were a part of

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And that volume gets up on the shelf

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And it's in the library

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
So we can always pull from it

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Right now as they're working on

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Around two

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
That's supposed to start

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
In the summer

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
To carry on

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Because there's been a lot of stuff

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
That's come out

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Since in the last year

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
In particular with

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Some things with some corruption

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
And stuff with the government

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Connected to vaccine approval

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And all these

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Crazy things

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Like it's

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
The stuff that's coming out is wild

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
There's a list that's too long for me

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
To talk about on here

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
We can be at it all day

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
But the next plan

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Is to dive back into that

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
And bring more

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Forward so you can have volume two

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And so these things are

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Going to be

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Documents that carry forward

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
So it's in the

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So the public can pull from it

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
And what we've talked here a number of weeks ago

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
In Nova Scotia

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Is because

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
A bunch of doctors

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
And nurses and representatives

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Have got together and have filed lawsuit

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Against the Nova Scotia government

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And the Nova Scotia

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Just give help

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And there's been

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Discussion of suing the individuals

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Who are

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Heads of these things

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And there's a lot of

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Things going on

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
We can talk about that another time

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
But the NCI

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Has all this stuff for us

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
For people to pull from

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And it's this nice collection of things

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
So

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I know Sean Buckley

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
He was one of the lawyers as part of the NCI

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Some of the others

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Who are higher up in it

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
They've discussed expanding the NCI

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Later to

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Move into other things

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That we can hold public inquiries

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Into so that the public can become

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
More aware

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Like election interference is

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I think one that was discussed

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
But like they're

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
They're going to focus on

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
COVID and what's happening right now

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Because that's kind of the pressing

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I guess

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
But they do plan to expand into

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Other things so that we build like this

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Encyclopedio library type thing

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
That people can pull from

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And it's

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It's a

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Like an internal document

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
It's not going to disappear into the

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Into the ether

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And it's better than

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
It's a more professional type of thing

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
That you can show people

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
To say like this is what's happened

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
As opposed to

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Like a whole bunch of random

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Like youtube links and clicks off

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And stuff like

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Here's a public inquiry

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Describing things that have happened

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And like it's

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It's gained traction around the world

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Like they've talked about it in

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Australia and the UK and stuff

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And in the United States as well

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
So

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Sorry, yeah

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I was just going to say

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
But there's a couple of challenges with the NCI

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Completely citizen led

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And the

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Governmental support on it at all

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Has no subpoena power

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
So none of the government witnesses

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That were invited showed up

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Which ended up giving us basically a

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Plaintiff only encounter

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
We had no other side to it to even question

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
So it's going to be

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Heavily biased to one side that showed up

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
The report that was generated

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
There's no binding on the government

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
To take any action

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
In fact they've completely ignored it

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But I've watched it in the Helen

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Groose matter where

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
This is a detective in Ottawa

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Who's currently fighting for her job

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
As a police officer because she was investigating

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Possible lengths between breastfeeding babies

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And their sudden death

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
From a vaccinated mother

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
So just looking into that caused her

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
To be fighting for her career

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
But the NCI came up, a couple of the experts

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
From the NCI came up

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And you can see that the government

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Not only dismisses it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
They consider it to be

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
A non-valid report

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
So this is how they're

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Billifying the actual report

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
That was created by the Canadians

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
In hearings and in court

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
So it's even worse than just ignoring it

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
They're actually vilifying it

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
So anybody who is associated with it

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
They consider it to be part of that group

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
So the power from the NCI

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I think is a fantastic start

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
But it's got no teeth

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Because the government is actively

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Resisting that

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Because of course the information was good

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
But it didn't help them

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
In America though, we haven't had

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
There's been no momentum

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
In the sense of

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
The same 10 people

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Are the ones that are complaining

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
No new doctors are saying

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Wow, I made a mistake

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
No movement on that part

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Are there whistleblowers in Canada

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Or people who are like

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I shouldn't have done this yet

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Maybe a couple

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Sorry, sorry

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Cara, same story with you

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
The same first ones

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I got lost or licensed

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
So Shoemaker and

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Trozy

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
And we also got

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Hodgkinson and Mackus

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Like the same group really

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
There are some

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
So I'm not going to say there's none

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
But not the second wave that I was expecting

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Like when people really started to understand the injury

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah, I know

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And I think the challenge there

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Is because there's still some ongoing

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Hearings and stuff around

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
What's happened to those first people

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Luckily they're so fighting it

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
So I guess there's some sort of reservation

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And they're not sure what's going to happen

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
If they stand up too

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I'm pretty sure if Detective Helen Groose

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Is found not guilty or not liable

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Which won't happen

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
It's very much stacked against her

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Than you would

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
They're still worried about their career

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Their families, their paychecks

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And their peers

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
So we don't seem to have a second wave

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Oops, sorry, my bad

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Let's try and correct this

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
They will

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Like if you speak out about it in your

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Health care, like they will destroy you

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So one of the emergency room doctors

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Here where I'm from

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Like in my hometown

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
That's a great position

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I can bring this

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I'll talk about it before

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
But it's

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
She refused

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And asked for medical exemption

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Because she was concerned about menstrual issues

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
That were being reported and so she said

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I don't want to take this

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
So they put her on, initially

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Put her on leave

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
And she could do some like

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Over the phone

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Consult type stuff, I think

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
It was for a little while

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
But eventually they

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
When the hammer dropped

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
And the vaccine mandate was

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like firm, like you gotta

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Do it or else

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
They fired her

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And have since

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
sued her for

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
$324,000 for breach of contract

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Because she was contracted

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
To work for

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
So many years

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Because she was only out of

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Med School for a few years

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And so she signed on to work

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Here in my hometown

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And yeah, the

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Nova Scotia Health is suing her for

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
$324,000 because she wouldn't

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Take the COVID vaccine because

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
She was worried about menstrual issues

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
And I can tell you

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I know people personally

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Who have experienced these

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Menstrual issues

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
And

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
It blows my mind

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And so when people say it's like

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Why isn't everybody

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Speaking out, it's like

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's because they'll

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
They'll ruin you

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And like

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And like

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And she's like

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Withdrawing her license and stuff

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And I know

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
And some of these guys are older

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
But like even just in my hometown

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Like we watched

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Like there's a lot of doctors who were just saying

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Like hey, I don't

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I'm not going to recommend anything

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Because doctors have quietly retired

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Back in January

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Like I think there was like six or seven of them

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Just in my town

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It's bonkers

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
We even, we have

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Dr. Byron Bridal

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Who is the

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I think he's the lead immunologist

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Professor at the University of Guelph

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Who is still locked out of his campus

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
To this day

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Yep

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
It's

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Actually, it's really

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Incredible. I don't, I don't, I have

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Kind of had a loss for words if I hear it

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I didn't think it was quite as bad

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
But I guess I kind of knew but

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Well

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Let me have one more challenge to this

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Because, sorry, my phone

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
It's a call came in and actually

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Screwed on my audio. Let me add one more challenge to this

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It's called judicial notice

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
So in our courts right now

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It still stands right now

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Where they take judicial notice

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And the judge doesn't even question it

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And they don't allow debate on it

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
So two things that they provide a judicial notice

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
On one, safe and effective

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You can't even argue that in the court

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
As far as the judge is concerned

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
That is a fact, it's not even debatable

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And the mandates were required

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
So that's the second judicial notice

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
So you can't even bring it to any court

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And say, hey, look, we don't think the mandates were fine

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
They won't even allow that argument

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
So those two judicial notices

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Have made it really impossible

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
To take this issue through the courts

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Anywhere in Canada

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Because as soon as you try, you're done

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
The judge won't even allow those debates to happen

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
You can't bring forward experts to have the conversation

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
So yeah, we're really stuck

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
Here in Canada when it comes to advancing that issue

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And I also think that plays a large role

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
And why don't we stand up

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Because why should they?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
If they stand up, even the court will say

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Get out of here. We know it's safe and effective

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And those mandates were required

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
So we've got some work here in Canada for sure

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Yeah, and the colleges and the unions

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Like the colleges are

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
They just follow along with that, too

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah, and the unions haven't helped anybody

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Like I filed a grievance

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Or tried to file a grievance

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
And my union over a year ago

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And I still haven't got around to it

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
And I'll have that article there

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
If you want, I'll just

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Pull it up and just show you real quick

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
If you want

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I am just

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
But yeah, it's crazy

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Like Dr. Patrick Phillips

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Who was just reporting vaccine injuries

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
He's like, yeah, this guy's got myocarditis

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And he would fill out the paperwork

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And they stood to him of his license for it

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
So here you are, Jay

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
So Department of Health sitting in an inch

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Doctor in connection with refusal to get

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
COVID-19 vaccination

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And it just gives a little bit of our history here

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But at the bottom it says Nova Scotia is seeking

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
$324,000

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
The balance of the return of service fee

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And a lump sum as well as the other costs

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
And we are in an absolute health care crisis

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
In this province right now

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Where people aren't

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Getting seen in emergency rooms

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Like they're waiting hours

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Their ambulances aren't showing up

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Like it's

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
And this is what they're still doing to people

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Like they fired

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Or put like

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Over a thousand people on leave here

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
And we're a small province

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Under a million people

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
But like it's

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
It's crazy

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
And it's

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And another example is Sarah Chijunen

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
She's a nurse

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
She's been fighting hard

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
And she's now lost her house

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
She's trying to pay off a $300,000

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Cost order against her

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Plus $250,000 of her own legal

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And she's not even done all the different legal

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Battles that she's in

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You absolutely have a lot of examples

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Being made of

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And people are paying attention

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And nobody wants to touch it with a 10-foot pull

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
They're basically quietly telling their patients

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Look, I understand that you're injured

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
But certainly not public

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Holy cow

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Yeah

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
And I just had Sarah on two days ago

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
So you can check out that episode

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But she's like 500,000 in the hole

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
She lost her house already

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And she's still fighting

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Yeah

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It's crazy, man

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I know nurses that still don't have their jobs back

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
And there's another example

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Elon Musk stepped up recently

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
To help another doctor

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
King Canada that's fighting

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Because they've posted some information on

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Twitter at the time

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And from that, they're behind

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Another $300,000 or so

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
That seems to be the magic number

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
$300,000 is what

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Elon's going to be helping that doctor with

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
But without even Elon's help there

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't want to answer anything

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
That's all we're getting to

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
We're getting help out of America

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Just to get through court matters

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
So we can get to the decisions

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Because it's all costly and it's

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
We don't have a very accessible legal system here

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
And of course, like Chet said, the unions

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
The colleges that regulate the licenses

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
They're all against everybody right now

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Right

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And when you go to the hospital, like I spent

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I was in hospital six times

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Over COVID

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Because the gut brain connection

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
For me is always an issue

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
And I caught COVID

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And it really affected me

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I had symptoms for about two

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I lost taste and smell for two years

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
It caused four strictures

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
In my intestines

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
So I was constantly going in with

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Lockages and basically they wouldn't do

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Anything about it until I ruptured

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Is what I was told

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, so and just the state of healthcare

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Like there's so many mistakes

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
There's so many people doing

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
You know, there's one person doing the job of three people

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Because that's just the state of it right now

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It was horrible before

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
But now I mean my last wait time in hospital

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
With a full blown blockage that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You know, potentially ruptured

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
So I'm like right after stroke patients in urgency

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I waited 12 hours

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Before I received

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
My gosh

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And then another one I'm going to add to your list

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
Or Jay is the Supreme Court of Canada

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
So they mandated vaccines are all vaccinated

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
All of our Supreme Court justices are vaccinated

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
And at one time you couldn't have a jury

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
That wasn't vaccinated

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
So when you were actually going to court

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
The jury itself would be fully vaccinated

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
It's not the case now

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
But for a period of time

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
That's how our justice system works

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
You would have vaccinated juries

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
And math

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
You couldn't even get away with them

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah, so you know

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
The type of people showing up to the jury could only be

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Government compliant jury members

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So obviously you're not going to be standing

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Or looking at 12 people saying the

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Backs is bad

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
They're all vaccinated

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
So

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
And you're not going to get into Canada

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Anytime sooner are you there, Jay Jay

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
Wow, man, how come this is not

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
This was not clear to me before this little

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Dude, you're only scratching the surface for you

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's wild

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
Just reporting Detective Helen Groose matter

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And mentioning the charge against her

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Had me removed from YouTube

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
They deleted my channel completely

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I had a channel that had a good following

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And just reporting

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Not making the statement

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Not taking that opinion

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Just reporting on what the matter is about

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
They deleted my channel

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I was done

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So getting information out of Canada is difficult

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
With all our censorship laws

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That are coming down the pipe, too

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
It's going to get worse

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Thanks, Chet, you reminded me

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Bill C11, C18, C63

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
That's on the table right now

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
All of these are designed to stop

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
All of these conversations from happening

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
And Jay, we're looking at having

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
A pre-crimes in Canada

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
So you can actually be found to be

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Danger to your community

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Before you've actually done anything

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
As long as somebody is fearful

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
That you might do something one day

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Hate-related

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
That's enough to put a peace bond on you

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
If this particular law-

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It's actually worse than that

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Because it actually states

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
If they believe that you may cause

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
A disruption to a service

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Or an essential service

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Through what you're saying

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Or potentially saying online

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
So protest

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Or maybe going on

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Like voting to go on strike

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Can be labeled as these things

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
And then you can, you know,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You put under house arrest

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Have an ankle monitor attached to you

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
So they can track you where you're going

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
They can control who you're allowed to speak to

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
For simply, they believe you might

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Cause a disruption

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
To a service

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Like a disruption to a service

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Would be as simple as

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Protesting

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
That's kind of the point

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Is to be a bit disruptive

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Or, you know, workers going on strike

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
That's intended to be disruptive

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
To use as a bargaining chip

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
So those things will be

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Technically become illegal

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Like in this country

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Let's give them the big one

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Which is life in prison

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
For inciting genocide

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And let me describe to you

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
How you can be charged with that

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Telling people

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
To not follow medical advice

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
By the government would be considered

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Genocide or inciting genocide

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Cause you're potentially killing people

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
So that would be life in prison here in Canada

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I don't know what to say

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
It's crazy

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
You can see why some of us are running as

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Independence because the parties

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Are going this down

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
All parties have gone behind it

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
An example would be

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Bill C4

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Which is

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Makes it illegal to counsel

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
For transitioning back to your birth

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Gender

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
So any conversation with your kid

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Whether they think they might be gay

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Or may be trans

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
If you have any conversation with them

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But maybe they're not

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That is illegal here in Canada now

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
So this is why we don't have counselors

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Or physicians who assist people

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
In any way to go back to their birth

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Gender

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
So if you transition and you decide to go back

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
That's not a service available here in Canada

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
In fact anybody that counsels you on that

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Is breaking a law

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
A lot of those kids

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Just like

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
It's usually

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Like gender dysphoria tends to be

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Downstream

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
From sexual abuse

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Form trauma

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And it's a form of

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Dissociative behavior

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
So

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
If I'm not that person

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
That didn't happen to me

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
And if I'm no longer that sex gender

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Or whatever you want to use

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
It can't happen to me again

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
And that tends to be

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
One of

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Like a legit case of

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Gender dysphoria

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
That can be the cause of it

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
You see now maybe

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Maybe there will be social contagion

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
But like

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
You're not helping those kids

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Who've experienced that

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
By not dealing with the root cause

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Like you should find out

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Like why the kid feels that way

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
And see if you can help them

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And like it's

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I feel

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I feel bad for these kids man

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Like what a

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
That's a way to live

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That way

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah, it's

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
That's a whole

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
That's a whole kettle fish

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It's a striking contradiction

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
If you want to take

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Seriously the

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Gender and medical concerns

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Of a young teenager

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
But not the medical concerns

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Of an adult who claims

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
They were injured by a untested

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Product

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Now I'll bring you to another challenge that we have

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Organizing and doing something about it

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
You know protesting

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Right now we're still in court with

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Tomorrow Leach and James

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Chris Barber

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
And they're being charged with being the organizers

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Or basically

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Organizing and leading the convoy in Ottawa

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
And for that they're looking at 15 years

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
They're still in trial

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Close well over a million dollars now

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
We've been spent there

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
We have four men who were charged in Alberta

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
For being part of a protest in Koots

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And they spent well over 700 days

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Before two of them got out

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The other two are still there

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I was in their pre-trial today

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
So I got to see the two men shackled

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And brought in

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And these were just really protesters

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Wrong place, wrong time

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
And then also today

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
There's another court matter

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
So there's two court matters

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
And I'm following here in Lethbridge

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
And this is for the Koots trio

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
And they've been here for 20 years now

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Since the protest

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
And they're just getting their trial going now

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Again millions of dollars

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
They're looking at 10 years for mischief

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
And yeah they're pushing really hard here in Alberta

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
To silence anybody who wants to become a leader

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And an organizer

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
And it doesn't just stop there

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
We have a group here called Take Back Alberta

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
And their entire effort is to

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Get people to rise up

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Get part of the parties

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Become members of the parties

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And their years become candidates themselves

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
And they're very successful at that

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
They're under attack by elections Alberta now

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
They're trying to disband that entire group

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Because they're effective

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
But you can see how the government in very

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Strategic ways are targeting

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Anybody who stood up, especially a leader

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And really make an example of them

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
So nobody becomes a leader

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
And that's actually working

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
We've seen a couple movements where people

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Want it together

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But they didn't really take off

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
And they're stepping up as a leader

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Nobody's identifying as an organizer

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
They're not taking that risk

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
So you can see how systematically the government

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Courts, our colleges

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Our unions

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
And then they're jailing some people

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Who were leaders

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Who became influencers

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
And it's really, really

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Taking any wind out of any sale

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Now the good news is

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I'm hoping that 2024 is when a lot of this stuff will wrap up

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And we'll get some decisions

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
On the court justice

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Who was a liberal appointed justice

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Named Justice Mosley

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Who came out and found

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
That the emergency act in vocation was illegal

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
And the protest was legal

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So we've got a decision

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
But it's being appealed of course by the government

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And I'm sure they're going to take it all the way to Supreme Court

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
And unfortunately JJ

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
If it does go to Supreme Court

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
The Chief Justice of our Supreme Court

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
To the head honcho there

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Has already come out publicly and said

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
He's facing a potential loss

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
In the Supreme Court if we get all the way there

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
On the decision that we won

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
So all over the board

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
It's very difficult for people to take that risk now

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
It seems like he would have to recuse himself

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
From the case having already spoken about it

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
You would think so

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
But again, they're all vaccinated

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And yes, that would have to be something he would decide to do

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
But the statements he made

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Were very clear. He's got an opinion

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And he's very adamant about that opinion

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So I don't know how that will work out if we get there

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah, I love the

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It was an occupation

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Like dude, we live here

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Like this is where we're from

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
There was also just protests

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
This April 1st because

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Our government all gave themselves another raise

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And hiked up our carbon taps

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So everybody got out

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And kind of protested

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And in Alberta and Saskatchewan

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm in Saskatchewan

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Kind of the Prairie Province is more above Montana

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The federal government

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Because we push back the hardest

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Our pre-mares like

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We push our pre-mares to

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I think Saskatchewan was the first to lift mandates

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So at these protests

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
They sent the federal government

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Police, the RCMP brown shirts

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That were all heavily armed

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Standing alongside

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Well across from the protesters along the highway

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Like brown shirts

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
That was the life that

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It was a couple of days ago, right?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Yeah, I was in Calgary

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But they're happening all over the

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
These two provinces specifically

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Because we do fight back a lot

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And let's not forget that, Kyra

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Your premier, which is a leader of your province

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Was threatened by the federal government

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Because he actually said

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
We're going to stop collecting carbon tax on

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Fuel for heating homes

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Because our prime minister gave a break to the

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
East Coast for the same thing

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
We moved the carbon tax to reduce the cost

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Because it's very expensive

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So Saskatchewan said

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Look, you're doing that for the East Coast

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
For a reason, it's very expensive

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's also very expensive here

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So we're just going to eliminate it

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And then there are threats from the federal government

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And articles in our newspaper

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
There's all state run newspapers

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Articles everywhere saying

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Hey, what happens when our premier

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Violates a law?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Can they be arrested?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So you're getting that kind of stuff as well

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The leaders of the provinces

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Are kind of being threatened

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And our leader here in Alberta, Danielle Smith

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
She's fighting hard

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But she's admitted already

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
That she's had her wings clipped

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And she's got some limited powers

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
There's more power above her

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Than she thought when she came in

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So we're having troubles with even our leaders

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
On a provincial level

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Being able to be strong and stand forward

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
They seem to be getting threatened

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yeah, our premier Scott Mo is also threatened

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
For giving parents rights

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Around the whole transgender issue

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So he came out and said, yeah, you teachers

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Can't keep this from the parents anymore

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
If you've changed the child's gender

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
In the school, you need to tell the parents

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And he's got extreme backlash

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
For that

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
From the federal level

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Yeah, he has to use

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Was it in Canada similar to the United States?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I got to say, it's my

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Absolute firm belief

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It was upon the declaration of the pandemic

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Or soon after and with George Floyd

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That all this stuff took off in a way

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That it was never

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
That no one was pushing this before the pandemic

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
No, in Canada, we were

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So, oh, yeah, for sure

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
A little bit

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Not like this, though

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I guess that's Jordan Peterson

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
A little bit, but yeah

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Correct, that's why I was going to go with that

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah, yeah, because we were having

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Compelled speech laws being put in place

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yeah, because we're Jordan Peterson

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Really started to stand up

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But again, he's losing his license

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He's lost his appeals

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
They went after him, too

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Silencing him

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
He had to really move to the states

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Viva Fry, a guy we were talking about earlier

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
He left to Florida

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Because of what was happening in his home province of Quebec

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It wasn't really bad there

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
When child, when the child choice

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Started to trump the parental choice in Quebec

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The state stepped in and gave the voice to the children

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So they can get the backs

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Do a transition, do all that kind of stuff

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
That's when you left

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So we're losing really strong Canadians

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
For good reason

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
They're moving out to the states

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
To get away from some of this

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Including rumble

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Rumble used to be a Toronto company

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But he's going to be extradited

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
He's going to be extradited

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
He's going to give it to me

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I don't know

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I don't know, but you can see

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
As Canadians, we're seeing

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And again, state-run media

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So they're really putting this message

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
In front of a lot of Canadians

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So he keeps everybody at bay

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
There's a lot of threatening dudes

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's kind of like Stockholm syndrome

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Like we should rename it to Canadian syndrome

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because it's really what's happening to the citizenry here

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
They're all hostages

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But they don't want to fight back

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And they're just kind of just towing the line now

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah, it's weird too

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Because they punished different provinces in different ways as well

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Like for us, I couldn't even get my titers tested

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I couldn't get tested for natural immunity in Saskatchewan

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I had to go to Alberta for it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
They wouldn't even allow

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Like the same blood work companies

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
A girl's Canada life lab

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Weren't allowed to test for natural immunity in Saskatchewan

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Like how ridiculous, how unscientific is that?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
What are your jobs trying to emulate?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Are they not trying to emulate natural immunity?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But now you're going to ignore that natural immunity is a thing

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That's so unscientific

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That shit crazy is what it is

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It is, it is

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Well, because we don't have the same type of republic that you have in the states

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
We are a democratic country that is federally run

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Not a state run like you are

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You guys, basically your states are where most of the power is

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
With some federal or the other way around

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
All the power is on the federal with very little on the state

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
In fact, the federal overreach is a lot

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Like we have in our charter, in our constitution

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We have section 81 and 82

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I think it is

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And anyways, that separates the powers

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
But the government, the federal government overreach is all the time

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And the provinces other than Quebec really don't fight back and stand up

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
At all

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
We got some issues

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Well, what we need, sorry Chad, I can't hear

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
What we need is a lot more independent representation though

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Because again, the unipart I think is where the biggest trouble is

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
We had a unanimous vote on that C4, which is a mutilation of children bill

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And it doesn't help them at all

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And we didn't have a lot push back on the mandate when they were happening

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
We didn't have support on the convoy when it was happening

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
There's a couple of people here and there, but certainly

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
We don't have an opposition like you do in the states

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yeah, I don't know how much of an opposition we have in the states

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Either to be honest, because the same people

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Well, imagine it worse than that though

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah, I see what you mean, I do

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Yeah

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But I think the

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
We still need to

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I don't know how to do it, but I still

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I was not aware of this, it really means that

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Until they control your internet

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Americans really need to be aware of this

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So they can speak out too, because

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
For some reason, I don't have the feeling that many Americans are aware of this

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
If I wasn't, I don't know how the average American could possibly be aware of it

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yeah, Australia and Canada seems to be the

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Petri dishes for the globalist agenda

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They're testing things out here, seeing how far they can take it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
In Canada, well according to the numbers and it could be all fake and it could be lie

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
But we had over 80% compliance when it came to the Vax and other things

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And even the convoy, it was 80% against the convoy

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So yeah, we certainly have a large, large majority here

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That's just docile and getting on day by day and doing whatever the government says

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's just incredible, I mean, it sounds really like you guys need rescuing

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That's been talked about a lot

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I will be very careful about talking that on this particular stream

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Oh, okay

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah, yeah, because

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, I've already been threatened with jail for a publication band breach

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Just by mentioning the number of applications that a court matter had

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
They were literally going to put me in jail over night to teach me less and that's what the Crown wanted

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So yeah, we're pretty strict up here, it's pretty difficult

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
There's a lot of, maybe not a lot

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But there's a few groups that are popping up that are

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I don't know if I, what word I want to use for them

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's the resistance, it's a natural resistance to a dictatorship

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
So there's a lot of us that don't believe there's a political solution

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So we're kind of gathering, finding your friends, tribe and train and taking that route

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Yeah, and what ended up happening is a good group of people came together

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
They're getting more healthier, they're taking care of themselves

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So the government labeled them a terrorist group

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And they actually used them as part of the invocation of the EA

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
They talk about them in our House of Commons

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That's if they really are a terrorist group and they're not

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But that's what happens in scams is what they are

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Good people, you got two of them on the stream right now

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah, what's really great about this organization is they do teach people how to take care of their health

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And take care of their property, be more self-sufficient

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And because of that, the government has labeled them a extremist

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And of course our media is all over that

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
We're trying to be parallel

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So like I said, go over

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So go ahead Kyra, I'll wait

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So I took a youth care worker course and an addictions counseling course over COVID

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And I can't practice because I kind of abide by their rules

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
So I offer my, like we're doing it as a parallel system

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
We barter, we trade, we even, we have eggs, we have farmers

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So yeah, these things are cropping up as a result

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You're seeing it across the country

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Like there's like a lot of stuff happening in like farmers markets and stuff

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Like where it's

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Like there's a lot of that's like exchange going on

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I know there's a

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I can't think of what it's called right now

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But there's a spot in Halifax, which is the capital in Nova Scotia here

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There's like a mom and pop kind of like

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
grocery store there that like deals with like locally sourced meat and stuff

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And like whenever they're open, like the line up goes down the street for people to get in there

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
To buy their food there because they know it's all locally sourced and stuff

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It's, it's

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
People are like collectively kind of pulling away from

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
A lot of like

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
The government type stuff from like big chains and stuff and like doing things locally

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Like the number of people I know who are like like just

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Just hankering to get into the dirt and start gardening

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
This spring is crazy

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And they never, and they never used to be

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But it's like you can't afford anything anymore man

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It's wilds

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Like it's

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's every, every step of the way here

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And I hope, I hope what's happening here is a like a wake up call for our friends down down your way

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Is like the government is just getting involved in everything

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And they just will not get out of the way and they're making life

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Impossible for people

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Like it's just getting so expensive and

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Like just recently we had Canadian Forces members

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Like you're training in Ottawa and they couldn't even get like, they couldn't even provide food for them

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So like the Canadian Forces guys who were on training had to go to the food bank to get food

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Like it's crazy dude

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
But yeah, it's

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I think they'd have problems, I think they'd have problems mandating anything

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Like you were asking about university students

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I have a lot of university student clients

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You'd be hard pressed to try this trick again on them

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yeah

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Yeah, I'll highlight one more problem, fundraising

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
So normally, normally in a normal world fundraising would be a problem

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You put up the issue and people help

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But because of the convoy, first it was go find me

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Where they froze the account and didn't let that money go

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And then give send go, we raised another 10 million there, we've been colloquial

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
The look ceases, I'm not one of the ones that started that, so stay away

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But we as a country raised another 10 million

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
All the media kept saying foreign funding, I was coming in from Russia, which it wasn't

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
But they froze that as well and then the government may be possibly

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I'm going to put out there hypothetically

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Hacked the database of give send go and released that information

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Since then, all those people have been targeted by the media and government

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Including a police officer who recently lost her appeal

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They're going to lose their job for a $50 donation they made

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
They didn't do anything else, they didn't even come out publicly and make a statement

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
They just were caught making a donation

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So yeah, everybody is very scared of fundraising now and participating in fundraising

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And that's absolutely is tipping the scale in the wrong direction

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Because people have to sell their houses like Sarah

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
In order to try and keep the battle going and now she's out of resources

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So she's getting herself stuck

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So they really, I'm telling you, they went after each pillar that allowed us to have direct

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Democracy and take care of things and they destroyed them

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
We're working hard at trying to restore that, but it's difficult

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
There was another individual that I can think of

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
So prior to the NCI, there was the national citizens hearing

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Which was three days of people telling stories

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And one of the guys that spoke at that, it was a summer before the NCI

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And he was a gentleman who was severely vaccine injured

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I don't remember the extent of his injuries and stuff

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But I can share the link with you later, Jay, if you want to watch it

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It's only like me in 10 minutes, but he needed to take the vaccine for work

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Got really injured, a bunch of neurological issues and immense amount of pain

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And so he donated 10 bucks to the trucker convoy

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Because no one was listening and he couldn't get help

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And he felt that this was the only way that he could get a little bit of leverage to make things move

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And when that data leak came out, he got docked and threatened

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
They took his bank account from him and everything

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And this is a guy who's like, can't work anymore

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Because he's pretty messed up

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And it's gut wrenching, he listens, like these are the people that they're torturing

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
The lady who got trampled by the horse, they took her bank account too

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
They trample us with horses and then they take our bank account

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Well, let me tell you, except more news there for you, Jay

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Sorry, that seems like Canada's dumping on an American here

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
But we've got to kind of highlight some of this.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I don't like to say, I mean, it's shocking to me

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Caleb Pollock is quite the story

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
So Caleb Pollock is one of these people that believed her government

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
She went ahead and got the first two

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Nothing seems to be wrong

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But then she went and got the third one, Pfizer

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It's important to say why she got it

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Because her dad was dying in long-term care and she couldn't see him unless she got the vaccine

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And so that was her main

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Obviously she wanted to help and didn't want to make anybody sick

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Right, she believes that the government was sick

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Yeah, but like she did it so she could see her dad before he died

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yeah, so what ended up happening?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Same for that

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
No fair enough

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And what ended up happening to her, she became a quadriplegic

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
But the rest of the story is heartbreaking is when she went to her doctor

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Her doctor said, you can't move your arms and legs because it's all on your head

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
So she got herself excited, she was like, okay, well, let's fix my head

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So I could start walking and moving again

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Of course that wasn't the case

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And because of the delay of that, it actually became permanent

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Because of a window where she could have treated the issue

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And she was transverse while I did this

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
There you go

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So in Canada, after that, after she realized there's no hope to walk and move her arms again

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They offered her maids, so that's medical assistance and dying

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And they made that option available to her, of course she's not taking it

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
But you can see what we do here in Canada, even with trans people

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
If they're struggling with their choice now after the surgery

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
There's no way to move back, so the only way to go is towards maids

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And we do have reports of people who regret their trans decision

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And the only option here in Canada is end of life

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Are you going to say something in her chat?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Oh, it's just they offered her maid three times

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And you were, as a medical professional, you were never supposed to bring it up

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You were not supposed to offer it

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
If they ask questions, you can provide them information

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You are not supposed to sell it ever because it's unethical to do so

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000
If somebody is in late stage terminal cancer and has maybe a couple weeks to live

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
That's what maids should be for

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
To grant a moment of mercy at the end of someone's life

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So they can pass away with dignity and their final moment

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And the final moment that they spend with their family aren't agony unconscious

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And you know, drugged out of the wazoo on fentanyl and stuff

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:36.000
That's what it's supposed to be for the mentally ill or the poor or anything

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Because once you step into that realm, you're not granting mercy

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You are performing eugenics

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Right

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And they're trying to, they haven't been successful

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
But they're still trying to extend that to mature minors

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So minors can make their own decision on that particular one

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And dimension and mental illness, they're trying to extend it to that as well

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So no longer are the patient's pain, it's the caregiver's pain

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
So if you have dementia, if Canada is successful at passing that

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Someone can sign a document and provide your end of life

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Like Babylon B did a little joke video on it, but it's not funny to Canadians

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Because it's very, very serious, it actually kind of happened

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Their joke was it got a sore knee, so let's end you

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
But no, they're really expanding the different things that can qualify you for medical assistance and dying

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And we've 30% year over year increase in that

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
So a lot of people are taking the government up on that offer

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I can't think of his name right now, there's a Canadian Forces member who has PTSD

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And he just called Veterans Affairs asking for some help recently

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And they offered him youth in Asia instead of any mental health care

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Or anything of that nature

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And good on him, he's suing the government and Veterans Affairs for it

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Because you don't do that

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
You're dealing with people in a vulnerable state

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Like if somebody is, you know, say like suicidal or severely mentally ill

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Like you, let's go, have you tried killing yourself?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It's like, well no, that's not how you approach that conversation, that's insane

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
There was even a war veteran who, Christine, I believe her first name is

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I can't remember her last name, she was asking for a ramp or a wheelchair

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And they offered her maid as well

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Over asking for a wheelchair, she's been waiting seven years for it

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
They said, oh well, we don't still have it, but what about maid?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Like it's ridiculous

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But on that note, I need to get back to work, I'm going to duck out

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I just wanted to maybe give you something to think about our question for you, JJ, it's more on the biology side

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I feel like a lot of people have injuries from excessive immune response to the spike protein

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Particularly in the vaccine

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And I've looked into a lot of healing modalities

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Like I've used a lot of homeopathy on myself with good results

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
What are your thoughts on being able to switch someone's antibody class response

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
From like an IgG4 response to back to a regular response

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Using an actual cold virus

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Do you think that's at all possible?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Wow, first of all, please understand, now you're just asking me to speculate

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So I'm an armchair immunologist at best

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I feel like this sounds like a bad idea

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And the reason why is because your immune system works in a sort of linked recognition sort of way

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And the best way to explain it is that T cells don't need to necessarily recognize the same antigen that a B cell recognize

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
In order to activate the B cell

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Because what happens is the B cell catches some clump of stuff

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And it takes it in and processes it

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And it recognizes one part of it

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I should probably draw a picture so you get that

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I don't make a mistake on how to illustrate it

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But if the T cell, this is a B cell

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
One thing you've got to remember about B cells

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And this is something that really frustrates me a lot

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I don't care about my C and my face

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But B cells don't just come on by themselves

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I have a B cell receptor and that B cell receptor has to be activated by something

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And that something is very specific for the B cell receptor

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So a naive B cell that's at rest

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Recognizes something that has to actually float in through the lymph into the draining lymph node

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And pass by this B cell and drop onto its receptor

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
This thing gets taken in

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that triangle that I've drawn in this cartoon will get broken up into different parts

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And those will be presented to T cells

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
One might be a flat side, one might be an angle

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And one might be something else

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You could get a T cell that recognizes just a part of this clump

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And that's the link recognition part

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So if, then this is where I get, gets ugly

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000
If the B cell activated by the spike protein is already linked by T cell memory

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
To another cold virus protein

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Then you might just be reactivating those same B cells again and doubling down on that memory

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
So instead of a wave, yeah instead of a wave cancellation

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You might get a wave amplification as you're talking in waves

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Okay, I'll go back to the drawing board on that one

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But I'm going to head back to work and start cutting some hairs because that's what I do

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Thank you Cara

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Thank you very much, it was very nice to meet you

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yes, nice to meet you as well

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Talk to you later guys

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Bye, bye

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah, she's awesome, we love her

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
She's smart too

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
But she's been very injured and she knows her stuff because of all that now

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I mean autism moms are another group that know their stuff because they're forced to become experts

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Right, yeah

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Yeah

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
You get slapped awake pretty hard when you get injured

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So yeah

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
But some of the good news, like let's talk about some of the good news

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000
There are some people waking up and organizing, not maybe not so public, but it's coming together

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I do think 2024 we're going to get a lot more answers and the door is going to open

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
As we saw on Monday, Canadians are still willing to protest

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So we had one here and it's still continuing

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But we also saw, and I'm going to go back to the bad news

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The RCMP here in Alberta is planting false stories into the press

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
They created a fake accident and never happened and included tractors

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And got all the details all wrong, but the press ran with it

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So I've actually been spending a few days trying to show my video that actually shows

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Because I was at the protest, I was the only media there

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Actually, there's a rebel was there as well, but I captured the tractors coming in

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
That they claim were in an accident and they weren't

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
So we have major propaganda going on here

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Created by the police force, the federal police force

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Because they're the only ones that are being sourced by the news here

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And the news here just takes it as if it's true

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
They don't double check anything

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And I know it's not true, I was physically there and I streamed the entire thing

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
But that's the kind of thing that I've really woken up to in the last week

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Is how bad this propaganda is

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
They're literally inventing scary stories and putting it into the paper for the national reader to read

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And it never happened, we never had a multi-vehicle accident with tractors in Alberta

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Just simply didn't happen, but if you go read our newspapers, it's all over the place

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Holy cow!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
That is it, it's incredible because I know they do it, I know they do it here, whatever

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
But they're so overt about it now

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah, well there's no press showing up, it's just an independent people like me

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And rebel was there, but if it wasn't even for us, this story would have been able to take off and continue

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Because there was no counter to it, CBC didn't show up, CTV global, none of them

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But I was there recording it, so thankfully for that I was able to convince Western Standard

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Which is one of the papers here in the West to correct their story

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
But CBC, they don't take my emails

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I have a fun one to show you because the RCMP have never done anything like this before

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Let me share

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
So this is from 1999, RCMP bombed an oil site in Dirty Tricks campaign

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
The Mounties bombed an oil installation as part of a Dirty Tricks campaign

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
They had an investigation into sabotage on the Alberta's oil patch

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And they basically blamed it on two farmers, and they came out and said it

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
They've been doing this for a long time, like, yeah

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yeah, it's crazy

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It's, uh

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I am, I am

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, you need this, it's a very good reality check for me

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah, well we can't get the information out, if you watch Canadian News

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
None of this stuff comes up at all, and then of course when it's not on YouTube

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
They're heavily censored there, but rumble is where we can do a lot of this

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Well, there's still camp monitoring you, I guess, who's watching it

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I mean, you can assume that, I don't know

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Wow

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Wow

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It's brutal, but, you know, people like Chad, myself and others

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
We're trying, we're trying to keep the messages out, get it going, and it's building

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
But, to get to critical mass, to get to something that's actually effective

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I don't think we'll see that until some of these other trials are completed

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And maybe some of these people that were made an example of when

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
If that happens, then we're going to be in good shape

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But, that's a lot of eggs into a small little basket there

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
If you go really bad, pretty quick for us

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Jeez

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000
There was a time in this country where the CBC and the legacy media companies were really good

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
They were exceptional, when I was going to university and stuff

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
You could bank on the CBC to tell you what was happening

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You had reporters like Trish Wood, who was very good

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
It's still very good, she works independently now

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
But those days are behind us

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Why do I hear that name Trish Wood?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
She has a podcast called Trish Wood is critical

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000
She used to be, with the CBC, she did the 5th of state

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Was the show that she did, which was like an investigative journalist thing

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Your broadcasting company had a good reputation down here, like the BBC did too

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I think people would have knocked off the BBC more than they would have knocked off the Canadian broadcasting

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Sure, but I think it was 2016 or 2017

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I can't remember, I can't Google from where I'm at right now

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000
But, we revoked or rescinded our anti-propaganda laws

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
The first thing this government did is they removed the requirement to not create propaganda

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And then they also tied the media to a media fund

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Which is hundreds of millions, if not over a billion, being paid to them

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So there's a lot of media companies in Canada taking money from the government

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And they certainly do not fight the government

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
That would end their gravy train, so we have that problem too

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Wow

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Yeah, you guys are in better shape

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
But I think we're about 10 years down a socialist curve than you are

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Yeah, well, for everybody to sleep, that's not very much time then

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And I like the way that you're characterizing it

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Let's say you're here

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Time flies when you fall asleep

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Exactly

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I would say two years, I mean what, just a question of whether they decide

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
If they decided to within two years we'd catch right up, I think

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And we have an election coming, which means we're going to be as chaotic as possible

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
For two or three months

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Holy cow

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Oh, back to another question you asked, when's our elections?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
We have elections every four or five years or so

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But the next one's going to be October 2025

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Or earlier, so in Canada we actually have elections called early

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
But unfortunately, one of the mechanisms to do that would be a non-confidence vote

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But that's already been scuttled with this partnership with the NDP and Liberal

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Part of their partnership deal is we will not vote for non-confident vote

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And we just saw that happen just a couple weeks ago

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
When the Conservative Party brought forward a non-confident vote over the carbon tax

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And of course they lost

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
NDP, Liberal and Block all voted against that

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And that's one of the mechanisms

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
But public pressure, if things get public enough

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And keep in mind our Prime Minister not even lost his own wife

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So he's not very good at keeping things together

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
It was a bit of a joke, but it's kind of serious

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Like, yeah, his wife left him what a year ago now

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So Canada has that kind of leader

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Yeah, he's a peach

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah, a real peach

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Anyways, I mean, I don't know where to go from here

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I mean, it's really, I do know that this is something

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
That is not well known in America

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It's something that I will tell as a story

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I mean, we should just have you guys on

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
You guys are doing great, but if you want

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
You can always come on my broadcast

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I hardly have anybody on my broadcast

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It would be an honour

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'd love to

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It would be great to get this out farther

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Because it's shocking to me, actually

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And in a way

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
An opportunity for both sides, right?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
If I can share Canada as the prediction of our future

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Then holy cow, maybe somebody won't get motivated

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I think Viva is helping a lot with this too

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Because he does have a pretty sizable American audience

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I need to hook up with him

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah, he's awesome

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
He's a great guy

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But yeah, because he covers

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
If you ever hear him

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Describe his man behind the Iron Curtain

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
He's talking about me

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
That's my code name on his podcast

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Okay

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Which I find very funny

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Let me give JJ one more example

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Just to show you how silly things have gone here in Canada

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
We have a gentleman who's still alive, honourable Brian Peckford

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
He is one of the signers of our charter

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Which happened in 1984, ironically

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And he was recently

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
1982, but I think he was in 1984

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Yeah

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Okay, but recently he was asked to become an expert witness

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
To talk about the charter and its intent

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And the judge here in Alberta dismissed him as an expert

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Because judicial notice

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Trump's one of the authors and the last living signatory

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Of the actual document

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
That's how ridiculous it's become in Canada

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Where the guy who actually negotiated and argued the document itself

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Is not considered to be an expert on it

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Because of course he has a contradicting view to the government

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And when he came out with that

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Pushing hard to keep the charter strong

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Of course the media dropped him

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
He used to be able to get media interviews all the time

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
He used to be able to be well respected

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
But as soon as he started to come out against the government narrative

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
They dropped him nationally

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It's tough to see him

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
He comes on my show and he comes on other shows

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
He's a great guy, he's very smart

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
And of course he negotiated I think for 17 months

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Like he knows what he's talking about

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And you can tell he's a new film lander

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
That's how nice he is

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
But that's how ridiculous it is

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah, but it's to be the same idea

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Like Jay is like you guys having one of your founding fathers

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Come in to testify in court about

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Talking about declaration

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Our founding fathers would definitely not be cooperative witnesses in this situation

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
No, I don't think so

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
They were cool dudes

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
They got it right

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Wow, wow, wow

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
We definitely got it right

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yeah, I don't know

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I don't know what to say

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I'm very cautiously optimistic

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Because

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It's got to be seen as an opportunity

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And we've got to continue to

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Help other people

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You know, feel like it's okay to wake up

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Yeah

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
There's a

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Just sort of Rose had recommended a book to me

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
ages ago

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Doctor, yeah

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Yeah, I'd grab it but my camera's sitting on top of it

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It's called 180 degrees

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It's about

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Like a lot of things that kind of like wake people up to

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
A bunch of things that have been going wrong for a long time

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And how to have these difficult conversations

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And one of the

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
One of the key takeaways in it

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Was when you need to have this difficult conversation with somebody

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
There's two things you need to do

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The first thing is you need to be kind

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And the second is you need to be right

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
So you come at this all like

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Hot under the collar and

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Like

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Explosive and stuff

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
People are going to tune you out

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So you need to

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
The trick is you got to get them to ask questions

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
You don't tell them things

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
You get them to start questioning things

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And then you can answer them

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Or kind of go like

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Well, you can go look at this

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Because they kind of need to find it for themselves

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And it's unfortunate

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I wish you could just, you know, go like

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Hey, like, I'm like, wake up

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Like, look what they're doing

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
They're stealing all your money

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Like, but it doesn't work that way unfortunately

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I think I spent almost two years thinking that

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
One more stream was going to wake people up

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
One more

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
If I just get one more

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
If I get the slides right this time

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
They'll understand

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And it's extraordinary

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
We're here in 2024

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It really is

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I will say this about

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Like, your streams

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
And all of the stuff

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Your Scooby-Doo analogy

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Makes me laugh every time

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I think it's the funniest thing

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I've heard in ages

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Good

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It's so good

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Oh my God, I nearly wet myself

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
When you explained it, it's so funny

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Maybe you could share the Scooby-Doo thing with every

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah, it's just an analogy

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
For how they tricked us into accepting the idea

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That there was a scary virus going around

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And they got us to argue about where it came from

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And who's responsible for it

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
And by making us feel as though we were actively

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Solving the mystery

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Watching Brand Paul and Tony Fauci argue

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Watching the leaks of eco-health

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Alliance and the redacting of emails

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And obviously they're covering it up

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And so that debate sucked

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Everybody in from all angles

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Into thinking that they were solving a mystery

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And that, in and of itself

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You accepted the virus as being real

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And very important

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
And deadly

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And so

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That trick was really important

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Because it caught people on both sides

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Of the virus

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And so

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
That trick was really important

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Because it caught people on both sides

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Of the aisle

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Which is a tricky thing to do in America

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
To get people on both sides

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
To argue about something and come to the same conclusion

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
But basically they have

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You can watch CNN now

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And people will say, well

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Lab leak is not ruled out anymore

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And some people think it's likely

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
But you know

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It's only on the very very strict

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
You know like if you go on Twiv

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Or you listen to Paul Offit

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
He'll tell you for sure it was natural

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But there's

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It's much okay now

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
To say that we don't know for sure

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And it's an interesting

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Magic trick that happens there

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Because then

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
All bets are off for anybody

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
That's just casually trying to understand

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Well if it came from a laboratory

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Well then for sure I should have been scared

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
And one thing to remember is that

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
This act wasn't a few weeks

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It started in March of 2020

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Or a little before

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And it went on for

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
At least two years before

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
People started to

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Get some balance

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And say wait a minute

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
This seems like they rushed us

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
In all kinds of ways

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And frightened us and confused us

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
In all kinds of ways

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It took me more than a year to really understand

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
How badly

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
They were doing it

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And then still

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It took me another year or two to figure out

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
How badly I'd been fooled

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Because I did it hook line and sinker

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I spent the first year trying to convince everybody

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It was a lab leak

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
But we don't have to worry about it

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So it's a pretty

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Pretty contradictory message

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Trying to say that

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Natural immunity to previous viruses

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Will protect you from this lab leak

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
And I actually didn't understand

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
How much of a

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
A trap that was

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Disarming it is

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
To the citizenry

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
To give the worst case scenario to the state

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
If the worst case scenario is that

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
They have to protect you from all these things

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Like climate change

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And viruses and whatever

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Then you have to go limp

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
There's nothing you can do

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You have to trust the government

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And there's almost no responsibility

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Left for you

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And I think that's the trap that we

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Including me all fell into

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Is that

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It took me more than a year to say that

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Maybe the

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
The transfection does work for some people

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I was still kind of

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Hedging in 2020 about

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Whether or not

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Maybe for old people it'll be okay

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I don't know but

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So all of us

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
All of us

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It's okay to say I'm sorry

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I blew it I didn't get it

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I get it now

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What can we do moving forward

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And we have to get more doctors to be able to say that

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
But in Canada it sounds like that

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Ain't gonna happen

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
A big part of it too

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Is

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
When it came to this

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
You have a lot of good nature people who just want to help

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And so you gave them a problem

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And said like we need to find a solution

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And we need to help people because like that's

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And like that's

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
That's how they

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Got me to, you know, take the damn things

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I wanted to go back to work because

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I saw the system falling apart

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And I wanted to go back to work and help

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And that happens to a lot of people

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And it's

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
With the vaccine or following these things

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
It's like you have good nature people

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And all they want to do is help the people in their community

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And that just shows you how insidious all of this was

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Is you took

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
People's good nature and you weaponized it against them

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Right?

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Well remember when

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
You remember when everybody's 3D printing

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Masks or the visor holders

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And you had Elon Musk producing a whole bunch of ventilators

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Like the whole world was trying to come up with

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
The tools for PPE and stuff like that

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And we were not even paying attention

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Whether or not they would be helpful

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Whether or not they actually do anything

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And it turned out to be not helpful

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It was actually harming people

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And another one I would take you through for Canada

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
When the backs came out

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Safe and effective

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Then we had breakthrough cases

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Then we had mutations from the unvaccinated

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
So we shift the narrative here

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And people just keep eating it up each single time

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They don't have long-term memory

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It could be part of the issue with the VACs

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
But they keep forgetting that their own government

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Keep changing the story itself

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But they just eat it up right away

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Because then it's still run media here

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It does not oppose

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You should know that something's up

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Like there's something afoot

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
When they blame the failure of a product

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
On the people who don't use it

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Yeah

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
While our Prime Minister said very loudly

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
A lot of people bleed them

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
There's no way we're letting an unvaccinated person

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Sit beside a vaccinated person

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
On an airplane to make them sick

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
That sentence right there

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Should be enough for you to realize

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
This guy's an idiot

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Because how could that be

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
If a vaccinated person safe

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
How could that be

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It should be the other way around

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
You should be worried about the unvaccinated people

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Getting sick

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
But this thing was

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
A way we're letting unvaccinated people

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Sit beside vaccinated people

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
On airplanes

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Because in like

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Say like my line of work

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
And like other like people in healthcare

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Like the reason why many of them like

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
You know volunteer to get vaccine is

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Because we deal with the most vulnerable

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
At their most vulnerable state

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And so the idea is

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
You don't want to bring that in

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Because you're gonna

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
You're gonna

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I knew I was gonna get COVID

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Like from the day one

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
It's like I'm a paramedic

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I go into people's houses when they're sick

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna get caught

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Someone's gonna cough it on my face

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Like whatever

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
But the idea is

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
A lot of people

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Like in healthcare

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Like well I don't want to

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Take it into the vulnerable population

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Because we're dealing with them when they're

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
At their worst

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And so like if it's not doing

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Stopping that

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Then what the hell's the point of this

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Like you've defeated the purpose

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Like

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
No but it was really clear right?

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
In America that it became obvious

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
That the idea was compliance

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
And I know you guys know that

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And so

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
That's the kind of message

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
That we

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
That I'm trying to send now too

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Is that it's

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
We got fooled into compliance

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
We got bluffed into compliance

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
That's really what it was

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
These guys all agreed to lie to us

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
In concert

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And we got bluffed

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And so nobody should feel bad about it

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I really don't even

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
If you took three shots

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You shouldn't feel bad about it

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
No

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Because most people

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Took it out of the goodness of their own heart

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Because they wanted to help

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Because they were told that there was a problem

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
You took it because you're scared

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You shouldn't feel bad about it

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I mean come on

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Yeah like they did that

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
To those people

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Like the people who like

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Like orchestrated this

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
And you're like

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
What pushed the propaganda

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And the fear campaign

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Like it's like they're the people that are full

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It's not

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
It's not

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Not your neighbor down the road who got it

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Because

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Like they were manipulated and lied to

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
They terrified

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Or they just wanted to help their community

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Or save their job

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Because

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
You know you got to feed your kids and stuff

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Right?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
It's like it's not their fault

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
It's like it's

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Don't get angry at your neighbor

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Get angry at the people who abused your neighbor

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Right?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yeah, absolutely

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I mean I

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I think this is the way

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Just like the way it would be to defeat

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Transgender ideology

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Would be to recruit the gays

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And I don't use that word like

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I use that kind of as a joke

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
And I don't know how to refer to people who

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Are homosexual

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I wouldn't say they're homosexuals

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And I feel very strongly

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
That when I was in high school

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
The couple people that ended up to be

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Homosexuals after high school

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Would have been

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Definitely

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Too vulnerable

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And in this scenario

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
They would have definitely fallen victim

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
To

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Not I'm gay

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Or you know

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Maybe I'm not the same

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
As all the other boys in school

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
But they would have really

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Been pressured to change

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And that just that

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Just that offer

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Is so

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Diabolical to me to suggest that

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Whatever

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
However you are feeling and whoever you are

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
From the womb is something that can be

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Fixed with some drugs or

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Or a surgery

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Is just terrifying to me

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And so

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I don't know we have to find a way to

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Maybe you guys got

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I guess what is crossing my mind

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And what I'm thinking out loud about

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Is

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I think there's a possibility

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
In all the anecdotal data that I've heard that

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
There are more injuries in Canada

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Than there are in America

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And so maybe they had

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
A more consistent hot doses in Canada

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
But

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The problem with America

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I'm afraid is that a lot of people got

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Plasibo doses

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Or doses that weren't

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Cared for well enough so they were kind of inert

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
But I don't really buy that one

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Because if they were inert they would still

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Have the lipid nanoparticle in them

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Even if the RNA had been deteriorated

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Or not

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And the lipid nanoparticles

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
The means of injury may have been reduced

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But the type of injury is still there

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Right and so for me it seems like it's almost

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It almost has to be that there were

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Plasibo doses

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I do know quite a few people

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Who took two or three

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
That's fine and whatever

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And I think that

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
That has to be how they played the game

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
And so we have to be vigilant about

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Connecting people, making sure that

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
People don't think that they're alone

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Make sure that people find the community

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
That they need to find

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
So that the momentum isn't lost

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Because I do think there's something

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Coming, I don't think it's coming on the 8th

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And the eclipse

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
But something is coming

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
That will disrupt this momentum

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
And so we need to be already

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Actively maintaining

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And I know you guys are

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
But we have to work harder to network

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I mean I'm happy

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
That you invited me back on

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I need to have you guys on

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Maybe we need to do something

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Once every two months

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So that the circle starts

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Getting completed more often

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I don't know

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Sorry, I'll throw out there one more thing about Canadians

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Which might make us more susceptible to this

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Is as a nation we're vitamin D deficient

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Because of our winters

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So that might play a bit of a role

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
That's why you're seeing things different

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
From America versus us

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
You guys actually have a lot more sun

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Quite literally

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I'm a ginger, I can bust in the sun

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But we're going crazy for the eclipse up here too though

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Yeah, we're going crazy up here

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
There's some crazy stuff happening

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
There's something about it

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
It's insane

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Yeah, there was a brief period of time

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
In human civilization

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Where we weren't afraid of eclipses

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
But I think that time is over I guess

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I remember looking forward to them

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
They're cool, man

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I remember watching one when I was a kid

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
It was super cool

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
One hour away from me

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I'm going now just praying for some level of

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Blue sky at some point

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
We got three minutes

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I do have to wrap up

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Two times now Chris Carver tried to call me

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
So I do want to take that call

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
He's one of the men in jail

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
In remand here in Alberta

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So just had his trial so I want to talk to him

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And I do have to get home

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And I still haven't made my way there

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I'm second left bridge right now

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
But gentlemen, let's do this again for sure

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Your show, my show will just keep doing this

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And then chat, maybe this will be an inspiration

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
For you to start up a show

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
So we can continue these kind of conversations going to

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
That's what I wanted to

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
And everyone keeps saying

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
You should go to the show

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I belong on a truck

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Doing 911 calls

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
That's where I belong

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I love doing this

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
But yeah

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Thank you very much Jason

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I really appreciate it

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Good to meet you again

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Somehow or another

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
This is the best time we met

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Thanks chat

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Okay, yeah

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
No problem

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Okay, let's go ahead and drop them

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And have you jump on their page

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And we'll go ahead and have our goodbye

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And let people know who's coming up

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And then we'll wrap it up

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Oh, no, you're going to make me remember

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Oh, yes, so tomorrow morning

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Everyone six AM mountain time

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
We've got Sam Field

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And he'll be joined by

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Chris Stacy and Marty up north

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
To tell us about

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
This Monday

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It wasn't last week

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
It was this Monday

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
But then also what's

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
The plans are for the weekend

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And plans going forward

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
And then at five o'clock

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Mountain time

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
We've got Vlad Tepes

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
And I'm sorry to recall

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
The other guest name

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I don't have it for me Paula

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Okay, so hold on a second

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I will quickly tell everyone

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So what's happening to women?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
The war on women from the

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Marxist side of things

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Why you're being erased

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Why men are in your spaces

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And why there's lots of push on

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Changing genders and stuff like that

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
So we'll get into all of those details tomorrow

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah, sorry

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I'm having internet issues

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So it's not opening up

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And then maybe Saturday we're not sure yet

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
We may have the Caleb Pollock into

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I don't think so

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I got a message from her

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
You know, I think we're not going to be doing

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Afternoon shows during the trial anymore

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Having to worry about leaving courts

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
To get here and not being able to get

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
It's going to cause a little bit too much stress

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And I really do need to speak to the lawyers

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And the people after court

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Sorry, I missed all that today

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
So while we have the clues trio

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I think we're going to be doing

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Morning only

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So we'll be focusing on that

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But it's still a good show each day

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
That you'll have everybody

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Or afternoon crowd

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
If you're just an afternoon crowd

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Just watch the morning episode in the afternoon

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And then you can catch up on that

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
But it's a little bit too much

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
To try and balance the court

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Guests and then do the show

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I don't even have my phone on

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I'm not allowed to have my phone on me

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So it makes it difficult

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
So we're going to try that next week

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
To see if it kind of makes things a little bit easier

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
On this side

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So I can get all the notes I can

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Talk to all the people I can to bring all the information

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
To you each morning

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So we'll continue with the morning show

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Yeah, so, okay, so we still have

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Okay, and

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
As Steve said

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Well, we'll do it tomorrow

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
We're going to do tomorrow

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
But starting next week

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
We have some already

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Books, so we just will add

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
That's fine Paula, we can talk about that off fire

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
But thank you

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
We're going to try and do that for next week

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Perfect, but yes, thank you everyone for joining

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
And again, if you've got any ideas for guests

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000

Would really appreciate your input

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
On who you perhaps would like to see on

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
If you didn't send us any more, that'd be great

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
And then for those of you who can

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We'd really appreciate it, in fact,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
To win and

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Make a donation at give

Dot com as well

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Just help cover some expenses

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
But everyone else is please

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Give us a thumbs up

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Let us know that you've been enjoying the show

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
We really appreciate you tuning in

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And chatting

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And it's been great

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
So there's been a good chat

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Everyone really enjoyed our guest this afternoon

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Just could see you guys

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Fantastic

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
See you guys tomorrow morning

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Thank you

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Well, there you go folks

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Not only are you going to get to see

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Sam Fields, Chris Dacey and

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Marty up north, but I believe

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
James Sower is going to try and join

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And we might get Ron Clark for a little bit

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And if we don't get him live

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
We're going to be showing some of his coverage

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Because the episode tomorrow

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Is to cover what the media is doing

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
To these protests and how they're lying about it

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And also the RCMP response

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Around the country

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
It's pretty

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Disgusting

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
They're making up narratives

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
They're telling lives

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And they're showing up with force

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So we'll be covering all of that tomorrow

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
So thank you all very much

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
For this ad talk in the car episode

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Thanks to Kyra

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Thanks to Chet

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And of course thanks to Dr. JJ

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
He's an amazing man

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
And I'm really pleased that

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
There's an American that actually cares

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And wants to learn what's going on up here

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And yeah, I'm not surprised that he was

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
A little bit overwhelmed with

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
The surprises of what was happening up here in Canada

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It is bad

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
You all know it

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Because we've been living it every day

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And sharing it

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
But to someone who's not here

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
It's a very, very big surprise

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
So thank you all very much

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
For being here today

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
And please if you can

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Give at TheLivingShow.com

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
It goes a long way

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
It does help us out

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
We are covering all of these costs ourselves

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Right now

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Plus some donations

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
So I do appreciate that

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
So you all take care

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And remember

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
If you're invited to a jury

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
You can ask questions at any time

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And if you're into deliberations

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And the law

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And the evidence says

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
You must convict

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
You do have the option

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
To nullify your vote

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Or you're a verdict

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
With a not guilty verdict

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
If you're conscious

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And your morals do not allow you

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
To do so

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
That is a thing in Canada

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Go ahead and look it up

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Take care of each other

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Take care of your family

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
And of course

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Shake the hand of a neighbor

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Or a stranger

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
And why?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Because I love you all

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
And God bless

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
And God bless

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And God bless

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And God bless

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And God bless

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
And God bless

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And God bless

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And God bless

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
And God bless

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
And God bless

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
And God bless

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And God bless

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And God bless

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And God bless

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And God bless

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
And God bless

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And God bless

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And God bless

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And God bless

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And God bless

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And God bless

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
And God bless

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And God bless

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And God bless

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And God bless

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And God bless

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And God bless

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And God bless
