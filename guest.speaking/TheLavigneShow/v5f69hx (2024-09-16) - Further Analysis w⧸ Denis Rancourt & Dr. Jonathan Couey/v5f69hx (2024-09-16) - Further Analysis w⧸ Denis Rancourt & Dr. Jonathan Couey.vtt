00:15.380 --> 00:24.223
You watched us all go to sleep And then you woke, we're just counting cheap But the end is near

01:03.751 --> 01:08.434
Good evening, good evening, good evening everybody and welcome to a wonderful Monday here in Breton.

01:08.474 --> 01:11.797
It's looking lovely and oh, I'm getting back into the swing of things.

01:11.817 --> 01:13.578
Thanks again for that time off last week.

01:13.618 --> 01:14.439
I really appreciate it.

01:14.479 --> 01:20.743
I hope you're able to catch up on some previous episodes because boy, that catalog is growing and I hope you're enjoying what you're seeing.

01:21.203 --> 01:24.886
We have an excellent, excellent, I'm gonna say a third time, excellent guest here tonight.

01:25.306 --> 01:28.309
This is gonna be Denis Rancourt with Dr. Jonathan Cooey.

01:29.049 --> 01:30.350
Dr. Jonathan looks great.

01:31.271 --> 01:32.072
We can see him right now.

01:32.252 --> 01:34.114
And Denis is going to reconnect.

01:34.334 --> 01:37.156
I think he's going to have an issue with his camera, but we're going to be good to go.

01:37.176 --> 01:39.678
It's going to be a very intellectual conversation.

01:39.798 --> 01:42.220
And please, don't worry about going into the deep dive.

01:42.621 --> 01:44.302
You can always rewatch this episode.

01:44.342 --> 01:44.943
You can pause.

01:44.983 --> 01:45.743
You can look things up.

01:45.783 --> 01:46.884
You can check out their websites.

01:46.904 --> 01:49.306
You can pull up Denis' report to follow along.

01:49.727 --> 01:51.768
But for now, this is going to be one heck of a conversation.

01:52.349 --> 01:54.190
I know that Denis has been really busy.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.071
We've had him on before.

01:55.111 --> 01:55.592
And there he is.

01:55.632 --> 01:56.212
I can see him right now.

01:56.252 --> 01:56.753
He's looking great.

01:57.193 --> 02:02.695
We've had him on once before, we've had Dr. Cooey on, I think this is our third time, possibly even fourth time having him on.

02:03.276 --> 02:04.636
So I'm really excited to bring them both together.

02:04.896 --> 02:13.680
Just a few weeks ago, we had Dr. Cooey on and we're having conversations about, oh, he went over my head on some places, but I did have to rewatch it.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.421
But trans infection was a word that came up a lot.

02:16.441 --> 02:19.302
We were talking about some shedding and we're talking about Denny himself.

02:19.503 --> 02:22.064
So when that part of the conversation came up, I'm like, hey, well,

02:22.964 --> 02:29.849
I kind of, you know, I don't want to say Denis owes me an interview, but I reached out to him when his report came out and he said, when we find some time, we'll make this happen.

02:30.250 --> 02:35.994
So I reached out again after Dr. Kouy mentioned that he's a fan of his work and he understands it well.

02:36.054 --> 02:37.215
I thought, let's try and bring it together.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.877
And Denis responded right away and said, absolutely.

02:40.777 --> 02:43.579
I would be more than happy to come on and have a conversation with Dr. Kouy.

02:44.100 --> 02:44.640
So here we are.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.062
We've got both gentlemen here and let's not waste his time.

02:47.863 --> 02:48.883
Put your intellectual hats on.

02:48.943 --> 02:49.484
It's going to get great.

02:50.674 --> 02:51.474
Good evening, Dr. Cooley.

02:52.155 --> 02:52.895
Nice to see you again.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.515
Oh, sorry.

02:54.535 --> 02:56.176
I had to get my volume up there.

02:56.196 --> 02:56.716
There you go.

02:57.717 --> 02:58.497
You sound great.

03:00.057 --> 03:01.238
Good to see you again, indeed.

03:01.278 --> 03:02.458
Thank you for inviting me back.

03:02.518 --> 03:04.239
I'm looking forward to seeing Denny as well.

03:05.219 --> 03:09.681
It's been a long slog since the first time I saw his first paper.

03:10.281 --> 03:14.963
I think the first thing he published was in May of 2020, but I don't think I saw that until

03:16.331 --> 03:18.191
maybe August or September of 2020.

03:18.591 --> 03:26.493
And I, I still, you know, was, I, I still hadn't really processed the possibility that they could have lied about it.

03:26.553 --> 03:30.094
I was still, you know, trying to learn the virology myself.

03:30.174 --> 03:41.936
So, um, I, I wasn't ready for the results that he had there, although I had some hints from other people like Knut Witkowski and other people that, that there, there might be data there to be had.

03:41.956 --> 03:41.996
Um,

03:43.601 --> 03:45.442
So yeah, I've been following Denny for a long time.

03:45.462 --> 03:51.026
I was really happy when we first met and I've watched him throughout the whole deal.

03:54.187 --> 03:55.027
It's awesome.

03:55.207 --> 03:55.908
And here he is.

03:56.288 --> 03:58.008
So, Denis, thank you so much for joining us.

03:58.248 --> 04:01.990
And I do appreciate you working out your schedule and finding some time for us.

04:02.030 --> 04:04.291
You are a busy man and rightfully so.

04:04.891 --> 04:07.472
You want to go ahead and say hi to everybody and welcome to the show again.

04:08.092 --> 04:08.832
Hi to everybody.

04:10.773 --> 04:14.094
I'm very happy to see you both, Jason, Jay.

04:14.214 --> 04:16.895
Jay, you've interviewed me on your show previously.

04:17.335 --> 04:19.536
We've had a chance to connect a couple of times.

04:20.316 --> 04:22.757
And Jason, you've also interviewed me previously.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.842
I'm really happy to see you guys again virtually in this way.

04:26.862 --> 04:29.204
Yeah, I really look forward to it.

04:29.244 --> 04:31.626
I mean, I love Jay's work.

04:31.686 --> 04:32.607
I love his ideas.

04:34.228 --> 04:41.634
I think a lot of his ideas are very exciting and very on point regarding viruses and this so-called pandemic.

04:42.234 --> 04:49.140
So I'm really looking forward to a discussion and to this exchange, wherever it may go, wherever it may lead us.

04:50.396 --> 04:52.557
I like how you're so open with this conversation.

04:52.617 --> 04:53.537
I really appreciate that.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.237
And I'm excited.

04:54.277 --> 04:58.819
You posted a couple of times on X, and there's a lot of excitement around this combination to come together.

04:59.299 --> 05:05.761
The three of us haven't been on the same screen together, but separately, we've all been on different shows, but I appreciate you all making the time.

05:06.001 --> 05:14.223
Now, I had a follower on X remind me that Trump is speaking live at 8 p.m.

05:14.283 --> 05:16.584
this evening, Eastern time, so that we're

05:16.974 --> 05:19.199
We're going to have a lot of competition here.

05:19.279 --> 05:21.904
He's actually decided to speak at 8 p.m.

05:21.964 --> 05:22.265
today.

05:22.345 --> 05:27.475
So that might explain the if you have small audience numbers that might be part of it.

05:30.081 --> 05:33.445
I'm sure he scheduled it to specifically disrupt this conversation.

05:33.685 --> 05:35.427
Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.

05:35.487 --> 05:39.731
He went through all that trouble, went golfing and all that kind of stuff just to mess up with this show.

05:40.192 --> 05:45.477
But there's a lot of people that watch on the replay, so I do expect everybody that wants to see it will get to see it.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.460
But yeah, that is kind of exciting what's going south of the border.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.662
If you want to talk about any of that, we can maybe get into it.

05:51.283 --> 06:01.294
where we left off with, I'll just call him Jonathan, with Jonathan on this conversation was when you came out, Denis, with this report, there was a lot of people who kind of did their summaries and analysis of it.

06:01.935 --> 06:04.277
And one of them, I believe, was Dr. Malone.

06:04.398 --> 06:09.243
And there was a bit of a speech that Jonathan was mentioning, and he didn't fully agree with that.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.587
So that's kind of what we were talking about on the episode with Jonathan.

06:14.628 --> 06:17.289
Just to clarify, there's been a couple of reports.

06:17.950 --> 06:24.473
The one that I spoke about and that had been published when I spoke in Romania, which Malone saw,

06:25.208 --> 06:28.510
was a report about 17 countries in the Southern Hemisphere.

06:29.071 --> 06:34.634
But since then, we've published a very large report that is about 125 countries worldwide.

06:35.315 --> 06:39.478
So that has come out since, and that's an even bigger report, it's huge.

06:40.258 --> 06:45.902
And it's got like 600 figures and yeah, I mean, it's just, it's enormous.

06:46.542 --> 06:51.326
And it pretty much confirms everything that we thought we were seeing in that first paper.

06:52.193 --> 06:56.015
And, you know, this is, we're at paper or report number 30 now.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.396
I've been doing this, as Jay mentioned, since 2020.

06:59.796 --> 07:02.017
So we've got a lot of material out there.

07:03.457 --> 07:13.101
And we've been making all our methods very transparent and all of our arguments, we try to explain as clearly as possible.

07:13.121 --> 07:17.763
And sure, there are a lot of disagreements with things that we do and things that we say.

07:18.343 --> 07:19.524
But that's what this is all about.

07:19.544 --> 07:20.204
Yeah.

07:21.357 --> 07:21.537
Yep.

07:21.897 --> 07:28.920
So that, so correct me if I'm wrong, Jonathan, that's where we kind of left off on this conversation was, uh, the accuracy or the analysis done by Malone.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.201
And you had some questions around that.

07:30.921 --> 07:46.088
Yeah, it's, um, I guess I'm just kind of frustrated because, uh, having been familiar with Denny on a, on a cursory level, I mean, his papers are dense enough where nobody's really an expert on them, but them, but, um,

07:47.069 --> 08:03.339
The point of these papers is well taken and you don't need to be really deeply read in to see the signal that is apparent in a lot of the figures, especially in the first few publications that I became familiar with.

08:03.399 --> 08:09.683
And so, I guess what frustrates me the most is I was very excited about that meeting in Romania.

08:11.346 --> 08:20.872
never mind the weird, dubious nature of having to have an international COVID summit with Americans and Canadians in Romania, but besides that,

08:21.530 --> 08:24.513
Maybe they needed an excuse to go on an elaborate vacation, I don't know.

08:24.553 --> 08:41.191
But that meeting was a place where I thought a lot of very pivotal people in the American movement were going to finally hear Denny's presentation and also maybe able to have breakfast with him at a hotel and talk to him in detail and find out that there was really no evidence of spread across borders.

08:41.992 --> 08:51.958
the correlation between poverty and other things in the United States is so much more stark than what would be maybe expected by something that was spreading.

08:52.819 --> 09:00.343
And I just found it absolutely, it took all the wind out of me when that COVID summit occurred.

09:00.383 --> 09:08.589
And then Jessica Rose and Robert Malone came back and wrote substacks about the 17 million people that were killed by the shot.

09:09.560 --> 09:16.946
didn't speak to anything about what happened in 2020 and whether there was, you know, evidence of this initial contagion.

09:17.166 --> 09:33.360
And I found that really frustrating and I still find it very frustrating because I think in the best case scenario they are sort of giving you attention and making it feel as though you're being heard, but I don't think the most crucial part of

09:34.204 --> 09:36.826
your message for me is being heard.

09:36.906 --> 09:39.708
And it's fine to say that the transfection hurt people.

09:39.768 --> 09:40.669
I could have predicted that.

09:40.689 --> 09:47.935
It should have hurt a lot more people, except I think they rolled out various levels of dose and even some placebo, probably.

09:48.035 --> 09:51.578
So for me, that was never in doubt.

09:51.938 --> 09:58.303
What was in doubt for me and what is really the main newsflash is that if we go back to 2020 and 2021, we can't find great evidence for

10:02.586 --> 10:06.567
for the biological phenomenon that they claim started all of this.

10:06.627 --> 10:14.969
And that, that to me is something that we only have a year or so to, to look in the rear view mirror and still be able to see something useful.

10:15.109 --> 10:17.950
And at some point that's going to be over the horizon in the back window.

10:18.010 --> 10:25.992
And it's not going to be something that college kids or even young adults, like young parents are going to be able to look back on and usefully reconsider.

10:26.753 --> 10:28.273
And so I feel like it's an emergency.

10:28.860 --> 10:47.441
Yeah, it's true that the first months of the declared pandemic were very pivotal because they gave really striking evidence that there was no pandemic and that the peaks in mortality had to be due to something other than a spreading viral respiratory disease.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.923
That's true that it's very striking in the first months

10:50.584 --> 10:52.807
after the pandemic was declared in March of 2020.

10:53.828 --> 11:09.506
But it's also true that if you look at all the data in all the countries that we've now studied through the entire COVID period and beyond, there is only, you can only conclude that there was no spread of any

11:10.606 --> 11:11.726
respiratory disease.

11:12.707 --> 11:19.148
The evidence is contrary to the hypothesis of a spreading disease, absolutely contrary to it.

11:19.648 --> 11:32.251
So I would argue, and we did argue in several of our papers, we've been saying this for many years now, we have proven that this was not a spreading respiratory pandemic.

11:33.212 --> 11:37.793
The data is inconsistent with that, and it's hard data that you cannot deny.

11:38.513 --> 11:47.184
So the notion or the theory that this was a spreading pandemic has to be abandoned if you're going to be scientific about this.

11:47.364 --> 11:48.485
It has to be abandoned.

11:48.926 --> 11:52.651
Now that doesn't mean that there weren't excess deaths.

11:52.711 --> 11:56.856
There was a huge excess mortality and we've shown in great detail

11:57.296 --> 12:02.140
that it's correlated to things like all the assaults that were done against people.

12:02.181 --> 12:15.152
You can go jurisdiction to jurisdiction, you can go sub-jurisdiction, you can go down to the level, you can look at as a function of age, as a function of sex, and down to provinces and small departments in every country.

12:15.652 --> 12:23.800
And what you find systematically is that it's the assaults against people that directly correlate

12:24.620 --> 12:51.754
uh to this excess mortality and that the and and and there's a very strong correlation with the booster rollouts in many jurisdictions as well and it's a stunning correlation so this is this is what we see and we see the opposite of spread because the mortality events and the mortality peaks refuse to cross jurisdictional borders they follow politics they don't follow biology and you know we know a lot about

12:52.349 --> 12:56.311
how these things are supposed to spread from a theoretical epidemiology point of view.

12:56.371 --> 13:02.335
I mean, I've written peer-reviewed published articles on theoretical epidemiology.

13:02.755 --> 13:17.384
And so if you believe the theory, we know how these things should spread and how long it should take between, you know, a seed coming into the society and an exponential growth of deaths and so on.

13:17.685 --> 13:18.665
We know all these things.

13:20.046 --> 13:26.031
The data is incompatible with these ideas, completely at odds with these ideas.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.753
There was nothing spreading.

13:29.193 --> 13:37.599
There was only assaults that were different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, different in magnitude and in kind, and they caused death.

13:37.879 --> 13:41.342
And they caused death mainly in the elderly and the frail.

13:42.342 --> 13:46.186
and mainly in the poorer strata of society.

13:46.246 --> 13:46.887
That's clear.

13:47.667 --> 13:55.595
So yeah, Jay, you're upset that people are not hearing and seeing our ideas.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.116
I'm more upset than anyone.

13:57.977 --> 14:03.780
I work very, very hard, and I try to do really good, rigorous science.

14:04.141 --> 14:12.725
And I'm always upset when my ideas are not received, and when people, it just flies over their head, or they don't want to hear it, or they don't want to talk about it.

14:13.085 --> 14:13.886
It's uncomfortable.

14:13.946 --> 14:16.327
It doesn't fit completely with what they want to do.

14:16.627 --> 14:19.109
And so they just don't mention it.

14:19.469 --> 14:21.490
That's the story of my life as a scientist.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.591
That's the story of my life.

14:23.291 --> 14:28.452
And so I am very upset since I was a young man about all this.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.813
As I've gotten older, I'm less and less upset.

14:31.873 --> 14:38.814
I'm kind of accepting my fate, if you like, that some of these things will be heard by some people and great.

14:38.914 --> 14:48.496
And it's just such a privilege to find someone who really understands what we're doing and who appreciates it and who sees it intellectually and can say, wow, you guys really proved this.

14:48.556 --> 14:49.456
You really showed it.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.897
I'm so excited to have learned it.

14:53.117 --> 14:57.500
I'm very thrilled when I meet people like that who I know have understood it.

14:58.181 --> 15:01.943
But I'm realizing it's a very rare thing.

15:02.864 --> 15:18.775
And it's shameful that a lot of thinking scientists are refusing to admit that we may very well have demonstrated that the idea of a pandemic in this context is incorrect and that we've disproved it.

15:18.855 --> 15:20.396
They just don't want to go there.

15:21.823 --> 15:36.253
And so that's upsetting and I am I have told them personally and directly in personal messages that I think that they're You know, there's no excuse for them not recognizing these things and I've made them very uncomfortable.

15:36.513 --> 15:50.302
A lot of them don't talk to me or Stopped messaging me ever since I've been saying this more and more Frequently at least in the personal level and I and and I have to admit Jay has kind of

15:51.002 --> 16:06.239
encouraged me or shamed me into, or I don't know how to say it, catalyzed me into being a little bit more aggressive in terms of getting people, telling people that, you know, hey, you have the intellectual capacity to understand this.

16:06.619 --> 16:08.401
You can spend some time looking at our papers.

16:09.022 --> 16:11.084
We think we've proven that there's no spread.

16:11.224 --> 16:12.926
So deal with it, you know.

16:13.613 --> 16:14.873
That's where we're at here.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.654
So yeah, I'm frustrated too.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.474
So we're co-frustrated, I would say.

16:21.134 --> 16:21.394
Yeah.

16:22.115 --> 16:40.018
I think the thing that I'm trying to bring to the table now after, I don't know if I've realized it, but I've finally been able to vocalize it well enough, is that the fifth generation warfare that everybody's talking about is a group of people that ignores data like yours.

16:40.979 --> 16:42.440
and agrees to ignore it.

16:42.500 --> 16:48.523
Now they might not have to overtly say that they're ignoring it.

16:48.543 --> 16:51.625
They might not have to say that Denny Rancourt is a bad guy.

16:52.185 --> 17:04.951
All they have to do is mention your name and make it seem like to the social media audience that they're listening to you, that they've taken in your ideas and they've factored them into their reality.

17:05.672 --> 17:09.574
And I think that some of these people have to be considered part of

17:10.718 --> 17:12.959
of this control mechanism.

17:12.999 --> 17:18.521
And that's what frightens me the most, that I think a lot of people aren't willing to accept this idea.

17:18.601 --> 17:27.743
We need to make this step forward to realize that in 2009, they thought about this, but they didn't have social media in place.

17:27.863 --> 17:28.043
And in 2020,

17:30.034 --> 17:50.845
the way that they locked down and the way that social media was in place, the way that the conversation was almost artificially taking place on Twitter with some artificial censorship that was too obvious to everyone, and then those same people have slowly but surely titrated us to the place where we are now, rather than

17:51.465 --> 18:03.010
getting here very quickly when they could have, when Knut Witkowski was speaking out in the United States, when you were publishing your first paper, which I think was in May of 2020, or early?

18:05.911 --> 18:15.715
Yeah, the very first definite paper where we, I think, proved that there was no spread and that this was an assault, was the 2nd of June 2020.

18:16.135 --> 18:17.576
That's when it was published.

18:18.136 --> 18:19.777
It was published on the internet and we

18:20.663 --> 18:22.084
talked about it everywhere we could.

18:22.104 --> 18:29.169
I'd done some things before, but the first real major paper with data and everything, that was the 2nd of June, 2020.

18:31.831 --> 18:39.437
With regards to people controlling the narrative, I think that there's two different kinds of control.

18:39.897 --> 18:46.802
There's a control that's very direct, that is the government and the corporations and the paid agents and so on.

18:47.603 --> 19:03.930
And then there's the control that is more of the type of because how people were indoctrinated into society, into their profession, into what is acceptable, what is not, within their specialty and so on.

19:04.310 --> 19:11.113
That indoctrination, I would say, I would call that, you know, professionals, indoctrination of professionals is very, very powerful.

19:11.793 --> 19:31.898
and acts and and we all the professionals all the people with advanced degrees and who have worked as scientists we've all been indoctrinated to to a large degree by this system by graduate school and and and by the professional schools and so on and by the the mere process of advancing our careers that's also part of our indoctrination

19:33.079 --> 19:37.562
There are a lot of punishments along the way when you don't, when you make a mistake in terms of what you say.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.224
And there's a lot of rewards for saying the right thing.

19:40.265 --> 19:47.771
And so it's inevitable that we're all largely indoctrinated and largely, we largely self-censor.

19:48.952 --> 19:50.573
So there's a lot of that going on.

19:50.593 --> 20:01.102
There, you know, there's people who just feel that they can't say that the existence of viruses has not been demonstrated because they would be branded

20:01.963 --> 20:19.121
as heretics they would be they would be seen by many many people a lot of people just drop them and a lot of people would think of them as being crazy so they just they they just know that so deeply they would never go there you know i'm not someone like that because i'm willing to entertain whatever ideas

20:19.682 --> 20:22.503
I'm willing, I honestly believe I will look at anything.

20:22.944 --> 20:27.306
Now, I do have opinions and I make up my mind after I've looked at things for a while.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.707
And there's things I don't want to look at because I don't think it's worth my time.

20:31.147 --> 20:35.069
You have to decide how you're going to use your own personal resources.

20:35.569 --> 20:40.852
And so there's a lot of theories out there that I just am not bothered

20:41.613 --> 21:00.056
Go in even though some people feel that this is the answer to everything and you have to do it I'm just not gonna do it because I'm not interested and for reasons it's it's your own judgment how you're gonna use your own resources right and your own mind and so there's a lot of this going on, but I I think a lot of the control of

21:01.579 --> 21:03.040
is organic, if you like.

21:03.381 --> 21:10.427
It's systemic in the sense that it's related to how we're all interconnected and how we've all to some degree been indoctrinated.

21:11.168 --> 21:14.530
I would say that the most effective control is of that type.

21:15.512 --> 21:33.261
Of course, the government agents and the funded agencies play a big role because they set the agenda, they decide what will be published in the scientific journals, they decide what will be taught in the medical schools, what will be the curriculum at university, and so they decide all these things.

21:33.361 --> 21:33.962
It's incredible.

21:34.841 --> 21:39.643
But then we take it up and we allow ourselves to be indoctrinated by it all.

21:40.023 --> 21:41.703
And then we carry it and we defend it.

21:42.584 --> 21:49.886
So that's kind of my understanding of the resistance that we're seeing, if that makes sense.

21:50.546 --> 21:56.308
Yeah, with that said, is there an opportunity for some people to kind of stop self-censoring and come out?

21:56.328 --> 22:01.390
Like, do you think there's a large group of people who want to, but they're just scared still?

22:01.983 --> 22:07.730
Yeah, and I think Jay plays a big role in that kind of thing, you know, because Jay is a thorn in their side.

22:07.850 --> 22:09.812
He will shame them.

22:09.832 --> 22:11.274
He will name them.

22:11.294 --> 22:12.815
He will point to them.

22:12.835 --> 22:21.325
And that, those jolts, I would call them civil jolts, are the kinds of thing that can get you to reconsider.

22:22.176 --> 22:27.163
that can get you to, you know, oh, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

22:27.443 --> 22:35.414
Like I know that when I personally went out and challenged people, some people responded and they were defensive and they were

22:36.284 --> 22:44.847
more thoughtful and they understood that they might be making a mistake and they might suffer the consequences eventually for that mistake.

22:45.328 --> 22:54.131
So by jolting people and by interacting and by being bold in this way, it can change people.

22:54.731 --> 22:58.673
Well, it'll change some people and it can have an impact, I think.

22:59.904 --> 23:05.146
Is that your intent, Jonathan, is to shake them up a bit, get them to realize a little bit of public shame?

23:05.526 --> 23:06.967
Or are you just calling a spade a spade?

23:08.948 --> 23:14.630
It's calling a spade a spade, but I don't have much hope in most of the people that I cajole.

23:14.650 --> 23:26.295
I guess I'm hoping that, and I've kind of changed my tack in the last couple of weeks, but I think up until recently, I have been kind of playing the game wrong in the sense of trying to take

23:27.743 --> 23:49.625
follower away from Robert Malone is a very small number of people it's like a million people or two million people so trying to you know fight for those people's attention and convince them that they shouldn't trust Robert Malone because he worked for DITRA before the pandemic because he has all this history and yada yada yada is still not really

23:50.746 --> 24:04.513
Sending the message that needs to be sent, which is that the national security state already knew that that social media was going to be an opportunity here and the national security state already knew that that RNA doesn't pandemic like they.

24:06.055 --> 24:24.253
They would like us to believe that there is a molecule that started in a mud puddle in Wuhan and it has perpetuated itself despite our best efforts to stop it when Brett Weinstein was still talking about zero COVID in 2021, and they still thought it was a viable endpoint.

24:24.813 --> 24:35.303
This molecule, despite our best efforts, is still circulating the globe now in an endless number of variants and being tracked with high fidelity with sequencing technologies.

24:35.363 --> 24:43.390
This performance, that's the best way that I can describe it, this performance, this exaggeration of fidelity,

24:44.011 --> 24:53.575
that never made any attempt to differentiate itself from a background or prove to us that the signal they claim to be measuring was not here before 2020.

24:53.635 --> 24:55.616
They don't even care about that.

24:56.197 --> 25:01.159
It's just the signal and the signal is what it is because all these people agree.

25:02.287 --> 25:09.912
And so you can't question some parts of this mythology because certain key people agree.

25:10.473 --> 25:20.539
And if these key people continue to agree from 2020 until now about the proprietary special nature of the spike protein,

25:21.420 --> 25:29.363
the idea that this could be a laboratory virus and that laboratory viruses can go around the world even better than natural ones.

25:30.043 --> 25:39.927
These basic presumptions upon which this entire theater is based are agreed upon by a striking number of people on all sides of the aisle.

25:40.167 --> 25:45.690
The blue and the red or the lab leak or natural or the gain of function or

25:46.890 --> 26:02.707
or whatever, these people all agree about this fundamentally incorrect biological idea that an RNA molecule, if it has just the right sequence, can really cause a lot of trouble for even decades, because it can go endemic.

26:03.368 --> 26:06.570
And there's just no evidence of this in the literature.

26:06.990 --> 26:32.567
I think that they all agree on some of these outlandish notions that, you know, if you're coming in from another planet and you haven't been indoctrinated into human created genomics and all of these fancy techniques and so on, you would say, wow, how did they come to believe these wild things, you know, like, wow, and they have a lot of faith in it.

26:33.507 --> 26:35.108
and you'd have a hard time understanding it.

26:35.608 --> 26:47.813
But being human and seeing these people and chatting with them and so on and seeing how they operate and reading their scientific articles, you can see that it's all the result of their indoctrination into the field.

26:48.614 --> 26:53.616
People are indoctrinated to believe in the technology of PCR.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.737
They are indoctrinated to believe that you can actually

26:58.502 --> 27:03.964
in a directed way quantify molecules in this way, large molecules and so on.

27:04.684 --> 27:18.210
They believe this in great detail and they do not have the background or the inclination to go in and look at to what extent is this reliable, to what extent is it real, what are the errors involved that are possible.

27:18.510 --> 27:43.231
I mean after all this is what chemistry this is really complicated stuff incredibly complicated stuff in terms of the reactions that are occurring in terms of what you have to believe to believe that end result of that little signal in in in the final you know uh uh length separated molecules in your gel or whatever you know yeah I mean everything you have to believe to to uh construct the entire genome of whatever organism

27:44.051 --> 28:11.810
it's really wild stuff there's a lot of stretch there and the whole and you're driven to believe that because pharma and and the financiers that are behind it want you to believe it they want they they it's one of their pet things this genomics thing they want us to believe that the character of of humans and every every species on earth is completely determined by this genetic code

28:12.210 --> 28:36.480
that it determines your health that you can look at the sequence and know uh what susceptibility as to what diseases you might have they want you to believe all this crap in part because it's their kind of pet theory but also in part because they can use it as a vehicle to uh enslave you into the pharma industry and sell you these these uh

28:37.120 --> 29:05.789
drugs and medications for all kinds of conditions that they will say we're sure you have exactly this condition and therefore we can give you the exactly this targeted magic bullet drug that costs a mint but hey do you want to save your life and you know your insurance should pay for it and so on so it's all all that is tied together and what you realize when you look at the development of science you realize to what extent even the well not even but the Nobel Prize

29:06.503 --> 29:31.802
is propaganda it is an integral part of the propaganda system so when you get when if you want to know um the the the technical people the scientific people what how are they trying to indoctrinate scientists and and students what are they trying to pursue if you want to look at that just look at the nobel prizes you know you've got a nobel prize for inventing this vaccine

29:32.422 --> 29:35.825
that supposedly has saved tens of millions of lives.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.266
You've got a Nobel Prize.

29:37.626 --> 29:41.469
I'm going to say this, people are not going to like it, but you've got a Nobel Prize for PCR.

29:42.029 --> 29:53.637
You've got a Nobel Prize for discovering that the ozone layer is being depleted by some chemical whose patent is going to run out and you're going to replace it with something else now.

29:54.898 --> 29:56.639
You know, all these things,

29:58.808 --> 30:00.230
Not all Nobel Prizes.

30:00.250 --> 30:05.633
I mean, some are there are the exceptions that prove the rule that there is a hard science behind it.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.937
I can name many Nobel Prizes that are extraordinary discoveries and everything.

30:10.397 --> 30:13.539
And there was a time where it had to be a real discovery.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.461
You had to have discovered something.

30:17.021 --> 30:32.988
demonstrably real, but more and more of these Nobel Prizes, as we get into a more and more advanced totalitarian state, as our Western society decays and so on, they're so obviously becoming just part of the propaganda.

30:33.909 --> 30:35.349
And they have been for a long time.

30:35.990 --> 30:40.792
So that's just me just going off the deep end, but all this to say,

30:42.356 --> 30:53.023
Scientists will believe these crazy stories because they're indoctrinated into it and because they've learned the technical side of manipulating those concepts.

30:53.764 --> 31:05.572
You know, you talk to these, you talk to immunologists and they do the gymnastics of molecules and reactions in your body in their minds.

31:06.312 --> 31:07.633
They're really good at it.

31:08.410 --> 31:17.579
But they're not very good at admitting that what they're proposing is a small fraction of everything that's actually happening in your body.

31:18.260 --> 31:25.668
And that we can barely guess all the more important things that are also occurring.

31:25.868 --> 31:28.789
You know, you can give so many examples of this.

31:28.869 --> 31:38.050
For example, there are medical conditions that were thought to, some people argued were virus, caused by viruses.

31:38.470 --> 31:40.991
And eventually it was discovered that it was nutritional.

31:41.391 --> 31:54.693
And then if you look at those discoveries about how important nutrition is in certain conditions, they actually bring it down to saying that it's a deficiency in this specific molecule, a specific vitamin, B1 or B6 or whatever.

31:55.493 --> 32:06.631
I mean, when you look at the science of how they decided that it was this specific molecule, it is as tenuous as the science when they decide that it's a viral cause.

32:07.746 --> 32:29.623
um so you know what they should be doing instead is admitting that this is very complex and that someone who has access to resources and is eating well and is in a in a fairly high social status in in the society and who's eating uh whatever they want basically um is going to have none of these health problems

32:30.103 --> 32:40.751
But if you're stuck to eating one or two stable things and you lose everything else, then God knows what specific molecule you're deficient in.

32:41.091 --> 32:42.772
There's probably a whole bunch of them.

32:42.832 --> 32:45.314
It's probably a cascade effect.

32:45.654 --> 32:53.240
There's probably all kinds of interactions that are way more complex than just deficiency in one molecule, if you see what I mean.

32:53.680 --> 32:58.784
So the question of health when it comes to deficiencies

33:00.205 --> 33:07.649
is way more complex than even the nutritionists will tell us when they talk about specific nutritional deficiencies.

33:07.950 --> 33:12.572
So that's just another example, one of my pet examples, I guess.

33:13.153 --> 33:14.493
I could just go on and on like this.

33:14.573 --> 33:28.242
There's a lot of data now out there, though, that complements this from the perspective of toxicities that actually, you know, in history, we've been enriching things with different additives and such.

33:29.654 --> 33:32.018
If you don't need vitamin A, it's not good for you.

33:33.621 --> 33:41.575
And if you don't need the vitamins that you're fortifying your diet with, it's not necessarily anything but a kidney workout.

33:42.706 --> 33:59.241
And so a lot of this sort of assumption that, you know, you can take a multivitamin and it's got to be good for you, over time, over decades, can be a pretty bad assumption, I think, especially depending on what food you eat, whether they're also fortified with some of these vitamins.

33:59.281 --> 34:09.810
I think that's, you know, part of the sort of oversimplification of everything that goes on in America is due to the way the FDA regulates or doesn't regulate things in America.

34:11.221 --> 34:18.625
America is probably the worst example of it, but I would guess that even in the EU there are plenty of examples that people could complain about.

34:19.045 --> 34:34.534
A great example of what you were talking about earlier is ulcers and how ulcers were cut out of people's stomachs for almost a decade after they figured out that ulcers were just bacterial infections.

34:35.194 --> 34:36.655
They could be cured with antibiotics.

34:36.695 --> 34:37.635
They took like 10 years for

34:39.212 --> 34:42.633
the surgical removal of ulcers to kind of become not cool.

34:43.734 --> 34:46.855
And, you know, statins is another story like that.

34:47.015 --> 35:06.383
And I think one of the things that I've stumbled upon recently that I would be happy to hear your interpretation of or your thoughts on is that there seems to be a plethora of literature that goes back decades that they realize that the use of pure oxygen to

35:07.523 --> 35:14.364
I don't know, address any number of medical conditions from a heart attack to a stroke to a traumatic brain injury, whatever.

35:15.784 --> 35:29.187
They have discovered across many different modalities in many different countries over many, many years that applying pure oxygen in these scenarios increases mortality in these intensive care units.

35:29.987 --> 35:35.768
And one of the things that we pretty much did in the United States, and it can be documented because

35:37.037 --> 35:50.243
organizations like FLCCC and people like Pierre Cory are, I mean, they were on the internet telling everybody that people were coming into the hospital with a low pulse oxygen

35:52.659 --> 35:57.762
pulse oximeter reading, and so they put these people on oxygen because there weren't enough ventilators.

35:57.802 --> 36:08.148
The whole idea was that Trump was even going to speed up the manufacture of ventilators, and even Elon Musk was going to convert some of his factory production to ventilator production.

36:09.689 --> 36:14.231
And this shortage of ventilators led to a lot of people in a lot of places in America in 2020

36:16.130 --> 36:28.639
to as a stopgap measure, if you will, were given oxygen in the hallways of hospitals, given oxygen with a full face mask, the same thing they might have done to a lot of people in the UK.

36:29.399 --> 36:32.762
And this is known already for a decade to cause

36:33.422 --> 36:35.184
acute respiratory distress syndrome.

36:35.224 --> 36:45.813
And so it's interesting because I think one thing that your data also showed, or maybe you may have observed and not directly reported, was that the vast majority of mortality is in the hospitals.

36:45.893 --> 36:47.275
Not very many people die at home.

36:47.295 --> 36:50.738
And this could actually be a trend.

36:52.319 --> 36:54.360
There's also this thing that I wanted to ask you about.

36:54.380 --> 36:58.602
So this kind of goes into the same range of questions there.

36:58.662 --> 37:02.925
But when you were on my show, I think I asked you this before too.

37:04.125 --> 37:11.549
Is there anything in your data that would take into account a population pyramid that wasn't really a pyramid shape?

37:12.149 --> 37:29.795
So in other words if the United States looks something like Japan or maybe even worse It had some kind of little population bump that was about to age out That they would have seen coming for 30 years or more Could they have planned something in your mind where they would have just taken advantage of this known?

37:30.455 --> 37:35.857
increase in all-cause mortality and just kind of swept a couple peaks together and called it a a

37:36.557 --> 37:44.341
called it an event when in reality, they knew this was going to be a five year period or a 10 year period of increased mortality because all these people are getting old.

37:44.841 --> 37:49.423
They've been crying about it for 10 years that this was going to be a Medicare financial disaster.

37:50.063 --> 37:58.287
And yet somehow or another, conveniently, this thing seems to show up pretty well, well timed with that bump in the population pyramid.

37:58.867 --> 38:02.169
Yeah, no, I don't think that it's easy to

38:06.081 --> 38:12.046
get a peak in all-cause mortality from a structure in the age population.

38:12.106 --> 38:14.267
That's just a very hard thing to do.

38:14.888 --> 38:19.311
What I mean by hard thing to do is the effect is relatively small.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.053
These peaks are very sudden.

38:21.773 --> 38:25.877
and they're directly related to immediate intense assaults.

38:28.080 --> 38:36.969
But if they're relative to the background, if they're a certain fraction of the background, then you don't have to explain all of it, you just have to explain some of it.

38:37.069 --> 38:41.414
The thing is, we're looking at excess mortality, so we're looking at

38:42.529 --> 38:46.652
everything above that would have happened normally if you didn't assault, okay?

38:46.672 --> 38:49.515
If you didn't have those assaults.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.476
So then, how is that calculated?

38:51.556 --> 38:53.718
How is your excess mortality calculated?

38:53.758 --> 38:56.500
Does it take into account this population period?

38:56.721 --> 38:57.902
Yeah, that's the point.

38:58.562 --> 39:02.725
That's the point is there's two ways to normalize that excess mortality.

39:03.205 --> 39:13.351
You can express it as just the number of deaths in this particular jurisdiction, or you can express it as a percentage of the deaths that would normally have occurred.

39:13.391 --> 39:15.852
And we can talk about how that normally would have occurred means.

39:16.132 --> 39:18.514
But when you express it in that way, it's called a P-score.

39:18.854 --> 39:25.378
And when you express it in that way, you're already taking into account the intrinsic vulnerability of that population.

39:25.878 --> 39:29.763
because the mortality of that population is higher for those reasons, you see.

39:30.443 --> 39:39.133
So you're expressing it as a percentage increase of the higher mortality in that jurisdiction which has that population.

39:39.873 --> 39:44.038
So you're normalizing out a lot of these effects when you express it in that way.

39:44.973 --> 39:51.420
And so we do it both ways and we compare and we see the effects of the age structure.

39:51.740 --> 39:59.048
So you can actually see quite dramatic differences from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending on the age structure for sure.

39:59.789 --> 40:06.596
And then when you normalize in the way that I just explained, the great majority of that disappears.

40:07.356 --> 40:31.225
okay you because you're already taking that into account in a sense so that's what that's an easy way statistically to handle that but more importantly I think that the thing we have to realize with regards to mortality is that I believe I've come to believe through a lot of reading and research and looking at the data that

40:31.900 --> 40:53.311
is that the dominant factor that determines mortality more than anything else is a sudden change in your social and physical and biological environment that corresponds to a sudden increase in biological stress on you.

40:54.680 --> 41:01.404
And biological stress, which I've been learning more and more about, which includes psychological stress, is a real killer.

41:02.225 --> 41:03.926
And it acts very quickly.

41:04.706 --> 41:08.508
And if you're elderly and fragile, it's even quicker.

41:08.708 --> 41:11.070
It can be orders of magnitude quicker.

41:11.570 --> 41:20.736
So biological, which includes psychological stress, I think, is the biggest determinant factor

41:21.676 --> 41:43.286
in terms of survival and how whether or not you're going to get sick and how sick you're going to be when you do get sick and this is really well known from a lot of animal studies including humans but a lot of animal studies have shown that the the biggest factor in terms of the health of the individual is the the um

41:44.446 --> 41:50.771
dominance maintaining stress that they're subjected to in their society, okay?

41:50.831 --> 42:04.841
So, the biggest indicator of whether or not you're going to be healthy and you're going to live a long time as an individual is your status within the social structure in this hierarchy.

42:05.621 --> 42:32.361
and it's a dominance hierarchy so the people on top are keeping you in your place by constantly aggressing you and there's a lot of studies that show that that that aggression has to be random it can't be regular it has to be unpredictable it has to be irrational if if it's going to do its job it has to be that kind of stressor and to keep you in your place within that dominance hierarchy and and this has a tremendous effect on your health now

42:33.161 --> 42:38.743
That's the overall determination of who's going to be healthy, who's going to live a long time.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.845
And it's correlated with access to resources, of course.

42:42.305 --> 42:49.508
But the stress itself, the actual physiological, biological stress itself is the thing that kills you as an individual.

42:50.288 --> 42:54.310
And now, having said that,

42:55.851 --> 43:10.914
When you have upheavals, like a war, or a sudden economic crash, or a pandemic, in quotations, that stress increases dramatically.

43:10.974 --> 43:15.515
Like there's a discontinuity in that stress.

43:15.975 --> 43:23.517
And that kind of stress, which is discontinuous, which basically makes you question your place in the world

43:23.937 --> 43:34.040
and your survivability and all of this, when it hits you that hard, that is an extreme killer.

43:34.980 --> 43:39.481
People are known to develop cancer within weeks of events like that.

43:40.282 --> 43:40.422
And

43:41.582 --> 43:59.952
that's an extreme killer and this is really well documented there's a lot of studies in this regard and it's something that of course pharma doesn't tell you they don't teach in medical school they virtually don't you might have one day on stress that's it but the in terms of biology evolution

44:01.012 --> 44:07.194
and social animals, that is the biggest determinant of health, period.

44:07.234 --> 44:09.315
That's the overriding thing.

44:09.915 --> 44:18.218
Everything else, everything else, nutrition, toxicity of the environment, you know, there can be toxic spill events.

44:18.458 --> 44:20.939
Of course, there are all kinds of accidents that can happen, everything.

44:20.979 --> 44:22.559
But I'm talking big picture.

44:23.079 --> 44:25.320
Big picture, everything, nothing else matters.

44:26.361 --> 44:27.441
That's what's going to determine

44:28.424 --> 44:30.605
who the sick individuals are in a society.

44:31.065 --> 44:49.250
And what I've argued, Jay, I don't know if you're aware of the fact that I've written this, but I argue that there's an evolutionary reason that stress induces ill health, because it stabilizes the dominance hierarchy.

44:49.990 --> 44:56.772
And the dominance hierarchy in social animals is something that is a great advantage evolutionarily.

44:57.859 --> 45:19.786
so a society that has a stable uh dominance hierarchy is much stronger more individuals do better they can access resources in the environment they can compete with other competing species better and so on and so the i've argued that it's not an accident that stress debilitates you to that extent

45:20.606 --> 45:28.529
It's actually, there's a long term evolutionary reason for that, for coupling it in that way.

45:29.189 --> 45:30.609
It's advantageous to do it.

45:31.170 --> 45:35.671
We're built, we as humans are built to inhabit dominance hierarchies.

45:36.371 --> 45:39.672
And that is stabilized by biological mechanisms.

45:40.453 --> 45:43.514
And so that's how I've come to understand this.

45:43.534 --> 45:44.354
Yeah.

45:48.086 --> 45:54.049
So that's one idea that I've put out there that I think is very promising and very important.

45:59.212 --> 46:10.938
What portion of the excess mortality in your estimation we could attribute to, well, what I would call murder or manslaughter?

46:13.545 --> 46:15.426
I don't know about dominance hierarchies.

46:15.786 --> 46:36.476
I've been in lots of dominance hierarchies before, but right now I still feel like there's something that we're overlooking, and that is that we all acknowledge that there was a national security state before COVID was declared that had a very vested interest in all of us believing that it was important and that what it did was vital to our survival.

46:37.521 --> 46:43.825
And the COVID pandemic has served no other purpose in my mind than to coerce us into teaching this to our kids.

46:44.545 --> 46:52.409
And so for me, I really want to know how much of this was actually just malfeasance.

46:52.810 --> 46:59.753
And it feels like to me that's something that is still kind of going under addressed.

47:01.468 --> 47:05.331
If there was nothing spreading in 2020, then I guess it was murder.

47:05.692 --> 47:09.134
And then what happened in 2021, I guess also then is murder.

47:09.855 --> 47:26.729
And at some point in time, we're gonna have to call it what it is because the rest of the world that locked down, like in Australia and New Zealand, thinks that they didn't have any death in 2020 and 2021 because they locked down and they avoided what happened in the United States.

47:26.789 --> 47:28.951
But if what happened in the United States was murder,

47:29.691 --> 47:34.116
then they didn't really avoid anything, and they were told that murder was something else.

47:34.336 --> 47:49.431
And I think that story is still... I mean, I'm not going to talk about dominance hierarchies until we decide how much... Well, I'm going to try and respond to your point, and to try and answer to some degree from my perspective.

47:50.163 --> 48:12.150
going to have to bring in dominance hierarchy again okay this is how i would do it you see the dominance hierarchy that i was talking about is kind of the the steady state uh structure of health in the society and but the thing is this dominance hierarchy in any animal society including humans

48:13.184 --> 48:31.337
um there's an optimal structure of that dominance hierarchy that optimizes that that gives you the strongest possible society where as many people as possible are as healthy as possible okay and what what breaks what what makes that thing degrade

48:32.037 --> 48:37.303
and societies become unhealthy themselves.

48:38.325 --> 48:41.589
Pathological societies are totalitarian.

48:42.089 --> 48:50.519
And so the way that you break down that dominance hierarchy and make it into something pathological is through corruption.

48:51.400 --> 49:05.647
And what I mean by that is certain advantaged elite elements will change the rules and the laws and the punishment schemes and all of these things to their advantage.

49:06.188 --> 49:08.129
So this is happening all the time.

49:09.131 --> 49:13.354
And you are fighting that all the time as a society.

49:14.514 --> 49:26.961
But there can come a point where that effect of corruption and that march towards a totalitarian state where everybody's at the bottom and unhealthy and there's just a few people at the top.

49:27.562 --> 49:31.364
What drives you, what allows you to go there

49:33.183 --> 49:35.104
eventually it can run away.

49:35.124 --> 49:39.585
It can run away to a very nasty place very quickly.

49:40.145 --> 49:44.346
And so you can look historically at societies that have crashed in this way.

49:45.046 --> 49:52.068
And there's an amazing book that I've been reading recently by a great historian of populations called The Great Wave.

49:52.789 --> 49:55.989
And it's about price revolutions and the rhythm of history.

49:56.470 --> 50:01.311
And they document, historians have documented this in great detail.

50:02.231 --> 50:25.715
and there's a theoretical physics paper written by a friend of mine and a co-author Joseph Hickey that I often talk about where they do the theoretical physics of the stability of a dominance hierarchy and they and they describe the parameters that are such that that the control parameters that if you step outside of a certain range you quickly run away

50:26.335 --> 50:35.480
to a totalitarian state, you quickly run away to a very bad place that's not good for most individuals.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.162
And I think we're near that edge right now.

50:38.302 --> 50:39.463
It's happening right now.

50:40.083 --> 50:47.027
And the control parameters in this very fundamental physics model that's done from first principles

50:47.467 --> 51:01.483
i've described this a number of times but i'll say it again just quickly there's two control parameters at the at the highest level one is how violent is the society and by that it means how when you when you break a rule

51:02.324 --> 51:04.445
How harsh is the punishment?

51:04.465 --> 51:06.405
Do you go to jail for the rest of your life?

51:06.465 --> 51:07.046
Are you killed?

51:07.726 --> 51:09.647
Is the fine impossible to pay?

51:09.687 --> 51:10.267
And so on.

51:10.607 --> 51:14.088
How harsh are the punishments when you break the rules of this dominance hierarchy?

51:14.468 --> 51:16.169
That's how violent the society is.

51:16.509 --> 51:18.410
That's a parameter you can define in the model.

51:18.850 --> 51:29.934
And then the other parameter is how authoritarian is the society, which means when you're having a conflict or a fight or an interaction with another member in the society or another institution,

51:31.074 --> 51:38.796
if that other institution or member has more social status than you, are they guaranteed to win that fight?

51:39.537 --> 51:46.779
If you can never win that fight in court or wherever, then that is an extremely authoritarian society, and you can quantify that with a parameter.

51:47.199 --> 51:54.221
So you've got these two parameters, violence and authoritarianism, and if you have too much of either one or of both,

51:54.741 --> 52:13.147
You put yourself into a state where dynamically the dominance hierarchy is going to run away to an extreme totalitarian state and away from a stabilized kind of what you would call a democracy where the different strata in the society have some influence on how things are going to be.

52:13.567 --> 52:17.208
how things are gonna go and there's some sharing of resources between the different strata.

52:17.708 --> 52:30.393
So that, I think that picture, that overall picture of society as that kind of an organism that can go into a pathological state and that will destroy itself and that you'll have to start over again and rebuild.

52:31.413 --> 52:36.175
I think that's very important because it directly speaks to the health of individuals.

52:36.975 --> 52:40.016
It's the macro thing that determines the health of individuals.

52:40.536 --> 52:42.377
So coming back to malfeasance,

52:43.541 --> 52:46.642
This is the long-winded answer to your query.

52:49.304 --> 52:55.287
Dominance hierarchy in a healthy society makes you sick, and that's normal.

52:55.547 --> 53:05.632
I wouldn't call it murder or what's the soft version of murder where you don't intend, but you cause the death by manslaughter.

53:06.052 --> 53:07.312
I wouldn't call it those things.

53:09.517 --> 53:25.807
But if the elite have put us in a state where all of a sudden there's going to be hugely increased biological stress that will kill way more people than if they hadn't done that, then I would argue that the people who

53:26.247 --> 53:50.771
put us in that state who transform society to be so pathological and so insane that they can go after individuals in this way, rob them of their resources, rob them of their freedom of expression, do all these things, then in that sense they have put us in a place where that stress is much higher and there's more possibility of that those biological stress and therefore they've killed you.

53:51.371 --> 53:54.153
They have killed way more people than would otherwise have died.

53:54.714 --> 53:58.837
So they're the ones that are responsible for those deaths, I would say.

53:59.317 --> 54:13.287
The people, the more you have played an important role in driving society in this direction, the more you are responsible for the additional excess mortality that is occurring.

54:14.628 --> 54:17.450
That's a macroscopic view of the thing, if you like.

54:18.211 --> 54:20.753
That would be kind of my answer regarding malfeasance.

54:23.598 --> 54:25.219
Wow, I'm taking the back of it here.

54:25.619 --> 54:28.280
I just want to kind of put something on the table here for Jay as well.

54:28.880 --> 54:35.383
Jay, you mentioned that we're entering possibly a well-known period where we're going to have a lot of elderly or older

54:35.953 --> 54:38.494
and there was a bit of a spike coming out of that pyramid of yours.

54:39.194 --> 54:40.354
Is it possible that you're right?

54:40.594 --> 54:50.217
They identified that this was coming because the timing- I don't want to be a creep, but I know I'm right because they've been talking about it for 25 years in America.

54:50.517 --> 54:53.858
When these old people get older and they're on Medicare,

54:54.693 --> 54:58.057
They cost about $500,000 every half year.

54:58.177 --> 55:04.243
So the last half year of every Medicare patient before they die is very expensive.

55:04.283 --> 55:09.970
And they were already talking about this with people like Ted Turner on the news.

55:10.510 --> 55:13.634
when Ted Turner was still in the public eye in the 80s.

55:13.795 --> 55:26.171
And they were talking about how, as the baby boomer generation ages out, we're going to have this problem because Medicare cannot afford all these people to have a six-month death that costs a half a million dollars.

55:27.012 --> 55:28.454
So we know this was coming.

55:28.894 --> 55:32.097
There's no question that they've known it's been coming for 30 years.

55:32.497 --> 55:34.459
The question is, how did they prepare for it?

55:34.539 --> 55:47.331
And my assertion is they've used the opportunity to supercharge the biosecurity state into something that is now the governing mythology that overarches everything else.

55:47.432 --> 55:50.254
And I think they've taken advantage of this known

55:51.155 --> 55:52.196
thing that was coming.

55:52.636 --> 55:53.877
It's all across the West.

55:54.017 --> 55:58.800
This prosperity window after World War II brought about a lot of big families.

55:59.060 --> 56:00.641
That's just the reality of it.

56:00.681 --> 56:08.366
And these numbers, if anything, are numbers that are provided to us by the very people that don't want us to know the significance of this phenomenon.

56:08.807 --> 56:13.490
They want us to believe that everything is normal and that just more people than we want to are dying.

56:13.950 --> 56:18.433
And that is preposterous, given what we've known for the last 20 years was coming.

56:19.875 --> 56:20.876
I agree.

56:20.896 --> 56:27.707
I agree that see what I think is that they're going to find a way to kill these people one way or another.

56:28.248 --> 56:29.730
They don't need a pandemic for that.

56:29.790 --> 56:33.175
I don't I don't think that was the main reason for the pandemic.

56:33.476 --> 56:34.237
I think the pandemic

56:35.133 --> 56:36.114
Plays into that.

56:36.254 --> 57:02.385
I think the pandemic is exploited the the pandemic I don't mean that there was a real pandemic the pandemic that was brought in by the US military for its own reasons for the reasons they had that include Corporate profits and takeovers and everything all the all the real reasons of the real pandemic if you like I That we could talk about but

57:03.075 --> 57:13.979
That real pandemic was not mainly meant to be the spear that would kill these elderly people that are a nuisance and that you're going to have to pay for.

57:14.459 --> 57:16.440
And they're a nuisance in more ways than one.

57:16.900 --> 57:23.102
When you're retired and you're financially independent, you become a political agent as well.

57:23.722 --> 57:26.724
So you need to be made dependent on the health system.

57:26.764 --> 57:28.984
You need to be frightened out of your head

57:31.105 --> 57:33.648
and shown that you must behave and so on.

57:33.948 --> 57:38.913
So there's a lot of reasons to go after this elderly population in the Western world.

57:39.294 --> 57:44.359
And there's a lot of reasons to kill a lot of them off and to offer assisted death and all these things.

57:44.719 --> 57:47.803
But they were going to find a solution to that one way or another.

57:48.963 --> 58:02.666
And sure, the pandemic played a role in terms of indoctrinating us into this idea that the government says what you need in order to survive and you follow their prescription.

58:02.926 --> 58:06.067
So it was very powerful indoctrination and training tool.

58:06.567 --> 58:15.309
In other words, it was a very powerful punishment in a dominance hierarchy to get you to accept your place and to not think anywhere beyond that.

58:15.769 --> 58:17.129
Sure, I agree with that.

58:17.569 --> 58:21.610
But I don't think that was the main reason.

58:21.950 --> 58:27.851
I think there was a military and geopolitical reason for this fabricated pandemic.

58:27.971 --> 58:33.733
Not just to restructure the population in terms of... It is ongoing though.

58:33.753 --> 58:35.793
Let's not call it over.

58:35.853 --> 58:42.175
I mean, they're still calling it a contagion that's separate from RSV.

58:42.215 --> 58:43.155
They have used the...

58:43.855 --> 58:58.209
the enormous success of the rollout of this fantastic technology called transfection to make the excuse that people of your age and soon my age are going to need an RSV vaccine and an ammonia vaccine and a shingles vaccine.

58:58.990 --> 59:05.156
And so they have fundamentally shifted the way that health care is given to these old people.

59:05.865 --> 59:15.277
And I want to just circle back again and remind everybody that I think one of the main ways that they can kill old people is just giving them pure oxygen when they don't need it.

59:15.878 --> 59:21.765
And I think everybody that ever enters a hospital needs to understand this as a fundamental

59:23.557 --> 59:34.206
It is a medical malpractice to give you pure oxygen in almost any context except for the absolute acute hours after a stroke or a heart attack.

59:34.246 --> 59:39.330
And even then, there's plenty of literature out there which suggests that the target of your

59:41.171 --> 59:45.694
arterial saturation should not be 99%, but should be between 94 and 98.

59:46.414 --> 59:50.076
And the mortality rate of those groups is the lowest by far.

59:50.616 --> 01:00:03.604
And so this fundamental inversion of how to treat people in the ICU during COVID in America is something that is completely overlooked, but there are hundreds of patients that we know of

01:00:04.304 --> 01:00:11.554
that their primary care started with a day or two of high flow nasal or full face oxygen.

01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:16.341
And this is what led them to have the progression of symptoms, which was misconstrued as COVID.

01:00:16.922 --> 01:00:18.964
So we've gotta be, I agree.

01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:46.051
And I agree that dominance hierarchies and locking people down and making people scared, this all can increase all-cause mortality, but mistreating people in the hospital for pneumonia by giving them high-flow nasal oxygen and not antibiotics, because, of course, antibiotics don't work on a viral pneumonia, this is how they created the illusion that then was

01:00:46.471 --> 01:00:48.852
you know, spread around the world.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:55.034
There were different peaks of mortality at different times and in different places.

01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:58.235
So a lot of different things happen in different places.

01:00:58.395 --> 01:00:59.595
OK, we have to keep that in mind.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:07.857
But you're talking about peaks that were used as kind of the screaming point at the very beginning when the pandemic was announced.

01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:09.338
Northern Italy, New York.

01:01:09.738 --> 01:01:12.839
But people are still receiving high flow nasal oxygen today.

01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:25.483
So they are still administering this as part of a standard protocol, which should have been known to be bullshit in most contexts Right before the pandemic there are hundreds of papers.

01:01:25.823 --> 01:01:40.349
I just spent a day reviewing 32 of them on my program that were from 2018 alone But just to back that up a little bit just so I can understand it more and also to bring another point because I I have a

01:01:42.265 --> 01:02:06.933
personal knowledge of a case where the person did develop a very serious bacterial pneumonia and they would not give them antibiotics and the person as a result could not breathe and so the thing that allowed that person to survive until an MD could be found to come and administer antibiotics was oxygen and it did allow that person to

01:02:09.373 --> 01:02:28.925
I think the person from what I heard would have just not been able to breathe whatsoever, would not have obtained enough oxygen if they hadn't aided them in some way as an emergency way of prolonging their life for the couple of weeks it took for

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:35.910
an MD to come into the house, give them antibiotics and a few other things that aided in the delivery.

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:42.875
And that person was feeling better immediately and survived and I think would have died.

01:02:43.275 --> 01:02:45.516
So there are probably many stories like that.

01:02:45.797 --> 01:02:56.784
So if you know you're gonna have a lot of respiratory conditions and our data shows that although the cause was biological stress,

01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:02.972
an associated condition of all these excess deaths was a respiratory condition, okay?

01:03:03.492 --> 01:03:07.833
And that can be seen in a lot of high-quality data.

01:03:07.873 --> 01:03:15.816
And it's normal that one way that a stress-induced illness will often include a respiratory condition.

01:03:17.156 --> 01:03:19.037
And so it was definitely happening.

01:03:19.457 --> 01:03:22.178
A lot of people coming in having trouble breathing.

01:03:22.738 --> 01:03:39.365
So they're not diagnosing them in the usual way to find out if there's bacteria fungi and everything they're not giving the treatment that they should give that's targeted for the actual condition that the person has and The person's having trouble breathing and more and more trouble breathing.

01:03:39.945 --> 01:03:51.450
And so they're giving them oxygen I'm not saying it's a good thing and you're saying in a lot of cases it would have been very harmful I don't know about that but because it's not in my knowledge base, but

01:03:53.222 --> 01:03:59.889
I could see that this was their protocol and it did kill a lot of people and a lot of people did die in that way.

01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:04.334
Now, it's important to comment on something you said earlier.

01:04:04.794 --> 01:04:06.396
Not everyone died in hospital.

01:04:07.071 --> 01:04:14.601
There, even in New York during that peak, a lot of the deaths were home deaths, okay?

01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:17.104
A significant fraction of the deaths were home deaths.

01:04:17.444 --> 01:04:23.913
There was more, a higher fraction in hospital than is normal, but there was still a lot that were home deaths.

01:04:24.413 --> 01:04:29.197
In New York City, it was do not resuscitate orders and that kind of thing that led to the home deaths.

01:04:29.237 --> 01:04:33.220
And the do not resuscitate orders were pretty unique for New York City.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.322
So that's the reason why I make that statement.

01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:37.544
If you want to talk about New York City, it's kind of separate.

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:38.873
Right, right.

01:04:38.913 --> 01:04:44.197
New York City is separate, but we've got that kind of data for a good number of jurisdictions.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:51.702
And a lot of people, whether it's France or Latin America, died at home during these peaks of mortality.

01:04:52.383 --> 01:04:57.927
There are some really huge peaks of excess mortality that happen later on after the beginning of the

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:04.910
of the announced pandemic where it's really stunning that a lot of people were not dying in hospital.

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:08.171
You know, they were dying, not institutional deaths.

01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:13.032
And for various reasons, like there were all kinds

01:05:15.592 --> 01:05:19.114
home remedies that were being suggested by the government.

01:05:19.134 --> 01:05:20.614
There were all kinds of things happening.

01:05:20.974 --> 01:05:25.056
So from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the situation was very, very different.

01:05:25.276 --> 01:05:27.978
That's one of the things you realize when you study 125 countries is, holy smokes.

01:05:31.035 --> 01:05:35.759
There is a lot going on here from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and time to time.

01:05:35.859 --> 01:05:48.410
What about the jurisdictional difference between 500,000 people getting killed in America over four years by the opioid pandemic and not so many in Europe or not so many in maybe Canada also has this problem, I don't know.

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:56.617
But in America, we lost about 100,000 Americans every year of COVID and nobody talks about it but people who've lost people to opioids.

01:05:58.258 --> 01:06:04.680
And that to me is a problem because a lot of these people are dying way before expected age of death.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.281
We're talking 40 year olds, 30 year olds.

01:06:08.601 --> 01:06:16.683
And so this is another one of those things where this signal should be computed differently in America, or at least it should be aware of this.

01:06:16.743 --> 01:06:21.945
You know, in our data, all we're looking at is all cause mortality.

01:06:22.927 --> 01:06:33.400
So we don't know if the person who died, what medications they were taking, what habits they had, what, you know, we don't know most of their circumstances.

01:06:34.081 --> 01:06:41.189
And there's only some recently some new databases that allow us to know the vaccination status of the individual.

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:44.211
which we're analyzing in great detail.

01:06:44.492 --> 01:06:55.758
But generally speaking, with all-cause mortality, you just know the age and the sex and the location where they died, often whether it's in a hospital or at home and so on.

01:06:56.138 --> 01:06:56.939
That's all you know.

01:06:57.539 --> 01:07:08.986
And despite that, as a function of time, like if you're doing it by day or by week, you see these very definite peaks that are absolutely excess in the sense that you never get a peak like that at that time of the year.

01:07:09.594 --> 01:07:12.115
and they're narrow and they're well-defined.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:17.897
And then you go in and you say, all right, so in this time, during that peak, what was going on?

01:07:18.297 --> 01:07:19.498
What do we know about this?

01:07:19.878 --> 01:07:21.579
And this is the nature of our work.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:28.061
So there's a lot of things that others will see and be able to talk about that we're just blind to.

01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:42.367
MDs who are in their offices and they get a lot of cases of people being poisoned and it's a specific poison and they can document it and all of a sudden there's way more poisoning of a certain type.

01:07:42.967 --> 01:07:48.570
Well, probably that signal is imperceivable in all-cause mortality.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:51.931
because it's happening locally due to a toxic spill or whatever.

01:07:51.951 --> 01:07:54.412
So there are a lot of things we just don't see.

01:07:54.432 --> 01:07:57.053
There's things we see and there's things we don't see.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:01.914
And so a lot of these conversations we can't have on the basis of our data.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:12.038
But what we do see in all-cause mortality are things like heat waves, earthquakes, economic meltdowns of the system.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.864
droughts that affect people's ability to feed themselves and so on.

01:08:21.006 --> 01:08:26.552
All of these sudden events that happen in society that can cause death, in principle you can detect them.

01:08:27.617 --> 01:08:39.586
And so one of the things we pointed out right away is that all these declared pandemics of the CDC from the past, that scientific articles have been written about estimating the number of deaths in those pandemics.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:40.466
Well, guess what?

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:41.687
We don't see them.

01:08:42.228 --> 01:08:43.769
There is no anomaly.

01:08:44.389 --> 01:08:49.013
in all-cause mortality for the past pandemics, you know, 2009 and so on.

01:08:49.053 --> 01:08:59.263
These big pandemics that dozens and dozens of scientific papers have been written about estimating these huge numbers of deaths and there's no signal whatsoever in all-cause mortality.

01:09:00.004 --> 01:09:01.105
So that tells you something.

01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:09.592
So this recent declared pandemic is different in that they did things that really did cause excess deaths.

01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:11.832
and you can really see it.

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:15.776
But, you know, in many jurisdictions, you don't see any excess deaths.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:28.089
You know, there are, I forget what the number is, but out of 125 countries, there's maybe a third of the countries that had absolutely no excess death for the first, in 2020, at any time.

01:09:30.822 --> 01:09:48.685
okay there's just nothing happening until they start rolling out the vaccines until the government start getting more aggressive until they have these campaigns they're basically they were i think they were uh pressured you know their arms were twisted to start doing things and uh only then did they start having deaths

01:09:49.526 --> 01:09:52.688
So all of this data is in our papers.

01:09:52.768 --> 01:09:57.591
You can actually see detailed by time excess mortality for 125 countries.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:10:00.753
And you can see all the ones where nothing was happening.

01:10:00.793 --> 01:10:02.674
And you can see all the ones where you have these peaks.

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:07.957
And neighboring countries, immediately neighboring countries have nothing, nothing whatsoever.

01:10:10.178 --> 01:10:16.762
And what we've done since is we now have high resolution geographic data that we're going to be publishing very soon.

01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:26.883
And we also have mortality where you know the vaccination status as well, which we're going to be publishing soon.

01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:29.104
So these are our next two papers.

01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:35.827
Hopefully get them out before this conference that I'll be at in Calgary at the end of October.

01:10:35.847 --> 01:10:38.508
Is that the injection of truth number two?

01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:39.549
Yes.

01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:45.484
Do you have to meet in a lot of dark alleys to get this data?

01:10:46.345 --> 01:10:47.906
Or do you have special connections?

01:10:47.966 --> 01:10:49.067
Or how does this really work?

01:10:49.107 --> 01:10:52.089
You seem to really be able to get the vintage stuff.

01:10:52.429 --> 01:10:54.390
To be honest, it's all there.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.931
You just have to find it.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:56.772
You have to dig.

01:11:02.066 --> 01:11:24.311
know you have to dig and it's it's in uh national and provincial places uh sometimes it's in Chinese sometimes it's in all the different languages right and you just have to it's it's it's it's just the work of digging it up but for the the last paper on the 125 countries that was relatively easy because some researchers

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.053
have been extraordinary.

01:11:26.093 --> 01:11:32.710
There's a project that actually tabulates all of the data that is available by time, by week or by month.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.971
and they make it all available to anybody.

01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:40.433
So our work was greatly simplified in that case.

01:11:41.053 --> 01:11:46.055
And we can add to that all the specific countries that we had studied in more detail.

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:57.959
So that's how we- Are there countries that you get the data from and you don't have to do a lot of work versus other countries where it's just always a nightmare and you know that the data needs all this massaging

01:11:58.619 --> 01:12:00.041
Oh, massaging, no.

01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:06.026
I don't mean massaging like changing, but I just mean like there's 50 states in the United States.

01:12:06.106 --> 01:12:11.572
It's hard for me to believe that that data is all homogeneously collected and displayed and whatever.

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:26.802
Well, it's mortality, and mortality is the thing in Western societies that states count, and are set up to count, and are institutionally and legally set up to count.

01:12:27.322 --> 01:12:30.746
It's the one thing they want to know, and it's the one thing they've been doing well for over 100 years.

01:12:32.809 --> 01:12:39.360
So there's a lot of civil servants that do this and that have been doing it the same way for a long time.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.667
So it's not easy to start manipulating it in a

01:12:46.127 --> 01:12:48.708
in a smooth way, let's say, I think.

01:12:49.509 --> 01:12:58.714
And so I tend to trust the data that I get from the different states and the national data from the US, for example.

01:12:58.734 --> 01:13:03.256
It's generally speaking, as far as we can tell, very high quality data.

01:13:03.316 --> 01:13:07.218
The same goes for Canada, except that Canada is a lot slower at getting it out.

01:13:08.058 --> 01:13:12.381
And the same goes for, I mean, there are European countries that are just amazing.

01:13:13.297 --> 01:13:16.238
England and Wales has been a leader, right?

01:13:16.599 --> 01:13:18.199
They invented epidemiology.

01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:20.861
They've been doing this for a long time.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:22.761
France is amazing.

01:13:22.822 --> 01:13:27.564
You've got data back to 1900 in France.

01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:29.285
It's just very detailed.

01:13:29.345 --> 01:13:33.426
And we've written about, we've written articles about France just because the data is so amazing.

01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:40.530
You can go down to the postal code level in France and get that kind of spatial resolution.

01:13:42.139 --> 01:13:43.700
Germany is very good, and so on.

01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:48.465
There are a lot of nations that provide extraordinary data.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:14:03.319
And so this allows us to see what are normal features of this kind of data, the seasonal variations, the heat wave peaks, the correlations with economic difficulties.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:14.572
And once you start to get a sense of how it all works and what are the kinds of events that can cause excess mortality, you start to develop a feel for it.

01:14:15.113 --> 01:14:18.717
And you can kind of spot when something's off in the data.

01:14:19.238 --> 01:14:24.044
And so we often have spotted anomalies in the data.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:37.488
artifacts I would say and these artifacts were later corrected by the same national institution that simply gave an update and then and then the artifacts were removed you see they were

01:14:38.243 --> 01:14:41.905
were corrected and the behavior became more normal.

01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:43.446
So that's common too.

01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:47.108
The artifacts you get are lateness in reporting.

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:59.775
So maybe there's a province or a state or a department that is just, you know, they fired a lot of people, they're slow, there was a strike, whatever, and they just don't report data for a while.

01:14:59.835 --> 01:15:01.696
In Canada we've got a real problem with the

01:15:02.176 --> 01:15:06.238
Province of Manitoba that's been extremely slow with providing its data.

01:15:06.739 --> 01:15:09.780
So you get this gap, you know So there's things like that.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:17.985
There aren't there are difficulties with the data, but overall It's not manipulated like an election would be manipulated.

01:15:18.505 --> 01:15:22.228
You can't they don't They don't manipulate elections.

01:15:22.328 --> 01:15:23.748
Come on, Danny.

01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:25.169
No, don't talk so crazy

01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:38.526
But there's a lot of data that you can design and manipulate and filter in different ways.

01:15:38.626 --> 01:15:43.589
But mortality data is about as robust as you can get, I would say.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.090
It's not perfect.

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:50.653
And if someone can show me where they manipulated data, I'll look at what they've got.

01:15:52.694 --> 01:15:54.475
But our starting position is,

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.391
Yeah, they've been doing it for a long time.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.692
And there's no reason to believe it's any different.

01:16:00.112 --> 01:16:18.781
You know, if they wanted to manipulate data, they should have manipulated in a way that we could see that this was a pandemic, or that were the deaths were much greater in certain places where it would have been politically convenient to do so, you know, I mean, there's a lot of manipulating they could have done that would have made life easier.

01:16:20.021 --> 01:16:23.643
When they know that people like me are going to get in there and actually look at the data, you know,

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.080
Are you making your data available?

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.601
Like your data sets that you created?

01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:29.561
Yes.

01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:32.282
Every, every time we do a study, we see it.

01:16:32.402 --> 01:16:35.483
We, we spell out exactly where the data is available.

01:16:35.503 --> 01:16:38.223
Okay.

01:16:38.943 --> 01:16:43.605
And, uh, I kind of want to go back to something I was trying to get to a moment ago.

01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:50.286
So Jay, I totally believe you data all the way from 1900 with France, the Western world, absolutely been watching this.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:51.087
They knew what was coming.

01:16:52.047 --> 01:16:52.847
I concur with that.

01:16:54.204 --> 01:16:58.347
But I also kind of agree with Denny that this wasn't the primary reason.

01:16:58.707 --> 01:17:00.368
The primary reason was all these deaths.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:08.412
What if the primary reason was to get what they've always wanted, which is a controlled class or compliant class, a class that will do whatever they want.

01:17:08.993 --> 01:17:13.135
And like Winston Churchill said, never let a good crisis go to waste.

01:17:13.215 --> 01:17:18.918
So they were anticipating this issue coming up, financial or otherwise, they knew it was coming.

01:17:19.618 --> 01:17:22.020
So maybe they took advantage of that, not only to

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:29.666
to do this, not so much experiment, but to tackle the problem of the cost of elderly people.

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:31.708
And that's kind of the best way I can put it right now.

01:17:32.188 --> 01:17:35.752
But they also wanted to end up with a class of compliant people.

01:17:36.372 --> 01:17:46.541
So two birds with one stone, or maybe a bunch of different reasons that the military industrial complex... They're always assaulting us so that we'll be compliant.

01:17:50.588 --> 01:17:52.148
That's what a job is.

01:17:52.489 --> 01:17:55.890
That's what the tenure track is if you're a university academic.

01:17:56.250 --> 01:18:09.357
That's what, you know, the medical system itself, its main purpose, I would argue, is to serve the state in this way, to make sure that you are dependent on the state and that you are obedient and that you believe that

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:23.102
the the the uh mental picture that they have of your own body even i mean they're always doing this well i think if you want to go big picture you have to think in terms of geopolitics i mean

01:18:24.259 --> 01:18:49.873
we're looking at uh an empire let's call it that that is having some serious problems right now it has it will no longer be the top absolute empire economic and military and it it it it is being challenged to accept that reality and it is not accepting it and it is deciding to go to war instead of accepting it so you've got

01:18:50.473 --> 01:19:08.656
A hot war in ukraine, which is a massive war like we've never we haven't seen a long time in europe We've got a huge war that's brewing in the middle east and threats of war and both of these wars are threatening to become nuclear and this is just the aggression war

01:19:09.597 --> 01:19:10.138
side of it.

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:14.601
There's also essentially a naval blockade that's developing around China.

01:19:15.782 --> 01:19:36.700
They are deciding to put military pressure on developing blocks and nations rather than accept that there would be actual development economic and cultural elsewhere in the world that would not be completely crushed by this empire that is used to having its way in all of Africa, all of Latin America,

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:53.481
most of asia and so on you see so these geopolitical changes are huge and one of the biggest threats uh to this system that wants to go to war is the western middle class the western middle class is used to thinking by uh

01:19:54.642 --> 01:20:03.846
be independent thinkers, they have economic resources, they can be independent, they can be critical, there's still a political structure.

01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:14.891
That western middle class is a huge threat to this warring deep state that wants to actually bring us to those places.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:21.054
They would rather destroy rather than accept being sharing the power on the planet.

01:20:21.574 --> 01:20:24.616
So I think those are the big things we have to look at.

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:28.178
Now, how do you destroy the middle class, the Western middle class?

01:20:28.578 --> 01:20:49.150
Well, you allow unlimited immigration and you remove freedom of speech, you remove political influence, you remove the possibility of actual free elections, even though they are themselves selecting most of the candidates.

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:57.176
You remove the bank account freedom, the ability to have your own money, your own resources.

01:20:57.496 --> 01:21:04.982
You remove the ability for them to grow their own food, to have farming, to have these various things.

01:21:05.122 --> 01:21:14.829
You remove even the concept of ownership of property and other things where people could survive and be independent and be critical of the system.

01:21:15.109 --> 01:21:18.172
The working middle class in the Western world

01:21:18.872 --> 01:21:25.237
is considered the enemy in the same way that Russia and China are considered the enemy, okay?

01:21:25.718 --> 01:21:26.518
And Iran.

01:21:27.599 --> 01:21:38.307
So there's an axis of resistance there in the developing world, and they're at war against that axis of resistance, and they're at war against their own populations in this way.

01:21:38.908 --> 01:21:45.193
So I understand this pandemic and the injections,

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:49.578
as being part of the program to solve this problem of their enemies.

01:21:51.286 --> 01:21:51.606
Okay.

01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:52.147
Yeah.

01:21:52.247 --> 01:21:55.248
And I was going to add another one that you add to destroy the middle classes.

01:21:55.268 --> 01:21:56.489
You destroy the nuclear family.

01:21:57.029 --> 01:21:59.510
So you have ideology come between family.

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.371
Hey, are you vaxxed or not?

01:22:01.432 --> 01:22:05.894
And then you also have the indoctrination of children and it destroys a parental child bond.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.115
You destroy that one as well.

01:22:07.575 --> 01:22:10.797
Like you're listed off a whole checklist of things that will destroy.

01:22:10.957 --> 01:22:12.718
Add another one, which is education.

01:22:13.258 --> 01:22:20.662
Make sure that nobody is actually learning anything, that they're all just being indoctrinated and repeating what the doctrine is.

01:22:21.124 --> 01:22:32.527
and not able to think and not able to have the confidence to advance alternative ideas or whatever, like totally make them stupid with this indoctrination system that's called education.

01:22:33.068 --> 01:22:40.510
Gut the educational system, take away freedom in the classroom, take away all of that, that's part of it as well.

01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:42.592
And I was a witness to that.

01:22:42.692 --> 01:22:43.132
I saw it.

01:22:43.212 --> 01:22:43.773
I fought it.

01:22:43.953 --> 01:22:45.975
I lost my job over it, you know.

01:22:47.036 --> 01:22:50.579
But yeah, all those methods are being applied.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.725
And the medical, I think, establishment is a big part of how they control us, for sure.

01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:00.231
Yeah, dumb them down and then numb them down too.

01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:08.933
So marijuana, hard drugs, get rid of certain laws, especially Greetsy, and then you have the fentanyl issue all over the US and other places.

01:23:08.993 --> 01:23:13.774
So you dumb them down, you numb them down, and they will comply a lot more and become dependent.

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:15.354
I think this is all a bit of a circle.

01:23:15.914 --> 01:23:19.315
The dependency on the government and what will the government look like?

01:23:19.355 --> 01:23:20.615
Will it be globalist government?

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.636
WHO, I think, is responsible for a lot of this.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:31.001
minding these countries lockstepping, like you mentioned, there were some that had no issues and then all of a sudden they did.

01:23:31.041 --> 01:23:37.847
The WHO is and has been for many, many decades completely controlled by the deep state, the USA deep state.

01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:43.352
The UN itself was created by the United States and has been controlled by it ever since.

01:23:44.092 --> 01:23:48.096
In fact, that quote I just used from Winston Churchill resulted in the UN.

01:23:48.436 --> 01:23:49.557
That's what the quote was for.

01:23:49.577 --> 01:23:49.677
Yeah.

01:23:51.613 --> 01:24:13.592
so and and the UN uh was was structured on principles of freedom and equality of nations and sovereignty and those principles are now getting in the way of the empire they're very difficult to deal with so what they did recently was uh to start scrapping that and replacing it with what they call the the rules-based order

01:24:14.535 --> 01:24:16.017
the Western rules-based order.

01:24:16.097 --> 01:24:20.302
So they're bringing that in in a big way, and that is being recognized for what it is.

01:24:20.442 --> 01:24:32.597
And so there's a huge geopolitical fight going on right now, and it's a fight for the privilege, if you like, or the right to develop as a nation and to have sovereignty.

01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:37.809
and it's happening in Latin America, it's happening in Africa, it's happening in many, many places.

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:48.904
Our world is going to be transformed by these wars more than any vaccination campaign, more than anything the governments could do.

01:24:49.965 --> 01:25:15.414
this is going to completely it's going to destroy the US economy the the structure of the US economy and When you destroy the US economy the wealthy and the elite make sure that they get far more they see it as an opportunity to enrich themselves and Everybody else becomes much poorer This is how it goes and they and they put things in place so that it will go in that direction so

01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:38.103
uh the the id system the banking system it's all structured in this way they are they are driving us towards a meltdown of these stable democracies and into major wars and it our lives are going to be uh the next decades are going to be really horrendous

01:25:39.016 --> 01:25:47.102
And the only thing I think that could save us, the thing that's saving us and that's slowing this down a bit, do you know what it would be, what I would say?

01:25:47.122 --> 01:25:50.364
No, it's a tough question.

01:25:50.424 --> 01:25:54.347
Resistance, information, people getting stuff out like the show, what would it be?

01:25:54.727 --> 01:25:55.828
Yes, there's all that.

01:25:56.028 --> 01:25:59.311
But that's small compared to, I think, a much bigger impact.

01:26:00.271 --> 01:26:04.935
The real thing that is slowing this down and having an impact

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:30.074
is the ability of nations like China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, and some other countries, and the BRICS, and so on, to succeed in not being demolished and torn apart by the designs of the empire, and to continue to develop and to integrate among themselves, so that they can protect themselves.

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:38.446
so that they can shield themselves from the monetary instruments that are controlled by the US, and they can continue to develop.

01:26:39.386 --> 01:26:55.940
That is what will save us, because if they can do that, and if they survive militarily, we will have no choice, meaning the empire will have no choice but to adapt and to accept its place in the world, which is one among other powerful nations.

01:26:56.781 --> 01:27:21.554
and to and to adapt that instead of being based on exploitation and and and and slavery and all these things like it's doing now in Latin America and Africa it will have to adapt and that adaptation will give us room as middle-class people and even as professionals as well to survive and to adapt and to find our place and to have political influence until

01:27:22.486 --> 01:27:26.429
Until we get to that place, that turning point, it's going to be very hard on us.

01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:28.831
They're not going to give us any freedom or anything.

01:27:30.132 --> 01:27:31.533
So a parallel empire.

01:27:32.133 --> 01:27:39.259
So another empire basically parallel coming up will give it a bit of a challenge, slow it down?

01:27:39.359 --> 01:27:40.620
I'm looking further than that.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.921
They want a Western world

01:27:46.083 --> 01:27:59.731
where they are the absolute boss, they destroy Europe as a center of power, they are the absolute masters of the Western world, and they eat away at the rest of the world as much as they can, and hurt

01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:04.331
the other nations as much as they can in the hope of destabilizing them.

01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:05.431
That's what they want.

01:28:07.432 --> 01:28:10.873
Are you saying they like America or are you saying they like what?

01:28:11.493 --> 01:28:13.173
I'm saying they like the deep state.

01:28:13.213 --> 01:28:18.715
And I think the deep state from what I've been reading is essentially at its core, the CIA.

01:28:21.768 --> 01:28:34.946
So it has nothing to do with the weaponized piles of money that descended from like the Dutch East Indies company in the city of London and the Vatican and all the people that in the United States that have more loyalty to these weaponized piles of money than the United States.

01:28:35.027 --> 01:28:35.708
It's only 200 years old.

01:28:36.949 --> 01:28:46.272
It seems weird because there's a lot of people who want to blame the United States when the United States in a lot of people's American minds has been a vassal of the crown.

01:28:46.732 --> 01:28:50.013
And we never really won our resolution, a revolution in the first place.

01:28:50.053 --> 01:28:53.714
And we're surrounded by countries who never revolted to begin with.

01:28:53.774 --> 01:28:55.455
You live in one that never revolted.

01:28:55.515 --> 01:29:05.378
I don't know how you can say empire and call it America when the only empire that has been continuous for the last three or 400 years is the English one.

01:29:06.593 --> 01:29:14.594
I don't really get it because there's a lot of American historians that believe we never really won the revolution.

01:29:14.634 --> 01:29:21.756
So to say that this new state and this, it feels very not accurate for a guy like you.

01:29:21.836 --> 01:29:24.556
Okay, it's not my area of expertise.

01:29:25.076 --> 01:29:35.198
The only research work I've done in that field is to write that very large paper in 2019 about geopolitics since the Second World War.

01:29:35.851 --> 01:29:48.522
and where I talked about the tectonic shift that occurred at the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the huge acceleration in so-called globalization that occurred after that and all the indicators.

01:29:48.562 --> 01:29:51.444
So I wrote a very large research paper about that.

01:29:52.025 --> 01:29:59.851
And in doing that research, what I discovered and came to believe is that nations,

01:30:01.245 --> 01:30:11.564
and systems administrations and well their dominance hierarchies basically are extremely powerful when you control uh an army

01:30:12.512 --> 01:30:15.673
and that's based on an ideology.

01:30:16.113 --> 01:30:19.494
Sure, there can be corrupting influences by wealthy people.

01:30:19.674 --> 01:30:25.735
And sure, there's people leveraging to make profits and to have safe havens in different places in the world.

01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:30.596
But every once in a while, those people, those multibillionaires, they get taken down.

01:30:30.857 --> 01:30:32.717
They get taken down by the Chinese.

01:30:32.757 --> 01:30:34.357
They get taken down in Russia.

01:30:34.377 --> 01:30:36.558
I think that geopolitics is real.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:44.687
and that it is the dominant structure on the planet.

01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:53.352
And yes, there are these other historically, and there are wealthy families, and there are all the things, and they're tolerated to some degree.

01:30:53.652 --> 01:31:02.576
But let me tell you this, there is no large corporation or multibillionaire in the US that doesn't take orders from the CIA.

01:31:03.456 --> 01:31:05.857
When the CIA says, jump, you jump.

01:31:06.457 --> 01:31:14.140
When the CIA says, we're doing this now, this is the pandemic, we're rolling it out, this is your role, this is your role, this is your role, that's what they do.

01:31:15.755 --> 01:31:22.480
That's an incredible amount of knowledge about a country that's not your own.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.261
I think that that's completely wrong.

01:31:24.302 --> 01:31:27.044
I don't think the CIA has any meaningful role anymore.

01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:29.746
And in fact, they got most of their information from the NSA.

01:31:29.786 --> 01:31:38.933
And the reason why we pulled out of Afghanistan so clumsily is because the CIA was cut off from the administration's access to the NSA information.

01:31:39.434 --> 01:31:42.016
And they left CIA kind of hanging in Afghanistan.

01:31:42.036 --> 01:31:42.777
This is really,

01:31:43.437 --> 01:31:51.139
I think you gotta be very careful because the CIA has not had the power that it had during the time of JFK or whenever you're thinking this.

01:31:51.159 --> 01:31:55.760
The NSA itself is at least 10 times bigger in people alone.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:59.560
And it's just absurd to blame it on the CIA.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.001
I'm sorry, but it's absurd.

01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:05.702
I'm putting it forward as a hypothesis.

01:32:06.142 --> 01:32:10.123
What I'm really thinking of is powerful agencies of that type.

01:32:10.303 --> 01:32:11.323
There's not just one.

01:32:12.003 --> 01:32:20.127
But the CIA is 17 that people regularly list in the United States, and the CIA is not the most important one.

01:32:20.327 --> 01:32:22.929
The CIA needs the State Department to exist.

01:32:23.529 --> 01:32:25.290
I mean, this would be crazy.

01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:31.894
The DITRA is a DOD-funded little agency that uses the State Department to

01:32:32.634 --> 01:32:36.436
I mean, it is just ridiculous to say CIA.

01:32:36.516 --> 01:32:38.017
That's the worst answer.

01:32:38.837 --> 01:32:39.597
I accept that.

01:32:40.418 --> 01:32:49.982
The details of the institutional structures and everything and which agencies are involved and how they're all connected, I haven't researched that.

01:32:50.242 --> 01:32:50.723
I don't know.

01:32:50.743 --> 01:32:52.944
I'm putting it out there as

01:32:55.342 --> 01:32:57.485
a building block of this structure.

01:32:57.525 --> 01:33:03.515
But what I'm saying is that these administrations that are tied to nations, I think, are the

01:33:04.099 --> 01:33:13.147
are the powerful players here, not wealthy hidden multi quadrillionaires somewhere that are pulling all the strings.

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:23.236
I think those very wealthy people can bribe, can order assassinations, can manipulate things to make profits.

01:33:23.476 --> 01:33:28.420
They can help lesser countries by lending them money to get them to do things.

01:33:28.721 --> 01:33:30.983
They can do all these things, but in the end,

01:33:32.631 --> 01:33:38.697
Russia is Russia, China is China, and there is a deep state USA that has a lot of power.

01:33:41.359 --> 01:33:43.401
So who is they from your side, Jay?

01:33:43.521 --> 01:33:44.522
Who do you think they are?

01:33:45.343 --> 01:33:51.549
I would say that you have to think of it in terms of people that aren't related to a nation state.

01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:56.374
I think that the way that Denny is describing it might lead some...

01:33:57.054 --> 01:34:03.136
listeners to believe that there are Americans who believe in America and want America to be great.

01:34:03.277 --> 01:34:09.759
And they consider themselves patriots by acting in the way that Denny describes and killing Americans or doing whatever.

01:34:09.799 --> 01:34:10.800
And that's ridiculous.

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:20.223
I think there are traitors inside the US government who have been working against us on behalf of other people and powers.

01:34:20.503 --> 01:34:24.025
And they might be the crown, it might be the city of London, it might be

01:34:24.705 --> 01:34:27.132
the vatican it might be black rock it might be

01:34:28.216 --> 01:34:56.639
Palantir, it might be all of these things in concert, but the United States government is not run by Congress, in cooperation with the President, and this three-part government is an illusion, that is controlled by weaponized piles of money, and we've known this for a very long time, and the intelligence agencies are very important, but their links

01:34:58.164 --> 01:35:00.806
other intelligence agencies are what we need to understand.

01:35:00.866 --> 01:35:09.653
Because again, I think the idea that there is an American-centered thing is only an illusion that works for them.

01:35:10.213 --> 01:35:15.997
Because these people don't have any loyalties to a flag or any loyalties to a soil.

01:35:16.538 --> 01:35:17.739
And the fact of the matter is,

01:35:18.659 --> 01:35:41.611
I have loyalty to a soil and to a flag because I'm an American, this is where I live, this is where my kids live, and I do want the American society to be a successful and thriving society, but I don't think there's anybody in government or in the military that thinks the way that happens is by enslaving people or killing people or bioterrorism or anything like that.

01:35:41.691 --> 01:35:42.512
Those people

01:35:43.052 --> 01:35:50.035
who are responsible for where we are now are doing it in a way to control, demolish what's left of America.

01:35:50.556 --> 01:35:52.496
This is the last bastion of freedom.

01:35:52.576 --> 01:35:58.119
Canada doesn't have the freedom that America has and there is no country on earth that does.

01:35:58.179 --> 01:36:09.865
And so these people know that and they have been undermining this democracy as like it or not, this is the only place where some of these ideals are codified in law.

01:36:11.713 --> 01:36:14.895
If America is the focus of anything, it is because of that.

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:19.477
It is not because all the masterminds are over here and they're all working for American flags.

01:36:19.537 --> 01:36:20.457
That's ridiculous.

01:36:20.557 --> 01:36:23.699
That's not really what I was saying, right?

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:33.063
I accept the thing that you're critiquing, but the thing that you're critiquing is not what I was saying.

01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:50.053
Okay, so that's what I I was it's it's difficult to talk about these things partly because you only know I only know some pieces of it that I'm able to put together and then I You're asking me to say well, what is my coherent picture?

01:36:50.073 --> 01:37:01.160
What does it look like, you know, and so you do the best you can but I agree with you that it is not The American people

01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:03.211
that are doing this.

01:37:03.691 --> 01:37:17.502
The empire that is wanting to go to war and that is wanting to do this in a very serious way and that is wanting to kill the middle class and so on is not the American people and it's not based on the American people.

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:28.971
I agree with you that it is an oligarchy, that it is a whole network, like an octopus of financial interests, corporate interests.

01:37:30.352 --> 01:37:30.852
Some are

01:37:32.473 --> 01:37:35.395
Old and and old money some new money and so on.

01:37:35.535 --> 01:37:54.545
I I agree with you I I I also think that the people that we see and that we're critical of like gates and people like that and sorrows Are not the real players that that those are just the puppets that we see I think I think the the power That's behind them is even greater than them, right?

01:37:55.105 --> 01:38:01.549
But it is it and it's a network and I agree with all that but I I do not believe that that network

01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:21.608
Penetrates significantly into Russia China Iran, for example, okay, and I do believe that it can be Expelled from countries like Venezuela and so on Cuba and so on they do expel these people I mean China expelled Soros like 20 was it 25 years ago?

01:38:21.628 --> 01:38:23.249
They just said you're you're out of here.

01:38:23.509 --> 01:38:27.690
We don't want any of your foundations We don't want any of that money and they expelled them.

01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:30.070
I don't know if they ever expelled Kissinger.

01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:30.110
I

01:38:31.587 --> 01:38:32.488
Yeah, sure.

01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:38.113
It's complicated, and it's not a clear, clean-cut thing.

01:38:40.423 --> 01:38:52.611
US ideology and propaganda penetrates into all these places and their influence and the economic ties between the US and China are huge.

01:38:52.671 --> 01:38:57.875
They're not about to be severed in any sudden, very sudden way.

01:38:59.496 --> 01:39:07.541
So it's complex, but still, my starting point is I believe in geopolitics, I believe that

01:39:08.261 --> 01:39:11.463
geopolitics didn't stop to be relevant all of a sudden.

01:39:11.884 --> 01:39:15.366
It is very big and it's very real.

01:39:16.226 --> 01:39:35.719
And if Russia is able to completely reorganize its economy in order to sustain a war, a war of aggression, where they're using Ukraine as a proxy, and all of NATO in the Western world is trying to find some way to draw Russia in,

01:39:36.383 --> 01:39:52.589
and by the sheer military might, thanks to quickly organizing and creating an industry and creating economic ties with other people and so on, the fact that Russia is able to do that, that means that Russia is real.

01:39:54.465 --> 01:39:55.606
It is a real entity.

01:39:56.347 --> 01:39:57.969
And it's a political entity.

01:39:58.009 --> 01:39:59.650
It's a social entity.

01:40:00.071 --> 01:40:01.592
And the same for China.

01:40:01.713 --> 01:40:05.917
China has done amazing things since Mao.

01:40:06.157 --> 01:40:10.301
It has always been completely under the thumb of the Western world.

01:40:11.042 --> 01:40:12.804
And it has turned itself around.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:23.467
alleviated poverty on the scale of more than a billion people and become this powerhouse of a modern state.

01:40:24.008 --> 01:40:30.232
This did not happen because some hidden multi-billionaires wanted it to happen.

01:40:30.813 --> 01:40:36.757
This happened because they maneuvered things in a context where these billionaires are acting.

01:40:37.518 --> 01:40:41.221
I wrote about it in my paper on geopolitics

01:40:42.802 --> 01:40:48.104
the US tried to take over China by economic cooperation.

01:40:48.844 --> 01:41:07.910
And as soon as they understood that China was circumventing their control and having its own development and keeping its own centers of education and scientific development and so on, then they decided, whoa, this is not going to the right place.

01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:11.291
They decided to rework the deal, if you like.

01:41:11.792 --> 01:41:15.815
And now they're in confrontation and they're risking war.

01:41:16.415 --> 01:41:27.883
So I think those are big realities, geopolitical realities that you can't just imagine that there are these hidden players that control everything.

01:41:29.704 --> 01:41:30.905
I don't think that's the case.

01:41:34.375 --> 01:41:36.315
So that's my bias.

01:41:36.595 --> 01:41:39.196
That's what I've come to believe from what I can see.

01:41:39.736 --> 01:41:51.358
But I'm always open to a really good research paper that spells out, like I've read the papers that spell out who these people are and what their historical links are and the lineage and everything.

01:41:51.798 --> 01:41:59.600
But then I look at it and I say, OK, but how is that tied to actual real institutional and nation scale power?

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.080
And I don't see it.

01:42:02.338 --> 01:42:02.658
Okay.

01:42:03.319 --> 01:42:04.540
I see people making money.

01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.742
I see fortunes moving around.

01:42:07.202 --> 01:42:12.026
I see, you know, medical schools being taken over.

01:42:12.487 --> 01:42:15.129
I see high influence in education.

01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:16.050
I see propaganda.

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:17.691
I see all these manipulations.

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:21.274
But ultimately, how is it tied to real power?

01:42:23.266 --> 01:42:28.950
And it's probably more tied to real power in the US than many other places.

01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:32.932
And so that's why we come back to the US, OK?

01:42:33.853 --> 01:42:36.114
And what we call the deep state there.

01:42:37.575 --> 01:42:40.978
So those are my kind of pushback thoughts, if you like.

01:42:42.539 --> 01:42:50.003
But a lot of people think that I'm very naive with regards to believing in geopolitics.

01:42:51.764 --> 01:42:58.267
as being more important than these historic financial forces, if you like.

01:42:58.287 --> 01:43:06.290
Okay, that's a good way to put it because while we don't really know, there could be many days and it could be a very complicated thing.

01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:11.652
You know, hear stories like the 13 families and thousands of years and they've always had the power.

01:43:11.672 --> 01:43:19.515
And you know what, Jason, I can guarantee that no university academics will have research that's funded to find out.

01:43:20.413 --> 01:43:20.833
Correct.

01:43:20.933 --> 01:43:23.134
So you're going to have a lack of data and papers.

01:43:23.714 --> 01:43:46.280
If you created a research institute and you started to fund it, if the government said, we've got to know who's in charge here, and we need all the lines to be drawn, and we need to know who has money where, and where their holdings are, and what they're connected to, and I want us to find out, I'm going to put some people on it, and we're going to fund this thing, we're going to find out, then you would find out.

01:43:47.386 --> 01:43:50.208
But the problem is it would become transparent.

01:43:50.508 --> 01:43:52.190
Everyone would know, you'd be able to see it.

01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:56.973
And so all these politicians, you'd know where their money's coming from and so on.

01:43:58.014 --> 01:44:02.758
Yeah, no, I think if that was something that was attempted, you'd see another signal in excess mortality.

01:44:03.178 --> 01:44:04.099
Very regional.

01:44:04.119 --> 01:44:05.440
That's what I think you'd find.

01:44:08.328 --> 01:44:12.050
Yeah, no, there's no way that's going to come out at any time soon.

01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:15.412
And I believe Jay is a lot closer to, I think, what's going on here.

01:44:15.432 --> 01:44:17.053
It may not be a border issue.

01:44:17.073 --> 01:44:19.034
It may not be a nation issue or a state issue at all.

01:44:19.935 --> 01:44:27.599
There's a lot of power consolidated in the US, sure, Rockefellers and others, but globally, Rothschilds and others, the City of London.

01:44:29.093 --> 01:44:30.314
It's a very complicated issue.

01:44:30.374 --> 01:44:32.356
That's why I ask, who's the they?

01:44:33.196 --> 01:44:34.197
There may be many theys.

01:44:34.777 --> 01:44:38.220
And we're all just kind of focusing on maybe one, but there may be many.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:45.986
Well, there's some people who advance the theory or the hypothesis that even China and Russia are controlled by these people.

01:44:46.126 --> 01:44:48.388
And that there's just one world.

01:44:48.728 --> 01:44:50.329
And this is all a show.

01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.692
And we're just watching this puppet show.

01:44:54.292 --> 01:44:56.774
But there's only a few people pulling all the strings.

01:44:58.908 --> 01:45:00.229
I'm just not ready to accept that.

01:45:00.289 --> 01:45:01.630
I think that's just crazy.

01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.310
Okay.

01:45:02.851 --> 01:45:12.437
I, from, from my observations, the inner workings and the outer expression of what's happening in Russia and China, which I tend to follow a lot.

01:45:12.917 --> 01:45:14.398
And I, a lot of trusted.

01:45:15.099 --> 01:45:22.023
Analysts and reporters that I read and so on that I know personally, there's just no way that's, that's anywhere near reality.

01:45:22.144 --> 01:45:23.805
You know, I just don't believe that at all.

01:45:24.285 --> 01:45:24.885
No folks.

01:45:25.005 --> 01:45:26.687
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:26.727 --> 01:45:28.348
That's just no, sorry.

01:45:28.368 --> 01:45:28.408
No.

01:45:30.849 --> 01:45:32.550
You're a data guy, you need more data.

01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:53.040
I can't tell you that the only way that that would happen in my very limited experience is if you had traders on the inside of China and traders on the inside of Russia because my experience can only be drawn from my moving to the Netherlands and living there for a while and marrying a woman and learning Dutch.

01:45:54.477 --> 01:46:00.401
trying to sort of understand a culture of 17 million people with a few hundred years of history.

01:46:00.421 --> 01:46:15.031
And, uh, you know, you, you can, you can study a long time before you're going to know enough of the language and the history of a culture to, to talk to them in an influential way and have influence on them intellectually.

01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:19.474
And, and so it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where a,

01:46:20.831 --> 01:46:29.996
a multi-thousand year old culture with a different writing and a different language that's not based on anything that's phonetically or

01:46:32.774 --> 01:46:43.863
scriptically related to ours, graphically or grammatically, that we would be able to usefully influence that culture without direct help from traders.

01:46:43.923 --> 01:46:49.367
Now, that being said, I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I don't think they ever kicked Kissinger out.

01:46:49.908 --> 01:46:52.930
And Klaus Schwab seems to have a lot of fun over there when he goes.

01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:53.130
So,

01:46:55.212 --> 01:47:07.443
I'm not against the idea that they all sit at the same table and they are all willing to tell lies to their prospective countries.

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:09.724
There are some tables where they all sit.

01:47:09.965 --> 01:47:11.726
They all participate in the UN.

01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:15.790
They all participate in the World Health Organization.

01:47:15.850 --> 01:47:16.991
Those are the ones that we see.

01:47:17.071 --> 01:47:19.653
I can't believe that the ones that we see are the ones that matter.

01:47:19.973 --> 01:47:20.273
No, no.

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:26.798
And there's others which they tell us about as well, which is the... Bilderberg and others like that?

01:47:26.858 --> 01:47:27.498
No, no, no, no.

01:47:27.578 --> 01:47:37.064
The secret agencies, the police, the CIA and what used to be called the KGB and so on, they talk to each other in a very direct way all the time.

01:47:38.805 --> 01:47:43.148
Putin described this in detail when they asked him, well, you know, this is serious.

01:47:43.208 --> 01:47:44.189
You guys got to talk.

01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:45.850
Are you going to talk to Biden and so on?

01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:49.072
He says, well, our people are going to talk to their people.

01:47:49.522 --> 01:47:52.624
you know, that's how it works.

01:47:55.006 --> 01:48:04.633
But there are traitors, of course there are traitors, there are always traitors who get bought out, who get advantages from... there are spies everywhere.

01:48:05.373 --> 01:48:06.534
Israel is amazing at

01:48:07.995 --> 01:48:10.936
getting spies by various methods in every place.

01:48:10.996 --> 01:48:12.577
They know where everybody is.

01:48:12.637 --> 01:48:17.959
They can kill someone with a missile who's sitting in an apartment in a different country whenever they want, you know.

01:48:18.359 --> 01:48:31.124
Of course there are spies and traitors, but the point is these influential and powerful and successful nations, it's a full-time job for them to root out these traitors.

01:48:32.737 --> 01:48:36.064
to identify them and to annihilate them.

01:48:36.204 --> 01:48:37.106
This is what they do.

01:48:37.166 --> 01:48:38.348
It's a full-time job.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:46.764
That that comes with the territory every every nation Does that in a sense?

01:48:47.384 --> 01:48:59.552
So for example in canada we go after uh, these people but not we don't go after american spies and diplomats And the ones that are really controlling canada, which is the u.s.

01:48:59.772 --> 01:49:03.094
We don't go after them They're not considered spies or traitors or anything.

01:49:03.474 --> 01:49:05.396
We don't have sovereignty in canada.

01:49:05.416 --> 01:49:07.417
Uh, we're completely

01:49:07.995 --> 01:49:14.504
run by a massive, I don't know if you've ever been to Ottawa, but the US Embassy is like the biggest building in Ottawa.

01:49:14.885 --> 01:49:22.715
And it's a massive reinforced cement bunker with a great big radar head on, on top and everything.

01:49:22.755 --> 01:49:24.718
They basically run the country, you know.

01:49:27.917 --> 01:49:37.684
Who was the diplomat that very humorously said, you know, when they asked him, how come there's never been a coup in the U.S.?

01:49:38.244 --> 01:49:41.326
And his answer was, well, there isn't an embassy in the, there isn't a U.S.

01:49:41.386 --> 01:49:42.267
embassy in the U.S.

01:49:48.717 --> 01:49:52.519
I think US power is huge and is real.

01:49:52.859 --> 01:49:56.522
We're talking about almost a thousand military bases around the world.

01:49:56.802 --> 01:49:59.704
You know, they're not billionaires running those bases.

01:49:59.764 --> 01:50:04.227
They have to be run by an administration, by people who think and plan.

01:50:04.507 --> 01:50:05.908
There's military intelligence.

01:50:05.988 --> 01:50:07.429
There's industrial intelligence.

01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:14.174
There's people who figure that they've made mistakes and who would like to ratchet it back, but there's no way they're going to be able to.

01:50:14.554 --> 01:50:16.075
But in Russia, they were able to.

01:50:16.495 --> 01:50:17.036
In Russia,

01:50:17.976 --> 01:50:26.921
Putin as soon as he came into power This is this anecdote is really well known and it's told by a lot of people But he got all the billionaires together in a room.

01:50:27.441 --> 01:50:28.422
He rounded them all up.

01:50:28.522 --> 01:50:33.265
He sat down with them You've heard this story before right and he said to them.

01:50:33.305 --> 01:50:40.028
He said listen I'm not gonna take away your wealth But you've got to be fair to your employees.

01:50:40.048 --> 01:50:44.071
You've got to be fair to people and you've got to follow the law and

01:50:45.782 --> 01:50:48.224
And of course it was understood, I make the law.

01:50:48.825 --> 01:50:51.727
The government makes the law, you've got to follow the law.

01:50:52.408 --> 01:50:59.053
And then he proceeded to put more than a few in prison who were not complying.

01:51:00.974 --> 01:51:02.035
And that was the end of that.

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:06.859
And so that was how he aligned the wealthy people in Russia.

01:51:07.441 --> 01:51:15.990
that were made wealthy because they sold off public goods after the dissolution of the USSR.

01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:19.794
So, you know, all this stuff is going on.

01:51:20.655 --> 01:51:22.076
Geopolitics is fascinating.

01:51:22.136 --> 01:51:30.025
If we really want to try and guess in the next few decades what our life is going to be like, I think the answer is in geopolitical analysis.

01:51:32.918 --> 01:51:38.702
Well, if there was no spreading contagion, then COVID was only geopolitical, right?

01:51:38.782 --> 01:51:40.323
I mean, from my perspective.

01:51:40.963 --> 01:51:42.384
Yeah, I agree.

01:51:44.245 --> 01:51:44.566
I agree.

01:51:44.586 --> 01:51:48.208
It was geopolitical and military.

01:51:50.089 --> 01:51:52.110
Well, gentlemen, on that note, can you just hold on?

01:51:52.151 --> 01:51:57.374
What we're going to do is jump over to our members area, answer a few questions and get back to our evening because

01:51:58.610 --> 01:52:11.282
I am shocked all the way from the Nobel Prize being, you know, used, you know, we had Barack getting the Peace Prize, you know, Nobel Peace Prize, but he killed a lot of people after getting that.

01:52:11.502 --> 01:52:15.646
And also hearing how geopolitically, you know, Dennis,

01:52:16.406 --> 01:52:25.010
Denis, sorry, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this because you basically are laying out to them that Russia, China is our savior.

01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:27.411
And I got to try and learn this.

01:52:27.471 --> 01:52:28.971
I'm not saying I reject them.

01:52:29.371 --> 01:52:30.112
I'm saying I'm going to learn it.

01:52:30.132 --> 01:52:31.512
They're not doing it to save us.

01:52:31.532 --> 01:52:33.193
No, but there could be a path forward.

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:40.076
But the balance they'll create on the planet will give us stability that we'll have more room than we otherwise would have.

01:52:41.573 --> 01:52:41.753
Right.

01:52:41.793 --> 01:52:42.955
They're giving us more of a runway.

01:52:43.737 --> 01:52:52.150
The other effect too is that Russia already is becoming, is taking in the brain drain from the US.

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:54.914
There's more and more people wanting to immigrate to Russia.

01:52:55.697 --> 01:53:00.821
people who want family lives, who want farms, who want things like that.

01:53:01.261 --> 01:53:05.444
You've got more and more YouTube videos of people immigrating to Russia.

01:53:05.985 --> 01:53:14.371
And recently, Russia changed its immigration law to greatly facilitate immigration because it was too much of a headache for people to immigrate.

01:53:14.711 --> 01:53:16.713
So they have now streamlined it

01:53:17.413 --> 01:53:21.716
much more than before to allow this because there was so much demand for it.

01:53:22.237 --> 01:53:23.658
So where the U.S.

01:53:24.158 --> 01:53:32.464
was the center of brain draining talent and resources from the rest of the world, that's also changing now.

01:53:32.524 --> 01:53:33.925
That tide is turning.

01:53:33.945 --> 01:53:35.426
The people who want

01:53:35.906 --> 01:53:48.139
family values who want a greater degree of financial freedom and so they're looking at they're looking to other places i i have a lot of friends who've moved to latin america just to get away from all this

01:53:49.005 --> 01:53:56.370
And so there's people with talent and who are independent thinking, they want to get out of the US and Canada.

01:53:57.971 --> 01:53:59.131
And so there's a lot.

01:53:59.171 --> 01:54:03.894
It's very real that these are the big things that are going to affect our lives.

01:54:04.254 --> 01:54:06.316
When there starts to be competition,

01:54:07.213 --> 01:54:14.655
for real talent, thinking people, scientists, and professionals, they're going to have to treat us well because we'll go elsewhere.

01:54:14.835 --> 01:54:15.555
You see what I'm saying?

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:20.137
And that will make education better.

01:54:20.417 --> 01:54:24.778
It'll make the working conditions of trained people much, much better.

01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:26.518
They'll have more political influence.

01:54:26.558 --> 01:54:28.839
They'll have more say in how things are run.

01:54:29.479 --> 01:54:32.380
And this is what we saw after the Second World War.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:34.621
So this will, in a sense,

01:54:36.804 --> 01:54:53.638
Once we realize that we're not going to win a war against the axis of resistance, against the developing world, and once we stabilize into the notion that we're going to be a great nation developing, I think it'll be better for people.

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.441
It'd be a lot safer, that's for sure.

01:54:58.212 --> 01:55:02.976
It's funny that you mentioned that because I asked a good friend of mine, a vet, somebody who's really, really smart.

01:55:03.677 --> 01:55:05.819
If you had to leave Canada, where would you go?

01:55:06.119 --> 01:55:08.100
Which part of the world would be safe, do you think?

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:08.801
And you said Russia.

01:55:09.281 --> 01:55:12.324
I was surprised to hear that, but not after this episode today.

01:55:13.185 --> 01:55:17.428
Jay, did you have any other comments you want to give to the public before we move over to the members area?

01:55:18.209 --> 01:55:25.335
No, I don't speak Russian or Spanish or Portuguese, so I'm probably staying in America, but yeah, I get it.

01:55:26.676 --> 01:55:28.196
I'm also going to stay in Canada.

01:55:29.597 --> 01:55:37.379
I think we have to stay where we have the most knowledge and connections, where we can have the most influence and do the best we can.

01:55:37.399 --> 01:55:40.879
So I'm going to stay and fight for sure.

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.881
Plus I'm a lot older than you guys, so it's not like I have a lot of time to decide where I'm going to go.

01:55:48.806 --> 01:55:48.986
Yeah.

01:55:49.026 --> 01:55:51.607
My wife's already moved across the world from Nigeria to here.

01:55:51.667 --> 01:55:52.128
That's enough.

01:55:52.208 --> 01:55:53.108
We don't need to move again.

01:55:53.128 --> 01:55:54.269
We're going to stay and fight as well.

01:55:54.369 --> 01:55:54.849
Right, Patch?

01:55:55.529 --> 01:55:55.849
All right.

01:55:56.129 --> 01:55:56.730
So hang on.

01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:58.490
We're just going to jump over to the members area.

01:55:58.510 --> 01:56:00.872
There's a couple of questions and we'll get onto our evening.

01:56:01.332 --> 01:56:02.912
And I don't think Trump had a big effect.

01:56:02.972 --> 01:56:04.093
We got some good numbers tonight.

01:56:04.373 --> 01:56:06.134
So, uh, he tried there, Jay.

01:56:06.194 --> 01:56:06.614
He tried.

01:56:06.634 --> 01:56:07.114
It didn't work.

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:09.516
All right, folks.

01:56:10.036 --> 01:56:11.157
Thank you very much for hanging out with us.

01:56:11.177 --> 01:56:12.198
This is an excellent episode.

01:56:12.218 --> 01:56:13.178
Please share it out.

01:56:13.258 --> 01:56:14.919
There's a lot of good information in here.

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.041
All-cause mortality.

01:56:17.221 --> 01:56:20.924
Apparently, there were borders in COVID.

01:56:21.464 --> 01:56:25.407
Maybe it understood political policies or there was political influence here.

01:56:26.047 --> 01:56:32.472
And I'm really interested in following up a little bit more about what you had to say there, Dini, about geopolitics, Russia.

01:56:33.874 --> 01:56:36.099
China and a few other things that you mentioned there.

01:56:36.439 --> 01:56:38.083
And Jay, it's always a pleasure to have you.

01:56:38.103 --> 01:56:39.045
The audience loves you.

01:56:39.386 --> 01:56:42.934
We love exactly how you will stand and then call a spade a spade.

01:56:44.099 --> 01:56:57.929
I wanted one thing we didn't do which I wanted to do was get into genomics and and and try to attack knowledge and about about PCR and transfection and so we didn't get into that at all.

01:56:58.470 --> 01:57:02.653
So just for that reason, I'd be willing to try again.

01:57:02.833 --> 01:57:05.835
And this time I'll try I'll do my best to just shut up, you know.

01:57:06.832 --> 01:57:07.532
Not a problem.

01:57:07.613 --> 01:57:09.013
And we did that on purpose.

01:57:09.033 --> 01:57:11.115
We'll bring you back and we'll do exactly that.

01:57:11.215 --> 01:57:12.816
So the next episode will be about that.

01:57:12.856 --> 01:57:13.156
Okay.

01:57:13.416 --> 01:57:15.437
If Jay, if Jay is, uh, is up for that.

01:57:15.457 --> 01:57:15.657
Sure.

01:57:15.717 --> 01:57:16.758
I always got time for that.

01:57:17.538 --> 01:57:17.719
Yeah.

01:57:17.759 --> 01:57:20.881
His eyes lit right up as soon as you said that.

01:57:20.941 --> 01:57:22.061
So we'll do exactly that.

01:57:22.121 --> 01:57:23.582
So what we'll do is we'll work behind the scenes.

01:57:23.602 --> 01:57:25.143
We'll find another date for the two of you.

01:57:25.203 --> 01:57:27.685
We'll do a show description and then we'll do exactly that.

01:57:28.045 --> 01:57:28.865
So thank you for that to me.

01:57:29.286 --> 01:57:30.086
I'm reading about it.

01:57:30.106 --> 01:57:30.927
I'm learning about it.

01:57:31.047 --> 01:57:33.948
So I'll be, I'll be a little bit better prepared as well.

01:57:33.988 --> 01:57:34.649
If we do it later.

01:57:35.322 --> 01:57:35.582
Great.

01:57:35.743 --> 01:57:35.943
Yeah.

01:57:36.223 --> 01:57:36.363
Yeah.

01:57:36.383 --> 01:57:38.086
We'll work on some dates that work for both of you.

01:57:38.166 --> 01:57:40.028
We'll get that to happen like three weeks or so.

01:57:40.249 --> 01:57:41.450
We may be able to find some time.

01:57:41.831 --> 01:57:43.073
Plus you're also very busy, Denny.

01:57:43.113 --> 01:57:44.354
You're working on another report.

01:57:44.374 --> 01:57:44.775
I understand.

01:57:46.363 --> 01:57:47.524
All right, public, there you go.

01:57:47.544 --> 01:57:48.805
So we're going to move over to members area.

01:57:48.825 --> 01:57:50.227
We're going to get some Q&A done.

01:57:50.527 --> 01:57:56.072

01:58:11.425 --> 01:58:12.805
Come and join the membership.

01:58:13.205 --> 01:58:16.326
Public, take care of yourself and make sure you share this episode out.

01:58:16.346 --> 01:58:17.767
There's a lot of really good information.

01:58:17.787 --> 01:58:23.328
I'm going to have to watch it again and take some notes and then come back for Part Deux, second part of this one.

01:58:23.588 --> 01:58:24.369
It's your second dose.

01:58:24.749 --> 01:58:27.510
And Denia, I'm looking forward to seeing you in Alberta and Calgary soon.

01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:32.171
So make sure that we'll get that information out about the Injection of Truth Part Deux.

01:58:32.711 --> 01:58:34.152
You're going to be there, Jason?

01:58:34.752 --> 01:58:35.392
I am now.

01:58:35.572 --> 01:58:37.673
Yeah, now that you're there, I'm definitely going to make my way down there.

01:58:37.693 --> 01:58:38.493
But no, I was going to go.

01:58:38.853 --> 01:58:40.934
There's a lot going on in Calgary.

01:58:40.974 --> 01:58:41.954
So I'm going to go and check that out.

01:58:42.034 --> 01:58:43.435
But yeah, I'll come meet you down there, Denis.

01:58:44.295 --> 01:58:45.836
And Pavlik, take care of yourself.

01:58:45.876 --> 01:58:46.596
Take care of your family.

01:58:46.616 --> 01:58:48.277
You shake the hand of a stranger and a neighbor.

01:58:48.357 --> 01:58:50.097
And why do I keep reminding you to do this?

01:58:50.117 --> 01:58:52.158
It's because I love you all very much and God bless.
