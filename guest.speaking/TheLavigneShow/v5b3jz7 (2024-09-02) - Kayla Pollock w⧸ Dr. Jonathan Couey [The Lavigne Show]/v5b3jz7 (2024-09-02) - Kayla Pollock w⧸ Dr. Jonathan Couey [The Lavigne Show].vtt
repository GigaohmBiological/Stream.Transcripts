WEBVTT

00:15.229 --> 00:24.353
You watched us all go to sleep And then you woke, we're just counting cheap But the end is near

01:03.883 --> 01:10.045
Good evening, good evening, good evening, everybody, and welcome to a nice Monday evening here in Breton.

01:10.505 --> 01:15.486
Sun's out, we had a good day, and I'm very happy to be here on this particular episode.

01:15.566 --> 01:19.688
I was excited that Kayla has agreed to come back.

01:20.128 --> 01:21.168
We've been trying to get her on for

01:21.667 --> 01:30.870
little while now, but because of her health ailments and scheduling and my scheduling recruits trial and all that kind of stuff, it's a little bit difficult to align our schedules, but we look like we're good to go.

01:31.010 --> 01:33.011
She's going to be joining us in a little bit.

01:33.691 --> 01:40.013
She did let us know that she's got to deal with a health issue with her nurse and God bless her for that, but she will be joining us.

01:40.474 --> 01:44.215
And we do have a Dr. Jonathan J. Cooey with us today.

01:45.035 --> 01:47.676
And he's a neurobiologist naturalist.

01:47.956 --> 01:50.918
He's also a biology coach, and he's one heck of a person.

01:50.938 --> 01:57.521
If you want to learn what's going on, he's good at describing it, explaining it and providing excellent information.

01:57.921 --> 01:58.981
He's been on a show a few times.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.762
So we had Kyra on.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.183
Kyra, Kyra.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.763
So sorry, I keep getting your name wrong.

02:04.404 --> 02:07.525
And she's also vaccinated, but not necessarily from this stuff.

02:07.885 --> 02:08.886
But she is vaccinated.

02:08.946 --> 02:13.848
And Dr. Cooley or Jonathan was a great help to talk about her elements.

02:14.477 --> 02:19.641
And we're now going to bring him back to talk to Kayla and see no diagnosis.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.323
He's not, he's not her doctor.

02:21.363 --> 02:26.607
He doesn't have her charts or her information, but he certainly has a lot of information about what has been going on.

02:26.707 --> 02:30.810
What's wrong with this so-called Vax and some of the other issues around it.

02:31.090 --> 02:33.292
He's been on a couple of times now sharing information with us.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.635
So without further ado, let me go ahead and bring Jonathan on.

02:38.276 --> 02:38.657
Good evening.

02:38.677 --> 02:39.277
How are you?

02:39.938 --> 02:40.498
Good evening.

02:40.678 --> 02:41.519
I'm I'm all right.

02:41.559 --> 02:43.120
Thank you very much for having me on again.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.001
Good to see you, Jason.

02:44.724 --> 02:45.225
No problem.

02:45.346 --> 02:47.711
And, um, what's the time like for you where you're at?

02:48.453 --> 02:49.195
It's 8 PM.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.160
It's a school night.

02:51.180 --> 02:53.345
So the kids are, are getting in bed.

02:53.666 --> 02:53.947
It's not.

02:55.302 --> 02:57.724
Well, thank you very much then for joining us on your evening.

02:57.784 --> 03:03.407
So you're in the Eastern time zone and you don't know Kayla directly, personally, but you're going to meet her soon.

03:04.067 --> 03:08.110
And you're a little bit familiar with her story, I guess, as we're getting ready for this episode.

03:08.530 --> 03:08.910
I did.

03:09.051 --> 03:09.331
I did.

03:09.391 --> 03:13.513
When I saw her name, then of course, you know, I use the internet to find out what the internet would tell me.

03:13.553 --> 03:15.294
And so I know that she's vaccine injured from 2022.

03:15.334 --> 03:15.675
And I know that.

03:17.896 --> 03:24.978
And at least at one point, they were describing it as quadriplegia, which is or near quadriplegia, which sounds awful.

03:26.578 --> 03:36.241
And I guess more recently now, I'm told they're describing it as transverse myelitis, or at least that's what they're describing the cause of her near quadriplegic.

03:37.001 --> 03:38.882
It's it sounds tragic.

03:41.277 --> 03:43.259
Well, let's go ahead and play a video that she provided.

03:43.279 --> 03:53.967
This just came out a couple of days ago, and this will give us all, the audience as well, a bit of a update on what she's been dealing with, including the struggles of obtaining healthcare here in Canada.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.589
Before you scroll, stop and listen to this.

03:57.109 --> 04:00.152
I was 35 years old when I became paralyzed by my Moderna shot.

04:00.632 --> 04:06.597
This has been confirmed by doctors, both in writing in my documents from the hospital and in an audio recording with my neurologist.

04:06.957 --> 04:10.420
I had the first lawsuit in North America for $45 million against Moderna.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.821
Yet this is not being told.

04:12.041 --> 04:19.704
The mainstream media cannot and will not ever tell you these things because they are paid by the drug manufacturers for their commercials telling you to go get vaccinated when this can happen to you.

04:20.065 --> 04:20.625
I was healthy.

04:20.865 --> 04:21.545
I was doing well.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.166
I was doing things like a normal person.

04:23.426 --> 04:24.907
I have a son who was seven at the time.

04:25.247 --> 04:27.368
I worked at a school for York Region District School Board.

04:27.708 --> 04:28.529
I now have no job.

04:28.889 --> 04:30.049
I have no bowel function.

04:30.290 --> 04:31.270
I have no bladder function.

04:31.510 --> 04:33.991
I have no movement below the waist and I have limited arm function.

04:34.271 --> 04:35.292
That means I'm stuck in a wheelchair.

04:36.064 --> 04:39.705
I'm stuck in my bed, I feel lots of pain, and they offer me medical assistance in dying.

04:39.945 --> 04:43.126
In other words, in Canada, they told me it's better to die because we don't have treatment.

04:43.346 --> 04:44.406
I was offered this three times.

04:44.726 --> 04:47.007
You don't mess with a mom whose son has been taken away.

04:47.307 --> 04:48.907
No, CAS didn't come and take away my son.

04:49.108 --> 04:58.070
He had to go live with his father because I had to move somewhere where my big clunky wheelchair that's like this and big and huge and has all these buttons on it and can't fit into my three-bedroom

04:58.510 --> 05:02.573
their three-bathroom, three-story house, I had to move away from my little son.

05:03.033 --> 05:03.814
So I don't get to see him.

05:04.154 --> 05:05.915
Only three times in the summer for weeks.

05:06.275 --> 05:07.396
And his dad and I get along great.

05:07.816 --> 05:08.797
This is a big problem.

05:08.977 --> 05:09.698
This could have been you.

05:10.018 --> 05:10.999
Canada will do this to you.

05:11.339 --> 05:17.903
If you keep getting your shots and you don't help people that have been vaccine-injured and the vaccine-injured don't step up and talk together, this will not get better.

05:18.144 --> 05:18.804
It is a crisis.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.085
It is a healthcare crisis.

05:20.305 --> 05:21.746
There are people dying all around.

05:21.966 --> 05:25.909
They want to send me to long-term care or tell me to kill myself with medical assistance and dying.

05:26.579 --> 05:28.421
I don't want to die, but I also don't want to live like this.

05:28.742 --> 05:34.408
If you can help, go to www.opkayla.ca and find all the information on my case and much more.

05:34.428 --> 05:37.091
What a brave woman.

05:37.672 --> 05:38.453
What a strong woman.

05:39.754 --> 05:40.255
Well, here they go.

05:40.275 --> 05:41.596
There's a quick little update.

05:41.957 --> 05:43.398
Three times she was offered assistance.

05:44.350 --> 05:47.571
and dying here in Canada, which is government funded suicide.

05:49.251 --> 05:56.213
She had to let her son go live with the father for a bit because her accommodations do not accommodate her equipment that she needs.

05:56.613 --> 05:59.214
So she needed to be too far away from her son where he was going to school.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.354
She's obviously suffering.

06:01.414 --> 06:02.455
She's in pain all the time.

06:03.535 --> 06:05.876
She was just on Viva Frye today talking about this as well.

06:06.656 --> 06:10.797
And, oh geez, Jonathan Lake, where do we start on this one?

06:11.616 --> 06:14.238
we start with the transverse myelitisis?

06:14.278 --> 06:15.499
How do you say that?

06:15.659 --> 06:36.653
I mean, I think you start a little higher and just realize that as far as we understand the molecular mechanisms of these kinds of, this suite of diseases, which also I believe, as far as I bet, I'm not an MD, I'm a PhD, but I was a neurobiologist, so at least from the perspective of having read this literature before, I'm pretty sure that in the same

06:37.560 --> 06:42.243
kind of general idea here is that the myelin is being damaged in the spinal cord.

06:42.283 --> 06:49.567
And that's not necessarily the exact same thing that happens in MS, but it's not dissimilar.

06:50.407 --> 06:59.853
Also a disease of the myelin damaging the insulating sheath of neurons in the brain or in the spinal cord or in the periphery.

07:00.566 --> 07:13.457
And so anytime that you disrupt the speed of transmission or the reliability of transmission, then you interrupt motor control, you can interrupt breathing, you can interrupt digestion, you can interrupt control of the bowel.

07:14.097 --> 07:15.218
I mean, the list is endless.

07:15.258 --> 07:24.086
And I'm sure that the main thing to see here is that this is most likely due to an autoimmune reaction, because we already understand MS to be an

07:24.830 --> 07:26.851
the body attacking its own myelin.

07:26.891 --> 07:32.375
And we don't necessarily know how many different ways this kind of autoimmunity can be generated.

07:32.435 --> 07:34.816
Some of it can be pretty well understood.

07:34.896 --> 07:38.538
Others of it could be once in a blue moon, it happens in this way.

07:39.639 --> 07:50.065
But with regard to the application of these recent transfections, every one of these shots that actively transfected her,

07:52.742 --> 08:11.486
To kind of go back a little bit, I would just say that since the last time I was on your show, one of the things that has sort of bubbled to the top of my understanding list that no one else seems willing to factor in is that one of the best ways for them to have avoided

08:12.412 --> 08:19.735
large-scale adverse effects to the vaccine would have been a serious number of these to have been placebo.

08:20.135 --> 08:23.436
And there's a couple really huge benefits to that.

08:23.696 --> 08:27.438
One is that they can meet almost any manufacturing target if they're allowed

08:28.098 --> 08:29.099
to ship placebo.

08:29.540 --> 08:40.134
And number two, if they keep track of it well, then they really only have to watch a very small number of lots or a very small number of sub lots, because they know those are the ones that are hot.

08:40.194 --> 08:43.017
And it also makes it very much easier for them to segregate

08:43.638 --> 08:55.781
different concentrations or different formulations from one another if they know that this hot lot is segregated in this community because it is completely surrounded by communities that are going to get placebo.

08:55.821 --> 09:05.924
Now, I'm not saying I have any data on that or whatever, but I think it's much more likely that pharmaceutical companies and governments would have seen that as a foolproof plan

09:06.604 --> 09:18.633
whereas these stories about various hot lots and more dangerous or less dangerous lots seems to me to be a sort of a way to

09:19.793 --> 09:42.671
to cover up what should be very well-planned malfeasance with some kind of what appears to be just kind of ham-fisted distribution and lack of quality control or some other things that can kind of be blamed on incompetence and human error, rather than realizing that in light of the fact that they've never produced

09:43.351 --> 09:53.317
a pharmaceutical product on this scale in this many places with this sort of distribution goal, it just seems like the lowest hanging fruit.

09:53.337 --> 09:59.441
And then this would explain why Kayla would have been able to get to her third, I guess it was her third

09:59.881 --> 10:21.053
it's the first booster you know before she had a really bad reaction because the first two kind of either maybe one was a placebo or um she just you know what for whatever reason got lucky and the first or second transfections were not um because it is possible that to inject a lipid nanoparticle and have

10:21.633 --> 10:28.117
You know, the luck of the drawbree, the majority of it is excreted or removed by the liver before it ever does anything meaningful.

10:28.638 --> 10:31.820
And the places where it does something meaningful, your body is able to ignore it.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.902
It's possible that lots of people could get lucky.

10:34.942 --> 10:40.945
It's possible that people with an extraordinary amount of extra fat could get luckier than people who have no fat.

10:42.006 --> 10:45.848
At this stage, it's all up for grabs, because a lot of people haven't been thinking about it.

10:45.868 --> 11:10.077
But this could be one of the easiest explanations for why pro athletes are having a higher proportion of bad reactions to the transfection, simply because it's more likely to hit tissue, which is vital, and more likely for them to sense it, as opposed to somebody who is maybe 40% body fat and morbidly obese in America.

11:11.217 --> 11:29.005
So there's a, I think there are so many variables here which are, which have been played against us to cover up the fact that there should be probably are number one, as I've heard Kayla say in her video, there are a lot more people than the governments are acknowledging with these side effects.

11:29.045 --> 11:34.328
But I would go even farther to say that there are lots of people with side effects that aren't as easy to describe

11:35.048 --> 11:51.155
as transverse myelitis, that are probably also suffering from consequences of these transfections, and because they're more rare, or because they haven't been described, or because their doctors have never heard them described, their suite of symptoms is just being ignored.

11:51.215 --> 11:56.017
And this is part of the, you know, probably years to come, we're still going to be

11:56.980 --> 11:59.601
peeling back this onion and finding rotten pieces.

11:59.681 --> 12:00.362
It's not good.

12:02.003 --> 12:04.024
I mean, I don't have a very good outlook.

12:04.084 --> 12:06.205
I think this is really, especially if,

12:07.205 --> 12:29.933
There are people in all the countries in the West still taking these and they are still rolling out lots with intact lipid nanoparticles and very good RNA that I do think that these problems will continue to surface and exacerbate and also the diversity of reports is going to continue.

12:29.973 --> 12:31.334
Remember, if we turn back time,

12:32.208 --> 12:37.654
even two years ago, the vast majority of people were just talking about heart problems and maybe some clots.

12:38.115 --> 12:40.257
And now we're talking about transverse myelitis.

12:40.297 --> 12:42.820
And before you know it, that'll be accepted.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.582
Yeah, lots of those people got that too.

12:44.602 --> 12:46.304
And then there will be another one on top of that.

12:46.344 --> 12:51.450
And that's probably how this is going to go for some time, unfortunately.

12:52.634 --> 12:54.035
And they normalize it too.

12:54.215 --> 12:57.858
So they will be trying to gaslight and convince us that, no, this has always been a thing all the time.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.920
We've always had high school students dropping dead.

13:00.441 --> 13:00.741
Yeah.

13:00.801 --> 13:00.901
Yeah.

13:00.981 --> 13:01.281
Right.

13:01.301 --> 13:04.564
Cancer, cancer in your second year of college is normal now.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.128
I mean, and that, that, that, that's where I do really think this is headed.

13:09.188 --> 13:17.495
I don't think there's an infinite number of possibilities because eventually, you know, I mean, I don't think they're going to go through everybody.

13:17.615 --> 13:18.896
Eventually they're going to go through everybody.

13:20.899 --> 13:21.099
Yeah.

13:21.159 --> 13:26.622
And, and I think also the idea that the contrast between the, I think it's already happening.

13:26.662 --> 13:41.591
It's just that they still have such a stranglehold on our consciousness with this social media, that people aren't realizing that there is a stark contrast between the untransfected people and their general health and the people who have multiply taken a shot.

13:42.211 --> 13:43.632
These people aren't healthy anymore.

13:44.133 --> 13:50.398
They're complaining about whatever, and then they might not attribute it to the shot at all, which is really the most extraordinary part.

13:50.858 --> 13:52.119
Oh, I've never been so tired.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.340
Oh, I get sick all the time.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.461
I've got allergies now.

13:54.861 --> 14:04.728
The list is endless, and none of them are even remotely close to considering the possibility that what have I changed in my life besides these five shots?

14:04.788 --> 14:11.033
And do you think these five shots are significant since three of them are for COVID, but two of them were for shingles and pneumonia?

14:11.733 --> 14:13.173
And that's the frightening part.

14:13.233 --> 14:16.554
I mean, I don't think my grandmother ever had a vaccine.

14:17.715 --> 14:19.395
Well, they're programmed in such a way.

14:19.415 --> 14:20.596
They're going, what could be wrong with me?

14:20.656 --> 14:22.336
I've done everything I was told to.

14:23.056 --> 14:26.417
So they don't see that as a negative because they did what they were told to.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.738
So it's the power of social media.

14:29.358 --> 14:30.639
It's the power of social media.

14:30.659 --> 14:33.920
They've never been able to convince people so thoroughly as they have now.

14:34.840 --> 14:39.741
I had a very strange sort of reason to go to the doctor.

14:39.781 --> 14:40.742
I have this small,

14:41.502 --> 14:48.787
persistent eczema on my leg and it got infected like cellulitis and that can be kind of scary.

14:49.487 --> 14:54.410
But I don't have a doctor or insurance anymore since I was fired and that's a long story.

14:54.871 --> 15:00.835
So I just had to go to one of these local clinics and get medication.

15:01.015 --> 15:06.098
And it's extraordinary to me when you get there,

15:08.038 --> 15:33.156
they have signs up on the wall and in the waiting room and also in the actual examination room on the mirror are really obvious stickers which are essentially discouraging you from asking for antibiotics because antibiotics don't work for viruses, because antibiotics can create superbacteria, because antibiotics can be overused and that's very dangerous so don't.

15:33.756 --> 15:48.101
assume you're going to get antibiotics because you're sick and don't ask for them, because if you ask for them, you're less likely to get them, which I find a really weird thing to say on a thing in a medical situation.

15:49.001 --> 15:50.282
I found it very strange.

15:51.782 --> 16:01.406
And anyway, I got antibiotics and that's all fine, but I found it strange because I do really think the sort of

16:02.483 --> 16:10.268
extent to which everyone, everyone has accepted the reality of where we are and what we're doing.

16:10.308 --> 16:17.893
The doctor that examined me had a very hardcore mask on that had steel, you know, shaping things here.

16:17.913 --> 16:20.195
It looks like he was working on asbestos.

16:21.096 --> 16:28.941
And he was asking me, you know, I was trying to tell him this is only the second time I've been to the doctor in my whole adult life because it's the same stupid eczema and the same kind of

16:29.767 --> 16:48.678
infection if I if I you know mess with it the wrong way and it's frustrating because you know other than that I'm totally healthy I don't have any cavities and he was just kind of confused he's like well then you don't want to come here it's like you shouldn't you don't want to come here I'm you need to get antibiotics and you don't want to come back here

16:50.208 --> 16:54.732
And I couldn't really understand how he was, he was really serious though.

16:54.773 --> 16:56.494
He was impressed that I was so healthy.

16:57.135 --> 16:59.657
He was sure that I, you know, needed antibiotics.

17:01.239 --> 17:03.961
But he was also like, yeah, you don't want to, you don't want to come here.

17:04.342 --> 17:13.170
And it was, I really felt like he was scared, you know, like he had never seen, you know, I didn't ask him.

17:14.062 --> 17:16.604
But my feeling was, is that he was really serious.

17:16.744 --> 17:22.830
You know, I don't, I think I see a lot of sick people and I don't know why you would ever, you definitely don't want to hang around here.

17:22.850 --> 17:25.172
And it really felt that way.

17:25.272 --> 17:30.997
And I do really think that's what's going on because in the waiting room of that place, there are people wearing masks.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.198
They feel terrible.

17:32.278 --> 17:33.099
They're very sick.

17:33.579 --> 17:34.620
They look terrible.

17:35.441 --> 17:38.844
The person that's with them is like consoling them and they look terrible.

17:39.825 --> 17:39.945
Um,

17:41.894 --> 17:42.154
I don't know.

17:42.174 --> 17:43.335
Did you have to wear a mask there?

17:43.875 --> 17:44.055
No.

17:44.936 --> 17:50.219
But I did get asked if I was up to date on my tetanus shot, if I'd had my flu shot, if I wanted my COVID shot.

17:50.260 --> 17:58.725
Then when I went to go to the pharmacy up the street to get my antibiotics, then I was again offered a flu shot and a COVID shot.

17:58.785 --> 18:03.028
And they even said that after your antibiotics done, you can come back here for your

18:03.308 --> 18:04.749
flu and your COVID shot.

18:05.290 --> 18:15.240
And I find that extraordinary really, because, you know, they say it with very much enthusiasm and very much like if you had to say, thank you for shopping at, you know,

18:16.107 --> 18:17.268
Burger King, can I help you?

18:17.328 --> 18:19.750
Like it was really a thing where they needed to say it.

18:19.790 --> 18:24.533
They said it to every person while I was waiting in line for the prescription to be filled.

18:24.593 --> 18:26.114
Like they were saying it to everyone.

18:26.234 --> 18:32.899
And it was very extraordinary to me because it puts people into a very interesting pressure situation.

18:32.959 --> 18:40.284
If there's people waiting in line and a couple other people sitting on a chair waiting, and then the lady says, you know, okay, what's your last name?

18:40.324 --> 18:43.427
And then she said, so do you need a COVID or a flu shot?

18:44.400 --> 18:48.367
And you're saying that, and I don't feel any pressure, but I think a lot of other people do.

18:48.808 --> 18:50.050
I saw a lot of people that are...

18:50.831 --> 18:57.316
You know, there's a lot of older people that are less comfortable in public and it puts a really weird situation.

18:57.356 --> 19:02.741
And the lady behind the counter had this cloth mask on and she was coughing and you could feel all this stuff moving.

19:03.582 --> 19:06.544
And the guy, one of the guys said, oh wow, it sounds like you're kind of sick.

19:07.085 --> 19:09.827
And she said, oh no, it's just my mask and my cats.

19:10.307 --> 19:12.529
She said, the real people who are sick are coming in here.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.830
They should be in the drive-through.

19:13.870 --> 19:16.493
So she was coughing, sounded awful.

19:17.216 --> 19:19.416
but blamed it all on her mask and her cats.

19:20.097 --> 19:30.719
But she simultaneously was able to say to this guy that what pissed her off is that people who were sick came into CVS without a mask on when they should use the drive-thru, because that's what it's for.

19:30.779 --> 19:32.459
And it was like, wow.

19:32.539 --> 19:41.941
I mean, it's so deep, like they are really so deep in it that, you know, it is four or five assumptions deep.

19:42.101 --> 19:46.402
And that's what really frustrates me about how far we've come is that

19:47.022 --> 19:51.405
You know, I don't know how to throw a lifeline to some of these people.

19:51.425 --> 19:56.609
How do you lower a ladder that far and get people to start climbing?

19:56.669 --> 20:00.112
That's the hard part because it's tough.

20:00.472 --> 20:08.719
I mean, unless you've got a story like Kayla, that can help because, you know, then people are a little bit more disarmed because it's, you know,

20:09.935 --> 20:18.160
For me, trying to teach them that the biology that's on TV is wrong, is a little more abstract and difficult.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.403
And that's why I think people like her are very important and all of them are very important, potentially.

20:23.463 --> 20:32.047
But it becomes this thing where... It's a fine line.

20:32.147 --> 20:38.011
Every one of these people needs to be careful about how they are potentially exploited and very much...

20:39.602 --> 20:49.725
I think to a certain extent, I know from four years of doing it, that it does put you and yourself in a different position than you would be if you just kept your mouth shut or if you tried to do it less publicly.

20:49.745 --> 21:01.569
And also, I know that the way that social media works, you can get a lot of the downsides without a lot of the positive sides because of the way that it can be programmed against you.

21:02.734 --> 21:03.215
It's tricky.

21:03.275 --> 21:05.578
I guess she's been working at it for a while now, though.

21:05.598 --> 21:12.107
If she's been in the newspapers since 2022, then she's already paid a price and then some, probably.

21:12.548 --> 21:12.868
I don't know.

21:12.928 --> 21:16.734
I mean, it can't be worse than what the transfection did to her.

21:17.848 --> 21:26.633
No, she's been struggling quite a bit, getting the awareness out there, getting the support, having to raise funds on her own to get things like transportation addressed.

21:26.913 --> 21:33.457
And now she's working on modifying her home in order to accommodate her son and her equipment.

21:33.937 --> 21:35.218
She, she's been struggling quite a bit.

21:35.898 --> 21:38.700
Um, before we, Oh, sorry.

21:38.720 --> 21:42.662
I was going to ask you, is there anything in, in Canadian law that kind of, um,

21:45.267 --> 22:08.861
puts a ceiling on a single person's value because I think there's a lot of, there's a, there's at least some legal precedents in America where there's a certain value and I don't remember what it is, but it ain't very high, um, where, you know, you kind of max out if a person is sort of unable to work anymore, then there's a certain value of a person and

22:10.293 --> 22:12.875
I think they've worked that out in a couple different scenarios.

22:12.955 --> 22:22.743
And so it's not, you know, 2 million, it might be $2 million or something like that, but it, I don't, I don't know that you can sue for infinite damages anymore in most contexts in America.

22:22.803 --> 22:23.183
I don't know.

22:23.203 --> 22:28.888
I I'm, I'm definitely not a lawyer, but is there anything like that in, in Canadian law?

22:28.948 --> 22:30.189
I thought I just heard of $45 million.

22:30.929 --> 22:31.470
That seems like a.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.286
That's good.

22:34.406 --> 22:35.307
Like go get it.

22:35.927 --> 22:42.990
Um, I don't know of a limit like that and certainly something to look into, but in Canada we have maids, which is medical assistance in dying.

22:43.590 --> 22:45.111
So they do offer that pretty quick.

22:45.151 --> 22:49.193
And that could be similar to a response, uh, to what you're talking about.

22:49.713 --> 22:52.034
Maybe they've gone, well, we've gone too far with this person.

22:52.094 --> 22:53.074
Can't go much further.

22:53.094 --> 22:55.916
There's nothing much to do other than offer them death.

22:56.296 --> 22:58.016
I don't know if there's an actual number.

22:58.257 --> 22:59.177
I'd have to look into that.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.071
But I would be devastated to find out if there was.

23:02.451 --> 23:05.773
But we, of course... How does that work?

23:05.833 --> 23:10.097
Who's the doctor that decides whether to offer that to her?

23:10.157 --> 23:21.065
Because to me, it seems as though, from the perspective of what I remember the Hippocratic Oath to be, that's not exactly encouraging a person to live.

23:21.225 --> 23:27.490
You could even say that to a mentally vulnerable person, that could push them over the edge to dying.

23:28.613 --> 23:35.159
Um, if you kind of give them no hope, um, sometimes people have report.

23:35.619 --> 23:37.461
The only thing that kept them alive was hope.

23:38.201 --> 23:41.524
Hope is placebo in some scenarios.

23:41.644 --> 23:43.886
Like how is it any different than placebo?

23:44.847 --> 23:46.889
Um, to me that that's.

23:49.758 --> 23:54.801
I try to think about it from the perspective of a doctor coming in and say that you have three months to live and he's lying.

23:54.841 --> 24:00.824
There's a certain set, there's a certain number of people who will have a physical effect from that.

24:01.504 --> 24:16.672
And it will be, you know, if you tell them that they're going to get sick and it's going to be painful and they have three months to live and they believe their doctor that can actually, I don't know if they'll actually die in three months, but they can get very sick from that worry from that belief.

24:17.543 --> 24:27.791
And so to me, offering someone maids is not that dissimilar to putting them in a possibility space that's not good for their brain.

24:27.871 --> 24:29.112
It's not good for their healing.

24:29.192 --> 24:31.554
It's not good for their chances.

24:31.734 --> 24:33.295
I just find it really sinister.

24:33.536 --> 24:35.317
And I don't know how else to say it.

24:35.417 --> 24:36.498
I find it very sinister.

24:37.495 --> 24:44.863
Well, when, when Kayla comes on, I'm sure she'll share this portion of her story with you, but early on, she was told it's just in your head.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.745
There's no physical response.

24:46.805 --> 24:49.328
You're you're quadriplegic because of a mental issue.

24:49.881 --> 24:54.623
And she was very pleased to hear that because she thought we just need to work on the mental issue and then I could walk again.

24:55.123 --> 25:03.807
So she, you know, went with the program and then we found, or she found out, and she'll share this as well, that there was a window of opportunity when it could have been addressed.

25:03.967 --> 25:10.030
So she wasn't permanently paralyzed, but that window closed as she was dealing with this mental version of it.

25:10.510 --> 25:20.099
Whether that was planned or not, she waited out this window and she'll get into these details where she could have had some sort of recovery, but now she's beyond that.

25:20.799 --> 25:26.344
And of course the response to that was maids and two more times she was offered maids.

25:26.485 --> 25:29.347
She keeps turning it down because she doesn't want to die as you heard in her video.

25:30.628 --> 25:35.533
But yeah, this is where they've been pushing her the entire time.

25:35.553 --> 25:35.713
Wow.

25:37.859 --> 25:41.720
And it could be because she's very bad for the narrative, like for her living.

25:42.220 --> 25:44.961
Just like we talked a little bit earlier, this is exactly what we need.

25:44.981 --> 25:47.642
We need people like her coming out to tell the story, to wake other people up.

25:48.002 --> 25:50.442
Cause she gladly took the first two backs shots.

25:50.462 --> 25:53.243
She was doing her, her contribution and contributing the teacher.

25:53.263 --> 25:55.604
Uh, she thought she was doing all the right things.

25:56.184 --> 25:59.825
And then when the system got her, the third one, she had a response to it.

25:59.965 --> 26:01.785
Now she's learning what the system is really about.

26:01.805 --> 26:03.526
They didn't care about helping her.

26:04.076 --> 26:05.777
They wanted to get rid of her voice.

26:06.478 --> 26:09.079
So there's a lot of good people behind her fighting for her.

26:09.339 --> 26:18.485
So Veterans for Freedom is an organization here in Canada that are doing exactly that because we don't have a lot of the support when it comes to legal like the Americans have.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.607
There's no lawyer that's touching this.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.928
It's so difficult to get a lawyer to touch this.

26:23.048 --> 26:28.151
I believe she found one now for a lawsuit against Mondera, but I always say that wrong.

26:29.272 --> 26:30.053
There we go.

26:30.573 --> 26:34.235
Um, but it's very difficult, very difficult to get even legal assistance.

26:34.495 --> 26:39.238
Uh, if your employer got you to get the bags, you got injured, you're getting no help here in Canada.

26:40.179 --> 26:40.559
Wow.

26:40.659 --> 26:41.340
I didn't know that.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.921
Well, that sucks for you guys.

26:42.981 --> 26:43.661
Holy cow.

26:43.981 --> 26:45.522
Um, I did not know that.

26:46.243 --> 26:46.703
Uh, oh yeah.

26:47.788 --> 26:52.930
And that's what our last interview was like, as we're telling you the Canadian healthcare system and how it works.

26:53.471 --> 26:56.932
It's like, wow, like you wouldn't tolerate that in the States.

26:56.972 --> 26:59.713
You guys, you guys would have addressed that issue pretty quickly.

26:59.793 --> 27:11.779
But when the NIH under Fauci writes a report or response to Canada's maids system and says that that's inhumane, you shouldn't be doing that.

27:12.380 --> 27:22.616
Because we were also talking about bringing in mature minors, so a minor can make the decision for maids, and also to end the life of mentally ill people.

27:23.962 --> 27:30.209
with the requirement that the health care provider or the person that's taking care of them makes a decision.

27:30.269 --> 27:36.956
So dementia and other mental illnesses, which you could argue the patient is not in pain, the caregiver is the one in pain.

27:37.457 --> 27:41.881
Now we're looking at adding that to the list of things that allow you to be qualified for maids.

27:42.382 --> 27:43.623
So that means caregivers.

27:44.332 --> 27:48.936
when they're decided it's over, that could be a way to end life here in Canada.

27:49.176 --> 27:50.777
That particular portion hasn't passed yet.

27:50.797 --> 27:53.640
There's been a lot of pushback from, from Canadians on that one.

27:53.660 --> 28:00.105
Cause you're dealing with mentally ill people and minors, but it's been tabled and they're trying to get that one passed.

28:02.387 --> 28:02.627
Yeah.

28:02.647 --> 28:02.887
Wow.

28:02.907 --> 28:03.228
I don't know.

28:03.508 --> 28:04.269
I don't know what to say.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.611
I know the Netherlands is pretty far down this road too.

28:08.112 --> 28:11.214
Um, I just, I, I don't know.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.055
I don't know what to say.

28:12.695 --> 28:13.216
I'm yeah.

28:17.935 --> 28:19.177
I'm definitely not for it.

28:19.217 --> 28:21.379
I don't think it's something even Fauci's not for it.

28:21.759 --> 28:23.681
Even Fauci's administration is not for it.

28:23.701 --> 28:24.902
They said, Canada, don't do that.

28:25.302 --> 28:27.224
You should be providing end of life care.

28:27.304 --> 28:31.348
You should be providing care, not ending care and ending life.

28:32.003 --> 28:38.166
So when Fauci's department says that's too evil, it's very evil at that point, that's for sure.

28:39.546 --> 28:41.087
Placebos, you mentioned placebos.

28:41.227 --> 28:45.429
There might've been a way to kind of experiment almost, it sounded like, to do this.

28:45.829 --> 28:52.972
Have they ever done that before where they rolled out something and it was active and placebo and like, what are you referring to?

28:53.572 --> 28:55.873
That's the gold standard, right?

28:55.933 --> 28:57.054
Is that the randomized,

28:57.870 --> 28:59.471
double blind control trial.

28:59.531 --> 29:04.913
Double blind means that there's placebo and all the people that are working don't know whether they're hot or not.

29:05.893 --> 29:06.974
So that's how you do it.

29:07.334 --> 29:13.797
So in this scenario, that would be the way that everybody would also have, you know, plausible deniability.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.478
I don't know what I was doing.

29:15.518 --> 29:16.378
I don't know what I had.

29:16.418 --> 29:17.959
I was just doing what I was told.

29:18.019 --> 29:19.579
I put it, I followed the directions.

29:20.380 --> 29:23.021
And if the vast majority, I mean, think about how

29:24.369 --> 29:40.608
To me, that's the very first thing that struck me as incredibly odd, was that I just kind of assumed that if they really rolled it out, that we were going to see massive problems, and it wouldn't take more than a half a year before I wouldn't even need to say anything.

29:40.968 --> 29:42.209
And yet it didn't happen.

29:43.331 --> 29:48.094
people who told me they didn't feel a thing and then it dawned on me, oh my gosh, they're gonna lie to us.

29:48.174 --> 29:50.395
I mean, how else are they gonna make a billion doses?

29:50.455 --> 29:56.699
How else would they be so, I mean, they even released press statements and stuff.

29:56.779 --> 30:01.862
Oh yeah, you know, the guy from Moderna even came back from a meeting and said, we're gonna make a billion doses.

30:01.902 --> 30:10.527
Well, the only way that you would say that is not because you were confident in your manufacturing or your ability to scale up manufacturing of a novel,

30:11.297 --> 30:18.000
you know, lipid nanoparticle preparation, but because you knew that you didn't really have to scale up your manufacturing to meet that.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.221
You were going to get allowed to be a placebo.

30:20.882 --> 30:38.030
And that really, I think that there's absolutely no question that that also then makes it very sensible why they would have had people wittingly or unwittingly come out and claim to have a signal about hot lots.

30:39.229 --> 30:48.895
And it could even be possible that this hot lot signal is actually a signal of placebo, but I don't think that's what any of them are arguing.

30:48.955 --> 31:00.261
And so for me, it's still exceedingly odd that I'm the only one who mentions it and I've been mentioning it for a couple of years now, but nobody wants to consider it.

31:00.321 --> 31:06.385
And I think it's the easiest, most obvious way that you could do a very, very,

31:07.385 --> 31:35.608
controlled and easy to keep track of evaluation of these products because you would use placebo to geographically isolate all of your tests without anybody know that they were participating and the vast majority of the people would get placebo and therefore at least in certain rounds there would be no way for anybody to take a adverse reaction seriously because it's so exceedingly rare that even Paul Offit sounds like he's very reasonable.

31:36.497 --> 31:52.940
And indeed, when most doctors were to reveal what happened or look at what happened in their doctor's office, it'll seem like to them that that's what happened, because I think a vast majority of them, at least, I think a vast majority of them were placebo.

31:53.280 --> 31:57.861
And many of them might have been various formulations and the ones that, you know, I don't know.

31:57.961 --> 32:04.943
I just know that there's no other way to explain why we had, we have so few reactions in the first two shots.

32:05.868 --> 32:08.990
and that the reaction started in the third and the fourth shots.

32:10.792 --> 32:14.694
I think that that just explains it because otherwise it should have been in the second shot.

32:15.615 --> 32:20.699
And the people that got it in the second shot are the ones that I'm sure got hot shot both times.

32:22.071 --> 32:28.276
I apologize if it was you who mentioned this, but I do speak to so many doctors on this subject that I sometimes forget who.

32:28.937 --> 32:31.259
But somebody mentioned that that was the fourth shot.

32:31.339 --> 32:36.744
So at the fourth shot is when the body starts to produce spike protein and shedding spike protein.

32:36.784 --> 32:41.588
And it seems to be where the body has had enough of these shots and it starts to produce this stuff.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.330
Was that you or are you familiar with that?

32:44.530 --> 32:45.011
I don't know.

32:45.071 --> 32:48.153
I mean, if you if you think the cartoon is right,

32:48.954 --> 32:59.739
and you think every shot is hot, then on the first shot, you should, in theory, if you've never been infected or whatever they say, and you have no antibodies, then you don't have antibodies for the first shot.

33:00.280 --> 33:11.565
The second shot, when your body produces spike protein, in theory, what Paul Offit would say is that you wouldn't even be able to detect spike protein because your body would clean it up so fast because you already have antibodies to it.

33:11.725 --> 33:14.647
But what that also means is that your body would react

33:15.327 --> 33:18.270
immunogenically, meaning that you would have an antibody reaction.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.853
If that means that you get transfected in your aorta,

33:22.725 --> 33:34.731
and the aorta starts expressing spike protein, and then the antibodies deposit there, and then your immune system kills all the cells of your aorta, and you have a massive rupture of your aorta, then the second shot will kill you.

33:35.211 --> 33:38.393
But the first shot couldn't have killed you because you didn't have any antibodies.

33:38.453 --> 33:43.955
Even if it transfected your aorta, your aorta wouldn't get destroyed right away.

33:44.155 --> 33:45.876
And that would be the argument.

33:45.916 --> 33:46.897
It would get inflamed.

33:48.707 --> 33:52.829
but it wouldn't be destroyed before the protein would cycle out or gone.

33:52.849 --> 34:06.074
I mean, people have all their explanations, but Sukrit Bhakti is the one who came to this explanation, the clearest and the earliest, and it's right from the perspective of him getting it, because he's the guy who discovered the complement system.

34:06.575 --> 34:17.159
And his main argument was, is that wherever this foreign protein is produced and displayed on the membrane, or displayed in HLA molecules,

34:17.799 --> 34:27.781
you're going to have the possibility of the immune system finding it either through cytotoxic T cells or through antibodies that are specific for it or overlapping specificity with it.

34:27.962 --> 34:41.685
And so if the spike protein, for example, has overlapping specificity with antibodies that are for other things in your blood, then from the first shot, you could, in theory, already have an immune reaction that could result in inflammation, fever,

34:43.211 --> 34:49.697
and potentially bleeding or wherever you have this cytotoxic reaction to the production of the protein.

34:49.737 --> 34:57.624
But again, it's tricky because there's also the possibility that you build tolerance to the spike protein.

34:57.664 --> 35:04.210
And so that the first couple of times you produce the spike protein, your immune system is getting rid of it, cleaning it up.

35:04.370 --> 35:04.650
And so

35:05.191 --> 35:09.817
If you look for the spike protein, if you test for it in your blood, you're not going to really find it.

35:10.358 --> 35:19.771
But then after your body may convert to, some people are saying it converts to IgG4 or something like IgG4, which is an antibody that doesn't really bind things very well.

35:20.376 --> 35:21.476
It just does other stuff.

35:21.536 --> 35:24.457
And so then essentially you build tolerance to it.

35:24.497 --> 35:38.640
And so now you could have, as you said, spike protein floating around because instead of your body cleaning it up actively with spike protein antibodies or antibodies that are removing it or cells and macrophages that are removing it, they're starting to ignore it.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.000
And if that's the case, then you might be right.

35:41.060 --> 35:47.362
In the fourth transfection, you might start shedding spike protein because your body is tolerating the production of it.

35:47.402 --> 35:47.642
And so

35:48.550 --> 36:03.337
I think the most important thing about that possibility is to understand that as a complication on top of a complication, which from the very beginning of the pandemic was portrayed to us as being ridiculous.

36:03.897 --> 36:13.681
they said that they're just going to be, you know, producing spike protein for a couple days, and it's only going to be in your muscle, and that's all that's going to happen, and your body will clean it up, and everything will be fine.

36:14.141 --> 36:17.642
And instead, it turns out that there's all these different possibilities.

36:17.722 --> 36:24.865
It could be that your body develops very hardcore, highly specific immunity that results in the second shot

36:25.345 --> 36:28.788
having devastating effects on whatever organs are transfected.

36:28.808 --> 36:31.710
It could be that you develop tolerance to it.

36:31.750 --> 36:36.795
And then in the fourth shot, now you're shedding spike protein and you're potentially dangerous to other people.

36:37.395 --> 36:45.442
All of these scenarios, as far as I'm concerned, are biologically plausible and definitely possible and could contribute to the total confusion

36:46.184 --> 36:48.385
that is being taken advantage of here.

36:48.445 --> 36:53.188
These people knew that the transfection wouldn't have one or two bad side effects.

36:53.228 --> 36:56.470
And so they're taking advantage of that to try and confuse us.

36:56.530 --> 37:04.975
And that's why they started in the very beginning with all this list of weird things that COVID did with heart attacks and all these weird symptoms.

37:05.015 --> 37:10.418
And it's a very strange disease and it's all about the spike protein because they always planned

37:11.226 --> 37:12.147
And I'm convinced of it.

37:12.167 --> 37:17.210
They always plan to tell us this story that this toxic spike protein is responsible for all these things.

37:17.250 --> 37:22.653
And they're probably going to say that the spike protein is responsible for her transverse myelitis, but it's not.

37:22.693 --> 37:35.040
It could have been any protein, any foreign protein that they expressed in that way that many times in her body had the potential to generate the effects that it has because it's an autoimmune reaction against her own tissue.

37:35.581 --> 37:40.103
And it's unfortunately, I think the tissue that was transfected that it reacted to.

37:40.144 --> 37:40.784
And in this case,

37:41.304 --> 37:42.786
hits the myelin in the spinal cord.

37:42.806 --> 37:48.070
Okay, that's a lot right there and I get it.

37:48.190 --> 37:55.237
And what I'm trying to understand now is if someone gets to the point of shedding spike, is it going to be the same type of spike as everybody?

37:55.357 --> 37:57.439
Or can you also get another type of spike?

37:57.879 --> 38:01.502
Let's say a couple is in bed, they're both fully vaxxed and they start to shed.

38:01.843 --> 38:04.205
Are they going to be like infecting each other in some way?

38:04.285 --> 38:07.468
I think the first place to start is that where we give

38:08.840 --> 38:21.244
We give the national security state, and we give Moderna, and we give Pfizer the credit of producing a pure RNA if we start to speculate about what spike is going to be there.

38:21.304 --> 38:28.586
Because they don't produce pure RNA, they produce a pretty heterogeneous product of RNA.

38:29.935 --> 38:40.634
If they're lucky, I guess maybe 70% of it might be a pretty distinct sequence signal, and then the rest of it is variants and truncated versions of that signal.

38:41.334 --> 38:55.145
So the protein complement that's gonna be produced if this transfection is indeed a successful product and produced and gets in people's arms and distributes in their body, is not just gonna be spike protein, but it's gonna be a lot of spike protein fragments.

38:55.205 --> 38:59.208
And those spike protein fragments are also gonna be represented by fragmented RNA.

38:59.849 --> 39:08.576
And that fragmented RNA, because we know that it does this, but we don't really understand the depth and breadth of it, small RNAs,

39:09.901 --> 39:14.206
in all of our cells are one of the primary ways that RNA transcripts are regulated.

39:14.246 --> 39:27.440
We're told in this very simple cartoon version of cellular machinery where DNA gets translated to RNA and then RNA gets translated to proteins via ribosomes and proteins fold into their shape and then they do their job.

39:28.501 --> 39:37.087
That is true, but how that process is regulated and why it needs to be regulated and where it's regulated is very poorly understood.

39:37.107 --> 39:42.611
But we do know that one of the ways it's regulated is by the abundance of RNA transcripts.

39:42.671 --> 39:46.653
So if you need more protein, you translate a DNA to more RNA.

39:47.194 --> 39:50.416
And the more RNA that's floating around, then the more protein will be made.

39:50.896 --> 39:59.245
And so regulating the amount of protein that's available, especially a protein that gets broken down regularly like an ion channel or something that's a functional protein,

40:00.633 --> 40:05.816
is regulated by the amount of RNA that's present in the cell, and you regulate that RNA by degrading it.

40:06.456 --> 40:23.365
It gets degraded by random chance, as far as we understand, because there are enzymes that do it, but it also gets degraded if small segments of RNA can bind to single-stranded RNA and make it double-stranded, it's immediately kind of tagged for degradation.

40:24.165 --> 40:43.560
So one of the hypothesized mechanisms for regulating DNA are that small complementary RNAs are made and the concentration of those small complementary RNAs actually interplays with the concentration of the coding sequence to regulate the presence of the coding sequence and the concentration that it's found in.

40:44.060 --> 40:46.422
And so that's a pretty complicated mechanism.

40:46.482 --> 40:53.488
Now imagine that the smaller the fragments of the spike protein RNA, the more likely they are to overlap with

40:54.187 --> 40:57.189
endogenous sequences that we're not even aware of.

40:57.570 --> 41:03.914
And so the idea that they're putting a pure RNA into us saves them from that possibility.

41:03.975 --> 41:08.278
But the fact that they're producing very impure RNA actually

41:09.651 --> 41:25.101
makes us very vulnerable to the possibility that small RNAs that are not going to make a functional protein, but could have overlap with our own endogenous sequences, maybe even with RNA sequences that are associated with mitochondria or DNA in the mitochondria.

41:25.141 --> 41:34.668
And in that case, you could have mitochondrial damage, all because, again, we don't know what this noisy RNA will do inside of the cells when we transfect them.

41:35.228 --> 41:46.157
We can assume what the pharmaceutical companies would like us to assume, which is that they put in pure RNA in there and that that pure RNA makes pure spike protein and that we could worry about the spike.

41:46.777 --> 41:52.662
But I think that already gives Moderna and Pfizer two or three levels of assumption that we shouldn't give them.

41:52.722 --> 42:00.549
And those levels of assumption absolve them from what I think are very significant shortcomings that they knew about from the very beginning.

42:01.049 --> 42:04.372
And these little pieces of RNA are very dangerous from the

42:05.455 --> 42:06.837
the perspective of unknown.

42:06.857 --> 42:13.187
And then if we go to the point where, okay, now we're making big proteins, spike proteins, let's talk about the spike protein.

42:14.369 --> 42:19.518
I think, again, you're just really dealing with if there are

42:21.331 --> 42:30.117
If there are special parts of the spike protein, some people say that the furin cleavage site is important or that the HIV inserts of the original spike protein are important.

42:30.537 --> 42:36.522
The original HIV inserts that were supposedly reported in 2020 in an Indian paper aren't taken out.

42:37.432 --> 42:41.314
of the spike protein that is encoded by the Pfizer and the Moderna product.

42:41.854 --> 42:45.236
And even in the Novavax, I mean, they don't care about them.

42:45.276 --> 42:54.300
So in one sense, you have these people over here arguing that these inserts are evidence of gain of function, but then they don't seem to care that they're in that spike protein.

42:54.320 --> 43:06.606
And if they do, I see that as a very harmonious way for the national security state that already knew that transfection wasn't gonna work, but they had to convince us that it did.

43:07.478 --> 43:20.226
then they build that into the narrative that, you know what, the worst case scenario three years from now is that they're going to admit to Kayla, when they pay her out, whatever they pay her out, that maybe we chose the wrong protein.

43:20.786 --> 43:34.355
Maybe we should have been more careful and edited the protein or scanned it, or maybe we should have scanned your genome first, and then we could have taken the spike protein and decided what parts of it wouldn't work with you.

43:34.815 --> 43:36.597
Because that's personalized medicine.

43:36.617 --> 43:49.951
And I think a lot of these people that are kind of actors for the national security state are really starting to hint at this, that the way this pivot is going to go is that the old vaccine schedule is going to be admitted to be kind of blunt.

43:50.952 --> 44:04.037
and ham-fisted, and that the rush of transfection, which is really the future, the rush of it, and the poor choice of a spike protein that at the time, you know, we innocently chose it.

44:04.077 --> 44:06.578
We didn't know that it was like a gain-of-function spike protein.

44:06.598 --> 44:11.460
But now that we know that it was probably a laboratory-designed thing, we would have never chosen it.

44:12.130 --> 44:16.572
And I think that in a year or two, they could definitely admit that.

44:16.592 --> 44:18.212
And maybe America will take the fall.

44:18.252 --> 44:20.894
Maybe even Tony Fauci will take the fall.

44:20.914 --> 44:21.514
I have no idea.

44:21.554 --> 44:29.157
But I know that that concept feels very built into me now, and this pivot that's coming.

44:29.998 --> 44:33.383
will involve admitting that Kayla is hurt.

44:33.463 --> 44:42.878
It's just that I think they will try very hard to take as many of these people as possible to get them to get on board with this idea that it's not transfection that did it.

44:43.655 --> 44:47.838
But it's this spike protein that they chose, and they shouldn't have chosen that.

44:47.878 --> 44:52.500
They should have chosen a different protein, or they should have been more careful.

44:53.381 --> 45:00.165
I don't know what their explanation will be, but I do know that they're never going to admit that this methodology is responsible, even though that

45:00.848 --> 45:05.153
My biological take on it is that it's the methodology.

45:05.173 --> 45:07.155
It wouldn't matter what protein they used.

45:07.595 --> 45:11.820
You could take a frog protein and you'd get transverse myelitis in a lot of people.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.102
You'd get a lot of aortic ruptures.

45:14.122 --> 45:17.005
You'd get a lot of these huge clotting events.

45:17.065 --> 45:20.809
All these things are just normal from transfecting mammals.

45:21.850 --> 45:22.411
That's what I think.

45:24.528 --> 45:27.532
Okay, so now what we're getting into is some of the legal side of things.

45:27.572 --> 45:30.596
So let me just read out what Kayla has done here.

45:31.037 --> 45:35.643
February 22, 2024, she filed a lawsuit seeking $45 million in damages.

45:35.663 --> 45:39.027
It was filed on behalf of Kayla against Monderna.

45:39.728 --> 45:50.153
that claims seeks physical, emotional, and psychological damages, loss of past and present or future income, and future cost of care, pain, and suffering, as well as aggravated and punitive damages.

45:50.754 --> 45:52.595
So here's what Kayla's doing to fight back.

45:53.395 --> 46:02.400
I just noticed that there was another state that filed a lawsuit against Pfizer, so excuse me if I don't remember that state, and then Texas is also talking about doing this.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.241
So is it downbreaking?

46:04.561 --> 46:05.961
Is it going into the courts now?

46:05.981 --> 46:06.902
Does it look like

46:07.842 --> 46:11.224
the ride might be over and we might be getting some answers by taking us into a courtroom?

46:12.444 --> 46:14.125
I have to look into it.

46:14.145 --> 46:14.725
I didn't know.

46:15.345 --> 46:21.748
I have been consulting for a case that looks like it's going to get, it might get tossed out.

46:21.788 --> 46:22.608
We have to appeal.

46:22.628 --> 46:28.871
It is a case that involves the weekly testing of municipal employees in California.

46:28.951 --> 46:30.712
They were testing with PCR, of course,

46:31.779 --> 46:50.261
But the interesting thing in this case that I find very stunning is that the no-bid contract for the testing of these police officers every week was granted to a man who appears to be a porn movie producer.

46:51.201 --> 46:59.625
And he chose to use some very expensive machinery that would also be well suited for genome mapping.

47:00.685 --> 47:14.051
And interestingly, he also sourced all of his PCR materials from BGI in China, which is a very big human genome collaborator with the largest sequencing company in China.

47:14.931 --> 47:17.332
And so it's a very strange sort of thing that

47:18.135 --> 47:34.099
a large city in California would contract a porn movie producer to use Chinese sourced PCR materials, including controls, which were a bacteriophage expressing the spike protein, which is pretty funny.

47:34.859 --> 47:41.180
And so this lab in California had bacteriophage that was expressing the spike protein as their positive control.

47:41.760 --> 47:44.161
And they were using a single amplicon

47:45.221 --> 47:51.906
to test for PCR, you know, to test for the presence of COVID in these police officers and other municipal employees.

47:51.946 --> 47:55.108
And the funny part is, is that that wasn't ever enough.

47:55.168 --> 48:03.634
They were only testing for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is a very conserved region in most of these signals in nature.

48:03.674 --> 48:05.596
And so it's not a very good differentiator.

48:07.565 --> 48:18.989
Anyway, long story short, I think it's very possible that a lot of the sort of thing that actually happened during the course of the first two years of the pandemic was just a massive data sweep.

48:19.610 --> 48:25.712
The idea of how many medical remnants can we generate and how many of those medical remnants are useful.

48:26.292 --> 48:27.793
So they had saliva samples.

48:27.853 --> 48:29.454
They had deep nasal swabs.

48:29.494 --> 48:31.334
They had lateral flow tests.

48:31.374 --> 48:32.975
They had blood samples.

48:33.015 --> 48:33.836
They had sputum.

48:33.856 --> 48:35.136
They had all these things.

48:35.656 --> 48:42.560
And once they are into the medical system in America, they can be de-identified and become medical remnants.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.240
And they become very valuable things.

48:44.300 --> 48:44.901
And that happened

48:45.521 --> 48:52.267
Throughout the pandemic, universities and hospitals in America took advantage of this, and those remnants were all sold.

48:52.307 --> 48:58.412
And my guess is that a lot of those remnants were sold to see if reliable genetic data could be derived from them.

48:58.472 --> 49:04.738
Because if they could, of course, one of the central missing pieces of the Human Genome Project was the data.

49:05.318 --> 49:10.523
The Human Genome Project, essentially, when it was completed and announced on the cover of Nature as having been done,

49:11.178 --> 49:14.380
The one thing that they had really done was figured out how big the problem was.

49:14.420 --> 49:15.161
That was really it.

49:15.221 --> 49:16.702
They hadn't really accomplished anything.

49:17.283 --> 49:28.451
And in fact, although the ability to sequence, you know, short sequences of let's say 3,000 bases has greatly increased and the cheapness of manufacturing those lengths has been greatly decreased.

49:29.332 --> 49:36.497
It doesn't really mean that now we can, you know, sequence a whole genome and compare it and then know what's there.

49:36.517 --> 49:37.498
I mean,

49:40.245 --> 49:42.171
Let's be really, really clear about it.

49:42.411 --> 49:47.525
There's a lot of things that we understand, but we don't understand, for example,

49:50.325 --> 49:52.166
Let me say, give you a few things.

49:52.827 --> 50:08.117
We think of, for example, a mouse and a lion and a human have a brain and the brains all have a lot of the same components and they all have neurons and they all have interneurons and a lot of the parts and a lot of the cellular components are basically the same.

50:08.757 --> 50:13.600
But when you get down to the molecular level, then you also find out that all their ion channels are different.

50:13.620 --> 50:15.422
The compliment of ion channels are different.

50:15.962 --> 50:18.504
And you start to realize that although the parts

50:19.384 --> 50:25.386
are the same, the actual physical manifestation of them and how they work together and the little bits and pieces are all different.

50:25.907 --> 50:31.629
And that sort of limitation of reductionist biology is where we are right now.

50:31.689 --> 50:34.430
And at the heart of that lie,

50:36.025 --> 50:42.569
is the idea that studying cells in animals, we learned a lot about our own cells.

50:43.229 --> 50:49.792
Studying tissues and how cells combine to form tissues in other animals, we learned a lot about our own tissues.

50:50.433 --> 51:03.360
But there's a big gap somewhere there in biology between how that parallel between other mammals, other vertebrates can be drawn at the genetic level.

51:04.076 --> 51:10.542
Because the problem is that we can see, oh look, mice, they have potassium channels.

51:10.582 --> 51:14.986
And when we look in their genome, we can find potassium channel genes.

51:15.046 --> 51:19.631
And some of those potassium channel genes have their homologue in

51:20.511 --> 51:26.137
in higher primates, and even some of them have homologs that correspond to our potassium channels.

51:26.197 --> 51:40.610
The problem is, is that if you take all of those genetic parallels, all of those genetic parallels are enzymes and proteins, and if you take all of that out, you're still left with a majority of the genome.

51:41.172 --> 51:44.213
that we don't know what it does, we don't know what it codes for.

51:45.033 --> 52:06.099
And that same amount of genetic information is left over in that comparison animal, the rat or the mouse, that we don't understand how that data results in all of this, you know, very similar complement of proteins, very similar parts, you know, potassium channels, sodium channels, neurons, kidneys, you know, all this stuff.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.421
Even though that's the case, the genetic signals

52:11.221 --> 52:25.867
which allow a similar assembly of cells to form a human, that has all the intelligence and all the lifespan and all the physiology of a human, versus a rat, is completely unknown.

52:27.067 --> 52:40.192
And even though we have, whether you like it or not, we have pretended that studying genes in those animals is telling us something about those genes in us, and that means that we understand

52:41.448 --> 52:44.690
the genetic basis of a mouse and the genetic basis of people.

52:45.370 --> 52:46.551
That's not what it means at all.

52:46.991 --> 52:53.635
And that means that there's so much more to understand than we could ever possibly crack.

52:53.675 --> 53:03.061
And that's where I think the transfection thing, the COVID thing, the RNA pandemic thing is such a vital

53:04.144 --> 53:15.033
door that's open right now, window that's open that we can wake people up to this idea that lying and exaggerating has become the norm in science and especially in public health.

53:15.554 --> 53:21.078
And if we can get to that stage to realize that it's not just profit, it's also power and control.

53:21.679 --> 53:31.387
If an entire human population cannot effectively govern themselves because they don't understand how to pursue well-being effectively.

53:31.767 --> 53:48.638
because they've been misled about nutrition and misled about health and misled about environmental toxins and misled about vaccines and misled about the potential of RNA to pandemic, then we really have a very short window here where the stories of people like Kayla combined with

53:49.380 --> 54:08.976
you know, biological sort of truths that fit the best and most parsimoniously with what all of us have experienced could finally sort of tip the threshold over where people will be able to accept why it is that these people have been lying to us and why it's on both sides in a lot of countries.

54:10.437 --> 54:11.718
It's extraordinary.

54:11.838 --> 54:15.040
It's a very, very important time in human history right now.

54:16.221 --> 54:18.063
I don't know why I'm talking here, but anyway.

54:18.732 --> 54:19.352
No, I love it.

54:19.512 --> 54:27.135
Do you know, do you, I guess nobody could really know why, but do you think this was an accident that they're responding to or completely on purpose?

54:28.956 --> 54:30.997
Um, I have a loaded question and it's tough.

54:31.017 --> 54:31.677
No, no, no, no.

54:32.078 --> 54:36.559
I, I, I don't, I don't think that there's any doubt that it is on purpose.

54:36.980 --> 54:44.703
Um, I would, I would say that, that one, one, you could go all the way back to a book like this, a man and his future.

54:44.743 --> 54:46.663
This book was written in, uh, 19.

54:49.658 --> 55:16.472
63 and at the the jacket the jacket text is This book should make people think biological research is in a ferment creating and promising methods of interference with natural Processes which could transform or destroy nearly every aspect of human life, which we value And no, that's not what I want like this

55:18.147 --> 55:18.828
Oh, darn.

55:19.309 --> 55:19.729
Like this.

55:19.849 --> 55:20.110
Yes.

55:20.530 --> 55:21.832
So here, sorry.

55:22.293 --> 55:31.024
And intelligent individuals of every race, color, and creed must consider the present and imminent possibilities for mankind.

55:31.104 --> 55:34.749
Man must be prepared to defend those principles which he believes to be good.

55:35.552 --> 55:41.577
And more importantly, to use the present immense creative opportunities for a happier and healthier world.

55:42.237 --> 55:46.500
This creative opportunities, what they're really talking about are genetic engineering.

55:46.600 --> 55:50.964
And this is in a time when genetic engineering was still being imagined.

55:51.004 --> 56:00.311
This would have been the time shortly after when Robert Malone would have been in his post-doc and thinking that in 10 years there would be a geneticist at every hospital.

56:00.811 --> 56:04.254
that would be curing childhood diseases using retroviruses.

56:04.294 --> 56:15.362
He said that in many interviews, that when he was a postdoc, that was his vision of the very near future and why he chose to go into retroviral vectors, into transfection and transformation,

56:15.942 --> 56:21.586
was simply because he knew that this kind of technology was the cutting edge and what the future wanted.

56:21.646 --> 56:31.994
And I think that books like this were already talking about how mankind had to get nation states out of the way because we needed a global consensus.

56:32.674 --> 56:41.196
that smart men needed to take control of the evolution of mankind and no longer leave it to the randomness of mother nature.

56:41.276 --> 56:47.478
That's what this book is about, about when are we going to put our big boy pants on and take control of our evolution.

56:47.938 --> 56:56.681
And people like Joshua Lederberg and Hilary Kaprowski are people that were crafting this kind of ideology back before we knew

56:57.601 --> 57:03.646
the limitations of that irreducible complexity and how long or how impossible the task would be.

57:04.207 --> 57:14.756
These people in the 60s were still thinking that there might be ways that we could genetically hybrid closely related apes and humans in order to learn about the genome.

57:14.816 --> 57:17.018
These people thought that that would be possible.

57:17.518 --> 57:38.088
So now that we've realized the limitations of some of those genetic, you know, imagined possibilities, and we've also realized that the Human Genome Project wasn't going to be as simple as just kind of, you know, brute force throughput method, but we would actually need to sample almost all of the humans that are available if we were going to get any chance of

57:38.548 --> 58:05.112
having some degree of understanding because the landmarks are so... Anyway, the point is that books like this, I think, and the people that are responsible for books like that have already admitted decades ago that the plan was a necessity, that we needed to turn the whole enterprise of mankind and society needed to be changed and focused so that we were all bent

58:06.025 --> 58:09.007
on collectively elevating humanity.

58:09.067 --> 58:12.509
So not thinking about ourselves, but thinking about future generations.

58:12.950 --> 58:22.095
And that means that you could lie to people, that you could tell people one story in order to achieve a goal that was in the generation to come.

58:22.216 --> 58:25.978
And these people were willing to do that with regard to experimentation.

58:27.001 --> 58:30.544
and sort of learning the truths of human biology.

58:30.965 --> 58:32.246
And they said it in those books.

58:32.306 --> 58:45.858
And I don't think that there is any, I think that actually COVID could be the one of the culminating moments of this multi-decade plan where they knew they were going to eventually have to

58:47.060 --> 59:02.074
goal with all the chips in the middle with regard to vaccination and make the majority of the populace accept it as an undeniable advance in technology similar to airplanes or the wheel.

59:03.215 --> 59:06.358
And that's the gambit that we're witnessing right now.

59:06.418 --> 59:07.399
That's what I really think.

59:09.561 --> 59:11.183
Wow, Jonathan, Kate.

59:11.883 --> 59:13.104
What happened to that author?

59:13.164 --> 59:14.705
Is that author still around?

59:14.745 --> 59:16.306
Is that group still around?

59:16.366 --> 59:17.427
So there's a lot of authors.

59:17.447 --> 59:18.368
Let me just read the list.

59:18.428 --> 59:19.049
It's really great.

59:19.089 --> 59:20.149
There's some really good ones.

59:20.189 --> 59:23.392
That sounds like the predecessor to this book that eventually came out, right?

59:23.872 --> 59:24.933
Yeah, yeah.

59:25.053 --> 59:26.194
It could be.

59:26.254 --> 59:29.196
They might just be all descendants of the same thing.

59:29.236 --> 59:32.879
So Sir Julian Huxley is a very interesting one.

59:32.919 --> 59:35.141
He writes the beginning, the first intro.

59:36.338 --> 59:40.680
Another one that I really like a lot is Hilary Koprowski.

59:41.580 --> 59:46.322
This is a really interesting chapter because it's called The Future of Infectious and Malignant Diseases.

59:46.842 --> 59:51.484
And believe it or not, it talks about viruses that come out of bat caves to kill the world.

59:51.784 --> 59:52.664
And I'm not kidding.

59:53.266 --> 59:59.330
Yes, and Hilary Koprowski is actually one of the fathers of the vaccine program in North America.

59:59.350 --> 01:00:13.780
And he has a very interesting story because he kind of came through the concentration camps of World War II, through Italy and the Vatican playing piano, and then eventually through Brazil, and then into the yellow fever and polio vaccine programs.

01:00:14.921 --> 01:00:20.224
Herman Muller is another guy who I think a lot of people know as an old school geneticist here again.

01:00:20.805 --> 01:00:24.727
Genetic progress by voluntarily conducted germinal choice.

01:00:24.947 --> 01:00:27.629
I think you can kind of translate what that means.

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.891
Joshua Lederberg, of course, is a big, big deal.

01:00:31.372 --> 01:00:36.655
He was a child prodigy of son of a rabbi in New York City, I believe.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:38.997
biological future of man.

01:00:39.117 --> 01:00:45.324
Joshua Lederberg is one of the, you know, grandfathers of genetic thinking in America, passed away, I think, in 2006.

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:52.382
And I don't know if there's any other ones there that I would mention off the top of my head, but they're all really, really interesting.

01:00:52.422 --> 01:00:55.065
The future of the mind is a really good discussion there too.

01:00:55.545 --> 01:01:05.034
It's just a wonderful book because you can see that these ideas are not ideas which have just recently served, you know, the ideas of Elon Musk or Peter Thiel.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:11.500
These people are, there's a line of thinking and a line of mentors and they're following it very well.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:19.503
And a lot of the intentions that are codified in these earlier books are being followed to the letter right now.

01:01:19.563 --> 01:01:23.444
And maybe even described using very similar combinations of words.

01:01:23.504 --> 01:01:24.444
It's really extraordinary.

01:01:24.464 --> 01:01:33.967
A lot of the words that we actually use in the biological canon right now were actually coined by Joshua Lederberg.

01:01:34.007 --> 01:01:38.209
Joshua Lederberg is the guy who is quoted at the beginning of Outbreak.

01:01:40.015 --> 01:01:43.140
And I don't remember what the exact quote is, but it's something about pandemics.

01:01:43.481 --> 01:01:48.048
And Joshua Lederberg is the guy who coined the phrase, the microbiome.

01:01:48.629 --> 01:01:51.012
Joshua Lederberg is responsible for

01:01:53.766 --> 01:01:55.547
Actually, this is crazy.

01:01:55.607 --> 01:01:56.908
I forgot this is the biggest thing.

01:01:57.469 --> 01:01:58.610
Mark would be really mad at me.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:03.553
You should really interview Mark Kulak of Mark Housatonic Live.

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:09.337
He's really, really a great historian, archivist.

01:02:10.318 --> 01:02:18.184
And he has made a very convincing argument that actually Joshua Lederberg is the guy who let

01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:25.514
uh, Carrie Mullis kind of claim the credit for PCR.

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:27.135
And in fact, it is possible.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:42.441
And it seems more and more likely the more that I've read that, that actually Carrie Mullis didn't understand the breadth and depth of the importance of what he had discovered until he told Joshua Lederberg at a poster presentation.

01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:44.142
And then Joshua helped him to.

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:51.423
or made it significant, but then didn't take credit for it, but just let him take credit for it.

01:02:51.523 --> 01:02:58.168
And then, of course, knowing all along, perhaps, that it could be used in these nefarious ways as a diagnostic or any other thing.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:04.333
I don't know all of that stuff, but I do know that Joshua Lederberg, interestingly enough, is the guy who basically

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.865
co-discovered PCR.

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:31.754
I mean, of course, Kerry Mullis has given the credit for it, but it's possible, and I wouldn't be crazy to think that what was a simple idea in a simple context could have been seen by someone like Joshua Lederberg as a much, much bigger potential insight.

01:03:32.215 --> 01:03:32.355
And

01:03:34.656 --> 01:03:44.658
And I think a lot of that insight went immediately into other, I don't know what you would call it, but not regular academic science anymore.

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:59.182
I think that's really what's at the heart of all of this is that the Human Genome Project, the requirement or the need to make everyone a test animal also needed something to

01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:12.112
something to to justify this and That's I think why if you go back to medical dictionaries from the early 1900s You're not going to hear a lot of talk about viruses.

01:04:12.132 --> 01:04:22.156
You're not going to hear a lot of talk about viral stuff This is a more recent Manifestation of molecular biology because before I

01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:37.553
Before molecular biology, like cheap sequencing and PCR reactions and this kind of thing, it was very, very difficult for good proof of most, if not all viruses.

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:50.780
You could prove that things were happening, you could prove that stuff was causing other stuff to happen, but showing that it was a virus and not just an RNA, or showing that it's a virus and not just something else, that was more tricky.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:05:01.810
And since sequencing has become a cheap proxy for the presence of a virus, basically they can find viruses wherever they want to.

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:09.798
And so I think that at some point in time there were competing ideas for what

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:23.403
you know, for what and how this would be described, and they have to, you know, sort of take into account the discoveries that are happening, because not all biologists are bad guys, the vast majority of them are very good.

01:05:24.203 --> 01:05:29.166
And so, the trick is to see that there aren't very many virologists in the world.

01:05:29.206 --> 01:05:33.289
The trick is to see that most biologists don't want to be a virologist.

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:39.373
And virology, up until very, very recently, and I mean like very recently,

01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:49.740
Virology was considered a joke in academic biology because that was always the study of something indirectly.

01:05:50.942 --> 01:05:56.688
You can find hundreds and hundreds of plant biologists and plant virologists

01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:01.647
No, I said it right the first time.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:08.691
You can find plant biologists talking about plant virology as chasing ghosts.

01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:15.976
You can find animal biologists talking about animal virology as chasing ghosts up until very, very...

01:06:16.716 --> 01:06:43.426
recently like in the last decade and that's because molecular biology has become a proxy for for the presence of a virus and so never before has there been a way to show the presence of a virus so easy and most of the people that are working in virology are just are wholly unaware of the fact that their proxy for the presence of what they think they're studying is really only a

01:06:44.845 --> 01:06:51.411
a molecular tool to measure for the possible presence of a small, short sequence.

01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:58.377
It doesn't mean that just because you found a little rubber in your garage that there's a Mercedes-Benz there, or there was one.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:02.601
And it's kind of at this stage with molecular biology

01:07:03.303 --> 01:07:24.271
they are so inept at differentiating from a background and take the word for every commercial product that they used in order to do their experiments and also accept synthetic DNA as a rough proxy for the starting point, then we really have this place where a lot of biologists don't get it anymore.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:32.401
They are not broadly enough trained to scrutinize their own methodologies.

01:07:32.461 --> 01:07:48.615
And because they've just inherited these recipes from their mentors, and that's kind of the basis for their expertise, it becomes even harder for them to retrospectively look at what they're doing with an objective eye.

01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.771
I think that's the main problem with virology.

01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:57.555
And so we have a huge task, because I don't think all virology is nonsense.

01:07:58.536 --> 01:08:04.000
I, for example, haven't been able to debunk the idea that there's a measles virus.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.102
As far as I can tell, there's a measles virus.

01:08:06.142 --> 01:08:09.005
I just know that a measles virus can't pandemic, and it never could.

01:08:10.038 --> 01:08:17.159
Um, even in the best, most documented, um, scenarios, there's usually a vaccine involved in an outbreak.

01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:26.221
Um, and so, uh, even in the past when people would have an outbreak, um, it was very rare that, that a family would have everybody get it.

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:27.501
A couple people might get it.

01:08:28.201 --> 01:08:34.023
Um, but even all the people that weren't, um, previously infected didn't necessarily get it when some people got it.

01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:35.423
And so, yeah.

01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:54.291
For me right now, the trick is to understand that the national security state has a vested interest in us not understanding our role in this, our role in this as far as bad health and environmental health and nutrition and this kind of thing.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.572
And they also don't want us to understand

01:08:57.335 --> 01:08:59.977
the extent to which that they've lied about a lot of these things.

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:05.981
It's not just, you know, respiratory viruses and respiratory disease that they've lied about.

01:09:06.001 --> 01:09:12.645
They've also lied very consistently about their ability to throw money in at cancer and eventually they're gonna get it.

01:09:12.745 --> 01:09:15.547
Like that's an absolute lie.

01:09:16.248 --> 01:09:18.629
And that's because most cancer is kind of unique.

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:22.552
Yeah, sure, you can look at people that have cancer in the same organ,

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:26.658
But that doesn't mean that the underlying molecular mechanism is gonna be the same.

01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:31.483
Yes, there's gonna be able to subdivide them and, you know, classify them across thousands of people.

01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:35.227
But that doesn't mean that they're all caused by the same thing.

01:09:35.836 --> 01:09:43.783
And so again, we're allowing modern science to careen out of control because of the way that it's done.

01:09:43.863 --> 01:09:56.334
The null hypothesis and the use of P-values to discover things has been used to create the illusion of progress in our understanding of cancer.

01:09:56.894 --> 01:10:01.298
It has been create the illusion of effectiveness in our treatment of cancer.

01:10:01.858 --> 01:10:14.974
It has been used to create the illusion of defeating disease with vaccines, and it's been used to create the illusion of a pandemic that we just experienced, instead of just a...

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:29.037
a terribly orchestrated and malevolently orchestrated spread of terrible ideas and bad protocols and lies, which led to fear, uncertainty and doubt and confusion to catastrophic levels.

01:10:29.137 --> 01:10:44.507
I mean, this part of it is just horrible because if you realize that these people coordinated their lying and that this was a really well orchestrated global security event to fool a lot of people at once,

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.929
then none of us were going to get out of it.

01:10:48.969 --> 01:10:58.991
I mean, you could know that it was a bad idea from the very beginning, but you still were not going to be able to see through the coordinated lying for a long time.

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.632
Nobody was going to be able to do that.

01:11:00.652 --> 01:11:01.292
It was too good.

01:11:02.272 --> 01:11:05.493
And so you can't blame Kayla for where she's being.

01:11:05.653 --> 01:11:06.733
You can't blame her at all.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.254
And you can't blame anybody who's there.

01:11:09.314 --> 01:11:12.595
And that's the part about it that's horrible.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:24.092
You know, there was a long time where they had us fighting and angry at each other and, uh, you know, them blaming us for the spread or whatever it is.

01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:34.374
And that was also by design, you know, and, and so all of us are going to have to humble ourselves and remember that we, none of us knew we knew you could have a bad feeling and you knew it wasn't right.

01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:38.915
And you knew you were going to ignore it, but you couldn't, you couldn't explain what was going on.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:43.576
And all of us underestimated how many people were involved and how coordinated it was going to be.

01:11:43.656 --> 01:11:44.416
I think, um,

01:11:45.831 --> 01:11:50.081
I mean, it's so long ago that all those African presidents died.

01:11:50.241 --> 01:11:52.947
It's so long ago that some of these things happened.

01:11:52.987 --> 01:11:54.451
It feels like a decade already.

01:11:56.104 --> 01:12:04.006
Now to remind everybody how possible this is, the Manhattan Project, very few people in that project actually knew what the end goal was.

01:12:04.347 --> 01:12:07.087
Some of them, if they knew what the end goal was, wouldn't have been part of it.

01:12:07.587 --> 01:12:09.748
Some of them would have leaked it out to the enemy.

01:12:10.128 --> 01:12:11.889
Some of them might even leaked it out to the public.

01:12:11.929 --> 01:12:13.149
So they stopped the whole project.

01:12:13.649 --> 01:12:20.411
Like there was a coordinated effort with like a hundred thousand or more people where very few actually knew what the end result was going to be.

01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:25.133
Some people were working on fin, some people were working on uranium, some people were working on theory.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:31.017
I'm sure a lot of them would have said, no, I don't want to kill 100,000 people, but that's not what they were told.

01:12:31.557 --> 01:12:32.838
They were told we're under threat.

01:12:32.878 --> 01:12:34.380
We got to fight for our own freedom.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.161
We got to make sure we win in this one.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:37.322
Make sure the enemy doesn't.

01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:44.776
Like the common goal and the idea that you'll do anything for the common goal is an example of the Manhattan Project.

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:49.397
Now, whether or not it's needed and it was supposed to happen, I'm not having that debate.

01:12:49.717 --> 01:12:59.581
But what I'm talking about here is you can get a hundred thousand people, scientists, smart people, all these engineers coming together, and they really don't know what it is they're working on by design.

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:04.613
because if they knew, they might have shared it, met public, or just refused to do the work.

01:13:05.134 --> 01:13:11.420
Some of them would happily do the work, but certainly not most people with morals would have been involved in that if they knew what the end goal was.

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.803
Is that kind of an example of what you talked about that may have been happening here?

01:13:14.863 --> 01:13:16.244
You have biologists working on it?

01:13:16.745 --> 01:13:17.245
Absolutely.

01:13:17.285 --> 01:13:17.946
That's part of it.

01:13:17.986 --> 01:13:22.110
But the other part of it is sort of a naive assumption.

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:24.012
I mean, if I think about the

01:13:24.793 --> 01:13:38.656
the arguments that I had at the University of Pittsburgh with some of my colleagues at the time, the main assumption wasn't, sorry, the main mistake that they made wasn't that they disagreed with my description of it being a transfection.

01:13:38.736 --> 01:13:39.437
When I said that

01:13:39.977 --> 01:13:42.499
You know, we're not gonna transfect our grandmothers, are we?"

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:49.085
Their response was that, well, I mean, they're not rolling out what we would use in our mice.

01:13:49.645 --> 01:13:52.908
Whatever they're gonna roll out will be something that's for humans.

01:13:52.988 --> 01:14:03.136
It will be, you know, better, or pure, or tested, and therefore, you know, they wouldn't just... It's not just a transfection like what we use in our mice, it's gotta be...

01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:05.058
a little better than that.

01:14:05.218 --> 01:14:11.903
And to me, that already, it's kind of goes hand in hand with the PCR explanation that I give people a lot of times.

01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:27.573
The academic biologist that has to use PCR to prove something in their lab has to do triplet controls, has to do triplet experimental group, has to have a couple of different primer sets, has to do a couple of predictive

01:14:29.272 --> 01:14:31.633
background genes so that you can scale the thing.

01:14:31.653 --> 01:14:44.481
In other words, if you want to know if somebody's into basketball by counting the number of basketballs you have, you don't necessarily learn anything if they have two basketballs, but you're not aware that they have 14 footballs.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:48.944
And so you might say, oh, wow, they have two basketballs, so they must be really into basketball.

01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:53.327
And so you have to have something as a measure of, you know, what to normalize against.

01:14:53.407 --> 01:14:57.309
And so in an academic setting, if you wanted to use PCR to prove the

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.998
levels of something, prove the...

01:15:01.826 --> 01:15:15.255
the prevalence of something, say that this protein is here, it's doing something, there would be a whole set of ways that you would try to control for false positives and error in that measurement.

01:15:15.315 --> 01:15:30.545
And also the reviewers would require you to fine tune that, no matter what your experiment was, they would always come back with, well, maybe you can do a control where you look for this and see if those levels are the same, because we'd expect that if your prediction is true.

01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:43.028
Academic biologists are used to using PCR in a very specific way, just like a carpenter is used to using these combinations of tools to achieve a very specific goal.

01:15:43.589 --> 01:15:54.451
And so if you told a carpenter that somebody's going to build a table and they're going to use a saw and a hammer and some nails, then a carpenter would say, okay, I get what he's going to do.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:16:06.482
But then if he walked into the room and he saw a table with only two legs, and the legs weren't long enough, and it looks like they used the saw to not complete the cut, then the carpenter would be like, yeah, but wait, what is this?

01:16:06.902 --> 01:16:19.574
And so the assumption of academic biologists is that if these pharmaceutical companies are going to use PCR to test for a novel coronavirus, they're going to apply it with the exact same amount of rigor

01:16:20.578 --> 01:16:29.222
and the exact same amount of specificity and use of the state-of-the-art methodological techniques that we would use in our lab.

01:16:30.303 --> 01:16:34.045
And that never dawns on them that they might not even use nested primers.

01:16:34.065 --> 01:16:36.326
They might not even use multiple amplicons.

01:16:36.366 --> 01:16:40.828
They might not even use an amplicon that's specific for the target that they say it's for.

01:16:40.848 --> 01:16:44.050
They might not even test this against a background of a patient sample.

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:49.513
They think that all of those things will be done with equal or greater rigor

01:16:50.461 --> 01:16:55.025
than they would do on their own lab bench by themselves as just an academic.

01:16:55.766 --> 01:17:01.952
And so they humble themselves to think that the NIH, obviously they would do it better.

01:17:02.152 --> 01:17:06.717
I would love to work for the NIH if I could, but I mean, I would never aspire to be that smart.

01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:10.460
And so all of these academics are trained

01:17:11.201 --> 01:17:13.703
to think that everybody does it better than me.

01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:15.665
I can barely keep up with these people.

01:17:15.725 --> 01:17:29.676
So this assumption is completely undermined then when, sorry, reinforced then when somebody like you or me, for example, might come along and say, yeah, but they're overcycling.

01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:32.358
And that's how they're getting all these false positives.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:36.521
And then an academic biologist says to themselves, well, yeah, but false.

01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:47.288
I mean, overcycling would only work if they didn't have multiple targets, or if they didn't use nested primers, or if they weren't really sure of their protocol, or if their primers weren't very specific.

01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:52.052
And they would never do that in the context of a national security emergency.

01:17:52.984 --> 01:18:06.194
And those are the kinds of assumptions that really are very easy to stick to if the people who are skeptical are queued up to say something that's very easy for these learned people to dismiss.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:14.741
And so once you start to be able to explain to an academic that, you know what, they didn't use this PCR with any integrity at all.

01:18:15.842 --> 01:18:18.864
In fact, it looks like they didn't even really try.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.125
Then academics, when they say, but describe it to me, they're actually very impressed and shocked.

01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:28.409
They didn't realize that there were 200 different tests in 2021.

01:18:28.449 --> 01:18:35.656
They didn't realize that most all of those tests were aimed at very bad targets or aimed with very terrible primers.

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:42.123
And that it's just a, it is a scenario where

01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:45.784
is a well-designed storm.

01:18:46.965 --> 01:19:02.660
And this well-designed storm includes a deep mythology about how vaccines have been seminal to the decline and virtual elimination of disease, and that

01:19:03.789 --> 01:19:08.810
beyond disease, we really don't have very many problems in our health.

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:20.152
It's really just disease and getting people to conform to the vaccine schedule and listen to the advice of health officials and most of our problems would go away.

01:19:22.432 --> 01:19:26.113
I really think they got us very close to believing that for a while.

01:19:27.293 --> 01:19:30.394
And because we didn't have, a lot of us did not have the

01:19:31.328 --> 01:19:38.330
the wherewithal to hold our college kids back from college, I think they got their ideas very deep into their heads.

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:42.831
And those are the kids that in Pittsburgh, I still see wearing masks in their cars.

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:46.473
It's either very old people or it's college age kids.

01:19:46.633 --> 01:19:48.513
And that bugs me a lot.

01:19:48.873 --> 01:19:53.875
It's unfortunate because we have a very limited window to save them, I think.

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:57.836
I don't know why I'm out there now.

01:19:57.896 --> 01:19:59.416
I keep wandering off the subject.

01:19:59.476 --> 01:20:00.097
I apologize.

01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:07.439
I was talking a bit about the Manhattan Project there and how people didn't know what they were really working on.

01:20:07.859 --> 01:20:09.841
Oh yeah, that's what we're happening here.

01:20:09.881 --> 01:20:23.292
So yeah, I would say one of the evidences of that is that a lot of our more, let's say, elevated social media dissidents have a single story that they've stuck to for the majority of the pandemic.

01:20:24.546 --> 01:20:28.868
I think that in general, that's a very bad sign that somebody's not playing a straight game.

01:20:30.108 --> 01:20:40.612
If, for example, you have been focused on ivermectin for four years and nothing else, I find that very suspect, especially if you've also sold a book.

01:20:42.054 --> 01:20:50.936
I think if you've been focused exclusively on bears for four years straight, I think it might be a reason to be suspect.

01:20:50.996 --> 01:21:06.580
Because at this stage, I think all of the people that have been, purport to have awoken as a result of the pandemic, they have to be, if they are honest, they have to be at the total

01:21:09.315 --> 01:21:11.578
public health is a fraud kind of position.

01:21:11.618 --> 01:21:25.195
You can't be at the stage where you still think that that some things were done correctly or if we would have made some mistakes wouldn't have been made or if you know maybe we missed out on the opportunity to get to zero COVID then none of these people are real.

01:21:25.736 --> 01:21:26.817
They can't possibly be

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:33.712
actually waking up, because again, we're talking about the total context here.

01:21:33.752 --> 01:21:51.155
You can't not be waking up if you don't understand how many people like Kayla there are, and how diverse those kinds of stories are, simultaneously aware of how many people are dead now, and that are not accounted for, and how many of these people are dying of not COVID.

01:21:52.716 --> 01:21:54.616
These are all things that are happening that

01:21:55.839 --> 01:22:15.698
that if you're aware, if you're at the point where the only thing that you do is you're a dissident, you have a substack, and you've been doing that because that's what you've dedicated since 2021, or if you're like me, you were doing it in 2020, then there's no possible way in 2024 that you can't be questioning everything, and if you're not,

01:22:16.218 --> 01:22:28.949
If you still think that there was a novel virus that went around that they probably manufactured and it's still going now, I don't think you can really be taken seriously because it requires a certain level of

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.651
I mean, you've got to really be tuned in to social media still.

01:22:34.671 --> 01:22:42.715
You've really got to be listening carefully and playing along to not have already seen the contradiction for what it is.

01:22:42.735 --> 01:22:54.561
I mean, it's just impossible biologically to believe that a particular sequence of RNA, if endowed with a particular sequence, could

01:22:56.516 --> 01:23:09.324
could continually circulate the globe until right now and be tracked through millions of infections by millions of sequences in a way that is simply unprecedented by orders of magnitude before 2020.

01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:14.287
It's absurd right now.

01:23:14.367 --> 01:23:19.550
It would have been fine if they would have stopped a few years ago and said,

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:26.208
you know, we don't know where it is anymore, we can't really track it, it's too diverse, or something like that.

01:23:26.308 --> 01:23:40.056
But this is just, the only way to explain this is, either it is a manufactured lie of a signal, or, which is probably the most parsimonious signal, it's a signal that was always back there.

01:23:41.403 --> 01:23:46.565
And they can misconstrue it as a specific variant, or a specific this, or a specific that.

01:23:46.585 --> 01:24:02.113
But in reality, if you started saying that cars are spreading everywhere, and oh my gosh, we found a new kind, and you could convince everybody that there were no cars before yesterday, and now cars are spreading everywhere, and everywhere we look we find them.

01:24:03.274 --> 01:24:14.014
You could take a background signal and pretend it's spread, and that might seem ridiculous with cars, but it's not ridiculous with a molecular signal, for which we were not looking before 2020 at all.

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:30.455
And then to say that all of these companies and all of these products are very high fidelity detectors for a signal that wasn't there in 2020 and give trillions of dollars from all these governments for these products.

01:24:30.955 --> 01:24:42.483
And then just to assume that all of these products are indeed an indicator of a novel signal rather than a background that they're just selling us as novel while they kill us with bad protocols and bad ideas.

01:24:42.563 --> 01:24:42.984
I don't know.

01:24:43.084 --> 01:24:44.865
I think one is much easier than the other.

01:24:45.766 --> 01:24:48.427
One only requires a bunch of people to agree to lie.

01:24:48.467 --> 01:24:57.511
And if it's for comfort and fame and power and part of, you know, feeling like you're part of this national security governing elite, because you know the secret.

01:24:58.432 --> 01:25:03.554
And the secret is that the national security state needs kids to grow up thinking there's pandemics.

01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:07.075
Well, hey, it's fun times once you get read in.

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:12.138
It's fun times once you have the classified clearance or once you've signed the paper.

01:25:13.478 --> 01:25:16.079
But I think you're a traitor if you've done it.

01:25:16.119 --> 01:25:20.919
I think you're a traitor to our grandkids because this was never gonna work.

01:25:21.119 --> 01:25:22.320
They knew it wasn't gonna work.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:41.703
And that's where I was going with this biology in the beginning when I was talking about how in the old days, when you go back to old biology books and you see them drawing pictures of the inside of animals and stuff like that to try and learn about ourselves by looking at animals, that works to a long, long, long extent until you get to the molecular aspects of

01:25:42.683 --> 01:25:48.425
of an animal until you get to their physiology, until you get to their molecular metabolism.

01:25:48.465 --> 01:25:50.085
And then it becomes very specific.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:57.727
And that's why sharks have different proteins in their blood that allow some fish to swim in cold water and not freeze.

01:25:57.787 --> 01:26:10.351
And all these special adaptations that are special for the metabolism of all of these animals are also what put limitations on our ability to understand ourselves pharmacologically.

01:26:10.951 --> 01:26:33.645
and to understand ourselves from a molecular biological perspective, such that the Human Genome Project and all those people in the 60s that were trying to get us to get motivated to probe ourselves genetically, thought that one of the ways that we would be able to do it would be to hybridize humans with animals and see how that led to clues about our shared physiology.

01:26:33.685 --> 01:26:37.547
But then it turns out that's not possible, and that's not ethical, and that's not easy to do.

01:26:38.047 --> 01:26:41.089
Because that's not how genes combine, and that's not how mating works.

01:26:41.549 --> 01:26:49.353
And so decades later, we're left with this holy shit moment, because when the Human Genome Project finally figured out what the problem was, the main

01:26:50.729 --> 01:26:57.456
revolution or sorry, revelation was that the only way that we were ever going to figure this out was to test on humans.

01:26:57.857 --> 01:27:05.865
And we could work for several years, decade almost on a few genomes, three or four genomes that would be completed.

01:27:06.426 --> 01:27:10.130
And we would realize that those landmarks were barely enough

01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:22.073
pair one genome to another genome, never mind to try and isolate specific genes that were responsible for specific things, like Mendel thought he did all those many years ago.

01:27:22.173 --> 01:27:31.296
So here we are, we identified the problem, which is that we're going to have to collect an absolute metric ton of genomes in order to have enough

01:27:32.717 --> 01:27:42.928
And then this is where I think I've said this on your stream before, enough representations of the code so that we might have a chance of seeing any patterns that are present there.

01:27:43.389 --> 01:27:44.750
And so that's the same thing.

01:27:46.325 --> 01:27:54.427
that I was saying before with regard to Joshua Lederberg being one of these guys way back when who's forming these ideas.

01:27:54.887 --> 01:28:02.909
He was also one of these pioneers who knew that genetics would be combined with computers in order to crack the code.

01:28:02.969 --> 01:28:12.991
And again, what we're talking about here is the idea of having enough examples of what is assumed to be the same code so that we could start to see patterns in it.

01:28:13.091 --> 01:28:14.852
And that's the extent to which

01:28:15.532 --> 01:28:25.083
the success of the Human Genome Project, it's like saying that we have now a general map of all the national parks in America.

01:28:25.143 --> 01:28:30.189
We know that national parks have a trailhead, and they have bathrooms, and they have a campground.

01:28:30.689 --> 01:28:36.390
And now we're going to go around and we're going to try and understand all the national parks in America.

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:45.773
But with that general map, we actually don't know anything about Yosemite and we don't know anything about the Smoky Mountain National Forest because those maps are specific.

01:28:46.213 --> 01:28:52.895
And so in order for us to start understanding all the national parks in America, I guess we're just going to have to have all the maps of all the national parks.

01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:54.255
And that was

01:28:54.975 --> 01:29:02.537
what the Human Genome Project discovered was that if we map a genome using restriction enzyme maps, we can come up with all these different landmarks.

01:29:02.577 --> 01:29:07.839
But some of those landmarks will just be naturally different places in other people's genomes.

01:29:07.899 --> 01:29:10.380
And it doesn't really give us a good clue about what's there.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.961
And they're not necessarily tied to the same thing.

01:29:13.401 --> 01:29:20.823
So the only way this pattern is going to usefully emerge is if we do this a few thousand or a million more times.

01:29:21.063 --> 01:29:24.204
And so now suddenly we need everybody to be in

01:29:24.404 --> 01:29:24.704
animal.

01:29:24.844 --> 01:29:27.105
And that's really where we are.

01:29:27.166 --> 01:29:31.408
They knew they couldn't test transfection on animals and get it to work safely.

01:29:31.468 --> 01:29:35.930
The only way that they could do it is to test it in the animal that they need it to work in.

01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:47.316
And so they had to roll transfection out before they had any clue how it could work, any clue how it's regulated, because they knew this was the way they were going to make further progress in understanding how they might

01:29:48.095 --> 01:29:58.443
manipulate our genomes, you know, in the same way this book talks about, you know, us taking responsibility away from Mother Nature and putting it in our hands for our evolution in the future.

01:30:00.143 --> 01:30:01.664
I love listening to you talk.

01:30:01.885 --> 01:30:03.406
I almost don't want to interrupt at all.

01:30:03.826 --> 01:30:05.988
And I'm glad you were able to continue doing that.

01:30:06.148 --> 01:30:11.853
I just am, uh, I'm, I get, uh, you ask a nice question and then I get into a role and I guess it's a good evening.

01:30:11.893 --> 01:30:14.175
I haven't been talking in a couple of days, so I had a lot in my head.

01:30:14.755 --> 01:30:15.516
That's my job.

01:30:15.536 --> 01:30:18.438
It's a spur on the conversation, but I think there's a Freudian slip there.

01:30:18.498 --> 01:30:20.840
You kind of said revolution instead of revelation.

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:24.563
And, uh, maybe this revelation is going to lead into a revolution.

01:30:24.643 --> 01:30:27.305
I'm not sure if that was a Freudian slip or not.

01:30:27.966 --> 01:30:28.086
Um,

01:30:28.843 --> 01:30:29.043
Okay.

01:30:29.063 --> 01:30:30.664
So there's a couple of things I want to touch on there too.

01:30:30.724 --> 01:30:36.146
And I want to kind of just go back a little bit to the Manhattan project and apologies for everybody who's waiting for Kayla.

01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:38.027
She did let me know she's going through a procedure.

01:30:38.047 --> 01:30:38.928
I shared it with you there.

01:30:39.628 --> 01:30:41.229
Um, and as soon as she's done, she'll join us.

01:30:41.389 --> 01:30:42.609
So we'll hold out on that one.

01:30:43.130 --> 01:30:55.916
But the Manhattan project, I guarantee you, uh, during the early forties, the spike in bad drivers who were also scientists went up because anybody who came out and said anything kind of disappeared.

01:30:57.217 --> 01:31:10.611
Anybody who figured it out, like, hey, I'm part of this community, but I'm not part of this project, but a lot of my colleagues are gone and they're in this particular region and particular science, and I can kind of extrapolate what's going on here.

01:31:11.069 --> 01:31:20.822
They spoke up, they were considered crazy, and certainly anybody who was for it, or at least thought they were for it, was for the common good.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:24.187
So they would have silenced anybody else in the street, whether they were colleagues or not.

01:31:24.727 --> 01:31:26.350
So I can see how even under the

01:31:27.196 --> 01:31:33.539
the requirement of national security protection because we're in the middle of a war, let's keep it hush-hush, that would have silenced a bunch of people.

01:31:33.999 --> 01:31:40.723
And even the media, I'm sure they were touched and said, hey, look, if anything comes along out of a project, you check it with us or else.

01:31:41.203 --> 01:31:45.785
I'm sure there's a lot of suppression of information back in the early 40s before this all came out later.

01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:51.008
So I would not be surprised to see the industry really crack down like that.

01:31:51.148 --> 01:31:54.350
The defense industry, I think you referred to it as,

01:31:54.790 --> 01:32:02.257
Because it would have been the same group of people, maybe a generation of them, but the same type of industry that would have been fighting for that, to keep that secret too.

01:32:02.758 --> 01:32:11.286
And I'm sure there's a thousand projects we have no idea about, but the suppression there is important.

01:32:12.146 --> 01:32:18.773
That's one of the mythologies that are motivating the people behind the scenes, I think, are some of the more fascinating things that

01:32:19.671 --> 01:32:22.572
I've run across and my imagination runs me across.

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:36.014
My favorite one is the idea that with regard to the Human Genome Project in America, we potentially have a library that will never exist again.

01:32:37.314 --> 01:32:43.275
If they get their way, will there be a population of 10 billion people in the world ever again?

01:32:43.295 --> 01:32:44.355
I guess not.

01:32:44.975 --> 01:32:46.916
And that means that this amount of

01:32:49.457 --> 01:32:54.598
for solving the game Go or solving the game chess, it was just a matter of having enough games.

01:32:55.539 --> 01:33:09.462
And if you think of the human genome, your genome and my genome as two examples of two chess games, and the population of the Earth being about eight and a half billion chess games of the human genome, then you can see the data that they need.

01:33:09.922 --> 01:33:16.384
More importantly, you can see why they need not necessarily ours, but our kids or our kids' kids, because

01:33:17.404 --> 01:33:29.790
two generations from now it's still going to be around 10 billion people, maybe 11 even, if they get a little unlucky and their peak's a little higher, before it finally drops because of the inverted pyramid of population and age.

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:36.774
But nevertheless, I really think it's important right now to see two narratives in the background.

01:33:36.814 --> 01:33:42.257
The first one being that there are a few relatively pure populations in the world that

01:33:42.797 --> 01:33:52.883
from the perspective of laboratory animals, represent a more genetically homogenous population, more akin to an inbred mouse line than the American population.

01:33:52.964 --> 01:33:58.387
My genetics and the genetics of my kids are pretty darn unique, like kind of a mutt.

01:33:58.979 --> 01:34:00.180
in the dog world.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:18.589
And so thinking about that versus a purebred, like a golden retriever, and I don't mean to belittle ethnicities or belittle races, but if you talk very strictly biologically speaking, I don't think I'm being racist in saying that from a genetic perspective,

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:28.742
general population of China, especially if you're ethnically selective, is a large population, relatively homogenous.

01:34:29.525 --> 01:34:43.580
in comparison to the population of America where we had all of this intermingling of bloods and races and backgrounds, such that you have somebody like me who's kind of a Norwegian, French, Filipino, Indian kind of person.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:50.908
So you have this genome that again is going to be pretty hard to map and it's going to be pretty hard to use as a general example.

01:34:51.428 --> 01:34:54.514
It's kind of like a chess game played by two bad players, right?

01:34:54.554 --> 01:34:57.118
So then are you really going to learn anything about the secrets of chess?

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.300
Well, it's still a chess game.

01:34:58.821 --> 01:35:02.327
So the trick here again is that our data set

01:35:03.274 --> 01:35:17.139
could be misconstrued or properly represented as more difficult than the data set presented to the task in India or the task in the Philippines or the task in China.

01:35:17.639 --> 01:35:21.140
And China is especially good example because the sheer number of people there.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:47.963
But the point is that if you combine that with a culture that could be portrayed in a room full of national security officials as having the ethical standards of a totalitarian government where they can do all the sampling that they want to, you can imagine a scenario where the national security people in America and the West were scared into believing that if they don't take action now,

01:35:49.073 --> 01:35:53.884
and start getting ahead of this in their own countries.

01:35:54.993 --> 01:36:00.456
that these other countries will get so far ahead of us with this technology that we'll never be able to catch up to them.

01:36:00.916 --> 01:36:07.760
And as far as we know, they could be buying our medical remnants right now because we're not really regulating those things anyway.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:15.804
And so what if the worst case scenario, China has already been collecting our stuff for a while now, we could be really in big trouble.

01:36:15.844 --> 01:36:21.567
And so we might need to tell our populations that there was a pandemic in order to create

01:36:22.259 --> 01:36:25.901
amount of medical remnants that we're going to need in order to catch up with those people.

01:36:26.702 --> 01:36:37.548
And that is not even that deep of a conspiracy, but it goes all the way red thread with a book like this, where these people have been planning it.

01:36:37.608 --> 01:36:38.528
They realized it.

01:36:38.568 --> 01:36:43.571
And one of the things that this book said was that nation states would stand in the way of this.

01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:54.135
And that seems to dovetail very nicely with the idea that pandemics require the who and the UN and that nations are getting annoying.

01:36:54.695 --> 01:36:56.336
I mean, it's impressive to me.

01:36:57.816 --> 01:37:05.180
The longer that I've been in it, the longer I've been thinking about it, the more it is the history of the ideas.

01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:14.667
that really matters because those are the things that seem to be sustained across decades and the things that people are clinging to and defending.

01:37:15.828 --> 01:37:19.231
So it's exciting because I do think there is a tipping point here.

01:37:19.972 --> 01:37:26.497
And if we can get enough young people to absorb some of this history in the right way,

01:37:28.973 --> 01:37:40.461
I don't know, you know, I think that they, in order to achieve their goal, they have to walk this fine line where, you know, anything can happen and potentially they could lose control of the ship.

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:42.383
And I'm optimistic.

01:37:42.443 --> 01:37:43.123
I'm very hopeful.

01:37:44.564 --> 01:37:45.305
Well, me too.

01:37:45.345 --> 01:37:49.428
And I'm going to stay optimistic because I think people are waking up and there's a lot of smart people out there.

01:37:49.908 --> 01:37:52.350
One comment I mentioned online on Tolongo was

01:37:53.123 --> 01:37:54.444
No one said evil is stupid.

01:37:54.864 --> 01:37:55.464
Evil is evil.

01:37:55.484 --> 01:37:57.225
You gotta remember that.

01:37:57.386 --> 01:37:58.466
They can be quite smart.

01:37:59.027 --> 01:38:02.088
Are you familiar with Dennis Rancourt, Denise Rancourt's work?

01:38:02.288 --> 01:38:03.149
Oh yeah, definitely.

01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:04.130
What are your thoughts around that?

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:12.234
I've been promoting his work pretty much nonstop for about three and a half years, ever since I heard of him.

01:38:14.155 --> 01:38:17.657
I am a little frustrated sometimes because I feel as though

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:31.024
There's been a couple times where people have heard his presentations at meetings and then taken selective talking points from his presentations and promoted them.

01:38:31.604 --> 01:38:33.165
And I can be very specific about it.

01:38:33.225 --> 01:38:42.032
I think the worst example of this was when he presented in Romania at the International COVID Summit in Budapest in

01:38:43.533 --> 01:39:10.407
November of 2023, and then a few people came home from that, including Robert Malone, and wrote an extensive substack about how Denny Rancourt had given this great presentation and shown this really breathtaking data where 17 million people had been injured by the shot, by his estimation, around the world, but made no mention of the fact that he found no evidence of a spreading risk-additive pathogen.

01:39:10.467 --> 01:39:10.727
And so

01:39:11.873 --> 01:39:19.116
Instead of saying that Denny Rancourt's data has about spread in the United States has been around since May of 2020.

01:39:20.396 --> 01:39:22.937
And he has been developing this idea since then.

01:39:23.477 --> 01:39:29.760
And the latest data shows that he can see a signal that's associated with the rollout of the transfection.

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.482
Robert Malone just focused on that and then didn't say anything really specific.

01:39:34.542 --> 01:39:39.303
And there were a few other people that did that very consistently after that.

01:39:41.249 --> 01:39:49.132
And that's what I find most disappointing is that I think his data has been out there for a long time.

01:39:49.172 --> 01:40:02.538
And he's been on many podcasts where a lot of people have heard him say it, but then somehow or another, that fundamental lack of evidence, you know, where it doesn't ever cross borders.

01:40:02.578 --> 01:40:07.400
It doesn't even cross borders of counties in America sometimes that

01:40:09.375 --> 01:40:14.318
I don't know why that's not the main message, but I guess it's not my data.

01:40:14.358 --> 01:40:20.501
I'm not doing that publishing and I'm not doing the interviews and that kind of thing, but that frustrates me a lot.

01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:24.243
I think if I was doing that data and I was Dennis,

01:40:25.143 --> 01:40:47.156
I would be very mad at these people, because I think that's a very important message, that if there's no evidence of a spreading crisis, then there was absolutely no justification to lying to people about transfection, to misinform people or not inform them at all.

01:40:47.916 --> 01:40:53.198
of this untested and highly criminal sort of rollout.

01:40:53.318 --> 01:40:56.479
I mean, it's just the whole premise is based on that.

01:40:56.579 --> 01:41:02.922
And so since he knows that that's not based in fact, I think he should be madder about that.

01:41:02.962 --> 01:41:10.564
But I know that he has a strategy in his head and I know that he's trying very hard to make sure that he doesn't burn any bridges.

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:10.925
And so

01:41:12.225 --> 01:41:19.340
You know, I guess I just hope that eventually he'll get frustrated enough so that he screams it from the rooftops like I've been screaming.

01:41:20.605 --> 01:41:24.368
I'm going to defend him a tiny, tiny bit because I think his issue is he's too busy.

01:41:24.388 --> 01:41:28.212
Um, how other people repackage his work, put it out there.

01:41:28.572 --> 01:41:30.554
He's been on the show before he's going to be coming on again.

01:41:30.634 --> 01:41:32.856
Cause he just did that rumor recent report.

01:41:33.316 --> 01:41:37.780
But my challenge with him is he's really, really busy and he's already onto the next one.

01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.884
So he may just be two heads down to really understand or care or do anything about it.

01:41:43.605 --> 01:41:47.328
Uh, so that's something I'll bring up with him and maybe if his schedule allows, I can bring you with him.

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:54.012
because I think you can help get those questions to him and help him at least understand what's going on.

01:41:54.292 --> 01:41:58.615
Because it could just be he doesn't know, he's too busy and other people are repackaging his work.

01:41:59.735 --> 01:42:00.276
That could be.

01:42:00.416 --> 01:42:03.538
But for him not to be aware of Malone, that's quite the stretch.

01:42:04.038 --> 01:42:15.565
Yeah, I know Malone isn't especially, for me anyway, he's an especially dubious character in this narrative right now.

01:42:16.249 --> 01:42:22.334
And I'm very skeptical of his potential association with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:22.515 --> 01:42:27.719
And now it seems like there's a possibility that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:27.799 --> 01:42:32.904
could get some kind of position in the Trump administration.

01:42:33.024 --> 01:42:40.010
And if that were to result in any kind of position for Robert Malone, that would just be a catastrophe.

01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:42.892
Because I don't think that that guy is a patriot in the way that

01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:54.004
I just, I'm very skeptical of that guy and a few others, and I'm afraid that a lot of those others are now very much associated with Bobby and his associates.

01:42:54.845 --> 01:43:14.416
You know, Pierre Cory's another guy that unfortunately, because of his role in New York City and his role in the pulse ox nonsense and the high flow supplementary oxygen nonsense, and also his role in the George Floyd trial, I just don't trust Pierre Cory.

01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:25.262
And so it frustrates me a lot that he's all over the world testifying in Australia and in the UK about how bad it was in America, when really if we didn't have P.R.

01:43:25.282 --> 01:43:32.911
Corey telling everybody how bad it was in America, we would have people like Robert Malone or Jessica Hockett telling us how there's nothing happened in New York City.

01:43:33.672 --> 01:43:35.474
or that those numbers don't make any sense.

01:43:36.074 --> 01:43:43.521
But instead, we are listening to Pierre Kory, and now Pierre Kory is, I think, gonna testify again at the NCI.

01:43:43.601 --> 01:43:46.924
And so it's just, I don't know, I'm having trouble.

01:43:47.084 --> 01:43:51.408
I'm having trouble because I'm not convinced of the people that are on the white horses right now.

01:43:52.389 --> 01:43:54.251
And so that puts me in a weird situation.

01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:59.455
That's why I'm, as of tomorrow, I'm pivoting exclusively to teaching biology and,

01:44:00.464 --> 01:44:03.687
Not going to worry about the people too much anymore, at least not as my main focus.

01:44:04.929 --> 01:44:06.651
It's been a long time, but I got to let them go.

01:44:06.671 --> 01:44:10.755
Is that breaking news you just put on the Levine show right there that you're going to?

01:44:10.775 --> 01:44:11.375
I kind of did.

01:44:11.415 --> 01:44:17.001
Yeah, I mean, everybody that's been following me knows that I'm starting my classes tomorrow, but it's for the most part.

01:44:17.021 --> 01:44:18.363
Yeah, it's kind of breaking news, I guess.

01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:22.837
We'll make sure we get a link to it so that we can go ahead and put that in the description as well.

01:44:22.997 --> 01:44:25.879
And that's certainly part of the trouble here.

01:44:27.079 --> 01:44:28.981
Everybody on the same side, are there sides?

01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:30.061
How many sides are there?

01:44:31.202 --> 01:44:36.645
One person, especially when it comes to experts and medical, there's always going to be people who agree and disagree.

01:44:37.385 --> 01:44:38.686
Einstein had to deal with that, right?

01:44:38.826 --> 01:44:42.827
And there was a hundred scientists that wrote a book to try and discredit him.

01:44:42.927 --> 01:44:48.229
And then I think his comment, or at least the comment attributed to him, is it would only take one person to prove me wrong.

01:44:48.249 --> 01:44:50.370
It doesn't take a hundred of you to write a book.

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:53.791
But in either case, this is always going to be the case.

01:44:53.851 --> 01:44:54.512
Who do we trust?

01:44:54.572 --> 01:44:55.612
The mainstream narrative.

01:44:55.672 --> 01:44:57.853
Do we trust a counter-scientist?

01:44:57.873 --> 01:44:59.653
Do we trust a counter-counter-scientist?

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:04.075
This is a tough one for laymen like us to try and deal with.

01:45:04.095 --> 01:45:06.236
So I'm glad people like you exist, Jonathan.

01:45:06.756 --> 01:45:07.397
It helps a lot.

01:45:08.017 --> 01:45:12.660
And I think the answer to it is listen to a whole bunch of sources and try and understand it.

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.761
Don't just listen to it, but try and understand it.

01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:17.843
And then you can apply your own reasoning to it as well.

01:45:17.883 --> 01:45:24.607
Yeah, that's why I've pivoted to this thing that you said in the beginning, the biology coach, because I don't want to be a teacher.

01:45:25.628 --> 01:45:27.089
What I want to do is treat

01:45:29.738 --> 01:45:33.402
You know, I can't do the reading for you, and the reading must be done.

01:45:33.482 --> 01:45:44.134
And just like a physical fitness trainer cannot do the exercises for you, they can only encourage you, they can always give you alternative exercises that can build you up to the exercises you want to do.

01:45:44.975 --> 01:45:52.557
And so for me, I'm trying to reorient the way that I think about my biology class, and what I'm going to do.

01:45:52.637 --> 01:45:53.918
I don't like the word teacher.

01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:54.878
I don't want to be a teacher.

01:45:54.898 --> 01:45:55.678
I want to be a coach.

01:45:55.738 --> 01:46:08.882
I want to teach you a way of, or share with you a way of approaching biology, and a way of digesting it, and a way of thinking about it, and of processing it, so that you don't process it the way

01:46:09.682 --> 01:46:16.404
that the national security state would like you to process it, the way that Joshua Lederberg and all these guys would like you to process it.

01:46:16.484 --> 01:46:30.989
And I think if I succeed, it will be a pretty cool thing because I do think that, and not to toot my own horn, but it's more to tell everybody why it's taken me so damn long, is because I think I'm going to try to teach a biology class that hasn't been taught before.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.541
And that's a little weird.

01:46:33.882 --> 01:46:40.447
You know, to teach biology in a little bit different way is a pretty big claim, but I don't know what else I would be doing if I'm going to do it.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.869
I'm not going to do a normal biology class.

01:46:42.909 --> 01:46:48.033
And so it's taken me an awful long time to get to the point where I think I have something.

01:46:48.073 --> 01:46:49.474
And so I'm excited about tomorrow.

01:46:49.514 --> 01:46:50.335
It's going to be a big day.

01:46:51.356 --> 01:46:53.718
Can you give us a little taste of the first one's free?

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:54.318
What is it?

01:46:54.358 --> 01:46:54.678
Yeah.

01:46:54.778 --> 01:46:57.461
I mean, it's a, it's a reorientation.

01:46:57.841 --> 01:47:01.324
I did it on somebody else's stream a little bit, but, um,

01:47:03.185 --> 01:47:11.112
If I just mime it out, this is like a regular biology book, freshman level in college biology book.

01:47:11.292 --> 01:47:21.500
And I think the way that I was taught to read a biology book and the way that academic biology at the PhD level teaches you to read papers is the same way.

01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:31.488
You read that every paper you read or in this book, every chapter that you read, you should read it as, oh, they understand this.

01:47:32.478 --> 01:47:33.639
Oh, and they understand that.

01:47:33.699 --> 01:47:33.939
Wow.

01:47:34.039 --> 01:47:35.140
Oh, and they understand this.

01:47:35.361 --> 01:47:36.542
Oh, and they understand that too.

01:47:36.782 --> 01:47:37.142
Oh, wow.

01:47:37.182 --> 01:47:38.804
They understand so much.

01:47:38.864 --> 01:47:41.666
I mean, this book is huge and these pictures are great.

01:47:41.686 --> 01:47:42.727
They understand that too.

01:47:43.007 --> 01:47:43.548
Oh my gosh.

01:47:43.588 --> 01:47:45.189
I can't believe how much they understand.

01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:49.974
And that's how doctors read the primary literature.

01:47:50.034 --> 01:47:53.697
That's how PhD biologists read the primary literature.

01:47:53.857 --> 01:47:54.197
Oh, wow.

01:47:54.238 --> 01:47:55.278
Look what they figured out.

01:47:56.039 --> 01:47:58.400
Oh, there's another paper, look what that paper proved.

01:47:58.961 --> 01:48:01.782
Oh my gosh, that paper shows that T cells do this.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.684
Oh, that paper shows that macrophages did this.

01:48:05.224 --> 01:48:10.547
And so each one of these chapters, each one of these papers becomes something else that they know.

01:48:11.327 --> 01:48:22.093
And what that creates is a false sense of fidelity and a false sense of certainty and a false sense of what's left in terms of the unknown.

01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:23.914
And it's a...

01:48:24.924 --> 01:48:38.961
very much more logical and very much more reverent to the sacred biology that is us, the irreducible complexity that makes our kids beautiful, to read it like, oh wow, it's pretty complicated.

01:48:39.614 --> 01:48:41.416
Oh, wait, it's even more complicated.

01:48:41.636 --> 01:48:43.317
Oh my gosh, it's so complicated.

01:48:43.438 --> 01:48:45.039
Oh, man, no way.

01:48:45.499 --> 01:48:46.520
It's even more complicated.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.021
No.

01:48:47.781 --> 01:48:50.844
Oh, they don't have a chance of figuring it out if it's even this complicated.

01:48:51.004 --> 01:48:58.611
Oh, and as you read more papers, it should become even more complicated because the watch has yet another set of gears that you didn't know was there.

01:48:59.112 --> 01:49:02.234
And the watch has another face that you didn't know was there.

01:49:02.254 --> 01:49:03.796
And it's got another hidden function.

01:49:04.236 --> 01:49:05.257
that you didn't know was there.

01:49:05.657 --> 01:49:12.042
Every one of these details is not a higher fidelity of understanding.

01:49:12.082 --> 01:49:19.567
It's another part that we didn't know was there that we now have to account for in our model that didn't have it before and now has to have it.

01:49:20.047 --> 01:49:24.531
And the crazy part is that all of these questions are asked

01:49:25.251 --> 01:49:27.173
in the context of reductionism.

01:49:27.693 --> 01:49:31.336
They only want you to pay attention to a couple of these gears at a time.

01:49:31.776 --> 01:49:41.243
And as long as you pay attention to a couple of these gears every time, then their explanation for why this one turns once and this one turns three times is perfectly logical.

01:49:41.703 --> 01:49:46.707
But once they admit that, well, in between these two gears is actually these 47 other ones,

01:49:48.513 --> 01:49:53.177
then you realize that their understanding of those two gears is actually not very good at all.

01:49:53.657 --> 01:50:08.669
And the point of biology should be to impress on students and doctors that what this book represents is the humility you should have and the reverence you have for the system you're trying to understand.

01:50:09.170 --> 01:50:15.175
It should not represent the totality of understanding or the near mastery of it.

01:50:15.955 --> 01:50:16.896
And that's, I think,

01:50:18.661 --> 01:50:42.506
I think people like Buckminster Fuller were very, very good at respecting biology and chemistry in this way, that the emergent properties of biology and chemistry that we call life are not ever going to be understood in the way that we understand a watch or an automobile or a computer.

01:50:43.487 --> 01:50:44.587
And so all of these...

01:50:45.982 --> 01:50:58.052
All of these mythologies in public health, for example, they at best become a computer, they at best become some kind of machine.

01:50:58.713 --> 01:51:09.182
And this is always going to fall woefully short of even scratching the surface of what we are and what our children are as they move through time and develop into adults.

01:51:09.302 --> 01:51:13.305
And the idea that you can just inject a few things intramuscularly

01:51:14.326 --> 01:51:20.331
to adjust the trajectory of that four-dimensional thing moving through space and time is just absurd.

01:51:20.931 --> 01:51:23.814
I mean, it's really absurd.

01:51:24.154 --> 01:51:37.985
Once you really grasp it, I really feel like no matter which way you came from this, you should be at this point basically doubting most doctors, most

01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:51.357
traditional ideas in allopathic medicine are just basically based on a huge number of assumptions that have never been verified and to the detriment of all of us.

01:51:52.884 --> 01:51:58.868
I mean, you're generally speaking, not gonna make very many errors by having that assumption.

01:51:59.428 --> 01:52:14.138
And therefore, to get all the way back to that point I was trying to make earlier, it becomes very dubious to me, anybody who's satisfied with most of it, but really upset with the fact that people don't take ivermectin.

01:52:14.178 --> 01:52:15.839
That doesn't make sense to me anymore.

01:52:15.879 --> 01:52:19.422
You should be in a panic mode at this stage because you realize how much

01:52:20.687 --> 01:52:25.174
Mythology is at risk of being passed on to the next generation right now.

01:52:25.254 --> 01:52:27.717
How much confusion is about to pass on?

01:52:28.218 --> 01:52:33.185
It's not as simple as, you know, if we would have done ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, all of this would have been avoided.

01:52:33.626 --> 01:52:37.251
It's not as simple as the lockdown should have been focused or shouldn't have been at all.

01:52:37.711 --> 01:52:40.333
And it's not as simple as the PCR was overcycled.

01:52:40.373 --> 01:53:01.832
I mean, we are talking about a very malevolent concert of lies and deception and pre-planned narratives that included having somebody like Peter Daszak on 60 Minutes 10 years ago to talk to us about bat cave viruses, to make sure that when that same person was put on the news seven years later, again on 60 Minutes, it all was

01:53:01.912 --> 01:53:03.033
and go, wow, that's crazy.

01:53:03.053 --> 01:53:04.894
That's a lot like what I saw in 2002.

01:53:05.494 --> 01:53:06.995
It reminds me of the outbreak movie.

01:53:07.295 --> 01:53:09.617
And did you ever see the beginning of the new planet of the apes?

01:53:09.657 --> 01:53:10.617
That's also a virus.

01:53:10.637 --> 01:53:11.198
That's crazy.

01:53:11.218 --> 01:53:12.419
That was like on the X-Files.

01:53:13.099 --> 01:53:20.003
And then suddenly it seems very plausible and not only very plausible, but it seems natural because we've been talking about it our whole lives.

01:53:21.084 --> 01:53:23.285
And it's all part of this same show.

01:53:23.405 --> 01:53:25.106
And that's really what's terrifying.

01:53:25.166 --> 01:53:27.068
It is really part of the same show.

01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:29.732
And they did it with AIDS.

01:53:29.792 --> 01:53:34.616
That's the reason why Tony Fauci's there for the whole show as well.

01:53:34.676 --> 01:53:36.537
This has all been part of the same thing.

01:53:36.637 --> 01:53:37.358
It's extraordinary.

01:53:38.941 --> 01:53:44.065
When you were describing biology, you gave me the shivers because the legal system is very similar to that.

01:53:44.685 --> 01:53:50.609
You have case law, then you have appeals, and then you have one referencing another one, and then it's a big mess.

01:53:50.649 --> 01:53:57.354
And then in the end, the Superior Court or Supreme Court overrules it, and each case is different, and you got to kind of address it.

01:53:57.454 --> 01:54:01.396
And you think the law is the law, but no, the law is very malleable.

01:54:01.476 --> 01:54:02.937
It is applied in different ways.

01:54:03.037 --> 01:54:04.819
It depends on who's the judge.

01:54:04.939 --> 01:54:06.760
It depends on the day of the week sometimes.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:12.082
It depends on who believes in judicial notice and who actually is a good litigator.

01:54:12.102 --> 01:54:17.385
Like, there's so many variables that there's no such thing as the law is the law, and it's equally applied.

01:54:18.005 --> 01:54:21.487
So when you were talking about that, I'm like, oh, it's just like the legal system.

01:54:21.887 --> 01:54:23.768
From one province to another, it's different.

01:54:24.528 --> 01:54:26.189
One state to another, one country to another.

01:54:26.269 --> 01:54:27.730
We're all very different when it comes to that.

01:54:29.508 --> 01:54:29.828
Similar?

01:54:29.848 --> 01:54:34.150
It's fractally more complex in life.

01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.690
That's all.

01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:41.092
I mean, the legal system has a certain number of gears and a certain number of layers that involves the courts and the people and whatever.

01:54:41.172 --> 01:54:56.878
But I think the main thing to grasp as a biology coach, my message would be to never think that we have even approached identifying most of the gears.

01:54:57.705 --> 01:55:00.647
You know, I mean, most of the gears are yet to be discovered.

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:17.256
And I think one of the gears that we've been lied to about the most consistently is this gear of RNA and this idea that we have DNA gets translated into RNA and the RNA gets made into protein and everything else is other stuff.

01:55:18.157 --> 01:55:23.520
And I think there are enough examples in general biology now where cells in our body

01:55:24.574 --> 01:55:44.202
package RNA and send it to other cells in the body for us to assume that that is a very natural and ongoing process that happens in almost all cell types for a wide variety of reasons, including communicating about current metabolism with other tissues.

01:55:44.482 --> 01:55:49.024
It could be communicating current metabolic state with the brain.

01:55:49.264 --> 01:55:52.686
It can be communicating the current metabolic state with the immune system.

01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:56.767
And it could also communicate a pathological state to the immune system.

01:55:56.807 --> 01:56:04.328
And all of these communication pathways are real and exist in us, in health and in disease.

01:56:04.988 --> 01:56:22.952
What that means is this signal that they have misconstrued as retroviruses like AIDS or coronaviruses like coronavirus or signals that are coming from cancer are also considered exosomes.

01:56:23.427 --> 01:56:26.629
These are all part of the same cellular machinery.

01:56:26.789 --> 01:56:32.632
And virology has told us that this machinery is not ours, that it belongs to viruses.

01:56:32.692 --> 01:56:45.838
And the main reason why they have to tell us that is so that they can study it, so that they can manipulate it, so that they can investigate it without us ever realizing that it's part of our own biology.

01:56:46.238 --> 01:56:50.661
If they told us that they were experimenting with

01:56:52.326 --> 01:57:05.591
injections from animals, and that those animals' immune systems had retroviruses in those injections, and those retroviruses caused a maladaptive disease state in the people that we injected those in.

01:57:06.251 --> 01:57:19.535
And by accident, we discovered that our immune system uses retroviruses, and in fact, so do related monkeys, and that can be very bad when it comes to mixing blood and tissue of related animals.

01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:21.376
And we just discovered it by accident.

01:57:23.925 --> 01:57:26.407
That would have been a disaster, but instead what did they do?

01:57:26.447 --> 01:57:31.372
They told you that it was AIDS and that there was this new disease spreading, but it wasn't a new disease.

01:57:31.432 --> 01:57:32.153
I'm sure of it.

01:57:32.693 --> 01:57:38.879
It was a mistake or not an accident, but just kind of what happened when they injected

01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:46.224
very related animal materials into these people to see what happened, to call it a hepatitis vaccine.

01:57:46.244 --> 01:57:48.245
I don't care what you, how you explain it.

01:57:48.985 --> 01:57:56.429
What happened was that exosomes from a related species caused a very maladaptive reaction in the immune system of the humans that

01:57:57.148 --> 01:57:58.229
received the injection.

01:57:58.289 --> 01:58:05.052
And by that, we discovered that our bodies use viruses to regulate the immune system.

01:58:05.092 --> 01:58:12.716
It's probably very likely that the immune system uses retroviruses all the time and that that's an actual national security secret.

01:58:12.736 --> 01:58:13.557
It sounds crazy.

01:58:14.157 --> 01:58:27.344
But right now, they tell us that the immune system only uses chemokines and cytokines to communicate between these millions of autonomous cells that somehow are able to simultaneously change their genetic signals at will.

01:58:27.824 --> 01:58:35.768
And this actually could easily be coordinated by distributed signaling, a packet-like genetic material, i.e.

01:58:36.348 --> 01:58:36.889
exosomes.

01:58:36.949 --> 01:58:38.209
Now, why is this important?

01:58:39.010 --> 01:58:43.292
It's important because what this means is that virology is not fake.

01:58:44.582 --> 01:59:06.903
but it has been misconstrued as exclusively foreign, when in fact it's very likely that over half of the RNA signals that are circulating in our body and circulating on and through our body are actually signals that are being shared by the bacteria on our skin and on our mucous membranes and our epithelium.

01:59:07.645 --> 01:59:36.200
And so those signals are also completely ignored by the public health sector, even though there's no doubt that if you took a bacteriophage that was coding for a small toxic protein, and then you took that bacteriophage and used traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing processes to make a lot of that bacteriophage, and the reason why I use that example, of course, circles back all the way to the case I told you about an hour ago in California,

01:59:36.795 --> 01:59:48.202
where the California municipality was using a PCR test provided by China that used a bacteriophage encoding the spike protein as the control.

01:59:48.823 --> 01:59:56.348
And so they can make, using commercial methods, large quantities of bacteriophage that encode the spike protein.

01:59:56.388 --> 02:00:06.014
If the spike protein was mildly toxic and could cause an immunogenic reaction, then that same bacteriophage sprayed into the air and inhaled

02:00:06.594 --> 02:00:11.477
would probably infect the bacteria in your lungs or infect the bacteria in your gut.

02:00:11.957 --> 02:00:13.778
And that's actually called transduction.

02:00:14.178 --> 02:00:15.739
They would trans, is it transduction?

02:00:15.759 --> 02:00:16.620
Yeah, transduction.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:20.822
They would transduce those bacteria to express the spike protein.

02:00:21.322 --> 02:00:23.884
And then you would have an immune reaction to the spike protein.

02:00:23.904 --> 02:00:34.370
And quite frankly, I don't think it would be molecularly differentiatable by PCR from the presence of the coronavirus if you only looked for the spike protein, because you'd find it.

02:00:35.123 --> 02:00:49.921
Not only that, but if you used a bacteriophage to distribute the RNA or the DNA, then your PCR signal would be much hotter than anything that would be expected from what was a traditional coronavirus signal before the 2020s.

02:00:51.562 --> 02:01:12.044
So essentially what I'm saying is that there are very well-known molecular biological mechanisms by which, and methods by which, a signal of high fidelity could be seeded anywhere they wanted it to be seeded, and could be produced in any place they wanted it to be produced, without ever using a virus that

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:20.923
could be misconstrued as denied, you know, like a coronavirus, you can argue has never been isolated, or they don't sequence it or whatever, because it's true.

02:01:21.404 --> 02:01:23.965
It's usually just a genetic proxy signal.

02:01:24.446 --> 02:01:27.928
But bacteriophages, no one, no one argues

02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:30.021
that bacteriophages are fake.

02:01:30.682 --> 02:01:34.383
Not one, no virus person will say that there are no bacteriophages.

02:01:34.443 --> 02:01:38.184
They all agree that there's plenty of proof for bacteriophages.

02:01:38.664 --> 02:01:52.149
That means that there's a giant background signal of RNA and DNA, mostly DNA, that is being circulated around the world between all of the bacteria that are in the soil, in the air, in the water, in our gut, on our skin.

02:01:52.749 --> 02:01:54.650
And those signals are not nothing.

02:01:55.370 --> 02:02:04.419
If they rolled out a PCR signal that could be positive on that background and misconstrued it as spread, it is the exact same thing as the car analogy I gave you before.

02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.580
So there is a...

02:02:06.926 --> 02:02:25.474
whole host of real biological phenomenon, real biological signals in the context of bacteria and bacteriophages that could be misconstrued either as a gain-of-function signal, as a natural signal, could be misconstrued as a spreading signal that's really a background signal.

02:02:25.914 --> 02:02:36.299
And none of this would contradict the idea that these no-virus people that are putting forward that there was no coronavirus, that the coronavirus was made up, that the sequence was planted or

02:02:36.779 --> 02:02:38.240
that they lie about metagenomics.

02:02:38.461 --> 02:02:55.715
All of those things can still be true and there could still be a bacteriophage that was manufactured, that was planted, that was seeded, that gave the perfect signal, that made people sick, that was associated with the spike protein, that allowed them to say that the spike protein was also going to be in our shots because that's what we found.

02:02:56.155 --> 02:03:00.898
and that could have even been sequenced and misconstrued as the presence of a coronavirus.

02:03:00.918 --> 02:03:00.978
Why?

02:03:01.438 --> 02:03:06.741
Because before the pandemic, the presence of a novel spike protein was enough for one of these people to declare it.

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:27.665
So if you made what the Chinese company made and shared with that California municipality, which was just a bacteriophage that encoded the spike protein, and you took that bacteriophage and put it in somebody's water, I don't see why it wouldn't start expressing the spike protein in their gut.

02:03:28.516 --> 02:03:30.516
and that that spike protein might make you sick.

02:03:31.017 --> 02:03:32.697
It would show up PCR positive.

02:03:33.077 --> 02:03:34.537
It might show up in your sputum.

02:03:34.597 --> 02:03:36.558
It might be in your lungs if you inhaled it.

02:03:36.918 --> 02:03:44.840
These are all very well-known ways to get these signals where they would be and to get them to propagate, maybe even to get them to be coughed out.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.041
And those bacteriophages would be live when they went into someone else's lungs or in someone else's guts.

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:56.459
And so these things are just completely, completely off the discussion table.

02:03:56.479 --> 02:03:57.579
And you know what's really weird?

02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:59.280
You know who discovered them?

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:00.861
Joshua Lederberg.

02:04:02.014 --> 02:04:15.240
That guy that I told you invented the name microbiome, the guy that helped get Kerry Mullis the credit for the PCR, that guy's the guy who discovered all that stuff and described it first and led to a lot of our understanding of it.

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:26.925
And so that guy's also the guy who hypothesized most likely that there would be a very similar mechanism by which packages of genetic material would be exchanged between healthy cells in our own bodies.

02:04:27.628 --> 02:04:48.066
And so it's so easy for me to imagine how a guy like Joshua Lederberg, with the plan of getting us to accept willingly our own testing and our own monitoring, would have a very clever way of taking most of the biology that they wanted to study and pretending like it wasn't a part of us.

02:04:50.814 --> 02:05:17.431
Yeah, I really think the way that this biology can be taught so that people look at the totality in a different way so that they can see why the oversimplification upon which all of public health assumptions are based is just a malevolent set of assumptions, I think we can save a lot of people in the coming years.

02:05:17.731 --> 02:05:18.552
It's really exciting.

02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:27.505
And it's really, it's really simple too, because again, it's, it's just presenting general biology in a different way.

02:05:27.545 --> 02:05:32.514
So I don't, I don't think I have to reinvent every wheel, but I just have to spin it in a slightly different way.

02:05:34.261 --> 02:05:35.382
Thanks for providing that.

02:05:35.422 --> 02:05:37.123
You're going to be a great biology coach.

02:05:37.683 --> 02:05:40.606
I can hear you guiding a whole bunch of people.

02:05:40.786 --> 02:05:42.307
So hopefully that's very successful.

02:05:43.007 --> 02:05:48.111
Um, in the future, we'll bring it back, maybe talk about how that course is going so that we can share some more of that information.

02:05:48.131 --> 02:05:50.833
Uh, apologies that Kayla didn't make it.

02:05:51.333 --> 02:05:56.497
Uh, she did let me know her nurse was going to be there and when she can, she'll join, but unfortunately it appears that she couldn't join.

02:05:56.897 --> 02:05:58.739
So we'll make that connection behind the scenes.

02:05:58.779 --> 02:06:00.280
Cause she was really excited to meet you.

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:04.441
And maybe in the future we can bring her back and have you back as well.

02:06:04.762 --> 02:06:07.222
But I don't want to delay her, like she wants to speak to you.

02:06:07.242 --> 02:06:12.344
So I'm sure she'll watch this episode, have a bunch of questions and we'll connect the two of you if you don't mind.

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:13.185
Cool.

02:06:13.305 --> 02:06:13.925
Yeah, absolutely.

02:06:13.945 --> 02:06:14.245
Yep.

02:06:15.445 --> 02:06:15.906
No, thank you.

02:06:16.166 --> 02:06:17.526
So hang on for just a second or two.

02:06:17.546 --> 02:06:19.007
I'm going to jump over to our members area.

02:06:19.027 --> 02:06:20.207
There's a few questions for you.

02:06:21.348 --> 02:06:22.808
Way beyond my understanding.

02:06:22.868 --> 02:06:27.530
So, so I want to address them with you, but just hang on for a second, Jonathan, and we're going to say goodbye to the public.

02:06:28.032 --> 02:06:28.212
Sure.

02:06:28.332 --> 02:06:28.872
All right, public.

02:06:28.972 --> 02:06:29.593
Well, there you go.

02:06:29.613 --> 02:06:31.154
So we'll roll with the punches here.

02:06:31.174 --> 02:06:38.657
We had quite the crash course, just a taste of the, uh, biology that, uh, Jonathan can teach, not teach, coach you on.

02:06:39.077 --> 02:06:41.559
So you do go check out that course and see what it's all about.

02:06:42.199 --> 02:06:45.921
And I, I learned a lot and it's still a lot that I don't understand.

02:06:46.001 --> 02:06:47.562
So I'm going to rewatch this episode as well.

02:06:47.942 --> 02:06:50.363
And I may throw you a few questions via email, if you don't mind.

02:06:51.584 --> 02:06:52.945
Public, have yourself a great day.

02:06:52.965 --> 02:06:53.906
You take care of each other.

02:06:53.926 --> 02:06:56.429
And we're going to move over to the members-only area.

02:06:56.489 --> 02:06:58.791
Remember, you can go to thelevineshow.com, get yourself started.

02:06:59.192 --> 02:07:02.075
