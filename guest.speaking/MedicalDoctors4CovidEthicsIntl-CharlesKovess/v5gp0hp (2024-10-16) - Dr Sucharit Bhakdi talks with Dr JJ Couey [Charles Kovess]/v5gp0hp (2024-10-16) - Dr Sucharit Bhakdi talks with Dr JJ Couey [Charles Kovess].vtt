00:03.857 --> 00:18.606
Welcome to Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International, and today's special format of discussion, which will be a discussion between two experts in the field, J.J.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.708
Cooey and Sukrit Bhakti.

00:21.769 --> 00:25.431
Both of them have presented on a number of occasions to us.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.212
We're so grateful that they have.

00:27.232 --> 00:30.454
And this group was founded by Dr. Stephen Frost.

00:30.674 --> 00:32.635
I'm Charles Koves, the moderator.

00:33.686 --> 00:38.307
We comprise lots of professions here, and we're from all around the world.

00:38.347 --> 00:40.988
This group has been going for over three years.

00:42.788 --> 00:51.150
Most of us understand we're in the middle of World War III, and that the medical science battle is only one of 12 battlefronts in this world war.

00:51.230 --> 01:02.433
But today we're focusing on the medical science battle, although I haven't been briefed precisely, Jay and Sukrit, how you're going to have this discussion, but we're very much looking forward to this.

01:04.261 --> 01:09.084
most of us understand the development of science and that the science is never settled.

01:10.525 --> 01:17.389
So we will listen to Jay and Sukrit for as long as they wish to discuss and then we'll have an opportunity for questions.

01:17.469 --> 01:20.731
Jay is only with us for an hour and a quarter from now.

01:22.565 --> 01:28.487
Jay, so thank you, Stephen Frost, for creating this group.

01:28.807 --> 01:30.568
Thank you, everyone, for being here.

01:31.048 --> 01:37.870
Sukrit and Jay, their CVs can be found on their presentations, so I won't go through those backgrounds.

01:38.891 --> 01:48.994
And Stephen, in terms of the format that you have discussed with Jay and Sukrit, we're just going to let them in.

01:49.614 --> 01:51.676
Charles, I'll just tell you as much as I know.

01:51.716 --> 01:57.579
So I spoke to JJ last night and to Sukrit too, but I didn't want to weigh down Sukrit.

01:57.619 --> 02:10.008
So I asked JJ what he thought and he said, could I just do a brief presentation to kind of, and obviously if Sukrit wants to do the same, that's fine.

02:10.248 --> 02:13.130
So I think JJ was thinking about 10, 15 minutes.

02:14.110 --> 02:16.272
And then I think the best thing would be if

02:17.335 --> 02:19.657
JJ and Sukrit could just talk.

02:20.137 --> 02:30.485
And I suggested to JJ that if I, you know, I think the aim of the exercise is to have a very interesting video.

02:30.505 --> 02:41.453
It doesn't, they don't have to agree on everything, but I think that make the video as interesting as possible.

02:41.753 --> 02:41.953
And,

02:42.834 --> 02:51.419
and so keeping in mind that it's a document which can be viewed by people all around the world in two years' time even, or five years' time.

02:53.560 --> 03:04.227
And I said that maybe, did I have his permission to interrupt if I thought that the meeting was going a little bit astray as far as what I think the public need to know?

03:05.147 --> 03:07.250
Absolutely, and I think that's fine.

03:07.630 --> 03:13.877
Yes, maybe Sukrit wouldn't agree, but I'll try not to interrupt Sukrit and JJ.

03:15.819 --> 03:16.600
Sure, go ahead.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.366
So if everybody's agreeing that I'm starting, I'm ready.

03:22.726 --> 03:24.968
Are you happy with that, Sigrid?

03:25.088 --> 03:25.888
You don't have to agree.

03:25.989 --> 03:26.629
Sure, sure.

03:27.129 --> 03:28.530
I'm happy with almost everything.

03:29.371 --> 03:36.096
If you are not seeing my screen now and me on my screen, then when I switch over here, you won't see me either.

03:37.037 --> 03:37.938
Yes, we can see that.

03:37.978 --> 03:39.419
Okay, Jay, it's okay.

03:40.319 --> 03:42.000
If you need to, you got to go to speaker view.

03:42.841 --> 03:49.445
So I come to you, Sukrit, and I'm going to make this a personal message because everyone here has seen me a lot of times.

03:49.485 --> 03:50.726
So we're all good friends here.

03:51.747 --> 03:57.851
But Sukrit and I actually first crossed paths in the original Doctors for COVID Ethics before it blew up.

03:58.651 --> 04:06.357
And I remember that those first few meetings very well, because the first time that I clicked on that Zoom meeting, and I saw you and

04:07.277 --> 04:10.959
And Wolfgang Wodock, I actually thought it wasn't going to last very much longer.

04:11.199 --> 04:16.622
And I'm coming to you as an American because I think America is actually under attack.

04:17.022 --> 04:27.147
I think we're being undermined from the inside by traders who are collaborating with other people in other nations that have similar problems to manage.

04:28.087 --> 04:49.078
And so I start this stream with like, or this explanation with like a little bit of words that have Fauci behind them and a little smoke, because I think there's a 30,000 foot message here that at the start of the pandemic, they convinced us to go home and get on social media and argue with the people that they put in front of us and argue about what they were arguing about.

04:49.739 --> 04:56.663
And by doing that, we actually accepted the premises of their narrative that included this crazy novel virus that everybody was vulnerable to.

04:57.523 --> 05:02.984
And this theater actually spans almost the entire mythology of what we've been following.

05:03.564 --> 05:08.345
And unfortunately for me as an American, a lot of my history is part of this mythology.

05:08.405 --> 05:14.926
We have been governed by stories about what we're doing in different countries and what we mean to do there and how we're spending our money.

05:15.446 --> 05:24.428
And we have been behind our TVs and cheering for our sports teams, not realizing that our government was out of our control for the last two or three decades.

05:25.268 --> 05:30.913
And so for me, it's very, very important to emphasize that I was particularly trapped on Twitter.

05:31.494 --> 05:38.540
And because Twitter was presented to me as this place where people were getting away with giving out information that the government didn't want them to give away with.

05:39.141 --> 05:45.927
And I got tied in with all of these people that have risen to be international heroes at COVID summits and

05:46.447 --> 05:48.448
and giving speeches in front of crowds.

05:48.528 --> 05:50.769
And all of these people know who I am.

05:50.789 --> 05:55.951
A lot of them even take selfies with me, but none of them will talk about the biology that I've come to understand.

05:56.911 --> 06:00.532
And if you can hear the noise there, that's the guy in that chair.

06:01.393 --> 06:12.317
For five years, I thought I was fighting Tony Fauci and Deborah Birx and the CDC and the lies that Peter Daszak had made some virus with the Chinese.

06:12.357 --> 06:14.818
And I thought I was fighting them by promoting these people.

06:16.179 --> 06:21.686
by trying to get on their podcast, by trying to argue with them, by trying to get them to notice me.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.171
And what I didn't realize was that was all part of that big game.

06:25.191 --> 06:29.617
And I don't want you to underestimate how much

06:30.979 --> 06:34.201
sort of UFO-like pain I've been through.

06:34.221 --> 06:37.564
And when I say UFO-like pain, I mean, I was totally in.

06:37.624 --> 06:39.565
I wanted to be a tenure track professor.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.666
I was a biologist.

06:41.146 --> 06:43.108
I wanted to learn the university system.

06:43.148 --> 06:44.769
I wanted to learn how to write grants.

06:45.309 --> 06:51.934
And so I would have given anything to keep my job at the beginning of the pandemic, but I also knew that something crazy was going on.

06:52.294 --> 06:55.917
And so at the beginning of the pandemic, I ended up getting fired from

06:56.437 --> 06:58.479
the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

06:58.499 --> 07:08.350
And as far as I know, I'm the only person in America that actually lost a job in 2020 with a track record of just doing academic biology and trying to make it.

07:08.410 --> 07:13.696
And in fact, my CV includes a Nobel Prize winning lab and five papers with them.

07:13.756 --> 07:17.720
So it's a little bit dubious for me that I'm the only

07:18.781 --> 07:19.942
I don't want to toot my own horn.

07:19.982 --> 07:26.364
I want you to see how desperate it is in America that actually all the Americans that have risen as heroes didn't lose anything.

07:27.064 --> 07:31.846
And in fact, my resume includes a whole year where I was employed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

07:32.006 --> 07:34.447
and Children's Health Defense to help him write this book.

07:34.967 --> 07:38.108
And you can even see my name in the acknowledgments.

07:38.268 --> 07:45.571
And I worked for Children's Health Defense afterward for another six months before they fired me for talking about Robert Malone on my stream.

07:46.431 --> 07:59.541
And so I have been trying to teach people to understand that what they told us on the TV and in social media is not the truth, but also that I don't know what the truth is.

07:59.782 --> 08:00.982
I only know that they're lying.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.404
So I'm sorry I'm goofing around a little bit.

08:02.424 --> 08:04.785
I'm trying to get this window a little smaller there so I can see.

08:05.746 --> 08:18.292
I'd just like to say something that, from my perspective, we've had hundreds of guests on this channel, and so I've got used to listening to people saying various things about what's happened in the last four and a half years.

08:19.113 --> 08:27.117
And Sukrit Bhakti, Professor Dr. Sukrit Bhakti, Thai-German, and you, JJ Cooey, Dr. JJ Cooey, PhD,

08:28.567 --> 08:31.029
are the outstanding people on our side.

08:31.749 --> 08:34.050
Maybe Mike Eden as well.

08:34.311 --> 08:41.274
He was invited tonight, but I thought that he was a little bit hard to get, but he always is like that.

08:41.334 --> 08:45.096
So I thought actually it would benefit tonight.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.958
It would be good to have just you and

08:48.038 --> 09:02.404
Sukrit anyway and we can have Mike Eden another time but I think he's up there with you too but I think everyone in the world should listen to what you two have to say because I think from my perspective as a British medical doctor

09:03.685 --> 09:14.973
You are the two outstanding experts on COVID-19 and whether there was a pandemic or not, and whether there was in fact a disease called COVID-19, whether there was a new respiratory disease.

09:15.394 --> 09:17.996
I think you are the two guys who can work it out together.

09:18.902 --> 09:19.622
Thank you very much.

09:19.702 --> 09:22.164
And I think we have to work it out together as a story.

09:22.204 --> 09:28.468
And so the current narrative that all of us, most of us have been brought to understand is crucial.

09:28.568 --> 09:39.734
And if you watch this list and think about it as I read it, it should really bring into focus how even both sides of our countries have basically come to accept a middle ground narrative.

09:39.774 --> 09:40.475
The first one is,

09:41.115 --> 09:45.637
that the truth was definitely censored on social media in 2020 and 2021.

09:45.697 --> 09:55.360
The other part of this narrative is that a novel virus swept the world, including twice in 2021, because there was a variant and then there was Omicron, and everybody got both of those.

09:56.280 --> 10:02.963
The shortage or overuse, depending on who you talk to, sometimes it was a shortage, sometimes it was overuse of ventilators killed people.

10:03.663 --> 10:09.265
There was no expected rise of all cause mortality, all the novel deaths, all the excess deaths,

10:09.805 --> 10:12.709
in these countries were a result of this novel virus.

10:13.590 --> 10:23.781
We rushed the rollout of this new technology, and that saved people, but we made a lot of mistakes with it, and now it's starting to come out what kinds of mistakes we might have made by rushing it.

10:24.722 --> 10:40.099
And then once we stop using this toxic spike protein, when once we clean up the DNA contamination, the methodology of transfection, which is what it was called when it was sold as many different products before 2020, transfection is good to go to use in humans forever.

10:40.119 --> 10:41.281
That's where we are.

10:41.761 --> 10:44.865
And in fact, we are where most people have come to accept that

10:45.305 --> 10:54.133
The old vaccines and the new vaccines remain a wonderfully, wonderful, great way to augment the immune system via intramuscular injection.

10:54.193 --> 10:58.577
That's where most people on the planet are in most Western countries.

10:58.637 --> 11:11.629
And this terrifies me because after five years going from a complete naive academic biologist to a full-blown skeptic, I've come to understand biology

11:13.044 --> 11:15.885
well enough to be able to explain why this isn't true.

11:15.985 --> 11:33.173
So if you take this, and I just want to make sure we're doing all the same mental exercise here, if you take this and try to explain this little part of the graph down here, if you can see my arrow, this little part of the graph down here, if you try to explain it with a pie graph, what you might do is say that the red is 32% COVID,

11:35.234 --> 11:37.815
The yellow is vents and protocols.

11:37.855 --> 11:38.796
We killed some people.

11:39.656 --> 11:43.698
The vaccines are now hurting a lot of people, and they hurt a lot of people after 2021.

11:44.859 --> 11:47.020
And then, of course, there are just these people that died.

11:47.060 --> 11:51.722
And so that's how the mainstream narrative would explain what happened here.

11:51.742 --> 11:52.542
We had a virus.

11:53.123 --> 11:54.363
We also had a response.

11:54.443 --> 11:55.484
Some of it was botched.

11:55.864 --> 11:58.685
Some people committed suicide because of the lockdown, all that stuff.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.286
That's all wrapped up in here.

12:00.326 --> 12:03.468
And we have all come to accept that that's just what happens when there's a crisis.

12:04.676 --> 12:07.777
Now, I would argue that that's absolutely not the case.

12:07.817 --> 12:09.078
Let's start with the first one.

12:09.178 --> 12:12.979
Truth wasn't censored on Twitter and social media.

12:13.039 --> 12:20.321
Truth was faux-censored on Twitter, and people followed the people who got to go on Tucker Carlson and complain about it.

12:20.742 --> 12:24.763
People followed the people who got censored on LinkedIn and then went to Gab.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.585
and went to Telegram and went to locals.

12:28.005 --> 12:39.394
And so actually they got us to perform several times via our phone and our social media, a literal button push to tell them that we were the dissidents and what we were doing and what we were willing to do.

12:39.795 --> 12:41.376
Were you willing to log into another

12:41.876 --> 12:42.756
another platform?

12:42.796 --> 12:45.637
Were you willing to give your credit card again?

12:45.677 --> 12:46.357
This kind of thing.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.737
So did a novel virus sweep the world?

12:49.478 --> 12:50.138
I don't think so.

12:50.198 --> 13:03.120
I think a background noise was misconstrued as novel spread, and I can explain how that is absolutely undifferentiatable from what they say they have as 16 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.421
The shortage or overuse of ventilators killed people.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.862
I've challenged every doctor that I've ever been able to talk to to

13:11.542 --> 13:17.985
figure out whether they already knew that pure oxygen can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.

13:18.466 --> 13:24.309
Because in the literature, I have accumulated more than a thousand articles from

13:25.586 --> 13:35.091
before the pandemic, but many of them even predate 1990, where people realized that in the ICU, if you give somebody pure oxygen, they're going to go south.

13:35.171 --> 13:35.791
And why?

13:35.872 --> 13:38.333
And then they experimented with actually all the way down to 80%.

13:39.133 --> 13:47.458
If you give it to them pure, not the right way, without monitoring, you can drive them right into ARDS, which will lead to bacterial pneumonia and sepsis and everything else.

13:48.098 --> 14:00.125
And so that literature is very strangely contrasting with what we did in America, which is we had people like Pierre Corey going in front of the Senate telling people that they were low on oxygen in New York City.

14:00.165 --> 14:04.587
And the way they solved it was giving them pure oxygen up to 60 liters a minute.

14:06.789 --> 14:10.953
and this murdered people, and then they called it COVID in the hospital.

14:11.433 --> 14:15.396
There was no expected rise in all-cause mortality on the radar of any country.

14:15.436 --> 14:16.557
That's an absolute lie.

14:16.597 --> 14:33.411
We've known since the 80s that because we had big families after World War II, and then the family size slowly decreased, while at the same time, our ability to keep people alive and take care of people at end-of-life care has greatly increased in our for-profit healthcare system.

14:34.472 --> 14:44.759
Medicare is half of America's budget, and America has known for the last 15 or 20 years that if we let these baby boomers age out on Medicare, we will go bankrupt.

14:45.400 --> 14:50.664
There's footage of Ted Turner talking about this on TV in the 90s that I remembered.

14:51.204 --> 14:55.747
So this is not something that all these countries didn't know was going to happen, and guess what?

14:56.248 --> 14:58.169
The Chinese also had this problem.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.892
That's why they instituted the one-child policy in the first place.

15:01.932 --> 15:12.640
So we were at a time frame when all these countries were going to have an inconvenient level of all-cause mortality, and they had a real bona fide reason to manage it.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.263
So we rushed out a new technology.

15:15.323 --> 15:15.864
No, we didn't.

15:16.405 --> 15:20.951
We rushed it out in the guise of a crisis so that we could hide the expected downsides.

15:20.991 --> 15:23.975
We've always known transfection wouldn't work in healthy humans.

15:24.436 --> 15:28.862
That's why it was only tested on cancer patients and other people that were going to die before the pandemic.

15:29.463 --> 15:39.985
So we accept this technology and we'll never be able to evaluate vaccination again because it starts to become a platform where you substitute what you put in as a cassette.

15:40.045 --> 15:46.947
And so they're casting a spell on you to think that once this methodology is proven, then we can put any Lego we want in there.

15:47.387 --> 15:53.248
And if that Lego is bad, well, we'll just fix the Lego instead of fixing the methodology when the methodology was bunk from the start.

15:53.948 --> 15:56.011
So vaccines remain a wonderfully great way?

15:56.031 --> 15:56.992
I would say no.

15:57.072 --> 16:02.899
I would say intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

16:03.679 --> 16:06.903
If there are exceptions to that rule, then let's find them.

16:06.923 --> 16:10.507
But I don't think there are very many, and none of them have to do with viruses.

16:11.168 --> 16:12.470
Now, if this is the truth,

16:13.752 --> 16:25.735
then we would explain what happened in 2020 and 2021 very differently, because we would have expected a rise in all-cause mortality in all of these countries that agreed to the new normal and build back better.

16:26.656 --> 16:31.157
All these countries had exactly the same problem, and so they expected a lot of people to die.

16:31.717 --> 16:37.959
And so what better way to manage these people than to murder them instead of keep them alive for the last year of their life?

16:38.439 --> 16:58.341
And so many countries had this problem, it's very hard to underestimate how easily they could have done it if they just used pure oxygen, or if they just starved people in the hospitals of Scotland, in the care homes of Scotland, or let them die of thirst, or urinary tract infection, because you know, antibiotics don't work on a viral disease.

17:01.450 --> 17:05.431
So I think I can summarize this best in four basic headlines.

17:05.511 --> 17:08.112
And so I would like you to ask questions based on these headlines.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.712
And I'm going to go real quick now because I want you to have time.

17:11.593 --> 17:17.254
The biological and actuarial backgrounds have been ignored by so many actuaries and so many virologists.

17:17.314 --> 17:24.976
So I'm going to explain why there can be a background signal that we would never have known about before the pandemic simply because we weren't testing for it.

17:25.276 --> 17:28.377
And of course, what this actuarial background is.

17:29.531 --> 17:36.653
Murder in America was by opioids, number one, because we've lost almost a half a million Americans to opioids in the last four years.

17:36.693 --> 17:39.454
And you have to subtract those people from the COVID numbers.

17:39.474 --> 17:42.675
And if you do that, it's kind of like, bump, bump, ba-dum.

17:43.156 --> 17:44.196
There's not a lot left.

17:44.616 --> 17:47.697
And especially from the fact that those people are of all age groups.

17:47.737 --> 17:55.680
So the perceived decrease in life expectancy in America isn't from COVID, as Pierre Cory and

17:56.480 --> 17:58.502
and Tony Fauci would like you to believe.

17:59.322 --> 18:04.086
Pure oxygen murdered people, no antibiotics, and using steroids also murdered people.

18:04.126 --> 18:16.314
You can ask Robert Malone about that, because he joked about that on a podcast in 2021, where he explained that people were given dexamethasone, which is a hammer for their immune system, and then sent back to care homes to die of pneumonia.

18:16.374 --> 18:16.955
Again, because

18:17.655 --> 18:19.637
Antibiotics don't work on a viral pneumonia.

18:19.717 --> 18:22.900
And then, of course, hospital neglect was all over the world.

18:23.000 --> 18:31.427
My father-in-law died of a urinary tract infection, and my sister-in-law had to take three or four vaccines in order to keep getting chemo in the Netherlands.

18:32.528 --> 18:39.053
PCR can be extremely high resolution on a university academic bench, but also nonsense for good

18:39.393 --> 18:43.996
for PCR in COVID, and none of these people in five years have been able to explain that.

18:44.576 --> 18:59.104
And finally, RNA biology does not support the premises of a pandemic, and this is a coronavirus sub-protein, and this is a drug you might be familiar with, and the only reason why any of these people can make an argument about

18:59.964 --> 19:04.407
coronavirus is being able to pandemic is because of these two little hints here.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.628
So we can talk about that too.

19:05.668 --> 19:06.969
So I'll explain it really quick.

19:07.029 --> 19:07.949
First, the biology.

19:08.810 --> 19:12.772
Everybody before the pandemic agreed that endemicity would be the scariest thing.

19:12.872 --> 19:16.755
From before the pandemic, people were talking about how if a bat cave virus gets out,

19:17.315 --> 19:25.662
The craziest thing would be as if it becomes endemic and contributes to this already terrible background of death that Mother Nature provides for us.

19:25.702 --> 19:28.984
So that is impossible to differentiate.

19:29.004 --> 19:30.025
This is endemicity.

19:30.065 --> 19:34.429
It's leaked in a mud puddle in Wuhan and suddenly it's everywhere, including in white-tailed deer.

19:35.572 --> 19:46.727
The endemicity is undifferentiated from an already existing background that the biosecurity state carefully characterized before 2020 because we don't have any data from before 2020.

19:46.908 --> 19:48.830
And isn't that convenient for them?

19:49.771 --> 19:50.613
Not one test.

19:51.815 --> 19:52.175
Nothing.

19:52.435 --> 20:05.818
Yet before, when the pandemic rolled out, I don't know if Senator Ron Johnson's aware, but at some point in 2021, we had over 200 EUA authorized diagnostics for COVID-19 that are all off the market now.

20:05.858 --> 20:06.579
They're all gone.

20:06.599 --> 20:11.940
And so the whole, the illusion of this background could have easily been sustained by any number of

20:12.760 --> 20:16.663
of, let's say, less than happy actors there.

20:16.723 --> 20:27.410
So the biological part can also be replaced by an actuarial part, because again, as I said, the population pyramid of America was top heavy.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.771
And these are bad numbers.

20:28.831 --> 20:30.212
I don't know where these numbers come from.

20:30.252 --> 20:42.380
I don't think these are probably accurate, because the real accurate numbers would show you exactly how much of a phenomenon was coming for the next five years that will go away in five years, because these old people will be gone.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.981
And they knew that was coming.

20:45.121 --> 20:48.242
I can't stress enough how all of these countries have known it was coming.

20:48.902 --> 21:02.388
And in fact, countries like the Netherlands and probably Germany, if you look into it, Canada, and China all had this problem that if they would have mismanagement of this problem would have left them with hospitals and care homes full of old people.

21:02.968 --> 21:09.670
And just countless amounts of money being spent on these, the last years of their lives.

21:09.710 --> 21:10.731
And so in America,

21:11.491 --> 21:19.877
with the opioid crisis, with supplementary oxygen, but also with lack of antibiotics, used ventilators, remdesivir, midazolam, all of these things.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.859
Do not resuscitate orders, fear, frustration, and doubt.

21:22.899 --> 21:26.742
People doing crazy stuff, yes, but they only had to do a little bit.

21:27.878 --> 21:32.122
They only had to do a little bit because the vast majority of this was expected.

21:32.182 --> 21:47.915
So if they used a military operation to sweep a few together in New York and a few other places, and then got a bunch of people on social media to scream with burning hair about it, it becomes very easy to cover up murder and lies and say that it's the start of a novel pandemic.

21:48.815 --> 21:50.056
And that's why I call it murder.

21:51.127 --> 21:53.748
And so these people are getting away with it by not talking about 2020.

21:54.408 --> 22:02.131
If you're wondering, there's a Scottish care home study and whatever that's been coming out a couple of years in a row now.

22:02.651 --> 22:05.432
It's just devastatingly obvious that they murdered people there.

22:05.812 --> 22:09.793
If you look at just the midazolam numbers for 2020, you can see the spike of murder.

22:09.813 --> 22:12.634
It's just very easy to see what they did.

22:12.674 --> 22:14.055
And it was a coordinated effort.

22:14.875 --> 22:25.524
And what's really scary is that all the people that were really into the pandemic in 2020, when I was still a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh, didn't have any of these ideas in their head.

22:26.155 --> 22:30.038
They had no idea that there was an expected rise in all-cause mortality.

22:30.078 --> 22:35.983
They had no idea that oxygen could kill people if it was given to people at 60 liters a minute.

22:36.023 --> 22:42.028
Instead, they were super fired up about a fear and cleavage site that they were sure meant that it was a gain-of-function virus.

22:42.048 --> 22:46.832
They were sure that mitochondrial damage was happening or that the virus was going up the olfactory nerve.

22:47.560 --> 23:05.571
And so all of these people were singing from the rooftops with different parts of a narrative that actually had nothing to do with what was going on, but were there just to cover up the murder and lies and make it easier for them to roll out the transfection because these same people are still in front of us in social media today.

23:05.611 --> 23:11.394
They still get in front of the Senate for the sixth time or the fourth time or whatever, they're all the same people.

23:12.035 --> 23:15.597
And these are people that are connected to this narrative, which has replaced

23:17.095 --> 23:25.608
a mystery virus Scooby-Doo story with what are actually the biology expected if they started transfecting people to new proteins.

23:26.434 --> 23:35.577
And we knew all this from all the transfection that we've done on our bench, all the transfection trials that we've done since Jesse Gelsinger and beyond in humans.

23:36.197 --> 23:40.159
We've known exactly what we needed to do in order to get this stuff out.

23:40.439 --> 23:42.199
And we needed a crisis to get it out.

23:42.800 --> 23:49.762
And we needed a crisis that we could tie all these bad things that we knew would happen anytime somebody got a hot batch and actually transfected

23:50.993 --> 23:51.995
with a placebo.

23:52.195 --> 23:54.138
So you just put a bunch of placebos out there.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.843
You can meet any manufacturing quota you want.

23:56.863 --> 24:02.773
In the meantime, you can use your databases and whatever else to keep track of those lots that are actually hot.

24:03.965 --> 24:09.027
And so that's the reason why no one will talk about the background signal and why it could be misconstrued as spread.

24:09.307 --> 24:31.177
Most of the illusion is dismissed already there, especially if you tie into the fact that all of the people that have been in front of us have never been able to adequately and succinctly explain how PCR can be very accurate in a university and ridiculously aspecific on a hot background with a bunch of random companies making them, especially from China.

24:31.957 --> 24:34.919
Define the countermeasures as transformations and transfections.

24:34.979 --> 24:42.124
I don't know if you're aware, Sukrit, but before the pandemic, using adenovirus to express a protein was called transformation.

24:42.604 --> 24:57.154
And using naked DNA or mRNA in a gene gun with gold particles or with lipofectamine or with centrifugation or with electroporation, that was all called transfection.

24:57.754 --> 25:03.318
And so there were companies that were selling a whole catalog of products under the headline transfection.

25:03.739 --> 25:08.102
And at the beginning of the pandemic, my government called those investigational vaccines.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.424
That's an obvious truth that no one is saying.

25:11.464 --> 25:17.949
So even in the purest form, these chemically altered RNAs would have never been able to produce a high-fidelity protein.

25:18.349 --> 25:22.052
These RNAs would have never been able to be produced in their pure form.

25:22.112 --> 25:26.556
And anybody that's worked in a pharmaceutical company where they make biologics like

25:27.216 --> 25:35.920
And like a monoclonal antibody, they all know that you can't make a pure, pure, pure RNA, that there will be these fragmented RNAs.

25:35.961 --> 25:41.984
And all of these biologists ought to know that tiny RNAs, micro RNAs, small interfering RNAs, these are all

25:42.944 --> 25:50.053
points of regulation that we barely even understand and don't want to mess with an unknown quantity.

25:50.073 --> 25:57.904
And then finally, this might bother you a little bit for the last five years, but there's been all these people going around saying that there's no virus.

25:58.064 --> 26:00.767
And I think I finally figured out what their problem is.

26:01.628 --> 26:24.233
They're trying to help cover this up too, because if they weren't trying to help cover this up, then they would have already taken number five and run with it, which is that if you go back to the virology literature, especially with regard to RNA viruses, you will find that people go into the wild and they find a signal using PCR or sequencing, but then they don't grow that signal in a culture dish.

26:24.453 --> 26:25.933
They don't grow that signal by

26:26.593 --> 26:28.194
by swabbing a lot of bats.

26:28.234 --> 26:45.589
What they do is they order that signal from a synthetic DNA manufacturer, they assemble it, and then they amplify it in a bacterial culture and then using a commercial RNA polymerase, they can turn it into RNA and then put that RNA on their cell culture and call that virology.

26:45.629 --> 26:52.515
But they're starting with a pure quantity of the RNA that they claim to have found in the wild that they could never produce by any other means.

26:53.115 --> 26:56.196
And that is the main illusion that occurs in virology.

26:56.216 --> 26:59.578
And so even those papers that are called gain of function are done this way.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.038
And so I can explain that again, if it's necessary.

27:02.078 --> 27:11.222
And finally, I think the shortcut is to say, RNA cannot pandemic because it's not, it doesn't have the same biology that we've attributed to the magic molecule of DNA.

27:11.242 --> 27:11.882
It just doesn't.

27:11.942 --> 27:15.844
And so that's another thing that a lot of these biologists should have done known better.

27:15.904 --> 27:16.024
So

27:17.024 --> 27:20.806
The summary, again, this narrative that they told us on TV isn't true.

27:20.886 --> 27:23.147
They didn't censor the truth at the beginning.

27:24.127 --> 27:26.688
They got us to follow the people that they censored.

27:26.808 --> 27:28.569
And those people have been fooling us.

27:29.510 --> 27:30.750
There wasn't a novel virus.

27:30.790 --> 27:36.733
There was a background signal that can't be differentiated from what they call a virus going endemic.

27:36.813 --> 27:39.314
And I think it's very damning that you can find

27:39.934 --> 27:47.102
lectures from a long time ago that predate all the way to 2002 with the original SARS, where they're talking about endemicity as the scary thing.

27:47.142 --> 27:52.267
That's 10 years of time to characterize a background that they then lied to us about.

27:52.687 --> 27:59.534
The shortage of ventilators, or Elon Musk going to make ventilators, or Donald Trump going to ship ventilators to New York.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.615
This is all nonsense.

28:01.136 --> 28:02.257
In fact, they were running

28:02.677 --> 28:11.143
an oxygen plant on the ship Comfort in New York City and running this narrative about everybody if you don't have vents you can give them oxygen and that is absolutely murder.

28:11.763 --> 28:16.406
And I know at least one man, my friend Scott, whose daughter was murdered just like that.

28:17.206 --> 28:19.828
There's a huge rise in expect at all cause mortality.

28:19.868 --> 28:20.669
That's a big one.

28:21.649 --> 28:22.530
We didn't rush it out.

28:23.511 --> 28:28.494
We actually did this on purpose because otherwise transfection would have never been accepted by everyone.

28:29.695 --> 28:35.578
And this lie about the spike or this lie about, I don't know what they're talking about.

28:35.618 --> 28:47.746
Those all things might be true, but transfection to any foreign protein, and I know Sukrit will agree with this, because this is who I learned it from, transfection to any foreign protein is going to challenge the immune system to attack itself.

28:47.846 --> 28:49.627
And it's going to make mistakes.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.088
It can't do that flawlessly.

28:51.128 --> 28:52.328
It's a terrible idea.

28:53.249 --> 28:55.811
And you're also augmenting the immune system.

28:56.511 --> 29:06.323
intramuscularly, I think is a very dubious claim of methodology, because as Sukrit can tell you, the immune system is oriented, it's oriented inside out.

29:06.383 --> 29:11.669
And so augmenting it not at a barrier, but behind the barrier is just insane, especially for

29:12.269 --> 29:13.650
a respiratory, whatever.

29:14.331 --> 29:15.492
And that's why we are here.

29:15.592 --> 29:23.858
We are here where people like Steve Kirsch is saying that maybe in five years we'll have safe vaccines in America if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:23.878 --> 29:24.539
makes them safe.

29:24.599 --> 29:31.204
And we have Elon Musk actually saying that the reason why we don't have smallpox in America is because of the smallpox vaccine still.

29:31.264 --> 29:32.064
And it's scary.

29:33.065 --> 29:41.252
They are, I need your help, Sucrit, because you and other people from Europe can look at your own vaccine schedule and compare the calendar.

29:41.952 --> 29:49.018
And quantity and you can see that my vaccine schedule in America is criminal and it's evidence that these people are criminals.

29:49.639 --> 29:56.865
And you can help because you don't even have to say anything about Germany, you can just evaluate what I'm showing you and follow up on this.

29:58.167 --> 30:08.936
I really think I can explain any of these in detail that you want to, and the way that I would summarize it is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

30:08.996 --> 30:13.940
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal, and RNA cannot pandemic.

30:15.081 --> 30:21.126
Please try and see if any of that, we can discuss any of that.

30:22.888 --> 30:23.188
Thank you.

30:25.091 --> 30:31.036
And most importantly, from my point of view as a medical doctor, was there a pandemic or wasn't there?

30:31.716 --> 30:39.302
And in fact, is it possible that pandemics are not possible in the future and haven't been in the past?

30:39.782 --> 30:55.888
So the whole thing about pandemics was a construct for these criminals, in my opinion, and they've been working up to it, trying to undermine the influence of immunologists who know about the wonderful immune system of all animals, including human beings.

30:57.308 --> 31:17.294
and handing it over to the virologists, whose duty, in my opinion, to all these criminals was to push virology, to hide the immunology, so that human beings, mere human beings, could actually be hubristic and say they know better than God, whoever God is.

31:18.840 --> 31:26.482
So I think this is anti-human and it's really important that we get to the bottom of this about whether pandemics are possible.

31:26.782 --> 31:29.883
We were taught at medical school, a deadly virus kills its host.

31:30.563 --> 31:38.025
I asked the immunologist, the immunology professor at the time, I was a medical student, I didn't even know why I was asking the question.

31:38.686 --> 31:41.526
I said, does that mean that pandemics are not possible?

31:41.986 --> 31:47.468
And the immunologist professor said, very good, Stephen, but I had no idea why he said very good.

31:49.679 --> 31:50.740
I don't know what he knew.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.063
Looking back, I didn't know what he knew at the time.

31:55.064 --> 31:57.666
Can I chime in?

31:58.107 --> 31:58.347
Sure.

31:58.367 --> 31:59.968
It's your go, Sukrit.

32:00.849 --> 32:02.170
Well, I'm going to be very short.

32:03.592 --> 32:07.935
Jay, I have nothing to add to anything you said.

32:07.955 --> 32:12.499
I completely agree, so there's not going to be any discussion on this.

32:14.252 --> 32:40.895
The only point I want to make to you, Jay, is that I have specifically and intentionally always avoided any discussion on the topic of virus or no virus, because I felt that it was better to avoid this discussion in order to not lose time and effort

32:41.798 --> 32:43.900
on a topic that was not really relevant.

32:44.000 --> 32:59.132
It's not relevant because what is really relevant now is that we have to stop this rollout of the RNA and vector vaccines.

32:59.552 --> 33:01.594
This is what we have to try to do.

33:02.674 --> 33:10.561
And as everyone who is listening today know, the WHO declared, what was this over a year ago,

33:11.496 --> 33:22.722
that it was their intent to install RNA vaccinations in veterinary medicine and human medicine.

33:23.963 --> 33:30.226
And as you yourself said, Jay, it's a cassette that has been put into a recorder, okay?

33:30.647 --> 33:33.268
And there's no control anymore.

33:33.788 --> 33:35.910
So my soul,

33:37.170 --> 33:46.400
My sole purpose in the next weeks and months is my sole intent is to try to stop this and to get you guys to stop it.

33:46.860 --> 33:51.745
Now, the second thing was the question about pandemic.

33:52.626 --> 33:59.750
And, Stephen, your immunology professor said, very good, because the question was very good.

34:00.551 --> 34:11.296
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

34:11.977 --> 34:12.097
And

34:15.120 --> 34:18.443
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

34:18.643 --> 34:19.124
It can't.

34:19.745 --> 34:23.508
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

34:23.528 --> 34:28.613
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

34:30.054 --> 34:35.319
So anyone who comes up and says there was a pandemic, he should prove that there was one.

34:35.660 --> 34:38.642
It's not we who have to show that there was no pandemic.

34:39.323 --> 34:39.843
But in fact,

34:40.936 --> 34:43.918
no numbers will support that statement.

34:44.798 --> 34:47.399
No one has any numbers that can support that statement.

34:48.340 --> 35:00.466
So that is actually all I wanted to say as a comment to what Jay said, because I have no comments except that I agree entirely with everything that he has said.

35:02.910 --> 35:13.915
So, Greg, can I ask you, how do you think we should, do you think that what JJ is saying, and I've been saying this for a long time, that we need to create our own narrative.

35:14.416 --> 35:15.536
It's really important.

35:15.756 --> 35:19.158
We don't need to discuss with the people who don't agree with us.

35:19.618 --> 35:25.661
We need to tell the public what we know, and we haven't done that properly so far.

35:25.701 --> 35:28.343
All right, Stephen, sorry, I'm sorry.

35:29.825 --> 35:32.268
I there, I disagree.

35:33.249 --> 35:35.833
I don't think we can succeed.

35:36.394 --> 35:37.255
It's impossible.

35:37.756 --> 35:42.963
It's impossible to transmit this knowledge to laypeople.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.108
It's just too difficult.

35:45.288 --> 35:46.369
It's too difficult.

35:46.889 --> 35:53.651
I've spent a lot of time and effort trying to transmit the simplest things.

35:54.151 --> 36:02.154
I mean, Jay went into some depth, and that makes it impossible to reach the vast majority of people.

36:02.814 --> 36:12.778
So what I think, and this is what I want to propose to all of you today, and I'm so glad that people like Ron Johnson is there, Vera Sharaf is here.

36:13.678 --> 36:16.119
Hello, everyone.

36:17.660 --> 36:28.786
But you are the people who can now take over and you have the power to do so.

36:29.386 --> 36:32.267
You have this laser sword, okay?

36:32.608 --> 36:33.608
Star Wars.

36:34.869 --> 36:43.233
Because, and this is what I want to bring home today, the Robert Koch files have given you this instrument

36:44.537 --> 36:52.501
They have given you a present that is more precious than anything that has happened in the last five years.

36:53.341 --> 37:01.806
So I wanted to ask you, I think there are 78 participants, who knows about the Robert Koch files?

37:02.886 --> 37:04.387
Stephen, what do you know?

37:05.905 --> 37:08.287
I haven't had time to look into that secret.

37:09.788 --> 37:12.350
Well, then I tell you, all of you.

37:12.370 --> 37:15.553
I advise all of you.

37:16.834 --> 37:22.398
May I ask the 78 of you who are here, who knows about the Robert Koch files?

37:23.099 --> 37:24.560
I think Nick Hudson probably does.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.501
Yeah, and they always got it under.

37:27.482 --> 37:28.102
Nick, are you here?

37:28.123 --> 37:29.143
Yeah, he's there.

37:30.104 --> 37:30.925
Nick, what are you saying?

37:31.894 --> 37:33.377
It's been a long time since we spoke.

37:33.397 --> 37:34.259
What does that tell you?

37:43.223 --> 37:56.788
Well, we were looking at them very closely and there are a number of inconsistencies, but I mean, let's put the inconsistencies in our concern regarding the changing nature of the disclosures over time.

37:57.149 --> 38:01.270
And the disclosures come, just to explain to the audience, the disclosures come in two formats.

38:01.310 --> 38:04.732
There's a leak and there's the equivalent of an American FOIA.

38:05.792 --> 38:12.136
and their incompatibilities, their signs of editing of documents, including emails.

38:12.797 --> 38:22.483
So the provenance of these files and the manner of the leaks and FOIAs does register some concern with us, I mean, looking into it.

38:22.523 --> 38:24.884
So that's why we've been a little bit cagey.

38:25.025 --> 38:33.750
And I would encourage everybody to follow Robert Kogan, who's one of the most heavily suppressed people on social media in general.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.051
and his articles.

38:36.191 --> 38:52.438
But just to answer Sukharit's question, there's a claim made by RKI that the entire story was politically motivated and that they were engineering results to suit political ends.

38:53.438 --> 38:56.659
And so I agree with Sukharit, just that alone

38:58.420 --> 39:01.742
is worth the price of admission.

39:02.403 --> 39:20.316
But there's a concern there, because it's also patently clear that the Robert Koch Institute had been engineering itself for years, possibly even decades, towards the end goal of proselytizing a fake pandemic.

39:21.295 --> 39:29.338
Sukrit, I'd be curious to hear whether you think I've picked out the important parts or there are other features that deserve mention.

39:29.859 --> 39:30.739
Yes, certainly.

39:31.779 --> 39:45.165
What you last said was, of course, a key point, meaning that these Robert Koch protocols, they are protocols of their meetings that took place daily.

39:46.594 --> 39:48.695
starting in 2020.

39:49.175 --> 39:54.516
Every day they came together and these protocols are the protocols of the meetings.

39:55.356 --> 40:15.861
And it is absolutely clear, it was March 16th, 2020, where it is written in the protocols that they knew that this virus was not particularly dangerous and therefore the danger signal was set on medium.

40:17.523 --> 40:21.471
too low, but that they were waiting for a phone call.

40:23.629 --> 40:24.690
from a politician.

40:25.550 --> 40:33.636
And when this phone call was received one day later, they would up the danger signal.

40:34.296 --> 40:42.321
So this is political control of a medical institution.

40:43.062 --> 40:49.686
And that is what set off the green light for the lockdowns and for the vaccination.

40:49.927 --> 40:50.227
Okay.

40:50.607 --> 40:53.609
Now, Nick, listen very carefully, all of you.

40:55.310 --> 40:57.392
That is what is going around in Germany.

40:58.813 --> 41:09.101
And it's going wild because, very correctly, that is enough to build a case against the Robert Koch Institute and the Ministry of Public Health.

41:10.362 --> 41:17.027
However, there is one other protocol that is much, much, much more important.

41:19.048 --> 41:23.990
There are over 4,000 pages of this protocol that all of you can read.

41:24.391 --> 41:27.312
And in fact, I think they are now available in English, right, Nick?

41:28.352 --> 41:29.393
Did you see them in English?

41:30.253 --> 41:32.034
Yes, yes, we do see them in English.

41:32.534 --> 41:33.935
I've got a point for you later as well.

41:33.955 --> 41:35.096
Allow me a chance to come back.

41:35.116 --> 41:43.199
Okay, Nick, then I advise you and all of you who are listening now to go to the protocol of the 27th of April 2020.

41:47.501 --> 41:48.741
27th of April, 2020.

41:50.062 --> 41:51.442
Just that one protocol.

41:51.962 --> 41:56.864
Now, in the German version, it is on page 725, OK?

41:56.884 --> 42:07.507
And right in the middle, there's a protocol of the subject that they were handling.

42:07.927 --> 42:09.268
And what was that subject?

42:09.608 --> 42:10.948
The subject was the

42:23.191 --> 42:28.513
the vaccination program that was going to be started.

42:29.633 --> 42:29.993
All right?

42:30.434 --> 42:33.274
The implementation of a vaccination program.

42:33.575 --> 42:34.855
Now, this was in April 2020.

42:35.195 --> 42:35.655
Wow.

42:35.795 --> 42:39.877
There was no vaccine, okay?

42:40.457 --> 42:44.478
And no one knew that there were any clinical trials that were being held.

42:45.038 --> 42:47.419
Now, listen very carefully, Stephen.

42:48.689 --> 43:02.018
You open that protocol, look at that page, and you will see two things that will change history, if you can use them, and all of you can use them.

43:02.538 --> 43:06.580
Ron Johnson can immediately use this in America because, of course,

43:07.546 --> 43:17.592
This pertained to the implementation of the vaccination program in Germany and the world with the German product from BioNTech, Pfizer.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.453
Okay, that was the first one.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.515
So what do you read?

43:22.595 --> 43:31.741
You read, lo and behold, several vaccines will become available.

43:33.022 --> 43:36.344
They have been developed and tested in a

43:38.831 --> 43:45.933
at lightning speed, very in an accelerated fashion.

43:46.713 --> 43:54.476
They have been tested, developed and tested in an accelerated fashion.

43:55.536 --> 43:56.897
So they were already there.

43:57.197 --> 43:57.517
Okay.

43:57.917 --> 43:59.898
Now, if you want to know how

44:01.755 --> 44:12.798
that had been developed and tested, you go and read the autobiography of Ugo Sein and his wife, Joe Miller, Project Lightning Speed.

44:13.158 --> 44:14.859
It's all written down there.

44:15.599 --> 44:19.460
And it is documented that they used fake methods.

44:20.660 --> 44:30.603
They said themselves that they had a problem to test the efficacy of the antibodies because they had neither animal

44:31.561 --> 44:38.425
housing, nor did they have the virus to test whether the antibodies were efficacious.

44:39.486 --> 44:45.909
So what they did was they had a cell culture system, which is a complete nonsense, Jay, complete nonsense.

44:46.370 --> 44:56.896
And the results that they also presented in their own book would tell anyone, any politician, that there was

44:59.178 --> 45:01.719
they had no results, they had negative results.

45:02.220 --> 45:13.905
So what they did was they took cell cultures, J in one little culture well, there were 500, no 50,000 cells, okay?

45:17.421 --> 45:31.727
Then they poured a pseudovirus, not the real virus, which they did not have, a reporter pseudovirus with a reporter gene, luciferase, on the cells.

45:33.487 --> 45:34.968
It is all written down.

45:35.788 --> 45:43.071
And then they took another well and looked to see how many cells they could

45:44.798 --> 45:47.979
infect or transfect with this pseudovirus.

45:48.199 --> 45:49.680
It wasn't a real virus at all.

45:51.320 --> 45:58.543
And then they found out that they had a 90% reduction of infection.

46:00.543 --> 46:08.746
However, if you look at the numbers, which you can read in their autobiography, what did they find?

46:09.506 --> 46:13.708
They found out that in the control without the antibodies,

46:15.145 --> 46:18.007
They infected 1% of the cells.

46:20.629 --> 46:27.835
They lit up green, and the green fluorescence was so weak that they had problems measuring.

46:28.836 --> 46:31.818
It was less than, it was background, okay?

46:32.278 --> 46:33.759
Absolute background.

46:34.540 --> 46:40.325
And if they incubated the pseudovirus with their DNA,

46:41.500 --> 46:42.620
anti-serum.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.261
They weren't even isolated antibodies.

46:46.281 --> 46:49.622
It was the raw serum from the mice that they had vaccinated.

46:49.642 --> 46:52.383
The numbers dropped down to 0.1%.

46:52.423 --> 46:53.924
So of the 50,000 cells, they would get 500

47:00.820 --> 47:08.066
500 in the control, 550,000 were pseudo-infected with the pseudo-virus, and if they were pre-incubated with the anti-serum,

47:16.681 --> 47:17.021
They got 50.

47:18.482 --> 47:32.253
And it was so difficult to measure the difference that they had to install very expensive, the most expensive instruments to measure this weak, tiny fluorescence difference.

47:33.173 --> 47:45.823
And with those data, they went to the Paul Ehrlich Institute and showed them the 90% efficacy, established with a non

47:47.494 --> 47:50.339
It was a method that can't be used.

47:50.440 --> 47:56.652
It's never been used, okay, in vaccine science or technology.

47:57.093 --> 47:57.795
It's stupid.

47:59.398 --> 48:14.162
And the Paul Ehrlich Institute, under so-called Professor Ketrotec, who is a chemist and has been bought by all these guys, you know, in the background, all in America, he said, okay, guys, go ahead.

48:14.762 --> 48:16.582
And that was the testing that they had done.

48:17.142 --> 48:23.384
And the Robert Koch Institute knew this on the 20th of February, and knew that these vaccines were coming.

48:24.004 --> 48:26.945
Now, to top this, guys,

48:28.257 --> 48:48.637
The sentence under that sentence says, reads, okay, relevant data will first be assessed or collected post-marketing in humans.

48:50.168 --> 49:06.173
meaning that they had no relevant data on C and safety, and meaning that the world population was going to be used as experimental animals.

49:06.953 --> 49:07.393
Exactly.

49:08.133 --> 49:08.374
Yeah.

49:08.694 --> 49:12.575
But it's now it's, it's black on white.

49:13.215 --> 49:14.075
And it's there for you.

49:14.856 --> 49:15.596
And any

49:17.668 --> 49:19.209
lawyers can use this.

49:19.709 --> 49:22.450
Yes, so Sukrit, it's very important what you're saying.

49:22.630 --> 49:37.034
So can I just clarify, are you saying that the Robert Koch Institute, no less, with its history, you know, previously, was creating or finishing off a business plan in April 2020?

49:39.261 --> 49:39.481
Yes.

49:40.402 --> 49:57.230
Yeah, it's fraud, and it's a racket, and a racket can be attacked in America, which is why I encourage... Five US states have filed criminal complaints against Pfizer.

49:58.050 --> 49:59.831
They can use this document

50:02.680 --> 50:15.685
But Sukrit, I just want to say to Senator Johnson, because I think it's very important he hears this from somebody, that in my opinion, Sukrit Bhakti and JJ are the people to listen to, Senator Johnson, and

50:16.503 --> 50:32.775
Sukrit Bhakti in particular because he came up with the brilliant line, or he noticed, so he's a doctor and a scientist, a medical doctor and a scientist, and he came up at the end of the wonderful book which gave me hope in

50:33.796 --> 50:36.278
November 2020, I think it was, Corona false alarm.

50:37.119 --> 50:43.964
You said, Sukrit, this is the end of the age of the Enlightenment, the end of the age of Enlightenment.

50:44.384 --> 50:47.146
And I thought, that sums it up for me.

50:47.627 --> 50:53.111
And people were talking about this and that, but the big picture was that this was tyranny.

50:53.811 --> 50:57.334
And you pointed that out at the end of your book.

50:57.414 --> 50:59.916
I think it was at the end of your book, Corona false alarm.

51:00.436 --> 51:00.576
Yes.

51:00.656 --> 51:04.218
And so you could see the big picture very clearly then.

51:04.238 --> 51:04.298
Yes.

51:05.359 --> 51:06.539
So great.

51:06.619 --> 51:07.800
Ron's got his hand up.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.001
While we got Ron, he's on a tight time frame.

51:10.101 --> 51:12.942
Ron, can you go, Ron?

51:13.323 --> 51:17.565
Well, first of all, I appreciate being invited to this.

51:18.476 --> 51:22.379
Frequently am, but rarely have a chance to listen to these things.

51:24.441 --> 51:28.244
My role throughout this process has been trying to seek the truth.

51:28.945 --> 51:30.906
It's just that simple.

51:31.067 --> 51:42.716
Provide the platform and be the lay person that can try and translate what you doctors are saying into something that the public can understand.

51:43.697 --> 51:45.639
And Dr. Bhakti, I mean, I agree with you that

51:46.942 --> 51:48.864
I've been in contact with JJ in the past.

51:48.924 --> 51:50.145
I think he's brilliant.

51:50.885 --> 51:53.407
I've been in contact with Mike Eden.

51:53.467 --> 51:54.808
It's the reason I didn't get a vaccine.

51:54.908 --> 51:56.209
I talked to Mike Eden.

51:59.060 --> 52:00.242
You just said, I can use this.

52:00.682 --> 52:01.744
I don't know how to use this.

52:03.526 --> 52:04.146
Let me just finish.

52:05.488 --> 52:13.297
What I've been praying for, what I've been hoping for, before my last Senate event, I think December of 2023, 2022, I assembled all these doctors.

52:18.423 --> 52:21.246
And so I'm going to, you know, JJ is not real fond of anymore.

52:21.286 --> 52:21.826
That's fine.

52:22.507 --> 52:27.952
And I was hoping in a day's session before we put our event, I could be brought up to speed.

52:27.972 --> 52:29.834
Okay, where are we with all the science?

52:30.134 --> 52:38.902
Where are we in terms of information from the Koch Institute or from, you know, different health agencies around the world?

52:40.606 --> 52:48.448
What is frustrating to me as I keep telling these docs these events, you're light years ahead of where the public is.

52:49.228 --> 52:56.989
And we need to develop a foundational base of information to bring the public along to where we are, okay?

52:57.290 --> 53:02.431
And a lot of people are, I know Mike, he has his conclusions.

53:03.131 --> 53:04.091
I've got an open mind.

53:05.031 --> 53:07.492
I don't, I think JJ said this, I don't know what happened.

53:07.612 --> 53:08.892
I don't know who they are.

53:10.453 --> 53:12.136
I mean, that's the mystery we're all trying to solve.

53:12.176 --> 53:15.723
But listen, I am a sponge for information.

53:16.644 --> 53:21.633
I'm looking for the best studies, the best piece of information.

53:21.713 --> 53:23.196
I know it's coming in from all over the world.

53:23.962 --> 53:27.825
You know, I'm happy to send that.

53:27.905 --> 53:30.588
Hopefully, I'll end on this note.

53:30.668 --> 53:36.653
Hopefully, if we get the majority in this next election, I'll be chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee Investigation.

53:37.073 --> 53:40.136
There's nobody else in the United States Senate or Congress that are looking at this.

53:40.797 --> 53:47.382
I mean, what the House did, those hearings, the only thing they're missing was a banner said, you know, brought to you by Pfizer.

53:48.183 --> 53:51.145
So I want to use that committee, but I need

53:52.130 --> 53:55.167
The information I keep asking, I want new faces.

53:55.816 --> 54:02.702
Yes, Senator, listen, I've been following you and I would say chapeau to you.

54:02.902 --> 54:06.685
I respect you tremendously and I feel what you are doing is great.

54:06.965 --> 54:07.706
It's historic.

54:08.126 --> 54:15.112
Now let me tell you what I am trying to trigger in Germany and in Austria and in Switzerland.

54:15.912 --> 54:22.418
I am trying to trigger politicians to establish parliamentary committees of inquiry.

54:23.338 --> 54:30.664
And the only question they have to investigate is the lawfulness of the vaccine authorization.

54:31.925 --> 54:44.896
Because that simple question can be answered in very few hours before it can be proven

54:45.939 --> 54:49.761
that the lawfulness did not exist.

54:50.361 --> 54:55.383
Therefore, these vaccines are unlawful, and therefore, they must be stopped.

54:55.964 --> 55:03.727
So Dr. Bakhti, let me tell you, the problem we run into is people literally don't want to know.

55:03.747 --> 55:08.749
I held another event on American health nutrition, a second opinion.

55:10.570 --> 55:16.772
And I think, as Dr. Chris Palmer said, they don't want to know the root cause to chronic illness.

55:16.792 --> 55:19.072
So that is the resistance we're getting.

55:19.152 --> 55:21.233
They don't want to know.

55:21.253 --> 55:24.153
And the result of that, let me finish.

55:24.433 --> 55:34.196
The result of that public hearing, I just got a letter today signed by something like 270 different agricultural interests, different state ag departments.

55:36.456 --> 55:42.297
to the agriculture committee chairman and ranking member saying how much we need these pesticides and stuff.

55:42.317 --> 55:45.118
So what we are up against is massive.

55:45.698 --> 55:47.779
And there's just a few voices out here.

55:47.799 --> 55:50.579
I mean, look at how many people are on this call.

55:50.599 --> 56:02.162
We are a small minority and we've got to figure out what are the truths that are understandable by the public that will break through to create the public pressure to get these things changed and get it acknowledged.

56:03.202 --> 56:15.606
Susan Johnson, the reason they don't want to hear you or listen to you is because they're living in different cults and you and I and Sukrit and JJ are not good cult members.

56:15.966 --> 56:21.248
We're unusual because human beings have a predilection for cults, for joining cults.

56:21.328 --> 56:21.528
Why?

56:22.068 --> 56:25.909
Well, because they can then be led around and they don't have to think.

56:25.949 --> 56:31.751
They don't want to take responsibility, most human beings and people like you and Sukrit and JJ.

56:31.811 --> 56:33.912
Sorry, I must interrupt.

56:34.072 --> 56:36.132
I really have the need to interrupt.

56:36.212 --> 56:36.872
Sorry, Stephen.

56:37.473 --> 56:41.394
I am not talking about a normal investigative committee.

56:41.874 --> 56:48.776
I'm talking about a committee that is established in parliament now in Germany.

56:49.236 --> 56:51.037
we have 15 states, right?

56:51.657 --> 57:05.803
Saxony, you know, Turing, and in these states where the AFD has the majority, they can establish a committee of inquiry.

57:06.143 --> 57:07.384
They don't have to ask anyone.

57:07.684 --> 57:09.385
I know, but they won't.

57:09.405 --> 57:10.225
Okay, that's great.

57:10.245 --> 57:12.026
They won't do it to Congress, unless it's me.

57:18.047 --> 57:18.467
In the U.S.

57:18.487 --> 57:20.148
Congress, it will not happen unless it's me.

57:21.088 --> 57:22.329
Can you do this in America?

57:22.389 --> 57:29.512
Do the individual states like Texas or Kansas or Florida, they have their parliament, don't they?

57:30.412 --> 57:34.714
They have individual legislatures and there are different attorneys generals that are going down this path.

57:35.154 --> 57:36.735
But again, they are up against the same resistance.

57:36.755 --> 57:38.395
Again, I'm not saying this is impossible.

57:38.415 --> 57:40.636
I'm just laying out here are the problems.

57:41.137 --> 57:46.679
And again, what we need is we need in an understandable fashion to normal people.

57:47.903 --> 57:48.844
This was what happened.

57:48.864 --> 57:53.147
And again, I think you disagree with JJ that we need our own narrative.

57:53.167 --> 57:53.787
I think we do.

57:54.028 --> 57:55.969
We have to be able to tell the story of what happened.

57:56.009 --> 57:57.310
And it has to be reputable.

57:58.091 --> 58:00.132
And Nick Hudson is exceptionally good at that.

58:00.232 --> 58:01.313
Nick Hudson is good at that.

58:02.539 --> 58:19.750
It could be that America and Europe have to go different ways, but the way that I think the Germans can and must take is this installation of parliamentary committees of inquiries.

58:20.430 --> 58:27.819
And I can tell you, Senator Johnson, that this is going to happen in Saxon, in Union.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.581
I talked to them yesterday.

58:30.102 --> 58:30.823
They're doing it.

58:31.303 --> 58:33.366
Didn't Germany just drop some study, though?

58:34.079 --> 58:37.083
they read about, they were going to do something, and they just dropped some inquiry?

58:37.523 --> 58:38.004
No, no, no, no.

58:38.044 --> 58:39.085
This is all in the making.

58:39.606 --> 58:43.871
Because the AFD, the party, the AFD has just come up.

58:44.391 --> 58:52.841
And now they have enough members of parliament to cast this vote that this committee has to be installed.

58:52.961 --> 58:54.043
And that's what they're going to do.

58:54.443 --> 59:10.718
Yeah, by the way, I would also say because these are by and large American companies, Pfizer, I know BioNTech is German, but because this sprang from America, there's probably gonna be far greater resistance in America than there will be in other countries where they'd be happy to pile on and criticize and investigate American companies.

59:11.058 --> 59:15.402
So I think- But we're not investigating any company.

59:16.983 --> 59:19.405
The question that is going to be raised

59:20.466 --> 59:28.432
that has to be answered by this committee is the question of the lawfulness of the vaccine authorization.

59:29.844 --> 59:31.645
Not, you see, nothing else.

59:32.025 --> 59:33.105
But they are the law.

59:33.585 --> 59:35.686
Can I just briefly interject?

59:36.246 --> 59:37.446
No, no, no, no.

59:37.546 --> 59:38.266
Yeah, JJ.

59:38.306 --> 59:45.328
So it's really important to realize that in America, we're on our own trap because we have our own laws and our own constitution.

59:45.348 --> 59:49.650
In America, what enabled this to happen was a number of laws.

59:49.710 --> 59:52.150
I'm not an expert on it, but the PrEP Act is one.

59:52.410 --> 59:57.972
And what happens in the PrEP Act is very simple to explain, but only in the context of American law.

59:58.812 --> 01:00:15.663
if the if a fundamental right in america is to be suspended the government is not assumed to be right the government is assumed to be wrong in other words it's not presumed innocent until proven guilty if the government's going to take away a fundamental right and that has been established as a very very firm

01:00:16.303 --> 01:00:31.516
thing within american law and so the prep act allows them to suspend a number of rights including probably the seventh amendment and probably something other other another amendment and that suspension of rights is only subject to a non-elected officials whim

01:00:32.276 --> 01:00:36.999
called the rational basis review, which is basically if he has a hypothetical reason, he can do it.

01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:43.743
And that's not sufficient in the context of American law to justify the suspension of a fundamental right.

01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:50.808
And what's pretty shocking is that all the lawyers that have been on our side for like 10 years on the vaccine schedule, haven't managed to

01:00:51.428 --> 01:01:10.000
get this argument together and I have and I'm not a lawyer so that's the trick because those words don't mean jack and all in Canada they don't mean jack in Australia and so our traps are all different we have to know the the beast we're fighting but each one of us is in a separate cage okay okay Jay I mean

01:01:13.144 --> 01:01:15.468
I have no insight in the American situation.

01:01:15.488 --> 01:01:22.779
I'm just telling you what we're trying to trigger in Germany and in Austria.

01:01:23.259 --> 01:01:25.002
The same thing is happening in Austria.

01:01:25.843 --> 01:01:26.424
There's going to be

01:01:27.415 --> 01:01:29.618
a parliamentary committee of inquiry.

01:01:29.778 --> 01:01:36.047
I think that's why it's really important, because one country might find that they have a law that makes it very easy for them to punish.

01:01:36.287 --> 01:01:40.673
And if they can, then that might set the momentum in motion.

01:01:40.873 --> 01:01:41.454
That's my point.

01:01:43.928 --> 01:01:47.391
different countries may have different levels of success to expose this.

01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:50.093
I'm not arguing with anybody here.

01:01:51.554 --> 01:01:56.858
I've been trying to get more and more people to cooperate from different points of view, different conclusions.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.862
In the end, truth is truth, and that's what we need to uncover here.

01:02:01.902 --> 01:02:08.027
So I'm just looking for more people to help uncover and expose the truth, recognizing how difficult that is.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:23.335
Yeah, Sukrit, I think it's very important to point out that a lot of people in doctors and experts in inverted commas and scientists, even on our side, are very good at finding information.

01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:29.137
But they're very bad, in my experience running this group, at joining the dots.

01:02:29.757 --> 01:02:34.799
The information that they have and other people have, they don't want to know about other people's information.

01:02:34.839 --> 01:02:36.540
They just want to talk about their information.

01:02:37.396 --> 01:02:39.117
We need the dot joiners.

01:02:39.257 --> 01:02:45.561
It's very important that we've got the dot joiners, and that's why we haven't made any progress with the true narrative.

01:02:45.861 --> 01:02:51.285
The narrative that human beings can get closest to the truth.

01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:53.206
I'm not saying we can get to the whole truth.

01:02:53.846 --> 01:02:56.907
But obviously we can't solve a problem if we don't know what the truth is.

01:02:56.987 --> 01:03:15.976
If we can't articulate to other human beings what the truth is, what we think the truth is, with good intentions and we're doing our best to find out the truth and change our opinions all the time, hypothesize when necessary as a good medical doctor should, then we're not going to win this.

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:18.217
We need to get a narrative out

01:03:18.857 --> 01:03:19.697
as some time.

01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:22.638
I've been saying it for a long time, but nobody else can see it.

01:03:23.178 --> 01:03:24.039
JJ can see it now.

01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:30.761
Yeah, Stephen, listen, I am not here to argue with you about what you should do or what I should do.

01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:32.682
I'm not arguing, Sukrit.

01:03:33.162 --> 01:03:38.984
I'm just telling you that the Robert Koch files

01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:42.249
have exposed themselves.

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:44.493
And you don't have to look for the truth.

01:03:44.553 --> 01:03:46.435
The truth is staring at you in the eyes.

01:03:46.716 --> 01:03:47.697
Now, let me tell you.

01:03:47.717 --> 01:03:49.279
Can you send me those pages?

01:03:54.043 --> 01:03:55.383
Send me this information.

01:03:56.224 --> 01:03:56.944
In German, yes.

01:03:57.344 --> 01:04:09.366
I can tell you, Senator, when this came out in June, this June, it was so important that I sat down and extended my autobiography.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:10.526
I've written a book.

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:13.487
It's out in German since last year.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:17.648
And the new edition is going to appear in two weeks.

01:04:18.636 --> 01:04:22.721
And it is also going to appear in 40 languages, including English.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:31.890
And in those last 15 pages, I laid out why the time has now come for the world to act.

01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:37.436
Because you have the instrument in your hands with which you can stop

01:04:38.243 --> 01:04:45.325
this whole mass criminality, the whole vaccine program can be brought to a fall.

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:47.026
You just have to want to do it.

01:04:47.646 --> 01:04:48.326
And exactly.

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:48.766
So great.

01:04:49.126 --> 01:04:49.327
Yes.

01:04:50.107 --> 01:04:51.847
And so so the book is going to be out.

01:04:53.488 --> 01:04:57.849
It's going to be out in two weeks.

01:04:58.930 --> 01:04:59.770
And it's

01:05:01.178 --> 01:05:03.298
The title is The Way of Truth.

01:05:03.539 --> 01:05:05.279
Okay, and it's my autobiography.

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:10.680
And I tell the whole story of COVID there very easily told.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:27.004
And I end with the Robert Koch files with this page 725 and the statements that they have written down, and that they're open for the whole world to see that the world has been subject to a mass human experiment.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:28.124
Absolutely.

01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:38.692
I have no more to say, because it's all written down, and not by us, but by those guys themselves.

01:05:39.213 --> 01:05:40.676
This is the wonderful thing about it.

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:46.469
But Sukrit, it was not just about the vaccine.

01:05:46.529 --> 01:05:48.731
So you're a medical doctor and I'm a medical doctor.

01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:57.579
So medical doctors, if they're good, they should be hypothesizing on behalf of the human species, thinking of their patients and humanity in general.

01:05:57.979 --> 01:06:01.062
What happened in 2020 was obviously wrong.

01:06:01.202 --> 01:06:02.243
It wasn't partially wrong.

01:06:02.543 --> 01:06:03.644
It was completely wrong.

01:06:03.904 --> 01:06:05.466
Let's go back four years.

01:06:05.706 --> 01:06:06.687
It was a pack of lies.

01:06:07.847 --> 01:06:11.189
So you've said tonight that we don't have to prove it was wrong.

01:06:11.549 --> 01:06:12.730
They have to prove that it is.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.371
It was actually justified.

01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.612
It wasn't justified.

01:06:15.912 --> 01:06:18.473
Human beings are very social animals.

01:06:18.553 --> 01:06:24.757
They have incredible habits and they were robbed of their habits and they were robbed of their souls.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.203
and the will to live.

01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:36.136
They lost the will to live, many human beings, and that has not been talked about by any medical doctors in the world.

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:46.093
No, I mean, we agreed on all points, Stephen, but I am trying to find out how to stop the WHO and its vaccination program.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:48.673
Everything else doesn't really interest me.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.194
It does not interest me.

01:06:50.614 --> 01:06:57.876
The WHO are evil, but the reason they need to go is because they're not needed, because pandemics are not possible.

01:06:58.652 --> 01:07:01.855
That's why they look, this is beside the point.

01:07:02.276 --> 01:07:05.259
How do we stop this vaccination program?

01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:08.202
That's the only thing I'm interested in the only thing.

01:07:08.822 --> 01:07:12.426
Because as you know, it's it's exploding now.

01:07:12.966 --> 01:07:15.309
And if we don't think about a way to stop it,

01:07:17.023 --> 01:07:19.924
I'm not going to go into discussions with anyone.

01:07:20.605 --> 01:07:21.825
There's nothing to discuss.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:23.666
There's nothing to discuss.

01:07:23.686 --> 01:07:28.689
While we've got Jay here, we've got one other scientist here who's got his hand up, and that's David Resnick.

01:07:29.729 --> 01:07:31.710
Ron, have you had dealings with David Resnick?

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:41.655
Well, Charles, I'm concerned that JJ hasn't had a chance to... Well, he did speak at the beginning, but he hasn't had a chance to... We'll see what David Resnick has to say, then we'll go to Jay.

01:07:41.795 --> 01:07:42.135
David?

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:43.660
Oh, hi.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.541
Yeah, very, very interesting.

01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:55.805
The reason I put my hand up is that I have four years experience facing what most everybody here has been facing five years.

01:07:56.345 --> 01:08:01.907
I knew as early as February of 2020 that every aspect of what we're talking about today was

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:17.835
There was no way that I could explain to anybody why that was, because it took what you're experiencing right now, what you're all going through and facing, what you understand, how do you convey the useful information to other people?

01:08:18.235 --> 01:08:21.416
That's what happened with the AIDS stuff back in the 80s and 90s.

01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:22.417
Absolutely.

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:26.178
A subset of us around the world, and it has nothing to do with science.

01:08:26.438 --> 01:08:30.039
You see, the key of it is it's not medical, it's not anything.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.240
It's a pack of lies.

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:40.486
But how do you get away, how do you approach people without having to go through all this technobabble?

01:08:40.786 --> 01:08:44.930
The technobabble with AIDS is not going to work with COVID.

01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:48.012
That's why I don't want to get involved in this.

01:08:48.592 --> 01:08:49.293
I agree with you.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:52.035
You've got to take a non-technical approach.

01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:56.344
Stay away from it.

01:08:56.384 --> 01:08:57.606
We all understand it.

01:08:57.927 --> 01:09:03.136
We cannot educate and bring people to this awareness in any reasonable time.

01:09:03.998 --> 01:09:06.622
I want this to go through Parliament.

01:09:07.659 --> 01:09:09.160
Well, that sounds a bit defeatist.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.240
Hang on, hang on.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:33.848
I would just make the argument that where my hope lies, and it might be just nonsense, but where my hope lies is that there are thousands of academic professional biologists in universities, labs, and in pharmaceutical laboratories that have the requisite biological background to hear the words, RNA cannot pandemic, and have like a

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:35.296
What does that mean?

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:43.220
They also can hear the words intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting my kid's immune system is dumb.

01:09:43.641 --> 01:09:44.781
And then they could think about it.

01:09:44.801 --> 01:09:47.522
They could think about what do I really know about immunology?

01:09:48.023 --> 01:09:54.506
And if they asked those questions to me, I could go on for hours about how the immune system is organized from the inside out.

01:09:54.566 --> 01:10:00.109
And the original idea of vaccination has always been to perturb the barrier at the,

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:04.270
in the direction that the immune system is oriented.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:08.031
If somebody wanted to ask me, but how did they use PCR to lie?

01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:20.494
I can explain to an academic biologist all the ways that they use PCR to be hyper-accurate, to get a publication in Nature, and how none of those optimizations were used in any diagnostics.

01:10:20.934 --> 01:10:29.896
So there are questions that need to be asked, and I think there are people with professional backgrounds that will propel them to ask the right questions if we can just stimulate them

01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:31.297
to think about them.

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:41.345
That's why I think technical, yes, you're not going to get a gas station attendant to understand it, but there are thousands of academics around the world that ought to be able to figure this out.

01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:44.028
A real quick response.

01:10:44.864 --> 01:10:50.628
Back in the 80s, the 80s and 90s, it wasn't just Peter Duesberg, me, and a handful of other scientists.

01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:58.555
The people at UCSF did, the people at UC Berkeley did, and they knew it, but they kept their mouths shut.

01:10:59.115 --> 01:10:59.715
I get it.

01:11:00.076 --> 01:11:03.298
I get it, but we have social media now.

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:11.805
We have 40 different military platforms that people are logged into, and those 40 military platforms didn't exist when you were trying to get the truth out about AIDS.

01:11:12.489 --> 01:11:13.190
They already knew it.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.812
The scientists knew it, but they kept their mouth shut.

01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:16.613
I knew these people.

01:11:16.633 --> 01:11:19.015
So David, hold that thought quite right.

01:11:19.215 --> 01:11:20.156
Nick's got his hand up.

01:11:20.956 --> 01:11:31.125
But David, the difference this time is many, many millions of people, many billions maybe, have suffered greatly, and they don't even know, a lot of them, how much they've suffered.

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:33.227
Because they're in Stockholm Syndrome.

01:11:33.567 --> 01:11:34.829
They're in Stockholm Syndrome.

01:11:34.929 --> 01:11:36.050
That's a nice distinction.

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.250
Nick?

01:11:38.243 --> 01:11:40.044
Yeah, just quickly, thank you.

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:41.185
It's been a great discussion.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:54.035
It's been a long time since I met anybody sensible who thinks that there was a pandemic, and that's progress, and well done to a lot of you for promoting that version of events.

01:11:54.816 --> 01:12:03.123
I think that if we are in the business of trying to discover the truth, then one of the things we need to do is take a good hard look at the most censored topics.

01:12:03.763 --> 01:12:17.214
And it's so interesting that Sucharit led in with the RKI files, because there are two topics closely related to those which are among the most censored that we can't get people to go and face.

01:12:17.895 --> 01:12:23.839
And the one is the important role that Germany played politically

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.821
in the whole story.

01:12:27.362 --> 01:12:38.608
If you are one of the proponents of the view that Germany had a central role instead of the false dichotomy of DoD or China, then you will be severely censored on social media.

01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:51.535
If you point out that BioNTech is the item of interest and not Pfizer, and if you insist on people naming the correct culprit in the biggest fraud of them all, you will be censored.

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:55.216
Those are two German-related stories.

01:12:55.456 --> 01:13:08.260
But more importantly than both of those, I would say is we have a situation where if you step out

01:13:09.443 --> 01:13:17.274
and say what JJ has said, that an injection is incompatible with developing an immune response.

01:13:18.256 --> 01:13:20.499
You will be frozen to death.

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:26.721
the idea that... So, Nick, just hold on.

01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:27.861
We'll say goodbye to Nick.

01:13:28.102 --> 01:13:30.022
We'll say goodbye to Jay, because he has to go.

01:13:30.263 --> 01:13:31.263
And you keep going, Nick.

01:13:31.283 --> 01:13:32.584
So, Jay, thank you so much.

01:13:33.384 --> 01:13:34.144
Yes, thank you, Jay.

01:13:34.325 --> 01:13:36.586
Great work you're doing and being provocative.

01:13:36.606 --> 01:13:37.006
Thank you very much.

01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:38.627
I'm sorry I have to leave.

01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:44.509
I'm often in the audience as an iPhone, but I'm here and thank you very much for all of your attention.

01:13:44.549 --> 01:13:45.390
I really appreciate it.

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:47.911
Sukrit, you're one of my heroes, man.

01:13:47.951 --> 01:13:48.671
I don't know what to say.

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:49.232
I wouldn't have made it.

01:13:49.252 --> 01:13:51.653
Well, you're one of ours, Jay.

01:13:54.234 --> 01:14:01.636
We'll try and set up another meeting, because I think it's very good to talk like this.

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:03.717
I also have to interrupt.

01:14:03.797 --> 01:14:04.857
I have to leave as well.

01:14:05.297 --> 01:14:06.498
But I want to stay connected.

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:06.938
Okay.

01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:11.219
I mean, I came on because JJ and Dr. Bakker was on.

01:14:11.639 --> 01:14:13.080
So I need more information.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.940
So keep me keep inviting me.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:16.701
Okay.

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:17.401
Thank you so much.

01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:18.161
Thank you.

01:14:18.181 --> 01:14:18.361
Thank you.

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:33.008
Okay, so Nick, keep going because we're recording this and then Ron's staff can look at it and all of us can re-look at it and think through.

01:14:33.108 --> 01:14:33.890
Keep going, right Nick?

01:14:35.109 --> 01:14:50.332
Okay, and then the other point I was leading up to just in the context of suppressed narratives, you know, from the International COVID Summit 2 till about, I think it was 4, I was, yeah, I was a participant and speaker.

01:14:52.013 --> 01:14:57.614
And I got to know several of the salient individuals there, including Robert Malone.

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:04.738
And things came unstuck there for me when it came to ICS-5.

01:15:05.278 --> 01:15:13.964
And by then I was on like a, it wasn't ever really formalized, but there was sort of a committee that would meet and talk about the speakers roster.

01:15:14.975 --> 01:15:24.197
And I said, look, at the moment, if we're not all agreeing that COVID was a political and not a medical event, then I think we're wasting our time.

01:15:24.337 --> 01:15:41.320
And what disturbed me about ICS4 in Romania is that all the people who were there to deposit a political message were relegated to the arse end of the two-day session in favor of absolutely bizarre topics like how to use barometric

01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:45.583
treatment modalities to treat long COVID.

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:47.985
You know, does the world really need to hear that?

01:15:49.026 --> 01:15:51.568
But yes, apparently, according to ICS4, it did.

01:15:52.268 --> 01:16:02.916
And so the speakers who had something to say about COVID as a political phenomenon were crammed into the last few minutes when the hall was empty, the videos were an absolute mess.

01:16:03.597 --> 01:16:05.718
And so I got up there, I said, I'm not coming again.

01:16:06.599 --> 01:16:15.065
And yes, we all agree that if we're discussing a political phenomenon, the majority of the speakers ought to be people of a political inclination.

01:16:15.365 --> 01:16:15.985
Absolutely.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:16.926
Yeah.

01:16:17.386 --> 01:16:18.427
Good for you, Nick.

01:16:19.147 --> 01:16:21.569
At that point, I got thrown out of the whole story.

01:16:21.969 --> 01:16:22.870
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:27.736
The loan blocked me and it cut off all communications.

01:16:27.756 --> 01:16:34.083
After two years, including trips together and lots of interaction, I was completely frozen out.

01:16:34.163 --> 01:16:35.905
And that goes back to my original point.

01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:39.329
Concentrate on the narratives that are suppressed.

01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:41.251
And these are the narratives that are suppressed.

01:16:41.271 --> 01:16:41.691
Absolutely.

01:16:41.991 --> 01:16:42.732
Very good, Nick.

01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:47.818
So Nick, I was in contact with the two people I knew.

01:16:48.539 --> 01:16:57.949
One was American, I won't say the name, but one was Italian, and he was willing to listen to me.

01:16:58.069 --> 01:17:01.834
I told him that I see one, in my opinion, they had the wrong speakers there.

01:17:02.274 --> 01:17:03.636
I won't say which ones were wrong.

01:17:04.918 --> 01:17:14.559
And so I had them interested for a while, but the female was a bit mysterious, you know, she kept her cards close to her chest, the one in America.

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:19.411
She was trying to persuade me, Nick, I'll just tell the truth now.

01:17:19.751 --> 01:17:26.153
She was trying to persuade me that we needed to have Robert Malone heavily involved.

01:17:26.273 --> 01:17:34.716
And I said, no, I think that Robert Malone, I don't have anything against him, but I don't think he's the one with the answers.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:41.318
I think he has too much influence over your choices in ICS-1 or had.

01:17:42.038 --> 01:17:43.399
And guess what happened?

01:17:44.406 --> 01:17:45.046
It disappeared.

01:17:45.266 --> 01:17:46.967
And that was after about five.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:50.669
And so they were both going to listen to me.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.890
So I think it was his cousin, the Italian guy.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.991
It was his American cousin.

01:17:56.571 --> 01:18:11.077
And essentially, I could not get the speakers I wanted on ICS2, or they wouldn't even consider them if Malone wasn't included.

01:18:13.479 --> 01:18:22.461
Yeah, there's a very strong element of sustaining the pandemic narrative in the ICS community.

01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:26.962
And to that extent, I believe the whole operation is essentially flawed.

01:18:27.822 --> 01:18:29.163
It's leading people astray.

01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:30.283
There was no pandemic.

01:18:30.383 --> 01:18:31.903
It's very important to understand that.

01:18:32.163 --> 01:18:39.205
And just the circuit, what you're proposing in Australia, there was a major push to have a Senate inquiry.

01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:42.867
on the whole, just on a simple number of excess deaths.

01:18:43.348 --> 01:18:45.209
It got through by one vote.

01:18:45.529 --> 01:18:48.731
All of the submissions that were filed were ignored by the Senate.

01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:53.254
It was a very short hearing and the fix is on.

01:18:53.855 --> 01:19:03.721
However, in Australia, last Friday, a local municipality passed a resolution that I'm sure many of you have seen, the Port Hedland Council,

01:19:04.522 --> 01:19:08.003
You know, and they've announced that they're taking these steps.

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:15.306
And already the state government is saying to the Port Hedland Council, keep your nose out of this stuff.

01:19:15.786 --> 01:19:18.247
There's a lot to be said for Sukrit, for what you're saying.

01:19:18.307 --> 01:19:19.768
Ron says, I can't do it at the top.

01:19:20.128 --> 01:19:26.390
Yes, but we can take your advice, your comments, Sukrit, at the bottom, at local municipalities.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:31.792
And there are people on this call doing it at a county level, county by county in California.

01:19:32.132 --> 01:19:33.573
Julie Threatt is doing that.

01:19:34.154 --> 01:19:36.381
with Ron Owens, OK?

01:19:38.884 --> 01:19:41.906
Yeah, sure, good.

01:19:41.926 --> 01:19:44.228
Nick, I don't think it was just political either.

01:19:44.769 --> 01:19:51.594
I think it was a deliberate Trojan horse to push global totalitarianism.

01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:53.136
That's what COVID was.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:20:04.405
It was a Trojan horse amongst many Trojan horses, but arguably the most important Trojan horse because pandemics, in inverted commas, have the power to frighten people as they did.

01:20:06.342 --> 01:20:08.884
Including doctors, including doctors.

01:20:09.485 --> 01:20:19.632
Sukrit, on David Rasnick's point, and Nick, Stephen said, there are many thousands of academics now.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:23.094
David, it didn't happen in the 80s.

01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:26.597
The gift of COVID has been a large awakening.

01:20:26.677 --> 01:20:29.059
Sukrit, is that your sense, Nick?

01:20:29.779 --> 01:20:34.202
Many more academics and scientists are awake now than they were in the 80s.

01:20:35.529 --> 01:20:36.850
Oh, absolutely.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.311
I mean, we're looking at tens of thousands.

01:20:39.872 --> 01:20:43.294
You know what happened in Tokyo two weeks ago?

01:20:44.034 --> 01:20:50.999
This mass demonstration of 50,000 people and led by top scientists, Japanese scientists.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.322
So it's not as if no one is standing up.

01:20:58.123 --> 01:21:03.607
Many, many thousands, doctors, physicians, and scientists.

01:21:04.597 --> 01:21:06.598
are fully awake and aware.

01:21:07.239 --> 01:21:23.830
And that's why I think, as I say, the time has really now come for these official parliamentary committees to be set up, because they will invite the experts.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.743
to come and talk in front of Parliament.

01:21:29.803 --> 01:21:37.210
This happens in front of Parliament, not on the streets, not in any theatres anywhere, but in the Parliament.

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:43.816
And these sessions are recorded and have to be recorded.

01:21:44.797 --> 01:21:49.241
And they get out into the media.

01:21:50.302 --> 01:21:51.002
They always do.

01:21:51.883 --> 01:21:56.905
So I'm placing my hopes in this.

01:21:58.506 --> 01:22:04.969
And I'm really talking to the top politicians.

01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:11.112
And they have told me that this is now, they've already done it.

01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:20.458
The committees are being set up now, as I said, in Saxony, in Thuringen and in Brandenburg.

01:22:22.284 --> 01:22:31.392
So Senator Johnson seemed to think that, the same as I thought, that something in Germany changed in this last week, Sukrit.

01:22:31.432 --> 01:22:34.674
So there was something that they were investigating.

01:22:34.714 --> 01:22:35.875
Maybe it was a false story.

01:22:36.576 --> 01:22:40.559
So he seemed to know exactly the same as I seem to, I can't quite remember.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.285
They decided not to have an investigation into the policy response.

01:22:49.146 --> 01:22:49.526
Who did?

01:22:49.947 --> 01:22:51.068
The federal government or the

01:22:52.846 --> 01:22:55.387
Yeah, but it was a federal government.

01:22:55.427 --> 01:22:59.508
But the federal government, of course, is not so important.

01:22:59.928 --> 01:23:07.429
It's the state governments, you know, it's, it's, it's, this is a federal state.

01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:10.870
So, each state has its own parliament.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:17.972
Now, the federal government in Berlin is ruled, of course, by the other side.

01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:33.956
But it is only in East Germany, in the former East German states, that the AFD and the other party, Sarawakian Commission, have now risen to power.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:37.260
Okay, this happened in September.

01:23:38.288 --> 01:23:48.720
And now for the first time they are able to install these committees themselves for their own states.

01:23:49.421 --> 01:23:56.329
So these committees will only be operating for Thuringia and Saxony, but one state in

01:23:57.819 --> 01:23:58.981
is extremely important.

01:23:59.622 --> 01:24:00.103
Absolutely.

01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:09.316
Because if they come to a conclusion in one state, like in Saxony, the other states will ask, well, now what about us?

01:24:10.077 --> 01:24:10.378
Okay.

01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:10.678
Sure.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.362
Yeah, like a precedent.

01:24:14.654 --> 01:24:30.816
so you're not you're not so so interested you're sorry you're not so disappointed that the federal government has just no no no that was clear that okay yeah i understand that's but i think that's what senator johnson that heard you say so but that that is meaningless yeah very good

01:24:31.243 --> 01:24:32.004
We all know that.

01:24:32.584 --> 01:24:43.336
And the other country where the really federal government is going to install a committee of inquiry is Austria.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.358
Because in Austria, this

01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:51.701
FPO or FPO has won the majority.

01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:59.983
And the number of seats that they have suffice for them as a party alone to install a committee.

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:01.404
And they're going to do it.

01:25:02.124 --> 01:25:05.485
It's going to happen, I think, in November.

01:25:06.448 --> 01:25:20.958
But Sukrit, we've had a public inquiry in the United Kingdom, and clearly the chair of the inquiry thinks that her job is to warn the British public that they were terribly treated by the British government.

01:25:21.058 --> 01:25:28.804
Every man, woman, and child suffered at the hands of the British government, I think were her exact words, but may have gotten slightly wrong.

01:25:29.684 --> 01:25:35.771
And her perception was that in the next pandemic they have to do much better.

01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:39.375
In other words, lock people down earlier and harder.

01:25:40.117 --> 01:25:43.279
what's happening in Germany and Austria is not a public inquiry.

01:25:43.599 --> 01:25:45.540
It's not a public inquiry.

01:25:46.281 --> 01:25:52.184
It is there will be a parliamentary committee.

01:25:53.085 --> 01:26:05.392
You know, this committee is going to be installed by the politicians themselves.

01:26:05.872 --> 01:26:08.974
And since the AFD have the majority

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:12.034
The committee will be composed mainly of them.

01:26:13.756 --> 01:26:17.940
And they all want to have this question settled.

01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:19.642
That's what I've been telling you.

01:26:19.782 --> 01:26:21.804
Have just one question settled.

01:26:22.985 --> 01:26:28.591
Was the vaccine authorization process in Germany lawful?

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.221
the simple answer will be no.

01:26:33.842 --> 01:26:34.962
Yes, of course it wasn't lawful.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:39.865
And once that's been established it'll open the floodgates for what else was not lawful.

01:26:40.866 --> 01:26:52.412
No, I don't really care but the moment that happens the vaccine's authorization is invalid and therefore they will not be able to apply them.

01:26:53.132 --> 01:26:53.693
I understand.

01:26:54.535 --> 01:26:57.276
Not only this vaccine, but all RNA vaccines.

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:01.858
You know the RSV vaccine is out now, and the flu vaccine is out now.

01:27:02.479 --> 01:27:03.139
And the shingles.

01:27:03.479 --> 01:27:06.440
And the shingles.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:14.984
The moment the judgment is passed that the authorization process was not lawful, then there was no authorization, right?

01:27:15.913 --> 01:27:17.674
Correct.

01:27:17.714 --> 01:27:27.236
David's hand is up and we've had Angus Dalgleish coming on a tour of Australia in the last week and that's, he's messy, he's coming out hard and has been going around the world.

01:27:27.556 --> 01:27:29.397
No more mRNA jabs.

01:27:29.857 --> 01:27:31.578
So that's also building on that.

01:27:31.598 --> 01:27:31.918
David.

01:27:31.938 --> 01:27:39.080
Yeah, I just want to say that I think we scientists, our job is to learn what's going on.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.861
We don't have time and the other people aren't going to understand the technical stuff.

01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:46.558
We have to just come out in mass and say it's a fraud.

01:27:47.338 --> 01:27:48.519
Yes, I agree with you, David.

01:27:48.879 --> 01:27:49.720
Yep, I agree.

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:55.103
And the more of us that say it, okay, if they ask us, how do you know?

01:27:55.163 --> 01:27:56.324
I'll be happy to tell them.

01:27:56.684 --> 01:28:00.366
But we have to start out with something they understand.

01:28:00.446 --> 01:28:01.367
Okay, what's a fraud?

01:28:01.427 --> 01:28:02.707
It's dangerous, it's going to kill you.

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:04.448
How has your life been?

01:28:05.729 --> 01:28:06.650
Well, you get the idea.

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:10.492
The idea is to try to convince people of the technical stuff.

01:28:11.414 --> 01:28:14.497
come out as scientists and professionals and say what we know.

01:28:14.658 --> 01:28:15.358
It's a fraud.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:16.480
Sure.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.161
And David, you're absolutely right.

01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:21.025
In the UK now, I can say that to people.

01:28:21.656 --> 01:28:22.636
I get their attention.

01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:25.797
They say, well, how do you know that?

01:28:25.817 --> 01:28:29.557
And I say, well, all this usual stuff.

01:28:30.017 --> 01:28:31.158
And they really listen now.

01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:32.438
Two years ago, they didn't.

01:28:33.138 --> 01:28:35.338
But not all of them listen now.

01:28:35.819 --> 01:28:36.859
A lot of them want to do this.

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:42.900
You can see that they want to put their hands over their ears so they don't hear anything more which disturbs their minds.

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.980
I mean, I feel sorry for them.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.241
But on the other hand, these people are keeping us in prison and ruining our lives.

01:28:50.578 --> 01:28:51.731
and everybody else's lives.

01:28:54.394 --> 01:28:59.177
People who are terrified of keeping us all in prison.

01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:00.498
That's very good.

01:29:00.518 --> 01:29:01.959
It's a clear message.

01:29:02.259 --> 01:29:07.123
And what Ron Johnson wants to be able to say is, how does he use this information?

01:29:07.163 --> 01:29:07.783
We've got offers.

01:29:07.803 --> 01:29:09.204
We'll share those offers now.

01:29:09.244 --> 01:29:14.227
We've got a lot of hands up, Nick and Sukrit and Steven and David.

01:29:14.288 --> 01:29:15.749
So shall we go to them?

01:29:15.789 --> 01:29:18.991
We've got less than an hour to go.

01:29:19.211 --> 01:29:20.532
Sukrit, you're okay for questions?

01:29:23.094 --> 01:29:23.654
How are you placed?

01:29:26.411 --> 01:29:27.575
Sukrit, are you okay?

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:28.397
No, I have no question.

01:29:28.939 --> 01:29:29.501
No, no, sorry.

01:29:30.102 --> 01:29:31.426
Are you okay to answer questions?

01:29:33.078 --> 01:29:36.320
Sure, but I don't know what they have now actually.

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.841
No, no, we'll just, whatever time you got.

01:29:38.921 --> 01:29:39.582
Let's get into it.

01:29:39.602 --> 01:29:41.062
Half an hour, okay.

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:42.383
Half an hour, Charles.

01:29:42.783 --> 01:29:43.904
Great, okay.

01:29:43.984 --> 01:29:44.344
Thank you.

01:29:44.824 --> 01:29:49.447
Let's go, and I think, who had his first, I think Anders, you had your hand up first.

01:29:50.187 --> 01:29:53.249
We'll go Anders, then John, so go Anders.

01:29:53.649 --> 01:29:54.890
And we'll make the questions.

01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:57.812
Please, can you ask the questions in two minutes?

01:29:57.872 --> 01:29:58.552
That should be enough.

01:29:58.992 --> 01:29:59.172
Yeah.

01:29:59.893 --> 01:30:00.193
Okay.

01:30:01.391 --> 01:30:05.253
So I think the problem is still ongoing, and it's not just mRNA.

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:16.600
The latest anti-flu shots, the dentist, anything you do, it's full of the same, which is not really mRNA.

01:30:16.721 --> 01:30:20.083
It is magnetic injections of nanomaterials.

01:30:21.163 --> 01:30:22.764
This is a major issue.

01:30:23.105 --> 01:30:24.846
The historical issue is that

01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:26.905
It was a fraud.

01:30:28.126 --> 01:30:39.648
Robert Koch, he defined the protocol and basically there has never been any evidence of any virus according to Robert Koch protocol.

01:30:40.369 --> 01:30:53.492
So, and this has been pushed for 120 years and people still, most people believe they need to take any vaccination because there is a claimed virus which does not exist according to scientific method.

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:56.972
So this is one problem.

01:30:57.172 --> 01:31:15.324
The second problem is that for 170 years, people have been polluted with radiology, with electromagnetic frequencies, which has increased a million times or more the last 25 years.

01:31:16.985 --> 01:31:18.326
And this radiology

01:31:19.617 --> 01:31:36.853
it gives recently digital pulses into the humans, into the magnetic material, which causes another antenna in the body, which is then causing the harm to a big extent.

01:31:37.934 --> 01:31:45.180
And this is the main problem, in my opinion, that you have this mechanism, not just from the

01:31:47.737 --> 01:31:55.041
injections, but now from the chemtrails, from the polluted food, water, milk, anything.

01:31:56.042 --> 01:32:03.506
And this is the GM, it is the pesticide, it is the water, and this is the whole program.

01:32:03.606 --> 01:32:05.948
It's a total extermination program.

01:32:06.128 --> 01:32:07.929
I assess now... What's your question?

01:32:08.169 --> 01:32:08.809
Now the question.

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:14.993
Yeah, this is the problem of fraud in science and people

01:32:15.754 --> 01:32:26.003
don't realize this and I will just ask can you please look into this Dr. Suraj Bhakti because this is the wider context of the problem.

01:32:27.267 --> 01:32:34.331
Well, if I may just briefly answer, all of this is overwhelming me.

01:32:35.532 --> 01:32:38.333
My capacity is limited, simply.

01:32:39.194 --> 01:32:48.960
And I have to focus my energy on subjects that I think I can handle.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:54.423
Now, everything that you say may well be true, and I'm afraid they are true.

01:32:55.163 --> 01:32:58.706
But I do not have the capacity to enter into these fields.

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.668
I hope you realize this.

01:33:01.708 --> 01:33:02.469
I'm retired.

01:33:05.331 --> 01:33:07.553
We have a little family to take care of.

01:33:08.354 --> 01:33:14.499
And this Corona business has been sapping my energy for four and a half years now.

01:33:15.319 --> 01:33:23.406
So I think this has to be left over to other people like you and others who are in on the subject.

01:33:25.706 --> 01:33:26.927
Very good, Sukrit.

01:33:28.148 --> 01:33:33.112
And Anders is fighting the good fight, so he will continue, as will Mark Steele, as will others.

01:33:33.192 --> 01:33:35.353
So Sukrit, thank you for that response.

01:33:35.434 --> 01:33:46.162
Nick, is there anything you want to say on Anders' proposition on the whole question of 5G and the impact of the injections plus the 5G EMRs and the like?

01:33:49.605 --> 01:33:51.827
So, are you talking to us, Nick?

01:33:52.227 --> 01:33:52.448
Yes.

01:33:53.188 --> 01:33:53.649
Yes, Nick.

01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:54.630
Oh, sorry.

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.973
If you want to make a comment, just put your hand up.

01:33:59.154 --> 01:34:00.315
We'll just keep going to the questions.

01:34:00.395 --> 01:34:00.695
Okay.

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:01.616
Okay.

01:34:01.656 --> 01:34:04.919
Yeah, I do have one short comment on the radiation story.

01:34:06.019 --> 01:34:25.085
I think it's a very interesting area, and I'm certainly receptive to opinions, but the one thing I would point out is that dose response is largely ignored by the most ardent activists in this field, and I think they do so to tremendous harm to their arguments.

01:34:27.808 --> 01:34:35.357
To talk about a million-fold increase, for example, yeah, I can imagine that the total volume of waves being pumped out has gone up a million-fold.

01:34:35.858 --> 01:34:40.744
But there's this notion of nonlinear dose response, which is

01:34:41.685 --> 01:34:43.426
just universal.

01:34:43.866 --> 01:34:46.928
Water has a nonlinear dose response.

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:49.529
COVID vaccines have a nonlinear dose response.

01:34:49.869 --> 01:34:52.230
Everything you can imagine has a nonlinear dose response.

01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:58.113
There's a range during which is potentially helpful and then a range at which it gets very dangerous.

01:34:58.553 --> 01:35:02.695
If you sleep with a 5G transmitter next to your bed, it's almost certainly harmful.

01:35:03.175 --> 01:35:08.277
But people get a bit too doctrinaire in the absence of robust

01:35:09.918 --> 01:35:15.062
not just robust studies, but even robust explanations for how this harm would take place.

01:35:16.023 --> 01:35:21.307
So I'm receptive, but I'm not going down the rabbit hole with any venom and force.

01:35:21.887 --> 01:35:24.609
Because I don't think the answers have been delivered.

01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.791
Absolutely right.

01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:30.914
That's what I tried to do as well, but I'm not as successful as you.

01:35:33.023 --> 01:35:45.747
But I've realized in this group tonight, I can see a little team that we can assemble around Ron Johnson, because he was more or less asking for that, and I'll contact you after the meeting.

01:35:45.887 --> 01:35:57.770
So, but I don't want to say who, but I think I can see a team forming, and I hope that, Sukrit, you don't want to be part of the team, it sounds like, Sukrit, but maybe you can be our

01:35:59.275 --> 01:36:03.496
executive advisor, or whatever you want to call it, you know.

01:36:03.596 --> 01:36:07.258
Or we can appoint you to Ron Johnson as his executive advisor.

01:36:08.678 --> 01:36:11.619
As long as I don't have to do too much, it's all right.

01:36:12.059 --> 01:36:12.479
Well said.

01:36:12.499 --> 01:36:14.260
All right, let's keep going with the questions.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.021
John, look out, and then Julie.

01:36:16.901 --> 01:36:18.882
Look, we've got a John and a Julie in a gym.

01:36:19.022 --> 01:36:19.282
Gosh.

01:36:21.863 --> 01:36:27.925
I had a question for Ron Johnson, and I had a question for JJ, and they're both gone.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.847
Dr. Bhakti, I'll throw this at you just to see if you have an opinion.

01:36:39.049 --> 01:36:41.270
Listen to JJ's last presentation.

01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:50.634
He brought up this whole new angle here about pure oxygen, 60 liters per minute causing harm.

01:36:52.215 --> 01:36:55.156
I have yet to hear anybody explain this to me.

01:36:55.897 --> 01:37:02.019
How does, where does that leave hyperbaric oxygen as a therapy?

01:37:03.562 --> 01:37:05.503
it, are we harming ourselves with that?

01:37:05.583 --> 01:37:13.527
I mean, let me just say before you answer, I've gotten into one of those tanks once for about an hour, but I don't know what was being administered.

01:37:13.567 --> 01:37:15.328
I know it was oxygen.

01:37:15.368 --> 01:37:16.429
I know it was concentrated.

01:37:16.469 --> 01:37:17.869
I know it was a couple of atmospheres.

01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:19.130
That's all I know.

01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:20.431
I don't know how much I got.

01:37:20.951 --> 01:37:22.332
I felt great afterwards.

01:37:22.832 --> 01:37:24.453
Do we need to back away from that?

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.002
No, listen, I'm not a pulmonologist, all right?

01:37:29.022 --> 01:37:31.122
I just want to say one thing.

01:37:31.663 --> 01:37:48.050
There is no general answer to such a question, because hyperbaric oxygen is indicated in certain diseases and illnesses, but certainly not in people with respiratory diseases like corona.

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:51.231
And there Jay is completely right.

01:37:51.852 --> 01:38:02.279
If you administer something that is potentially toxic and dangerous to the wrong patients, you kill them.

01:38:02.759 --> 01:38:16.668
And it's been known all the time that this hyperbaric oxygen therapy for so-called COVID patients was a mistake, was the wrong indication.

01:38:18.385 --> 01:38:37.172
Maybe I've got this mixed up, but it seems like, correct me somebody if I misheard this, but I thought he was saying that this was the first cause, not the second cause, and I may have that wrong.

01:38:37.392 --> 01:38:40.254
Yeah, it's not hyperbaric, it's high flow.

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:41.035
It's a distinction.

01:38:41.495 --> 01:38:44.637
High flow oxygen is administered through a nasal cannula.

01:38:45.138 --> 01:38:55.405
Hyperbaric oxygen is administered at pressure in a unit designed to basically to layer on pressure beyond normal atmospheric pressure.

01:38:55.725 --> 01:38:57.246
They're two very different types of treatment.

01:38:59.588 --> 01:39:02.329
Thank you for that clarification, Nick.

01:39:02.789 --> 01:39:08.872
So the hyperbaric oxygen is administered to Djokovic, John?

01:39:10.752 --> 01:39:15.974
Well, Nick, I think that in Germany they were using hyperbaric.

01:39:16.475 --> 01:39:19.996
They were intubated and they pumped the oxygen in.

01:39:21.161 --> 01:39:21.541
Okay.

01:39:21.641 --> 01:39:21.841
Yeah.

01:39:21.861 --> 01:39:31.784
So there may have been slight positive pressure, but it's not the same as getting into a pressure vessel and going up to like diving depth pressures of oxygen.

01:39:32.324 --> 01:39:34.444
And I think- But they were intubated and ventilated.

01:39:35.405 --> 01:39:35.805
Yes.

01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:39.766
So with ventilators or prior to ventilation, that's the problem.

01:39:40.246 --> 01:39:46.107
They would put these patients on nasal cannulas administering almost pure oxygen.

01:39:46.127 --> 01:39:47.087
No, no, no.

01:39:47.227 --> 01:39:49.288
In Germany, they were immediately intubated.

01:39:50.049 --> 01:39:52.171
Yes, yeah, I'm aware that that happened.

01:39:52.211 --> 01:39:54.752
In America, though.

01:39:54.812 --> 01:39:55.633
Yeah.

01:39:56.534 --> 01:39:56.754
Yeah.

01:39:57.594 --> 01:40:08.302
But do you remember there was that Kyle, that Dr. Kyle Sedell, who came out and blew open the tragedy of the ventilators and said, what we should be doing is high flow nasal oxygen.

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:16.788
And that was a mistake, because what happened was the high flow nasal oxygen took perfectly healthy people and did lung damage, and then they put them on ventilators.

01:40:16.828 --> 01:40:17.208
So that was

01:40:18.129 --> 01:40:19.549
actually a core part of the scam.

01:40:19.829 --> 01:40:30.151
And JJ speaks very clearly on this, and has read the enormous literature showing that this type of treatment is devastating and to be avoided.

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:33.992
But it became standard in a large number of countries, including South Africa.

01:40:34.452 --> 01:40:34.652
Yeah.

01:40:36.252 --> 01:40:37.012
So he was right.

01:40:38.373 --> 01:40:38.613
Who?

01:40:38.733 --> 01:40:39.113
JJ?

01:40:39.373 --> 01:40:40.493
Yes, JJ was right.

01:40:40.533 --> 01:40:40.753
Yes.

01:40:41.033 --> 01:40:43.094
Okay, so I have nothing more to add.

01:40:43.714 --> 01:40:44.714
Okay, on we go.

01:40:45.254 --> 01:40:45.554
Julie.

01:40:47.005 --> 01:40:47.485
Hi, you guys.

01:40:47.505 --> 01:40:48.206
Hi, everybody.

01:40:48.226 --> 01:40:48.926
Hi, Sukrit.

01:40:49.827 --> 01:40:54.670
I wanted to give you maybe a little bit of hope, and I can hear it in your voice, and we're all kind of just exhausted.

01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:56.492
I mean, God, it's almost been four years, five years.

01:40:57.432 --> 01:41:01.035
So yeah, so Ron and I are fighting at the county level here in California.

01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:06.999
We were at Colusa County this morning, and it was probably the most positive reaction I've had from supervisors, right?

01:41:07.579 --> 01:41:09.100
And I think Ron would agree.

01:41:09.601 --> 01:41:13.003
And what I asked of them was, look, you've got, it's a small county.

01:41:13.143 --> 01:41:13.423
It's 22,000 people.

01:41:14.724 --> 01:41:17.146
So probably of that county, 12,000 are vaccinated.

01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:22.251
Hey, listen, why don't you send a letter to your entire county and ask them how their health condition is today?

01:41:22.532 --> 01:41:23.853
They know who's vaccinated.

01:41:23.873 --> 01:41:26.896
They've got their address and their names in the immunization database.

01:41:27.016 --> 01:41:31.841
So it's very simple to send them a letter or just send the vaccinated a letter and say, hey, we know you were vaccinated.

01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:33.742
We've heard that there's some potential issues.

01:41:34.063 --> 01:41:35.124
What is your health like today?

01:41:35.464 --> 01:41:35.845
Is it good?

01:41:35.885 --> 01:41:36.545
Is it better?

01:41:36.605 --> 01:41:37.426
Is it indifferent?

01:41:37.747 --> 01:41:39.189
And maybe the person's dead, et cetera.

01:41:39.249 --> 01:41:51.504
So I think if we start at those county levels, and I'm going to send Ron a message about that because, you know, he can look at Wisconsin, right, and go, look, Wisconsin's got like, I don't know, 3.9 million people of which 75% are vaccinated.

01:41:51.544 --> 01:41:52.425
Send those people a letter.

01:41:52.485 --> 01:41:54.647
And we're the clinical trial of vaccinated people.

01:41:55.188 --> 01:41:55.928
How do you study us?

01:41:56.068 --> 01:41:59.349
Send us a freaking letter and ask us, is your health better, worse, et cetera?

01:41:59.489 --> 01:42:00.529
Did you follow VAERS report?

01:42:00.569 --> 01:42:01.129
That kind of thing.

01:42:01.369 --> 01:42:03.470
I know it costs money, but that's just a simple idea.

01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:07.250
But yeah, this Colusa County, they defied the lockdowns.

01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:09.751
They defied Gavin Newsom and said, no, we're not locking down.

01:42:10.351 --> 01:42:14.872
So these supervisors are probably the bravest, most patriotic freedom fighters that I've faced so far.

01:42:14.952 --> 01:42:16.752
So they were pretty impressed.

01:42:16.792 --> 01:42:18.992
We gave them a lot of material in their hands.

01:42:19.152 --> 01:42:22.233
And so we're hoping that they'll follow up with us and we'll get their sheriff involved.

01:42:22.873 --> 01:42:24.654
My second point is Moderna.

01:42:24.774 --> 01:42:26.595
I don't know why we're not going after Moderna.

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:28.336
Moderna is an American company.

01:42:28.576 --> 01:42:30.597
It's the one that was created, I think, by the DOD.

01:42:30.617 --> 01:42:39.242
Stéphane Banzel is the CEO, this French guy who worked for this BioMiro that helped build the lab in Wuhan.

01:42:39.403 --> 01:42:48.488
I don't know why we don't have Banzel in front of Congress and hold Moderna, whose manufacturing facilities are in America, and focus on Moderna and not this beast of Pfizer.

01:42:49.048 --> 01:42:52.269
Number three, I put the nine second clip of Javier Becerra.

01:42:52.289 --> 01:42:59.231
So HHS Secretary Javier Becerra, the highest level man over the CDC, FDA, CMS, NIH.

01:42:59.732 --> 01:43:06.414
He's got nine seconds on a YouTube video at the White House briefing saying that the vaccines are killing blacks at two times the rate of whites.

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:21.199
If Ron Johnson takes that nine-second clip and blasts it in a congressional hearing, go on the floor and blast this nine-second clip and call out Xavier Becerra and take him to task, to me, that would be another big opportunity that he can move forward on.

01:43:21.999 --> 01:43:26.220
And then just last, you know, americansforhealthfreedom.org, that's Dr. Mary Talley-Bowden.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.442
There's a few hundred other candidates and elected officials that are trying really hard.

01:43:30.482 --> 01:43:33.183
I just don't think they can see the forest through the trees.

01:43:33.243 --> 01:43:36.504
And so, yeah, if we get anything together with Ron Johnson,

01:43:36.724 --> 01:43:47.032
being a vaccine-injured person working in these clinics, I have a ton of ideas and a ton of information on how things were administered and stored and the problems, and I think I can give them a lot of ideas.

01:43:47.112 --> 01:43:51.275
But Sukrit, we're trying, and I think together we will, you know, get through this.

01:43:51.675 --> 01:43:56.359
My only other question for you, I asked it last time, how's the king of Thailand's daughter?

01:43:56.379 --> 01:43:58.480
She's the one that was vaccine-injured.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:58.960
Thank you.

01:44:00.442 --> 01:44:02.423
Well, there is no answer to the last.

01:44:03.924 --> 01:44:08.107
I am afraid that she is not amongst us.

01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:14.893
You know that he also has a son who has a turbo cancer.

01:44:17.375 --> 01:44:18.455
A doctor in America.

01:44:20.237 --> 01:44:20.457
Wow.

01:44:22.479 --> 01:44:24.540
Sukrit also vaccinated the son?

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.742
Yes, yes, of course, they're all vaccinated.

01:44:27.543 --> 01:44:36.557
So Julie, the question that Sukrit is asking us to look at, and you might put it on the agenda, is to get the county supervisors.

01:44:36.778 --> 01:44:40.043
I think there are 57 counties in California, is that correct?

01:44:40.684 --> 01:44:40.824
Yeah, 58.

01:44:42.296 --> 01:44:47.821
58.

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:47.821
So what was the lawfulness of the VAX authorizations in the county?

01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:51.224
And just keep asking that question.

01:44:53.306 --> 01:44:57.410
Because Julie and Ron Owens are going to these counties.

01:44:58.531 --> 01:45:03.476
Investigate the lawfulness of the VAX authorizations.

01:45:04.518 --> 01:45:06.279
You know, the big thing for them, it's the money, right?

01:45:06.339 --> 01:45:12.543
So the counties were paid money to administer these shots, and they got immunization assistance money.

01:45:12.603 --> 01:45:15.304
So my county, they don't operate off any authority.

01:45:15.344 --> 01:45:16.485
They point to the state, right?

01:45:16.505 --> 01:45:19.267
It's the CDPH, it's the state that got the authorization.

01:45:19.667 --> 01:45:25.070
But because they got money, they're scared that if they, you know, defy the state that they'll have to pay the money.

01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:26.030
It's just ridiculous.

01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.511
It's stupid.

01:45:26.551 --> 01:45:28.452
But there was no authority at the county level.

01:45:28.772 --> 01:45:30.793
but they can certainly lock it up and stop it.

01:45:30.873 --> 01:45:34.374
Our sheriff can go lock up the vials at the public health department where she stores them.

01:45:34.734 --> 01:45:44.777
So it's finding brave people, brave sheriff with the brave supervisors and the ones that will wanna defy and push Gavin Newsom and say, screw you, we don't care.

01:45:44.857 --> 01:45:48.518
And Shasta County's one, Colusa County's one, and we'll see where the others fall out.

01:45:48.538 --> 01:45:51.299
Okay, yep, well said.

01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:54.380
All right, thank you, Julie.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:54.640
Jim.

01:45:57.054 --> 01:45:57.735
Thank you very much.

01:45:57.835 --> 01:46:03.319
And Senator Johnson asked a really good question.

01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:06.141
Why does nobody want to know?

01:46:07.462 --> 01:46:09.703
Why does nobody in Congress want to know?

01:46:11.104 --> 01:46:19.830
And so, Dr. Bhakti, you're the last man standing here, and I really appreciate all your efforts from the beginning of this.

01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:24.173
The answer to that is they have no courage

01:46:26.398 --> 01:46:33.201
There may be more than that.

01:46:33.361 --> 01:46:42.045
For instance, the inquiry as to who killed JFK, even Trump was scared to release who killed JFK.

01:46:42.065 --> 01:46:44.886
And we now know that it's intelligence agents who are involved.

01:46:48.753 --> 01:46:56.519
That leads us back to the intelligence community involvement with Pfizer as an intelligence operation, Gilead as an intelligence operation, Department of Defense.

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.785
And the former head of Gilead was Don Rumsfeld before he became Secretary of Defense.

01:47:03.805 --> 01:47:10.190
So we know that the Department of Defense is intertwined with the biopharmaceutical medical industry.

01:47:10.971 --> 01:47:26.168
The issue is the politicians are selfish and by their very nature they're always thinking of themselves, like many human beings in fact, but they're always thinking and what effect anything they might say might have on their political career.

01:47:26.508 --> 01:47:28.731
And we don't care about their political careers.

01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:29.812
They think we do.

01:47:32.034 --> 01:47:43.678
So my question for Dr. Bhakti is, it looks like the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, there's a getting a lot of press, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in vaccine or virus form seems to be a biological weapon.

01:47:45.478 --> 01:47:53.281
And this biological weapon, you know, there's a biological weapons convention that was signed by most of the countries.

01:47:55.922 --> 01:47:59.623
And except it looks like Israel may not have signed it.

01:48:00.763 --> 01:48:05.687
And so the question is really, are they the only ones who could have false flagged China with this?

01:48:06.367 --> 01:48:28.264
And would there be a, and since PNAC, New American Century document that was written by Victoria Newland's husband, and I put it in the chat earlier, says that there may be a use for a genetically specific agent

01:48:29.659 --> 01:48:36.661
Doesn't this all fit with the Georgia Guidestones that says depopulate the earth down to 500 million?

01:48:37.282 --> 01:48:47.365
Doesn't this look like a biological weapon that has been deployed to genetically specifically take down the world in the name of climate change by the people who invented it?

01:48:48.185 --> 01:48:56.028
And if so, and the Department of Defense is in on it, how are we gonna stop the Department of Defense teamed up with various countries

01:48:57.308 --> 01:49:07.601
including our own government that have agreed on depopulating the earth in the model of the Georgia Guidestones that we're standing up 90 feet tall in granite that were just blown up and we don't know who did it.

01:49:08.181 --> 01:49:09.103
We don't know who blew it up.

01:49:10.865 --> 01:49:11.646
How are we going to stop this?

01:49:12.509 --> 01:49:17.651
Well, Jim, listen, of course I agree with everything that you say.

01:49:19.972 --> 01:49:27.535
I also think that this global agenda has been created by a handful of devils, okay?

01:49:28.096 --> 01:49:31.117
And it's been carefully planned over decades.

01:49:31.897 --> 01:49:40.181
And now we are living through... Yeah, well...

01:49:41.795 --> 01:49:42.195
Tyranny.

01:49:42.635 --> 01:49:43.715
Tyranny, Sukrit.

01:49:43.795 --> 01:49:45.216
Not only tyranny.

01:49:45.296 --> 01:49:46.516
Well, nearly.

01:49:47.216 --> 01:49:48.136
It's the end game.

01:49:48.316 --> 01:49:49.997
It's the end game.

01:49:50.037 --> 01:49:50.837
Yes.

01:49:51.497 --> 01:50:06.080
So my only answer to that is that I see no way of stopping it by mass protests because of many reasons which we will not go into now.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.180
That is why I chose

01:50:09.554 --> 01:50:12.795
I have chosen the other way, which is through politics.

01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:17.518
Now, here, I would not entirely agree with Stephen.

01:50:17.998 --> 01:50:27.082
You say politicians are always greedy and thinking of their own... Selfish, I said, Socrates.

01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:31.951
selfish and narcissistic.

01:50:32.271 --> 01:50:34.372
They think we care about their careers.

01:50:36.273 --> 01:50:37.853
But there are exceptions.

01:50:37.973 --> 01:50:39.054
There are exceptions.

01:50:39.074 --> 01:50:41.555
Look at Ron Johnson.

01:50:42.715 --> 01:50:54.659
And thankfully, I'm very thankful for this, the exceptions in East Germany and in Austria.

01:50:55.663 --> 01:50:57.563
have now come into power.

01:50:57.783 --> 01:51:07.705
You see, this is the difference between these states and America and the rest of the world, because they are out to change things.

01:51:08.346 --> 01:51:18.248
And if things can be changed by the politicians themselves, they will, if they have the will to do so.

01:51:19.028 --> 01:51:24.689
And there's just been, you know, Paul asking for the opinion of people

01:51:25.154 --> 01:51:26.135
in the different parties.

01:51:27.116 --> 01:51:39.871
And 75% of the party that has won the elections in East Germany say they want to have an investigation committee set up in Parliament.

01:51:40.872 --> 01:51:41.873
And they're going to do it.

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.081
And the same in Austria.

01:51:45.161 --> 01:51:47.422
So it's a different situation, Stephen.

01:51:47.462 --> 01:51:49.063
You can't say it's the same situation.

01:51:49.103 --> 01:51:52.505
Well, let's hope they're bright enough to choose the right witnesses, Socrates.

01:51:52.565 --> 01:51:54.826
You need to tell them which witnesses to listen to.

01:51:55.467 --> 01:52:00.389
Well, Stephen, this is not a big secret, but of course I've already been asked.

01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:01.170
Good.

01:52:03.211 --> 01:52:03.671
Very good.

01:52:03.911 --> 01:52:10.415
There's another issue, and that is, it has to come from bottom up, from local,

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:24.038
from local municipalities, from local communities, because the German government, just like the Australian government, just like many other countries, are given instructions by the globalists.

01:52:24.338 --> 01:52:25.719
They're given instructions.

01:52:25.799 --> 01:52:29.422
If you don't behave in a particular way, we need to understand that.

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:30.443
That's the pressure.

01:52:30.763 --> 01:52:32.524
The US also has that same pressure.

01:52:32.844 --> 01:52:34.606
Bottom up, they don't have that control.

01:52:35.635 --> 01:52:44.967
But Charles, you see, the thing is that these new parties that have now taken over are not under control.

01:52:45.187 --> 01:52:47.590
They have not been bought and they will not be bought.

01:52:50.339 --> 01:52:52.320
They soon will be, probably, Sukharit.

01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.921
No, no, don't be... Stephen, let's not start discussing.

01:52:54.941 --> 01:52:56.102
Don't give us that negative shit.

01:52:56.182 --> 01:52:57.203
No, I don't know.

01:52:57.223 --> 01:52:58.683
I just have hope.

01:52:59.123 --> 01:52:59.444
OK.

01:52:59.464 --> 01:53:03.346
Well, I have hope, but I've lost a bit of faith in human beings.

01:53:03.866 --> 01:53:04.486
I haven't.

01:53:04.626 --> 01:53:04.906
I haven't.

01:53:04.926 --> 01:53:05.006
OK.

01:53:05.127 --> 01:53:06.947
I know this guy personally.

01:53:07.068 --> 01:53:08.868
We're befriended.

01:53:08.928 --> 01:53:09.249
Right.

01:53:09.289 --> 01:53:10.749
We've got two hands up.

01:53:10.769 --> 01:53:11.710
We've got Zorael.

01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:12.750
Stay here, Sukharit.

01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:14.832
We'll let you go after James Rogowski.

01:53:14.852 --> 01:53:16.352
But Zorael in Switzerland.

01:53:17.293 --> 01:53:17.413
OK.

01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:23.662
Good evening, Dr. Bhakti, and thank you for taking your time with us this evening.

01:53:23.782 --> 01:53:27.945
I would like to just clarify what Jim was saying a while ago.

01:53:28.445 --> 01:53:43.894
It was Robert Kagan who papered the project for New American Century, where they spoke about the cataclysmic changes that the United States has to go through, bar something like Pearl Harbor, for them to change the system in the United States.

01:53:44.654 --> 01:53:53.937
But coming back to you, certainly back to your comment of the King of Thailand's daughter who died, and I'm very sorry, and his son also.

01:53:53.957 --> 01:53:56.198
It's not an official statement.

01:53:56.238 --> 01:53:59.318
This has not officially been made.

01:53:59.498 --> 01:54:02.339
I know, but I have been following the story for quite some time.

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:07.481
I did want to know if there was any legal consequences, because we did hear

01:54:07.961 --> 01:54:14.724
that there was something coming for the WHO, that there was something, some kind of legal steps being taken.

01:54:14.784 --> 01:54:16.525
Can you speak about that?

01:54:17.286 --> 01:54:21.688
No, as you know, the situation in Thailand is complex.

01:54:21.948 --> 01:54:23.048
It is really complex.

01:54:23.729 --> 01:54:30.772
And I cannot and do not want to speak about it at the moment, because there are huge movements

01:54:33.652 --> 01:54:35.374
that are undercover, okay?

01:54:35.414 --> 01:54:37.255
Okay, understand.

01:54:37.275 --> 01:54:44.421
I'd like to come back to the, to the turbo cancer, which you spoke about also, because I have two data.

01:54:44.441 --> 01:54:48.304
I have actually data from Switzerland in, from 2021 and compared to 2016, 17, 18, all the way to 2021.

01:54:48.504 --> 01:54:50.566
In the year 2020 to 2021, there was an increase of 249%.

01:55:02.409 --> 01:55:05.290
of cancer between the ages of zero to 14.

01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:06.070
Sure.

01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:14.173
Do you have any new information for years 2022, 23 and 2024?

01:55:14.773 --> 01:55:15.413
Is there any?

01:55:16.073 --> 01:55:19.754
I don't keep track of the numbers, because numbers don't really interest me.

01:55:20.674 --> 01:55:25.856
What interests me is the mechanism of how these develop.

01:55:26.536 --> 01:55:29.557
And there, there's very, very interesting new data.

01:55:30.417 --> 01:55:32.318
which, however, I will not talk about.

01:55:34.179 --> 01:55:41.461
Many paths lead to Rome, and many paths lead to cancer in the vaccinated.

01:55:42.361 --> 01:55:43.782
They're now being unraveled.

01:55:45.802 --> 01:55:49.445
So some extremely exciting data coming out now.

01:55:50.286 --> 01:55:53.209
No, the question is, is there anywhere to find this data?

01:55:53.369 --> 01:55:54.290
No, not yet.

01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:55.291
It's not been published.

01:55:55.731 --> 01:56:06.801
Because I also have from Germany the excessive deaths, which was also on the data, on the file that I'm looking at, you can see that it was over, well over 150%.

01:56:06.901 --> 01:56:07.401
Sure, sure, sure.

01:56:07.421 --> 01:56:09.223
And there's no doubt at all

01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:14.111
the vaccines are doing this.

01:56:14.771 --> 01:56:15.452
There is no doubt.

01:56:16.713 --> 01:56:22.497
The question is how to prove it scientifically, with which data.

01:56:23.698 --> 01:56:28.601
And right now, very, very exciting things are happening.

01:56:29.322 --> 01:56:29.642
Really.

01:56:30.963 --> 01:56:36.267
So that with God's help, I'm not doing this work.

01:56:36.347 --> 01:56:38.629
It's the team, you know, around us.

01:56:40.268 --> 01:56:45.695
And they teamed up with Kevin McKernan, the German group, our group.

01:56:47.778 --> 01:56:55.068
Really, they have already discovered something that is so stunning.

01:56:57.743 --> 01:57:03.968
I tell them they should publish this as soon as possible, but they don't want to publish it until they know all the details.

01:57:04.068 --> 01:57:06.610
And I keep telling them, don't go for the details.

01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:10.574
It's enough now, you know, this data alone.

01:57:11.154 --> 01:57:12.075
The big idea, yeah.

01:57:13.362 --> 01:57:16.884
No, the data alone is showing something that is so stunning.

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:22.607
And should be enough to stop the whole thing.

01:57:22.627 --> 01:57:41.176
When you see the my big worry, worry, and I've been carrying this worry around with my myself for two years, is that so much attention is being paid to the spike protein.

01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:46.743
And everyone is saying that it's a spike, it's a bioweapon, you know, and all this.

01:57:49.284 --> 01:57:57.925
What I'm afraid of is that the guys behind the scenes are going to say, okay, we'll take down the COVID vaccine.

01:58:00.066 --> 01:58:07.287
But instead, all the other vaccines are going to come through the back door, as they are already doing now.

01:58:08.248 --> 01:58:09.588
And I want to warn the world

01:58:10.492 --> 01:58:20.223
not to fall for this ruse and not to give them the chance to step down with the COVID and then come in with the others.

01:58:20.944 --> 01:58:21.165
Correct.

01:58:21.185 --> 01:58:21.625
Absolutely.

01:58:21.645 --> 01:58:24.548
Because the others are going to cause exactly the same thing.

01:58:26.921 --> 01:58:39.792
Maybe that was why Barik was looking into the spike protein for 30 years, because they wanted to create this story, you know, about the spike protein, it was COVID was all about the spike protein.

01:58:40.113 --> 01:58:44.897
Yes, they could then take it away and then push the others, which they introduced.

01:58:46.098 --> 01:58:49.501
And I said, so I was warning people two and a half years ago,

01:58:50.939 --> 01:58:51.439
Malmo.

01:58:52.039 --> 01:58:52.819
I give this talk.

01:58:53.199 --> 01:58:59.021
And we've had Curtis Coste since 1991 warning against injections.

01:59:00.281 --> 01:59:04.902
So, everybody, no fucking injections.

01:59:04.962 --> 01:59:05.842
Thank you, Zarael.

01:59:05.862 --> 01:59:06.402
We'll go on.

01:59:07.082 --> 01:59:07.682
Thank you.

01:59:07.702 --> 01:59:13.064
Can I just say, Zarael, you know the project for the New American Century document you were talking about?

01:59:13.504 --> 01:59:13.624
Yes.

01:59:13.644 --> 01:59:17.765
So, I was very familiar with the people who drafted that, you know,

01:59:20.365 --> 01:59:25.607
Yeah, Shaney, Rumsfeld, a lot of them.

01:59:25.647 --> 01:59:26.768
Yeah, Pearl, another.

01:59:28.108 --> 01:59:39.933
And the line, the famous line that you were referring to, I think, was the Project for the New American Century was saying that all these changes are necessary for the good of America in the next century.

01:59:41.134 --> 01:59:44.936
And so it was the neocons who were behind this, as I understood it.

01:59:45.176 --> 01:59:45.376
Yes.

01:59:45.936 --> 01:59:54.018
And even the attorney general at the time, whose name was, it's gone, he was in on it as well.

01:59:54.298 --> 02:00:10.742
But the famous line you're talking about was that we, of course, we cannot do this without, including wars in Afghanistan and other states, you know, we cannot do this without a Pearl Harbor type event.

02:00:11.102 --> 02:00:11.503
Exactly.

02:00:11.543 --> 02:00:12.583
That was before

02:00:13.183 --> 02:00:13.943
9-11.

02:00:13.963 --> 02:00:18.145
9-11 was that Pearl Harbor type event.

02:00:18.265 --> 02:00:20.845
Exactly, that's correct.

02:00:21.365 --> 02:00:23.086
All right, thank you very much.

02:00:23.506 --> 02:00:24.186
Thanks, Uriel.

02:00:24.747 --> 02:00:25.287
James.

02:00:29.268 --> 02:00:31.869
Hey, thank you for all of this information.

02:00:32.489 --> 02:00:36.050
Dr. Bakhti, I want to ask you a very simple question.

02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:42.752
Can you repeat very clearly what your goal

02:00:43.684 --> 02:00:43.824
is.

02:00:44.764 --> 02:00:51.545
What I heard involved the WHO, and I've done a little bit of work on the WHO.

02:00:52.346 --> 02:01:00.927
And the question is, are you concerned mostly about the mRNA platform or vaccines in general?

02:01:01.167 --> 02:01:06.208
And I'm here to participate and support your efforts however I might.

02:01:06.228 --> 02:01:08.348
I put my contact information in there many times.

02:01:08.888 --> 02:01:11.369
Please feel free to have anybody on your team reach out to me.

02:01:13.306 --> 02:01:19.731
What very clearly are you concerned about and what is the goal that you hope to achieve?

02:01:20.491 --> 02:01:22.753
What is it exactly that you want to stop?

02:01:23.493 --> 02:01:24.154
All right, James.

02:01:24.534 --> 02:01:36.643
Listen, as everyone here knows, this whole war is being pushed

02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:39.230
by the DoD.

02:01:40.151 --> 02:01:44.514
And there are three complexes, right?

02:01:44.974 --> 02:02:00.283
The military-industrial complex, with the creation of weapons, where different nations are encouraged to kill each other, fight each other, and buy everything from the Americans.

02:02:02.984 --> 02:02:03.705
Then you have the

02:02:05.152 --> 02:02:25.108
a military financial complex, where they're going for the money, creating digital currencies so that they can create their own elitist world, and the rest of the world is at their mercy.

02:02:26.349 --> 02:02:27.570
And the third is the

02:02:29.192 --> 02:02:51.630
digital medicinal complex, I don't say pharmaceutical complex, medicinal complex, with which they are going to take control of the health, the minds, and the bodies of the world population.

02:02:53.271 --> 02:02:58.395
And they need all three legs to stomp on.

02:02:59.949 --> 02:03:08.074
If you can sever one leg, this monster will not be able to run anymore with the speed that it needs.

02:03:09.495 --> 02:03:24.104
So my goal is to try to cut the leg of this military medicinal complex.

02:03:25.171 --> 02:03:35.640
Now, the main instrument that they have are the gene-based vaccines, for reasons that we don't have to go into now.

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:44.146
But the reasons are very clear, very easy to understand, and very convincing.

02:03:45.828 --> 02:03:50.211
Because with these so-called vaccines, they can

02:03:51.722 --> 02:03:58.508
accomplish many things, they can kill many flies at the same time.

02:04:00.049 --> 02:04:17.583
They can control the world population, perform eugenics, sterilization, and at the same time, they can introduce

02:04:21.806 --> 02:04:25.268
particles into the body that will act as transmitters.

02:04:26.408 --> 02:04:28.289
I believe that they are on the way there.

02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:31.871
I don't think it's being done now, but it's going to be done.

02:04:33.992 --> 02:04:50.501
And they can choose whom they want to exterminate, because it's so easy to distribute these vials in a controlled fashion.

02:04:51.693 --> 02:04:56.035
so they can save themselves and get rid of the others.

02:04:56.476 --> 02:04:56.816
All right?

02:04:56.836 --> 02:04:58.076
This is terrible.

02:04:58.797 --> 02:05:09.823
And furthermore, because there's no control over these gene-based vaccines, especially the RNA, it's very, very versatile.

02:05:10.843 --> 02:05:14.285
And they can put into these vials whatever they want.

02:05:15.652 --> 02:05:20.113
And genetic engineering has come a long way now.

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:28.935
So I know that Bill Gates has been interested in life prolongation medicines, especially for himself.

02:05:30.776 --> 02:05:38.778
And I know that they are developing agents that theoretically may do this.

02:05:40.658 --> 02:05:42.859
So the vision they have is,

02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:55.495
For ourselves, we will have these agents that turn our lives into, you know, paradise for centuries, because we will not die anymore.

02:05:56.415 --> 02:05:58.016
Ridiculous.

02:05:59.496 --> 02:06:00.457
But they believe in this.

02:06:01.117 --> 02:06:03.718
Oh yes, no, I meant they're ridiculous, not you, of course.

02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:07.935
No, of course it won't work.

02:06:07.955 --> 02:06:10.197
Of course it won't work, but they believe it.

02:06:10.878 --> 02:06:11.839
Bill Gates thinks so.

02:06:13.261 --> 02:06:18.827
And therefore they have set everything on this horse.

02:06:20.749 --> 02:06:25.270
And the WHO declared this openly.

02:06:25.710 --> 02:06:29.071
They're going to put everything on an RNA basis.

02:06:30.091 --> 02:06:46.135
Furthermore, they're going to start treating the major simulatory diseases like coronary heart disease, diabetes, all right, with new agents that are all based on the RNA platform.

02:06:47.219 --> 02:06:54.348
Because there's no legislation anymore, you have no processes that they have to go through.

02:06:56.391 --> 02:06:59.374
Authorization, they are automatically authorized.

02:07:01.337 --> 02:07:02.979
And that's why I think

02:07:04.594 --> 02:07:11.120
that this is the Achilles heel that we should, that I myself, I'm going to aim at.

02:07:11.821 --> 02:07:15.264
Stop the RNA vaccines, all of them.

02:07:16.084 --> 02:07:19.708
And with that, we have severed that leg, the third leg there.

02:07:20.608 --> 02:07:20.909
Okay.

02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:25.032
Have I answered your question?

02:07:26.233 --> 02:07:26.794
Yes, you did.

02:07:26.914 --> 02:07:28.315
And, you know, count me in.

02:07:28.475 --> 02:07:28.816
I'm with you.

02:07:28.836 --> 02:07:28.956
I'll

02:07:29.595 --> 02:07:30.035
100 percent.

02:07:30.296 --> 02:07:35.339
And I don't know, Charles or Stephen, one of you said you had thoughts of the team.

02:07:35.719 --> 02:07:39.021
By all means, by all means, count me in.

02:07:40.842 --> 02:07:46.966
James Rutkowski is an expert on, a self-taught expert on the WHO.

02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:49.251
Yes, yes, I know.

02:07:49.752 --> 02:07:50.673
Oh, you know who it is?

02:07:50.753 --> 02:07:51.494
Okay, very good.

02:07:52.074 --> 02:07:52.455
All right.

02:07:52.495 --> 02:07:58.362
Like our last question to you, Sukrit, before Stephen Glenn says he's got a 30 second question.

02:07:58.602 --> 02:07:59.203
Go for it, Glenn.

02:08:00.124 --> 02:08:00.464
Thank you.

02:08:01.405 --> 02:08:07.613
Dr. Bakke, you described something coming along that you think will be a very positive protocol.

02:08:09.187 --> 02:08:25.251
Are you familiar with the Dr. Peter McCullers well-documented spike protein detox, and might that be a useful path for people to start with right now while they wait for whatever is coming along from the group you're working with?

02:08:25.811 --> 02:08:30.792
Well, I'm very hesitant about that because I'm not a great believer

02:08:31.512 --> 02:08:35.293
in the major role that the spike protein itself has.

02:08:36.133 --> 02:08:47.497
All right, I keep saying, guys, listen, quantities play a great role in biology.

02:08:48.057 --> 02:08:52.078
The spike protein itself is certainly a poison, okay?

02:08:52.698 --> 02:08:57.600
But I don't think there's enough of this poison to cause all the damage that we see.

02:08:58.160 --> 02:08:59.861
What one has to realize is that

02:09:02.563 --> 02:09:08.924
If an alien protein is produced by a cell, that cell will become the target of immune attack.

02:09:09.604 --> 02:09:13.465
So one spike protein by itself sitting on a cell will do nothing.

02:09:14.225 --> 02:09:22.006
But if that one spike protein is attacked by the immune system, then an explosion occurs, you see?

02:09:22.426 --> 02:09:31.728
So the damage done by the immune system magnifies thousands of folds the damage that one protein can do

02:09:32.532 --> 02:09:32.812
alone.

02:09:33.373 --> 02:09:46.724
And therefore, I cannot believe that the detoxification protocols can really work.

02:09:47.845 --> 02:09:53.230
I believe in certain things in those protocols, but not all.

02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:54.931
Thank you.

02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:56.930
Thank you.

02:09:57.291 --> 02:09:58.031
Thank you, Glenn.

02:09:58.531 --> 02:09:58.972
All right.

02:09:59.172 --> 02:10:00.793
Sukrit, we know you're tight.

02:10:00.853 --> 02:10:03.214
Stephen, over to you, Stephen, for the last.

02:10:03.234 --> 02:10:04.595
You've got to go, Sukrit, I know.

02:10:04.615 --> 02:10:04.655
OK.

02:10:06.537 --> 02:10:16.503
So I was going to ask you, Sukrit, one of the problems we seem to have amongst the good people on our side is that they don't understand causation.

02:10:17.184 --> 02:10:25.329
And I just wonder whether you could speak about that a little bit to throw light on why it's so difficult to prove causation.

02:10:26.890 --> 02:10:35.496
And also, the other thing I would like to ask you, so as a medical doctor, I think that it's very important that doctors don't just follow protocols.

02:10:35.536 --> 02:10:40.559
In fact, they shouldn't follow any protocols because that takes away their authenticity, if you like.

02:10:40.619 --> 02:10:46.143
It takes away the autonomous doctor who is serving his patient.

02:10:46.904 --> 02:10:56.330
So I think that these evidence-based medicine has led to protocols, and maybe that's why evidence-based medicine was highlighted.

02:10:56.950 --> 02:11:04.413
because it actually took the power away from autonomous doctors who had medical ethics working for their patients.

02:11:04.813 --> 02:11:06.353
And that was the intention, in my opinion.

02:11:06.573 --> 02:11:09.134
So I wonder whether you could speak about those two things.

02:11:09.474 --> 02:11:09.895
No, no.

02:11:10.735 --> 02:11:13.576
Just causation, please, because there was, you know, time.

02:11:13.636 --> 02:11:13.856
All right.

02:11:15.003 --> 02:11:22.005
Listen, causation can be shown if you know where to look for it.

02:11:23.846 --> 02:11:41.791
And as I think we discussed this together three years ago, the way to prove causation was the pathology, to look at the tissues like Virchow did, to find out whether there was something typical.

02:11:46.073 --> 02:11:53.019
pathognomonic, meaning absolutely singular and particular for the vaccination.

02:11:53.820 --> 02:12:04.268
And, and, and four years ago, I said, I feared that we will be seeing lots of clots.

02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.709
Absolutely.

02:12:05.730 --> 02:12:06.230
I remember that.

02:12:06.250 --> 02:12:06.330
Yeah.

02:12:07.731 --> 02:12:08.933
That was four years ago.

02:12:08.953 --> 02:12:10.394
And you're dead right.

02:12:11.476 --> 02:12:11.736
Yes.

02:12:11.836 --> 02:12:17.283
But, you know, Stephen, I've never been wrong in anything very important in life.

02:12:17.623 --> 02:12:18.644
No.

02:12:18.945 --> 02:12:25.993
Because what I said and what I'm saying can be read in the textbooks of medicine.

02:12:26.934 --> 02:12:27.335
Absolutely.

02:12:28.639 --> 02:12:29.380
It's all known.

02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:30.660
It's not my discovery.

02:12:31.761 --> 02:12:39.585
I was just saying that if the textbooks are right, then there will be clots forming in all vessels from head to toe.

02:12:39.625 --> 02:12:42.146
You won't know where they are, but they're going to be there.

02:12:42.787 --> 02:12:44.968
And this is what pathologists have found.

02:12:45.728 --> 02:12:54.033
And I also said that there will be quasi autoimmune attack on tissues

02:12:55.083 --> 02:13:02.205
Because as I said just 10 minutes ago, any cell that dares to produce an alien protein is going to come under immune attack.

02:13:02.825 --> 02:13:09.266
And that has also been shown to occur in people who had died after vaccination.

02:13:09.586 --> 02:13:18.849
They see the inflammation, the autoimmune attack in various tissues, from brain, heart, lung, to anything you want.

02:13:18.869 --> 02:13:19.709
Okay?

02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:24.631
That is so typical, and it does not occur in any other disease.

02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:26.812
So it is caused by the vaccine.

02:13:27.452 --> 02:13:40.638
Now, moreover, you can now find the vaccine by immunohistochemical staining, and the spike protein has been found, okay, all over the bodies of these guys.

02:13:41.198 --> 02:13:44.780
So it's proven that causality is there.

02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:47.041
And now I come to one last thing.

02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:49.102
You know that the U.S.

02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:55.951
National Academy of Sciences, which is sort of like the Royal Society in England.

02:13:57.352 --> 02:14:00.412
It published this paper in April 2024.

02:14:01.152 --> 02:14:12.555
It had set up a commission, a committee, to find out whether they could show causality between

02:14:14.105 --> 02:14:20.808
any of these diseases that people got after vaccination and the vaccination itself?

02:14:21.548 --> 02:14:39.797
And you probably know that the answer was, we have regrettably not been able to firmly or absolutely establish causation in any of these 500 conditions with one exception, right?

02:14:41.497 --> 02:14:42.658
You know what the exception was?

02:14:44.284 --> 02:14:48.870
No, you don't, but it's written, you can, this is published.

02:14:50.331 --> 02:14:52.174
Rheumatic myocarditis.

02:14:52.788 --> 02:14:53.468
Oh, yes, of course.

02:14:53.488 --> 02:14:53.669
Yeah.

02:14:54.549 --> 02:14:56.430
Yeah, but but this is very important.

02:14:57.351 --> 02:15:13.220
And they stated, further research into this area will not lead to any other conclusion, meaning that if anyone who was previously healthy, got vaccinated, and then subsequently got a myocarditis,

02:15:14.261 --> 02:15:16.362
causality is proven.

02:15:17.043 --> 02:15:18.043
You don't have to do anything.

02:15:18.403 --> 02:15:19.244
You can go to court.

02:15:19.764 --> 02:15:26.828
But a lot of people don't understand the importance of what that, you know, what it means when they're admitting myocarditis occurs.

02:15:27.908 --> 02:15:32.351
So the essential thing, I don't care.

02:15:32.371 --> 02:15:40.095
I just wanted to make the point that, you know, that you could have a subclinical myocarditis attack,

02:15:40.535 --> 02:15:44.456
which could shorten your life by 10 to 20 years and no one would ever know.

02:15:45.017 --> 02:15:52.439
But Stephen, okay, look, this I have also written in my autobiography, in the extended version.

02:15:52.519 --> 02:15:53.679
It's all there, okay?

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.040
Anyone can read it.

02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:02.782
It's appearing in 40 languages, so don't say that there was no way to know.

02:16:02.903 --> 02:16:05.763
There is a simple way to know, just read it, okay?

02:16:05.884 --> 02:16:10.065
It's a very short book, but it contains all the essential information.

02:16:10.393 --> 02:16:27.509
So another thing that you brilliantly pointed out in early 2021 when we were doing the letters to the European Medicines Agency, you said, you postulated, you hypothesized that the biggest problem would occur in vessels of slow blood flow.

02:16:27.529 --> 02:16:36.176
And then you went on to say in the brain that the worst place in your opinion was the cerebral venous sinus.

02:16:38.078 --> 02:16:41.582
And so the risk was you could get venous sinus, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

02:16:42.082 --> 02:16:43.183
Not the worst case.

02:16:43.363 --> 02:16:44.184
It wasn't the worst.

02:16:44.485 --> 02:16:45.826
It would also take place there.

02:16:46.366 --> 02:16:51.091
In fact, all small vessels and veins of the brain, all.

02:16:51.752 --> 02:16:54.334
And that's what has been found now.

02:16:55.215 --> 02:17:03.499
But then, if you remember the third letter so quick, you then brilliantly used your, no, but you're so modest.

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:10.403
You said you've got this slow blood flow in the cerebral sinus thrombosis.

02:17:10.423 --> 02:17:16.206
You thought that was a possibility that there would be a huge rise in the incidence of that.

02:17:17.466 --> 02:17:20.468
And then you said anyone with headache, for example,

02:17:20.848 --> 02:17:23.575
needs to be investigated with that in mind.

02:17:24.016 --> 02:17:25.159
Very important point.

02:17:27.179 --> 02:17:27.479
Yes.

02:17:28.019 --> 02:17:33.241
All right, Sukrit, we're letting you go and we're going to end this meeting.

02:17:33.261 --> 02:17:37.663
But the point about that, the point about that, Sukrit, so viewers may not understand.

02:17:37.703 --> 02:17:47.787
So the point is that the, you know, VAERS, for example, it could be reported that someone's got headache, you know, or millions have got headache, you know, but it was a minor thing.

02:17:48.067 --> 02:17:55.750
But actually it could be, it could be a diagnosis of a subclinical or relatively subclinical CVST.

02:17:57.915 --> 02:17:59.316
All right, because I'm going to leave.

02:17:59.336 --> 02:18:03.117
But let me give you one last piece of information, OK?

02:18:04.418 --> 02:18:21.966
Austrian doctors, a little team, have found out that there's one very simple method to find out whether the capillaries in the body are, yeah,

02:18:23.726 --> 02:18:27.929
a non abnormal, because compromised, compromised.

02:18:28.690 --> 02:18:35.074
And this is the what is called nail bed, finger bed, capillary microscopy.

02:18:36.855 --> 02:18:37.056
Yeah.

02:18:37.656 --> 02:18:42.880
So there's an instrument where you can just see the capillaries of the nail bed.

02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:49.705
And the first patients that have been looked at are extremely promising because they found

02:18:54.088 --> 02:18:59.310
disturbances that could then be treated, okay?

02:19:01.051 --> 02:19:13.115
And so, Stephen, I want to give this to you, as a doctor, so that you spread the information that this, I don't know, nail bed capillarscopy, I think it's called, yeah,

02:19:13.715 --> 02:19:26.516
It could be a simple method for any doctor in the world to use to diagnose vaccine-mediated vascular injury.

02:19:28.115 --> 02:19:31.416
non-invasive, it's cheap, and it's simple.

02:19:31.917 --> 02:19:36.918
I can't do it, but the textbooks tell you how to do it.

02:19:38.679 --> 02:19:39.759
I probably can't do it either.

02:19:39.859 --> 02:19:43.740
I could probably find someone who could.

02:19:44.141 --> 02:19:45.121
Someone put it in the chat.

02:19:45.341 --> 02:19:46.281
It's so great.

02:19:46.301 --> 02:19:47.522
It's a nail bed.

02:19:48.082 --> 02:19:48.342
What?

02:19:50.463 --> 02:19:52.003
Yeah, something like that.

02:19:52.663 --> 02:19:52.923
Right.

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:57.422
You can research it.

02:19:57.622 --> 02:19:59.463
You can research it today, Charles.

02:19:59.583 --> 02:20:01.344
You're beginning your day in Australia.

02:20:02.745 --> 02:20:03.686
I'm not going to research it.

02:20:03.706 --> 02:20:05.567
Someone will put it into the chat.

02:20:06.588 --> 02:20:08.049
I was joking, Charles.

02:20:08.889 --> 02:20:11.751
I think it's a capillaroscopy.

02:20:12.432 --> 02:20:14.273
Siobhan has put it in.

02:20:14.333 --> 02:20:19.056
Nail bed capillaroscopy test to diagnose vaccine-mediated vascular injury.

02:20:19.076 --> 02:20:19.836
Thank you, Siobhan.

02:20:19.876 --> 02:20:20.397
Well noted.

02:20:23.674 --> 02:20:24.034
Very good.

02:20:24.235 --> 02:20:24.975
Thank you, Sukrit.

02:20:25.035 --> 02:20:27.378
Okay, we've got a whole two and a half hours.

02:20:27.458 --> 02:20:30.041
Sukrit, you've done brilliantly.

02:20:30.061 --> 02:20:32.023
Go and do some meditation now.

02:20:32.483 --> 02:20:39.451
And we pointed out there's a comment in the chat about the placebo effect.

02:20:39.491 --> 02:20:41.953
Of course, there's a placebo effect where

02:20:44.156 --> 02:20:50.484
not only 99.999% empty space, we're entirely empty space, so that your thoughts create it.

02:20:50.804 --> 02:20:52.967
Sukriti, you were talking about the mind-body-spirit.

02:20:53.007 --> 02:20:54.489
That's exactly what it's about.

02:20:54.509 --> 02:20:56.251
Take off one of the legs and they're stuffed.

02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:59.074
So, James, thank you for your contribution.

02:20:59.114 --> 02:21:00.656
Thank you to everyone for your contribution.

02:21:00.676 --> 02:21:01.597
Thank you for the wonderful

02:21:02.418 --> 02:21:15.606
contributions to the chat, and we've got lots of work to do everybody, so time to come to these meetings so that you realize we've got another three years of hard work ahead of us, so no getting tired and look after your health.

02:21:15.646 --> 02:21:16.727
Sukrit, thank you so much.

02:21:16.747 --> 02:21:18.048
Big round of applause, everybody.

02:21:18.068 --> 02:21:20.369
Oh yes, very good.

02:21:20.489 --> 02:21:20.730
Thank you.

02:21:20.770 --> 02:21:23.371
Thank you all.

02:21:23.551 --> 02:21:24.192
Thank you all.

02:21:25.032 --> 02:21:26.954
Still drawing applause, Sukrit.

02:21:27.094 --> 02:21:28.074
I know you're modest, but

02:21:31.847 --> 02:21:32.308
OK.

02:21:32.808 --> 02:21:33.169
Thank you.

02:21:33.789 --> 02:21:34.390
Thanks, everybody.

02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:35.150
Thanks, Stephen.

02:21:36.091 --> 02:21:36.472
Bye-bye.

02:21:36.772 --> 02:21:37.313
Bye, everybody.

02:21:37.333 --> 02:21:38.013
Thank you, Charles.

02:21:39.294 --> 02:21:39.695
Well done.

02:21:41.356 --> 02:21:42.017
Thanks, everybody.

02:21:47.963 --> 02:21:49.424
So what do people think?

02:21:49.464 --> 02:21:54.509
Do you think we should have multiple guests, conversations?

02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:57.121
Just one guest at a time.

02:21:57.161 --> 02:21:58.202
That's a big conversation.

02:21:58.242 --> 02:21:59.584
We'll hold it.

02:21:59.604 --> 02:22:04.048
But there's Tom Rodman's got to have a conversation in the video telegram meeting, Stephen, with Tom Rodman.

02:22:04.068 --> 02:22:04.708
That's a good idea.

02:22:05.669 --> 02:22:06.069
Sure, yeah.
