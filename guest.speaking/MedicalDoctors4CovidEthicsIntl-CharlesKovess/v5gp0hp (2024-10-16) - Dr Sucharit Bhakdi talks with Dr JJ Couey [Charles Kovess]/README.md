_Note: A diarized version of this transcript is also in this folder (\*.diarize.vtt). Diaraization just means that the speakers are identified. Some speakers (e.g. SPEAKER_01) may be replaced by actual names, but not all. Humans may submit or request corrections overtime and they may eventually get updated._

_Note 2: I've loaded the video and the diarized videos up in a jsfiddle project with an embedded player here: https://jsfiddle.net/d2rbhqng/ . This should help with proof-reading. (In case the video stops working, you should be able to get the updated video URL using yt-dlp. `yt-dlp -g https://rumble.com/v5iy5t9-dr-sucharit-bhakdi-talks-with-dr-jj-couey.html`)_
