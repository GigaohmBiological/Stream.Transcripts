00:03.277 --> 00:06.079
Hello everyone, Rob Cunningham with The Cool Show.

00:06.099 --> 00:12.663
Happy, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever, whatever time it happens to be where you are.

00:12.683 --> 00:21.709
I am overwhelmed with enthusiasm and pregnant anticipation of this interview with my new friend Jay Cooey.

00:22.569 --> 00:30.835
Jay is a neurobiologist with an unbelievable background in science, in

00:31.548 --> 00:37.049
the last four years of the pandemic that we've all had to experience and endure and process.

00:38.449 --> 00:44.551
I can't wait to get into this conversation, but before I start, Jay, welcome to the Kuhl family.

00:44.791 --> 00:52.212
And please, if you don't mind, introduce yourself and give everybody the executive summary of your life and background.

00:53.112 --> 00:55.793
Thank you very much, Mr. Cunningham, for having me on your show.

00:56.793 --> 00:59.854
My background, wow, it's a weird story.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.701
I'm a Wisconsin boy.

01:02.721 --> 01:10.024
I grew up in Northern Wisconsin, went to high school in Northern Wisconsin, and then did my university in Chicago.

01:11.264 --> 01:15.887
After university, my intention was to go to med school, but I was on waiting lists.

01:16.027 --> 01:20.909
And so while I was on waiting lists, I was a high school teacher in Chicago.

01:20.929 --> 01:23.530
I really enjoy teaching.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.031
I enjoyed it a lot, but as a 22-year-old,

01:28.477 --> 01:30.038
essentially young adult kid.

01:30.919 --> 01:37.783
Um, I was also bartending and I was teaching high school and interacting with the other teachers didn't work out as much.

01:38.503 --> 01:40.404
Um, I was a very successful bartender.

01:40.464 --> 01:42.265
I started to get three nights a week.

01:42.465 --> 01:45.227
I made more money as a bartender than as a high school teacher.

01:46.128 --> 01:49.650
Um, and so I was a bartender for a couple of years and, uh, that's what I did.

01:50.290 --> 01:54.353
And then, um, I dunno, I, I think it's a funny story, so I'll tell the whole thing.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.654
Um, I, uh,

01:57.662 --> 02:02.785
decided to take Christmas Eve off and I couldn't find a substitute.

02:03.005 --> 02:12.450
And so I let my, I gave the keys to the bar, to my bar back, kind of naively not realizing that Christmas Eve was a very busy night.

02:13.777 --> 02:24.486
And so when I got to my parents' house in Wisconsin from Chicago driving there at night, there was a message on my answering machine in Chicago from the owner of the bar saying, you're fired.

02:25.287 --> 02:29.009
And I just didn't understand at the time as a young adult,

02:29.730 --> 02:35.233
that I had the keys to somebody's business and that I actually had a really awesome job.

02:35.333 --> 02:40.096
I was just kind of not aware of the responsibilities that I had.

02:40.116 --> 02:46.120
I was just kind of coasting through life thinking, you know, next year I'm going to get into med school, so this is just me on vacation.

02:47.140 --> 02:50.762
And it was a pretty rude awakening because I didn't get into med school that year.

02:50.942 --> 02:53.764
And I had to do the waiting list again or do something again.

02:54.624 --> 02:56.965
And I had stopped teaching high school.

02:57.025 --> 03:00.347
And so then that was also like, OK, you're going to go back to that now.

03:01.188 --> 03:03.069
And so I found myself wandering.

03:03.129 --> 03:07.911
And I went into the classified ads of the Chicago Tribune, believe it or not.

03:08.411 --> 03:12.534
And I found this research technician job at the University of Chicago, and I started

03:13.214 --> 03:30.028
biking from the north side to the south side every day along the lake, going to this lab at the University of Chicago and doing cell culture and other stuff, just trying to, I don't know, decide if I wanted to go to grad school or if maybe this job would help my resume so I could get into med school next year.

03:30.068 --> 03:31.670
Maybe I could get a recommendation.

03:32.170 --> 03:37.034
I was still trying to find a way to keep the bike moving and, you know, just that was what I was going to do.

03:37.775 --> 03:40.777
But it was also in my own head kind of a dishonest

03:41.815 --> 03:44.377
sort of killing time as a young adult.

03:44.937 --> 03:47.619
I felt very lost after 9-11 happened.

03:48.660 --> 03:53.142
That happened while I was at the University of Chicago and I had a boss who was Tunisian.

03:53.663 --> 04:04.230
So on that morning when I showed up, the second plane hit while I was on, it was the winter, you know, like September, so I had stopped biking or I had taken the train and

04:05.010 --> 04:12.396
And when I got off the train on the south side on the 55th street stop and got on the bus, the person that sat next to me said, hey, did you see there was another plane?

04:12.416 --> 04:13.157
And I was like, what?

04:13.717 --> 04:16.919
So from the time that I had rode the train till then, another plane hit.

04:16.959 --> 04:21.963
I got into the lab and Collin, my boss had already shaved his beard and said, you got to go home.

04:22.464 --> 04:23.204
I'm going to go home.

04:23.244 --> 04:24.025
We're all going to go home.

04:24.085 --> 04:27.187
They're probably going to come and round me up and I'm going to have to, I'm going to be gone.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.488
So the lab is going to close.

04:28.528 --> 04:28.969
I want you to,

04:29.557 --> 04:30.658
Wrap up your experiments.

04:30.678 --> 04:31.499
You don't need to come in.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.240
You need to go home.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.802
This is something very bad.

04:35.003 --> 04:38.046
It's American history, and you definitely don't need to work for me today.

04:38.126 --> 04:39.448
So I got back on the bus.

04:39.508 --> 04:40.489
I rode the train home.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.974
All my roommates are in the living room, and we watched the TV all day.

04:45.615 --> 04:48.017
Well, that day changed a lot of our lives.

04:48.097 --> 04:48.998
It changed my life.

04:49.699 --> 04:51.080
For the next couple of weeks, I was

04:52.210 --> 05:14.227
Riding the the the L and in Chicago on purpose and I would at the University of Chicago I'd print out these pieces of paper that said oil period war question mark and I would put them on seats of the L and I walked the whole line of the The train while I did it because I was just like I don't know what's going on here But we're not gonna go to Iraq for these building.

05:14.247 --> 05:20.231
I you know, I thought I knew what I was doing I had to say something and at some point in time

05:22.591 --> 05:33.703
I don't know, I just, I realized that the American government was exactly what Ted Gunderson had told me and exactly what Mike Rupert had told me and I didn't.

05:36.656 --> 05:50.370
They were telling me stories and it was about the history and what happened before, but what was happening now was still, and I think that's what a lot of people have the problem with is a lot of what's happening now, I just assumed wasn't like previous history.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.912
They're not doing that anymore.

05:52.412 --> 05:56.357
That might've been what they did to Kennedy, but that's not still going on.

05:56.957 --> 06:08.268
And so you can be very, very much safe in terms of thinking about history as bad guys, but not now as current history as having bad guys.

06:08.709 --> 06:18.058
And that's the kind of illusion that even after 9-11 still didn't quite break because the EU hadn't been formed yet.

06:18.098 --> 06:20.320
So when I went over to the Netherlands at that time,

06:21.101 --> 06:23.061
So that's another part of the story, I should say.

06:23.461 --> 06:26.502
At the University of Chicago, at the same time, there was a Dutch guy working there.

06:27.442 --> 06:33.563
I think it was in 2001, at the end of the year or early 2002, he moved back to the Netherlands.

06:33.623 --> 06:39.484
And we had been friends such that he said, if you want to do a PhD, maybe you should come to the Netherlands.

06:39.544 --> 06:41.965
And in the Netherlands, they pay people to do a PhD.

06:42.005 --> 06:43.765
It's like a paid position.

06:43.825 --> 06:46.586
And so if you wanted to, you could do that.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.666
And I said, well, don't tease me.

06:47.946 --> 06:48.886
I'd love to do that.

06:49.491 --> 06:52.761
And so actually, he left in August, and then in October I went to...

06:56.845 --> 06:59.907
Amsterdam where he worked and I interviewed and then in November I left.

07:00.928 --> 07:03.690
So in November of 2002, I left to the Netherlands.

07:05.111 --> 07:06.692
I did my PhD in Amsterdam.

07:06.752 --> 07:07.733
I met my wife there.

07:07.753 --> 07:10.715
Then we moved to Norway for my first postdoc.

07:10.755 --> 07:12.155
We lived in Norway for four years.

07:12.696 --> 07:13.977
We had our two sons there.

07:14.417 --> 07:18.340
We moved back to the Netherlands intending to raise our kids in Holland where her family is.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.540
She has a huge family there.

07:20.481 --> 07:25.745
I have a family in America too, but they're a lot more spread out and they're a lot less, they're a lot less

07:27.426 --> 07:29.247
convivial with each other, if you will.

07:29.287 --> 07:34.289
It's not so... In the Netherlands, they get together all the time and it's really important for birthdays and stuff.

07:34.329 --> 07:37.431
And so, my wife misses her family more than I ever did.

07:37.671 --> 07:38.412
Let's say it that way.

07:39.032 --> 07:40.353
Anyway, we wanted to live there.

07:40.413 --> 07:41.514
We were there for four years.

07:41.574 --> 07:42.474
I didn't get tenure.

07:42.534 --> 07:45.536
And as American, it was actually a lot harder than I thought to get tenure.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.671
And so we were kind of left with, you know, what do we do?

07:49.131 --> 07:52.373
And we came back to America in 2016 to Pittsburgh.

07:53.474 --> 07:58.817
As a Wisconsin kid, the only thing I had in my head was the Steelers and I hated this place.

07:59.658 --> 08:01.099
But actually it's beautiful here.

08:01.159 --> 08:03.700
The hills are beautiful and steep and full of trees.

08:05.141 --> 08:10.385
And the bridges are nice and the rivers are here and there's plenty of water and there's deer and turkey.

08:11.244 --> 08:14.187
And everybody's got a real down-home-work attitude.

08:15.268 --> 08:26.438
I feel like it's a really, really wonderful American city that we were blessed to stumble into because of course we could have gone... there's lots of other places we could have ended up and we ended up here.

08:29.997 --> 08:37.058
Yeah, so then we're here, we're working for the, I'm just trying to get on the tenure track at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

08:37.298 --> 08:47.901
I've got a pretty good resume because the people that I worked with in Norway, the year after I left and went to the Netherlands, they got the Nobel Prize in medicine.

08:48.621 --> 08:52.401
So that's on my resume and I can email those people and that's kind of cool.

08:52.421 --> 08:56.682
Let me pause you there for a second.

08:57.022 --> 08:57.242
Sure.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.883
Can you see what's on the screen there?

08:59.223 --> 08:59.683
Yeah, I can.

09:01.084 --> 09:02.744
Folks, I want you to understand this story.

09:02.804 --> 09:04.525
Let's put this in context real quick.

09:04.565 --> 09:17.968
From biking bartender, you know, to fired bartender, to meeting somebody and going over to the Netherlands and Norway, to getting his PhD, coming back to the United States in 2016.

09:18.008 --> 09:18.408
Look at this.

09:18.428 --> 09:19.048
2,855 citations.

09:25.868 --> 09:27.349
for research.

09:27.730 --> 09:41.923
Look at the topics that Jay, from the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Jay, to be respectful, look at all of these publications of official articles and research publications and citations in the industry.

09:42.303 --> 09:49.410
So we're speaking of a man that has ultimately and humbly not even, you know,

09:50.330 --> 09:59.941
talked about the vastness of his research, his expertise, and his industry recognition in the fields of neurobiology.

10:00.382 --> 10:09.593
So given that, I just wanted to paint a little bit of a picture and turn it back to you, Jay, that we're speaking of a man that has found

10:10.567 --> 10:14.788
remarkable expertise at the zenith of his career.

10:15.468 --> 10:26.952
And you can look from 2017 to 18 to 19 to 20, the first four years here before boom, now COVID comes into play, 20 and 21, his research even goes up.

10:27.512 --> 10:27.672
But

10:28.453 --> 10:30.935
This is a man of great accomplishment.

10:30.995 --> 10:32.776
I just want to brag on you a little bit, Jay.

10:32.816 --> 10:35.057
So please, the microphone is yours.

10:35.457 --> 10:41.641
It's very nice, but anybody who is still playing that game would see that I was definitely a benchwarmer.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.982
But it's very nice of you to say.

10:44.002 --> 10:46.664
I don't want to self-deprecate in any way.

10:46.884 --> 10:49.206
I did a lot of good work that I'm very proud of.

10:51.338 --> 10:55.881
And I think I would have made an excellent supervisor and I would have done very well in that system.

10:56.381 --> 11:00.524
But what that system represents to me now is very different than what I thought it was.

11:01.144 --> 11:05.807
And I had a good gut feeling that there was a lot of waste.

11:05.987 --> 11:13.932
I had a gut feeling that a lot of questions that were being asked had probably could have been answered better or probably didn't need to be asked anymore.

11:14.432 --> 11:23.159
But I kind of just assumed that that was a function of the system where you just throw so much money at something that you're obviously going to waste some.

11:23.720 --> 11:30.646
I never saw it as like a purposeful part of how our

11:31.758 --> 11:40.722
collective identity could be slowly diluted over time if we just asked enough irrelevant questions and we ran down enough wrong pathways.

11:41.222 --> 11:45.104
Eventually, there would be so much confusion and bad information that

11:46.155 --> 11:52.259
the end result would be that we didn't know ourselves as well as we had confused ourselves into believing we do.

11:52.840 --> 12:08.650
And so even though I was able to articulate this in small contexts, like before I left academia, I could already say, and I used to drive people nuts, sometimes I would say it, you know, like at a,

12:09.631 --> 12:16.494
at a party or drinking, you know, at somebody's celebration where everybody's just, you know, kind of talking and somebody would bring up cancer.

12:16.534 --> 12:22.877
I would always say, man, oh, man, I just I can't believe how ridiculous that whole concept is.

12:22.937 --> 12:23.717
And they would be like, what?

12:24.218 --> 12:26.659
And I'd say, well, the whole kind of what is cancer?

12:26.699 --> 12:29.160
Just tell me what, you know, ask one of these academic people.

12:29.200 --> 12:34.442
A cancer is when cell division is is becomes dysregulated and then you have this huge problem.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.023
And I said, OK, so that's interesting because

12:38.684 --> 12:44.187
the, we spend billions of dollars trying to find genetic explanations for it.

12:44.227 --> 12:52.932
We spend almost no money trying to find toxic explanations for it or nutritional explanations for it, or environmental explanations for it.

12:52.952 --> 12:55.914
We spend all of our money on genetic explanations for it.

12:56.314 --> 13:05.899
Yet how many of those, how many actual of the total number of real biologically plausible explanations do you think are genetic?

13:05.939 --> 13:06.620
And they're kind of like.

13:09.091 --> 13:09.872
I don't know what you mean.

13:09.912 --> 13:13.616
I said, well, if we could solve all the genetic cancers, how much cancer would go away?

13:14.953 --> 13:19.575
And for the first time they start to realize that, wait, he's right.

13:19.715 --> 13:23.797
Like most of the cancer in my imagination is not genetic.

13:23.857 --> 13:25.918
Most of the cancer is because you got unlucky.

13:25.978 --> 13:34.283
Most of the cancer is because you were constantly exposed to any hundreds of lists of things that you should not have been exposed to.

13:34.323 --> 13:37.264
It should never have been in a product, should have never been in your food.

13:37.664 --> 13:43.067
And yet these people don't even consider the possibility that sitting in traffic for 50 years might give you cancer.

13:44.246 --> 13:52.812
This whole thing drives me bananas because again, we're not talking about a few people investigating a few sick kids for the sake of those sick kids.

13:52.832 --> 13:58.776
We're talking about throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at

13:59.522 --> 14:11.269
questions that really aren't going to answer the biggest portion of the question that they presume to be answering, or the problem, rather, that they presume to be addressing.

14:11.769 --> 14:28.880
And so even though I could pretty succinctly drive people bananas with this little argument in cancer, it never dawned on me that that same sort of high bar of validation

14:29.747 --> 14:32.390
should be applied to all biomedical sciences.

14:32.430 --> 14:38.817
And if it was applied just in the same snarky way, I would actually find that I could apply this anywhere.

14:38.837 --> 14:46.965
And it was only, it was COVID and getting kicked out that made me start to realize that, oh my gosh, like that's really where we are.

14:47.706 --> 14:54.931
And now they have used this in a military fashion to convince my children that something happened that didn't happen.

14:54.951 --> 15:08.781
And so then I was just trying to process what parts can I understand, and what parts can I give a good, succinct explanation for what I do understand, and then what parts of their narrative

15:10.362 --> 15:11.483
Can I not explain?

15:11.503 --> 15:12.284
Can I not address?

15:12.344 --> 15:13.545
And do I need to stay away from?

15:13.566 --> 15:27.420
Because oftentimes those are the things that they want you to argue about so that they can discredit you in this irrelevant argument rather than have to address you in the very relevant subjects.

15:28.941 --> 15:31.304
That's where I'm finding myself now.

15:31.821 --> 15:38.583
Man, brother, thank you for that, because it so perfectly dovetails the title of this interview.

15:39.903 --> 15:40.903
And I stole this from you.

15:41.404 --> 15:43.964
Our consciousness is prime real estate.

15:44.404 --> 15:48.766
OK, that is the real estate everyone wants to occupy.

15:49.526 --> 15:53.887
Yet only one should occupy it with sovereign authority.

15:54.622 --> 16:06.069
But the world wants to identify you, identify me, take control over me, take control over you, identify me and you, and then set the rules of the game for me and you.

16:06.649 --> 16:11.932
And I was speaking to our great friend yesterday, Michelle Stiles, who's going to be at the Red Pill Expo as well.

16:12.552 --> 16:22.538
And, you know, in essence, what they have done or what this world has done to us is define the football field as between the two 40-yard lines.

16:23.467 --> 16:29.650
And in between the 40 yard lines, we can argue, we can debate, we can have elections, we can do research.

16:29.950 --> 16:32.731
They'll throw all the money in the world between the 40s.

16:33.291 --> 16:39.834
But don't you dare go outside the 40 or go dance in the end zone or walk up in the stands or go out in the parking lot.

16:40.135 --> 16:47.438
You're not allowed to leave the confines of the field as we define the argument or the battlefield to be.

16:48.158 --> 16:54.700
If you walk down to the 10-yard line and start talking, that's when people look at us like we have nine horns coming out of our head.

16:55.261 --> 16:57.501
Because what are you doing down there?

16:57.961 --> 16:59.242
The argument's over here.

16:59.262 --> 17:02.443
Well, what if the argument isn't over here?

17:02.943 --> 17:08.485
What if that is intentionally an exercise in futility?

17:08.965 --> 17:09.525
Absolutely.

17:09.545 --> 17:14.707
And people don't want us to know the real cause or the real answer.

17:15.007 --> 17:16.668
They just want to exhaust us.

17:17.329 --> 17:31.238
There's two very distinct aspects of this malevolent governing strategy that have really become very razor sharp and focused for me over even the last couple of months.

17:31.399 --> 17:39.164
And that is the fact, I give you a couple of different angles on it so that you and I can really express it to your viewers.

17:39.764 --> 17:46.549
The first angle would be that when we were growing up, when you watched the news, there was one person.

17:47.554 --> 17:49.415
And that one person had something to tell you.

17:49.815 --> 17:56.300
But it doesn't matter who it was, it was one person and they had one thing to say to you.

17:56.880 --> 18:08.368
Now, one of the most diabolical ways that lies manifest and are empowered is when more than one person agrees to lie to another.

18:09.428 --> 18:15.312
There's nothing worse than if you and your wife lie together to a third person.

18:15.352 --> 18:20.595
It's very, very hard for that person, especially if they trust one or both of you.

18:21.175 --> 18:23.617
Imagine two brothers lying to their sister.

18:24.077 --> 18:27.339
These kinds of combinations are very wicked.

18:27.919 --> 18:33.863
And what I find disturbing about the current state of social media and also on television

18:34.503 --> 18:41.466
is that you have a table full of people, like the view, where four people, wittingly or unwittingly, are lying to their viewers.

18:41.906 --> 18:55.851
And that is a much more malevolent form of lying than even one person looking you in the eye and lying, because at least then the stream of consciousness doesn't involve a fake agreement between two people.

18:56.391 --> 19:05.636
And that's what I find most terrifying is that I'm convinced that on Twitter, anonymous accounts are used the same way.

19:05.696 --> 19:10.579
If you were on Twitter and you said that, I really like white bread better than brown bread.

19:10.619 --> 19:16.622
And then you had 10 anonymous accounts come under there and go, wow, Rob Cunningham is really the smartest guy ever.

19:16.682 --> 19:18.783
I like his bread ideas and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

19:19.163 --> 19:23.626
And then I, as a follower, look at your tweet and read that thread, it is,

19:24.366 --> 19:26.788
infinitely more powerful than the tweet itself.

19:27.389 --> 19:42.523
And so there are lots of ways on social media where the illusion of a group of people, the illusion of a consensus can be instantly created by just two people on Zoom going, oh yeah, I agree, that question is very important and your answer is very relevant.

19:43.243 --> 19:58.148
And this magic trick, when applied to, let's say, foreign affairs or what they want you to believe about some candidate's history, in our childhood seemed innocuous.

19:59.068 --> 20:11.995
But with the power of social media, where everybody has agreed to scroll on this device as a window to the world, this has been militarized against us.

20:12.135 --> 20:16.838
And they can make us believe anything, including that toilet paper is going to run out, so you better go buy some.

20:17.538 --> 20:23.626
And it will manifest in ways that we cannot possibly underestimate.

20:23.686 --> 20:35.880
Like the best way for us to think about this has been said by many, many people before me, but the best way for us to think about this would be for us to realize that there is no useful way for us to turn over

20:36.921 --> 20:40.305
our consciousness to these people's programs.

20:40.345 --> 20:43.368
You don't have to think about them as artificial intelligence.

20:43.388 --> 20:45.070
You can think about them as programs.

20:45.210 --> 20:52.838
People are intentionally programming social media to put their message in front of you.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.279
There is no virality.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.662
Nobody with a really good idea cannot be stopped.

20:58.443 --> 21:05.164
Um, in fact, the only good ideas, quote unquote, that go viral on the internet are the ones that they want you to see.

21:05.565 --> 21:12.086
And once you accept that, that even the anonymous accounts are going to tell you that that's a great question, or that guy's really smart.

21:12.506 --> 21:21.848
And even the people that are, you know, like, I would say that it's not ridiculous to assume that most interviews

21:22.668 --> 21:30.395
that are done on YouTube, that don't get erased, have a script, have an agreed-upon list of questions.

21:31.056 --> 21:42.867
And if I decided right now to start talking about the history of World War II and the fact that I think they didn't only kill people, they tested on them first, you wouldn't have known that we were going to do that because we don't have a script.

21:43.647 --> 21:59.731
But these people, because they are working for the actual system that is trying to govern us, these weaponized piles of money that control social media, they want you to believe that the only thing you have to fear is that the government might censor social media.

21:59.771 --> 22:09.814
What you really have to fear is that these private interests would put liars on social media and agree to lie to you about everything they want to lie to you about.

22:10.274 --> 22:12.816
and then blame it on the government censoring things.

22:12.976 --> 22:14.497
That's not what you have to fear.

22:14.958 --> 22:22.443
You have to fear coordinated lying on social media where it's totally allowed.

22:22.463 --> 22:32.150
You can make a YouTube channel where you have your family and friends and everybody from your community pretending to be random people.

22:32.190 --> 22:35.653
And then you could do a sweepstakes and give all those people the money you raise

22:36.093 --> 22:48.337
and pretend that they're random subscribers to YouTube and literally lie about it for years until your whole town is worth millions of dollars and there's nothing to stop anyone.

22:48.377 --> 22:49.297
You can lie.

22:49.777 --> 22:52.218
You can set up fake scenarios.

22:52.258 --> 22:57.319
You can set up fake storage lockers that are full of valuable things.

22:57.359 --> 23:00.200
You can set up fake gambling scenarios.

23:00.220 --> 23:02.801
You can do whatever you want on social media.

23:02.821 --> 23:05.622
And so therefore, one must assume

23:06.122 --> 23:09.284
that the people who are governing us are taking full advantage of that.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.266
And then saying, oh, but the government is censoring people.

23:12.667 --> 23:34.001
And now you're not even arguing about the worst and most malevolent sort of manifestation of this, which is that they are most definitely lying to your kids on Snapchat and getting your kids to think about more and more myopic things and more and more irrelevant things.

23:37.244 --> 23:51.466
We don't need to be afraid of AI, we need to be afraid of our phones and social media and getting off of them and decentralizing to the point where maybe we just need to send emails to each other, maybe we need to just call.

23:51.966 --> 24:10.028
Maybe we need to drive over to each other's house, but we definitely, definitely, definitely don't need to continue to meet new random people on social media all around the world, because all that's doing is fracturing our families and fracturing our communities instead of what we need to do, which is kind of rebuild from there.

24:12.038 --> 24:20.863
And the pandemic would not have been possible without the blanket control of the narrative on social media.

24:21.984 --> 24:23.885
We were all needed to be at home.

24:23.925 --> 24:27.947
We all needed to be told the debate on Twitter is really where it's at.

24:28.788 --> 24:33.910
The up-to-date, up-to-the-minute news is only available on Twitter.

24:35.231 --> 24:39.534
All the new journalists are on Twitter and then, oh, but they're being censored.

24:39.694 --> 24:41.595
Oh, but then Elon's coming to save us.

24:41.675 --> 24:45.978
And now it's just all one giant trap.

24:46.178 --> 24:52.462
And if you just realize that no matter what, if you assume they're lying, it almost always makes more sense.

24:52.822 --> 24:55.304
Jay, that is the bottom line.

24:55.504 --> 24:59.907
Drop the mic, ring the bell, assume they

25:00.882 --> 25:01.423
are lying.

25:01.463 --> 25:04.026
The colloquial, they are lying.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.789
Okay, goes back to seek first.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.252
Humble ourselves, seek first.

25:09.673 --> 25:11.215
Look, we don't know our enemy.

25:12.116 --> 25:14.098
Jay, we don't know our enemy.

25:14.198 --> 25:16.882
And yet it's so funny in business and in sports,

25:17.651 --> 25:19.532
You do everything you can to know your enemy.

25:19.872 --> 25:21.273
You study their ankle injuries.

25:21.313 --> 25:23.974
You study whether the quarterback's having a fight with his wife.

25:24.274 --> 25:26.416
You study who's got a bruise on a knee.

25:26.796 --> 25:29.797
You study if it's going to be wet or rainy or indoor or out.

25:30.098 --> 25:31.138
You study everything.

25:31.178 --> 25:36.261
The Las Vegas oddsmakers, they make it a quantum science.

25:37.481 --> 25:44.045
Every variable on every player so they can get the point spread just right so you can bet money on who's going to win or lose.

25:44.585 --> 25:44.805
Right.

25:45.085 --> 25:54.613
Apple studies Microsoft and Microsoft studies Google and businesses, banks study other banks, you know, strengths and weaknesses.

25:54.653 --> 25:59.817
You do a SWOT analysis, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

26:00.117 --> 26:01.338
You're always looking at yourself.

26:02.018 --> 26:07.803
But we don't study the ultimate enemy, which is the liar.

26:09.332 --> 26:22.399
that wants to centralize control over all of us, treat us like chattel, own us, tax us, regulate us, get us to consume, get us to build their work and their factories.

26:22.819 --> 26:31.444
Yet, you know, you said the ultimate war in the world is a narrative war, and we're destroyed by our ignorance, the ignorance of who we are.

26:31.724 --> 26:35.286
And yesterday, our friend Michelle Stiles, here are the five trusts that are set up.

26:36.354 --> 26:42.379
This is what is used to weaponize against us, to reemphasize what you just said, okay?

26:42.859 --> 26:46.082
The three big truster experience, trust your eyes.

26:46.402 --> 26:52.467
Look, there's a guy in China riding on the ground doing the funky chicken, and here's an orange spiky ball.

26:52.807 --> 26:54.028
That caused it there.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.190
And oh my gosh, next picture.

26:56.530 --> 26:57.791
Let's look at Italy.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.414
Everybody in Italy is locking down.

27:00.654 --> 27:03.176
Oh my God, now let's go to New York.

27:04.096 --> 27:05.576
Oh, look at the hospitals.

27:05.796 --> 27:08.137
Oh my God, there's that orange ball again.

27:08.737 --> 27:16.659
So it's gotta be true because I saw with my eyes, it was taking place in China and in Italy and in New York.

27:17.099 --> 27:18.399
It must be true.

27:18.859 --> 27:20.059
Trust the Fauci's.

27:20.340 --> 27:23.920
So we go from the, I saw with my eyes, they set up the story.

27:24.380 --> 27:26.821
Now let's turn, I'm in such fear.

27:27.581 --> 27:31.822
Tell me CDC and who and Fauci, what should I do?

27:32.062 --> 27:33.743
Oh my goodness, save me.

27:34.383 --> 27:37.264
And then you go over to the trust of social pressure.

27:38.204 --> 27:41.625
Everybody's telling you, you got to protect grandma.

27:42.125 --> 27:45.486
You can't kill grandma without a vaccine shot and without a mask.

27:45.826 --> 27:47.807
If you do that, you could hurt society.

27:48.207 --> 27:52.988
Be a good, loyal, moral citizen and conform to the narrative.

27:54.128 --> 27:59.492
And there are three examples of how the trust is exploited for the benefit of who?

28:00.933 --> 28:07.138
Who benefited if four or five billion people took the mRNA inoculation and a whole bunch of people died?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.200
Who benefits from that?

28:10.180 --> 28:13.483
You know, Jay, you can speak to this better than I can.

28:14.724 --> 28:16.826
This was supposedly an airborne virus.

28:17.266 --> 28:21.329
This was a flu-like strain, a COVID-19 respiratory problem.

28:24.855 --> 28:29.980
And yet they jab everybody these mRNA cocktails.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.263
And what are people dying of over the last three years?

28:35.404 --> 28:47.775
Stroke, heart attack, regulatory, circulatory, blood-based viruses from a cure that was supposed to help us from a respiratory threat.

28:48.496 --> 28:50.918
Yet we're dying from the cocktail poison.

28:52.177 --> 28:53.398
Was that just a boo-boo?

28:53.938 --> 28:55.338
Or is it a bunch of idiots?

28:56.599 --> 28:59.199
No, no, no.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.561
I think it's got a really logical explanation.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.843
I mean, if you don't mind, I can start.

29:09.343 --> 29:09.823
I can answer.

29:09.843 --> 29:11.523
You're the expert, my friend.

29:11.543 --> 29:14.805
I think it's got a pretty logical explanation.

29:16.576 --> 29:19.878
It's going to require just a little bit of background narration.

29:19.938 --> 29:24.982
So the first kind of setup that I think I only said this in our pre chat.

29:25.022 --> 29:27.323
So if I repeated this in the interview, I apologize.

29:29.284 --> 29:35.686
When we were growing up, lying to get ahead was not considered to be something that you would do.

29:36.946 --> 29:39.847
Faking it until you're making it is not something that you would do.

29:39.947 --> 29:43.228
We did, you know, we might learn things very fast.

29:43.288 --> 29:47.630
We might, you know, apprentice with somebody here and apprentice with, we learned stuff and did it.

29:48.730 --> 29:51.851
I remember my dad saying, if you're gonna do anything, you might as well do it right.

29:52.831 --> 29:54.332
You know, I, there,

29:55.553 --> 29:57.074
You don't have to reinvent the wheel either.

29:57.094 --> 29:57.374
I don't know.

29:57.494 --> 30:07.823
I can't come up with a million different things, but I know that fake it till you make it was not something that anybody, any adult ever told me was a valid way of reaching success.

30:07.863 --> 30:10.064
That seems like something that's very recent.

30:11.045 --> 30:22.655
However, I don't think you should be, that we should underestimate how often recently, especially in the last

30:23.780 --> 30:39.696
three or four decades, something in terms of our very nature, in terms of a very understanding of who we are biologically, hasn't taken that same strategy of faking it until we make it.

30:39.756 --> 30:47.944
Now, let me give a very rudimentary example so that everybody understands what I'm talking about, and then I'm gonna apply it to what I think is the really big lie.

30:48.544 --> 30:51.006
The rudimentary example is Amazon Go.

30:51.066 --> 31:07.641
You might not remember this, but in 2018 or 19, there were these stores called Amazon Go, and they said they were using AI technology and computers and camera technology so that you could go in, you scan your phone, you tell them who you are, and then you go in the store and pick up whatever you want and walk out.

31:07.681 --> 31:11.504
And then somehow or another, their algorithms and their cameras and their AI

31:12.059 --> 31:14.701
would know what you picked up and charge you the right amount of money.

31:15.201 --> 31:22.386
And then they even made fun of that on Saturday Night Live and showed black people being afraid to go in there and thinking it was a trap.

31:23.447 --> 31:28.551
Well, the funny thing is, is that in the end, we found out that Amazon was faking it until they made it.

31:28.651 --> 31:30.192
So the way that they rolled it out,

31:30.779 --> 31:41.201
was they had a bunch of Indian people on cameras in India watching people and just, you know, you know, knowing what's in the store and, and watching the cameras and say, okay, she picked this up.

31:41.221 --> 31:54.464
She picked that up and then ringing her out with the idea that eventually the cameras and the data of the people moving around would, would give them enough repeated visits so that they could automate it.

31:55.105 --> 31:56.065
And that never happened.

31:56.185 --> 31:56.765
It didn't work.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.589
Nothing really worked, but they talked smack.

32:00.689 --> 32:01.630
They had a lot of things.

32:01.670 --> 32:12.639
They were saying they were using they had fancy names for the technology They were gonna develop and facial recognition or whatever, you know and our codes, but in the end it didn't work It was a fake it until you make it.

32:12.679 --> 32:23.469
Well, we could do that We could just put a bunch of people over there with cameras and then tell everybody that it's AI now if we go back to the late 80s and early 90s when

32:25.219 --> 32:28.184
the impetus was to sequence the human genome.

32:28.885 --> 32:34.655
I want your viewers to do a thought exercise about a national security state that had a goal.

32:35.635 --> 32:44.198
didn't have all the methodologies to get to that goal, but needed everybody to believe to the tune of billions of dollars that that goal was attainable.

32:44.638 --> 32:59.344
And even more in the back of the seat and behind the scenes, they scared the national security state because, you know, if we're going to get to that goal of understanding the human genome, it's going to be a lot harder for us because unlike India and unlike China,

33:00.250 --> 33:02.632
who have a lot more homogenous population.

33:02.672 --> 33:08.617
We have a lot harder nut to crack in America because we have all these different ethnicities and these half breed people.

33:09.057 --> 33:12.460
So we've got a lot more genetic diversity, which is really valuable.

33:13.393 --> 33:18.695
From a data perspective, it's the most valuable data set that's ever existed.

33:18.875 --> 33:29.478
And if we're going to reduce the population from what it is now to around 2 billion people, then while we're reducing the population, we better gather as much data as possible.

33:29.538 --> 33:37.921
Just like if you're going to get rid of a bunch of Jews in ovens, you might as well do medical experiments on them before you do that, right?

33:38.741 --> 33:40.642
The question is, where did that data go?

33:40.722 --> 33:42.484
Who has that data?

33:43.004 --> 33:44.405
Where did those doctors go?

33:44.765 --> 33:47.007
How did that data leave Germany?

33:47.067 --> 34:00.936
Because everybody talks about the ovens, but there is no possible way that the brilliant minds of the Germans didn't think that those aren't just... it's not wood.

34:01.820 --> 34:04.181
that we have over there, those are humans.

34:04.301 --> 34:06.781
We could use those for all kinds of stuff.

34:07.202 --> 34:12.483
A monkey of the NIH costs like $50,000 a year as a test animal.

34:13.103 --> 34:28.508
So if they could get the most valuable data from us and our children before they reduce the population, however they do it, what they would need to do is invert our understanding of our sovereignty so that we wouldn't even know we were submitting.

34:29.088 --> 34:41.941
And if, if they get to the stage where they want to get, then the reason why we will submit is because we're going to find out that, you know, a one size fits all kind of medicine is not really ideal.

34:41.981 --> 34:44.304
And although, you know, vaccines worked okay.

34:45.064 --> 34:49.688
The transfection to save people from the pandemic worked okay.

34:49.748 --> 34:52.610
It actually hurt a lot of people too because it wasn't perfect.

34:53.110 --> 34:57.473
And if we're going to make these things perfect, actually, we're not even going to be able to test anything.

34:57.493 --> 35:05.039
We're going to have to make something special for Rob Cunningham and his family, and we're going to have to make something special for Jonathan Cooey and his family because they're genetically different.

35:05.519 --> 35:22.856
And so ideally what you should do is just give us all your genetic data and all of your medical data, and eventually we'll be able to feed that AI, and the AI will just spit out personalized medicine for Rob and personalized medicine for Jay, and the FDA won't even need to be involved because, you know, we wouldn't test this on anybody else anyway.

35:22.876 --> 35:23.897
This is just made for you.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.700
And because we all know we're from the government, we're here to help.

35:27.634 --> 35:28.936
from the government, we're here to help.

35:28.956 --> 35:38.909
And the important thing to understand, Rob, is that these kinds of ideas were already being talked about in the 60s and in the 50s and written in books and in essays.

35:39.350 --> 35:42.234
They already knew that the nation states were in our way.

35:43.015 --> 35:53.378
the individual peoples and individual languages and cultures gets in the way of us being the stewards of our collective future.

35:53.438 --> 36:06.162
These people believe that at some point, if we're really going to be honest, we're going to have to pull our big boy pants on and start breeding on purpose and combining genes on purpose so that we get better people for the future.

36:06.202 --> 36:08.003
Otherwise, who knows what will happen?

36:08.900 --> 36:26.504
And I'm just trying to express in sort of a cartoon way how even before any of these people understood the irreducible complexity in the way that we understand it now, back in the 60s when we didn't have all the technology that we have now, they already knew.

36:27.386 --> 36:35.395
that they needed to get people to accept being experimental animals if we were ever going to get to the stage where we could make humankind better somehow.

36:35.535 --> 36:42.022
Even in a sci-fi way at the time, they assumed that at some point these technologies to edit the genome would come.

36:42.723 --> 36:48.088
And assumed that not only would they come, but it was kind of an obligation for us to use them.

36:48.809 --> 36:54.293
And that mindset predates where we are now by decades.

36:54.853 --> 37:09.823
And I heard Mike Eden say it the other day, and I really think he's right, that I've come to the conclusion that the whole concept of vaccination had this era in mind, that eventually they would get us, our parents, to believe in disease.

37:09.883 --> 37:16.147
And then they would get us, our parents' kids, to believe that vaccines have saved us from disease.

37:16.207 --> 37:18.069
And then they could just pull one more

37:18.849 --> 37:34.743
a little bait and switch and now that we've basically given up our sovereignty because you know it's crowded and and uh there's disease and we are actually right there right now and and we were we are i think the only thing i think is that they thought they would get all the way

37:35.777 --> 37:36.057
with it.

37:36.157 --> 37:38.419
I think they thought they were going to get higher compliance.

37:38.479 --> 37:40.380
I think they thought it would work better than it did.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.761
I think they thought less people would wake up.

37:43.782 --> 37:45.683
And I think they're pretty off script now.

37:45.743 --> 37:53.928
And that's the one huge hope I have, is that they still can use social media to pretend like they totally are exactly where they want to be.

37:54.428 --> 38:02.092
But I think they're so far off script now, and that's the reason why it feels so, so... They're in utter panic, Jay.

38:02.112 --> 38:02.733
Yeah, they are.

38:02.833 --> 38:03.353
I think they are.

38:03.866 --> 38:08.088
If they were leading and they were in control, they would not be acting the way they were acting.

38:08.469 --> 38:12.171
They're down by seven touchdowns with 14 seconds on the clock.

38:12.511 --> 38:14.452
And every play is a Hail Mary.

38:14.472 --> 38:16.773
And no matter what they do, they can't win this game.

38:17.354 --> 38:18.414
I like that.

38:18.434 --> 38:19.635
They cannot win this game.

38:19.895 --> 38:22.396
I want to go back 2000 years in one minute.

38:22.536 --> 38:23.497
Okay.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.878
The root of all evil is a love of money.

38:26.679 --> 38:26.799
And

38:27.501 --> 38:30.302
If you don't know yourself, you'll be lied to like crazy.

38:30.702 --> 38:31.802
You adopt their system.

38:32.402 --> 38:34.943
Once you adopt their system, then they can lie to you.

38:35.343 --> 38:37.043
They can use authoritative control.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.044
They can get you to lie to yourself.

38:39.704 --> 38:44.425
They can then impose a narrative on you and get out of fear.

38:45.005 --> 38:46.065
You don't know yourself.

38:47.026 --> 38:48.446
You consent to their system.

38:49.235 --> 38:50.716
They paralyze you with fear.

38:51.277 --> 38:53.419
And then everybody takes a knee because I don't know who I am.

38:53.459 --> 38:54.560
I don't know how to fear not.

38:54.900 --> 38:58.723
They told me this is for the societal good and for the better of humanity.

38:59.043 --> 39:06.590
And if I want to be a good, loving, compassionate person, I'm going to take a knee and bow to the system because the system is here to help me.

39:08.572 --> 39:09.973
That's not OK.

39:10.013 --> 39:15.998
And so yesterday in my conversation with Michelle again, I don't want to this is our interview, but good.

39:16.627 --> 39:30.807
What triggered a physical therapist to write a book on propaganda, The One Lie to Rule Them All, was when she discovered that a man was focused solely on marketing World War I.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.741
Wait a minute, marketing war.

39:33.942 --> 39:35.723
Why do you have to sell a war?

39:36.043 --> 39:40.106
Don't we go to war out of absolute dire consequences just to say, no, no, no.

39:40.547 --> 39:48.032
He had to market to a hundred million people and all the families that we needed to do this war and

39:49.378 --> 40:08.867
kill and blow up and go to Germany and die and send our boys off to war from mass casualty to this is the nebulous phrase that they spent infinite amounts of money through the fake money press, okay, of the Federal Reserve, where you click a button and you make money out of nowhere.

40:09.207 --> 40:15.710
And this guy is telling the world he had to market and advertise the need to go to World War I. And

40:17.651 --> 40:23.796
We need to go to World War I to help preserve democracy the world over.

40:25.477 --> 40:28.099
What the hell does that even mean?

40:28.580 --> 40:29.481
Sounds noble.

40:29.981 --> 40:32.603
Oh my gosh, I should want to do that too.

40:32.903 --> 40:39.669
If I'm patriotic, I want to preserve democracy the world over, then you'll go to war and kill a bunch of Germans.

40:40.450 --> 40:51.675
And so the idea of having to sell war to Americans who in our natural state have no interest in going and killing somebody else.

40:52.335 --> 40:56.256
I don't want to go kill you and blow you up and leave my family and blow things up.

40:57.217 --> 41:02.699
War is not a natural state for the natural essence of who we are.

41:03.239 --> 41:07.641
But division, destruction, devouring, divide and conquer

41:08.240 --> 41:11.322
is the natural state for those in charge of the system.

41:12.142 --> 41:22.429
That goes back to we live in this world, but not of it, not by its ways and means, not by its narratives, not by its bullshit.

41:23.489 --> 41:31.354
But if we don't know the laws and the orders and how to resist the liars, the liars best us.

41:31.974 --> 41:32.535
They get us.

41:34.096 --> 41:34.256
So.

41:35.507 --> 41:47.433
I mean, I don't know what to say other than every time we log in, every time we pick up social media and allow it to put thoughts in our head, it's a lot worse than the TV when we were kids.

41:47.573 --> 41:50.994
I mean, this is extreme.

41:51.835 --> 41:55.977
And what frightens me most is that I, as a parent,

41:58.075 --> 42:09.105
I see a lot of other younger parents around me that clearly don't understand that their children will be permanently broken if at four years old they're already scrolling.

42:10.907 --> 42:15.991
I'm not saying that my two boys don't have a phone, they do, but they are still

42:17.259 --> 42:19.420
not scrolling.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.020
They send messages to their friends.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.581
I send messages to them.

42:23.861 --> 42:26.102
Sometimes they have a YouTube video on there.

42:26.122 --> 42:34.025
Yes, I'm not perfect, but it's not... I see their classmates.

42:34.605 --> 42:35.885
For example, we went to the

42:38.809 --> 42:40.090
to the orientation yesterday.

42:40.110 --> 42:42.211
It was an auditorium full of parents and kids.

42:43.232 --> 42:49.555
And then we walked around the school, you know, to see where his classrooms were so that he knew where to go in the first days and stuff.

42:50.276 --> 42:59.121
And I was pretty, pretty shocked at the number of, you know, groups of girls walking around giggling and all of them holding a phone.

42:59.981 --> 43:00.922
And I

43:01.929 --> 43:03.429
You know, I could be wrong.

43:03.469 --> 43:13.092
Maybe they all had their schedule on their phone, but I don't think they did because they, um, the average, the average girl, I believe sends about 600 messages a day.

43:13.592 --> 43:15.232
That is just absurd to me.

43:15.532 --> 43:29.276
It is absolutely absurd to me, especially when I think about, um, in high school, you know, this is, this is just going to really reveal how old I am, but in high school in Wisconsin, um,

43:31.886 --> 43:39.052
I could recognize people's handwriting because we sent notes to everybody and left notes.

43:40.033 --> 43:45.197
And the idea now that my kids almost think handwriting is kind of archaic.

43:45.337 --> 43:47.579
And cursive is not even taught anymore.

43:47.659 --> 43:51.942
Cursive is not even taught anymore, which I find extraordinary.

43:52.343 --> 43:56.686
And every time I write, somebody is always like, well, your handwriting, well, you gotta do it.

43:57.867 --> 44:02.112
You can stop writing for six months and your handwriting will deteriorate rapidly.

44:02.192 --> 44:04.895
I mean, but it's funny.

44:04.975 --> 44:10.742
I mean, I can remember how, yeah, I don't know.

44:10.802 --> 44:16.228
I just, for me, it's really disturbing from also the perspective of as a neurobiologist,

44:19.023 --> 44:28.606
I can remember very clearly a number of my teachers telling me that, you might be able to remember, but you need to take the notes anyway, because writing them down puts it in a different place in your brain.

44:29.106 --> 44:30.126
And they're not wrong.

44:30.427 --> 44:35.808
You're writing it, you're putting it into your motor cortex, your eyes are watching you write it.

44:36.228 --> 44:41.350
When you make a mistake with the writing, then your brain is also processing that.

44:41.390 --> 44:45.471
And all of that processing doesn't occur even when you just type.

44:46.011 --> 44:46.732
Nevermind.

44:46.952 --> 44:48.453
The ultimate hard drive.

44:49.054 --> 44:50.595
The ultimate hard drive.

44:50.655 --> 44:52.536
The quantum hard drive.

44:52.796 --> 44:55.439
We can remember stuff we did at four, five, and six years old.

44:56.139 --> 44:57.160
Yep.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.422
And the extreme examples of memory are flawless.

45:00.503 --> 45:03.945
So there are these kind of savant-like people.

45:04.045 --> 45:07.848
Many of them are very highly functional people, and a lot of them are actors, actually.

45:08.589 --> 45:09.249
There's a lady,

45:12.273 --> 45:15.274
She was on, did she play Mary Tyler Moore, I think?

45:15.974 --> 45:25.836
But one of these actresses from the 70s, it was like on one of these TV shows, but it's not Sally Field, but for some reason she looks a lot like Sally Field to me.

45:26.316 --> 45:30.497
This woman is autobiographically perfect.

45:30.897 --> 45:33.278
She can remember all the way back to about,

45:34.335 --> 45:36.096
her first year of life.

45:36.696 --> 45:47.100
And if you ask her about any particular date, she says that once she gets a trigger, the whole thing just kind of uploads and she experiences the day again.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.841
She can tell you what she wore, what it smelled like, what she ate.

45:52.162 --> 45:53.282
She's just bizarre.

45:53.362 --> 45:59.084
But when you see that she applied that to being able to read a script and remember it forever.

45:59.724 --> 46:00.465
So that made her a

46:01.545 --> 46:04.147
you know, that's a pretty badass skill to have if you want to act.

46:05.088 --> 46:14.817
And so she turned it into a living, but it was also a very much a kind of a handicap too, because you can't get in an argument with this person.

46:16.127 --> 46:19.170
And you can't have a discussion with them because they're like, no, that's not what you said.

46:19.871 --> 46:22.453
And I know it's not what you said because you were sitting over there.

46:22.473 --> 46:26.177
You had you had his food in your hand and you were speaking with your mouth full.

46:26.237 --> 46:28.459
And I didn't like the potatoes like that.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.303
That's you know, that's an annoying person to have around sometimes.

46:33.284 --> 46:35.146
That's quantum consciousness.

46:35.426 --> 46:35.727
Yeah.

46:35.747 --> 46:36.848
Completely aware.

46:37.310 --> 46:40.731
of everything 24 seven dialed in.

46:40.751 --> 47:01.359
But I find myself, Rob, I find myself wondering if she is rare only because of the amount of toxins and pollution and mismanagement of our environment and our own lives that she's so rare.

47:01.559 --> 47:02.680
And if we were,

47:03.439 --> 47:15.237
from the very beginning, trying to optimize our children biologically and spiritually, that maybe half of the kids would have memory that strong, or half of the children would be, this is what worries me.

47:15.797 --> 47:18.802
Who gets to define the narrative that we're all normal and she was weird?

47:19.229 --> 47:21.452
Yeah, exactly, exactly weird.

47:21.752 --> 47:33.545
Who gets to say that it's the narrative makers that get and then the group thing and then the teachers and the tube on television and the government tells us this is where you play.

47:33.766 --> 47:36.509
If you're outside the 40 yard lines, you're weird.

47:37.375 --> 47:42.179
If you're in the end zone where you're supposed to be, don't be like those weird people.

47:42.539 --> 47:46.062
Nikola Tesla can't have that guy thinking too much.

47:46.423 --> 47:52.808
Let's lock down all his 6,000 patents, give him a label, put him over there, call him a weird eccentric.

47:53.209 --> 47:54.570
Don't be like Tesla.

47:55.350 --> 47:57.192
What if we should be like Tesla?

47:58.339 --> 48:12.390
The funny part is, is if you tell somebody that, just tell them this, and I think it's pretty true, I've heard it, I haven't verified it myself, but it's my understanding that Goodyear, or what is the other name for that?

48:12.830 --> 48:16.953
It's Goodyear, I'm seeing ICH at the end.

48:17.894 --> 48:23.678
Goodyear is, well, whatever the company that made tires, I thought they had-

48:24.833 --> 48:25.694
Michelin Goodrich.

48:25.774 --> 48:27.195
Goodrich is the name they wanted.

48:27.235 --> 48:28.316
Yes.

48:28.737 --> 48:37.345
They have patents on particular kinds of rubber that will last more than 250,000 miles.

48:37.385 --> 48:43.311
And they just put them in a vault so that no one could make those tires because they don't want those tires out on the world.

48:44.472 --> 48:47.675
And people, if you tell that to somebody, they're like, oh, that makes sense.

48:48.630 --> 48:55.092
But they never think the idea, okay, well, if that makes sense, then what about something like free electricity?

48:56.072 --> 49:01.234
Out of the ether sphere, it's just out there, it can be extracted, it can be free.

49:01.554 --> 49:02.834
But why would we want that?

49:02.854 --> 49:04.895
Because you can't put a meter on free.

49:05.355 --> 49:05.975
No, you can't.

49:06.580 --> 49:09.481
And there goes back to the love of money as a root of all evil, right?

49:09.501 --> 49:10.521
There's a lot of people now.

49:10.541 --> 49:11.401
I don't know if you've seen it.

49:11.421 --> 49:14.982
I guess if you mentioned Tesla so quickly, you probably have seen it.

49:15.002 --> 49:20.022
But there are people who have verified the idea.

49:20.463 --> 49:33.465
One of the things I saw him draw, or a drawing of his interpretation of him, was that just putting a wire, a very narrow, tiny wire that will connect the upper atmosphere to the ground, it's a permanent voltage step.

49:34.585 --> 49:36.286
And people with drones have done this.

49:36.366 --> 49:44.849
So you can take a drone and you can take a really light nanowire of copper and just take it up to about 150 feet.

49:45.169 --> 49:50.991
And if you put a voltmeter on the bottom of it between ground and that wire, you will find a constant voltage across it.

49:51.761 --> 50:08.886
And so there's no question that even in certain geographic places, it might have been possible for ancient cultures to have realized this just by suspending things and you know, whoa, there's a shock on this thing or there's a charge on this.

50:08.926 --> 50:10.726
And I don't know how it would have happened, I don't know.

50:11.247 --> 50:15.948
But for example, one of the reasons why the pyramids might be interesting is because they're high enough

50:16.508 --> 50:23.194
that something like that could have been inside of them or outside of them and that phenomenon could have been there.

50:23.234 --> 50:35.984
Research indicates that the singular one tallest pyramid had transmissibility, if you will, that could reach 99% of the world's surfaces electronically.

50:36.304 --> 50:41.649
It was an antenna that would allow for electricity and signals and wireless communication.

50:42.444 --> 50:51.546
Anyone that believes that was built for a burial tomb for the rich and the famous just to put dead bodies and preserve people and all of their gold and jewelry and gold.

50:51.606 --> 50:55.687
Must have been a really nice guy, man, that's for sure.

50:55.767 --> 51:07.570
And they still cannot explain to us what was the mechanical lift and hoist and technology to cut the stone so perfectly and build it and put it in the pyramid

51:09.355 --> 51:17.538
2,000 years ago, Nikola Tesla was an idiot savant that understood energy, vibration, and frequency.

51:17.798 --> 51:26.321
They understood that we are in a magnetic world, not an electric world, and yet everything is over here about electricity instead of magnetism.

51:27.321 --> 51:35.244
And if you don't know, I mean, one of the ways to do that, right, is to just realize that if magnets are how electricity is made,

51:36.252 --> 51:41.834
And every magnet on Earth will align to the magnetic field of the Earth.

51:41.894 --> 51:44.475
And that seems like something we maybe could tap into.

51:44.755 --> 51:45.035
Right.

51:48.156 --> 51:48.556
You think?

51:48.996 --> 51:49.317
Wow.

51:49.537 --> 51:59.160
So Jonathan, if you were to go, if you could wave a magic wand, and I don't want to take up too much of your time, but if you could wave a magic wand and have

51:59.855 --> 52:06.556
an hour or 30 minute or 10 minute press conference and the entire world tuned in and listened to it.

52:07.076 --> 52:19.459
What would be your message of awakening or awareness or where we are or what steps we should as humanity take given the lessons of the last five years?

52:20.039 --> 52:26.800
What should we really put front and center in our heart, mind and soul if we want to bring

52:27.225 --> 52:33.670
some transformative health and sanity and unity and peace and love back to the world.

52:34.310 --> 52:42.776
What's the takeaway from the last five horrendous years that could make the future five years better?

52:47.639 --> 52:49.120
I'll try this out and see if it works.

52:49.180 --> 52:52.623
This is a college level biology 101 book.

52:54.520 --> 53:00.637
And in my humble description here, there are two ways to read this book.

53:01.679 --> 53:15.250
And I was raised to read the book in the way that academic people read it, and bird watchers read it, and entomologists read it, and even plant biologists read the book.

53:15.310 --> 53:17.632
The way they read the book is this, and there's nothing wrong with it.

53:17.672 --> 53:30.362
I just think that if you asked me what the big message is for everybody on earth, this would be the message that I think could penetrate the most people from academic biologists all the way down to people that work at a gas station.

53:30.982 --> 53:37.505
So this is a biology book, it's Biology 101, which means in theory, anybody could just read this and learn Biology 101.

53:38.005 --> 53:47.549
And what you would learn is about DNA and RNA and proteins and bacteria and the kingdoms and all how these animals do things and how this all works.

53:48.309 --> 54:00.194
And what you would see, if you were reading it like I was told to read it, like my biology teacher in high school, Mr. Jensen had me read it, like Dr. Beck at DePaul University had me read it, it would be like this.

54:00.914 --> 54:18.180
oh wow they understand that and they know that and wow they know that too oh wow that's a lot to know oh geez wow that's a lot of details they know all that too holy cow there's more details this is really incredible like i can't believe how much we know like they they they understand everything like it's

54:18.760 --> 54:20.121
Man, they figured that out too?

54:20.221 --> 54:21.301
Holy cow!

54:21.381 --> 54:24.682
Like, they know how DNAs co- Oh, wow, the skull fits like that?

54:25.202 --> 54:37.807
Man, oh man, the- Oh my gosh, I can't believe how animal-y body plans have some symmetry and like, neat- Oh, wow, I mean, it's just crazy how insects have their skeleton on the outs- I mean, plants have different kinds of genomes.

54:37.927 --> 54:39.507
Man, oh man, even ants!

54:39.787 --> 54:41.648
Oh my gosh, look at those enzymes!

54:41.748 --> 54:46.490
Wow, the immune system- And so by the time you're done, it's like, I'm just overwhelmed.

54:47.290 --> 55:02.517
at the amount of understanding we have compared to what in the 1800s when we just basically you know could look at somebody's urine crystals and take their temperature and look at the color of their skin and then make some guess about how they were and maybe give them something and then that would be it.

55:03.217 --> 55:13.486
We really have so much more understanding of our biology that we're really close to just basically being carpenters for ourselves, right?

55:13.506 --> 55:14.247
We can just do it.

55:14.307 --> 55:17.870
I mean, we're so close to understanding compared to where we were.

55:19.051 --> 55:24.116
And I think that this is a fundamentally wrong way for anybody to read this book.

55:24.156 --> 55:26.498
What I think you should read it as is really this way.

55:29.560 --> 55:29.881
Wow.

55:29.962 --> 55:33.113
So, um, it's already pretty complicated.

55:33.555 --> 55:33.695
Um,

55:34.835 --> 55:38.077
Oh, wait, it's got that part too, so that makes it more complicated.

55:38.918 --> 55:42.220
Wait, oh, wow, it's like that, but that's even more complicated.

55:43.181 --> 55:47.604
So wait, oh, these little parts all go together to do that?

55:47.904 --> 55:49.966
Oh, no, then that's really much more complicated.

55:50.006 --> 55:52.627
Wait, under a microscope, there are that many of those?

55:52.828 --> 55:55.610
Oh, no, then it's really much more complicated than we thought.

55:56.110 --> 55:58.111
No way, can we see?

55:58.211 --> 56:01.694
No, that's really, holy shit, we're never gonna figure this out.

56:03.035 --> 56:06.457
That is where I was as an academic biologist.

56:06.517 --> 56:08.238
That is where I was with the brain.

56:08.298 --> 56:14.681
I thought the best part about my job was that no matter how much I did, we were still going to be horribly lost.

56:15.081 --> 56:19.544
And there was still going to be plenty to do, which means that there was plenty for my students to do.

56:20.244 --> 56:21.285
And that was great.

56:21.825 --> 56:23.506
But for me, it was a reverence.

56:23.726 --> 56:26.968
It was kind of like, don't get an ego about this, man.

56:27.788 --> 56:33.752
All we're doing really is trying to find another little piece to make sure that we understand we're never going to.

56:34.173 --> 56:40.337
The more pieces we find, the more complicated the watch is, and we're not trying to figure out how a watch works.

56:41.403 --> 56:46.969
And so we just need to realize that every time we see a new kind of bird, it's just beauty.

56:47.269 --> 56:48.210
It's awesome.

56:48.611 --> 56:50.973
Every time we find a new enzyme, it's just beauty.

56:51.073 --> 56:51.914
It's fantastic.

56:51.954 --> 56:53.295
It's more complicated.

56:53.916 --> 56:55.378
It's more beautiful than I thought.

56:55.418 --> 57:01.524
There are more angles than I thought, which makes everything more beautiful, but that's not how the NIH

57:02.705 --> 57:03.665
funds science.

57:03.725 --> 57:06.666
That's not how universities think of science.

57:06.706 --> 57:10.108
That's not why universities give tenure.

57:10.148 --> 57:18.150
They give tenure to people who can pick this book up and claim that in 10 years most of the relevant questions will be answered.

57:18.230 --> 57:19.871
And those are the people to get funded.

57:20.464 --> 57:25.366
Those are the people that teach, those are the people that go on and that's the mythology.

57:25.426 --> 57:27.226
The mythology is really easy to break.

57:27.386 --> 57:37.450
This book and all books like it are evidence of how hard the problem is and how unlikely it is we will ever solve it and why we should turn instead.

57:38.598 --> 57:55.801
toward trying to optimize ourselves, optimize our lives, optimize by starting with the assumption that we're perfect from the beginning, instead of starting with the assumption that most of us are broken and only if we study really hard will we find the fix for it.

57:55.841 --> 57:56.881
That's ridiculous.

57:56.941 --> 57:57.822
That's absurd.

57:58.222 --> 58:05.123
The idea that my child came out of my wife in Norway and they told us, and this is really what broke me, Rob, just tell you,

58:05.703 --> 58:08.488
I'll go back to my own story that I didn't tell you then.

58:08.508 --> 58:11.513
We had our first two boys in Norway.

58:12.705 --> 58:17.827
And the first boy, you wouldn't believe it, the boy gets born, we're there for a little while, whatever.

58:18.227 --> 58:27.389
And then they take you down to the basement and they put you on this little robot train that takes you across the street, under the street to a hotel.

58:27.789 --> 58:39.953
And in that hotel, you get three days with a cord that every time you pull it, a midwife comes in and she teaches the dad and the mom how to get the baby to latch on healthily and breastfeed.

58:40.493 --> 58:48.802
so that the dad, who can see much better than the mom can, knows how to put the baby on better than the mom does.

58:49.543 --> 58:55.309
And so you actually, they invest three full days into creating a

58:56.070 --> 59:00.094
father that can be the the lactation coach.

59:00.695 --> 59:06.040
And this is an unbelievable thing that when we experienced it, it was like, dude, this is easy.

59:06.521 --> 59:11.506
Like if I have a nurse that's going to teach me how to change the diaper and how hard I can push on the button,

59:11.966 --> 59:34.238
how hard I should wipe and what's clean and and I don't have to talk about it with my wife because if I pull that cord another lady will come in and confirm it and if I can't figure it out and this lady comes in and says no no grab the breast do this push this on it should look like that you can over three days become confident enough that when the baby's crying and your wife is exhausted that you don't go

59:35.458 --> 59:36.438
You just go, it's all good.

59:36.818 --> 59:37.638
I did this already.

59:38.218 --> 59:46.280
And that it kind of investment was contrasted because we never really intended to have another kid, but we came back to the United States.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.060
We ended up having a daughter.

59:48.120 --> 59:51.981
And when she was born in the United States, that experience was so different.

59:53.001 --> 01:00:03.363
So different than what we were, what happened in Norway, because after we left the hotel in Norway, then we had another visit a few weeks later and they explained to us how's, how's breastfeeding going.

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:04.863
Well, it's going great.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:08.272
well then we don't need to talk about immunizations for a while, you can come back later.

01:00:09.132 --> 01:00:13.515
And so the whole principle was that if you stay breastfeeding, we're not even gonna talk to you about shots.

01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:25.082
And that went on for a while before I, you know, like I don't know, was it nine months or whatever they gave him the MMR or something, but it was very not, there's no pressure.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:29.285
You wanna wait till he's four because you're gonna breastfeed all till he's four, fine, do it.

01:00:30.635 --> 01:00:37.500
And so this was contrasted very much by Freddie coming out and there's a needle going into her.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.621
And I'm like, what is, what is that?

01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:41.642
And then another one went, what is that?

01:00:41.882 --> 01:00:48.006
And the obstetrician looked at me and she said, congratulations, you have a blue baby.

01:00:48.026 --> 01:00:57.091
Now, I don't know if you're aware, but when Asian people have babies, a lot of times they get this kind of red, blue stain on their back or somewhere on their body.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:59.173
It's like a temporary birthmark.

01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:12.092
And in a country like the Netherlands or in a country like America, where you have this wide variety of people, obstetricians are very aware that when this happens, you kind of have to make a little note of it.

01:01:12.132 --> 01:01:16.296
Because if you don't note it, it can look like a giant body bruise.

01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:19.959
And so you don't want a doctor to find that and be like, what the hell did you do to your baby?

01:01:20.399 --> 01:01:21.199
It's just normal.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:46.490
But what's really interesting was, is that this lady understood, because my wife is white, you know, Dutch, and I hate that word white, but she's a Caucasian lady, you know, Dutch lady, red hair, white skin, and I'm a half Filipino guy, so I've got tan skin, and she's an Indian lady, and she's complimenting me because my jeans got into my tan baby, and it had this blue Asian mark on it.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:50.511
And I was screaming about the fact that she just gave two shots.

01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:51.791
Like, what is going on?

01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:57.033
And so after this disconnect where she's like, why do you don't understand that I'm complimenting you?

01:01:57.253 --> 01:01:59.953
I'm trying to ask what you just injected into my baby.

01:02:00.013 --> 01:02:01.434
My wife is kind of like, what happened?

01:02:01.454 --> 01:02:01.834
What happened?

01:02:01.854 --> 01:02:02.254
What happened?

01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:04.014
So I, I blew it.

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:08.816
Like I should have kept calm and whatever, but it was a really rude awakening.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:10.176
And then, man, I still didn't wake up.

01:02:11.158 --> 01:02:16.805
because she got all of her shots, not really on schedule, but kind of on schedule here because

01:02:18.237 --> 01:02:19.358
We didn't know better yet.

01:02:19.598 --> 01:02:21.939
You know, it's just like, well, yeah, they're the same shots.

01:02:22.019 --> 01:02:23.599
It's a little earlier in America.

01:02:23.619 --> 01:02:27.961
You know, you kind of want to forget about what happened on the birthday, but I just didn't process it.

01:02:28.002 --> 01:02:29.142
I still didn't process it.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.143
And even COVID happened and I still wasn't processing it.

01:02:32.604 --> 01:02:37.846
And then we lost our house in the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and we had to move to this new school district.

01:02:38.226 --> 01:02:39.207
And I still didn't have it.

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:40.927
I still gave my boys their shots in 2022.

01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:50.055
And then only after we moved in 2022 was it that Bobby Kennedy called me and said, sorry, that's wrong.

01:02:50.996 --> 01:03:02.027
It was right before we moved that Bobby Kennedy called me, but I didn't watch Vax or find out really what CHD was all about until many months after he hired me because again, remember,

01:03:02.928 --> 01:03:08.392
I thought that I was fired at the University of Pittsburgh for speaking out about a lab leak on my bicycle.

01:03:08.572 --> 01:03:16.678
I thought that I had to continue to raise alarm about this gain-of-function virus, this lab leak likelihood that they were covering up.

01:03:17.178 --> 01:03:20.901
And so Bobby called me because he wanted my expertise about that.

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:23.623
That's why I was able to help him write this book.

01:03:24.103 --> 01:03:30.307
But in the course of writing this book, I came to the conclusion that RNA viruses can't pandemic.

01:03:30.347 --> 01:03:30.948
They can't do

01:03:31.787 --> 01:03:36.508
millions and millions of infections and be tracked by millions of sequences.

01:03:36.548 --> 01:03:42.750
This was all a biological mythology that the national security state wanted us to teach our kids.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:54.813
And even if there are RNA molecules that can be dangerous, the only reason why they would ever be dangerous is because there are very proven industrial ways to make a lot of them.

01:03:55.954 --> 01:04:00.477
An RNA molecule in a few copies, no matter what it is, cannot be dangerous to any of us.

01:04:00.557 --> 01:04:19.290
But if you took that same RNA molecule and made one million copies of it and then aerosolized it and put it in somebody's lungs, it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was a massive immune reaction that included cytotoxicity and all kinds of other things that might happen as a result of that immune challenge.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.671
But that's not virology.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:24.174
That's not a RNA molecule all of its own

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:26.595
deciding to go around the world.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:31.638
And this, I think, really feeds back into your knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and life message.

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:37.442
I have really fallen in love with a guy by the name of Buckminster Fuller.

01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:41.865
And Buckminster Fuller explains life as a pattern integrity.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:45.647
And what his most rudimentary example

01:04:48.769 --> 01:04:54.153
I actually keep it on my table over here all the time, because I just think it's one of the most important books I've ever read.

01:04:54.713 --> 01:04:57.876
This page is the most important page of the book.

01:04:59.953 --> 01:05:04.657
And in this page, he's showing a picture of a rope over here.

01:05:04.697 --> 01:05:10.882
And the rope, if you can see it in the picture, it's black and white, is a rope composed of three different parts.

01:05:10.942 --> 01:05:12.403
And then they're kind of spliced together.

01:05:13.144 --> 01:05:15.605
And then he writes this little poem on the other side.

01:05:15.665 --> 01:05:17.087
Man is a pattern integrity.

01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:19.509
He is like a knot tied in a rope.

01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:20.429
He is not the rope.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:28.516
I'm going to splice a piece of manila rope to a piece of cotton rope, and then splice the other end of the cotton rope to a piece of nylon rope.

01:05:29.136 --> 01:05:31.518
And then I'm going to make the simplest knot that I know.

01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:33.660
The rope has not done this.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.121
I have done this to the rope.

01:05:35.242 --> 01:05:41.027
I can slide this knot along, and I slide it along the rope, and now it leaves the manila, and it goes on to the cotton.

01:05:41.707 --> 01:05:44.350
And I keep sliding it along, and now it's on the nylon.

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:46.592
And so, and suddenly, it's off the end.

01:05:47.662 --> 01:05:49.842
We say the knot was a pattern integrity.

01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:52.603
It wasn't manila, it wasn't cotton, it wasn't nylon.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.923
Cotton, nylon, and manila.

01:05:55.063 --> 01:06:00.424
Any of them are good to let us know about its shape and what the pattern was, but it was not that.

01:06:00.505 --> 01:06:02.445
It had an integrity all its own.

01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:07.386
And I would argue that this is the best way, oops, sorry, I did that very wrong.

01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:12.827
The best way for us to think about life and what life is and what isn't life.

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:18.190
A pattern integrity that we are is much more complicated than this analogy that he said.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:29.137
We are a pattern integrity where chemicals and materials come into our body and are a part of us for a time and then are gone again and breezed out or sweat out or lost.

01:06:29.858 --> 01:06:35.761
And we've all heard this analogy that, you know, there's a water molecule in every one of us that was also part of Napoleon.

01:06:36.322 --> 01:06:39.504
But that is the idea of a pattern integrity.

01:06:39.564 --> 01:06:40.965
We are so complex.

01:06:42.338 --> 01:06:49.843
that what we are is an emergent property of the stuff that's currently participating in our pattern integrity.

01:06:49.883 --> 01:06:56.768
But the stuff that's participating in our pattern integrity is always changing and it is a constant state of dynamic movement.

01:06:57.208 --> 01:07:02.051
And in that way, even our spirituality is an emergent property of that.

01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:06.414
It's not manifest in it, it is an emergent property of it.

01:07:06.454 --> 01:07:07.535
And so the moment that

01:07:08.433 --> 01:07:14.820
that that pattern integrity ceases to constantly regenerate and exist, life isn't there.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.628
And so what they have done to us and want us to teach our kids is that an RNA molecule is a pattern integrity, and it's just not.

01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:29.936
It can't do the kinds of things that a really successfully designed mosquito might be able to do in a few years.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:35.746
It can't do even what a bacteria, a very successful bacteria might be able to do.

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:38.490
Because again, whatever that is...

01:07:39.602 --> 01:07:50.270
that they are calling viruses, whether they're real or not, the real reality is that you can't put a combination of chemicals together and say, look, it'll go by itself now.

01:07:51.010 --> 01:08:01.718
And we don't understand where that transition occurs to where if you lightning bolt plus the right number of proteins and now you have life, that's just as big a bullshit story.

01:08:01.758 --> 01:08:05.981
Because in reality, the transition from the not

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:09.051
in the rope.

01:08:09.853 --> 01:08:13.620
And that's what Buckminster says without really saying it is that he tied the rope.

01:08:14.537 --> 01:08:19.200
The explanation for the pattern integrity in the rope is Buckminster in his hands.

01:08:19.801 --> 01:08:26.365
And so if you want to understand the pattern integrity that is us, you actually have to explain the hands.

01:08:26.825 --> 01:08:30.408
And we don't have any way of getting to what those are.

01:08:30.468 --> 01:08:33.310
We are just given what we are given.

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:38.333
We have to humbly submit to the idea that it's gotta be a creator.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.734
It's gotta be something.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:41.336
And this is what,

01:08:42.276 --> 01:08:51.264
I guess I was raised a Catholic, which for a lot of people, you would say you're a recovering Catholic then because of the catechism or whatever.

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:56.989
But I had a very healthy relationship with God as a kid, and I believe in prayer still.

01:08:57.009 --> 01:09:07.459
I went in and out of it in my adult life, and I'm not afraid to admit it because a lot of being in academia supersedes faith in that way.

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:13.832
And so, like many, many weak souls, you don't turn until you need help.

01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:21.475
And when I had this trouble at the beginning of the pandemic and thought I was losing everything is when I started to say, hey man, what's going on?

01:09:21.515 --> 01:09:26.016
I was trying to, I was doing everything I thought I was supposed to do and it turns out I wasn't.

01:09:26.436 --> 01:09:29.157
I hadn't asked for advice for a very long time.

01:09:29.197 --> 01:09:31.117
I hadn't asked for guidance in a very long time.

01:09:31.717 --> 01:09:35.018
And I realized how arrogant I was and where I was at that time.

01:09:35.078 --> 01:09:35.919
And I spent,

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:48.423
I'd spent a lot of years trying to play that game at the detriment of my relationship with my young kids and the detriment of my relationship with my wife to a lot of extent.

01:09:48.443 --> 01:09:58.172
I mean, not to say, but just I realize now in retrospect how ridiculously I was letting that become precariously untended.

01:09:58.812 --> 01:10:21.420
um and you know bending all of my energy on what happened at work and how I'm pleasing those people and we all are there and just I can only relate my personal experience and and and hopefully relate it in such a way so that people can have sympathy for the thousands of people that are still trapped inside universities thinking that they're doing the right thing despite knowing in their gut that some of this

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.082
woke ideology isn't perfect or, you know, that's what they tell themselves.

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:26.883
It's not great.

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:31.145
But, you know, I just keep my head down and I do my thing and I answer my questions.

01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:34.107
And all of these people are exactly where I was.

01:10:34.687 --> 01:10:40.530
And the whole system is designed to keep you so busy that you don't have the time to do anything else.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.612
And so I have a lot of sympathy for those people.

01:10:43.652 --> 01:10:46.694
I'm sure I'm upset about the people at the University of Pittsburgh that

01:10:47.254 --> 01:10:55.759
knew me before and know me now, still haven't ever reached out to me, even though they have to know I was much closer to the truth than they were back then.

01:10:57.661 --> 01:11:08.948
But I just, I think now the most important thing for me has been that this last four years has been a lot, still a lot of ego processing that people are lying to me and I have the answer.

01:11:09.468 --> 01:11:12.250
And it's taken me four years to come

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:16.373
to the realization that that message is never going to ring with anybody.

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:24.600
That message is still kind of a permutation of what social media is doing to everyone.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:30.165
I just happen to be focused for a very long time on my own personal disgruntled situation.

01:11:32.503 --> 01:11:43.945
After speaking at the Red Pill and then watching myself at the Red Pill and recognizing that in myself, I've made a lot of progress in the last few months, really coming to terms with how I can

01:11:45.814 --> 01:11:53.798
see myself and the people that are still trapped and then try to come up with a message that's really a useful ladder for them to get out.

01:11:54.359 --> 01:12:03.444
Because I really think I'm one of the few people who might have a chance of saving some of those people because I did have a relationship with a lot of those people.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:12.309
I do have a track record that's not zero and I do have, I think, a pretty solid biological argument

01:12:14.153 --> 01:12:17.395
to make all of them sort of accepted.

01:12:17.435 --> 01:12:23.717
I think, and that might be a good way for me to get to a sort of condensed last message.

01:12:25.598 --> 01:12:31.020
Let me just put this one slide up here and then we'll see if, oh, shoot.

01:12:32.202 --> 01:12:54.235
control Z sorry about that I didn't mean to be so so please I want you if you don't mind Jonathan very quickly continue with what you're doing I'm gonna go off camera for about 30 seconds I'll be perfect no problem so I think that that the

01:12:55.795 --> 01:13:02.419
The way that you can get a lot of different people to really understand what's going on here is to first remind them of what is supposed to have happened.

01:13:02.459 --> 01:13:04.440
And that goes back to our in a camp pandemic.

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.516
They told us that there was a mystery virus.

01:13:07.536 --> 01:13:08.776
You can see that behind me here.

01:13:09.237 --> 01:13:12.239
And that the mystery virus was causing all these excess deaths.

01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:19.783
Now the graph that I have behind me is from 2014 over here all the way to the end of 2021 over here.

01:13:20.364 --> 01:13:26.688
And what you see in the different colors, the yellow are the calculated flu deaths, which we all are aware.

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:30.752
virtually went to zero at the start of the pandemic, but that's kind of a distraction.

01:13:31.193 --> 01:13:36.178
What you actually also see here behind me in the blue are pneumonia deaths.

01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:40.403
Now, pneumonia is killing every year from 2014 on between 5,000 and 2,500 people every week.

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:45.554
in America.

01:13:46.095 --> 01:13:50.478
That's a lot of people dying from pneumonia, despite we treat pneumonia very well.

01:13:51.439 --> 01:13:59.466
One of the things that you will see in the CDC's own numbers is that death from pneumonia skyrocketed during COVID.

01:13:59.486 --> 01:14:05.631
So we kind of lost control of what we had very, and I get my head out of the way again, we had could very

01:14:06.283 --> 01:14:14.947
very good control over how many people died of pneumonia until 2020 in New York City where those numbers doubled or even tripled.

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:25.152
And there's not a good explanation for that except for that it wasn't a novel virus causing the excess deaths.

01:14:25.572 --> 01:14:29.234
This is the actual graph that they should have shown you on PBS NewsHour

01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:38.339
where in blue here behind me, in the dark blue, you see between 70,000 and 50,000 people die every week in America.

01:14:38.379 --> 01:14:43.442
That's 3 million people every year or 2,700,000 people every year.

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:53.847
This is a lot more people than what they called attention to at the beginning of 2020, where, oh, a thousand people died this weekend in some place, somewhere or in total.

01:14:54.348 --> 01:14:57.890
These numbers taken out of context can be made to tell

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:06.597
virtually any story they want to, especially if people on NBC and Fox News agree to tell you the same story, which is exactly what they did.

01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:14.486
They didn't tell you that there was fear, uncertainty and doubt being created by sending doctors home and telling people that old people were in danger.

01:15:14.906 --> 01:15:18.771
They didn't tell you that the numbers of people dying of heart attack and stroke

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:29.489
and pneumonia and whatever else in New York skyrocketed because they gave out do not resuscitate orders because giving CPR to somebody might spread the virus.

01:15:29.929 --> 01:15:38.897
They didn't tell you that giving somebody supplementary oxygen for many hours in response to a low pulse ox reading

01:15:39.537 --> 01:15:43.998
can result in acute respiratory distress disorder, ARDS.

01:15:44.038 --> 01:15:53.561
You can destroy someone's lungs by just giving them pure oxygen for a few hours, which is exactly the reason why oxygen bars didn't last very long.

01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:54.822
It's not good for you.

01:15:55.282 --> 01:16:05.025
And that is also painful, which is a great way to say, well, if you have so much pain from this oxygen, maybe we should anesthetize you and put you on a ventilator.

01:16:05.922 --> 01:16:15.010
This is the runway that they got people in once they went to the hospital on FLCCC's advice that if your pulse ox is 94, you better seek help.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:21.695
And then they got pneumonia and didn't get antibiotics because antibiotics don't work for a viral pneumonia.

01:16:22.296 --> 01:16:24.237
All of these lies combined.

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:39.188
allowed them to kill any old person that walked through, any Medicare patient that walked through the doors could just be put on an alternative protocol that involved oxygen to ventilators to any number of treatments that would kill them.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.250
In the UK, they use midazolam.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.332
In America, some places use remdesivir.

01:16:43.712 --> 01:16:52.406
But you didn't need to use those things if you started with supplementary oxygen and said that any progression of symptoms was from a virus instead of from the oxygen.

01:16:52.927 --> 01:16:58.695
So then you couple that with the fact that we know that over the last four or five years that have been at least a half a million people

01:16:59.256 --> 01:17:02.078
of all age groups killed by opioids.

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:08.583
And that's the reason why we have a lower age, sorry, a lower life expectancy in America.

01:17:08.603 --> 01:17:10.985
It's not because of a mystery virus taking people out.

01:17:11.005 --> 01:17:21.093
It's because opioids and bad ideas and financial incentives to apply those bad ideas to Medicare patients has run rampant in America.

01:17:21.133 --> 01:17:25.857
And that's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread across borders and counties and

01:17:26.357 --> 01:17:30.020
and even across borders in New York State.

01:17:30.421 --> 01:17:34.964
We don't see that because the only thing that spread were these bad protocols.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:46.194
We also don't have any lawyers talking reasonably about if we just restored strict liability to all pharmaceutical products, even in the state of an emergency, this problem would go away.

01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:49.797
If we just said that the Seventh Amendment violation that is the

01:17:50.437 --> 01:18:05.550
All of these vaccine laws that include the prep act but also the national vaccine, and the IC, all of these laws that have incrementally taken away our ability to sue for damages which is what the Seventh Amendment codifies have essentially

01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:10.294
jurisdiction, it's jurisdiction stripping, we don't have any any way to go.

01:18:10.675 --> 01:18:21.106
And if we have to go through these administrative kangaroo courts, then we're giving up our constitutional rights yet somehow or another, all these lawyers for all of these organizations, they don't say any of this stuff ever.

01:18:21.526 --> 01:18:27.172
And that's because they want to, they have to cover up the fact that

01:18:28.134 --> 01:18:32.798
public health isn't saving anyone, that the National Cancer Institute isn't saving anyone.

01:18:33.138 --> 01:18:51.852
And in fact, they would murder people and lie about it in order to get us to coercively teach our children this mythology about viruses and vaccines and public health and masks and closures and everything that involves this kind of governance, they would murder and lie about it.

01:18:51.912 --> 01:18:56.316
And I would contest that they have, and we need to have a new consensus about that.

01:18:56.696 --> 01:19:00.938
Jay, look at the context.

01:19:01.479 --> 01:19:02.339
Go back if you don't mind.

01:19:02.359 --> 01:19:03.440
I want people to understand the absolute

01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:11.654
clarity of what just took place.

01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:22.943
Look at the context of the lie, how they painted the death numbers without talking about the 2.7 or 3 million deaths per year that happened in a normal, steady state world.

01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:25.085
They took it out of context.

01:19:25.385 --> 01:19:30.069
They came up with 100 different excuses, half-baked protocols.

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:35.233
Throw in the drug overdoses from the open borders.

01:19:35.593 --> 01:19:38.075
You throw in every kind of bad protocol.

01:19:38.255 --> 01:19:38.936
These lies

01:19:39.451 --> 01:19:43.388
They met 87 brand new billionaires.

01:19:44.225 --> 01:19:45.446
The world over.

01:19:45.806 --> 01:19:51.850
And I think they avoided a huge Medicare disaster that they've been talking about since the 90s.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:58.114
They eliminated the financial liabilities to the system because they overcommitted.

01:19:58.454 --> 01:19:59.635
They couldn't pay it off.

01:19:59.915 --> 01:20:01.156
They got rid of the sick.

01:20:01.476 --> 01:20:02.797
They got rid of the elderly.

01:20:03.097 --> 01:20:09.401
They got rid of financial, the social securities, the pensioners, the people that they owed all these obligations to.

01:20:10.911 --> 01:20:14.473
I think they're still doing it with the single shot, the pneumonia shot.

01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:15.053
They're doing it.

01:20:15.793 --> 01:20:17.394
My grandma didn't need any shots.

01:20:17.474 --> 01:20:18.614
My grandma lived fine.

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:19.755
This is ridiculous.

01:20:20.155 --> 01:20:23.616
They got rid of a administration they didn't like.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:25.857
They got rid of a movement they didn't like.

01:20:25.937 --> 01:20:29.498
They got rid of a class of people they owed a lot of money to.

01:20:29.898 --> 01:20:31.759
They lied their asses off to us.

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:38.282
and they minted 87 billion new billionaires and you can't sue them because they have immunity.

01:20:38.763 --> 01:20:45.986
Shut up, sit down, and if you point any of these truths out, you're a conspiracy theorist and you're anti-science.

01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:48.468
Yep, it's absolutely true.

01:20:49.546 --> 01:21:06.037
Um, if I can give you one more message while I'm still closing this street, this, uh, slide out, um, I haven't, uh, said this in the stream yet, but one of my main messages and one of the really, the thing that got me in trouble at the university of Pittsburgh was, um, that.

01:21:07.361 --> 01:21:14.208
Before the pandemic, it might not be, I don't know who your viewers are, but I assume that most of them are not professors or academic biologists.

01:21:15.369 --> 01:21:24.198
If you were working on a bench, meaning you had a lab or you worked for somebody who had a lab at a university in America, let me just go over here.

01:21:25.519 --> 01:21:43.115
if you were working for a lab in America at a university and you either had a lab or you were a postdoc or you were a grad student, at some point in time you would have used DNA or RNA and any number of techniques to put that DNA and RNA into your experiment to express a protein.

01:21:43.615 --> 01:21:50.021
Now you might have used something called a gene gun which would put the DNA around little tiny gold particles and then you might have used it

01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:57.187
to kind of shoot the DNA into a cell culture, and then the protein would express there, and then you would do your experiment.

01:21:57.587 --> 01:22:12.459
You might have used RNA and used a product called lipofectamine, where you would mix these two together, spin them in the right way, filter them out, and then put that mixture into the brain of a rat to get glow-in-the-dark proteins to show up in a particular place.

01:22:12.999 --> 01:22:17.823
The point is, is that if you go to Thermo Fisher Scientific or Sigma or

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:39.583
Well, maybe not Sigma, but if you go to Thermo Fisher Scientific or any of these other bigger biotech companies and look at their website before the pandemic or now, you will find lots of products that are generally referred to as transformation or transfection technologies.

01:22:40.183 --> 01:22:52.055
And these two words are words that, for example, would have been on many people's resume before the pandemic, including people like Tony Fauci and Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits.

01:22:52.075 --> 01:22:53.336
They all did this stuff.

01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:54.077
I did it.

01:22:54.617 --> 01:22:59.182
I used to actually transform my mice with an adenovirus-based

01:23:00.623 --> 01:23:09.446
transformation, and I would express an algae protein in the brain of my mice so that when I shine blue light on them, I could make the cells signal.

01:23:09.866 --> 01:23:11.366
So that's neither here nor there.

01:23:11.406 --> 01:23:20.769
The point is that, again, I'll repeat it, transformation is using DNA, transfection is using RNA to express a protein in an experimental setting.

01:23:21.269 --> 01:23:26.893
And these were products that have existed for more than 15 years prior to the pandemic.

01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:40.483
So when the pandemic started and then they announced on PBS NewsHour with super clown Bill Gates and a lighted table with little pieces of, of props where he was saying, you know, old vaccines are like this and new vaccines are like this.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:43.845
I immediately went to my fellow faculty members.

01:23:43.925 --> 01:23:46.067
I'm like, holy shit, they're going to transfect people.

01:23:47.486 --> 01:23:52.453
They're just planning to put some lipids and RNA in old people.

01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:54.135
That's not going to work.

01:23:54.175 --> 01:23:55.917
You can't do that.

01:23:55.977 --> 01:23:56.838
You guys know that.

01:23:56.899 --> 01:24:03.327
Like when we transfect our mice and we let them go long enough, the place that we transfected in the brain dies.

01:24:04.068 --> 01:24:06.091
It gets destroyed by the immune system.

01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:15.122
One of the cardinal issues with transfection in mice and the reason why it's such a problem, and I hope you're still following me.

01:24:15.142 --> 01:24:21.750
When I do these studies in mice, one of the reasons why you use mice is because you can do stuff with them, including

01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:37.517
take their brain out, make anatomical slices of it, and find out exactly where your needle was, so that you can see whether it was in the same place in the last mouse, and the same place in the last mouse, and that the same cells that you wanted to turn green turn green.

01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:45.662
Now, I'm telling you a very simple kind of description of experimental outcomes, but it's the way science is done.

01:24:46.022 --> 01:24:51.066
You do lots of experiments in many different animals, and you try to do the same experiment in every animal.

01:24:51.487 --> 01:25:07.600
And if you're doing an experiment where you're trying to figure out what a protein does, and so you're going to put a little extra over here to see how it changes the behavior of the animal, or see how it changes the behavior of those neurons, and you want to do it several times, then you make an anatomical

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.685
dissection of the experiment that you did.

01:25:11.165 --> 01:25:20.210
And it has been known for years, Rob, that if you wait too long, the immune system will inevitably come in and kill those cells.

01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.130
They'll be gone.

01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:29.334
And if you wait too long, that means that when you sacrifice the animal and make your slices and try to map where you did your experiment, there will be none.

01:25:31.556 --> 01:25:42.424
And so when they told us that they were going to transfect people, the very first thing that I said was, but we don't transfect healthy animals and then call them healthy animals afterward.

01:25:43.144 --> 01:25:52.251
We transfect them, we do the experiment, and then we sacrifice them quick enough so that we can still see where the transfection happened.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:56.874
How does that methodology translate to something that you could do to your grandma?

01:26:00.429 --> 01:26:04.274
They told me to go home, mail in your badge and keys.

01:26:04.494 --> 01:26:06.317
We don't feel safe with you here anymore.

01:26:08.208 --> 01:26:09.609
That's how fast this went.

01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:16.515
Jay, they weren't safe with you because of other people began to think like you thought they would lose.

01:26:16.615 --> 01:26:17.756
They would lose their money.

01:26:17.816 --> 01:26:18.797
They would lose their title.

01:26:18.817 --> 01:26:19.918
They would lose their job.

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:23.861
They wouldn't be safe in the system as constructed.

01:26:24.101 --> 01:26:26.483
So you are a threat to their way of life.

01:26:26.784 --> 01:26:28.265
That's why they had to get rid of you.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:29.386
I don't know, man.

01:26:29.426 --> 01:26:35.651
I think at that time, I think a lot of people were just scared shitless and too smart to think that they could think their way through it.

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:45.713
I think a lot of people, they were told that there are aliens, you need to stay at home, and you don't know anything about the aliens, so shut up.

01:26:46.313 --> 01:26:54.982
And a lot of these people, because that's how it works in academia, if you're humble enough to say that I don't know anything about anything except for the little thing that I work on,

01:26:55.482 --> 01:26:59.163
then usually people leave you alone and they think you're very creative.

01:26:59.604 --> 01:27:07.306
And so as long as you play flute, but don't play Jothro Tull or something like that, you just play your own little thing, I guess nobody cares.

01:27:07.766 --> 01:27:20.651
And this is really the strategy that so many of them in the reality, for example, trying to fit in at the University of Pittsburgh, which is very close by to Carnegie Mellon, there are like

01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:30.465
I think there are 134 neurobiology faculty members between Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon that kind of all share seminars and stuff like that.

01:27:30.825 --> 01:27:31.906
And it might even be more.

01:27:32.486 --> 01:27:45.393
So if you're going to fit in in a faculty that's that deep, you got to have a pretty specific little corner of the world that you work on and not be encroaching on anybody else's work with anybody else's methodologies, otherwise you're kind of redundant.

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:50.235
And so the way that academia works is you got to kind of

01:27:51.454 --> 01:28:12.269
find a way to fit in it's not it's it's uh and in so doing you also kind of subconsciously accept the idea that i should just keep my mouth shut when it comes to what other people are doing because i got i got my own stuff to care about so even if somebody's over there and you could pretty succinctly say why they're asking the wrong question or why their experiment isn't

01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:15.230
going to answer the question they say they're going to answer.

01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:19.052
They got grant money and you're too busy worrying about your grant money.

01:28:19.092 --> 01:28:25.615
So what you ought to do is try to figure out how it is that they, despite what you think is a bad idea, they got money anyway.

01:28:26.415 --> 01:28:27.675
And that's what a lot of people do.

01:28:28.196 --> 01:28:34.258
And Jonathan, from my perspective, what I just heard you describe was basically divide and conquer.

01:28:34.738 --> 01:28:35.619
Absolutely it is.

01:28:35.859 --> 01:28:38.200
And keep people as busy as possible.

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.961
In every industry, whether it's the Pentagon,

01:28:41.394 --> 01:28:54.491
Whether it's medical, whether it's banking, whether it's culture, it doesn't matter what the industry is, you put people in silos, you put them in specializations, compartmentalization, and they don't talk to each other.

01:28:54.771 --> 01:28:58.176
Now let's go back to why did they not want us to?

01:28:58.615 --> 01:29:06.058
talk to one another, congregate, go to restaurants, go to picnics, go to church, hang out together, and compare notes.

01:29:06.378 --> 01:29:07.099
Exactly.

01:29:07.239 --> 01:29:09.880
All the lies that were taking place in this pandemic.

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:18.844
You could go get an abortion or get on an airplane tube and fly somewhere, but you couldn't go to the Ace Hardware, your local diner, and have something to eat.

01:29:19.204 --> 01:29:27.988
Or you couldn't go to, because Lord knows if we started speaking with one another and comparing notes this way, the silo thing wouldn't have worked anymore.

01:29:28.428 --> 01:29:30.712
No, it was divide and conquer.

01:29:31.172 --> 01:29:38.643
So you have it shows that is evidence of evil intent at a writ large scale.

01:29:38.663 --> 01:29:44.812
Yes, that's quiet, silenced, apart, masked up, shut up.

01:29:45.578 --> 01:29:48.659
Don't ask questions, follow the rules.

01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:53.400
I would even go so far as to say that they actually want you to ask the questions.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:58.842
They want you to ask the questions they want you to ask and ask them very vigorously over and over and over again.

01:29:59.082 --> 01:30:00.762
Only the ones they want you to ask.

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.023
Exactly, exactly.

01:30:02.483 --> 01:30:05.044
Right, which is in between the 40-yard lines.

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:16.106
Right, don't go outside the 40 yard lines and ask questions about anything like the founder of the PCR test that said it ain't made to do what it's you're trying to get it to do.

01:30:16.506 --> 01:30:33.059
Yeah, the worst part about it is is that I think that the game is so diabolical as you described it between the 40 yard lines and they actually have tricked us into believing that all we really need to do is get to the touchdowns when in reality we need to get out of the stadium, get in our cars and drive away.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:42.244
And they have even set it up so that we think that we're fighting against them if we just argue that, well, we just got to score a touchdown.

01:30:42.744 --> 01:30:46.046
No, you're still playing their game.

01:30:46.226 --> 01:30:47.187
Get off their field.

01:30:47.307 --> 01:30:48.207
Get off their field.

01:30:48.247 --> 01:30:48.968
Yes, that's right.

01:30:49.688 --> 01:30:50.628
Yeah, man.

01:30:51.889 --> 01:30:57.552
John, this is the universal truths, the principles, what we're learning.

01:30:57.592 --> 01:30:58.793
Like you mentioned,

01:31:00.559 --> 01:31:05.300
The gentleman that wrote the poem about the knots and the three different types of rope.

01:31:06.021 --> 01:31:11.662
I mean, a cup is a cup made for purpose.

01:31:11.702 --> 01:31:13.122
There's a cup and a handle on it.

01:31:13.162 --> 01:31:14.443
It's made for coffee, right?

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:16.023
The coffee goes in it.

01:31:17.404 --> 01:31:18.824
The cup doesn't ask.

01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:22.452
who is the cup maker, but there has to be a cup maker.

01:31:23.133 --> 01:31:25.594
It didn't just materialize on its own accord.

01:31:25.854 --> 01:31:27.874
There's a purpose for the cup.

01:31:28.215 --> 01:31:33.617
There's a purpose for us, but we don't humble ourselves enough and ask, what is my purpose?

01:31:34.017 --> 01:31:35.117
How did I get here?

01:31:35.798 --> 01:31:43.821
You describe basically a new birth experience, meaning

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:50.752
We have to realize at some point in time, whether it's COVID or whatever happens, this world is broken.

01:31:51.112 --> 01:31:52.113
It's built by liars.

01:31:52.413 --> 01:31:53.913
It's built with alternative agendas.

01:31:54.214 --> 01:32:00.056
It's about control, about dividing, deceiving, devouring, destroying, controlling, and centralizing.

01:32:00.496 --> 01:32:02.917
And when you realize that in the eyes

01:32:03.706 --> 01:32:16.491
are open and the scales lift from our eyes, we have basically a new birth experience where we start to see with spiritual eyes instead of academic eyes, or egotistical eyes, or I'll just do it all by myself.

01:32:16.672 --> 01:32:19.393
I'm gonna lean on my own understanding, screw all this.

01:32:19.673 --> 01:32:26.976
I'm gonna brute force intellectualize myself to be a millionaire or a billionaire, and if I get more money, then I'll be happy.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.861
Well, no shit doesn't make you happy.

01:32:31.161 --> 01:32:32.742
Shit doesn't make you fulfilled.

01:32:33.242 --> 01:32:38.863
That's the, that is the law of the jungle or the law of the creator.

01:32:39.424 --> 01:32:40.204
Yeah.

01:32:40.324 --> 01:32:52.928
And yet religion is just as bad as academia is just as bad as industry is just as bad as a military industrial complex because it weaponizes it's centric.

01:32:53.088 --> 01:32:55.869
We have 47,000 denominations of Christianity.

01:32:56.601 --> 01:33:00.062
You think they came to say, hey, let's all divide up and have 19 churches.

01:33:00.082 --> 01:33:01.763
And again, then nobody talked to each other.

01:33:02.203 --> 01:33:03.423
You sell your memberships.

01:33:03.483 --> 01:33:04.724
We'll sell our memberships.

01:33:05.024 --> 01:33:11.746
The government will bless us with tax-free, you know, revenue if we keep our mouths shut and don't complain about the government.

01:33:12.146 --> 01:33:14.627
So we'll get tax deferred status.

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:18.089
We'll build these 501c3 entities.

01:33:18.729 --> 01:33:24.771
And the church has self-emulated itself into a Saturday Night Live caricature.

01:33:25.353 --> 01:33:31.482
We're all on purpose though right I think that that's the thing that I, I really believe that it doesn't.

01:33:32.544 --> 01:33:35.749
There have to still be many, many, many, many good people in.

01:33:36.693 --> 01:33:37.293
in the church.

01:33:37.353 --> 01:33:39.914
It's just that it doesn't take very many people.

01:33:39.954 --> 01:33:50.699
My analogy that I use on my slide or on my show a lot that I think is quite effective is that imagine that you have an office party and there's 40 people that you work with.

01:33:50.839 --> 01:33:52.580
And so you organize a 20 on 20 tug of war.

01:33:55.801 --> 01:33:59.103
And they're all pretty average people, all with the same job.

01:33:59.143 --> 01:34:00.664
They all are kind of athletic.

01:34:00.704 --> 01:34:01.784
And so it's a pretty equal 2020.

01:34:02.385 --> 01:34:08.148
It would only take about two people on one side to agree not to pull very hard before you could sabotage it.

01:34:08.188 --> 01:34:10.349
And the other, both teams would have no idea.

01:34:10.899 --> 01:34:11.119
Right.

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:14.280
Because everybody would be pulling hard and you would look like you're pulling hard.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:22.083
And yet every single time one team would win and you wouldn't be able to explain it because it would only take a couple people that would sabotage it.

01:34:22.103 --> 01:34:27.224
That even if you said, Oh, we're going to put big Mike over on this team and we're going to put little Wendy over there.

01:34:27.664 --> 01:34:32.206
If three people are not pulling, but pretending to that, it won't matter if you move big Mike.

01:34:33.026 --> 01:34:37.328
And that is really what happens in most churches.

01:34:37.448 --> 01:34:41.230
I think that's what happens in a lot of these anti-vax organizations.

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:56.516
You only need a few people that are taking the valuable stuff and just throwing a few out the window every once in a while before an organization will be essentially kneecapped or sabotaged or from the outside look ineffective.

01:34:57.296 --> 01:35:11.141
And so I'm trying to be very general here, but I think that the message I'm trying to make is that it's no longer possible for us to assume that the heroes on the internet are going to get the job done.

01:35:11.982 --> 01:35:18.224
It's no longer possible for us to assume that the school board is mostly good people and I can't get on it anyway.

01:35:18.304 --> 01:35:26.387
I think we all, absolutely all, need to try to find all the places where we can take control of our lives and we need to actually do it.

01:35:27.302 --> 01:35:38.197
And I think that message for young people has a foundation in trying to teach young high school age kids

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:50.842
the way to read a biology book, the way to hear the news, that when the PBS NewsHour says a new discovery was made, it should go into your head immediately, like, oh, geez, it got even more complicated than it was yesterday.

01:35:50.922 --> 01:35:55.324
Not, wow, do they understand so much, but, oh, it got even worse.

01:35:55.825 --> 01:35:58.286
And not worse in a bad way, worse in a good way.

01:35:58.306 --> 01:35:59.547
It gets more intense.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.808
It gets more beautiful.

01:36:01.609 --> 01:36:06.452
What you are surrounded with and the system that we are a part of, the creation that we were given,

01:36:07.739 --> 01:36:10.721
is more beautiful than we imagined yesterday.

01:36:10.781 --> 01:36:16.804
That's how a new biologist in my mind or a real biologist should progress.

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:29.932
And I think if we can start to get young people to think that way and young people to enter medical school that way, there could be a sort of, as you said, a collective change

01:36:30.692 --> 01:36:43.397
that a few bad apples would have a harder time overcoming because they would have this foundational understanding that wasn't so easily shakable because it wasn't based on what they last scrolled past.

01:36:43.537 --> 01:36:47.578
It will be based on something with more understanding and foundation.

01:36:47.598 --> 01:36:52.440
Like you say, knowledge is nothing unless it's also wisdom and understanding.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:57.122
And so, I don't know, I'm really excited to have been here.

01:36:57.142 --> 01:36:58.983
I'm really excited this discussion was cool.

01:36:59.043 --> 01:36:59.843
And I think that you're

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:09.604
It sounds really like to me, it's, I've been hypothesizing about this a lot with a friend of mine, Mark, that there have to be more people that are already on this message.

01:37:09.644 --> 01:37:11.485
There have to be more people that are saying this.

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:12.466
I'm not smart.

01:37:12.586 --> 01:37:15.047
I just, the truth is the truth.

01:37:15.207 --> 01:37:16.728
And so there has to be more people.

01:37:16.808 --> 01:37:19.309
And I just really happy we got to meet.

01:37:19.549 --> 01:37:20.790
I'm really happy that we did this.

01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:21.811
I hope we can do it again.

01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:23.412
I'm not trying to end the interview.

01:37:23.452 --> 01:37:26.933
I'm just trying to say that I'm running out of words and I'm handing it back to you.

01:37:27.053 --> 01:37:28.174
So you just tell me what to do.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:38.854
Well, John, I too, brother, I am so blessed to find how truth permeates and it dances between all verticals and all people and all races and all humanities.

01:37:39.374 --> 01:37:47.780
God's no respecter of title or skin color or gender or ethnicity or location or nothing.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.923
I mean, the bottom line is there's a grace to humility and with humility,

01:37:54.281 --> 01:37:55.582
Nature abhors a vacuum.

01:37:55.622 --> 01:38:07.008
If we're humble and we're curious and we want to learn and we want revelation to come through us, we open our mind to learning more instead of putting a chip on our shoulder going, I'm so smart.

01:38:09.129 --> 01:38:09.950
I know it all.

01:38:10.190 --> 01:38:13.472
I mean, hubris blocks out humility.

01:38:14.361 --> 01:38:21.645
And yet the honey and the oil and the magic and the majesty of life comes through this.

01:38:22.285 --> 01:38:23.406
We're all the same.

01:38:23.426 --> 01:38:28.668
We're all of the same essence and image and likeness and created by the same creator.

01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:33.271
Who divides us among races and religions and colors and creeds?

01:38:33.771 --> 01:38:35.812
It's those that need to control us.

01:38:36.392 --> 01:38:46.140
And so, so many kids today, there's this great gentleman I came across last week and learned about that he's given over 2,000 lectures in 2,000 different high schools.

01:38:46.801 --> 01:39:02.874
And he talks about the absolute greatness of the most industrial pioneers and thinkers and visionaries and builders and inventors from, you know, George Washington to Nikola Tesla to polio vaccine guys to you name it.

01:39:04.386 --> 01:39:06.367
But the kids aren't being taught this.

01:39:07.247 --> 01:39:18.772
And what he's teaching them is that every single one of these great, heroic, unbelievable people that were able to bring forth and reveal amazing truths is in that classroom.

01:39:19.012 --> 01:39:20.513
You're listening to me right now.

01:39:20.933 --> 01:39:22.534
Those people are you.

01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:25.372
You just don't know it yet.

01:39:25.833 --> 01:39:28.796
But what he's finding is A, they're not being taught that.

01:39:29.256 --> 01:39:30.978
So B, they don't believe it.

01:39:31.538 --> 01:39:34.882
C, they're inadequately unprepared.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:44.322
to manage themselves to go to college or to manage a life beyond college because they don't have any faith in themselves.

01:39:44.702 --> 01:40:04.626
They don't believe that they can be a George Washington or a Nikola Tesla or a scientist or whatever their calling might be because they're either too busy scrolling, they're letting the world identify them instead of finding what their true identity and purpose is,

01:40:05.581 --> 01:40:34.603
And I would have never guessed that our closing minutes in this interview would be that the utter importance of parenting, there can be no more greater valuable job on earth than to help implant values and love and meaning and purpose and identity and sovereignty and standing and laws that stand

01:40:36.201 --> 01:40:42.684
True spiritual laws are indestructible, indivisible, and immutable.

01:40:43.724 --> 01:40:51.147
And if we can teach those laws to our kids, then they will have a life well-lived.

01:40:52.147 --> 01:41:03.412
If we leave it up to Snapchat and Twitter and social media and the world and the academia to define our kids and let them figure it out on their own, we've not done a very good job as parents.

01:41:04.631 --> 01:41:05.611
No, we really haven't.

01:41:05.731 --> 01:41:31.340
And I think just to add to what you're saying, one of the other sentiments that really has our children locked up, that I'm fighting against, I mean, I don't think my kids are locked up in it, but they're very aware that other kids are, is the idea that some of these, especially it's weird, these college kids that are like 20 something years old actually think that it is within the realm of possibility that within six years the world will become completely uninhabitable.

01:41:31.441 --> 01:41:32.201
And I find that

01:41:32.961 --> 01:41:41.045
to be such a crazy level of delusion that they just understand their world so poorly, the size of it even.

01:41:41.085 --> 01:41:48.409
If you were just to fly from LA to Tokyo over the Pacific Ocean, and you've never done it before,

01:41:48.909 --> 01:41:56.674
you might go, holy balls, did I underestimate how freaking much water there is in the Pacific Ocean.

01:41:57.074 --> 01:42:04.679
And so these kids who think that 200 years of hubris is enough to destroy something as beautiful as the earth,

01:42:05.499 --> 01:42:06.219
is absurd.

01:42:06.279 --> 01:42:08.220
Yes, maybe we can make it smell bad.

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:11.182
Maybe there can be some holes that are pretty dirty.

01:42:11.242 --> 01:42:22.246
But for me, this concept that they have tricked a lot of our kids into believing it's already too late for them to do anything when in reality, the world's going to be theirs in 15 years.

01:42:23.507 --> 01:42:27.470
It is the most malevolent of lies.

01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:37.697
And that's the same lie that my brother bought into the idea that if he doesn't have kids, he's somehow slowing down the inevitable destruction of the planet.

01:42:37.757 --> 01:42:44.282
And that's as silly as saying that cows are not, that they're causing something when they're part of the earth.

01:42:44.482 --> 01:42:46.083
Cows are the earth.

01:42:46.644 --> 01:42:51.107
I don't get these arguments as a biologist, like we should...

01:42:52.799 --> 01:43:13.023
We really need to teach our children to love the world that they're into, to respect it, to appreciate it, but also to see that there are aspects of it that have been changed very drastically by our pollution, by our toxification of the environment, that things that they see in the world, that they see as people around them are not ideal.

01:43:13.683 --> 01:43:19.084
Those people that are 20 pounds overweight and haven't exercised in 20 years are not what

01:43:20.276 --> 01:43:21.899
humans are supposed to be.

01:43:21.979 --> 01:43:23.441
That's what humans are now.

01:43:23.641 --> 01:43:28.770
That's what our humans are now because of the choices that our rulers have made and lied about.

01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:30.613
And this kind of

01:43:32.125 --> 01:43:37.948
You know, we have to really empower them to feel like in a few years they're ready to take over.

01:43:38.008 --> 01:43:43.330
They're ready to take back what we were not good enough stewards of.

01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:56.897
I'm very happy to admit that somehow or another, I am part of this generation that allowed Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi to sit in their chairs for that long that none of us had

01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:01.234
None of us woke up and realized what was happening until now.

01:44:01.794 --> 01:44:03.857
Not none of us, many of us did, but I didn't.

01:44:04.317 --> 01:44:06.099
And I was part of a lot of peers that didn't.

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:10.224
I have a lot of friends who still aren't awake and think that I'm the only nutcase they know.

01:44:10.624 --> 01:44:14.769
And so this whole story actually accumulated with me.

01:44:14.789 --> 01:44:18.113
I have a piano behind me right now because I sold my guitar yesterday.

01:44:18.673 --> 01:44:23.855
And the reason why I sold my guitar is because the guy that taught me to play guitar was a roommate of mine in college.

01:44:25.416 --> 01:44:26.417
He was my best friend.

01:44:26.457 --> 01:44:31.899
He was the guy that I would call when I really needed some smart advice and somebody to tell me that I was an idiot.

01:44:32.619 --> 01:44:40.063
And in October of 2023, he was here in my house because he had to do some work as an IP lawyer in Pittsburgh.

01:44:40.703 --> 01:44:43.045
for some carpentry thing, I don't know what.

01:44:43.545 --> 01:44:45.867
Anyway, I got to share this book with him.

01:44:45.907 --> 01:44:49.130
I got to brag that I was working for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:51.832
I got to tell him that I didn't think the pandemic was real.

01:44:51.872 --> 01:44:57.876
I got to explain to him that transfection was something that they always knew was not going to work in healthy people.

01:44:58.537 --> 01:45:02.320
And I really think that the people that took the transfection are still in danger.

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.922
It's just that they probably gave a lot of placebos out.

01:45:04.962 --> 01:45:07.324
So if you didn't feel anything, it's probably because you got lucky.

01:45:07.744 --> 01:45:08.685
And he laughed.

01:45:09.534 --> 01:45:10.675
He thought it was hilarious.

01:45:11.155 --> 01:45:14.358
And he said, so you think that my, me and my family could still just drop dead.

01:45:14.378 --> 01:45:17.761
And I said, if you got a transfection and it was real, absolutely.

01:45:18.442 --> 01:45:20.003
And I am not joking to you.

01:45:20.063 --> 01:45:29.331
He left on the 20th of October and on the some day 11th or something of December, he actually had an aneurysm and died.

01:45:29.491 --> 01:45:32.454
He was able to stay to his wife that he needed to go to the hospital.

01:45:33.014 --> 01:45:37.158
And then when they got to the hospital, he was already brain dead and they said they had to let him go.

01:45:37.856 --> 01:45:52.319
So I wasn't at the funeral because nobody wanted to debate about why he died, but he definitely, I mean, people, he went home to Chicago and told a lot of people that he had visited Jay and Jay's off the deep end, not in a bad way, but Jay was always off the deep end.

01:45:52.339 --> 01:45:54.599
Jay was off the deep end with 9-11.

01:45:54.659 --> 01:45:59.720
And Jay really thinks that they did this to us and that I might be, you know, he, because that's what he heard.

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.821
I was yelling at him on my deck saying, you know, it's not funny.

01:46:02.861 --> 01:46:03.941
Don't laugh at me, dude.

01:46:04.501 --> 01:46:17.687
You think I put my reputation and my, you think I'm streaming because it's great fun to scream into a camera and ask people to donate money because you don't have a job?

01:46:18.167 --> 01:46:20.008
This is not why I'm doing this, man.

01:46:20.068 --> 01:46:23.830
I'm doing this because I think my grandkids might not exist if I don't.

01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:26.271
And he really didn't, he did, wow.

01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:27.551
I mean, are you going to keep doing it?

01:46:27.591 --> 01:46:28.772
No, I can't stop.

01:46:29.602 --> 01:46:31.223
But he's like, COVID is over.

01:46:31.283 --> 01:46:32.504
It's not over, Nate.

01:46:33.404 --> 01:46:34.985
Nate's gone now.

01:46:35.966 --> 01:46:41.149
So anyway, I'm saying I got a piano because my daughter and I are relearning piano together.

01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:55.398
I used to play and I can't play guitar anymore because it breaks my heart because Nathan left behind a wife and two beautiful daughters who are just going into college and just starting to become the amazing women that they will be.

01:46:56.218 --> 01:46:58.060
And they're not going to have their dad anymore.

01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:01.222
I can't call Nate for advice about anything.

01:47:01.282 --> 01:47:04.044
And I can't share music with him anymore.

01:47:04.605 --> 01:47:20.316
And I'm pissed because I also wasn't able to keep him from taking the transfection because at that time I was too caught up in my own, you know, Scooby-Doo mystery about this lab leak that Fauci was covering up and that Peter Daszak was responsible for.

01:47:20.717 --> 01:47:23.899
And there is no biology to support that whatsoever.

01:47:23.979 --> 01:47:24.660
And so I'm going to end

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:29.263
with this, if you don't mind, that we need a new consensus about these things.

01:47:29.763 --> 01:47:33.526
And the new consensus is, number one, what I told you before, transfection.

01:47:34.046 --> 01:47:41.051
These people at universities and medical schools that have been using this technology for more than two decades knew already

01:47:41.733 --> 01:47:48.417
that transfecting healthy elderly people that we wanted to be around for 10 more Christmases was a dumb idea.

01:47:48.857 --> 01:47:56.902
They definitely knew that transfecting young children as a new vaccine technology was ridiculous.

01:47:56.962 --> 01:47:58.122
And none of them stood up.

01:47:58.262 --> 01:47:59.103
None of them said it.

01:47:59.603 --> 01:48:05.607
Even the people that I yelled at to their face and explained why they should believe this, they fired me.

01:48:05.667 --> 01:48:11.470
Now, the reason why is because the national security state definitely would murder and lie about the fact

01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:15.875
the vaccine schedule in America was already criminal before the pandemic.

01:48:15.915 --> 01:48:17.336
And I wasn't smart enough to know it.

01:48:17.436 --> 01:48:18.057
I didn't know it.

01:48:18.477 --> 01:48:22.482
And I didn't learn it until much later, just like you guys are learning it right now.

01:48:22.962 --> 01:48:29.349
And the best way to get at the heart of this is to realize that RNA and viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:48:29.409 --> 01:48:33.253
And like Buckminster Fuller explained, life is a pattern integrity.

01:48:33.293 --> 01:48:33.434
So

01:48:33.934 --> 01:48:38.438
If it's not a pattern integrity, then there's no such thing as an RNA pandemic.

01:48:38.458 --> 01:48:39.278
So they lied to us.

01:48:39.319 --> 01:48:44.783
They murdered people and lied to us so that they could coerce us into teaching these lies to our children.

01:48:45.223 --> 01:48:50.608
And if you need any more details and have any more questions, I can come back for hours and hours and do this all over again.

01:48:50.628 --> 01:48:53.911
How's that?

01:48:54.471 --> 01:48:56.292
Brother, I salute you, my friend.

01:48:56.313 --> 01:48:58.654
I salute you for.

01:49:00.716 --> 01:49:02.818
Acknowledging that the emperor has no clothes.

01:49:04.013 --> 01:49:13.079
And it took a young kid to say that when everybody else was screaming and clapping and playing, acting and ignoring the fact that all the world's a stage.

01:49:13.119 --> 01:49:17.521
And it took some young teenage kid to go, but the King's butt ass naked.

01:49:18.022 --> 01:49:22.744
He isn't wearing anything, you know, and out of the mouth of babes comes truth.

01:49:23.285 --> 01:49:28.688
And out of the mouth of fearful, conforming people that don't know who they are comes consensus.

01:49:30.029 --> 01:49:31.870
And we're afraid.

01:49:33.805 --> 01:49:46.611
There's a reason the quantum law book more than any other thing in the world, any other script, any other teaching, any other admonition said, fear not, or be not afraid 365 times.

01:49:47.952 --> 01:50:00.878
And 40% of the book, 40% of the law book talks about the dangers and risk of materialism and worshiping money and power and status and ego and control of material and all the things that money can buy.

01:50:02.344 --> 01:50:07.417
Basically, we're taught to grow up and chase the gold, the girls and the glory, right?

01:50:08.299 --> 01:50:08.940
Ego.

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:10.264
All of it.

01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:11.309
It's all right here.

01:50:11.649 --> 01:50:15.250
All of it is right there, your bank account, your money account, we identify ourselves.

01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:17.790
Actually, Rob, it's even scarier, right?

01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:23.671
Because in the biblical days, the fame and fortune and power that they were pursuing was real.

01:50:24.231 --> 01:50:28.572
And now the fame and fortune that you pursue is actually also artificial.

01:50:28.592 --> 01:50:31.653
You have a thousand followers, it means nothing.

01:50:31.933 --> 01:50:33.173
Most of them could be fake.

01:50:33.673 --> 01:50:39.414
And so you really have this, it's layers and layers of lies that I don't think even our

01:50:40.214 --> 01:50:49.839
Even these people that were that were writing some of these scriptures couldn't have seen how bad it was going to be.

01:50:50.039 --> 01:50:53.921
Jump man 86 says something nasty to you in your post.

01:50:54.201 --> 01:50:57.303
And then a girl or a kid gets bent out of shape for four days.

01:50:57.683 --> 01:51:01.846
because Jumpman86 said something that was disrespectful to him.

01:51:02.146 --> 01:51:05.809
And they don't even know the hell who it is or if he's even a bot or not.

01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:10.171
But to your point, it's this prison of the minds.

01:51:10.612 --> 01:51:14.955
And we'll go back to where is the most valuable real estate on earth?

01:51:15.822 --> 01:51:17.382
It's this six inches right here.

01:51:17.402 --> 01:51:19.743
It's the six inches right here.

01:51:20.123 --> 01:51:31.466
And the father of lies or the thieves that want to come and steal our identity, the greatest, most valuable treasure on earth is our identity and our purpose.

01:51:31.906 --> 01:51:37.468
And if we outsource that to white lab coats or academics or bankers or status or

01:51:38.254 --> 01:51:42.557
society or culture or chasing all the things that we're not supposed to change.

01:51:43.077 --> 01:51:48.041
The old saying is, yeah, you'll never see a hearse towing a U-Haul.

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.583
You're not bringing you're not taking a ship with you.

01:51:51.984 --> 01:52:06.774
So while we're here, if we looked at things like that as tools to help us advance our purpose and love to other people, then, yeah, we may get the Bible talks about wanting us to

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.641
reign as kings and queens.

01:52:10.782 --> 01:52:29.373
Poverty usually is not associated with reigning as kings and queens, but once you get the laws and the purpose and the order and the constitution and the values correct, and then you go and you do your purpose in an abundant world, then your couple will run over 30, 70, 100 fold.

01:52:29.973 --> 01:52:31.654
Fold is a multiplication.

01:52:32.398 --> 01:52:34.679
It doesn't even talk about addition in the law book.

01:52:34.859 --> 01:52:37.420
It's not like you'll get 10 times.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:40.821
No, it's tenfold law of reciprocity.

01:52:41.142 --> 01:52:45.183
Give until it hurts, with no expectations of return.

01:52:45.623 --> 01:52:50.345
Do your purpose and love others and serve and give, and it will come back to you tenfold.

01:52:50.825 --> 01:52:51.246
How?

01:52:51.586 --> 01:52:52.126
Who knows?

01:52:52.506 --> 01:53:01.889
but it's a law and it will somehow or another next week, next month, six years from now, somehow or another, that reciprocity law will come back.

01:53:01.929 --> 01:53:02.770
It's a chemistry.

01:53:03.330 --> 01:53:07.811
It's a spiritual chemistry, if you will, that just works.

01:53:08.171 --> 01:53:21.816
And to your point, every time you learn something new in biology, instead of going, well, damn, now I'm even smarter and I'm more godlike, you should be going, oh, my God, the more I know, the more I know, I don't know.

01:53:22.688 --> 01:53:27.854
It's even more majestic than I ever knew.

01:53:27.874 --> 01:53:33.060
There must be a quantum creator even more big, like the ocean water.

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.924
You fly over to Tokyo and you go, damn, there's a lot of water.

01:53:38.005 --> 01:53:54.020
Damn, there's a lot of wisdom out there and there's enough wisdom for every human being walking this earth to find a purpose, to find a calling, to apply their talents and gifts and strengths and experience and serve selflessly

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:59.441
and then be rewarded abundantly without living in this world of scarcity.

01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:04.362
Oh, if you get more, that means I got less or we got a we're from the government.

01:54:04.402 --> 01:54:10.243
We're here to make sure everybody gets an exact even amount of everything because that's our job.

01:54:10.803 --> 01:54:11.643
Bullshit.

01:54:12.824 --> 01:54:15.784
That is not anyone's job to do that.

01:54:15.844 --> 01:54:19.365
But man, the parallels of what we're all learning, if

01:54:20.655 --> 01:54:23.857
we will humble ourselves and ask the right questions.

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:32.583
They come across medical and military and monetary and political and family and culture and arts and entertainment.

01:54:33.343 --> 01:54:40.328
It goes across every industry if we will just take our damn asses off our shoulders.

01:54:41.749 --> 01:54:42.589
Right?

01:54:42.689 --> 01:54:43.310
It is true.

01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:45.651
The opportunity is huge right now.

01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:46.672
It's right in front of us.

01:54:48.726 --> 01:54:56.134
I really think there's a possibility that they're so off script and they haven't let us know yet.

01:54:56.174 --> 01:54:59.458
So I'm really excited that you see the same thing that I hope I see.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.142
I'm hopeful, very hopeful.

01:55:06.337 --> 01:55:10.059
If you have strong faith and you anchor that faith, there are three guide wires.

01:55:10.399 --> 01:55:14.481
Think of faith as a radio antenna with three guide wires that hold that radio antenna.

01:55:14.821 --> 01:55:19.443
You know, it may be 200 feet in the air, but it's got to stay strong in the wind and the gust.

01:55:19.963 --> 01:55:31.489
And those three cables that hold faith erect and straight and strong through all the storms and day and night and weather and rain is faith, hope,

01:55:32.634 --> 01:55:35.635
and patience or patience, hope and love.

01:55:36.375 --> 01:55:38.695
And the world chips away at our patience.

01:55:38.735 --> 01:55:40.196
The world chips away at our hope.

01:55:40.596 --> 01:55:41.996
It takes our hope away from us.

01:55:42.016 --> 01:55:45.777
You just talked about kids that think in six years from now, the world's going to be gone anyway.

01:55:46.017 --> 01:55:46.737
So what the hell?

01:55:46.757 --> 01:55:52.999
Just have fun and do whatever you can get away with for six years, because I'm going to be here to pay off my debts or whatever.

01:55:53.439 --> 01:55:59.920
I'm not going to have kids because the world's going to end in 10 years or kids create climate disaster.

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:02.121
So I don't want to hurt Mother Earth.

01:56:02.631 --> 01:56:03.492
Yeah, right.

01:56:03.552 --> 01:56:04.272
I mean, come on.

01:56:05.693 --> 01:56:16.821
The world, if we know the laws that are true laws, then we can resist against those things that chip away at our hope, that chip away at our patience and chip away at our love.

01:56:17.782 --> 01:56:20.884
And if we can maintain love and hope and patience,

01:56:21.818 --> 01:56:32.061
and resist all of the fear mongering and the gurus and the group thinkers and the, you know, I'm going to put you in jail if you don't do what we tell you to.

01:56:32.121 --> 01:56:37.763
I'm going to censor you and strip your business away if you keep talking like Jonathan over there.

01:56:38.103 --> 01:56:39.604
You know, he's gone cray cray.

01:56:39.984 --> 01:56:42.285
We can't have too many Jonathans running around.

01:56:42.365 --> 01:56:42.525
So

01:56:44.907 --> 01:56:45.888
We gotta choose a lane.

01:56:46.328 --> 01:56:47.589
We all have to pick a lane.

01:56:47.649 --> 01:56:49.131
We either have a purpose or we don't.

01:56:49.171 --> 01:56:50.552
There's a creator or there's not.

01:56:50.912 --> 01:56:52.393
There's abundance or scarcity.

01:56:52.854 --> 01:56:54.475
We can live in fear or fear not.

01:56:55.136 --> 01:56:57.918
We all get to make those free will choices.

01:56:58.959 --> 01:57:01.321
Every single one of us gets to make those choices.

01:57:02.482 --> 01:57:09.008
But the problem is, is that a lot of times I think, and I'm as guilty as the rest, that we think we're making the choice here.

01:57:09.815 --> 01:57:17.022
And that if we just retweet the right person or post the right video, that we're fighting if we do that.

01:57:17.143 --> 01:57:25.671
And I, I, it's really not, we really, we really need to convert our friends and family one at a time and interact with them one at a time.

01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:27.133
We need to go back old school.

01:57:27.153 --> 01:57:32.058
Um, I know I, I'm trying to get better at, at, at that, but, um,

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:39.903
Gee, man, I don't know what to say other than I hope that we can continue to be connected and we can continue to push this ball forward.

01:57:39.943 --> 01:57:44.064
I hope your viewers enjoyed a little bit meeting me.

01:57:44.324 --> 01:57:47.826
And yeah, if you ever want to have me back again, please let me know.

01:57:48.986 --> 01:57:54.909
And how would you like my viewers to best connect with you or reach out, follow you and find you?

01:57:56.472 --> 01:58:05.096
I have a website gigaohmbiological.com which is kind of a long hard name I can put I'll link underneath this video.

01:58:05.456 --> 01:58:06.116
Okay.

01:58:06.556 --> 01:58:19.642
But yeah, it's a right now I'm my main excitement is that my kids are going back to school next Thursday and then That means Monday September or whatever that or Tuesday, whatever after Labor Day.

01:58:19.742 --> 01:58:20.762
I'm gonna start teaching

01:58:21.593 --> 01:58:25.679
a biology course and I'm going to start auditing one of my friends statistics course.

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:36.734
And so I hope to, right now what I'm doing in case your viewers are curious is I do a lot of kind of study hall type news programs where either I'm

01:58:37.555 --> 01:58:56.350
talking about what I read about certain people that I'm interested in with regard to the pandemic narrative and virology, or I'm looking at PBS NewsHour and trying to correct it, or I'm looking at some podcast and trying to show you how these two people are agreeing that a particular question is a really good one, and then I try to show people why that's a dumb question.

01:58:57.371 --> 01:59:15.833
And those are for the people that like my stuff, it's okay, but I really am going forward, I'm very interested in establishing this big idea that I put here with the biology book that I want to start teaching high school kids and kids that are about to go into university

01:59:16.754 --> 01:59:31.408
the correct way to think about the irreducible complexity that is our sacred biology, and to see all of the details that science is uncovering every day as another gear in an almost infinitely complex watch.

01:59:31.969 --> 01:59:36.053
And every time we find a gear we should be excited about the fact that there's a new bird,

01:59:36.893 --> 01:59:45.756
There's a new bird species with new colors and a new thing to look for, but that doesn't mean we understand much about where they're coming from and how they do what they're doing.

01:59:46.216 --> 01:59:59.860
And we can humble ourselves to that and it can become an appreciation that drives our and motivates our science instead of a sort of dominance or a sort of power that motivates our science.

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:05.462
And once we start asking questions that way, and we start pursuing our own health and wellbeing that way,

02:00:06.062 --> 02:00:21.778
then the arrogance with which public health seems to be able to currently demand from parents the vaccine schedule and demand from parents the way that they behave, new parents will approach parenthood with this already preconceived notion that

02:00:22.478 --> 02:00:27.160
There is an irreducible complexity that is about to manifest in my newborn baby.

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:35.763
And this person who doesn't appreciate that sacred complexity can't give me any useful advice about the first 5 years of my kid's life.

02:00:35.823 --> 02:00:37.304
And so that's okay.

02:00:38.084 --> 02:00:50.974
instead of having to feel like you've seen an alien and that opinion is very crazy, I think we can very quickly pivot to a young generation of parents that just understands that that's the way it is.

02:00:51.514 --> 02:01:04.905
These people went to a school that taught them to think about the irreducible complexity in a way that was beneficial to the biosecurity state, beneficial to our governance, beneficial to pharma, beneficial to

02:01:07.207 --> 02:01:10.310
a movement that wants to turn us into experimental animals.

02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:18.637
And so we can change that by teaching our kids to see it for what it is, so that every time they see it on TV, it's just what they see.

02:01:18.697 --> 02:01:25.864
Instead of seeing a really smart person using big words, they see a magician casting a spell, and that's what we need.

02:01:26.364 --> 02:01:27.926
Hey to the man, brother.

02:01:28.675 --> 02:01:30.096
I don't even want to add anything to it.

02:01:30.136 --> 02:01:31.918
That was so beautiful and so brilliant.

02:01:32.499 --> 02:01:33.860
Johnathan, thank you, my friend.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.644
I cannot wait to see you in Tulsa at the Red Pill Expo.

02:01:38.684 --> 02:01:40.486
I'll be there talking.

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.086
Can't wait.

02:01:41.487 --> 02:01:47.492
Me and you and G. Edward Griffin got to have a photo and a book signing, all that kind of good stuff.

02:01:47.572 --> 02:01:48.373
I just I love it.

02:01:48.553 --> 02:01:48.933
I love it.

02:01:49.334 --> 02:01:50.054
I love it, man.

02:01:50.315 --> 02:01:50.775
Thank you.

02:01:50.855 --> 02:01:51.255
Thank you.

02:01:51.315 --> 02:01:52.096
Thank you, my friend.

02:01:52.436 --> 02:01:53.297
You're very welcome, Rob.

02:01:53.337 --> 02:01:54.098
Thank you for having me.

02:01:54.438 --> 02:01:54.819
Thank you.

02:01:54.899 --> 02:01:55.239
Take care.

02:02:01.957 --> 02:02:03.442
Give me just a second.

02:02:03.483 --> 02:02:04.506
Look at that.

02:02:06.493 --> 02:02:07.497
It usually uploads.
