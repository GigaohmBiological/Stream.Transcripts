WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
We welcome you back to the third day of hearings in Red Deer, Alberta, the National

00:11.160 --> 00:13.480
Citizens' Inquiry.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.560
Our next guest is Jay Kuey.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.720
Jay, can you hear me?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.840
I can, yes, sir.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.800
And thank you for joining us today.

00:21.800 --> 00:26.000
I'd like to start by asking you to state your full name for the record, spelling your

00:26.000 --> 00:28.800
first and last name.

00:28.800 --> 00:36.960
My name is Jonathan Kuey, J-O-N-A-T-H-A-N, last name Kuey, C-O-U-E-Y.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.880
And Jay, do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

00:40.880 --> 00:42.360
so help you God?

00:42.360 --> 00:43.640
I do.

00:43.640 --> 00:50.880
Now my understanding is you can be described as an academic neurobiologist, and you've

00:50.880 --> 00:55.600
been doing that for about 20 years before the pandemic.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
That's correct.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.960
I lost my position as an academic biologist as a result of taking a stand against the

01:01.960 --> 01:04.800
transfection and masking in 2020.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
Right.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.520
You went against the narrative and lost your teaching position at the School of Medicine

01:10.520 --> 01:11.880
at Pittsburgh University.

01:11.880 --> 01:17.520
Yeah, I was a research assistant professor, which means I was in the lab all the time.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.720
I taught only as an extra side thing.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
Right.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.720
Okay.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.320
I'm teaching immunology and biology.

01:26.320 --> 01:33.160
Yes, just online, and I consult for a couple of people as well to make a little extra on

01:33.160 --> 01:34.160
the side.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
Yep.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
Okay.

01:36.160 --> 01:43.680
We've entered your CV as Exhibit RE11, and you've been invited here today because you've

01:43.680 --> 01:49.480
got a hypothesis to speak of, and my understanding is you have a presentation, so I'm just going

01:49.480 --> 01:55.640
to invite you to launch into your presentation and share with us your hypotheses.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.400
Thank you very much.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.160
I'm really pleased to hear previous witnesses pointing out so clearly that the principle

02:02.160 --> 02:06.120
of informed consent has been ignored for the duration of the pandemic.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.760
I want to point out that the last witness was very good at pointing out that you need

02:10.760 --> 02:12.800
to be able to say no.

02:12.800 --> 02:19.200
You do not have the possibility of exercising informed consent if no is not an option.

02:19.280 --> 02:25.520
And the principle of informed consent from the perspective of me as a biologist, it requires

02:25.520 --> 02:27.840
that you understand.

02:27.840 --> 02:35.000
And I would argue that you can't really understand the coronavirus pandemic given the biology

02:35.000 --> 02:40.720
that we have been provided with over the last three years on television and social media.

02:40.720 --> 02:47.240
And because of the lack of the proper understanding of this biology across our medical communities

02:47.280 --> 02:53.440
in America and Canada and all over the world, doctors aren't even able to enable people

02:53.440 --> 02:58.600
to exercise informed consent because they themselves don't have the requisite knowledge.

02:58.600 --> 03:04.280
So these are the two topics I'd like to cover quickly tonight and then open for questions.

03:04.280 --> 03:09.880
The endemic hypothesis and infectious clones defined.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.480
I would like to put everybody on the same page by first just stating something that I

03:15.480 --> 03:19.040
want to justify through the rest of this talk.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.680
The TV algorithms and the NIH and CDC and all of these organizations like the who have

03:25.680 --> 03:32.240
convinced us that coronaviruses are a source of pandemic potential and that this pandemic

03:32.240 --> 03:38.440
potential can be accessed through cell culture passage with a relatively benign virus being

03:38.520 --> 03:42.400
turned into a pandemic potential virus.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.480
There's also the idea that you can passage it in animals and make it from a relatively

03:47.480 --> 03:51.120
safe virus to one that is pandemic potential.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.880
And the latest addition to this mythology is the idea that clever scientists can stitch

03:56.880 --> 03:59.760
together the right combination of genes.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.760
And then these viruses can circle the globe for three years and do what we call pandemic.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.160
I believe that this mythology has been created over the last 20 or more years, especially

04:10.160 --> 04:17.600
with regard to coronavirus with the idea of us having to surrender our individual sovereignty

04:17.600 --> 04:22.800
and a global inversion from freedom to some kind of fascism where you must have permission

04:22.800 --> 04:24.400
to do everything.

04:24.400 --> 04:30.000
This mythology, I'm going to argue in this talk is wholly unsupported by what we know

04:30.000 --> 04:37.920
about RNA versus DNA replication possibilities and also just the behavior of these entities

04:37.920 --> 04:42.720
that we are now calling RNA viruses in this talk.

04:42.720 --> 04:49.400
Not coronavirus, we're just saying RNA viruses so we make that distinction.

04:49.400 --> 04:54.240
So to put everybody on the same page, I just want to get everybody aware of where the endemic

04:54.240 --> 04:59.920
hypothesis fits in, Tony Fauci would have you to believe that in 2018 above my head

04:59.920 --> 05:05.600
there was no coronavirus 2019 in September at some point, a coronavirus was released

05:05.600 --> 05:12.400
in Wuhan and something like the fuse of a firecracker, it went around the earth and

05:12.400 --> 05:17.880
spread in many different directions, eventually became alpha, beta, delta, and eventually

05:17.880 --> 05:22.920
omicron in South America, South Africa, which then took over the globe.

05:22.920 --> 05:29.520
And now we are on some ancestral version, our next ancestor of, or descendant of rather,

05:29.520 --> 05:31.160
of omicron.

05:31.160 --> 05:37.600
In this model, the earth remains green because there were no health problems before the pandemic

05:37.600 --> 05:42.520
and no health problems were caused by the lockdowns, the protocols of the vaccines.

05:42.520 --> 05:46.440
Without those changes, many more millions of people would have died.

05:46.440 --> 05:52.120
In this scenario, we have defeated epidemics in the past with vaccination.

05:52.120 --> 05:57.920
National coronaviruses can jump from species and go around the world, they can pandemic.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.960
False positives are rare because PCR is good and specific and variants are evidence of

06:03.960 --> 06:07.800
both spread and the continued evolution of a single pathogen.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.560
We spend money studying viruses using gain of function research.

06:11.560 --> 06:16.000
This is the basic TV narrative on one side.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.280
And the what they would like you to fight about really is whether or not it was a natural

06:20.280 --> 06:25.760
virus that just happened to fall out of a cave and get on to a train and a plane or

06:25.760 --> 06:31.120
if it was a mistake made in a laboratory by some very arrogant scientist who either took

06:31.120 --> 06:38.920
a lot of virus out of the wild and then infected his local town or a city or that they even

06:38.920 --> 06:42.760
worse made something in a laboratory that otherwise wouldn't have existed.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.640
But again, green earth, there are no health problems.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.760
And then the pandemic comes along and here we are.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.920
Same difference.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.840
The virus spreads, it changes to Omicron, it takes over the world and now we're at a

06:56.840 --> 07:01.880
new version of Omicron taking over the planet.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.720
In this scenario, again, the lockdowns don't have to have heard anyone, vaccines can have

07:05.720 --> 07:12.400
saved lives, the protocols were the best they could do and the same thing holds true for

07:12.400 --> 07:14.560
all of these things.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.360
We use vaccination to defeat epidemics in the past, novel coronaviruses can jump from

07:20.360 --> 07:26.440
the wild, PCR works great, variants are evidence of spread, and we spend money on gain of

07:26.440 --> 07:27.760
function research.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.800
You can tweak this one a little bit if you want and say that the lockdowns and the EUAs

07:32.800 --> 07:39.120
caused some excess deaths, but the majority of people still died from a virus.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.560
And so there are many different ways to tweak this narrative.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.880
Another way that this narrative has been tweaked is that there are no viruses at all,

07:47.880 --> 07:53.360
that measles doesn't exist, that there was never a coronavirus, that everything is a lie.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.800
This is of course not very, it's not very acknowledging of what we know of all of the

07:59.800 --> 08:07.320
molecular biological techniques and the synthetic viruses and clones that they can make.

08:07.320 --> 08:13.600
So there are these entities and we have studied them for a long time and I think this scenario

08:13.600 --> 08:17.160
is one of those traps, so you have three traps here.

08:17.160 --> 08:22.920
You have a natural virus, you have a lab leak virus and you have absolutely no viruses at

08:22.920 --> 08:24.800
all.

08:24.800 --> 08:33.560
And none of those three encompass the true biology that we knew already for basically the duration

08:33.560 --> 08:35.240
of modern medicine.

08:35.240 --> 08:40.560
If you go before the pandemic into a medical textbook and look up coronaviruses, they will

08:40.560 --> 08:48.480
tell you that between 25 and 35% of all respiratory disease without a known cause is thought to

08:48.480 --> 08:54.840
be caused by coronaviruses, of which there may be up to 200 varieties which circulate

08:54.840 --> 08:57.200
in humans.

08:57.200 --> 09:04.400
And now instead of this being the baseline, we start with a baseline where there are coronaviruses.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.320
And then in 2019, it doesn't even matter.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.960
Was there a release?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.320
Was it a natural one?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.640
Did a few people get sick in Wuhan?

09:13.640 --> 09:20.120
It doesn't matter because the PCR can't differentiate between any of these coronaviruses.

09:20.120 --> 09:26.000
This is the illusion that they've placed on you because all they needed to do was accentuate

09:26.000 --> 09:32.880
different coronaviruses found in the background and claim a phylogenetic progression.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.600
It means wizardry, but it is one of the only ways in which this molecular signal will

09:38.600 --> 09:41.280
be shared so beautifully.

09:41.280 --> 09:47.360
The lockdown's protocols, vaccines account for the total excess deaths in the pandemic.

09:47.360 --> 09:55.760
There nothing unusual happened until we stopped treating respiratory disease the usual way.

09:55.760 --> 10:01.400
The interesting thing about this endemic background hypothesis is, is that the PCR's

10:01.400 --> 10:06.720
are not having false positives in the way that you think all the time.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.880
Yes, you can overcycle a PCR test.

10:10.880 --> 10:17.240
But if the background is hot for homologous genes from endemic coronaviruses, that they

10:17.240 --> 10:20.080
are pretending are not there.

10:20.080 --> 10:25.360
You have a situation where a vast majority of the good positives are still picking up

10:25.360 --> 10:31.000
background coronavirus and not whatever they purport to have been released.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.440
Now, Jay, can I just interrupt you just to make sure that people understand what you're

10:34.440 --> 10:40.320
saying is what you're saying is, is there are a number of coronaviruses that we just

10:40.320 --> 10:47.200
live with and have lived with all our lives and that the PCR test is not specific to what

10:47.200 --> 10:50.200
governments call COVID-19.

10:50.200 --> 10:56.640
The PCR test is just testing for genetics that are already in this background of coronaviruses

10:56.640 --> 10:57.640
that we live with.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.160
Is that what you're saying?

10:59.160 --> 11:08.040
I'm saying that yes, that that is the scientific literature at this stage, the ability to pinpoint

11:08.040 --> 11:14.880
a particular coronavirus is not a level of fidelity that they had before the pandemic.

11:14.880 --> 11:20.200
And there's no reason to believe from looking at any of the PCR tests and the primers that

11:20.200 --> 11:26.120
they've put forward, that they've come up with a unique and highly specific PCR test

11:26.120 --> 11:31.840
that can differentiate between one coronavirus and the hundreds of others that are in the

11:31.840 --> 11:32.840
background and rare.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
Okay.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.840
So sorry for interrupting.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.000
I just thought that was important for people to understand.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Absolutely.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It's not a problem at all.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Additional harms were also caused by the response of including the lockdown, including

11:43.000 --> 11:46.440
use of specific agents like Madaz Lam and Ramdesivir.

11:46.440 --> 11:55.800
The point of this theory is to show and this hypothesis is to remind everyone that your

11:55.800 --> 12:01.000
gut feeling that the PCR test was one of the primary ways that the hood was pulled over

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
our eyes.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You are absolutely correct.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.840
And the one trick that they still have up their sleeve is the idea that there was a novel

12:10.840 --> 12:17.240
virus for which you had no previous immunity, even in the worst case scenario here.

12:17.240 --> 12:22.720
Where there is a release from a laboratory, you still would have had previous T cell and

12:22.720 --> 12:28.560
B cell immunity from previous coronaviruses because of the homology between these genes

12:28.560 --> 12:31.800
had a great chance of overlapping.

12:31.800 --> 12:38.640
And so the concept of this being a novel virus is also canceled out in this hypothesis.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.440
It's not possible.

12:40.440 --> 12:46.120
And people were making that argument in 2020 from March on and they were just ignored.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.200
Mike Yeiden is one of them.

12:48.200 --> 12:54.880
So if we move forward then, let's think about how this could be possible.

12:54.880 --> 13:01.800
In the United States, the total number of deaths is in sky blue here behind my head.

13:01.800 --> 13:06.360
And the number of pneumonia deaths is in light blue down here in the bottom and I hope

13:06.360 --> 13:08.480
you can see this arrow.

13:08.480 --> 13:13.040
The very yellow at the bottom here are identified flu virus deaths.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.320
And so what you see here at this part is the beginning of the pandemic.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.760
This is 2014 to the pandemic.

13:21.760 --> 13:28.240
And what you see is although year on year seems like we got pneumonia under control.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.800
Remember ladies and gentlemen, these are pneumonia deaths.

13:32.800 --> 13:37.320
Many, many, many more people get pneumonia, but don't die.

13:37.320 --> 13:46.200
And then suddenly after 2014, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20, what do I mean, what?

13:46.200 --> 13:52.160
Up to three times as many people in the United States started dying of pneumonia in a way

13:52.160 --> 13:55.720
that they've never done before.

13:55.720 --> 14:05.520
And that is a number of deaths which correlates precisely with any possible, any possible excess

14:05.520 --> 14:06.520
deaths.

14:06.520 --> 14:14.080
It is extraordinary really that this correlation is so high and people have still, still ignored

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
it.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.320
And I know everybody here is familiar with Denny Rancor's work and he has done an excellent

14:19.320 --> 14:25.000
job of dissecting how the all-cause mortality in America was organized in different places

14:25.000 --> 14:26.920
around different times.

14:26.920 --> 14:32.480
And John Bodman is another researcher in the United States who's done excellent work correlating

14:32.480 --> 14:38.320
these new causes of death and what happened during the beginning of the pandemic was simply

14:38.320 --> 14:42.920
a mismanagement of respiratory disease in hospitals.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.360
And it's been done with one particular methodology, right?

14:47.360 --> 14:53.680
They said there was a dangerous novel virus, it could be detected by a PCR test.

14:53.680 --> 15:00.480
And they correlated that PCR test with detrimental health protocols where they took away antibiotics

15:00.480 --> 15:04.040
from people who probably should have just had antibiotics.

15:04.040 --> 15:12.000
They didn't allow people to be treated with repurposed drugs and instead insisted on remdesivir.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.320
They ventilated people to prevent spread.

15:15.320 --> 15:21.800
And these detrimental health protocols were encouraged by giving hospitals $35,000 a patient

15:21.800 --> 15:23.800
that got on a vent.

15:23.800 --> 15:28.120
That enabled a larger portion of all-cause mortality than PNI, that's pneumonia and

15:28.200 --> 15:32.840
influenza, to be prioritized as a national security threat.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.080
That's what you're referring to.

15:34.080 --> 15:39.920
Your previous speakers are referring to when they say that this is a military operation.

15:39.920 --> 15:46.280
This was identified as a national security threat caused by a novel virus.

15:46.280 --> 15:52.960
Therefore, we could execute a plan that we had and it is still in motion.

15:52.960 --> 15:57.280
My argument would be that if you need a molecular signature which would have seeded

15:57.280 --> 16:03.320
this event around the world, it could not have been a point release of a coronavirus

16:03.320 --> 16:07.280
because its genetic signature would have changed sufficiently in different directions around

16:07.280 --> 16:13.960
the world so that none of this uniformity in variants could have ever occurred.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.720
And yet somehow or another, we are told this story of a clean progression of variants

16:18.720 --> 16:23.840
around the world sweeping, sweeping, sweeping in these waves and colors.

16:23.840 --> 16:30.080
There's no precedence, none, zero precedence in biology for any phenomenon of an RNA virus

16:30.080 --> 16:32.280
to do such a thing.

16:32.280 --> 16:37.080
And yet without any questioning at all, we just took it.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.200
And I'm saying to you now that I think the only way this could have happened is if they

16:41.200 --> 16:46.880
purposefully planted these molecular signatures in the places that they were going to blame

16:46.880 --> 16:52.560
and call part of the pandemic because a natural coronavirus swarm cannot do this.

16:52.560 --> 16:59.000
And then the goal again is to a total surrender of individual sovereignty and removing these

16:59.000 --> 17:01.040
basic human rights granted permissions.

17:01.040 --> 17:05.960
The way that they did it with four basic ideas, they did it by changing the way you think

17:05.960 --> 17:10.240
about respiratory disease, we just got through saying that there used to be hundreds of causes

17:10.240 --> 17:12.480
of respiratory disease.

17:12.800 --> 17:18.320
And now we have all basically saying it's either not that one or it's that one.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.600
They also changed how we think about all cause mortality.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.960
That's why I show you that picture with the blue and the blue because in America, we never

17:24.960 --> 17:27.040
saw the light blue.

17:27.040 --> 17:31.720
Nobody ever looked at all cause mortality and said, okay, let's put this in perspective.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.000
We're in America.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.560
Three million people die every year.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.040
Nobody said that.

17:38.040 --> 17:42.920
Nobody told us that every week between 50 and 70,000 Americans die.

17:42.920 --> 17:49.240
So when they say that, wow, a thousand people died of COVID, it sure sounds crazy.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.400
Then they changed how we think about our immune response to disease.

17:52.400 --> 17:57.280
This was very diabolical because it was part of the way that they sold us on the shot.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.640
Antibodies are what you need.

17:58.640 --> 18:04.720
They had to change the way you think about your immune response to a respiratory disease.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.640
And then they changed the way they think about vaccination so that you don't question

18:09.640 --> 18:13.000
the applicability of transfection for immunization.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.280
That's what these are.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.200
These are transfections.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.280
Everybody should be calling them that because this technology has been around for more than

18:20.280 --> 18:25.360
two decades and it's never been called anything else.

18:25.360 --> 18:30.800
That's why I originally got in trouble with my job and lost got too much attention was

18:30.800 --> 18:37.240
because of speaking out about transfection because I used it on mice for many, many years.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.480
So after they changed their mind about these four basic biological principles, they were

18:41.480 --> 18:44.120
able to ventilate people to prevent spread.

18:44.120 --> 18:48.400
They used remdesivair and medazolam to kill old people and young.

18:48.400 --> 18:53.480
They untreated bacterial pneumonia went up by at least three to four times, shutting

18:53.480 --> 18:59.120
down schools, masking children, and social distancing, even people who were married for

18:59.160 --> 19:03.280
50 years and let them die apart.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.960
And at the same time in Scientific American, the who just recently in March put out an

19:07.960 --> 19:14.760
article which stated, of course, masks, I mean, sorry, mRNA vaccines are safe, powerful,

19:14.760 --> 19:15.760
and effective.

19:15.760 --> 19:22.360
Those are exact words, masks work, indoor air quality matters, wastewater tracking is useful.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.560
And genomic surveillance is key.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.160
They are doing exactly what they planned.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.120
They are going in exactly the direction that they planned to go.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.200
So they haven't wavered at all.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.920
So how can we get them to?

19:36.920 --> 19:43.360
How can I help you rather to understand this endemic hypothesis and what it really means?

19:43.360 --> 19:47.200
Think you got to understand the infectious cycle and the infectious clone and what it

19:47.200 --> 19:48.200
is.

19:48.200 --> 19:52.160
So that's what we're going to do here and then I'll be done.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.960
The infectious cycle is depicted in this cartoon here.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.120
They have a viral particle.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.360
It binds to its receptor.

20:00.360 --> 20:06.720
It comes into the cell and releases its RNA and then the RNA needs to get translated into

20:06.720 --> 20:13.560
proteins and then those proteins start copying the RNA into different segments.

20:13.560 --> 20:19.680
And then this long genomic RNA gets packaged into new viruses and those new viruses go

20:19.680 --> 20:23.280
out into the wild to infect other people.

20:23.280 --> 20:29.680
We've seen lots of versions of this cartoon in all of the news programs.

20:29.680 --> 20:35.920
You may have even seen a cartoon where they show you in three dimensions, the RNA and

20:35.920 --> 20:43.080
the end protein and the imagination of the viral particle and the formation of the full

20:43.080 --> 20:46.280
variant inside of an endosome.

20:46.280 --> 20:50.600
But this is a lot of hand waving in terms of what they know about what happens here and

20:50.600 --> 20:56.040
they know about what the fidelity of this is all hand waving because up until now these

20:56.040 --> 20:57.840
are RNA viruses.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.600
The only way to look at them is to use reverse transcriptase to turn them into DNA and then

21:02.600 --> 21:04.520
do PCR.

21:04.520 --> 21:09.160
And once you do that, you really only find what you're looking for because your PCR is

21:09.160 --> 21:12.360
pulling up things that are specific for the primers.

21:12.360 --> 21:16.600
So if you don't choose the primers correctly, you're not going to see everything that's

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
here.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.360
So up until this stage, it's pretty hard for them to say, you know, what are these viruses

21:22.360 --> 21:24.240
that get produced look like?

21:24.240 --> 21:27.280
How many of them are they, how uniform are they?

21:27.280 --> 21:32.880
What is the genetic variation between the particle that you get infected with and the

21:32.880 --> 21:41.040
particles that get produced by supposedly the hundreds or the thousands during infection?

21:41.040 --> 21:45.880
And so if I simplify this a little bit, the TV and Fauci has told you that you get infected

21:45.880 --> 21:51.280
with the coronavirus, the coronavirus goes into your lungs, it makes copies of itself.

21:51.280 --> 21:55.080
And if it makes too many copies of itself, you start coughing those out on people around

21:55.080 --> 21:59.360
you and then they also get sick from the variant that you're sick with.

21:59.360 --> 22:03.240
That's why all these virions are yellow.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.760
The question is, why do they have so much trouble culturing these viruses?

22:06.760 --> 22:09.840
You're going to hear a lot of people say, well, they don't have trouble culturing, but

22:09.840 --> 22:15.120
they do have to use a 96 well plate and they look for psychopathic effects and they might

22:15.120 --> 22:19.600
find it in two wells and then they call that a viral isolate.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.760
They can do a PCR test on that, maybe find an E protein, well, see now there's definitely

22:23.760 --> 22:25.880
a coronavirus there.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.600
That's the isolate, that's culturing.

22:28.600 --> 22:32.960
It's not like growing mushrooms and then you grow some more and give them to your friends

22:32.960 --> 22:37.960
so they can grow them or give them a tomato cutting or say give them a couple breeding

22:37.960 --> 22:42.640
pair of mice so that they can have the same mice that your laboratory invented.

22:42.640 --> 22:48.280
If you find a novel coronavirus, the only thing you can do to share it with somebody

22:48.280 --> 22:53.200
is to give them the sequence because you can never grow enough coronavirus from a magic

22:53.200 --> 23:00.400
bat swab to let's say divide it between four labs and let them do their thing with it.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.680
That's not how RNA viruses work.

23:03.680 --> 23:10.880
Unfortunately, not very many virologists are adequately informed of the limitations of

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
their work.

23:11.880 --> 23:18.640
A lot of them are not adequately informed about how this is a particular limitation in coronavirus.

23:18.640 --> 23:24.680
The reason why this is is because a large majority, if not the vast majority of the

23:24.680 --> 23:34.440
particles that are produced during a coronavirus infection are in fact replication incompetent.

23:34.440 --> 23:40.560
What that means is they have a mistake, they're missing genes, their genome did not get completely

23:40.560 --> 23:46.440
run but it still got packaged and so even though they look like a virus, when they bind

23:46.440 --> 23:51.960
to the next cell and release their contents in there, those contents won't have all the

23:51.960 --> 23:58.200
doodads and gazoos ready to go, all the genes present in order to make copies of itself.

23:58.200 --> 24:03.880
Therefore, in the cartoon above my head, it now becomes more obvious why it's difficult

24:03.880 --> 24:09.400
to culture coronaviruses because not all the particles that you detect that might be

24:09.400 --> 24:13.600
PCR positive for an end protein are going to be infectious.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.200
Now, you might think who words you learn that?

24:17.200 --> 24:23.160
In most cases, a large fraction, if not the majority of the virus particles that are produced

24:23.160 --> 24:25.160
are defective.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.760
Then I get it produces viruses, but in most cases, a large fraction, if not the majority

24:30.760 --> 24:36.480
of the virus particles that are produced are defective, then I get for anything.

24:36.480 --> 24:42.120
So I learned it from Robert Malone, but once you know this, you can go back into the literature

24:42.120 --> 24:49.160
before 2020, before they were trying to obfuscate all this lack of fidelity and you can see

24:49.160 --> 24:50.960
them plainly complain about it.

24:50.960 --> 24:58.760
In fact, describe looking for coronaviruses using pan-coronavirus, PCR primers because

24:58.760 --> 25:04.400
it's very, very difficult to find a particular coronavirus.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.440
And so the people that have known this, everybody knows this, but this all started way back

25:08.440 --> 25:14.040
in the 80s with Vincent Rancid Yellow and David Baltimore because they did this technique

25:14.040 --> 25:16.160
with the folio virus.

25:16.160 --> 25:22.960
But since then, almost everybody that works on coronaviruses, from coronaviruses in plants,

25:22.960 --> 25:29.160
in salmon, in mice, it doesn't matter.

25:29.160 --> 25:34.640
They never start with a wild sample that they went deep into the forest to get.

25:34.640 --> 25:39.480
They start with a sample that they cloned.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.600
So what does that mean?

25:41.600 --> 25:52.680
Well, as I explained, the wild virus here depicted as a cassette tape is lacking fidelity

25:52.680 --> 25:58.640
because DNA versus RNA, basically you can copy DNA because it's double stranded.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.960
You can also check and proofread it.

26:00.960 --> 26:06.320
And there are a whole host of secondary enzymes that are very good optimized at doing that.

26:06.320 --> 26:12.360
With RNA, because it's single stranded, although it is purported that there is proofreading

26:12.360 --> 26:18.680
in coronaviruses, the biology of coronaviruses requires them to be able to have a certain

26:18.680 --> 26:19.680
mutation rate.

26:19.680 --> 26:26.360
And even more, it requires a regular recombination rate because of the subgenomic RNA production.

26:26.360 --> 26:33.200
Therefore, there is a great fraction because of errors in recombination, because of shortened

26:33.200 --> 26:39.480
genomes, which are called defective genomes when in other viruses, where you get essentially

26:39.480 --> 26:45.400
a large portion that are replication incompetent.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.520
But when you use PCR to sequence this group of viruses that you might find in a bat, you

26:50.520 --> 26:58.320
can get a consensus sequence, and that consensus sequence can be translated into DNA.

26:58.320 --> 27:03.680
And you can think of that as a CD, and you can make lots of copies of a CD because CDs

27:03.680 --> 27:05.560
are digital.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.920
And DNA can kind of be thought of high fidelity like that.

27:08.920 --> 27:14.800
You know, one in a million bases is a mistake, maybe even less than that.

27:14.800 --> 27:22.240
And so if you use bacteria, you can actually make a bunch of this CD.

27:22.240 --> 27:27.240
You can make a bunch of this CD in a bacterial culture, and keep in mind, this is exactly

27:27.240 --> 27:31.440
how they make the RNA for the shot.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.720
They make a circular DNA.

27:33.720 --> 27:40.680
It encodes the spike protein RNA, and they make lots of copies of that DNA in a bacterial

27:40.680 --> 27:46.920
culture, and then they add an RNA polymerase, and that produces the genomic RNA, or for

27:46.920 --> 27:50.720
the shot, it would produce the spike RNA.

27:50.720 --> 27:56.600
And that spike RNA that needs to be separated from that plasmid DNA before they injected

27:56.600 --> 28:00.760
in your kids, but apparently they didn't do that very well.

28:00.760 --> 28:08.200
Now this process here, very similar, you use circular DNAs to encompass the entire genome

28:08.200 --> 28:10.200
of the coronavirus.

28:10.200 --> 28:16.480
You add RNA polymerase to make lots of RNA copies of that same clone.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.920
One sequence, that's it.

28:18.920 --> 28:24.680
It's not going to be perfect, but let's say the RNA polymerase is pretty good.

28:24.680 --> 28:29.440
So you know, most of these are going to be fairly long transcripts, and they're all going

28:29.440 --> 28:33.040
to be the transcript that you built out of this DNA.

28:33.040 --> 28:38.880
Then you take that and you use electricity, or a centrifuge, or any other number of ways.

28:38.880 --> 28:43.840
You take that pure genomic RNA for that virus, and you put it in a cell culture, and then

28:43.840 --> 28:48.240
what that cell culture makes will make animals sick.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.800
What that cell culture makes will cause cytopathic effects, and you can do plaque assays and

28:52.800 --> 28:54.760
all that stuff.

28:54.760 --> 28:59.520
But you can always send the DNA, you can always send the DNA to your friends.

28:59.520 --> 29:05.040
You can put the DNA in the freezer, you can print the DNA, you can order it from companies.

29:05.040 --> 29:10.160
You can order these five plasmids from companies, and they'll print them right up, and then

29:10.160 --> 29:15.200
you put them in your bacteria and grow as many liters as you want, and then convert that

29:15.200 --> 29:21.000
liters to as much RNA as you care to make over and over again.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.720
This is gain of function, not the mixing and matching, not going into bad caves.

29:26.720 --> 29:34.640
It's making pure versions of what they detect in the wild using PCR and sequencing.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.400
This is how they get around it.

29:36.400 --> 29:44.000
This is how RNA virology is done, and especially coronavirus biology, and Ralph Barrack's lab

29:44.000 --> 29:48.960
is famous for the techniques that are necessary to assemble these long genomes and produce

29:48.960 --> 29:54.360
infectious clones that can be used in laboratories.

29:54.360 --> 29:59.040
So the point is, is that if we could do that, right, we can look at this, we can ask ourselves

29:59.040 --> 30:01.120
what kind of viruses are produced.

30:01.120 --> 30:06.480
Can we look at that infectious versus non-infectious, can we look at that fraction and see it up

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
until now?

30:07.480 --> 30:13.440
It's been very hard because we use PCR, which means we have to convert these RNAs to DNAs,

30:13.440 --> 30:20.280
and then we have to amplify them up, and then all the fractions and all of the relationships

30:20.280 --> 30:28.400
between which was more abundant is lost.

30:28.400 --> 30:34.040
So they have recently come up with a way of doing it where they can sequence the RNA

30:34.040 --> 30:39.760
directly, which means that they can just look at, well, are you going to take all the viruses

30:39.760 --> 30:45.640
that are supposed to be in this culture, and we're going to dump them through a nanopore,

30:45.640 --> 30:49.800
and we're going to see how many of these different RNAs we find.

30:49.800 --> 30:56.960
So in a virus, when the virus makes copies of itself, it makes copies of the whole genome,

30:57.400 --> 31:04.720
which is 30,000 bases long, but it also makes skip copies with a leader sequence that then

31:04.720 --> 31:13.000
skip down to these TRSB sequences and make what is called subgenomic RNA, and these subgenomic

31:13.000 --> 31:21.960
RNAs turn out to be several orders of magnitude more abundant than the genomic RNA, which should

31:22.040 --> 31:30.560
be the RNA that gets packaged in the new viruses and sent out to infect other cells.

31:30.560 --> 31:40.640
So if we use a clone of SARS-CoV-2, and we put it in a cell culture and we watch it replicate,

31:40.640 --> 31:49.640
what we see is 400 to 600,000 copies of the end protein, I think I got one more click here.

31:50.640 --> 31:55.560
No, I don't. So I'm going back, sorry about that. I thought this zoomed in a little bit,

31:55.560 --> 31:59.840
but it doesn't. So here you can see on this map, they're doing coverage of the genome here on the

31:59.840 --> 32:03.200
bottom. You don't have to look at these two on the bottom. I should have covered these up.

32:03.200 --> 32:10.440
We're just looking at this 1B-B figure right here. This is the genome on the bottom,

32:10.440 --> 32:19.120
nucleotide zero to 30,000. And as this black line rises, they find more sequences of this part

32:19.120 --> 32:27.040
of the genome. And so it's way down here at under 1,000 over here. And it starts to rise,

32:27.040 --> 32:34.960
the S protein is above 50,000. And then we get up to 200,000 with the E and the M. And then we

32:34.960 --> 32:44.560
get up above 400 to 600,000 with the end protein. So 600,000 copies of the subgenomic RNA for the

32:44.560 --> 32:52.480
end protein. And how many copies of the full genome did they find? The longest tags correspond

32:52.480 --> 33:03.760
to the full length genomic RNA, and they found 111. 111 whole genomes, and about 600,000 copies

33:03.760 --> 33:12.400
of the end protein, and thousands of copies of these other subgenomic RNAs. So interestingly,

33:12.800 --> 33:18.480
this is this breakdown where you have hundreds of thousands of these subgenomic RNAs and only a

33:18.480 --> 33:25.280
handful of whole genomes that are supposed to be the new infectious virus that you've been

33:25.280 --> 33:33.200
culturing. This has been known for decades. Ever since they've been able to isolate the RNA

33:33.200 --> 33:40.800
from a picture like this, or purporting to isolate the RNA, corresponding to a picture like this,

33:40.800 --> 33:47.520
when they try to isolate these viruses here, they don't find a pure, you know, these are all

33:47.520 --> 33:52.400
really long genomes that we sort through them and sequence there's never been an experiment done

33:52.400 --> 34:00.240
like that. When they do this, they find this crazy ratio of almost no genomes, and thousands

34:00.240 --> 34:08.160
and thousands of copies of these partial subgenomic RNAs. Now, the argument that the virologist will

34:08.160 --> 34:14.080
make is that you need a lot more N protein and S protein and M protein in order to package

34:14.080 --> 34:21.840
new virus. And so that's why you need hundreds of thousands of those RNAs and only a handful

34:21.840 --> 34:29.520
of the full genome. But that still doesn't jive with the known amount of not infectious particles

34:29.520 --> 34:36.080
that the right side of virology often will acknowledge. So again, if you look at this,

34:36.080 --> 34:44.720
and you think about what's really being packaged here, they have none experimental evidence that

34:44.720 --> 34:49.680
it's only full genomes being packaged and in fact by the abundance of the RNA,

34:49.680 --> 34:54.960
by what they found in all previous experiments, it's very likely that the vast majority of the

34:54.960 --> 35:02.080
particles that are produced are having incomplete genomes, if not even subgenomic RNA. So just to

35:02.160 --> 35:07.840
be sure, you don't think I'm crazy right before the pandemic, they did this with a human coronavirus

35:07.840 --> 35:14.480
called 229E. They made a clone of it. They grew it in a cell culture. They did exactly the same

35:14.480 --> 35:21.280
measurement. Here's the entire genome on the bottom. Here's 10 to the fourth, 10 to the fifth of N

35:22.400 --> 35:26.640
protein, and then all the way down here, if you look at the last figure of the paper, you find

35:26.720 --> 35:36.080
that they found two whole genomes in that clone, two. So we're not getting thousands of viral

35:36.080 --> 35:41.360
particles being produced when we when we do these culture experiments. And I think coronavirus

35:41.360 --> 35:46.320
people have known this for some time, and they just kind of hand wave it, because here's a paper

35:46.320 --> 35:54.480
from 2001, where you can see the full genome is barely a ghost. And the N protein and the E protein

35:54.480 --> 36:01.840
and the S, these guys are gigantic overexposed plots. So they've known that this ratio occurs

36:01.840 --> 36:06.960
no matter how they set up these clones, no matter how they do it, they know that these partial genomes

36:06.960 --> 36:12.800
get packaged since before the eighties and nineties they've been looking at the replication and

36:12.800 --> 36:19.840
packaging of coronavirus infectious bronchitis, defective RNAs. It's essentially how come there's

36:19.840 --> 36:26.560
so many of these, these viruses that just have like junk or, or partial, what we thought were

36:26.560 --> 36:32.160
the genome of these, that's because that's the way this works. That's the best fidelity that these

36:32.160 --> 36:38.480
things are able to serve from our own cells machinery. Here's a paper from 2023,

36:39.280 --> 36:45.760
acknowledging the generation and functional analysis of defective viral genomes during SARS-CoV-2

36:45.760 --> 36:51.360
infection. Those are not infectious particles. And if you read this paper here, right here in

36:51.360 --> 36:56.960
the importance, defective viral genomes are generated ubiquitously in many RNA viruses,

36:56.960 --> 37:03.840
including SARS-CoV-2, their interference activity to full length viruses, and interferon stimulation

37:03.840 --> 37:09.920
provide potential for them to be used in novel antiviral therapies and vaccines. This has been

37:10.000 --> 37:14.480
known for some time in flu, although the flu field seems to like to ignore this.

37:16.640 --> 37:24.160
So infectious clones defined is simply put that RNA viruses are tricky. They've been very hard to

37:24.160 --> 37:30.080
understand and study because they are often only observable as what is an indirect shadow of a

37:30.080 --> 37:39.760
genetic signature found through reverse transcriptase PCOM. And that ability, or lack of ability,

37:39.840 --> 37:45.120
lack of fidelity has opened this door for people to say that, look, they haven't isolated the virus.

37:45.680 --> 37:51.360
The isolation doesn't work. These experiments are nonsense. Therefore, there are no viruses at all.

37:52.560 --> 37:58.480
And this is a very, very dangerous place for us to be. We need to wake up and realize that we've

37:58.480 --> 38:03.360
never really understood coronaviruses with the fidelity portrayed on television. We've never

38:03.360 --> 38:08.480
been able to tractably manipulate them in the lab the way it's been portrayed on television.

38:08.560 --> 38:14.080
And they certainly do not travel the globe in the fidelity that has been travel portrayed on

38:14.080 --> 38:18.640
television. So has it actually been cultured just to address this quick before we stop?

38:19.760 --> 38:27.040
Let's look at this paper. This paper actually became famous because a correlation between

38:27.040 --> 38:35.200
3,790 quantitative polymerase chain reaction positive samples and positive cell cultures.

38:36.080 --> 38:44.800
It says here that up to the end of May, 3,790 of these samples reported on a positive nasopharyngeal

38:44.800 --> 38:51.200
samples were inoculated and managed for culture as previously described. Interesting. Let's go

38:51.200 --> 38:57.920
to where they're previously described. This is the paper that they previously described it in.

38:57.920 --> 39:03.360
You can see that they're almost all the same authors just in different order. A total of 183

39:03.920 --> 39:11.760
samples tested positive by RTPCR, including nine sputum samples, 174 nasopharyngeal swabs

39:11.760 --> 39:20.000
from 1,155 patients were inoculated in cell cultures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in patient samples

39:21.600 --> 39:30.880
was assessed by real-time PCR targeting the EG. Not the S, not the RNA dependent RNA polymerase,

39:30.880 --> 39:37.840
not the N protein, the EG. That's it. So listen carefully. This is culturing coronavirus at the

39:37.840 --> 39:47.920
beginning of the pandemic and showing 3,000 positives. All patients, 500 microliters of that swab fluid

39:48.480 --> 39:55.120
or sputum were passed through a .22 micrometer pore filter that's to remove bacteria.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.640
And then were inoculated in four wells of 96 well-culture microplates containing

40:02.640 --> 40:13.520
zero-six eses, zero-E6 cells. After centrifugation, that's to get the stuff to go into the cell culture.

40:14.480 --> 40:24.080
After centrifugation at 4,000 Gs, microplates were incubated at 37 degrees. They were observed daily

40:24.080 --> 40:30.720
for evidence of cytopathogenic effect. Two subcultures were performed weekly. That means every

40:30.720 --> 40:36.240
week they split them. So they moved the whatever was growing. They moved it into a new fresh

40:37.920 --> 40:46.400
well with cells next to it. Two subcultures weekly presumptive detection of virus in supernatant

40:47.040 --> 40:53.520
showing cytopathic effect was done in a scanning electron microscope. No images shown.

40:54.880 --> 41:01.120
So if there was cytopathic effect, they assumed that there was a virus and they put it under the

41:01.120 --> 41:06.320
microscope to see. But they didn't show you anything. And they don't tell you how many of those they

41:06.320 --> 41:13.520
found anything in. There's no data from that. And then confirmed by specific PCR targeting the E gene.

41:15.440 --> 41:23.360
It's a loop. Don't you see? It's just a loop. I tested positive for an E gene. Then they made

41:23.440 --> 41:30.480
me cough into a dish. And then if any of those cells died, they said, wow, that's pretty cool.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.800
That's a coronavirus because he tested positive for the E gene.

41:38.720 --> 41:44.960
Now they tested again in that culture and find the E gene again. The E gene is not proof of a

41:44.960 --> 41:51.040
coronavirus. The E gene doesn't prove that a coronavirus caused the cytopathic effects. These

41:51.120 --> 41:57.840
are the objections that the no-virus people bring to the table. And these objections are very solid

41:57.840 --> 42:04.560
for a vast majority of these papers during the pandemic. It is just an insufficient level

42:05.280 --> 42:14.160
of scrutiny. It's an inefficient, insufficient level of control. And it is a giant pile of

42:14.160 --> 42:18.000
assumption that is instead, interestingly enough, in this paper,

42:18.960 --> 42:24.640
confusing people by saying hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective at shortening

42:24.640 --> 42:33.600
the duration of this read. And so this is another aspect of the immunomethology. You've got to be

42:33.600 --> 42:40.640
very careful of so many of these repurposed drugs were given in combination with other drugs.

42:40.640 --> 42:48.160
And then over and over sold as the drug. For example, this paper was pushed as evidence that

42:48.160 --> 42:53.280
hydroxychloroquine could work without acknowledging that azithromycin is given with it.

42:57.360 --> 43:02.880
The games that they have been playing are many. If we go back to before the pandemic to a guy like

43:02.880 --> 43:10.800
Mark von Rontz, who was the flu commissioner for Belgium for the 2009 flu and got his own

43:10.800 --> 43:16.640
infectious disease lab where he works on testing for coronavirus. Here he is arguing why we need

43:16.640 --> 43:22.880
coronaviruses can't be found without using pan-coronavirus primers. He's got a whole book

43:23.600 --> 43:30.080
chapter about how pan-coronavirus RT PCR assay for detection of all known. This is how they did it.

43:31.040 --> 43:35.040
It's not specific, ladies and gentlemen, and these people have known that.

43:36.480 --> 43:43.280
And so they tell you these stories about these imperfect genetic ghosts in the wild that have

43:43.280 --> 43:51.280
potential to become permanent circulating pathogens. They talk about how if you let the wrong guy,

43:51.280 --> 43:59.280
like Peter Desac, into the wrong Batcave, he can passage those viruses in cell culture and pull out

43:59.360 --> 44:06.160
pandemic potential on the other side. They might also do it with ferrets someday, or worse yet,

44:06.160 --> 44:10.320
somebody like Ralph Barrick will stitch a bunch of things together that should have never been there

44:10.960 --> 44:18.640
and and will have a pandemic. In reality, the only potential danger that could be used and

44:18.640 --> 44:27.280
weaponized against us is the production of RNA viruses using DNA clones. That is the danger.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.680
That is the reason why they don't ever talk about it. They talk about gain of function

44:32.320 --> 44:37.680
as a way of make sure that you don't understand that that's not the danger. There was never a

44:37.680 --> 44:45.440
danger from coronavirus. Coronaviruses were always largely if they are part of this

44:46.160 --> 44:52.880
causes of respiratory disease yearly, then they are part of a very benign set of some things that

44:52.880 --> 44:59.040
float around. They are not part of this at never ending source of pandemic potential. So this is

44:59.040 --> 45:06.320
what I think they did. They declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus, or which the PCR was

45:06.320 --> 45:13.440
not specific. And yet they applied a unique and mostly detrimental protocol for respiratory

45:13.440 --> 45:19.360
disease to those people that tested positive. And they enforced that with financial incentives.

45:19.360 --> 45:25.280
This was all part of a military plan in the United States, which was ready to be executed

45:25.840 --> 45:30.800
when the excuse was given and the excuse was given when these protocols were changed.

45:31.520 --> 45:36.400
It could have been an infectious clone. You could have used a clone to see the same sequence in

45:36.400 --> 45:44.240
Iran and Wuhan and in Italy. And that unique and identical sequence around the world would have

45:44.240 --> 45:50.640
been a molecular selling point for their have being an ongoing pandemic. And if it was required

45:51.360 --> 46:00.240
in order to fool these governments in in Europe and in in Italy and like Italy is not Europe. But

46:00.240 --> 46:07.040
to fool these governments around the world, if that was required, a clone of a wild coronavirus

46:07.040 --> 46:13.280
would have been more than sufficient for us to have seeded these things and then let the plan

46:14.640 --> 46:18.160
roll on forward with just using this a specific PCR test.

46:19.840 --> 46:24.480
Again, I want to plug Denny Rancor's data because it's so important to understand

46:25.200 --> 46:31.360
how if there was a novel respiratory disease for which no one had any immunity, then there

46:31.360 --> 46:37.120
would have been a predicted impact on all cause mortality and those predicted impacts were not

46:37.120 --> 46:45.200
seen at all. And his analysis is is fantastic. And then finally, I just want to make sure I

46:45.200 --> 46:49.760
remind you one more time that nobody should be using transfection. I was so excited to hear

46:49.760 --> 46:55.760
someone say that earlier today. There's no debate. It should not be used in healthy humans. And up

46:55.760 --> 47:01.920
until the pandemic, it was only used on people who were likely going to die anyway. So please

47:01.920 --> 47:06.320
stop transfection because they want to eliminate the control group. Once everybody's been transfected

47:06.320 --> 47:13.440
a few times, all of these ailments, all of these increases in illness and auto immunity will all

47:13.440 --> 47:19.520
just blend into a background of increasing public health problems rather than being able to be

47:19.520 --> 47:25.360
identified as, wow, the people who have triple transfected themselves are having worse and

47:25.360 --> 47:31.200
worse outcomes a year on year, which I think is the truth that has already emerged and can only

47:31.200 --> 47:36.080
emerge in greater and greater numbers as we move forward. Thank you for your patience.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.960
I hope that was okay. That's the end of my presentation.

47:40.960 --> 47:45.600
Jay, that was really interesting. Now, I'm just hoping to clarify a couple of things with you

47:45.600 --> 47:52.160
and ask you something new. So you use the term transfection, which for most of us is a new term.

47:53.040 --> 48:04.560
We think of mRNA technology, but that's a new term for transfection. So you're saying

48:04.560 --> 48:10.800
transfection instead of mRNA vaccine because transfection is the correct term.

48:12.240 --> 48:19.040
Yes, that's correct. So if I can add to that a little bit, for the academic bench biologist,

48:19.040 --> 48:23.600
that means somebody that plays with mice or monkeys in a laboratory and they want to

48:24.240 --> 48:30.560
change the local protein expression, upregulate it, downregulate it, maybe even knock down a gene,

48:31.200 --> 48:35.920
there are ways that that's done and that's ways that's been done for about 20 years.

48:35.920 --> 48:42.320
One way to do it is to use an adenovirus where you put the DNA of interest in coding the protein

48:42.320 --> 48:47.440
that you want to express in that adenovirus and you put that adenovirus in the brain of the mouse

48:47.520 --> 48:54.720
and it will go where it's going to go and express that protein. Using DNA to express protein in a

48:54.720 --> 49:02.560
cell is called transformation. And if you use mRNA to do the same thing, you can use electricity

49:02.560 --> 49:09.760
to put the mRNA in, you can use lipids like they're doing now. Sometimes people use gold particles.

49:11.040 --> 49:14.880
There's lots of different ways to do it, but regardless of how you do it,

49:15.760 --> 49:21.120
you use mRNA. It's called transfection. If you use DNA, it's called transformation.

49:21.120 --> 49:27.520
And so if you go on the website of sigma or thermal fissure and you just look for transfection

49:27.520 --> 49:34.880
products, they'll have a whole webpage on it. And there's no difference between the mRNA shots that

49:34.880 --> 49:40.560
they're giving and any previous transfection technology except for maybe the proprietary bubble

49:40.640 --> 49:47.040
that they put it in. But it's the same technique with the same lack of tissue specificity and dose

49:47.040 --> 49:51.360
control that they've never been able to replicate in any other application of it.

49:52.160 --> 49:58.560
Now you've said that we shouldn't use transfection in humans and can you explain,

49:58.560 --> 50:06.240
give you reasons why we should not use transfection or as most of us know, mRNA technology in humans?

50:07.120 --> 50:15.120
The proof is in the use. So in a laboratory animal, for example,

50:16.480 --> 50:22.000
in your using transfection, you're inevitably going to get autoimmunity. Animals that are

50:22.000 --> 50:27.600
transfected are not intended to live long, healthy lives. They're always sacrificed and then

50:28.560 --> 50:35.680
their tissue is used to look at the changes that you made. And so up until very recently,

50:35.680 --> 50:41.120
I don't think anybody's really thought about this as a very viable technique except to use for

50:41.120 --> 50:46.240
somebody who's already going to die from like cancer or something like that. And the trick is

50:46.240 --> 50:52.480
to realize, and I think that this is a very true statement, although I'm, I, this is more of a

50:52.480 --> 50:56.640
gut feeling to me, but it's a gut feeling that a lot of other people have had for a long time.

50:56.640 --> 51:03.920
It doesn't matter really. If you express a particular toxic protein, it doesn't have to be the spike.

51:05.680 --> 51:12.000
If you've expressed a foreign protein in your cells and it's random cells in your body,

51:12.000 --> 51:18.400
your immune system only can do one thing. It can unleash the neutrophils, destroy those cells,

51:18.400 --> 51:24.240
and clean them up. Now, if those are your heart cells, it's permanent damage. If it's endothelial

51:24.240 --> 51:33.200
cells, you have endothelial damage. If it's ovary cells, you have ovary damage. And this is a known

51:34.160 --> 51:41.920
downside of transfection. You don't, it's just a, it's a blunt tool. It's been used for a long time

51:41.920 --> 51:47.680
in academic medicine. And for 20 years, people have been dreaming about making it into a viable

51:47.680 --> 51:55.200
therapeutic methodology, but they've never even come close to getting it to work in, in single

51:55.200 --> 52:01.600
examples, nevermind on a scale of billions. And there is no other conclusion to come to

52:02.160 --> 52:09.840
that if you want to treat, or beneficially, and a mammalian like a human that you want to live

52:09.840 --> 52:18.720
for 20 more years, transfection is not a therapeutic option. And anybody that has sold it as such

52:19.840 --> 52:30.800
has either been telling us allies or has been just really wrong. It's, it's not to be done.

52:31.600 --> 52:36.240
There's just, there, it doesn't, it's not fit for purpose. They would like you to believe that

52:36.240 --> 52:42.400
it is, but you could not, you cannot all usefully augment someone's immune system

52:42.400 --> 52:48.000
by transfecting foreign proteins randomly in their, in their body. It's just ridiculous.

52:48.560 --> 52:56.560
Okay. And, and your opinion on that is based on animal study after animal study after animal

52:57.520 --> 53:04.800
study and some use in a very small subset of humans who are, you know, terminal with cancer

53:04.800 --> 53:11.280
and things like that. Yeah. And also very, very anecdotal personal experience. I can tell you

53:11.280 --> 53:21.360
one, three second story. I was asked to help do a experiment in squirrel monkeys where they

53:21.360 --> 53:27.680
wanted to express a algae protein. It's a long story about why they would do that, but they

53:27.680 --> 53:32.480
wanted to express this protein in the brain of the monkey so that they could manipulate

53:33.760 --> 53:42.240
some circuitry and then go back to that brain region afterward and see what neurons they

53:42.240 --> 53:46.160
manipulated and see how they were connected anatomically. And maybe that was going to be a good idea.

53:46.880 --> 53:53.600
But when we started this experiment, I suggested to these primate, primate neuroscientists that

53:53.600 --> 54:00.320
look, when we transfect a mouse, I've got a window of like, let's say three to four weeks

54:00.320 --> 54:04.880
where I can do my experiment and everything is okay. But if I wait any longer than that,

54:04.880 --> 54:09.920
the place where I, I initiated the transfection starts to have problems and starts to,

54:10.640 --> 54:16.080
to have an immune reaction, which leads to a lot of neuronal death. So I tried to tell these,

54:16.720 --> 54:21.280
these, these primate, primate scientists that like, if we do this experiment, we got to do it

54:21.280 --> 54:26.160
on an animal that you're all done with, and that's already scheduled to be sacrificed,

54:26.160 --> 54:31.520
because otherwise, you might just lesion that area of the brain in four months, and then

54:32.560 --> 54:37.760
you won't even know what you did. Well, what did they do? Monkeys are expensive,

54:37.760 --> 54:42.000
so you can't just sacrifice them. So they let this experiment run, I think for,

54:44.720 --> 54:49.040
I think they let it run for 12, but it might even have been 18 weeks. And then when we did the

54:49.040 --> 54:55.040
anatomy and we cut into that area, almost all the neurons were gone. And that's because again,

54:55.760 --> 55:01.600
transfecting neurons and getting them to express foreign proteins is eventually a challenge that

55:01.600 --> 55:07.200
your immune system can't ignore. And that is true no matter where transfection is done.

55:07.920 --> 55:15.680
And, and, and in any current application of it, it should be an expected outcome. And it,

55:17.120 --> 55:23.200
so that, yes, it's not fit for purpose. Right. Now, I wanted to go back, you've,

55:23.200 --> 55:30.560
you've made the point, and I think it's important for people to understand, is coronaviruses are part of

55:31.440 --> 55:37.200
just basically the environment that we live in. There's, there's a number, there's hundreds and

55:37.200 --> 55:43.680
hundreds of coronaviruses. And, and so many that the conventional wisdom is, is that what did you

55:43.680 --> 55:51.760
say 20 or 30% of our, you know, flu's, annual flu's are considered to be caused by one or

55:51.760 --> 55:58.000
another of these hundreds of coronaviruses. That's, I've got that right. Yes, correct.

55:58.000 --> 56:06.000
So what my question is, is this started with just a bang in the media in, in early 2020,

56:06.000 --> 56:13.600
and all of a sudden we seem to be using a PCR test for a specific coronavirus that we're

56:13.600 --> 56:22.720
told is, you know, SARS-COVID-2 or named COVID-19. Is it possible that there was a specific PCR test

56:23.280 --> 56:31.680
for a specific new virus at that time? It's not, I don't think that it is,

56:32.400 --> 56:41.840
it is possible for them to have had the fidelity to use the, the PCR's that they designed were not

56:41.840 --> 56:48.640
designed, cannot be designed to be, to be specific the way that they were designed.

56:48.720 --> 56:53.760
As far as I understand, for example, in, in Canada, after talking to Dr. David Spector,

56:54.400 --> 57:01.360
they didn't have nested primers for your PCR, which means that, that any overlap on the PCR

57:01.360 --> 57:06.400
sequences or partial overlap would likely result in amplification, which again, makes them

57:06.400 --> 57:13.120
a specific for the genes that they're amplifying. And because this was a national security issue,

57:13.760 --> 57:19.920
the, the goal would not have been to be as specific as possible. But of course, as you guys know in

57:19.920 --> 57:28.640
Canada, to rope in all possible suspected cases. And so again, the more specific the test would be,

57:29.200 --> 57:35.520
I think the less appropriate it would be for the national security threat. So there's motivation

57:35.600 --> 57:42.400
for them to have not made a specific test. And more importantly, the background and,

57:42.400 --> 57:47.760
and lack of fidelity means that they could not have made a, a such a specific test.

57:50.320 --> 57:57.040
So the technology of the, the PCR, um, would it be your opinion then that they were basically

57:57.040 --> 58:04.800
that PCR test would just be identifying a family of coronaviruses? At best, at best. And again,

58:04.800 --> 58:11.280
remember, it's only identifying small fractions of the genome being present,

58:11.280 --> 58:17.200
which does not in any way shape or form indicate infectivity or even the presence of a contiguous

58:17.200 --> 58:22.880
virus, but just the presence of these genes, which are homologous across lots of coronaviruses. So

58:23.920 --> 58:30.400
it's, it's a very, very different lack of fidelity relative to what is portrayed.

58:30.480 --> 58:36.000
So, you know, if we had a, a multivitamin with, you know, a hundred different vitamins in it,

58:36.000 --> 58:40.960
this is really a test for one vitamin and then pretending that there's a multivite there.

58:45.440 --> 58:50.240
Just using an analogy that maybe people might understand, right? So think about that.

58:51.600 --> 58:56.640
It's a bit more like saying that there's a, that not telling anybody that there are any

58:56.720 --> 59:02.240
automobiles in the world and then saying, oh, there's a pandemic of Kia's and if we just test,

59:02.240 --> 59:08.240
we can, lots of people end up having Kia's and it's like, wow, that's pretty crazy. And then,

59:08.240 --> 59:15.120
oh, yeah, look, now we have, uh, Toyotas and now we have Hondas and as we change the,

59:15.120 --> 59:19.920
what we're identifying with the test, it seems like, wow, it's spreading all around the world,

59:19.920 --> 59:24.880
but those cars have always been there. And so in this case, they told us, I guess that there's an

59:24.880 --> 59:33.120
epidemic of, of Teslas, which can be tested for, by looking for wheels and a, and four doors

59:33.840 --> 59:39.760
and a windshield. And so when people tested their garage, they go, wow, I guess I got a Tesla too.

59:40.880 --> 59:47.280
And, and it's probably closer to something like that, where the specificity is implied

59:47.920 --> 59:54.160
when in reality, they're testing for things that all automobiles have. And so there is no pandemic

59:54.160 --> 59:59.280
of a particular kind of automobile. It's just that the test is confirming everybody's got a car

59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.880
or there are a lot of cars around. So just, just so that we're, we're clear. So if there,

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:13.040
if the test is nonspecific and even if, I mean, because it's just testing for a part that isn't

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:19.360
even, that is, it doesn't even tell us we have a whole genome, conceivably, then they could just

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.920
come up with another virus name, start running a bunch of PCR tests and convince us that we're

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.080
in the pandemic again. Absolutely, absolutely. I think this is the one you should almost assume

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.600
that's what's going to happen. That's their plan. That's what PCR has been established as they can.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:45.760
That's what the who said in that article that I shared, genetics or genomic surveillance is a

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.360
good way of following these things. So they would like to sequence the sewer all the time. They

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.600
would like to, yeah, they would like to swab you monthly if they could. That's what they want,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.960
definitely. Right. But it's really just a tempt us in the teapot. It's a phantom.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.280
I mean, think of it this way, like rhinoviruses are a virus that we all know are very common,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.360
part of the common cold bouquet. And we're not sequencing and doing PCR for rhinoviruses right

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.840
now, but they could. And as soon as they rolled those tests out and people that were asymptomatic

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.200
and then cycled them too far, you'd get a lot of false positives right away. And if they told you

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.640
it was one rhinovirus, instead of a specific for many, they could also convince you that,

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.680
look, it's changing. So it's very tricky game they've played on us.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.800
Right. Now, do you have any information we've heard about people taking antibody tests?

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.760
For SARS-CoV-2. And do you have any information on whether or not those are realistic tests,

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.040
or whether to use your term, they would have high fidelity?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.000
I think they're probably, if done correctly, they're actually probably very good at identifying

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.760
people with previous immunity. And recent exposure, it's tricky, right? Because they,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:18.320
I think, use the antibody test as a way of emphasizing the seroprevalence to this

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.280
pike protein. So they get to choose what they search for when they say that they're going to

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.040
build this antibody test. If they were going to be honest with it, we would look at this papers

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:36.400
that we looked at today. And we see that the N gene or the N RNA is produced in the most abundance.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.400
So the loudest signal to look for, if you were going to see as someone recently exposed to a

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:49.440
coronavirus would be that N protein. But there's almost no tests can find the N protein,

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.800
epitope immune response in people that are vaccinated. Because they don't have a natural

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.880
response to the virus anymore, which would be to respond to the RNA that gets produced the most,

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.160
and the protein that gets produced the most, they are responding to the protein that they

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:17.040
were forced to respond to. And that, that illusion was partially seeded by the idea of saying,

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.120
here's an antibody test for the spike protein, it can show you if you've been infected. And so

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.760
people got it in their head that, oh, the spike protein antibodies that tell if I'm infected,

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.800
when in reality, you'll have T cells to the RNA, dependent RNA polymerase,

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:39.680
and T cells to the N protein, and B cells to the N protein, all from overlapping previous

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.480
infections. So you could have tested positive before the pandemic too, because you had natural

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.320
immunity, you were exposed. So I guess to refine my question, I mean, I'm just wondering if it's

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.840
possible that there's an antibody test specific to what we're called as, you know,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:07.040
COVID-19 or SARS COVID-2, as opposed to a antibody test, really for just this background

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.440
group of coronaviruses. I think we're really, where I think you and I would be buying in

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:22.640
to their simplified biology if we said that there was a SARS COVID-2 to separate from

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:30.240
all of these other viruses. No, it is. It's just interesting because I live in the drug approval

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:37.520
world regulation part. And for the, in Canada, we didn't have an emergency order that government

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.440
came out with, rather, we don't have an emergency pathway that they could use. We hear in the U.S.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:50.720
this emergency approval. So we had an interim order that didn't define a specific virus. So

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:58.240
they defined COVID-19 as relating to something that was not a specific virus. And that's,

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.760
that got me very suspicious about our ability to identify a specific virus.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:12.240
I mean, much of the literature supporting this, this panoply of viruses that's circulating in the

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:18.720
wild, if you look through this literature before the pandemic, you will find that entire papers are

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:26.320
written about the diversity of coronaviruses in bad caves by looking for a 296 base length

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:33.760
part of the RNA, dependent RNA polymerase. And if they find it, well, that's a, that's a, that's a

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.560
coronavirus. They find another one, that's a coronavirus. And we find all these and then we

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:45.520
make a little chart of how they're related. And this is a phylogenetic tree of bad coronaviruses.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:54.880
No spike proteins, no, no full sequences, and no viruses cultured. Just genetic sequences

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.280
found using pan coronavirus primers for the RNA, dependent RNA polymerase.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:09.760
And so to go from a, go from a literature, which is so amorphous to now we can definitively tell

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.640
you that this is the sequence and this is you positive or negative, all this stuff is just,

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.520
it's smoking mirrors. They do not have that fidelity.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.800
Thank you. Those are my questions. I'll ask if the commissioners have some questions for you.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:33.120
Thank you, Dr. Khoi for this very interesting presentation. I mean, you certainly did a lot of

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.880
effort to make it somewhat accessible for a lay person because, I mean, what you're

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.280
discussing is fairly complex. I have a background in virology and I, I develop

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.640
anovirus vaccine and all kinds of things. So I understand what you're coming from.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:59.120
But there's a few questions that popped in my mind. Do you have experience growing viruses,

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.120
either small scale or large scale, or different type of viruses in your lab?

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.560
I only have had the privilege of working with somebody who does it for me. So no, I've never,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.920
I've never enriched adenovirus, for example, or anything like that. It's stuff that,

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.960
that I take for granted that, that has been commercial, commercially available since,

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.680
I guess since I had my first lab. So for me, I take a lot of things, especially with adenovirus

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.240
production and, and the transformation experiments that I've done. I just take it as very commercially

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.520
accepted that adenovirus can be made and it can be packaged with the DNA that I want in there.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.800
And my question has to do with the, your, your very interesting concept of infectious clone.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.840
I mean, to me, it's not a big surprise because I know that even DNA viruses base,

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:03.280
would it be an OAV when you actually go to the trouble of doing deep sequencing and you isolate

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.560
clone based on plaque formation and you're very careful to make sure that it's clonal.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:15.280
And you grow it just one cycle. You'll see variants immediately after one cycle of replication.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:21.520
And as you pointed out, the fidelity of replication for DNA is more higher than RNA.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.720
So I've always thought of RNA viruses from any, any source, would it be plant or bacteria or

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.760
mammalian viruses as kind of quasi species. I mean, the extreme being the HIV, where I mean,

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.120
where hepatitis, I mean, you, you find a lot of variation, which makes the characterization of a

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:48.000
clone that much more difficult. Having said that, we now have tool to do that. And I've noticed that

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.720
you were citing a paper from the Gia Raul's lab that has done, I've been following his work for

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:03.120
more than three years now. And he has done a large number of clonal isolation and tried to

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.080
characterize it, doing deep sequencing to confirm that it's not just the PCR sequence that they were

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:18.640
looking at. They were very thorough in order to do phylogenetic tree and so on. And are you

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.480
wondering whether when you actually isolate a clone from an individual that is sick? And now

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:30.960
you're trying to identify within this individual a clone or variant, and now they've called it

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.320
variants of concern and stuff like that. Are you questioning that the moment you start to grow it

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:44.080
in culture after a few cycle, you might end up with something that has already started to evolve

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.800
or have differences in the overall sequence, because it's a long genome and the fidelity of the

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:58.400
replication is not so great. So I assume that that happens. And that's the argument that

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:08.080
pervades my head when I think about the idea that we were told that from Wuhan to Washington,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:16.000
to California, to New York and Italy, there were less than three amino acid differences for four

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:25.200
months. And thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of asymptomatic infections were supposedly

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:33.120
spreading around the world. But the virus was keeping a fidelity of of a ridiculous level.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:43.600
And and the the original SARS virus that was tracked in 2002 had an average of between like

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:53.040
33 and 50 amino acid changes per patient for the first six months. And then this one changed

01:10:53.120 --> 01:11:00.000
10 amino acids in the first six months. So the stability of this the portrayed

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:11.440
sequences has no previous biological precedent. So the only way that this this could have happened

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.520
is if somebody seeded this level of fidelity around the world, like put a clone there so that

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.320
everybody that they tested would have a cultural bull virus for a little while. And it would be

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.640
a sequence of very high homology with the ones they released elsewhere. And then they slowly

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.760
drifted away. They slowly recombined with the background. I don't even think that they would

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:40.080
have to do it with very many patients. If you look through the the literature, you will find a very

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:49.680
a large paucity of actual. And I'm talking about experiments now, like from from 2020,

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.560
where they really isolated the virus sequence and said, wow, it's pretty much the same.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:02.240
It's not based on very many observations like that. America's entire pandemic is based on one

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:09.600
sequence collected in Seattle from the Sohomish County man. And that's it. Every other sequencing

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:15.840
reaction that was ever done was done behind CDC closed doors. And the sequences reported

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:23.360
only after the CDC decided to report them. There's no one sequencing in America and there never was.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:32.880
And and so if these sequences are real as we are here now, the point is is what happened in 2020

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.320
was a portrayal of something that couldn't have happened. Now, we're talking about a background

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:47.200
sequencing coronaviruses when we've never sequenced them in this with this rigor before 2022.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.800
It doesn't surprise me that we find all of this stuff. But to say that this is evidence of a

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.960
pandemic is very, very different. And I don't think that that's evidence of a pandemic. It's

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.920
evidence that those genetic sequences might be there. But he's got no data from 2019. So he

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.600
doesn't know if he would find the exact same data set had he started looking then.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.960
So what we're seeing right now, though, I mean, in this Omicron era is that it seems that

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:26.080
when you do a rigorous analysis, you do find other types of variant that seems to be more prevalent

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.040
in the sense that I understand there's going to be a very wide diversity of different

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:39.520
sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But the one that seems to be growing better in a given population

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:46.000
in a given time will eventually be, if you want sample more frequently and in the end, you will

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.400
have a overrepresentation of this variant until another one was superseded. So that's kind of a

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:59.120
cycle. And it's probably it has probably been like that before we started to analyze the coronavirus.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.240
You just didn't know about it. There you go. You just said it. If it was like this and this

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.720
pattern existed before the pandemic and they just announced it now, then we are being bamboozled.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.840
It's like saying that where there's a pandemic of automobiles while forgetting that we've always

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:25.120
had them. So your hypothesis in terms of the endemic state is that we have been human population,

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:33.120
I've been in an endemic state of coronavirus that could give respiratory infection as other

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:44.720
viruses could like Reno and even Hano and RSV. You name it. And they somehow emerge more decided

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:53.040
that these antipical respiratory infection was triggered by this particular new virus that has

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.200
came in the environment and now was spreading all over the world. And it was almost the same

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:08.000
kind of virus everywhere. And you find that difficult to fathom with the way normally

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.680
coronaviruses will actually be in the environment. Is that your thesis in terms of a pandemic versus

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:23.680
having local reproduction of coronaviruses in the population? Right. Remember, the pandemic

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:31.200
definition is a virus that starts in a room and then spreads around the world without being able

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:41.200
to be stopped. And that is a very, very specific set of biological claims. And so the idea that

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.040
there are these many, many stories of people having an interesting respiratory disease

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:55.440
is completely and wholly disconnected from the idea that a pathogen or a virus is moving

01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.760
around the world with high fidelity and is tracking with that disease. Because that is the illusion

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:10.880
of the PCR. If you assume that a PCR test identifies a case knowing that the PCR can be false,

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.480
positive, and also positive, false positive in the sense of a wrong coronavirus gene,

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.920
then we have a really huge problem because the statement that a virus was released at a point

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.200
and is still circulating the globe is not possible. And that requires an extraordinary

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.960
amount of evidence. Not it's an extraordinary claim. It requires an extraordinary amount of

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:43.120
evidence way beyond doctors saying that there's this new, I've seen a few people with a new

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.760
sickness. And so I decided not to give them antibiotics and throw them early on the ventilator and

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:53.280
give them some rendezivir. And they died. That's not an atypical respiratory disease.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:59.280
They can't differentiate from that and mistreating it if you changed your protocols across the entire

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:06.000
nation. How can you call that a unique respiratory disease? When you stop treating the respiratory

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.600
disease, you're way used to. And you started giving rendezivir or medazolam or not giving them

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.880
steroids. All of these changes that were made and the autonomy taken away from doctors caused

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:31.280
unique respiratory symptoms. That's the more likely explanation than an RNA virus maintaining

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.320
fidelity for three years and now having a slightly different hat on that we call omega.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:44.960
So if I understand what your hypothesis is, is that the source coronavirus, COV-2,

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:55.120
do exist and it can potentially induce diseases. But it was this kind of disease among all of the

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:02.240
other disease you can find from respiratory viruses was not the unique cause of this so-called

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.680
pandemic. And what we see in excess mortality is more likely attributed to what we've done in

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:18.320
terms of lack of treatment and also all of the things that we've imposed to quote-unquote control

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.680
the spread of the virus. Is that your working hypothesis? Absolutely, because if you talk about

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.960
how people died, you don't have to talk about very much virus. Absolutely. Thank you very much.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.240
You're welcome.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:45.360
Dr. Kui, those are the questions of the panel. This was very illuminating. On behalf of the

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.720
National Citizens' Inquiry, we sincerely thank you for attending today and providing your testimony.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.920
It was my honor. Thank you very much and I wish you guys the best of luck in this most important

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:03.120
endeavor.
