WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.840
We interrupt our program to bring you this important message.

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
Good morning.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.080
Today is Thursday, the 22nd of February.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.160
My name is Scott Shearer.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.040
I am Grace's dad.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.960
One of the reasons that God allowed Grace's premature death murder was to wake me up.

00:34.960 --> 00:40.800
That's why this program is called Deep Programming with Grace's dad because I needed Grace's

00:40.800 --> 00:44.320
death, unfortunately, to wake me up.

00:44.320 --> 00:50.120
I'm hopeful through all the advocacy and research that I've been doing that somebody else doesn't

00:50.120 --> 00:52.200
have to lose their best buddy.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.160
She's the reason we're here.

00:54.160 --> 01:00.040
I've often thought how easy it is for comics to get material.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.720
They just have to walk around and they get their material.

01:02.720 --> 01:07.160
Well, I'm starting to do the same thing, not from a comedy perspective, but from a real

01:07.160 --> 01:14.800
life perspective of how this entire antichrist and false profit system that has been for

01:14.800 --> 01:21.520
the past 6,000 years has meant to control us on one side and give us the illusion that

01:21.520 --> 01:23.840
we're not controlled on the other side.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
I saw it this morning.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.840
I went to the dentist and it's interesting to me.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.560
The last dentist I was at, they lied to me.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.320
I left the chair.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.120
The lady, the hygienist said, you've got to get x-rays.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.120
It's a law.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.800
I said, it's not a law.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.720
Because she lied to me, I left the chair and went to a new dentist and today, every time,

01:43.720 --> 01:47.520
I think if you go to the dentist weekly, they'll keep saying you need to get x-rays, you need

01:47.520 --> 01:48.520
to get x-rays.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.120
I went in for just the six-month cleaning, which is another sigh out.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.400
But anyway, regardless, I went in, she said, you're due for your x-rays.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.720
I said, I don't ever want to be asked again.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.000
I'm not going to do x-rays.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.400
And so she said, well, then we've got to have you sign this form.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.760
And she gives me the blank screen.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.600
I said, I'm not going to sign a blank screen.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.960
What's the form say?

02:08.960 --> 02:14.080
So we go through the form and it just, I'm basically saying that the dentist, their employees,

02:14.080 --> 02:16.200
blah, blah, blah, are not liable.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
And so that's fine.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.800
I'm not asking you to be liable for my decision.

02:19.800 --> 02:26.440
It would be interesting to me if I had them sign that they're liable for the radiation

02:26.440 --> 02:28.880
from the x-rays on my body.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.160
I'm sure they wouldn't do that.

02:30.160 --> 02:35.560
And when the dentist finally came in, he said, well, you've got to get these x-rays.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.760
I said, well, I'm not doing that.

02:36.760 --> 02:42.640
Well, then there's going to be a time where we can't do work for you anymore.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.400
So that's fine.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.040
Then I'll find another dentist.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.160
It's just interesting to me.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.720
I mean, it's a simple example, but another one happened.

02:49.720 --> 02:57.400
I normally, I'm not reporting news on this program, but yesterday, a lady who is a person

02:57.400 --> 03:03.720
I trust sent me, the latest on the UK, the reporting that Medazzalam was used to euthanize

03:03.720 --> 03:07.960
COVID patients, there's illegal DNRs on these patients.

03:07.960 --> 03:13.600
And, of course, this is all part of the controlled release of the evil.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.280
But first, it's coming up from the UK where the United States was number one on the planet

03:18.280 --> 03:20.680
with COVID hospital murders.

03:20.680 --> 03:25.280
And so this allows the United States to point at these naughty Europeans for doing that

03:25.280 --> 03:29.800
when we did it at a rate that's 10 times worse than them.

03:29.800 --> 03:37.640
So the layers of deception are hard for me to grasp, but praise God, we've got a guess

03:37.640 --> 03:42.080
that is an expert on layers of deception today.

03:42.080 --> 03:49.080
Well, before we introduce our guest, as I always do with the show, I want to say something

03:49.080 --> 03:50.440
about my best buddy.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.880
So Don, can you bring up the actress photo first?

03:54.880 --> 04:01.440
So this is Grace after she got done acting in one of the plays that she was in.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.120
And she was really good at it.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.120
She was a gift.

04:08.120 --> 04:14.400
We're going to show a short clip, just a 42nd clip from the sound of music play that

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
she was in.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.560
And she was the bower.

04:16.560 --> 04:22.560
And she got this part specifically because she asked for it.

04:22.560 --> 04:27.120
And she asked if she could add Liv and make it her own and boy did she ever.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.960
So Don, can you play that clip, please?

04:29.960 --> 04:34.760
Ladies and gentlemen, I have your decision of all this thing.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.320
We will start out in third place.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.760
In third place, the judges have names that sing a blown down air away again.

05:04.760 --> 05:16.080
You know, Grace have down syndrome and people don't realize the capability of somebody

05:16.080 --> 05:17.360
with down syndrome.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.440
If you let them live and, you know, that applies to all of us.

05:21.440 --> 05:27.920
But, you know, I always share these things about grace because, you know, the society

05:27.920 --> 05:34.040
is against people with disabilities, especially down syndrome in the United States, 90% of

05:34.040 --> 05:35.040
down syndrome.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.280
People are murdered in the womb today and Grace was the best thing that God ever gave

05:40.280 --> 05:41.520
us second to salvation.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.520
All right.

05:42.520 --> 05:49.040
Well, moving on to our program, Don, can you bring Jay in, please?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.040
Jay, welcome.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
Good to see you.

05:51.040 --> 05:58.680
Good to see you and as well, Scott, it's well, I don't know what to say other than I share

05:58.680 --> 06:01.480
my deepest condolences with you for the loss of your daughter.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.040
It's a very hard story to hear.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.240
Well, thank you very much for that.

06:07.240 --> 06:12.800
So Jay is somebody I've been following for quite a while for about two years, and he

06:12.800 --> 06:17.320
didn't know it until I tracked him down because I saw a presentation that he did.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.920
I thought, oh, my gosh, I wonder if he'd come on this podcast.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.440
And I've titled today's program, Layers of Deception.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.760
For those of you who don't know Jay, I'm going to have him introduce himself because

06:28.760 --> 06:34.360
the bio that he gave has got so many high points, I think he can say it best.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.400
So Jay, can you introduce yourself to the audience, please?

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Sure.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.200
Thanks very much, Scott.

06:40.200 --> 06:46.600
I'm a guy who answered very young that I wanted to be a doctor, and that's the best

06:46.600 --> 06:48.360
answer you can give to adults.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.720
Everybody lights up like a light bulb when you say you want to be a doctor.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.520
And so I got kind of stuck in that mold for a little while.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.680
I went all the way to college and thought I was a pre-med student, and I was on the

06:59.680 --> 07:05.160
wait list for five years in a row to like three different med schools in the Chicagoland

07:05.160 --> 07:06.160
area.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.800
And in that time, I was a bartender and a high school teacher, just kind of treading

07:09.800 --> 07:13.360
water, telling everybody that eventually I'm going to be a doctor.

07:13.360 --> 07:20.040
And at some point, I was making so much money as a bartender, I decided to stay just a bartender,

07:20.040 --> 07:24.880
and that kind of was the start of not necessarily bad things.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.280
Put me on a precipice that meant that when I didn't interact well with the bar owner,

07:30.280 --> 07:32.640
I lost my job.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.720
That put me in the want ads of the Chicago Tribune, and I found a technician job at

07:37.720 --> 07:42.480
the University of Chicago that brought me all the way back to my love of biology, got

07:42.480 --> 07:47.320
me already again fired up about science, but not from the perspective of med school, but

07:47.320 --> 07:51.240
rather from the perspective of doing a PhD and becoming a scientist.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.920
And I just never really considered that as a possibility.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.960
I didn't understand it.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.520
It was just I was going to be a doctor.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.080
That's what I had said and what I was going to do.

08:00.080 --> 08:05.360
Then I found myself teaching high school and really enjoying the aspect of teaching, but

08:05.360 --> 08:11.320
really just disturbed by the whole administration of school and the things that other teachers

08:11.320 --> 08:14.680
say and the number of teachers that had given up.

08:14.680 --> 08:20.320
So I was pretty disillusioned young adult for a long time between 20 and 30 years old

08:20.320 --> 08:22.040
until I found biology again.

08:22.040 --> 08:27.040
That was two years or three years of technician work at the University of Chicago.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.960
I took a chance and moved to the Netherlands and did my PhD there.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.280
I was lucky enough to trick a Dutch woman into falling in love with me.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.040
And then I took her to the Norway with me.

08:39.040 --> 08:45.600
And we had our first two sons in Norway, and then we came back to the Netherlands hoping

08:45.600 --> 08:47.120
to live there.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.880
She has a pretty wonderful extended family in the Netherlands.

08:50.880 --> 08:57.680
You know, 15 years ago was still a pretty, pretty nice place to live.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.480
But that didn't work out four years in Rotterdam brought me back to Pittsburgh.

09:01.480 --> 09:05.280
And so we tried again to start my scientific career in Pittsburgh.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.680
I got a pretty good position.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.480
I enjoyed where I was.

09:08.480 --> 09:13.760
I was biking to and from Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh on my bike all year

09:13.760 --> 09:14.960
around.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.360
I was able to teach every once in a while at Carnegie Mellon, which kind of scratched

09:19.360 --> 09:22.160
the teaching itch.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.160
Everything was going pretty well.

09:23.160 --> 09:29.920
And then the pandemic started and I started to very quickly question most of it, especially

09:29.920 --> 09:34.680
the sort of what I would consider now almost ridiculous measures that they were trying

09:34.680 --> 09:39.640
to get us to do, putting on a mask as soon as you walked into the hospital and walking

09:39.640 --> 09:43.320
over to someone at the door and signing in and then getting your temperature taken and

09:43.320 --> 09:47.640
put a little sticker on your badge so that they could see that you had your temperature

09:47.640 --> 09:48.640
taken.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.320
And if you wanted to go between buildings, you had to do it again.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.920
And it just seemed so ridiculous.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.240
They didn't even want me to bring my bike to work anymore because I was going through

09:56.240 --> 10:00.280
the garage and they didn't want me to bring the bike through the lobby.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.680
And since I couldn't go through the garage and then come back through the front and they

10:03.680 --> 10:08.520
were calling the saying I was a violation of the protocol anyway, at some moment the

10:08.520 --> 10:12.600
faculty decided that I was too scary to let to come in anymore.

10:12.600 --> 10:18.440
And they basically stopped my research, stopped talking to me and didn't renew my contract

10:18.440 --> 10:22.640
and in the university system, you can't move on if you don't have recommendations.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.800
If your research just stopped, if you don't have finished papers.

10:26.800 --> 10:32.800
And so they basically just ended a 20 year career in neurobiology and I found myself

10:32.800 --> 10:34.280
kind of, I didn't know what to do.

10:34.280 --> 10:40.680
So I just kept producing more stuff on my YouTube channel where I was teaching immunology

10:40.680 --> 10:48.760
and virology and reading the papers and trying to talk everyone back into believing that natural

10:48.760 --> 10:52.840
immunity meant something from the very beginning and that a lot of these worst case scenarios

10:52.840 --> 10:56.120
they've been telling us about for the last nine months aren't real.

10:56.120 --> 11:01.400
And that eventually got the attention of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.400
I was lucky enough to be able to help him behind the scenes write this Wuhan cover up

11:05.400 --> 11:07.600
book that came out.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.200
I guess I get my time frames mixed up now, but I think it came out like just this last

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
fall.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.200
But anyway.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.200
Yeah, I've got a copy rate.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
Hey, nice.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
Yeah.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.200
Yeah.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
So that was a copy here.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.200
Yeah.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.200
And then I got.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.120
Yeah, it's a nice book.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.760
It's a nice book and there's a lot of good biology in it from me and from other people.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.840
There's a couple really important citations that are in that book that aren't in any

11:31.840 --> 11:33.560
other book.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.800
And then for six months after that I worked for Children's Health Defense and in January,

11:38.800 --> 11:48.440
unfortunately, the approach that I take apparently with my stream encroached on the way that

11:48.440 --> 11:53.320
CHD interacts with their partners and they decided to let me go.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.080
That's the all the details I got.

11:55.080 --> 12:01.040
I was offered a small severance package of $8,000 and an NDA and I turned that down

12:01.040 --> 12:04.760
because I wanted to be able to tell everybody the truth about what happened and I didn't

12:04.760 --> 12:09.600
want people to speculate that somehow I took lots of money from CHD.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.200
And so I considered it a donation.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.160
I really think that organization is still spectacular.

12:14.160 --> 12:19.480
I loved working with Brian Hooker and with Jackie Hines and the other people that I got

12:19.480 --> 12:20.840
to work with while I was there.

12:21.840 --> 12:29.440
For whatever reason, there's more interests involved in that organization than I guess

12:29.440 --> 12:31.360
can cope with a guy like me or something.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
I don't know.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.440
But anyway, I'm back on the internet now.

12:34.440 --> 12:39.360
I'm back to teaching as often as I can and usually what I'm trying to do is what I'm

12:39.360 --> 12:45.800
going to do for you here, which is try to bring people back to reconsider what happened

12:45.800 --> 12:52.320
in 2020 and not buy the narrative on Fox News and not buy the narrative on MSNBC.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.120
Because I think there's a way to show everybody that actually both of those narratives led

12:56.120 --> 13:02.520
to the same place and if we can do that, I think, and more importantly, if we can get

13:02.520 --> 13:07.600
young adults to realize that the ones that we abandoned for a couple years that we sent

13:07.600 --> 13:15.760
off to college and didn't keep home and didn't, I think that was one of the biggest mistakes

13:15.760 --> 13:19.720
we made is letting our college kids make this decision that, well, college is so important

13:19.720 --> 13:23.760
that I'm going to go and I'm going to take tests and I'm eventually going to take a

13:23.760 --> 13:25.440
shot in order to go back to college.

13:25.440 --> 13:31.960
We should have been there for them and I think if we had been, we might be in a very different

13:31.960 --> 13:33.320
place right now.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.880
So we have to also apologize to them for that, I think.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.880
Should I start this little thing?

13:37.880 --> 13:38.880
I'll get it done quick.

13:38.880 --> 13:45.000
Yeah, Don, Don, we're going to have Jay start and then we'll come back as we talk.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Go ahead.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
It's all yours.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay, thanks.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.600
So this presentation I gave a little while ago, I'm really happy Scott's letting me do

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
it.

13:51.600 --> 13:57.760
I'm just going to give the first introduction to kind of give you an idea of how science

13:57.760 --> 14:04.280
and information and discussions can be manipulated and please don't misunderstand this as me

14:04.280 --> 14:07.440
representing this as something that I've put together.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.880
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants going all the way back to somebody like Thomas Sol.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.440
We should not be misleading the young and I guarantee you that that's what they are

14:16.440 --> 14:19.480
intending to do right now.

14:19.480 --> 14:24.920
The way that this has been best described is by Edward Bernays, the conscious and intelligent

14:24.920 --> 14:29.840
manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element of democratic

14:29.840 --> 14:30.840
society.

14:30.840 --> 14:37.120
This guy lived in the 1920s when there were only newspapers and radio.

14:37.120 --> 14:43.000
Imagine the kind of power that we have abdicated to the people that own social media and that

14:43.000 --> 14:46.960
own mainstream media and that are no longer held to the standard that even we held our

14:46.960 --> 14:52.000
TV stations to in the 80s where you couldn't go on TV and lie.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.320
You can now you can literally go on TV and lie then the the NFL is actually entertainment.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.280
It is not a sport anymore.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.560
So we have to acknowledge these things and more importantly we have to acknowledge this

15:04.560 --> 15:10.680
social media isn't the free speech world that we imagine it to be because the algorithms

15:10.680 --> 15:14.040
and because money and power are behind it.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.720
There are people on the internet that have been for years promoted artificially to make

15:18.720 --> 15:26.280
sure that whatever voice you seek, whatever opinion you seek, it is sort of already preconceived

15:26.280 --> 15:30.520
by someone that they have control over so that the limited spectrum of debate is enforced

15:30.520 --> 15:32.240
whether you know it or not.

15:32.240 --> 15:37.440
Now this the selling point I have for the pandemic that I think is most important is

15:37.440 --> 15:42.760
to understand that the left and the right, the Tories and the labor, wherever country

15:42.760 --> 15:48.840
you want to go in both sides and it's incredible really how often western countries have two

15:48.840 --> 15:54.400
sides of the coin but both sides have been fooled into solving a mystery and that's

15:54.400 --> 15:59.080
why I call it a an illusion of consensus about this Scooby-Doo.

15:59.080 --> 16:04.080
They have agreed on both sides that there is a mystery to be solved and it's a mystery

16:04.080 --> 16:06.360
about a lab leak.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.400
The important thing to see is that this illusion of consensus didn't start in 2020 with some

16:11.400 --> 16:15.560
panic on the television and radio.

16:15.560 --> 16:21.760
This illusion of consensus started already a couple decades ago with the funding of the

16:21.760 --> 16:27.880
publishing of and the encouragement with more funding of specific lines of investigation

16:27.880 --> 16:33.440
which started to imply that pandemic potential existed in mother nature.

16:33.440 --> 16:40.560
If you tell scientists with millions of dollars to go find something and show you evidence

16:40.560 --> 16:45.320
that something exists and if you find that evidence will give you more money I can guarantee

16:45.320 --> 16:46.720
you they're going to find evidence.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.160
They might not find good evidence but they will find good reasons to argue that their

16:51.160 --> 16:54.800
bad evidence is evidence of what you want to find.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.600
They have also conducted over and over again over the years many people are aware of the

16:59.600 --> 17:06.560
event 201 but you can go and find several more exercises that have occurred over time

17:06.560 --> 17:13.320
which have reinforced this idea that bioterrorism, bioweapons that this possibility is almost

17:13.320 --> 17:21.120
limitless and this importantly has led to at the start of the pandemic very many embedded

17:21.120 --> 17:26.800
preconceived notions about what worst case scenario is and they have taken advantage

17:26.800 --> 17:28.120
of that.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.480
All of these people in these meetings that had lanyards on that got to go to the fancy

17:32.480 --> 17:38.600
dinners afterward or had some special meeting in Italy because that's where all these people

17:38.600 --> 17:40.040
went that year.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.360
These people have all preconceived notions about what worst case scenario is and their

17:44.360 --> 17:48.360
careers have depended on them respecting it as real.

17:48.360 --> 17:55.040
At the beginning of the pandemic now a very diabolical trick I believe was played on us

17:55.040 --> 18:01.480
and that they told us a lot of stories about what was happening in expectation that when

18:01.480 --> 18:06.760
they transfected us and I will define that later of course when you ask, when they transfected

18:06.760 --> 18:11.120
us when they used the countermeasures that they knew they were going to use.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.760
They also knew that there would be expected side effects, expected downsides and they

18:15.760 --> 18:20.760
seeded that expectation in the story in 2020.

18:20.760 --> 18:26.800
There are lots of internet rumors and things like people falling down on the street but

18:26.800 --> 18:32.000
also intermediate rumors like heart attacks, waves of heart attacks that were actually

18:32.000 --> 18:37.720
caused by and I'm sure Scott's aware of this just do not resuscitate orders that were given

18:37.720 --> 18:45.160
to entire EMT teams so that when they went out they were told don't resuscitate people

18:45.160 --> 18:47.280
because you might spread the virus.

18:47.280 --> 18:54.800
This led to their ability to confound expected problems to come from the countermeasures

18:54.800 --> 19:00.120
with problems that they blamed on the virus and this was all done by a team of people

19:00.120 --> 19:02.520
that were already ready to go.

19:02.520 --> 19:07.480
More importantly where they were going to perform these things like in New York, you

19:07.480 --> 19:13.360
must be very very suspicious of New York because the story in New York is very stark.

19:13.360 --> 19:20.760
It is twenty four thousand people give or take were killed or died or disappeared

19:20.760 --> 19:27.800
or vanished or buried in four weeks in New York City and then the dying basically stopped

19:27.800 --> 19:29.840
and went back to Baselay.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.440
We don't know where all these bodies are.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.440
We don't know who they are.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.440
We don't know their names.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.800
No, there's no good accounting of them and in fact there are many many people who will

19:37.800 --> 19:44.760
tell you that nobody was dying in New York City in 2020 and the real dying started in

19:44.760 --> 19:46.560
2021.

19:46.560 --> 19:53.200
It's extraordinary because the way this probably worked and this is a pretty good estimation

19:53.200 --> 19:58.240
from a lot of different sides is that if this was a national security issue that they were

19:58.240 --> 20:06.280
considering worst case scenario possible then in certain places they would have the military

20:06.280 --> 20:12.360
industrial complex whoever it is the executive branch HHS DOD would have been waiting for

20:12.360 --> 20:16.600
good Samaritan doctors to show up in New York City and a few of them have probably been

20:16.600 --> 20:24.040
co-opted co-opted to go along with this worst case scenario why because we don't know at

20:24.040 --> 20:29.880
the time if the worst case scenario is going to come and we need to impress on a nation

20:29.880 --> 20:37.640
of 350 million people we need to impress upon a planet of 8 billion people that the worst

20:37.640 --> 20:44.400
case scenario is possible and that we all need to comply and so this was super important

20:44.400 --> 20:50.240
and it has been going on for four years where they have been continuously reinforcing that

20:50.240 --> 20:54.400
the reason why they acted the reason why they did what they did the reason why they rushed

20:54.400 --> 20:59.520
what they rushed the reason why they lied when they lied whatever the excuse is is because

20:59.520 --> 21:04.760
worst case scenario was possible and in fact the worst case scenario gets worse and worse

21:04.760 --> 21:09.240
as we go into the future because all of these technologies are supposedly getting easier

21:09.240 --> 21:14.640
and easier and cheaper and cheaper and so eventually people are going to make these viruses in

21:14.640 --> 21:20.480
their garage with a bachelor's degree in biology what I want is high morbidity I want people

21:20.480 --> 21:25.560
to complain so what do I do I go to Des Moines ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen

21:25.560 --> 21:29.480
I have nothing against Des Moines I live there for four years I go to Des Moines I infect

21:29.480 --> 21:35.600
a couple of Sentinel cases in Des Moines I go to Seattle I infect a couple of cases there

21:35.600 --> 21:42.040
I go to North Carolina I go to Wisconsin what I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology

21:42.040 --> 21:47.400
to be able to infect Sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition these individuals

21:47.400 --> 21:51.200
complain again this is a central nervous system condition so they're complaining of whatever

21:51.200 --> 21:57.160
the bug may do so what this guy is describing and this guy's name is James Giordano and

21:57.160 --> 22:00.640
you can find him on the internet there's lots of videos off of YouTube you can watch

22:00.640 --> 22:06.160
hours of him describing worst case scenarios with regard to bio weapon deployment and how

22:06.160 --> 22:11.160
a bio weapon deployment could be exaggerated with the internet and used to destabilize

22:11.160 --> 22:17.320
a country and he's got lots of examples of neurotoxins and chemicals and nanobots and

22:17.320 --> 22:22.400
all kinds of things that it could be done with now what I would like everyone that's

22:22.400 --> 22:29.000
watching to consider is that what he's also revealing actually is that if the right combination

22:29.000 --> 22:34.800
of liars got together and decided that they were going to pretend or agree that worst

22:34.800 --> 22:41.280
case scenario was happening that a lot of what James Giordano would ascribe to a neurotoxin

22:41.280 --> 22:47.160
or a chemical or some kind of magic deployment of new military technology could be simply

22:47.160 --> 22:53.760
done with testing and protocols that had financial incentives for people to follow those protocols

22:53.760 --> 22:59.480
and unfortunately all of those things actually exist in our current timeline we have a military

22:59.480 --> 23:05.160
response that was documented in certain places in America including in New York City we have

23:05.160 --> 23:09.840
a co-opted selection group of narrative controllers that have been put in front of us from the

23:09.840 --> 23:14.960
very beginning have been selling books about the virus from the very beginning and are still

23:14.960 --> 23:22.000
in front of us now they have there was a financial and legal incentive to call things COVID including

23:22.000 --> 23:26.560
the fact that if EMTs and doctors called it COVID then they were off the hook for malpractice

23:26.560 --> 23:32.960
because this was a novel virus that was protected under the prep act a coordinated propaganda campaign

23:32.960 --> 23:39.160
to drill the worst case scenario was combined with scaring doctors by sending the old doctors

23:39.160 --> 23:44.440
home and giving them early retirement giving early professor or old professors early retirement

23:44.440 --> 23:49.880
at universities was done all around the United States which created this work wow they're they're

23:49.880 --> 23:55.800
letting the the chair of the department retire that's crazy this must really be a dangerous virus

23:55.800 --> 24:02.600
then they did something absolutely diabolical and they used the protocols to kill people and

24:02.600 --> 24:09.960
unfortunately for the the host of this podcast he knows exactly how this was done in one of many

24:09.960 --> 24:16.760
different examples of how vulnerable people using protocols that were absolutely amoral and absolutely

24:16.760 --> 24:23.000
wrong for for the well-being of the patient were used under the pretense of this worst case scenario

24:23.000 --> 24:28.120
and in turn those numbers were used to justify to the rest of the country that the worst case

24:28.200 --> 24:34.840
scenario was happening right and this is diabolical they knew they had to do this in order to get

24:34.840 --> 24:40.920
compliance and so now the question only is what percentage do you want to attribute to what part

24:40.920 --> 24:48.840
of this this murdering scheme because there is no need to have a virus except in the cases where

24:48.840 --> 24:56.760
like the Sohomish County man in Washington state you actually claim to have cultured the virus

24:56.760 --> 25:03.000
and sequenced its full genome and it's exactly the same as Wuhan well maybe there they have planted

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
something like Giordano has has said to create the illusion of a pandemic maybe they planted

25:09.000 --> 25:14.200
the sequence in other places as well so that the sequence would be found and could be confounded

25:14.200 --> 25:21.800
with this worst case scenario however grace and and and Rebecca's daughter whose name i can't

25:21.800 --> 25:29.640
remember right now and all the other other victims of and people have lost husbands and wives

25:29.640 --> 25:33.800
when they went into the hospitals and it was the wrong hospital they weren't coming out

25:33.800 --> 25:40.440
and this reality was part of a pre-existing narrative that unlike what Giordano says with

25:40.440 --> 25:48.520
magic bioweapons and things like that this is really a very clever combination of misdirection

25:48.600 --> 25:57.240
and and and fear confusion frustration doubt that allowed this story of a novel virus that

25:57.240 --> 26:03.160
killed millions of people but we saved millions more from by injecting people Paul Offit just

26:03.160 --> 26:08.600
said two days ago on his little podcast that the one thing we got right was the mRNA injection

26:08.600 --> 26:14.520
wow was that exciting we got it right when we've never used it before it was the most extraordinary

26:15.400 --> 26:21.080
lie i'd ever heard in recent memory and of course they're telling us that this virus will come again

26:21.080 --> 26:30.040
i have been trying to explain that this pandemic potential in of in a bat cave or in a cell culture

26:30.040 --> 26:36.840
or in animal passage or even if you stitch pieces together has been a clever mythology that has

26:36.840 --> 26:42.040
been told to us so that we will hand it down to our children so that we will tell our children that

26:42.120 --> 26:48.040
the worst case scenario actually didn't happen and that if it did it could be billions of people

26:48.040 --> 26:53.880
dead that's what they want us to believe so that we will surrender our sovereignty and we will

26:53.880 --> 27:00.520
invert our freedom to a sort of fascism and we will do it gladly because we are afraid that these

27:00.520 --> 27:07.960
people are out of control and a lot of these intellectual dark web joe rogan bret Weinstein type

27:07.960 --> 27:12.360
people have actually been responsible for us getting to the stage where we believe this

27:12.920 --> 27:19.400
this this possibility is real so there were also guys that were talking at the beginning of the

27:19.400 --> 27:31.000
pandemic that like this dude biblical i kid you not people come in i get intubated they die

27:31.560 --> 27:36.600
the cycle repeats that guy got put on tucker carlson he says that his daughter is also he's

27:36.600 --> 27:41.400
scared because his daughter works at another hospital in new york they got people on tv to tell

27:41.400 --> 27:46.440
you that what was happening wasn't what was really happening and it was part of this exercise and

27:46.440 --> 27:52.200
you can see it because they won't do the math about where these excess deaths come from none of these

27:52.200 --> 27:58.200
people will and what this is they don't talk about the fact that they sent these doctors home that

27:58.200 --> 28:03.240
they told these emts not to touch anybody they told people that they needed to be ventilated

28:03.240 --> 28:06.680
because if you don't ventilate them they might spread it through the whole hospital

28:06.680 --> 28:11.960
they didn't tell everybody they don't explain to people that they told doctors not to use antibiotics

28:11.960 --> 28:16.680
because antibiotics don't work on a virus they told doctors that steroids don't work you can't

28:16.680 --> 28:21.960
use those to calm down the cytokine storm they didn't tell everybody that remdesivir would hurt

28:21.960 --> 28:27.080
people they didn't tell everybody that mandazalam was overused they haven't told everybody that

28:27.080 --> 28:32.440
opioid deaths have gone skyrocketing the last three years and have been mixed in with this excess

28:32.440 --> 28:36.440
deaths that have nothing to do with the novel virus they don't talk about the death certificate

28:36.440 --> 28:41.720
fraud the financial incentives to do it they don't talk about the track and trace millions of dollars

28:41.720 --> 28:47.400
who are spent just in Pittsburgh alone on four different companies that hired people to call

28:47.400 --> 28:52.920
people to tell people that somebody you know tested positive for covid they don't talk about

28:52.920 --> 28:58.520
the pcr fraud the lateral tense fraud and the sequencing fraud the important thing to see here

28:58.520 --> 29:03.880
is it's a spread of bad ideas it's scarier than this RNA virus that they're talking about the RNA

29:03.880 --> 29:09.160
molecule that they spread say spread from muhan all around the world and it's still going now

29:10.200 --> 29:16.040
and the important thing to understand is that this is done across the board and the best example

29:16.040 --> 29:21.800
for this audience might be autism and the reason why i can give you this example is because i'm a

29:21.800 --> 29:27.640
neuro neurobiologist and so i was in this field where everybody's trying to study the brain

29:27.640 --> 29:32.520
and there are potentially millions of dollars of grant money available if you have a good idea

29:32.520 --> 29:38.600
or you have a good um interesting thing that you want to uh that you want to investigate

29:39.240 --> 29:44.040
but the problem is is that these millions if not billions of dollars have been

29:44.040 --> 29:49.880
focused on particular things by asking these doctors to ask particular questions and in the

29:49.880 --> 29:56.520
case of autism and a lot of these other diseases the trick is that they know that

29:57.800 --> 30:02.680
how can i explain as quick as possible they know that the only thing that they have to offer and

30:02.680 --> 30:07.720
the only thing that they really care about is cracking the human genome and so what they've done

30:07.720 --> 30:13.640
with almost all the NIH funding but only thing i can really speak to as clearly as possible is

30:13.720 --> 30:20.600
neurobiology the study of the brain they focus on genes and the reason why they focus on genes is

30:20.600 --> 30:27.240
because this is the only straw they have to grasp on and because they can create almost an

30:27.240 --> 30:35.080
infinite variety of illusions by blaming things on genes and autism is a fantastic example of that

30:35.080 --> 30:42.680
where they have invested millions of dollars with grant calls which ask researchers to find

30:42.680 --> 30:50.760
connections with particular particular genes and autism with particular uh with particular

30:50.760 --> 30:57.000
childhood diseases which resemble autism and the genetic causes of those and then

30:57.560 --> 31:04.520
misconstruing those as explaining autism which comes from vaccine injury by uh for example and

31:04.520 --> 31:12.440
so this this cleverness extends to almost all science but the science that is most distorted

31:12.440 --> 31:19.320
by this level of of disingenuousness is medical sciences it's the sciences that impinges on the

31:19.320 --> 31:26.840
healthcare system and drugs and and the intellectual property that supports it and so all of these

31:27.400 --> 31:33.560
these investigations are pigeonholed in this way as a biologist it's it's likely that i

31:33.560 --> 31:41.800
would not have been able to get grant money to study vaccine injury models of autism so in other

31:41.800 --> 31:49.640
words they they come up with lots of grants that are a mouse model of of all Alzheimer's disease

31:49.640 --> 31:56.040
or a mouse model of Parkinson's disease but they would never ever fund a mouse model of vaccine

31:56.040 --> 32:03.640
injury they will fund a mouse model of genetic causes of autism and if you make a genetic

32:03.640 --> 32:09.160
knockout mouse that doesn't socialize well with its mom and you call that a model of autism they'll

32:09.160 --> 32:14.520
fund that till the cows come home but if you tell them that you want to make and develop an

32:14.520 --> 32:20.440
animal model where you use a vaccine equivalent to inject and then investigate what happens to

32:20.440 --> 32:25.960
that animal's physiology you'll get it not a dime and that that's the that's the reality of it so

32:25.960 --> 32:32.600
for 10 years they've been putting billions in the uu in america into the genetic causes of all of

32:32.600 --> 32:38.840
these things and so now the entire field is more or less convinced that the genetic

32:38.840 --> 32:43.000
causes are the only thing that we need to worry about that our interaction with the environment that

32:43.000 --> 32:48.040
interference with development that that any of these things are secondary to the genetic causes

32:48.040 --> 32:54.680
because first and foremost that's how i get my money and so with regard to the pandemic potential

32:54.680 --> 33:02.280
that we are now told is inevitable and exists for all time the same methodology was used you

33:02.280 --> 33:07.880
give money you tell people what you want them to find and then they publish papers

33:07.880 --> 33:13.800
that says well we kind of found some stuff and if you do that long enough eventually you have a

33:13.800 --> 33:20.280
whole trail of papers that can be pointed to and said well pandemic potential exists in mother

33:20.280 --> 33:30.120
nature subscript 4 5 6 pandemic potential has been identified in bat caves subscript 2 3 and 4

33:30.200 --> 33:34.440
and if you go back to those papers you find that those papers say the same things well there might be

33:35.640 --> 33:41.560
and this limited spectrum of debate is where we now live and we imagine that there's all this

33:41.560 --> 33:45.400
certainty and that all these people on the news are correct and that they all know what they're

33:45.400 --> 33:49.800
talking about more than we could possibly ever understand so we might as well just give up

33:49.800 --> 33:57.400
watch Netflix and not question them and in reality most of what we think is high fidelity biology

33:57.400 --> 34:03.080
which is defined a pandemic over the last four years is smoke and mirrors and the most terrible

34:03.080 --> 34:10.920
thing is is that the moms and dads who had vaccine injured kids already were onto this fraud the

34:10.920 --> 34:16.760
the people that were affected by AIDS and AZT were already onto this fraud and it's just

34:16.760 --> 34:23.560
unfortunate that the media machine has already kept us apart for decades and now the pandemic

34:23.560 --> 34:28.520
now represents a time where this limited spectrum of debate can kind of be exposed for

34:28.520 --> 34:34.200
what it is and we can kind of reorient and try to I guess the best phrase is to take our country

34:34.200 --> 34:41.160
back again I don't know what else to say other than that yeah well is that right are you still

34:41.160 --> 34:50.040
there I am well thanks Jay that was fantastic you can hear me okay I could hear you no yes sorry I

34:51.000 --> 34:55.720
had one down there for a second yeah that was that was really good these layers of deception I

34:55.720 --> 35:04.040
mean they create a false science and then base their evidence on something false that that they

35:04.040 --> 35:11.640
created I mean that is it's it's really something to me and I want to have Don play this clip

35:11.640 --> 35:17.080
about Edward Bernays you introduced him but I want to play this clip and just I want to

35:17.160 --> 35:22.920
spend just a couple minutes on him because he really got this idea of propaganda going so

35:22.920 --> 35:27.720
Don can you play that clip he's a guy that was brought to my attention by Vera Sharav

35:27.720 --> 35:35.400
who's also a good fighter on our team yes she starts her presentation with him every day every

35:35.400 --> 35:42.440
time so I give a big shout out to her and her work well I just talked with her this last week

35:42.920 --> 35:49.320
she's fast she's writing a book right now she's she has been a gift to me personally with all

35:49.320 --> 35:55.640
of her knowledge Don play the Edward Bernays clip please a pioneer in the field of propaganda

35:55.640 --> 36:01.160
he's also referred to as the father of public relations Bernays believed that public relations

36:01.160 --> 36:06.760
is not a gimmick but a necessity he argued that public relations could be used to shape the

36:06.840 --> 36:13.640
response of a general or particular audience he understood that perception often mattered more

36:13.640 --> 36:21.960
than reality Bernays was born in Vienna Austria in 1891 and later his family moved to New York City

36:21.960 --> 36:27.240
he graduated from Cornell University with a degree in agriculture in 1912 one of Bernays major

36:27.240 --> 36:33.960
contributions was his groundbreaking book titled propaganda published in 1928 which rebranded the

36:33.960 --> 36:39.400
term propaganda as a consistent enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the

36:39.400 --> 36:45.560
relations of the public to an enterprise idea or group in it he expounded his belief that an

36:45.560 --> 36:50.120
invisible ruling elite could control the masses through psychological manipulation

36:51.800 --> 36:57.160
awesome yeah I think that was a it's a good clip it gives everybody a flavor a couple of things I

36:57.240 --> 37:04.920
want to share is are that first of all that man lived to be 104 years old it's interesting

37:04.920 --> 37:08.440
yeah it's interesting to me that a number of these people who are

37:10.680 --> 37:16.440
really evil they live to be over a hundred we're not going to cover that today but you can just

37:16.440 --> 37:23.880
chew on that if you're you're listening the the thing that I want to mention is we had a law in

37:23.880 --> 37:30.280
place that was put in place in 1948 called the Smith month act and interestingly the Smith

37:30.280 --> 37:39.160
month act said that the United States could only use propaganda against foreign countries all right

37:39.160 --> 37:46.360
so it you know that's a that's propaganda in and of itself because now we have this illusion

37:46.360 --> 37:52.920
that they're not using propaganda against us and the what I would consider the third largest

37:52.920 --> 37:59.560
sign up that we've ever experienced in United States history happened post 1948 which was the

37:59.560 --> 38:07.320
JFK murder but that was when that law was in place well then in 2012 the law is repealed so now we

38:07.320 --> 38:14.680
can we can lie to our own citizens and it's legal and Jay was mentioning you know he was mentioning

38:14.680 --> 38:20.280
that earlier but I wanted to connect the dots on how they do this I mean they they do it with

38:20.280 --> 38:27.480
these levels of deception and it's it's mind-blowing to me uh so any comment any further comment on

38:27.480 --> 38:33.160
that Jay before we move on no no I just am really happy that we connect on Bernays because he's

38:34.040 --> 38:40.760
his historic relevance also I mean he's it's too old not to take seriously if they could

38:41.480 --> 38:47.240
think in that way when there were only a few newspapers and word traveled very much by word of

38:47.240 --> 38:53.960
mouth what they can do now with cell phones and and social media I'm afraid none of us

38:53.960 --> 39:01.000
understand how bad it is I don't think we can understand how bad it is I I agree I have stopped

39:01.000 --> 39:06.200
trying to understand how bad it is because you end up going in these rabbit holes and you can't

39:06.200 --> 39:12.280
get out of them you just jump from hall to hall um a you know speaking of newspapers I'm gonna

39:12.280 --> 39:17.000
have Don bring up a newspaper clip next on the screen so can you bring up the gold standard

39:17.000 --> 39:26.920
all right so this clip is from April 6th of 1933 and what happened on April 5th of 1933 I think

39:26.920 --> 39:33.160
is extremely significant as to how they pulled this off and what happened is we went off the

39:33.160 --> 39:39.000
gold standard as a country on April 5th and this article says that anybody who doesn't turn in

39:39.000 --> 39:45.080
their gold is subject to a ten thousand dollar penalty from the government all right so why do I

39:45.080 --> 39:53.960
say that God says the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil well before April 5th of

39:53.960 --> 40:01.080
1933 they they meaning everybody in you know the United States is leading the charge here but they

40:01.080 --> 40:08.040
had to balance the budget after 1933 they don't have to balance the budget anymore as we have a fiat

40:08.040 --> 40:15.480
currency and so now they can use money to literally buy any single person they want

40:16.360 --> 40:22.840
and there's no accountability anymore because it's a fiat currency I think it is one of the key

40:22.840 --> 40:29.720
tentacles of how they were able to pull off things like COVID but I mean COVID is is I don't want to

40:29.720 --> 40:35.560
focus on COVID from the point of view that it's over and all of that I want to focus on COVID

40:35.560 --> 40:41.880
because what COVID did to me personally is expose the evil that has been going on for a long time

40:41.880 --> 40:49.000
and that's why I showed what happened in 1933 you know and then if you look at you know the the

40:49.880 --> 40:57.080
focus on people that are are into eschatology as a scyop you know because they can't stop going

40:57.080 --> 41:01.560
down rabbit holes they they're looking for the mark of the beast and they don't realize the

41:01.640 --> 41:06.680
mark of the beast is this whole system that we've already been into I mean there's a digital

41:06.680 --> 41:11.960
currency okay well I mean we get I mean that's the worst thing we're already in in that era

41:11.960 --> 41:17.800
right we only use credit cards we have a fiat currency so the next it's just the next generation

41:17.800 --> 41:23.720
of what we're already used to all right I want to uh switch gears and drill down this COVID

41:23.720 --> 41:27.560
scyop you know you know a little bit different light from some of the angles that I've been

41:27.560 --> 41:32.280
investigating so you know just we'll set the stage I'm going to have Don bring up a couple

41:32.280 --> 41:39.640
of clips then and then we're going to do some deep dive into some things that are on my radar

41:39.640 --> 41:45.240
screen that I believe you've you're probably one of the only few people who can answer so we'll just

41:45.240 --> 41:53.000
start with we know that COVID was a scyop so what is that scyop in in in tail well it entails a

41:53.000 --> 42:01.400
virus it entails a pandemic it entails hospital murders and entails a quote vaccine end quote

42:01.400 --> 42:07.160
those are the four elements of the the scyop so they had to start this with this three weeks to

42:07.160 --> 42:12.760
flatten the curve you know so we kind of all bought into that idea okay well if this is real

42:12.760 --> 42:17.480
three weeks to flatten the curve everybody can give up three weeks no biggie right all right well

42:17.480 --> 42:23.240
of course that was a lie well then they start the false testing and so now well boy everybody's

42:23.240 --> 42:28.200
got COVID we got drive-through testing centers you know this whole you know I'm on just on the

42:28.200 --> 42:33.480
surface level here folks but then okay well now it gets serious we got to do the hospital murders

42:33.480 --> 42:39.320
and we've got these these refrigerated trucks in New York City with you know people stacked up

42:39.320 --> 42:45.640
like cordwood and it's like oh my gosh this is you know this is the scyop that at this point

42:45.640 --> 42:51.240
my wife and I were buying into so now we get all COVID prepared at our house right we've got

42:51.240 --> 42:57.720
Ivermectin we got vitamins but you know so then once Grace got a cold we tested her with the home

42:57.720 --> 43:03.960
test that my wife Cindy got from Walgreens and oh my gosh her oxygen dropped to 88 percent and

43:03.960 --> 43:07.960
you know literally Grace would be alive today if we wouldn't have taken her to the hospital

43:07.960 --> 43:12.920
and I'm not going to go on that rabbit trail I've talked about on many many shows before well then

43:13.720 --> 43:19.160
now we start looking at some truth all right so that's the lay of the land now we look at some

43:19.720 --> 43:25.320
some truth if you can look through the headline so Don bring up the first headline the the daily

43:25.320 --> 43:33.880
beast screenshot okay so let's read this together Jay Trump's COVID data crunchers seek

43:34.520 --> 43:40.760
coronavirus racing down America's major highways all right so they use this as

43:41.640 --> 43:49.080
their talking point that we shouldn't travel okay because we're spreading it by traveling

43:49.080 --> 43:54.280
and yet what they're doing and I'm going to have you comment in a minute Don bring up the next

43:55.320 --> 44:02.760
screenshot because now I went to world data and this this screenshot that Don's going to bring

44:02.760 --> 44:10.120
up next okay it's up on the screen now you see it's interesting that if this thing was a virus

44:10.120 --> 44:16.600
that we all need to be fearful of you can see the date I picked was September 21st 2020 Jay

44:16.600 --> 44:23.560
you can see well why why did certain countries not get it and I'm I picked out specifically if

44:23.560 --> 44:29.080
you look at of course Greenland didn't get it and you know there's a whole movie I'm you know

44:29.080 --> 44:35.160
getting to Greenland but then the interesting country that didn't get the virus as of September

44:35.160 --> 44:43.400
21st of 2020 was Ukraine anyway what is your thought about this you know at this point in the

44:43.960 --> 44:50.040
in that whole scheme where there you know I when I started to see these maps that oh wow this is

44:50.040 --> 44:55.000
interesting it went along these highway corridors and it didn't it didn't jump certain countries I

44:55.000 --> 45:02.200
started okay is this thing even a virus so the show is yours go ahead my response would be that

45:02.280 --> 45:10.120
this is in retrospect I think really strong evidence for the play which I think they really

45:10.120 --> 45:17.000
planned all along which was that the island that I will step back one second and say that I do

45:17.000 --> 45:24.120
think that most of the theater that was engaged in was orchestrated by the five ice countries

45:24.120 --> 45:32.920
including ourselves so Canada Australia New Zealand England us and of course that's because

45:32.920 --> 45:40.440
these are the people that we can most easily identify with as Americans and so what needed to

45:40.440 --> 45:47.960
happen is Americans needed to see examples of lockdowns that were number one much harsher than

45:47.960 --> 45:55.800
theirs and number two that worked and so Australia New Zealand are examples of lockdowns that worked

45:55.800 --> 46:01.960
and they they locked down in Australia most of us can't remember that they were allowed outside

46:01.960 --> 46:08.200
for one hour a day they locked down for hundreds of days in a row they weren't allowed to go from

46:08.200 --> 46:14.200
state to state unless they were vaccinated and that level of control they could have never executed

46:14.280 --> 46:19.480
in America but they needed to set an example and they needed to be able to say that because we

46:19.480 --> 46:27.080
locked down we didn't have any cases until 2021 and so that's the story that I think was there that's

46:27.080 --> 46:33.320
the that was the thing we were being shown these ridiculously angry Australian and New Zealand

46:33.320 --> 46:38.920
leaders but also the Americans saying well maybe their lockdown is going to work you know and maybe

46:38.920 --> 46:43.640
maybe the Japanese are wearing masks and that's why they're not sick all of this speculation was

46:43.720 --> 46:50.920
pre-prepared and it's part of this limited spectrum of debate where then the people on TV are arguing

46:50.920 --> 46:55.240
not about whether there's a virus but whether or not the lockdowns there are working better

46:55.240 --> 47:00.520
than the lockdowns here yep exactly that's exactly what they want they want us to get into these

47:00.520 --> 47:04.680
dialectic arguments that have nothing to do with the truth oh we're gonna rattle through a couple

47:04.680 --> 47:11.160
more here so what do you think about when they pulled the Johnson and Johnson shot yeah it's

47:11.160 --> 47:15.720
exactly the same thing and the worst part about this is is that we can go back to Jesse

47:15.720 --> 47:21.320
Gelsinger and know that they already knew that adenovirus wasn't going to be a useful way to augment

47:22.520 --> 47:28.520
a human body the functioning human body Jesse Gelsinger is a guy who had a very rare genetic

47:28.520 --> 47:33.240
disorder missing a enzyme in his in his liver it's very debilitating you have to have a very

47:33.240 --> 47:40.440
special diet yeah yeah yeah and they tried to transfect his liver with the enzyme that he needed

47:40.440 --> 47:45.960
using an adenovirus vector which is very similar to Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca

47:47.080 --> 47:52.120
and after it worked for about a week or so of course his immune system attacked his liver he had

47:52.120 --> 47:59.640
acute liver failure and died this hasn't been improved in any way because you're still encroaching

47:59.640 --> 48:05.000
on the same you know barrier and the same immune system that needs to understand the difference

48:05.000 --> 48:10.760
between self and non-self and the moment you start transfecting foreign proteins into parts of your

48:10.760 --> 48:17.560
body the immune system is not up to that challenge that's not a natural that's not a natural question

48:17.560 --> 48:22.600
that the immune system ever has to answer yes and so that's the problem you know there aren't

48:22.600 --> 48:28.040
supposed to be cells in your body that are expressing foreign proteins that's that's if they are they

48:28.040 --> 48:35.720
need to be eliminated and and so anyway I think that's that's probably the best

48:36.840 --> 48:43.640
and the most diabolical part of the rollout because that is pointed to as evidence that the system

48:43.640 --> 48:49.800
works and that when there's a red then when there's a bad signal we pulled it from the market and so

48:49.800 --> 48:54.040
exactly obviously if we didn't pull the mRNA off the market there was no signal

48:54.680 --> 49:00.520
yeah yep it's like it was I'm going to come back to that because I see there's a bigger

49:00.520 --> 49:07.880
sacrifice that I think is coming so J&J gets sacrificed for the good of the agenda all right

49:07.880 --> 49:14.600
so then you know the first big lawsuit that was filed was the remdesivir lawsuit in California

49:15.160 --> 49:21.320
all right and so I have an opinion of that but you have a perspective of the remdesivir lawsuit

49:21.320 --> 49:27.800
was that the one about glass in the bottles no this is that there is a number of families

49:27.800 --> 49:35.480
got together the attorneys filed against Gilead for producing remdesivir because remdesivir

49:35.480 --> 49:44.040
killed their loved ones okay so you know I see the remdesivir lawsuit as what's the best case

49:44.040 --> 49:53.560
scenario you know the best case scenario is Gilead has to pay the people who were killed by

49:54.200 --> 49:59.080
remdesivir assuming it can be proven which you know it's easily proven but I mean you're trapped

49:59.080 --> 50:05.240
in the court system first but assuming that they win what what do they get they get a payment

50:06.120 --> 50:13.320
relative to a drug that killed them it doesn't stop anything because all it is is a the worst case

50:13.320 --> 50:20.680
scenario is a money judgment so I see that as simply another distraction and they're moving on

50:20.680 --> 50:26.600
to substantially worse things while people are thinking you know putting their hopes in a remdesivir

50:26.600 --> 50:33.400
lawsuit one okay I want to move on to one that I'm guessing you that's everything I don't want

50:33.400 --> 50:40.280
you to move on yet I think it's a really interesting um I don't disagree with you at all it's just

50:40.280 --> 50:45.560
the first time I've ever heard anyone characterize there any remdesivir lawsuit could almost fit

50:45.560 --> 50:52.280
into that category exactly if you're going for financial damages which inevitably is what people

50:52.280 --> 50:58.520
go for then you're not solving the problem at all actually and that's that's really interesting

50:59.320 --> 51:05.320
well we structured Grace's lawsuit specifically to go after the people who pulled the trigger

51:05.400 --> 51:11.800
that's why our lawsuit is extremely expensive because we didn't you know the the attorneys just

51:11.800 --> 51:16.680
wanted us to go against Ascension Hospital System because that's where the money is but we named five

51:16.680 --> 51:24.760
doctors and two nurses to make a statement that the people who pulled the trigger are responsible

51:24.760 --> 51:30.840
for pulling the trigger you can't blame the hospital that they loaded the gun somebody still pulled

51:30.840 --> 51:39.320
the trigger and that's the same thing with remdesivir and the reason it's it's true with remdesivir is

51:39.320 --> 51:46.600
because you know you could you could say in the first three weeks four weeks maybe of the hospital

51:46.600 --> 51:55.080
stays that well we didn't know but now you've got the COVID era is 39 months and they're still using

51:55.320 --> 52:01.800
it and it has a 75% kill rate well now you're responsible because you you know nobody is that

52:01.800 --> 52:06.840
dumb to not see the kill rate in the hospital that you work at and same with same thing with

52:06.840 --> 52:12.200
ventilators so you could use remdesivir and ventilators same thing you know you're you're not

52:12.200 --> 52:18.600
you know people are responsible remdesivir is not responsible ventilators and aren't responsible

52:18.600 --> 52:24.040
people are responsible so people have to be held to account that's the only way to you know if

52:24.040 --> 52:29.160
we're going to use the system wow god i've never heard anyone say this it's so extraordinary

52:29.160 --> 52:37.720
to me that i've never heard anyone say this before well i it's not it but i'm just a dad so

52:37.720 --> 52:43.880
anyway i just see the leader you you you have come off to me in our in our previous conversations as

52:43.880 --> 52:51.320
being a guy who has been um meddled with on this and encouraged to go in the wrong direction or

52:51.320 --> 52:56.440
or in a useless direction several times and hearing use is simply describe it this way is

52:56.440 --> 53:01.800
really enlightening to me and it's something that i know i can take and repeat because it makes

53:01.800 --> 53:10.760
perfect sense to me to think this way um i i really like it a lot um and it will also it also i think

53:10.760 --> 53:18.600
this this concept also will put more onus on all of these health care practitioners to understand

53:18.600 --> 53:24.280
what they're doing and to think a little bit more about about their responsibilities to their

53:24.280 --> 53:29.880
patient because right now i think they do kind of hide behind the the you know i'm just part of

53:29.880 --> 53:36.680
the system i just do it i'm told kind of thing yeah yeah i agree all right i want to go through

53:36.680 --> 53:43.880
another one i was asked this one is because i was on a show and they asked me do you think that

53:43.960 --> 53:49.080
there was ever a virus and you know i'm don't have any credentials like you do but i mean the

53:49.480 --> 53:55.080
the research that i have been exposed to i thought no this was this was never a virus

53:55.880 --> 54:01.880
and so the lady who was the host said well what what do you make then of the patents the patents

54:01.880 --> 54:06.920
for the virus i said well how do you know that the patents weren't planted to get us to think that

54:06.920 --> 54:14.120
it was a virus so anyway your perspective on planted patents yeah so that's i i'm right there

54:14.120 --> 54:19.800
with you um i just want i would like to maybe clarify just a little bit to make sure that

54:19.800 --> 54:30.760
the people that are listening um get it uh the the point is uh a rather simple one um

54:30.760 --> 54:36.520
and i'll just you don't have to go away um i'll just use it here uh hold on one second

54:38.920 --> 54:48.440
and this needs to go away and this needs to come back and so i will just use this one slide here and

54:48.440 --> 54:53.480
just show you this picture so this is a little animation of what's supposed to happen inside

54:53.480 --> 54:59.640
of your cell as a virus is assembled this little tiny red string there is supposed to be the genome

54:59.640 --> 55:03.800
of the virus that's wrapped around these bigger pink proteins which are the end protein

55:04.360 --> 55:10.840
and then the virus gets enveloped into this endosome and uh it's going to repeat again now here

55:10.840 --> 55:14.920
so you see again the genome gets packaged around the end protein and then it gets

55:14.920 --> 55:19.960
invaginated into the endosome and the endosome already has spike protein expressed on the inside

55:19.960 --> 55:26.680
of it so then at the end you get this little ball so this is a cartoon which has been given to us

55:26.680 --> 55:32.600
by the pbs news hour and bill gates and all these virologists and because the cartoon is so pretty

55:32.600 --> 55:40.040
and detailed it's very tempting to believe that their their understanding of this process is as

55:40.040 --> 55:47.000
pretty and as detailed and that would be a complete lie um it's important to understand that they

55:48.120 --> 55:54.760
they have a loose idea of how viruses replicate but for example i wonder if anybody in your in

55:54.760 --> 56:00.200
your audience understands that the influenza virus needs to carry an enzyme with it in order

56:00.200 --> 56:06.200
to make copies for itself and a coronavirus supposedly doesn't need an enzyme with it because it makes

56:06.200 --> 56:11.720
its enzyme after it gets inside of your cells already a huge difference that they never talk

56:11.720 --> 56:17.480
about with regard to these viruses but it's very different in their cartoon the reason why this is

56:17.480 --> 56:23.720
important is because the cartoon that they have told you is one where the virus goes into your

56:23.720 --> 56:29.640
lungs and it makes copies of itself and then those copies come out and go to other people but

56:29.640 --> 56:37.960
if you read virology pre-pandemic and you try to understand the phenomenon of RNA viruses you

56:37.960 --> 56:44.200
understand that none of the real virologists on the ground believe that cartoon that the virus

56:44.200 --> 56:50.200
goes into your lungs makes copies of itself and comes back out they understand all kinds of things

56:50.200 --> 56:55.960
are not real about that cartoon they know that the virus can't make copies of itself very well

56:55.960 --> 57:01.240
it's very hard for it to grow in new tissues or to jump from animal to animal in their own

57:02.120 --> 57:08.280
best estimation they can never really find full sequences in the wild and instead they need to

57:08.280 --> 57:13.880
find fragments of it and then fill in the blanks to get a best guess of what this RNA might have

57:13.880 --> 57:19.560
been had they been able to retrieve the whole virus from the bat or from the cave or from whatever

57:19.560 --> 57:24.760
sample they had it in from the sample of the patient and so this important distinction about

57:24.760 --> 57:32.600
what viruses are and what they aren't in a laboratory has been obfuscated since basically AIDS and

57:32.600 --> 57:38.120
they have been using similar techniques that are actually indirect measurements of the presence of

57:38.120 --> 57:44.600
something and never definitively show that this structure is related to this effect or these

57:44.600 --> 57:49.400
proteins are related to this effect but they're all co-present or correlated with

57:50.280 --> 57:55.880
it's never a direct measurement so the most important thing to think about here is whether or not the

57:55.880 --> 58:03.080
virus can make copies of itself and how well it does that because in in RNA virology they can't they

58:03.080 --> 58:08.520
know that they can't and they used to whine about it that RNA viruses are so hard to study because

58:08.520 --> 58:16.200
we can't ever get them to grow and the reason why that is is more because of the aspects of

58:16.200 --> 58:25.720
DNA versus RNA DNA is a double-stranded molecule DNA has a number of enzymes that work together

58:25.720 --> 58:32.840
that can copy it and also proofread the copies RNA is single-stranded most of the time in nature

58:32.840 --> 58:38.200
and most of the time when we use it in our bodies messenger RNA is single-stranded and therefore

58:38.680 --> 58:45.800
if you were to try and copy it you wouldn't have two copies to compare to so proofreading it would

58:45.800 --> 58:51.720
be more difficult and in fact the mechanisms that are used on double-stranded DNA can't be used on

58:51.720 --> 58:57.800
RNA because RNA is single-stranded so coronaviruses are actually single-stranded RNA and if you think

58:57.800 --> 59:04.040
about coronaviruses like a mixtape if you want to make coronaviruses in the laboratory and you

59:04.120 --> 59:09.640
assemble them and you find one you can't make copies of a mixtape over and over and over again

59:09.640 --> 59:15.000
because the tape copies will get more and more terrible nobody will want to use them in headphones

59:15.000 --> 59:21.400
because the sound deteriorates CDs on the other hand can be copied you can share them with your

59:21.400 --> 59:26.200
friends you can and they can make copies of the copies that you made and they don't deteriorate

59:26.200 --> 59:34.680
in in quality this analogy is pretty close to how RNA versus DNA would be copied in any

59:35.480 --> 59:40.840
mammalian or or well eukaryotic system it doesn't matter what biology you're talking about

59:40.840 --> 59:47.720
copying DNA is high fidelity and copying RNA if it's even done his lower fidelity than this

59:47.720 --> 59:54.040
copying process so what that translates to very simply is that RNA virology doesn't work very

59:54.040 --> 01:00:00.360
well in a dish he can't really grow them very often and if you look at these coronavirus papers

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.840
that from all these crazy laboratories that everybody's pointing out has gained a function

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:11.880
you will find that they never can grow the virus they always find the sequence they always reconstruct

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:19.000
the sequence retrieve the sequence and then the sequence is instead translated into DNA

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:28.360
and that DNA then can be used to grow lots of copies like a CD lots of copies of itself

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.760
now if it's a coronavirus they've realized that they have to make it into pieces to make lots

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.320
of copies of it and they reassemble it but that doesn't matter for this purpose it's to understand

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:45.320
that it wouldn't grow in culture but it does they can make a DNA copy of it the nice thing about

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:52.040
this is is that this uses very standard industrial techniques for making any biologic you just grow

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:59.640
it in an E. coli culture the E. coli faithfully makes copies of your DNA after you take the E. coli

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:07.400
out of those cultures you can convert that DNA to RNA and now you have a form of the virus that

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.280
never existed in nature that you couldn't retrieve from the cave that you couldn't pull out of the

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:19.480
bat and it's super pure because it came from one single sequence of DNA that was copied many times

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:29.320
so instead of having a swarm of incomplete RNAs which is the best possible virus model that the

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:37.000
virology experts could be left with at this stage if it's not just all mythology that that still is

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:44.040
is artificially recreated with this process to a purity level and to a quantity that can't

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:49.000
exist anywhere in nature this would allow them to send it around to all their friends so that all

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.280
their friends can do the same experiments using the same RNA and more importantly you could make

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.160
large quantities of this and you could distribute it anywhere you wanted to and wherever you look

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.200
for it you would find it and it wouldn't be variable like one from mother nature it would be pure

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:11.400
the signal would be great the PCR primers would work perfect the the RNA would culture in a dish

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.760
and you would be able to sequence it and report a full sequence unlike any virus that you could

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.480
find in mother nature and the crazy thing is is that they've known that they can do this there's a

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:29.000
paper before the the um I won't go into that now with you there are many papers before the pandemic

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.320
which have tried to look at the replication fidelity of coronaviruses and found this same thing

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.720
that they just don't replicate very well and the best thing that we can do the way that we

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.560
can make the most infectious materials to start with a DNA clone make lots of RNA from that and

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.800
then do all of our experiments from this stock which has nothing to do with whatever phenomenon

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.640
they call SARS-CoV-2 that supposedly came from a laboratory in Wuhan that's the big that's the

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:04.680
big trick that they've pulled on us wow I'm glad you have those slides at your disposal that

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:11.800
they do a fantastic job of explaining and you have a gift at putting words to the slide so thank you

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:18.680
for that I want to move on to one more talking point before we close today which is you know how

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:26.600
they're setting this whole thing up now to be up all about COVID and the setup the first setup was

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:34.120
Congress illegally ended COVID on April 10th of 2023 and if you start looking at everything since

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:41.240
April 10th of 2023 you start seeing uh these are these are purposely the the narratives are

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:48.200
purposely being released to get us to look at we've got to have responsibility for what happened

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:55.720
with COVID and or COVID was we made mistakes but we'll get it right next time that's what's going on

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:03.000
now and I see every headline through that lens and bigger picture so when I think when you and I

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.920
talked a couple weeks ago Jay we talked about the movie sound of freedom so when you watch sound

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.960
of freedom you see you know it was a fine film but then if you look at okay what's really going on

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.960
here well why did it take them five years to release it why didn't they talk about the real

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:33.720
issue which is what's behind the the child trafficking the the killing of children for organs the

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.520
killing of children for the satanic rituals why didn't they talk about that and the real

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.400
clothes the real hook to that movie was right at the end and I saw the hook of course I can't

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.440
watch anything now like I used to because there's no fun in watching it I'm always looking for

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:55.800
the gotcha and the gotcha in that film is the man who it was based on they showed his testimony

01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.920
his live testimony you know wasn't live in the film but his his real testimony in front of congress

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.040
and that congress is making a commitment to end this that we're going to have legislation

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:12.520
oh my gosh congress is in on it congress is in on this whole COVID science so you can't have

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.960
congress do an investigation of itself or pass a law against itself when they're in on it

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:24.760
all right so now that being said we my wife and I watched the movie shot dead and I know the

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:33.320
director and producer of the the documentary she's she's one I believe is trustworthy so I'm not

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:39.080
looking at that film as as bad but it was all about vaccine deaths and injuries and it was it

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:45.000
was well done as soon as I got done with it I said to my wife I said Pfizer is going to be a sacrifice

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:53.080
and I think that's coming we have to have a monster sacrifice so the agenda continues realize the

01:05:53.080 --> 01:06:00.520
agenda is what they're after so if they make a big sacrifice so they sacrifice J&J before I said

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.560
I'm going to come back to that I think Pfizer is going to be a sacrifice to keep the agenda going

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:11.720
so what's going on is you know we've got the election cycle which that diverts 70 percent of

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.040
the population right there but then you know they've reduced gas prices everything's back to normal

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.560
you know that's part of the scyop to get us focused on okay now that COVID's over everything's

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.840
back to normal we've got to have accountability for COVID and I'm going to have Don play a clip

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.840
and tell you why I played and then J.J. I'm going to let you rip on that so go ahead and play the

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:40.200
clip Don we shouldn't be told that we have to take a vaccine speakers at the rally arguing their

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.240
loved ones could still be alive if medical protocols were different during the pandemic

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.080
I think people had to suffer I think many people died that didn't have to they're now calling for

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:56.840
accountability we should not have to worry when we go to our doctor are we going to be on the right

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.840
side of politics it is time that we have an investigation here in Oklahoma there was people

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.680
who've been trained who who are medical positions that should have known better than this and they

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:17.800
have a responsibility to treat patients and not listen to what they know is untrue representative

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.160
Humphrey says the rally is one of the first steps taken to eventually make laws in the state to

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.600
prevent something like this from happening again I appreciate all the doctors and nurses and

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:35.080
the ones who who fought through it worked and at risk of their own life and who did that so

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.320
they're much appreciated this is not any kind of attack on the medical field this is an attack on

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:50.280
how that we allowed politics and money to overtake our medical agencies and medical departments and

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.720
make medical decisions he says next they will request an interim study and collect evidence to

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:06.360
present to the attorney general interestingly his name is JJ Humphrey I just picked up on that

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:13.000
coincidence I met him last this past Saturday I flew to Oklahoma City to speak at the state

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.760
capital for this event and so the local Fox station does this coverage and my wife showed it to me I

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:26.280
didn't know that they had done the coverage she she showed it to me and I instantly said

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:33.400
that is complete bullshit and the reason is just he's got like all you can just listen to these

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:38.200
politicians they go right through the talking point so first I just jotted them down as I was

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.880
listening so first we need to have a choice relative to take the vaccination or not well so you see

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:50.840
that we still are on the vaccination agenda okay vaccinations are it's all a saiap the whole

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.120
vaccination agenda is a saiap then he said that you know we've got to have accountability for

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:02.680
the pandemic we need to have an investigation I mean who's going to investigate this the only

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:09.000
people qualified are guys like you and I Jay and then this is not about the doctors and nurses

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.640
well the heck it isn't I mean those are the people who pulled the trigger so anyway he hit

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:19.080
all the talking points that they're trying to sell us right now so that we can have

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:25.960
accountability and we all buy into okay we got the best government on earth anyway I probably

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:32.360
gave you all the answers already but I still want your perspective no I I don't think I'm even

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:40.120
seeing it as as well as you but I what I'm what I'm most fascinated by now because you're really

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:48.680
getting me excited about it is how do we how can we what is the right idea do you think what we

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:56.840
need to do is I just I'm processing this in real time can we get for example the the doctors

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.760
to turn on their administration then like in other words once you

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.720
make this momentum so that okay now people understand that actually you should blame the doctor

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.720
now the doctor has to say okay well hey wait a minute I was told and I needed now the doctors

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:20.200
got to turn and and up the chain I don't think that's such a bad idea

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.640
essentially it seems like some of these people are suggesting we should skip all those people

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:33.000
and go right to the top of the chain go right for the NIH or something or the CDC instead of

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.840
prosecuting the doctors but I do see your point it's it's extraordinary I was jotting down other

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:52.120
notes so it's a it's a it to me I don't I don't doubt at all do you know who Ted Gunderson is

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:58.760
I don't oh Ted Gunderson is a guy who used to work for the FBI you should look him up

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:08.520
he might not be alive anymore but Ted Gunderson was after the the networks of the sound of freedom

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:15.640
back in the 90s already actually dropped out of the FBI because the FBI wouldn't do anything about it

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.000
and became quite a whistleblower for a long time tour in the United States like just giving away

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.040
packets of information he used to be the head of the FBI on the whole west coast actually

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:34.680
Ted Gunderson the this fight has been going on a long time Ted Gunderson is the guy who woke me up

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:43.720
about some of the the history that I lived through when I was a teenager and I have no doubt in my

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:51.080
mind that that what we experienced over the last four years was an unprecedented level of

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:58.760
of an attempt to invert our understanding of of what reality is and make sure that none of us

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:06.760
had a solid footing that mattered and and that's that's really it's one of those things where I

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.960
still find that the people that are now opposing us Scott are trying very hard to get us to commit

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.640
to one particular explanation when it's a crime scene I'm not supposed to come up with the the

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.800
explanation for how they did it I just know that it's a crime and I know that these people are lying

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:28.120
about what actually happened and your point is really it's really sinking very deep

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.440
and it also makes me kind of sad because I don't know maybe you've you've obviously thought about

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:40.600
it longer than I have what do we if we can't and I agree we probably can't turn to the current

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:47.480
city in Congress is is one possible solution to elect people like you and me should we start

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:53.640
running for office is that a solution or not really yeah it's a great question and it actually

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:59.880
brings up it's I'm going to answer that in the frame of starting to wrap things up sure sure

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.400
you're going to come on my show anyway and we're going to do this again yeah we're going to talk

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:13.000
yeah you'll have another week of process yeah you know the the solutions that are being

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.920
proposed are all man-made so you know having us guys like you and I run for Congress

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:27.800
those type of things are all under I see them all under the false profit system power back to the

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:36.200
people because it doesn't acknowledge how we got here we got here by rejecting God and we can't

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.080
there's nobody going to be held accountable for for the real psi up here you know they're going

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.040
you know if Pfizer is a sacrifice that will look like accountability but it's all to set up you

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.920
know if the false profit system looks like hey we're going to go back to the gold standard we're

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.000
going to have Nuremberg two trials we need to give control back to the people those are all

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.160
great talking points that are being sold right now if you watch you'll see these talking points

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:18.440
are being sold as so a way to say this succinctly is the plant there's there's a plan to take down

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:26.440
the cabal so the cabal we look at okay this whole you know the great reset this is all the cabal

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.640
has got this all set up well the plan to take down the cabal was written by the cabal

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.680
so this really gets people in the right frame of mind for the solution because the solution

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.840
has nothing to do with the proposals that you're hearing the solution

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:51.320
is understanding everything that's happening through a biblical worldview and what God said

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.320
I'm just going to read a scripture reference j in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 10 through 12

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:03.800
it says they perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved for this reason God

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.840
sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.760
who have not believed the truth but delighted in wickedness so I see the powerful delusion I

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:24.120
mean I could be wrong with this but I see the powerful delusion as the anti-Christ evil system

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:31.080
and then the red pill false prophet less evil system the two sides of the satanic coin

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:37.480
are the powerful delusion and it's called the world and we get sucked into that and thinking

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:45.160
men can save us is been around for a long time you know the people who were led directly by God

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.240
the Israelites in first Samuel chapter 8 you know they wanted a king you know and they begged

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:57.000
Samuel give us a king and Samuel pleaded with God and said hey you know what should I do here

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:06.200
and God said give them their king so God won't go against what we what we want and we want a king

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:13.640
we want somebody to save us from this mess and it's already set up anyway so that's what I see I

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.360
think the answer to this is repentance I think covid was a call to repentance

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:25.640
that's how I see it now and I I really can't see it any other way so when I look at Grace's lawsuit

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.440
for example Jay I don't see it about money at all we've already said if we get any money we're not

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:35.960
taking it and that's why we did the more expensive path that's why we didn't haven't taken money

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.320
from people who have offered to sponsor our case it's got to be above reproach we're using the case

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.520
to shed light on evil and that's the purpose of the case and that's why I've been on 800 shows

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:55.960
and I just want to keep sharing so that people can wake up and you have a chance to save yourself

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.920
from a hospital stay of course physically but more importantly to the spiritual message that

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.920
I'm sharing right now so anyway that's my my two cents worth

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:12.120
um it's uh I want you to have the last the last word of course so go out you thought all yours now

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:21.960
um I don't know I don't know how to approach this because I I don't I don't typically um on my show

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:28.440
I don't really talk about um these kinds of issues I try to stay very much a biologist um but I hint

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:35.960
at the idea that that at the heart of my understanding um lies this idea that somewhere

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:43.720
in in all of my work and reading and and investigation I keep running into this

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:51.000
irreducible complexity that that is everything that makes us sacred and and and makes our you

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.200
know we can study biology and bugs and how animals work it's of course you want to understand how

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.480
God's creation is connected and and how it all sings together and what our place is when within

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:10.920
it but but um most of the the impetus for our investigation in academic biology is trying to

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:20.840
undermine that or trying to dispel that as a right as a as a sacred idea and so um I don't know what

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.800
it is about me and my in my being that drew me out of academia but I always knew that what was

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:35.080
going on there wasn't the appreciation of the sacred that I wanted it to be and and instead what it

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:43.000
was was the demystifying of it and the the um the almost uh desecrating of it in many in many labs

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:51.880
um and this took a long time for me to wake up to um and I'm trying my best to craft a message

01:18:51.880 --> 01:19:01.400
which um the presence of of God and Christ is behind me and and visible um without necessarily

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:09.880
me always calling him to to mind by name um and and it's really important um I tell my kids this a

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:15.720
lot I say it to my wife a lot um it's really important that that's there otherwise I don't I

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:23.240
would never have been able to keep um the the hope alive that that what I'm doing might contribute

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:30.520
to something that will keep our grandchildren safe um and and as you've outlined it you know we are

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:37.240
up against it's this is for all the marbles this is from generations past already things are

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.400
are are crescendoing right now in our lifetimes that unfortunately or fortunately

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.440
um it's in our lifetimes that this is happening I mean I I can't tell you how

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.720
awesome it would have been if I would have grown up in the 50s and been a biologist in the 60s um

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:03.240
I would be dying right now as uh as a happy uh go lucky emeritus biologist you know that

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:09.640
that spend his time hiking with his grandkids and and and if I could have gone out in 2019 like

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:15.400
that it wouldn't have been a bad way to go but we we have been chosen to be here um for whatever

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:23.640
reason um and I can't thank you enough for for sharing your story as as often and as widely as

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:32.280
you do it takes a lot of courage and I'm sure um it costs a lot um it's it you know it's uh

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:39.560
well you know it's really it's something really special and I don't I can't imagine losing one

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:45.480
of my children um I'm sure that the reason why I haven't is because I would not have been able to

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.520
and be a good example as a Christian like you are um I probably would have done

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:57.960
or acted much differently and so you're in my prayers man I don't know what to say I feel like

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.520
I'm uh I'm definitely lucky to have ever run into you and cross pass with you so

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.720
I I feel the same I mean I uh

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.840
God gets all the credit here I mean I am shocked at what is inside of me I mean he he truly

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:23.240
um is in charge the coincidences there there's no coincidences all the things that he set up

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:33.880
for a time such as this for me to be active and have no fear in what we're doing and you know

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:40.920
there's there's so many things but it's it's all him so Jay thanks so much for coming on and I will

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.640
see you next week if you just want to hang around for a minute here at the end we'll say goodbye after

01:21:45.640 --> 01:22:01.560
Dan signs us off okay very good

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.320
please stand by for further details we return you now to your regularly scheduled program

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.280
you
