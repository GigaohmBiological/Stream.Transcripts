WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.720 --> 00:38.760
Good morning CHD. I'm clear duly the cinematographer on the CHD bus and today is Friday September 2nd

00:38.760 --> 00:42.200
20 second and we are in Montpelier, Vermont

00:42.960 --> 00:45.600
Today is a travel day. So tomorrow we'll be going to

00:46.640 --> 00:49.400
Concord, New Hampshire, and that's where our next event will be

00:50.080 --> 00:52.040
But if you guys missed it yesterday

00:52.040 --> 00:58.280
there was a story of a girl who was seven years old her name was Kaylin and she was

00:59.000 --> 01:04.280
She died after she received a flu shot and her mother came on to the bus the first time around and

01:04.760 --> 01:08.920
Told her story and so she came back to the bus to tell her story. So if you guys missed that

01:09.440 --> 01:12.560
You can find it on our website at CHG

01:13.720 --> 01:18.000
TV forward slash bus or on Twitter at CHG bus

01:18.680 --> 01:20.680
And we're playing a Roku too

01:21.080 --> 01:25.400
So coming up is let's see we're gonna have a couple new stops

01:25.400 --> 01:29.440
So we have September 25th. We'll be in Augusta, Maine

01:30.000 --> 01:35.840
And then once again, sorry going back September 23rd, which is tomorrow. We're gonna be in Concord, New Hampshire

01:35.840 --> 01:38.200
It's September 25th. We're gonna be in Augusta, Maine

01:38.880 --> 01:41.960
September 27th, we're gonna be in Boston, Massachusetts and

01:42.400 --> 01:46.600
September 29th we're gonna be in Providence, Rhode Island and October 1st

01:46.600 --> 01:48.400
We're gonna be in Plainfield, Connecticut

01:48.400 --> 01:54.480
So if you go to CHG TV for slash bus you can find all these locations and where we're gonna be and

01:54.640 --> 01:56.640
And we'd love to see you guys

01:57.240 --> 02:05.600
Today coming up next is a CDC's advisory committee will meet to discuss maternal RSV vaccine safety and surveillance

02:05.880 --> 02:08.000
Dr. Marilyn Nass will be live blogging

02:08.000 --> 02:12.080
So don't miss it the entire meeting from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time

02:12.080 --> 02:14.720
So tune in on our events page plus

02:15.240 --> 02:20.400

02:20.560 --> 02:26.200
Tune in to know the facts and get informed with doctors lawyers and parents of the injured

02:27.840 --> 02:29.200
Thank you so much you guys

02:29.200 --> 02:34.840
Please just keep in touch with the bus keep on watching the stories that are coming out our editors are working really hard to get you guys

02:34.840 --> 02:38.500
Some some compilations of what we're seeing in the road about COVID hospital protocols

02:38.920 --> 02:42.200
Vaccine injuries COVID vaccine injuries and vaccine deaths

02:42.960 --> 02:48.640
And yeah coming up next is doctors and scientists with JJ Cooey and Dr. Brian Hooker

02:48.800 --> 02:50.800
Thanks so much you guys have a great day

02:50.800 --> 02:52.800
You

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
You

03:16.960 --> 03:22.640
Well good morning CHD and welcome to this episode of doctors and scientists

03:22.880 --> 03:24.880
I'm so excited for

03:25.560 --> 03:32.480
Children's health defense new addition Dr. J. Cooey Dr. Jonathan J. Cooey

03:33.600 --> 03:36.800
We were able to get him as a

03:38.080 --> 03:45.560
Refugee from the University of Pittsburgh. I don't know if I'm describing that right, but welcome to the show Jay and tell us a little bit about your background

03:45.840 --> 03:48.320
Hey, thanks very much for having me Brian

03:48.320 --> 03:50.320
I'm it's a real honor to

03:50.600 --> 03:55.880
To have joined CHD and to be working with you, and it's really special to be on the show now

03:55.880 --> 04:00.840
I was a research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh in

04:01.920 --> 04:03.920
2020 and I

04:04.000 --> 04:06.720
Had trouble following the protocols and I had trouble

04:08.440 --> 04:12.960
Keeping my cool about certain things when people would tell me to read the New York Times, etc

04:12.960 --> 04:19.160
And I had a boss or an supervisor that didn't quite think the same way in fact

04:19.760 --> 04:25.040
War more than one mask at times. Oh my and so at some point

04:25.040 --> 04:30.160
I was notified by email that they didn't feel comfortable with me coming into the lab anymore

04:30.160 --> 04:36.280
And so they basically paid me out till the end of my contract and then it wasn't extended and if you know how

04:37.160 --> 04:40.840
Academia works if you can't get a recommendation from your previous job

04:40.840 --> 04:46.720
It's gonna be pretty hard to move on I decided to keep my YouTube channel going which I had started originally for

04:46.960 --> 04:50.840
For a journal club on a bike with with my neuroscience students

04:51.600 --> 04:57.600
I I just kept going with with teaching immunology and and trying to

04:58.560 --> 05:02.840
advocate for natural immunity and at some point

05:04.400 --> 05:08.800
During the the first year of the pandemic I saw Bill Gates

05:09.840 --> 05:13.800
Give a discussion or or an explanation on a lighted table

05:13.800 --> 05:16.600
about how they were going to use RNA to

05:17.400 --> 05:23.080
Make your body into a vaccine factory and it dawned on me in in a moment

05:23.920 --> 05:29.000
that we were using the same technology in our mice for a lot of our experiments and

05:29.440 --> 05:35.320
That they had just turned this around and said that they could inject it in people's arms in and this would work fine

05:35.320 --> 05:40.040
And it it blew me away and so before I was

05:40.600 --> 05:46.520
Asked not to come in anymore. I had several encounters with people at the University of Pittsburgh who also used

05:46.920 --> 05:52.200
Transfection in their lab and I tried to ask them, you know, do you understand that their?

05:52.680 --> 05:54.680
The new vaccines are really just

05:55.240 --> 05:57.240
Transfections. They're going to

05:57.240 --> 06:04.680
Transfect people that seems crazy to me and these people were were seemed very confident that they must have figured out how to make it work correctly

06:04.680 --> 06:08.000
because otherwise they wouldn't do this right and I

06:08.480 --> 06:10.480
Wasn't convinced and I

06:12.000 --> 06:18.400
After I was asked not to come in I had eight more months of my salary and so I continued to to work on this stuff and

06:19.840 --> 06:26.480
Long story short I got enough support from my viewers that I kept going for the whole year of 2021

06:27.440 --> 06:29.440
And now in

06:29.440 --> 06:31.680
2022 Bobby called me and asked me to help him

06:32.080 --> 06:34.560
Robert F Kennedy jr. Excuse me asked me to call

06:35.040 --> 06:40.080
Asked me to help him with his book the Wuhan book, which is coming out. I don't know sometime this fall

06:41.040 --> 06:42.400
and

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
At the end of that little consultation

06:45.360 --> 06:49.760
Then now I was lucky enough to have chd all for me a position. So here I am

06:51.760 --> 07:02.240
Well, thank you so much for that and and I I really you know, you are so good at distilling science down and making it

07:02.880 --> 07:06.880
Understandable, you know, you started out with your youtube channel

07:07.440 --> 07:13.520
And you've continued on you've continued on with that breakdown. You've you've used several terms

07:14.720 --> 07:16.720
Breakdown what you mean by

07:17.100 --> 07:26.640
Transfection and what what does a transfection vehicle look like when say you're doing some type of genetic modification of mice in the lab?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.800
Sure, so

07:28.800 --> 07:30.800
the typical use

07:30.800 --> 07:33.440
That I would have in the laboratory. What is a real

07:34.160 --> 07:37.920
Interesting use case that would take an hour to really describe but

07:38.560 --> 07:43.920
Um, the gist of it is is that you can modify neurons in the brain of a mouse

07:44.800 --> 07:50.480
By expressing proteins that wouldn't normally be there. Right. Um, and in

07:51.280 --> 07:58.800
In the case of optogenetics, which is a which is an in vitro and in vivo technique that's used in a lot of mouse and rat experiments

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
Um, you can express an algae

08:02.240 --> 08:08.880
Protein in the neurons and an algae protein is what you think it is. It is a protein from algae

08:09.520 --> 08:11.760
Um, but this happens to be a protein which

08:12.480 --> 08:18.880
Um is responsive to blue light in such a way that where whichever neurons are expressing the algal protein

08:19.440 --> 08:22.880
If you shine blue light on them their activity will increase

08:23.440 --> 08:25.680
Oh, okay. That basically means that

08:26.480 --> 08:27.680
You can

08:27.680 --> 08:33.360
Control neurons in the brain to a certain extent and so you could turn on certain kinds of neurons

08:33.840 --> 08:37.200
You could turn on certain neurons in certain places and they're actually

08:38.160 --> 08:43.920
Manipulations of this kind of protein where you can turn neurons off and so neuroscience has been using

08:44.960 --> 08:46.160
just the

08:46.160 --> 08:48.800
Just injecting into a location of the brain

08:49.360 --> 08:53.200
and expressing these proteins and using them as kind of uh

08:54.000 --> 09:00.240
A kind of a lesion in the sense that if you turn on the blue light and all the neurons in that location turn off

09:00.960 --> 09:05.040
It's kind of similar to taking that part of the brain out of the equation

09:05.600 --> 09:09.040
But in the old days you would have to do it by by breaking it or

09:09.520 --> 09:11.520
Right drawing it and here

09:12.240 --> 09:14.240
With the expression of an algal protein

09:14.720 --> 09:18.720
You can take neurons in and out of the equation while the animals alive

09:19.360 --> 09:21.360
And then sacrifice the animal

09:21.840 --> 09:26.560
Dissect the brain and really look at what neurons were you turning on and off?

09:27.280 --> 09:30.640
And you can see that in serial experiments you can start to kind of

09:31.200 --> 09:39.680
Maybe in a certain controlled experiment start to figure out what certain neurons are doing during certain behaviors. Okay. Now the trick is

09:41.120 --> 09:43.280
Is that when you transfect these neurons?

09:44.240 --> 09:53.040
In order for you to go back into the mouse and see these neurons inadequately or accurately rather characterized their anatomical location

09:53.920 --> 09:55.920
You need them to be present

09:56.720 --> 10:00.960
In the animal when you sacrifice them and prepare prepare their brain

10:01.520 --> 10:04.880
But because these neurons are expressing a foreign protein

10:05.440 --> 10:07.840
Inevitably what will happen is one of two things

10:08.800 --> 10:14.320
Either the neuron will express too much of this protein and the protein itself will become toxic

10:14.880 --> 10:16.000
Because

10:16.000 --> 10:21.920
It draws all of the material away from what should be normal expression of all kinds of other

10:22.480 --> 10:26.160
proteins during homeostasis the other thing that can happen is that the

10:26.800 --> 10:33.600
Internal immune system of the brain will just clear that neuron out because it's expressing a foreign protein and it shouldn't be

10:34.400 --> 10:38.800
Um, what this results in is that in these early experiments

10:39.520 --> 10:41.520
with transfection

10:42.000 --> 10:47.120
Anybody that's using it in this case neurobiologists had to learn the window of time

10:47.760 --> 10:54.720
Where you could still sacrifice the animal and have all of the neurons intact before the immune system clear it or before

10:55.440 --> 11:00.080
The toxicity of the transfection would take over and that tends to be about

11:00.800 --> 11:02.800
Six weeks

11:02.800 --> 11:04.480
and so

11:04.480 --> 11:08.400
The first thing that I started arguing about in the hallways with some of my

11:09.120 --> 11:12.560
My fellow faculty members was but what do you think is going to happen?

11:13.280 --> 11:15.040
If you transfect

11:15.040 --> 11:20.480
An old lady with a spike protein and it doesn't stay in her arm and it goes throughout her body

11:20.960 --> 11:22.880
What happens to those cells?

11:22.880 --> 11:26.640
They're all going to get attacked by the immune system. This can't be a good idea

11:27.600 --> 11:28.960
and again

11:28.960 --> 11:34.240
It's just one of these things where some people just hadn't really thought it through and and other people just had this

11:34.960 --> 11:36.160
real

11:36.160 --> 11:37.680
sort of

11:37.680 --> 11:42.240
misplaced trust that somehow, you know, they must have checked and that this would this work out

11:42.800 --> 11:44.240
um

11:44.240 --> 11:46.240
And so that's that's the

11:46.240 --> 11:52.000
The gist of using it in in an animal is the sense that it's a tool with an understanding

11:52.640 --> 11:54.560
That there's a huge limit

11:54.560 --> 11:57.120
as to how useful it could be and you're using it as a

11:57.920 --> 12:04.240
In a way that you you use wood to build the birdhouse and we're not talking about some kind of uh

12:05.600 --> 12:08.480
We're not talking about augmenting a healthy immune system

12:08.560 --> 12:12.240
And we're talking about using and using a a set of tools

12:12.880 --> 12:19.040
To study how a mouse brain works right um and so it's a very different kind of

12:20.320 --> 12:26.320
It's a very different kind of objective with a very different endpoint and so it was extraordinary to me that they were

12:27.120 --> 12:30.880
Taking this and calling it a therapeutic that could be applied to healthy humans

12:31.920 --> 12:35.440
Exactly, you know, I love the way that you broke that down and

12:36.000 --> 12:41.680
When you're when you're looking at the component of the mRNA vaccine

12:42.240 --> 12:49.120
And the component of what you would do in transfection. I'm you know, I was older in molecular biology

12:49.120 --> 12:51.600
And we used to use a substance called gene juice

12:52.240 --> 12:53.120
um

12:53.120 --> 12:56.000
And then it's been I think it's been around for a while

12:56.400 --> 13:01.120
And but it was a liposomal substance that you know, basically

13:02.240 --> 13:07.920
Seemed a lot like the lipid nanoparticle that was being used in

13:08.640 --> 13:11.680
You know in essentially in transfection of people

13:12.400 --> 13:18.320
Are the same components in what you did for genetic engineering? Are they similar to the components in the vaccine?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.880
So interestingly, it's a great question

13:21.600 --> 13:28.320
Our components are much closer to the first two vaccines that came out in that we usually use an identifier as carrier

13:28.880 --> 13:30.320
Oh, okay

13:30.320 --> 13:33.840
And so that was also at the time if you will recall

13:34.560 --> 13:39.360
AstraZeneca and johnson and johnson were the first ones that kind of came out and so

13:40.160 --> 13:42.160
There was even more parallel

13:42.480 --> 13:44.800
between what they were doing in the uk with

13:45.920 --> 13:47.680
AstraZeneca

13:47.680 --> 13:53.120
And our work in the lab, I mean they're the same thing. It was like adenovirus

13:53.760 --> 13:57.600
25 and you know, we use adenovirus 27 or something it's it was

13:58.320 --> 14:00.160
Really spectacularly close

14:00.880 --> 14:05.920
And so it was really easy in my mind to think you know this this can't be

14:08.080 --> 14:12.560
That and it took a long time brian don't get me wrong. I I was a neuroscientist and

14:13.200 --> 14:16.480
The neuroscientist, you know, you know a lot of things about a very narrow

14:17.280 --> 14:19.440
Toolbox of stuff. Oh, sure. Right. All right

14:20.240 --> 14:22.480
It took me a lot of reading and a lot of time to

14:23.200 --> 14:27.440
To get to the stage where I was confident enough to talk about this immunology and with

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
with the gusto to argue about it

14:30.320 --> 14:31.520
um

14:31.520 --> 14:36.400
But in the end it was definitely what needed to be done because there with all of the

14:37.200 --> 14:44.160
the faculty and at pit that were in the department of neurobiology. I've heard from absolutely no one

14:44.880 --> 14:45.360
um

14:45.360 --> 14:46.960
Since I was let go

14:46.960 --> 14:48.000
So either

14:48.000 --> 14:51.760
Maybe there's a combination of nobody paying attention or nobody looking into it

14:52.240 --> 14:57.680
But I find that very hard to believe. I think most of them are still fully on board with the idea that somehow

14:58.800 --> 15:00.160
This is okay

15:00.160 --> 15:04.000
You put it in a vial you call it a vaccine and somehow magically

15:04.560 --> 15:10.640
Then it's not going to do the same thing and these were animals that you were preparing that you you basically

15:11.520 --> 15:16.640
Were and correct me if I'm wrong you're irreversibly changing in there were neurons

15:17.040 --> 15:21.840
And so the ultimate trajectory would be you know, you might do some behavioral tests or whatever

15:22.160 --> 15:28.640
But you were sacrificing the animals and then and then uh, you know doing biopsies of the brains correct correct

15:28.720 --> 15:32.800
And actually I can give you another anecdotal story that'll kind of bring this into focus

15:33.440 --> 15:36.800
Um while I was at the university of pittsburgh, I also assisted

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
with monkey application

15:39.680 --> 15:44.320
Okay, um and the reason why this is important for the viewers that don't know

15:45.280 --> 15:52.080
Monkeys are very different kind of laboratory animal because of the the ethic ethical issues surrounding them

15:52.800 --> 15:58.320
It might not seem like it formed the perspective of people outside of academic research

15:58.400 --> 16:03.440
But there is a sort of hierarchy that that academic biologists think about

16:03.920 --> 16:07.200
And we don't worry too much about the ethics of using trisophila

16:07.840 --> 16:13.920
Um, we worry a little bit more about the ethics of using mice and we certainly don't want mice to suffer

16:14.640 --> 16:15.600
um

16:15.600 --> 16:18.400
On the other hand if a mouse needs to be

16:19.040 --> 16:21.680
sacrificed in order to look at the anatomy of the brain

16:22.160 --> 16:25.920
That's cannot considered to be at all some kind of crazy idea

16:26.480 --> 16:31.520
Um as you go up higher into this higher arcade of animals

16:32.000 --> 16:33.920
You don't use a monkey

16:33.920 --> 16:35.840
For anatomy anymore

16:35.840 --> 16:42.560
You wait until the monkey is all given you 10 years of experiments perhaps and before you're going to do that

16:43.120 --> 16:44.080
um

16:44.080 --> 16:46.080
and so in the case of

16:46.320 --> 16:48.080
of

16:48.080 --> 16:51.280
Up to genetics in monkeys. It's very important to

16:52.080 --> 16:53.840
sort of have a monkey that's at the

16:54.720 --> 16:56.480
The end of its service

16:56.480 --> 17:01.200
Right where you're already planning. Okay. This is the last experiment. So now we can do this

17:01.840 --> 17:05.680
and so we did this um in conjunction with another lab there

17:06.480 --> 17:07.840
and

17:07.840 --> 17:09.280
against

17:09.280 --> 17:16.160
Not necessarily against my advice, but in light of my advice where I said you have about six weeks

17:16.240 --> 17:17.920
And then we really need to

17:17.920 --> 17:20.560
Sacrifice the animal your anatomy won't be clean

17:21.360 --> 17:23.360
um, and they went 12

17:23.760 --> 17:28.880
And basically when we did the anatomy and we made slices of the brain the places where we had

17:29.520 --> 17:31.360
Hoped to see

17:31.360 --> 17:35.840
fluorescently labeled neurons right um, we just saw empty

17:36.560 --> 17:39.120
um, and there was fragments of of

17:40.000 --> 17:45.840
Of fluorescent material so you can see that that something was there. So the immune system had attacked

17:46.320 --> 17:51.600
Yeah, well, we can't really tell for sure. It was either that right to die from overexpressing a protein

17:52.080 --> 17:56.160
Right, right because we're driving it pretty hard. I mean, it's not a

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
You know, that may be the one

17:59.040 --> 18:02.080
Thing that they have they have changed a little bit, but

18:02.720 --> 18:04.560
you know, basically

18:04.560 --> 18:09.600
A transfection product is designed to produce as much protein as possible

18:10.160 --> 18:15.280
Um, it's not some kind of you know, dose thing that they goes really slow over weeks

18:15.280 --> 18:18.960
It's it's usually optimized for maximum protein production

18:19.600 --> 18:23.680
And that seems to be what they did here with with the mRNA as well

18:24.560 --> 18:26.560
And so that means that at some point the

18:27.120 --> 18:31.520
Be inevitable conclusion is is that it will reach toxic levels because the cell can't

18:32.160 --> 18:34.320
Process that much extra

18:34.320 --> 18:35.840
Foreign protein

18:35.840 --> 18:41.360
Exactly. I had did a previous interview with p.r. Corey and he had indicated

18:42.000 --> 18:44.960
that um, the experiments that have been done

18:45.600 --> 18:50.080
Tracing the expression of the spike protein and vaccinated individuals

18:50.640 --> 18:54.400
Showed that for as long as the duration of the experiment some of the subjects

18:54.400 --> 18:58.000
We're still expressing spike protein for as long as six months

18:58.480 --> 19:03.120
Post vaccination and he then he talked about long covid and covid vaccine injury

19:03.440 --> 19:08.000
Where some just look like they were going to produce spike protein for the rest of their lives

19:08.400 --> 19:10.560
Is that feasible and how would that work?

19:11.600 --> 19:17.680
It is it is in theory feasible. I mean that the first part is you know

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
How long lived is the RNA?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.160
You don't really know

19:22.160 --> 19:23.440
um

19:23.440 --> 19:27.360
The other part that that gets a little more frightening is whether or not

19:27.920 --> 19:29.920
There are certain tissues

19:29.920 --> 19:36.240
In the body which would have a propensity for integration and continued expression which would which would be the

19:37.040 --> 19:38.080
the

19:38.080 --> 19:42.160
The worst case scenario that you're thinking of where you really have expression forever

19:42.640 --> 19:44.640
And that's really the trouble here brian

19:45.040 --> 19:47.040
we are

19:47.040 --> 19:49.040
Pretending as though we understand

19:49.520 --> 19:52.640
How protein expression is orchestrated throughout the body

19:53.120 --> 19:54.960
And in reality we

19:54.960 --> 20:00.560
Their only sales pitch is that our body uses RNA to make protein and so it's fine

20:01.040 --> 20:02.720
But in reality

20:02.720 --> 20:06.720
How each individual tissue type uses RNA

20:07.440 --> 20:10.400
And how each individual tissue type expresses

20:11.040 --> 20:13.200
And and orchestrates their ribosomes

20:13.760 --> 20:17.760
This is all different and so at the same RNA molecule

20:18.320 --> 20:22.000
Landing in different tissues could have different results in one tissue

20:22.480 --> 20:26.400
It might produce almost no protein in another tissue it might produce

20:26.880 --> 20:33.200
A lot of protein that's unfolded in another tissue it might produce the perfect viral protein

20:33.680 --> 20:37.520
But produce it for only a minute and it's any number

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
of possibilities that

20:40.560 --> 20:48.000
Have not been adequately understood or or or investigated and instead we've been sold the idea that it's all fine

20:49.360 --> 20:56.640
Exactly and um when you when you break it down, let me let me ask you a technical question really quickly about the

20:57.040 --> 21:00.000
genetic modification that you use for mice

21:00.560 --> 21:04.720
Um, is it always episomal or do you see integration?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.400
Or is that something you never check we know we would never check

21:08.720 --> 21:10.400
Um

21:10.400 --> 21:14.880
No, because the mice are always I mean always sacrifice because you always

21:15.680 --> 21:17.280
the one

21:17.280 --> 21:19.280
the the beauty of this

21:19.280 --> 21:20.720
technique

21:20.720 --> 21:22.640
Is that you get

21:22.640 --> 21:23.520
both

21:23.520 --> 21:28.720
The control of neurons and you can there are advanced ways of doing it so that you can

21:29.280 --> 21:34.320
Express this algal protein in neurons that have a specific gene

21:34.960 --> 21:39.120
So that means inhibitory or excitatory neurons, but it even means more

21:39.920 --> 21:44.720
Um, you can express, you know, only in in basal ganglia

21:45.600 --> 21:47.440
Intern neurons with somatostatin

21:48.160 --> 21:50.240
um, and then really

21:50.240 --> 21:53.520
Mess with them in real time with a light going through the skull

21:54.160 --> 21:59.360
Um, and then when you do the experiment correctly, you'll get an anatomical

22:00.080 --> 22:01.520
three-dimensional

22:01.520 --> 22:03.760
Reconstruction of the neurons that you

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
Transpected so

22:06.320 --> 22:07.440
that

22:07.440 --> 22:10.960
That is the goal. Um, and in that sense

22:11.920 --> 22:13.760
integration

22:13.760 --> 22:15.760
Does it matter? I mean

22:16.080 --> 22:22.880
As long as they get this beautiful anatomy and uh, the neurons are intact when they when they make uh when they make the sacrifice

22:23.760 --> 22:25.040
Um

22:25.040 --> 22:29.120
Yeah, we have it. I don't think many people have looked into it. I don't think anyone's looked into it

22:29.520 --> 22:34.320
Right, right and well and and exactly you know, but but the thing about doing

22:35.360 --> 22:36.960
that type of

22:36.960 --> 22:42.240
Molecular genetics and population dynamics is almost that if something could happen

22:43.120 --> 22:46.400
It will it will from a statistical perspective

22:46.880 --> 22:51.280
Now now correct me if i'm wrong. I mean, you know, because I go out on a lemon lot my show

22:51.920 --> 22:56.240
They're not breeding you understand that right? They're not breeding. It's all uh, yeah

22:56.880 --> 22:58.880
Right right not breeding but

22:58.880 --> 23:03.440
But you know if you're if you're providing enough genetic material that you could be

23:04.240 --> 23:05.520
Transfecting

23:05.520 --> 23:07.520
Uh, many many cells

23:08.080 --> 23:14.800
Then the statistical possibility that one gets you know in one of the cells gets integrated

23:15.520 --> 23:18.320
That that's a possibility and that that could happen

23:18.640 --> 23:22.320
I'm just looking at this from a standpoint of trying to interpret the fact

23:22.880 --> 23:29.600
That someone some people that are being measured they're looking at an antibody based assay an antibody for

23:30.080 --> 23:33.280
uh, an IgG for a spike protein and

23:34.000 --> 23:37.440
What dr. Kory had said was that they just consistently

23:38.240 --> 23:41.760
Show that they're producing that particular antibody

23:42.240 --> 23:48.000
At a sort of a semi-quantitative level that would suggest that they're still producing spike protein

23:48.400 --> 23:52.000
We were told that that expression was going to be

23:52.640 --> 23:56.800
Reserve for the upper arm and it was going to last for about two weeks

23:58.240 --> 24:05.360
No, I mean there is no doubt that that what we were told and what is what is was going to happen was definitely different and

24:06.000 --> 24:09.520
That was part of my motivation for speaking out. I I knew that

24:10.720 --> 24:17.360
That that's what happens. Um, I mean in the in the in the neurons in the brain you can even see secondarily infected

24:18.480 --> 24:23.040
Are transfected neurons in the sense of even when some of the earliest

24:23.760 --> 24:27.520
Transfected neurons die there are still dimmer less

24:28.320 --> 24:32.240
Fully expressing neurons that are present and so you can see this

24:32.960 --> 24:38.160
Sort of time course of the damage that's done just by this over expression of a foreign protein and

24:38.880 --> 24:40.480
I think that

24:40.480 --> 24:42.480
more than anything else the

24:42.720 --> 24:46.480
The the people that are listening need to understand that there's a compounding

24:47.280 --> 24:50.240
Um, set of dangers here because number one

24:51.200 --> 24:55.360
If transfection was made in a craft brewery

24:56.480 --> 24:57.920
master

24:57.920 --> 24:58.880
class

24:58.880 --> 25:00.480
Baker style

25:00.480 --> 25:04.000
The best ingredients the best quality control

25:04.560 --> 25:09.600
It would still be inappropriate to augment a healthy immune system. Now on top of that

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
We have gone from

25:12.480 --> 25:17.040
Making nanograms on a bench to making kilograms in a factory

25:17.760 --> 25:23.840
Right and the the quality control that you can do on those kinds of volumes is much different

25:24.560 --> 25:30.560
Um, and so the potential for the rna to be impure is very high, which means you'll have all kinds of

25:31.280 --> 25:33.280
fragmented proteins expressed

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
Which we don't know what would happen to

25:36.320 --> 25:37.600
um

25:38.080 --> 25:45.600
The the newest news is that there's also the dna construct that was used to generate the rna that's still present as a contaminant

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And that's a whole nother

25:48.000 --> 25:49.040
set of

25:49.040 --> 25:50.800
of i don't knows

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
Um that are definitely not good

25:53.120 --> 25:57.200
And that could be a problem forever because they've always had this issue of

25:57.760 --> 26:01.600
Of separating dna from rna. It's never going to be totally perfect

26:02.240 --> 26:03.600
and then this all

26:03.600 --> 26:05.040
discards the

26:05.120 --> 26:10.080
countless other possible contaminants that come from from manufacturing at that scale

26:12.480 --> 26:18.880
Wow, I mean, you know, it's it's I like I like the way that you've just kind of put this layer upon layer

26:19.520 --> 26:21.760
Tell me about the

26:21.760 --> 26:27.200
Types of immune responses that you would see now from from my understanding

26:27.280 --> 26:33.680
And I I don't know as much about the adenovirus vector vaccines as I do about the messenger rna vaccines

26:34.160 --> 26:40.000
But from my understanding, um, the spike protein itself is a membrane bound protein

26:40.080 --> 26:44.320
And so it's it's on it's it's embedded in the membrane of the cell

26:44.880 --> 26:49.440
And then it is the the business end of it is extracellular. Is that correct?

26:49.760 --> 26:51.120
Yes, that's correct

26:51.120 --> 26:55.360
one of the things to keep in mind which which is really important about this this

26:55.660 --> 26:57.440
Transspection is that

26:57.440 --> 27:00.560
As you said, it's a membrane bound protein. So the ideal

27:01.440 --> 27:08.000
Transspection if it works exactly like it's supposed to work on the package exactly like it says in the little cartoon in the fold out thing

27:08.320 --> 27:11.440
Right then this would be the sequence of the rna

27:12.400 --> 27:17.200
And the sequence of the rna will be translated into a sequence of the protein, right?

27:17.520 --> 27:18.160
Right

27:18.160 --> 27:22.800
You got to remember of the the viewers have to remember that the protein will be folded

27:23.360 --> 27:28.240
As it moves out of the ribosome and that final folded shape

27:28.720 --> 27:33.520
Is the functional shape of the spike protein and that's actually really important

27:34.320 --> 27:40.080
Because when the body makes antibodies, it's making antibodies to the electrostatic shape

27:40.640 --> 27:43.360
Of the protein in this three-dimensional form

27:43.920 --> 27:44.960
Right

27:44.960 --> 27:49.040
Not to epitopes that could be identified on the sequence line

27:49.680 --> 27:52.960
Of the protein now if every one of your pro

27:53.600 --> 27:57.360
Every one of your tissues could potentially fold the protein differently

27:57.920 --> 28:00.960
Then that means every one of your tissues could create a different set

28:01.440 --> 28:08.160
Of three-dimensional epitopes that your immune system would respond to which may not always necessarily be relevant to the virus

28:08.720 --> 28:09.920
Right

28:09.920 --> 28:14.800
And that was what would make an impure rna even more dangerous or

28:15.680 --> 28:17.840
The idea that the pseudo uridine

28:18.720 --> 28:22.080
Changes that have been made to it can result in spontaneous

28:23.040 --> 28:25.920
Stop codons or misread up codons

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
And so then you'll have shortened

28:28.560 --> 28:35.280
Sequences that won't be folded correctly and again will be presenting the incorrect epitopes to the immune system

28:36.160 --> 28:41.360
So from a standpoint of of immunology, then you know, you're you're not creating

28:42.000 --> 28:48.640
Uh, you're not creating antibodies to the to the actual spike or there are enough contaminants that you're getting

28:49.040 --> 28:54.720
Sort of a full milieu of antibodies some that are maybe worthwhile some that are worthless

28:55.200 --> 28:58.320
What happens beyond that? What about cellular immune response?

28:58.560 --> 29:01.440
You know when you know one of the things I get concerned about

29:01.920 --> 29:08.560
And looking especially at a lot of the cardiac damage is that all these spike proteins are hanging out of the cardiac muscle

29:09.040 --> 29:12.560
And and they're just waiting for a tax. So would you know

29:13.520 --> 29:17.280
What would what would cellular immunity do to

29:18.080 --> 29:20.640
The cells that are expressing the spike proteins

29:21.440 --> 29:28.800
Well, I mean it's in the worst case scenarios app obtosis the best case scenario from inflammation, but that doesn't seem to be likely to me

29:29.440 --> 29:30.480
Um

29:30.480 --> 29:32.720
I think what what people should consider

29:33.520 --> 29:35.600
Is the action of the

29:37.040 --> 29:42.400
The action of the liposome or the liposomes what they are but leave you want to call them lip and nanoparticles

29:42.720 --> 29:44.000
Right

29:44.000 --> 29:46.160
The lip and nanoparticles the action of them

29:46.880 --> 29:50.240
Is going to occur where capillaries come to be the narrowest

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
and you have to think of

29:53.360 --> 29:57.600
It's hard to imagine this if you're not imagining this all the time, but the surface area

29:58.320 --> 30:01.520
Of all of the capillaries in your body is immense

30:02.080 --> 30:04.480
That's the most likely place where

30:05.200 --> 30:10.000
The the lip and nanoparticles going to come in contact with a membrane and it's going to pass through

30:10.720 --> 30:15.280
So the most likely secondary target maybe even the primary target of these

30:16.160 --> 30:19.520
These lip and nanoparticles going to be endothelial cells somewhere

30:20.240 --> 30:23.200
Um, and when endothelial cells express the spike protein

30:23.680 --> 30:26.640
They're going to express the spike protein out into the plasma

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
Right makes it very likely

30:30.880 --> 30:36.160
Shot after shot. This is why why secret bhakti and michael eden have said it would get so bad

30:36.560 --> 30:40.400
Is because on the first shot you don't have very many antibodies

30:40.960 --> 30:45.040
To the the funny new protein that's sticking out of your endothelial cells

30:45.600 --> 30:50.080
Right, just to might recognize it it might attack some of those endothelial cells

30:50.560 --> 30:55.200
Present this spike protein to t and v cells and maybe make some antibodies

30:55.600 --> 31:00.640
But the second time you get transvected and you have antibodies in circulation

31:01.040 --> 31:04.880
If those cells express the spike protein and antibody binds

31:05.520 --> 31:07.520
Now you can get instantaneous

31:08.160 --> 31:10.400
Uh, cytotoxicity from

31:10.480 --> 31:15.920
Cytotoxic t cells natural killer cells all of them can read that and then the worst part is

31:16.480 --> 31:19.440
Is that antibodies can cause the deposition of compliment?

31:19.920 --> 31:24.000
And so that means that you can start to have clotting happen and if that

31:24.560 --> 31:26.000
occurs

31:26.000 --> 31:28.880
In any of these capillary beds then you're going to have this

31:29.520 --> 31:34.320
Ongoing potential every time the spike protein is that you're exposed to it

31:34.640 --> 31:37.040
You could potentially have a clotting cascade occur

31:37.760 --> 31:42.640
And that's what sucrabakti has been calling these microclots. Right essentially

31:43.520 --> 31:50.160
It's happening on a on a microscopic scale, but at any point in time it could it could cascade into a full-on

31:50.640 --> 31:52.640
You know stroke type event

31:53.040 --> 31:54.400
Absolutely

31:54.400 --> 32:00.720
And I I love the way that you you've broken that down and explained that now the ramifications though

32:01.360 --> 32:04.240
Uh, you know and and I love the whole analogy

32:04.640 --> 32:07.760
You know or or talking about the surface area of the capillaries

32:07.920 --> 32:15.200
It makes so much sense that that's where the payload would get deposited is when these capillaries narrow

32:15.760 --> 32:16.640
um

32:16.640 --> 32:18.640
One of the things that has been

32:18.640 --> 32:19.680
um

32:19.680 --> 32:21.680
You know at least in our community

32:22.080 --> 32:26.240
Uh has been disseminated is the japanese-leaked

32:27.120 --> 32:32.960
Leaked information regarding the Pfizer vaccine and the bio distribution studies the Pfizer vaccine

32:33.360 --> 32:38.400
What are the ramifications? You know, I know you're you know, you're not a reproductive specialist

32:38.960 --> 32:44.000
But you know you see that the lipid nanoparticles or the liposomes

32:44.560 --> 32:48.560
Were also accused accumulating in the gametes of male and females

32:48.880 --> 32:54.480
You know primarily in the ovaries of males, but also in the testes are ovaries of females. Excuse me

32:54.480 --> 32:57.120
I do know the difference between male and female. I promise

32:57.520 --> 33:01.760
um, but um, but also the testes of males and so um

33:03.200 --> 33:07.520
What are the ramifications there? It just it it just seems astounding

33:08.240 --> 33:11.840
That for what we were told was going to stay in the upper arm

33:12.240 --> 33:19.120
That it makes it into so many different places of the the body where you would expect sort of disparate consequences

33:19.760 --> 33:21.760
Yeah, it gets tricky right because

33:22.320 --> 33:24.320
There are a number of

33:24.880 --> 33:30.960
Reasons to be worried again. I'm keep trying to separate all these layers the transfection itself

33:31.680 --> 33:34.640
Transfecting cells in your testes or in your ovaries

33:35.520 --> 33:37.360
Who knows what would what would happen there?

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
But there's another thing

33:39.920 --> 33:43.680
That people are have been talking about for a while that I have been

33:44.480 --> 33:46.160
Maybe a little bit

33:46.160 --> 33:50.240
Pushing to the side because I want to make sure that people understand the transfection

33:50.240 --> 33:54.000
And it's greatest form would never work for what they wanted to work for right now

33:54.640 --> 33:57.280
But the lipid nanoparticle itself

33:58.000 --> 33:58.960
um

33:58.960 --> 34:05.200
Has a tendency they're like bubbles. They've been described as like, you know, soap bubbles or whatever, but they haven't really

34:05.760 --> 34:07.760
Adequately described how they can aggregate

34:08.640 --> 34:12.560
Um, and they can get a little bigger and become more toxic the larger they get

34:13.200 --> 34:14.080
um

34:14.080 --> 34:15.760
so the idea

34:15.760 --> 34:20.720
of them going to different places they're bringing the toxicity of the lipid nanoparticle which

34:21.680 --> 34:26.160
in vmo, I sorry in vitro has been shown to be able to

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
mutate and and

34:29.600 --> 34:34.800
I don't know if it's if it cuts it or if it mutates it then then the repair causes

34:35.440 --> 34:37.280
That's it and then the repair is the mutation

34:37.920 --> 34:40.640
But it can nick dna it can make

34:41.600 --> 34:48.480
Okay, so having that in your gametes would also be bad from the perspective of whatever that lipid nanoparticle may or may not do

34:49.120 --> 34:50.960
um

34:50.960 --> 34:57.280
It is a it is a very concerning thing also that that same study showed that it goes to the bone marrow where

34:57.840 --> 35:05.520
Right here. You could have interaction with ongoing stem cell development or uh, uh, excuse me immature

35:06.080 --> 35:10.960
Um, immune cell development and who knows what kind of consequences that could have long term

35:11.440 --> 35:18.800
One of the things that i'm finding interesting is all these case studies and there hasn't been enough information yet really to do epidemiology

35:19.360 --> 35:22.640
But all these case studies on so-called turbo cancers

35:23.520 --> 35:26.880
Uh, and they're and they're primarily lymphomas

35:27.520 --> 35:33.600
Uh, i've seen a lot of photographic evidences of swelling and lymph nodes lymph nodes

35:34.080 --> 35:41.600
So limp lympho demopathy and then and then followed by tumors in the lymph nodes as well

35:42.240 --> 35:43.440
um

35:43.440 --> 35:50.160
What you know, you talk about nicking dna and that really kind of get my sense is going because I know dna damage

35:50.720 --> 35:52.880
To somatic cells leads to cancer

35:53.440 --> 35:58.160
Um, could could that be an explanation or could there be other explanations?

35:58.480 --> 36:01.440
Um, why we're seeing an uptick in certain forms of cancer

36:01.760 --> 36:07.920
So I think there are a number of different things the one thing I would first caution everybody and and and I would

36:08.240 --> 36:10.320
It comes first to mind

36:10.320 --> 36:11.840
Is this

36:11.840 --> 36:16.880
Leg and whatever we did with those first two years how many people should have gotten found early?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.400
Um and didn't um, I don't think it's that though

36:21.040 --> 36:22.400
um

36:22.400 --> 36:31.120
One thing to consider is the reports from early on with the sequence of the virus and specifically the spike protein included a sequence

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
called dc sine

36:34.000 --> 36:37.360
which is a sequence which is kind of a

36:38.560 --> 36:40.000
uh

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
a general

36:42.240 --> 36:45.200
Sequence match for an mhc

36:46.000 --> 36:50.480
That it's more or less a an antigen presenting cell stimulator

36:50.960 --> 36:52.960
Okay, well the idea would be

36:53.200 --> 36:54.160
that

36:54.160 --> 36:58.240
Imagine a scenario where you wanted to make a vaccine work really well

36:58.960 --> 37:03.040
But you knew that a protein doesn't really attract the immune system

37:03.760 --> 37:07.200
And it looks as a possibility that maybe

37:07.840 --> 37:14.000
Some epitopes were inserted into the spike protein to make them. Let's say more immunogenic

37:14.560 --> 37:15.760
Okay

37:15.760 --> 37:17.760
If that was the case

37:18.080 --> 37:19.040
um

37:19.040 --> 37:26.400
It's possible that when you over express this spike protein in your body and it happens to have this very generic

37:27.200 --> 37:32.640
antigen presenting cell stimulator, which is the mirror image. I believe of a T cell

37:33.440 --> 37:34.480
receptor

37:34.480 --> 37:35.440
Right

37:35.440 --> 37:38.640
You could have over activation of T cells if you have this much

37:39.200 --> 37:42.720
spike protein in your body and over activation of T cells is dangerous

37:43.360 --> 37:44.720
because

37:44.720 --> 37:45.920
there is a

37:46.000 --> 37:52.880
A yin in the yang that's going on in your body between the T cells that are fighting and the T cells that are tolerating

37:53.200 --> 37:54.880
If you think about your

37:54.880 --> 37:59.520
If you think about your immune system in a very broad sense, you should think about it pretty simply

38:00.240 --> 38:01.280
as

38:01.280 --> 38:03.440
something like this

38:03.440 --> 38:04.720
And so

38:04.720 --> 38:06.720
Here's you on the outside

38:07.200 --> 38:10.320
Here's your mouth. Oops. You can't see that. Here's your mouth

38:11.280 --> 38:13.360
And then here's the exit hole over here

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
And this is your lungs

38:16.400 --> 38:17.440
Right

38:17.440 --> 38:25.040
And so this is the inside of your body or this stuff inside this being and stuff in like this being and everything else is on the

38:25.040 --> 38:29.360
Outside of your body and in fact your lungs are still the outside

38:29.840 --> 38:34.000
And in fact your GI tract is the outside of your body

38:35.120 --> 38:36.880
As if the tube

38:36.880 --> 38:38.880
So your immune system

38:39.040 --> 38:41.040
is actually organized

38:41.600 --> 38:43.600
around this barrier

38:44.640 --> 38:49.840
And you should always think about your immune system as organized around a barrier because

38:50.400 --> 38:53.680
The cells think of themselves as organized around a barrier

38:54.240 --> 38:56.240
And in fact that barrier has

38:56.480 --> 38:57.680
little

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
Barracks right that are called

39:00.080 --> 39:01.280
lymph nodes

39:01.280 --> 39:07.760
And so it doesn't matter where you are in your body. It doesn't matter whether it's your lungs or whether it's in your gut or whether it's in your

39:08.320 --> 39:09.360
Your skin

39:09.360 --> 39:14.960
There are lymph nodes that feed and serve as a home base for the immune cells

39:15.360 --> 39:19.680
That that's that are defending this barrier whether it's your skin out of here

39:20.560 --> 39:23.120
Or whether it's the epithelium of your lungs

39:24.160 --> 39:26.160
Or whether it's the epithelium of your gut

39:26.960 --> 39:28.960
But the trick to remember

39:29.200 --> 39:32.160
Is that in your gut things have to come in

39:33.440 --> 39:36.480
And everywhere else things cannot come in

39:37.040 --> 39:41.760
Nobody's allowed to come in through your lungs. Nobody's allowed to come in through your skin

39:43.040 --> 39:48.080
And so there is a balance between the tolerance of the immune system

39:48.720 --> 39:50.720
in your gut

39:50.720 --> 39:54.560
And the intolerance of the immune system of everywhere else

39:55.280 --> 39:58.000
And if you think about a if you think about a

39:58.960 --> 40:00.560
a

40:00.560 --> 40:05.440
Respiratory pathogen the respiratory pathogen gets trapped in your mucus

40:06.480 --> 40:08.480
And then it goes down into your gut

40:09.600 --> 40:11.520
And so actually

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
the immune response

40:13.520 --> 40:18.480
To a respiratory virus is the combination of the intolerant immune response in your lungs

40:18.960 --> 40:22.080
And the tolerant immune response in your gut

40:22.640 --> 40:24.640
And so you need

40:24.800 --> 40:26.240
T cells

40:26.240 --> 40:30.640
In your gut to be tolerant of the spike protein to balance

40:31.600 --> 40:36.800
Any T cells that are tolerant that are intolerant of the spike protein up here

40:37.680 --> 40:44.240
And the balance between those two T cells is what brings the crescendo of the immune system up during infection

40:45.040 --> 40:47.040
The day crescendo down

40:47.120 --> 40:51.440
As the infection declines and without that balance

40:52.080 --> 40:53.440
You're lost

40:53.440 --> 40:58.000
And now how in the world this is a bad drawing now, but if this is your inside

40:58.960 --> 41:01.760
If this is your inside how would injecting

41:02.800 --> 41:04.080
antigen

41:04.080 --> 41:07.920
Inside of the barrier of your immune system be a good way to augment

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
And that's really the

41:11.840 --> 41:15.600
The reason why very lately on my streams i've been making the argument that we may

41:16.320 --> 41:22.640
Just need to think that intramuscular injection as a means of augmenting the immune system may not be very smart

41:23.440 --> 41:25.440
It may not work because it doesn't

41:25.920 --> 41:32.720
Engage this yin and yang of the of the intolerant and the tolerant waves of the immune system

41:33.120 --> 41:34.880
So there's a balance

41:34.880 --> 41:37.840
Between I I love the way that you explained that

41:38.400 --> 41:43.280
I'm i'm not an immunologist and i've never even taught immunology which

41:43.920 --> 41:48.640
You know in the university system depending on the size of your university you might wear many hats

41:48.720 --> 41:53.440
I never wore the immunologist hat, but um, so there's a balance between

41:54.400 --> 41:59.520
the T cells in the lungs and the T cells in the gut and so things

42:00.160 --> 42:03.360
In the gut presumably could slip through is that correct?

42:03.920 --> 42:08.160
They absolutely have to because all of your lipids come in through your lymph

42:08.720 --> 42:12.960
Right your lymph is actually really exposed near the payer's patches

42:12.960 --> 42:17.360
And so if you're going to absorb any fats they have to come in through your lymph

42:18.080 --> 42:22.400
And so that means that there is this real open to the

42:22.960 --> 42:24.400
outside

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
portion of the immune system

42:26.800 --> 42:28.000
where

42:28.000 --> 42:33.280
Essentially all the nutrients have to pass through without triggering your immune system

42:33.360 --> 42:34.400
and so that

42:34.400 --> 42:37.040
happens over time as a person develops and

42:37.680 --> 42:41.120
Allergies occur because that process goes wrong

42:41.760 --> 42:43.200
Right, right

42:43.200 --> 42:49.360
What do you see um, you know, I I get really really concerned now that we're on the you know

42:49.360 --> 42:54.480
Who knows what booster we're on. I I I lost track and probably eighth booster or whatever

42:54.880 --> 42:57.120
The Cleveland Clinic studies showed that

42:57.760 --> 43:04.080
The more that individuals were vaccinated and boosted the higher their risk of getting COVID-19

43:05.200 --> 43:10.080
Was in fact, you know, if they received five or more vaccines

43:10.160 --> 43:15.520
I think that their risk of getting COVID-19 went up to about like 3.8

43:16.320 --> 43:18.320
Relative risk is compared to

43:18.800 --> 43:20.800
The unvaccinated in that group

43:20.800 --> 43:25.760
What are we doing to the innate immune system by just by all these different boosters?

43:26.480 --> 43:33.200
This is a good question. The innate immune system is a pretty enigmatic thing that i'm i'm still working to penetrate

43:33.680 --> 43:34.800
Right, right

43:34.800 --> 43:36.640
It's it. I think the

43:37.520 --> 43:42.720
The traditional explanation would be at least the not traditional one the one that makes the

43:43.200 --> 43:47.440
The most parsimonious sense to me is that with this abundance of antibodies

43:48.160 --> 43:49.280
Um

43:49.280 --> 43:55.200
You essentially are protecting the virus with antibodies that are for whatever reason unable

43:55.920 --> 43:59.840
To call in the immune system. And so we saw the paper for example

44:00.560 --> 44:06.000
Where there were iGG4, I believe antibodies. We essentially don't have a big fc

44:06.880 --> 44:11.920
Um portion of it. They're not going to call for the compliments. It's right. Right. Right and so they

44:12.080 --> 44:18.960
And they won't call in antigen presenting cells. They can't call in or or activate any other cells for any other cascade

44:19.520 --> 44:21.520
And so what that can often do

44:22.080 --> 44:24.800
Is protect the virus. So if every

44:25.520 --> 44:29.040
Virus that gets covered in this non active antibody

44:29.600 --> 44:34.240
Is immune to the compliment system then it can float around a lot farther in the system

44:34.880 --> 44:38.400
And infect a cell farther away from where it was released

44:39.120 --> 44:40.240
Um

44:40.240 --> 44:45.440
At least that's the cartoon model that virology has told us many times with regard to like dengue fever

44:46.000 --> 44:47.440
and other

44:47.440 --> 44:48.720
vaccination

44:48.720 --> 44:55.920
And then subsequent disease enhancement is because the antibodies in some way or another contribute to the virus's success

44:56.560 --> 44:57.600
So

44:57.600 --> 45:00.800
It's a tricky scenario because we don't know

45:01.680 --> 45:02.560
um

45:02.560 --> 45:08.640
Even to what extent how homogenous all of these people who have been transfected are because

45:09.200 --> 45:13.840
Um, I think you're aware of this. It's becoming pretty clear that there was no

45:14.960 --> 45:17.600
No quality control. So some doses were hot

45:18.160 --> 45:22.080
Other sorry some lots were hot and other lots were almost placebo

45:22.720 --> 45:23.520
And

45:23.520 --> 45:29.200
In reality going forward it may even be who these people to lower the doses around the world just to

45:29.840 --> 45:31.440
to throw people off and so

45:32.480 --> 45:35.200
At this stage, I mean what what can we really know for sure?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.160
um other than

45:38.160 --> 45:41.280
Then that these these systems their systems have been damaged

45:41.920 --> 45:43.760
right and and it's uh

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
It's a such a

45:46.960 --> 45:52.640
It's such a magnificent thing if you think about the idea that your immune system learns

45:53.760 --> 45:55.760
What self is and what?

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Non-self is but more importantly what's what's intolerable?

46:00.240 --> 46:02.800
Non-self and what's tolerable non-self

46:03.600 --> 46:06.800
And the idea that we can just augment this willy nilly

46:07.600 --> 46:13.040
Um has been a a thing that's drilled into all of us for many many, you know probably decades

46:13.040 --> 46:15.040
But it's really actually I don't think true

46:16.640 --> 46:21.200
I love that conclusion. I you know and and I love your comments also about

46:21.840 --> 46:23.840
You know doing an iam injection

46:24.400 --> 46:30.400
Where you're bypassing the barriers where you're bypassing the barriers of the lung bypassing the barriers of the guide

46:30.880 --> 46:33.520
Uh, you know, I think that's such a strong point

46:34.160 --> 46:37.280
Uh that you know that can't be overemphasized

46:37.840 --> 46:40.960
What about germline effects?

46:41.520 --> 46:44.400
I get concerned you you look I look at VAERS

46:45.040 --> 46:48.560
And and it's a database that I look at with regularity

46:49.280 --> 46:54.400
and the there there's a special category and VAERS for fertility disorders

46:55.200 --> 46:59.360
And the number of fertility disorders that are associated

47:00.080 --> 47:03.360
with the COVID-19 vaccine are 10 times

47:04.240 --> 47:09.600
All the rest of the reports of fertility disorders for the rest of the 32-year history of VAERS

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
And so that's really really

47:12.560 --> 47:16.240
Stark. I mean that you know that is that's quite an indictment

47:17.040 --> 47:20.080
From from a physiological standpoint from an

47:20.800 --> 47:28.160
Immunological standpoint, what would you expect to find you know if all of a sudden you've got gametes that are expressing spike protein

47:28.880 --> 47:34.000
Um, you know and and that carry over into you know trying to get pregnant

47:34.480 --> 47:38.880
Um, uh, and I think that then trying to have a viable pregnancy

47:39.360 --> 47:46.800
I think the danger was originally highlighted by a man by the name of michael eden who found a quite large homogeny with this uh,

47:46.880 --> 47:48.880
protein synchatin

47:48.880 --> 47:51.360
Synchatin. Yeah, and that's a protein which

47:52.080 --> 47:54.080
um people may be aware that

47:54.480 --> 47:58.800
when membranes bind you need to have a protein that brings them together and

47:59.600 --> 48:02.400
It may surprise people but actually many of our

48:02.960 --> 48:07.600
proteins at the cellular level are homologous with proteins that viruses use

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
and for purposes of

48:10.960 --> 48:12.320
of the

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
the

48:14.880 --> 48:17.680
Deposition of the I believe of the egg in the

48:18.480 --> 48:24.720
In the uterus for example, the implantation requires a protein that's very similar to sync to

48:25.360 --> 48:27.760
a viral spike protein called synchatin

48:28.400 --> 48:34.080
So the idea and I could be saying it wrong, but I believe it's synchatin anyway that protein

48:34.880 --> 48:35.920
if

48:35.920 --> 48:37.600
if women

48:37.600 --> 48:41.040
When they are transfected build antibodies which cannot

48:41.680 --> 48:46.560
adequately specify and they you know they bind to this protein and it would be

48:47.120 --> 48:52.800
A thing where you have built autoimmunity which will effectively prevent pregnancy

48:53.520 --> 48:55.920
um if you build autoimmunity

48:56.720 --> 48:59.760
um to any of these tissues which express this

49:00.560 --> 49:04.720
This protein as a result of the immune response because that's the trick brian

49:05.440 --> 49:06.720
every time

49:06.720 --> 49:09.520
The immune response is is forced to clear

49:10.880 --> 49:14.320
Your tissue if it's your thiele cells for example

49:14.800 --> 49:16.640
There is a chance that

49:16.640 --> 49:18.640
an antigen presenting cell

49:18.880 --> 49:25.600
Will decide to present a self antigen and it will find a T cell that recognizes it's not very likely

49:26.160 --> 49:28.160
Right, but the idea is

49:28.320 --> 49:34.480
You know, if if if the gun has in as finite number of chambers, you don't want to play rush and roulette

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
And this is one of those scenarios

49:37.920 --> 49:38.960
where

49:38.960 --> 49:40.320
We cannot

49:40.320 --> 49:42.800
Augment the immune system this way and expect

49:43.440 --> 49:45.520
That the immune system isn't going to make a mistake

49:46.160 --> 49:48.160
um by sending this

49:48.160 --> 49:54.960
Transfection all throughout the body and challenging the immune system not to make any mistakes. It's just a very very bad idea

49:56.160 --> 50:02.560
Incredible absolutely incredible you've you've brought up so many so many important salient issues

50:03.120 --> 50:07.280
Not only with the mRNA vaccines, but the adenovirus vector vaccines

50:07.840 --> 50:10.160
um i'm so appreciative that of that

50:10.720 --> 50:13.840
Where can we see more of you?

50:14.000 --> 50:19.760
Where is your where is your youtube channel? It's called giga ohm biological. Is that correct?

50:20.160 --> 50:21.760
Yes, and i'm on this

50:21.760 --> 50:28.480
It's basically a gaming platform called twitch twitch right i'm going to move back on youtube shortly

50:28.480 --> 50:34.560
But as of right now, it still feels like um my stuff is too hard hitting for youtube and they let me hide on twitch

50:34.720 --> 50:42.400
Um, I also have a rumble channel with the same name and so you can find replays there as well. Okay. I appreciate it jay

50:42.400 --> 50:44.400
Thank you so much for joining us today

50:44.960 --> 50:48.720
Uh, appreciate your knowledge and insight and welcome to chd

50:49.120 --> 50:52.800
Thank you very much brian as a pleasure to be here and uh honor to work with you

50:53.440 --> 50:57.760
All right, and thank you everybody for joining us for this episode of doctors and scientists

50:58.160 --> 51:00.960
You heard it here first enjoy the rest of your morning

51:04.560 --> 51:06.560
You

51:14.560 --> 51:19.280
Hi chd friends, it's me mary holland president of children's health defense

51:19.760 --> 51:24.000
I reached out to you just a week ago, but i'm reaching out again because so much has happened

51:24.480 --> 51:29.680
The fda has authorized a new round of coded shots for a variant that's already gone

51:30.400 --> 51:33.200
And they only tested it on 20 mice

51:33.840 --> 51:38.000
No control group, no human testing and with no emergency in sight

51:38.400 --> 51:43.840
Public health officials authorized these shots for emergency use for babies as young as six months

51:44.480 --> 51:47.760
Folks, this is the very definition of a morality

51:47.920 --> 51:51.440
They're pulling out all the stops because we're winning and they're desperate

51:51.680 --> 51:55.120
We're winning in courts around the country and around the world

51:55.760 --> 51:59.200
And we're winning where it counts most in the court of public opinion

51:59.840 --> 52:04.080
And that's why your support right now makes such a difference

52:04.400 --> 52:09.120
Thanks to our generous supporters. We're running a million dollar match campaign this month

52:09.760 --> 52:16.960
So as the cdc launches, it's wild to mild campaign to hype flu vaccines for adults pregnant women and children

52:17.360 --> 52:20.640
With the promise of keeping everyone safe from a bad case of the flu

52:21.120 --> 52:25.680
And while they use your tax dollars to push dangerous hpv vaccines

52:25.760 --> 52:33.040
Unvulnerable low-income minority teens and as california's health department threatens to defund schools that have a low

52:33.280 --> 52:37.040
Student vaccination rate without a shred of scientific evidence on their side

52:37.520 --> 52:42.960
The fda and cdc want you to believe it's now perfectly safe to get a flu

52:43.520 --> 52:48.800
COVID and rsv shot all at the same time the evidence speaks for itself

52:49.360 --> 52:50.880
They are desperate

52:50.880 --> 52:54.720
Desperate to keep you and me in a perpetual state of fear

52:55.120 --> 53:00.560
And desperate to protect the obscenely lucrative profits from their vaccine pipeline

53:01.040 --> 53:04.240
And like i said, they're desperate because we are winning

53:04.800 --> 53:13.040
Using a legal theory chd advanced and appeals court rule last week that government officials almost certainly violated the first amendment

53:13.120 --> 53:20.960
When they pressured tech platforms to censor posts on social media, even those that were absolutely true that went against the official narrative

53:21.440 --> 53:27.760
The new york supreme court just ordered new york city officials to reinstate 10 teachers with back pay

53:28.320 --> 53:33.440
Who refused the covid shots chd brought that lawsuit with your donations

53:34.000 --> 53:37.680
These are big wins and the more we win the more they ratchet up

53:38.240 --> 53:44.080
Now is the time to prove that with each attack on our freedoms on our health on our children

53:44.480 --> 53:46.960
We grow stronger and more resolute

53:47.600 --> 53:50.560
You are our most indispensable resource

53:50.960 --> 53:53.840
You are the engine that keeps this movement running

53:54.160 --> 53:56.400
We are humbled by your generosity

53:56.480 --> 54:00.640
And i want you to know that we will steward your money as if it were our own

54:01.120 --> 54:05.200
Like you we're in this movement till our last breaths. So thank you

54:16.960 --> 54:19.840
You
