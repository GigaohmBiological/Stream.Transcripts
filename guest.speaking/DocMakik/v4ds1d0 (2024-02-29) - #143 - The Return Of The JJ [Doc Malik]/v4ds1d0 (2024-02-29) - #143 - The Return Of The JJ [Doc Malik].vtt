00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
I'm saying good, your voice sounds back to normal, it's really nice, although I never

00:07.880 --> 00:11.240
knew what it was like when it was normal, but when I last spoke to you, you had this

00:11.240 --> 00:15.360
very gravely sexy, I'm JJ Kui kind of voice.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.800
It's a little bit more like Kermit the Frog I think, but yeah, it finally came back now.

00:20.800 --> 00:26.160
Right, listen, brother, sorry for the delay, you saw the chickens, the chickens are literally

00:26.160 --> 00:31.240
opposite me, and they're the younger of the two group of chickens we've got, so it's

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
really funny, right?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
I'll tell you a little story.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.640
I really wanted to get chickens, right?

00:34.640 --> 00:41.000
All about this, you know, self sustainability, be as independent as possible, grow your own

00:41.000 --> 00:43.360
food, have your own eggs, you know, all that kind of stuff.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.200
And I said to my wife, oh, I get some chickens, she was like, oh, we don't have room for

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
chickens.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.280
Oh, we've got room, we can make room.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.320
I'll chop down a few bushes and all that kind of stuff.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.560
And she went, how many chickens are you thinking of, I was like, I don't know, five,

00:55.560 --> 00:58.920
one for each of us in the family, that's way too many.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
That's way too many.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.360
Oh, come on, let's just get five chickens, we've got five little chickens.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.880
Within a month, she was like, I want more chickens.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
I was like, what?

01:06.880 --> 01:08.440
She was, I want to get another six.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.160
I was like, where are we going to put that?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.120
She went, we'll make room.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.040
It just goes to show where there's room, where there's a will, there's a way in them.

01:16.040 --> 01:20.280
So the younger chickens, the second lot that we got, they're very naughty.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.720
So they always forget to go to bed.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.640
And they stay too late and these automatic doors that come and close at night and open

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
during the day.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Wow.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
Fancy chicken coop.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.640
Right?

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
Yeah.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
Yeah.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.520
They, they never get in on time.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.960
So when I was walking to the garden studio, all I heard was like, they're telling me, they're

01:37.960 --> 01:40.520
like, we, we, we're locked out, please let's say.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
And they're really cute.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.520
That's pretty funny.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.520
JJ, I don't, I don't know if we got chickens.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
They've got some personality.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
We don't even have 11 chickens.

01:46.520 --> 01:51.120
We only have, we only have a few, but yeah, we love them very much.

01:52.120 --> 01:58.480
And it is something that, yeah, if you don't have, I think they're much better than a garden.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.840
Not to say that you shouldn't have a garden, but I think some people underestimate how

02:03.840 --> 02:09.320
powerful it is to have, in your case, you can have a half a dozen eggs every day for,

02:09.320 --> 02:11.640
for a very long time now going into the future.

02:11.640 --> 02:17.280
And that's a pretty, it's a pretty big, it's a lot of wealth if you think about it.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.120
All you have to do is learn to bake or realize that that egg tastes so different than the

02:23.120 --> 02:24.360
egg that you get in the store.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.360
It's really nice.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.360
I love chickens, man.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
I'm down with the chicken idea.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.360
I don't know about you.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.440
I have eggs every day in some shape or form.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.200
I love that protein bowl.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.680
Nothing beats it, you know?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.880
Yeah, we just don't have enough.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.200
We don't have the chickens like you do.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.360
We don't have a, we don't have the threshold.

02:40.360 --> 02:45.800
So they're, you're, they're kind of fought for if there's an egg, you know, then I usually

02:45.800 --> 02:48.120
eat it, but usually the kids grab it before I get one.

02:48.120 --> 02:53.120
The thing is our chickens are also Bantam chickens, which means the eggs are about two

02:53.120 --> 02:58.240
thirds, the size of a normal egg, but God damn it, are they good?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.440
They're, they're delish.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.040
Like the yolk is very big as big and then the white is smaller.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
Yeah.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
That's basically what happens.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Yeah.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Yeah.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.040
Yeah.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.040
They're great.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.040
Anyway, with this being some development, I was going to say there's been some developments

03:13.040 --> 03:16.640
since you were laughing when I was doing the development, what are some of the developments

03:16.640 --> 03:19.520
and give me a list and then we'll talk about them.

03:19.520 --> 03:24.280
Well, you're apparently you're no longer working for the children's health defense.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.600
Are you able to talk about that?

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
What happened?

03:26.600 --> 03:34.840
Children's health defense on January 4th informed me that the contents of my stream had regularly

03:34.840 --> 03:43.760
interfered with their ability to successfully interact with their partners.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.040
And I think that's pretty close to the language that was used to describe why I and my position

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
had ended.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.440
And so I guess from the perspective of what happened, I was laid off.

03:54.440 --> 03:58.720
I didn't have a contract that needed to be ended, it had no end point.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.400
And so, you know, if they end a position, they end a position.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.880
I think that's probably a pretty smart way to run an organization like that.

04:05.880 --> 04:12.520
But in terms of understanding really what occurred and how I had encroached on this

04:12.520 --> 04:17.800
relationship with their partners is not really been something that's become clear to me.

04:17.800 --> 04:24.320
I was offered $8 severance package if I would sign a non-disclosure agreement.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.960
And so I just declined that.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.520
And so that's why I feel pretty comfortable saying this.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.600
They don't have anything to do or take away from me.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.240
But I don't know what people would think about that.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.600
I just knew that if I took that money and it helped my family for a little while, but

04:41.600 --> 04:45.680
I couldn't tell everybody how much I took, then, you know, everybody and their mom would

04:45.680 --> 04:49.400
be making up a number that definitely wouldn't have been just $8,000.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.880
And so I didn't see any win there.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.920
So I said no.

04:53.920 --> 04:54.920
And we parted ways.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.840
Since then, I've been back to shaking a can on the internet like you.

04:58.840 --> 05:05.240
I'm not doing it as well as you, but I think that there's a lot of people now who, for

05:05.240 --> 05:07.800
whatever reason, are going to have to try and figure this out.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.680
And I've been successful occasionally with getting a few hours here and a few hours there

05:12.680 --> 05:15.560
where I can consult for somebody for some reason or another.

05:15.560 --> 05:21.800
But overall, I'm still putting all my eggs in this basket of there not being enough voices

05:21.800 --> 05:27.680
in America trying to figure out what really happened and most people are trying to move

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
on.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.600
And so I think it's, you know, there's a lot of people, and you know this story very well.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.320
There's a lot of people who have been fighting against the vaccine schedule in America for

05:36.320 --> 05:41.840
longer than than than most of us have even known that it might be a question.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.000
And those people, they need to tag out now.

05:45.080 --> 05:52.080
I'm prepared to be a part of this new vanguard of people that's willing to speak out and

05:52.080 --> 05:59.280
say definitively, look, they've never really proved what they claim with regard to these

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
products.

06:00.280 --> 06:07.600
And I think that a very measured approach in rolling back the requirements in America

06:07.600 --> 06:15.800
and rolling back the time periods that they're given at the very least, no matter where

06:15.800 --> 06:19.240
you are on the spectrum, you can't argue against that.

06:19.240 --> 06:25.560
There is no way to defend what America does to the most young children before they're

06:25.560 --> 06:27.800
six months old.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.720
It just doesn't make any sense.

06:29.720 --> 06:34.760
And so I'm not saying that I'm I think that some vaccines are good and some are bad.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.640
But I'm not wanting to make that decision right now.

06:36.640 --> 06:41.680
And I'm suggesting is there's enough evidence on the table to suggest that what we do in

06:41.680 --> 06:46.160
America can only be described as basically criminal.

06:46.160 --> 06:53.200
And even if you're on the very, I believe in vaccines team, you still have to acknowledge

06:53.200 --> 06:57.840
that you shouldn't be, you know, trying to augment a baby as it's still developing.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.760
And that's just crazy talk.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.680
It's crazy to all right, there you have it.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.680
Let's go back and back.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.680
Let's go back a bit.

07:04.680 --> 07:13.600
So what you described with what CHD told you in my simple brain, it sounds like we don't

07:13.600 --> 07:16.200
believe that you're entitled to free speech.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.520
You don't like what you're saying in your own private time.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.520
And it's upsetting people what we're dealing with.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.440
So we're just going to let you go.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.840
Now that to me just sounds crazy.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.600
Are you not allowed a private life?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.400
Are you not allowed to have private thoughts?

07:32.400 --> 07:37.680
Are you not allowed to share what you think and feel in your own time?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.000
Like, what the hell has that got to do with anything?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.600
And what were you saying or doing on your streaming that was so terrible?

07:43.600 --> 07:52.280
I mean, were you doing an only fans kind of like channel, like, I mean, I wasn't playing

07:52.280 --> 07:56.560
Fortnite or anything like that.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.320
I was reporting about things that had happened.

08:00.320 --> 08:07.080
One particular thing that I found interesting that I reported on, I think, December 23rd,

08:07.080 --> 08:13.000
that may or may not have been involved in this was that I think a couple of days before

08:13.000 --> 08:19.840
the 23rd of December, maybe the 22nd, Robert Malone responded to some random person's tweet

08:19.840 --> 08:25.240
about whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was or wasn't qualified to be president.

08:25.760 --> 08:31.800
It was in a thread where Robert Malone had argued that Donald Trump was still the best choice.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.640
And when someone said, you know that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.000
should be elected president, he said, no.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.640
And his evidence was exhibit one was C.H.D.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.400
And I found that strange for a number of reasons.

08:45.400 --> 08:51.720
The first reason I found it strange was that as I understand the mythology of Robert Malone,

08:51.760 --> 08:58.160
one of the first places that he went for help or assistance was C.H.D.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.760
And he got it, you know, they supported him.

09:02.760 --> 09:08.000
They actually published his book lies my government told me with their partner Skyhorse publishing,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.560
but also under their own, you know, publishing head.

09:11.560 --> 09:16.800
And so I found it strange that he would he was at the other thing is funny.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.320
I was at Bobby's announcement in Boston when he first announced he was

09:21.720 --> 09:26.320
running for president and Robert Malone was two rows in front of me.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.200
So it just seemed a very weird statement to put out on Twitter.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.040
But you know, you can keep telling that story and it goes, it can go even deeper

09:35.040 --> 09:42.760
because the mythology that I was told was that the whole reason why Bobby

09:42.760 --> 09:45.800
Kennedy ever heard about me in the first place was that Robert Malone

09:45.800 --> 09:51.760
sat him down and made him watch my stream with with Charles Ricksy.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.520
And it was this stream that he first saw me and then decided to hire Charles

09:57.520 --> 10:00.480
and I to help him with his book back in April 22.

10:00.480 --> 10:06.560
So it's crazy because this this thing with Robert Malone is along

10:06.560 --> 10:10.760
and weird connection with with Bobby and C.H.D.

10:10.760 --> 10:15.160
and me because the first time I met Robert Malone was not in person,

10:15.160 --> 10:20.320
but actually on Bobby's podcast and then like less than two weeks later,

10:20.320 --> 10:25.400
I met him in person at a C.H.D. conference where he claimed not to remember me

10:25.400 --> 10:27.560
or not to know who I was.

10:27.560 --> 10:34.720
And it's just a very bizarre thing that then a more than a year and a half later,

10:34.720 --> 10:40.800
he's he's pretending as though, you know, Bobby Kennedy is is not qualified

10:40.800 --> 10:42.920
and somehow C.H.D. is evidence of it.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.800
And I was working in C.H.D. at the time.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.240
And the only thing I could say was is that I had been to two conferences.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.960
Everybody that I had met were incredible.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.280
Brian Hooker is a hero.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.520
He's the guy who drove across the United States to to make the C.D.C.

10:57.520 --> 11:01.880
give up the data that revealed the first real evidence that the C.D.C.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.480
knew that these vaccines could be hurting kids and we're covering it up.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.880
And so he's not the only hero that works in that organization.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.680
Lots and lots of the people that work in C.H.D.

11:13.680 --> 11:19.480
are there because they are card carrying parents of vaccine damaged children.

11:19.480 --> 11:25.480
And so it's a it's an organization full of people who've been told no

11:25.480 --> 11:29.160
and we don't believe you and you're crazy and they've been told it a lot longer

11:29.160 --> 11:30.600
than I've been told it.

11:30.600 --> 11:35.880
And so I was humble inside of that organization just happy to be there.

11:35.880 --> 11:42.280
And so I can be very honest and say that I was pretty blindsided when I was told

11:42.280 --> 11:46.880
that I was let go because I I thought I was basically defending C.H.D.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.480
by pointing out that it wasn't fair for I mean, C.H.D.

11:50.480 --> 11:55.320
is the only organization besides ICANN in America that's even remotely trying

11:55.320 --> 12:00.200
to fight for for these causes and fight for these truths.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.560
So I still feel that way.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.400
I still feel like C.H.D. is that kind of organization.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.120
And I still feel like the everybody that I've ever met that works for that organization

12:09.120 --> 12:09.920
is fantastic.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.400
And so I'm bewildered and I'm sad, but it's we don't have time for that.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.360
Our grandkids don't have time for that.

12:16.360 --> 12:21.800
So I've just gotten on with my work and I think you're a guy who can

12:21.800 --> 12:26.480
definitely understand that because you also have been very good at setting an

12:26.480 --> 12:28.800
example of how you just get on with your work.

12:28.800 --> 12:33.280
Yeah, I mean, you have to go over your election is getting very big.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.800
I mean, you have this the wall must be very pretty with all the with all the mug

12:37.800 --> 12:38.600
shots you have.

12:38.600 --> 12:44.320
No, I don't do mug shots and I don't do selfies and I don't know, no, no, no, no,

12:44.320 --> 12:45.000
no, no, no, no, no.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
But listen, listen, it doesn't.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.760
No, you're mug shot.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.640
What do you collect for your thumbnails?

12:48.640 --> 12:51.160
I think they're all very well done and very consistent.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.480
So you could make a whole wall.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.360
It would be very nice.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.280
That's what I meant.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.640
I'll explain that in a second.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.960
So basically, yeah, it doesn't make sense why you were let go.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.520
So you're defending C.H.D.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.680
You're pointing out Robert Malone's idiosyncrasies.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.640
He's, you know, he's working with C.H.D.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.920
Or he's being supported by them.

13:06.920 --> 13:11.160
And then suddenly he's turning against them and saying, no, it doesn't make sense.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.400
But you know what, I've got my own history of Robert Malone.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.240
He's a funny man.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.480
He doesn't like me.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.760
God knows why, but it's weird.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.440
I don't know what what's going on there.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.840
And I'm sorry you're caught in the crosshairs and some, you know, there's just

13:23.840 --> 13:25.760
so many egos and politics going on.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.000
I don't think I don't think you should be sorry either.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.440
You shouldn't be sorry either, because it means that I think more, we're more

13:31.440 --> 13:32.520
or less over the target.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.200
Robert Malone is somebody who, when we were still goofing around, trying to

13:37.200 --> 13:40.760
figure out when I was still goofing around, trying to really figure out what

13:40.760 --> 13:43.440
to do with my, with my adult life.

13:45.600 --> 13:51.120
He was already giving speeches in front of the who about fill and fit,

13:51.120 --> 13:53.960
finish technologies for flu vaccines.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.720
And so it's, it's, he's an insider.

13:57.720 --> 14:02.480
He's a person who is connected to, at least connected to the people who are

14:02.480 --> 14:07.280
doing this, whoever that is, if not, I mean, it's just, he knows, he knows more

14:07.280 --> 14:13.240
than he says, he, he, he, he knows that, that gain of function is not possible

14:13.240 --> 14:17.080
in the garage of a bachelor's student in biology, even though he said that in

14:17.080 --> 14:21.520
front of people in your, in your, in your parliament.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.040
I mean, it's just absurd to assert that.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.360
And for that to be his, his ending message, the guy that came on stage to

14:29.600 --> 14:32.240
apparently save us from his own invention.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.120
Now his primary message is that there was a virus and that it could come again

14:37.120 --> 14:39.600
and it'll be worse because it's getting easier.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.040
I don't know.

14:40.640 --> 14:47.240
It's just, it's unfortunate because we cannot let our young adults accept this

14:47.240 --> 14:47.960
mythology.

14:47.960 --> 14:52.600
We, I don't know how to start the crusade, but we've got to rescue these

14:52.600 --> 14:54.480
university kids from this illusion.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.360
We definitely do.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.520
It must be worse over there.

14:57.880 --> 15:03.720
And in some ways, I think because in, I feel like, I feel like in some ways,

15:03.800 --> 15:07.520
every other five eyes country had it harder than America.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.280
If only because there was, there was more permissible with inside, inside

15:12.280 --> 15:14.040
of your own system of laws.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
Is that how you see it as well?

15:16.520 --> 15:20.240
I mean, some people locked down in America, not like in the UK and definitely not

15:20.240 --> 15:20.520
like it.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.880
Well, no matter how bad things were in the States, buddy, like the fact is

15:25.880 --> 15:27.560
you've got your federal system.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.120
So the States have got a lot of power and there are these little checks and

15:31.120 --> 15:33.360
balances and you guys have got guns.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.400
And I know it sounds crazy, but all of these things means it limits the reach

15:38.400 --> 15:40.320
of government, the federal state.

15:40.320 --> 15:45.680
They can push, they can nudge, they can cajole, they can coerce, but the

15:45.680 --> 15:49.520
reality is there's so many protections and you've got things like, you know, freedom

15:49.520 --> 15:52.680
of speech, your right to freedom of speech is basic things that are written

15:52.680 --> 15:53.760
in your constitution.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.400
And a lot of other countries like New Zealand and Australia and Britain, we

15:58.400 --> 15:59.600
don't have these rights, Canada.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.440
We don't have these rights.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.280
There's no, you know, there's no such right to freedom of speech in the UK.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.120
So for example, I got completely screwed over recently because of my podcast.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.360
A guest said something about Israel, which are completely true, completely

16:12.360 --> 16:13.160
legitimate.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.000
You know, there are Israeli officials advocating ethnic cleansing of Gaza

16:18.000 --> 16:18.560
and Palestine.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.400
It's on the record.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.160
Was it Dan Cohen?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.080
It was an Eva Bartlett.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.040
So, you know, because I made a clip of that, because I made a clip of that,

16:26.040 --> 16:29.200
put it on my Instagram, you know, the hospitals, I write, we're suspending you.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.280
We don't like the fact you did this and blah, blah, blah.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.680
You know, a complete infringement of my freedom of speech.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.200
I don't have, I don't have any protection.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.240
There's no protection for me.

16:38.600 --> 16:43.240
You know, I can fight, I will, but there's just no system.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.040
And, and, and the UK and New Zealand, it's all homogenous.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.800
It's one state, it's a very powerful state.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.960
And, you know, we don't have guns can protect ourselves.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.360
One of my previous guests, Nigel Watson, made it very clear.

16:56.360 --> 17:03.800
He said, the state has a monopoly of legalized use of force.

17:04.600 --> 17:11.280
OK, so they can get their heavies, their men's with batons and guns and handcuffs.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.880
And if they don't like you, well, for whatever reason, you don't pay your taxes

17:14.880 --> 17:16.840
or you don't do something, they'll come around.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.360
Knock on your door and they can, they can use force from you.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.040
You can't use force back.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.120
This is a situation we're in.

17:23.120 --> 17:31.600
So, you know, but there's also very, very, very sophisticated mind manipulation tools

17:31.600 --> 17:37.280
in the West, you know, we have really fine-tuned the art of brainwashing.

17:37.280 --> 17:43.280
So, for example, in the Far East, in Russia and China, Ukraine, whatever, Iran,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.720
you know what, if you speak against the state, if you upset them,

17:47.280 --> 17:51.760
they will send some big thugs around, you know, dressed up as cops or whatever.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.600
And they'll pop you in prison, they'll disappear you, they'll get some

17:56.600 --> 17:58.200
trumped up charges and you're in jail.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.040
I mean, you know, they can just do that.

18:01.040 --> 18:01.640
They just do that.

18:01.640 --> 18:05.600
It's very blunt out there and they do that shit.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.280
I mean, that's true.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.200
But here in the West, yes, they can do that.

18:10.200 --> 18:15.200
And sometimes they do do that, but most of the time, they're simply using

18:15.200 --> 18:16.400
manipulation.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.360
And guess what?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.640
It's really, really powerful.

18:18.840 --> 18:25.400
So, for example, the ITV channel here in the UK has recently just published this

18:26.640 --> 18:29.520
this movie, a documentary, a drama series.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.480
I don't know if you've heard of it.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.520
It's called something about the pandemic.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.200
Let me find it for you and I'll find the screenshot for you.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.880
And it's complete propaganda.

18:39.880 --> 18:46.000
So basically it's a it's a fake drama about a fake pandemic.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.360
So let me show you this screen.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.840
Look at this, right?

18:48.840 --> 18:49.400
Look at this.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.400
This is one of the doctors pushing it.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.600
So there you go, breathtaking.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.600
That's it.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.920
The story you haven't been told.

18:57.200 --> 19:01.240
The 19th, I saw that on Twitter, but I didn't know it was the movie.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.200
Oh, my God.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.000
It's a drama.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.640
It's a drama.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.120
It's a drama, breathtaking, breathtaking.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.920
And but you know what?

19:08.920 --> 19:10.120
I'll be honest with you.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.920
It's complete BS.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.560
It's absolute BS.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.920
And the problem is a lot of people are totally there.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.520
You go ITV all over the place.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.960
And this is the best part.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.040
I don't know if you can see this, right?

19:24.040 --> 19:24.440
Look at this.

19:24.880 --> 19:30.520
If you or anyone you know has been affected by the issues raised in this program,

19:31.040 --> 19:37.000
please visit itv.com advice for support information because have you been triggered?

19:37.160 --> 19:41.400
Are you upset by watching this drama, this fake drama of what might have happened?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.320
And look, the problem is look at these comments.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.480
Let's look at the comments, right?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.800
Heartbreaking when you know the truth.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.440
Oh, what should have happened?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.760
Oh, Lang, oh, sorry.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.200
He's saying the good, the right thing.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.080
Give early treatment.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.000
Yeah, there's me fictional drama about fictional pandemic.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.680
Um, I mean, actually, look, a lot of these are actually calling out the nonsense.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.800
Maybe it's just showing that because it's what

20:07.880 --> 20:12.400
why the hell would you accept this role when it's now mainstream knowledge that it wasn't dangerous?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.080
Oh, OK, the comments are great.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.040
This is making me happy.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.120
All right, people, people are seeing through this.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.160
Look her in the eyes and ask how many people she vaccine damaged.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.480
Oh, dude, this is good.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.160
These are genuine scenes from the height of the pandemic.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.280
All right, look, is this not comforting?

20:28.680 --> 20:30.280
Knowing this, this is public.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.200
This is the public.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.120
They seem to be seeing through the BS and the propaganda.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.320
Well, I'm just saying with that for me, though, is

20:39.720 --> 20:45.400
I'm worried that Twitter can now be used to give you and I that impression.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.360
Yeah, I know.

20:46.360 --> 20:46.920
Wow.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.680
It looks like there's a wave of there's a wave of awakening happening.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.880
We're making progress.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.680
People are watching videos.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.920
I'm worried about that because that that could be a very, very

21:00.280 --> 21:02.360
false impression of what's actually going on.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.720
I worry about that a lot.

21:03.880 --> 21:04.600
No, I agree.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.080
I agree.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.960
That's why I'm trying to translate it off a critter.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.360
But there's so many people there that I still want to stay connected with

21:11.360 --> 21:14.880
and need to follow and so much information is shared there.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.600
But I genuinely hate the place.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.640
I can be honest with you.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.200
I used to hate the place.

21:20.240 --> 21:25.080
So, I mean, you know, the main reasons why I use Twitter is to shout out what I'm

21:25.080 --> 21:28.720
thinking and talk about and you do it well.

21:28.960 --> 21:29.640
You do it well.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.680
You're probably very good at not swimming in the mud.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.960
I mean, involved.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.160
I don't read the I don't read the comments.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.160
I don't reply.

21:36.600 --> 21:41.120
I don't, you know, I just I like Joe Rogan says, I post and ghost.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.880
And I'm not in the habit of looking for the feeds, you know, like scrolling.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.600
I don't do that.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.640
I don't I don't look out other people unless it happens to come across me.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.320
I get bombarded by people every day saying, can you retweet this?

21:53.320 --> 21:54.000
Can you retweet this?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.040
Can you retweet?

21:55.040 --> 21:56.200
I just don't do that.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.200
Like it's just I never say to people, can you please retweet this?

22:00.200 --> 22:00.920
Can you retweet?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.680
That's just like, I just don't want to do that.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.520
Like occasionally something will come across my eye because it just happens to.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.320
You know, when I go on and I'll be like, Oh, that's nice.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.000
And I'll retweet it.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.600
But generally speaking, I post, I ghost, I get out of here.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.040
Cause you know what?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.040
I got too much shit to do.

22:15.080 --> 22:20.680
And the reality is this thing is dangerous is you could waste a whole day

22:21.040 --> 22:23.640
before you know it, just going through shit.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.320
And the reality is I need to post things on and Twitter.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.640
I need to do shorts and clips and post them on my Instagram.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.480
I need to do interviews.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.600
I need to edit them.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.040
I need to write sub stacks.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.080
I need to take care of my kids.

22:36.080 --> 22:36.920
People don't realize.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.280
I think how much time I spend looking after my kids.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.800
I spent a lot of the day looking after my kids.

22:42.840 --> 22:45.160
I mean, just to run it down, JJ, I hope you don't mind.

22:45.160 --> 22:50.640
Like I get up at six, half six at the latest, straight away till nine o'clock.

22:50.680 --> 22:55.840
It's just childcare, you know, pack lunch, breakfast, getting them dressed,

22:56.240 --> 22:59.880
brushing their teeth, getting their bags, getting them in the car.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.680
I mean, it sounds like that's easy.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.640
No, with three young kids, it's hilarious.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.720
You know, you go, right, kids go upstairs, get ready, half an hour later.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.440
You go up, they'll sit around and they're under where playing.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.480
And you're like, what the heck?

23:10.480 --> 23:13.480
We've got five minutes to get to school and you're just still naked.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.080
You know, I mean, it's like herding cats.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.120
And then I dropped them off at school.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.360
And then my day starts at nine, but by 2.30 p.m.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.440
I need to be ready to pick up the kids, take them to after school club,

23:26.440 --> 23:30.920
Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, make them tea, do bath time, bedtime.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.920
And like, you know, what time is it now?

23:32.920 --> 23:34.720
You know, eight, nine o'clock.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.840
You know, I mean, I don't normally do podcasts in the evening,

23:36.840 --> 23:39.040
but I really wanted to speak to you because you're amazing.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
I love you.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.600
And but, you know, like this time of night, I'm normally winding down.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.880
So I've got a very wince short window in which to do some work,

23:46.880 --> 23:51.560
but most of my day childcare, man, it's like, so I don't have time.

23:51.560 --> 23:56.000
I don't have time to be messing around on the phone and reading other things.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.440
And maybe some people think, oh, you know, he never posts what we put up and look at him.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.040
It's not deliberate.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.960
I'm not ignoring people.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.080
It's just, I don't have the time and I don't really do that kind of stuff.

24:07.080 --> 24:07.520
Do you know what I mean?

24:07.520 --> 24:09.240
I think it's a very good principle.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.960
I mean, if you're not setting a pattern of, of, of only, I don't know,

24:13.960 --> 24:18.320
reposting a fingle dang or something like that, then I guess it's okay.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.960
You know, I mean, don't repost anybody.

24:20.800 --> 24:29.120
Um, I wonder what that does for the, the algorithm and how your, your reach would change

24:29.120 --> 24:33.600
if you reposted people or not reposting people and how that could be measured.

24:33.600 --> 24:38.280
Cause that's one of the things I think if we're ever going to, I think, do you,

24:38.280 --> 24:42.960
have you ever heard of this deep federated blogging, microblogging, you know,

24:42.960 --> 24:45.920
where everybody has their own little Twitter that's connected to each other?

24:46.760 --> 24:51.720
Um, there's a, like Mastodon is an app that does that.

24:51.800 --> 24:56.200
Um, and soapbox is another one that does it.

24:56.200 --> 25:02.000
There's, there are ways for us to build a network of Twitter, like servers that

25:02.000 --> 25:05.760
would allow all of us to communicate and follow each other, but then have a more

25:05.760 --> 25:10.840
organic, um, you know, flood of information just from the people you want to hear from.

25:10.920 --> 25:15.800
Um, it's very similar to how peer tube works, where you can have your own video

25:15.800 --> 25:19.280
server, but then connect to other people's video servers so that you can serve their

25:19.280 --> 25:20.120
videos up to.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.480
And so then you make a network of trusted, trusted content producers.

25:24.560 --> 25:29.120
Um, I think peer tube France is probably the best example of that.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.200
That's probably the biggest peer tube server there is, but they, that's a pretty impressive

25:33.200 --> 25:33.800
example.

25:33.800 --> 25:40.200
Um, I don't know, but maybe that's the way we need to go forward, but for now, um, for

25:40.200 --> 25:48.640
now, I think well, you're, you're sort of, um, angle, if I can say it that way of, of

25:48.640 --> 25:54.440
trying your best to let people speak for themselves, um, is, is doing really well.

25:54.480 --> 26:00.720
I think that's unfortunately for, for people that maybe didn't get what they wanted

26:00.720 --> 26:04.000
out of an interview with you, like maybe that's how Robert Malone feels.

26:04.000 --> 26:04.440
I don't know.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.720
I thought it was a great interview.

26:06.320 --> 26:12.240
Um, if he feels like he didn't get what he expected or wanted, it's, it's really not because

26:12.240 --> 26:13.640
of the questions that you asked.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.640
It's, I don't know.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.560
It's, they're always, I don't know.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.600
I feel like you're a pretty straightforward guy.

26:17.600 --> 26:24.840
You're not too, not too, um, not too pushy on anybody and you're doing a really, uh, nice job.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.080
And so I would say, I have to thank the MI six.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.120
The MI six have done a great job coaching me.

26:32.120 --> 26:32.280
Right.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.200
They're after effect.

26:35.040 --> 26:35.400
Right.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.600
I mean, they're after effects team is fantastic.

26:37.600 --> 26:37.720
Right.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.240
Listen, you mentioned something about, um, I can.

26:41.480 --> 26:45.960
And before that, you're saying, like, you know, the people who have been in anti vaccine

26:45.960 --> 26:48.640
movement or promoting like common sense.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.480
And it's time to like tag them or something, to tag out or whatever.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.080
Are you talking about people like Dell big tree and stuff like that?

26:57.080 --> 26:58.200
Are you talking about those kind of?

26:58.200 --> 27:02.040
No, I don't think any, I don't think he, I don't think he needs tagging out.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.760
But I think if you looked, for example, at the people who are actually in the movie

27:05.760 --> 27:13.600
vax, those parents who, who fought before I can really became something and fought

27:13.600 --> 27:17.200
before CHD became something, those parents are still fighting.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.400
Those parents are still touring around and they're still talking and they're

27:20.400 --> 27:21.520
still testifying.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.560
Yeah, my son is real and he still is messed up.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.640
And, and to me, it's really time for.

27:28.640 --> 27:35.000
There have to be more people like you and me who, for whatever blessings and luck,

27:35.000 --> 27:43.000
don't have a devastatingly damaged child from any of these products, but understand the biology

27:43.000 --> 27:47.400
well enough to know that these parents aren't crazy and that their kids were actually damaged

27:47.400 --> 27:52.120
by them and, and start to, you know, really move this ball forward.

27:52.120 --> 27:58.440
And I think it's, it's parents like you and me with, with lucky enough to have three

27:58.440 --> 28:05.600
beautiful kids, all of whom are for whatever twisted reason, fully vaccinated, I don't

28:05.600 --> 28:13.040
know what else to say other than we need to, to, to take the lead here now and, and, and

28:13.040 --> 28:19.280
start to contribute to this movement because they've already done a decade, a decade of

28:19.280 --> 28:21.720
blood, sweat and tears that have gotten the ball this far.

28:21.720 --> 28:26.600
Now COVID's given us this opening and they're not going to be the ones who push it because

28:26.600 --> 28:30.320
they're the ones who are like Andrew Wakefield, you've interviewed him, but nobody's going

28:30.320 --> 28:35.680
to take him seriously because of the 10 years media campaign that permanently brainwashed

28:35.680 --> 28:40.760
people not to take him seriously irrespective of how much logic and sense comes out of his

28:40.760 --> 28:44.440
mouth time after time that the cameras put on it.

28:44.440 --> 28:49.280
We need new people to, to say that those people were right.

28:49.280 --> 28:56.080
And that can include people like David Resnick and, and, and, and people who questioned viruses

28:56.080 --> 28:58.200
before this one.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
We really do.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.720
All of us need to be humble.

29:01.720 --> 29:06.640
And I think that's, that's what you've been able to manage to do very well.

29:06.640 --> 29:11.960
And I think it's the line that I'm at least consciously trying to walk.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.400
You want to get angry and you want to have a fire, but you also want to be humble and

29:15.400 --> 29:16.720
you don't know everything.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.520
We definitely do everything.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.800
I definitely don't know everything.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.440
I mean, to be honest, I, I just have so many questions.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.120
I reached out to my supporters.

29:24.120 --> 29:28.840
I had some questions on my own and, you know, all the doctors in the UK that were pushing

29:28.840 --> 29:33.040
the COVID vaccine and flu vaccine and childhood schedule vaccine.

29:33.040 --> 29:39.240
I wrote an open letter on my sub stack saying, guys, come on my, come on my show, you know,

29:39.240 --> 29:42.120
come on, just let's have a chat, you know, I'll be honest with you.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.280
I, I don't trust any of this stuff, but you clearly do.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.360
So let's, let's smash it out.

29:47.360 --> 29:51.240
Tell me why you believe in this and you want, I'm not going to trip you up here.

29:51.240 --> 29:56.280
All my questions turned out to be a hundred and one questions turned out to be more than

29:56.280 --> 29:57.440
I saw.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.760
And they're the funny thing is we could have gone longer.

29:59.760 --> 30:03.960
We could have got, we could have added more questions and, you know, like, for example,

30:03.960 --> 30:10.080
today, someone said to me, you know, just ask them this one question, name one ingredient

30:10.080 --> 30:15.800
in a vaccine that is beneficial to your health that, you know what, you would want that ingredient

30:15.800 --> 30:16.800
in your body.

30:16.800 --> 30:22.000
But you take it as a supplement, name one, one ingredient and change it.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.280
I was like, geez, man, I mean, I have to give it out to him Darren Nesbitt, right?

30:26.280 --> 30:32.520
He's the writer of the light newspaper here in the UK is a musician by background and

30:32.520 --> 30:35.000
he set up this newspaper called the light.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
And so he was on my podcast.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
He was like, that's my one question.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.520
And I was like, that's a goddamn good question, you know, name one ingredient you would one

30:43.520 --> 30:47.320
from any vaccine and say, yeah, I would take that as a pill and a supplement.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.080
I can't think of anything.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.080
Can you think of anything?

30:50.080 --> 30:53.200
No, I think even more important you should make sure that you say that you wouldn't take

30:53.200 --> 30:57.040
it as a pill or a supplement, but that you would want them to inject in you because that's

30:57.040 --> 30:58.040
what they do.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.040
Exactly.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.840
And it's an extra important, mm hmm.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
Yeah.

31:02.840 --> 31:06.240
Anyway, so I'm moving on.

31:06.240 --> 31:10.000
I've been speaking to a few people and my, you know, one of the things, like I said, I'm

31:10.000 --> 31:13.320
on this journey of trying to figure out what's going on.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.320
Was there a virus?

31:14.320 --> 31:15.320
Was there not?

31:15.320 --> 31:16.320
Was there a pandemic?

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
Was there not?

31:17.320 --> 31:19.440
I don't think there was a pandemic in the sense that there was a deadly pandemic killing

31:19.440 --> 31:22.000
lots of people, infecting lots of people.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.720
The way it was geographically, you know, fixed along state lines and countries and borders.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.560
That's really weird how you had these weird outbreaks.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.840
I mean, people are flying shooting around the world and like it wasn't spreading like

31:34.840 --> 31:37.200
a natural infection.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.200
It wasn't.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.200
It doesn't.

31:39.280 --> 31:45.680
I mean, the all cosmetality in most, most countries in 2020 was like a nothing burger.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.040
And actually all cosmetalities only gone up in the last, you know, year two.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.600
So 2020 wasn't really a pandemic as far as I'm concerned.

31:53.600 --> 31:58.120
I don't care about the official definition of a pandemic and whether it was called a pandemic

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
by the who or not.

31:59.120 --> 32:04.600
To me, it wasn't a pandemic, but there was, I feel still, honestly, JJ, there was something

32:04.600 --> 32:08.120
because I had something in 2020 in January.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.560
I had something like I never had before.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.520
I got really unwell at this barking dry cough.

32:12.520 --> 32:17.080
I can tell you why, because my wife was very sympathetic, she would say, can you stop

32:17.080 --> 32:18.080
coughing like that?

32:18.080 --> 32:19.080
And I was like, I can't help it.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.400
And it was this dry, sharp cough.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.040
And then it went, I got better than it went to my chest.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.520
Then I got really unwell and I lost sense of smell for like four months.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.280
And I've never had that.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.560
I mean, I had a raging fever.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.520
It was weird.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.360
Did you say four months?

32:38.360 --> 32:40.000
Yeah, I lost sense of smell for four months.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.960
You lost smell for four months.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.960
Yeah.

32:42.960 --> 32:43.960
That must have sucked.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.960
That's me.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.240
That's lame.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.280
I couldn't taste anything.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.480
Like it was everything that's bland, right?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.080
It was bland.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.440
Everything was bland.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.680
And then when it came back, I was like, Oh my God, I can taste the game.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.040
So I mean, it could have been a fluke.

32:59.040 --> 32:59.760
It could have been a cold.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.720
People say you lose your senses, but I've never had anything like that.

33:02.720 --> 33:07.480
So I kind of think there was something, but, you know, what it was.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.840
Was it radiation?

33:08.840 --> 33:09.960
Was it toxin?

33:09.960 --> 33:11.080
Was it EMS?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.440
Was it, like you said, the viral clones?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.760
I'm open to all of that kind of stuff.

33:15.760 --> 33:19.440
Was it what kind of a med student or what kind of a doctor were you?

33:19.440 --> 33:21.760
Are you a guy that?

33:21.760 --> 33:25.720
Were you really fired up about being a surgeon and like, you know, showed up on

33:25.720 --> 33:29.760
time and early and fired up in the room and got scrubbed in before everybody

33:29.760 --> 33:31.760
else and whatever?

33:31.840 --> 33:36.920
Because in that mindset, if you would have gotten sick like this, you'd have

33:36.920 --> 33:38.000
still gone in, right?

33:38.200 --> 33:41.040
You'd have still showed up for class or you would have been at your

33:41.040 --> 33:42.520
internship for sure.

33:42.960 --> 33:50.040
And you would have not registered as well as you did now.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.120
I'm not saying that you encountered this before.

33:52.120 --> 33:57.160
I can't argue with that, but I know from an American's perspective that we

33:57.160 --> 34:00.400
would have gone to work and we would have tried to ignore the symptoms no

34:00.400 --> 34:03.960
matter how bad they were because we use our sick vacation.

34:04.480 --> 34:11.480
And so when you're told by the, the, the TV that any little symptom could be

34:11.480 --> 34:14.560
evidence of a deadly disease that you might not die from, but your grandma

34:14.560 --> 34:18.360
might now all of a sudden it's something I've never had before.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.080
The details are very fine.

34:20.080 --> 34:23.320
And, you know, so I, I don't argue.

34:23.320 --> 34:30.320
I only suggest that the intense media hype would encourage all of us, even

34:30.320 --> 34:34.600
the smartest of us to reclassify what we would have before the pandemic

34:34.600 --> 34:36.280
probably tried our best to ignore.

34:36.600 --> 34:36.880
Yeah.

34:36.880 --> 34:41.080
But the thing is this was all pre pandemic before it was even, like this was

34:41.120 --> 34:44.560
January, where before anything was even hitting the news and the TV.

34:45.240 --> 34:49.560
And I still went to work except like the two days when I had a raging fever and I

34:49.560 --> 34:51.760
couldn't go, I'll be honest with you.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.680
You're 100% right.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.960
I was like, I need to get home and work and blah, blah.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.960
And two days out of fever, I was like, I'm not too unwell to go.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.360
And I would just like for like three weeks, just just carry on.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.000
And the funny thing is, my wife never got anything.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.440
My kids never got anything.

35:06.680 --> 35:07.920
And my patients never got anything.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.120
No one at work got anything.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.000
I was like, what is this?

35:10.280 --> 35:10.960
And it's funny.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.520
It was like my accountant, I had gone to my accountant during this period.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.120
My counter was like, man, you look like shit.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.480
You're shivering.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.120
I was like, yeah, I think I might have a fever.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.480
I was like sweating.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.160
He was like, you're, you're sweating.

35:23.160 --> 35:23.400
You're on.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.440
I was like, I'm no.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.400
And then he, and then he, and then four months later, he went,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.320
to my books to my books.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.440
Yeah, I was like, doctor, exactly.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.640
But honestly, I swear to God, like four, five months later, he rang me and said,

35:36.080 --> 35:39.120
I think you had COVID when you came to my office.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.480
Nice.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.000
You give it to him.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.240
Was he blaming you?

35:43.240 --> 35:44.520
No, he never had it.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
Never got it for me.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.560
No, it's not weird.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.000
I don't understand.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.800
Like, how does that work?

35:52.800 --> 35:57.280
Like, no, I, I, I have lots of theories and lots of cartoons.

35:57.280 --> 36:02.760
I can draw, but I think it's all very tempting and it gets you into a trap where

36:02.760 --> 36:05.400
you're getting into specifics that we can't know where.

36:06.400 --> 36:06.640
Yeah.

36:06.640 --> 36:10.840
I think the, the thing that you started out with is the most important thing to always

36:10.840 --> 36:15.440
recall is that is there a reason for us to have to explain something?

36:16.960 --> 36:19.240
And, and, and I don't, I don't know.

36:19.720 --> 36:24.160
I like Paul Alexander's take that if we had done nothing in 2020, we would have

36:24.160 --> 36:26.200
noticed nothing in 2020.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.280
Um, and there may have been something that went around that some people got

36:30.280 --> 36:34.560
really sick, but then never would have been on the news and, and nobody would

36:34.560 --> 36:35.680
have complained about it.

36:35.760 --> 36:39.240
Um, but something happened in, in New York.

36:39.320 --> 36:44.360
I mean, you're aware of Jessica Hawkins work or, or her, her spiel that there's

36:44.360 --> 36:47.040
this peak that looks like a bomb went off.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.000
And then it goes right back down to baseline.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.560
Um, and never comes back.

36:51.000 --> 36:51.520
Mm.

36:51.520 --> 36:56.880
And that's an extraordinary event, um, that at least I know in America was

36:56.880 --> 37:01.040
definitely used by the PBS NewsHour and everybody to project.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.800
And you guys know well in the UK projections were very important in terms

37:05.800 --> 37:08.440
of getting the worst case scenario accepted early on.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.520
And it's the same as that lumber day area.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.880
It feels like a bomb went off there.

37:13.200 --> 37:13.800
So what do you think?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.120
What, what did happen?

37:15.240 --> 37:17.440
Did a biological bomb go off?

37:17.440 --> 37:18.960
Was there dispersals?

37:18.960 --> 37:19.960
I mean, aerosols.

37:19.960 --> 37:20.920
I mean, what the frack happened?

37:20.920 --> 37:26.160
You know, I do know that, um, that very recently, Sasha Latopova has speculated

37:26.160 --> 37:30.160
that the DOD released, um, a toxin of some kind.

37:30.160 --> 37:35.360
I just heard her on Shannon Joy, um, speculate that there was no pandemic,

37:35.440 --> 37:42.280
but in order to see the narrative of a pandemic, the US DOD released some kind

37:42.280 --> 37:45.200
of neurotoxin like James Giordano explained.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.720
I don't, I don't think that's a very good set of, of assumptions, but that's

37:49.720 --> 37:52.960
definitely been, she definitely speculated that way.

37:52.960 --> 37:58.200
I, I don't, I'm kind of of the opinion that really dumb ideas can

37:58.200 --> 37:59.760
account for almost all of this.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.800
Um, I don't know how you feel.

38:04.120 --> 38:04.560
Yeah.

38:04.560 --> 38:11.360
I, the thing is, the way I feel is I'm very wary of people who are very

38:11.360 --> 38:15.480
confident and saying, this is a problem.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.880
This is the reason why everything happened.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.240
Um, you know, um, and, and this is a cause.

38:24.400 --> 38:28.360
You know, they're, they're happy pinning their flag to one mass.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.520
And I'm very wary of that.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.800
I just, like when people say this is it, this, this is a 100%.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.000
I'm like, man, really just keep an open mind.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.320
Just keep an open mind.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.480
Let's stick to basics.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.520
All cause mortality.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.160
Was there a pandemic in the true sense?

38:46.160 --> 38:48.640
No, um, did something happen?

38:48.640 --> 38:51.120
Yes, some dodgy shit was going on.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.360
Did we have some dodgy host hospital protocols?

38:54.400 --> 38:54.920
Yeah.

38:55.240 --> 39:00.520
Did people die earlier than planned because of remdesivir and medazalam

39:00.520 --> 39:03.080
and morphine and the protocols and the intubations?

39:03.120 --> 39:03.640
Yeah.

39:04.120 --> 39:08.480
Was there bad coding, well, deliberately bad coding, miscoding,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.400
labeling people with COVID deaths?

39:10.440 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:11.400 --> 39:16.640
Was there still this massive all spike cause and all spike outside all

39:16.640 --> 39:18.240
cause mortality spike in 2020?

39:18.240 --> 39:19.720
No, despite all this, right?

39:20.080 --> 39:22.560
And, but you, it's almost like the people who were going to die.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.760
We rushed them along a little bit and said, look, all these people who died,

39:25.760 --> 39:27.480
but actually they were probably would have died anyway.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.120
Right.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.960
So overall in that year, it wasn't any more than normal.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.360
You look at the average age of people who died.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.120
They're over the off COVID.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.800
They were over the average age of life expectancy.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.760
They're like 82 or 80 or something like that.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.560
You know, so when you look at these and then, and what else can you tell?

39:44.560 --> 39:47.480
You can tell that, you know, medical ethics went out the window and

39:47.480 --> 39:49.360
informed consent wasn't existing.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.680
There was dodgy trials when it came to these so-called vaccines.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.040
They aren't vaccines.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.280
They're gene therapies.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.280
You know, manufacturing process was different when it was a mass rollout.

39:59.880 --> 40:03.560
Um, they, they gave the placebo group the shots that totally

40:03.560 --> 40:07.640
contravened what they're meant to be doing, even with the EUA application.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.560
And it just goes on and on and on.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.720
I mean, these are the knowns.

40:10.960 --> 40:16.200
So the unknowns we can speculate, but don't, don't say this is it.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.200
So for example, there's another guy who's out there.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.600
He's written a book now.

40:21.160 --> 40:25.680
So I think, you know, he's really pinned his flag to this mass, which is you

40:25.680 --> 40:29.200
can account for everything because of the bolus thing.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.920
See, you know, basically.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.440
Are you telling me that Mark Giridot has a book?

40:33.440 --> 40:33.760
Yes.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.080
Does he really have a book?

40:35.080 --> 40:39.760
Oh, no, you've got a book now and he's pushing everything because of the bolus.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.520
And not just that.

40:41.520 --> 40:46.840
He goes, all vaccines, all the vaccine injuries, pretty much majority of them

40:46.840 --> 40:48.440
are because of the bolus problem.

40:48.440 --> 40:54.720
If you fix the bolus, if you aspirate and slowly inject this toxin, you can

40:54.720 --> 40:56.240
get rid of most of your complicated.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.120
I mean, how dangerous is this stupid theory?

40:58.120 --> 40:58.840
Wow.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.440
That is spectacular.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.360
He's been pushing that in Panda for a couple of years now.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.160
Right.

41:04.160 --> 41:08.600
And I've, I've had a number of shouting arguments with him about it.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.720
Um, it's just unfortunate.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.480
I don't understand how he can be so.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.720
And it's not that I've ever argued that, that it couldn't play a role.

41:18.160 --> 41:22.920
It's not that I've ever argued that, that there isn't a difference between true

41:22.920 --> 41:27.680
intramuscular or true subcutaneous or true intravenous injection.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.480
They are different.

41:29.120 --> 41:34.520
Um, but this he ties a bunch of interesting things together that are

41:34.520 --> 41:38.520
actually not related, like the effect that, that bodybuilders feel when they

41:38.520 --> 41:44.480
inject their steroids in the wrong place, or it just like, then I don't

41:44.480 --> 41:45.200
get wrong.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.320
Don't get me wrong.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.360
I mean, there's, there's, look, there's definitely like, it's interesting.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.680
I would say that's interesting.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.640
Maybe 5% of the problems we're seeing are down to this.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.840
Maybe we need to look further into it.

41:57.880 --> 42:02.000
We need to get a study and analyze it and scientifically prove it.

42:03.240 --> 42:07.160
But it just, like I said, it's this, there's too many people out there who are

42:07.160 --> 42:09.560
just like, this is what it's all about.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.960
This is the, this I've cracked the code.

42:12.440 --> 42:17.760
And I don't know whether it's ego or what, but people really get captured

42:17.760 --> 42:19.280
in their own ideas.

42:19.280 --> 42:23.880
And it's just like, man, just can't, can't, can't miss the mammoth.

42:24.280 --> 42:27.760
Anyway, you know, what I wanted to ask you was what's really interesting is,

42:27.760 --> 42:29.200
look at this picture I was going to show you.

42:29.680 --> 42:35.000
Um, who's got the most biological labs around the world?

42:35.160 --> 42:36.840
Which country is the most?

42:37.560 --> 42:39.600
You know, what's this map going to look like?

42:41.040 --> 42:41.640
Can you see it?

42:42.680 --> 42:45.800
US biolabs around the world.

42:46.520 --> 42:46.920
Right.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.120
I mean, it's US bio.

42:48.240 --> 42:48.640
Oh, yeah.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.800
Well, we have a lot of those.

42:50.400 --> 42:50.960
I mean, look at that.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.960
I mean, this is like in 25 countries.

42:52.960 --> 42:59.920
And, and by the way, in some countries, for example, in Ukraine, I might be wrong,

42:59.960 --> 43:02.760
but it was anywhere between 18 to 25.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.920
So when you see one of these hazard bio, hazard signs,

43:05.920 --> 43:10.560
yeah, but those were all those were all associated with, um, with Nathan

43:10.560 --> 43:14.640
Wolf and, and meta biota and Hunter Biden.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.800
So they're totally okay.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.760
I mean, they were all, I mean, that's all fine.

43:17.800 --> 43:22.040
We know those guys, those are Americans that have already been checked on the list.

43:22.040 --> 43:22.560
They're fine.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.760
We don't, you can ignore that.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.920
Those guys, yeah, they're good guys.

43:26.920 --> 43:32.040
I mean, like, but I mean, I mean, like, so it's crazy.

43:32.200 --> 43:39.520
You know, the question I want to ask is, why does the US have bio labs in 25 countries

43:40.120 --> 43:43.080
and in some countries and some instances more than one?

43:43.560 --> 43:48.160
So we're talking about a lot of labs doing a lot of weird shit.

43:48.200 --> 43:53.000
What is it up to or or it's also possible that it could be labs where they,

43:53.720 --> 43:58.400
they pay some random guy to go sit in a room and, and fax things around and

43:58.400 --> 44:01.320
make it seem like there's all these labs.

44:01.960 --> 44:06.600
And only a couple of them might be doing something useful, like the one at four

44:06.600 --> 44:09.840
Dietrich or the one in the Rocky Mountain laboratories.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.560
And then now you have this illusion that's just sitting, look at all these bio labs.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.400
They've got, he only need one.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.560
If you're just going to make a, make a sequence and distribute it.

44:18.560 --> 44:18.920
I don't know.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.680
I'm just trying to play devil's advocate.

44:20.680 --> 44:21.840
I know we have a lot of labs.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.320
I know I've seen that map before, but, but I wonder to what extent these are real

44:26.320 --> 44:31.600
versus just, I don't know, cover for basic arms smuggling or people

44:31.600 --> 44:33.840
smuggling or whatever other crap that they do.

44:34.400 --> 44:39.520
I'm not saying America's got some kind of, you know, otherwise untarnished record.

44:39.520 --> 44:43.960
I'm just saying that the I still am seeing worst case scenario everywhere.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.400
And it's a, it's a fake worst case scenario.

44:46.440 --> 44:50.600
And this, these bio weapon labs might be part of that fake work worst case scenario.

44:50.640 --> 44:55.920
I mean, Nathan Wolf, he's either a really serious

44:56.960 --> 45:08.560
biology, you know, insightful thought, thought leader among among very smart people,

45:08.560 --> 45:09.640
or he's a stooge.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.320
And my guess is he's a stooge.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
He's got a book.

45:12.520 --> 45:20.440
He's, he's associated with, with Jazane Maxwell's, whatever fake UN thingy thing.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.680
She did planet Terra Mar or something like that.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.120
I don't know who we're talking about.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.600
I don't even know who this, I don't even know who this person is.

45:27.960 --> 45:34.280
Remember, Nathan, Nathan, we were talking about Nathan Wolf because he's got associations

45:34.280 --> 45:36.120
with a lot of these Ukrainian laboratories.

45:36.120 --> 45:43.080
And Nathan Wolf was a gain of function, virology, seller of mythology back before it was cool.

45:43.080 --> 45:47.960
Already in 2011, he had a book called, I was looking for it.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.480
Mm.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.360
I see, I see, I see, I see a mask out of it.

45:53.440 --> 46:01.000
And he was already the guy, his company pioneered metagenomic sequencing, which is taking

46:01.000 --> 46:07.200
very tiny fragments of genomic material purported to be found in nature and reassorting them

46:07.200 --> 46:11.160
into, into new discoveries in life.

46:11.160 --> 46:17.480
He gave old TED talks about how there was this black, what did he call it?

46:17.480 --> 46:22.960
He called it black biology or dark biology from which he was going to discover many new

46:22.960 --> 46:27.840
life forms and basically what he meant was metagenomic sequencing, finding viruses.

46:27.840 --> 46:33.400
And so that started already a way, way, you know, a decade ago with this guy who, who,

46:34.000 --> 46:40.480
yeah, has ties to a lot of the highest parts of this, of this show from the UN to

46:42.120 --> 46:43.480
a lot of these vaccines.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.680
It's so complicated.

46:46.680 --> 46:51.000
I'm just, I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm just, what am I doing?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.520
I'm navigating through this shit show called life.

46:54.720 --> 47:02.320
I mean, I was under the impression that, you know, the evil cabal wants to get a one world

47:02.320 --> 47:03.360
government going.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.360
I, you know, I had the thought today.

47:05.960 --> 47:06.840
I don't know what you think of this.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.640
I actually think to have the one world government, I think they've got it.

47:10.720 --> 47:11.520
They've actually got it.

47:11.960 --> 47:15.840
You know, there, there's, there are people, the Mafia and the East and the West.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.000
They're all at the table.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.760
They're all jostling and fighting amongst each other.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.120
But who's going to be top dog?

47:21.880 --> 47:27.160
And all they haven't done is publicly say, this is a one world government.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.440
If you think about it, we're all slaves.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.760
We're all financial slaves.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.840
Tax burden is humongous.

47:36.560 --> 47:40.880
90%, you know, plus socially we're conditioned.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.920
Psychologically, we're manipulated.

47:44.640 --> 47:45.560
We're soft.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.240
We seek comfort.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.480
We don't want to be responsible for anything.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.240
We're consuming garbage and gloop.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.800
We're sick and dying.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.680
And I'm and they're in charge.

47:59.200 --> 48:03.440
And everywhere you go, no matter where you go in the world, it's the same

48:03.440 --> 48:05.600
shit happening in the past.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.720
People left for America because things were really bad in their home countries.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.880
And they were, we're going to the land of the free, you know, you could, you could pack

48:13.120 --> 48:17.800
I mean, you didn't go to America because the land was paved with gold.

48:17.800 --> 48:20.920
You know, the roads, it's because things are so shit back home.

48:20.920 --> 48:24.160
You would literally put everything in your suitcase and leave.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.600
But now where would you leave?

48:27.680 --> 48:28.720
Where would you go?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.800
Like everywhere is the same.

48:31.280 --> 48:33.320
And the reality is we've got this.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.600
I think we were already there.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.280
We already got this one world government.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.560
It's just not opening.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.760
Well, you're frightening me.

48:39.760 --> 48:44.680
I mean, we have we have this discussion a lot because my wife is Dutch and she has

48:44.680 --> 48:48.640
a absolutely fantastic, beautiful, extended family in Holland.

48:49.360 --> 48:54.760
And you may or may not be aware, but I'm not really speaking to my parents right now

48:54.760 --> 48:57.680
because they think I'm an idiot and my brother does too.

48:58.760 --> 49:01.520
And so you haven't told me that.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.200
I'm sorry about that.

49:02.200 --> 49:02.840
Oh, it's OK.

49:03.360 --> 49:08.680
But it does make it interesting that we moved to America thinking that me and my

49:08.680 --> 49:12.600
kids and my wife would be closer to my American family for the first time since

49:12.600 --> 49:14.520
we became a family.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.400
And then that ended pretty abruptly with the pandemic.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.720
And now there's a lot less holding us here in America.

49:21.720 --> 49:29.840
But the Netherlands is 17 plus million people with huge immigration issues and cultural

49:29.840 --> 49:31.000
integration issues.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.600
And it's surrounded on all sides by other countries with the same problems.

49:35.600 --> 49:42.360
And so the what used to be in my mind, like, I could not believe how lucky I was to do

49:42.360 --> 49:47.760
my PhD in Amsterdam from like to thought.

49:47.760 --> 49:53.000
I mean, just the time that I was there was like maybe the best the best time ever to be

49:53.000 --> 49:54.280
a resident of that city.

49:54.280 --> 49:59.240
And I walked away with a beautiful Dutch woman in love with me and in love with her in a way

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
we went.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.440
But going back there, I don't feel the same like, Oh, my gosh,

50:04.440 --> 50:07.240
I would never think like I'm going to get on the plane right now.

50:07.240 --> 50:13.480
In fact, we would have already probably, um, we had the excuse to leave a couple of times

50:13.480 --> 50:15.880
already, but it's just not the same place.

50:15.880 --> 50:19.520
It was 10 years ago when we met or 20 is his time.

50:19.520 --> 50:23.960
It's not, man, 20 years ago, 20 years ago, it's our 10th on the right anniversary this

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
year.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.160
I mean, the thing is Holland's in a bad place.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.920
I mean, the war on the farmers, Holland, Germany, I mean, Ireland, I mean, it's everywhere

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
in Europe.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.920
I mean, I speak to a lot of guests.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.600
Have you been able to talk to anybody related to that?

50:38.600 --> 50:41.840
Have you ever been, have you done any interviews with people related to those movements?

50:41.840 --> 50:42.840
No, not yet.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
Not yet.

50:43.840 --> 50:47.600
I do want to, but I haven't got around to it yet.

50:47.600 --> 50:50.200
I know a farmer and he's got some links.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.200
I haven't just got around to it.

50:51.200 --> 50:56.480
I mean, the reality is JJ, I mean, I'm booked up to me right now with my podcast and I'm

50:56.480 --> 50:57.480
backlogged as well.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.880
And I've just had so many guests that wanted to speak.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.640
And you're not a farmer, although you are a chicken farmer.

51:02.640 --> 51:08.080
You are a chicken farmer, but, you know, doesn't, might not qualify you to fully understand

51:08.080 --> 51:11.560
all the subtleties of global agriculture, though.

51:11.560 --> 51:17.520
Yeah, but I know a little bit about a lot of things, you know, and I know roughly what's

51:17.520 --> 51:18.520
going on.

51:18.520 --> 51:23.120
And there's a war and farming, a war on food, and I'm worried about what they're trying

51:23.120 --> 51:24.120
to do.

51:24.120 --> 51:29.560
They're trying to create like everything, a shortage, and then the crisis.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.440
And then, you know, you create the problem.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.440
You have a reaction.

51:32.440 --> 51:33.440
They have a solution.

51:33.440 --> 51:38.840
The solution is you eat gluten, you eat insect burgers, you live in these 15 minute cities.

51:38.840 --> 51:43.920
You have universal basic income and you'd be thankful to the state and you plug in and

51:43.920 --> 51:47.680
watch social media and porn and Netflix and whatever else.

51:47.680 --> 51:50.720
And you don't question the state and you'd be grateful for the state.

51:50.720 --> 51:56.520
You roll up your arm, you take your shot, you have this army of workers that just work

51:56.520 --> 52:03.320
in these complexes and the elites live in their parkland, you know, the states, the

52:03.320 --> 52:09.400
size of Luxembourg, you know, jetting around in their planes and helicopters while we all

52:09.400 --> 52:11.160
walk everywhere and cycle everywhere.

52:11.160 --> 52:14.360
I mean, that's, I think that's ultimately what they want.

52:14.360 --> 52:16.040
It's interesting you said about your Dutch wife.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.680
You know, my wife has got Dutch roots.

52:18.680 --> 52:21.120
She's a Dutch wife as well.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
Her family came.

52:22.120 --> 52:24.720
Yeah, her family came over to the UK.

52:25.720 --> 52:34.200
About 200 years ago, but from Holland, they were Dutch Jewish family and then they converted

52:34.200 --> 52:35.200
to Christianity.

52:35.200 --> 52:39.240
Yeah, my wife, you know, it's got Dutch roots.

52:39.240 --> 52:47.840
So I was speaking to several of my guests and they've all moved, like a lot of them

52:47.840 --> 52:53.280
have actually moved to Mexico and they were in the States, they were in Europe or whatever.

52:53.280 --> 52:57.720
And then another in Mexico thinking they would be freer there and they go, it's better

52:57.720 --> 53:01.800
and it's, you know, it's a lot freer than Europe or whatever.

53:01.800 --> 53:04.800
But they all say the same thing, which is we can see it coming.

53:04.800 --> 53:13.000
The transgender, the 15-minute cities, the language and the policies, the politicians

53:13.000 --> 53:15.840
at the top level are all saying the same thing.

53:15.840 --> 53:20.680
So while locally, at the bottom, you know, you've still got conservative values, you've

53:20.680 --> 53:24.800
got, you know, they're Christian or whatever, they're a little bit more, you know, just

53:24.800 --> 53:25.800
conservative.

53:25.800 --> 53:30.800
But you can see the agenda, you can see the media, you can see the politicians all pushing

53:30.800 --> 53:34.120
what the WEF are pushing and they're saying it's just a matter of time.

53:34.120 --> 53:39.400
We're just five, 10 years behind America or Europe and they're scared because they're

53:39.400 --> 53:40.840
like, where do we go now?

53:40.840 --> 53:42.240
Like literally, what do you do?

53:42.240 --> 53:43.960
Go into the Amazon jungle?

53:43.960 --> 53:45.480
Like where, where can you run to?

53:45.480 --> 53:46.560
Where can you go?

53:46.560 --> 53:48.360
And it's like, I don't know.

53:48.360 --> 53:51.920
I feel like maybe we need to running away as an answer.

53:51.920 --> 53:57.200
We need to dig in our heels and we need to confront the beast and fight it everywhere

53:57.200 --> 54:02.760
we are, you know, and resist and it has to be at a local community level.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.640
I don't believe in saviors.

54:04.640 --> 54:09.840
I don't think RFK, junior or Trump or anyone else is going to save us.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.360
I don't believe in any of these figures.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
I'll be honest with you.

54:12.360 --> 54:14.800
I know it might upset some of the listeners.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.720
I don't think any of these people are the good guys.

54:17.720 --> 54:21.960
And even if they are the good guys on their own, they can't do jack shit.

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
Nope.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Nope.

54:23.960 --> 54:34.080
And in fact, I don't think they, I mean, the way that this puppet show works is obviously

54:34.080 --> 54:43.240
beyond me, but even the most optimistic person has to be realistic enough to understand that

54:43.240 --> 54:49.600
to reach the level of national notoriety is not accidental.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.040
And this day and age.

54:52.040 --> 54:57.440
And more importantly, we need to understand that even if they're not completely deciding

54:57.440 --> 55:03.480
who rises up, they are using the people who rise up for particular purposes.

55:03.480 --> 55:08.920
And even if you rise up, it could be, it could be very easily that somewhere or another,

55:08.920 --> 55:14.400
they could use you for how they want to use you unless you're keenly aware of it.

55:14.400 --> 55:20.320
And you know, they can still put us in a situation in a half a year where all the grocery stores

55:20.320 --> 55:21.520
are empty.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.000
And the only way to get your rations is to sign up for a digital ID.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.640
And that means that you can't stream anymore.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.880
I mean, how hard would it be for them to do this?

55:29.880 --> 55:36.960
This is what bothers me the most is that there are scenarios where I feel as though, you

55:36.960 --> 55:40.880
know, whatever way we're clawing forward right now can be completely stopped.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.760
And so we've got to act while we still can't.

55:42.760 --> 55:46.560
I really think that's why your work is so important, my mind's so important, why a lot

55:46.560 --> 55:52.320
of these, you know, these few people that are still clinging to the notion that we need

55:52.320 --> 55:57.080
to wake up and we miss something, we really need to push hard because I don't think this

55:57.080 --> 55:59.560
window is going to be open for very much longer.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.960
Sadly, I agree.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.400
I agree.

56:03.400 --> 56:08.000
And I think, I think unfortunately, things are going to get tough before they get better.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
I don't think these evil kebau baddies are going to win ultimately because if they were

56:15.000 --> 56:19.400
that powerful and they were going to be successful, they would have done it already.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.400
Right.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.400
It's as simple as that.

56:21.400 --> 56:22.400
I like that.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.400
It would have been.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.400
It would have been happened.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
We'd be.

56:25.400 --> 56:26.960
They actually can.

56:26.960 --> 56:33.200
And a lot of it is with despite all their money and power and heavies, you know, they're

56:33.200 --> 56:38.960
ultimately the wizards of all's, you know, behind the curtain, they're weak, pathetic,

56:38.960 --> 56:46.240
you know, sociopathic, psychopathic, probably squabbling amongst each other, petty, pathetic,

56:46.240 --> 56:51.080
soulless, godless, and there's nothing good about them.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.080
Right.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.040
So they can't be successful in the long term.

56:54.040 --> 56:59.640
They can be bullies and they can, they can have grandiose ideas about what they want

56:59.640 --> 57:00.640
to achieve.

57:00.640 --> 57:01.640
But I don't even think they're happy.

57:01.640 --> 57:02.640
They aren't there.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.640
What kind of people are these?

57:03.640 --> 57:04.640
They're not happy.

57:04.640 --> 57:12.840
So they're not going to win, but I think the lesson for humanity is unless the rest of

57:12.840 --> 57:25.840
us wake up and take responsibility and be real, true human beings who love and experience

57:25.840 --> 57:34.920
life and enjoy living and, you know, are happy in the now, not, oh, I'm going to work

57:34.920 --> 57:39.720
and then I'll be happy once I retire kind of mentality or, you know, I'll work hard

57:39.720 --> 57:44.720
now and, and I'll do this stupid job that I don't like and I'll pay off this and, and

57:44.720 --> 57:47.760
then, you know what, I'll go on a holiday and then I'll be happy because I went on my

57:47.760 --> 57:48.760
holiday.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.120
And no, no, no, we need to stop all this.

57:51.120 --> 57:54.200
We need to, we need to take charge of our lives now.

57:54.200 --> 57:56.280
We single one of us and take responsibility.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.400
We need to embrace the discomfort.

57:58.400 --> 58:01.560
We need to be happy every day that God gives us.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.760
We need to fight for everything.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.520
We need to not be soft.

58:06.520 --> 58:12.000
We're not, we should not seek comfort and a lot of that comfort, discomfort is mental.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
I don't mean physical.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.600
I don't mean like in the cold or hunger.

58:14.600 --> 58:19.920
I think a lot of people find discomfort in making decisions and having to think or being

58:19.920 --> 58:23.760
challenged in their world of you.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.760
And a lot of people shy away from this discomfort and go, I don't want to, I don't want to,

58:26.760 --> 58:33.960
I don't want to think, I'm going to abdicate this discomfort of thinking to the TV, to

58:33.960 --> 58:37.320
the news channel, to the government.

58:37.320 --> 58:40.440
And you know what, that's now more comfortable and I can relax.

58:40.440 --> 58:44.320
No, no, no, you know what, discomfort's nice.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.320
It's good.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.960
That's why I do an ice cold bath every morning.

58:47.960 --> 58:50.040
I love, I love it.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.000
You know, that's why I went for a hard run.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.520
I've never done that.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.520
Oh dude, you should.

58:54.520 --> 58:59.920
Oh my God, you should, right, seriously start doing it, man, it would change your life.

58:59.920 --> 59:01.240
That's why I went for the run today.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.080
It was pelting down the rain.

59:03.080 --> 59:06.560
I mean, last night I said to my wife, I'm going for a run to tomorrow.

59:06.560 --> 59:13.320
Even if it rains, lo and behold, it was raining hard and it was a muddy run and I was sliding

59:13.320 --> 59:16.760
around and I even fell once, JJ, it was hilarious.

59:16.760 --> 59:22.520
Thankfully, no one was there to witness me in this muddy field, but I fell and landed

59:22.520 --> 59:23.520
on my side.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.320
I was coated in mud.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.320
But it's fine.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.320
It was tough.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.320
It was cold.

59:28.320 --> 59:32.480
It was miserable in some respect, but it was really enjoyable in another respect.

59:32.480 --> 59:35.560
It was fun and I think people need to do that.

59:35.560 --> 59:40.240
They need to just stop being softy.

59:40.240 --> 59:45.880
And then then you take charge of your life, you know, then you don't need to stay anymore.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.240
Then you can go screw you.

59:48.240 --> 59:52.960
And I think I was speaking to someone who was from a communist country and he was saying,

59:52.960 --> 59:56.800
you know, Ahmed, when we lived in a communist country, we didn't protest.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.760
We didn't go out on the streets with banners and protest against the government.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.080
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.720
You get locked up if you did that.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:10.040
Now what we did was we ignored the state and we created an underground economy, an underground

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.240
culture, an underground network, an underground community and we would contact and deal and

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.800
we basically sidelined, you know, the government and the state and I thought, that's the way

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800
you do it.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.960
You create parallel structures, you know, just bypass them.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.320
So I'll give you a quick example.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.480
I'm sorry for ranting for so long.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.880
I really want you to speak for a while.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.640
But basically, you know, don't get your news source or information from mainstream media

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640
anymore.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.960
Don't just don't watch their bullshit news channels, you know, not even I used to do

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm guilty of let me just log in and let me just read the headlines.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Do you know what?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.320
I don't even do that now.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.200
And okay, maybe that means one or two days I'm out of the loop and I missed the headlines

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.640
until someone tells me and I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640
about.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640
King Charles has got cancer.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640
I'm like, really?

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.640
I don't know.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.120
Oh, it's all over the news.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.040
I was like, no idea, dude.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.160
It's like, I don't want to consume their crap.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.400
So you know what, consume your news from people like you or from me or some independent media

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.480
outlet, like Dan Cohen and all these other people go go there and food.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.360
Don't go to the supermarket.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.840
Go get your food from your local farm or your local community.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840
You know what?

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.080
Don't go to the hospital and get jobs.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.120
Stay fit and healthy yourself.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.120
Find local naturopath.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.320
How big of a town do you live in?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320
Is it a big city?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320
I'm sorry.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320
No, no, no.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.880
It's because I feel like Pittsburgh is really like on this cusp of where we can still sign

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.600
up for local farm produce and we can still sign up for meat from a local farm.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.560
But I wonder how people in bigger cities, I don't think it's so easy for them to do

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.560
that.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.240
And I think that's going to be where most of the pain is felt in the coming six months

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.440
or a year or cities where people can't get out, they can't escape.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.240
And they can't even have three chickens in their backyard because they don't have one.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240
I agree.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.480
I live in a village, sandwiched between two small towns.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480
Oh, nice.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480
That's nice.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480
Yeah.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480
It's nice.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.080
And, you know, opposite my house, it's just the field.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.200
Did the small towns play each other in football and fight about that or not really?

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200
No, really.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200
Not really.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:34.080
But I, honestly, I would love to have a homestead or a ranch in the States, 20 acres, goats,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.000
chickens, go hunting.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It's coming.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Eat deer.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
It's coming.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Where would I go though?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I mean, I was thinking.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.040
Savvania is a perfect place, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.520
We still have elk.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.520
You definitely want to come to Pennsylvania and it's not quite crowded as some of it.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.080
It's still close to the East Coast.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.040
You won't be flying quite so far when you want to go home.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.880
Pennsylvania is a good place.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.680
Maybe we can organize it in the same town.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.040
See, that's how we would do it.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.760
You'd want to group colonize someplace, wherever you went, you know, you'd want to

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.560
go to a small town with like you and me and Mike Eden and Danny Rancor and a few other

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.560
people and then we all bring our families to one place and take over the school board.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.080
That's, that would be ideal.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.800
Dude, I actually want to start.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.880
I'm seriously thinking about homeschooling as well.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.880
This is what I mean.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880
I'm not laughing.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.240
I know what you're facing over there in the UK, but here it's very much.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.200
I, we, we talk about it a lot.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.960
The problem is, is that it would fall on my wife probably and that's a big still a daunting

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
idea for her.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.400
My, our oldest son is going to be in high school next year.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.440
So he's going to be, yeah, it's, it's, I'm blowing my mind.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.440
It would fall on me.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.600
It would fall on me and I think I would enjoy it.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.880
I think it would, it would mean I would have to stop doing so many podcasts, but I think

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.920
a lot of my listeners would be like, thank God for that because you're putting too

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.840
much content out and keep getting to what I'm doing too much.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.800
Um, but yeah, I, I just look at what they're doing in the schools.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.440
There's a head teacher, retired head teacher here called Hugh McCarthy and Northern Ireland.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.320
It's one of the, you know, four countries that make up the UK and he was talking about

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.360
like, you know, the agenda from the who, like what they want to teach the kids.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.520
And this is like, like you can find it online, the who like, I can't remember the document

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.480
name, but talking about like young kids, like four or five teaching them how to masturbate

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:43.200
or get pleasure from their, you know, sexual, when then talking about their gender and things

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.440
are just inappropriate, man, like really inappropriate.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.920
Like, let children be children.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:54.000
Like whoever's writing this is a really twisted fracker.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.320
If you ask me, right, seriously twisted fracker and like, you don't want that for your kids.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.840
You want them to live in innocence for as long as possible and just enjoy life and things

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.880
will get really shit when they get older.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.320
They've got plenty of time to know all that, but confusing kids, things like gender and

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320
this and that.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:21.240
I mean, the way I look at it, I'm, I'm sorry, like anybody who's pushing kids with this

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.520
whole gender indoctrination, it's child abuse.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.920
It's simple as that.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
Yeah, I agree.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920
Absolutely.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920
It is.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:36.560
I mean, there's a million reasons why it's wrong, but what you're, what, what I think

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.880
is at the heart of it is the idea that anybody is in need of a fix.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:50.040
If anybody is born imperfect somehow and it's something that, that mankind has a fix for

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040
it.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.240
It is really a slippery slope that we have come very far down already where somehow or

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:02.360
another where they want us to believe that we're at the cusp of, of, of accepting all

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360
of it.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360
And I don't think that's true at all.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.040
They want us to believe that, but I don't think there are very many grown adults with

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.920
children that believe this and the ones that do just need, as you said, to be corrected

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.520
because it's child abuse.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.240
And we need to speak pretty clearly about it.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:24.520
I think few, very few people that are given a microphone are, are courageous enough to

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520
speak about it.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.160
But if you have children, then you must know.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.280
And if you don't know and you have children, then you're abusing them.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280
That's for sure.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280
Yeah.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280
So it's terrible.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.800
And you know the way I was saying this before, I was waiting for this to come back in my

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800
mind.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
And I'm glad that it did.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.920
I really think that for you and I, one of the things to think about with that particular

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.840
issue is to think back when we were kids.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.560
And I know that there are two people in my high school memories that I would designate

01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.080
as having been gay boys, and they probably knew it when they were in high school.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.640
And everybody else knew that they were different or that they liked other boys, but they never

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.720
really explicitly said it.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Yeah.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
Yeah.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:16.400
What I'm, what I would suggest is that those people would have been very much vulnerable

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.760
to a narrative where you're not gay, you're a woman trapped in a boy's body.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.960
And so we should, we should stop your puberty.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.960
Yeah.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:32.160
And we should change your body where in my imagination, you could convince a lot of these

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:38.400
kids not to do that by, I'm not sure if I should say this on your show.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.480
You can always, you can always take it off.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:47.840
But some, some part of me questions the idea that any of these kids are in touch with their

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.280
sexuality enough to know that their sexuality is incorrect.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:08:00.160
And if any of these kids that are gotten to before they themselves discover their own

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:07.600
bodies, before they've had an orgasm, it's an extraordinary thing to, to draw a conclusion

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.880
on before you've even explored how the machinery works, maybe your body hasn't even

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.360
gone through the changes to tell you how this machinery works yet.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.920
And so to already be encouraging children to doubt that is just phenomenal.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:30.160
And I think a lot of these teenage girls and teenage boys who are masquerading as, as transgender

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:38.600
could be cured of it with a weekend of, of, of coached exploration of their own sexuality.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.280
And they'd probably find out worst case scenario of their homosexual because their equipment

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.880
works fine and it feels pretty good and I don't really want to mess with it.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.320
Yeah, but it's funny you should say that I, you know, I heard someone say this whole transgender

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:57.360
thing is in some way quite homophobic because a lot of the people, it is, of course it is.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360
Yeah.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.360
This is what I'm talking about.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
It's terrifying.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:05.040
It's terrifying to think of all these kids when I was younger and even people that I

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.120
met in college that were very sure they were gay.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.000
When they were younger, they would have been targeted for this and they would have been

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.600
confused by adults that were sure this is real and that's frightening to me.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600
That's really frightening to me.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.320
So I think, I think the agenda is, I mean, let's talk about the etiology.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.280
I think the etiology is multifactorial.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:29.840
I think there's definitely something in the food and the water and these plastics, these

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840
hormone disruptors.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.320
So that's changing things.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:39.120
Then if you look at the diet and vegan diet and whatnot, and then, you know, these estrogens,

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.840
you've got these estrogen, you know, type foods.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.280
I mean, I had someone called Jay Riggley on who was talking about that.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.720
I need to publish that podcast, but basically you've got these really analogs to estrogen

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.240
and they're affecting men and boys and girls and they're feminizing the boys out there.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.840
So you've got that, you've got the food, you've got the diet, you've got the toxins.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.760
And then you've got the cultural societal thing.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.600
I feel like the gay community felt like, you know what, we need to be activists.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.560
A lot of them are very progressive leftists, right?

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.760
And that's constant revolution.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.720
You know, we want our rights.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.720
Now they've got everything.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.520
I mean, gays have got the rights and everything they wanted.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.960
And then it's like, well, what's the next thing?

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.440
What do we do to justify our existence?

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.240
You know, these charities, these organizations are pushing gay rights.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.520
How can they justify the funding, their jobs, their stat?

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.560
Well, let's just now it's trans, now it's LGBTQ plus, you know, it's one translate.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:46.240
So they've then pushed the agenda and then, and then just the state likes it, big farmer

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.280
likes it because you've got patients for life.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.400
You go down the medical industrial complex, you get puberty blockers, you get surgery.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.520
And also the state loves it because you're dependent on the state.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:04.360
You tell these kids, you know, your parents might not understand you, but we will.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.960
The government, the parents might not be there for you, but you can talk to us and

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.120
we'll be there to support you.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.040
So ultimately, what does this whole thing do?

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.840
It disrupts and breaks up the family unit.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.840
Now, if you also believe in the depopulation agenda, guess what?

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.440
If you've got a whole bunch of kids who've transitioned, sexually not functioning,

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.480
reproduction wise can't produce kids anymore.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480
Well, great.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.960
They're not going to be making babies.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.600
I mean, the whole thing, I mean, I just think it's very complicated.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.800
There's lots of little webs here, you know, another issue.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.600
I would agree with you.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.080
And I'm glad that you brought up the environmental toxicity in the whole story

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:53.240
because I do think that there's reason to believe that some of this shift has to

01:11:53.240 --> 01:12:01.440
do with disruption of normal development from these materials.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:07.600
But it still doesn't change the biology that we can't fix it.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:13.440
If there's a little boy who was exposed to the wrong chemicals and now is a little bit

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:20.240
androgynous, we can't fix that by mutilating him or by giving him drugs that will further

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.200
throw him off of a natural course of development.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.320
That's not ways to fix this.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.880
And that's the part that I find most disturbing is that the puberty blocking is just such

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.200
a ridiculous term for disrupting normal endocrine development.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.920
And it can't be set right again.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.040
Those changes are permanent and disrupted permanently.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.920
And the disfigurement that they are calling reassignment surgery is just that.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.920
It's disfigurement.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.120
It's no different than if you believed that your legs should be on your head.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.720
And they then sewed it on your head.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.640
They haven't fixed a problem.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.480
And so, yeah, it's diabolical.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.480
It's malevolent.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.480
It's yucky.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.240
So, listen, before we wrap up, JJ, tell me, what are you doing now?

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.680
You've got your live stream.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.400
Have you got a sub stack yet?

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:23.400
I have a sub stack where I put my transcript of my live stream and a published version

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.680
with subtitles of the video there.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.000
It's not really, it's kind of a repeat, but it's easier for people than Twitch.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.040
And it has the transcript so people can use some of the text, which is that people are

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.040
starting to like that.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.880
And I'm trying to work on a review to kind of follow up on some of the work that I've

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:44.320
been doing over the last three years and summarize some of these big, big, big ideas

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.840
about the biology and how it's been distorted.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.840
I think kind of in a similar way that you did with your, you know, I've got a million

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.680
questions for you doctors who have endorsing this stuff.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.040
I want to kind of add my own little thing that somebody like Mark Bailey has already

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.040
done.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.520
Somebody like Steph and Lanka has already done.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:11.880
I want to add another piece to this puzzle of virology and how it's been distorted into

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.840
a mythology that they're trapping us in.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.680
So I've got a lot of shout outs to give and a lot of hat tips to give to the people that

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.880
have come before us.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:26.320
But I think there are some pieces to this puzzle that I and others have been able to

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.040
add during the pandemic that need to be tacked on so that the whole big picture is really

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040
in one place.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.920
So I think that I don't know how far away I am.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.920
Yeah, Steph and Lanka.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.920
Yeah.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920
I mean, he's an interesting character.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.920
So he was a virologist who turned his back on virology and said the whole thing's a joke

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.080
and there's no such thing as viruses.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080
That's massive.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080
It is huge.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.400
I mean, there's no question about it.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:56.960
I mean, and his opinion and his writing has to be taken seriously.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.400
And I think it's just a, it's part of this bigger picture that I've been trying to lay

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:09.440
out on my stream is that my conclusion in a broad sense is that RNA virology has just

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.400
been exaggerated.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:17.560
And there are RNAs that can be identified and found and isolated and sequenced.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.840
But whether or not they grow indefinitely or whether or not they are causing a pandemic

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.560
is another story entirely.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.080
And I think that in order to perpetuate this mythology, they've used reverse genetics

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.400
to create the DNA and RNA that they can't find in nature and then tell us that it's

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400
equivalent.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:44.320
And if you had enough labs and you can create quite a story about what exists in nature and

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320
what doesn't.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.400
And I think that's where we are.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.640
And it started all the way back with that character we were talking about earlier, Nathan

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640
Wolf.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:58.720
He's one of the first, you know, public figures to be talking about this huge potentially,

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:05.640
you know, infinite source of new pathogens, dark biology or whatever it was, which was

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:11.200
really just metagenomic, the metagenomic sequencing applied to a background noise.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.480
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:18.400
There's a paper that just came out of preprint that everybody has started to talk about where

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:25.080
they've been able to identify a whole nother source of RNA in the background, including

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:30.120
the equivalent of virons that are circulating between all of our microbiome.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.840
So and in these virons includes RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.560
So there's this huge background of RNA that we've been told in 2020 didn't exist.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.800
It's just SARS-CoV-2 and we find it with PCR.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.840
And more and more, they're starting to slowly roll out the reveal that actually healthy

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:54.000
tissue communicates with RNA and sick tissue communicates with RNA and bacteria communicates

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.160
with RNA and bacteria phages use RNA and holy cow, there's a lot more RNA in the background

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.880
than we thought.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:07.840
And I think this is starting to really speak to the idea that an RNA background has been

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.320
used and conflated to create this molecular signal that everybody calls a pandemic.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.120
A lot of us have been fooled and that's OK.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.560
Yeah, I mean, you talked about how RNA is very fragile.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:28.480
And also when it replicates, it's got a really poor, you know, I don't know what the term

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.480
is, but it mutates or it has a lot of errors in it.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.640
So it doesn't reproduce identically.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:41.240
And so that for that reason, you just can't have an RNA pandemic and you talked about synthetic

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.320
clones.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.920
Can you make it really simple for me and explain to me what you meant by all that?

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.280
Sure.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:53.840
So when they they find these RNA, let's call them coronaviruses for the sake of it in the

01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:03.600
wild, what they actually find is an assortment of subgenomic RNAs and they reassemble these

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.560
subgenomic RNAs into a canonical genomic RNA.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.560
Sorry, you need to stop.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.480
What does subgenomic mean?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.840
And what does genomic RNA mean?

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.360
It's OK when an RNA virus copies itself, we are told that it needs to take its whole genome

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.280
and break it up into smaller pieces through copying.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.280
And then those smaller pieces are translated into the individual proteins that assemble

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.760
into a virus.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.960
We are told that there are a lot more of these subgenomic RNAs than there are of genomic

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.360
RNAs because you need a lot more of those to make all the proteins that you need to

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.080
make in order to package virus.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.920
And the one thing that they don't tell you, but Robert Malone told us in 2021 already

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:51.480
on a podcast, is that the vast majority of coronavirus particles, as they understand

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.280
it, are replication incompetent.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.240
And it's likely because a lot of these subgenomic RNAs get packaged and then you're missing most

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240
of the genome.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.840
And so you have a virus that's got some stuff on the outside and some stuff on the inside.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.000
It's not enough for it to continue this cycle that they've drawn in these cartoons.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Things can be inferred from this.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.080
One is that you could have the passing of symptoms because if these proteins are produced

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.640
and shed by somebody, then the next person that encounters these proteins could have

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.400
symptoms that don't replicate and don't pass on.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:35.560
Number two, the interesting thing is, is that when they're sequencing a virus in culture,

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:42.640
they are sequencing this sort of imperfect collection of largely incompetent particles.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:49.360
And they sequence this and they get a whole library of fragments and that those fragments

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.760
are then lined up with each other and they draw from that fragment a consensus sequence

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.880
that we were told with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:03.040
The trouble is, of course, is that that sequence isn't found in an abundance.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.480
In fact, it's not found at all.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.320
It is a symbol.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.840
And even when they've applied more recently.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.360
It's a computer model.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.840
Yes, it's if you had a shredded book and then you used a computer to try and make a guess

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:25.600
of what that book was about and depending on how good your computer was and how you set

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:31.680
the parameters of that guess, you could take an encyclopedia and shred it into a million

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.680
pieces.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:36.120
Depending on the algorithm you could use, you could find a yoga book in there or you could

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.120
find a book about war in there or a book about carpentry and it's yeah, or a Bible.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:49.520
So it's really, I think this, as we get more data about how much of a signal is there in

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:55.720
the background and we get more data about how little fidelity they actually have in these

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:01.640
size regimes and in these sequencing reactions, then you start to realize that there's a

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.960
there's no way back in the late 80s and early 90s, they could claim all the things

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:10.080
that they claim because they didn't even have the resolution we have now.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.920
And when we have the resolution we have now, they still can't extend these discoveries

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.040
and these claims beyond the models that they already have working.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:23.600
For example, we're still using, as you know, psychopathic effects to have some indication

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.200
that there is a virus in culture.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.600
We haven't expanded beyond this technique.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.360
All these fancy sequencing techniques and microfluidics and all this other stuff.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.080
The best we can do is still psychopathic effects.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.160
I mean, that seems pretty shocking to me, but that's really where we are.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.960
What are psychopathic effects explain that?

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.000
This is actually one of the things that Stefan Lanka is very, very, I think, appropriately

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:55.840
so famous for is that you take a cell culture and one of the ways that they purport to find

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.880
virus is if they put a sample from somebody's lung in that cell culture and then those

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:05.440
cells die, that's that's psychopathic effects, cells dying is an indication of the presence

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440
of a virus.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.920
Now, if they use PCR on that dish and they find the amplicons that they claim indicate

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.840
the viruses there, they've got all the proof they need.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840
Hold on a second.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.440
And that's almost all they ever do.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.440
Hold on.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.680
But the glue that they make this all from, they decide to toxic anyway.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.880
I mean, like, how did you know it's not just all the glue that you've just put in there

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.880
and you're putting it.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.400
Well, this is the argument that this is the argument that Mark Bailey and Stefan Lanka

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.440
and a lot of people have been making arguments.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:40.200
This is the argument from the very, very beginning is that the original isolation didn't even

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.200
have a control.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.280
They didn't use fluid from a healthy person and show you that the cells didn't die.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:54.360
And this is a very valid critique of every coronavirus isolation, really, in history.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.640
And this is not something that I've ever really argued with, which is also one of these.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.480
I've been all on board with these with these posits for quite some years now.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.960
It's hard to argue that you're going down to no virus camp.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:15.520
It's not a no virus camp, though, it's a it's a it's a camp about the fact that the, the

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:22.640
resolution and the fidelity that they portray is a lie and that they've used reverse genetics.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.640
I believe that they can use reverse genetics to recapitulate a lot of these, these experiments.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.320
And that has allowed this field to exist that these are virologists do it.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.960
And they're all doing it thinking that these clones are the same thing as what they find

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960
in the bats.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.200
It's just Ralph Barrick made this for me so that I can, you know, this lab made this for

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.920
me so that I can do my work.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:48.680
But what they don't understand is none of these stocks, none of these supplies, none

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:52.840
of these things would exist if it wasn't for the reverse genetics used to produce them.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.360
You wouldn't be able to get them.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.280
If you had to culture them, you wouldn't be able to get them.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.600
If you had to run to the cave every week, none of these things would exist then.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.080
And that's the heart of this.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.640
So there is real PCR.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.000
There are real sequencing reactions.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.280
There are RNAs in these things, but they have been, they have been misconstrued as

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.720
doing things that they don't do.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.920
And with that, I totally agree with all of these people.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920
Okay.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.200
So one more thing, just when I spoke to Robert Malone, he goes, thousands of people have

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.920
isolated the coronavirus around the world.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:36.040
As far as I know, China produced a sequence and then gave it to the world.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.880
And everybody then used that sequence to create whatever it was.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.000
It was never a true isolation.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.440
No one has gone and isolated a live, real life virus.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440
Am I right?

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.840
Well, the only place that I know of that they claim to have done it is the guy, the

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.840
Suhomish County man in Washington state in America, because that is the only sample that

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:07.000
they wrote in the description that they cultured the virus and that that cultured

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.880
virus is this stock number.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.640
So if you do the trace through all of the documents, it appears as though they cultured

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.120
the virus that he had and that they made a stock from it.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:26.920
And that's what the papers say, however, this would be, no, no, I mean, still, the point

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.800
would be the best case scenario is that they have an assortment of RNAs that they

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.320
found in this person and they made more of it somehow and they're shipping that around.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.680
But my gut feeling tells me that this is just a nonsense story.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.760
And they tell you this because the foundation of virology is based on this lie that you can

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.720
culture a virus, sequence it, put it in a stock and grow some more and send it around.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.760
What they are skipping there, what they are not telling you is that the only way that

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.600
works is if you make an infectious clone of it first, you make a DNA clone so you can

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.000
make lots of it and then go back to that DNA clone whenever you need to make more of it.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.840
And I suspect that all of RNA virology has been done this way for about 20 years.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.840
Sorry, can you just break down what a DNA clone is?

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840
Sure.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:19.400
It's the same way that they made the spike protein, supposedly RNA that they injected

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.280
in everyone.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:28.480
You take the sequence that Nathan Wolf found in his metagenomic experiment.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:35.520
You take the sequence that supposedly the algorithm spit out in Wuhan and you construct

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.160
DNA equivalents of it and you can do this very easily using commercial means.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.760
You can order them off the internet.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.160
Just put the sequence in and order this piece and that piece and that piece and that piece.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:54.320
And Ralph Barrick is the guy who is infamous for inventing this idea.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.520
But in reality, these are standard molecular biology baking techniques where you use restriction

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.560
enzymes to cut ends that match together and you put pieces of DNA together to make a bigger

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.800
piece of DNA.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.720
Applying this idea to virology is maybe his calling card but I assure you that all of

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.040
his postdocs knew how to do it and lots of other people that work in plants and work

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:25.840
in vertebrates are also using these techniques to create DNA constructs that they use in their

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.160
own experiments.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.560
And so it's not a particularly tricky or magical thing that they wanted to sound like

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.760
with regard to what Barrick's doing.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:43.640
But a DNA clone of these things, as I said, you can't get much of this RNA from the wild

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.680
because it doesn't grow in a dish, it doesn't replicate with high fidelity and also replicates

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:55.400
itself with this broken structure of many more subgenomic RNAs than full genomic RNAs.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.440
So ignoring the error rate because the error rate doesn't really, the error rate could

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.920
be relatively low and it still doesn't really matter for this argument.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:12.020
The DNA construct is what allows them to go from a very long piece over and over and over

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.380
again.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:20.020
So that in the end, you can have thousands of near perfect copies of the same full genomic

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:26.620
RNA that in no other methodology and no other source could this be found?

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:34.020
Because even the whole sequence, the consensus sequence, if it's made, it is a consensus

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.020
sequence.

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:38.260
It doesn't by definition necessarily exist in nature.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.580
And if you make a clone of it, literally thousands and thousands of copies of it that

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.860
you could never produce in any other way.

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:51.340
And that is a DNA clone who infectious RNA clone that was invented by actually David

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.420
Baltimore.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:56.900
And that's the guy who won the Nobel Prize for reverse transcriptase.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:04.220
And the guy who started the Whitehead Institute at MIT and is like the godfather of all this

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:07.580
virology defined it all really, it's pretty impressive.

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:12.820
If you think about how much how much do you think of this as part of the transhumanism

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:20.620
where they're trying to get, you know, to edit the human genome and and change just in

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.860
some way and, you know, by what if I just did a video a couple of days ago where I watched

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:34.500
a a talk given by the founder of the Broad Institute, Eric Lander as he was talking about

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.860
the progress that had been made and not made with the human genome project and how

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.020
much farther they had to go.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.820
And the basic message was in 2019 that the only way we're going to get through this is

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.420
if we collect every genome on Earth.

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:51.900
And so I'm pretty sure that one of the main priorities here is just making sure that as

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:56.740
our children grow up, they don't think of their biology as theirs, but they think of

01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:00.580
it as something they owe to society to turn over.

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.900
And then this data will be farmed, this data will be used.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:08.380
They'll even give you a universal, bakey basic income in exchange for it.

01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:12.220
I don't know, but this definitely on the docket for sure.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.220
All right.

01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.220
Dude, it's late here.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.060
I'm getting tired and my brain's fried.

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.060
I'm happy.

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.620
You stayed up late with me, man.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.620
That's very nice of you.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.620
I appreciate it.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.620
No, dude.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.620
I love talking to you.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.620
You know that.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.620
I love talking to you.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.820
A time works for you on my show.

01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820
What do I have to do that?

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.820
I have to get up early.

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.820
Yeah.

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.420
You're five hours behind me.

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.420
Yeah.

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.420
Five hours.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.420
That's number.

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.420
Yeah.

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:38.540
So like mid day one o'clock, that would be good.

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:41.060
I mean, I have to pick up the kids to 45.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.860
So if you do mid day, that means the five o'clock start for you.

01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.340
And I'd be most grateful.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.340
That's perfect.

01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.340
That'll work.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.340
Cool.

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.340
All right.

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.340
We're going to set it up.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.340
I'll send you some dates and times.

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:53.340
Can I ask you a favor?

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:57.820
Can you send me all information and where people can find you?

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:03.660
Just do a shout out now where people can find you, your Twitter handle, your Twitch,

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:04.660
whatever it is.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.660
You should, you know what?

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.900
You should also do all these like videos that you do on Twitch or whatever.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.420
You should also upload on sub stack.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.420
I don't know if you're aware of that, but sub stack allows you to upload like a podcast.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.420
It's really, really good.

01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.420
I think you should do that.

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:18.420
I am doing that now.

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:19.420
I am doing that now.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:20.420
Yep.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.420
I am doing that now.

01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.420
I just started last week.

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:23.420
So that's very good.

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.420
I'm on sub stack is GIGO and biological.

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.420
I'm Twitch on GIGO and biological.

01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:30.520
When I'm at GIGO, biological.com, all one word, unfortunately, it's a dumb thing to

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520
get go home.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.520
So that's what it's called.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.520
GIGO.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.520
Home.

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.520
Okay.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.520
Home, biological.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.860
And it's big resistance like you are.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:43.700
Big resistance comes in small packages and tall, skinny packages and we're just going to

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:44.700
keep fighting.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.700
All right.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700
Yeah.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700
All right, man.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700
We're definitely going to keep fighting.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.700
I mean, I'm not stopped.

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:50.700
I'm not going to stop.

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:55.300
I'm just, I'm very happy in the sense that, you know what?

01:31:55.300 --> 01:32:00.700
I just, I look at my colleagues, mate, and they're still doing the same same.

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.860
They're just like zombies going through the motions, doing their job.

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.340
They don't look happy.

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:11.700
And I think a lot of people know something's wrong.

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:16.020
Know something doesn't make sense in the world.

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:21.860
And they kid themselves and they fill themselves and they immerse themselves in the work.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:29.900
And they're chasing a bigger car that they've gotten credit or a bigger house, you know,

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.700
whatever it might be.

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.340
And they're not happy because ultimately they're living a life.

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.980
And while things aren't easy for you and me and we have to watch our bills and, you

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:45.180
know, every penny counts, at least we're happy, man, at least we're doing something

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.860
for humanity.

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.620
And I think that's the most important thing.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:53.220
And we will have our rewards in this life or the next.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.220
That's for sure.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:57.580
I don't know about what you think, but I definitely think there's a God in the Creator.

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.140
I'm going back to what you said before.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:03.100
I mean, our rewards are every day.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:08.500
This for whatever reason has brought me closer to my family in a way that I would have never

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:15.100
been if I was still obsessed with my academic pursuits as a biologist.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:19.020
And I'm reorienting myself toward the local community.

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.020
I don't know.

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.900
It's made my wife and I marriage stronger than ever.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:26.500
And so there's a lot of things to count as blessings.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.500
That's for sure.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.500
100%.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.500
This is a thing.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.980
Like, that's another thing.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.180
Just be grateful, man.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.460
Like be grateful that you're awake.

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.980
Be grateful that you're not controlled opposition.

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.380
Be grateful that you're not captured or compromised in any way.

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:44.140
Be grateful that you can go to sleep at night and sleep like a baby knowing that you know

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.140
what?

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.140
You've done good in this world.

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.980
I mean, that is not great.

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.980
You tell me what is.

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:49.980
You know, I mean, that is just fantastic.

01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.580
And you've got three beautiful kids, same with me.

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.780
Do you know what?

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.100
I'm not going in holiday this year.

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.100
I don't care.

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.940
Do you know what?

01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:04.180
What should I just work like a dog, stress that, and then go away somewhere for a week.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.500
Because that's when I'm going to be happy.

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.860
Or actually, you know what?

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:12.620
Be happy every day in my little garden and my muddy field where I'm running, falling

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.460
down.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.860
I think these are the priorities, you know?

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.940
I think I'm learning.
