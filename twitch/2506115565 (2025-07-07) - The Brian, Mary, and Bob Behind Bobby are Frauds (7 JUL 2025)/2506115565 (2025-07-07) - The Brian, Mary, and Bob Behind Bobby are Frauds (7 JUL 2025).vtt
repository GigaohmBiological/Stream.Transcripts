WEBVTT

00:33.391 --> 00:34.992
Steak knives indeed.

00:35.012 --> 00:48.882
He lied to me.

00:49.603 --> 00:53.726
I'm pretty convinced that I got used early on.

00:54.998 --> 01:19.178
uh in promoting the false narratives around this and it didn't make it pissed me off pretty good uh and um things like when i raised with michael that it looked like this i was doing sequence analysis like starting january 10th of 2020 yeah um and and i raised with michael this looked like it was an engineered pathogen and his comment was

01:19.938 --> 01:21.360
You know straight straight out.

01:21.841 --> 01:23.043
These guys are really good at lying.

01:23.203 --> 01:32.095
You got to understand if you're dealing with anybody in the intelligence community that are operative They are trained liars and in trained psychological manipulators.

01:32.115 --> 01:35.640
That's what they do the field agents Do you think you can pick one out now?

01:35.760 --> 01:39.104
I mean, someone said to me, Del, you've got to be surrounded by agents at this point.

01:39.124 --> 01:42.447
People around you, people you're talking to.

01:42.467 --> 01:53.118
It's highly probable that your cell phone and your data infrastructure are compromised with things like Pegasus 2, which you can't track.

01:55.081 --> 02:09.429
I've had people that we both know that when Jill and I turned in our old cell phones and got new ones, suddenly they came out of the woodwork and really wanted to interact with me and wanted me to answer their emails.

02:09.449 --> 02:13.891
Well that's, when you get a ping and then you respond, that's how Pegasus 2 gets loaded in.

02:15.406 --> 02:16.727
and they've gradually gone away.

02:16.807 --> 02:18.528
These people are absolutely out there.

02:19.669 --> 02:30.836
And anybody that's in our space, you kind of have to assume that you are interacting with them at one point or another, usually surreptitiously.

02:30.896 --> 02:37.501
So these are the chaos agents, and they're the ones that they so, so want to work with you.

02:38.341 --> 02:42.284
and collaborate with you, and you're like... Tell you how brilliant you are.

02:42.304 --> 02:43.245
Yeah, precisely.

02:43.325 --> 02:44.626
Yeah, absolutely.

02:45.407 --> 02:50.731
You know, it's not just the honey trap with the short skirt.

02:51.692 --> 02:55.755
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody, and flattery is one of them.

03:01.786 --> 03:20.303
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

03:21.424 --> 03:24.607
And then each of us, this incredible VMN

03:26.758 --> 03:31.481
Each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

03:31.801 --> 03:37.884
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

03:37.924 --> 03:43.547
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

03:44.188 --> 03:52.492
He was one of the co-founders of RASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

03:54.014 --> 04:06.911
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

04:08.212 --> 04:11.657
And he's also been instrumental in

04:13.319 --> 04:26.546
covering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call data

04:36.400 --> 04:36.920
Actually, J.J.

04:36.940 --> 04:43.565
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

04:44.346 --> 04:44.846
Actually, J.J.

04:44.886 --> 04:51.511
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.174
But you can tell if someone's lying.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.576
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:59.395 --> 05:00.096
And I have lied.

05:00.116 --> 05:01.176
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:01.196 --> 05:02.117
I don't want to lie.

05:02.137 --> 05:03.958
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

05:03.978 --> 05:05.079
I try not to be a liar.

05:05.099 --> 05:05.980
I don't want to be a liar.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.322
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.731
I think truth is good for kids.

05:21.151 --> 05:24.894
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

05:25.444 --> 05:27.084
We want everybody to feel good.

05:27.204 --> 05:29.165
That's not the way life is.

05:57.813 --> 05:59.015
I don't care how you get there.

05:59.035 --> 06:01.700
I don't care what you do to get there.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.325
The goal is to win.

06:18.433 --> 06:19.834
Good morning, everybody.

06:19.934 --> 06:20.555
Good morning.

06:20.635 --> 06:21.635
Welcome to the show.

06:21.655 --> 06:28.700
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.041
I'm sorry, it is Monday.

06:30.722 --> 06:33.724
For some people, this is a pretty rough day.

06:34.064 --> 06:40.469
It's that morning you got to get up and do it all over again, and for five days in a row, and I sympathize with you completely.

06:41.469 --> 06:46.192
I am fortunate enough to be able to be late for work and nobody complains directly.

06:47.132 --> 06:49.033
I apologize for being here so late.

06:50.074 --> 06:54.657
Ladies and gentlemen, please remember the main message is to get off of social media.

06:55.177 --> 07:03.141
Stop using the algorithm to cure your boredom and instead seek out information or get out and read a book.

07:04.362 --> 07:06.003
Go for a walk, go fly a kite.

07:07.003 --> 07:12.384
Buy an RC car even, I don't care, but don't use social media to cure your boredom.

07:12.905 --> 07:27.528
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a mythology that's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, that public health is never questioned as a reason.

07:28.228 --> 07:31.270
You can say the same thing about pandemics and gain of function.

07:32.031 --> 07:33.532
These are all myths.

07:33.612 --> 07:35.593
They are myths that hide a truth.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.996
And it's very difficult for people caught in this to see it.

07:40.997 --> 07:43.738
And that's why I think repeating things, you know, like...

07:44.719 --> 08:01.907
you don't understand the trap you're in if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media I'm sorry but this is the message and it doesn't need to be changed a whole lot I'm gonna try and make it look different and sound different but there's one of those errors again Wow how am I managing to do that

08:04.068 --> 08:10.894
Look, the protein folding story, you know, the DNA is an antenna story.

08:11.434 --> 08:15.037
I mean, there's a lot of things out there that are out there as noise.

08:15.378 --> 08:24.045
And if you want to follow somebody who's trying to prove himself wrong, besides myself, I would suggest going to HousatonicITS.com and doing that.

08:25.086 --> 08:30.010
It is really remarkable how much I've learned as a result of being a scientist.

08:30.090 --> 08:31.832
It's very similar to being an analyst.

08:31.872 --> 08:32.832
I just don't think that

08:34.174 --> 08:50.730
As Mark characterizes an analyst, I don't think that there are very many people, yes also this sub-stack about Scotland, there aren't very many people who understand what it means to try and prove yourself wrong in the context of science, what it means to design an experiment that you know...

08:52.492 --> 08:54.654
that you know will never really fail.

08:54.734 --> 09:00.379
I mean, because you design an experiment because you know that when it fails, it still tells you something.

09:00.399 --> 09:03.001
You're still learning something, because you want to know an answer.

09:03.841 --> 09:08.365
And if you want to know an answer, then actually, no is as good as yes.

09:09.426 --> 09:09.686
Right?

09:09.786 --> 09:10.947
If you just want to know.

09:12.508 --> 09:17.833
And that's the real trick here, is that most of these people aren't playing that game, honestly.

09:17.913 --> 09:21.616
They are pretending as if they want to know, but they've also

09:22.759 --> 09:27.684
offered an unreasonable amount of certainty, often on an unreasonably early time.

09:28.404 --> 09:41.696
I mean, this is a message for Americans because I do think America has one of the last open doors in order to get out of this very big global trap that is social media.

09:43.238 --> 09:46.120
I don't think you can underestimate how this

09:47.202 --> 09:57.472
This militarized weapon of social control is being used to subvert nations around the world, or at least threaten to subvert nations around the world.

09:58.033 --> 10:00.075
And so we need to stay focused more than ever.

10:01.616 --> 10:05.880
Because social media is not something you can just use willy-nilly and get away with it.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.282
You will be bamboozled.

10:08.336 --> 10:11.338
You've got to be there, and you've got to stay focused on the biology.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.760
You've got to not take the bait that's there.

10:13.780 --> 10:23.188
You know, like, 9 out of 10 things you see on social media are going to be something that's either false or tilted in a way so as to be dishonest.

10:24.069 --> 10:28.472
And finally, you've got to make a habit of interacting with your real, live neighbors.

10:29.773 --> 10:32.516
And this is going to be very important should the internet go out.

10:33.196 --> 10:34.918
And I'm not making any jokes about that.

10:36.259 --> 10:40.462
The internet could go out for a wide variety of reasons, even if it's only for a couple of weeks.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.085
It could just be that the power goes out.

10:46.146 --> 10:51.150
And having your neighbors, your friends, and not strangers at that time will be crucial.

10:51.970 --> 11:03.639
Also crucial for your peace of mind going forward as the prices continue to rise and all this other crap that you see if you indulge in the social media swamp.

11:08.639 --> 11:12.223
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

11:12.243 --> 11:15.227
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

11:15.907 --> 11:20.913
You can find the stain of my academic work on the National Library of Medicine website PubMed.

11:22.174 --> 11:29.783
I used to be a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine until I was told to go home and turn in my badge and keys until it would be safe again for me to come back.

11:30.959 --> 11:41.346
And then they terminated my, well they didn't terminate my contract, they just kind of paid it out and then didn't hire me back, didn't help me get another job, didn't let me finish any of my work, etc, etc.

11:42.827 --> 11:53.795
I've also presented three times to the group named Panda, but they didn't put those on Rumble because instead what they did was they diluted and obfuscated whatever limited information they were told was okay for the script.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.401
And then they pretended like they learned it from themselves.

11:58.201 --> 12:06.870
And one of the best examples of that is the Woodhouse 76 blog written by the trader Jessica Hockett in Chicago, Illinois.

12:06.890 --> 12:09.293
She may have a last name named Faber, I don't know.

12:10.180 --> 12:13.662
I saw some mouse on the internet say that her last name might be Faber.

12:14.543 --> 12:19.105
Ladies and gentlemen, I've also participated in the writing of the Wuhan cover-up book.

12:19.745 --> 12:27.230
That was a nearly year-long employment under the auspices of working as a scientific consultant for CHD.

12:28.170 --> 12:45.704
And then I transitioned into a staff scientist position under the direction of Brian Hooker and Mary Holland, who the same people then fired me at the beginning of 2024 for talking about Robert Malone and Meryl Nass on my stream.

12:46.125 --> 12:52.650
I've also been asked not to talk about Robert Malone by one Jay Anta Bhattacharya, who's now the head of NIH.

12:52.710 --> 12:55.893
He told me that he was likely to be the head of NIH before

12:56.593 --> 13:03.201
anyone else knew about it, and told me that, you know, it would be great if I would stop talking about Robert Malone.

13:03.241 --> 13:16.256
He didn't just say it once, he said it three times in one weekend, and that was, I think, the third weekend that I had met him during the course of the pandemic, serendipitously at the gatherings of the Broken Science Initiative.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.812
This timeline is malevolent.

13:21.972 --> 13:29.760
All I can do to keep my sanity is constantly remind myself and recheck my notes about exactly what's happened so that I don't feel crazy.

13:30.340 --> 13:41.091
And sometimes I need to go all the way back to my time on JC on a Bike, which is my original YouTube channel where I was still sucking up to the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh trying to get a job as a

13:41.733 --> 13:42.754
a permanent lecturer.

13:43.595 --> 13:56.230
JC in the Woods is my response to being struck a couple times during the beginning of the pandemic, and now I'm occasionally using that to livestream, but they both have strikes on the channels now, so I guess today I'm on JC on a bike.

13:56.891 --> 13:57.371
I think so.

13:58.452 --> 14:02.277
And how it works is that I've got some supporters that help me out a lot.

14:03.411 --> 14:05.732
And I've got some supporters that help me out a little bit.

14:06.072 --> 14:15.917
And together that adds up to enough for me and my family of five to... I wouldn't use the word prosper, but I would use the word pay all the bills.

14:16.557 --> 14:21.880
Although right now, we're pretty behind on both credit cards that matter.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.042
And that's because when we can't make it, we use credit cards to do it.

14:28.194 --> 14:34.936
And so I'm very shamelessly gonna tell you that this, we are running on fumes.

14:35.737 --> 14:44.119
And so if you wanna help this out, go to gigalombiological.com and find a way to support because all these people on Substack, they don't need your subscription of $5 a week.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.821
I need your subscription of $5 a week.

14:47.861 --> 14:51.362
If you go down and scroll down, you can use PayPal to do $1 a week.

14:52.622 --> 14:53.803
And really, if we just had,

14:55.003 --> 14:57.745
I mean, we just had enough to keep this going.

14:57.785 --> 14:59.866
This would be an eternal show.

15:01.507 --> 15:03.508
Because I do enjoy producing it.

15:04.248 --> 15:06.550
I do enjoy the reading that I get to do.

15:06.650 --> 15:09.892
I do enjoy all the learning that I'm doing over the course of the six years.

15:10.802 --> 15:15.845
I just don't enjoy the struggle of shaking a can on the internet.

15:16.745 --> 15:27.231
It would be great if I didn't have to do five shows a week to barely even get where we need to go, but I don't really know how to do that any other way because the internet is flooded with stuff.

15:29.122 --> 15:33.364
And it's it's flooded with stuff that doesn't ever stop coming right?

15:33.444 --> 15:35.585
It's it's never gonna stop coming.

15:35.665 --> 15:42.268
None of these sub stacks are ever gonna stop Good morning, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

15:42.448 --> 15:42.768
Hello.

15:42.888 --> 15:56.394
Welcome to the show You might notice that I have a t-shirt on that is not my own, but it's a t-shirt from my basketball gym shoe 360 who in no way shape or form sponsors this but

15:57.915 --> 16:02.438
They do give me my own free membership and I occasionally make movies for the owner.

16:03.018 --> 16:09.203
But I'm still paying for my boys, so it's a relationship that a lot of people would call probably not a very good one.

16:09.263 --> 16:16.768
But the reason why I do it is because I'm going to teach my biology there on the court and on the shooting machines.

16:17.897 --> 16:21.080
And because I want that place to remain my thing.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.982
I don't want to start working there.

16:23.002 --> 16:32.290
I don't want to be some guy that produces media for that place because then it won't feel like the temple of whatever that it is.

16:32.350 --> 16:36.333
I mean, it is wonderful to walk in there and hear the noise and the echo.

16:37.895 --> 16:40.457
and then be able to do what I can do there.

16:40.778 --> 16:41.719
It's a wonderful place.

16:41.759 --> 16:46.383
I don't think anybody should go there or join it or anything like that.

16:46.984 --> 16:56.533
I think it's just fine the way it is in much the same way that I think the upper part of the main part of Michigan is a place where you don't need to go visit.

16:57.114 --> 17:00.678
Just like Door County in Wisconsin is a place where you never need to go visit.

17:01.498 --> 17:10.641
These places are Beth best left alone and certainly shoot 360 in Pittsburgh is one of those places where if you like basketball You can probably find a better place closer to you.

17:10.661 --> 17:17.844
So don't bother looking for it Anyway, the the goal of the show today is pretty deep.

17:18.184 --> 17:21.025
I'm sorry Man, shoot.

17:21.085 --> 17:22.146
I didn't set that up.

17:22.486 --> 17:23.586
My goodness sakes.

17:24.106 --> 17:25.907
This is some serious amateur hour.

17:25.987 --> 17:28.308
I really thought I did the checklist I'm not a pilot

17:28.968 --> 17:30.090
I don't have a checklist.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.553
I should have a checklist, but I don't have a checklist.

17:33.274 --> 17:35.717
And then I want you to be size A, I believe.

17:35.797 --> 17:36.237
Is that right?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.981
Oh, I didn't do that either.

17:39.081 --> 17:41.244
See, no checklist today.

17:41.304 --> 17:42.085
Sorry about that.

17:42.185 --> 17:44.948
I'll just do my hand here and it'll be fine.

17:45.028 --> 17:45.589
Let's see.

17:45.889 --> 17:47.231
Yes, right there.

17:49.585 --> 17:53.426
So I do think, oh yeah, so I was explaining shoot 360.

17:53.966 --> 17:58.687
The shirt says, I think it's meant to say shot 10K.

17:59.888 --> 18:02.948
So yesterday I made my 10,000th jump shot.

18:02.968 --> 18:03.348
It took me 19,700.

18:03.388 --> 18:08.990
I think it was, it's really very close to 50% shooting over the course of 20,000 shots.

18:16.617 --> 18:23.440
19,707.

18:18.477 --> 18:23.440
It took me to get 10,013 jumpers.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.061
So that's pretty cool.

18:26.601 --> 18:36.786
But surprisingly, after shooting 20,000 jump shots, and I'm not kidding, and making 10,000, I don't feel any better.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.168
And in fact, I feel a little better at it.

18:41.641 --> 18:46.366
It's remarkable how, actually, I had much more progress to make with my ball handling.

18:46.706 --> 18:57.037
And over the last 141 days, I have made some pretty remarkable progress in my humble opinion in my ball handling.

18:58.098 --> 19:02.961
It doesn't completely translate to full court behavior yet because that's a little trickier.

19:03.001 --> 19:04.242
You're moving a little faster.

19:04.282 --> 19:07.004
And so I'm now working drills in like that.

19:07.064 --> 19:14.469
But my stationary, you know, moving left, moving right, couple first couple steps stuff has gotten really, really good.

19:14.509 --> 19:16.370
And more importantly, my eyes have come up.

19:16.871 --> 19:27.718
I'm a kid who grew up in northern Wisconsin, was trained as a center back when a center still meant this guy who could only do a power, a power dribble, you know, as he did a drop step and then

19:28.318 --> 19:52.977
You know, you can do some pivots and stuff like that, but very old school post player I was and when I went to college And started playing at night, you know after classes is when I started to turn my to face the basket at least as kind of like what I thought was a swing forward and when I When I walked on for that little bit of time during my sophomore year I

19:55.222 --> 19:58.064
That was the time of David Booth.

19:58.304 --> 20:10.534
And so David Booth was this swing forward kind of dude, you know, that would run the baseline and be on the baseline shot for a jumper or maybe a, you know, a fake and a dribble one to the side, something like that.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.578
I mean, I'm not comparing myself to any of these people.

20:15.618 --> 20:24.024
I'm just saying that at the time that I played basketball, there were these more defined positions, whereas now it's pretty much, you know, everybody just basically moves around

20:25.171 --> 20:25.891
It's remarkable.

20:25.911 --> 20:27.372
There's a point guard and that's about it.

20:28.772 --> 20:30.333
Anyway, 10,000 shots.

20:30.453 --> 20:31.813
Congratulations to me.

20:32.293 --> 20:36.574
That means that I'm almost ready to start teaching, which is pretty good.

20:36.655 --> 20:40.196
My back's about 99% from the last couple weeks.

20:41.176 --> 20:52.899
And so, I don't know why I'm wasting this much time telling you other than I'm very excited to be mostly healthy again and very excited to be at this point where I am planning on pivoting from these kinds of shows.

20:52.939 --> 20:54.480
I'm not that I'm never going to do it again.

20:56.817 --> 21:15.373
But if you see how easy it is to just go and grab some stuff and show you how malevolent these people are and how easy it is to see that this fake anti-vax, fake health freedom movement that's present on Substack and X and nowhere else

21:16.377 --> 21:30.070
you know, in the backwoods of the internet, but nowhere in mainstream media, nowhere in the other half of the internet, which is unfortunately very invisible to most of us because we just choose not to look.

21:32.031 --> 21:35.795
And we are in a very dangerous place in America because of these shitheads.

21:36.055 --> 21:38.397
And this is for the grandchildren of earth.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.901
And if America doesn't pull their head out, nobody will.

21:42.625 --> 21:43.826
That's the reality of it.

21:43.866 --> 21:49.770
If America pulls their head out, maybe it's possible that some other people will pull their head out, but otherwise it ain't happening.

21:50.990 --> 21:52.171
Did I somehow get this off?

21:52.211 --> 21:52.691
Yeah, I did.

21:56.314 --> 22:10.343
And so I got rid of the word endemicity in the back there because I want you to make sure that you understand that we are trying to seek truth together about what they told us happened here, which is, you know, a lab leak in 2019 is now gone endemic.

22:14.226 --> 22:17.628
That's why that endemicity thing is removed.

22:17.668 --> 22:20.130
We're not buying into that story.

22:20.190 --> 22:22.492
So what we wanna know is what really happened here.

22:22.512 --> 22:25.994
And of course, it's not that there was a novel virus that got out of a lab.

22:29.556 --> 22:39.143
And remember that we are not in a position to be forced or coerced into explaining the details of what happened, rather,

22:40.194 --> 22:44.559
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and they have none.

22:46.261 --> 22:56.753
And so this claim of something happening for the last six years that has resulted in a permanent change in the way that we live, in the way that we think about our world is false.

23:01.089 --> 23:11.934
And that's why there's this fake anti-vax health freedom movement that's getting rid of seed oils and petroleum-based dyes and also saving the animals from animal testing.

23:13.775 --> 23:20.538
We must seek the truth of this, the truth about this biology, the truth behind this mythology.

23:21.419 --> 23:23.119
And so it's not without

23:26.775 --> 23:38.722
great humility that I suggest that the virus is the illusion, because it's very, very easy to say that, like Andy Kaufman says it, or Tom Cowan says it, or any of these people say it.

23:38.862 --> 23:43.005
It's very enticing to say, well, then they were always right, but they weren't.

23:44.602 --> 23:56.125
because what those people have masterfully covered because of the unique script that they are all on, none of them have talked about the fact that recombinant DNA

23:57.012 --> 24:05.278
or RNA can be produced in high quantities only one way that we know of cheaply, and that is using bacterial cultures.

24:05.318 --> 24:10.761
And that is indeed how it is done when the goal is to produce a protein biologic.

24:10.881 --> 24:26.572
One of the most popular of the biologics that pharmaceutical companies make, that class of drug, a protein-based biologic, is produced using recombinant DNA produced in huge vats of bacteria.

24:28.092 --> 24:45.534
And none of these people, absolutely none of these people that have been present since the beginning of the narrative on the pseudo-conservative, it's a fake conservative side of America, the skeptical side of America, all these people have been put in place to make sure that they never, ever say that.

24:47.625 --> 24:54.407
And they could have said that in 2020, when this all started, because that was the standard in the industry.

24:54.947 --> 25:07.150
That's the reason why the people that are in front of us right now have connections to industry, government labs, transfection, genetics, because they are all in on this narrative.

25:07.190 --> 25:09.351
And they all understand the imperative

25:10.393 --> 25:21.057
to make sure that nobody understands that the basis for the manufacture of all biologics was the same basis for the manufacture of all these mRNA shots.

25:21.117 --> 25:27.259
And so even if they were all live, there was no way they were going to be uniform.

25:27.299 --> 25:29.200
There was no way they were going to be pure.

25:29.240 --> 25:33.802
There was no way they were going to be the kind of thing that was claimed in the cartoons.

25:33.862 --> 25:34.482
And instead,

25:35.282 --> 25:46.189
These people were set out here with a malevolent script where they argued about the spike protein of the virus and whether it was a lab leak or whether it was natural and whether they were covering it up or not.

25:47.650 --> 26:01.379
And that was a master stroke because it got them to be able to talk about a bunch of biology that was essentially intended to cover up the crime of transfection that would come in like 14 months later.

26:03.325 --> 26:05.726
And the longer they could make that go, the better.

26:05.806 --> 26:13.568
The longer the debate about lab leak and the tracking and the lockdown and, you know, old people dying, the longer that could go, the better.

26:13.608 --> 26:25.131
I don't know if they intended it to go just as long as it did until the end of 2022, or if they would have liked one more year, but it's clear from the data that it abruptly stopped in the end of 2022.

26:27.458 --> 26:41.424
And so it's remarkable at this stage that none of these people that have been anti-vaxxers for decades or have had an injured child until, you know, for 20 years have never been able to hone their message.

26:41.484 --> 26:51.309
They were stuck and have been stuck for a very long time on some component of the autism, sorry, some component of the vaccine schedule causes autism.

26:52.193 --> 27:00.178
They've never been able to get to the stage where they could start to talk about how, wait, maybe intramuscular injection in general is just not medicine.

27:01.939 --> 27:06.622
Maybe any combination of substances injected intramuscularly doesn't really make sense.

27:06.742 --> 27:15.127
Have we ever really thought about it and then done the research necessary to figure out whether we have actually done the thinking about it?

27:16.089 --> 27:23.736
The only person that I can find on earth that has been inspired to do that since I started saying this is Mark Kulak.

27:25.217 --> 27:31.924
And what Mark Kulak is finding is that there's not this, you know, system-wide transition to the acceptance of injection.

27:32.364 --> 27:39.931
It looks like maybe the doctors that were also treating animals and injecting animals just decided, well, maybe we can inject people.

27:43.539 --> 27:55.123
And if intramuscular injection came on the market, became common practice in the late 1800s, maybe we need to rethink it.

27:55.323 --> 28:05.927
If transfection was what it was called on Robert Malone's resume in the 90s, maybe somebody's lying to us.

28:06.347 --> 28:12.649
If viruses are not alive because they don't have any of the characteristics of something living,

28:14.039 --> 28:19.846
then maybe we shouldn't talk about them the way we talk about them, but they're just not, it's not, we're not there.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.971
And we haven't gotten there because these people are all on a script.

28:24.011 --> 28:26.054
This lady, for example, is on a script.

28:27.636 --> 28:28.577
This is a dead woman.

28:31.263 --> 28:37.668
And this, you can see in her face, she's just not, doesn't want to be called a hero and not by Brandy Vaughn.

28:38.489 --> 28:44.173
She knows the whole reason why she's on earth is to stand in front of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

28:45.354 --> 28:45.975
She knows it.

28:48.171 --> 28:52.913
I gotta warn you, this is gonna be a very long show today because I'm not sure I'm gonna get on tomorrow.

28:52.993 --> 28:56.134
I'm gonna try to get on tomorrow, but I might not get on tomorrow because we're busy.

28:57.435 --> 29:01.036
And so this show is just gonna be a real wallop.

29:02.376 --> 29:07.658
And I've shown you how this is scripted bullshit because this woman could say it in less than a minute and a half.

29:07.778 --> 29:09.619
I don't think there are any good vaccines.

29:09.659 --> 29:10.860
I don't think you can do that.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.001
And she got on Joe Rogan for three hours and couldn't say it.

29:15.034 --> 29:15.855
She's a traitor.

29:16.415 --> 29:18.056
She's a scripted traitor.

29:18.476 --> 29:29.002
And so when I say that these people were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure that the damage from transfection could be blamed on the novel virus, I think that's the best anyone's ever said it.

29:31.143 --> 29:44.011
And the remarkable thing is, is that there are so many people in this picture who have tried to take what limited biology they're allowed to from my show, from my language, and incorporate it into their shtick.

29:44.875 --> 30:10.232
Pretend that they came up with it on their own and it's it's kind of flattering and it's also kind of annoying because at the same time They usually purposefully obfuscate any way of finding me by referring to me as JJ Or never putting a website there or never never in any way providing a link and so what these people have done over the last six years was just mess with me and my family and

30:11.087 --> 30:26.871
Now, I don't know how many other people have been messed with by as many people as I have, but I have the receipts to show that so many of these people have been actively involved, probably actively scripted in their interaction with me and my wife.

30:27.931 --> 30:34.553
This is a very, very serious thing that I'm accusing these people of, some of whom are actually in government right now.

30:37.374 --> 30:39.094
So I take this very seriously.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.078
I'm not messing around and that's why I repeat it.

30:48.964 --> 30:56.571
Now I would especially today like to talk about these because it's a great example of how Substack has been

30:57.867 --> 30:59.268
weaponized against us.

30:59.448 --> 31:08.632
Now, remember, Substack has all kinds of AI features and AI features allow it to do all kinds of things, especially for people with admin privileges.

31:08.712 --> 31:23.939
So I just presume that anybody that's writing a Substack for this group here is actively manipulated, even maybe just they're allowed to post whatever they want to whenever they want to, when they want to use their Substack.

31:24.909 --> 31:30.336
But Paul Alexander is another example of a guy who, I don't know if he's in this picture, actually.

31:31.037 --> 31:42.411
Paul Alexander is another guy who has posted about me a lot on his sub stack, but his sub stack is so obnoxious and so ridiculous that that actually hurt me a lot of times, I think, because I get associated with him.

31:44.284 --> 31:56.874
And so that's the same thing that this, you know, small little gnome of a man here also did from his desks in Tokyo or the UK or wherever the hell he lives.

31:56.934 --> 31:58.275
Maybe he lives in India, I don't know.

31:59.436 --> 32:02.039
And that's what this little gnome did, Charles Rixey.

32:02.079 --> 32:03.600
These two guys came to my house.

32:06.322 --> 32:08.164
Paul Alexander came to my house.

32:09.645 --> 32:10.966
CHD employed me.

32:12.429 --> 32:13.670
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:13.730 --> 32:14.491
employed me.

32:17.794 --> 32:19.695
I mean, this is no joke here.

32:22.498 --> 32:23.899
I just want the truth out.

32:24.079 --> 32:29.363
I want people to understand that they could have told you everything that I'm telling you in 2020.

32:29.443 --> 32:40.813
That it was always transfection, that there are a million reasons not to do it, that PCR was never going to be specific, especially because they don't make any attempt to differentiate it from a background.

32:42.199 --> 32:49.146
And you don't think that these people could have told you that in 2020, or that these people are not scripted by them?

32:49.707 --> 32:51.309
It's just absurd at this point.

32:55.305 --> 33:11.618
The same joke that Jessica Hockett played with Pierre Corey when we were still in communication with her, where she got a substack response from Corey a couple times with a few hundred videos, made video responses to all of her questions.

33:12.138 --> 33:24.308
But as soon as we wanted them to talk about supplementary oxygen and how that might be dangerous, suddenly, I don't know, Jessica Hockett decided to burn all bridges and disappear and pretend like we never, you know, like we never talked.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.411
And she's still working right now.

33:27.491 --> 33:48.831
Here it is in April, 2025 with Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal, as I accused her of, but now also having the same kind of discussion, response, and callback on Substack with Sasha Latupova, the mother of Soph, this teenage girl who was making all kinds of ridiculous videos before the pandemic.

33:50.250 --> 34:01.000
promoted by Alex Jones three times in 2019, even made a video during the pandemic about shooting Trump and Biden with her mom being the cameraman most likely.

34:02.181 --> 34:06.224
This lady was promoted multiple times by CHD, by Meryl Nass.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.727
Nass and Polly had her on a webcast once.

34:10.308 --> 34:14.672
She was also on American Thought Leaders with the Epoch Times.

34:17.389 --> 34:30.152
And now we're supposed to believe there's some spontaneous discussion about whether there was a poisoning event in New York City because, you know, we're all so smart that we're just considering the best theories with the best theorizers.

34:31.252 --> 34:37.193
But don't forget that Sasha Latapova was on stage with Robert Malone in the beginning of 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden with Meryl Nass.

34:42.515 --> 34:48.219
and Aseem Malhotra, Mike Palmer of the Doctors for COVID Ethics group.

34:49.819 --> 34:51.801
I mean, this is absurd.

34:51.941 --> 34:58.965
There's no possible way that these people are all random assemblies of international patriots fighting for our freedom.

34:59.025 --> 35:04.949
This is a carefully scripted group of shitheads that's getting their script from Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

35:05.862 --> 35:11.865
Even Nick Hudson, who's closely connected to those two over there because he's the other coordinator of Panda.

35:11.885 --> 35:17.668
Don't forget that Jonathan Engler is the co-chair of Heart, where Claire Craig works.

35:17.768 --> 35:22.390
Claire Craig was the head of the 100,000 Genomes Project before the pandemic.

35:22.410 --> 35:25.292
Not that dissimilar to what we're talking about here.

35:26.581 --> 35:35.189
where they use the pandemic to manage the population pyramid and invert our sovereignty into experimental animal status because that's what they all wanted before the pandemic.

35:35.710 --> 35:44.618
This is a retired pharma exec that if she knew anything she would know how biologics are made and therefore know that an RNA made that way would never be pure.

35:45.419 --> 35:59.749
Just like this guy would definitely know that, and that guy would definitely know that, and that fat guy up there is probably too stupid to know that, but he's not too stupid to know that supplementary oxygen done willy-nilly, I don't know, at like 60 liters a minute of pure, would kill somebody.

36:01.670 --> 36:08.975
That's why Pierre Cory was a witness for the George Floyd trial and testified that the police killed him.

36:09.055 --> 36:10.817
These are all one show!

36:12.557 --> 36:17.919
And so as they perform on substack and post on each other, it gets much worse than that.

36:18.800 --> 36:25.582
Because somebody like Sasha Latupova can also have like an anonymous substack, you know, where, oh, that came in wrong.

36:25.642 --> 36:26.663
Sorry, I got to change that.

36:27.463 --> 36:28.664
I don't want that first.

36:28.724 --> 36:29.544
I want that last.

36:34.701 --> 36:40.522
Because Sasha Latapova can also use like a anonymous substack, like being nobody, going nowhere.

36:41.182 --> 36:49.344
This might be a good guy, who knows, but he writes a substack with fuck off, fuck off, fuck off in the title, so he's not really trying to get a wide audience.

36:50.645 --> 36:56.366
But this substack, of course, has a lot of commentary about how the no-virus people are a fake.

36:57.358 --> 36:59.159
It's ridiculous to stop there.

36:59.260 --> 37:05.645
It's very similar to what I've been saying for the last four and a half years, but let's ignore that for a second.

37:05.685 --> 37:17.434
Let's just assume that this is a spontaneous substack and that this is just how we're gonna get free because people on substack like this dude, being nobody, going nowhere is gonna save us.

37:17.514 --> 37:21.237
Well, what do we see in the substack if we roll down to the bottom?

37:21.277 --> 37:22.678
We see two comments.

37:23.831 --> 37:29.153
There's 458 more comments, but there are two comments, one and two.

37:29.273 --> 37:39.377
The second one is Sasha Latipova, and we're supposed to believe that that's by accident, that the only one that shows up on the bottom here is this Mike Wallach, and then Sasha Latipova.

37:39.397 --> 37:44.999
There's 458 other comments, but this is the one, maybe this was the second one there, who knows?

37:47.031 --> 37:50.514
Now what I find very curious about this is just let's read this.

37:50.794 --> 37:53.737
Yes, no virus trolls are a psyop.

37:53.857 --> 37:59.542
They are a nasty cult like set of mostly anonymous trolls, but there are a few named individuals too.

38:00.102 --> 38:03.345
They behave very much like the Scientology cult.

38:03.465 --> 38:04.046
That's dumb.

38:04.646 --> 38:17.517
to drop in there because that's just a nod to Matt Crawford's wild goose chase, or it might not be a wild goose chase, but that's a thread that doesn't matter because it doesn't talk at all about the brass tacks of how we think our way out.

38:18.018 --> 38:21.261
Very aggressive, posts the same mockingbird comments everywhere.

38:22.001 --> 38:24.243
Become irate the minute they are told to calm down.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.825
I had to ban several of them.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.965
Ooh, she had to ban them.

38:27.726 --> 38:30.469
One is Christine Massey, a total nutcase.

38:31.149 --> 38:34.156
If she shows up in your feed, my advice is ban right away.

38:34.216 --> 38:36.942
I got them under control on my page being ruthless.

38:37.864 --> 38:39.669
Social media is like a prison yard.

38:41.618 --> 38:57.626
Now, so she's claiming that Christine Massey is her total nutcase, even though remember in my story, Christine Massey is the representative of the no virus group that was having regular comment connections and communication with me while I was a staff scientist at CHD.

38:57.746 --> 39:05.891
And Mary Holland had asked me to write a suitable response where I tried to bring them both together in understanding

39:06.849 --> 39:10.473
that the manufacture of biologics was the key to understanding this.

39:10.573 --> 39:14.477
The illusion of RNA pandemicking was the key to understanding this.

39:15.077 --> 39:20.083
Understanding that it's always been transfection was key to understanding this and they ignored it all.

39:20.845 --> 39:38.120
CHD ignored it and more importantly they hid behind the idea that the no virus people had such a ridiculous response that you know, you got to send some some Links and articles where the articles that show that infectious clones are real and it was like wait What are you talking about?

39:38.140 --> 39:42.083
You're not that dumb, but the whole time of course, that was Christine Massey.

39:42.143 --> 39:48.429
So now we have Sasha Latipova the mother of Soph Alex Jones star

39:49.833 --> 40:11.136
retired pharma executive, sold her company to Pfizer, got all of her money while she was at the University of Rochester from the Democratic Party, voted Clinton according to her own daughter on Alex Jones, this lady who once spent like three days in a row just tweeting all day long about how terrible I was.

40:12.759 --> 40:18.663
This lady right here was on stage with Robert Malone is now saying that Christine Massey is one of these total nutcases.

40:18.723 --> 40:23.626
It gets so much better once you just open up and see it.

40:27.989 --> 40:31.752
Now, this is another comment that she makes.

40:32.540 --> 40:34.403
which I just find extraordinary.

40:35.265 --> 40:40.233
I know the difference between informed debates and logical arguments and a total internet troll operation.

40:40.674 --> 40:46.424
I got attacked by PSYOPs on all sides, except the PROVACs mainstream who seem to pretend I don't exist.

40:48.055 --> 40:52.618
So why would it matter whether she exists to the pro-vax mainstream?

40:53.158 --> 41:16.014
On the other hand, me, who is in the Wuhan cover-up book as an expert and is now calling Bobby Kennedy essentially a puppeted, scripted fraud, and calling out the NIH director as a foreign agent, calling out the head of the FDA and the head of CBER as a possible foreign agent puppets, all run by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's associates,

41:17.662 --> 41:21.824
and everybody on the pro-vax mainstream seems to ignore me.

41:24.606 --> 41:37.172
I get attacked by the Nanobot Nutjobs, the Jicky Leaks Mouse Collective, the Kevins, is that Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan, the two people that I have association with since 2020?

41:39.568 --> 41:45.531
You mean the ones that I've been calling out for the last five years, Robert Malone and half of the Maha and their trolls, you name it.

41:45.591 --> 41:48.233
I'm an expert at attracting all the best the internet has to offer.

41:48.253 --> 41:53.676
And the no virus anonymous swarming of any account that has a following, that's a PSYOP campaign without a doubt.

41:53.716 --> 41:57.558
Those are not good people trying to convince, they are a nasty bullshit cult, thanks.

42:00.580 --> 42:05.383
They are not in search, you see, this is how fraudulent it's become.

42:06.564 --> 42:08.246
This is the last of their bench.

42:08.966 --> 42:16.854
They're actually considering the possibility she's auditioning to play the role of opposition to the Kevins.

42:19.736 --> 42:20.637
The mother of Soph.

42:24.641 --> 42:25.662
I don't know why that happened.

42:25.682 --> 42:26.202
What was that?

42:26.403 --> 42:27.283
Hold on one second.

42:27.944 --> 42:28.705
Oh yeah, that was that one.

42:28.725 --> 42:29.145
That's fine.

42:30.326 --> 42:31.908
So let me just show you what I mean here.

42:33.530 --> 42:34.290
Just watch this.

42:35.110 --> 42:37.851
This is that comment that I just showed you right here, right?

42:37.971 --> 42:39.412
This was the one I clicked open.

42:39.452 --> 42:41.692
And this is, I know the difference between informed debates.

42:42.473 --> 42:51.835
Now, if you scroll and look at all the comments, remember, these are all the comments that are under her original comment on a sub stack that she didn't write.

42:52.756 --> 42:57.457
Now, if I show you this and you're gonna, you can't tell me that they're not working there.

42:58.541 --> 43:12.908
You can't tell me that they're not working at Substack and being paid through the laundering money machine of this fake subscriptions or whatever the hell they are on Substack because this is absolutely preposterous.

43:14.489 --> 43:20.733
There is no way that somebody who has a life is doing this on a daily basis.

43:21.633 --> 43:25.175
Look at all these responses that she wrote in one day

43:26.405 --> 43:31.990
in one day of comments on a substack that supposedly she didn't even write.

43:35.573 --> 43:50.785
And once you realize that, of course, her team wrote it, the same team that she plays for wrote it, and then she springboards off of it to get people to come back to her account, to get people to follow those stupid leads, and to be a subscriber to her.

43:52.226 --> 43:53.107
They're all whores.

43:54.793 --> 44:02.498
They're social media whores and they have the benefit of programming and administrative privileges on these platforms.

44:03.039 --> 44:04.540
There's no way to explain this.

44:05.380 --> 44:17.048
Best case scenario, this is her kid or somebody that they just hire because they're so rich or they just hire because they're part of a machine, the same machine that Alex Jones is a part of.

44:17.108 --> 44:20.931
Maybe this is a production of Alex Jones's company, I don't know.

44:22.642 --> 44:23.382
Why not, right?

44:23.423 --> 44:25.664
I mean, he had her three times on his stream.

44:25.824 --> 44:36.191
I mean, she's clearly an abusive parent in the sense of, if you look at the earliest videos of Soph, you know, when she's really underage, it's just gross.

44:36.451 --> 44:46.858
And to think that, that, that CHD and Meryl Nass and Pauly Tommy promoted this woman as some kind of legit chick that have been on stage with her multiple times.

44:46.898 --> 44:49.980
I mean, Mary Holland just said her name the other day.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.841
I mean, it's, it's, it's gross.

44:54.517 --> 44:56.439
But it's only gross if you can see it.

44:56.539 --> 45:06.008
It's only gross if you have a long enough perspective in your understanding of how these people have played this to see that they are just one malevolent team.

45:08.638 --> 45:14.082
So not even a day ago, she says that pandemics are fiction and gain of functions are also fiction.

45:14.142 --> 45:17.205
So she's trying really hard, you know, really, really hard.

45:17.265 --> 45:20.367
And Daniel Negassi is telling her, no, no, no.

45:20.407 --> 45:32.036
And just to tell you, no, I, Daniel Negassi might be a good guy, but the only contact I've ever had with Daniel Negassi is that he contacted me on Twitter and asked if I wanted to start a sequencing and synthesis company.

45:33.933 --> 45:35.234
I mean, I can't make this shit up.

45:35.775 --> 45:40.180
So when I see this, and I see this, I just see a show.

45:40.200 --> 45:43.804
I don't care if they're witting or unwitting anymore.

45:43.884 --> 45:48.410
Sasha Latapova is one of the worst, if she's an American, she's one of the worst Americans alive.

45:49.451 --> 45:53.636
She's a huge fraud and evidence of her, of her

45:55.143 --> 46:02.885
malevolence is in her earliest videos of her daughter, which are just in my mind evidence of child abuse or something else.

46:02.945 --> 46:03.806
I mean, it's gross.

46:04.846 --> 46:13.149
And she also takes advantage of the fact that her daughter wasn't very old looking as a kid, you know, and that's also gross, right?

46:13.209 --> 46:24.092
If you have a daughter that looks really young and then you also are interested in putting her on the internet and having her fake overdose and talk about sex, that's Sasha Latupova.

46:25.899 --> 46:36.158
And so now we're going to have a little fake argument here between Daniel Legassi and Sasha Latapova, who will be really, you know, cordial with each other about, well, there might be plant viruses, but there are not other viruses.

46:36.178 --> 46:37.721
This is all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

46:40.871 --> 46:42.172
These people are all frauds.

46:42.292 --> 46:43.552
They're all frauds.

46:43.612 --> 46:45.033
They're all working together.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.515
They're all on the same script.

46:47.555 --> 46:57.060
That's why Nick Hudson had to be off the coast of Turkey with Robert Malone and his wife on a cruise with probably Meryl Nass and a bunch of these other people, because that's how this is done.

46:59.921 --> 47:04.344
And they slowly read people in on what they need to understand, explain it to them as best they can.

47:04.384 --> 47:06.845
But there are a few people who get the script like we got it.

47:08.424 --> 47:11.626
But once you get it, it's pretty obvious what's going on here.

47:12.387 --> 47:13.788
Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:13.848 --> 47:19.711
had Sasha Latupova on his Defender podcast for a whole hour, whereas with me, what did he do?

47:20.532 --> 47:35.502
He originally booked me for an hour, but then within two days of the show, he decided he needed to have Robert Malone, Meryl Ness, Jessica Rose, and Tess Laurie as witness to my very short presentation.

47:37.557 --> 47:40.099
I mean, that's the admission, that's it.

47:40.299 --> 47:41.419
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:41.459 --> 47:47.043
is scripted, he has handlers, he has people that he trusts, and those people are manipulating him.

47:47.583 --> 47:50.625
They've used him to get people into positions of power.

47:51.325 --> 47:54.147
I don't think they are manipulating the Trump administration.

47:54.187 --> 47:57.889
They're part of the show that is the Trump administration.

47:57.969 --> 48:00.511
Don't think that Donald Trump is some kind of mastermind.

48:00.531 --> 48:04.433
He's an idiot, and he's being run by people who are much smarter than him.

48:05.871 --> 48:07.873
He's just better on camera than Joe Biden.

48:11.176 --> 48:15.761
America is in very big trouble because these people were put in place, many of them before the pandemic.

48:15.821 --> 48:22.448
People like Vinay Prasad were put in place before the pandemic, around the same time that Brett Weinstein was put in place.

48:30.509 --> 48:38.652
And so these key actors, which were put in play, look at this now, I have to zoom out because we don't even, I don't even have this data for the black space over here.

48:38.672 --> 48:39.792
I don't have this data.

48:40.272 --> 48:45.054
So it's worse than it has ever been in the sense of how long they've run the time out.

48:45.114 --> 48:48.875
Look at this signal and tell me that you can see it.

48:50.759 --> 48:53.061
They murdered people in America and lied about it.

48:53.101 --> 48:57.024
It's manslaughter, I get it, but it's definitely murder.

48:58.785 --> 49:17.620
Now the important thing to understand, and I didn't say it, I should have said it on this screen, is that it's during 2015, that's right here, that Mary Holland was first on Democracy Now opposite Paul Offit talking about how one component of the MMR

49:19.472 --> 49:25.155
untested against placebo caused autism in her son, and she just wants safe vaccines.

49:26.536 --> 49:32.979
And now we are a decade later in 2025, and they have not preceded their narrative at all.

49:33.039 --> 49:41.683
In fact, it's so malevolent right now that on the other side of the coin, ladies and gentlemen, they believe

49:43.345 --> 49:58.848
that the lie about autism has essentially been debunked because claiming victory for removing thalidomide and mercury from the vaccine schedule is ridiculous because they took it out of the MMR already years and years ago.

50:01.168 --> 50:03.969
That's the actual happening right now.

50:04.849 --> 50:06.029
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:06.089 --> 50:08.089
was used to walk us right into that trap.

50:08.129 --> 50:09.450
Paul Offit is dunking.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.450
They're all dunking on him.

50:12.366 --> 50:15.648
And it's happening all over the internet and all over mainstream media.

50:15.788 --> 50:16.629
It's absurd.

50:16.709 --> 50:19.871
And at the same time, we have people telling us it's good.

50:19.911 --> 50:22.833
So first watch the bad, and then we'll watch the good.

50:23.714 --> 50:30.559
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

50:34.599 --> 50:43.425
From Microbe TV, this is TWiV, This Week in Virology, Episode 1232, recorded on July 3rd, 2024.

50:43.765 --> 50:50.049
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and you're listening to the podcast, All About Viruses.

50:50.789 --> 50:54.632
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

50:54.992 --> 50:56.333
Hello, everyone.

50:57.691 --> 51:02.213
Yeah, I really can't see anything on your tie, so you'll have to tell me or give me a clue.

51:02.293 --> 51:03.913
I just see blue and yellow.

51:04.413 --> 51:06.034
OK, so yellow is good.

51:06.154 --> 51:08.915
So there are these golden grape.

51:09.015 --> 51:12.256
I might just escape out of here and see if this works.

51:14.797 --> 51:15.097
No.

51:15.318 --> 51:16.318
OK, I got to do.

51:19.122 --> 51:27.471
I'm going to put it up on a separate video because then I can speed it up for us.

51:29.033 --> 51:32.517
But I do want you to hear it because I want you to really hear what they're saying.

51:32.537 --> 51:39.365
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

51:42.458 --> 51:48.702
From Microbe TV, this is TWIV, This Week in Virology, episode 1232, recorded on July 3rd, 2024.

51:50.403 --> 51:53.264
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

51:53.785 --> 51:56.286
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

51:56.686 --> 51:57.647
Hello, everyone.

51:58.808 --> 52:01.689
I really can't see anything on your tie, so you'll have to tell me, or give me a clue.

52:01.749 --> 52:02.890
I just see blue and yellow.

52:03.210 --> 52:04.351
Okay, so yellow's good.

52:04.411 --> 52:08.313
So there are these golden grape-like clusters of bacteria.

52:08.513 --> 52:08.914
Streptococci.

52:10.946 --> 52:13.907
So say grapes in, what is it, Greek or Latin?

52:15.447 --> 52:16.008
Staph, is it?

52:16.048 --> 52:17.168
Staph, you got, yep, staph.

52:17.188 --> 52:18.908
But the streps were the grape-like clusters.

52:18.928 --> 52:24.530
The strep tends to be in strips, think of it that way, strepped in strips, like they'll be either diplococci or they'll be chains.

52:24.590 --> 52:26.070
At least I was gram-positive, right?

52:26.110 --> 52:27.251
Yeah, you got there.

52:28.431 --> 52:29.831
What was the diplococcus?

52:29.851 --> 52:30.732
That was an old name for what?

52:31.072 --> 52:32.112
For strepped pneumoniae.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.113
Diplococcus, and they change it to strep pneumonia.

52:34.253 --> 52:39.696
Yeah, and also, you know, meningitis, so Neisseria meningitidis also is a gram-negative Diplococci, so yeah.

52:40.037 --> 52:43.299
Okay, so we have Staphylococcus aureus on your tie today.

52:43.599 --> 52:52.765
Yes, and you know, I was going in this morning to Columbia, and we're going to discuss this man who had methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus bacteremia, but he, the terminology they like to use at Columbia is he eloped.

52:54.246 --> 52:59.389
He did not go and find a bride and skip the church, he just skipped the church, skipped the hospital, and headed out into the world, so.

53:00.489 --> 53:01.910
Hopefully he will make better decisions.

53:02.170 --> 53:03.950
Could you say he is sensitive or resistant?

53:04.191 --> 53:05.051
So sensitive, yes.

53:05.071 --> 53:08.812
We have the methicillin sensitive, the methicillin resistant staph aureus.

53:09.053 --> 53:09.813
Sensitive is good, right?

53:10.353 --> 53:13.234
It's good, but if you don't get any antibiotics, then it's not good.

53:13.254 --> 53:14.195
Yeah, then it's not going to matter, right?

53:14.615 --> 53:14.835
Yeah.

53:14.855 --> 53:14.895
OK.

53:14.915 --> 53:15.975
All right, let's jump in.

53:15.996 --> 53:16.716
We got a lot to cover today.

53:16.756 --> 53:17.716
Oops, they admitted something there.

53:17.736 --> 53:20.677
We'll start off with a quotation from Winston Churchill in a little while.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.938
It's kind of an admission, right?

53:22.058 --> 53:23.879
If you don't get antibiotics, you're in big trouble.

53:24.879 --> 53:28.721
But a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put its pants on.

53:29.421 --> 53:31.902
And I can sort of picture Winston saying this.

53:33.102 --> 53:38.344
But we've had some issues recently, and I'm going to start off with that.

53:38.364 --> 53:45.146
I want to try to make sure when I'm covering things that people might consider political, I'm going to really focus on what is the science that people need to understand?

53:45.186 --> 53:46.167
What's the science that's out there?

53:46.447 --> 53:48.227
So I'm not really being political.

53:48.347 --> 53:52.889
I think if you want to participate in a democracy, it's important to be informed, and I'm going

53:53.189 --> 53:54.010
keep helping people.

53:54.830 --> 53:57.772
But let's start with, you know, should this continue to be an issue?

53:57.792 --> 54:06.517
I'm going to leave in a link to a CDC document, and this document addresses something that people have been chatting about recently in the document, which was taken down, but I've got a link here for you.

54:06.997 --> 54:10.620
Thimerosal containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, review of the evidence.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.963
And this actually reviews the science on thimersol and vaccines.

54:14.304 --> 54:17.488
And just a few quotations, but I'm going to leave in a link so people can go, they can peruse.

54:18.028 --> 54:18.929
So what is the story?

54:18.969 --> 54:29.402
So thimersol is an ethyl mercury-containing compound that was used for decades in the United States as a preservative in multi-dose vials of vaccines and other products to prevent growth of harmful microbes such as bacteria and fungi.

54:29.802 --> 54:35.968
Under the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the use of thermosol in childhood vaccines.

54:36.368 --> 54:43.014
This review found no evidence of harm from the use of thermosol as a vaccine preservative other than local hypersensitivity reactions.

54:43.414 --> 54:49.480
In 1999, with input from the Public Health Service and other partners, FDA requested all vaccine manufacturers for plans to remove thermosol from vaccines.

54:49.900 --> 54:54.084
This was taken as a precautionary step, not due to evidence of harm, to reduce an infant's overall exposure to mercury,

54:54.424 --> 54:57.386
given that other environmental sources of mercury were challenging to eliminate.

54:57.766 --> 55:03.490
Now, if people listen to the recent ACIP meeting, they're kind of rehashing this same discussion 26 years later.

55:03.510 --> 55:06.772
So, 1999, they say, let's get a plan, let's get this out of there.

55:07.233 --> 55:13.217
Since 2001, for 24 years, all childhood vaccines licensed and recommended have been thimersol-free.

55:13.857 --> 55:14.017
Right?

55:14.457 --> 55:17.318
With the exception of some multi-dose formulations of influenza vaccines.

55:18.078 --> 55:25.960
Several vaccines used in the United States, for example, MMR, varicella, inactivated polio, pneumococcal conjugate, which we were just talking about, have never contained thimersal.

55:26.360 --> 55:30.681
I just want to like, when people bring up this argument, they think it's the thimersal, the mercury, and an MMR that causes autism.

55:31.361 --> 55:31.922
What thimersal?

55:31.942 --> 55:32.802
What mercury and MMR?

55:32.962 --> 55:33.142
Okay.

55:33.162 --> 55:33.462
What autism?

55:33.802 --> 55:35.603
Yeah, and you know.

55:35.663 --> 55:39.283
And so, I hope you can see that that is in it very succinctly.

55:40.684 --> 55:41.424
What autism?

55:43.342 --> 55:50.107
They have, without a doubt, in the minds of most people, discredited anybody who said it's the mercury in the vaccines.

55:50.167 --> 55:53.970
And of course, Bobby was doing the mercury in the fish, right?

55:54.611 --> 55:55.952
Doesn't make him anti-fish.

55:59.835 --> 56:01.756
I mean, that's actually where we are.

56:02.597 --> 56:04.318
This is this week in America.

56:05.279 --> 56:07.981
And like it or not, this is how we are being broken.

56:08.021 --> 56:13.065
And there's a million podcasts that are breaking us just on this one line.

56:15.011 --> 56:18.892
that anti-vax skepticism has been debunked.

56:19.772 --> 56:36.296
And they are magnificent with it because the old videos circulating around of Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and all of these people are carefully chosen to set these people up for a t-ball level home run.

56:37.816 --> 56:38.957
All you gotta do is swing.

56:40.617 --> 56:43.838
This is incredible because Paul Offit, of course, is doing it too.

56:48.295 --> 56:52.056
2025 season, 96% of all the flu shots in the U.S.

56:52.096 --> 56:54.076
were thimerosal-free.

56:54.096 --> 56:58.237
98% of federal vaccines procured through the Vaccines for Children, or 3017 program, thimerosal-free.

56:58.877 --> 57:06.599
A recent analysis from CDC's vaccine data link, because they're all worried about, oh, the pregnant women are getting this, only 0.3% of doses had thimerosal.

57:06.899 --> 57:09.359
So thimerosal was taken out of vaccines in the U.S.

57:09.379 --> 57:09.439
in 2001.

57:10.139 --> 57:13.100
MMR vaccines do not and never contain thimerosal in the U.S.

57:14.440 --> 57:22.483
Recently, this whole discussion, they spent like a whole bunch of our taxpayer dollars, you know, chatting about revisiting this, and then they had this, you know, thimersol, you know, vaccines not recommended.

57:22.743 --> 57:31.347
The WHO responded to the ACIP decisions, and they said, thimersol has been reviewed multiple times by multiple agencies, including WHO, and it's clear from the evidence that there is no evidence of harm from the use of thimersol.

57:31.627 --> 57:34.428
Dr. Katherine O'Brien from the WHO told reporters on Friday.

57:35.905 --> 57:36.946
It's just a show, Daniel.

57:36.966 --> 57:38.266
They just want to show that they're in charge.

57:39.247 --> 57:42.609
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out, like, you know, how is this a win when it wasn't a problem?

57:43.089 --> 57:45.591
The same arguments were, you know, 25 years ago.

57:45.611 --> 57:50.994
It's like, you know what, listen, it doesn't look like there's any issue here, but, you know, just to be on the safe side, let's, you know, get this out.

57:51.394 --> 57:58.218
There are just a few situations, like really in nursing homes, other areas, mostly overseas where thermosol might be used because there's a price point issue.

57:58.839 --> 58:00.199
You know, we're seeing, what, 0.3% of pregnant women?

58:01.520 --> 58:02.804
you know, so really not an issue there.

58:03.566 --> 58:07.637
He's really just telling you that this has been a national security priority for decades.

58:09.036 --> 58:17.559
The acceptance of intramuscular injection, a standard medical procedure, has been a national security priority for decades.

58:17.639 --> 58:24.922
Not that dissimilar to if you were working with livestock and you wanted to be sure that they weren't afraid of a chainsaw.

58:25.482 --> 58:34.846
When they were very young, you would bring out a chainsaw and run it every once in a while so that by the time that they grew up into very big cows, when they heard a chainsaw, they wouldn't run away.

58:36.610 --> 58:38.471
And that's what you're doing here right now.

58:38.551 --> 58:54.580
If you want to invert people's idea and the fear of needles and the understanding of who they are and how ridiculous it would be to allow something to stab into your arm, you got to work over decades.

58:55.220 --> 58:57.181
And you got to work over generations.

58:58.541 --> 59:09.552
We're talking about overcoming something that is antithetical to our biology and the fear and understanding of it has to be so complete that we just don't get it anymore.

59:09.612 --> 59:17.240
It's like if you needed people to be not afraid of snakes, it would take a lot of work and a lot of training.

59:17.984 --> 59:29.949
And you'd have to start with the adults and make sure that you had a whole generation of adults that could handle snakes and loved snakes and accepted that, well, everybody's got to go through this period of time where you have snakes in your backyard.

59:30.469 --> 59:31.770
And so you're going to have to pick one up.

59:32.390 --> 59:39.473
You're going to have to hold one for a little while, and you're going to have to be okay with it so that when you have kids, you can do the same thing with your kids.

59:45.799 --> 59:48.840
This is a very, very long con, ladies and gentlemen.

59:50.020 --> 59:53.041
I hate this message, but it is the truth.

59:54.541 --> 59:56.242
It is the truth as best I know it.

59:58.582 --> 01:00:07.804
And the fake health freedom movement that is essentially embodied best in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, and CHD.

01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:10.565
These people are frauds.

01:00:13.089 --> 01:00:23.835
And they are fraud, they are frauds, but they are a part of, a genuine part of this national security operation that I think actually he is less aware of than they.

01:00:25.536 --> 01:00:35.421
That Daniel Griffin is a genuine doctor who believes genuinely that the books he's read and the facts that he remembers from those books are real.

01:00:36.361 --> 01:00:37.282
Because he's read the,

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.813
two volumes of infectious diseases.

01:00:40.874 --> 01:00:42.956
He's read the two volumes of virology.

01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:47.662
He's read that big book on vaccines and used it as a reference for his whole career.

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:52.888
And he's not a biologist.

01:00:57.189 --> 01:00:58.870
Children, it's not part of the vaccine schedule.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.391
It's sort of a problem for the, you know, I think I like the analogy of when the dog catches the car.

01:01:02.671 --> 01:01:03.752
Like, thimbersaw's gone.

01:01:03.772 --> 01:01:04.612
There's no mercury here.

01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:06.953
But you were telling us that it was causing all this autism.

01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:13.716
Autism, according to you guys, is rising 25 years of thimbersaw out of the vaccines and never even in the vaccine that you claim is the big concern of yours.

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.977
So it's sort of a problem with the arguments here.

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:19.780
Well, you know, he helped Americans by taking data.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.381
So there's two parts to that, right?

01:01:21.421 --> 01:01:28.547
The first one is, is that Mary Holland and Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy all said what?

01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:33.712
That it was the MMR that caused autism.

01:01:33.772 --> 01:01:38.736
The MMR shot is what, when my son suddenly changed.

01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:49.261
And so think about how remarkable it is that they are still stuck on that shot talking about that specific thing.

01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:50.402
It is a script.

01:01:51.824 --> 01:01:54.767
The MMR shot is connected to Texas this year.

01:01:54.827 --> 01:01:57.711
It's connected to Samoa before the pandemic.

01:01:57.771 --> 01:01:59.333
It's connected to Rolling Stone.

01:02:02.884 --> 01:02:05.905
This is all one malevolent show, one malevolent script.

01:02:06.025 --> 01:02:10.887
And because it's a script over so many years, it's really hard for us to see it.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:15.869
But not only do you have to try and imagine it, you have to try and accept it.

01:02:15.929 --> 01:02:21.152
Because before you do, you're not going to be able to take any meaningful action against it.

01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:23.573
Here's Mercury out of your vaccine.

01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:24.133
That's what he'll say.

01:02:24.513 --> 01:02:25.974
And people will be, oh, that's so lovely.

01:02:26.154 --> 01:02:26.674
It was already out.

01:02:26.854 --> 01:02:29.035
Basically, they were just like a tiny, you know, yeah.

01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:31.912
So a nice article in the Wall Street Journal, RFK Jr.'

01:02:31.892 --> 01:02:32.972
's vaccine panel has a new approach.

01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:33.792
Question everything.

01:02:33.872 --> 01:02:35.853
ACP is supposed to be a committee that looks at the evidence.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:38.314
Well, that evidence-based mandate was repeated several times during the meeting.

01:02:38.414 --> 01:02:41.575
One of the members of the committee was not really on board with making evidence-based recommendations.

01:02:41.615 --> 01:02:44.736
So this really is what had me sort of thrown.

01:02:45.017 --> 01:02:52.239
We heard from Retzov Levi, who voted against the new monoclonal antibody for RSV, that as a father, his outlook takes him beyond the science and data.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.040
MIT professor?

01:02:56.566 --> 01:03:06.674
On one of the panels organized by Senator Ron Johnson and Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, he's scripted.

01:03:08.715 --> 01:03:18.643
He could also be just kind of naive, but he's definitely scripted because he's not skeptical of the foundational idea, therefore he doesn't understand.

01:03:19.564 --> 01:03:22.026
If you're not skeptical of intramuscular injection,

01:03:23.072 --> 01:03:30.134
as a methodology, then you are either scripted and you don't understand or you are scripted and you don't care.

01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:36.176
It's one or the other because that is the point we have been making for more than two years straight now.

01:03:39.317 --> 01:03:46.720
And it's a very significant point that quite frankly, all sides of this equation find necessary to ignore.

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:55.805
That's why in all of the copying of my story that Sasha Latapova was done, she never really summarized it at the end.

01:03:55.845 --> 01:04:01.167
She didn't even say that gain of function is a fiction in that post, right?

01:04:01.227 --> 01:04:05.228
She just said that all these people don't like me because I'm so smart.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.801
She's so fraudulent.

01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:09.923
It's just kind of a joke.

01:04:10.443 --> 01:04:23.613
And if you look at all the some activity of her on those platforms, if you look at the some activity of Robert Malone and where they are and where they're posting and start keeping tracking of it, you can't, it's impossible.

01:04:25.638 --> 01:04:27.339
None of these people are real.

01:04:27.419 --> 01:04:33.141
They are weaponized images on a social media platform or platforms.

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:43.665
And those weaponized images have confused the truth-seeking conservative right of America and fractured us into a million little pieces.

01:04:45.117 --> 01:04:55.249
And it's going to cost us our country if we don't pull our heads out, because the left is pretty unified on the fact that these people that we're cheering for are shitheads.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:56.190
And they're right.

01:04:56.971 --> 01:04:57.752
They're right.

01:05:00.367 --> 01:05:01.368
What the hell is he talking about?

01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:02.470
First of all, why is he on there?

01:05:03.431 --> 01:05:04.613
That's all you have to look at, the science and data.

01:05:04.633 --> 01:05:05.714
It makes no sense, Red Ceph.

01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:07.877
Yeah, I mean, we're asking for evidence-based recommendations.

01:05:07.997 --> 01:05:14.206
As a father trying to keep kids safe, including yours, the science, the evidence, this is what we look to.

01:05:14.226 --> 01:05:17.951
We don't look to, I don't know, the impression that you get from social media and some...

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.744
So some, many, who work to provide vaccines already review the ACIP as a lost cause.

01:05:24.764 --> 01:05:29.267
The University of Minnesota is now home to a group working to make alternative recommendations, the Vaccine Integrity Project.

01:05:29.907 --> 01:05:35.010
And I'm going to read a quote here from Michael Osterholm, the epidemiologist who helps direct this project.

01:05:35.451 --> 01:05:41.595
The meeting served as further evidence that vaccine information and recommendations, at least temporarily, need a new independent home outside the US government.

01:05:43.226 --> 01:05:46.749
All right, now I've got a very disturbing but really good article.

01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:53.174
And so it's almost like the FDA is going to be dismantled or destroyed or made irrelevant.

01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:54.576
Right.

01:05:54.836 --> 01:05:58.099
Like Mark and I predicted, because Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:11.370
's dad and Brett Weinstein's dad and Steve Bannon and and Aaron Siri and Goldman Sachs and and Peter Thiel and and Eric Weinstein and Elon Musk, it's all just kind of makes sense.

01:06:14.726 --> 01:06:19.747
America's being sold to the highest bidder, being fought over by the highest bidders.

01:06:19.847 --> 01:06:25.349
I don't know how to exactly characterize it, but we were the victims of an elaborate long con.

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:37.712
Maybe because it's hard to keep a project like the Human Genome Project going continuously without people wanting to retire and then other people wanting to take control of the vacuum that's left.

01:06:38.652 --> 01:06:40.373
Maybe that's what we're witnessing right now.

01:06:41.073 --> 01:06:41.773
I don't really know.

01:06:42.509 --> 01:06:50.317
But I do know that none of the things that are being made to seem as though they are very interesting on social media are interesting at all.

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:52.699
All the wrong questions are being amplified.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.062
All the actors are being amplified.

01:06:55.822 --> 01:06:58.325
All of the nonsense is circulating.

01:06:58.365 --> 01:07:01.308
There's nobody like me, Mark, and Joe.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.828
If you can only read one article, read this one.

01:07:05.448 --> 01:07:09.450
Top FDA official overrode scientists on COVID shots by Christina Jewett.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:10.951
So this deals with another issue.

01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:13.712
And so I'll just sort of give people some background, say, well, what is going on here?

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:20.355
So the way it's supposed to work, and maybe this helps people with understanding, is that the FDA has these committees, these groups.

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.276
And I'll be a number of experts on these.

01:07:22.336 --> 01:07:23.016
I'll go through the data.

01:07:23.036 --> 01:07:29.179
They prepare these really well-edited, well-thought-out, basically, reports that then go to the head of the FDA.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:33.640
So recently we had Novavax coming up for full licensing.

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:36.722
So you've got multiple pages, really well written.

01:07:36.782 --> 01:07:38.882
Here's all the data on what's going on with COVID.

01:07:39.162 --> 01:07:44.684
It's really important to know how many people are dying, how many people are being hospitalized, how many people are ending up with issues after the fact.

01:07:46.385 --> 01:07:47.727
And then a lot of data on the vaccines.

01:07:47.767 --> 01:07:48.548
Does the vaccine work?

01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:49.770
Does the vaccine reduce deaths?

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:50.932
Does it reduce hospitalizations?

01:07:51.012 --> 01:07:51.393
All the rest.

01:07:52.254 --> 01:07:54.598
So you end up with dozens of staff experts.

01:07:54.878 --> 01:07:55.940
They put together this report.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.584
And then the FDA gets to make a decision.

01:07:58.604 --> 01:08:01.027
Are we going to make this product available to the public or not?

01:08:01.528 --> 01:08:07.652
Now, there is one example where there was a particular product, it was felt to be a high-risk product, and the previous head of the FDA said, listen, there's no other options.

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:16.197
We realize that this particular therapy might have a high risk of issues, but we want to give people a choice because otherwise this is a deadly disease.

01:08:16.237 --> 01:08:17.738
I forget which, it was a neurodegenerative disease.

01:08:18.659 --> 01:08:21.100
And so that was sort of the only precedent we have in the past.

01:08:21.361 --> 01:08:23.182
But the FDA is there to make a decision, license or not.

01:08:23.322 --> 01:08:26.384
Not, oh, we're going to license it, but then I'm only going to decide who gets access.

01:08:26.404 --> 01:08:27.785
I'm going to make everyone else use it off-license.

01:08:28.665 --> 01:08:37.348
Vinay Prasad for Novavax and the new Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine is basically going to override, he's going to reject the recommendations of his staff.

01:08:37.368 --> 01:08:50.774
So this article really outlines how Vinay Prasad, the appointed FDA administration's top vaccine official, rejected broad uses of two COVID vaccines, citing unknown risks or injuries despite assurances of safety from dozens of staff experts.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.294
So what was my reaction?

01:08:52.814 --> 01:08:54.155
So my reaction was that I

01:08:54.375 --> 01:09:02.439
It is a dark time in the history of public health when political appointees overrule expert recommendations, pick and choose data to support their ideology, and use their position to advance personal agendas.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.963
I actually read, so I read the reports by the experts, and then I read these really poorly put together memos by Vinay Prasad.

01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:17.346
I say poorly put together, like at one point you're trying to figure out why does this sentence have these two footnotes that seem to be referencing Vinay Prasad's opinion piece twice.

01:09:17.846 --> 01:09:20.708
The reason it's confusing is it's actually a cut and paste sentence from another memo.

01:09:21.388 --> 01:09:30.434
So he's not even properly having his memos proofed on something as serious as restricting access to these vaccines and forcing those who may want to access those to have to do it.

01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:42.482
What I'm suggesting to you is that these are not by accident, just like the accidental inclusion of seemingly AI generated citations in their other reports is not by accident.

01:09:43.843 --> 01:09:45.244
This is done on purpose.

01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:51.465
with the idea of making it seem like the whole FDA is just useless.

01:09:52.887 --> 01:09:54.309
And it's not only them, right?

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:56.192
This is ongoing.

01:09:57.013 --> 01:10:00.158
Today, the FDA had a live event that would shock you.

01:10:01.428 --> 01:10:16.900
bragging about how the research scientists and the back checkers and the people that work at the FDA are going to be using an AI to do all kinds of shit now, including modeling of things so that they don't have to do toxicity with animals anymore.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.342
It is remarkable where we are.

01:10:20.831 --> 01:10:27.494
Because the inversion of our sovereignty to experimental animal status is happening fast.

01:10:27.674 --> 01:10:28.174
Off-label.

01:10:28.674 --> 01:10:36.498
So one of the things I commented on is that the memos did not really acknowledge the fact that myocarditis is occurring at a rate

01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:46.061
I say six to 16, seven to 16, but really basically to say, if you get vaccinated, you are going to reduce your risk of myocarditis tenfold because people keep getting COVID.

01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:54.324
There's a very high rate of myocarditis, or I should say tenfold higher rate of myocarditis if you get COVID without the protection of a vaccine than if you get the protection of the vaccine.

01:10:54.364 --> 01:11:00.586
So if you really want to lower the risk of myocarditis, as I like to point out, in the population with ongoing COVID cases, vaccination is safer than not vaccinating.

01:11:00.945 --> 01:11:04.147
Well, Dr. Prasad, the expert, of course, says there's no COVID anymore, so it doesn't matter.

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:04.847
We don't need to do this.

01:11:04.887 --> 01:11:05.488
Is that true, Daniel?

01:11:05.908 --> 01:11:06.448
So it's interesting.

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:13.393
He acknowledges that COVID is out there, and then there's going to be a piece I'm going to really talk about, I'm going to return back to myocarditis next time, because he does sort of go through it.

01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:15.514
He says, you know, we were seeing myocarditis, and he actually gives the rates.

01:11:15.554 --> 01:11:17.515
It's sort of this 22 to 65 per million.

01:11:19.756 --> 01:11:27.601
I think, again, the most important thing to see here is that these scripted people are scripted to talk about the other scripted people.

01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:30.243
And so you can see that it's a play.

01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:33.357
That's why these guys are on social media.

01:11:33.377 --> 01:11:37.058
They're not on social media spontaneously choosing to talk about them.

01:11:37.758 --> 01:11:43.539
They are scripted to talk about them because those people are scripted to be talked about.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.041
And the whole time, nobody's talking about the CDC director.

01:11:49.061 --> 01:11:55.002
In a minute, these guys are gonna hope that the CDC director will ignore the recommendations of the ACIP.

01:11:55.442 --> 01:12:00.903
And from her nomination interview, it would seem that that's the case.

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:06.279
first rolled out the mRNA vaccines, and particularly in this population 15 to 25.

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:14.481
Then he says, and so when this was first seen, the response was to space out the vaccine so that the doses, instead of giving three to four weeks, we're giving three months apart.

01:12:14.801 --> 01:12:20.082
So he does acknowledge, and I think he's trying to get published, that we're really not seeing post-vaccination myocarditis anymore.

01:12:20.682 --> 01:12:21.163
So that's interesting.

01:12:21.183 --> 01:12:22.843
So he points out, he goes, so we're not really seeing it anymore.

01:12:22.863 --> 01:12:24.503
So it's not really an issue, but I'm still worried about it.

01:12:24.943 --> 01:12:26.964
Now, we're certainly still seeing post-COVID myocarditis.

01:12:27.464 --> 01:12:30.625
So here's a safe, effective vaccine, which,

01:12:31.525 --> 01:12:37.249
We're not really seeing the myocarditis anymore now that we've spaced out the vaccines, but yet he wants to not let us have access.

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:40.992
So I'm going to return to this weird myocarditis thing that they keep sort of returning to.

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:44.254
The access, you're talking about people under 65 and pregnant women no longer have access.

01:12:44.314 --> 01:12:44.975
Is that correct?

01:12:45.135 --> 01:12:46.196
So with Novavax, for instance.

01:12:46.216 --> 01:12:50.939
So Novavax has been the vaccine that I've actually chosen to go with and my family's gone with for the last sort of several cycles.

01:12:50.959 --> 01:12:52.140
And now we hear it's going to be licensed.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:52.440
That's great.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.001
I'm a health care worker, constantly exposed.

01:12:54.462 --> 01:12:58.205
If I want to get a Novavax shot in the fall, that will actually have to be off-label.

01:12:58.945 --> 01:13:03.666
Yeah, he basically said, we're going to license Novavax, but we're not going to license it for Dr. Griffin, who's under 65.

01:13:04.106 --> 01:13:10.128
I did go out, remember I told you this, I went out and I bought cigarettes and I inhaled a couple of times, so now I can claim to be a former smoker and I have to get access.

01:13:11.168 --> 01:13:18.890
No, but that's what, yeah, we were actually, a number of healthcare workers, we were talking about this today, the fact that, yeah, if we want to use Novavax because we want to have less reactogenicity or whatever, no.

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:24.591
And then the new Moderna vaccine, which there are some evidence suggesting that it might actually be a little more effective than the old Moderna COVID vaccine.

01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:27.612
Again, if we want to do that to protect ourselves, it will be off-label.

01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:30.083
I don't understand his motivation there.

01:13:30.264 --> 01:13:30.486
At all.

01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:31.051
Makes no sense.

01:13:32.152 --> 01:13:32.993
It does make no sense.

01:13:33.233 --> 01:13:35.915
And unfortunately, this is probably the trope that got him in this position.

01:13:35.955 --> 01:13:42.499
He's got all these interesting ideas, epidemiology ideas about this healthy vaccine bias and why he can't trust any of the data.

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:44.200
But he's an oncologist.

01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:46.682
He's not a vaccine expert.

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:50.745
And so it's really, as I said, it's a dark time when you've got this political appointee.

01:13:50.985 --> 01:13:53.166
He's got his own ideology, his own agenda.

01:13:53.427 --> 01:13:57.849
And then even when you present him with, really, here's all the evidence, here's the science, you try to explain it to him, he's like, I don't care.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:58.790
I've already made up my mind.

01:13:58.810 --> 01:13:59.310
I made up my mind.

01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:02.972
four years ago when we first saw the myocarditis and it ain't changing you know.

01:14:04.393 --> 01:14:18.958
Now what we where we need to get is to the point where our high school teachers and our high school students can look at this man or sit across from this man or be in the chat of this show and say that actually you're wrong.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:24.601
It is, and let me rewind it just a little bit to make sure that I say it correctly.

01:14:24.842 --> 01:14:26.783
His own, you know, ideology, his own agenda.

01:14:27.023 --> 01:14:31.407
And then even when you present him with really, here's all the evidence, here's the science, you try to explain it to him, he's like, I don't care.

01:14:32.107 --> 01:14:39.453
And so the idea would be to challenge them to give you the science that shows the things that they are certain about.

01:14:41.455 --> 01:14:50.042
And what, one of the things that they need to show you is the science about why intramuscular injection is such a great methodology.

01:14:52.173 --> 01:14:52.813
Explain it.

01:14:53.734 --> 01:14:58.337
Why does it work better than subcutaneous injection of the same antigen combination?

01:14:58.377 --> 01:15:02.799
Why does it work better than inhaling the vaporized version of the same antigen combination?

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.142
Why does it work better intramuscular injection versus a pill?

01:15:07.602 --> 01:15:09.063
What's the difference between those?

01:15:09.143 --> 01:15:10.204
Talk to me, goose.

01:15:10.784 --> 01:15:12.065
Tell me what you know.

01:15:13.366 --> 01:15:16.588
That's how you challenge your family and friends to realize

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:29.016
what they themselves don't know, but they are very certain about for some reason, because that's a sign of skilled social media use, that you don't actually know, but you're certain about it.

01:15:31.398 --> 01:15:42.747
And if it's about like, you know, what the best basketball team is in the NBA, because you're just certain that the Celtics are the best team, because you're from Boston, that's very different than what I'm talking about.

01:15:42.787 --> 01:15:44.989
I'm talking about people being certain about

01:15:46.025 --> 01:15:48.666
RNA being able to pandemic, but they can't explain it.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:58.211
When you challenge them to explain why RNA can pandemic better than DNA, can you explain it to me?

01:16:00.753 --> 01:16:10.898
If you ask them to explain how intramuscular injection augments the immune system, depending on the combination of substances you choose, they won't really be able to explain it to you.

01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:15.340
They'll have a hand-waving version of it, which involves a very limited

01:16:17.151 --> 01:16:31.492
number of moving parts and it is only through six years of work that I'm able to show you this that these people are so malevolent and the script is so bad

01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:42.815
that I could go right now and pick up those six books and scream just like I did for Paul Offit, you don't have the requisite knowledge to argue with these people, because you haven't read these thousands of pages.

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:47.601
And more importantly, you don't accept these thousands of pages as fact.

01:16:49.184 --> 01:17:05.975
when in fact there's very little empirical evidence for such a high-fidelity understanding of what is essentially a genetic background that's irreducibly complex and the only tools that we have to reduce that complexity or to measure that complexity are very flawed.

01:17:08.977 --> 01:17:11.338
And they're all part of the Human Genome Project illusion.

01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:15.761
That whole core molecular biology illusion

01:17:17.828 --> 01:17:19.332
is the Human Genome Project.

01:17:19.352 --> 01:17:22.118
I've already made up my mind.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:26.026
I made up my mind four years ago when we first saw the myocarditis and it ain't changing.

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:27.870
Unbelievable.

01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:47.664
So what's going to be a challenge here is they're sort of trying to get things right, you know, sort of up ahead, because what had happened in response to the recent ACIP meeting is, you know, a lot of the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you know, they actually posted, hey, here are our recommendations.

01:17:47.684 --> 01:17:56.450
The AAP, for instance, has been doing this for decades upon decades, but now it's going to create a problem because how do you create guidance if you've got the head of the FDA, you know, not fully licensing these vaccines?

01:17:58.621 --> 01:18:03.524
All right, but fortunately, vaccine-preventable illnesses are not a problem in the US, turning to measles.

01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:05.825
I say that with tongue-in-cheek because, ouch.

01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:12.289
The article assessing the transmissibility and outbreak risk of measles in the United States, 2024 to 2030, was published in JID.

01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:15.610
So here, these authors are really asking this question, like, do we have to worry?

01:18:15.931 --> 01:18:18.032
Is there potentially going to be a measles outbreak in the US?

01:18:18.812 --> 01:18:19.432
Interesting question.

01:18:19.853 --> 01:18:28.016
So here the investigators assess the local transmissibility and outbreak risk at present and in future years under various vaccination scenarios in the United States.

01:18:28.856 --> 01:18:32.758
They looked at the, I love this, spatio-temporal outbreak risk pattern.

01:18:33.498 --> 01:18:34.718
And we've got projections through 2030.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:38.760
And really, really some nice figures here.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:48.184
So you can see based kind of where we are, and then with a 10% or a more significant drop in the vaccination coverage, what's going to happen within five or two years based upon that.

01:18:48.804 --> 01:18:55.149
And so if it declines by 10%, you can see basically you're really starting to go up 25% and then 50%.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:19:01.814
So yeah, not looking good, not looking good if this vaccination erodes even further.

01:19:02.434 --> 01:19:09.860
And it's gotten to the point now, Vincent, where if you are a US traveler and you go to, for instance, Honduras, you have to actually bring your proof of vaccination before entry.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.401
Gosh, I don't, I got mine in the 60s.

01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:12.942
I don't know where people get it.

01:19:13.182 --> 01:19:14.983
Now, proof of measles vaccination.

01:19:15.024 --> 01:19:18.326
I'm going to skip to the end of this video so you can hear one of the questions they answer.

01:19:18.346 --> 01:19:20.027
The whole video is pretty remarkable.

01:19:20.247 --> 01:19:22.409
It's really making fun of our side a lot.

01:19:23.409 --> 01:19:29.514
Catherine Organic asked the question of would would good PCR controls show the background effect?

01:19:30.555 --> 01:19:38.040
And I guess your question is, if we tried hard enough, could we start to characterize that background?

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.061
And I do think

01:19:40.366 --> 01:19:56.343
that they have made some genuine efforts to do that in other branches of biology in the characterization of phytoplankton and the cyanobacteria and archaeobacteria, archaea.

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.325
They're kind of like related to bacteria.

01:20:00.365 --> 01:20:01.887
Those guys are all in the ocean.

01:20:02.207 --> 01:20:04.069
And so that work has been done.

01:20:04.269 --> 01:20:09.194
And the phages that have been found there are, I think, probably mostly real.

01:20:09.274 --> 01:20:20.965
But again, they're doing a lot more rigorous work to show the existence of, rather than quantifying or claiming that some larger phenomenon is based on them.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:38.400
I think the extraordinary thing that has been done with PCR from the perspective of diagnostic is that it has allowed the willing doctor to completely bamboozle themselves.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:49.762
If you say, okay, this person is sick, and my name is Mary Talley Bowden, and I'm going to use this PCR test to test you for 17 different viruses, and one of them comes back positive,

01:20:50.583 --> 01:21:03.083
The odds of you saying that that has nothing to do with your symptoms would be probably very low, depending on your sophistication, depending on how often you use it, depending on how you're perceived.

01:21:03.945 --> 01:21:04.746
How shall I say it?

01:21:05.543 --> 01:21:08.724
your perceived role in the diagnosis of that patient.

01:21:08.844 --> 01:21:20.848
If your role in that patient from your training perspective is to follow a flow chart and an assumption chart, and one of those things on the assumption chart is now this PCR diagnostic, then you're done.

01:21:21.188 --> 01:21:21.969
You're just in it.

01:21:23.069 --> 01:21:26.510
And with regard to doctors working in hospitals, that's all you've got.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:33.012
Unless you're a private practice kind of doctor with your own set of patients, you're working for a hospital.

01:21:33.052 --> 01:21:34.513
You're working for a corporation.

01:21:35.697 --> 01:21:37.218
And so you're following protocols.

01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:38.219
You don't get a choice.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:42.282
Fine.

01:21:42.302 --> 01:21:46.946
Now, I think there will be some, you know, you're old enough that you're before a certain day that that will count for someone like you.

01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:52.971
But, you know, a young pup like myself to somehow get my vaccine records if I want to go visit Honduras.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:56.774
So according to the secretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Honduran

01:21:57.154 --> 01:22:01.638
Authorities are requiring documentation to show proof of life was published in the journal OBGYN.

01:22:02.298 --> 01:22:08.564
And this is a cohort study among pregnant individuals enrolled in Kaiser Permanente's Northern California KPNC and their infants.

01:22:09.284 --> 01:22:15.690
They followed all infants from birth until the first occurrence of a PCR result positive for flu or the infants reach six months, right?

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:17.911
So we're looking at looking at little kids for six months.

01:22:17.931 --> 01:22:19.673
They're not eligible for flu vaccination yet.

01:22:19.973 --> 01:22:23.056
So this is where if mom gets vaccinated, she might protect the little kids.

01:22:23.696 --> 01:22:32.544
They compared the hazard of getting flu in infants whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy compared to those mothers who did not get vaccinated and did not potentially provide this protection to their children.

01:22:32.964 --> 01:22:38.689
So 245,498 infants included in the study, 46% were born to vaccinated moms, about half there.

01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:41.151
The incidence of influenza was lower among infants.

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:43.792
And so they looked at nothing else but influenza.

01:22:43.812 --> 01:22:45.373
You see how ridiculous it is?

01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:46.014
This is fun.

01:22:46.314 --> 01:22:47.795
I'm going to play the end of this video.

01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:50.676
Linnea writes, long time Twiv listener from Alberta, Canada.

01:22:50.756 --> 01:22:54.218
Really appreciate your work explaining the lies about vaccines being spread by the current administration.

01:22:54.378 --> 01:22:59.501
Because they have spread to Canada, the Alberta provincial government has decided to become inspired by the RFK Jr.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:00.642
recommendations for COVID vaccines.

01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:05.165
And now COVID vaccines are no longer going to be free for most people, including health care workers, as of August.

01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:08.386
In the press release, they included some quick facts to defend her decision.

01:23:08.726 --> 01:23:09.127
Listen to this.

01:23:09.187 --> 01:23:11.368
Recently, the Federal Drug Administration in the U.S.

01:23:11.448 --> 01:23:13.669
There's no such thing, right, as the federal drug.

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:15.050
It's the Food and Drug Administration.

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:17.151
Even Canadian officials can't get it right.

01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:20.433
Stop recommending COVID vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children.

01:23:20.733 --> 01:23:21.533
And back to Linnea.

01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:24.675
It's horrifying and appreciate your work dismantling the lies more than ever right now.

01:23:24.715 --> 01:23:32.679
Not sure how to manage the situation, but along with alarming amount of measles outbreaks, it's arrived here in Alberta and isn't going away anytime soon with our current anti-science provincial government.

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.129
Yeah, no, it's really disturbing.

01:23:35.169 --> 01:23:35.830
And it is challenging.

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.191
And we're going to keep communicating.

01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.112
We're going to keep walking through this.

01:23:38.132 --> 01:23:39.274
We're going to keep providing the facts.

01:23:40.335 --> 01:23:44.199
You know, there are the people out there that they know that these things are untrue.

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:47.302
But you can make a lot of money off getting someone to buy your nutraceuticals.

01:23:47.342 --> 01:23:53.008
You can get a lot of money getting that person selling nutraceuticals to pay you to get up on stage and say anti-science, anti-vaccine things.

01:23:53.048 --> 01:23:56.331
So fortunately, there's a multi-billion dollar industry driving this.

01:23:57.472 --> 01:24:03.888
We're not a multi-billion dollar industry where we're going to continue to stand firm to our oaths and our principles and keep communicating the actual information.

01:24:04.471 --> 01:24:05.492
And finally, supply rights.

01:24:05.972 --> 01:24:07.773
Been listening to you and the crew since mid-2019.

01:24:07.813 --> 01:24:08.294
Love it all.

01:24:08.734 --> 01:24:10.635
Question, when I started college, I had no vaccination records.

01:24:10.935 --> 01:24:14.878
I received a measles shot on December 9th, and then again on December 12th from the health clinic.

01:24:15.438 --> 01:24:15.819
Same year.

01:24:16.859 --> 01:24:17.680
Based on everything I've heard.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.660
Three days later, right, Dan?

01:24:18.681 --> 01:24:20.101
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out, was it the same one?

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:20.682
What's the story?

01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:23.604
This doesn't follow any kind of recommended cases.

01:24:23.764 --> 01:24:34.131
They're joking about a college student who was coerced by his health center at the university to take an MMR shot, but then he took it twice.

01:24:35.928 --> 01:24:36.848
three days apart.

01:24:39.429 --> 01:24:59.495
We are letting our children go back to universities where this is happening all over our country, where the health regulations of university are determined by shitheads like this, who are completely on narrative and only opposed by shitheads like Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who can be laughed at by these people.

01:25:04.454 --> 01:25:06.555
Beta cells had a chance to mature between shots.

01:25:06.575 --> 01:25:09.375
I don't know what the beta cells, the B cells.

01:25:09.676 --> 01:25:11.816
It seems like I should get another one, but it has been 11 years.

01:25:12.576 --> 01:25:13.497
Already missing Dixon.

01:25:13.517 --> 01:25:15.717
Going back to listen to all his jazz recommendations here.

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:17.118
Two dose series, at least four weeks apart.

01:25:17.678 --> 01:25:18.318
Oh, I can't deal.

01:25:18.498 --> 01:25:19.639
I can't deal with that anymore.

01:25:19.659 --> 01:25:20.839
We're going to get rid of that one.

01:25:20.899 --> 01:25:22.759
You should actually figure out what that vaccine was.

01:25:22.979 --> 01:25:24.200
OK, so it's the measles in three days.

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.341
We're going to get rid of that one and we're going to move on.

01:25:27.961 --> 01:25:30.102
And so I'm trying to make this point clear, right?

01:25:30.202 --> 01:25:30.782
I really,

01:25:31.582 --> 01:25:37.069
I really think it's worth spending time understanding that these people are all scripted frauds.

01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:39.813
They're all scripted frauds.

01:25:39.853 --> 01:25:48.764
There's no reason to consider them in any other way other than as scripted frauds, just like Robert Malone is a scripted fraud.

01:25:52.623 --> 01:25:54.746
And there's no other way to describe him.

01:25:54.826 --> 01:25:56.148
He is a scripted fraud.

01:25:57.229 --> 01:26:04.438
His claim that he was used to spread lies is just ridiculous, but he's actually the coordinator of these lies.

01:26:04.599 --> 01:26:09.265
I do not make this accusation lightly that he is one of the worst Americans alive.

01:26:10.444 --> 01:26:20.051
And I do not make the accusation lightly about Sasha Latapova or Jessica Hockett or the foreigners, Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson.

01:26:20.131 --> 01:26:22.733
These are some of the worst frauds on the internet.

01:26:24.034 --> 01:26:40.005
These people should be ashamed of themselves, but they're so happy with the fame and fortune that they get from this grift that they're fine with it because they know something else is coming in the future and they know they're positioning themselves and their family better than they would have otherwise be positioned.

01:26:44.102 --> 01:26:47.844
I don't think this guy's very smart, but he definitely likes being in front of a camera.

01:26:47.884 --> 01:26:49.324
He likes to have fancy suits.

01:26:49.364 --> 01:26:51.805
He likes to have the staff and be the star.

01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:53.886
And so he's easy to use too.

01:26:56.567 --> 01:27:00.709
But these are seriously scripted bullshitters on a bullshit script.

01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:03.150
That's why I have these pictures.

01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:04.611
I chased them all down.

01:27:05.351 --> 01:27:12.334
I tried to teach them all this simple biology and they all ran away, including our health and human services secretary right here.

01:27:14.918 --> 01:27:17.941
Including this guy, Aseem Malhotra.

01:27:17.981 --> 01:27:21.625
Including this guy, Paul Alexander, who came to my house.

01:27:21.665 --> 01:27:23.046
That picture's in my house.

01:27:24.508 --> 01:27:26.450
Including this guy who came to Pittsburgh.

01:27:28.692 --> 01:27:33.777
Including this guy that I saw at a CHD thing and he couldn't barely stand to take a picture with me.

01:27:34.357 --> 01:27:36.700
Including this guy, too, at a CHD thing.

01:27:38.857 --> 01:27:40.319
And yeah, I've lost a lot of people.

01:27:40.399 --> 01:27:45.026
One of the most important to me is my best friend, Nathan.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.471
But you know, I got lots of pictures with this dude.

01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:51.876
And that's not by accident.

01:27:54.079 --> 01:28:01.748
They thought that the way that they could control me would be by recruiting me to be part of that Wuhan cover-up book, the lab leak thing.

01:28:01.788 --> 01:28:07.614
And that's why in the introduction, when you listen to the introduction that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:28:07.654 --> 01:28:15.443
gives to me in the presence of Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Tess Laurie, and Jessica Rose, that introduction is flattery.

01:28:18.194 --> 01:28:25.899
And it is a script where, you know, I spoke out about the intelligence agencies and their role in gain-of-function science, as we call it.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.600
That's scripted bullshit.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:36.325
They're trying to inflate my ego and to make me sort of put the t-shirt on that says, yeah, it was a lab leak and I'm the one who figured it out.

01:28:36.445 --> 01:28:37.826
I'm a drastic guy.

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:40.939
That's what they desperately wanted.

01:28:40.999 --> 01:28:43.441
That's why that my name is in the book like that.

01:28:43.521 --> 01:28:45.524
That's why the quotes are in the book like that.

01:28:45.564 --> 01:28:47.886
And what I'm telling you was, is that it failed.

01:28:48.607 --> 01:28:55.815
The bullshit script failed at a crucial time when they actually put all their eggs in that basket and left me in the book.

01:28:57.284 --> 01:29:01.125
And it went to print and it now exists and they can't change it anymore.

01:29:01.205 --> 01:29:06.087
Even though I'm telling you that book is bullshit and they knew it before they published it.

01:29:06.627 --> 01:29:11.949
And the people that are listed in the acknowledgements page of that book know it's bullshit because I taught them all.

01:29:13.409 --> 01:29:14.730
So it's not just me.

01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:22.132
It's a bunch of people that are coordinating their lying and continuing to read the script provided by Robert Malone.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.201
That's why this is so important.

01:29:28.941 --> 01:29:30.802
What he says here is damning.

01:29:31.722 --> 01:29:36.564
This is not an introduction of some biologist who got, who figured out the clones.

01:29:36.664 --> 01:29:38.985
Society to biology to science.

01:29:40.066 --> 01:29:44.807
And to look at my eyes, the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:29:45.688 --> 01:29:46.308
Listen to this.

01:29:46.388 --> 01:29:49.169
Each of us is incredible preeminent.

01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:55.933
that we have each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment on his thesis.

01:29:56.213 --> 01:30:02.354
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

01:30:02.394 --> 01:30:07.955
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

01:30:08.655 --> 01:30:16.937
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

01:30:18.457 --> 01:30:37.202
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in... Look at all those sponsorships of all those places that all those people are making money from, Substack, making money from promoting themselves, selling their supplements, going on their shows, touring the world as part of the COVID Summit show.

01:30:39.782 --> 01:30:46.984
As soon as I figured it out, all of those people left me behind, fired me, started ignoring me.

01:30:48.123 --> 01:30:49.844
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:49.884 --> 01:31:00.993
I don't think is smart enough or sophisticated enough to understand how all these people are coordinating their effort to obfuscate what I've taught him and what I offer as a way out.

01:31:01.973 --> 01:31:07.878
How I expose the no virus people as the same fraud as Mary Holland, but he doesn't, he can't take that.

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.242
He never wanted a part of this vaccine thing in the first place.

01:31:13.322 --> 01:31:21.187
In understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

01:31:22.508 --> 01:31:38.798
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.365
what we call gain-of-function science.

01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.770
There you have it.

01:31:45.372 --> 01:31:46.975
And Tess Laurie pushes ivermectin.

01:31:46.995 --> 01:31:50.062
What you're told by people who have vested interests.

01:31:50.692 --> 01:31:52.513
in reducing global population.

01:31:53.154 --> 01:32:02.579
The other thing that concerns me at the moment is the, well, I think things like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere being used as modalities.

01:32:02.739 --> 01:32:12.005
Now what I'm suggesting to you is that this man is essentially guilty of some crime and participating in the exact same scripted illusion that

01:32:13.016 --> 01:32:18.799
that Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone make possible in America.

01:32:19.419 --> 01:32:22.040
He is the other side of, he's with Aseem Malhotra.

01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:28.803
This guy is with all of them and this guy is one of the worst people in the UK.

01:32:28.903 --> 01:32:37.047
He is a fraud and he's responsible for so many people having taken AstraZeneca and so many people having taken the mRNA.

01:32:37.167 --> 01:32:39.908
He should be off the internet and ashamed of himself.

01:32:40.862 --> 01:32:43.163
But here he is talking about depopulation.

01:32:43.203 --> 01:32:51.465
Now it's impossible for him not to have known that since the end of World War II, these people have been working to reduce family size.

01:32:51.505 --> 01:32:56.607
It's impossible for him not to know that people only live to be about a hundred.

01:32:56.747 --> 01:32:58.388
And so it's a hundred year thing.

01:32:58.428 --> 01:33:05.290
You know, you don't need to worry about the population getting out of control if you've changed the size of families.

01:33:06.246 --> 01:33:07.927
and they were successful in doing that.

01:33:08.347 --> 01:33:24.835
There's no way that that guy doesn't know about the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality codified in the population pyramid, visible in this simple graph, and how it could be sculpted using manslaughter and lies to create the illusion of a pandemic.

01:33:24.895 --> 01:33:29.558
It's impossible that they don't see that that signal is not natural.

01:33:30.745 --> 01:33:37.451
And it's impossible that they don't understand that that was a problem incoming for decades, unless they're willfully ignorant.

01:33:37.471 --> 01:33:38.612
They're just, they don't care.

01:33:41.895 --> 01:33:44.136
That's why none of these people have come up with a list.

01:33:44.217 --> 01:33:46.378
That's why none of these people have come up with a list.

01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:47.840
That's why this is fraudulent.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.743
Billions of dollars of revenue for the pharmaceutical industry.

01:33:52.563 --> 01:33:54.524
So there's big money at stake here.

01:33:54.584 --> 01:33:56.145
There's big policy at stake.

01:33:56.465 --> 01:34:05.909
Recently, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, met for the first time after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:08.711
replaced its entire membership with new picks.

01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:16.995
In this episode, I'm sitting down with two new ACIP members, Dr. Robert Malone and MIT Professor Retsef Levy for a deep- Now remember,

01:34:20.962 --> 01:34:27.007
This guy of Epoch Times has had Sasha Latipova on twice.

01:34:27.027 --> 01:34:35.954
The context of vaccines is that debate was considered as confusing to patients, as something that we should avoid.

01:34:37.175 --> 01:34:45.081
Redsef Levy is basically a guy who had never had any skepticism in vaccines and is willing to have extra skepticism about the new vaccines.

01:34:45.141 --> 01:34:46.322
And so he's playing a role.

01:34:46.742 --> 01:34:47.703
He might be an idiot.

01:34:47.843 --> 01:34:48.523
It's possible.

01:34:49.746 --> 01:34:54.683
A lot of people have sent me emails to say that anybody that has as hair as long as you is an idiot.

01:34:55.838 --> 01:34:57.500
So, you know, I mean, maybe he's an idiot.

01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.140
I don't know.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.923
But I got to say, I think he's a useful stooge.

01:35:01.983 --> 01:35:09.730
I think he's on the same script and is happy to be on that script because he's not actually questioning anything except for the new shot.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:11.651
You know, like COVID shots are bad.

01:35:11.711 --> 01:35:12.912
Don't talk about 2020.

01:35:13.613 --> 01:35:22.920
Some key discussions during the recent meeting for mercury and the flu vaccine to RSV shots for children and what may happen with this committee moving forward.

01:35:23.741 --> 01:35:25.724
Okay, so it gets worse right it gets worse.

01:35:25.764 --> 01:35:27.687
I told you they're gonna use it against us.

01:35:27.747 --> 01:35:33.434
They have set us up And Paul Offit is gonna bring it to us from micro TV.

01:35:33.514 --> 01:35:39.102
This is beyond the noise episode number 72 recorded on June 30th 2025

01:35:47.227 --> 01:35:51.069
I'm Vincent Racaniello and joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:52.150
Hi, Vincent.

01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:53.411
Hello, Paul.

01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:54.091
Welcome back.

01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:58.534
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack.

01:35:58.974 --> 01:36:04.697
So you just pause it here and you can see that he gets like 300, 400 restacks.

01:36:04.837 --> 01:36:06.658
He gets hundreds of likes.

01:36:06.758 --> 01:36:08.800
There's a thousand comments.

01:36:09.935 --> 01:36:14.798
So Substack is weaponized against us on all sides of the equation.

01:36:14.858 --> 01:36:21.942
Everybody that uses it is being bamboozled just in the same way that everybody that uses Twig X is being bamboozled.

01:36:22.742 --> 01:36:30.686
And it's very easy for everybody to accept that Facebook kind of does it too, but not really unless you're trying to buy stuff, but it's all the same.

01:36:30.827 --> 01:36:32.427
It's all weaponized against us.

01:36:32.828 --> 01:36:36.590
There is no spontaneous virality of good ideas.

01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:38.691
There is only censorship and control.

01:36:40.572 --> 01:36:44.953
called Beyond the Noise, cutting to the chase on important health topics.

01:36:44.973 --> 01:36:50.735
Today we're gonna talk about Paul's latest column, The Irony of RFK Jr.'

01:36:50.715 --> 01:36:54.716
's Conflicts of Interest Gambit.

01:36:55.236 --> 01:37:00.858
So let's start by having you tell us why RFK Jr.

01:37:01.018 --> 01:37:04.919
fired all 17 members of the ACIP.

01:37:04.939 --> 01:37:06.040
You can tell us what that means.

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:24.095
Right, so the ACIP or Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices is an advisory committee to the CDC that primarily focuses on- I just want you to see that it's impossible that we're here where we're arguing about RFK with Paul Offit unless it's orchestrated and in fact it is.

01:37:24.715 --> 01:37:29.860
It is a national security military organization orchestrated

01:37:31.454 --> 01:37:38.477
PSYOP and I don't like the word PSYOP because you know Robert Malone's an expert in them because he's part of the same thing.

01:37:39.237 --> 01:37:42.539
That's why he says these chaos agents you're almost certainly interacting.

01:37:42.619 --> 01:37:43.579
He is that.

01:37:43.739 --> 01:37:46.100
He is the one of the coordinators of them.

01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:58.506
And once you see that this guy has a coordinated narrative that doesn't even really need to be updated because he understands it as exactly as he's needed to understand it.

01:38:00.506 --> 01:38:04.607
Just like Kevin McCurden understands it exactly as he needed to understand it.

01:38:04.627 --> 01:38:09.369
Just like Kevin McCairn at the beginning of the pandemic understood it exactly as he needed to understand it.

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:12.450
Spike protein, amyloid, cardiac stuff.

01:38:13.431 --> 01:38:17.812
Jessica Rose understood it exactly as she needed to understand it at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:38:17.832 --> 01:38:20.033
Vares, Vares, Vares, Epigirl, Vares.

01:38:22.014 --> 01:38:41.710
And this guy has understood it very well ever since he started working at the Vaccine Information Center at CHOP, and ever since he was recruited to be opposite of Mary Holland in this ongoing theater that started around 2015, when Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:51.498
and Suzanne Humphreys and all of these people were recruited to get in front of Brandy Vaughn and get in front of Tony Bark and eventually take their place when they were killed.

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:57.170
So this scripted bullshit is happening right now.

01:38:58.330 --> 01:39:02.273
Sometimes we have to pivot along the journey, but it's good to have goals.

01:39:03.253 --> 01:39:18.023
When we had a goal of rolling out AI for our scientific reviewers and staff agency-wide by June 30th, after a very successful pilot, we hit that goal ahead of schedule and under budget.

01:39:18.763 --> 01:39:19.743
It's good to have goals.

01:39:20.323 --> 01:39:29.145
And so one of our biggest goals is to reduce animal testing in a way that's meaningful and continues to protect against public safety.

01:39:31.446 --> 01:39:38.027
So with that, so one of the things he said in his opening remarks was that God didn't put us on the earth to torture animals.

01:39:40.588 --> 01:39:42.488
It was in the first five minutes of that talk.

01:39:44.764 --> 01:39:47.365
And so again, he's playing us against each other.

01:39:47.465 --> 01:39:58.850
He's playing the same shitty narratives that they, it is so malevolent right now that this foreigner and that foreigner and all these other foreigners are in front of us saying this scripted bullshit, but that's where we are.

01:40:01.011 --> 01:40:07.198
None of them are ever going to say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:40:07.258 --> 01:40:11.382
None of them are ever going to explain to you that transfection in healthy humans is always dangerous.

01:40:11.902 --> 01:40:21.693
And none of them are going to explain to you what I might mean by viruses are not pattern integrities or that RNA cannot pandemic because these are the foundational myths that cannot be questioned.

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:25.631
There is a way out.

01:40:25.671 --> 01:40:32.297
The PrEP Act is unconstitutional because it allows the suspension of fundamental rights without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

01:40:32.337 --> 01:40:34.700
And all these people won't say it because they're liars.

01:40:36.541 --> 01:40:39.865
Virology is a fraud, but just like PCR, it's not fake.

01:40:40.045 --> 01:40:40.605
It works.

01:40:40.766 --> 01:40:46.071
But there are different ways to do it, and virology is done mostly through transfection and transformation.

01:40:47.506 --> 01:40:56.612
and the vast background of genetic signals is actually bacterial, and that's the illusion that they are casting over all of our children as we teach this stupid shit to them.

01:40:58.413 --> 01:41:09.159
RNA is a class of molecule that doesn't qualify for this wonderful possibility of pandemicking, because it's single-stranded, because it doesn't have proofreading, and because it's unstable.

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:12.681
And so, this is a lie.

01:41:13.282 --> 01:41:15.283
At the foundation of this is a lie.

01:41:18.815 --> 01:41:41.670
I would caution you to understand that the use of PCR as a diagnostic is one of the things they needed because it has established a remnant stream that they can now use to sequence us over and over again and do whatever they want, basically create any health emergency that they need to using this false methodology, this assumption that this is a gold standard, which it definitely is not.

01:41:42.811 --> 01:41:46.716
Instead, what's really the truth is that the FDA should evaluate every

01:41:47.483 --> 01:42:00.808
PCR product that came out from 2020 and show us that it was indeed a medical device with fidelity, which it won't be, and also demonstrate that the current ones on the market are not high-fidelity diagnostics.

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:14.694
But instead, they're focusing on getting rid of animal testing, getting rid of these barriers to bringing things to market quicker, and getting rid of these barriers to have people in desperate situations be able to use whatever they want.

01:42:15.294 --> 01:42:18.475
I'm all in the way of kind of making the FDA irrelevant.

01:42:18.515 --> 01:42:19.816
And that's not by accident.

01:42:20.256 --> 01:42:27.278
It's part of the pivot that the Human Genome Project would require to make us from sovereign individuals to experimental animals.

01:42:27.339 --> 01:42:32.841
Because indeed, it's a national priority to have this genetic and medical data of Americans.

01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:36.122
We are not going to have this much data available ever again.

01:42:36.762 --> 01:42:37.922
And so it needs to be.

01:42:37.982 --> 01:42:41.724
It's a priority, a multi-generational priority for humanity.

01:42:42.364 --> 01:42:52.009
for the species, that this data be collected, that the infrastructure to collect the data be built, that the machine learning algorithms to interpret the data be developed.

01:42:52.089 --> 01:42:58.532
This is all a national security priority that sits parallel with and continuous with the Human Genome Project.

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:09.518
And that's the reason why Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan were involved in the narrative space since the very beginning, because this is a scripted part of the Human Genome Project, again, to invert our sovereignty

01:43:10.058 --> 01:43:11.960
to experimental animal status.

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:12.621
That is it.

01:43:12.841 --> 01:43:17.806
That's the real truth, Ruth, as far as I can say it.

01:43:18.466 --> 01:43:19.667
The best that I can say it.

01:43:19.727 --> 01:43:20.368
Where are you?

01:43:20.448 --> 01:43:22.430
There you are, you silly little boy.

01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:24.572
And so yeah, that's it.

01:43:25.613 --> 01:43:26.774
That's the best I can say it.

01:43:28.075 --> 01:43:31.879
The spread of bad ideas is definitely much scarier than the spread of any RNA molecule.

01:43:31.919 --> 01:43:32.880
I'll see you in a few minutes, huh?

01:44:33.272 --> 01:44:56.897
Ž Shine in your Japan Ž Ž Sparkle in your China Ž Ž Can you show me police supper police supper Ž Ž Go sell my house in town Ž Ž Police supper go sell my house in town Ž Ž And I'll be there shine in your Japan Ž Ž Sparkle in your China Ž Ž Yes I'll be there police supper police supper Ž Ž

01:46:46.701 --> 01:46:46.741
oh

01:49:13.283 --> 01:49:16.204
Yeah, I loved the statement in the chat.

01:49:16.304 --> 01:49:20.266
In my next life, I will be wise enough to attend this Steely Dan concert.

01:49:20.306 --> 01:49:24.047
If that's the way the next life works, then I want to be that wise as well.

01:49:24.067 --> 01:49:26.869
But I don't think you actually go back in time in your next life.

01:49:27.469 --> 01:49:31.611
Anyway, that's neither here nor there, or then or when.

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:33.952
This is Giga Home Biological.

01:49:34.032 --> 01:49:35.532
We're on the second half of the show.

01:49:35.572 --> 01:49:36.393
It's a little bit shorter.

01:49:37.493 --> 01:49:40.154
It's been a long one today, but it's a nice day in the background.

01:49:40.654 --> 01:49:41.535
My voice feels OK.

01:49:42.855 --> 01:49:52.585
I have been provided with the necessary liquids and so I'm gonna keep working Again, I don't I don't take this lightly saying that this is scripted bullshit.

01:49:52.665 --> 01:50:05.978
I don't take it very lightly to say that I think Suzanne Humphreys is standing in for the dead I really take it very seriously when I say that because I think Brandy Vaughn was murdered.

01:50:06.138 --> 01:50:06.959
I think Tony is

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:09.120
Bark was probably murdered.

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:21.823
And I think that this person is a traitor to our grandchildren because unlike her earlier self, when Brandy and Tony were still alive, she can no longer tell you the truth.

01:50:23.103 --> 01:50:27.384
She can go on Joe Rogan for two and a half hours and not tell you the truth.

01:50:27.704 --> 01:50:33.945
And it's a very simple truth that she used to be able to say that Brian Hooker used to be able to say.

01:50:35.029 --> 01:50:37.131
condition that we will not call autism.

01:50:37.271 --> 01:50:38.813
I don't like the word autism.

01:50:39.473 --> 01:50:40.775
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

01:50:41.115 --> 01:50:46.000
He was neurologically damaged, but condition condition that we will not call autism.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.681
I don't like the word autism.

01:50:48.342 --> 01:50:49.503
Um, he was vaccine damage.

01:50:49.683 --> 01:50:55.489
Now this is very significant because essentially what Brian is saying there is that he thinks autism is a myth.

01:50:55.629 --> 01:50:58.532
It's a myth used to cover up vaccine damaged.

01:51:00.563 --> 01:51:07.330
And now interestingly, the same video, the same incriminating evidence is right here with this woman.

01:51:08.792 --> 01:51:09.833
Now, why doesn't that run?

01:51:09.853 --> 01:51:09.913
Hmm.

01:51:13.177 --> 01:51:14.118
Oh yeah, it's not up there.

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:14.799
I see.

01:51:20.211 --> 01:51:23.836
My current opinion about vaccinations is that they have never been safe.

01:51:24.557 --> 01:51:26.200
Never has there been a safe vaccine.

01:51:26.821 --> 01:51:28.603
Never will there be a safe vaccine.

01:51:28.944 --> 01:51:31.227
And it is not possible to have a safe vaccine.

01:51:31.488 --> 01:51:34.792
Now, essentially what she's saying there is intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:51:35.553 --> 01:51:44.419
Or maybe in my better way of saying it is a intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:51.504
So essentially I agree with 2018 Suzanne Humphries just like I agree with 2013 Brian Hooker.

01:51:54.946 --> 01:52:03.392
But unfortunately this liar went on Joe Rogan in 2025 and couldn't say it that succinctly apparently because her opinion has changed.

01:52:04.226 --> 01:52:14.668
Her current opinion in 2018, when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive, was curiously similar to the opinion that Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn had.

01:52:15.308 --> 01:52:26.671
But as soon as Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn were dead, Brian Hooker and Suzanne Humphreys and Mary Holland started building the big top tent for health freedom with as many polls as they could find.

01:52:28.976 --> 01:52:37.162
The reasoning for that is that the actual process of vaccination defies the natural function of the immune system.

01:52:37.683 --> 01:52:40.845
Exactly what I've been saying for the last few years.

01:52:40.925 --> 01:52:51.273
And I'm very, very disappointed to have to bring you this message that these people, I was in Georgia when she was there working and on stage and you know,

01:52:52.398 --> 01:52:56.940
It's not like she reached out or Brian Hooker said you have to meet her or anything like that.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.260
It was the exact opposite.

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:04.082
Brian Hooker also never said I got to meet James Lyons-Weiler, even though James Lyons-Weiler was on stage.

01:53:05.682 --> 01:53:12.525
And next to Suzanne Humphreys on stage at CHD, their conference in Georgia.

01:53:12.705 --> 01:53:16.806
And Brian didn't think it was important for me to meet them or that they were very important.

01:53:16.906 --> 01:53:21.528
And I don't have any selfies with either of those two because they run away from me.

01:53:22.924 --> 01:53:33.210
They are part of this show that replaces Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark who were murdered in 2020 with these frauds.

01:53:34.952 --> 01:53:42.296
Listen to how fraudulent they are and remember what Paul Offit and Daniel Griffin talked about on TWIV.

01:53:45.001 --> 01:53:47.342
Listen, Bobby, I can't prove it tonight.

01:53:47.642 --> 01:53:48.622
You can't prove it.

01:53:48.662 --> 01:54:00.886
But intuitively, you look at the spike, you look at what happened with the Marisol, there is no doubt in my mind, maybe it's two years from now, maybe it's five years from now, maybe it's 10 years from now, we're going to find out that the Marisol

01:54:01.426 --> 01:54:20.408
causes in my opinion ought to know what that's not by accident that is the malevolence of this script because now we are being shown previous acts of the play as if they are representative of reality instead of an elaborate theater scripted over decades I know it's tough

01:54:21.445 --> 01:54:23.386
but you gotta be able to see it eventually.

01:54:23.446 --> 01:54:37.091
It's gotta be obvious eventually because otherwise we wouldn't still be talking about these same dumb issues and we would have gotten to the stage where somebody would have reasonably considered the possibility that all intramuscular injection might be nonsense.

01:54:38.592 --> 01:54:49.116
But the science is... So there's Joe Scarborough saying that vaccines cause autism because his kid has a form of it called Asperger's.

01:54:51.178 --> 01:55:02.441
So big news is that the CDC vaccine panel voted to take the mercury preservatives out of their flu shots.

01:55:02.701 --> 01:55:08.222
And so just to let you know what mercury is, because it's in your vaccine.

01:55:08.282 --> 01:55:09.622
And so who's he going to play?

01:55:09.682 --> 01:55:17.324
He's going to play 2025 Suzanne Humphreys, the scripted traitor on Robert Malone's shitty script.

01:55:18.184 --> 01:55:34.262
on joe rogan where she doesn't say that there are no safe vaccines that i don't think there are any say it can't be done because it's antithetical to our immune system in two and a half hours she never said it because she is a scripted traitor maybe she's got a gun to her head i don't know

01:55:35.384 --> 01:55:45.728
but it's time that somebody that has a gun to their head or, or has taken it farther than they initially wanted to start to grow a pair and fricking speak out as an American.

01:55:46.268 --> 01:55:47.829
You know, Ryan Cole could do it.

01:55:48.429 --> 01:55:50.109
Ryan Cole knows this is bullshit.

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:53.391
Suzanne Humphries could do it, but she, she's not going to do it.

01:55:53.471 --> 01:55:55.031
Obviously she has a gun to her head.

01:55:56.632 --> 01:55:58.533
There's lots of other people who could do it.

01:55:58.913 --> 01:56:04.715
Mary Talley Bowden could probably do it if she really wanted to, but apparently she's got enough money or a gun to her head.

01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:15.738
This is scary because this clown, super scripted clown, is now promoting the shittiest video of her career.

01:56:15.818 --> 01:56:26.143
Basically the worst video that exists of her on the internet is her interview on Joe Rogan where she essentially says nothing for two and a half hours.

01:56:26.903 --> 01:56:28.724
Scenes, and not good.

01:56:29.284 --> 01:56:30.045
And how not good?

01:56:30.065 --> 01:56:30.445
Well here.

01:56:31.727 --> 01:56:32.407
Here, let's find out.

01:56:47.757 --> 01:57:06.953
is that vaccines, while it might look like just a clear liquid, in order to make a vaccine, you have to have either a cow that you put ulcers on and scrape the pus off, or you can evolve it as it had evolved to maybe getting some tumorous cells that came out of a cocker spaniel's kidney, or monkey balls, or monkey kidneys, and you plate those cells out, and then you inoculate it with what you want to grow to put in your vaccine later.

01:57:07.233 --> 01:57:13.875
But in order to keep those cells alive, you have to put animal blood on it, you have to put different nutrients on top of it, you have to put antibiotics, kanamycin, you know, things like that related to the COVID.

01:57:14.355 --> 01:57:14.855
Here, mercury.

01:57:14.935 --> 01:57:24.637
Okay, so in the end, you can kill, you can make sure when you have your final product that if you put a little bit of mercury in there, that it's less likely for any of the fungus or the spores or the bacteria or the adventitious viruses that you didn't know about that were there before will be in your final product.

01:57:24.878 --> 01:57:25.218
Wonderful.

01:57:25.418 --> 01:57:26.518
So you have a product now that you can

01:57:26.858 --> 01:57:30.141
It's almost like you could make one if you weren't so careless.

01:57:30.161 --> 01:57:34.325
You could make a good vaccine, but they just use shitty stuff because they're shitty people.

01:57:34.365 --> 01:57:37.648
But if we had good people making good vaccines, the good vaccines would be good.

01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:49.418
Instead of saying what she said in 2018 when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were alive, which is that she doesn't think there are any safe vaccines, she doesn't think it can be done.

01:57:52.121 --> 01:57:52.802
Stop lying!

01:57:56.559 --> 01:58:07.385
not completely sure has any of these deadly microbes, but now has mercury, which the only places it's actually okay to have on the planet, mercury, is in vaccines, your tooth, or a toxic landfill.

01:58:07.405 --> 01:58:13.649
So if you were to drop a vaccine at a vaccine clinic onto the floor, the hazmat guys would come, and you're not allowed to just pick it up if it's a mercury-containing vaccine.

01:58:13.889 --> 01:58:15.190
Hazmat people have to come and take that away.

01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:16.971
Yet we're okay to take a portion of it.

01:58:16.991 --> 01:58:19.772
But there are no mercury-containing vaccines anymore.

01:58:19.812 --> 01:58:24.275
We already heard that from both Paul Offit and Vincent Racaniello and

01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:49.348
Daniel Griffin the only only ones were in some quadrivalent flu vaccines So is she does she just dumb is she just not done any reading since 2013 when her book came out She just said forget it She hasn't tried to advance anything because she's still selling that book So she doesn't want to contradict her book or advance her book or you know She doesn't want to be bothered to write another book.

01:58:49.868 --> 01:58:52.029
So what the hell I'll just stick to it.

01:58:52.289 --> 01:58:53.270
What is this shit?

01:58:54.815 --> 01:59:06.063
And think, remember, this jackass doesn't care, apparently, that Americans were murdered for a couple years in order to coerce him into taking the vaccine.

01:59:06.443 --> 01:59:10.065
He doesn't give a shit at all, even though he knows it's true, because I've told him.

01:59:11.866 --> 01:59:24.515
I saw him in person in Pittsburgh when he brought his comedy troupe to Pittsburgh, and we saw him in person and took a picture with him in person, and I gave him a book that was annotated with a letter and phone, and it's remarkable.

01:59:26.024 --> 01:59:37.054
He is awful, but no more awful than Shannon Joy, no more awful than they're just all useful idiots, performers with SAG cards.

01:59:38.756 --> 01:59:42.539
Now that violin injected into, you know, a child, a three-month-old child, how does that work?

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:44.221
It doesn't sound logical.

01:59:44.541 --> 01:59:46.363
It doesn't sound logical.

01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:48.871
So let me bring in Mary Holland.

01:59:48.971 --> 02:00:00.176
She's author speaker and CEO of the children's health defense and organization focused on legal strategies to defend children's health and obtain justice for those injured before joining the children.

02:00:00.316 --> 02:00:01.697
That's an interesting statement.

02:00:01.717 --> 02:00:02.757
I've never heard before.

02:00:03.017 --> 02:00:06.219
Focused on legal strategy.

02:00:06.959 --> 02:00:07.499
Wow.

02:00:07.579 --> 02:00:10.961
That is some seriously, seriously fraudulent shit.

02:00:11.294 --> 02:00:12.294
health defense in 2019.

02:00:12.734 --> 02:00:19.256
She taught at NYU School of Law for 17 years and lectured at Columbia Law School on international human rights advocacy.

02:00:19.276 --> 02:00:21.176
Welcome back to the show, Mary Holland.

02:00:21.196 --> 02:00:21.696
Hi, Mary.

02:00:22.696 --> 02:00:24.857
International human rights advocacy.

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:26.297
I'm going to escape out of here.

02:00:26.317 --> 02:00:27.217
This is crashing.

02:00:28.138 --> 02:00:28.458
Demon.

02:00:29.918 --> 02:00:32.679
International rights, human rights advocate.

02:00:33.179 --> 02:00:38.400
I think that would set off a huge red flag for my friend Joe Marshall at the Liberty Perspective.

02:00:40.049 --> 02:00:41.410
That's not a patriotic thing.

02:00:55.779 --> 02:01:03.427
the CEO of the Children's Health Defense, an organization focused on legal strategies to defend children's health and obtain justice for those injured.

02:01:03.808 --> 02:01:13.838
Before joining the Children's Health Defense in 2019, she taught at NYU School of Law for 17 years and lectured at Columbia Law School on international human rights advocacy.

02:01:13.878 --> 02:01:15.781
Welcome back to the show, Mary Holland.

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:16.281
Hi, Mary.

02:01:17.122 --> 02:01:17.743
Great to be here.

02:01:18.294 --> 02:01:21.019
So this is a big deal, right, that they're getting.

02:01:21.279 --> 02:01:26.749
So now they had taken the mercury out of most of the flu shots, but there was still in some of them.

02:01:26.809 --> 02:01:28.753
Why would they take it out of most but not all of them?

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:29.940
Exactly.

02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:37.842
So they took it out as a preservative in 2001, except in the flu shots, in multi-dose vials.

02:01:37.922 --> 02:01:44.704
And as Suzanne Humphreys were just explaining, you know, to kill bacteria, because they'd open it and give one dose, but they'd still have two.

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:48.685
It's not by accident that she knows Suzanne Humphreys' name.

02:01:49.045 --> 02:01:50.845
It's not by accident that she said it.

02:01:50.865 --> 02:01:52.026
This is a script.

02:01:52.166 --> 02:01:53.066
It's a performance.

02:01:53.746 --> 02:01:55.606
And they have it on a little sheet.

02:01:55.686 --> 02:01:57.627
They know what they're going to say and where they're going to go.

02:01:58.695 --> 02:01:59.956
two or three more doses to give.

02:02:00.597 --> 02:02:07.023
At this point, it was down to 3%, but it wasn't 3% from 2001 until now.

02:02:07.183 --> 02:02:10.346
It went down gradually, the amount of mercury being taken out.

02:02:10.446 --> 02:02:15.431
And this is a 30-year battle, Jimmy, that's now been ended, which is fantastic.

02:02:15.591 --> 02:02:19.755
Mercury should never have been in vaccines, I think, as you can appreciate from what was just said.

02:02:20.095 --> 02:02:23.779
It's an incredibly toxic substance, and we were injecting it into

02:02:24.244 --> 02:02:28.769
you know, infants, day-old babies in the hepatitis B shot before they took it out.

02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:34.356
And so, the mercury in the vaccines, it's called thimerosal, correct?

02:02:35.103 --> 02:02:35.323
Right.

02:02:35.403 --> 02:02:36.644
It's called thimerosal.

02:02:36.744 --> 02:02:40.525
It's half ethyl mercury by weight.

02:02:40.605 --> 02:02:47.248
So 50% of thimerosal, it's made by Lilly, was never properly tested, and it started to be used.

02:02:47.388 --> 02:02:56.592
And literally what some of the people at the CDC acknowledged was they just never added up the cumulative amount of mercury that these kids were getting in the various shots.

02:02:57.112 --> 02:03:05.219
After 1986, when Congress gave a liability shield, the number of vaccines escalated dramatically, and a lot of them contain mercury.

02:03:05.239 --> 02:03:06.540
They also contain aluminum.

02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:09.162
There's a synergistic effect between mercury and aluminum.

02:03:09.723 --> 02:03:16.008
And a lot of neurological injuries went along with this rise of the use and the number of vaccines.

02:03:16.698 --> 02:03:22.943
And I remember a time when cable news hosts used to thank RFK Jr.

02:03:23.523 --> 02:03:30.108
for fighting this to try to get mercury out of vaccines and specifically thimerosal.

02:03:30.148 --> 02:03:31.849
In fact, here's a video.

02:03:31.869 --> 02:03:34.371
This is going to be a little loud, so bring it down a little bit.

02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:36.833
Here is RFK Jr.

02:03:37.253 --> 02:03:42.637
speaking with Joe Scarborough when he hosted a show called Scarborough Country on MSNBC.

02:03:42.677 --> 02:03:43.237
Let's watch.

02:03:43.617 --> 02:03:45.099
My son born in 1991.

02:03:47.229 --> 02:04:02.258
has a slight form of autism called Asperger's, but it seems, and again, when I was practicing law and also when I was in Congress, parents would constantly come to me and they'd bring me videotapes of their children and they were all around the age of my son or younger.

02:04:02.538 --> 02:04:05.340
So something happened in 1989.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.041
So you believe that Scarborough's not lying there?

02:04:08.062 --> 02:04:13.785
That people came, people bringing me videos and pictures of their kid, come on.

02:04:14.185 --> 02:04:14.886
Come on!

02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:36.284
Nobody bothered to do an analysis of what the cumulative impact of all that mercury was doing to kids.

02:04:36.645 --> 02:04:44.150
As it turns out, we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of mercury that FDA or EPA considers safe.

02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:49.334
A child, on his first day that he's born, is injected with a hepatitis B shot.

02:04:50.611 --> 02:04:56.056
under EPA guidelines, he would have to be 275 pounds to safely absorb that.

02:04:56.096 --> 02:04:59.538
Now they are repeating this argument right now with aluminum.

02:04:59.578 --> 02:05:02.280
They're repeating it all the time in all these different ways.

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:03.361
It's really absurd.

02:05:04.502 --> 02:05:06.624
I think the chickens just caught a snake or something.

02:05:06.644 --> 02:05:07.665
They're all freaking out.

02:05:07.785 --> 02:05:08.886
Whoa, that's some...

02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:12.092
Velociraptor style sprinting there.

02:05:12.552 --> 02:05:17.516
Anyway, this is all very malevolent and if you can see it, it will free you.

02:05:17.696 --> 02:05:30.365
If you can see the truth here that, you know, this is a willing, willing participant in this show because, you know, he makes a living doing it and this is a real big recruit.

02:05:30.585 --> 02:05:33.528
This is a guy who has been Truman showed for his whole life.

02:05:34.585 --> 02:05:38.750
Probably doesn't really believe what he's saying, but he knows that he's scripted to say it.

02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:43.415
And that's why his progress and understanding has been so little.

02:05:44.216 --> 02:05:50.764
Not that dissimilar from Mary Holland, not that dissimilar from Pauly Tommy, not that dissimilar from Brian Hooker, who knew a lot more.

02:05:51.545 --> 02:05:56.707
a long time ago, just like it seems that Suzanne Humphreys knew a lot more a long time ago.

02:05:57.167 --> 02:06:00.689
And yet we're just constantly pumping our kids with these vaccines.

02:06:00.729 --> 02:06:02.970
What happened was that in 1988, one in every 2,500 American children had autism.

02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:04.690
Today, one in every 166 children have autism.

02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:05.611
And now today it's one in 31.

02:06:18.927 --> 02:06:20.108
31.

02:06:19.087 --> 02:06:20.108
It's one in 31.

02:06:20.228 --> 02:06:23.589
It's one in 12 and a half boys, Jimmy, in California.

02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:28.652
And since there was this secret meeting about- But how many of those are profound autism?

02:06:28.712 --> 02:06:29.752
Is she going to tell us that?

02:06:29.792 --> 02:06:33.074
But then she's going to go back to the secret meeting and say it's black kids.

02:06:33.694 --> 02:06:41.658
And so the CDC was covering up the racist, racial biased of the vaccine shot.

02:06:41.698 --> 02:06:44.099
And so they're going to get us to tear each other apart.

02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.721
This is a traitor and a fraud.

02:06:49.261 --> 02:06:54.247
who has made no progress in more than two decades and should probably be in jail.

02:06:55.448 --> 02:06:59.272
She's one of the worst Americans alive and one of the biggest frauds on the internet.

02:07:00.333 --> 02:07:07.181
And I would put this guy into a similar category, but lacking the sheer, you know,

02:07:08.596 --> 02:07:14.778
unbelievable, overwhelming evidence of a two decade track record of failing.

02:07:15.158 --> 02:07:16.379
That guy doesn't have that.

02:07:16.559 --> 02:07:21.981
So he's got a three year track record of going along with it ever since I told him the truth.

02:07:22.061 --> 02:07:23.381
That's what he definitely has.

02:07:23.681 --> 02:07:27.963
And now more than ever, it's obvious because he just promotes who they send to him.

02:07:32.245 --> 02:07:34.866
What do we do about thimerosal back in 2000?

02:07:35.386 --> 02:07:37.967
We just did a retrospective on this 25 years later.

02:07:38.388 --> 02:07:42.689
You know, the increase in autism is 350% since 2000.

02:07:43.230 --> 02:07:48.212
So the CDC has been absolutely had its head in the sand.

02:07:49.072 --> 02:07:52.073
And so interesting to see that from MSNBC, Jimmy, right?

02:07:52.293 --> 02:07:58.296
After, for a lot of different reasons, MSNBC, you know, would now call that a conspiracy theory.

02:07:58.336 --> 02:07:58.436
Yes.

02:07:59.076 --> 02:08:00.977
And so he, watch this, it even gets better.

02:08:01.017 --> 02:08:02.337
There's a little bit more to this video.

02:08:02.357 --> 02:08:03.417
Okay, get ready, Chris.

02:08:03.717 --> 02:08:18.841
And plus, one in six children have other kinds of learning disorders, other kinds of neurological disorders, speech delay, language disorders, ADD, hyperactivity, that all seem to be connected, that are all connected, the science shows are all connected to autism.

02:08:18.861 --> 02:08:27.104
You know, Bobby, what we've always found, you and I could debate a thousand different issues, whether it's Terry Shiva or the environment, I think would agree on the environment.

02:08:28.344 --> 02:08:32.489
But in this case, you've got the federal government coming and saying, well, there's no good science.

02:08:32.509 --> 02:08:35.272
And of course, in politics, science always gets diluted.

02:08:35.713 --> 02:08:37.735
Why hasn't the federal government stepped up?

02:08:39.349 --> 02:08:58.903
And it worked more, because listen, Bobby, I can't prove it tonight, you can't prove it, but intuitively, you look at the spike, you look at what happened with the Marisol, there is no doubt in my mind, maybe it's two years from now, maybe it's five years from now, maybe it's ten years from now, we're going to find out that the Marisol causes, in my opinion, autism.

02:08:58.923 --> 02:09:00.184
You know what, the science is...

02:09:01.274 --> 02:09:16.782
So there's Joe Scarborough saying that vaccines cause autism because his kid has a form of it called Asperger's and it all exploded in 1989 when he would have hundreds and hundreds of parents coming with the same age

02:09:17.122 --> 02:09:22.047
And it all started in 1989, same age kids with these autism and Asperger's.

02:09:22.107 --> 02:09:31.978
And he's saying we're going to prove it, not today, not tomorrow, but someday, that this is caused by thimerosal, which is another way of saying it's being caused by the vaccines we're giving our children.

02:09:32.258 --> 02:09:34.000
That's what Joe Scarborough used to say.

02:09:35.081 --> 02:09:37.923
John Stewart used to thank RFK Jr.

02:09:37.983 --> 02:09:40.965
on behalf of the parents for doing this kind of work.

02:09:41.225 --> 02:09:51.791
That's all over because that was before Big Pharma completely controlled the narrative and now they fund Joe Scarborough to the tune of 70% of his paycheck.

02:09:52.511 --> 02:09:53.452
Take it where you want, Mary.

02:09:54.375 --> 02:09:56.216
Yeah, I take it where you want, Mary.

02:09:56.256 --> 02:09:58.956
We changed changed after Obamacare.

02:09:59.737 --> 02:10:04.318
You know, back in the early 2000s, this was not really a partisan issue.

02:10:04.378 --> 02:10:09.199
If anything, the Democratic Party was more favorable to this than the Republican.

02:10:09.279 --> 02:10:11.480
Now there's been a complete reversal on this.

02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:13.840
And unfortunately, it really is.

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.961
It's become a very partisan issue.

02:10:16.461 --> 02:10:22.983
And Bobby Kennedy is now serving in Donald Trump's administration in a Republican dominated administration.

02:10:23.698 --> 02:10:25.720
and really trying to get the science done.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:31.504
And what Bobby Kennedy has said, he's acknowledged this one in 31, this is federal data.

02:10:31.884 --> 02:10:35.727
And he's told us in his first press conference as secretary of HHS,

02:10:36.397 --> 02:10:39.078
that by September we would start to really understand.

02:10:39.098 --> 02:10:46.839
You can almost feel her holding back time by saying, you know, his first statement that he made five months ago was this.

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:49.880
And so we have to just trust in the progress of him.

02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:55.541
And, you know, it's a very, it's a very tenuous game that he plays with these political people now.

02:10:55.621 --> 02:10:58.821
And he's a Jedi master and we got him right where we want him now.

02:10:59.321 --> 02:11:01.882
And it's all a question of when he decides to do everything.

02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:04.951
He would give us some information about what the science says.

02:11:04.991 --> 02:11:18.956
And what he's trying to do right now is really analyze massive amounts of data that he has access to within HHS to prove, you know, what happens after a kid gets Hep B or Hiv or DPT or polio or MMR.

02:11:19.356 --> 02:11:23.978
What is the, you know, if you can show that with Medicaid records, you can show that with federal data.

02:11:25.103 --> 02:11:32.165
So I just want to, I'm going to show you how this corporate news covered this, them voting to take the mercury out of the flu vaccine.

02:11:32.466 --> 02:11:34.406
I'm going to wait, wait till you see how they cover it.

02:11:34.726 --> 02:11:38.688
But right before this, I'm going to show you a 10 second clip from Dr. John Campbell.

02:11:39.068 --> 02:11:43.009
He's going to give you a little information on the flu vaccine and how good it is.

02:11:43.249 --> 02:11:43.749
Let's listen.

02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:52.520
A large study at the Cleveland Clinic found out that the flu vaccine, the influenza vaccine over last winter, wasn't that effective.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.622
In fact, it had a negative efficacy.

02:11:55.223 --> 02:11:56.885
It's all one malevolent show.

02:11:57.734 --> 02:12:11.720
And John Campbell is on exactly the same team that CHD is on, the exact same team that Sasha Latapova is on, the exact same team that Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan are on, the exact same team that Heart and Panda are on.

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:17.742
It is all one malevolent show that even the frickin' Brownstone Institute is in on.

02:12:17.882 --> 02:12:19.363
It is an absolute

02:12:20.183 --> 02:12:22.505
travesty that more people cannot see it.

02:12:22.645 --> 02:12:27.950
It's so obvious to me, it makes me want to vomit every time I wake up in the morning and start to look at it.

02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:30.432
26.9 percent.

02:12:30.552 --> 02:12:39.640
In other words, if you took this flu vaccine, you were 26.9 percent more likely, more likely to get influenza.

02:12:41.661 --> 02:12:42.842
Okay, yippee.

02:12:42.902 --> 02:12:45.204
So that's their great flu vaccine.

02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:51.312
which the fact that they're allowed to use the term vaccine is mind-bending, right?

02:12:51.332 --> 02:12:51.832
Mind-bending.

02:12:51.912 --> 02:12:55.053
What does that mean that they're allowed to use the term vaccine?

02:12:55.113 --> 02:12:56.334
Why is that mind-bending?

02:12:56.354 --> 02:12:58.534
You don't even know what the term vaccine means.

02:12:58.995 --> 02:12:59.755
What does it mean?

02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:05.301
something that's safe to inject to augment your immune system, define one.

02:13:05.621 --> 02:13:09.563
You see, he's completely trapped in the semantics.

02:13:10.003 --> 02:13:15.504
He's using their words and thinking he's smart because he's rearranging them instead of redefining them.

02:13:15.544 --> 02:13:16.005
Do you see?

02:13:16.805 --> 02:13:17.425
It's a joke.

02:13:19.465 --> 02:13:26.069
because not only did last year's vaccine not prevent you from getting it, it made it more likely that you would get it.

02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.330
More likely.

02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:31.733
And this was a huge study, Jimmy, of all of the employees in the Cleveland Clinic.

02:13:31.813 --> 02:13:34.334
And, you know, it was some who took the shot and some who didn't.

02:13:34.915 --> 02:13:41.519
She's still not saving any American kids from the absurd schedule that the CDC recommends.

02:13:41.639 --> 02:13:43.680
She has not saved any kids.

02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:47.943
She has not made any parents aware that weren't already aware.

02:13:48.863 --> 02:13:51.205
And certainly not since the start of the pandemic.

02:13:51.245 --> 02:13:53.887
This is one of the most malevolent traders in America.

02:13:53.967 --> 02:13:59.031
Mary Holland is one of the worst and most malevolent traders in America.

02:13:59.071 --> 02:14:02.974
She is a fraud and she's been a fraud for about 20 years.

02:14:03.355 --> 02:14:05.376
This is really definitive information.

02:14:05.957 --> 02:14:10.480
And in a good year, Jimmy, these are only up to about 50% effective.

02:14:10.641 --> 02:14:13.603
And then you have all the risk of adverse events from the shots.

02:14:13.683 --> 02:14:16.345
So, you know, we just don't have this right yet.

02:14:16.405 --> 02:14:17.026
That's clear.

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.961
So here's how the corporate knew.

02:14:19.001 --> 02:14:20.283
Here's from CNBC.

02:14:20.723 --> 02:14:25.447
Here's how they covered the vote at the CDC to take mercury out of the vaccines.

02:14:26.148 --> 02:14:31.953
A revamped government panel of vaccine advisors with newly appointed immunization skeptics.

02:14:33.035 --> 02:14:39.079
has voted against a mercury-containing shot ingredient that the anti-vaccine movement has long targeted.

02:14:39.459 --> 02:15:00.113
The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted Thursday to recommend annual single-dose flu vaccines to Americans and against influenza shots containing thimerosal, mercury, even though there is no evidence of harm from that preservative.

02:15:00.233 --> 02:15:01.754
Did you just hear Joe Scarborough?

02:15:02.574 --> 02:15:02.954
Correct.

02:15:03.154 --> 02:15:03.354
Yeah.

02:15:03.534 --> 02:15:04.315
It's ridiculous.

02:15:04.595 --> 02:15:05.735
Injecting mercury.

02:15:05.755 --> 02:15:05.995
Sorry.

02:15:06.035 --> 02:15:06.355
Finish.

02:15:06.495 --> 02:15:06.716
Yeah.

02:15:07.076 --> 02:15:10.137
It was his first ACIP meeting since health.

02:15:10.217 --> 02:15:22.961
It was the first ACIP meeting since Health and Human Services Secretary RFK gutted the panel and stacked it with new members, including... So much of the brain damage is site inflammation, right?

02:15:23.001 --> 02:15:26.223
If you cause inflammation in the brain, it doesn't matter how you cause it.

02:15:26.363 --> 02:15:27.443
That's part of the problem.

02:15:27.723 --> 02:15:30.366
several well-known vaccine skeptics.

02:15:30.826 --> 02:15:35.250
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to sign off on the recommendation.

02:15:35.630 --> 02:15:40.154
If the agency does, it would affect roughly 4 to 5 percent of the U.S.

02:15:40.215 --> 02:15:41.476
flu vaccine supply.

02:15:42.276 --> 02:15:45.820
The rest, so that sounds like, oh well, that's not a big deal, right?

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.881
Well, listen to what they say.

02:15:47.441 --> 02:15:52.465
The rest of the nation's flu shots were thimerosal free during the last season of the virus.

02:15:52.725 --> 02:15:54.547
So why why can't you make that?

02:15:54.607 --> 02:15:55.668
So while they are doing it.

02:15:56.208 --> 02:16:01.632
But when it comes to vaccinating an entire country, quote, small percentages matter.

02:16:02.453 --> 02:16:09.879
Dr. O'Leary, Sean O'Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told he's in over his head.

02:16:09.919 --> 02:16:11.721
He doesn't know what point he's going to make here.

02:16:11.761 --> 02:16:13.242
It's probably going to fall on its face.

02:16:13.701 --> 02:16:18.505
reporters last week and I'm sure he's not being paid off at all by the big pharma industry.

02:16:19.106 --> 02:16:24.611
If the few if the few thimerosal containing flu shots were removed from the market

02:16:25.387 --> 02:16:44.594
that would inevitably lead to fewer people being vaccinated and it's a script you see he's supposed to feel like he's solving the puzzle and catching them in a contradiction so that mary can say yeah you caught him you're pretty smart but i've been fighting these guys for much longer than you so welcome to the show

02:16:46.027 --> 02:16:52.491
least in the short term, perhaps longer term, and subsequently more hospitalizations and death.

02:16:52.791 --> 02:16:58.335
I just showed you the biggest study ever showed you that the flu shot actually makes it more likely for you to get sick.

02:16:59.696 --> 02:17:06.960
The recommendation also, so this is just a liar, and I will guarantee you that this guy's getting money somewhere.

02:17:07.181 --> 02:17:10.643
This Dr. O'Leary is getting money somewhere to lie to you.

02:17:10.983 --> 02:17:15.206
And he's just unaware that he's getting money to lie to you from Rumble.

02:17:16.192 --> 02:17:18.313
He's just unaware that he's lying to you.

02:17:18.353 --> 02:17:19.893
That's all because he's an idiot.

02:17:25.395 --> 02:17:30.156
About mercury in vaccines and the efficacy of the flu vaccine in general.

02:17:31.136 --> 02:17:33.977
Because the efficacy of the flu vaccine, not good.

02:17:35.114 --> 02:17:44.516
The recommendation also reinforces long-standing, unfounded fears that the substance can lead to developmental disabilities such as autism.

02:17:44.736 --> 02:17:49.357
So they're saying that putting mercury into a baby is a good idea.

02:17:49.457 --> 02:17:50.837
That's what CNBC is saying.

02:17:51.077 --> 02:17:56.799
And that if you have a fear of putting mercury in a baby... Remember what the first video said that I showed you?

02:17:57.079 --> 02:17:58.739
That it's... He's just a useful idiot.

02:17:59.179 --> 02:18:15.354
he's just doing the useful idiot performance and uh that's the reason why you know he's full of shit um it's pretty remarkable containing vaccine you have to call a hazmat team to come kick it up but you can inject it into a baby and cnbc says you're nuts

02:18:16.115 --> 02:18:20.396
You're nuts if you think there's a problem with sticking mercury into a baby.

02:18:20.476 --> 02:18:24.897
Kennedy's vaccine skepticism comes full circle with the panel's vote.

02:18:25.257 --> 02:18:35.059
A decade before stepping into his current role, he published a book that called for the removal of thimerosal mercury from shots and linked it to developmental disorders.

02:18:35.439 --> 02:18:37.439
A very common- He wrote a book.

02:18:37.639 --> 02:18:39.280
Surprise, surprise, right?

02:18:40.285 --> 02:18:44.046
anti-vaccine talking point is around thimerosal.

02:18:44.266 --> 02:18:48.748
So that's a very clear strategy to sow distrust in vaccines.

02:18:49.308 --> 02:18:56.170
Let me just show, so that's how the mainstream news, and let me just show you one more quick video about how great this flu vaccine is.

02:18:56.430 --> 02:19:04.313
This is from almost 20 years ago now on CBS News, and of course this woman doesn't work for CBS anymore because she's about to tell you this.

02:19:04.841 --> 02:19:06.422
Here's what scientists have found.

02:19:06.842 --> 02:19:11.543
Over 20 years, the percentage of seniors getting flu shots increased sharply from 15% to 65%.

02:19:12.984 --> 02:19:20.286
It stands to reason that flu deaths among the elderly should have taken a dramatic dip, making an X graph like this.

02:19:20.887 --> 02:19:24.348
Instead, flu deaths among the elderly continue to climb.

02:19:24.868 --> 02:19:33.731
It was hard to believe, so researchers at the National Institutes of Health set out to do a study adjusting for all kinds of factors that could be masking the true benefits of the shots.

02:19:33.991 --> 02:19:38.062
But no matter how they crunched the numbers, they got the same disappointing result.

02:19:38.443 --> 02:19:41.451
Flu shots have not reduced deaths among the elderly.

02:19:43.829 --> 02:20:09.799
not what so that that's your great flu shot CNBC and dr. liar O'Leary and so that's how the so that's how they covered sticking mercury in so he still can't see that autism is a lie he still can't see that intramuscular injection is the lie he still can't see that pandemics are the lie he still can't see the transfection is the lie because even though I gave him the book he's just not gonna look at it they're all liars ladies and gentlemen

02:20:12.694 --> 02:20:14.715
There is no reason to believe Mary Holland.

02:20:14.755 --> 02:20:16.516
There's no reason to believe Robert Malone.

02:20:16.536 --> 02:20:18.457
There's no reason to believe Brian Hooker.

02:20:18.517 --> 02:20:23.100
They are all spectacularly committed to these lies like the rest of these organizations have been.

02:20:24.221 --> 02:20:25.502
They are awful people.

02:20:25.642 --> 02:20:34.547
They are liars and they must know by now because I've told them that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was sculpted using manslaughter and lies.

02:20:34.987 --> 02:20:39.410
It was anticipated and timed perfectly with this rollout of dumb PCR

02:20:40.011 --> 02:20:45.152
without the requisite controls, positive and negative, necessary to be a diagnostic in the first place.

02:20:47.538 --> 02:20:49.779
And if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:20:49.939 --> 02:20:56.660
or Brian Hooker or Mary Holland were really trying to save our children, a lot more people would be skeptical of vaccines by now.

02:20:57.341 --> 02:21:01.242
And more importantly, a lot more people would realize it after the pandemic started.

02:21:01.282 --> 02:21:13.985
But instead, they built a big top tent of health freedom and avoided talking about the basics of the murder, including by helping to obfuscate what really happened to Grace Shara

02:21:14.805 --> 02:21:19.827
and promoting Grace's dad as some kind of spiritual guru now.

02:21:20.267 --> 02:21:21.108
This is a joke.

02:21:21.208 --> 02:21:23.849
These people are traitors to our grandchildren.

02:21:23.889 --> 02:21:25.890
There's a very succinct explanation.

02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:29.811
They murdered people in America and they lied around the world about it.

02:21:29.871 --> 02:21:31.092
And these people are guilty.

02:21:31.692 --> 02:21:35.313
Just like endemicity of racism is not real.

02:21:36.414 --> 02:21:40.976
Endemicity of an RNA that was leaked in a mud puddle is also not real.

02:21:41.896 --> 02:21:44.737
They use non-specific PCR tests to make it happen.

02:21:45.237 --> 02:21:47.917
And then they use placebo to make the shot safe.

02:21:47.997 --> 02:21:52.158
And maybe it's not a placebo anymore because they don't need to because everybody's willing now.

02:21:52.638 --> 02:21:55.838
But using their test to find their ghost does not make their ghost real.

02:21:56.379 --> 02:21:57.919
And it doesn't make you a ghostbuster.

02:21:57.979 --> 02:21:59.959
That I know for absolute certain.

02:22:00.799 --> 02:22:02.940
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:04.280
It's for all the children of earth.

02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:07.480
And if you don't realize it, then you're not fighting in the right way.

02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:09.401
And the actions you take will be useless.

02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:10.441
Get off social media.

02:22:11.741 --> 02:22:17.165
Remember intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:22:17.645 --> 02:22:23.429
Remember that transfection in healthy humans is always dangerous and remember that viruses are not pattern integrities.

02:22:24.609 --> 02:22:28.372
These are the main players that I know of that I have personal

02:22:30.086 --> 02:22:30.786
I know for sure.

02:22:32.046 --> 02:22:34.487
And I'm going to be on probably tomorrow morning.

02:22:34.527 --> 02:22:39.108
I was probably just giving you a... I was probably just faking you out because I don't want the streak to end.

02:22:39.628 --> 02:22:41.328
But it might be a shorter show tomorrow.

02:22:42.248 --> 02:22:45.629
And then Wednesday on, we'll be back and working full time.

02:22:45.649 --> 02:22:47.069
I love you guys very much.

02:22:47.109 --> 02:22:47.930
Thanks for being here.

02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:50.810
Sorry for the long one, but you know, that's what I do.

02:22:52.390 --> 02:22:53.031
See you soon.

02:22:53.231 --> 02:22:53.891
See you soon.

02:22:53.911 --> 02:22:54.931
See you soon.

02:23:05.196 --> 02:23:10.443
I can't explain this paper unless you understand that its authors are there for a reason.

02:23:10.543 --> 02:23:19.935
That the authors like Robert Malone and Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose and Harvey Reich

02:23:22.277 --> 02:23:35.451
and steve and hatfield are not there by accident they're there because they are part of this narrative control um claire craig would love to hear that a hundred thousand look at a hundred thousand babies with their genetic code

02:23:35.971 --> 02:23:39.733
is exactly what Claire Craig was doing at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:23:39.833 --> 02:23:40.753
Interesting, isn't it?
