00:23.964 --> 00:24.785
The End

01:07.247 --> 01:14.409
You know, I just wanted to say I've appreciated you since I first heard you on Linda Moulton Howell.

01:15.309 --> 01:23.391
And I know what it's like to be so angry, because I feel like the shots killed my husband, who died recently.

01:24.371 --> 01:29.132
And I just want to say, don't let your anger get the better of you.

01:29.152 --> 01:30.973
You know, stay healthy.

01:30.993 --> 01:32.933
Stay strong.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.054
Do what you can to not let this eat you up.

01:36.897 --> 01:37.658
That's my message.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.719
Anyway, thanks a lot for all you do.

01:41.160 --> 01:41.420
Bye-bye.

01:49.965 --> 01:50.526
Initiative.

01:52.547 --> 01:58.471
I'm a very, very deliberate and committed follower and 100% all in on your message.

02:02.309 --> 02:08.071
You posted a 13-minute segment of yesterday's live stream that I watch every day.

02:08.131 --> 02:13.392
Unfortunately, I don't necessarily watch it live, but I watch every one of them start to finish.

02:13.452 --> 02:18.013
In fact, typically I fall asleep to them and have to watch them again the next day.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.374
So just hats off on the work that you're doing.

02:22.735 --> 02:25.495
No need and not even a request to call back.

02:25.755 --> 02:28.136
Someday I'll get the opportunity to meet you up in Pittsburgh.

02:30.049 --> 02:33.231
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:38.894 --> 02:42.536
Uh, and my question is about that 13 minute segment with Tony bark.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.198
I think that's an incredibly powerful segment.

02:45.678 --> 02:50.521
Uh, however, you know, you dropped a lot of names, which of course I know you're fine with that.

02:50.881 --> 02:56.825
Um, but there's also the name calling, which me personally, I'm fine with that being from Manhattan, New York myself.

02:57.800 --> 03:11.549
And I wanted to really just ask, and I'll ask it on your gigahome.bio, so no need to even respond to this, but I just wanted to make sure that you were okay with us or with me posting that segment everywhere.

03:12.930 --> 03:22.395
The Tony Barth thing and the Brandy Vaughn thing just makes my skin crawl and frankly brings a tear to my eye on a daily basis.

03:22.796 --> 03:25.778
So again, thank you very much for your incredible work.

03:27.287 --> 03:38.541
unbelievable courage that you and Verily and by nature or by extension your entire family, because I have an idea of what you've got on the line here.

03:38.741 --> 03:39.422
So thanks again.

03:55.426 --> 04:01.812
Of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic.

04:01.912 --> 04:04.775
There was no pandemic and there will be no pandemic.

04:05.455 --> 04:11.921
And it's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

04:12.141 --> 04:12.602
It can't.

04:13.242 --> 04:17.005
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

04:17.906 --> 04:22.010
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

04:30.234 --> 04:46.444
Protect yourself at all times.

04:46.884 --> 04:47.644
Follow my instructions.

04:48.305 --> 04:48.925
Keep it clean.

04:49.285 --> 04:50.326
Touch gloves if you wish.

04:50.566 --> 04:51.046
Let's do it.

04:52.367 --> 04:53.188
Sweaty palms.

04:53.388 --> 04:54.648
This is so crazy.

04:54.709 --> 04:56.269
Like goosebumps.

04:57.458 --> 04:58.544
This is so crazy.

04:58.745 --> 05:01.941
I feel so nervous, like what in the world, man?

05:25.399 --> 05:31.162
responsibility for the current pandemic.

05:32.923 --> 05:36.745
Stop lying.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.187
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

05:54.019 --> 06:14.395
to introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

06:15.516 --> 06:18.819
And then each of us, this incredible, preeminent

06:19.597 --> 06:20.778
panel that we have.

06:20.858 --> 06:25.581
Each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

06:25.861 --> 06:32.004
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

06:32.044 --> 06:37.568
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

06:38.288 --> 06:46.271
He was one of the co-founders of drastic, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

06:46.311 --> 06:51.093
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

06:51.154 --> 06:56.836
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

06:56.876 --> 07:00.938
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

07:02.078 --> 07:06.062
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flatteries.

07:07.022 --> 07:12.327
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flatteries.

07:13.247 --> 07:17.230
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flatteries.

07:17.250 --> 07:22.415
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flatteries.

07:23.359 --> 07:36.710
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape, and they just don't have the latitude to act unilaterally.

07:37.010 --> 07:46.237
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape.

07:48.980 --> 07:50.481
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.883
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:54.671 --> 07:55.373
And I have lied.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.455
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.417
I don't want to lie.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.240
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.402
I try not to be a liar.

08:00.422 --> 08:01.264
I don't want to be a liar.

08:01.825 --> 08:04.570
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

08:20.128 --> 08:21.390
Truth is good for kids.

08:21.650 --> 08:25.475
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

08:25.956 --> 08:28.279
We want everybody to feel good.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.962
That's not the way life is.

09:06.269 --> 09:09.432
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

09:09.913 --> 09:11.734
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

09:13.716 --> 09:14.097
Isolation?

09:14.137 --> 09:14.477
What was it?

09:14.637 --> 09:15.838
Isolation and purification.

09:17.580 --> 09:18.301
Of the virus?

09:18.401 --> 09:18.581
Yes.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.604
Well, you isolate a virus by

09:28.405 --> 09:30.887
finding the virus which causes a disease.

09:31.547 --> 09:36.411
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

09:36.971 --> 09:39.213
I don't understand what the issue.

09:39.353 --> 09:44.797
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.039
No, it depends on how they used it.

09:47.479 --> 09:47.779
Okay.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.721
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

09:53.868 --> 09:55.831
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

09:55.891 --> 10:01.919
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

10:01.999 --> 10:04.062
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

10:08.348 --> 10:09.650
Actually, JJ, could we just...

10:10.351 --> 10:15.498
insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

10:16.258 --> 10:23.427
Actually, JJ Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

10:24.188 --> 10:24.929
Actually, JJ Cooey.

10:37.128 --> 10:44.290
You know, I just wanted to say I've appreciated you since I first heard you on Linda Moulton Howe.

10:45.191 --> 10:53.274
And I know what it's like to be so angry, because I feel like the shots killed my husband, who died recently.

10:54.254 --> 10:59.016
And I just want to say, don't let your anger get the better of you.

10:59.036 --> 11:00.856
You know, stay healthy.

11:00.876 --> 11:02.817
Stay strong.

11:03.077 --> 11:05.938
Do what you can to not let this eat you up.

11:06.778 --> 11:07.518
That's my message.

11:08.779 --> 11:10.620
Anyway, thanks a lot for all you do.

11:11.040 --> 11:11.300
Bye-bye.

11:19.703 --> 11:25.986
Our newsmaker this hour, Dr. Marty McCary, the FDA commissioner, marking his first 100 days on the job.

11:26.006 --> 11:30.268
It's been a busy few months with many changes at the agency from vaccines to staffing.

11:30.808 --> 11:32.008
Good morning, Doctor.

11:32.368 --> 11:33.569
Good morning, Joe.

11:34.585 --> 11:47.330
I don't, maybe you've been on a few times, I don't remember, but we all went through that period together, obviously, and there's a lot of look back now at that period.

11:48.890 --> 11:54.692
It's a hot button issue, and sometimes it's tough to talk about, and there's conspiracies and controversies.

11:54.752 --> 11:56.993
I think of Novak Djokovic.

11:57.453 --> 12:02.375
Right now, he's gonna be in the finals, I think, at Wimbledon, and at the time, I wondered about

12:03.410 --> 12:11.131
His decision, the decision of Tannis, what do we know now, doctor, in your view, about what we should have done with COVID?

12:11.411 --> 12:17.692
Should healthy people have been, not forced, but strongly coerced to take that?

12:17.872 --> 12:21.593
At the time, I thought it was a game changer.

12:22.173 --> 12:24.054
Strongly coerced, he called it.

12:24.094 --> 12:24.854
That was pretty good.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.654
Should they have been forced?

12:26.754 --> 12:30.415
I mean, strongly coerced, as if that's better, slightly better than.

12:30.435 --> 12:32.215
And a lifesaver.

12:33.797 --> 12:43.561
Well, look, Joe, I had said during the time of the pandemic that if we have vaccine mandates for young, healthy individuals, we were going to see a rise of an anti-vaccine sentiment.

12:43.701 --> 12:45.342
And I think that's exactly what happened.

12:45.382 --> 12:48.323
We saw a tremendous loss in public trust.

12:49.229 --> 12:57.653
A study in JAMA found that 71% of people trusted their doctors and hospitals before the COVID pandemic.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.213
That's down to 40%.

12:58.873 --> 13:00.554
That's a 31 point drop.

13:01.034 --> 13:07.557
And I think it was from... So one of the things that I would suggest you pay attention to is this idea that these percentages mean something.

13:08.197 --> 13:12.861
that you can understand the illusion of consensus by hearing these percentages.

13:13.341 --> 13:19.106
That's the enchantment that's being cast here, that there is a percentage

13:19.704 --> 13:22.946
you know, when it crosses over that you can't really argue with anymore.

13:23.506 --> 13:35.734
When it reaches, I don't know, I guess 80% or something like that, if he says, polls say that 80% of Americans believe that there's an alien in the White House, then at what point do you stop arguing with it?

13:35.794 --> 13:37.755
That's the illusion that they're doing here.

13:37.795 --> 13:47.401
But maybe with the example of an alien in the White House, it's a bit easier for you to see how that illusion of consensus could be created by him just saying that when they poll Americans,

13:47.921 --> 13:50.162
you know, mowed the majority of Americans believe.

13:51.983 --> 14:07.953
But when you think about a public health emergency, or you think about the transgender rights issue, or abortion, or gay marriage, or any of these other things, that's actually where this

14:09.209 --> 14:27.448
This weapon is most aptly deployed, I think, most successfully used against us, where for a very long time, we've already been trained to accept that there is a consensus that could be reached, where then we'd have to reconsider what we think about certain things.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.001
That's what the evening news does for us.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.501
That's what Sunday morning programs do.

14:34.081 --> 14:52.405
And it's a very, very dangerous trap if you don't see it like I didn't, and most of us don't see as we were watching TV as a kid, and as we've transitioned to using social media as adults, or God forbid, growing up as a child with social media as the default.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.861
ignoring natural immunity.

14:56.041 --> 15:08.271
I think it was from vaccine mandates, insisting that soldiers and firefighters and teachers be fired if they don't have the vaccine, even if they were young and healthy and had the infection already.

15:08.311 --> 15:16.177
They had circulating antibodies that could neutralize the virus, but they were antibodies the government did not recognize because it failed to recognize natural immunity.

15:16.477 --> 15:17.578
So we lost a lot of ground.

15:17.638 --> 15:23.343
Wow, so that's a whole spectacular just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang of the, sorry, Ruby.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.264
Ruby just came over and wanted a little scratch on her head.

15:27.645 --> 15:40.352
The idea that he hit all of those marks, you know, natural immunity is real, it's defined by antibodies, but certain antibodies weren't recognized by the government and I don't know in what context to travel or to opt out or

15:41.132 --> 15:55.577
You know, and it's just remarkable how succinctly after five years of practicing with Vinay and ZDogg and others and selling his book for five years, he's gotten really good at this.

15:56.677 --> 16:02.279
And I assure you it's because he was given a script relatively early and told, you know, practice this, work on this.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.619
We'll update it as we go.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.601
And hopefully everything will work out and we'll get you in the Trump administration.

16:11.118 --> 16:18.809
in public trust and we're trying to rebuild that now through radical transparency and being very honest and telling people the government is not your doctor.

16:18.849 --> 16:22.634
Talk to your doctor and get good advice from your doctor's wisdom and judgment.

16:23.752 --> 16:34.240
There are some changes at the Vaccine Advisory Committee that a lot of hand-wringing and consternation about the new members.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.002
Is it anti-vax, doctor, would you say?

16:37.562 --> 16:42.806
How would you describe your approach to preemptive disease management?

16:44.551 --> 16:54.939
Look, I think over at CDC, a different agency, they do have a reconstituted ACIP committee with a diversity of views among people who do believe that vaccines save lives.

16:55.660 --> 17:00.604
The past committee had pushed for COVID boosters in young, healthy people.

17:01.004 --> 17:04.847
And of course, that is probably why we see such a backlash today.

17:04.927 --> 17:09.090
There was never great evidence for repeat boosters in young, healthy children.

17:09.110 --> 17:13.594
As a matter of fact, there was a myocarditis risk that was largely downplayed in young males.

17:14.294 --> 17:23.461
And I think if you look at the track record of that committee, there's a reason why 85% of healthcare workers did not get a COVID booster last fall.

17:23.821 --> 17:26.183
So we're taking an evidence-based approach.

17:26.343 --> 17:30.846
It's a lot harder to get mad at Marty if I keep these floppy ears in my hands.

17:32.488 --> 17:35.290
Dang it, what is this free disk space crap?

17:36.891 --> 17:38.512
I'm really just shocked, right?

17:38.552 --> 17:53.702
I mean, this is just the standard fare for these people that have been scripted since 2020 or earlier, queued up, even told to be, try to be relevant, you know, before the pandemic, get your book out.

17:55.163 --> 17:58.465
At this point, I don't think anything is beyond the pale.

17:59.954 --> 18:06.599
We are talking about people who operate on different time horizons and they're thinking on different time horizons.

18:06.680 --> 18:20.570
If Mark Kulak is right about nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, even about some of it and some categories of it, then we're in an entirely different trap than we ever imagined.

18:20.610 --> 18:27.635
Yes, social media is a terrible part of it, but the commitment that these people will have

18:29.844 --> 18:40.285
to the goal and the destination will be far greater than we might have imagined if indeed this plan is on that time horizon.

18:41.685 --> 18:48.047
where they can point back to a couple generations ago and say that, you know, this is a continuous thing.

18:48.107 --> 18:49.488
People are serious about this.

18:50.048 --> 18:52.989
If you join up, there's no getting out.

18:53.829 --> 18:55.470
And I think a lot of these people are there.

18:55.550 --> 18:58.031
I think that's, you know, that sounds crazy.

18:58.071 --> 19:01.672
It sounds very conspiratorial, but it's really probably how the world works.

19:04.153 --> 19:07.294
And that only requires coordinated lying.

19:08.294 --> 19:12.161
to all the people in the club, all the people who are auditioning to be part of the club.

19:12.181 --> 19:13.703
And there might be different layers of the club.

19:13.723 --> 19:14.384
Who gives a shit?

19:14.404 --> 19:21.496
I'm going to switch over to the thing again.

19:24.540 --> 19:34.804
Dr. Vinay Prasad and I outlined it in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we're basically saying that there's got to be a risk stratified approach, that is high risk versus low risk.

19:34.884 --> 19:42.147
Does a healthy 12-year-old girl today need another 60 doses in her average lifespan?

19:42.267 --> 19:43.928
It's remarkable how deep they go.

19:44.408 --> 19:47.249
You know, that one lady before this had kind of a fat arm.

19:47.290 --> 19:51.592
This looks like a pretty relatively fit young lady with also a deep needle.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.372
It's impressive.

19:52.832 --> 19:54.173
And that is a scientific unknown.

19:54.213 --> 19:59.215
And we'd like to see a clinical trial before approving the vaccine for that reason.

19:59.536 --> 20:03.157
And so what is Marty saying is the debate here?

20:03.237 --> 20:08.680
The debate is whether we should give somebody a COVID shot every year or not, because it wasn't approved for that yet.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.901
I don't know how you test that.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.952
He just said 60 times in their life.

20:13.012 --> 20:16.075
Is he saying that somebody should get a COVID shot for the rest of their lives?

20:16.635 --> 20:18.357
Is the CDC recommending that?

20:18.497 --> 20:23.662
Is Marty saying that that is a valid question to consider?

20:25.663 --> 20:28.005
I just think that this is all a false debate.

20:28.065 --> 20:34.930
It's very similar to what was being done with the WHO in the video yesterday with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:34.970 --> 20:44.457
talking about the international health regulations and that they give rights to countries during emergencies and they want to amend them and we're going to reject the amendments, yada, yada, yada.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.625
I mean, this is very similar.

20:47.665 --> 20:55.820
What's happening, I think, quite frankly, is that they've lost a lot of senior people at the FDA that were offered retirement.

20:57.097 --> 20:58.898
And now they have a very big problem.

20:58.938 --> 21:01.819
There's some people who probably stayed because they thought they could get ahead.

21:01.859 --> 21:05.601
There's probably some people who stayed because they probably thought they were too young to retire.

21:06.181 --> 21:15.685
There's probably, I mean, but there's not a functional FDA there, especially if now they're reorganizing all the basic processes of the whole organization.

21:16.426 --> 21:17.446
Hiring right now.

21:17.926 --> 21:20.868
I mean, this transition is false.

21:21.823 --> 21:25.825
this seamless transition to podcasting is false.

21:25.965 --> 21:34.290
Well, the seamless transition to podcasting is real, but the podcasting is not a reflection of a functional FDA.

21:34.330 --> 21:43.496
Instead, it's the curtain behind which probably things are being ripped apart, destroyed, burnt to the ground, whatever they called it.

21:43.576 --> 21:46.998
Now, giant dog, you have to sit a little bit farther back because

21:49.920 --> 21:50.541
Now that's right there.

21:50.581 --> 21:50.862
It's good.

21:51.082 --> 21:51.502
That's fine.

21:51.983 --> 21:55.608
I got to be able to move my stool without running over here No, don't roll over anymore.

21:55.628 --> 21:58.472
No, just stay right there Okay, here we go

21:59.918 --> 22:16.944
How does removing the recommendation, though, increase choice, increase the patient's ability to come to a decision with doctors, since so many insurance plans and programs depend on ACIP and CDC recommendations in order to provide the no-cost, low-cost vaccines?

22:17.585 --> 22:20.786
Isn't this removing choice effectively from patients?

22:22.059 --> 22:27.564
Now, the promise of the Secretary Kennedy is to let people know that vaccines will be available.

22:27.604 --> 22:29.546
So that's really what this is all about, right?

22:29.566 --> 22:34.690
That's why I titled my stream this, you know, the promise of Secretary Kennedy.

22:37.933 --> 22:45.160
It's just driving me bananas that social media is mentally

22:46.567 --> 23:15.957
captivating us to believe captured us to believe that secretary kennedy represents some kind of resistance some kind of health freedom some kind of uh you know free choice kind of thing that's kind of in parallel to you know free choice versus pro-life or i don't know something like that um and it's a really malevolent show and i think americans should be very alarmed that underneath

23:16.980 --> 23:29.027
The Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I used to work for, was paid for as a consultant for a year before I was a staff scientist at CHD for half a year.

23:29.988 --> 23:40.554
And now I've spent the last year trying to tell the world that I think that Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and CHD are fraudulent.

23:42.096 --> 23:45.117
I'm trying to tell people that I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:45.197 --> 23:49.138
is probably just a victim of a very elaborate Truman show.

23:49.638 --> 23:50.499
He's on a script.

23:50.519 --> 23:51.739
He was told to trust it.

23:52.919 --> 24:09.844
And behind him are people like Aaron Seery and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Steve Bannon and probably Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and all these other people.

24:11.005 --> 24:11.325
I don't know.

24:12.426 --> 24:14.007
who's at all the barbecues.

24:16.890 --> 24:23.995
But we have a very big problem on our hands because I do believe this can be characterized as America being undermined.

24:24.075 --> 24:26.177
It could be characterized as America being

24:26.903 --> 24:54.404
Infiltrated because many of these people are not even American citizens They're not even the default good guy dual passport Israeli Americans, which I guess everybody says they're all good guys That's why they're the only dual citizens that are allowed to serve in government as a representative or a senator But I just I'm confused as to why there is a used to be kind of clown on TV doctor

24:55.529 --> 24:56.629
Dr. Oz?

24:58.270 --> 25:02.331
A former officer in the Turkish military or some shit?

25:03.011 --> 25:07.953
Like why is he anywhere near the head of Medicaid and Medicare?

25:10.293 --> 25:23.397
Unless there was like a huge disaster in the pipeline of the population pyramid and it was going to bankrupt America and so they needed somebody, a dishonest actor in there.

25:24.363 --> 25:27.684
who could use it as part of the controlled demolition of America.

25:27.744 --> 25:29.564
Control it, if you will.

25:30.304 --> 25:45.587
Why would they put a guy from Egypt with a UK passport at the head of the FDA talking about reorganizing all the stuff to do with all the fancy new medicines with some put-in-place child from India?

25:46.627 --> 25:52.708
Also, not a native-born American who highlights that he went to high school in the port, Indiana.

25:55.874 --> 26:13.872
Usually when you're not born in America, then you don't say it and he indeed doesn't say it He says he went to high school in La Porte, Indiana Which is not a very nice place you should have better better been from Michigan City, Indiana Anyway, let me just get this going again

26:14.858 --> 26:15.759
if people want them.

26:15.799 --> 26:17.820
You will be able to get a vaccine if you want them.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.942
So that's a decision between you and your doctor.

26:19.982 --> 26:24.965
And each individual insurance company has their own policy.

26:25.025 --> 26:32.570
Look, some insurance companies don't pay for important cancer treatments that I, for patients that I saw as a cancer surgeon.

26:33.090 --> 26:36.693
And so that is another entire issue that's unrelated to the FDA.

26:38.058 --> 27:03.861
Okay, so insurance, so the fact that private insurers, employer-sponsored insurance plans, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, the Vaccines for Children program, all of them link providing no-cost vaccines to CDC and ACIP recommendations, that removing the recommendations doesn't remove in some way the choice that patients can make, especially the vulnerable patients who may not be able to afford to pay.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.506
That's right, it does not remove the choice.

27:07.566 --> 27:14.013
And our job at the FDA is, and this is a charge by Congress, is to look at applications that are submitted.

27:14.094 --> 27:16.977
So is he almost like pretending he doesn't understand the question?

27:17.037 --> 27:22.724
She's saying that if they don't recommend it, then a lot of these other organizations, private organizations, won't pay for it.

27:23.905 --> 27:24.946
And he says, yeah, that's right.

27:24.986 --> 27:28.349
It doesn't take away their choice, but their choice would be if it was paid for.

27:28.389 --> 27:31.131
If it's not paid for for many people, they can't make the choice.

27:31.832 --> 27:33.713
I understand these are legitimate questions.

27:33.773 --> 27:43.842
I just don't want people to be able to make the choice between, you know, getting hit in the head with a baseball bat and not getting hit in the head with a baseball bat is a legitimate medical question because it's not.

27:44.142 --> 27:46.305
to us and determine what is safe and effective.

27:46.725 --> 27:49.048
And so that is what we are committed to.

27:49.529 --> 27:57.939
I think there was some lost trust in the FDA when there was a new policy that basically said for a young, healthy 15-year-old boy,

27:59.901 --> 28:06.204
We were going to rubber stamp a COVID vaccine without a clinical trial every year in perpetuity, and the kid must get it.

28:06.344 --> 28:10.246
And I think we're saying we're going to be less absolutist when there's no evidence.

28:10.286 --> 28:19.910
I think the most dangerous thing you can do in public health is to demand something of a young, healthy individual when the evidence is just not that supportive for a new virus that creates it.

28:20.650 --> 28:30.601
a new protein and a new vaccine that creates a new protein where we haven't had a clinical trial in over four years and those results in children were mixed back four years ago.

28:32.548 --> 28:41.995
The basic tenets of MAH, of MAHA, or Make America Healthy Again, it seems to me it's proactive healthcare versus reactive.

28:42.255 --> 28:50.641
You'd have to do that with children, I think, and I immediately think... It's important to remember in the chat that Marty is a cancer surgeon.

28:50.701 --> 28:51.962
He cut tumors out.

28:52.923 --> 28:55.584
And Vinayak Prasad is also a

28:56.926 --> 29:14.147
a a cancer guy he worked at the national cancer institutes where the where the in-laws of lee min yan worked for so many years this isn't a remarkable small little circle of shitheads about uh as a country uh our levels of obesity

29:15.248 --> 29:18.692
are just much higher than they need to be or should be.

29:19.293 --> 29:25.199
What does tackling that entail and how does it play in?

29:25.299 --> 29:31.146
I think it entails getting cane sugar into all of our sugary drinks.

29:31.406 --> 29:33.688
I think it entails getting the

29:34.389 --> 29:46.503
the petroleum-based dyes out of all of our chips and make sure that any fats that are used at fast food restaurants are based on tallow.

29:46.623 --> 29:49.847
I think at that point, most of our problems will go away.

29:50.848 --> 29:57.272
into these new drugs and whether you really start, I don't know, is that what we need to do to all our kids?

29:57.953 --> 30:00.474
With Wegovy or Ozempic or something, doctor?

30:01.135 --> 30:01.815
What's the answer?

30:01.855 --> 30:02.556
Is it foods?

30:02.656 --> 30:03.496
Is it additives?

30:04.257 --> 30:05.818
The secretary has a lot of ideas.

30:07.711 --> 30:09.111
Yeah, it's all of the above, Joe.

30:09.171 --> 30:12.172
And we've not been talking about root causes in health care.

30:12.212 --> 30:14.333
I've been in- Yes, that was sarcasm, Mark.

30:14.373 --> 30:14.713
Sorry.

30:15.313 --> 30:20.135
Academic medicine and been at all the major institutions giving grand rounds.

30:20.195 --> 30:29.018
We don't talk about- See, the problem with cane sugar is that if they use glyphosate to dry the cane sugar, then you have glyphosate in your sugar.

30:30.438 --> 30:34.221
And I'm not convinced that that's very well controlled.

30:34.941 --> 30:42.125
So, the transition from one poison to another might just have different metabolic consequences.

30:42.746 --> 30:45.047
So, that's one of the things that's on my mind.

30:45.107 --> 30:46.028
It's not the only thing.

30:46.068 --> 30:49.510
The other thing is that, you know, Mexican Coke isn't that good for you either.

30:50.923 --> 31:15.500
Granted it might be better than drinking, you know, Coca-Cola with with corn syrup in it But I don't think liquid candy is liquid candy and liquid candy is liquid candy That's what you got to think about and fast food I mean, you know deep-fried food is really tasty for a very particular reason and and The worst forms of it are very very bad but

31:17.116 --> 31:18.938
It's also about frequency, you know?

31:19.038 --> 31:28.548
I mean, if you never eat at In-N-Out Burger, if you never eat at McDonald's, if you never eat at Burger King, if you never eat at Arby's, you know, and then what?

31:29.289 --> 31:29.509
So...

31:30.407 --> 31:45.620
You know, changing all those foods to healthier things doesn't really, doesn't really affect you as an American, but it does affect a lot of poor people who spend a majority of their money in places where they're not, you know, optimizing their food.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.382
They can't, they don't have time to cook.

31:48.443 --> 31:49.624
Um, they might be single.

31:49.824 --> 31:58.171
I mean, and so this is really kind of the, you know, I mean, if you have a family that, that works well, you have a, uh,

31:59.250 --> 32:05.098
One of the parents is, you know, I mean the next door neighbors, it's exactly the opposite of our house.

32:06.600 --> 32:14.671
The lady has a more, how would I say it, you know, important job that she, you know, is a little bit more hardcore about.

32:15.631 --> 32:24.736
And he's more relaxed about his job and he does almost all the cooking and every time I've had anything sent over it's he's a Remarkable cook which I am NOT.

32:24.836 --> 32:38.242
I mean I'm competent I wouldn't die in the wilderness, you know, and I if I was in a sailboat with a basic kitchen I could probably make breakfast but let's let's not I mean I

32:41.328 --> 32:45.832
People that don't have a family, ladies and gentlemen, live a very different life in America.

32:45.892 --> 32:48.033
Like my brother lives a very different life.

32:49.074 --> 32:50.315
They order out a lot.

32:53.498 --> 33:09.391
And it's just a remarkable place that we are in America right now because when this all goes south, you know, and people who are eating out of boxes and bags can't get the boxes and bags anymore, it's gonna be a very bizarre world.

33:10.431 --> 33:26.480
It's going to be a very bizarre time as we transition into a time when if you were not taking responsibility and you were not setting yourself up, you know, for some success, you're going to be in big trouble when the water goes out.

33:26.520 --> 33:31.342
You're going to be in big trouble when the lights go out for a couple months.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.684
And I'm not joking around about it anymore.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.447
You don't need to tell me it's going to be a pole shift.

33:37.467 --> 33:45.637
You just need to tell me that these people are where they are right now, where somehow or another in America, we have this guy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:46.198 --> 33:53.267
and Jayant Bhattacharya at these very important integral positions within the Health and Human Services hierarchy.

33:54.363 --> 33:58.225
And the only explanation I have for it is that we are being undermined.

33:58.265 --> 34:02.888
We are being, it's some kind of Trojan horse where we were fooled.

34:03.148 --> 34:04.128
I was fooled.

34:04.869 --> 34:05.769
I was there.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.351
I got the free shirt in Boston.

34:09.571 --> 34:12.553
And I thought I was witnessing perhaps American history.

34:14.241 --> 34:25.967
You know, American history that was predicted in the 2008 Skyhorse book written by supposedly Jesse Ventura, where in the epilogue, Jesse Ventura is running for president and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:26.007 --> 34:27.408
is running as an independent.

34:28.048 --> 34:31.010
And Jesse takes Bobby as his vice president.

34:31.030 --> 34:33.411
And then right after they're elected, Jesse gets shot.

34:36.372 --> 34:38.293
Isn't that incredibly odd?

34:41.198 --> 34:54.465
Epilogue to write in a book Skyhorse publishing, of course being the publisher that now Children's Health Defense publishes their book under Tony Lyons being the guy who like helped with Robert F. Kennedy jr.'

34:54.425 --> 35:09.494
's campaign Tony Lyons the guy that that Steve Bannon whenever he mentions is in his name calls him a genius It's all one scripted show ladies and gentlemen

35:10.307 --> 35:11.648
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

35:11.628 --> 35:20.311
's dad played an integral role in the modernization of the FDA during the time of Estes Kefauver.

35:21.831 --> 35:26.373
And so did Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein's dad.

35:28.820 --> 35:29.380
root causes.

35:29.420 --> 35:34.664
We don't ask, why do 40 percent of our nation's children now have a chronic disease?

35:34.764 --> 35:39.708
Why do a third of our nation's children now have prediabetes or diabetes?

35:40.068 --> 35:44.471
We have got to talk about school lunch programs, not just putting every 6-year-old on Ozempic.

35:44.732 --> 35:50.436
We have got to talk about environmental exposures and chemicals in the food, not just

35:50.856 --> 35:51.757
chemotherapy.

35:51.817 --> 35:57.222
If you look at the types of cancer that are going up in young people, they are the GI cancers.

35:57.282 --> 36:00.706
That is the organ that interfaces with what we eat.

36:00.886 --> 36:07.773
I had a couple of high school kids when I was a teacher who already had irritable bowel syndrome.

36:07.813 --> 36:11.677
My guess was is that they got the HPV vaccine as teenagers.

36:11.857 --> 36:14.960
I don't know because at the time I was an idiot.

36:15.903 --> 36:18.465
But what I do know is that there was a couple girls.

36:19.886 --> 36:23.128
One was a senior and one was a junior at the same school where I was at.

36:23.148 --> 36:27.530
It happened to be a school where the kids were closer to the teachers.

36:30.592 --> 36:31.733
I don't know why I can't say it.

36:31.793 --> 36:33.534
It's the Chicago Academy for the Arts.

36:33.734 --> 36:36.316
I taught there for a year, and it's a really wonderful school.

36:38.077 --> 36:44.061
It's a private school, so most of the kids are from decent, well-to-do families, although there are scholarships to be had.

36:45.847 --> 36:48.529
And at the time, I mean, it was just a magnificent place.

36:48.569 --> 36:54.153
You taught your academic in the morning, and then they had arts all afternoon.

36:54.213 --> 37:02.019
And some of them were dancers, some of them were theater students, some of them were graphic artists, you know, visual arts.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.280
And then there were musicians.

37:04.321 --> 37:05.582
And they took it to an extreme.

37:05.642 --> 37:06.642
I mean, it was a very,

37:07.523 --> 37:22.710
Impressive level of student that that place produced and they were very interesting students to have in chemistry and physics and because Art students at that school got very close to each other when we would have I add this thing in the classroom

37:23.416 --> 37:25.677
that we would say if we're on the air, off the air.

37:25.738 --> 37:30.641
And if they said, can we talk off the air, then we could talk about stuff.

37:30.701 --> 37:32.842
And somebody started talking about that.

37:33.002 --> 37:37.445
And I didn't understand even at the time why they were asking me about it.

37:38.285 --> 37:40.686
But they were asking me, where do they think this is coming from?

37:40.726 --> 37:50.388
Because there's two girls in this class, or in this, in our senior class, who have this, you know, really bad bowel thing.

37:50.528 --> 37:53.309
And we don't under, why, why did that happen?

37:53.369 --> 37:57.430
And, and, and do you know, and I just, I didn't even know what the question meant.

37:57.510 --> 37:59.151
I was like, I don't even know what you're talking about.

37:59.191 --> 37:59.691
What is that?

38:00.694 --> 38:01.614
And so I had to look it up.

38:02.475 --> 38:08.197
We had a little follow-up class about it, what I learned when I Googled it, when I looked it up on the internet.

38:08.217 --> 38:08.997
But I didn't know.

38:09.017 --> 38:10.117
I didn't understand.

38:10.177 --> 38:11.738
I didn't have the answer back then.

38:12.538 --> 38:13.238
I was an idiot.

38:13.919 --> 38:16.419
I was just treading water trying to get into med school.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.222
And so for me, this is a very long, painful awakening.

38:24.322 --> 38:29.224
As an American, it's a very long, painful awakening to understand that much of this

38:30.117 --> 38:39.820
You know, mythology is centered around America, centered around the American experiment, because that's where, of course, where all the money was, all the power was, the big military, the endless resources.

38:41.281 --> 38:49.603
And so even the international players that were involved in this multi-generational plan still had to move through the circles in America.

38:50.704 --> 38:54.265
You know, in London, in England, in the Vatican, I guess, I don't know, but...

38:55.256 --> 38:58.079
Holy crap, ladies and gentlemen, we're there right now.

38:58.139 --> 38:58.860
You can see it.

38:58.920 --> 39:04.065
As Mark said, you know, it's not that we're not that far from being in Nazi Germany already.

39:05.066 --> 39:15.016
If you understand how these coordinated liars got where they are, which is just rule by podcast, just agreeing to agree on something.

39:16.717 --> 39:17.838
I mean, these people,

39:18.843 --> 39:28.467
Ladies and gentlemen are playing a very dangerous game because if we wake up and realize it and show it and see it, they won't be able to sustain it anymore.

39:30.788 --> 39:34.509
It's the sort of sitting there with your 3D glasses on eating popcorn.

39:34.549 --> 39:40.752
And as long as you sit there with your glasses on and munching popcorn, all of these people are just going to keep on performing.

39:40.772 --> 39:47.555
But the moment that you take your glasses off and throw the popcorn at the screen, log off of social media,

39:48.726 --> 39:50.587
Start building your own peer tube.

39:50.627 --> 40:02.490
Start, I don't know, using Mastodon to communicate with people and follow people on a federated network and show them that you're willing not to use X anymore.

40:03.790 --> 40:06.751
You're willing not to use Facebook anymore.

40:06.791 --> 40:09.252
You're willing to just stop.

40:10.372 --> 40:15.214
And you know what would really be amazing is if people that paid for these websites would stop.

40:15.274 --> 40:16.514
I've never paid for Twitter.

40:17.594 --> 40:20.156
But I'm going to stop paying for Rumble very soon.

40:20.176 --> 40:23.418
I have to pay for the privilege to stream there.

40:24.358 --> 40:25.619
I mean, no more.

40:26.820 --> 40:28.081
It's not going to happen anymore.

40:29.142 --> 40:30.502
Because there's no reason to.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.324
There's an open source app.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.826
You don't have to log in.

40:36.506 --> 40:37.607
I never have to charge.

40:38.488 --> 40:41.610
I can just shake the can on the internet and hope people feel

40:42.526 --> 40:43.927
the need to support the work.

40:44.507 --> 40:47.689
This guy is a fraud and he's part of a greater fraud.

40:48.310 --> 40:49.671
America needs help.

40:50.351 --> 40:57.316
We need help from the rest of the world for them to understand what's happening, to understand the fraud that's behind Donald Trump.

40:58.677 --> 41:02.379
Because Donald Trump could be fooled by all these people he's surrounded by.

41:02.419 --> 41:09.564
He could have come into office thinking that everything was going to be great and then suddenly got fooled into believing he was just shot at.

41:12.156 --> 41:15.319
So now he's a very different dude, but he doesn't know what happened.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.261
I don't know what happened.

41:17.801 --> 41:31.074
I just know for sure that a kid from my kid's high school didn't show up on a roof an hour away from here with the sniper skills to pierce Donald Trump's ear with a imperceptibly small scar.

41:32.315 --> 41:33.136
It just didn't happen.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.561
We've got to look at all the chemicals.

41:36.601 --> 41:41.605
We are doing an inventory of the thousand plus chemicals banned in Europe that appear in the U.S.

41:41.645 --> 41:42.306
food supply.

41:42.326 --> 41:48.431
You saw our action to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S.

41:48.471 --> 41:49.091
food supply.

41:49.131 --> 41:52.754
By next year, we're getting tremendous participation by the food manufacturers.

41:53.234 --> 41:57.438
We are looking into baby formula innovation, that recipe, the FDA issues.

41:57.578 --> 41:58.839
Please don't misunderstand me.

41:58.879 --> 42:03.282
I'm not saying that I think they got the HPV vaccine and that's why those girls have irritable bowel.

42:03.382 --> 42:04.123
Irritable bowel

42:06.076 --> 42:08.079
You know, could have a lot of different issues.

42:08.319 --> 42:11.502
Inflammation down there means that somehow you're autoimmune.

42:11.522 --> 42:14.426
I don't know.

42:14.446 --> 42:16.108
I haven't gone into it deep enough.

42:17.890 --> 42:25.218
And certainly, you know, eating bad chemicals, and then having inflammation down there would make

42:26.932 --> 42:29.694
sort of broad biological sense, right?

42:29.734 --> 42:31.615
So I'm totally down with that.

42:31.835 --> 42:34.136
Hasn't been updated essentially in 30 years.

42:34.196 --> 42:35.377
We need more innovation.

42:35.757 --> 42:40.100
Moms want baby formula without added sugar, without corn syrup, without seed oils.

42:40.460 --> 42:41.601
We need more innovation.

42:41.701 --> 42:43.222
It's been a regulatory failure.

42:43.742 --> 42:48.185
And we're asking the big question, why does it take 10 years for a drug to come to market?

42:48.685 --> 42:54.249
I mean, that is a giant existential question and we're gonna have to challenge deeply held assumptions to answer it.

42:54.709 --> 42:55.930
So we announced our program.

42:57.051 --> 43:10.317
to reduce animal testing and replace it with computational modeling and organ-on-a-chip technology whereby drugs can be tested on cell culture medium in a lab with cells from the liver or heart or other organoids.

43:10.658 --> 43:12.258
And so we talked about this before.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.980
We might have even covered this stupid video.

43:15.100 --> 43:19.302
It's so hard for me to keep track of what I've done and what I have yet to do.

43:20.857 --> 43:33.500
But it's really scary to think that everything about the FDA is being changed right under our nose under the pretense that it was in the way at the beginning of the pandemic.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.260
It caused problems.

43:35.300 --> 43:38.901
There's no excuse for something taking 10 years to come to market.

43:39.541 --> 43:48.103
These things are all scripted from the very beginning when Kevin McKernan was on podcast after podcast saying the FDA is in the way.

43:48.763 --> 43:52.205
that the 10-page form for the EUA is just ridiculous.

43:52.945 --> 43:53.966
He actually said that.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.388
We have a priority pathway now to pilot.

43:59.028 --> 44:03.530
Can we get a decision out in weeks instead of a year once that final application is approved?

44:03.570 --> 44:05.551
Can we run more continuous trials?

44:06.112 --> 44:08.793
And can we use AI more in the

44:09.508 --> 44:13.792
So a continuous trial is where they, you know, post-market monitoring.

44:13.872 --> 44:15.873
This is really just human testing.

44:15.914 --> 44:16.994
It's, you know, we don't know.

44:17.115 --> 44:18.135
So we're just going to roll it out.

44:18.636 --> 44:20.077
It didn't kill the liver cells.

44:20.698 --> 44:21.979
So we're just going to send it out.

44:22.039 --> 44:25.642
That's actually what he's talking about doing and what they're shifting to.

44:25.882 --> 44:30.304
the review process, we now have AI agency-wide for our reviewers.

44:30.524 --> 44:42.730
And yesterday we announced we're going to make our decision letters, including rejection letters for drug, public information so companies don't spin the results and developers can see exactly how the FDA thinks.

44:42.810 --> 44:45.852
And that's part of our radical transparency agenda.

44:46.584 --> 45:00.128
I wanted to talk to you, Dr. McCary, about the national priority vouchers, which does aim to speed up the approval process after a final drug application is submitted, to get it down to one to two months as opposed to 10 to 12 months.

45:00.168 --> 45:04.849
For national priorities, what qualifies as a national priority?

45:04.889 --> 45:09.491
I mean, let's say there's an obesity drug that's even better than the ones out on the market.

45:10.151 --> 45:15.153
There's nothing to stop them from appointing Robert Malone after the midterms.

45:15.193 --> 45:16.053
There's nothing wrong.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.294
There's nothing to stop them.

45:18.214 --> 45:20.795
Maybe Marty wants to go work in the private sector.

45:20.835 --> 45:29.419
I mean, they changed FDA directors from the dude with the greased back hair from, you know, like, wasn't it Janet Woodcock?

45:29.439 --> 45:31.460
And then they changed it to Gottlieb.

45:31.540 --> 45:32.600
I mean, I don't know.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.061
There's no reason why they can't.

45:34.714 --> 45:40.301
priority for the FDA to consider an expedited process?

45:40.441 --> 45:42.023
What falls into the category?

45:43.254 --> 45:44.194
Great question, Melissa.

45:44.234 --> 45:47.456
So it's a large, unmet public health need.

45:47.676 --> 45:52.038
It is a priority identified as part of a U.S.

45:52.418 --> 45:57.280
domestic national priority, like the domestication of manufacturing as a national security issue.

45:57.620 --> 46:08.464
And look, the president is very adamant that he would like to see lower drug prices for Americans, and he doesn't like it that Americans are getting ripped off with... There's an obesity drug that's even better than the ones out on the market.

46:08.504 --> 46:10.045
Is that a national priority?

46:10.885 --> 46:15.027
for the FDA to consider an expedited process?

46:15.167 --> 46:16.788
What falls into the category?

46:17.968 --> 46:18.929
Great question, Melissa.

46:18.969 --> 46:22.190
So it's a large, unmet public health need.

46:22.411 --> 46:26.772
It is a priority identified as part of a U.S.

46:27.153 --> 46:31.975
domestic national priority, like the domestication of manufacturing as a national security issue.

46:32.830 --> 46:37.131
the domestic domestication of manufacturing.

46:37.191 --> 46:41.993
I think he's referring to bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.

46:42.513 --> 46:44.513
It's a lot of words he's throwing at one time.

46:44.973 --> 46:49.855
And look, the president is very adamant that he would like to see lower drug prices for Americans.

46:49.915 --> 47:00.478
And he doesn't like it that Americans are getting ripped off with drugs that are two, five, 10 times higher in the United States than in London or France or Germany, other OECD countries.

47:01.078 --> 47:05.159
So we are including the affordability of drugs as a national priority.

47:05.219 --> 47:12.202
So we have a committee that's set up that will determine which products and companies will get these vouchers as a part of a pilot.

47:12.502 --> 47:13.762
Look, we've got to try new things.

47:14.002 --> 47:18.864
We've got to ask ourselves, why does it take so long for a cure

47:19.324 --> 47:20.305
to come to market.

47:20.465 --> 47:23.407
And we want to see more cures and meaningful treatments for Americans.

47:23.868 --> 47:35.457
We want to see big data used so we can have eyes on a drug immediately after approval and not just wake up five years later and say, hey, Vioxx may have killed 38,000 people.

47:35.517 --> 47:37.438
Maybe we need to take action or.

47:37.999 --> 47:39.880
Wow, Vioxx.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.422
I wonder who was a whistleblower for Vioxx.

47:42.482 --> 47:44.244
I think her name was Brandy Vaughn.

47:44.284 --> 47:46.245
What an interesting thing to drop there.

47:47.173 --> 47:48.594
Wow, that's pretty crazy.

47:49.115 --> 47:49.875
What a shithead.

47:51.276 --> 47:56.320
Opioids may have killed nearly a million Americans 19 years after the approval of OxyContin.

47:56.620 --> 47:59.263
We're going to be having an incredible post-market surveillance.

47:59.323 --> 48:01.604
And a million over what time frame?

48:02.605 --> 48:04.246
Post-market surveillance of what?

48:04.807 --> 48:06.048
Wow, what a shithead.

48:07.369 --> 48:12.774
It's a program where we monitor drugs immediately after approval using big data and the cloud.

48:12.935 --> 48:15.417
He keeps repeating big data.

48:15.517 --> 48:16.738
Now he said the cloud.

48:16.819 --> 48:18.881
This is all the same show.

48:20.103 --> 48:32.487
It's exciting, just like Claire Craig said from the very beginning on the top of her Twitter thing, she's all for AI, all for AI and cures and stuff, AI and genetics.

48:33.007 --> 48:38.129
Do it well, it can actually change the threshold for approval, especially when it comes to rare diseases.

48:39.089 --> 48:48.812
Can you give us an example of a health crisis right now, just so we have an idea of what source of drugs, what source of companies may be seeking to use this National Priority Voucher Program?

48:49.991 --> 48:56.135
You know, one of the cool things, Melissa, in this job is you get to see potentially promising treatments that are in the pipeline.

48:56.295 --> 48:59.197
And I'd like to see a cure for type 1 diabetes.

48:59.637 --> 49:03.199
I'd like to see more cancer therapies that apply to stage 4.

49:04.824 --> 49:05.364
whoops, sorry.

49:05.604 --> 49:12.706
Pathetic disease and cancer therapies that result in what we call- So again, you can hear that he's positioned very well, right?

49:12.746 --> 49:26.650
His career as a cancer talker and Vinay's career as a cancer talker will allow them to sit opposite each other and talk about these priorities with great detail and bamboozle most of the people who listen.

49:28.170 --> 49:31.511
And he's done it a number of times on the podcast with Vinayak.

49:32.478 --> 49:35.940
and that other Indian that sits between them.

49:37.422 --> 49:38.282
And he's doing it here.

49:38.642 --> 49:43.646
Repeatedly going back to the well of cancer because that's his wheelhouse, right?

49:43.686 --> 49:54.293
That's where he knows all the buzzwords and he knows all the little trinkets and sparkly things that he can say to make it seem like he knows what he's talking about.

49:54.333 --> 50:00.438
Just like he did in the beginning with the, you know, it's all a really amazing script.

50:00.458 --> 50:01.599
He's pretty talented.

50:02.339 --> 50:29.110
medicine a complete pathologic response that is the cancer melts away there already appears to be some therapies that may enable cancers to go shrink and go away completely that is be eliminated without chemo surgery or radiation therapy i'd like to see a universal flu shot so we don't have to try to guess each he'd like to see a universal flu shot as a surgeon for cancer

50:30.066 --> 50:37.572
He just kind of pulls that out of the air, you know, something that everybody's wanted for a really long time, even all the way back to Hazeltine.

50:38.052 --> 50:41.595
What in the hell's going on here other than a scripted traitor?

50:42.516 --> 50:45.498
But he can't really be a traitor because he's not really an American.

50:45.538 --> 50:46.839
You see, that's the beauty of it.

50:50.060 --> 50:50.900
strain is coming.

50:51.521 --> 50:58.365
There are candidates out there and I'd like to see treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and other disabling diseases.

50:58.465 --> 50:59.946
I had an aunt who died of all.

51:00.106 --> 51:01.467
You'd like to see treatments.

51:01.847 --> 51:07.010
He would like to see things come to market that we could post market monitor.

51:09.164 --> 51:11.345
He wants to see treatments, not cures.

51:11.385 --> 51:12.585
He didn't say cures there.

51:12.605 --> 51:14.886
He said cures before, but he said treatments now.

51:14.946 --> 51:21.689
Because right when you bring them to market and then monitor them and the people that you're testing them in, they're just treatments.

51:22.869 --> 51:26.911
And then if they become, they could become cures.

51:27.591 --> 51:28.891
You see, it's all an enchantment.

51:30.092 --> 51:37.955
It's all a semantic enchantment to get you to believe that he's not completely undermining everything that the FDA was supposed to stand for.

51:38.948 --> 51:41.029
and instead he's modernizing it.

51:42.130 --> 51:55.958
Instead of going back and doing the job that the FDA should have done better in the beginning of the pandemic with regulating all of the new medical devices that are now on the market, he's just gonna ignore that and try to rush forward into the future and approve more things.

51:58.560 --> 52:02.222
Alzheimer's disease, I'd like to see more in the neurodegenerative space.

52:03.302 --> 52:09.370
A lot of angst and panic about layoffs at the FDA.

52:10.251 --> 52:11.914
Was it bloated?

52:12.875 --> 52:14.257
Did it need restructuring?

52:14.297 --> 52:15.979
Is 15% a big number?

52:15.999 --> 52:18.623
What's going on here?

52:18.703 --> 52:19.103
Something's red.

52:20.854 --> 52:21.455
Oh, that's fine.

52:22.135 --> 52:22.436
That's good.

52:22.456 --> 52:32.906
In terms of layoffs, Doctor, because there are some people that say it's going to safeguarding the drugs that come into this country, manufactured elsewhere, are at risk now.

52:32.946 --> 52:34.708
There's not enough people to monitor.

52:36.089 --> 52:38.372
What do you make of that, that criticism?

52:39.571 --> 52:40.391
Oh, that's not true.

52:40.511 --> 52:47.315
So there were no layoffs to scientific reviewers or inspectors or our law enforcement division at the FDA.

52:48.055 --> 52:52.918
You know, we do inspections around the world and we're leveling the playing field on that front.

52:53.478 --> 52:55.399
But there were early retirement.

52:55.439 --> 53:02.283
Did you know that the FDA inspects the places around the world that make the precursor drugs that we use?

53:02.443 --> 53:06.545
It's a crazy organization that if a lot of people retired from it,

53:07.325 --> 53:09.546
unexpectedly or unpredictably.

53:10.527 --> 53:19.031
They could be in an awful lot of trouble and this clown and Vinayak Prasad are not in a professional position to do anything.

53:19.151 --> 53:22.632
They don't have a network of people they can recruit from or something like that.

53:22.692 --> 53:25.854
These people are truly, truly placed

53:26.761 --> 53:28.622
scripted frauds.

53:29.163 --> 53:33.846
And so we're actively hiring scientific reviewers.

53:33.946 --> 53:39.790
Normally there's a vacancy rate because there's a turnover in scientific reviewers, but no scientific reviewers were laid off.

53:40.090 --> 53:44.312
There were tremendous redundancies in the empire building culture.

53:44.973 --> 53:47.034
Oh, so there was a lot of redundancies.

53:47.094 --> 53:49.196
And so, you know, we didn't lose too many people.

53:49.236 --> 53:50.837
We had a lot of people we didn't need.

53:51.909 --> 53:54.830
the fiefdoms of the centers at the FDA.

53:55.311 --> 53:58.412
And they became their own independent organizations.

53:58.492 --> 54:00.633
And they had very little accountability.

54:01.014 --> 54:03.295
They had their own revenue stream from user fees.

54:03.335 --> 54:05.536
And they had redundant services as a result.

54:05.576 --> 54:08.357
That is, we had 12 different travel offices.

54:08.737 --> 54:15.101
We had nearly 2,000 HR people and budget and procurement staff.

54:15.141 --> 54:17.322
And a lot of it was just because of the center

54:17.802 --> 54:18.863
fiefdom culture.

54:18.923 --> 54:27.849
So we've consolidated that now to say, if we're going to launch AI for the FDA reviewers, as we recently did, we're going to do it agency-wide.

54:27.909 --> 54:33.113
It's not going to be each center independently with their own IT teams coming up with a product.

54:33.173 --> 54:35.394
Just look at our adverse event reporting.

54:35.494 --> 54:44.481
It's remarkable that he has just said it over and over and over again on this podcast and others, that they are just going to use AI to review things.

54:47.792 --> 54:48.796
It's crazy.

54:50.205 --> 54:50.625
systems.

54:51.046 --> 54:52.747
They are so clunky, Joe.

54:53.107 --> 54:57.611
We have one for vaccines called VAERS, one for devices called MOD.

54:57.952 --> 55:01.314
We have VAERS and CARES and FAERS and Sentinel.

55:01.334 --> 55:06.759
We have 10 different adverse event reporting systems, all sort of independently developed.

55:06.779 --> 55:07.880
We're going to go to one.

55:08.240 --> 55:17.188
And so that way, we can have a great user interface and a great database of adverse events that we can use for our post-market surveillance of drugs.

55:18.161 --> 55:21.944
Doctor, I also wanted to ask you about your quest to make the FDA more transparent.

55:21.964 --> 55:28.688
And part of that was yesterday releasing more than 200 rejection letters, as you had mentioned before, to the public.

55:28.748 --> 55:40.576
So the public can actually see why a drug was rejected, as opposed to getting a press release from the company, which may or may not give the full details or may have spin involved, et cetera.

55:41.136 --> 55:43.278
The letters were from 2020 to 2024.

55:45.399 --> 55:50.963
And investors at least are wondering if it's going to be more real time, because that's the only way it's really going to be useful.

55:52.544 --> 55:53.285
Yeah, let me be clear.

55:53.405 --> 55:58.368
Investors are worried that these letters are going to be released in a not a very timely manner.

55:58.408 --> 56:04.273
So sometimes they might be, I might be able to act on it as an investor, and sometimes they might be too late.

56:05.379 --> 56:07.461
Eric, Melissa, it's going to be real time.

56:07.501 --> 56:12.525
That was just the initial batch because we need time to do the human redaction of those letters.

56:13.005 --> 56:21.652
So I know some media outlets were, you know, hours after our announcement saying, oh, some of the you know, this is only part of the of the stack of all the letters.

56:22.353 --> 56:25.856
We're we have thousands of letters that we are redacting.

56:25.896 --> 56:27.097
We're going to make them public.

56:28.157 --> 56:37.484
Drug developers and inventors are going to be able to go through them and see not just how the FDA thinks, but how one study section of the FDA thinks, the study section of interest.

56:37.985 --> 56:41.907
And we're going to be releasing them in real time as we make decisions.

56:42.268 --> 56:47.031
And that way, shareholders will be able to see exactly what the FDA said.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.333
Look, markets like predictability.

56:49.693 --> 56:51.634
And I've been doing a CEO listening tour.

56:52.175 --> 56:53.896
We're about two-thirds the way through.

56:53.956 --> 56:55.277
It's in seven cities.

56:55.717 --> 57:07.224
And when we meet with pharmaceutical CEOs in private, that is where they can be open and honest about their ideas for reforming the FDA without their shareholders listening, they tell us they want more predictability.

57:07.424 --> 57:15.970
They want to know exactly how the FDA thinks, and they want better communication so they can, you know, once... I really want to say who gives an...

57:16.730 --> 57:17.531
you know, right now.

57:17.611 --> 57:29.318
I really want to yell it because he has said for months that he is concerned with what CEOs want from the FDA.

57:30.883 --> 57:35.765
He has repeatedly said that the FDA is in the way.

57:36.025 --> 57:37.306
It is a relic.

57:37.606 --> 57:44.349
It is in need of modernization, which is code for need of removal.

57:44.629 --> 57:48.711
Effectively, this is the destruction of the FDA.

57:53.510 --> 58:06.141
CEO said if we could just have a couple 15 minute calls with the FDA review team along the process, it could save us nearly a year of doing things just out of guesswork and trying to figure out what the FDA wants.

58:06.421 --> 58:08.102
So we're going to be radically transparent.

58:10.104 --> 58:11.005
When can you come back?

58:13.342 --> 58:14.082
I love your show.

58:14.403 --> 58:21.486
I'd like to see fewer direct-to-consumer drug ads on your show, but I love your show, and I'll come back.

58:21.526 --> 58:29.790
I was just going to say I want to talk to you about that, because I still want this purple pill that's on nightly news every night.

58:29.890 --> 58:30.891
I don't know what it does.

58:31.211 --> 58:32.092
I have no idea.

58:32.252 --> 58:34.333
But they make me want it so much.

58:34.373 --> 58:36.474
I've been bugging my doctor, give me that purple pill.

58:37.214 --> 58:38.875
I mean, it's crazy doctor.

58:38.935 --> 58:44.878
Why do we need if your doctor knee if you need something does the doctor need to be sold on?

58:44.978 --> 58:50.360
Something on on TV for him to prescribe the or her to prescribe the right thing for you.

58:50.400 --> 58:51.761
What's what's the whole rationale?

58:52.441 --> 58:53.682
behind all these things.

58:53.802 --> 58:58.544
All I know about are side effects I never want to get all over my body.

58:59.324 --> 59:00.545
That's all I know from these things.

59:00.625 --> 59:04.366
And I see overweight people marching along the street.

59:04.426 --> 59:05.287
Where are they going?

59:05.627 --> 59:07.788
What are all these things, and why do we need them?

59:09.172 --> 59:11.053
Yeah, they're always singing and dancing.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.814
They're always singing and dancing.

59:12.854 --> 59:14.695
And we have a regulation at the FDA.

59:14.755 --> 59:17.476
And I know sometimes you're at home, totally healthy.

59:17.496 --> 59:20.438
You just get back from the gym and you're watching these ads nonstop.

59:20.458 --> 59:22.379
And you want to say, OK, I give up.

59:22.419 --> 59:22.879
I'll take it.

59:22.899 --> 59:23.319
I'll take it.

59:23.339 --> 59:24.120
I don't know what it is.

59:24.140 --> 59:25.100
I don't know what it is.

59:26.221 --> 59:26.921
But I don't want to.

59:26.961 --> 59:32.124
Look, there's a regulation that says there should not be a misleading impression from these ads.

59:32.264 --> 59:33.685
And so we're taking a hard look at that.

59:37.925 --> 59:39.339
Sometimes it makes me very sad.

59:51.806 --> 59:52.807
Your attention, please.

59:52.847 --> 59:53.748
Your attention, please.

59:53.828 --> 59:55.029
I have an announcement to make.

59:55.509 --> 59:56.270
I'm bored.

59:56.730 --> 59:57.450
Ha ha!

59:57.811 --> 59:59.032
You think you're bored?

59:59.392 --> 01:00:02.294
What about all those poor suckers out there in the audience?

01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:03.775
Ah, yeah.

01:00:03.855 --> 01:00:07.058
They just keep praying that their category is next.

01:00:07.658 --> 01:00:12.783
Well, as long as they are praying and while we're at it, I get to anoint their feet.

01:00:13.303 --> 01:00:16.405
You keep your hands off me, you little twink, or I'll call the cops.

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:18.307
My daddy's a cop.

01:00:18.467 --> 01:00:20.509
His breath smells like cat food.

01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:27.062
And that, my friends, is how I make a living.

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:34.605
And holy shit, my friends, this is how I make a living.

01:00:35.145 --> 01:00:36.885
I can't believe it, but it's true.

01:00:36.905 --> 01:00:41.166
Giga Home Biological, your consciousness is prime real estate.

01:00:41.206 --> 01:00:42.667
These people are playing for.

01:00:43.787 --> 01:00:45.888
No one has gotten this far.

01:00:46.588 --> 01:00:48.688
No one has gotten this far.

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:50.649
Do you hear me?

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.170
No one has gotten this far.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:01:14.174
This is a picture with me, and with Suzanne Humphries, and Paul Thomas, and James Lyons Weiler, and Pauly Tommy, and Mary Holland, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Brian Hooker.

01:01:15.415 --> 01:01:17.755
No one has gotten this far, ladies and gentlemen, no one.

01:01:30.993 --> 01:01:32.394
That is live.

01:01:32.454 --> 01:01:33.434
He's in the garage.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.581
Think about this for a second.

01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:45.821
Watch these words.

01:01:47.462 --> 01:01:48.523
Watch these words.

01:02:08.834 --> 01:02:11.316
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the protocols were manslaughter.

01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:18.922
Gain of function is a mythology, and the Scooby-Doo mystery that they fooled us into solving is definitely real, and the spectacular commitment to lies is what sustains it.

01:02:19.623 --> 01:02:23.486
You can see through it if you understand that supplementary oxygen causes ARDS.

01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:28.070
Virology is just synthetic DNA and RNA transfected into cell culture in animals.

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:33.194
Placebo batches would have been the easiest way for the signal from transfection not to be noticed.

01:02:33.855 --> 01:02:37.157
And, of course, intramuscular injection is a very dumb idea.

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:40.038
from the late 1800s.

01:02:40.078 --> 01:02:42.099
They've sustained this, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:44.379
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.880
And I have lied.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:47.940
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.860
I don't want to lie.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.121
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:51.861
I'm trying to be a liar.

01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:52.721
I don't want to be a liar.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:58.643
Brian Hooker, Kevin McKernan, Nick Hudson, Jessica Rose, Mike Eden, they're all in the same script.

01:02:59.183 --> 01:03:00.983
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:04.304
Big Mike doesn't want anything to do with these people.

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:08.470
He's still medium, Mike, I would say.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:13.493
I tease him quite regularly that he better go to sleep and get growing, because he's not as big as I want him to be.

01:03:13.513 --> 01:03:18.475
I don't think he's going to reach 215 pounds, which is what I wanted him to be.

01:03:19.516 --> 01:03:20.916
But he will be a big little boy.

01:03:20.936 --> 01:03:22.477
He's a good little boy.

01:03:22.517 --> 01:03:23.358
That's the important thing.

01:03:23.378 --> 01:03:24.658
I got to train him not to bite.

01:03:25.319 --> 01:03:30.541
He is a Great Pyrenee that bites a lot more than I think a lot of Great Pyrenees bite.

01:03:30.581 --> 01:03:31.322
Maybe I'm dumb.

01:03:31.402 --> 01:03:32.042
Maybe they bite.

01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:35.185
He's got a good prey instinct.

01:03:35.665 --> 01:03:37.448
He's a killer.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:42.093
So when he's hungry, he smiles at you and chomps his teeth.

01:03:43.044 --> 01:03:44.145
He's hilarious.

01:03:44.225 --> 01:03:46.305
He also, oh, biting stops after one year.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:48.006
Thank goodness.

01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:51.227
Because right now he bites me in my face when he's hungry.

01:03:52.088 --> 01:03:55.169
And it's very loving and very hilarious.

01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:58.390
But as his head gets bigger, the joke is less funny.

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.631
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't, I do bite him back.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:10.175
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, if you don't understand why buying a red hat or a blue hat, it don't matter.

01:04:11.355 --> 01:04:18.139
You you really are not there yet, and you've got to learn because you've got to teach your kids We must teach our kids.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:20.780
That's the trick if we don't teach our kids.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.783
This is all over You want to leave a voicemail like I played at the beginning of the pan of the stream?

01:04:26.823 --> 01:04:31.125
Please call 4 1 2 4 2 3 6 3 4 3 leave a voicemail.

01:04:31.225 --> 01:04:34.047
I'll play it Thank you for being here

01:04:35.227 --> 01:04:38.971
This is GigaOM Biological coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:43.215
A friend of mine, Mark Kulak, comes to you live from Boston, Massachusetts.

01:04:43.295 --> 01:04:46.619
Housatonic Live is found at housatonicits.com.

01:04:46.659 --> 01:04:48.821
Great website, lots of resource there.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:51.904
Nothing like that do I offer.

01:04:52.324 --> 01:04:55.467
Quite frankly, he is a very humbling operation.

01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:57.970
This substack is great.

01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.932
It's about the murder in Scotland.

01:05:00.873 --> 01:05:03.617
Lots of testimonial in video form there.

01:05:03.677 --> 01:05:04.818
Worth checking out.

01:05:05.639 --> 01:05:13.408
And the artistry of Ned at nedamphilianamphilon substack.com.

01:05:13.428 --> 01:05:14.669
Sorry for butchering that, Ned.

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.071
Great guy, great artist.

01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:19.193
He may help me with a book.

01:05:19.233 --> 01:05:23.676
I'm not really sure how possible that is, although he's got so much already done.

01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:26.298
I can certainly feature some of it in the book to come.

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:33.023
I'm very, very excited to share some more truth with you, at least as far as I've found it.

01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:34.784
If you would like a

01:05:36.275 --> 01:05:51.142
a uh you know I can also put some early COVID survivor stickers in there too just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Dr. JMPO Box 802 Bethel Park Pennsylvania 15102 and uh we'll get you some swag um

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.111
I do not have any hats.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.892
There's a lot of people asking for hats.

01:05:57.172 --> 01:05:58.012
I don't have hats.

01:05:58.273 --> 01:06:01.775
I will, but that's quite a commitment financially.

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:03.356
And right now we're kind of in the hole.

01:06:05.137 --> 01:06:12.481
And I'm trying to stay focused on the biology because if I don't stay focused on the biology, I start swearing a lot.

01:06:13.222 --> 01:06:15.863
If I don't stay focused on the biology,

01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:20.427
I'm lost.

01:06:21.288 --> 01:06:28.095
If I don't stay focused on the biology, instead I pay attention to clowns on Rumble or on other podcasts.

01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:31.759
I gotta stay focused like this bird is focused, focused.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.382
America needs to be focused on this biology.

01:06:35.043 --> 01:06:37.844
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

01:06:37.864 --> 01:06:49.666
And if not, you might be a skilled TV watcher, a skilled social media user who needs reminding on how to stay focused on the biology, maybe needs to be shown how not to take the bait on social media, maybe needs to be reminded of who their neighbors are.

01:06:50.726 --> 01:06:53.187
That's what Gig Owen Biological is trying to do.

01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:57.708
Folks could sew that Velcro thing on the hat.

01:06:57.768 --> 01:06:58.788
That's true, they could.

01:06:59.768 --> 01:07:01.990
I don't think it would look very good, but they could.

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:03.251
Yes, they definitely could.

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.532
Catherine, always thinking.

01:07:05.573 --> 01:07:12.318
Catherine, I got a big box of stuff from a beehive in case that was something you are not aware of yet.

01:07:12.438 --> 01:07:13.319
I'm very happy.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.621
Yes, please take me up on that.

01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:19.323
Send the freaking envelope, please.

01:07:19.343 --> 01:07:19.624
Of course.

01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:25.528
As I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic.

01:07:25.668 --> 01:07:28.331
There was no pandemic and there will be no pandemic.

01:07:29.193 --> 01:07:29.394
And um...

01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:36.323
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't handle it, it can't.

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:40.765
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:07:41.946 --> 01:07:45.828
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

01:07:46.268 --> 01:07:47.628
So it's remarkable, right?

01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:51.931
I think that basically he was told that that's what he needed to tell me.

01:07:52.751 --> 01:08:00.335
At the time, I still really wasn't able to hammer home the intramuscular injections, just a dumb idea from the 1800s, but I was close.

01:08:01.896 --> 01:08:04.478
And so, you know, I don't know what to tell you anymore.

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:05.559
Am I pessimistic?

01:08:06.179 --> 01:08:07.700
Not so much as I used to be.

01:08:08.481 --> 01:08:15.607
And the reason why is because my pessimism was derived from the idea that I wouldn't be able to change the minds of any of these people.

01:08:16.828 --> 01:08:27.917
Now that I've accepted the fact that I'm not gonna be able to change the minds of any of these people, and that actually a significant portion of their followings will never be open to the possibilities that I'm offering,

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:41.047
I realized that there's this whole other part of the country, whole other part of the earth that has no idea who these performing dipshitters are because they've never clicked the right buttons.

01:08:41.308 --> 01:08:43.511
They've never clicked on the right links.

01:08:44.963 --> 01:08:57.131
And so these people are probably very open to the idea that America has been bamboozled by a whole crew of idiots that might have been fielded by a team of advisors that might include some of these people.

01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:58.652
They might be very open to that.

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:10.400
Some place like the Netherlands might be very interested to see how many podcasts did Robert Malone, the farmer and homesteader, do just with Dutch influential podcasters?

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.721
I can find at least five.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:13.862
That's pretty remarkable.

01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:17.390
It's not the only country on earth.

01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:20.352
He can't speak Dutch.

01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:25.797
Ik kan wel een beetje Nederlands praten, maar niemand is mij aan het bellen.
[I can speak a little Dutch, but no one is calling me.]

01:09:26.738 --> 01:09:27.619
Ik snap dat ook niet.
[I don't get that either.]

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.441
Maar dat is de waarheid.
[But that's the truth.]

01:09:30.521 --> 01:09:31.822
Nu, echt, nu.
[Now, really, now.]

01:09:32.263 --> 01:09:37.247
Je hebt een Amerikaanse man met een alletoner buitenkant.
[You have an American man with an all-toner exterior.]

01:09:38.088 --> 01:09:41.151
Die kan heel goed Nederlands praten voor iemand die niet daar woont.
[He can speak Dutch very well for someone who doesn't live there]

01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:47.159
En niemand in Nederland is curieus over wie is dit man?
[And nobody in the Netherlands is curious about who this man is?]

01:09:47.199 --> 01:09:48.220
Hij zit in dit boek.
[He's in this book.]

01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:53.504
Hij zit in de eerste pagina van de boek van Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[He's on the front page of the book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:57.648
En ze hebben niet gevraagd. Wat is aan de hand in Amerika, yo?
[And they didn't ask. What's going on in America, yo?]

01:09:59.649 --> 01:10:00.910
Niemand is gevraagd.
[Nobody asked.]

01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:08.517
And that is because this is a joke, okay?

01:10:08.957 --> 01:10:10.798
That's why this is happening, because

01:10:11.718 --> 01:10:12.964
Where's my mousy mouse?

01:10:13.606 --> 01:10:14.490
Down, over.

01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:17.683
This is a joke, right?

01:10:18.403 --> 01:10:19.944
It's unacceptable.

01:10:20.104 --> 01:10:21.484
We will not call autism.

01:10:21.624 --> 01:10:23.185
I don't like the word autism.

01:10:24.065 --> 01:10:25.006
He was vaccine damaged.

01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:44.234
It is unacceptable at this stage for us to be the only stream that can explain, the only source of information on the internet that says that autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injections never questioned, that virology is never questioned, that public health is never questioned.

01:10:45.563 --> 01:11:00.147
It is absolutely impossible for this not to be a national if not global news story that somebody who is employed by that current Health and Human Services Secretary as a scientific advisor for more than a year

01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:10.527
is now going public to say that that guy and Jay Bhattacharya and probably Marty McCurry are all scripted frauds that don't belong where they are.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:15.288
They are scripted frauds just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:15.368 --> 01:11:17.089
is and I believed in him.

01:11:17.109 --> 01:11:25.211
And I can explain how I was played.

01:11:25.271 --> 01:11:28.612
I can drop names on how I was played and I'm not proud of it.

01:11:29.053 --> 01:11:29.893
I'm ashamed of it.

01:11:31.032 --> 01:11:47.905
because I lost my father-in-law, I lost my sister-in-law, I lost a girlfriend from my youth, and I lost my best friend from college, like the guy that I most looked up to on this earth as a fellow human.

01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:51.848
All to this shit.

01:11:53.686 --> 01:12:05.070
And it's all because I fell for this and all the people that came to my house and texted my wife and put me on signal and telegram and whatever, they're all responsible for this in my mind.

01:12:05.811 --> 01:12:07.951
They all deserve a knuckle sandwich from me.

01:12:11.693 --> 01:12:20.096
They all deserve to have the inside of their knee kicked to the side while they have all their weight on that leg.

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.086
That's how I feel.

01:12:23.646 --> 01:12:32.093
And I don't know what to do about that sometime other than to explain to people that that should be a clue to you how serious this is.

01:12:34.054 --> 01:12:35.656
Because I'm not afraid to say it.

01:12:37.397 --> 01:12:42.561
You know, if you go online and you say that people are bad when they're not bad, that's not good.

01:12:42.641 --> 01:12:46.344
If you go online and say things people did that they didn't do, that's not good.

01:12:47.825 --> 01:12:48.586
But I'm not doing that.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.023
And more importantly, these people that I'm talking about know that I'm not doing that.

01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:59.826
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:59.846 --> 01:13:00.967
I'm not screwing around.

01:13:01.027 --> 01:13:04.569
I'm trying to plant trees under whose shade I will never shelter.

01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:16.117
I'm trying to plant the seed of knowledge that our children and our grandchildren will use to shed the shackles of these assholes.

01:13:18.039 --> 01:13:20.661
And I think the truth is right here in front of you.

01:13:21.451 --> 01:13:26.394
Intramuscular injection as medicine is a dumb idea from the late 1800s, and that's it.

01:13:27.255 --> 01:13:28.396
The rest is lemmings.

01:13:28.676 --> 01:13:29.917
The rest is assumptions.

01:13:30.477 --> 01:13:31.778
The rest is yeah, buts.

01:13:36.902 --> 01:13:39.223
Autism spectrum disorder is an illusion.

01:13:39.724 --> 01:13:42.225
Pandemics and gain of function are mythologies.

01:13:43.426 --> 01:13:47.209
And the autism spectrum disorder thing is very, very simple.

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.690
The more

01:13:50.038 --> 01:14:09.169
symptomologies that you include, the more developmental trajectories that you include, the more varied groups of symptoms that you include in autism spectrum disorder, the less likely it is that somebody like 2013 Brian Hooker will be able to make any progress with regard to my son doesn't have autism.

01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:10.489
I don't like the word autism.

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:12.130
My son was vaccine injured.

01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:15.212
He was neurologically damaged by injection.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:34.780
And the way to cure that problem is to make all these other people with legitimate, I don't know what you call them, disease, disorders, sicknesses, conditions, all think that they fall under this spectrum.

01:14:36.881 --> 01:14:45.945
That's the illusion that James Lyons Weiler, that Brian Hooker, that Mary Holland, that Polly Tommy, that Andrew Wakefield,

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.044
that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.306
have been conscripted to sustain.

01:14:51.607 --> 01:14:52.367
Is it the MMR?

01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:53.168
Is it DDP?

01:14:53.228 --> 01:14:53.928
Is it multiple?

01:14:53.988 --> 01:14:55.369
Is it during an ear infection?

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.551
Is it the Tylenol afterward?

01:14:59.752 --> 01:15:02.795
This is not a scramble for the truth.

01:15:02.935 --> 01:15:07.298
This is a malevolent obfuscation of it because the truth is very simple.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:13.901
and there is no one else on earth, no one else on the internet who is saying it.

01:15:14.361 --> 01:15:16.943
That's gotta be something worth sharing.

01:15:18.564 --> 01:15:22.126
It's gotta be something where you're like, you know what, screw it, I'm gonna email this to everyone.

01:15:22.166 --> 01:15:28.571
Just like you heard that guy say in the voicemail at the beginning of the show.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:37.093
At some point, this has to move you enough to take drastic action because it's as simple as this.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:38.614
You don't need to go any farther.

01:15:39.214 --> 01:15:42.116
This should be enough to spur people to do their own work.

01:15:43.256 --> 01:15:50.140
Anybody that's already at the threshold of accepting that something isn't right is capable of processing this screen.

01:15:54.762 --> 01:15:58.824
So why would there be a health freedom movement that's fake in America?

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.220
The answer is on the slide with Pauly Tommy.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.961
It's worth millions of votes.

01:16:05.641 --> 01:16:08.041
The answer is in the war room of Steve Bannon.

01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:09.642
It's worth millions of votes.

01:16:11.082 --> 01:16:12.342
The answer is on Rumble.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:19.883
It's worth millions in sales of ivermectin, millions in sales of nonsense.

01:16:21.524 --> 01:16:25.844
That's why there's a fake health freedom movement in America, but all that's a disguise.

01:16:27.525 --> 01:16:28.865
Those people are the easy,

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:35.139
witting and unwitting participants because they're poor, because they like attention.

01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:40.443
They imagine they're taking advantage of their good looks, whatever, I don't know.

01:16:41.484 --> 01:16:46.408
Moving up the ladder, maybe they'll be on Nightly News or they'll get to have a podcast like Joe Rogan someday.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:57.357
You know, that's the illusion that Joe Rogan has cast on everybody, that if you're really good and you really get enough listeners, you can get $100 million contract from Spotify.

01:16:58.942 --> 01:16:59.703
Stop lying!

01:17:00.644 --> 01:17:01.484
So why do we have it?

01:17:01.645 --> 01:17:13.315
I think we have a fake health freedom movement in America that goes all the way back to recruiting somebody like Brian Hooker to say it right and to build a big top tent of health freedom.

01:17:13.376 --> 01:17:19.261
The reason why we have a fake health freedom movement is because intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:17:22.796 --> 01:17:29.064
Because autism spectrum disorder is a mythology that needs a fake health freedom movement to sustain.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:37.115
Because pandemics and gain of function are mythologies that need a fake health freedom movement to sustain.

01:17:37.175 --> 01:17:38.437
That's why we have it.

01:17:40.967 --> 01:17:49.472
And if you wanna learn about it, you wanna investigate it, you gotta go back to 2013 when Brian didn't say autism, didn't like the word.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:57.717
You gotta go back to 2015 when Mary Holland and Paul Offit were opposite each other on Democracy Now.

01:17:57.737 --> 01:18:04.902
You gotta go back to 2016 when the Vax movie was produced by these foreign traders where they recruited

01:18:05.662 --> 01:18:16.392
and really seemed to absorb Brian Hooker, established Mary Holland, established Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield here, and this false narrative about the MMR not being tested.

01:18:17.873 --> 01:18:23.438
Then you got to look at 17, 18, and 19, because that's where all these health freedom people were going bananas.

01:18:24.138 --> 01:18:32.686
And Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were meeting each other and starting to build their own network, starting to put up billboards around the United States.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.414
that said there is no safe vaccine.

01:18:36.857 --> 01:18:41.578
And then you gotta go back to 2020, after all the times that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:42.078 --> 01:18:47.900
and Judy Mikovits and all these posers were on stage with those two, that they were both killed in 2020.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.141
You gotta go all the way back then, because I think that's what this is.

01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:54.762
How do you make a health freedom movement is very simple.

01:18:55.182 --> 01:19:06.205
You put a bunch of these shitheads on stage with Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn, and get them to say all the things that Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn are saying right up until the beginning of the pandemic, and then stop.

01:19:07.819 --> 01:19:08.499
right at the end.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.521
And now make it about freedom and make it about mandates.

01:19:19.263 --> 01:19:27.585
And then we'll be here with Judy Mikovits, Paul Thomas, Brian Hooker, Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., et cetera.

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:30.866
That's how it works.

01:19:30.926 --> 01:19:31.846
That's how it happened.

01:19:34.107 --> 01:19:35.447
You can't change their script.

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:36.828
I thought I could.

01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:38.909
I really did.

01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:41.372
That's the reason why I was so angry for so long.

01:19:41.412 --> 01:19:45.617
Now that I've accepted that I can't change their script, the anger is subsiding.

01:19:46.118 --> 01:19:48.120
The frustration is subsiding.

01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:54.948
More comfortable sharing their personal experiences with mental health, a sign that the stigma surrounding it is diminishing.

01:19:55.649 --> 01:20:01.591
On Instagram and TikTok combined, there are nearly 90 million posts with the hashtag mental health.

01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:07.573
And terms like gaslighting, trauma, and toxic relationships are now part of everyday conversation.

01:20:08.173 --> 01:20:11.194
But not all the information online is accurate.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:19.037
Stephanie Sy spoke with Tyesha Caldwell Harvey, a psychologist and founder of the private practice, The Black Girl Doctor.

01:20:19.757 --> 01:20:25.059
Tyesha, how do you see social media contributing to misinformation about mental health?

01:20:26.104 --> 01:20:42.899
yes there's so much now what's being portrayed here is extremely malevolent because essentially social media is useful social media is beneficial to society but there's also these niggly problems of misinformation and people making living

01:20:44.779 --> 01:20:54.721
selling things that have no, you know, kind of like an unregulated space, you know, where people are selling medical and food stuff.

01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:55.622
Yeah.

01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:56.082
Anyway.

01:20:56.462 --> 01:21:02.403
Seeing really anybody right now can say anything that they want to on the internet and about any topic.

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:04.944
So are we going to have the FDA regulate that?

01:21:05.624 --> 01:21:10.525
The speech on the internet, because right now the FDA does regulate or supposed to regulate the labels.

01:21:11.564 --> 01:21:12.625
you know, safe and effective.

01:21:12.645 --> 01:21:17.569
Maybe they'll also regulate the safe and effective claims on these.

01:21:18.109 --> 01:21:19.951
Maybe they'll get people to advocate for that.

01:21:19.991 --> 01:21:21.111
Do you see where this is going?

01:21:21.151 --> 01:21:22.913
This is the other side of the coin, of course.

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:26.496
This is PBS NewsHour, the most terrifying,

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.821
propaganda network on earth.

01:21:29.121 --> 01:21:39.328
And while in a way that can be really good, it also means that, you know, the rate at which something spreads like wildfire has nothing to do with how accurate the information is.

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.090
And right now we're seeing so many.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:43.090
That's for sure.

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:51.896
Because the accuracy of Houston tonic ITS and giga Ohm biological would have necessarily dictated that everyone on earth would own a hat by now.

01:21:54.704 --> 01:22:03.526
creators, and people just sharing their experiences online, but equating their experience to a reality for others and to fact.

01:22:03.646 --> 01:22:05.606
And it's just not really, it's not really true.

01:22:06.106 --> 01:22:20.228
To what extent do you think social media, the misinformation, the self-diagnoses leads to people sort of pathologizing what might be considered more normal emotions and stress responses that we all have?

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:23.209
And what are the potential risks of doing that?

01:22:24.082 --> 01:22:32.309
Yeah, I think one of the huge dangers really is invalidating or downplaying mental illness by equating it to symptoms of a diagnosis.

01:22:32.849 --> 01:22:46.860
And so we can all experience anxiety, we can all experience sadness, periods of high distractibility, but that doesn't mean that you have an anxiety disorder, it doesn't mean that you have depression, it doesn't mean that you're neurodivergent, and it doesn't

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:53.323
Neurodivergent is also something that's now, you know, it overlaps with the autism spectrum disorder.

01:22:53.363 --> 01:22:54.543
It's, wow.

01:22:54.944 --> 01:22:57.365
Does it mean that you have PTSD?

01:22:57.385 --> 01:23:07.169
Don't forget, we watched a video a couple of weeks ago of a girl who said that she basically decided to diagnose herself as autistic because of a TikTok video.

01:23:08.812 --> 01:23:10.433
It's an illusion, ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:10.473 --> 01:23:11.294
It's an enchantment.

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:13.756
They want you to believe that the internet is this powerful.

01:23:13.796 --> 01:23:17.339
They want you to believe that the internet is this dangerous so that it can be regulated.

01:23:17.379 --> 01:23:24.605
And more importantly, that they can regulate it by requiring you to use ID to use it because then they can track the misinformation to you.

01:23:25.946 --> 01:23:28.288
This is both sides of the coin here.

01:23:29.389 --> 01:23:30.670
The trap is that.

01:23:32.662 --> 01:23:42.988
language in that way can be extremely harmful to someone who has these diagnoses, because it can make them question themselves, and it also can make society more critical and less supportive.

01:23:43.429 --> 01:23:45.770
What do you think is driving this?

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:53.075
And in some ways, is having an ADHD or an autism self-diagnosis becoming sort of a form of identity?

01:23:53.874 --> 01:23:55.657
I think people look for community, right?

01:23:55.677 --> 01:24:02.907
When you're experiencing something and you want to give it language, social media can be a great place to search that term or to search and experience.

01:24:02.967 --> 01:24:05.631
These are not, this is not speaking normally.

01:24:05.691 --> 01:24:09.757
This is very trained language and it's an enchantment.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:14.512
I want to go back just a few seconds to hear exactly how she said it.

01:24:14.552 --> 01:24:18.113
It's finding other people and you know that you're not alone, which is language.

01:24:18.873 --> 01:24:20.693
Social media can be a great place to be.

01:24:21.434 --> 01:24:23.234
I think people look for community, right?

01:24:23.254 --> 01:24:25.655
When you're experiencing something and you want to give it language.

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:30.676
See, people look for community and when you're experiencing something, you want to give it language.

01:24:30.716 --> 01:24:35.117
Now, when I was a kid, I would use language that I got from books that I read.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:56.437
Language that I got from the newspaper or from magazines that I read or from people I talked to You see the danger that she's they are Defaulting to the idea that this is just the the new form of a library This is a new form of an information source.

01:24:57.137 --> 01:25:01.799
We just have to teach people to use it better This is remarkable

01:25:02.762 --> 01:25:11.785
because that means that, you know, misuse of language on the internet could potentially, I mean, how do you use a medium like that?

01:25:11.965 --> 01:25:13.366
That doesn't even make any sense.

01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:25.990
It's almost like telling somebody how, you know, if you just look at the right porn and look at the right, you know, videos, then you can make your sex life better.

01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:30.211
It's just, you know, you gotta know which ones are the right videos, I guess.

01:25:30.972 --> 01:25:31.812
Holy shit.

01:25:32.872 --> 01:25:43.839
Social media can be a great place to search that term or to search and experience and just start finding other people and you know that you're not alone, which is really powerful and oftentimes can be the first step.

01:25:43.879 --> 01:25:44.900
So it's weird, right?

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:58.088
She can't possibly, and PBS NewsHour can't possibly imagine how this might be weaponized by a military-industrial complex that wanted to permanently rule its population using social media-based myths.

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:12.098
Imagination is so shallow that they can only see this one layer of misinformation, which is just bad people being bad people.

01:26:12.139 --> 01:26:19.966
They can't imagine a coordinated layer of state actors and private actors vying for control of a populace.

01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:23.469
They can't imagine that social media would ever make that possible.

01:26:23.829 --> 01:26:25.351
This is just crazy, right?

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:28.831
that people take before they get help.

01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:32.954
And that's one of the reasons why I love that more people are talking about this.

01:26:32.994 --> 01:26:38.378
Psychologists for years have been trying to get people to get help instead of sit and suffer.

01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:47.845
My son was encouraged at the end of his freshman year to use chat GPT to build a slide deck for a presentation, I shit you not.

01:26:49.066 --> 01:26:51.208
I don't even know what to do in a scenario like that.

01:26:54.388 --> 01:26:59.630
And so now there's this cultural shift with younger millennials, Gen Z, I feel like is leading the charge.

01:27:00.391 --> 01:27:03.332
And people are hungry for language to express themselves.

01:27:03.992 --> 01:27:13.157
They want to talk about how they're feeling and they want to rid themselves of the shame and stigma and want to just live out loud and be like, I can have a full human experience.

01:27:13.317 --> 01:27:16.819
And I think that part is extremely, extremely beautiful.

01:27:17.199 --> 01:27:19.320
I think that part is extreme bullshit.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.823
What she just said there is the most malevolent, nasty talk I've ever heard.

01:27:23.843 --> 01:27:31.228
A lot of it is bullshit, but a lot of it is designed to sound very warm and comforting to, you know, Gen Z leading the way.

01:27:31.848 --> 01:27:32.568
Stop lying!

01:27:33.689 --> 01:27:34.930
Oh my gosh, it's gross.

01:27:36.263 --> 01:27:39.884
And yet it seems maybe to be an overcorrection is what you're saying.

01:27:39.924 --> 01:27:48.025
So what would you say, what advice would you give to sort of rein this back into a place where one can identify when they need to see a real therapist?

01:27:48.325 --> 01:27:48.945
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:49.145 --> 01:27:51.366
Well, one, never self-diagnose on TikTok.

01:27:51.726 --> 01:27:55.986
And I think definitely when you have a cultural shift, you often get this pendulum swing, right?

01:27:56.006 --> 01:28:02.007
And I think we have kind of swung really far in one direction, and I'm hoping we will settle back out somewhere in the middle.

01:28:02.627 --> 01:28:04.428
We know from research that 50% of all adults

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:08.109
will experience a mental illness in their lifetime.

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:19.271
And so if you're going to have people online talking about their whole life, old and loud, then we're going to have content around how we navigate and navigate our mental health and how we deal with mental illness.

01:28:19.431 --> 01:28:35.055
And so I don't think it's wrong, but I think we really need to separate what is I'm sharing my experience and somebody receiving it that way versus your experience as an individual person is so important that it deserves to be the center point of what this

01:28:35.775 --> 01:28:37.276
symptom is, right?

01:28:37.356 --> 01:28:44.581
And I think for people really needing to be careful of what you absorb and in terms of who you take advice from.

01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:46.242
Think about it like you would your physical health.

01:28:46.682 --> 01:28:52.006
Would you take advice and start taking medication from somebody on TikTok that had no qualifications?

01:28:53.086 --> 01:28:54.988
Maybe not somebody, but a couple people.

01:28:55.908 --> 01:29:01.452
Maybe if three people sat around a table and two of them were doctors, then I might take their consensus advice.

01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:04.991
That's what Rule by Podcast is, ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:05.691 --> 01:29:06.773
That's exactly what it is.

01:29:07.574 --> 01:29:10.857
It's a very easy message to say, don't trust clowns on TikTok.

01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:20.568
What's not a very easy message to say, because they're not saying it at all, is don't take advice from podcasts where three people sit around and talk about shit.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:32.227
where the soon to be NIH director sits around with a non-working former professor of his former university and talks about shit.

01:29:32.327 --> 01:29:33.547
Don't listen to that.

01:29:35.108 --> 01:29:36.009
That's the reality.

01:29:39.211 --> 01:29:41.052
So everybody's got a timeline.

01:29:42.533 --> 01:29:45.535
My timeline is very different than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:29:45.515 --> 01:29:45.555
's.

01:29:47.392 --> 01:29:52.676
It involves my former bosses in Norway winning the Nobel Prize in 2014.

01:29:52.756 --> 01:29:55.859
It involves the birth of my third kid in 2018.

01:29:55.939 --> 01:29:59.562
It involves my family moving from the Netherlands to America.

01:30:00.082 --> 01:30:13.413
And it involves a series of interferences with my work and my ability to make a living that went from, and I can just do it off the top of my head with this arrow, drastic,

01:30:14.363 --> 01:30:34.136
to Piper Stover, to the Signal Group with Brett Weinstein, to the group of people with Matt Crawford and Panda, to the group of people with Matt Crawford and the Steve Kerr Steering Committee, to the group of people at Panda with Jonathan Engler and Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson.

01:30:34.956 --> 01:30:37.338
And up here, you have my employment at Pitt.

01:30:38.553 --> 01:30:44.939
And as a neuroscientist, then you have my, my employment at Pitt where I could just stay at home because they had to pay my salary out.

01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:48.021
And so that's why I started this podcast in the first place, basically.

01:30:48.101 --> 01:30:53.426
But first I was working for my brother and this is actually the place where my brother and my parents stopped talking to me.

01:30:55.134 --> 01:31:01.201
And then at the end of 2021, this is when, when, uh, Kevin McKernan was first on my stream.

01:31:01.241 --> 01:31:03.384
And then soon after would be Jessica Rose.

01:31:03.444 --> 01:31:10.512
And then soon after, you know, we have, uh, Charles Rixey showing up at my house to get me back into drastic and accept diffuse as real.

01:31:10.532 --> 01:31:13.716
Then I got a phone call right after the murder was over.

01:31:15.489 --> 01:31:19.492
from two people on the same day, Senator Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:19.553 --> 01:31:20.774
saying they wanted me to help them.

01:31:20.794 --> 01:31:23.916
Then I got hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the red line.

01:31:23.976 --> 01:31:26.639
Then I got hired by CHD, the white line.

01:31:26.659 --> 01:31:43.113
Then I got fired at the end of 2023, the beginning of 2024 by Mary Holland and Brian Hooker for talking about Robert Malone, who Jay Bhattacharya would ask me in 2023 not to talk about 2024, not to talk about because he was gonna be NIH director soon.

01:31:47.239 --> 01:31:49.281
Everybody's got a timeline, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:50.502 --> 01:31:51.623
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:31:51.603 --> 01:31:55.167
's timeline is that of a traitor, a scripted one.

01:31:55.207 --> 01:31:59.671
The timeline of Robert Malone's is a long time scripted traitor.

01:32:00.111 --> 01:32:06.537
The timeline of Brian Hooker reveals somebody who could say it correctly in 2013 and then was recruited.

01:32:07.498 --> 01:32:11.302
The timeline of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark ends abruptly in 2020 with death.

01:32:17.722 --> 01:32:26.665
The timeline of all of these organizations ends in traitors, ends in scripted frauds.

01:32:27.505 --> 01:32:29.166
And I'm talking about all of them.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:36.968
They were all put in place from the very beginning to make sure that we would blame the novel virus for all the effects of transfection.

01:32:37.448 --> 01:32:41.569
We would get confused with this spike protein and all of its novel inserts.

01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:49.895
And they keep this, they are maintaining this illusion of consensus.

01:32:50.095 --> 01:32:57.626
Even inside of the Trump administration, there are all of these people that are maintaining this illusion of consensus about a novel virus.

01:32:58.528 --> 01:33:01.813
Millions of people were killed by, not by opioids, but by a virus.

01:33:03.595 --> 01:33:20.070
That's what changed the life expectancy in America, and that's illusion of consensus about that is sustained by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., by Jessica Rose, by Kevin McKernan, and by Jay Bhattacharya, all of whom don't seem to be able to do that simple math at all.

01:33:20.811 --> 01:33:22.153
It is a provided script.

01:33:22.874 --> 01:33:32.245
That's why this fake international fraud named Mike Yeadon has been on my show twice but still doesn't really seem to get it.

01:33:32.626 --> 01:33:40.195
Still calls me JJ and is going out of his way even spelling her name to promote the substack of Sasha Latapova.

01:33:44.198 --> 01:33:47.522
That's why you can see the script on X so easily.

01:33:47.562 --> 01:33:49.164
How many of these people are on X?

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:50.386
Because it's a fraud.

01:33:50.666 --> 01:33:51.367
It's a script.

01:33:51.847 --> 01:34:02.781
And the script is taking place on specifically Substack and X to make these platforms owned by these assholes globally relevant.

01:34:04.397 --> 01:34:06.559
That's what Robert Malone's job really is.

01:34:06.619 --> 01:34:08.980
That's what CHD's job really is.

01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:19.208
That's what they're ultimately using all of this fake health freedom movement for, this fake conservative populist movement that Steve Bannon is part of.

01:34:19.268 --> 01:34:33.239
That's all to create the illusion that there is a populist movement that exists outside of national borders, that exists freely on the internet and is composed of all these international people, including a,

01:34:35.145 --> 01:34:49.701
a former employee of the CDC from Poland who actively, you know, talked about Kaprowski until I said something and then immediately went nuts and now supposedly is being blocked by Kevin McKernan.

01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:51.302
But that's all an illusion.

01:34:52.045 --> 01:35:03.910
That's why they had months and months of arguing and, you know, calling each other names and, and, and, and Nick Hudson got involved and Sasha Latipova got involved and there were all kinds of gifts.

01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:10.673
And then later on, Jikki Leaks got involved and we tried, but it didn't matter because it's a show.

01:35:10.733 --> 01:35:12.114
They don't even see our posts.

01:35:13.334 --> 01:35:15.175
Nick Hudson interacting with all of them.

01:35:15.235 --> 01:35:16.636
It's all an illusion.

01:35:17.665 --> 01:35:23.809
That's the reason why in 2020, he said, he said worst case scenario.

01:35:23.949 --> 01:35:25.810
In 2024, he said worst case scenario.

01:35:25.890 --> 01:35:30.252
And in between there, he spent three years streaming about me.

01:35:35.094 --> 01:35:39.775
And that's why in 2025, they're finally blowing the lid off SIDS.

01:35:40.195 --> 01:36:00.120
That's why in 2025, Kevin McCairn is being streamed a couple times on Steve Kirsch's VRSF Vaccine Safety Research Foundation to talk about the spike-induced brain injury and why all of them have decided from Mary Holland to Mike Eden to Kevin McCairn to

01:36:01.906 --> 01:36:09.312
Peter Bregan and Ginger Bregan to Jane Ruby to all promote the ever insightful Sasha Latipov.

01:36:09.372 --> 01:36:15.717
Don't forget that she was on my stream as one of the first performances she ever did in this narrative about batches.

01:36:16.157 --> 01:36:19.440
And when she was on my stream, she actually didn't do her presentation.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.681
She just let me play it.

01:36:24.023 --> 01:36:26.265
That's how you know that she was a scripted fraud.

01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:34.794
She didn't even want to give her presentation again because she wasn't confident that she could do it as well as she had in the recording.

01:36:36.355 --> 01:36:43.639
No one has ever gotten this far to tell you that Laura Bono is probably an innocent, unwitting participant.

01:36:44.719 --> 01:36:53.844
That the whole time at CHD, she probably understood that Mary really wasn't helping, but she didn't understand that Mary was a traitor to American kids.

01:36:55.492 --> 01:36:57.053
But Laura Bono could learn it now.

01:36:58.334 --> 01:37:07.200
Laura Bono could see the truth of this stream and then start to speak out and contact, I don't know, any news organization and say, hey, I'm one of the original founders of CHD.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.061
And I think Jonathan Cooley's right.

01:37:09.121 --> 01:37:11.163
I think these people were frauds all along.

01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:12.944
That's why we never scored the touchdown.

01:37:13.424 --> 01:37:16.106
I could never figure it out, but now I think I figured it out.

01:37:16.186 --> 01:37:16.946
Jay's right.

01:37:18.928 --> 01:37:21.630
Jackie Haines, Jackie Hines is a, is a,

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:26.363
was kind of my supervisor the whole time while I worked on the book.

01:37:27.405 --> 01:37:34.037
Jackie Haines also knows that I'm 100% right here and if she wanted to she could go to a news outlet.

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.480
I don't know what she's doing now but

01:37:36.508 --> 01:37:48.078
Any of these people that I haven't circled in this thing could probably figure out that they work for a shithole, a real sabotage organization that could have scored a touchdown already many years ago.

01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:55.784
You know, like the lady at the top of this picture over here, Suzanne Humphries could have scored the touchdown of there's no safe vaccine.

01:37:55.904 --> 01:37:59.727
I don't think it's possible because it's antithetical to our biology.

01:37:59.787 --> 01:38:03.110
She could have said that on Joe Rogan just a few months ago, but she didn't.

01:38:05.615 --> 01:38:09.858
She said it while Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker were still alive, and she said it on stage with them.

01:38:13.942 --> 01:38:16.944
And the same basically can be said for a lot of these people.

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:22.008
I don't know why the only brown person that's international is Indian.

01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:31.296
The international head of CHD World is an Indian woman, or CHD Africa, or whatever the hell she does.

01:38:32.417 --> 01:38:34.018
It's crazy, ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:34.078 --> 01:38:35.019
No one's gotten this far.

01:38:36.454 --> 01:38:42.479
No one's gotten so far as to be able to say this with selfies with both of these guys.

01:38:44.862 --> 01:38:58.534
No one's gotten this far to tell you that, look, Jay Bhattacharya pulled me aside and told me he was gonna be NIH director and told me not to talk about Robert Malone anymore before the election.

01:39:00.235 --> 01:39:01.677
Is that not a news story?

01:39:03.755 --> 01:39:08.737
Is that not important because CHD is selling the third book of Robert Malone now?

01:39:09.258 --> 01:39:14.940
Is that not important because they said they were fighting for children's health when in fact they weren't?

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.383
Is it not important that at the head of HHS there is a fraud right now?

01:39:21.903 --> 01:39:23.004
Is it not important?

01:39:26.345 --> 01:39:26.705
I don't know.

01:39:28.586 --> 01:39:29.227
I don't, I don't know.

01:39:29.447 --> 01:39:30.067
I guess it's not.

01:41:25.609 --> 01:41:26.630
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:32.277
Don't forget to share and don't forget to download the PeerTube app and let me know if you have any trouble getting it to work.

01:41:32.317 --> 01:41:33.879
It works so well for me.

01:41:33.939 --> 01:41:34.840
Be well, see you tomorrow.
