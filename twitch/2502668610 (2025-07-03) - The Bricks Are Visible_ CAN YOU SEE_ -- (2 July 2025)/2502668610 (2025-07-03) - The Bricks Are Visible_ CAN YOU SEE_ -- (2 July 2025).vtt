WEBVTT

00:09.502 --> 00:09.762
you

00:52.774 --> 00:55.177
But you can tell if someone's lying.

00:55.217 --> 00:56.698
You can sort of feel it in people.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.181
And I have lied.

00:59.201 --> 01:00.262
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:00.282 --> 01:01.183
I don't want to lie.

01:01.203 --> 01:03.045
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:03.165 --> 01:04.186
I try not to be a liar.

01:04.206 --> 01:05.067
I don't want to be a liar.

01:05.628 --> 01:08.330
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

01:22.910 --> 01:36.636
Community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap, trying to screen their employees and their nursing homes for something that's not gonna turn positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

01:39.478 --> 01:46.641
I said, dude, you need these capture antigen things, where you're not looking for antibodies, you're actually looking for the virus.

01:47.982 --> 01:48.882
So they're expensive.

01:50.336 --> 01:56.700
But the antibody is what's on the membrane, the antibody specific for the COVID virus.

01:58.341 --> 02:03.365
So patient sample, mix it up, but the whole virus is coming through.

02:03.385 --> 02:10.650
And if it latches one of them, another antibody comes through and it turns color.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.591
You get like the pregnancy test kit.

02:14.292 --> 02:15.813
The first one of these I saw, we, 2021,

02:19.423 --> 02:22.224
We had to go to Rome to speak to the Italian Senate.

02:24.025 --> 02:27.347
And, um, I'm not vaccinated.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.868
I don't have a card.

02:29.648 --> 02:30.909
Neither did Dr. Malone.

02:32.790 --> 02:33.650
He didn't have a card.

02:34.490 --> 02:36.551
So, you know, I know you can't come in and out.

02:36.992 --> 02:38.212
So we're raising hell.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.675
So they go in and take us to see the, uh, the Senate doctor.

02:43.695 --> 02:47.217
And he's got these little rapid flow cannon, rips it open.

02:48.689 --> 02:56.217
I'm reading this thing, antigen test kit, not antibody, antigen, the protein.

02:57.138 --> 02:58.720
It's testing for spike protein.

03:00.082 --> 03:01.503
And it's accurate.

03:02.444 --> 03:08.411
And it's as accurate as the PCR test would have been if you ran it at a CT of like 30.

03:17.692 --> 03:19.594
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

03:19.694 --> 03:24.979
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

03:25.860 --> 03:32.607
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

04:27.153 --> 04:28.734
I think truth is good for kids.

04:29.154 --> 04:32.875
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

04:33.435 --> 04:35.716
We want everybody to feel good.

04:35.996 --> 04:37.416
That's not the way life is.

05:14.884 --> 05:15.226
the the

05:46.365 --> 05:47.226
Maybe it's my fault.

05:49.068 --> 05:51.911
Maybe I led you to believe it was easy when it wasn't.

05:53.713 --> 05:57.897
Maybe I made you think my highlights started at the free throw line and not in the gym.

06:00.039 --> 06:02.802
Maybe I made you think that every shot I took was a game winner.

06:05.585 --> 06:08.528
That my game was built on flash and not fire.

06:11.266 --> 06:16.950
Maybe it's my fault that you didn't see that failure gave me strength, that my pain was my motivation.

06:19.212 --> 06:27.478
Maybe I led you to believe that basketball was a God-given gift and not something I worked for every single day of my life.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.841
Maybe I destroyed the game.

06:36.384 --> 06:39.226
Or maybe you're just making excuses.

06:42.961 --> 06:43.882
What time is it?

06:43.942 --> 06:44.702
Game time!

06:44.782 --> 06:45.042
Woo!

06:52.526 --> 06:53.506
Good morning, everybody.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.487
Welcome to the show.

06:54.547 --> 07:05.573
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist where we stay focused on the biology, we don't take the bait on social media, and we know and love our neighbors.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.514
Thank you very much for being here.

07:08.574 --> 07:10.614
Please get your kids off of social media.

07:10.694 --> 07:18.876
Please log off of all your social media accounts unless you're using them specifically to communicate with specific people.

07:19.036 --> 07:22.177
Otherwise, you're just walking into the trap.

07:22.677 --> 07:25.457
And more importantly, you're giving it to your kids.

07:25.497 --> 07:28.358
You're giving your kids over to it as well.

07:28.618 --> 07:29.978
We will not call autism.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.738
I don't like the word autism.

07:32.558 --> 07:33.599
He was vaccine damaged.

07:33.959 --> 07:35.359
He was neurologically damaged.

07:36.739 --> 07:38.840
condition that we will not call autism.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.541
I don't like the word autism.

07:41.421 --> 07:42.481
He was vaccine damaged.

07:42.662 --> 07:56.667
Now, as much as I love the way that 2013 Brian Hooker can say that, I am very disappointed in all these organizations that seem not to be able to say it, including Children's Health Defense, where Brian Hooker now works.

07:57.327 --> 07:59.490
Ladies and gentlemen, I think there's a better way to say it.

07:59.610 --> 08:02.073
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mythology.

08:02.553 --> 08:13.065
It's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a method, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason or an answer.

08:13.866 --> 08:37.434
and so we're going to address this one very quickly today in the beginning and also realize that pandemics and gain of function although they also serve as a myth which protects these these ideas it also has accomplished a few very specific things because whereby almost everyone on earth has come to accept that there was a novel virus

08:38.496 --> 08:52.725
that PCR is a useful diagnostic, that COVID killed millions of people, and opioids don't do that, mRNA saved millions more, and social media is useful.

08:53.426 --> 09:05.313
Ladies and gentlemen, the idea that the Health Freedom Movement is formed on and is facilitated by the free speech on social media is a terrible lie.

09:06.661 --> 09:07.862
A terrible lie.

09:08.523 --> 09:12.667
And that is the main accomplishment that's happened over the course of the pandemic.

09:13.227 --> 09:23.617
And if we can't show our children why the cheese is free on social media, and we can't show our children the trap that we are in, they won't be able to get out.

09:24.673 --> 09:27.154
That's the reality of the situation.

09:27.194 --> 09:42.322
If we can't teach our children why social media is so awful and how coordinated lying is so manifest and facilitated by our use of social media, the kids won't understand why the cheese is free.

09:42.923 --> 09:45.004
And therefore, they will die in that trap.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.525
So ladies and gentlemen, it sounds dramatic, but it's not.

09:48.006 --> 09:51.607
We've got to teach the kids the, the, the, the, the biology

09:52.987 --> 09:55.549
Gotta correct all these slides with the double the there.

09:55.589 --> 09:57.790
Thank you very much for pointing that out, Usain.

10:00.472 --> 10:05.095
Anyway, yeah, it's GigaOM Biological, and we are here.

10:06.256 --> 10:07.837
And we are not going anywhere.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.518
I don't think...

10:09.278 --> 10:11.099
Mark Kulak's going anywhere either.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.762
He might not do a show every day for the next 70 days in a row.

10:16.763 --> 10:19.364
He might do three shows one day and then skip a day.

10:20.325 --> 10:28.290
But I tell you what will always be there as far as I'm pretty sure is his archive because it's backed up all around the world too.

10:29.071 --> 10:35.375
What also will be there for a while is this substackbiologyphenomenon.substack.com which is a

10:36.275 --> 10:44.446
It's a kind of best archive of what happened in Scotland, which is just a microcosm of what they did throughout the West, but especially in America.

10:45.087 --> 10:47.510
America, the manslaughter was egregious.

10:48.391 --> 10:51.055
And this is the truth I think everybody needs to understand.

10:51.115 --> 10:52.917
Everybody that's lost a loved one to

10:53.758 --> 11:00.645
Some kind of hospital protocol needs to revisit what that protocol was and what started the whole train for them.

11:01.866 --> 11:09.513
They need to understand that ARDS is a condition that derives its name from the misuse of pure oxygen.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.956
That's one of the truths that will set you free.

11:13.057 --> 11:17.741
As long as you're staying focused on the biology, you might be here at the top of the wave, but if you're taking the

11:18.442 --> 11:19.683
bait on social media.

11:19.723 --> 11:23.287
You might be one of these guys down here that's getting knocked over regularly.

11:24.208 --> 11:28.292
And you might not know who your neighbors are, so you might not really love them or even care about them.

11:29.573 --> 11:38.162
And I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that knowing who your neighbors are and being able to network with them is going to be very important should the lights go out.

11:40.097 --> 11:44.320
If the internet goes down, you're going to want to know your neighbors.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.821
So you might as well get to it right now.

11:45.841 --> 11:57.970
You're not going to agree on everything, but if you can start to realize that the red and the blue team are both performing for you, then I think you can help your neighbors pull their heads out.

11:57.990 --> 12:03.615
Because you're not going to be taking this stance, which I think is an absurd stance at this point,

12:04.375 --> 12:13.497
that Donald Trump is some kind of patriotic hero and 5D chess playing genius because this is just absurd.

12:13.737 --> 12:18.978
And so I don't come at my family and friends or my neighbors with this idea anymore.

12:19.678 --> 12:31.341
If you can't roll your eyes at what's going on right now with the big beautiful bill and all the nonsense that they're accepting as trade-offs, we are basically being run into the ground.

12:31.421 --> 12:32.221
It's a cruise ship.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.062
Everything is okay.

12:34.102 --> 12:52.570
Maybe we're running out of food or something or it's a little old But the cruise ship is being driven into the rocks and in the meantime they are extracting all the value that they can and Donald Trump is a probably very witting and willing participant in it.

12:53.230 --> 12:53.891
I think one of the

12:55.100 --> 13:18.343
The hard truths that everybody, I think, needs to realize is, besides the fact that social media is a scam, I think you need to come to realize that the people that run this show, that have the little private meetings and the invite-only Chatham House rules kind of shit, these people see themselves as separate from the masses.

13:19.482 --> 13:28.645
They see the masses as people that are too focused on today and tomorrow to see multi-generational plans.

13:28.685 --> 13:33.367
They're too naive to think in multi-generational timescales.

13:33.587 --> 13:42.110
And the ruling elite on Earth, across nations, agree that there is a species

13:43.070 --> 14:09.619
to be governed there is a future which is multi multi-generational and if you're thinking on multi-generational time scales then huge changes can be made um significant social changes can be made over time scales that are just invisible to people who aren't regularly thinking that they are governed in this way but in fact that's not that dissimilar to a chicken

14:10.489 --> 14:22.334
who gets raised for two years on an organic farm to give eggs and it seems like this is paradise on earth and then suddenly one day it's over, they're chicken soup and broth.

14:23.955 --> 14:31.301
And in some respects, our society is moving very slowly toward that over the last 20 or 30 years.

14:31.781 --> 14:43.090
And certainly one of the greatest impetuses for this change of sovereign individual to experimental animal and captive citizen is this human genome project.

14:43.230 --> 14:50.915
And the realization that the medical data and the genetic data of every human possible

14:51.900 --> 15:00.142
is the only hope they have of using a machine learning algorithm to make any headway at all in understanding ourselves

15:01.386 --> 15:03.247
as a genetic entity.

15:03.327 --> 15:12.013
Now, I'm using their terms and working under their assumptions because I do think it's important all the time to start out on ground that we all understand.

15:12.073 --> 15:19.097
But of course, I want you to slowly move toward thinking about life as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

15:19.758 --> 15:28.604
And there's very little of the trajectory across time, the development, the optimization of development and what's required to do that in the

15:29.532 --> 15:32.386
in this story of ourselves as a genetic being.

15:33.280 --> 15:45.348
And so the emphasis on genes and the phenotype and rare diseases, which are also an emphasis on genes, is really ubiquitous throughout academic science.

15:45.428 --> 15:55.414
In neurobiology, in molecular biology, in any real biomedical science, there's going to be an impetus to have a gene as part of your story.

15:55.895 --> 16:00.398
Maybe even a genetic model, like a knockout mouse or an altered mouse.

16:01.098 --> 16:11.600
to give you this special sort of tact on what is prioritized in the system, which is genetic causes of disease, genetic causes of behavior.

16:11.640 --> 16:17.801
Genetic causes of behavior are some of the best things you can study in neuroscience in the study of the brain.

16:19.181 --> 16:30.143
And so these themes belie a multi-generational plan to invert the sovereignty of our grandchildren.

16:30.911 --> 16:35.255
so that their genetic and medical data can be regularly accessed.

16:35.315 --> 16:58.094
And in fact, a personalized regiment of medicine and maybe even genetic medicines can eventually be applied in hopes that one day the tweaking of that, you know, by reiterations of the machine learning algorithm, reiterations of the data collection, reiterations of the genetic monitoring, all of these things, they don't know the data they need.

16:58.414 --> 17:00.156
They don't know what they need to measure yet.

17:00.176 --> 17:16.832
They're not even sure what phenomenon is changing across time And so they got a lot of monitoring to do a lot of data points to do but first they need to build an infrastructure and a society wherein the collection of this data and the surrendering to this

17:17.728 --> 17:22.571
you know, technocracy, is widely accepted as just the way things are.

17:22.671 --> 17:28.795
Not resisted, not even seen, but just accepted as normal.

17:30.036 --> 17:40.243
And so this, we still have a small chance of evading because our children can still be awakened to the truth of this movement.

17:40.283 --> 17:41.844
This Maha is a joke.

17:43.745 --> 17:44.666
Why is that Maha?

17:45.146 --> 17:46.107
Did I start the wrong?

17:47.330 --> 17:47.650
Street.

17:48.991 --> 17:49.652
Why is it that?

17:51.433 --> 17:53.575
I thought I put a different, what in the world?

17:55.957 --> 17:57.979
I thought I put a different thing there.

17:58.079 --> 17:59.140
That should be that one.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.621
Isn't that where we are?

18:01.522 --> 18:02.963
Yeah.

18:02.983 --> 18:03.323
Yeah.

18:04.444 --> 18:05.445
That is so bizarre.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.026
What in the hell is going on here?

18:07.887 --> 18:08.968
It should be this slide.

18:11.610 --> 18:11.890
Huh?

18:13.472 --> 18:14.933
It looks different right here.

18:15.013 --> 18:16.154
What is going on with this?

18:20.734 --> 18:21.835
That is so weird.

18:23.155 --> 18:24.316
Is there another slide?

18:24.776 --> 18:25.997
Oh, there's two slides.

18:26.217 --> 18:26.597
I get it.

18:26.677 --> 18:29.219
OK, so my bad.

18:29.419 --> 18:30.800
Let me do a selection here.

18:31.120 --> 18:31.820
My bad.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.022
I didn't play that slide.

18:34.142 --> 18:36.403
And so I have a little glitch here.

18:36.503 --> 18:37.124
Let's see.

18:37.204 --> 18:37.904
What do I need to do?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.546
I need the selection pane.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.126
There we go.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.607
And then this can go.

18:43.627 --> 18:45.128
I'll just.

18:48.370 --> 18:48.990
Yeah, I get it.

18:49.491 --> 18:49.891
I get it.

18:54.028 --> 18:55.770
I'm gonna resume the show first.

18:56.390 --> 18:57.751
Oh, it's gonna crash on me now.

18:58.172 --> 18:58.552
Darn it.

18:59.453 --> 19:00.674
PowerPoint really hates me.

19:00.794 --> 19:05.378
I think I can grind PowerPoint right into the ground with how I use it.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.581
It's too much, Captain!

19:09.222 --> 19:10.583
I haven't gotten a power!

19:11.424 --> 19:12.645
Come on, you wuss!

19:13.766 --> 19:14.567
Quit crashing!

19:16.049 --> 19:16.569
There we go.

19:16.969 --> 19:18.289
Okay, we got this one.

19:18.329 --> 19:22.390
We're gonna get rid of Robert Malone here, delete that one, and then we'll do the slideshow.

19:22.450 --> 19:27.031
So, we were, I am arguing, not that camera, this one.

19:27.611 --> 19:30.592
I am arguing that Maha is a joke on America.

19:30.612 --> 19:31.912
I'm not the only one, of course.

19:31.972 --> 19:36.553
Peggy Hall, the healthy American, has been skeptical of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.633
for a few years now.

19:37.713 --> 19:41.394
She's been calling out the hogwash for a while now, blah, blah, blah.

19:42.114 --> 19:53.000
But in reality, the people that are kind of calling out the differences in what people say versus what they do, they themselves don't have an answer.

19:54.312 --> 20:00.654
Peggy Hall is not gonna tell you a very succinct thing about, you know, what I think is this, this, and this.

20:01.394 --> 20:03.955
Peggy Hall's never said that all vaccines are bad.

20:04.035 --> 20:06.895
Peggy Hall's never said that intramuscular injection is dumb.

20:06.956 --> 20:11.697
Peggy Hall's never suggested that maybe there's no biology behind an RNA pandemic.

20:11.757 --> 20:15.638
Peggy Hall's never said that these things should have been called transfections from day one.

20:16.650 --> 20:23.274
Peggy Hall's never told you about the population pyramid and how they had a predicted rise in all-cause mortality.

20:23.294 --> 20:37.462
And of course, Zubin hasn't told you, Vinay hasn't told you, Marty McCary hasn't told you, Brett Weinstein hasn't told you, even Heather Haying hasn't told you anything really useful.

20:37.922 --> 20:40.803
And that's how you can see that MAHA is a joke on America.

20:42.604 --> 20:45.106
And we've got to pull our heads out, ladies and gentlemen.

20:45.933 --> 20:50.556
because just like Trump, these people are nothing but scripted bullshitters.

20:53.438 --> 20:54.258
Yeah, that makes sense.

20:54.418 --> 20:56.520
You would make more sense to me if that was the case.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.240
I'm nervous.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.601
I don't know why I'm nervous.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.764
I feel like I know this is my truth, but I also feel like, what if it's not?

21:02.984 --> 21:06.506
And that it's out of laziness.

21:06.706 --> 21:12.089
Those of you who realize that you're surprised by this are gonna realize that you don't know me very well, actually.

21:12.109 --> 21:14.191
I just wish I knew why nobody noticed.

21:16.578 --> 21:17.758
Hello, my friends and fishes.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.419
Courtney Mermaid here, and welcome back to another video.

21:20.479 --> 21:24.239
Today, we are going to be looking at my autism assessment.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.941
Autism assessment, it says.

21:32.081 --> 21:33.841
I want to turn that thing off.

21:34.101 --> 21:35.001
It's annoying me.

21:35.701 --> 21:36.181
Where is it?

21:39.482 --> 21:40.162
Is it under there?

21:41.482 --> 21:41.722
No.

21:43.423 --> 21:44.243
Where is it?

21:45.365 --> 21:45.845
Oh, there it is.

21:45.885 --> 21:46.166
Sorry.

21:46.586 --> 21:47.347
There we go.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.308
Ah, yeah.

21:49.368 --> 21:49.688
Wow.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.129
Okay.

21:50.169 --> 21:52.851
So she's going to have an autism assessment journey.

21:52.911 --> 21:58.395
This is a YouTube video that YouTube served me the other day, and I want to make a point with it.

21:58.615 --> 21:58.875
Okay.

21:58.935 --> 22:07.902
I'm going to make a very important point with it because I've been starting my stream for a while now with this idea that, that autism, autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

22:08.963 --> 22:11.045
And this is the result of that myth.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.767
And I'll do a little bit of impromptu stuff on a piece of paper in a minute.

22:15.787 --> 22:18.348
But let's just listen to this person for a second.

22:19.249 --> 22:23.851
Because I do think it's really important to see how hard they worked on this.

22:23.931 --> 22:29.254
Because remember, Brian Hooker in 2013 did not use the word autism.

22:29.294 --> 22:30.974
He didn't like the word autism.

22:31.114 --> 22:32.055
And I believe

22:33.390 --> 22:49.503
that this is the reason why it's the same exact problem that calling it autism spectrum disorder and roping more and more things into it as a diagnosis means that there's no focus on these kids with specific

22:50.600 --> 22:51.941
sort of circumstances.

22:52.001 --> 23:05.195
You know, like if you said that autism disorder covers all these things, including, you know, people that are hit by a car on a bicycle and get brain damage.

23:06.693 --> 23:14.316
And yet these parents of the kids that got hit on a bicycle and then have brain damage are like saying, no, but this is not autism.

23:14.396 --> 23:22.159
This is something that happened after he got hit by a car and he wasn't wearing a helmet and holy shit, there was blood all over his head.

23:22.679 --> 23:25.700
And from then on, the guy couldn't talk anymore.

23:26.140 --> 23:33.703
He's always said his words backwards and he's banging his head against the wall for the rest of his life.

23:33.823 --> 23:34.744
Those parents,

23:35.484 --> 23:39.788
don't need to be explained to that this is not autism, you see?

23:41.370 --> 23:57.106
And yet at the beginning of this administration, they were briefly talking about profound autism as being different from all the other spectrum of disorders that apparently includes this adult who can make and edit YouTube videos.

23:59.599 --> 23:59.999
journey.

24:00.379 --> 24:12.994
My assessment took place over the span of two months with sort of like one or two appointments per week and then there was a gap of time where there were no appointments because you know they're compiling everything before they give you kind of the result.

24:13.274 --> 24:17.079
So I'm gonna warn you now, this video is very much the real experience.

24:17.279 --> 24:18.761
I left very little out.

24:19.241 --> 24:25.804
I'm not gonna lie, when I tell you there was a lot of crying that took place in this video, especially towards the end.

24:25.944 --> 24:37.608
If you're in the mood for a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster and you would like some insight into what the experience was like, how it went, my thoughts, and all of these things, then let's dive in.

24:39.289 --> 24:42.990
So today is the intake for my autism assessment.

24:43.250 --> 24:46.752
A number of you are gonna be like, now this is gonna shock you

24:47.987 --> 24:48.867
what she says.

24:49.807 --> 24:53.368
Because remember, this is an adult assessment.

24:53.388 --> 24:57.769
This is an adult who's decided to go to the doctor to find out if she's autistic.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.790
Now think about that for a second.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.770
Is it because you're banging your head on the wall?

25:02.350 --> 25:06.051
Is it because you can't control your bowel all day because your bowels hurt?

25:06.632 --> 25:10.412
Exactly why is it that you have this idea that you might be autistic?

25:10.452 --> 25:13.673
So listen to this carefully because this is really impressive.

25:14.573 --> 25:15.574
Like autistic?

25:15.734 --> 25:15.774
Oh.

25:17.165 --> 25:17.986
No, you're not.

25:18.286 --> 25:19.366
And it's called editing.

25:19.666 --> 25:25.009
I've been actually dropping hints about this for the last seven months.

25:25.029 --> 25:26.710
I will bring you along for the whole thing.

25:27.370 --> 25:33.934
So she's a YouTuber who's been dropping hints for the last seven months that she's in fact autistic.

25:33.974 --> 25:37.116
So what, who does, why are you doing that?

25:37.196 --> 25:39.197
What, what exactly is going on here?

25:39.237 --> 25:44.679
This is an autistic person who's living their life on YouTube as like a reality show?

25:44.800 --> 25:45.100
Really?

25:46.235 --> 25:46.555
Really?

25:46.636 --> 25:51.301
Is that the kind of autistic kids that I have at my school?

25:52.322 --> 25:54.865
Is that the kind of autistic kids that I've run into?

25:55.306 --> 25:58.069
Is that the kind of autistic kid that Brian Hooker has at home?

25:59.490 --> 26:02.414
May 17th, I'll have between one and two appointments.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.623
every week from now until mid-June.

26:05.924 --> 26:07.945
So June 23rd is gonna be like D-Day.

26:08.045 --> 26:11.949
That'll be the day that they tell me whether or not that they think I'm autistic or not.

26:12.029 --> 26:12.850
How did we get here?

26:12.910 --> 26:13.830
That's a good question.

26:13.850 --> 26:15.132
I'm so glad you didn't ask.

26:15.372 --> 26:24.700
I was 25, I was minding my business, and YouTube recommended a video for me by a creator who doesn't make content anymore that I'm aware, or at least not on,

26:25.220 --> 26:25.620
YouTube.

26:25.720 --> 26:38.004
I had done some research, I had mentioned it in a few different ways to my family doctor at the time, and everybody just- So if you do your own research on YouTube with regard to autism, that's totally okay.

26:38.524 --> 26:46.407
But if you do your research with regard to vaccines, or biology, or any other field, you would be an idiot.

26:48.015 --> 26:49.595
kind of dismissed it as not a thing.

26:49.936 --> 26:51.596
Oh, it's just a sensory disorder.

26:52.296 --> 26:54.117
It's just, oh, it's just a sensory disorder.

26:54.137 --> 26:55.477
Yeah, oh, it's just anxiety.

26:55.537 --> 26:56.297
It's just oppression.

26:56.637 --> 26:57.118
Is it though?

26:57.138 --> 26:58.438
So 10 years, right?

26:58.518 --> 27:08.321
And at the time I was, when I was 25, I was looking into places to go and get assessed, but at the time nobody was doing adult assessments and especially not adult assessments for women.

27:08.361 --> 27:08.981
That wasn't a thing.

27:09.181 --> 27:09.902
So I let it go.

27:10.082 --> 27:10.883
I was like, whatever.

27:10.903 --> 27:11.503
I know.

27:11.523 --> 27:13.225
I know my truth.

27:13.645 --> 27:14.626
Something is amiss.

27:15.006 --> 27:18.490
If it's autism, if it's not, I don't know because I'm not a doctor.

27:18.570 --> 27:33.744
But in my gut, I had a feeling that something was definitely... Now, don't you think that somebody like James Lyons Weiler, who says that autism is a complex thing of environmental and genetic, you know, causes, would be all over this?

27:37.199 --> 27:38.139
But he's not, right?

27:38.179 --> 27:40.840
He's not gonna come out and say, no, no, no, no, we're not talking about you.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.841
Is Robert F. Kennedy gonna come out and say, no, no, no, no, we're not talking about you.

27:45.861 --> 27:47.581
We're talking about profound autism.

27:47.641 --> 27:50.122
That's how they did it in 2025.

27:50.842 --> 27:52.542
They said profound autism.

27:52.582 --> 28:00.664
And that was being very clear with everybody that we know the difference between a chick like this and people with profound autism.

28:01.044 --> 28:02.644
We stand up for children.

28:04.454 --> 28:05.674
What a, wow.

28:06.155 --> 28:08.636
Askew, and I had started to notice it more and more.

28:08.776 --> 28:14.318
So fast forward, things got really bad for me when I quit my industry, animation industry.

28:14.438 --> 28:24.682
Think about how long Children's Health Defense has been allowing this kind of shit to go on with, again, the idea that autism spectrum disorder is getting wider and wider all the time.

28:25.102 --> 28:32.805
But CHD's never really made a useful argument about the fact that, look, we're talking about kids that die.

28:34.341 --> 28:46.555
or lose eye contact, lose bowel control, start banging their head within one week or two weeks after the shots, and it doesn't matter what shot it is.

28:47.496 --> 28:52.482
How come they've never gotten to saying that those are the ones that we really want you to think about?

28:54.448 --> 28:58.750
How come they haven't gotten down to saying, and those ones aren't actually autism?

28:58.890 --> 29:11.695
Autism is kind of a stupid word when it comes to the specific thing that we're talking about with regard to vaccine injury, is what Brian Hooker, 2013, would have surely said.

29:13.495 --> 29:23.099
But as the chief scientific officer of Children's Health Defense, he can only build a big top tent of health freedom because he is a traitor.

29:24.073 --> 29:25.253
Maybe he was pressured.

29:26.114 --> 29:33.335
Maybe the pay and the insurance is just too good and his life with his son is just too miserable.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.496
That's fine.

29:34.916 --> 29:48.119
You need to get a pair of balls, Brian, and you need to speak up for the grandkids of America, the ones that will potentially be as injured as your son in the future if you don't grow a pair, Brian Hooker.

29:51.175 --> 29:53.637
Great job, I used to be in the animation industry as an artist.

29:53.757 --> 30:03.043
When I left and I started working for myself... She was in the animation industry as an artist, but she's autistic.

30:05.404 --> 30:10.607
Why isn't Brian Hooker angry about every single one of these people?

30:10.768 --> 30:20.374
And why aren't they telling us that this is a trap, this is just ridiculous, this is just silly, and that to help her too!

30:23.646 --> 30:25.667
Because this gives her an excuse.

30:27.227 --> 30:31.809
Instead of a doorway out, it's like a doorway to acceptance.

30:31.829 --> 30:36.851
Well, I guess I just have to accept that I'm fucked up and I can't do anything about it because I'm fucked up.

30:37.331 --> 30:39.632
That's exactly what this message is.

30:39.692 --> 30:47.655
And the message of all these people is, especially when they say, you know, there's some genetic vulnerabilities like this MTHFR gene.

30:49.758 --> 30:50.419
full-time.

30:50.679 --> 30:52.741
And then my life fell apart, which was a whole other thing.

30:52.801 --> 30:57.486
But I noticed even more things about myself that were starting to bubble to the surface.

30:57.886 --> 30:59.427
And then the pandemic hit.

30:59.708 --> 31:01.249
And then TikTok.

31:04.152 --> 31:09.097
TikTok started showing me autistic creators within my first hour.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.959
And I'm starting to to notice like weird things.

31:11.979 --> 31:12.260
I'm like,

31:13.675 --> 31:14.316
I do that.

31:14.476 --> 31:16.739
Don't even, keep your opinions and shit to yourself.

31:16.820 --> 31:19.784
I'm sitting there and I'm like, boy, this is starting to sound weird.

31:20.024 --> 31:22.227
And now I'm doing more research and more research.

31:22.287 --> 31:29.658
And I found out there were- So YouTube and TikTok are the reason why she decided that she needed to be diagnosed as an adult.

31:31.536 --> 31:36.760
So do you need any more proof that social media has been weaponized against us?

31:36.780 --> 31:41.464
Do you need any more proof that social media is not helpful, but it is detrimental?

31:42.125 --> 31:45.387
That it is designed to mislead these kids?

31:46.788 --> 31:49.451
Ooh, it's the Chinese TikTok that's doing it.

31:49.651 --> 31:52.373
Ooh, it must be TikTok, it's weaponized against us.

31:52.413 --> 32:00.019
Yeah, so is Snapchat, so is Discord, so is Facebook, so is Twitter, so is Blue Sky.

32:00.119 --> 32:00.960
It's all a joke.

32:04.502 --> 32:12.368
The only thing that works is having your own website and you having your own website and me following you and giving a link on my website and that's it.

32:13.803 --> 32:18.107
And if I don't trust you, I won't put a link there and I won't share any of your work and that's it.

32:18.167 --> 32:19.608
That's the only way this will work.

32:20.108 --> 32:30.717
If you surrender your attention to their programming, which they call an algorithm so that you think it's spontaneous or random or something that they don't have control over.

32:30.777 --> 32:33.379
No, you are surrendering to their programming.

32:33.419 --> 32:39.304
And this is what happens in the extreme case of extremely skillful use of social media.

32:40.205 --> 32:42.427
Because she believes that there's truth there.

32:43.464 --> 32:52.386
tests, like tests that you could take, like legitimate tests that you can take, but they will help give you an idea as to whether or not autism is maybe something you should be assessed for.

32:52.486 --> 33:01.669
So, and the tests include, okay, so there's the ASPE quiz, the RADS-R, CAT-Q, autism spectrum quotient, quotient?

33:01.689 --> 33:04.429
I don't know how to say this shit.

33:04.829 --> 33:06.570
And then, um, like,

33:07.931 --> 33:11.953
40, no, 60 pages of my elementary school report cards.

33:12.053 --> 33:16.915
And then I also found some photos of myself as a kid that I feel like shed some light on a few things.

33:17.095 --> 33:18.955
It's a lot, okay?

33:19.756 --> 33:20.696
It's a lot of stuff.

33:20.836 --> 33:25.338
I didn't just wake up one morning and say, hey, wouldn't it be cool if I was autistic?

33:27.054 --> 33:29.599
The first quiz that I did was the ASCII quiz.

33:29.799 --> 33:36.752
My neurodiverse score was 146 out of 200, and my neurotypical score was 67 out of 200.

33:36.832 --> 33:38.755
So that's kind of what it looks like.

33:40.162 --> 33:40.362
Okay?

33:41.343 --> 33:45.266
So, I printed it off, and I kind of sat on it, and I was like, what do I do with this?

33:45.826 --> 33:47.027
What do I do with this information?

33:47.268 --> 33:55.494
So, with the help of a really good friend, I don't know if he's comfortable with me saying his name on here, so I'm gonna just, we're just gonna keep him anonymous, him and his wife.

33:55.614 --> 34:02.840
You know who you are if you happen to be watching this, and how much I appreciate, like, wow, why do I feel like I'm gonna cry?

34:04.386 --> 34:06.607
and how much I appreciate the response that you had.

34:06.707 --> 34:15.171
When I was telling you, and I, you know, I popped out some earplugs, and I was telling, telling a little bit about, like, what I was thinking and what was going on, and he said, yeah, that makes sense.

34:15.331 --> 34:22.954
You would make more sense to me if that was the case, and I just thought, that just stuck with me in my mind when he said that, and I thought, like, we went to school together as well.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.715
The particular year of school wasn't a good one for me.

34:26.055 --> 34:26.655
It's really funny.

34:26.695 --> 34:38.618
I want you to think about how amazing that is that people have been so diluted in their understanding of their own biology that they think that autism is something that they kind of get.

34:38.678 --> 34:43.759
When I grew up, the best example that I had of autism was Rain Man.

34:45.079 --> 34:48.200
And if you haven't seen the movie Rain Man, boy, are you missing something.

34:49.881 --> 34:55.142
So this is a remarkable fracturing of our

34:56.360 --> 35:04.778
of the idea of who we are as a species, as a being, as sovereign individuals, as people.

35:05.953 --> 35:18.880
who are put on this earth with a purpose, that we have a responsibility to find, that we have an opportunity that only lasts for so long, that we have an opportunity to take, a responsibility to take advantage of.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.321
And this person has completely inverted that idea.

35:23.202 --> 35:30.986
She's trying to figure out under whose governance she lives, under which genes she's suffering.

35:32.978 --> 35:37.060
Under what diseases does she suffer?

35:37.120 --> 35:38.821
What burdens does she carry?

35:41.502 --> 35:44.624
Think about getting out of bed every morning like this.

35:45.584 --> 35:54.649
There are literally, actually millions of people on earth right now, and especially in the West, that think exactly like this.

35:56.192 --> 36:17.242
And they use that same extremely analytical, super skillful use of social media to figure out how to have an opinion about transgender, about how to have an opinion about money, about how to have an opinion about welfare, about how to have an opinion about vaccines, about how to have an opinion about the Middle East, about Jews.

36:18.642 --> 36:19.483
Think about this.

36:21.294 --> 36:24.216
This is not just one little screwed up girl.

36:24.877 --> 36:30.541
She's explaining to you how screwed up everyone is that's skillfully using social media.

36:30.561 --> 36:34.764
They might not think they're autistic, but they don't doubt that she is.

36:37.286 --> 36:38.607
It makes more sense if you are.

36:41.169 --> 36:47.974
Think about this carefully because our children will soon be in this group of people if we do not get them off of social media.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.916
It is absolutely inevitable.

36:50.874 --> 37:02.262
If we do not get our kids off of social media, all of our children will potentially be diagnosed as somewhat autistic by the time they're 25 and have been out on their own for a few years.

37:07.845 --> 37:14.070
Because I don't think people grasp what it's like when you know something about yourself is

37:15.385 --> 37:18.227
Uneven is what it feels like for me personally.

37:18.267 --> 37:20.388
This is not every how does it feel?

37:20.688 --> 37:29.213
uneven if you've never been even I Mean that's really like looking down and saying man.

37:29.273 --> 37:33.436
I just feel like my My junk is a lot smaller than it should be.

37:33.476 --> 37:35.457
I mean, I feel like a guy with a bigger

37:36.084 --> 37:37.765
a bigger unit than I have.

37:39.385 --> 37:40.906
So I'm just kind of confused.

37:40.966 --> 37:48.648
I've been walking around my whole life not really understanding why what's in my imagination doesn't jive with what I see when I open my underwear.

37:49.128 --> 37:50.288
This is so dumb.

37:51.329 --> 38:04.473
This is so ridiculous that somebody has used skillful media, social media so well that when they look in the mirror, they're confused about what's happening.

38:09.505 --> 38:13.886
And they can't imagine the idea that they have control over their own thoughts.

38:14.066 --> 38:17.747
They can't imagine that they have control over how they feel themselves.

38:18.607 --> 38:28.690
They are trying to find the causes of how they feel externally from themselves because social media tells them that's where it is.

38:29.530 --> 38:31.691
The only causes inside of you are genes.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.362
Everybody's experience, I'm sure everyone's got a different experience.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.063
But something feels uneven.

38:38.543 --> 38:40.344
It feels like I'm standing and I'm lopsided.

38:40.504 --> 38:46.027
And having it shrugged off, like having every experience that I have shrugged off is not a big deal.

38:46.528 --> 38:59.956
So when I ended up on TikTok and found out that there were other people like me, people who do repetitive things and people who speak a certain way, people who have the same struggles that I do to make eye contact, clothing.

39:00.256 --> 39:03.078
Like, have you ever noticed that I'm always wearing this?

39:03.198 --> 39:04.640
Like, has this ever occurred to anybody?

39:04.680 --> 39:07.622
Like, in the morning, this is the only thing I can wear first thing in the morning.

39:07.642 --> 39:10.484
I'm not even wearing pants right now, just if that makes you feel any better.

39:10.624 --> 39:13.467
And going through my report cards, I think, was the biggest eye-opener.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.588
She needs to learn to make eye contact.

39:15.828 --> 39:18.110
She needs to learn to play nicely with the other children.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.111
She's too loud.

39:19.211 --> 39:20.152
She's too quiet.

39:20.612 --> 39:21.793
She fidgets too much.

39:22.113 --> 39:23.314
She needs to try harder.

39:23.354 --> 39:27.398
And then looking at my grades and thinking to myself, how did nobody ever

39:28.317 --> 39:29.098
figure this out.

39:29.358 --> 39:31.520
So here we are at the start of all of this.

39:31.700 --> 39:36.605
I have my appointment is at 2.30 and I wanted to bring you guys along for the ride.

39:36.665 --> 39:37.566
Today's the intake.

39:37.826 --> 39:39.768
I guess we just go over the hate.

39:40.268 --> 39:42.110
Okay, I'm not gonna put you through any more of that.

39:42.130 --> 39:46.754
I just want you to make sure you understand why it's so important to see it for what it is.

39:47.535 --> 39:53.000
The reality is that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

39:54.085 --> 39:58.109
and they enforce this myth with a commitment to it.

39:58.890 --> 40:02.373
So Brian Hooker needs to say that autism exists.

40:03.254 --> 40:04.495
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:04.535 --> 40:12.963
needs to tell you that autism spectrum disorder, sorry, I thought that would stay there for a little while, but I guess it's gonna play on.

40:13.003 --> 40:14.065
I gotta set that up.

40:15.000 --> 40:29.200
better uh this one has to revolve then right automatically loop why would it transition then it shouldn't transition automatically there we go maybe that'll work better wow my slideshow's not working very well today so um

40:31.742 --> 40:40.906
I think it's so crucial to understand how big a weakness this is for the fake health freedom movement.

40:41.026 --> 40:46.349
This idea that autism spectrum disorder is a real thing that doctors need to argue about.

40:46.949 --> 40:53.452
And all of these people, from Robert Malone, to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Meryl Nass, to Mary Holland, to Del Bigtree,

40:54.392 --> 41:09.304
to Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey, to Jessica Rose, they're all going to agree that autism spectrum disorder is real, just like they're all going to agree that the spike protein has furin cleavage sites in it, and that made the COVID go so fast.

41:11.246 --> 41:19.233
Because they all, wittingly or unwittingly, are in on this game to hide that intramuscular injection itself is dumb.

41:20.211 --> 41:34.702
And so right now you're gonna see a bunch of influencers talking about the mRNA shots as separate from the regular shot schedule and having differences that create dangers that aren't present in the original schedule.

41:34.762 --> 41:41.488
This is exactly the illusion that EpiGirl, Jessica Rose has been out there from the very beginning to say.

41:42.028 --> 41:45.250
that there's a new signal in VAERS that wasn't there before.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.572
And therefore, this is evidence that these new shots are worse than the old shots.

41:50.013 --> 41:56.416
And at the same time, we have this background rumor that there's some DNA contamination, that they rushed it.

41:56.836 --> 41:59.318
And of course, there are lots of other ways to make RNA.

41:59.358 --> 42:02.720
There's lots of other things you could use like DNA and electroporation.

42:03.280 --> 42:08.762
And so they put Robert Malone on the ACIP so that they can update the vaccine schedule.

42:08.802 --> 42:19.607
And we can have this nuanced discussion about how certain combinations of intramuscular injection are actually really great and extremely promising for curing rare diseases.

42:19.987 --> 42:25.609
We'll just have to make it for you personally, because we can't make big batches of RNA pure.

42:26.090 --> 42:29.071
And also virology not being questioned is never going to,

42:29.531 --> 42:45.701
None of these people, Jessica, Rose, they're not going to have any nuanced understanding of how virology is almost exclusively based on making pure quantities of DNA or RNA that could never be made in the wild and applying them to cell culture in animals and calling it virology.

42:46.241 --> 42:49.483
It's just transformation and transfection in a million forms.

42:50.663 --> 42:51.444
And the primary

42:52.950 --> 42:57.455
technology that's used in virology, it's all just the Human Genome Project.

42:57.515 --> 43:14.752
It's just sequencing the random noise in the background, using PCR primers that are blind to what they amplify and using algorithms to say what was found, and then making synthetic constructs, copies of whatever they say was found and transfecting things with it.

43:15.916 --> 43:18.198
They are not doing virology, ladies and gentlemen.

43:18.218 --> 43:24.243
They are doing exploratory molecular biology on an irreducibly complex background that's part of us and everything else.

43:25.364 --> 43:32.049
And the only way they're going to get away with it is if you don't question public health and you eventually surrender your sovereignty to this imperative.

43:38.174 --> 43:39.936
This disease as challenge.

43:42.052 --> 43:47.177
Everything that we believed 2020 was right six weeks ago.

43:47.517 --> 43:53.302
It's different than anything we've seen before, and maybe the way we've taken care of things is not the right way of doing it.

43:53.662 --> 43:59.247
There is a lively and healthy debate that I think is a good debate about what the right thing to do here is.

43:59.648 --> 44:06.634
I'm concerned that if we continue on the path that we're on, that hundreds of thousands of lives and lungs may be at risk.

44:11.553 --> 44:16.778
So this is a video from 2020, like in May, maybe even in late April.

44:17.718 --> 44:24.164
And of course, Kyle Seidel, the star of the show there, has got other videos where he's using like crazy amounts of oxygen.

44:24.945 --> 44:33.012
And treating these people with crazy amounts of oxygen, of course, will produce ARDS in a certain percentage of them, maybe a large percentage of those patients.

44:33.732 --> 44:44.095
And so the confusion that was created by the protocols that were insisted on using because they needed to stop the spread of this dangerous virus, they didn't understand how it was presenting.

44:44.675 --> 44:58.659
But the assumption was that one of the cardinal ways that people presented, and of course we can see video of Pierre Kory saying this, that he went to New York City and what he found was all these patients presenting with a pulse ox around 80.

45:00.160 --> 45:04.963
And that, I guess, according to the protocols for COVID, was a reason to vent.

45:05.884 --> 45:10.367
And certainly it was a reason to give people supplementary oxygen if you didn't have a vent for them.

45:10.887 --> 45:18.553
And couple that with the fact that the underlying assumption was is that venting people would stop the nosocomial spread in hospitals.

45:20.374 --> 45:24.637
And so this narrative was laid down meticulously by actors in 2020.

45:25.617 --> 45:29.080
One of the most egregious examples of this is Kyle Seidel.

45:35.567 --> 45:40.130
But they're cautioning others that changing the protocols could endanger lives.

45:40.150 --> 45:40.710
You see that?

45:40.770 --> 45:42.151
This is New York Times.

45:42.972 --> 45:43.932
Sorry, I got to play it.

45:44.612 --> 45:45.753
And then I got to go back to that.

45:45.773 --> 45:46.574
See, listen to him.

45:46.594 --> 45:48.555
Don't deviate from the protocols.

45:48.595 --> 45:52.757
Because we know they're going to reduce mortality.

45:52.777 --> 45:53.658
That's an ICU physician.

46:05.080 --> 46:21.885
And my dollars to donuts is that he, if he really questioned himself, what he did in 2020, if he's not a paid actor and on the script, he would come to realize that he was part of manslaughter, like murdering a lot of people.

46:21.925 --> 46:22.945
He killed a lot of people.

46:23.965 --> 46:27.586
Because you can't just willy nilly put people on high pressure ventilators.

46:27.646 --> 46:33.728
You can't put people on high concentrations of oxygen just because they're presenting with a symptom

46:35.763 --> 46:39.425
and it makes sense to you to give them pure, that's no, no.

46:39.525 --> 46:54.111
And they had more professional responsibility than they are letting on because again, hiding behind the protocols that the administrators of hospitals said you had to follow in order to get paid.

46:55.276 --> 46:55.416
right?

46:55.456 --> 47:00.858
You're not going to get, if you don't treat COVID patients with the COVID protocol, then you can't call them COVID patients.

47:01.578 --> 47:11.481
And so this administrative protocol, this administrative, um, sort of rule was enforced all across the United States.

47:11.581 --> 47:15.122
And these jackasses wittingly or unwittingly are part of that theater.

47:16.623 --> 47:17.843
And this is the evidence of it.

47:26.320 --> 47:31.203
If you ask physicians a month and a half ago, hey, someone comes in breathing 40 times a minute.

47:31.323 --> 47:32.403
Low oxygen levels.

47:32.704 --> 47:35.425
Somebody was in O2 sat in the 80s.

47:35.785 --> 47:37.847
They will tire out within a few hours.

47:38.127 --> 47:39.407
So what's your next step?

47:39.828 --> 47:43.730
Before COVID-19, I would recommend putting you on a breathing machine.

47:43.930 --> 47:45.471
I would have rushed to intubate.

47:45.551 --> 47:47.692
Because that was probably the right thing to do.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.393
I know when to put in the breathing tube.

47:49.493 --> 47:52.675
I've worked long enough and I've worked enough places with enough people.

47:53.115 --> 47:56.098
But in this disease, it is extremely confusing.

47:56.118 --> 47:58.200
You know, it just doesn't make sense.

48:04.407 --> 48:08.131
Listen, I stocked up for the apocalypse like most people.

48:08.151 --> 48:13.876
Now I just can't believe that I thought that I'd somehow be home to make all my frozen food.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.821
On a normal day in an ICU, you have very sick patients.

48:19.881 --> 48:22.842
Patients will are dying, but this is just different.

48:23.082 --> 48:30.504
It's just you have a disease we don't understand that is very deadly with patients that are scared and staff that are scared.

48:30.524 --> 48:36.246
And on top of that, it does not appear that we have a good treatment strategy.

48:36.606 --> 48:40.167
So he's convinced that it's a disease that's very deadly.

48:42.090 --> 48:44.712
but there's nobody dropping dead in New York City.

48:44.752 --> 48:49.376
There's nobody, they're not bringing in ambulances of dead people to the hospital.

48:50.777 --> 48:57.242
That's not happening at all, but they did give out DNR orders so that people were not resuscitated when they had a heart attack at home.

48:59.164 --> 49:03.047
So I don't know really where he gets this idea that it's a very deadly disease.

49:03.467 --> 49:06.910
I think it's a script that it's a very deadly disease.

49:06.970 --> 49:10.053
The message needs to get out that it's a very deadly disease.

49:12.108 --> 49:13.189
other than a ventilator.

49:13.609 --> 49:16.131
And we don't, we're not sure when to put a breathing tube in.

49:17.651 --> 49:19.993
You know, the crux of it is we don't want to put a breathing tube.

49:20.073 --> 49:22.815
We don't know when to put a breathing tube in.

49:22.875 --> 49:25.596
What he's admitting to you is there's no reason to do it.

49:26.637 --> 49:34.702
If a person has an 80% saturation but can talk, there's no reason to put them on a ventilator.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.103
But they just said, well, I guess I would.

49:38.124 --> 49:41.046
Anybody that can talk doesn't need to be on a ventilator.

49:42.426 --> 49:49.880
Maybe a breathing machine, so that would be supplementary oxygen, carefully monitored and re-humidified and combined with nitrogen.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.824
You see, this is the trick.

49:55.748 --> 49:59.170
that was played early in the pandemic that we don't know what we're doing.

49:59.210 --> 50:14.179
We have no idea what this is so different that you might just need to use whatever's in at hand, which might include supplementary oxygen with no breathing machine, just a tank and a mask like old people use.

50:15.840 --> 50:16.961
Because that's where they were.

50:17.061 --> 50:20.663
This is the, you know, the hospitals in New York with equipment and shit.

50:20.703 --> 50:22.444
This isn't the rural hospitals.

50:23.697 --> 50:27.100
with like four ventilators in their ICU, three of which are being used.

50:27.800 --> 50:35.767
And in those places, this theater resulted in the willy nilly use of supplementary oxygen.

50:35.847 --> 50:37.809
And he even made videos about it.

50:39.382 --> 50:47.210
to someone who doesn't need it, knowing that there's a 70% chance they'll die, and then we don't want to not put it in to someone who would need it.

50:47.991 --> 50:54.437
So, 70% chance they will die if they put him on a ventilator, but he thinks it's the disease killing them.

50:54.498 --> 50:58.441
You see, this is how remarkable this bullshit show is.

50:58.522 --> 50:59.963
That guy belongs in jail.

51:00.223 --> 51:00.624
Too late.

51:07.125 --> 51:12.653
Treat severe coronavirus cases like acute respiratory distress syndrome.

51:13.574 --> 51:19.322
Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also the term they use to describe the original SARS disease set.

51:20.643 --> 51:39.079
But in reality, according to all the papers that I've found and all the textbooks that I've found on ICU medicine and emergency medicine, ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a syndrome that most often results in a hospital from the improper use of pure frickin' oxygen.

51:40.600 --> 51:41.461
It's a script.

51:42.441 --> 51:44.123
It's a very malevolent script.

51:45.168 --> 51:53.993
that has been reiterated and adjusted from the first SARS, reiterated and adjusted from the MERS from decades, ladies and gentlemen.

51:54.033 --> 51:56.415
This is one continuous shit script.

52:13.203 --> 52:14.103
What does that say?

52:14.183 --> 52:20.704
Coronavirus patients have low oxygen but lack other distressing symptoms usually seen in ARDS.

52:21.285 --> 52:28.366
So we give them oxygen and then they develop all the symptoms of ARDS because that's what oxygen does.

52:29.906 --> 52:31.166
Here's the admission right here.

52:32.567 --> 52:34.267
Written by the New York Times in 2020.

52:35.887 --> 52:36.407
How's that?

52:37.588 --> 52:39.468
How's that for some bullshit right there?

52:40.455 --> 52:46.739
They don't have any of the other symptoms of ARDS until we give them supplementary oxygen.

52:46.759 --> 52:49.961
And then whoops, now they got it.

52:50.301 --> 53:02.308
You go to the ER and there's like, you know, 40 people that need oxygen and they all look terrible.

53:03.163 --> 53:06.793
But they can all talk to you in no apparent distress whatsoever.

53:07.033 --> 53:09.700
And then you get no apparent stress whatsoever.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.926
And then you give them oxygen and they tank.

53:13.049 --> 53:17.852
get them on a monitor and you look up and you see this oxygen saturation of like 45 or 50%.

53:19.433 --> 53:19.994
Bullshit.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.675
I'm calling bullshit on that.

53:21.835 --> 53:23.676
I'm calling bullshit on that.

53:23.716 --> 53:28.339
There's no fricking way anybody was in there with a 40% saturation.

53:28.379 --> 53:29.219
He's a liar.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.360
That's ridiculous.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.741
This is impossible.

53:31.941 --> 53:33.782
This is not possible.

53:34.143 --> 53:35.103
How can this be?

53:35.443 --> 53:39.046
It's just not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation that low.

53:39.426 --> 53:39.827
You know?

53:40.227 --> 53:41.388
This is strange.

53:41.448 --> 53:43.451
Like it's out of a horror movie.

53:43.591 --> 53:46.294
I've been... How can they be talking to you then?

53:46.734 --> 53:56.085
Is there not a doctor in the house that can evaluate the possibility that either that reading is wrong or something else is going on here?

53:56.145 --> 53:58.027
But this is remarkable, right?

53:58.067 --> 53:58.387
Because

53:59.520 --> 54:02.943
We are talking about, I would, I would, I don't even know what to say.

54:03.003 --> 54:04.144
These people are awful.

54:04.224 --> 54:06.726
And for sure, Kyle Seidel is the worst.

54:06.947 --> 54:09.689
Unable to sleep because I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

54:09.709 --> 54:12.011
This goes against anything I've ever believed.

54:12.291 --> 54:16.395
The paradigm of ARDS is not matching with the patients that I'm seeing.

54:17.135 --> 54:19.778
So it's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

54:19.898 --> 54:24.322
At the core of the core of the core, it is just what disease are we treating?

54:24.762 --> 54:25.042
You know?

54:25.062 --> 54:28.265
And are we treating something that is naturally aired?

54:28.325 --> 54:28.646
Yes.

54:28.966 --> 54:29.726
Or are we not?

54:30.507 --> 54:33.570
We protect the lung against what we do to the lung.

55:03.236 --> 55:04.398
The type L

55:05.171 --> 55:08.152
cannot be treated as a classical ARDS.

55:08.392 --> 55:18.836
And I do really think that this was another bamboozlement that they did, that the x-ray could tell you whether you had ARDS or not, independent of whether you might've had it from some other thing.

55:19.416 --> 55:24.478
Again, these are people who never had an x-ray of their lungs in the last 20 years.

55:24.518 --> 55:30.980
And then they went into the hospital and everybody told them that if they x-ray their lungs and it looks like that, they must have ARDS.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.842
couldn't, it couldn't be COPD from years ago.

55:36.902 --> 55:39.224
It couldn't be chronic fatigue syndrome from years ago.

55:39.264 --> 55:53.414
It couldn't be emphysema building up in their lungs from all the smoking or, or the lack of exercise or, you know, the, the, the myriad of explanations for that difference between those two things was exclusively attributed to a novel virus.

55:53.555 --> 56:01.961
And nobody questioned it on these narratives and these videos that we were all forced to watch because social media is not spontaneous.

56:04.597 --> 56:06.419
is not the classical RDS.

56:06.999 --> 56:09.381
You cannot do the same protocol for everybody.

56:10.222 --> 56:21.912
If they come and you don't have an idea if the patient is type L or type H, you probably do some disaster in 50% of the population.

56:22.933 --> 56:31.580
That's probably not entirely wrong, but it's the idea that you have to check for it because there is a novel virus and you can check for it with an x-ray as part of the problem.

56:40.384 --> 56:43.346
So they will do more harm than good for most coronavirus patients.

56:43.386 --> 56:44.127
And why is that?

56:44.187 --> 56:46.768
Because it's very simple for all you doctors out there.

56:47.249 --> 56:50.011
The application of pure oxygen is a toxin.

56:50.131 --> 56:50.871
It's a toxin.

56:50.911 --> 56:51.592
It's a toxin.

56:51.632 --> 56:52.332
It's toxic.

56:53.113 --> 56:54.053
You can't do that.

56:54.974 --> 56:58.116
And yet that's what these jackasses are all talking about doing.

56:59.602 --> 57:00.982
because the pulse ox was like 80.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.483
And one guy said it was like 40, but it wasn't.

57:03.903 --> 57:04.183
That's a lie.

57:04.244 --> 57:07.985
What he's saying is that you just have to be like gentle.

57:08.325 --> 57:14.667
You know, people will need a ventilator and those that do need as high oxygen as possible, as little pressure as possible.

57:15.067 --> 57:16.968
As high of oxygen as possible.

57:17.988 --> 57:20.229
As high of oxygen as possible.

57:20.249 --> 57:27.371
In order to buy time until this like demon virus stops.

57:33.012 --> 57:33.572
these patients.

57:33.892 --> 57:36.734
Oh, and now it's just fueling the broader descent.

57:37.374 --> 57:43.377
And so there were the, we can't have any descent right now, or it's going to screw up our response to the virus.

57:43.797 --> 57:47.219
Holy balls have ARDS.

57:47.739 --> 57:50.340
I think the editorial has both been misinterpreted.

57:50.460 --> 57:54.462
And I think people have misunderstood that it's just that it's an editorial.

57:54.542 --> 57:56.463
It's not a study and it's not a trial.

57:56.643 --> 58:01.726
I don't doubt that people have seen some cases with some terrifying low oxygen numbers on average,

58:02.355 --> 58:06.557
They're as sick as prior cohorts with ARDS.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.438
They're as sick as prior cohorts.

58:09.558 --> 58:16.781
So have they been taking the extreme examples that they could find in these hospitals and claiming that they've never seen this before?

58:17.201 --> 58:20.442
Cause it sure sounds like that doctor saying exactly that.

58:21.282 --> 58:25.684
That these people are no different than the extreme examples we've seen before.

58:26.424 --> 58:29.305
They've got to stop this script.

58:30.126 --> 58:30.926
This is wrong.

58:32.785 --> 58:36.826
and that you can see it now, you can hear it now, because some of them are not on a script.

58:36.866 --> 58:38.167
Some of them are just saying it.

58:39.707 --> 58:41.308
But Kyle Seidel's on a script.

58:41.908 --> 58:44.009
To say that it's not a settled question.

58:44.389 --> 58:47.890
Every hospital in the world is probably solving this problem slightly differently.

58:48.150 --> 58:54.272
We're using an early intubation strategy here, and of our first 66 patients, already a third of them have been extubated.

58:54.552 --> 59:00.694
I'm arguing for evidence-based medicine, which is something that we all purported to agree with before this outbreak.

59:01.087 --> 59:01.307
hit.

59:01.427 --> 59:03.489
We have large randomized controlled trials.

59:03.509 --> 59:08.853
The patients in those trials have met the same diagnostic criteria that our current patients meet.

59:09.153 --> 59:10.874
We should apply the results of the trials.

59:15.857 --> 59:19.760
Today, we do not rush to intubate.

59:20.181 --> 59:23.243
Intubation has become the last resort.

59:25.146 --> 59:26.287
and the protocol went.

59:26.707 --> 59:28.267
So it became a last resort.

59:28.327 --> 59:31.489
So how many people did they manslaughter?

59:31.529 --> 59:32.589
How many people were killed?

59:33.670 --> 59:35.651
This is the assessment that needs to happen.

59:37.451 --> 59:45.175
Because if this video is already saying that we used to do it as the first resort, because it's just so hard to tell whether they need it or not.

59:46.365 --> 59:48.647
And now we don't, we use it as the last resort.

59:48.687 --> 59:50.449
So how long has this been?

59:50.469 --> 59:53.392
Intubated has changed drastically.

59:53.632 --> 59:58.798
So within the last two weeks, I think what has been unacceptable has become very acceptable.

59:58.818 --> 01:00:00.700
Some of these patients don't need to be intubated.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.582
You, you watch them carefully.

01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:06.466
You make sure their oxygenation is, is adequate and they can recover.

01:00:07.106 --> 01:00:25.365
i am not saying we don't need ventilators but perhaps we need to think about how we're using them somebody this is scripted bullshit understand that right it's scripted bullshit from 2020 the debate about what to do what's the protocol how to do it it's all part of the same malevolent show

01:00:26.397 --> 01:00:34.322
The same malevolent show where everybody just seems to be completely naive that a half a million Americans have been killed by opioids in the last five years.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:48.772
Completely naive to the fact that there was a anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was gonna, you know, probably bankrupt social security and Medicare if we didn't do something about it that people like Ted Turner have been crying about for the last 20 years.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:52.454
These people are woefully unaware of that too, because this is a new disease.

01:00:52.514 --> 01:00:53.515
I can't really figure it out.

01:00:53.555 --> 01:00:55.376
I'm, I got all this frozen food.

01:00:55.396 --> 01:00:56.177
I'm not even eating it.

01:00:57.278 --> 01:00:58.219
and preferably people.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.282
See you in a minute.

01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:04.283
Galileo's head was on the block

01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:27.529
The crime was looking up the truth.

01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:39.418
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode, I try to trace them to my youth.

01:01:39.679 --> 01:01:46.744
And then you had to bring up reincarnation over a couple of beers the other night.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:02:01.481
And now I'm serving time for mistakes Made by another in another lifetime How long till my soul gets it right?

01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:06.305
Did any human being ever reach that kind of light?

01:02:06.325 --> 01:02:16.473
I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight

01:02:20.418 --> 01:02:28.443
And then I think about my fear of motion, which I never could explain.

01:02:30.005 --> 01:02:38.550
Some other fool across the ocean years ago must have crashed his little airplane.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:43.714
How long till my soul gets it right in any human form?

01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:46.730
to reach that kind of light.

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:57.855
I call on the resting soul of Galileo, king of night vision, king of insight.

01:02:58.836 --> 01:03:00.737
I'm not making a joke.

01:03:01.217 --> 01:03:02.117
You know me.

01:03:02.257 --> 01:03:06.640
I take everything so seriously.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:13.483
If we wait for the time till our souls get it right, then at least I know

01:03:52.907 --> 01:04:06.221
I offer thanks to those before me That's all I've got to say Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime

01:04:10.838 --> 01:04:26.533
But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration To let the next life off the hook But she'll say, look what I had to overcome From my last life, I think I'll rise

01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:59.369
Till my soul gets it right Can a human being ever reach the highest light Except for the resting soul Of Galileo King of night vision King of insight How long Till my soul gets it right Till we reach the highest point Till my soul gets it right Till we reach the highest point

01:05:07.387 --> 01:05:09.848
Oh, it's hard not to like the Indigo Girls.

01:05:09.908 --> 01:05:11.429
I don't care what you say about them.

01:05:11.529 --> 01:05:12.009
I love them.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:20.814
I saw them in concert in Chicago, and it was a great concert with exactly as amount of energy you'd expect them to have.

01:05:20.894 --> 01:05:27.397
Actually, JJ Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:05:27.645 --> 01:05:34.048
I just wanted to get back to this because I think the theater is so thin right now.

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:36.269
As I titled the show, the bricks are visible.

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:40.851
The bricks are these monkeys on social media.

01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:46.934
The bricks are the narrative that these monkeys have sustained with their performance.

01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:51.636
and the scripted bullshit that they are saying over the last six years.

01:05:52.137 --> 01:05:58.340
And I don't care anymore whether they're witting or unwitting because anybody that's still on script has to be on team now.

01:05:59.361 --> 01:06:11.268
Even if it's just because she believes her husband is not a liar, she believes her husband is actually just coming up with these ideas on his own, when in fact he's not, he's a scripted bullshitter.

01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:15.850
And he has been a vapid scripted bullshitter since I met him on Signal in 2020.

01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:22.411
This is a monster because any reasonable study of his

01:06:24.252 --> 01:06:39.283
track record would reveal, for example, a six year track record with not a single podcast with a single diagram of what he considers the natural immune system and how it's organized.

01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:47.028
Not one attempt at teaching that or talking about it or showing that he understands the basics of it.

01:06:47.108 --> 01:06:53.573
Whereas in my list of videos that I've done over the last five years, there's probably a hundred

01:06:54.153 --> 01:07:21.474
videos where i tried to teach the immune system in combination with the ridiculousness that virology represents in the light of that so i just want to bring to your attention that the admissions that they make include the timeline and you can see it so amazingly right now it might hurt but brett weinstein is such a scripted fraud

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:32.309
that I don't think I'll ever have the privilege of being in the same place as him again, because like Jessica Rose decided not to come to Brownstone in Pittsburgh in November of 2024 or 3, 4,

01:07:35.674 --> 01:07:37.315
three, it was four.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:43.977
She will, she, uh, Brett Weinstein will never show up at another event that I'm registered to.

01:07:44.597 --> 01:08:01.583
I'm, I almost guarantee it because he cannot stand the scrutiny that I would represent because his fraud is based on him having never met me, never having read a signal chat from me, and more importantly, never having learned anything about

01:08:03.072 --> 01:08:16.778
biology from me, even though I have a whole signal chat on my phone where I teach him everything that he says with regard to the simple version of why mRNA doesn't work.

01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:19.459
Without saying the word transfection, of course, he's not going to do that.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:29.563
This is remarkable though, because he is going to do it in the context of saying that he's been a guy who's been calling out Vinay Prasad.

01:08:30.894 --> 01:08:33.436
and calling out ZDogg.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:45.786
And so he's not going to jump to the conclusion that, wow, maybe these guys were scripted on their bullshit because I don't understand how these two podcasting buddies are now at the FDA together.

01:08:45.846 --> 01:08:46.567
That's weird.

01:08:47.267 --> 01:08:49.850
Bret Weinstein's not going to question that at all.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.453
But instead, he's going to try to make it a story about himself

01:08:54.313 --> 01:09:03.261
and these two guys focusing on the wrong things or not getting it as right as as as as Brett and Heather got it right.

01:09:03.781 --> 01:09:10.908
So when he starts out in this video he's talking about Vinay Prasad and then he will refer to his partner in crime ZDogg.

01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:16.913
I might have to escape and start it again.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:28.099
during COVID, where he played a positive role in some regards and a very negative role.

01:09:28.119 --> 01:09:28.779
That's Vinay.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:29.940
He's talking about Vinay.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:38.425
And you will remember Zubin Damania, ZDogg, um, were frequent, uh, uh, podcasts.

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:49.032
Um, At this stage, you should realize that if they mentioned them and they say them and there's a rivalry between them, it is manufactured.

01:09:50.205 --> 01:09:55.832
That's why Robert Malone sued Jane Ruby and the Breggins.

01:09:56.393 --> 01:10:01.219
That's why George Webb pretended to sue Robert Malone.

01:10:02.401 --> 01:10:06.043
That's why Robert Malone will never sue me for calling him a traitor or a liar.

01:10:06.643 --> 01:10:12.886
That's why Jill Glasspool Malone will never sue me because I call her a traitor and a liar every day.

01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:14.987
And if I haven't, I would like to do it again today.

01:10:15.448 --> 01:10:20.590
Jill Glasspool Malone is a traitor and a liar, but they're never gonna sue me for that.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:25.072
They sued the Breggins for saying that they said something like mass psychosis or something.

01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:30.115
It's just an absurd show with scripted bullshitters.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:46.356
Now remember, first of all, in this same podcast, which I'm not gonna play right now because there's just too many hits, he claims that Robert Malone lost the Nobel Prize because he came on the Dark Horse podcast in June of 2021.

01:10:48.818 --> 01:10:49.938
I shit you not.

01:10:51.219 --> 01:10:57.003
Bret Weinstein claims that Robert Malone lost the Nobel Prize because he came on his podcast

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:03.408
And of course, the consequences for Brett's family were that their YouTube was demonetized as a result.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:08.411
See you later, Catherine.

01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:09.572
Good to see you in the chat.

01:11:11.493 --> 01:11:12.393
I don't know what you would call them.

01:11:12.413 --> 01:11:20.937
I think it was Zubin's podcast, but Vinay was frequently on as a guest and they would talk about COVID and they were, you know, positive in some ways.

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:29.481
They had a certain amount of heterodoxy to them, but they were actually quite nasty to us specifically, Zubin especially.

01:11:30.043 --> 01:11:36.567
Now, like censorship was used to drive people's attention to where they wanted it to go.

01:11:36.587 --> 01:11:42.411
You know, like the censorship of Robert Malone on LinkedIn got everybody to go to Gab with him.

01:11:42.951 --> 01:11:51.136
The censorship of Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein is what got everybody to go to locals.

01:11:53.106 --> 01:12:07.976
And so just like censorship, they also use these fake rivalries, these fake arguments like Kevin McCairn and Andrew Kaufman did at the beginning of the pandemic, where Kevin McCairn was telling everybody that we had to fight against the no virus people.

01:12:08.016 --> 01:12:09.737
And here's a list of who I'm talking about.

01:12:11.198 --> 01:12:14.740
And this is nothing but a continuation of that same fake

01:12:16.013 --> 01:12:39.525
script where everybody is kind of queued up against each other that's the same thing that Sam Cedar does when he makes fun of Tim Pool or when Sam Cedar makes fun of Tim Pool promoting Brett Weinstein and then makes fun of Brett Weinstein because Brett Weinstein's a dumbass it's all the same network of shitheads and as long as you're watching one part of that Lollapalooza of Liars it doesn't matter where you wander

01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:48.329
It doesn't matter what stage you're at or what concession stand you go to, you're screwed because you got the armband on.

01:12:48.429 --> 01:12:58.234
Regarding ivermectin, and there are a couple... I want to show this to you.

01:12:58.915 --> 01:13:01.116
It's about ivermectin.

01:13:02.396 --> 01:13:03.237
For some reason,

01:13:03.777 --> 01:13:05.378
People want to turn to conspiracies.

01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:08.481
Bret Weinstein wants to turn to conspiracies when he talks about ivermectin.

01:13:08.501 --> 01:13:11.363
Their medical-industrial complex is keeping ivermectin down.

01:13:11.524 --> 01:13:12.304
Oh, geez, Bret.

01:13:12.564 --> 01:13:21.092
We have so much... And so now you can see it, right, already, that Zubin creates the opposing force and the ridiculous nature.

01:13:21.192 --> 01:13:22.333
Ivermectin is dumb.

01:13:22.793 --> 01:13:27.257
And at the same time, over here, we have all these people who are saying, no, no, it's not ridiculous at all.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:36.422
But they're all willing to say each other's name, and they're all willing to make a big fuss about the other person.

01:13:38.763 --> 01:13:39.723
That's how you can see it.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:52.709
If they say their name, you know, not like JJ Cooey, but they say their name over and over and over again, they say the website, oh yeah, you know, Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA.

01:13:54.824 --> 01:14:01.229
fucking time to sit and think about keeping ivermectin down, rank and file doctors, even doctors high up in leadership.

01:14:01.249 --> 01:14:07.454
We go, man, we just sit around thinking, God damn, how are we going to stop this cheap and effective drug from being released?

01:14:07.494 --> 01:14:08.654
Make no mistake about it.

01:14:08.734 --> 01:14:19.523
Brett Weinstein is using this video to try and claim authenticity, to try and claim that this video means that he was right and there's evidence that other people were wrong.

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:39.368
And what I would like to suggest to you is if you imagine a script on a longer timescale in a couple weeks, you can see how ridiculously easy it would be to put people on the web and give them scripts and make sure you tell, hey, you gotta do a bad one on Brett Weinstein today because he's talking all about ivermectin.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:47.270
And if this dipshit doesn't know, if this dipshit is just a wannabe performer who wants more followers and more fame,

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:57.438
and he'll read any script that he's given, he'll sing any song or do any spoof video he's given, because he just wants to be the Weird Al Yankovic version of Da Doctor.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:07.927
Then if you cue this guy up and say, you need to do something really mean and say the F word a couple times about Bret Weinstein and Ivermectin, he'll do it.

01:15:08.727 --> 01:15:13.752
And then a couple years later, this guy can use that video as clout.

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:19.012
And can you see how social media is being weaponized against you?

01:15:21.114 --> 01:15:30.142
If Brett Weinstein's wife said my name and said that I was insisting it should be called transfection in 2021 and didn't say it until 2022.

01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:35.968
And now they're here pretending that this is their opposition.

01:15:36.068 --> 01:15:39.811
This is their evidence that they are good guys.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:59.657
while ignoring the fact that they were getting tutelage from me, listening to me, reading my review as I was writing it with Piper Stover, unbeknownst to me, until May of 2021, when I had all this biology down, including the fact that they were lying about a background signal that these people still don't get.

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.279
It's because they're on a script.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.183
and anything that they seem to absorb or bring in is a fraction of the truth.

01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:10.565
And you will see it in spades today.

01:16:10.845 --> 01:16:14.767
It's to the public because it would save lives and we better promote our vaccines because we're getting kickbacks.

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:17.229
Dude, shut the fuck up, Brett Weinstein.

01:16:17.829 --> 01:16:18.790
You're a smart guy.

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:20.471
You're very articulate.

01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:21.832
You do understand science.

01:16:21.892 --> 01:16:23.413
What is wrong with you, dude?

01:16:24.293 --> 01:16:29.056
What is- So you are a smart guy, you are articulate, and you,

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.142
You understand science, so you have my approval.

01:16:35.902 --> 01:16:37.083
You are a smart guy.

01:16:37.543 --> 01:16:38.824
You understand science.

01:16:38.924 --> 01:16:39.944
What's wrong with you?

01:16:42.605 --> 01:16:48.728
And of course, anybody that's watching this video that has any curiosity at all is gonna go find out and listen to Brett and Heather.

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:51.471
fucking wrong with you.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:55.756
Sam Harris did a really good piece about what Brett and Heather are doing.

01:16:55.776 --> 01:16:57.918
You know, I used to have a lot of fucking respect for those guys.

01:16:58.119 --> 01:17:00.161
They have jumped off the deep end of madness.

01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:03.324
There's nothing here if he's going to use the F word like this.

01:17:03.364 --> 01:17:08.270
This is nothing here but psychological warfare because nobody with a

01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:23.627
sort of attitude about being a professional and also a dad and also a doctor would ever use the f-word this many times so ridiculously and he would have taken this video down I mean it's just ridiculous this is this is absurd

01:17:24.768 --> 01:17:29.630
Even in my most angry moments, spontaneously on my live stream, and this is not a live stream.

01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:33.432
On my live stream, I've never used the F word like this guy's using it.

01:17:33.472 --> 01:17:35.593
And that shows you that this is a script.

01:17:36.054 --> 01:17:38.395
Because again, this is not a live stream.

01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:40.076
This is an uploaded video.

01:17:40.176 --> 01:17:46.199
Even after all the fireworks were over with and he didn't, and he watched it and he edited, he decided that's what he wanted to put up.

01:17:46.259 --> 01:17:47.959
And that's how you can see it's a script.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.681
Seriously, if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's good for you.

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:52.962
It's better that you don't.

01:17:53.939 --> 01:18:01.283
Like if you have to rely on conspiracy and regulatory capture and all that to explain everything, there's something wrong with you, all right?

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.826
Also talk to a real fucking immunologist.

01:18:05.606 --> 01:18:10.149
Okay, so that is- When is that from?

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:12.250
I don't remember.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:20.435
He doesn't remember when it's from because he doesn't want you to know where this is on the timeline because he doesn't want an accurate timeline.

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.968
And that is not an understatement.

01:18:25.008 --> 01:18:27.330
That's exactly the way the script works.

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:38.402
If he's allowed or forced to accurately reflect on the script that he was given to read, he too will see himself as a jackass.

01:18:39.803 --> 01:18:40.904
That's the trick here.

01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:43.907
We can't, we can't, his handlers,

01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:55.785
cannot allow him to think too hard about what they scripted him to say in 2020 or 2021, or he might actually be smart enough to figure out that they played him.

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:02.288
He doesn't even know when that fricking video is from.

01:19:02.848 --> 01:19:07.890
It would be kind of relevant if it was before or after Robert Malone was on his stream, for example.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.851
Sometime.

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:11.895
sort of mid-COVID.

01:19:13.076 --> 01:19:15.097
Mid-COVID, he says.

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:17.099
Mid-COVID.

01:19:17.379 --> 01:19:18.079
Stop lying.

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.341
Stop lying.

01:19:20.681 --> 01:19:21.302
Wow.

01:19:22.923 --> 01:19:25.845
But the next one is even more interesting.

01:19:25.885 --> 01:19:27.506
The next one is not just Zubin.

01:19:27.706 --> 01:19:36.933
It's Zubin and his friend, Vinay Prasad, and Marty Marquet, who's now the FDA head.

01:19:36.993 --> 01:19:37.674
But before, sorry.

01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:38.795
Marty Marquet?

01:19:39.915 --> 01:19:40.595
McCary?

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:44.737
These two shitheads can't even say his name.

01:19:44.837 --> 01:19:47.598
So I guess they don't know that he has a UK passport.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:59.704
These two clowns didn't even know Gottlieb's name when they showed a clip of him the other day, talking about taking aluminum out of the shots.

01:20:00.124 --> 01:20:00.944
They made fun of him.

01:20:00.964 --> 01:20:03.145
And then she was like, who is that guy anyway?

01:20:04.146 --> 01:20:08.408
You know, the guy who was the head of the FDA during COVID and now sits on the board of Pfizer.

01:20:10.063 --> 01:20:17.257
duo of shitheads with their fake safari shirt colors and shit beetle here didn't even know his name.

01:20:19.963 --> 01:20:20.544
I hadn't seen that.

01:20:21.084 --> 01:20:27.270
It's just an obvious straw man about how it would work, about what regulatory capture looks like.

01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:36.178
I mean, he conflates regulatory capture with rank-and-file doctors actively keeping things from patients, which is not the same thing.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.120
Yeah, it's preposterous.

01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:41.042
And it is completely in conflict, you know.

01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:42.023
On the one hand,

01:20:44.185 --> 01:21:07.114
He is capable of seeing that there were things done on the vaccine side that weren't right And the point is he just doesn't have the imagination or no, he thinks you're smart and you know the science But he used the f-word like five times to insult you It's not that dissimilar to how for a year and a half or two years kevin mccarran was on the internet putting hot dogs in sam bailey's mouth and calling her a whore

01:21:07.754 --> 01:21:19.240
And then suddenly in 2022, because the script called for it, Mark Bailey and Kevin McCarran did a long stream with Tim Truth about whether or not viruses are real or not.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.300
Stop lying!

01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:24.482
It's all one malevolent script.

01:21:24.642 --> 01:21:27.564
It's all one little lollapalooza of liars.

01:21:27.624 --> 01:21:34.327
And they're all spread around the world because these shitheads needed to be spread around the world to create an illusion of consensus.

01:21:35.802 --> 01:21:49.065
or to see what happened on the repurposed drug side, which, of course, as we've talked at length about, was it was very important that there not be an alternative for various reasons.

01:21:49.145 --> 01:21:51.866
The EUA narrowly requires it, as you pointed out so many.

01:21:51.946 --> 01:22:01.849
So now we're going to talk about the fact that they played around with ivermectin because they didn't want the EUA not to be granted, because if there are other ways to cure the disease, then you can't get an EUA.

01:22:02.949 --> 01:22:03.249
Stop.

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:14.836
But that's ridiculous, of course, because then there wouldn't be 220 EUAs granted for PCR diagnostics, because once you had one that worked, you wouldn't make 220 more of them.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.019
So this is a lie.

01:22:19.079 --> 01:22:22.381
The EUAs were being given out whenever they were applied for.

01:22:22.421 --> 01:22:27.024
There was no process here of making sure that we need an EUA.

01:22:27.064 --> 01:22:28.585
The EUAs were turned on.

01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:31.172
That's how this happened.

01:22:31.192 --> 01:22:32.873
The EUAs were turned on.

01:22:32.953 --> 01:22:34.934
So this is already a bullshit lie.

01:22:35.234 --> 01:22:37.215
Just going to have to stop it every five seconds.

01:22:37.235 --> 01:22:37.996
This is so bad.

01:22:38.016 --> 01:22:38.676
Here's a go.

01:22:39.096 --> 01:22:44.720
But also just generally to the extent that there was a radical injection

01:22:45.976 --> 01:22:57.150
and a very well understood, very safe drug, which had better efficacy with respect to addressing the disease, lots of people would have opted against the injection.

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:59.633
And so it needed to not be viable.

01:22:59.773 --> 01:23:02.837
And there's no mention of hydroxychloroquine and zinc.

01:23:03.795 --> 01:23:09.379
No mention of the role of zinc and the fact that ivermectin might not do you very much good if you didn't have zinc or anything.

01:23:09.779 --> 01:23:10.640
No, nothing.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:23.469
Just one drug right now is ivermectin because, of course, Zubin was also scripted to say just one drug, ivermectin, not hydroxychloroquine or just the repurposed drugs in general.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.544
But can we go to the other video here?

01:23:28.564 --> 01:23:32.730
These are political anger backlash from this mandate.

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:34.492
There they are, the children again.

01:23:34.532 --> 01:23:35.073
Here we go.

01:23:35.153 --> 01:23:36.835
And of course, it's the threesome, right?

01:23:37.296 --> 01:23:40.420
And remember, he's not going to realize that it's a little fishy.

01:23:41.618 --> 01:23:51.170
that this Indian and that Indian and the UK guy were doing podcasts together and then two of the three of them got to the top of the FDA.

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:58.118
He's not gonna see that as weird even though these two guys are at Stanford where also all this other shit is occurring.

01:23:59.761 --> 01:24:06.449
Internet observatory of Palantir and and Huberman is from and Stanford is nasty.

01:24:06.609 --> 01:24:10.054
Oh Well, how is it possible that we're allowing this to happen?

01:24:10.114 --> 01:24:17.343
It created never backs it created never backs Empowered idiots like Malone and McCullough who are out there spouting bullshit

01:24:18.024 --> 01:24:24.349
Oh, and they also say Malone and McCullough, so they just say the names of these people that we don't want anybody to know.

01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:33.118
They just say the names of these people that we don't want anybody to know who just serendipitously ended up on the ACIP this year.

01:24:33.138 --> 01:24:35.320
Oops.

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:42.980
Just like these guys accidentally ended up at the CBER and at FDA, you know, just accidentally, I don't know.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.881
We were just trying to podcast to save the world.

01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:49.442
And we found ourselves falling face first into the butter.

01:24:49.962 --> 01:24:53.623
And now I'm head of the FDA and my buddy is head of CBER.

01:24:54.084 --> 01:24:57.245
And we can talk a lot of shit about cancer, because that's what we used to work on.

01:24:57.925 --> 01:25:00.205
Insane talk, and it empowered them.

01:25:00.285 --> 01:25:01.466
They're like the Nazgul, they're like,

01:25:02.749 --> 01:25:04.553
Because the government is idiotic.

01:25:05.716 --> 01:25:12.431
You always empower people who are wrong when you have a credibility vacuum and when you overplay your hand.

01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:22.324
Okay, so there you have Vinay Prasad, who is in charge of basically vaccine safety.

01:25:22.344 --> 01:25:23.124
Before he was.

01:25:23.224 --> 01:25:25.226
Before he was, but this is same guy.

01:25:25.266 --> 01:25:27.308
And Marty Marquet, who's now in charge of the FDA.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.188
This is also before.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:32.272
He still can't say that sucker's name, which is really just pathetic.

01:25:33.853 --> 01:25:35.895
I'll just call it professionalism, right?

01:25:36.335 --> 01:25:39.197
If you're going to masquerade as somebody who's going to make a show,

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:45.474
And you can't improvise or you can't learn somebody's names or you need a script or some shit like that.

01:25:45.494 --> 01:25:46.595
You better get good at it.

01:25:47.155 --> 01:25:55.242
It's just like, I kind of feel like, you know, you're asking people to... This guy is such a fraud.

01:25:55.502 --> 01:25:58.024
Like what a piece of junk this guy is.

01:25:58.344 --> 01:25:58.784
He was there.

01:26:00.206 --> 01:26:16.150
And you can hear, you know, they're nodding along with Zubin Damania here, who is arguing that, you know, Robert Malone is a crazed Nazgul like character.

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:18.351
Well, you heard him on the ACIP committee.

01:26:18.371 --> 01:26:19.951
Did that sound crazed to you?

01:26:20.351 --> 01:26:22.632
That sounded like the most

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:30.815
careful, possible presentation of an actually alarming situation you could imagine.

01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:37.178
And here he's being portrayed as a crazy person with, you know, yeah, Vinay did not say it, nor did Markay say it.

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:46.203
But the point is, you've got an ethos, which is, well, let's not get carried away with, you know, concerns about pharmaceutical excesses.

01:26:46.263 --> 01:26:47.643
What is she typing, I wonder?

01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:51.285
And so the upshot of all of this is,

01:26:54.813 --> 01:26:55.473
That's interesting.

01:26:55.493 --> 01:26:56.013
I find that interesting.

01:26:56.033 --> 01:27:00.854
At the point, it became clear that Pharma wildly overplayed its hand.

01:27:00.874 --> 01:27:01.595
He turned a page, by the way.

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.615
Pharma wildly overplayed its hand.

01:27:03.735 --> 01:27:05.696
Pharma wildly overplayed its hand.

01:27:06.716 --> 01:27:14.938
Wasn't going to be able to just simply shout down all of us who had concerns about the mRNA platform as anti-vaxxers, that that wasn't going to work.

01:27:15.038 --> 01:27:16.758
There were too many vaccine injuries.

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:19.879
People were too aware that they had been conned.

01:27:20.059 --> 01:27:23.420
How many people with a vaccine injury has he had on his show?

01:27:26.894 --> 01:27:32.102
How many people with a person that died of the protocols has he had on his show?

01:27:33.985 --> 01:27:35.787
And now you can see how treacherous he is.

01:27:36.989 --> 01:27:40.895
How much of a traitor, fraud, piece of shit of a man this guy is.

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:46.674
told they wouldn't get COVID, they got the shot, then they did get COVID.

01:27:47.274 --> 01:27:51.919
So there was too much awareness that something that they had been told was incorrect.

01:27:51.959 --> 01:28:01.810
At the point pharma discovered it had overplayed its hand and that it had basically cratered any trust that existed for that entire industry, there is a fallback position.

01:28:02.833 --> 01:28:07.455
And my concern is, do I think Vinay Prasad is in on it?

01:28:08.015 --> 01:28:08.235
No.

01:28:08.776 --> 01:28:16.039
I think Vinay Prasad probably looks at himself in the mirror and he thinks, you know, these shots were oversold.

01:28:16.319 --> 01:28:17.139
They're dangerous.

01:28:17.179 --> 01:28:24.922
He's already participated in reducing the population for whom they are recommended radically.

01:28:26.383 --> 01:28:36.635
He probably looks at himself in the mirror and he thinks the number of people that I have saved from being injected with this risky shot is huge and he probably feels pretty good about himself.

01:28:37.376 --> 01:28:40.199
But what he doesn't realize is that he's being drafted into

01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:52.456
the highest echelon of the middle ground scramble in which Pharma is attempting to create the impression that actually it was reasonable to inject these things into anybody.

01:28:52.836 --> 01:28:53.357
And it isn't.

01:28:53.657 --> 01:28:59.304
And so that... Keep in mind that one of the enchantments that he's casting here is very, very subtle.

01:29:00.525 --> 01:29:03.008
And it is this middle ground scramble.

01:29:03.388 --> 01:29:09.473
And when he says middle ground scramble, what he's implying is that he's on a far end of a spectrum.

01:29:10.274 --> 01:29:14.818
And then there's a middle ground, and then there's another end of the spectrum over there, and he's on one end of it.

01:29:15.699 --> 01:29:18.101
And that's a limited spectrum of debate.

01:29:18.141 --> 01:29:26.349
That's the illusion that gets created when you either have to choose between dipshit number one named Zubin, or dipshit number two named Brett.

01:29:27.089 --> 01:29:35.573
And that's really the extraordinary trap we're in and it takes extraordinary morons like Brett Weinstein to construct such a trap.

01:29:36.154 --> 01:29:42.537
Nobody would willingly do this if they didn't actually think that they were doing something smart.

01:29:42.597 --> 01:29:50.341
He's actually talking very accurately about Vinay, very accurately about Marty, very accurately about himself.

01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:55.785
Because I don't think any of these people are sophisticated enough to know that they have been so played.

01:29:56.246 --> 01:30:02.291
They have just put a ridiculous amount of trust in state actors and liars.

01:30:02.351 --> 01:30:03.833
Now, I could be wrong.

01:30:04.761 --> 01:30:20.368
It could be that he's in on it in a much deeper way and knows for sure that his dad and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Donald Trump are all working together with the rest of the DNC to make this anti-conservative movement just tank in America.

01:30:20.928 --> 01:30:21.928
Because that's what I see.

01:30:22.468 --> 01:30:32.873
I see a Trojan horse that's leading the conservative right in America off a cliff where they've put all their eggs into the wrong basket and they're too stubborn to realize it.

01:30:33.633 --> 01:30:55.961
and so they're still believing that somehow behind all the bullshit of Donald Trump doing all the bullshit that he's doing now he's still a good guy he's just juggling and it's 3d chess or 5d warfare or whatever the hell these shitheads think it is and in reality these people are all being used by the same ruling elite they are just performing a show and you don't need to think of

01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:21.570
Of Donald Trump any smarter than Brett Weinstein any smarter than Zubin and any smarter than Robert F. Kennedy jr they're all about mid-level dumb and about mid-level smart and ridiculously aware that there is a Governing elite and that they can audition to be a part of it that's what we're faced with is did you know did the process that

01:31:22.625 --> 01:31:26.288
Persad himself alludes to in the tweet, which we didn't see.

01:31:26.408 --> 01:31:35.416
And the sub stack that he wrote, um, the process in which he became sending people to his sub stack again, if you didn't see it, go check it, right?

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:43.723
This is all part of the same illusion promoting X. Cause I didn't show the tweet, but we should have shown it and promoting sub stack.

01:31:43.743 --> 01:31:46.165
These are all part of the same social media network.

01:31:48.882 --> 01:31:51.806
That's one of the reasons why I don't write a substack very often.

01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:53.368
I don't want to feed that beast.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.924
empowered, it trained him to find nuance where there isn't any.

01:32:00.984 --> 01:32:02.085
That's really the question.

01:32:02.345 --> 01:32:12.654
You know, we have shots that carry a tremendous danger and for which it is very difficult to make a rational argument that it is in anyone's interest to take them at this point.

01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:21.822
And yet, and yet he still can't explain the reason why is because intramuscular injection in general is biologically unsound.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:27.951
even though he claims to be a biologist who's really keen on understanding complex systems.

01:32:28.871 --> 01:32:30.812
And he's going to keep saying complex systems.

01:32:30.852 --> 01:32:39.957
He's never going to say, hey, pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, because that would describe an irreducible complexity rather than a complex system.

01:32:40.938 --> 01:32:46.280
And when he changes to saying pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, I will be dead.

01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:47.401
That's what will happen.

01:32:47.601 --> 01:32:49.482
And when I'm dead, he will change to that.

01:32:49.502 --> 01:32:51.083
He'll probably even write a book about it.

01:32:53.459 --> 01:33:06.567
They're not only still on the market, but they're being recommended for people in spite of an increasingly clear picture of, yes, heart damage, but also body-wide damage that really should be our focus.

01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:15.192
Frankly, all you need to know is that they didn't stay in the deltoid where we were told they would stay.

01:33:15.412 --> 01:33:16.833
That's not all you need to know.

01:33:17.093 --> 01:33:18.314
You see, that's the problem.

01:33:18.354 --> 01:33:19.375
That is the illusion.

01:33:20.686 --> 01:33:30.108
that the reason why Robert Malone had to go public was because Byron Bridle revealed that they didn't stay in the deltoid, that's for sure.

01:33:30.588 --> 01:33:50.011
Interestingly enough, don't forget that the company called Inovio that was purchased by Robert Malone's company, GeneTronic or whatever, that company specialized in electroporation internally in the deltoid muscle, not on the skin, but deltoid electroporation.

01:33:52.202 --> 01:34:06.390
Now the benefit of deltoid electroporation is that the DNA will exclusively be electroporated at the site of electroporation and the rest of the DNA, if it does float away from the injection site, will be cleaned up rapidly by the body.

01:34:08.571 --> 01:34:17.036
And so it's kind of curious that Robert Malone has a technology that could be potentially one of the updates to genetic vaccines in the future.

01:34:19.534 --> 01:34:47.135
uniquely positioned and uniquely promoted by as wide a range as people as Vinay Prasad and Zubin all agreeing that he was a Nazgul in 2021 now talking about him at the ACIP and This is the script and we are dead balls on it It was never plausible that they were going to they were always going to leak out but the manufacturers

01:34:47.981 --> 01:34:49.302
It was never plausible.

01:34:49.862 --> 01:34:56.627
And that's again, it's skipping this thing that I tried to get him to understand for a year on Signal.

01:34:57.868 --> 01:35:03.972
We already know it doesn't stay there because we transfect animals all the time.

01:35:05.053 --> 01:35:08.755
We already know it won't work because we do it all the time.

01:35:08.835 --> 01:35:13.879
And in animals, I tried to explain to him, when you transfect the brain of a mouse,

01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:19.917
The transfection eventually dies or it gets killed or it gets removed by the immune system.

01:35:19.937 --> 01:35:26.583
We don't really know for sure because when we transfect mice, we kill them before that happens so that we can still see what we did.

01:35:29.226 --> 01:35:30.987
Yes, I explained that to him too in 2021.

01:35:34.102 --> 01:35:36.783
And yeah, he's still not explaining it to anyone else.

01:35:36.823 --> 01:35:45.705
He's still claiming that he is at the cutting edge of understanding with this very limited simplification of how dangerous transfection is.

01:35:45.785 --> 01:35:46.405
It's just crazy.

01:35:56.147 --> 01:36:02.510
And so remember, one of the proofs you might need is that, let me get out of here and make sure that this is right.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:04.131
I apologize.

01:36:07.732 --> 01:36:17.376
It's not right.

01:36:17.657 --> 01:36:25.320
It would be extremely curious, right, if I could find another example of ZDogg promoting somebody in the mythology.

01:36:26.744 --> 01:36:35.854
So again, what I'm suggesting to you is, is that ZDogg would be scripted to promote people that they want alternative people to go to.

01:36:36.655 --> 01:36:39.318
So ZDogg would never have done a video about me.

01:36:39.338 --> 01:36:43.182
He would never have done a video about, uh,

01:36:43.959 --> 01:36:49.344
Maybe even Kevin McKernan, like they, they send you to places.

01:36:49.384 --> 01:36:52.787
That's why he did the swearing video about Brett Weinstein.

01:36:53.227 --> 01:36:58.992
And I think this is evidence for him being scripted because why else would you do this video?

01:36:59.363 --> 01:37:02.365
Everybody, it's Dr. Zubin Damania, aka ZDoggMD.

01:37:02.445 --> 01:37:06.668
Alright, about a million people have sent me this clip.

01:37:06.748 --> 01:37:13.733
So the illusion of consensus that he's casting here is that his followers, like millions of them, have already sent him this clip.

01:37:14.334 --> 01:37:20.138
Which, to anybody listening to this video, seems like there's an illusion of consensus that I need to see this clip too.

01:37:21.212 --> 01:37:30.265
plandemic about the conspiracy with Fauci and Dr. Judy Mikevich, and I got to admit, I am shook.

01:37:31.849 --> 01:37:44.517
After having watched the whole thing, I am shook that Americans are so freaking stupid as to take even a second of this horrible garbage conspiracy nonsense seriously.

01:37:45.158 --> 01:37:45.518
Really?

01:37:45.538 --> 01:37:48.720
You guys want me to sit and debunk this garbage?

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.982
What is wrong with us as a people?

01:37:52.282 --> 01:37:54.103
What's gone wrong with our education?

01:37:54.163 --> 01:37:56.205
What's gone wrong with our common sense?

01:37:56.585 --> 01:38:00.668
The first five seconds of that video,

01:38:02.037 --> 01:38:05.239
reeks of crazy sauce, and no one can recognize that.

01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:09.121
It has millions of views, YouTube keeps taking it down, which you know I don't believe in censorship.

01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:22.249
But guys, Judy Mikevich, if you do a simple Google search, you can find out the main claim of the video is that she was falsely arrested with no charges for like going against Fauci or something.

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:34.171
No, she was arrested because she took, stole equipment, notes, and data from a lab that she was fired from.

01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:36.054
She's a PhD scientist.

01:38:37.556 --> 01:38:39.058
She was known for, in 2009,

01:38:42.612 --> 01:38:48.636
putting out a paper saying that chronic fatigue syndrome was caused by a murine virus.

01:38:49.436 --> 01:38:58.601
Well, it turns out that paper was retracted from science when they realized no one could replicate it and her methods and science were completely shoddy.

01:38:59.181 --> 01:39:05.804
Now ever since then, she's been on a mission to try to prove to people that she's not crazy.

01:39:06.304 --> 01:39:09.705
And this video does not help that.

01:39:10.206 --> 01:39:15.968
It is filled with the worst kind of InfoWars garbage conspiracy nonsense.

01:39:16.408 --> 01:39:20.190
It's a who's who of nonsensical thinking.

01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:25.152
They go, and doctors have been saying, and then they show a chiropractor going, you should drink tonic water.

01:39:25.372 --> 01:39:27.553
It's the same chiropractor that I've railed on again.

01:39:27.973 --> 01:39:30.035
They have a clip of the two Bakersfield doctors.

01:39:30.175 --> 01:39:32.497
Why are they having us say COVID on everything?

01:39:32.837 --> 01:39:36.419
Well, because you get paid more when you diagnose COVID.

01:39:36.439 --> 01:39:37.160
We already know that.

01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.623
How does that prove this whole thing is some big Fauci conspiracy theory?

01:39:42.244 --> 01:39:43.745
This is crazy.

01:39:44.325 --> 01:39:46.207
Don't waste your time watching it.

01:39:46.267 --> 01:39:47.848
Don't waste your time sharing it.

01:39:47.908 --> 01:39:49.729
Don't waste your time talking about it.

01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:55.574
I can't believe I'm wasting my time doing this, but I just want to stop getting messages about it.

01:39:56.114 --> 01:40:01.316
because it's really frustrating to think that people are this freaking stupid.

01:40:04.197 --> 01:40:12.059
So that proves it to me of an increasingly clear picture of yes, heart damage, but also body wide damage.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.140
That really should be our focus.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.305
And so this is particularly what I tried to get them to understand or tried to articulate in the Signal chat.

01:40:21.565 --> 01:40:37.436
And it is the one thing that he admitted one time on a podcast, actually opposite Robert Malone, where he said that he thought he came up with this idea on his own, but he also heard Peter McCullough and Jonathan Cooey say it.

01:40:38.322 --> 01:40:40.303
But I don't think he heard Peter McCullough say it.

01:40:40.343 --> 01:40:41.543
I think he heard me say it.

01:40:42.304 --> 01:40:46.365
And he said it that way because Peter McCullough is on the script that Robert Malone's on.

01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:54.188
And so in order to dilute me, he calls me JJ Cooey after he mentions Peter McCullough, but he says that this was my idea too.

01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:58.830
And yeah, I have that video, but I get tired of playing it because it's just shitty.

01:41:00.011 --> 01:41:07.599
Frankly, all you need to know is that they didn't stay in the deltoid where we were told they would stay.

01:41:07.699 --> 01:41:09.481
Now, it was never plausible that they were going to.

01:41:09.521 --> 01:41:10.862
They were always going to leak out.

01:41:10.922 --> 01:41:20.292
But the manufacturers claim about how this shot produces immunity.

01:41:21.514 --> 01:41:25.958
Once you know that it's going to be doing that haphazardly around the body, you know you've got a problem.

01:41:26.158 --> 01:41:49.358
It doesn't take much understanding of immunobiology to recognize that if you are going to instruct cells haphazardly around the body to produce a foreign antigen, that that is going to cause a problem where your immune system is going to attack your own cells and kill them, because when your own cells produce a foreign antigen, they are understood by your system to be virally infected, and that's what the body does to virally infected cells.

01:41:49.858 --> 01:41:51.640
And so there's the first enchantment.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.424
It's not that they're virally infected, that they're expressing proteins they're not supposed to express.

01:41:57.645 --> 01:41:59.107
It doesn't even need to be foreign.

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:09.976
If a skin cell was presenting proteins that it's not expected to present, there's a good chance that I think the immune system would destroy that cell.

01:42:11.633 --> 01:42:14.555
That's what cytotoxic T cells are doing all the time.

01:42:14.615 --> 01:42:16.276
Natural killer cells are doing all the time.

01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:21.998
These different names for these different cells that we don't really know are, you know, grouped into a name like that.

01:42:22.038 --> 01:42:34.124
But nevertheless, there are a lot of autonomous operators in our body, which are designed to look and make sure and patrol that cells are producing proteins that they're supposed to produce.

01:42:34.825 --> 01:42:35.125
And that

01:42:36.185 --> 01:42:52.754
That process involves the presentation of small epitopes on MHC molecules on the outside of cells, and then an interface between the immune system cell and that molecule to sort of check off the fact that, yeah, you're permitted to express this protein.

01:42:53.687 --> 01:43:03.873
And so this is also thought to be the primary checkpoint for the detection of cancerous cells, cells that are dividing that aren't supposed to divide.

01:43:04.393 --> 01:43:10.216
And so for him to say that this is what your body does to virally infected cells is an enchantment.

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.911
because it's not virally infected cells.

01:43:13.991 --> 01:43:17.031
It's cells that are expressing proteins they're not permitted to express.

01:43:17.071 --> 01:43:28.194
And so that, again, is him trying to twist a simplified biology to fit into the virology peg, you know, round peg in a square hole or whatever.

01:43:28.414 --> 01:43:34.656
I agree that haphazard lack of targeting and escape from the intended target is

01:43:37.619 --> 01:43:42.401
terrible, and not obviously what the manufacturers intended.

01:43:42.981 --> 01:43:50.184
But I don't think I don't think your framing of all you need to know is right here, because it still feels really arcane.

01:43:50.524 --> 01:44:02.349
I think to most people, I think, I mean, especially even just like the fact that whenever whenever you've said that, because it's true, you use the word deltoid, you know, I used to teach comparative anatomy, and I still like deltoid, right?

01:44:02.389 --> 01:44:05.070
Like, it's, it's just,

01:44:07.375 --> 01:44:08.736
Is anybody else getting angry yet?

01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:16.021
It's still it's too it's it's too arcane.

01:44:16.242 --> 01:44:18.183
Well, let me say what I'm still waiting.

01:44:18.803 --> 01:44:19.644
I know what you mean.

01:44:19.664 --> 01:44:32.774
And I'm but I'm saying that we need if we are to have a true story by which to compel people to wake up and figure out how to do what is best for them.

01:44:33.871 --> 01:44:39.896
The story needs to be inviting to access and easy to stay with and remember.

01:44:40.957 --> 01:44:47.023
And such a story might start with all you need to know, because that invites a person in with like, oh, this is this is not going to be hard.

01:44:47.043 --> 01:44:47.683
It's going to be fun.

01:44:47.703 --> 01:44:48.744
I'm going to be entertained.

01:44:49.265 --> 01:44:49.445
Right.

01:44:50.046 --> 01:45:00.335
But it can't then go to deltoid haphazard targeting that like it just needs to be so she understands that you need very succinct messaging.

01:45:03.046 --> 01:45:11.092
And she knows who I am, because at one point in time, she said a very succinct message of mine that we should call these transfections, not vaccines.

01:45:11.693 --> 01:45:14.715
And that would impart a lot of knowledge on people.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:17.638
It would encourage a lot of people to work in a different direction.

01:45:18.358 --> 01:45:32.650
And she said that in 2022, about nine months after I explained it to her and her husband, and Alexandros Marinos, and Chris Martinson, and Jumi Kim, and Matt Crawford, all in the same signal chat.

01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:35.512
And they're all traitorous liars.

01:45:38.434 --> 01:45:41.396
And so now we're in 2025 in fricking July.

01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:51.064
And these absolutely atrocious Americans are pretending that they're still trying to pull their head out.

01:45:52.005 --> 01:45:53.086
And this is all they've got.

01:45:53.106 --> 01:45:55.488
We don't really have a succinct message yet.

01:45:56.598 --> 01:46:06.446
You know, like RNA cannot pandemic or intramuscular injection in general is probably not very intelligent or that transfection is what they should have been called from the beginning.

01:46:06.486 --> 01:46:20.758
And because we didn't tell anybody they were transfection, we were kind of lying because we're kind of renaming things that already existed for 15 or 20 years before the pandemic that Robert Malone had the word in many papers on his resume.

01:46:20.818 --> 01:46:23.300
These people are scripted traders.

01:46:26.724 --> 01:46:31.705
They deserve the ire of every American in the world.

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:51.930
They deserve the ire of every free thinking person on earth because these people wittingly or unwittingly are very responsible for the number of people who were transfected, the number of people who were killed by protocols and the number of people who still can't see it.

01:46:54.656 --> 01:47:01.039
Because these people have also never said that a half a million people were killed by opioids, and we have to figure that into the equation too.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:11.305
Even though that's a pretty big, working, moving part of the complex system that they're supposed to be the only qualified experts to interpret.

01:47:14.386 --> 01:47:21.250
This absolute fraud of a woman and a fraud of a biologist says that we need more succinct messages.

01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:23.471
There needs to be something more compelling and more

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:24.891
I don't know.

01:47:24.931 --> 01:47:25.731
I don't have the story.

01:47:25.751 --> 01:47:26.892
I don't know what the answer is.

01:47:26.912 --> 01:47:37.395
Well, maybe just Shannon Joy has the story flags, natural disasters, you know, government imposed disasters, World War Three, you name it.

01:47:38.276 --> 01:47:39.916
You know, we have a lot coming at us.

01:47:39.976 --> 01:47:47.819
And this is why so many Americans are going to the satellite phone store to make sure they have everything they need when the lights go out.

01:47:48.559 --> 01:47:57.785
And they do have everything from generators to solar panels to satellite phones, amazing packages and discounts for the joy audience exclusively.

01:47:58.286 --> 01:48:05.770
They also have a full line of Faraday protection, Faraday beanies, bags, blankets, bulletproof Faraday backpacks.

01:48:06.231 --> 01:48:07.171
This is the technology.

01:48:07.191 --> 01:48:08.892
This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:48:09.953 --> 01:48:23.156
In Las Vegas in August, there's going to be a Ground Zero conference where the traitor Giuliani, the traitor Jones, Stone, the traitor Bannon, the traitor Mike Flynn, all of these people are posers.

01:48:23.996 --> 01:48:25.416
All of these people are liars.

01:48:25.556 --> 01:48:27.397
None of them are patriots.

01:48:28.257 --> 01:48:32.698
This guy is basically responsible for handling this Jerome Corsi guy.

01:48:32.718 --> 01:48:36.839
And Jerome Corsi is the guy who got basically Zeb Zelenko killed.

01:48:39.076 --> 01:48:45.437
This guy said it was a lab leak in January of 2025 and had Steven Hadfield on his show a couple days later.

01:48:46.498 --> 01:48:55.179
This woman has been lying about the autism spectrum disorder and how a component of the MMR gave it to her son for the last 15 years.

01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.161
This guy sells pillows.

01:49:08.131 --> 01:49:14.673
For too long, voices championing American first have been pushed to the margins, labeled as threats to the establishment in silence.

01:49:14.713 --> 01:49:24.956
The gateway pundit and American icons like General Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and others have shared the truth despite the radicals attempt to destroy them.

01:49:25.016 --> 01:49:29.277
Now they are coming together under one roof where we will honor their patriotism.

01:49:29.957 --> 01:49:32.598
This is a movement where real conversations happen.

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:41.044
The mainstream media won't show you where leaders put America's interests first, share their unfiltered vision for our nation's future.

01:49:42.045 --> 01:49:46.867
Don't miss your chance to be a part of the America First Ground Zero Conference.

01:49:49.929 --> 01:49:53.671
The conservative movement in America is being destroyed by these people.

01:49:54.751 --> 01:49:55.812
And we need to take it back.

01:49:56.652 --> 01:50:03.136
Conservative Americans need to wake up and apologize for having bought into this elaborate, long con.

01:50:04.551 --> 01:50:19.356
because there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and they timed this elaborate long con to cue it off exactly when this little bump in all-cause mortality around the world was about to hit the top of the pyramid.

01:50:20.216 --> 01:50:28.220
And so that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality only needed to be sculpted a little bit because there was an irreducibly complex background that they could lie about.

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:30.041
I mean, make no mistake about it.

01:50:30.141 --> 01:50:34.924
Since 2002, they could have been characterizing this background so that they had all the

01:50:35.544 --> 01:50:41.527
all the phylogeny of all these signals that they had ready to go so that they could just say, yeah, then we found this one and it's there.

01:50:41.908 --> 01:50:43.228
And we found this one and it's there.

01:50:43.689 --> 01:50:46.410
Oh no, it looks like Toyotas are spreading everywhere.

01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:47.411
We better test for them.

01:50:47.451 --> 01:50:48.051
And there they are.

01:50:48.091 --> 01:50:48.972
They're in your garage.

01:50:49.052 --> 01:50:49.512
Guess what?

01:50:49.912 --> 01:50:50.533
Holy shit.

01:50:50.913 --> 01:50:51.693
Now it's Kias.

01:50:51.833 --> 01:50:52.394
Oh my gosh.

01:50:52.434 --> 01:50:54.535
My neighbor across the street has one of those.

01:50:59.505 --> 01:51:26.451
And this sculpting using murder and lies is hidden by people like Denny Rancor, who have put out paper after paper since the beginning of the pandemic about all-cause mortality, hidden by people that are so stupid they don't understand it, like Brett Weinstein and his wife, and hidden by people who, after six years of trying to find justice, have apparently never thought of trying to list all the ways that Americans were murdered.

01:51:27.188 --> 01:51:32.873
so that we could rule those out first and then see if there's anything left for a mystery virus to do.

01:51:34.074 --> 01:51:35.876
Nobody has had this strategy.

01:51:36.096 --> 01:51:46.245
No one, not one of these people with their amazing sub stacks have never bothered to keep a running total of, I don't know, all the ways that people died.

01:51:49.522 --> 01:52:04.908
It's really amazing that somebody as sophisticated and complex systems as Brett Weinstein is not able to see that we have no experimental and no empirical evidence for the phenomenon of endemicity, as either a process or an endpoint.

01:52:04.948 --> 01:52:08.169
We just have a background and people tell stories about it.

01:52:08.849 --> 01:52:15.232
But Brett Weinstein is not complicated enough to understand that, not sophisticated enough to understand that because he's playing a role.

01:52:15.753 --> 01:52:19.455
He's playing a shtick and he's sticking to the script.

01:52:20.235 --> 01:52:26.138
And so he can't even think about what he was scripted to say in 2020 and 2021 or the danger he's in as a fraud would become palpable.

01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:35.953
and never be able to be dispelled back into his subconscious again.

01:52:36.433 --> 01:52:40.356
Ladies and gentlemen, using their tests to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real.

01:52:41.076 --> 01:52:53.645
Endemicity is a myth, and that's why we have a fake anti-vax, a fake health freedom movement led by shitheads like Brett Weinstein, and shitheads like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and traitors to our grandchildren like Mary Holland.

01:52:54.616 --> 01:52:55.896
Thank you very much for being here.

01:52:56.337 --> 01:52:57.157
Thanks for being here.

01:52:57.217 --> 01:52:59.318
Tomorrow's Friday, and I'm really looking forward to it.

01:53:01.358 --> 01:53:03.979
If you wanted to know who this is, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

01:53:04.019 --> 01:53:05.900
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.921
You can find my academic work on PubMed.

01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:11.362
That's the National Library of Medicine's PubMed website.

01:53:11.782 --> 01:53:22.846
You can use my last name, Cooey, C-O-U-E-Y, with the first initials J and J. You can also find a lot of my work in the Wuhan Cover-Up book written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

01:53:23.826 --> 01:53:28.009
I also used to work for Children's Health Defense before I figured out they were traitors and then they fired me.

01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:30.431
And I used to be friends with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:53:30.511 --> 01:53:32.452
I shared a lot of barbecue time with him.

01:53:33.313 --> 01:53:39.457
But since he's become part of Robert Malone's team, I am a person non grata.

01:53:39.517 --> 01:53:40.618
I do have a website.

01:53:41.118 --> 01:53:43.059
I do also have a couple YouTube channels.

01:53:43.119 --> 01:53:48.903
I'm using JC on the bike today because they gave a strike to JC in the woods for my stream yesterday.

01:53:49.303 --> 01:53:50.364
It's really remarkable.

01:53:50.384 --> 01:53:52.886
I think they're actually seeing it now.

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:54.946
Thank you very much for being here.

01:53:55.026 --> 01:53:58.387
If you want to share my work, please do, because that's how this works.

01:53:58.447 --> 01:54:02.208
If you share the work, people find the biology and kapow.

01:54:03.028 --> 01:54:04.329
This all works out really great.

01:54:05.609 --> 01:54:13.971
And if you want to support this work, please, I humbly submit that you go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do so, including find a way to share the work.

01:54:14.892 --> 01:54:16.414
Thanks very much for being here, everybody.

01:54:16.454 --> 01:54:17.476
Thanks for your patience.

01:54:17.997 --> 01:54:18.938
Happy 4th of July.

01:54:18.978 --> 01:54:19.900
Gonna see you tomorrow.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.863
Don't worry, I will be on tomorrow.

01:54:22.544 --> 01:54:25.629
No fireworks, but I will be on tomorrow.

01:54:25.689 --> 01:54:26.751
Thank you very much for being here.

01:54:27.252 --> 01:54:28.113
Love you all very much.

01:54:28.734 --> 01:54:28.995
Be good.

01:54:39.201 --> 01:54:40.823
It's not the weekend yet, Ancient.

01:54:40.883 --> 01:54:42.225
I'm gonna be on again tomorrow.

01:54:42.265 --> 01:54:44.308
Don't be telling everybody I'm not on tomorrow.

01:54:44.328 --> 01:54:45.169
I'm on tomorrow.

01:54:46.011 --> 01:54:47.573
It's not a holiday for me, baby.
