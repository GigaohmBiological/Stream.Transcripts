WEBVTT

00:08.498 --> 00:08.758
and and

01:03.335 --> 01:04.776
This world is a lie.

01:05.626 --> 01:07.409
The fiction of the what if of us.

01:08.030 --> 01:09.012
Tell me about it, sister.

01:21.778 --> 01:23.480
Hey, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.061
Happy Halloween.

01:25.622 --> 01:27.523
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.745
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:29.845 --> 01:36.191
That person over there is Annie Wershing, a friend of mine from Chicago.

01:36.311 --> 01:37.612
Originally, she's from St.

01:37.632 --> 01:37.872
Louis.

01:39.975 --> 01:46.178
She was an actor in Hollywood and took the transfection in order to do this role.

01:47.018 --> 01:51.940
She got acute brain cancer and died about six months after diagnosis.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.043
Left a very sad husband and three kids behind.

02:01.024 --> 02:06.846
Not to say that this isn't a great Star Trek episode or a great Star Trek role.

02:08.723 --> 02:11.284
But it's just another one of those things.

02:13.924 --> 02:20.446
The untold number of people that we have lost because of lies.

02:20.946 --> 02:23.287
Because people lie about why people die.

02:24.787 --> 02:33.409
Annie didn't have to die of opioids for us to be angry about the hundreds of thousands of Americans that died of opioids and also

02:35.188 --> 02:40.473
the perhaps thousands of Americans that have been killed by transfection.

02:43.116 --> 02:54.167
And it doesn't just have to be by brain cancer or myocarditis or kidney disease that nobody ever mentions where the tiniest capillaries are.

02:54.207 --> 02:58.491
This is all just a very bad place we are, ladies and gentlemen.

03:00.239 --> 03:04.381
I want to dedicate this show, whatever it is, because it's not going to be anything that special.

03:04.441 --> 03:05.201
I have ears on.

03:06.202 --> 03:20.568
I just, I can't believe there have to be everyone in America, everyone on earth has to know someone because I know too many people.

03:29.847 --> 03:30.247
Visitors.

03:35.189 --> 03:46.633
Let's take these off of you.

03:47.093 --> 03:47.633
Hi, mister.

03:48.113 --> 03:49.233
Hello, Agnes.

03:49.313 --> 03:49.714
Thank you.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.816
Don't see that every day.

04:09.246 --> 04:14.228
You are Locutus, and you are not.

04:15.069 --> 04:17.870
I know you can see the divergence in time.

04:18.370 --> 04:26.094
What did Q do in the past when he turned our world into a polluted, totalitarian nightmare?

04:27.315 --> 04:29.416
Friend, then foe, and now.

04:29.636 --> 04:30.616
Answer the question.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.737
What did Q do?

04:33.117 --> 04:34.158
A temporal rescission.

04:35.118 --> 04:35.999
A single change.

04:36.019 --> 04:36.939
What was it?

04:37.099 --> 04:37.619
When was it?

04:38.180 --> 04:38.720
Calculating.

04:40.796 --> 04:55.941
Perhaps it was one single change where the entire planet was led to believe that free-range RNA molecules are potentially a danger that can be created in your garage if you have the right eBay purchased equipment.

04:59.582 --> 05:02.203
Ladies and gentlemen, that's what we're talking about right here.

05:03.848 --> 05:11.594
We're talking about a single change in the way humanity thinks about its own biology and the biology of the world in which we live.

05:12.275 --> 05:13.816
And now we are where we are.

05:15.757 --> 05:25.325
And where our future leads us and how we careen into that future and in what direction we go is all based on this one small change.

05:26.746 --> 05:28.447
Before 2019, nobody used PCR to find anything.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.341
and took it seriously.

05:36.061 --> 05:45.506
And if you did, you had to do everything in triplicate and then justify the reasons why you interpreted the PCR as a positive or a negative with other experiments.

05:46.326 --> 05:52.249
Never before had a single pair of primers been used as a diagnostic tool.

05:53.649 --> 05:57.131
And now, after the pandemic, this single change

05:57.955 --> 06:09.537
in the way we do things, the single change in the way we think about things has pervaded our very way that our children think about how they can be diagnosed with a disease.

06:09.737 --> 06:19.539
Because they think, our children think, kids that go to college think, that a PCR test can diagnose up to 20 different viruses now.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.120
And that molecular biology is a

06:24.790 --> 06:36.698
highly specific, extremely high fidelity science that has its output in small plastic trays with multicolored strips.

06:40.261 --> 06:46.385
A single change, the date she gets it wrong because that single change was around January of 2020.

06:46.785 --> 06:53.530
The Borg Queen makes a miscalculation because she's not connected to the hive, I guess.

06:55.799 --> 06:57.100
2024.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.100
That is the when.

06:57.120 --> 06:57.841
Where is the where?

06:57.961 --> 06:58.542
Calculating.

06:58.862 --> 06:59.342
Earth.

07:00.203 --> 07:02.065
The change in the timeline originates there.

07:02.085 --> 07:03.887
In Los Angeles.

07:04.567 --> 07:05.128
Calculating.

07:06.209 --> 07:07.430
There is someone there to help.

07:08.792 --> 07:09.272
A Watcher.

07:10.713 --> 07:11.674
Seek the Watcher.

07:13.576 --> 07:14.337
Mrs. Winterworth.

07:15.407 --> 07:17.831
Los Angeles, that's got to be our destination.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.834
We cannot live in this reality.

07:20.214 --> 07:24.560
If we want to save the future, then we have to repair the past.

07:24.921 --> 07:29.948
I'm afraid my cursory review of Confederation briefs made no mention of any time travel capabilities.

07:30.609 --> 07:35.953
The tech here seems similar to our own, albeit with a slightly more, boy, that torture device really looks like it's gonna hurt, kind of look.

07:36.073 --> 07:37.514
So, what do we do?

07:38.114 --> 07:40.876
Well, there are cruder methods of time travel.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.578
Stars gravitational pull.

07:44.379 --> 07:47.661
A slingshot maneuver at warp to generate a temporal fissure.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.043
Kirk's Enterprise did it on more than one occasion.

07:51.364 --> 07:56.447
But for that, you need an intelligence that can isolate the divergence and micro-shift for any chronotonic radiation.

07:56.687 --> 07:57.348
They had Spock.

07:58.168 --> 07:58.829
And we have her.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.233
She has the capabilities.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.534
But why would she help us?

08:04.634 --> 08:07.014
All this talk of eradication.

08:07.034 --> 08:13.175
How did it feel when your people were eradicated?

08:13.215 --> 08:14.816
You don't have to answer.

08:14.836 --> 08:15.796
Because I know.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.699
Pitiful end to the great Borg Empire.

08:31.019 --> 08:34.560
It's funny in that whole, that get up, I can still see it's Annie.

08:34.620 --> 08:35.320
It's really funny.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.081
We want a way back to our present.

08:39.142 --> 08:41.222
The collective waiting for you in the Delta Quadrant.

08:51.586 --> 08:52.546
Will you help us?

08:54.147 --> 08:55.147
Yes, I will help you.

08:57.324 --> 08:57.564
Yes.

09:00.446 --> 09:01.547
Great, now what?

09:03.468 --> 09:04.388
Great, now what?

09:05.029 --> 09:05.949
It's a funny show.

09:05.969 --> 09:07.550
This isn't so funny.

09:07.731 --> 09:08.911
This isn't so funny at all.

09:13.823 --> 09:21.147
The company's data mining software is used by various government agencies in the United States, including the CIA, FBI, and NYPD.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.029
It's also used by hedge funds and other financial firms.

09:24.529 --> 09:29.072
Karp is a Stanford graduate and co-founder of the company with ex-PayPal engineers.

09:29.632 --> 09:32.394
I am pleased to have him here at this table for the first time.

09:32.814 --> 09:35.295
He does not do many television interviews.

09:35.796 --> 09:37.637
And for that, I'm also pleased to have him here.

09:37.677 --> 09:37.977
Welcome.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.184
Thank you for having me.

09:39.504 --> 09:41.585
Let me talk a bit about the background, which is interesting.

09:41.805 --> 09:42.886
Stanford Law, wasn't it?

09:43.286 --> 09:45.346
It was Stanford Law.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.507
And then you went to Frankfurt?

09:47.947 --> 09:49.268
Then I went to Frankfurt and got a Ph.D.

09:49.348 --> 09:50.468
in neoclassical?

09:51.369 --> 09:55.150
Social philosophy, which is a fancy way of saying a quick path to being unemployed.

09:55.770 --> 09:59.211
Certainly to be the highest educated, least earning person on the planet.

09:59.691 --> 10:00.672
And why did you do that?

10:01.732 --> 10:04.395
Well, the same reason I got involved in founding Palantir.

10:04.475 --> 10:05.776
I was really passionate about the issues.

10:06.156 --> 10:09.138
He's really passionate about the issues.

10:09.218 --> 10:19.026
Now, what I'm trying to point out here, and I hope that you will do the due diligence to listen and to investigate on your own, I think he's a fraud.

10:20.467 --> 10:32.540
I think he is what I'm going to start calling a in-real-life actor, meaning that he plays himself, but he plays himself with the secret backing of the national security state.

10:33.661 --> 10:40.228
And so, given access to, let's say, national security military algorithms,

10:41.351 --> 10:46.393
and then pretending as though he invented them or he's part of the team that invented them.

10:46.953 --> 10:51.254
And then he hires people to use those algorithms and use those tools.

10:51.695 --> 10:53.915
It's the same thing that they did for Jeff Bezos.

10:54.315 --> 10:57.877
And I'm quite sure it's the same thing they're doing for Elon Musk.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.117
These people are not real.

10:59.557 --> 11:01.578
That's why they don't say anything profound.

11:01.678 --> 11:06.460
So far, he said he's interested in the issues, just like everybody else.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.141
Listen carefully to what he doesn't say.

11:13.815 --> 11:17.556
I largely wasn't putting money ahead of what I thought was important.

11:19.217 --> 11:22.158
Some of the ideas I dealt with were actually quite important.

11:22.278 --> 11:24.239
What does it mean to know something?

11:24.519 --> 11:25.939
What does it mean to communicate it?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.041
What is the foundation of Western society?

11:31.001 --> 11:33.062
Can we participate as citizens and how?

11:33.702 --> 11:34.982
I was very passionate about those ideas.

11:35.282 --> 11:38.123
He was very passionate about those ideas.

11:38.183 --> 11:41.104
Those are the basic ideas by which we are ruled.

11:43.041 --> 11:46.703
Essentially, how does the voting population know things?

11:47.383 --> 11:51.125
How do we communicate things to the voting population?

11:51.886 --> 11:57.809
How does the voting population feel like they are participating in Western society?

11:57.869 --> 12:02.731
How can we make the voting population feel like they're participating in society?

12:05.533 --> 12:12.056
Because knowing the foundation of Western society could also mean how can we disrupt it?

12:13.988 --> 12:15.249
How can we damage it?

12:15.349 --> 12:16.930
How can we bring it to the ground?

12:20.092 --> 12:23.554
These are not questions that he's rattling off of the top of his head.

12:23.614 --> 12:25.815
This is a finely tuned script.

12:27.616 --> 12:32.319
Probably written by people above him, smarter than him, scripting him.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.842
And if not, I'm sorry.

12:36.782 --> 12:38.944
This is not a profoundly smart man.

12:39.004 --> 12:40.845
This is an egomaniac.

12:41.735 --> 12:48.580
who knows that he's going to win, not because he's really good, but because he is backed.

12:50.721 --> 12:52.282
It's gross once you see it.

12:52.762 --> 12:53.903
It's such a fraud.

12:54.704 --> 12:59.607
He's probably one of the biggest cowards on earth, but he talks so tough all the time now.

13:00.107 --> 13:01.128
It's quite remarkable.

13:01.168 --> 13:03.429
It is like a lot of them are.

13:05.891 --> 13:08.873
Yeah, it's just like I'm passionate about my business, Palantir.

13:09.444 --> 13:12.707
and also about anti-semitism and other issues that you thought.

13:13.388 --> 13:18.853
The convergence of neo-Kantian and Freudian philosophy.

13:18.873 --> 13:22.896
Neo-Kantian is kind of, as best as I can tell, kind of bullshit.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.580
Because Kantian is just fine.

13:39.261 --> 13:44.282
Kant was like one of the, perhaps, premier philosophers.

13:45.502 --> 13:48.683
And his ideas have endured quite long.

13:49.464 --> 13:55.985
And some of his ideas about morality make this guy look like just an absolute shithead.

13:57.106 --> 13:57.906
It's remarkable.

14:00.458 --> 14:07.842
Kant had this idea that any law that was worth thinking about and talking about should be universal.

14:08.923 --> 14:15.887
One of those laws is that lying is immoral because in all cases, it's immoral.

14:17.067 --> 14:19.709
And this guy is clearly a liar.

14:21.209 --> 14:24.210
He would lie to get any advantage.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.931
And he explains that regularly in many of his interviews.

14:26.971 --> 14:32.554
He's completely okay with asymmetric competition and asymmetric warfare.

14:32.954 --> 14:35.835
He's not a gentleman and he doesn't care to be a gentleman.

14:36.456 --> 14:44.439
And that means that basically, if he is in charge of national security, then he would also think of his fellow citizens in that way.

14:47.657 --> 14:50.860
The fact that he's lined up with Peter Thiel, the gay space vampire.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.121
What does that say about him?

14:53.962 --> 15:00.307
That he's aligned with PayPal engineers, which really means PayPal algorithms, which means he didn't invent anything.

15:01.748 --> 15:07.093
And he's about to say in this interview that they basically take the PayPal algorithms and use it for other things.

15:07.113 --> 15:09.435
They are not inventing anything.

15:11.055 --> 15:12.716
He's not doing anything.

15:13.116 --> 15:23.121
He's a guy who writes about Neo-Kantian and Freudian philosophy and wanted to be an academic and then decided to go into business and see how it would go.

15:23.501 --> 15:27.883
And then when he explains to you why he went into business, he says he had a knack for making money.

15:27.903 --> 15:29.023
He just couldn't get paid.

15:29.504 --> 15:34.066
And so he got a bunch of people together that could make money and get paid and made a business out of it.

15:34.086 --> 15:34.926
It was my business.

15:34.986 --> 15:36.067
I started it myself.

15:36.547 --> 15:38.728
He's actually lying.

15:40.492 --> 15:42.352
Like it's, it's bullshit.

15:42.952 --> 15:50.934
It's like a sophomore in high school telling you, you know, that I'm going to go out and I'm going to get a job and I'm going to save up my money.

15:50.974 --> 15:52.314
And I did all this other stuff.

15:52.374 --> 15:54.054
And I mean, it's just so dumb.

15:54.214 --> 15:57.215
It's so dumb because he is a fraud.

15:59.655 --> 16:08.457
And I'm a little upset right now because it is Halloween and there are a bunch of people out walking around on the street, making believe like nothing's happening.

16:10.356 --> 16:18.602
When in reality, we're not being led by a technocracy of people like, I don't know, Joshua Lederberg and his peers anymore.

16:19.022 --> 16:27.428
We're being led by, what is this dude at best?

16:28.209 --> 16:33.693
An intellectual pervert and an adolescent, what?

16:34.253 --> 16:35.394
What is this guy?

16:35.895 --> 16:37.456
He's no one to look up to.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.128
Elon Musk is no one to look up to.

16:42.848 --> 16:50.129
Donald Trump is no one to look up to in the public sphere, in the role that he has played in the public sphere.

16:50.149 --> 16:51.489
He might be a great grandpa.

16:55.290 --> 16:59.751
But come on, ladies and gentlemen, these people are actors and they're actors in real life.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.111
That's what makes them interesting.

17:01.151 --> 17:04.912
It's like they're in a reality show and they know it.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.673
That's why he acts the way that he does.

17:08.649 --> 17:10.309
That's the way Elon acts.

17:10.429 --> 17:14.090
That's the way, you know, even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.410
doesn't act that way.

17:15.470 --> 17:16.110
Do you know why?

17:16.170 --> 17:17.851
Because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.331
doesn't know he's being played.

17:19.871 --> 17:22.992
These guys know they are actors that are going to win.

17:23.412 --> 17:25.532
They know that money doesn't matter for them.

17:25.972 --> 17:28.373
They know that they're gonna be the boss no matter what.

17:28.773 --> 17:36.554
They know because they're heads of military sponsored, you know, like DOD type things.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.371
You can see it.

17:42.352 --> 17:46.115
It's the confidence that he tells this story.

17:46.175 --> 18:01.669
He's exactly like the Palmer Lucky guy, who's also just another one of these clowns who, oh, I invented some goggles in my garage and now I'm, you know, come on.

18:06.022 --> 18:13.066
and on anything that anyone would read, which is what you do when you're an aspiring academic with essentially an interest in writing.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.789
And then I migrated into a business context.

18:18.809 --> 18:20.070
And what caused you to do that?

18:21.055 --> 18:27.261
Well, you know, the interesting thing about academia is that it's more interesting to the people in it than it is to anyone else.

18:30.765 --> 18:35.169
You end up fighting about small things that may be fairly unimportant to other people.

18:35.529 --> 18:40.875
And I thought that while the ideas were important, the actual impact they were going to have was going to be very small.

18:40.975 --> 18:44.558
I mean, the kind of work I did was intelligible to probably 30, 40 people.

18:45.419 --> 18:46.539
Wow, listen to that.

18:46.699 --> 18:50.080
Intelligible to about 30 or 40 people in the world.

18:50.580 --> 18:57.602
What he should have said, if he was going to be honest, is that he was writing about things that only 30 or 40 people in the world would give a shit about.

19:00.683 --> 19:01.903
That's what the truth is.

19:02.603 --> 19:03.803
This guy's a fraud.

19:04.904 --> 19:07.444
He's as fraudulent as Peter Daszak.

19:08.364 --> 19:14.646
He's as fraudulent as Naomi Wolf or Nathan Wolf.

19:15.669 --> 19:19.651
Or, or, or, or, or James Lyons Weiler.

19:20.651 --> 19:30.416
He's as fraudulent, I mean, Robert Malone is more of a real man than Alex Karp, with more of a real professional history and CV.

19:30.716 --> 19:37.299
Hell, Stephen Hadfield has more of a real professional history and CV than this fake man.

19:38.279 --> 19:43.181
Alex Karp is as fake as Alex Jones.

19:44.082 --> 19:44.842
Come on!

19:45.757 --> 19:59.524
If we could shed this skin of bullshit in America and just make these people the clowns that they are, we might fix most of the problem right now.

20:01.145 --> 20:01.485
The world.

20:02.086 --> 20:08.669
So, um, it, it, it seemed more interesting and compelling to do something else, uh, get involved in business and see how that worked out.

20:08.729 --> 20:12.951
And some of the issues in business are actually from an academic perspective, also quite compelling.

20:13.051 --> 20:14.152
So where did you migrate to?

20:14.881 --> 20:19.602
Well, it turned out I had a facility for – I was pretty good at making money.

20:20.202 --> 20:22.103
And I was very bad at getting paid.

20:22.763 --> 20:34.786
So I basically turned the ability to make money and get paid into a business where I look for other people who are good at making money and bad at getting paid, and I taught them how to make money quicker and to get paid fairly.

20:35.426 --> 20:37.208
This was a venture capital kind of operation?

20:38.129 --> 20:46.599
Basically my own business, which I built, and I went around looking for motley people who had... Think about how stupid that is.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.581
Somebody slap him.

20:50.263 --> 20:55.008
Somebody get in a time machine and slap the glasses off this dipshit.

20:56.044 --> 21:04.280
and then slap the guy on 60 Minutes who, you know, of course will even put George Webb in front of us in February of 2020.

21:12.148 --> 21:16.930
academic proclivities and were interested in business, and I would approach them and say, oh, why don't you build a business?

21:16.970 --> 21:17.411
I'll help you.

21:18.291 --> 21:22.113
And I did that for a couple years, and then I reconnected with Peter.

21:22.893 --> 21:23.354
Peter Thiel.

21:23.414 --> 21:23.914
Peter Thiel.

21:26.275 --> 21:29.737
I wonder when he says reconnected, does he mean he was pitching or catching?

21:29.757 --> 21:33.599
I began, along with a couple other guys, to build this company.

21:34.039 --> 21:36.040
And while there, you had the idea for Palantir?

21:37.079 --> 21:47.087
Yeah, well, you know, post 9-11, I think the idea, again, it was Silicon Valley ought to be involved in fighting terrorism and protecting our civil liberties.

21:48.288 --> 21:52.252
And, you know, terrorism is asymmetric.

21:52.772 --> 21:56.475
Asymmetry presupposes software because you're finding needles and haystacks.

21:57.056 --> 22:01.820
Actually using an approach that's not exactly like data mining was a critique on some of the data mining.

22:02.060 --> 22:10.246
Remember, he went to law school and then he went to Germany and studied Neo something philosophy, right?

22:12.548 --> 22:21.675
But now suddenly he's working with PayPal engineers and generating algorithms that are worthy of the highest level of government contracts.

22:23.656 --> 22:24.697
And you think he's real?

22:27.519 --> 22:29.281
You think he's real because he was on 60 Minutes?

22:34.588 --> 22:36.149
He's as fake as Bozo the Clown.

22:36.890 --> 22:44.417
Oh, so the approach is at PayPal.

22:44.837 --> 22:48.080
So again, we're talking about things that he didn't do.

22:48.801 --> 22:54.967
Things that Elon Musk didn't do with Peter Thiel either while they were playing chess together.

22:56.013 --> 22:58.018
No, I'm sorry, but they didn't.

22:58.839 --> 23:02.647
And you know that they didn't because they can't talk about any of it.

23:02.708 --> 23:05.073
They've never talked about any of it.

23:12.304 --> 23:16.730
It's just too bad that more people in America can't see that Peter Thiel is a fraud.

23:17.151 --> 23:18.653
That Alex Karp is a fraud.

23:19.233 --> 23:26.022
That Mark Zuckerberg is not anything remarkable.

23:27.404 --> 23:29.928
He's a below average gas station attendant.

23:37.094 --> 23:37.974
It would do two things.

23:38.015 --> 23:44.197
It would allow humans to find needles and haystacks, so make the data intelligible to you and me, which it's not.

23:44.717 --> 23:56.643
And by doing that, it would allow them to find bad people trying to destroy our society, and could be used also to protect civil liberties by making the data such transparent, so that- It could be used to protect civil liberties.

23:56.663 --> 23:57.143
It could.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.084
It could be, but it won't.

23:59.804 --> 24:02.204
And again, he's scripted to say it that way.

24:02.244 --> 24:12.546
He's scripted to say it exactly that way because he is a real life actor playing himself, working for the slavers with their backing.

24:12.926 --> 24:14.687
That's why money doesn't matter for him.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.127
Because if you work for the slavers, money doesn't matter.

24:18.187 --> 24:19.727
If you're a slave, you work for money.

24:20.048 --> 24:21.248
You try to get followers.

24:21.288 --> 24:22.168
You need clicks.

24:22.608 --> 24:23.668
You need subscribers.

24:23.688 --> 24:24.368
You're a slave.

24:25.508 --> 24:26.229
I'm a slave.

24:26.749 --> 24:28.389
I have to pay bills in dollars.

24:30.785 --> 24:43.348
I don't have $40 billion in a bank that allows me to borrow $8 million every year, spend it as I will, and then pay back that $8 million and claim that I had no income.

24:44.729 --> 24:45.509
I can't do that.

24:49.790 --> 24:54.271
It was very clear what the government is doing and how they're doing it, which is a particular passion of our company.

24:54.554 --> 24:58.938
This may be obvious, but why did you name it Palantir after the seeing stones in the Lord of the Rings?

24:59.038 --> 25:01.420
Yes, because he's a dipshit.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.242
That's why, because he's a scripted dipshit.

25:03.262 --> 25:04.503
You need a higher purpose.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.985
And I also think you often need a lower purpose.

25:07.686 --> 25:09.287
Like the higher purpose for me.

25:09.768 --> 25:10.629
What's a lower purpose?

25:11.129 --> 25:18.756
Well, I love the idea of getting a drone and having light fentanyl laced urine spraying on analysts who've tried to screw us.

25:19.560 --> 25:39.391
so fentanyl laced urine spraying from drones on analysts who've tried to screw us it sounds very very much like a guy who wouldn't mind a national security script that say for example tried to create the illusion of a pandemic by i don't know contaminating a few lots of

25:40.271 --> 25:59.614
of a widely distributed pharmaceutical for example with some fentanyl or some carfentanil or maybe just releasing a little more fentanyl and carfentanil onto the street for a five-year period so that you could get numbers to go higher and life expectancy to go down and blame it on a virus.

26:00.135 --> 26:08.276
And it's funny that he would make such a comment in a country that he says he wants to be so great but

26:08.696 --> 26:16.541
is a place where so many Americans and so many young people are being killed by the very drug that he makes a joke about.

26:16.601 --> 26:19.563
This guy is the ultimate piece of shit.

26:24.526 --> 26:25.787
So that's my lower purpose.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.950
And, uh... Yeah.

26:30.530 --> 26:33.792
But... And other... And the people laughing in the audience?

26:33.852 --> 26:35.013
Who are these people?

26:35.673 --> 26:36.694
How is that funny?

26:38.308 --> 26:46.155
Why isn't there one person in the audience that stands up and said, Hey, 700,000 Americans have died in the last five years.

26:46.255 --> 26:46.815
Dickhead.

26:46.835 --> 27:03.469
Uh, but the higher PR purpose for me was to get this nation to be the preeminent power in the world because whatever faults we have, they're nothing like anyone else's.

27:05.170 --> 27:08.553
I'm going to push back on this narrative.

27:08.814 --> 27:12.477
First of all, AI makes America the dominant country in the world.

27:12.597 --> 27:13.218
So just start there.

27:13.358 --> 27:17.141
Every other country in the world, like I spent half my life in Europe, they're whining and crying.

27:17.181 --> 27:23.327
It's like we have the right chips, we have the right software, we have the right engineers, we have the right culture, we have the right people.

27:23.547 --> 27:24.247
risk appetite.

27:24.347 --> 27:25.468
Risk appetite, right.

27:25.508 --> 27:26.388
People ask questions.

27:27.569 --> 27:29.990
The whole thing is combining to become a juggernaut.

27:30.090 --> 27:34.913
And then and like these partnerships happen and that just throws gasoline on the fire.

27:34.953 --> 27:42.256
So the classic, the real question is, will the GDP growth accrue to all Americans or just wealthy Americans?

27:42.777 --> 27:45.858
And the answer to that is it depends what you do.

27:46.018 --> 27:47.759
But I deeply believe, I think we do.

27:47.779 --> 27:48.440
Well, no, manufacturing

27:49.360 --> 27:52.462
Isnt it funny how much dumber he sounds now than when he was on 60 minutes acting all cool about what he was gonna do

28:10.414 --> 28:39.820
Knowing that the future was dependent on his company and his algorithms and now he's like all jazzed up and Just did a line in the in the back and he's got to have this guy from NVIDIA next to him It's falling apart ladies and gentlemen America is in the midst of a controlled Demolition and this guy might not know it or knows it or knows it and doesn't know it or it doesn't matter He's a scripted shithead

28:40.967 --> 28:42.668
And these are all tales from the script.

28:42.688 --> 28:50.433
This is Halloween every day on social media and on mainstream media now in the Western world.

28:50.593 --> 28:52.354
It is Halloween every day.

28:52.954 --> 28:56.056
And these people are actors playing themselves in real life.

28:56.116 --> 28:56.576
That's it.

28:56.656 --> 28:58.057
That's why it's such a joke.

28:58.577 --> 28:59.478
They're all scripted.

29:01.408 --> 29:08.092
The red tape, you've discussed it, but nuclear reactors... The number one thing of this administration is pro-power growth.

29:08.773 --> 29:13.896
Look at all the power generations that he's approved, look at all the DOE land and energy they've approved.

29:16.365 --> 29:17.666
I wish you all the best.

29:17.766 --> 29:40.916
Honestly, I think any New Yorker who looks at someone getting an opportunity, who's representing communities that have not been as representative, a Muslim, a young person, a progressive, a democratic socialist, there are so many different communities that are looking to you, and this, I hate to put it on you, as a bit of a Jackie Robinson moment, and I know that that,

29:41.926 --> 29:43.867
that probably wields some weight.

29:44.707 --> 29:47.948
But man, oh man, what an exciting opportunity.

29:48.448 --> 29:49.188
And I wish you the best.

29:50.129 --> 29:54.010
You know the funny thing about calling it a Jackie Robinson moment?

29:57.611 --> 30:03.053
Jackie Robinson occurred at a certain period in US history.

30:04.511 --> 30:14.956
A certain period in US history when certain barriers and certain lines were drawn and never crossed and very well enforced.

30:17.777 --> 30:20.698
All of those lines have long been vanished.

30:24.440 --> 30:33.104
And the idea that he could be a Jackie Robinson moment, does that make Jon Stewart dumb?

30:34.428 --> 30:36.889
Does it make him dumb for not correcting John?

30:38.169 --> 30:40.871
Or does that make these two just scripted actors?

30:43.311 --> 30:47.193
You can't have a Jackie Robinson moment anymore in America.

30:48.173 --> 30:52.395
Unless you imagine that we haven't made any progress since Jackie Robinson.

30:52.795 --> 30:57.817
Unless you imagine that Jackie Robinson, the moment, didn't matter at all.

31:01.178 --> 31:02.519
It's so stupid it hurts.

31:12.686 --> 31:16.609
But you can tell if someone's lying, you can sort of feel it in people.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.110
And I have lied.

31:19.130 --> 31:20.171
I'm sure I'll lie again.

31:20.191 --> 31:21.131
I don't want to lie.

31:22.152 --> 31:22.953
I don't think I'm a liar.

31:23.073 --> 31:24.093
I try not to be a liar.

31:24.133 --> 31:24.974
I don't want to be a liar.

31:25.534 --> 31:28.256
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

31:32.708 --> 31:39.189
Do you think we would ever do something as outrageous as giving children a product that had never been safety tested?

31:39.369 --> 31:40.809
How could you dare you?

31:40.829 --> 31:47.911
Do you think we would ever do something as outrageous as giving children a product that had never been safety tested?

31:48.091 --> 31:49.611
How could you dare you?

31:51.731 --> 31:59.673
And other people at Twitter, et cetera, which Elon made public, and thank God for him.

32:11.152 --> 32:25.727
Let me introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest... I got to tell you, Rocktober has been a lot of fun, but it's also been very difficult, a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

32:26.028 --> 32:33.155
And finding, choosing the right song or right songs for tonight was impossible.

32:34.784 --> 32:41.706
And so the two songs that I'm going to use tonight are really just me not really knowing what to do anymore.

32:42.626 --> 32:56.651
And so shout out to Annie, shout out to Nate, shout out to Case, shout out to Fem, the four people that I know of in my family and circle that I lost to transfection in one way or another over the last six years.

32:59.250 --> 33:04.493
Everybody misses you an awful lot and we definitely, definitely remember you.

33:07.214 --> 33:14.058
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain

33:22.170 --> 33:42.117
When we whisper and I think of you And all the tears you cry, they call my name And when you're the enemy I keep through I paint a picture of the days gone by

33:43.413 --> 33:52.391
When love went blind and you would make me see I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

34:19.126 --> 34:41.753
To every endless day I wanna see you say I remember you We spent the summer with the top rolled down

34:43.442 --> 35:01.228
Wished ever after would be like this You said I'd love you babe without a doubt I said I'd give up my life for just one kiss Live for your smile and die for you

35:18.959 --> 35:38.382
Through every endless day I wanna be saved I remember you We said our share of hardships But that's the price we paid And through

36:18.460 --> 36:19.481
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

36:19.681 --> 36:20.182
I'm an MD.

36:20.222 --> 36:20.942
I'm a physician.

36:21.723 --> 36:26.347
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

36:26.427 --> 36:27.548
I do molecular biology.

36:27.588 --> 36:28.849
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

36:57.588 --> 37:07.359
I remember you through the sleepless nights, through every endless day.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.042
I want to be saved.

37:10.983 --> 37:13.185
I remember you.

37:13.266 --> 37:15.508
Remember yesterday.

37:15.748 --> 37:16.649
Look at you.

38:13.438 --> 38:18.324
Oh, I'm very sorry that Ryan Cole's voice came in there.

38:18.344 --> 38:23.350
I thought it was going to be timed differently and I definitely didn't think it was going to come in in the middle of the

38:24.207 --> 38:24.867
of the vocals.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.108
I apologize for that.

38:26.808 --> 38:33.111
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

38:33.151 --> 38:34.151
It's how we know things.

38:35.252 --> 38:38.833
And how we know things is a way to manipulate society.

38:39.654 --> 38:44.176
It constitutes an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.

38:44.216 --> 38:46.777
That's something that somebody said back in 1924.

38:48.598 --> 38:53.480
Suffice it to say that social media has created an intellectual landscape that is

38:54.972 --> 38:58.153
more treacherous to our children than anyone could have ever imagined.

38:59.033 --> 39:03.454
And this is Gigoland Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.595
That biologist is Jonathan J. Cooey.

39:08.215 --> 39:14.797
I am findable on the National Library of Medicine's website PubMed under my last name with my first two initials.

39:16.337 --> 39:19.778
You can even see some papers there from the group drastic.

39:19.818 --> 39:23.939
So you can see that I wasn't always where I am now, but actually was

39:25.288 --> 39:28.289
meant to be part of this illusion, part of this theater.

39:29.770 --> 39:37.313
But by the time I had figured out that I was being played, I was able to present most of the biology already to a number of groups all around the world.

39:37.373 --> 39:38.914
All of those groups have lost those

39:39.881 --> 40:01.191
those videos with the exception of the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics, but that group is just strange because like the NCI, like Doctors for COVID Ethics, like PANDA, like Children's Health Defense, like any of these groups, none of them have managed to put together an elevator pitch about anything.

40:02.742 --> 40:17.086
They have forever broadened the umbrella of the things that they talk about, the things that they're concerned about, the things they're sure about, but they can't prioritize anything into a, well, if you need to know something, you should know this.

40:18.006 --> 40:18.526
It's nothing.

40:18.586 --> 40:22.747
They have none of the, none of these organizations have that to offer.

40:24.309 --> 40:31.558
But I can tell you that that book right there essentially has the biology necessary to understand what they've done.

40:31.618 --> 40:41.731
And more importantly, it has a cast of characters, which is largely complete, which can let you know exactly how it was done, as long as you understand that RNA cannot pandemic.

40:41.771 --> 40:43.333
And I told everybody in that book.

40:45.046 --> 40:49.648
that everybody that's involved in that book knows that I exist because I'm listed in that book.

40:49.688 --> 40:51.328
I'm quoted in that book six times.

40:51.388 --> 41:03.052
The quotes that are in that book, the citations that I've helped put into that book, make that book evidence of the illusion and how the illusion was done.

41:04.493 --> 41:13.796
They write books about it that don't question it, that insist on answering other questions, that insist on discussing other issues.

41:16.385 --> 41:21.468
If you want to study something well, you need to understand things in order of priority.

41:23.269 --> 41:28.793
And if RNA cannot pandemic, then the Wuhan coverup is a theater.

41:29.453 --> 41:39.219
If RNA cannot pandemic, then everything that Panda and NCI and Wellness Company and the doctors for COVID is all nonsense.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.122
At very best, it's tertiary.

41:47.441 --> 41:51.785
We are at the stage where we can pull our heads out, where we can show our children what happened.

41:51.825 --> 42:02.213
We can show our children the actual military operation that was designed to use social media against us and catch anybody that was skeptical.

42:04.475 --> 42:06.977
And reinforce the ideas of anybody that wasn't.

42:07.617 --> 42:09.319
And either way, you were trapped.

42:10.980 --> 42:11.761
And the rich

42:12.992 --> 42:35.211
diversity of groups that have spawned from the beginning of the pandemic on, all the way from the fake anti-vax groups that people like Nurse Erin started in Florida before the pandemic, to all the fake groups that exist now, including the one that's having a current meeting right now, the Brownstone in Salt Lake City.

42:36.004 --> 42:52.508
The Brownstone Institute must be seen as nothing more than an elaborate military front for clowns that work on the internet and the ways of laundering the money to them that facilitate that clown show.

42:53.148 --> 42:54.929
None of those people are real.

42:55.984 --> 42:57.265
thinkers of any kind.

42:57.325 --> 43:09.555
None of those people have anything profound to say that they've developed themselves, that they could argue about themselves, that they could pull a bunch of books out that show what they've put together.

43:09.595 --> 43:11.676
They don't put anything together.

43:12.117 --> 43:13.297
They read a script.

43:20.003 --> 43:21.404
You can shut that door if you want, dude.

43:22.935 --> 43:24.375
So I'm working on basketball.

43:25.496 --> 43:26.556
I'm trying my best.

43:26.976 --> 43:28.497
Today I had a good bouncy day.

43:30.277 --> 43:44.262
My shot was a little off because I was bouncing so much and I've got five kilograms of candy that I have to throw in the garbage because I just bought it from my kids that they trick-or-treated and they're not gonna eat.

43:45.362 --> 43:46.522
And I've started to eat.

43:52.768 --> 43:55.969
So yeah, I'm chemtrail retarded and I don't care.

43:55.989 --> 44:18.178
I don't care because I know that what I've done, I know that what I've put together, I know that this collection of books, I know that this collection of notes, I know that this collection of pictures, I know everything that I'm working on right now is what I'm supposed to be doing.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.799
I'm not saying that I heard the voice of God like, uh,

44:22.830 --> 44:23.911
like Sherry Tenpenny.

44:24.191 --> 44:32.716
I'm not saying that I prayed 30 minutes every day and I'm sure that the answer to my prayers is this stream.

44:35.858 --> 44:47.525
But I've never had any real trouble my whole life trying to figure out what was right and what I needed to do, what to do with my day when I woke up.

44:49.085 --> 44:49.846
I never really did.

44:50.905 --> 44:53.226
I didn't have anything like that.

44:53.986 --> 44:58.868
When I see my son having a problem like that, it destroys me.

45:00.388 --> 45:02.589
Because I was blessed never to have that.

45:02.649 --> 45:05.330
First and foremost, because I just wanted to get out of the house.

45:08.311 --> 45:17.834
But ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is just in its smallest

45:19.727 --> 45:21.327
It's just in a miniature right now.

45:22.287 --> 45:29.229
What GigaOM Biological is right now is just one little guy in one little room in one little place in Pittsburgh.

45:30.209 --> 45:31.829
But it's not always going to be that small.

45:33.169 --> 45:36.070
When the children's book comes out, we're going to get a little bigger.

45:37.750 --> 45:41.431
And when the new Biology 101 book comes out, we're going to get a lot bigger.

45:43.171 --> 45:46.552
When our high school classes come out, we're going to get a lot bigger.

45:48.530 --> 45:54.691
And so all I can say is that you have to stay tuned because I have just begun working.

45:56.112 --> 46:00.293
And I have just begun lining things up in a way that this can be sustained.

46:01.273 --> 46:03.453
We don't even have a non-profit officially yet.

46:03.533 --> 46:04.194
Imagine that.

46:10.595 --> 46:11.195
I'm excited.

46:11.655 --> 46:13.536
I'm excited because we're not going to lose.

46:13.556 --> 46:14.896
We're going to destroy them.

46:25.512 --> 46:38.322
I'm Scott Galloway.

46:38.342 --> 46:40.223
I teach NYU and I appreciate your time.

46:40.303 --> 46:42.645
I have 44 slides in 720 seconds.

46:42.685 --> 46:43.626
Let's light this candle.

46:46.397 --> 46:50.281
Okay, so for those of you who don't know me, I'm actually a global television store.

46:50.341 --> 46:50.921
True story.

46:51.562 --> 46:57.708
I've had four TV series in the last three years, two of them being canceled before they were launched, and two were canceled within six weeks.

46:57.768 --> 46:58.489
Let's recap.

46:59.258 --> 47:04.239
If we want to juice this thing, if we want to put a cattle prod up the ass of the economy.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.040
Bloomberg, the most trusted name in financial news.

47:08.161 --> 47:08.681
Not for long.

47:08.841 --> 47:11.902
I'm going to do whatever I can for this country of ours.

47:11.942 --> 47:12.882
Jesus Christ.

47:13.462 --> 47:15.083
Jesus, come on, dude.

47:15.103 --> 47:16.763
You're 0 for 2.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.184
Face for podcasting.

47:21.244 --> 47:25.586
So first insight of the day, I'd like to be the first person to welcome you to the last.

47:27.466 --> 47:27.886
OK.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.167
By the way, it's clear that what's it called?

47:31.187 --> 47:33.068
What are we here for, the brave and the brilliant?

47:33.088 --> 47:35.889
It's clear that Chris is a frustrated soap opera producer.

47:38.690 --> 47:49.934
Essentially, what we have here is a telenovela where, after a night of unbridled passion between Bill Gates and Malcolm Gladwell, they give birth to their bastard love child, Simon Sinek.

47:53.453 --> 47:55.954
Okay, I start us with a question.

47:56.054 --> 47:57.054
Do we love our children?

47:57.274 --> 47:58.935
Sounds like an illegitimate question, right?

47:58.995 --> 48:01.196
Well, I'm going to try and convince you otherwise.

48:01.976 --> 48:09.939
Essentially, as we go down generations, we're seeing that for the last two generations, people are making less money on an inflation-adjusted basis.

48:11.759 --> 48:13.380
Now, you know I'm forever the cynic.

48:14.443 --> 48:29.134
And so I tend to believe that a guy who's been on all of those programs and gotten them canceled and is now on a TED Talk saying that it's going to be the last TED Talk and making fun of, you know, billionaires and stuff like that.

48:30.475 --> 48:36.640
I'm still a little skeptical so I'm going to be watching for holes and I'm going to be listening for holes.

48:38.121 --> 48:42.584
But I don't expect there to be very many because remember that

48:43.462 --> 48:48.949
They kind of have to tell you the truth in order for it to be okay.

48:49.010 --> 48:51.933
In order for everything to go well, the truth has to be out there.

48:52.074 --> 48:55.618
And so there are people who I think of more as announcers.

48:55.678 --> 48:57.861
Their script is to tell you what the truth is.

48:58.755 --> 49:00.436
David Icke was doing a lot of that.

49:01.717 --> 49:03.959
Alex Jones has been scripted to do a lot of that.

49:03.999 --> 49:11.264
There's even parts of what Donald Trump does or what, it's all kind of like that, right?

49:11.464 --> 49:16.868
And so the more, hmm, the more ahead,

49:18.018 --> 49:23.067
The more controversial the idea is, then the more controversial the messenger will be.

49:23.148 --> 49:29.559
That's why David Icke has been so right about so many things and has to be so wrong about so many other things.

49:30.656 --> 49:31.717
So let's listen to Scott.

49:31.917 --> 49:37.419
In addition, the cost of buying a home, the cost of... Remember that Scott is presenting in Canada.

49:37.439 --> 49:42.721
So there's a couple times where I think that's going to become pertinent where he teaches in America.

49:42.781 --> 49:45.142
...education continues to skyrocket.

49:45.182 --> 49:51.004
So the purchasing power, the prosperity is inversely correlated to age.

49:51.204 --> 49:56.166
Simply put, as we get younger, we're taking away opportunity and prosperity from our youngest.

49:56.866 --> 50:05.312
The social contract that is now no longer in place, and for the first time in the US's history, a 30-year-old is no longer doing as well as his or her parents were at 30.

50:05.352 --> 50:10.696
This is a breakdown in the fundamental agreement we have with any society, and it creates rage and shame.

50:11.957 --> 50:17.121
And so people with huge incomes in the audience are clapping, but what does the clapping really mean?

50:17.161 --> 50:20.143
Is that like, you know, we clap for recycling or something?

50:20.183 --> 50:21.083
It's so stupid.

50:21.564 --> 50:23.725
Here's a mistake that I think he makes here.

50:24.226 --> 50:25.847
Who's missing from this chart?

50:30.080 --> 50:36.564
People 35 to 55, is that just like a useless, is that like a useless demographic?

50:38.265 --> 50:39.566
Because I'm 53.

50:42.848 --> 50:44.770
And I think I could run for office.

50:44.990 --> 50:46.571
I think I could work in Congress.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.252
I think I could, you know.

50:49.545 --> 50:55.188
do stuff, and yet he's talking about the extremely proud to be an American.

50:55.228 --> 51:00.371
What about the people that are between the ages of 35 and 55?

51:02.912 --> 51:05.093
Hmm, interesting omission.

51:05.814 --> 51:13.198
As a result, people over the age of 55 feel pretty good about America, but less than one in five people under the age of 34 feel very good about America.

51:13.885 --> 51:15.206
This creates an incendiary.

51:15.986 --> 51:22.670
Righteous movements, cuts to our society end up becoming opportunistic infections because generally speaking, young people have a warranted envy.

51:23.071 --> 51:26.113
Become opportunistic infections.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.974
It's not good mixed metaphor.

51:28.314 --> 51:34.558
They're pissed off and they're angry that they don't enjoy the same spoils and prosperity that were provided to our generation.

51:35.788 --> 51:41.570
A decent proxy for how much we value use labor is minimum wage, and we've kept it purposely pretty low.

51:41.590 --> 51:47.611
If it had just kept pace with productivity, it'd be at about 23 bucks a share, but we've decided to purposely keep it low.

51:48.372 --> 51:53.413
Out of reach, median home price has skyrocketed relative to median household income.

51:53.913 --> 51:56.774
As a result, pre-pandemic, the average mortgage payment was $1,100.

51:57.754 --> 52:02.976
It's now $2,300 because of an acceleration in interest rates and the fact that the average home has gone from

52:03.836 --> 52:04.978
290,000 to 420,000.

52:05.378 --> 52:11.984
By the way, the most expensive homes in the world, based on this metric, are number three, Vancouver.

52:12.104 --> 52:12.425
Why?

52:12.485 --> 52:16.329
Because 60 percent of the cost of building a home goes to permits, because guess what?

52:16.369 --> 52:25.938
The incumbents that own assets have weaponized government to make it very difficult for new entrants to ever get their own assets, thereby elevating their own net worth.

52:26.018 --> 52:28.120
This is the transfer I'm going to be speaking about.

52:31.294 --> 52:41.940
This has resulted in an enormous transfer of wealth, where people over the age of 70 used to control 19 percent of household income versus people under the age of 40 used to control 12.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.382
Their wealth has been cut in half.

52:44.762 --> 52:45.983
This isn't by accident.

52:46.103 --> 52:46.883
It's purposeful.

52:47.323 --> 52:48.804
This is me at UCLA in 1987.

52:49.365 --> 52:51.606
I know your first thought is, I haven't changed a bit.

52:53.342 --> 52:56.666
This is also Mia Saverio, who is the analyst who put together these slides.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.287
By the way, Mia is 26.

52:58.347 --> 52:59.028
I did the math.

52:59.188 --> 53:04.254
Just by virtue of her being in this audience, it brings the average age of the entire conference down 11 days.

53:07.377 --> 53:10.700
When I applied to UCLA, the admissions rate was 76 percent.

53:11.722 --> 53:12.763
Today, it's nine percent.

53:13.598 --> 53:16.000
I received a 2.23 GPA from UCLA.

53:16.020 --> 53:20.042
I learned nothing but how to make bombs out of household items and every line from Planet of the Apes.

53:20.602 --> 53:25.546
And the greatest public school in the world, Berkeley, decided to let me in with a 2.27 GPA.

53:26.206 --> 53:27.607
And that's what higher ed is about.

53:28.267 --> 53:32.950
Higher ed is about taking unremarkable kids and giving them a shot at being remarkable.

53:37.993 --> 53:40.135
And every year, it's gotten more expensive.

53:41.135 --> 53:50.640
Higher ed and homes and the ability, not only is higher ed incredibly expensive, it's not accessible, because me and my colleagues are drunk on luxury, and I'll come back to that.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.401
We've embraced the ultimate strategy.

53:53.441 --> 53:57.843
Me and my colleagues in higher ed wake up every morning and ask ourselves the same question when we look in the mirror.

53:58.904 --> 54:02.866
How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability?

54:05.002 --> 54:05.623
I see.

54:05.683 --> 54:12.647
So he's an academic and he's coming down on academia because academia is so snotty and so naughty and so bad.

54:12.667 --> 54:14.769
Yeah, I don't know.

54:14.829 --> 54:16.270
I think this is kind of scripted.

54:16.710 --> 54:19.112
He's going to say a few things that probably make sense.

54:19.152 --> 54:25.536
He's probably going to say something about age gating or ID required on social media.

54:26.537 --> 54:29.359
Hopefully he'll make the point correctly.

54:29.959 --> 54:31.180
If he doesn't, I'll correct him.

54:31.877 --> 54:42.444
The ultimate strategy, it's called an LVMH strategy, where we artificially constrain supply to create aspiration and scarcity such that we can raise tuition faster than inflation.

54:43.305 --> 54:46.927
And old people and wealthy people have done the same thing with housing.

54:46.967 --> 54:52.971
All of a sudden, once you own a home, you become very concerned with traffic, and you make sure that there's no new housing permits.

54:53.631 --> 54:57.554
And here is a memo to my colleagues in higher ed.

54:58.234 --> 55:00.676
We're public servants, not fucking Chanel bags.

55:05.486 --> 55:07.247
Harvard is the best example of this.

55:07.267 --> 55:12.471
They've increased their endowment in the last 40 years and have decided to expand their enrollment, their freshman class.

55:12.731 --> 55:13.511
Now, I like this.

55:13.531 --> 55:20.216
I think all universities that have an endowment of billions of dollars should definitely not be getting U.S.

55:20.576 --> 55:21.837
taxpayer money anymore.

55:22.578 --> 55:26.040
University of Pittsburgh is one of those giant weaponized piles of money.

55:27.161 --> 55:29.722
Harvard has a giant weaponized pile of money.

55:29.863 --> 55:33.165
It's ridiculous that they would take any government funding at all.

55:33.485 --> 55:33.605
By 4%.

55:35.405 --> 55:44.896
Any university that doesn't grow their freshman class faster than population that has over a billion dollars in endowment should lose their tax-free status because they're no longer in higher education.

55:44.936 --> 55:46.238
They're a hedge fund offering classes.

55:53.482 --> 56:02.865
My first recommendation, Biden should take some of that 750 billion earmark to bail out the one third of people that got to go to college on the backs of the two thirds that didn't.

56:03.045 --> 56:14.188
See, the thing about it is, is that they're still presenting this argument incorrectly as though people who went to college are somehow better off than the people who didn't go to college.

56:15.675 --> 56:34.787
when a majority of the people who went to college and have student loans regret taking out the student loans and regret going to college and aren't really making that much more money than they would have if they would have made other choices and certainly would be in much better financial status

56:35.427 --> 56:37.428
had they made different choices.

56:37.488 --> 57:00.153
And so, again, it's very consistent that the idea of taking out student loans and going to university was something that a bunch of people did, and that made them very lucky and very advantaged, as opposed to being dumb 18-year-olds that walked into a financial aid office and were told to sign at the line, and then you can go back to your dorm room.

57:02.230 --> 57:05.931
Because that's the reality of university financial aid.

57:05.991 --> 57:08.611
That's the reality of financial aid in the 90s.

57:09.831 --> 57:12.472
You could have gone to any university that you wanted to.

57:12.512 --> 57:17.573
You'd just go to the financial aid office and they would apply for everything and get you as much as you needed.

57:19.713 --> 57:28.695
And that was true at lots and lots of universities at lots and lots of different levels because there was a plethora of money to go along with it.

57:29.502 --> 57:31.244
And it was all backed by the government.

57:31.304 --> 57:40.414
So again, he can make it seem like that was a lot of money for people, but it was really a lot of money that those people never saw, right?

57:40.474 --> 57:42.936
It just went right to the university.

57:45.239 --> 57:51.486
It's not like we also got a car or like, you know, some clothes or we got some books, I guess that was it.

57:54.588 --> 58:10.641
And so understand that, right, that this student loan money that was given freely to 18 year olds at the, you know, whatever the price of the university was, the universities didn't get, you know, 18,000 a year, 21,000 a year, 4,000 a year, what does it matter, right?

58:18.055 --> 58:39.081
and so again painting this picture as though a bunch of people were given money that they should have never been given and some other people didn't give money and then not talking about the universities that got the money where he works but now he's talking about not bailing out

58:39.966 --> 58:47.074
the victims of the debt that really should be just subsidized money to universities, right?

58:47.094 --> 58:48.036
Cause that's all it was.

58:48.136 --> 58:56.966
But instead we, instead of subsidizing the universities directly, we had all these idiot 18 year old kids just sign at the dotted line.

58:57.467 --> 58:59.990
And now we're talking about them like they're spoiled brats.

59:02.859 --> 59:18.382
when all the people above them, all the adults in the room knew that the government was putting all this money out there and these universities were printing all these brochures so that they could get all the students they could so that they could get all the money that the government was putting out there.

59:19.102 --> 59:32.485
And they had huge financial aid offices with many, many, many, many offices with long hallways with very poorly trained young people that were just, you know, maybe a year or two older than the person that they were getting to sign at the line.

59:34.960 --> 59:37.442
So I don't really agree with this part.

59:40.204 --> 59:45.368
And give a billion dollars to our 500 greatest public institutions, size adjusted in exchange for three things.

59:45.588 --> 59:48.010
One, they use technology and scale.

59:48.070 --> 59:51.813
Why would we give any more money to these institutions?

59:53.015 --> 59:54.416
Gosh, it doesn't make sense.

59:54.436 --> 59:56.376
To reduce tuition by 2% a year.

59:56.856 --> 01:00:07.140
And they don't need to expand enrollments if the enrollment total number of people available in the public population pyramid is declining.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.583
We don't need to increase enrollment of any elementary schools here in our Pittsburgh area.

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:19.065
We need to consolidate elementary schools because there ain't so many kids anymore.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:25.290
He's about to tell you that all these young people, like half as many people, want to have kids.

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:36.518
So why do we need to expand enrollments at universities that are already overfunded, already overcharging because they know that all these loans are going to be federally subsidized?

01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:38.040
Why in the world?

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.501
What is he talking about?

01:00:41.112 --> 01:00:46.914
expand enrollments by 6% a year and increase the number of vocational certifications and non-traditional four-year degrees by 20%.

01:00:47.014 --> 01:00:48.915
Where does that get us?

01:00:49.795 --> 01:00:54.196
In just 10 years, in just 10 years, that doubles the freshmen seats.

01:00:54.356 --> 01:00:56.277
Two times as many freshmen seats.

01:00:56.397 --> 01:00:58.698
Unfortunately, we won't have two to any time.

01:00:59.078 --> 01:01:01.459
Two times as many people want to go to college.

01:01:01.499 --> 01:01:03.039
There won't even be that many kids.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:05.380
See how stupid this is?

01:01:08.783 --> 01:01:20.850
But you know, he's telling you all this shit that he knows about the average age in the room and he's done all the calculations, but he hasn't looked up the population pyramid to wonder whether or not we need twice as many freshmen seats.

01:01:26.213 --> 01:01:31.216
You know, the population pyramid is something that is so remarkably undiscussed.

01:01:32.117 --> 01:01:33.958
It's gotta be a script.

01:01:35.782 --> 01:01:37.043
and cuts the cost in half.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:38.283
This isn't radical.

01:01:38.323 --> 01:01:40.645
This is called college in the 80s and 90s.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:43.066
Another transfer of wealth.

01:01:43.426 --> 01:01:44.587
Look at what's happened to wages.

01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:47.108
Oh, they've gone up, not as much as corporate profits.

01:01:47.608 --> 01:01:49.589
There's a healthy tension between capital and labor.

01:01:49.629 --> 01:01:51.751
You're not kidding, administration bloomed.

01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:56.873
I mean, there are more associate deans at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

01:01:57.494 --> 01:02:03.557
The dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine gets more than $2 million a year in salary.

01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:08.895
He gets paid as much as the football coach for the love of goodness.

01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:23.252
they barely register.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:30.840
It's been an amazing time to own assets, but your attempt to get the certification or the income such that you can acquire assets has gotten harder and harder.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.323
In my class of 300 kids, it's never been easier to be a billionaire.

01:02:34.483 --> 01:02:35.965
It's never been harder to be a millionaire.

01:02:36.005 --> 01:02:45.614
By the way, our job in higher ed isn't to identify a top one percent of people who are freakishly remarkable or have rich parents and turn them into a superclass of billionaires.

01:02:46.024 --> 01:02:48.385
is to give the bottom 90 a chance to be in the top 10.

01:02:48.686 --> 01:02:58.031
See, what he's telling you there is that there's this really freakish small set of people that they go to university and they become billionaires.

01:02:58.051 --> 01:03:04.495
You know, like Alex Karp and I don't know, like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:06.957
And that's just a complete bullshit lie.

01:03:07.657 --> 01:03:24.117
It's easier to become a billionaire because these weaponized piles of money have been around for four generations or more now and because the military-industrial complex has seeded military technology in the guise of business moguls.

01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:30.654
And that's why he's gonna make fun of Jeff Bezos in a second here, but never make that connection.

01:03:30.714 --> 01:03:39.556
He's not gonna say, it's funny that Jeff Bezos is so unremarkable as a man, but he's so remarkable as a businessman.

01:03:43.797 --> 01:03:47.398
Again, it's just stupid because everybody's playing a role.

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:51.839
It's Halloween all the time in real life in America.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.840
It's tales from the script.

01:03:58.269 --> 01:04:02.252
You know who doesn't need me or higher education?

01:04:02.492 --> 01:04:03.673
The top 10 percent.

01:04:04.213 --> 01:04:12.138
The whole point of higher ed is to give the unremarkables, I, yours truly, who was raised by a single immigrant mother, a shot at being remarkable.

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:15.360
The transfer has been purposeful.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:24.225
While the cohorts, corporations and the ultra-wealthy continue to garner more and more of our wealth, we have decided, I know, if they win the gold, let's give them the silver and the bronze

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.491
This transfer is purposeful.

01:04:28.551 --> 01:04:29.632
It's not by accident.

01:04:30.593 --> 01:04:31.093
And it works.

01:04:31.573 --> 01:04:33.935
Senior poverty is way down, and we should celebrate that.

01:04:34.015 --> 01:04:36.437
Meanwhile, child poverty is flat to up.

01:04:37.938 --> 01:04:38.758
The third rail.

01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:40.720
I'm going to talk about Social Security.

01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:51.347
So old people are doing OK, which means maybe we have to

01:04:52.324 --> 01:05:00.126
Think about the population pyramid again and the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, the anticipated rise in the weight on Medicare.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:06.487
So they shifted the economic policies in America to make sure that the old people had enough money to retire.

01:05:09.888 --> 01:05:12.788
And they didn't do anything for child poverty at all.

01:05:12.848 --> 01:05:16.069
It's funny because there's this organization called Children's Health Defense

01:05:17.173 --> 01:05:25.537
And one of the things that Children's Health Defense never talks about is child frickin' poverty in America.

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:41.404
That's because they are a scripted fraudulent organization, and many of them are national security actors behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's just a Truman Show victim since he was about 14 years old.

01:05:41.424 --> 01:05:46.786
You know, when the American national security state had just killed his uncle and his dad.

01:05:48.427 --> 01:05:51.788
It would cost $11 billion to... And Estes Kefauver!

01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:56.179
the child tax credit, but that got stripped out of the infrastructure bill.

01:05:56.699 --> 01:06:02.603
But the additional 135 billion dollars a year to Social Security, that flies right through Congress.

01:06:02.663 --> 01:06:15.911
And every year, we transfer 1.4 trillion dollars from a cohort that is increasingly doing less well to the cohort that is the wealthiest cohort in the history of this planet.

01:06:17.232 --> 01:06:22.175
I'm not against Social Security, but the criteria should be if you need it, not whether you have a catheter.

01:06:23.653 --> 01:06:29.617
80 percent of you have absolutely no reason to ever take Social Security.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:36.041
It is bankrupting our nation, and we have fallen under this mythology that somehow it's this great social program.

01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:36.582
No, it's not.

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:38.983
It's the great transfer of wealth from young to old.

01:06:43.326 --> 01:06:44.447
How is this happening?

01:06:45.307 --> 01:06:48.009
Because our representatives are, in fact, representative.

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:49.410
Old people vote.

01:06:50.734 --> 01:06:54.477
Washington has become a cross between the land of the dead and the Golden Girls.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.962
Quite frankly, this is fucking ridiculous.

01:07:01.963 --> 01:07:07.007
And if I sound ageist, if I sound ageist, I am.

01:07:07.067 --> 01:07:08.388
And you know who else is ageist?

01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:09.669
Biology.

01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:18.777
When Speaker Pelosi... Now, I don't care about blaming the boomers.

01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:20.138
They vote.

01:07:21.294 --> 01:07:28.139
What I care about is the idea that somebody like Thomas Massey is supposed to be real.

01:07:29.199 --> 01:07:37.184
But Thomas Massey, being the big real guy he is, has never challenged that dipshit at the end of the row over there.

01:07:37.605 --> 01:07:40.687
He just stays in the House of Representatives and runs every two years.

01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:44.429
He doesn't want to challenge the big old senator from Kentucky.

01:07:48.572 --> 01:07:49.953
That's because he's on a script.

01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:55.676
Thomas Massey knows who I am, he's heard of my work, he knows that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:07:55.656 --> 01:08:03.182
's a fraud, he knows that Book's a fraud, he knows that Steve Bannon's a fraud, he knows that they're all frauds because he's been told three separate times.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.791
Just like medical doctors for COVID ethics knows they're all frauds.

01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:24.544
They've been told multiple times, just like the doctors for COVID ethics knows, just like the people that work for CHD know, just like everybody knows and has to keep pretending as though they don't know that this is all bullshit.

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:35.792
She had her first child, get this, two-thirds of households didn't have color televisions, and Castro had just declared martial law.

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:45.735
But she's supposed to understand the challenges of a 17-year-old girl who's 5'9", 95 pounds, getting tips on dieting and extreme dieting from Facebook?

01:08:46.175 --> 01:08:51.116
She's supposed to understand the challenges that a 27-year-old single mother face?

01:08:52.276 --> 01:08:53.516
By the way, young and dreamy.

01:08:53.536 --> 01:08:56.237
Young and dreamy.

01:09:01.772 --> 01:09:05.953
The great intergenerational theft took place under the auspices of a virus.

01:09:06.113 --> 01:09:06.473
I know.

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:10.834
Let's use the greatest health crisis in the century to really speedball the transfer.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:14.835
This is the NASDAQ from 2008 to 2012.

01:09:15.155 --> 01:09:16.795
We let the markets crash.

01:09:17.496 --> 01:09:24.117
And by the way, you need churn, you need disruption, because it seeds and recalibrates advantage and wealth from the incumbents to the entrants.

01:09:24.177 --> 01:09:26.238
It's a natural part of the cycle.

01:09:26.738 --> 01:09:27.258
But wait.

01:09:28.211 --> 01:09:35.594
Lately, no, a million people dying would be bad, but what would be tragic is if we let the Nasdaq go down and guys like me lost wealth.

01:09:36.194 --> 01:09:41.016
So we pumped the economy, which again, increased the massive transfer of wealth.

01:09:41.056 --> 01:09:42.436
The best two years of my life?

01:09:42.856 --> 01:09:43.316
COVID.

01:09:43.456 --> 01:09:49.659
More time with my kids, more time with Netflix, and the value of my stocks absolutely exploded.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.540
And who has to pay for my prosperity?

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.220
Not me.

01:09:54.062 --> 01:09:58.266
future generations who will have to deal with an unprecedented level of debt.

01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:02.189
Why am I here, and why do I get the prosperity I enjoy?

01:10:02.249 --> 01:10:05.792
Because in 2008, we bailed out the banks, but we didn't bail out the economy.

01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:07.774
We let the markets fall.

01:10:07.854 --> 01:10:14.199
So as I was coming into my prime income earning years, I got to buy, no joke, these stocks at these prices.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.501
This is where those stocks are now.

01:10:17.202 --> 01:10:19.204
Where does a young person find disruption?

01:10:19.926 --> 01:10:28.589
When you bail out the baby boomer owner of a restaurant, all you're doing is robbing opportunity from the 26-year-old graduate of a culinary academy that wants her shot.

01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:29.729
We need disruption.

01:10:44.034 --> 01:10:45.375
But people don't understand.

01:10:45.395 --> 01:10:48.616
They think it's funny.

01:10:50.094 --> 01:10:51.455
But they don't understand.

01:10:52.576 --> 01:10:57.038
It's impossible that he has billions of dollars and they don't.

01:10:58.219 --> 01:10:59.320
Unless it's by design.

01:11:00.361 --> 01:11:02.742
Unless it's just a system.

01:11:03.783 --> 01:11:11.408
An orchestrated theater of bullshit where for them money doesn't matter because it doesn't matter outside with the slavers at all.

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:17.772
I just like this slide, it has no context or relevance.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:35.602
We're economically attacking the young, but I know, let's attack their emotional and mental well-being.

01:11:35.622 --> 01:11:43.485
Let's take advantage of the fact of the flaws in our species with medieval institutions, paleolithic instincts and godlike technology.

01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:49.387
I'm just going to say, I think Mark Zuckerberg has done more damage to young people on our nation while making more money than any person in history.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:12:00.750
If Facebook was his, if Facebook was something he controlled, if Facebook was something that he made,

01:12:02.762 --> 01:12:03.382
But it's not.

01:12:04.743 --> 01:12:07.004
It's something that Hollywood's told us he made.

01:12:11.746 --> 01:12:19.490
Just like Hollywood or 60 Minutes tells us that Alex Karp made Palantir with PayPal engineers.

01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:21.511
It's just stupid.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:26.314
And unfortunately, it's possible that Scott can't see that.

01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:30.827
He can't see the absurdity of Jeff Bezos as an admission.

01:12:31.327 --> 01:12:34.848
He can't see the absurdity of Alex Karp as an admission.

01:12:35.289 --> 01:12:41.331
He can't see the vapid ridiculousness of Elon Musk being an admission.

01:12:43.732 --> 01:12:45.973
And that's where social media works.

01:12:46.054 --> 01:12:49.095
That's where the illusion of consensus works.

01:12:49.835 --> 01:12:55.778
And that's why Alex Karp believed what he believed and believes what he believes now, because he knows, he's minted.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.321
Just like Jessica Rhodes knew she was minted for the first two years of COVID.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:15.190
just like Robert Malone knew he was minted, just like, I mean, it's impressive, ladies and gentlemen, once you see it.

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:16.611
I don't think Scott can see it.

01:13:16.631 --> 01:13:21.715
I don't even know if Scott understands how bad some of the things that he's saying are.

01:13:22.276 --> 01:13:27.780
He might just be, you know, so insulated from reality that he doesn't really get it.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.761
He's just too high up.

01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:29.682
Well, wait, what could be worse?

01:13:29.742 --> 01:13:36.668
It's as if we let an adversary implant a neural jack into our youth to raise a generation of civic, military, and business leaders that hate America.

01:13:38.277 --> 01:13:39.598
How can we be this stupid?

01:13:42.321 --> 01:13:45.443
All right, this all adds up to a bunch of graphs all headed up and to the right.

01:13:45.543 --> 01:13:46.204
And what are they?

01:13:46.484 --> 01:13:47.305
What's the first one?

01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:56.473
Oh, that's self-harm rates, which have exploded, especially among girls, since my colleague Jonathan Haidt pointed out it's really gone crazy since social went on mobile.

01:13:57.154 --> 01:13:57.954
What's the next one?

01:13:58.275 --> 01:13:59.235
Teens with depression.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.938
The next one, men and women not having sex.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.799
Biggest fear of my parents was that I was going to get into too much trouble.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:08.783
My biggest fear, honestly, is that my kids aren't going to get into enough trouble.

01:14:08.823 --> 01:14:15.653
By the way, my advice to every young person watching this program is go out, drink more and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.

01:14:20.259 --> 01:14:21.020
Next graph.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.060
Cumulative gun deaths.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.663
You're more likely to be shot in the United States if you're a toddler or an infant than a cop.

01:14:26.203 --> 01:14:26.863
Next graph.

01:14:27.324 --> 01:14:28.004
Obesity.

01:14:28.324 --> 01:14:28.785
Way up.

01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:35.649
By the way, the industrial food complex wants to addict you to shitty, fatty food so they can hand you over to the industrial diabetes complex.

01:14:36.049 --> 01:14:37.730
We should not romanticize obesity.

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:40.252
You're not finding your fucking truth, you're finding diabetes.

01:14:44.094 --> 01:14:44.995
Overdose deaths.

01:14:45.095 --> 01:14:45.535
Way up.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:46.456
Deaths of despair.

01:14:46.496 --> 01:14:48.157
When I was in high school, it was drunk driving.

01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:49.478
Now it's kids killing themselves.

01:14:49.841 --> 01:14:50.321
Look at that.

01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:57.085
The largest single increase is right there at the start of the pandemic.

01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:01.447
And this is ages 15 to 24.

01:15:01.647 --> 01:15:08.291
That's the age group that Mark's son is in when he died.

01:15:08.311 --> 01:15:09.131
22, I think.

01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:18.717
That's some pretty fucked up shit right here, excuse my language, but this is where America is right now and America is here not by accident, not because a bunch of

01:15:19.694 --> 01:15:26.137
media titans and, uh, you know, their wives with fake boobs are out of our control.

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.700
Mark Zuckerberg is out of our control.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.162
Jeff Bezos and Amazon is out of our control.

01:15:34.762 --> 01:15:40.185
We're being flooded by Chinese goods because this is out of our, capitalism's out of our control.

01:15:40.805 --> 01:15:42.186
AI's out of our control.

01:15:44.699 --> 01:15:46.719
It's all by design, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:46.779 --> 01:15:48.560
America is being controlled, demolished.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.320
Wake up and apologize right now.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.301
Young people don't want to have kids anymore.

01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:57.581
Two-thirds of people aged 30 to 34, able-bodied, used to decide to have at least one child.

01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:58.861
It's been cut in half.

01:15:59.162 --> 01:16:04.322
So now why do we need so many freshmen seats at universities then, Scott?

01:16:04.382 --> 01:16:05.223
I don't understand.

01:16:05.283 --> 01:16:08.063
Are you thinking about population pyramid at all?

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:12.544
Or just it's off your radar because it's scripted that way?

01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:13.224
I don't get it.

01:16:15.882 --> 01:16:18.604
It's now less than a third, 27 percent.

01:16:19.445 --> 01:16:22.548
As a result, people over the age of 60 in the US, pretty happy.

01:16:22.628 --> 01:16:24.730
People under the age of 30, not so much.

01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:26.171
Some of the lowest in the free world.

01:16:27.092 --> 01:16:27.712
What can we do?

01:16:27.812 --> 01:16:30.214
Nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with it.

01:16:30.535 --> 01:16:32.136
We got the hard stuff figured out.

01:16:32.316 --> 01:16:36.360
There are programs to address all of these issues that cost a lot of money, that's the hard part.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.921
And we have figured this out.

01:16:38.822 --> 01:16:42.445
In just five minutes, post an earnings call, we can add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the economy.

01:16:44.562 --> 01:16:52.467
So what he's telling you is, is that with market manipulation, we can create giant piles of money in a matter of minutes.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:17:02.794
You know, like Donald Trump did with the tariff arguments over and over and over again, and then made jokes about his friends making billions of dollars on trades.

01:17:05.716 --> 01:17:07.097
He's talking about that right here.

01:17:07.658 --> 01:17:11.821
He's comparing Nvidia stock increases over one earnings report

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.940
to the cost of some of these programs.

01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:41.850
He's telling you the truth in this sense, that the monopoly money and the huge weaponized piles of money that are tumbling around in the back closet and the people that get to scrape money out of these giant drums of tumbling money, this is absurdity, ladies and gentlemen, how our economy is run and how down here at the bottom

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:44.754
The trickle-down people down here.

01:17:44.854 --> 01:17:46.455
This has got to end.

01:17:47.556 --> 01:17:49.797
For our children's sake, this has to end.

01:17:50.658 --> 01:17:52.619
This illusion has to end.

01:17:53.139 --> 01:17:55.261
These frauds have to end.

01:17:55.301 --> 01:17:58.042
The fraudulent system has to end.

01:18:00.003 --> 01:18:08.068
And this fraudulent era of manufactured success has to end.

01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.810
No more fake it till you make it, people.

01:18:12.349 --> 01:18:14.791
but the hard part figured out, the resources.

01:18:17.054 --> 01:18:19.356
We have the money, but we decide not to do it.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:23.060
This is per capita spending on childcare in the United States relative to other nations.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.982
This is housing permits.

01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:27.004
Things are doable.

01:18:27.204 --> 01:18:29.366
We increase minimum wage to 25 bucks an hour.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:30.987
It goes into the economy.

01:18:31.528 --> 01:18:35.432
The wonderful things about low- and middle-income households is they spend all their money.

01:18:35.848 --> 01:18:41.830
We have to have a restore or a progressive tax structure with alternative minimum tax on corporations and wealthy individuals.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.371
We need to refund the IRS.

01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:45.511
We need to reform Social Security.

01:18:45.551 --> 01:18:48.732
It should be based on whether you need the money, not on how old you are.

01:18:49.153 --> 01:18:50.853
We need a negative income tax, my friend.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:55.935
And whether you need the money or not, well then why don't we talk about corporations that don't need money?

01:18:57.281 --> 01:19:01.102
Why don't we talk about corporations and how they don't pay taxes?

01:19:01.522 --> 01:19:05.763
He's talking about things like a minimum tax and yada, yada, yada.

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:16.645
Why don't we talk about the fact that all of these countries, sorry, these companies have their headquarters in like Ireland and in Amsterdam, depending on whether it's like intellectual property or not.

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.485
And why do they do that?

01:19:20.726 --> 01:19:22.226
I mean, this kind of,

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:31.062
Hand-waving stuff here and fired up stuff here It's I'm starting not to buy it anymore because he hits some of the easy notes.

01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:38.705
He misses some of the dunks some of the layups And he doesn't even take any three-pointers.

01:19:38.905 --> 01:19:40.626
So to me, this is interesting.

01:19:42.506 --> 01:19:53.390
I Was hoping it was gonna be better Andrew Yang screwed up a great idea, but he branded it incorrectly instead of calling it UBI He should got Republicans on board by calling it a negative income tax and

01:19:55.936 --> 01:19:58.457
We need to eliminate the capital gains tax deduction.

01:19:58.537 --> 01:19:58.797
Why?

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:03.439
When did we decide that the money that capital earns is more noble than the money that sweat earns?

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:04.880
That's for sure.

01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.002
I mean, it is stupid that we do that.

01:20:09.182 --> 01:20:10.723
But nobody's ever going to change that.

01:20:12.804 --> 01:20:13.444
Nobody that.

01:20:14.845 --> 01:20:17.906
Nobody that they allowed to get into office would ever change that.

01:20:18.687 --> 01:20:19.487
Shouldn't it be flipped?

01:20:22.196 --> 01:20:26.077
We need to remove 230 protection for all algorithmically elevated content.

01:20:26.437 --> 01:20:27.997
We need identity verification.

01:20:28.297 --> 01:20:32.718
The reason we can have identity verification is because we have a First Amendment.

01:20:38.119 --> 01:20:39.320
No clapping.

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:43.580
The reason why is because they're in Canada.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.661
They don't understand it.

01:20:44.721 --> 01:20:45.681
What does that mean to you?

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.481
Because I think that's a really important point that he makes there.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:21:00.286
The reason why we can have, the reason why we can have digital ID in America is because we have freedom of speech.

01:21:01.767 --> 01:21:10.732
And so you don't have to be afraid of being identified on the internet because you can say whatever you want in America.

01:21:12.512 --> 01:21:13.733
At least that's what he's arguing.

01:21:13.813 --> 01:21:15.474
In other countries, that might not be so.

01:21:17.776 --> 01:21:20.238
Maybe in America it won't be so in a few years, I don't know.

01:21:22.359 --> 01:21:24.080
But that argument is an interesting one.

01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:32.766
Because you could also make the argument that anonymity on the internet is what would protect free speech the best.

01:21:34.673 --> 01:21:41.618
would allow ideas to be freely exchanged without any possibility of there being that.

01:21:41.698 --> 01:21:44.279
Free speech and guaranteeing it is two different things.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.362
The principle of and guaranteeing it and enforcing it are two different things.

01:21:49.222 --> 01:21:57.208
A company is still an entity that has the freedom to fire somebody for whatever they want to, and so free speech only exists in certain contexts.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:22:02.111
And so what he's saying makes sense but doesn't, and the fact that he said it in Canada

01:22:03.123 --> 01:22:05.064
and gets no clapping from it is pretty cool.

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:07.645
They don't get it at all.

01:22:09.086 --> 01:22:10.007
Wake up big tech.

01:22:10.047 --> 01:22:14.369
We have monopolies that are incurring greater and greater costs on every small business and parents.

01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:18.071
Because again, see above our representatives don't understand these technologies.

01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:20.012
We need to age gate social media.

01:22:20.032 --> 01:22:24.214
There's absolutely no reason anyone under the age of 16 should ever be on social media.

01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:28.814
We need universal pre-K.

01:22:28.954 --> 01:22:31.876
We need to reinstate the expanded child tax credit.

01:22:31.936 --> 01:22:34.077
We need term limits, see above Andrew Yang.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.878
We need income-based affirmative action, any visible.

01:22:37.799 --> 01:22:42.802
We could age-gate an anonymous internet, though.

01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:49.605
I think you could still do that, at least on the public side.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:50.266
Think about that.

01:22:51.228 --> 01:22:53.530
signs of affirmative action make no sense at all.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:23:01.536
You would rather be born gay or nonwhite in the United States today than poor, and that's a sign of our progress and our need to recalibrate who we give advantage to.

01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:07.621
Affirmative action, of which I'm a beneficiary of, I got Pell grants, I got unfair advantage.

01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:11.163
Affirmative action is a wonderful thing, and it should be based on color.

01:23:11.303 --> 01:23:14.726
It should be based on green, how much money you have or don't have.

01:23:15.675 --> 01:23:23.564
expand college enrollment and vocational programs, mental health, ban phones in schools, invest in third places, Big Brothers and Sisters programs.

01:23:23.864 --> 01:23:25.046
We need national service.

01:23:25.086 --> 01:23:35.658
We need to tell people in the United States and Canada that they live in the greatest countries in the world, and we need to remind them of that every day by exposing them to other great Americans where they feel connected to you.

01:23:36.843 --> 01:23:37.963
We can do all of this.

01:23:38.703 --> 01:23:39.724
We can do all of it.

01:23:39.924 --> 01:23:41.004
We have the resources.

01:23:41.044 --> 01:23:42.404
The question is, do we have the will?

01:23:42.444 --> 01:23:43.684
This is my last slide.

01:23:44.204 --> 01:23:47.085
It is an emotionally manipulative slide to try and get you to like me more.

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.246
But it does have a message.

01:23:53.926 --> 01:23:55.126
This is the whole shooting match.

01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:58.767
Anybody here without kids, ask someone with kids.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:02.588
You have your world of work, you have your world of friends, you have your world of kids.

01:24:03.433 --> 01:24:06.975
Something happens here, your whole world shrinks to this.

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:11.799
Don't get emotional on me because that's just lame.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:20.324
My brother doesn't have any kids and what he needs to hear is that he's not doing anything to build for the next generation.

01:24:21.145 --> 01:24:26.248
He's not doing anything to contribute to the next generation unless he's teaching other people's kids.

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:31.512
And so then he's not doing a whole lot of useful shit.

01:24:32.796 --> 01:24:38.977
I'm sorry, but that's really the way that people need to start seeing life.

01:24:40.858 --> 01:24:43.918
You aren't on earth to start a photography business.

01:24:44.359 --> 01:24:51.400
You aren't on earth to build bird houses.

01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:59.922
The vast majority of the people on earth that are really here to do something need to raise a child.

01:25:03.539 --> 01:25:06.862
Most of us, I think, I don't know.

01:25:08.583 --> 01:25:10.444
There's nothing more important than that.

01:25:10.544 --> 01:25:22.514
And if you are lucky enough to find someone and have children, then you're doing work that's more important than any other work on earth.

01:25:22.654 --> 01:25:26.557
And that work is more important than any other work on earth.

01:25:26.677 --> 01:25:31.961
And so if you're screwing it up, you're screwing up the most important job there is.

01:25:35.842 --> 01:25:53.793
Speaking of neo-Kantian ideas that Alex Karp spoke about, another idea of Kant is that humans should never be used as a means to an end, because every human is an end in and of themselves.

01:25:57.795 --> 01:26:05.260
And that's a pretty deep thought that Immanuel Kant came up with, that you don't need any neo-Kantian ideas to alter

01:26:06.988 --> 01:26:10.310
It's a very, very powerful and persuasive idea.

01:26:15.472 --> 01:26:18.374
You can't use a person as a means to an end.

01:26:18.434 --> 01:26:19.234
So slavery?

01:26:19.554 --> 01:26:19.875
Nope.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:21.776
Prostitution?

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:22.256
Nope.

01:26:25.878 --> 01:26:27.138
Soldiers and war?

01:26:27.358 --> 01:26:27.939
Not really.

01:26:27.959 --> 01:26:34.442
A person cannot be a means to an end.

01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:39.271
Can't be an experimental animal then either now, can you?

01:26:44.812 --> 01:26:45.932
I don't know, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:45.972 --> 01:26:47.033
I think this is breaking.

01:26:47.073 --> 01:26:48.613
I just don't know how it's gonna break.

01:26:48.653 --> 01:26:49.813
I don't know when it will break.

01:26:51.074 --> 01:26:52.674
I don't know if we're gonna see it break.

01:26:54.575 --> 01:26:59.896
I just know that it'll become less and less painful every day that we keep fighting, every day that we stand up for this.

01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:12.134
So I present, as I wrap here, with just a few questions.

01:27:12.335 --> 01:27:20.620
One, if you acknowledge that our kids are the most important thing in our lives, that everything else we do here is meaningful, but our kids' well-being and prosperity is profound.

01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:26.024
If you acknowledge that they're doing more poorly than previous generations.

01:27:26.945 --> 01:27:34.070
If you believe there's a chance that the illusion of complexity has done nothing but provide cloud cover for the unbelievable transfer of goodwill

01:27:35.037 --> 01:27:37.798
of well-being and of prosperity from young to old.

01:27:38.558 --> 01:27:52.001
And if you believe we can actually fix these problems and we have the resources, then I present to you, I posit, I augur the question that I hope has more veracity than it did 17 minutes and 24 seconds ago.

01:27:52.621 --> 01:27:54.022
And that's the following question.

01:27:57.303 --> 01:27:58.263
Do we love our children?

01:28:00.403 --> 01:28:02.824
My name is Scott Gallo, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time.

01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:07.402
Thank you.

01:28:08.364 --> 01:28:08.644
Thank you.

01:28:11.027 --> 01:28:13.630
I could give a talk like that, but it would be even better, I think.

01:28:13.911 --> 01:28:15.913
I think it would be even better than that.

01:28:17.535 --> 01:28:20.779
In fact, I think this show is a lot of times even better than that.

01:28:20.899 --> 01:28:21.680
Thanks for being here.

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.122
Let's do it.

01:28:43.354 --> 01:28:45.655
I just wanted to cover a few other things tonight.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:50.217
There was this video that I saw that I at least wanted to play a little bit of because it's just so absurd.

01:28:50.937 --> 01:28:52.018
I know it's the end of the week.

01:28:52.398 --> 01:28:54.238
It's Friday and I'm so happy about it.

01:28:55.779 --> 01:29:03.982
I have been trying to get together a programming idea for the cartoons on Saturday, but tomorrow morning I have to take my son to the gym early.

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:09.645
So if I manage to do the cartoon show tomorrow, which I had planned on doing, but now it's kind of changing.

01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:12.708
Then it will be at noon tomorrow.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:15.652
And the cartoon show will be quite good.

01:29:40.845 --> 01:29:52.293
You know, the funny thing is that a lot of times when I do this on a night shift for some reason, I feel more relaxed in the room.

01:29:52.393 --> 01:29:53.714
It's darker outside.

01:29:53.734 --> 01:29:54.574
I don't know what it is.

01:29:54.594 --> 01:29:55.155
I just feel...

01:29:57.099 --> 01:30:00.340
And maybe it's also just this is wearing off on me a little bit.

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:07.184
The shock of it all, like the contrast to what I used to believe, to what I now see.

01:30:08.044 --> 01:30:17.308
The ease with which I see this performance now has started to finally lend some peace to me because I really do get it.

01:30:17.388 --> 01:30:19.009
I really do think we get it.

01:30:19.069 --> 01:30:23.171
There's only one chance in history to collect this data, so they're doing the best they can.

01:30:24.289 --> 01:30:31.432
trying to build the computers that Joshua said they knew they would need and, you know, telling stories about comets with life on it and stuff.

01:30:31.472 --> 01:30:33.553
It's all one big illusion.

01:30:34.453 --> 01:30:38.435
They thought they'd be so much farther by now, it's just kind of funny.

01:30:40.536 --> 01:30:46.359
So we've had these lively debates about genetics and virology and, you know,

01:30:47.395 --> 01:30:48.996
Ray Kurzweiler is my favorite.

01:30:49.516 --> 01:30:55.619
Spectacular commitment to lies about how 10 years from now we're all going to be uploading our consciousness and living forever.

01:30:55.639 --> 01:31:00.021
And at this stage, we're still at the stage.

01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:11.878
Speaking of uploading our consciousness and living forever, we're still at the stage where these people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland, their job isn't done.

01:31:12.378 --> 01:31:18.463
Del Bigtree, his job isn't done because we still need to teach our children that gain of function is real.

01:31:19.284 --> 01:31:21.205
that the virus might have come from a lab.

01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:29.527
They still need us to pass that on to our children in order for this, you know, one little change in the timeline to have worked.

01:31:29.688 --> 01:31:32.268
And it ain't gonna work if we teach our children the truth.

01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:36.710
So I'm excited because the truth we have.

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:40.891
The question is, can we organize the animals on the farm?

01:31:41.591 --> 01:31:44.072
Can we muster the common sense in our kids?

01:31:45.372 --> 01:31:49.414
Can we teach them what non-compliance means with regard to social media?

01:31:49.454 --> 01:31:51.534
Those are the questions we need to be asking right now.

01:31:51.594 --> 01:31:53.015
The truth is definitely out there.

01:31:53.955 --> 01:31:56.476
And science will win, just not their science.

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.521
We've got to apologize to our children.

01:32:00.541 --> 01:32:07.545
If you're a kid who was sent off to college during the pandemic, then your parents owe you an apology.

01:32:08.205 --> 01:32:16.970
And your university probably owes you some money because they invaded your privacy and sold your medical remnants to the highest bidder.

01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:24.855
And now your genetic data and your medical data is part of a AI program experiment at NIH.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.044
That's every college kid in America that submitted to the testing, probably.

01:32:30.064 --> 01:32:31.926
But certainly most of the big colleges.

01:32:31.966 --> 01:32:35.689
Because these charlatans have been in charge for decades.

01:32:36.249 --> 01:32:38.772
For several mentors now.

01:32:39.572 --> 01:32:47.820
And so these actors are key to understanding how you and maybe your family and friends got trapped by the fake conservative movement.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.760
the fake health freedom movement.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.541
That's the hope that I hope I can bring.

01:32:51.561 --> 01:33:04.904
I hope that as many people as possible will cross paths with GigaOM Biological so that people will learn the biology and the people that should have known better can be held to account because the illusion requires our participation to sustain.

01:33:04.964 --> 01:33:06.905
So if you don't participate, it's not there.

01:33:07.745 --> 01:33:09.505
And you only have to understand the truth.

01:33:09.545 --> 01:33:11.086
You only have to have the right words.

01:33:11.166 --> 01:33:12.906
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:33:12.986 --> 01:33:15.107
Transfection in healthy people was crazy.

01:33:16.307 --> 01:33:17.847
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:33:18.248 --> 01:33:19.328
And, uh, yeah.

01:33:20.188 --> 01:33:22.929
Don't let them make you use their words.

01:33:23.029 --> 01:33:28.070
Don't be pinned down by their vocabulary, or you can never get out.

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:29.250
That's really the trick.

01:33:30.311 --> 01:33:43.294
And that's why I've been working on my elevator pitch for six years, while the rest of these people keep saying anti-mandate and anti-vaccine or anti-adjuvant or anti-autism or... I don't know what.

01:33:43.914 --> 01:33:44.014
Um...

01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:49.516
It's a criminal enterprise, just not in the ways that we've been led to believe.

01:33:49.716 --> 01:33:50.998
And that's the remarkable thing.

01:33:51.078 --> 01:33:53.141
That's the absolutely remarkable thing.

01:33:54.583 --> 01:33:55.645
It is Halloween.

01:33:56.586 --> 01:33:58.269
My goodness, it is Halloween.

01:34:00.074 --> 01:34:18.979
And you're not going to believe it, but Dr. Drew and Aaron Seery, former clerk of the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aaron Seery, former lawyer at Goldman Sachs, you know, the same place where Steve Bannon of U.S.

01:34:19.359 --> 01:34:27.261
Intelligence and Goldman Sachs and Harvey Weinstein Filmmaking Company and I don't know what else.

01:34:29.381 --> 01:34:33.507
These fraudulent Americans are responsible for where we are right now.

01:34:34.448 --> 01:34:35.430
These guys as well.

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.374
Just absolutely monkeys.

01:34:38.674 --> 01:34:40.817
Monkeys of people here.

01:34:41.338 --> 01:34:41.919
It's terrible.

01:34:47.236 --> 01:34:51.139
Aaron Seery joins me, managing partner of Seery and Glimstead.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.846
He has extensive experience in civil litigation and class actions, and we're gonna talk a little about vaccine injuries.

01:34:59.286 --> 01:35:03.730
He has written a book, Vaccines, Amen, the Religion of Vaccines.

01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:04.271
I love it.

01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:08.274
And then we'll talk a little while later to- It's really remarkable, right?

01:35:08.314 --> 01:35:13.639
Here's another book by probably Skyhorse Publishing that's not gonna say it.

01:35:14.716 --> 01:35:16.217
It's not very complicated.

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:19.780
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:26.124
And injecting things can oftentimes cause what is called serum sickness.

01:35:26.745 --> 01:35:32.949
I cannot recommend enough this book called ICD-999 by Patrick Jordan.

01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.092
It has one of the best timelines

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:44.809
that I've ever found with regard to vaccines and disease and stuff.

01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:52.293
It's not to say that there's probably stuff not missing, there's probably stuff missing, but it's the way that he's put together the book.

01:35:52.513 --> 01:36:03.759
It's well written, it's fun, I'm trying to do as much as I can to check things, but I like his arguments, I like his hypothesis, I like

01:36:05.171 --> 01:36:17.428
his ideas because they are completely and 100% interlocking compatible with the idea that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s and one of the consequences of it may be

01:36:19.682 --> 01:36:28.591
what was called Chronic Serum Syndrome back in the old days.

01:36:29.551 --> 01:36:32.374
Anyway, ICD-999 by Patrick Jordan.

01:36:32.634 --> 01:36:33.355
Interesting book.

01:36:33.635 --> 01:36:39.040
Much better than this dumb stuff from this brown man.

01:36:40.402 --> 01:36:44.025
My assumption is that she can't get to be clerk

01:36:45.687 --> 01:36:55.300
My assumption is you can't be clerk of the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court as an American lawyer by applying for that job on Indeed.

01:36:56.839 --> 01:37:00.082
And yet this guy then went on to work for Goldman Sachs.

01:37:00.122 --> 01:37:18.595
You remember the vampire squid that Matt Taibbi was all up in arms about until right at the start of the pandemic when he kind of just forgot about the vampire squid and started to think about alternative candidates for president with Brett Weinstein and Melissa Chen?

01:37:20.214 --> 01:37:23.975
interesting connection to Piper Stover right away then.

01:37:24.215 --> 01:37:33.138
Anyway, Ryan Millsap, the chairman, the CEO of Black Hall Studios, and amongst other things, he was attacked by an organization that I guess doesn't exist.

01:37:33.218 --> 01:37:40.260
It's, it's, he calls it Antifa, but apparently it doesn't exist, but it destroyed a lot of his property, this non-existent group.

01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:43.661
Lots of, I wonder what happened to Dr. Drew's head.

01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:48.163
It looks like he's got a very big laceration or some kind of abrasion on his head.

01:37:48.783 --> 01:37:49.944
I hope he didn't fall down.

01:38:02.535 --> 01:38:06.599
Our laws as it pertain to substances are draconian and bizarre.

01:38:06.639 --> 01:38:07.700
Psychopaths start this.

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:11.504
He was an alcoholic because of social media and pornography, PTSD.

01:38:11.564 --> 01:38:20.292
So he was a relationship expert and he was an addiction expert and he's done a lot of bullshit.

01:38:21.994 --> 01:38:26.136
This is an ultra fraud, an actor, a scripted actor.

01:38:26.677 --> 01:38:36.762
And since he has coordinated a lot of his work with so many of these people on the fake health freedom movement, it's just, it's patently obvious.

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:42.822
This is another Alex Jones.

01:38:42.882 --> 01:38:44.643
It's another ZDoggMD.

01:38:44.743 --> 01:38:46.724
It's another Paul Offit.

01:38:46.884 --> 01:38:49.046
It's another Peter Hotez.

01:38:49.146 --> 01:38:51.327
This is another Mary Holland.

01:38:51.408 --> 01:38:55.350
This is another Sherry Tenpenny or James Lyons-Weiler.

01:38:55.991 --> 01:38:59.493
These are all mid-level midwits.

01:39:00.314 --> 01:39:00.774
Muppets.

01:39:03.696 --> 01:39:04.357
Love addiction.

01:39:04.397 --> 01:39:05.017
Fentanyl and heroin.

01:39:05.037 --> 01:39:05.257
Ridiculous.

01:39:05.297 --> 01:39:05.838
I'm a doctor for f*** sake.

01:39:05.858 --> 01:39:08.680
Where the hell do you think I learned that?

01:39:10.188 --> 01:39:13.009
I'm just saying, you go to treatment before you kill people.

01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:13.930
I am a clinician.

01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:14.870
I observe things.

01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:21.174
Remember that Kim Iverson had a guest on and they were talking about Dr. Drew and they were both saying how hot he was.

01:39:21.234 --> 01:39:21.794
Do you remember?

01:39:21.814 --> 01:39:23.915
That's how stupid this is.

01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:26.389
It's about these chemicals.

01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:27.530
Let's just deal with what's real.

01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:29.751
We used to get these calls on Loveline all the time.

01:39:29.952 --> 01:39:32.313
Educate adolescents and to prevent and to treat.

01:39:32.393 --> 01:39:38.276
Loveline puts him all the way back with Adam Carolla, is that right?

01:39:38.376 --> 01:39:41.378
You have trouble, you can't stop and you want to help stop it, I can help.

01:39:41.698 --> 01:39:43.840
I got a lot to say, I got a lot more to say.

01:39:53.277 --> 01:39:59.803
I've spent most of my career dealing with illnesses that shorten life, and now we have ways to extend it and extend wellness.

01:40:00.223 --> 01:40:05.067
I've been working with the team over at B Shreds to develop a product that has everything I want in a longevity supplement.

01:40:05.247 --> 01:40:07.749
And our boost has nicotinamide riboside.

01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:11.593
You know, the idea that is drdrew.com.

01:40:12.543 --> 01:40:38.894
So yeah, this idea, the idea of the book I love because the fact that a theology has developed around vaccines and public health and infectious disease where there's a canon and the canon is what is accepted and there are authorities on high that determine what the canon is and those who step outside are sinners and need to be burned at the stake and on and on and on.

01:40:39.514 --> 01:40:44.346
But, uh, I'm guess, did you imagine in 2019 you'd be writing a book like that?

01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:46.150
No.

01:40:47.188 --> 01:40:51.992
I did not imagine I would ever write a book like that when I started my career 20 years ago or even 10 years ago.

01:40:52.012 --> 01:41:02.521
Um, I would say, um, 10 years ago was the start of ICANN and when vaxxed was released right on April 1st, 2016.

01:41:03.742 --> 01:41:13.290
So he's kind of exaggerating here and I can't stress enough how Aaron Siri is one of the most fraudulent and shittiest Americans alive.

01:41:15.998 --> 01:41:22.904
It slowly started over the last 10 years, you know, reaching a crescendo about three to four years ago, I was like, you know what, it's time to write this book.

01:41:23.484 --> 01:41:30.791
You know, I spent a decade litigating against federal health agencies, opposing some of the world's leading vaccinologists, including the world's leading vaccinologist.

01:41:30.831 --> 01:41:35.615
He's been using an administrative court that pays him whether he wins or loses.

01:41:36.716 --> 01:41:42.641
The only place in the American legal system where a lawyer can get paid if he loses.

01:41:43.911 --> 01:41:48.654
where all the fees are paid by the taxpayer, whether they win or whether they lose.

01:41:49.274 --> 01:41:51.615
So he's not your average lawyer.

01:41:51.695 --> 01:42:00.940
He's actually one of the lowest kind of scumbag lawyers that there could possibly be for that simple reason alone.

01:42:03.942 --> 01:42:07.104
And what I found along that journey is that there's what they tell the public.

01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:13.320
And then there's what they say under oath when they're in a deposition, when they're forced to say the truth on the stand.

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:23.628
And then most critically, when you pin them to have to provide the proof for some statements that they make and they can't provide it or what they provide clearly doesn't support it.

01:42:23.869 --> 01:42:27.972
It's almost like that 60 minutes episode with, with Alex Karp.

01:42:28.072 --> 01:42:29.894
They're not saying anything.

01:42:31.095 --> 01:42:33.617
They're not saying anything.

01:42:36.172 --> 01:42:40.495
And so along that journey, I've come to realize most of what they say about vaccines is dogma beliefs.

01:42:40.555 --> 01:42:42.917
And I wanted to document it in the book at some point, yeah.

01:42:43.698 --> 01:42:48.221
Most of what they say about vaccines is dogma and beliefs.

01:42:48.382 --> 01:42:49.362
What does that mean?

01:42:49.402 --> 01:42:51.664
Does it mean that it's real or not real?

01:42:51.764 --> 01:42:53.626
What do they say about vaccines?

01:42:54.406 --> 01:43:04.854
How is it possible that some guy in his garage in Pittsburgh is able to put up a single slide that says the following things, covering vaccines,

01:43:05.768 --> 01:43:18.857
covering chronic disease, covering COVID, and covering virology, and covering pandemics, and covering transfection, all in less than 25 words.

01:43:19.257 --> 01:43:20.438
How is that possible?

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.361
Intramuscular injections, a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:43:25.462 --> 01:43:26.602
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:43:26.642 --> 01:43:28.904
Transfection in healthy humans was crazy.

01:43:29.544 --> 01:43:32.947
And a biological male can only ever be a trans man.

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:34.080
I'm done.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:35.460
I'm done.

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.521
I don't need to write a book.

01:43:40.882 --> 01:43:52.624
And none of these people in the fake anti-vax movement should need more than 15 seconds to tell you what they believe if they believe the vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

01:43:53.124 --> 01:43:55.285
But funny enough, they never say it.

01:43:59.006 --> 01:44:00.086
They just say stuff.

01:44:03.502 --> 01:44:05.804
And so what has happened to my profession?

01:44:06.064 --> 01:44:06.664
What is that?

01:44:06.764 --> 01:44:09.507
Is it academia running amok?

01:44:09.627 --> 01:44:11.308
Is it a centralized authority?

01:44:11.408 --> 01:44:21.956
I kind of feel like there's a philosophy that has captured public health that is, well, first of all, wrong.

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:26.539
But secondly, if you dare step outside of it, you want to harm people.

01:44:26.619 --> 01:44:29.341
You are vilified for wishing harm on others.

01:44:32.003 --> 01:44:32.203
I mean,

01:44:33.482 --> 01:44:40.046
I will say vaccines are unique, meaning I wouldn't, I think that, you know, large parts of the medical profession do wonderful things.

01:44:40.066 --> 01:44:48.052
You know, you get into a car accident, you break some bones, you go to the emergency room, you're going to get treated, you know, and, and you probably deserve a lot of praise for those doctors.

01:44:48.772 --> 01:44:58.419
I think vaccines fall into a very unique space just because of, um, how the, the law and the policy and the money has started to flow.

01:44:58.439 --> 01:45:02.101
Aaron is a lion said that comment.

01:45:02.261 --> 01:45:02.982
Come on.

01:45:03.802 --> 01:45:04.844
Only from India.

01:45:05.244 --> 01:45:22.505
He's a lion if he's from India and he's lying like like likes lying That kind of lying in the that area that What happened there, okay, sorry

01:45:23.069 --> 01:45:26.591
vaccines versus all of other medicine.

01:45:26.711 --> 01:45:35.356
For every other medical product, whether it's drugs, med devices, you can hold the manufacturer accountable for the injuries caused by that product.

01:45:35.816 --> 01:45:40.398
What that means is that before it goes to market, they want to properly trial it.

01:45:40.859 --> 01:45:45.981
Then afterwards, they want to ensure it's safe because they want to not end up upside down.

01:45:46.382 --> 01:45:48.643
On the other hand, vaccines are the only product

01:45:49.103 --> 01:46:05.688
that have an immunity granted in 1986 under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act that makes it so that no matter how much harm it causes to a child, even if it kills a child, you cannot sue the company to say, the pharma company to say, had you made that product safer, my kid wouldn't have died.

01:46:06.128 --> 01:46:07.069
My kid would have been injured.

01:46:07.549 --> 01:46:16.672
And so you've had 40 years of just uncontested reign by pharmaceutical companies being able to influence the medical profession and to, you know,

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.429
I guess, various incantations.

01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:23.272
They are robustly trialed before they go on the market.

01:46:23.312 --> 01:46:27.555
Well, I lay out in Chapter 10 every single trial for every single trial of the vaccine.

01:46:27.575 --> 01:46:28.136
I make it fun.

01:46:28.156 --> 01:46:30.357
And you see, that's just not true.

01:46:30.557 --> 01:46:31.398
That's just dogma.

01:46:32.938 --> 01:46:35.519
or there's robust safety after licensure.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.821
I go through that through IOM reports and so forth in chapter 11.

01:46:40.002 --> 01:46:41.923
And then they all stop transmission.

01:46:42.183 --> 01:46:42.523
Not true.

01:46:42.843 --> 01:46:44.684
Everybody would die without them in America.

01:46:44.724 --> 01:46:46.986
Millions died before there was a vaccines in America.

01:46:47.486 --> 01:46:49.587
I go through all of those hyperbolic claims.

01:46:49.927 --> 01:46:51.868
That's not to say that vaccines don't have any benefit.

01:46:52.269 --> 01:46:54.750
Obviously, measles vaccine, for example, can prevent transmission.

01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:58.192
Hence, it can eliminate measles, which obviously would then reduce death.

01:46:58.652 --> 01:46:59.753
But that's not the end of the story.

01:46:59.793 --> 01:47:03.717
You got to look at the bigger picture if you really want to do public health right.

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:20.932
And so until we actually stop, you know, the medical profession stops repeating dogmatic claims about these products and starts actually thinking rather than believing in these products, we're not going to really be able to do public health well when it comes to vaccines.

01:47:22.418 --> 01:47:37.442
Well, and the other thing- There's one of the examples of how showing the shot change in America is not as impressive as showing the difference between America and other countries.

01:47:37.862 --> 01:47:47.624
If Paul Offit will say that you can give a kid 10,000 antigens at once and it wouldn't hurt him, and he doesn't care if you get all these vaccines at once or not, and then what?

01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:57.252
What you need to compare is 2025 America to 2025 Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands.

01:47:59.052 --> 01:48:01.373
And also compare the culture around it.

01:48:01.413 --> 01:48:03.414
You know, how do the doctors do it?

01:48:03.494 --> 01:48:04.774
How do the nurses do it?

01:48:05.274 --> 01:48:07.435
How enforced is it?

01:48:09.735 --> 01:48:13.577
Just look at how many countries give a hep B shot and a vitamin K shot at birth.

01:48:13.637 --> 01:48:14.157
Just look.

01:48:14.897 --> 01:48:15.937
They're not doing that.

01:48:16.317 --> 01:48:17.698
They're not doing that.

01:48:20.677 --> 01:48:23.445
And when they do it, they don't do it like an elevator pitch.

01:48:23.505 --> 01:48:27.677
You know, they don't have a priority list of ways to bring people to this message.

01:48:29.411 --> 01:48:35.216
It's always about my 25 years and I've been working for a long time and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:48:35.256 --> 01:48:39.219
And it's always just been kind of sort of important to me, but not that important.

01:48:39.239 --> 01:48:40.420
It's all blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:45.845
They're not taking it seriously as they should if they believed what they said they believed.

01:48:46.545 --> 01:48:47.566
It's just stupid.

01:48:48.667 --> 01:48:50.168
Him and his fancy suits.

01:48:50.729 --> 01:48:54.592
He is just as fraudulent as Steve Bannon.

01:48:54.632 --> 01:48:57.635
He might as well, I mean, it's just a different suit.

01:48:59.144 --> 01:49:00.785
Gosh, this guy's a slime ball.

01:49:00.885 --> 01:49:09.692
That we heard Francis Collins say out loud is they gave no consideration to the negative impact of the decisions they were making.

01:49:09.912 --> 01:49:24.162
The other thing that this guy never mentions is that the PrEP Act could be struck as unconstitutional because it violates, it violates, it doesn't allow the government to be held to strict scrutiny when taking away a fundamental right.

01:49:26.001 --> 01:49:31.343
The government is not allowed to suspend fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny.

01:49:31.383 --> 01:49:39.866
There should be a preconceived set of conditions that need to be met before the government can just screw you over for a little while.

01:49:41.178 --> 01:49:50.784
And yet somehow or another right now, the legal situation we're in is that the health and human services secretary, the fraud and Truman show victim, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:50.864 --> 01:49:55.947
can declare an emergency basis based on the rational basis test alone.

01:49:55.987 --> 01:49:57.888
He's just got to think it's a pretty good idea.

01:49:57.908 --> 01:50:04.612
He's got to have a hunch, you know, just got to be able to explain some reason why he thinks there might be an emergency.

01:50:05.092 --> 01:50:10.115
And then he can suspend fundamental rights, like all kinds of rights.

01:50:11.598 --> 01:50:13.098
And we don't have anything to say about it.

01:50:14.499 --> 01:50:21.381
And Aaron Siri doesn't think that the prep act being constitutionally challenged in that way is actually a good way to go.

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:24.541
He doesn't think it's the right time or something, something, something.

01:50:25.102 --> 01:50:29.083
I know because he presented to the medical doctors for COVID ethics once.

01:50:29.143 --> 01:50:31.343
And I waited until the end of his presentation.

01:50:31.783 --> 01:50:34.524
And then I asked him the question and he answered.

01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:46.139
He said he didn't think it was the right time or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:58.109
Just like the doctor, sorry, the lawyer for Grace Shara when he was in the Bronstone Institute presentation here in November of 2024.

01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:05.256
And I spoke to him about strict scrutiny and striking the PrEP Act and all this other stuff, you know, legal stuff, he was just,

01:51:05.896 --> 01:51:32.409
spellbound just as spellbound as bobby ann cox when i was like why isn't anybody trying to take this to federal court get a federal judge to say i can't allow you to sue because of the prep act and then have that judge or that person challenge that on the basis of it being unconstitutional because i have a constitutional right to sue for any damages over twenty dollars and that's a fundamental constitutional right you can't just suspend on a whim

01:51:33.129 --> 01:51:39.074
You need to hold the government to strict scrutiny before you suspend my fundamental rights.

01:51:41.596 --> 01:51:43.798
And none of these lawyers will talk about that.

01:51:45.339 --> 01:51:46.721
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:51:50.444 --> 01:51:51.325
Mary Holland?

01:51:54.667 --> 01:51:57.610
Ray Flores, another big lawyer at CHD.

01:52:00.962 --> 01:52:01.762
Aaron Seery.

01:52:02.602 --> 01:52:03.923
Stop lying!

01:52:07.604 --> 01:52:14.225
That fraud clerked for the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court.

01:52:15.366 --> 01:52:20.287
That fraud worked for the vampire squid Goldman Sachs.

01:52:23.888 --> 01:52:28.849
He can't possibly be anything but a scripted national security actor.

01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:33.011
a traitor to our grandchildren, a fraud of the highest order.

01:52:33.711 --> 01:52:36.352
Aaron Siri's one of the shittiest Americans alive.

01:52:36.812 --> 01:52:39.913
That was the most astonishing statement I've heard in my entire career.

01:52:40.794 --> 01:52:42.574
It is just, you know, we just stopped the virus.

01:52:42.614 --> 01:52:45.455
We didn't care what we did along the way.

01:52:45.575 --> 01:52:46.996
It's like, oh my God.

01:52:47.696 --> 01:52:51.377
So let's flip over to that fiasco, the COVID fiasco.

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.018
And let me pause at something.

01:52:53.998 --> 01:52:55.018
Let's just pause it.

01:52:55.038 --> 01:52:56.799
And you tell me if this is a reasonable thing to pause it.

01:52:59.559 --> 01:53:01.080
2019, 2020, it's an emergency.

01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:03.242
It's a different illness than we have now.

01:53:03.682 --> 01:53:05.344
It's bad in some situations.

01:53:05.924 --> 01:53:08.066
It's 1%, 2% fatality rate.

01:53:08.106 --> 01:53:09.087
We can argue about what.

01:53:09.507 --> 01:53:11.709
But out of hundreds of millions of people, it's a lot of people.

01:53:12.769 --> 01:53:13.970
Great risk is taken.

01:53:14.431 --> 01:53:17.113
Far less safety measures are put into consideration.

01:53:17.853 --> 01:53:23.578
They don't have the data to support what they claim, but they bring it out to try to stop this beast.

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:26.331
Let's just say that's true.

01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:29.113
I may be telling a complete fantasy, but let's say that's true.

01:53:30.374 --> 01:53:38.460
Why did they continue to mandate this same vaccine after it became clear that the threat was long gone?

01:53:39.061 --> 01:53:40.742
That's the part I can't reconcile.

01:53:41.242 --> 01:53:51.991
And not only did they continue to mandate the vaccine, but we knew well by that point that the vaccine was producing the pathogenic protein of the virus, the part that makes people sick.

01:53:52.932 --> 01:53:54.473
And why didn't we change course?

01:53:54.713 --> 01:53:56.474
Is it strictly that government can't?

01:53:57.194 --> 01:54:00.616
Or is it strictly that you... This is tales from the script, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:01.356 --> 01:54:03.117
These two men are full of script.

01:54:07.039 --> 01:54:08.640
That's why they're talking like they are.

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:15.263
That's why he had to rehash the novel virus, the shitty response, the low death rate.

01:54:16.044 --> 01:54:19.986
And that's why that guy sits there with that stupid smirk on his face.

01:54:20.899 --> 01:54:25.349
Because he's not losing, he's playing the role he's supposed to play.

01:54:25.409 --> 01:54:28.877
He's just in Act 4 of Scene 2 of whatever.

01:54:30.031 --> 01:54:33.494
He's not worried that this might be the last time he gets on TV.

01:54:33.954 --> 01:54:40.220
He's not worried that kids are not being saved or we're still not able to save the vaccine schedule.

01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:44.103
He's not even that worried that the MRNA shot's still available.

01:54:44.443 --> 01:54:52.370
He's just laying back and relaxing because he's still just on script exactly like Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and

01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:58.051
Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker and Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:58.111 --> 01:54:59.571
all plan to be on script.

01:55:00.011 --> 01:55:03.852
Like Tony Lyons and all of them plan to be on script right now.

01:55:06.332 --> 01:55:15.774
And they think they're just gonna ride off into the sunset and go home to their big ranches and their big houses and their big mansions and everything's gonna be fine.

01:55:15.814 --> 01:55:17.274
And that's not the way it's gonna be.

01:55:18.555 --> 01:55:20.715
These criminals are gonna go to jail or worse.

01:55:21.852 --> 01:55:27.653
They're going to live the rest of their life in fraud and in scorn and in shame.

01:55:29.974 --> 01:55:32.854
Or I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to make that happen.

01:55:34.395 --> 01:55:37.375
Because Dr. Drew is just an actor.

01:55:38.495 --> 01:55:40.676
Dr. Drew would play any part he was given.

01:55:41.436 --> 01:55:46.757
But Aaron Seery is a calculated, chosen shithead.

01:55:49.218 --> 01:55:50.478
He's like a made man.

01:55:51.587 --> 01:55:56.532
He's like Robert Malone is a made man, like Kevin McKernan is a made man.

01:55:56.652 --> 01:55:58.193
These other people aren't made men.

01:55:58.654 --> 01:56:00.135
That is a made man.

01:56:00.816 --> 01:56:05.801
That is one of the most treacherous, most fraudulent Americans alive.

01:56:06.201 --> 01:56:09.965
Aaron Siri is a gigantic piece of shit.

01:56:11.306 --> 01:56:15.190
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry that it's so dark today on, uh,

01:56:16.616 --> 01:56:17.296
on Halloween.

01:56:17.336 --> 01:56:36.486
I'm sorry that I'm so negative, but it's the end of Rocktober and Nathan should be here for Rocktober, Annie should be here for Rocktober, Kay should be here for Rocktober, and my son should be having a lot more fun at Matthew Crooks' high school than he is.

01:56:37.106 --> 01:56:41.829
But Matthew Crooks' high school has completely pretended that Matthew Crooks never existed.

01:56:42.389 --> 01:56:47.311
that he didn't live in our neighborhood, didn't live in our community, didn't go to our high school.

01:56:47.791 --> 01:56:57.035
And so our high school still just pretends that social media is just something we have to be careful of and we don't need to have any particular concern about it or whatever.

01:56:57.095 --> 01:57:00.397
Just put your phone in that little pocket and everything will be okay.

01:57:01.789 --> 01:57:05.914
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a message for everyone, but it is a message for anyone.

01:57:06.254 --> 01:57:08.357
We need to get our kids off of social media.

01:57:08.377 --> 01:57:12.041
We need to get ourselves off of social media, because this is for all the marbles.

01:57:12.102 --> 01:57:13.503
It's for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:57:13.623 --> 01:57:18.850
The children of the Earth need to know the truth in order for the grandchildren of Earth to be saved.

01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:22.334
And that means the adults on earth need to wake up.

01:57:22.874 --> 01:57:35.968
They need to admit that they were fooled by a lab leak mystery, by a fake health freedom movement, and by a fake populist conservative movement, all of which only exist, only exist on social media.

01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:38.751
That's reality, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:38.771 --> 01:57:39.572
Thanks for being here.

01:57:41.696 --> 01:57:56.426
Let's just say I'm going to try really hard to do the cartoon show after basketball tomorrow and since basketball is scheduled for 9.15 that in theory the cartoon show could start at 11.

01:57:56.946 --> 01:58:01.570
It will never always start at 11 because cartoons should start early in the morning.

01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:12.366
but tomorrow it may need to start early and then there will be a cartoon and a little bit of biology and then cartoon and a little bit of you know happy video and then a cartoon and then probably that's it.

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:18.162
I have lots of cartoons, but I can't do like, you know, six hours or something like that.

01:58:18.182 --> 01:58:26.766
But we'll do at least Extreme Dinosaurs and Dungeons and Dragons and Scooby-Doo to start tomorrow.

01:58:27.107 --> 01:58:32.889
And then also two other things in between, kind of like public service announcement type things.

01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:34.930
I don't know what to say other than

01:58:36.581 --> 01:58:37.543
We're just getting started.

01:58:38.305 --> 01:58:42.614
Thanks for being here, and see you again tomorrow, I guess.

01:58:42.654 --> 01:58:43.716
Yeah, I think so.

01:58:43.897 --> 01:58:44.518
Yeah, tomorrow.

01:58:44.839 --> 01:58:45.761
Tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow.

01:59:21.017 --> 01:59:21.057
So,

02:00:02.177 --> 02:00:04.599
I like that everybody likes the nighttime schedule.

02:00:04.699 --> 02:00:06.840
It's very hard for me to do a nighttime schedule.

02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:08.401
I'm gonna be a wreck tomorrow morning.

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:10.622
Thank you very much for being here, though.

02:00:10.662 --> 02:00:11.723
Happy Halloween.

02:00:13.884 --> 02:00:15.285
Rest in peace, Annie Wershing.

02:00:15.965 --> 02:00:16.966
We still remember you.

02:00:17.366 --> 02:00:18.887
We definitely still remember you.

02:00:20.108 --> 02:00:20.908
Be good, everybody.

02:00:20.928 --> 02:00:21.349
See you tomorrow.
