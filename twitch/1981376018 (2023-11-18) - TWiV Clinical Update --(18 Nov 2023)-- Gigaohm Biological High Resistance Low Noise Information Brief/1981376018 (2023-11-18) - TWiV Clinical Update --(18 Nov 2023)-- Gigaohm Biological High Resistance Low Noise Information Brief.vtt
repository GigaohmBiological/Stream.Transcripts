00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:49.000
know, I'm going to try and make it a quickie, but you know how that always goes. Sorry about that, guys.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
For the unvaccinated, you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
For yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
For the unvaccinated, you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
For yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
For the unvaccinated, you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
For yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
For the unvaccinated, you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
For yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.

01:43.000 --> 02:02.640
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to GIGO and Biological, where we're learning

02:02.640 --> 02:10.160
biology right now, and trusting the science, right, seems legit.

02:10.160 --> 02:15.600
These aren't new graphics, actually, these are graphics from 2021, surprise, surprise.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.720
We've been so hip that what looks like new graphics are actually almost three years old

02:20.720 --> 02:23.440
now, well, two years old.

02:23.440 --> 02:28.560
We got Galileo flying in from the left and GIGO and biological from the upper right.

02:28.560 --> 02:38.760
We got Big Bird, this is 2021, baby.

02:38.760 --> 02:45.800
Wow Chief, or Christmas, you know, action figures with real masks so you can, I mean,

02:45.800 --> 02:50.560
once they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities, has that

02:50.560 --> 02:57.880
ever been said before that just seems crazy to me.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.440
Look at these old slides still looking right.

03:03.440 --> 03:10.320
I mean, are you kidding, at the heart of this are people who have convinced us to

03:10.320 --> 03:13.520
fight each other instead of fighting them.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.480
Who makes this stuff?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.240
Wow, that must have been some...

03:17.240 --> 03:22.800
Look at these slides, I mean, seriously.

03:22.800 --> 03:36.040
Oh, there's a new one, I stuck a new one in there, look at that shout-out, do you remember

03:36.040 --> 03:37.040
when I did that?

03:37.040 --> 03:43.440
Did you know that I was already shouting out the real shout-out, covering my eyes, that

03:43.440 --> 03:52.640
raccoon, that rascally raccoon, but we are doing just fine now.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.000
If you go in biological, the high resistance, low noise information brief, the only one

03:58.000 --> 04:06.800
on the internet, the illusion requires your participation to sustain, thank you very much

04:06.800 --> 04:15.440
to that person on the right there, my best friend and wife, thank you Fairlucks.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.720
If you have been following me for a while, you're here at the top of the wave, and if

04:18.720 --> 04:23.320
you're a skilled TV watcher, well, here's your life raft, here's your life preserver,

04:23.320 --> 04:26.920
your lifeguards are on duty.

04:26.920 --> 04:33.240
The Baywatch Biology, Gigal Biological, holy cow, where'd that come from?

04:33.240 --> 04:39.880
The Baywatch Biology, I'm gonna get some shit for that one.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.960
So this is how it works.

04:41.960 --> 04:48.640
I've been financially supported for a couple of years by my supporters, now I'm working

04:48.640 --> 04:56.360
full-time for children's health defense, I was about to say Chicago's health defense,

04:56.360 --> 05:02.120
I don't know what that was all about, children's health defense.

05:02.120 --> 05:09.680
And I still actually am partially supported by subscribers and donations, because I do

05:09.680 --> 05:11.800
put a lot of work into these evenings.

05:11.800 --> 05:18.440
I am a real life biologist you could find with Google, under the name Jonathan J. Cooley,

05:18.440 --> 05:24.120
I'm not hiding, I've had my full, full identity on the internet for quite some time,

05:24.120 --> 05:27.520
not hiding behind anything.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.000
Lovely to see you all again as well.

05:30.000 --> 05:39.160
43 viewers, that was my high school basketball number, the best number is 43.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.640
That's pretty funny.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.560
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigal and Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.160
brought to you by a biologist.

05:46.160 --> 05:57.520
It's the 18th of November, 2023, and we are still trying to break down the narrative

05:57.520 --> 05:59.600
that we've been dealt.

05:59.600 --> 06:07.360
Look at this slide from 2021 with the nice card, it's almost like an old game show from

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
the 80s.

06:08.360 --> 06:15.760
Our common narrative was the biological bifurcation of America, maybe of Earth.

06:15.840 --> 06:23.880
We talked a lot about this, we talked about the life before social media and how our brains

06:23.880 --> 06:27.400
were pretty much oriented around our family, and there was a common narrative that was

06:27.400 --> 06:33.800
not only in our house on the wall there, you see, but it was also not only on the wall

06:33.800 --> 06:37.720
there, you see, but it was also on the television.

06:37.720 --> 06:45.080
And then at some point in the pandemic, these people started to become a little disgruntled

06:45.080 --> 06:52.360
with what was on TV because nothing that they believed in was on TV anymore.

06:52.360 --> 06:57.840
And the kids, the young people that have grown up with modern TV and social media, you know,

06:57.840 --> 07:04.000
I grew up in a time when you had to get up and push buttons on the TV and then there

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
was this remote that made clicking noises.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.440
We didn't upgrade a lot, most people who had televisions didn't upgrade a lot.

07:13.480 --> 07:19.600
I can remember that my godmother and father, their basement had a television with three

07:19.600 --> 07:22.120
giant light colors coming out of the front.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.000
You couldn't walk between the television projector and the screen, or there would be

07:27.000 --> 07:34.280
this three colored, anyway, long story short, we grew up in a different time.

07:34.280 --> 07:41.240
And now our common narrative is almost lost in this noise of social media and instant

07:41.240 --> 07:47.280
access from work and instant access from our friends and all this media at our fingertips

07:47.280 --> 07:53.920
that allows us to become fractionated and distracted from one another, even in our own homes.

07:53.920 --> 08:01.760
And so as this has progressed, people have become almost programmed, chosen, choosing

08:01.760 --> 08:06.960
places on the internet to hide that feel safe, choosing places in this imaginary network

08:06.960 --> 08:10.160
to hide where it feels safe.

08:10.160 --> 08:14.680
And so at the start of the pandemic, I've often posited that there were basically four

08:14.680 --> 08:19.720
kinds of people, people that could see that really, they've picked some kind of independent

08:19.720 --> 08:24.880
position, but it was really a false one, a blue position, but it's a false one, a red

08:24.880 --> 08:28.520
one, it's a false one, or you just know that all the positions are false and you're just

08:28.520 --> 08:30.280
angry.

08:30.280 --> 08:36.080
But these four people are the basis for where we are right now.

08:37.080 --> 08:43.240
And this is the fractionization that now we're supposed to choose sides about after

08:43.240 --> 08:47.320
our common narrative has been destroyed, we're supposed to choose sides about this biological

08:47.320 --> 08:50.000
scooby-doo, this trap.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.720
And if you don't understand this trap, then you're never going to get out.

08:52.720 --> 08:57.000
You've got to understand why the cheese has been free for three years.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.240
And I think that's, it's a really apt thing to talk about, you know, not to bring up,

09:03.240 --> 09:07.400
you know, fancy quotes and everything, but Mark Twain is a very smart fella.

09:07.400 --> 09:13.040
And he, he pointed out that, you know, it's easier to fool someone than it is to convince

09:13.040 --> 09:15.960
someone that they have been fooled.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.440
And so that's the task ahead of us.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.240
We have to convince our family and friends that we were fooled to answer the question,

09:22.240 --> 09:25.880
was it natural or was it a lab leak?

09:25.880 --> 09:29.240
And that's really, that's really something special.

09:29.240 --> 09:35.360
Like you really got a, got a task at your hand if you're, if you're going to try to

09:35.360 --> 09:40.360
tell them that the last three years was largely a performance.

09:40.360 --> 09:44.400
But you've got even more cards to play because you can remind them that we were told from

09:44.400 --> 09:49.920
the very, very beginning of the pandemic before the vaccine was even close to out.

09:49.920 --> 09:55.120
We were already being told that other vaccines, old vaccines are obviously safe and effective.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.280
This is how we got rid of diseases for our entire modern history.

10:00.280 --> 10:06.600
And so we should expect a new vaccine for this novel virus that may have come from a lab,

10:06.600 --> 10:10.720
but probably it's a natural virus either way.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.320
I mean, that, that was the, that was the narrative, right?

10:13.320 --> 10:16.840
I mean, that, that's the whole idea behind this.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.000
Wait, what's going on here?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Wait.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh yeah, I had to do this.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I can do that.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
There we go.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I'm sorry.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
But anyway, that was the narrative.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.120
I believe it's much more likely that it's a lab leak.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.520
And so this bifurcation of Earth continued with transfection is better than infection

10:36.520 --> 10:39.360
because the viral spike is toxic.

10:39.360 --> 10:45.200
I bet you can't even remember that these, this, this was actually a talking point.

10:45.200 --> 10:51.320
Transfection is better than infection because the viral spike is toxic.

10:51.320 --> 10:56.840
That was a real talking point for almost four or five months in 2021.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.960
And so this bifurcation just keeps continuing.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.080
Every card is new and now we're all the way up to the DNA is in the transfections, but

11:04.080 --> 11:09.240
otherwise they were perfect.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.080
And of course that's what I'm calling this, that's what I'm calling the Scooby Doo.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.000
Am I, am I able to put myself here?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Oh yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Sorry.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Hi.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Good evening.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Welcome to the show.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm Cuyin.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.800
I'm coming at you from Pittsburgh.

11:23.800 --> 11:30.920
This illusion of consensus about a laboratory leak, a novel virus, the millions killed and

11:30.920 --> 11:34.880
millions more were saved from the gain of function is probably real and maybe even the source

11:34.880 --> 11:39.960
of this virus and that means that a virus will come again is what Rand Paul and everyone

11:39.960 --> 11:44.040
has been trying to sustain for, for many, many years now.

11:44.040 --> 11:51.880
It was laid from very early on and you can't underestimate how little of what we thought

11:51.880 --> 11:59.560
was a legitimate experience was actually a theater and the deeper you dig, the harder

11:59.560 --> 12:09.320
you push, the more you realize that surrounding a central core that I like to term the independent

12:09.320 --> 12:16.040
bright web is surrounded by what is effectively an expanded intellectual dark web.

12:16.040 --> 12:21.240
And that expanded intellectual dark web is keeping alive this, this faith in a novel

12:21.240 --> 12:25.040
virus, this faith that millions of people were killed by it, this faith that millions

12:25.040 --> 12:27.640
more were saved from it.

12:27.640 --> 12:32.480
The idea that gain of function might be a general, the general source of it.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.280
And therefore a virus will come again.

12:34.280 --> 12:41.000
This intellectual dark web that surrounds the inner independent bright web is basically

12:41.000 --> 12:44.080
what the battle ground were on.

12:44.080 --> 12:49.000
And so we need to start to organize this independent bright web against this intellectual dark

12:49.000 --> 12:55.960
web and we need to do it now before censorship and digital ideas used to effectively close

12:55.960 --> 13:00.720
these gaps with no mistake, with no escape.

13:00.720 --> 13:06.080
And so I've been trying to use this Scooby-Doo analogy for you and our viewers and people

13:06.080 --> 13:11.360
that are following GigaOM for the first time to catch up as fast as possible because we

13:11.360 --> 13:16.040
have been led to believe that there is a mystery to solve and that we have solved it by catching

13:16.040 --> 13:24.080
them in their lies, by seeing these as bioweapons and that they covered it up in Wuhan or that

13:24.080 --> 13:27.280
the US government lies to us.

13:27.280 --> 13:33.880
And of course they even argued and a senator can write about the argument and soon a presidential

13:33.880 --> 13:35.480
candidate is going to release a book.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.680
That book's in my hand right now.

13:39.680 --> 13:46.720
And this narrative is what they have sustained over the last three years to prevent us from

13:46.720 --> 13:52.720
asking the right questions about where these things originate, how they originate.

13:52.720 --> 13:58.480
This whole thing is an illusion of consensus about a worst-case scenario, biological,

13:58.480 --> 14:03.000
laboratory, bioweapon.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.720
I apologize, this is probably too much motion here.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.920
We don't need that tunnel analogy too much more.

14:10.920 --> 14:15.760
I think it's starting to struggle with the memory there.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.160
But the tunnel analogy is very good because it is an illusion, even that picture that

14:20.160 --> 14:24.520
was moving there, it looks like you're moving through a tunnel, but it's an illusion and

14:24.520 --> 14:29.640
that's really what they've done to us with regard to the pandemic, not only by locking

14:29.640 --> 14:34.600
us down and forcing us to interpret the world through our phones and screens, but more importantly

14:34.600 --> 14:40.240
locking us down with an illusion of consensus with even people that we thought were independent

14:40.240 --> 14:43.240
actors.

14:43.240 --> 14:48.480
And we have been in this glass cube just looking out thinking that we are somehow interacting

14:48.480 --> 14:53.640
with the real world or that these people or that these people are interacting with

14:53.640 --> 14:57.280
that real world on our behalf.

14:57.280 --> 15:02.200
And that's really where the trap lies, that we think because somebody like Robert Malone

15:02.200 --> 15:07.480
is fighting for his intellectual property and our rights, that why in the world would

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
we have to do anything?

15:08.480 --> 15:15.160
I mean, that's a dude on a white horse literally, and that is the new world order that they've

15:15.160 --> 15:16.160
cast us in.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.000
And that's what I want you to see just a glimpse of here before I go to bed.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I watch this video.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I don't know when I'm going to have time to do it again because tomorrow I'm presenting

15:24.000 --> 15:26.040
to the UK doctors.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.000
And then Monday I have two interviews in a row.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.600
I have Jay Bhattacharya and then Peter McCullough, so it's going to be a busy day on Monday.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.560
And so I'm not going to stay up very late tonight, but I just wanted to show you this

15:37.560 --> 15:41.480
video because it's really extraordinary the kinds of things that they said on this clinical

15:41.480 --> 15:42.720
update today.

15:42.720 --> 15:53.240
So I'm going to escape out of here, I'm going to bring this up and scoot it over here and

15:53.240 --> 15:56.640
then pop this out and away we go.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.000
Oh, that's not there.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.920
Pop this out and away we go.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.160
Do I need to do a control Z here?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.160
No, I don't think so.

16:06.160 --> 16:16.280
The podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick from micro TV.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.040
This is I'm going to have to stop it really quick because they go a million miles a minute

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
with this crash.

16:21.040 --> 16:27.200
It's a real crash course in September 16th, 2020, idolatry and everything else and you're

16:27.200 --> 16:30.240
listening to the podcast all about viruses.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.240
You're not going to believe it.

16:31.240 --> 16:36.160
Joining me today here at the incubator in New York City, Daniel Griffin.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.560
Hello, everyone.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
Okay.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.120
So first of all, keep in mind what he just said there.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.720
This is at the incubator.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.120
This is their studio.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.040
The studio is in Manhattan.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.120
It is funded.

16:47.120 --> 16:51.080
It has people that work for it.

16:51.080 --> 16:56.400
It is a fully funded 501c3 or whatever that is.

16:56.400 --> 17:02.240
That's a major thing to understand here because this is also faculty members.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.800
They are taking charitable donations from everything from pharmaceutical corporations

17:06.800 --> 17:09.840
to large donors, et cetera.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.960
So the conflicts of interest here, although they might not now be on paper very big, the

17:14.960 --> 17:21.000
potential for conflicts of interest here are almost infinite.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.880
The incubator and their best solution is these chairs, that background and laptops

17:29.880 --> 17:36.160
on their lap, like impressive, I can't wait until the first glass of water is spilled

17:36.160 --> 17:37.160
on the laptop.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.800
Yeah, it's nice to be spending some time.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.600
After this, we're going to go to the Dixon de Pumier book signings.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
That's very exciting.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.800
Dixon should be in his element, right?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.240
He will be in his element.

17:47.240 --> 17:51.560
If you recall, Dixon is the guy who completely blew them out of the water, blew them out

17:51.560 --> 17:56.680
of the water the other day during that interview, it was really spectacular how he just simply

17:56.680 --> 18:02.280
was incredulous with their discussion of the HPV vaccine modeling paper.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.960
It was a really good one to watch.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.600
If he hadn't missed it, it's a couple of days ago.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.760
What's on your tie today, Daniel?

18:08.760 --> 18:14.720
This is a virus, notice a nice symmetry, almost like a corona of spikes around the outside

18:14.720 --> 18:15.720
there.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
The coronavirus?

18:17.720 --> 18:18.720
How do they sell it?

18:18.720 --> 18:19.720
It starts over two or coronavirus.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.440
Actually, they sell this as HIV.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
You're serious?

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
Yeah.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.440
Yeah.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
I'm going with coronavirus, right?

18:26.440 --> 18:28.080
Maybe that's cheap.

18:28.080 --> 18:32.600
Do you understand what this is representing?

18:32.600 --> 18:38.440
It shows you exactly what kind of cartoon joke virology really is.

18:38.440 --> 18:48.000
They feign this superiority in fidelity and molecular accuracy and that they understand

18:48.000 --> 18:55.560
all these fine details at this very fine scale of molecular and chemical interaction,

18:55.560 --> 19:05.320
electrostatic charges that interact in three-dimensional space and aqueous and hydrophobic environments.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.000
It's spectacular.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.680
And here they are making fun of the joke cartoons that they know, they have to know,

19:13.680 --> 19:20.400
have been used to mislead the young all around the world for decades and now during the pandemic

19:20.400 --> 19:29.800
around the globe with an almost, well, definitely a malevolent level of just disregard for truth.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.000
Listen carefully to these two charlatans.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.320
Yeah, it's nice to be spending some time.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.120
After this, we're going to go to the Dixon de Pumier book signings.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
That's very exciting.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.280
Dixon should be in his element, right?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.880
He will be in his elements.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.960
What's on your tie today, Daniel?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.360
This is a virus.

19:49.360 --> 19:54.400
Notice a nice symmetry, almost like a corona of spikes around the outside there.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
Coronavirus?

19:55.400 --> 19:56.400
Sure.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
How do they sell it?

19:57.400 --> 19:58.840
It starts over two or coronavirus.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.800
Actually, they sell this as HIV.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.800
You're serious?

20:01.800 --> 20:02.800
Yeah.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.560
I'm going with coronavirus, right?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.560
Maybe that's GP160 or something.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.200
Well, it has the conical cords, and that just doesn't.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.200
Yeah.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.760
That's a problem when you get artists doing the viruses, right?

20:14.760 --> 20:15.960
It depends what they start with.

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
Anyway, it's a nice tie.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
Blackened tan, I guess.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.960
Yeah, it's my fancy.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.520
You got a drink?

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
Blackened tan.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.760
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.320
You take Guinness and mix them.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.640
Yeah, you mix like a light beer and then you...

20:28.640 --> 20:30.480
That seems like heresy, doesn't it?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
Yes.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
Yes.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.480
All right.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
Enough beer.

20:34.480 --> 20:38.880
All right, so let us start with a Jack Kerouac quotation.

20:38.880 --> 20:46.400
Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.

20:46.400 --> 20:51.360
So there's a real interesting pattern that I have yet to point out simply because I haven't

20:51.360 --> 20:55.920
wasted a lot of your time with this particular version of Twiv, the clinical update because

20:55.920 --> 20:58.480
it's so absurd.

20:58.480 --> 21:06.840
But one thing that I think is a really interesting aspect of this almost obvious scyop is that

21:06.840 --> 21:13.160
when he chooses a quote, it is almost always a quote that is ridiculously on point for

21:13.160 --> 21:16.960
what these two clowns are actually up to, whether they know it or not.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.160
Listen again, it's hysterical.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.160
Okay.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.360
All right, enough beer.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.360
All right.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.560
So let us start with a Jack Kerouac quotation.

21:26.920 --> 21:32.560
Out of focus are not accomplished by those who eat Kerouac quotation.

21:32.560 --> 21:39.840
Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.600
So let's start off with, apparently, the fad these days is to not...

21:44.600 --> 21:49.600
Now that's a very different thing than to state that great things are not accomplished

21:49.600 --> 21:55.240
by people who control those things, right?

21:55.240 --> 22:00.080
Let's listen to that quote one more time because I think it's almost so apt to say

22:00.080 --> 22:07.000
that the people who control those things can achieve great things, atrocities, even.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.120
With a Jack Kerouac quotation, great things are not accomplished by those who yield to

22:13.120 --> 22:16.880
trends and fads and popular opinion.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.760
Trends, fads, and popular opinion.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.600
If you can control those three things, though, you can do lots of nasty stuff.

22:25.720 --> 22:30.040
So it's always the quote is always some kind of double edged sword that cuts him right

22:30.040 --> 22:34.280
through the middle and cuts the narrative right through the middle.

22:34.280 --> 22:38.360
You can almost tell that they know what they're doing or the person that's choosing these

22:38.360 --> 22:41.360
quotes knows what they're doing.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.800
So let's start off with, apparently, the fad these days is to not protect our children

22:46.800 --> 22:48.920
with vaccines, Vincent.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.240
So I will start off with that disturbing news.

22:51.240 --> 22:57.520
So the MMWR coverage with selected vaccines and exemption from school vaccine requirements

22:57.520 --> 23:03.360
among children in kindergarten, United States, 2022, 23 school year.

23:03.360 --> 23:08.400
So this is basically the last year, 2022 through 2023 school year.

23:08.400 --> 23:15.040
The exemption, the exemption rate increased to 3% across this country.

23:15.040 --> 23:21.840
Vins increased in 41 states, exceeding 5% in 10 states.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.640
And this is available, CDC.gov, we'll leave in a link.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.440
But you can go through and you can find your state.

23:29.440 --> 23:36.760
And I, Vincent, I pulled a few out for you just to sort of highlight who's the winner

23:36.760 --> 23:41.000
when it comes to losing Idaho at 12.1%.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
Idaho, what kind of crazy and so we're talking about philosophical objections here, not necessarily

23:49.000 --> 23:54.280
religious objections to getting vaccines to go to school.

23:54.280 --> 23:58.440
And up 12% from the year before, I'm not really sure what that means.

23:58.440 --> 24:03.800
If they were very low, it might not be that big of an increase.

24:03.800 --> 24:09.800
And keep in mind that these guys are obviously wants to make it seem as though the increases

24:09.800 --> 24:11.240
are really disturbing.

24:11.240 --> 24:17.800
And obviously, giggle and biological takes the stance that, you know, intramuscular injection

24:17.800 --> 24:21.760
of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

24:21.760 --> 24:28.840
And these guys are clearly pro vaccine as one of the top three best inventions of humankind

24:28.840 --> 24:32.760
right up there with the wheel and the space shuttle.

24:33.760 --> 24:43.160
You know, Arizona, 7.4 Wisconsin, 7.2, Washington, you know, they're a great Pacific state.

24:43.160 --> 24:49.680
We got 4% who's winning when it comes to winning New York, 0.1.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.880
Hey, we're in New York right now.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.880
I'm proud of it.

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
I'm proud of you.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
Okay.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.880
And Joe Manchin country, West Virginia, less than 0.1.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.880
So.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.080
And these are.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.520
I would guess that that's there's something weird about that in West Virginia.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.280
It might not be that anybody cares.

25:07.280 --> 25:11.960
And if you don't need to get an exemption and the state never reports it or never checks

25:11.960 --> 25:21.400
or whatever, it's not clear to me how this is really reinforced in Pennsylvania.

25:21.400 --> 25:28.160
Now that I know, you can just print out a form and sign it and it's done like you have

25:28.160 --> 25:31.360
a philosophical objection to this, this kind of medicine.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.560
It's done.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.680
And that's the way it should be.

25:33.680 --> 25:38.200
Of course, if we were a free country and we were dealing with real biologists and we

25:38.200 --> 25:44.080
were talking about real immunology, but we're not.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.800
Exemptions that have been granted to children to not be vaccinated to go to school.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
Yeah.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.440
They medical exemptions most no philosophical.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.440
That's this new thing.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
Philosophically, philosophic.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.440
I just don't sort of believe in protecting my children against these vaccine.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.920
You know, I think that's in order to know philosophical.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.920
That's this new thing.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.040
So this is going to get disturbing right now.

26:05.040 --> 26:09.160
He's going to characterize the philosophical objection as a new thing, but it's really

26:09.160 --> 26:10.160
not a new thing.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.440
It's an expansion of the religious objection.

26:12.440 --> 26:17.480
It's a more generalized way of expressing the religious objection.

26:17.480 --> 26:25.480
If you have to go so far as to say that you, your particular version of a deity forbids

26:25.480 --> 26:32.240
you from participating in a vow or taking a vaccination.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.800
You should be able to have better.

26:33.800 --> 26:39.640
And I'm not saying that's not a great reason, but you should have better, more, more concrete

26:39.640 --> 26:40.640
reasons.

26:40.640 --> 26:45.000
I mean, even saying that there's an irreducible complexity to the immune system and to our

26:45.000 --> 26:53.560
physiology that I believe far exceeds the, the claimed expertise of those that would

26:53.560 --> 26:59.160
push the vaccines on us as a requirement.

26:59.160 --> 27:09.320
And I am very, very skeptical of anybody that says that they want the vaccines tested unless

27:09.320 --> 27:14.680
they explicitly say that that is a strategy in order for everybody to learn that these

27:14.680 --> 27:19.800
are, these are wholly inappropriate for augmenting the immune system.

27:19.800 --> 27:24.320
The trouble is, is that if you're asking for them to be tested, then somebody's got

27:24.320 --> 27:30.440
to be injected intramuscularly to augment their immune system which I'm arguing is dumb.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.320
So I don't like that argument.

27:32.320 --> 27:38.120
I think it's just easier to argue the biology as it is and let these people kind of flounder

27:38.120 --> 27:42.840
around the very simple statement that the immune system is organized from the inside

27:42.840 --> 27:45.600
out and toward barriers.

27:45.600 --> 27:50.560
And so any attempt to augment the immune system should occur at that barrier and not

27:50.560 --> 27:52.880
behind it.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.960
And they won't be able to make an argument against that.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.720
They can say, oh, it's not really all the images to work because the immune system is

27:58.720 --> 28:02.600
all over your body or something like they could say that, but it doesn't make any biological

28:02.600 --> 28:04.100
sense.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.360
They can't expand on it.

28:05.360 --> 28:09.720
They can't, they can't continue to make this argument with yabbats.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.760
They have to have a kind of coherent story.

28:12.760 --> 28:16.440
I can go on about this for three hours straight.

28:16.440 --> 28:22.200
I think that in order to have a philosophical, I don't believe in protecting my children

28:22.200 --> 28:27.200
against these vaccine, you know, I think that in order to have a philosophical, I don't

28:27.200 --> 28:34.080
believe in protecting my children against these vaccine preventable diseases.

28:34.080 --> 28:39.920
That's their best characterization of someone who would rather forego the vaccination schedule

28:39.920 --> 28:50.720
or God forbid have some of the live attenuated vaccines after age five.

28:50.720 --> 29:00.360
I mean, I don't want to tell people what they can and cannot do.

29:00.360 --> 29:05.080
And to a certain extent, I don't know.

29:05.080 --> 29:09.480
I think we have to make some choices sometimes when we talk to people and we have to decide

29:09.480 --> 29:14.280
whether we're fighting for freedom or whether we're fighting for that particular philosophy,

29:14.280 --> 29:20.560
which is ultimately this is the ultimately the biology, the fundamental biology is that

29:20.560 --> 29:26.800
augmenting the immune system from an intramuscular injection doesn't really make sense.

29:26.800 --> 29:33.080
But do we really want that to be our goal with everybody or do we want to take a more

29:33.080 --> 29:38.840
general idea that by telling them that we don't understand this biology enough for

29:38.840 --> 29:49.160
them to act so arrogant as to force people to use their proposed solution?

29:49.160 --> 29:54.400
Do we want to even go more general and say that it's freedom and what freedom is is

29:54.400 --> 30:01.320
our right to choose and more importantly, our right to inform consent and to say no.

30:01.320 --> 30:04.320
And so each one of these angles is a little bit different.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.200
One of them appeals more to your critical thinker.

30:07.200 --> 30:13.680
One of them appeals more to your to your libertarian or to your to your patriot.

30:13.680 --> 30:20.040
And at the dinner table at Thanksgiving, we're going to have to decide with some people which

30:20.040 --> 30:22.520
one of those is the angle to take.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.920
Some of them are going to be open to the biological angle, but they might be very well very well

30:26.920 --> 30:32.520
open to the freedom angle, the sovereignty angle.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.720
And if they're open to the sovereignty angle, then they might even be open to the idea that

30:35.720 --> 30:40.880
people would lie to you in order to get that sovereignty away from your children.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.840
People like these people might lie to you and your children and to college age kids

30:44.840 --> 30:52.000
in order to steal that sovereignty for the for the team that they play for because make

30:52.000 --> 30:57.640
no mistake about it, there are teams on the field right now and they want nothing more

30:57.640 --> 31:02.240
than for us never to form our own team.

31:02.240 --> 31:07.680
The independent bright web would be their worst nightmare.

31:07.680 --> 31:11.560
People that call each other out, people that talk regularly, people that debate with each

31:11.560 --> 31:15.960
other and collectively elevate and promote one another.

31:15.960 --> 31:22.840
That could be so dangerous.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.320
And that's what they don't want right now because the intellectual dark web was exactly

31:26.320 --> 31:33.520
that kind of pyramid with people like Joe Rogan and the Weinstein boys on the top and

31:33.520 --> 31:39.840
then underneath our Lex and all those other guys that get element sponsorships and then

31:39.840 --> 31:45.840
under them is Tim Poole and all these other clowns that look up to one half of the pyramid

31:46.840 --> 31:53.440
and the whole narrative and argument structure is controlled from the top.

31:53.440 --> 31:58.080
A independent bright web would be controlled from the bottom and we would be elevating

31:58.080 --> 32:06.960
one another and that's what I think would work really well here.

32:06.960 --> 32:12.080
That's what would defeat these kinds of people who have all this artificial elevated algorithmic

32:12.080 --> 32:20.720
help, financial comfort come from weaponized piles of money all around the world.

32:20.720 --> 32:28.360
We've got to give ourselves a chance to overcome the handicap of having to fight against weaponized

32:28.360 --> 32:31.120
piles of money.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.120
Independent bright web.

32:32.120 --> 32:36.880
I don't know if that's going to stick or not, but I think it's a really good idea.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.880
Objection.

32:37.880 --> 32:43.640
You should have to answer a 20 question test on vaccines when you need to pass and I'll

32:43.640 --> 32:46.800
bet none of them would pass because I'm going to make up the test you and I will make up

32:46.800 --> 32:47.800
the test.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.800
All right.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.800
Yeah.

32:49.800 --> 32:50.800
All right.

32:50.800 --> 32:51.800
Sounds good.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
Yeah.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.800
I'm on vaccines.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.240
You need to pass and I'll bet none of them would pass because I'm going to make up the

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
test.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
You and I will make up the test.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.240
All right.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
Yeah.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.240
Yeah.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.240
I would like to take that test.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.240
This is really disturbing.

33:03.240 --> 33:07.280
We're discussing this on the last urgent care call this week.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.720
And you know, just prepare to start seeing stuff that we thought we weren't going to

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
see so much anymore.

33:11.720 --> 33:15.440
Well, the good news is if you have a child and you vaccinate them, they'll be protected

33:15.440 --> 33:16.440
from disease.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.440
Yeah.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.440
Yeah.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.640
But unfortunately, the kids don't have a say in this matter and they'll get sick and

33:20.640 --> 33:23.480
they may have lifelong disabilities as a consequence.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.480
Wow.

33:24.480 --> 33:28.320
Lifelong disabilities as a consequence of not getting vaccinated.

33:28.320 --> 33:31.120
That's a weird flip of things, isn't it?

33:31.120 --> 33:38.800
Where the lifelong disability is going to come from measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis,

33:38.800 --> 33:46.840
RSV, the flu, coronavirus, which one of those is going to give you lifelong chronic illness?

33:46.840 --> 33:52.680
Boy, that's a, that's a, that's a inversion right there.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.680
That is an inversion.

33:53.680 --> 34:00.320
I got to like blow a whistle and say inversion, foul.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.920
I mean, that's, that's, I don't know what to say.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.200
That's, that's pretty funny.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.360
I mean, the parents, they're not bad people.

34:06.360 --> 34:11.560
They're just, they're the victims of this massive misinformation campaign that is not

34:11.560 --> 34:15.200
benefiting them, but is benefiting certain people who are filling their coffers.

34:15.200 --> 34:16.200
Wow.

34:16.200 --> 34:21.200
Camping them, but is benefiting certain people who are filling their coffers.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.960
Filling their coffers.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.160
Flue looks like a little bit of a rise.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.160
Flue is coming.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.160
Flue is coming.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.160
Flue is coming.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.160
Flue is coming.

34:31.160 --> 34:39.160
This is six times the number of cases compared to this time last year.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.160
Wow.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.160
Six times the number of cases.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.920
Mostly hitting kids.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.400
So 19 and younger.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.000
Yeah, they're reading from a teleprompter.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.800
My guess is they got the equipment.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.160
I mean, you know, the spare no expense.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.800
This is the Jurassic Park of propaganda here.

34:55.800 --> 35:02.640
Most of the U.S. not really seeing much of a rise, but, you know, we've got New Mexico,

35:02.640 --> 35:08.440
we've got Alaska, Florida's is jumping in with high levels.

35:08.440 --> 35:14.000
So we're, we're starting to see an increase, you know, particularly in those, those little

35:14.000 --> 35:16.160
kids for and under.

35:16.160 --> 35:22.320
And I'll mention so far of the isolates, it's looking like 90% are H1 viruses.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.880
That's good because those are less virulent than the H3 viruses, right?

35:26.880 --> 35:27.880
So we'll see.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.680
We'll see how it goes.

35:29.680 --> 35:35.200
I don't know, six, six times the number of cases in Puerto Rico, a lot of predictions

35:35.200 --> 35:39.360
that this might be a challenging winter ahead of us.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.360
All right.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.360
Puerto Rico.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.360
Puerto Rico.

35:42.360 --> 35:49.240
So I can't skip when I hear something about Canada or us, a total of 1313 cases have been

35:49.240 --> 35:52.120
reported in Nevada so far.

35:52.120 --> 35:57.800
This year of those, we're talking about a fungus, clinical cases, actual infections,

35:57.800 --> 35:59.720
not just colonization.

35:59.720 --> 36:05.960
At this time last year, Nevada had a total of 774, we're almost double that.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
There were cases.

36:06.960 --> 36:11.080
You will recall that there was one paper from vodkaing in the Netherlands that looked

36:11.080 --> 36:17.120
at the activation of the immune system or the response of immune system in some assay.

36:18.120 --> 36:22.360
I don't know if it was a T cell assay or just a lymphocyte assay.

36:22.360 --> 36:30.640
And looking at a battery of bacterial antigens and a battery of fungal antigens after Moderna

36:30.640 --> 36:33.960
vaccination and they showed a change.

36:33.960 --> 36:43.520
And so I think it was hypersensitivity to bacteria and hypo sensitivity to fungus, but it could

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
have been the other way around.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
It doesn't matter.

36:45.560 --> 36:51.760
There's going to be a whole host of potential mechanisms for immune compromise that could

36:51.760 --> 36:58.000
be dysregulation, that could be some kind of lymphocyte opinion.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.800
There's lots of different reports and lots of different descriptions about what happens.

37:01.800 --> 37:09.760
But generally speaking, the immune system becoming compromised because of this kind of

37:09.760 --> 37:14.000
misguided augmentation attempt is not unusual.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.200
And so it's interesting that, of course, they're going to try to make a story about

37:19.200 --> 37:26.680
this rising fungal cases of infection in people, but never make any connection or never even

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
ask the question.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.800
I wonder if these people have had all their COVID shots and if they have it, it's made

37:30.800 --> 37:31.800
it more vulnerable.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.320
Of course, it probably has.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.560
It is 11 o'clock.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.520
I've been on for 36 minutes and I'm going to try and cut it a little bit short.

37:40.600 --> 37:46.680
I really wanted you to just see the tie and to hear the immediate report about the decrease

37:46.680 --> 37:49.520
in vaccination rate and the way that they discussed it.

37:49.520 --> 37:55.040
The rest of the show just goes on with the mythology, talking about COVID, talking about

37:55.040 --> 38:00.040
different variants, talking about whether or not certain drugs that are given to old

38:00.040 --> 38:07.080
people when they have COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, I guess, by PCR or something like that, whether

38:07.080 --> 38:08.840
or not their variant changes.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.360
It's all a bunch of bogus bogus.

38:11.360 --> 38:16.080
I don't really think it's worth our time, but I did want you to see that and then I just

38:16.080 --> 38:20.920
did want to test this out a little bit to see if this makes sense and if you remember

38:20.920 --> 38:29.120
this at all, I want you to think about how easy it would be for them to take what was

38:29.120 --> 38:37.960
a background signal, an RNA-DNA background signal, and that's represented by the train.

38:37.960 --> 38:43.640
And then they can take and use PCR testing and lateral flow testing that confounds that

38:43.640 --> 38:49.600
background signal with seroprevalence to other things and with the presence of other RNA

38:49.600 --> 38:57.440
and DNA, be it endogenous or exogenous, and confounds that with the idea that there is

38:57.440 --> 38:59.200
a novel virus.

38:59.200 --> 39:04.920
And so in this case, he is confounding the train moving and stopping and letting people

39:04.920 --> 39:10.140
out with him being able to stop it and him needing to start it.

39:10.140 --> 39:14.280
And they can actually, you can actually use this analogy to describe almost the entire

39:14.280 --> 39:20.320
Scooby-Doo because while we are meant to believe that this guy is stopping and starting the

39:20.320 --> 39:26.280
train, what I want you to understand is that the illusion of consensus is not one guy.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.360
Imagine if there were, if you're a little kid standing on the wall, because that's

39:30.360 --> 39:34.440
what you were when you had your phone or you're watching TV, you're a little kid standing

39:34.480 --> 39:40.160
on the wall and that train comes into the station and not one guy in shorts, but 40

39:40.160 --> 39:49.600
guys in big work outfits with greasy gloves on and work protective gear.

39:49.600 --> 39:55.920
And those 40 guys do the same thing that this guy is doing and they grunt as it stops and

39:55.920 --> 39:59.680
they push and they grunt as they get the train going again.

39:59.680 --> 40:07.080
Now the illusion of consensus is a lot easier to believe or it's a lot harder to dismiss

40:07.080 --> 40:11.840
than if it's just one guy and he's chalking up his hands and you can hear that the train

40:11.840 --> 40:15.640
is making all these other noises.

40:15.640 --> 40:20.840
But if you got 40 guys out there or 400 guys out there and they pretended to stop the train

40:20.840 --> 40:28.520
and they pretended to start the train, well, holy cow, now you've got an illusion going.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.320
And if you get people on the left and on the right, you get people on the lab leak

40:32.320 --> 40:37.440
side and on the natural virus side, if you get the people on the early treatment side

40:37.440 --> 40:41.920
and the antibiotic side, if you get the people on the hydroxychloroquine side and the ivermectin

40:41.920 --> 40:53.280
side to all participate in this illusion, we've got a serious problem on our hands.

40:53.280 --> 40:58.240
Do you understand what I'm saying here, ladies and gentlemen, do you get why the Scooby-Doo?

40:58.240 --> 41:03.420
It doesn't have to be the Scooby-Doo, it can be the train pusher.

41:03.420 --> 41:09.560
These people have all pretended to be part of the train pushing crew.

41:09.560 --> 41:15.280
Some of them sold an ivermectin book or a hydroxychloroquine book or a bioweapon book

41:15.280 --> 41:26.860
or a lies book or a Wuhan lie book or a horror or a no virus story and they all end up pushing

41:26.860 --> 41:34.740
the same faith in a novel virus, they all push the same silly illusion of consensus

41:34.740 --> 41:41.620
that somehow a combination of our actions and our fumbling, we were able to stop a virus

41:41.620 --> 41:48.020
and stop a pandemic and saved people that millions of other people got killed.

41:48.020 --> 41:52.700
This illusion of consensus has to be broken, I don't know what analogies to use other

41:52.700 --> 41:57.500
than the faith in a novel virus, that's what it is, it's a faith and it's a faith

41:57.500 --> 42:02.520
that was sustained by a bunch of people pretending to stop that train or knowing how it stopped

42:02.520 --> 42:11.100
or participating in it, they sustained the illusion and that faith is a lie and all you

42:11.100 --> 42:14.820
need is that background train running on schedule.

42:14.820 --> 42:20.940
All you need is that background train running on schedule and this all works fine.

42:20.940 --> 42:27.580
PCR tests, yeah sure, here they go, here they are, hydroxychloroquine, oh boy that saves

42:27.580 --> 42:32.380
everybody, oh Ivermectin, oh slow down, we need some new stuff because there's a new

42:32.380 --> 42:38.660
thing out there.

42:38.660 --> 42:45.100
They pretended to stop the train and the train was an endemic background, the train was the

42:45.100 --> 42:50.220
protocols being murder and the transfection not being medicine but none of these people

42:50.220 --> 42:56.060
told you that but that's what the train is, the protocols are murder, transfection is

42:56.060 --> 43:02.340
not medicine and there was a background signal that they confounded with a pandemic idea

43:02.340 --> 43:07.020
and none of these people have told you that the train is actually going all by itself

43:07.020 --> 43:12.060
and it doesn't matter what these people did, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't

43:12.060 --> 43:17.900
matter, it was always there, the train just runs on schedule, protocols were murder and

43:17.900 --> 43:23.860
the transfection is not medicine and that's why this no virus thing is, there's no trains

43:23.860 --> 43:32.820
at all, that train's not even there.

43:32.820 --> 43:37.300
I don't know what to say, I'm just trying to find ways to teach it better, ways for

43:37.300 --> 43:40.420
people to understand it easier.

43:40.420 --> 43:46.860
An active theater is required for that train gag to work and the more people that participate

43:46.860 --> 43:53.340
in that theater besides that one dude in shorts, the better that theater becomes.

43:53.340 --> 43:57.660
The more varied they are in their response, some of them could even get dragged by the

43:57.660 --> 44:09.580
train, you know, some of them could scream or let their shoes drag or they could stumble,

44:09.580 --> 44:15.340
make it look even cooler, some of them could have ropes, you know what I mean?

44:15.340 --> 44:24.500
That's what they did, just a great big impromptu train stopping show and that impromptu train

44:24.500 --> 44:28.980
stopping show is on this slide right here because they don't talk about what the train

44:28.980 --> 44:35.460
really is which is just PCR fraud and variant sequencing fraud, death certificate fraud,

44:35.460 --> 44:40.780
a fraud about how an RNA virus in a small quantity in a market could become a planet

44:40.780 --> 44:47.180
covering RNA virus in a few weeks.

44:47.180 --> 44:52.660
Transfection being useful, come on, natural immunity, has anyone taught you that?

44:52.660 --> 44:58.140
How many people do you know that actively call themselves on social media immunologists

44:58.140 --> 45:06.580
and have never taught single podcast immunology 101 lecture with pictures?

45:06.580 --> 45:12.660
I'll think of a few off the top of my head, immunologist, I'm pretty sure Jessica Rose

45:12.660 --> 45:19.540
has immunologist in the top of her, in the top of her Twitter thing and she might even

45:19.540 --> 45:22.980
say that she has a postdoctoral degree in immunology.

45:22.980 --> 45:29.780
I think that the disambiguation wizard named Robert Malone also calls himself an immunologist

45:29.780 --> 45:38.140
but he's never bothered to explain it and I'm sure there are many more immunologists

45:38.140 --> 45:42.900
that haven't bothered to teach immunology 101 with respect to the background signal,

45:42.900 --> 45:51.500
with respect to the response to RNA viruses in general and the reason why they're doing

45:51.500 --> 45:57.660
this is because this is not about a pandemic, this is about digital ID, digital currency,

45:57.660 --> 46:02.860
the collapse of the dollar, the inversion of the sovereignty of your children.

46:02.860 --> 46:09.300
This is about enslavement, this is about a multi-generational plan and they want you

46:09.300 --> 46:14.380
to be thinking about next year in the election, they're thinking about their kids' kids and

46:14.380 --> 46:19.740
what their kids' kids will own and what their kids' kids will know that our kids won't

46:19.740 --> 46:23.420
know and that's why they will be the rulers.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.940
They want to govern the whole world with this mythology ladies and gentlemen, that's the

46:26.940 --> 46:27.940
plan.

46:27.940 --> 46:35.140
Please stop all transfections in humans, please stop transfections in humans, please stop them

46:35.140 --> 46:39.900
because they're trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

46:39.900 --> 46:44.540
This has been GIGO and biological where we say intramuscular injection by any combination

46:44.540 --> 46:49.900
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, transfection and

46:49.900 --> 46:53.700
healthy humans is criminally negligent.

46:53.700 --> 46:57.380
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been GIGO, biological to high-resistance, low-noise

46:57.380 --> 47:00.820
information brief brought to you by a biologist.

47:00.820 --> 47:11.300
Thank you very much for joining me and I'll see you again tomorrow night.

47:11.300 --> 47:16.580
Sunday is at 3 o'clock Eastern, 3 o'clock Eastern I will be presenting live to the UK

47:16.580 --> 47:23.580
Doctors 3 o'clock tomorrow and then I think it's on my schedule the afternoon

47:23.580 --> 47:30.380
and early evening for J by Vicharya and Peter McCullough on Monday.

47:30.380 --> 47:34.780
Thank you very much again for joining me, I'm sorry I was so late.

47:34.780 --> 47:39.620
I almost let the streak go and then I thought you know what, maybe I should try to keep

47:39.620 --> 47:44.020
the streak going at least until the book is available or something like that anyway.

47:44.020 --> 47:46.020
Thanks everybody for being here, see you again tomorrow.
