WEBVTT

00:02.328 --> 00:06.430
I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:07.251 --> 00:07.731
Actually, J.J.

00:07.771 --> 00:14.374
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:15.175 --> 00:15.675
Actually, J.J.

00:15.715 --> 00:22.358
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:23.119 --> 00:23.619
Actually, J.J.

00:23.639 --> 00:30.262
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:34.838 --> 00:43.804
The one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and re-capitulate disease.

00:43.824 --> 00:52.790
The one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and re-capitulate disease.

00:52.830 --> 01:01.376
The one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and re-capitulate disease.

01:01.876 --> 01:09.184
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.746
It's a 200-year myth.

01:13.106 --> 01:20.894
It's a 200-year multi-generational indoctrination that vaccines are safe, effective, necessary, and harmless.

01:21.134 --> 01:23.536
And every one of those statements I just made are lies.

01:23.756 --> 01:24.857
Vaccines are not safe.

01:25.258 --> 01:32.205
Not one vaccine has ever been proven to be safe because they don't use true placebos, number one, and they don't follow them long enough to see

01:32.805 --> 01:35.186
All they're looking for is, did it make you die?

01:35.206 --> 01:37.086
And if you didn't die, they call it safe.

01:37.566 --> 01:46.148
They never talk about asthma, allergies, eczema, ADD, ADHD, the longest neurological problems, the autoimmune diseases that take a long time to develop.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.608
None of that is followed.

01:48.008 --> 01:59.911
Because if it's more than 72 hours later that you develop a side effect, it says, well, that has nothing to do with obesity, which is an arbitrary line that was drawn in the sand in the early 1990s by the FDA.

02:06.988 --> 02:09.730
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:09.950 --> 02:10.410
It can't.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.793
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

02:15.694 --> 02:19.777
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:19.797 --> 02:25.281
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:25.541 --> 02:26.001
It can't.

02:26.642 --> 02:30.404
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

02:31.305 --> 02:35.388
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.861
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:41.101 --> 02:41.582
It can't.

02:42.202 --> 02:45.943
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

02:45.963 --> 02:50.445
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking.

02:52.099 --> 03:05.725
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape and they just don't have the latitude to act unilaterally.

03:05.785 --> 03:16.589
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape and they just don't have

03:49.446 --> 04:02.757
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like JJ Cui, regarded by a few people, by some people, as sort of this kind of

04:04.420 --> 04:16.486
savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt, and in many ways they are, but that's throwing baby after bath water.

04:16.786 --> 04:27.392
I mean the best thinkers in the world all fall through and suffer through the consequences of ten bad ideas for every good one, you know, the best creative thinkers.

04:28.613 --> 04:42.987
And so if you're going to jump on every one of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with, that you don't agree with, and use that as tar to smear the person, I think that's just, you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself.

04:43.007 --> 04:46.310
You won't find the muses, the creative inspiration.

04:47.111 --> 04:50.795
So I certainly think that JJ Cooley's overall take is very good.

05:06.107 --> 05:08.729
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:10.490 --> 05:11.171
And I have lied.

05:11.191 --> 05:12.252
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:12.272 --> 05:13.212
I don't want to lie.

05:13.693 --> 05:15.034
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

05:15.174 --> 05:16.195
I try not to be a liar.

05:16.215 --> 05:17.075
I don't want to be a liar.

05:17.636 --> 05:20.338
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.657
I think truth is good for kids.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.940
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.022
We want everybody to feel good.

05:37.142 --> 05:39.324
That's not the way life is.

06:00.488 --> 06:01.249
Good morning, everybody.

06:01.289 --> 06:01.929
Welcome to the show.

06:01.949 --> 06:09.194
This is Giga Home Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by someone with a rather damaged and sore throat.

06:09.214 --> 06:14.477
I'm not really sure what's going on, so I'm going to try and take it easy on my voice today.

06:14.497 --> 06:20.761
I will turn up the volume just a little bit, which may be annoying, but that's what we got to do.

06:22.022 --> 06:24.384
Thank you for your concern via email.

06:24.624 --> 06:27.926
I'm not really sure what's going on.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.787
Maybe I got stuff growing in there again.

06:30.847 --> 06:31.167
I don't know.

06:31.387 --> 06:32.088
Oh, it's hot in here.

06:33.488 --> 06:35.548
There's not a lot I can do about it.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.849
If that's what's happening, that's what's happening.

06:39.229 --> 06:41.290
The message is basically available.

06:42.710 --> 06:52.292
If I have to go offline right now and you're left with downloading the videos that I've made and posted to PeerTube, which are all available for download,

06:53.737 --> 06:55.358
I don't know how bad off we would be.

06:55.439 --> 06:58.942
I don't know how much farther the messaging really needs to go.

06:59.602 --> 07:10.612
You could get all the clips and all the clever statements and all the 1, 2, 3 elevator pitches you wanted out of the last year and a half of videos which are available on PeerTube.

07:10.672 --> 07:15.135
So as much as it's annoying for me that my voice hurts and my throat hurts and

07:16.240 --> 07:18.961
feels like stuff is getting in the way.

07:18.981 --> 07:22.943
I don't know what to tell you.

07:24.404 --> 07:35.710
I already knew that I was giving everything, so if losing my voice or my throat or whatever is part of this game, that's just the way it is.

07:36.710 --> 07:39.071
I don't have any qualms about this.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.963
I'm staying focused on the biology.

07:42.983 --> 07:45.524
57 years old bladder cancer.

07:45.584 --> 07:50.347
I think for a lot of us, we keep hearing this same refrain and it's getting a little alarming.

07:50.407 --> 07:53.708
Are we just hearing more about it or is it actually happening more frequently?

07:53.728 --> 08:00.752
Well, you know, I'm broadcasting from Dallas and here in Dallas, we love Dion Sanders, former Dallas Cowboy.

08:00.912 --> 08:01.312
Absolutely.

08:01.332 --> 08:03.293
You know, two way player played baseball.

08:04.105 --> 08:05.946
Incredible sports figure.

08:06.166 --> 08:06.626
Please.

08:06.906 --> 08:13.690
Thank you, Tony, so much for telling me that the PeerTube app works as well for you as it does for me.

08:14.470 --> 08:18.972
I too am so pleasantly surprised at the functionality of it.

08:19.152 --> 08:27.476
Maybe at the end of the show, I'll show you how to upload it again and how to find our website or how to put the stream.gigaohm.bio in there.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.957
But I'm so happy you put that in the chat.

08:29.997 --> 08:30.678
Thank you very much.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.378
That made my day.

08:31.843 --> 08:38.889
Well, father and family man, he's been wrapped with COVID-19 vaccine complications from the very beginning.

08:39.490 --> 08:41.772
You had a family history of peripheral tear disease.

08:41.812 --> 08:46.215
He previously had turf toe when he played, and so he had altered anatomy of his foot.

08:46.696 --> 08:55.604
He developed COVID-19 vaccine blood clots, arterial and venous, and several years ago, after he was pushing the vaccine hard,

08:56.704 --> 08:58.205
We know he took multiple doses.

08:58.725 --> 09:00.186
He nearly lost his leg.

09:00.246 --> 09:02.026
He had multiple surgeries.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.568
He made a docuseries on this.

09:05.308 --> 09:06.508
It's been absolutely tragic.

09:06.549 --> 09:12.891
He didn't put two and two together that the vaccines had promoted his lower extremity blood clot syndrome.

09:12.951 --> 09:13.852
And now we hear.

09:14.389 --> 09:15.430
So it's interesting, right?

09:15.470 --> 09:16.550
He lives in Dallas.

09:16.610 --> 09:18.111
He's a very famous American.

09:18.511 --> 09:27.216
Um, and he somehow couldn't get in touch with, with Deon Sanders after he heard that Deon Sanders had clots and lost his toes.

09:27.396 --> 09:28.597
It's, it's bizarre.

09:29.657 --> 09:30.458
It's bizarre.

09:30.858 --> 09:34.780
Um, but we know that this is a scripted fraud.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.262
Um, we know that this guy is on Robert Malone's script.

09:38.762 --> 09:40.443
Um, early in the pandemic he did,

09:41.189 --> 09:52.975
a lot of work with Robert Malone and Ryan Cole, some of which was on Zoom meetings, some of which was touring around, and then split off into The Wellness Company.

09:54.016 --> 10:04.942
My assumption is that that's all one kind of malevolent show because, you know, it's kind of hard to share all these details because there's just so many of them, they're so interwoven, but

10:06.038 --> 10:13.802
the inaugural CHD conference, which sounds kind of odd, but they'd never had a conference until 2022 in Knoxville, Tennessee.

10:14.622 --> 10:28.949
And I attended as staff member of the writing team at the time, not working for CHD, but working for Bobby Kennedy, even though I now understand it in retrospect as always having worked for the publishing part of CHD.

10:28.989 --> 10:31.710
So essentially it's the same, it's all the same paycheck.

10:32.781 --> 10:36.824
It was just a question of whether they were paying me as an employee or as a consultant.

10:36.884 --> 10:50.673
And so, the important thing to understand here is that CHD and their whole operation wasn't something that spontaneously occurred.

10:50.793 --> 11:01.600
It seems in retrospect that CHD was an environmental organization called the World Mercury

11:02.856 --> 11:30.279
something or other world mercury project and it was a pet project of robert f kennedy jr as an environmentalist and in 2018 he was persuaded and we can use that word very loosely here to also maybe describe a edit to his previous script given to him by his handlers now it's important to understand that one thing that happened during

11:31.059 --> 11:36.360
the campaign for president, which I found to be quite dishonest.

11:37.900 --> 11:42.361
And in fact, this dishonesty went on after Trump was elected.

11:42.661 --> 11:51.343
And it was a really bad sign for me at that time when I still was clinging to some thread of hope that maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:51.443 --> 11:55.484
just needed to hear it right and then he would finally do the right thing or something like that.

11:56.724 --> 11:59.045
And the thing that bothers me really is

12:00.453 --> 12:00.874
is this.

12:02.557 --> 12:08.607
It was a very disingenuous moment in the movement to become president.

12:08.627 --> 12:11.873
There were a number of very, very disingenuous moments.

12:11.933 --> 12:12.494
The complete

12:13.169 --> 12:18.193
ignoring of the opioid pandemic, the way that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:18.233 --> 12:25.958
stepped away from CHD, along with Mary Holland, and the Tony Lyons guy from Skyhorse.

12:25.998 --> 12:37.627
So it's a really weird, you know, and then Dell joined them, and so it's a really weird group of people that went from, you know, anti-vax, fighting for the health of children, to running for president.

12:38.847 --> 12:40.969
That's one really big red flag.

12:41.930 --> 13:05.269
Another really big red flag was the way that this whole CHD conference actually took place in the end, because there were so many people that showed up at the inaugural CHD conference in one place, following me around, trying to sit at my table, and the list is almost too extraordinary to mention, and includes people like Whitney Webb,

13:07.279 --> 13:13.583
I have signed copies of her books as a result of meeting her at the inaugural CHD conference.

13:15.484 --> 13:19.206
I met Matt Crawford there, the first and only time I met his wife.

13:21.107 --> 13:22.848
I met Ryan Cole there.

13:23.108 --> 13:28.591
I met Jill Glasspool Malone and Robert Malone.

13:29.832 --> 13:30.713
I did not meet him.

13:30.793 --> 13:31.493
He was not there.

13:31.553 --> 13:32.534
I met Pierre Corey.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.195
I met Paul Merrick.

13:37.174 --> 13:58.234
really interesting and I of course I met Charles Rixey at the inaugural CHD conference and that was the second time in 2022 that I had met Charles Rixey in person he actually came to my house in January of the same year and it was the supposedly the stream that I did with Charles Rixey in January of 2022 that Robert Malone told

14:01.080 --> 14:03.282
Senator Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:03.322 --> 14:07.926
to watch in April, which spurred them to call me in April and ask for my help.

14:08.707 --> 14:18.796
And so now, you know, it's, it's pretty incredible that in 2022, we really had this, the murder was still happening until the end of 2022.

14:18.836 --> 14:27.243
And it was only our 2021 and the beginning of 2022 is only after the murder stopped that these people suddenly decided to call me.

14:28.769 --> 14:31.270
If you look at the numbers, it's really quite extraordinary.

14:31.950 --> 14:41.752
And so this inaugural CHD conference was really, really something to remember from the perspective of looking back and trying to think what was going on.

14:41.772 --> 14:48.074
Because at that conference, I was told by Matt Crawford and by, uh, um,

14:50.094 --> 14:56.239
Ryan Cole and by Robert Malone that the, that the wellness company might be bad guys.

14:56.359 --> 14:59.302
And that, that means that Peter McCullough might be a bad guy.

15:03.445 --> 15:18.298
And so this theater has gone on a very long time and it is because of that one little incident, that one little group theater where Matt Crawford and Robert Malone and Ryan Cole pretended to be meeting

15:19.898 --> 15:33.887
you know, over by the windows in the comfy chairs and reported to be meeting to discuss the wellness company and the potential implications for whether or not they should continue to cooperate with Peter McCullough.

15:35.748 --> 15:44.714
And what I didn't understand at the time was that theater was designed to make me think they were good guys looking at people very critically.

15:45.600 --> 15:53.085
At that same conference, Rixey told me that it's really funny that Robert Malone couldn't remember you because he remembered me and he invited me to his farm.

15:53.425 --> 15:55.707
And he told me that three times in two days.

15:56.768 --> 15:58.309
Like I didn't remember it.

15:59.109 --> 16:06.895
Even though according to his friend McCairn and himself, who streamed together for a year after that conference,

16:07.947 --> 16:10.829
that I'm somehow damaged by my marijuana use.

16:11.490 --> 16:23.239
But it's these people who repeat things over and over and can't seem to remember anything, so they never make any progress on any idea or any concept, even over decades.

16:26.582 --> 16:34.329
And so here we have somebody who's talking about a real tragic story of a potential

16:35.749 --> 16:59.502
Celebrity that could be woken up to the truth and you wouldn't even have to slap him in the face with it because there are other Celebrities and sportsmen that that you could slap him in the face with like Kyrie Irving And there are several others that have experienced problems as a result of taking Moderna or Pfizer and this is a open door

17:00.598 --> 17:09.764
to break the illusion, and he doesn't really seem to be too excited about it, even though we really love the Deion Sanders who does two sports and stuff.

17:10.065 --> 17:18.090
That he has severe invasive bladder cancer requiring a total replacement of the bladder.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.451
It's essentially unheard of.

17:19.491 --> 17:22.793
I've never seen that in my clinical practice in a man in his 50s.

17:23.654 --> 17:26.296
This is a very, very serious surgery.

17:26.872 --> 17:31.697
You have to take part of the colon, refashion a bladder, connect the ureters, the urethra.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.939
This is a big deal.

17:33.960 --> 17:41.207
It's actually a modern surgical miracle that he's had complete extirpation of the bladder.

17:42.108 --> 17:44.550
But we have to ask the question, why?

17:45.250 --> 18:03.624
And until oncologists and surgeons and the victims themselves, until they ask the question, could the COVID-19 vaccine be related to what we call a turbo cancer, that is a very aggressive cancer, we're not going to get a level set on reality.

18:03.664 --> 18:11.330
There are now thousands of papers pointing to the fact that the new genetic messenger RNA vaccines could promote cancer.

18:12.759 --> 18:27.755
Now there is a problem, sorry I didn't mean to do that, there is a problem with this and I want to point it out quick because of course the underlying narrative here which ties back to the traitor, scripted traitor from the Human Genome Project named Kevin McKernan,

18:28.663 --> 18:36.866
who is running around the internet telling everybody that there's DNA plasmids that contain a specific sequence, which is called SV40.

18:37.706 --> 18:46.649
And this SV40 promoter is what's going to be molecularly blamed as a mechanism behind these turbo cancers.

18:46.829 --> 18:52.170
Even though Dr. Peter McCullough doesn't drop that, that is absolutely for certain, 100% the script that he is on.

18:54.585 --> 19:01.086
And if he was pressed by that interviewer by an unexpected question about it, that is precisely the answer he would give.

19:02.247 --> 19:03.507
Now make no mistake about it.

19:03.567 --> 19:06.788
I really do believe that Peter McCullough is a scripted bullshitter.

19:07.468 --> 19:11.389
I do not think he can be characterized as being unwitting anymore.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.069
Um, he might not want to know all the details.

19:14.109 --> 19:21.091
He might not have asked any questions cause he doesn't want to know all the details, but he definitely knows where the third rails of the narrative are.

19:21.551 --> 19:31.315
He will never say what he said about three years ago, one time on an obscure podcast, that if he was challenged to do it again, he wouldn't do any of the vaccines.

19:31.355 --> 19:32.135
He'll never say that.

19:32.175 --> 19:33.115
Don't worry, he won't.

19:34.056 --> 19:35.436
I don't know why that advanced.

19:36.937 --> 19:40.798
Oh yeah, it's time for the intro.

19:40.958 --> 19:41.838
That's right, cool.

19:42.239 --> 19:48.901
I don't care how you get there.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.637
I don't care what you do to get there.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.259
The goal is to win.

20:06.536 --> 20:08.377
All right, let's get this started, okay?

20:08.417 --> 20:09.878
We got a lot of work to do today.

20:10.278 --> 20:13.539
I'm just going to push it and see how far I can go with it.

20:13.739 --> 20:15.220
If I have to stop talking, I will.

20:16.601 --> 20:20.063
I'm really excited today because I think they're starting to make mistakes.

20:20.923 --> 20:26.666
I think they're starting to really make mistakes and I think there's an opportunity here to show our kids

20:27.526 --> 20:33.131
and to show everyone on earth and expose them for what they are, these frauds.

20:34.232 --> 20:39.337
And I think we can do it on a mass scale if we can share the messages that we're putting down.

20:40.618 --> 20:42.840
Rule by podcast definitely continues.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.321
That's for sure.

20:44.341 --> 20:54.150
And it is something that we can stop because we can show them that these people are frauds on Robert Malone's really dumb script.

20:55.154 --> 20:57.375
That's really the most magnificent thing about it.

20:57.455 --> 21:08.781
They're so trusting in the script they got from Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan that they go forward knowing that it won for the last four years, assuming that it will win for four more years.

21:10.422 --> 21:12.623
It is absolutely remarkable.

21:12.683 --> 21:15.244
There's no other way to describe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:15.304 --> 21:16.105
other than being a

21:17.043 --> 21:20.825
a person who has trusted a script for a very long time.

21:22.446 --> 21:25.648
And these other two characters, boy, I don't even know what to say.

21:25.668 --> 21:28.810
I don't have anything nice to say, so my grandma would say I shouldn't say anything.

21:29.470 --> 21:35.374
These actors were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure any damage from transfection could be blamed effectively on the novel virus.

21:35.874 --> 21:40.056
These people were scripted by Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, and other employees of the U.S.

21:40.076 --> 21:40.476
government.

21:41.357 --> 21:46.600
The ghost of health freedom is part of the way you're being managed and being governed on social media.

21:47.140 --> 21:51.342
And they maintain the illusion of consensus by sticking to the provided script.

21:54.724 --> 22:01.108
And so if you stay focused on the biology, don't take their bait, and love your neighbor, you might be able to see through the Scooby-Doo mystery.

22:01.148 --> 22:07.671
But we are still, still being fooled by the mystery, the ghost of health freedom.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.854
The ghost of health freedom is really

22:12.714 --> 22:13.414
is living on.

22:13.475 --> 22:24.340
The real ghosts of health freedom are Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn, both dead in 2020, probably murdered in order that these people might get on with the show, in order that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.761
might make a run for the White House.

22:26.502 --> 22:27.242
I shit you not.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.704
That's really what we are on here.

22:31.804 --> 22:38.408
There is a fake health freedom movement because intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

22:38.688 --> 22:41.470
There is a fake health freedom movement in America because

22:42.270 --> 22:49.048
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mythology because pandemics and gain of function are mythologies.

22:50.046 --> 23:08.251
And the failure that is Children's Health Defense and ICANN can be clearly seen in the fact that they, in all their work and millions of dollars and high salaries and potentially hundreds of employees, they've never managed to score these touchdowns.

23:08.731 --> 23:10.312
They've just never managed to do it.

23:11.012 --> 23:17.514
And that reveals almost all of their long-term employees as being scripted traitors.

23:18.414 --> 23:28.063
They at some point had to know that they were not playing the right game, that they were taking a big salary from an organization that wasn't going to win.

23:28.864 --> 23:34.228
And I think that all of these people deserve to suffer for the rest of their lives the kind of public scorn

23:35.009 --> 23:37.590
that traitors and frauds deserve.

23:37.870 --> 23:38.710
I mean, I really do.

23:39.791 --> 23:42.091
And right now, I think there are some in our chat.

23:42.151 --> 23:52.235
I mean, it's almost certain that even in the chat of this show, there are people who essentially played along with the fake health freedom movement, even long after they knew

23:52.864 --> 23:54.885
that the fake health freedom movement was fake.

23:55.705 --> 24:00.266
And these people, they deserve rotten vegetables for the rest of their lives.

24:00.326 --> 24:01.707
I believe that wholeheartedly.

24:02.307 --> 24:15.591
Because once you're sticking to the provided script that, you know, you just say it really stupid simple, like vaccines cause autism, you deserve to be slapped upside your head for the rest of your life every time you show your face in public.

24:15.771 --> 24:16.852
I really do believe that.

24:17.492 --> 24:23.016
I don't think any of the people that I met at CHD at this point can excuse themselves.

24:23.056 --> 24:25.117
And it doesn't even matter if they have sick kids.

24:26.018 --> 24:27.619
I'll say it very, very plainly.

24:27.699 --> 24:33.963
If you have sick kids, then you should even be more ashamed of yourself because you know what you were trying to stop.

24:36.705 --> 24:38.206
But you can tell if someone's lying.

24:38.426 --> 24:39.067
You definitely can.

24:39.107 --> 24:40.568
You can sort of feel it in people.

24:42.418 --> 24:43.118
And I have lied.

24:43.138 --> 24:44.178
I'm sure I'll lie again.

24:44.198 --> 24:45.139
I don't want to lie.

24:45.619 --> 24:46.959
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

24:47.079 --> 24:48.099
I try not to be a liar.

24:48.119 --> 24:48.980
I don't want to be a liar.

24:49.540 --> 24:52.321
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

24:52.501 --> 25:01.823
It is definitely important not to be a liar and you need to understand that all of these organizations are headed by, run by, or coordinated by people who are lying.

25:02.665 --> 25:04.346
They are on a provided script.

25:04.947 --> 25:06.248
And there is no exception.

25:06.888 --> 25:12.452
Not one of these organizations, I can name the names because I've shaken their hand.

25:12.932 --> 25:17.236
And that includes the NCI, the National Citizens Inquiry in Canada.

25:17.276 --> 25:20.378
That includes the World Council for Health.

25:21.098 --> 25:22.760
Of course, that includes CHD.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.863
Of course, that includes ICANN, but it also includes PANDA and Nick Hudson.

25:27.762 --> 25:39.344
and Jonathan Engler, who's also of Heart, where Claire Craig, the genome collector, has founded an organization, coordinated by and scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

25:40.344 --> 25:46.225
Their connections are very easy to see, because you can look across time to see them cooperating.

25:46.906 --> 25:52.867
These people probably deserve jail, but they definitely deserve, like, life pain.

25:55.202 --> 26:01.005
People like Brett Weinstein deserve really the worst that karma has to offer.

26:01.065 --> 26:02.466
They are not serious people.

26:02.946 --> 26:10.249
They were people that were offered an opportunity to lie and get ahead, and they took that opportunity to lie and get ahead.

26:10.710 --> 26:12.811
And I'm not pulling punches anymore.

26:12.871 --> 26:13.771
That's what they do.

26:14.251 --> 26:21.055
They lie about why people die in order to get ahead, in order to get paid, in order to be a part of our governance.

26:21.795 --> 26:28.669
because we are being ruled by podcast in America and they would like to rule the rest of the world by podcast if they're dumb enough.

26:30.267 --> 26:31.568
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

26:31.588 --> 26:35.610
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

26:36.230 --> 26:39.552
Intramuscular injection as medicine is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

26:39.612 --> 26:44.954
Autism, spectrum disorder, and pandemics and gain of function are all mythologies used to disguise that.

26:45.074 --> 26:51.798
No one you know, no one you know has gotten as far as me to be in a picture with

26:52.498 --> 27:01.099
with Suzanne Humphries and Paul Thomas and James Lyons-Weiler and Polly Tommy and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:01.880 --> 27:02.860
and Brian Hooker.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.740
Nobody has gotten this far.

27:06.000 --> 27:16.322
And the only reason why you don't know how far I got is because all of these people in the picture are maintaining the illusion of consensus and sticking to the provided script.

27:17.302 --> 27:21.663
At least two of people in this picture could be actively speaking out.

27:22.819 --> 27:25.502
Laura Bono could be writing editorials.

27:26.923 --> 27:36.151
Jackie Haynes could be writing editorials and telling the truth about their time at CHD and why they don't believe in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:36.231 --> 27:37.352
and the movement anymore.

27:37.913 --> 27:42.377
Why they think they were bamboozled, but they're not.

27:44.764 --> 27:50.508
I know it's a very rough pill to swallow, ladies and gentlemen, that this was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

27:50.568 --> 27:52.509
They saw it coming for more than two decades.

27:53.049 --> 27:59.833
And because it was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, they told lots of stories about pandemics and about public health.

28:00.494 --> 28:07.818
And those pandemic stories started around 2002, continued into 2003 and four, and then doubled down again in 2012.

28:08.299 --> 28:12.961
And yes, I'm talking about SARS and then MERS.

28:14.042 --> 28:23.185
And we got to 2020 and you can see the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality coming and blossoming at the top of the population pyramid.

28:23.225 --> 28:24.846
And here we are in 2025.

28:25.366 --> 28:28.207
And lo and behold, that flower still needs to blossom.

28:31.434 --> 28:38.736
Yes, the spontaneous growth rate or the spontaneous birth rate might be decreasing, but you see it.

28:38.956 --> 28:40.317
You saw what happened here.

28:41.097 --> 28:42.697
And they knew it was going to happen.

28:43.197 --> 28:45.158
And they orchestrated this theater around it.

28:45.218 --> 28:56.461
Now, what's important to understand is that none of these people have taken the time to assemble a list to describe the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and how it was sculpted by manslaughter and lies.

28:56.721 --> 28:57.822
Only Mark Kulak

28:58.662 --> 29:14.813
and Jonathan Cooley of GigaOM Biological have bothered to put together a list like this, never mind showing you how the math of life expectancy in America, for example, is an equation that only really needs one variable, opioid deaths.

29:15.633 --> 29:17.814
The loss of control of

29:19.420 --> 29:27.746
pneumonia during the pandemic, depicted here in the bright red, only needs the lack of antibiotic use to be explained.

29:28.466 --> 29:39.634
And so almost all of the signal that was construed as a pandemic can be described by two simple variables that absolutely positively everyone

29:40.290 --> 29:51.920
from Denny Rancor all the way to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from Charles the shithead, Sewell's shoe salesman, Rixey, all the way to the grocery store clerk, Alex Zeck.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.901
They just don't know.

29:54.261 --> 29:55.482
They can't figure it out.

29:55.663 --> 30:02.448
Instead, they're stuck on so many other hamster wheels that get no justice for the murdered.

30:03.609 --> 30:04.770
Don't even acknowledge them.

30:07.824 --> 30:08.804
It's impossible.

30:08.964 --> 30:14.026
Several studies have found that Americans are drinking far more than they did in previous years.

30:14.386 --> 30:20.888
One substance abuse doctor calls it an epidemic in a pandemic, and women in particular are consuming more alcohol.

30:21.208 --> 30:25.169
News 8's Abby Alford looks into why it's happening and what women can do to seek help.

30:34.033 --> 30:41.000
It's funny, but it's not, because actually this is the kind of thing that was necessary in order to manage the population pyramid.

30:41.521 --> 30:43.423
You don't need to go out and kill people.

30:43.943 --> 30:49.709
You just need to turn knobs that will increase the all-cause mortality in America.

30:50.669 --> 31:07.582
turning knobs like, you know, there's a virus that, that antibiotics would be inappropriate for is a pretty good knob to turn, but you can also turn the knob of alcoholism and drug abuse through a combination of lockdown and social media posting.

31:08.202 --> 31:16.028
And, and of course the, the opioid orchestrated crisis of the CDC that preceded the pandemic by about two years.

31:18.993 --> 31:23.076
This was orchestrated, and they talked about it, kind of.

31:23.557 --> 31:25.058
They talked about it, sort of.

31:25.438 --> 31:29.802
They told you some of the stuff they were doing, but the really big adjustments.

31:31.616 --> 31:32.977
Those were completely missed.

31:33.057 --> 31:45.748
Apparently everybody from Robert Malone to Kevin McKernan to Peter McCullough to Jessica Rose couldn't figure out how life expectancy could be so drastically adjusted using the opioid crisis alone.

31:46.148 --> 31:55.816
How drastically deaths in hospitals to pneumonia would go up if you just told people that if it's COVID you can't use antibiotics.

31:55.856 --> 31:56.717
But that's what they did.

32:01.434 --> 32:03.057
And so these stories were around.

32:03.097 --> 32:08.866
Dr. Brian Cooley says that women often ignore addiction because there's this stigma that you're weak.

32:09.046 --> 32:10.809
This guy's Dr. Brian Cooley.

32:11.584 --> 32:13.605
That dude apparently is Dr. Brian Cooey.

32:13.625 --> 32:15.306
They even spell it C-O-U-E-Y.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.167
It's really kind of funny.

32:16.187 --> 32:16.487
This is from 2021.

32:16.527 --> 32:18.188
So alcoholism went crazy during the pandemic.

32:18.288 --> 32:22.170
You're not going to escape until you understand the trap you're in.

32:34.719 --> 32:52.425
Social media allows government agents and private interests to put coordinated liars in front of you on podcasts and on disparate podcasts, on opposing podcasts, and get you to believe in one side of a narrative or another.

32:52.465 --> 32:56.607
And you don't have to see it as simple as blue and red because some of them are shared by both sides.

32:58.968 --> 33:02.049
I'm just gonna give you kind of a rudimentary example of what I mean.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.476
This is the red narrative in America right now.

33:05.536 --> 33:08.999
Vaccines can hurt people, but it's not even super rare.

33:10.320 --> 33:17.267
Viruses can cause pandemics that ruin sequential years of high school or college, and governments can release them by accident or on purpose.

33:17.964 --> 33:18.925
This is the red side.

33:19.605 --> 33:24.509
The government is dysfunctional, mostly because things that shouldn't be partisan are often made to be, i.e.

33:25.109 --> 33:25.710
science stuff.

33:26.250 --> 33:34.456
The world is run by the smartest people who are also the richest people, some of whom, like politicians, are controlled by blackmail with young girls on islands.

33:35.557 --> 33:38.840
Humans are currently destroying the planet, but global warming is not real.

33:39.380 --> 33:45.665
Potentially hundreds of thousands have been killed in the Middle East geographic region known as the Gaza Strip.

33:47.202 --> 33:50.164
We are obligated to help everyone on earth, but let's start local.

33:50.604 --> 33:53.946
China and Russia, they are enemies and Iran can't have stuff.

33:54.907 --> 33:58.869
And the Trump administration is going to start saving America very soon.

34:00.230 --> 34:12.317
So this is the conservative narrative that Steve Bannon is selling, that Alex Jones is selling, that Mary Talley Bowden is selling, that Robert Malone is selling on Substack and elsewhere.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.039
Here's the blue narrative.

34:16.448 --> 34:18.690
Vaccines can hurt people, but it's super rare.

34:20.292 --> 34:24.797
Viruses can cause pandemics that can ruin sequential years of high school or college.

34:25.557 --> 34:30.022
Government is dysfunctional mostly because things that shouldn't be partisan are often made to be, i.e.

34:30.082 --> 34:30.723
science stuff.

34:31.323 --> 34:38.230
The world is run by the smartest people who are also the richest, some of whom, like politicians, are controlled by blackmail with young girls on islands.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.712
Humans are currently destroying the planet.

34:41.192 --> 34:46.495
Potentially hundreds of thousands have been killed in the Middle East geographic area known as the Jaguars Strip.

34:47.136 --> 34:48.957
We are obligated to help everyone on earth.

34:49.877 --> 34:51.778
China and Russia is an enemy.

34:52.378 --> 34:53.799
Iran cannot have stuff.

34:54.340 --> 34:57.281
And the Trump administration is destroying America.

34:58.842 --> 34:59.402
Can you see it?

35:01.063 --> 35:02.004
It's so different.

35:02.064 --> 35:03.184
We're so split.

35:04.045 --> 35:06.106
I mean, America's almost torn in half.

35:06.706 --> 35:07.347
Stop lying.

35:09.605 --> 35:23.236
lying we believe all the same shit absolutely positively all the same shit and we disagree about a bunch of shit that doesn't even really matter that much and we're convinced that it's the opposite

35:28.732 --> 35:48.005
Now I think we made some very big changes here by calling attention to these two scripted morons, actually three, calling attention to their foreign-born nature, to their ridiculous behavior during the pandemic which included years of podcasting, selling books,

35:48.966 --> 35:55.190
Years of podcasting, talking about the narrative, asking the wrong questions.

35:55.210 --> 36:07.258
He literally years of podcasting with really scripted assholes and together years of podcasting.

36:10.220 --> 36:14.002
And then when the murder stopped, no more podcasting.

36:15.263 --> 36:15.403
Hmm.

36:16.638 --> 36:24.187
And then when the Trump administration and the Kennedy for president started some more podcasting, huh?

36:24.668 --> 36:26.370
Crazy, interesting.

36:26.971 --> 36:28.373
I don't know if there's a pattern there or not.

36:28.393 --> 36:29.254
It's kind of hard to see.

36:36.417 --> 36:38.279
So I think we got this to happen.

36:38.319 --> 36:53.231
I think this is script changes, damage control, and they want you to believe that Laura Loomer and Aaron Seery that were calling him out on stuff and whatever, that that's how it happened.

36:53.271 --> 36:55.593
They just had to get rid of him, he abruptly.

36:56.073 --> 37:02.919
But the New York Times saying that right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had part in this,

37:04.241 --> 37:07.664
shows you that this is all one malevolent show.

37:07.784 --> 37:10.045
It shows you exactly what's going on here.

37:10.085 --> 37:22.655
Remember, Robert Malone seeded the career of multiple New York Times reporters during his long, you know, honored career as a bioethicist.

37:23.820 --> 37:30.167
And so the New York Times, of course, is a clown show, but they're even willing to print Laura Loomer's name.

37:30.207 --> 37:42.980
Laura Loomer, of course, was auditioning in 2019 with the same set of ridiculous podcasters that Soph, the daughter of Sasha Latupova, was auditioning with.

37:44.019 --> 37:50.020
that got her on Alex Jones three times in 2019 before the pandemic started.

37:50.080 --> 37:54.681
Got her famous for having threatened to kill the YouTube CEO.

37:56.161 --> 37:59.962
Lost a million subscribers on YouTube supposedly for that action.

38:00.022 --> 38:13.064
That's Soph, the daughter of Sasha Latupova, who is connected professionally to Laura Loomer, to the same production company, on the same thumbnails.

38:17.776 --> 38:19.609
This is definitely a scripted change.

38:19.669 --> 38:20.656
It's definitely...

38:21.829 --> 38:29.870
It's definitely damage control to this provided script and it's not gonna work, but it's because the damage control is gonna work.

38:30.290 --> 38:32.711
They already blew it with Suzanne Humphries.

38:32.771 --> 38:33.791
We destroyed her.

38:34.411 --> 38:48.053
Her inability to say anything useful for three hours on the Joe Rogan podcast has permanently labeled her as a scripted traitor to our grandchildren and somebody who has been grifting off of this mess for way too long.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.134
She's a real awful person.

38:52.603 --> 38:58.107
And everybody on this screen is really an awful person, because now they know.

38:58.788 --> 39:01.950
Even if they didn't know at the beginning, they know now.

39:02.751 --> 39:08.756
And by sticking to the provided script... I mean, those companies, you know, we have a free market system in this country.

39:08.816 --> 39:13.880
And part of that is that there's consequences if you make a bad product.

39:14.860 --> 39:19.643
And, you know, vaccines are particularly exempt from that because there's no free market economy.

39:20.443 --> 39:23.845
Normally, if you get poisoned by Coca-Cola, you can stop drinking Coca-Cola.

39:24.764 --> 39:29.927
If you get poisoned by a vaccine, your kids still have to take that vaccine to get to the school.

39:29.947 --> 39:44.214
If you're a doctor, there is no possible way that in two decades of advocating for children's health in one way or another, that this is all the farther he's gotten, that this is his best metaphor as a lawyer and activist.

39:45.495 --> 39:47.737
This is such a tremendous failure.

39:48.517 --> 39:56.703
And the fact that he is willing to say these things and read this script and memorize it, essentially tells you that he's an idiot.

39:57.344 --> 40:01.327
I hate to be a dick about it, but I don't think he's very smart.

40:03.408 --> 40:08.472
He's just good at remembering words, you know, like actors are.

40:13.342 --> 40:18.329
your child will die because you can look and see what happened to elder siblings.

40:18.369 --> 40:22.976
There's some kind of genetic vulnerability that's affected the older siblings.

40:23.176 --> 40:24.658
And the doctor wants to tell you,

40:26.204 --> 40:28.605
your third child should not take this vaccine.

40:29.025 --> 40:30.326
He's going to be punished for that.

40:31.126 --> 40:32.087
That is a lie.

40:32.707 --> 40:33.648
This is a lie.

40:33.728 --> 40:38.850
This is a scripted lie that is scripted by a human genome project participant.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.211
There's no doubt in my mind.

40:40.871 --> 40:47.894
What he's trying to tell you is that there might be evidence in the family where the first two siblings got injured in some way.

40:48.354 --> 40:51.476
And so that's an indication that there's a genetic vulnerability.

40:54.434 --> 41:02.797
It's a complex environmental and genetic symphony that determines whether or not kids get autism in a day after the MMR shot.

41:03.397 --> 41:04.158
Stop lying!

41:05.698 --> 41:08.819
I cannot tell you how awful it is what he just said.

41:10.180 --> 41:15.502
It is some of the absolute worst shit I've ever heard come out of his mouth.

41:15.582 --> 41:16.582
This is awful.

41:17.963 --> 41:18.563
It hurts me.

41:20.091 --> 41:23.432
I feel like a gut punch when I hear that.

41:23.572 --> 41:26.534
I did not listen to this video because it's Charlie Kirk.

41:26.574 --> 41:27.974
I knew it would be something interesting.

41:28.894 --> 41:29.875
That's ridiculous.

41:31.315 --> 41:39.058
That is a very specific case where intramuscular injection being dumb apparently doesn't matter at all.

41:39.118 --> 41:43.920
It's just whether or not you have, you know, some evidence from previous kids.

41:44.420 --> 41:47.982
And then maybe we should at least give an exception to those parents.

41:48.860 --> 41:49.685
Stop lying!

41:49.946 --> 41:51.072
Holy shit!

41:52.930 --> 41:56.452
but also the schools won't let you go to school no matter what.

41:56.672 --> 42:07.077
So in New York and California, there's not only no religious exemptions, there's no philosophical exemptions, but there also effectively is no medical exemption.

42:07.757 --> 42:20.243
So these kids, it's mandated, and because it's mandated, there's no market forces that tell you, that allow you, if you don't like the product, if you have reservations about it, you can't stop using it.

42:20.343 --> 42:21.564
You gotta take it anyway.

42:22.384 --> 42:41.839
so the things that that and then you know you have of course the the mainstream media is is bought and brain dead when it comes to these issues they will not criticize they will not report vaccine injury the uh the congress is sorry with the so so you have no of them none of the market forces that apply and make

42:42.877 --> 42:44.578
other products safe.

42:45.458 --> 42:48.780
There is zero incentive for these companies to make them safe.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.501
They don't get punished for it in the market.

42:51.541 --> 42:54.282
They don't get punished for it in the court.

42:54.462 --> 43:03.706
See, I'm seeing it clearer every minute because the companies can't make intramuscular injection of a combination of substances safe.

43:06.087 --> 43:11.489
The companies cannot make intramuscular injection of a combination of substances safe.

43:13.390 --> 43:18.615
They can't because intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

43:20.697 --> 43:32.308
And so this is the hamster wheel that these absolutely scripted frauds have kept us in for more than a decade.

43:34.753 --> 43:38.435
CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:38.655 --> 43:57.846
and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and all the other employees of CHD that met me while I worked there and heard me in a Zoom meeting know by now that there are better ways to say it if your goal is to end it.

44:00.507 --> 44:04.149
There are better ways to say it if the goal is to teach it.

44:06.049 --> 44:12.631
There are better ways to say it if the goal is to win and these people don't ever do it.

44:13.591 --> 44:16.112
How many podcasts has he been on since the election?

44:17.812 --> 44:21.313
How many times has he had a chance speaking in front of a live camera?

44:25.934 --> 44:31.316
Suzanne Humphries had three hours on the biggest podcast on earth.

44:33.345 --> 44:35.890
and couldn't say it in 2025.

44:37.192 --> 44:38.614
Make no mistake about it.

44:39.276 --> 44:42.481
The fake health freedom movement needs to be ended.

44:44.024 --> 44:46.168
The hamster wheel needs to be broken.

44:49.696 --> 45:05.201
So, you know, what we're going to try to do is to make sure that the parents who do get injured get compensation, that they get it very quickly and they get it without the kind of adversarial impediments that have now been erected over the past 40 years.

45:10.482 --> 45:19.265
So I think one of the most revealing videos was this 2017 video that I showed you with with with

45:20.140 --> 45:27.761
with Del Bigtree and Tony Bark and Judy Mikovits and this Paul Thomas guy.

45:28.822 --> 45:33.362
These are some of the worst people on earth because they signed up for this mess.

45:33.762 --> 45:39.783
And there is no doubt in my mind that the pandemic was part of what they signed up for.

45:42.084 --> 45:43.164
That's how you have to see it.

45:43.204 --> 45:48.145
Whether they knew it or not, that's what they had to have known when the pandemic kicked off.

45:48.205 --> 45:48.865
They had to know.

45:49.790 --> 45:55.276
They had to know, even if they didn't know before the pandemic kicked off that it was going to kick off.

45:55.356 --> 45:58.479
Once it kicked off, they had to know that, holy shit.

45:59.961 --> 46:02.444
I might've not wanted to join this team.

46:03.104 --> 46:05.307
Um, uh, can I turn in my Jersey?

46:05.327 --> 46:05.367
No.

46:08.672 --> 46:09.792
No, no, no, no.

46:10.493 --> 46:12.973
Ladies and gentlemen, this is as dark as it gets.

46:13.513 --> 46:18.615
Um, this is the hamster wheel and it's only a spectacular commitment to lies that is required.

46:19.475 --> 46:21.415
Um, this video, I should have just gotten rid of that.

46:22.376 --> 46:29.338
I really think that the fake health freedom movement was started by murdering Tony bark and Brandy Vaughn.

46:29.978 --> 46:36.199
Um, they had to be out of the way before these people could, could lift Robert F. Kennedy jr.

46:36.279 --> 46:37.180
Toward the white house.

46:37.840 --> 46:37.940
Um,

46:40.143 --> 46:40.883
It's really bad.

46:41.484 --> 46:42.624
I think we have to start here.

46:43.864 --> 46:46.005
Um, I think we have to start with the calendar.

46:46.325 --> 46:56.529
And so if we're going to learn about, um, 10 penny, uh, we have to learn about Alex, Zach, the guy that she just interviewed with, cause that's the interview that I'm interested in.

46:56.809 --> 47:03.472
And yesterday I mentioned, uh, 10 penny with regard to this meeting with Larry and with, with Lee merit.

47:04.515 --> 47:18.127
where they're talking about Robert Malone being a pretty reasonable guy and and being in a signal chat with Robert Malone and Tony Lyons and and Meryl Ness and so I want to watch This video.

47:18.768 --> 47:19.148
All right.

47:19.188 --> 47:20.369
What's up everyone today?

47:20.569 --> 47:25.574
I want to watch this video from 2021 because here is a video of Alex Zeck and

47:27.198 --> 47:40.394
One of the no virus people that was in this group of five that did some kind of response to me, which was really just a bullshit response, didn't mean anything, didn't say anything, didn't solve any problems or answer any questions.

47:41.295 --> 47:55.386
And that was around the same time, the same year, or year and a half, probably a year, where I was also on with Malone, Nass, Tess Laurie, and Jessica Rose, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., all in one.

47:56.227 --> 48:04.072
And I was also on a Zoom with Kevin McKernan, and Stephanie Seneff, and John Bodwin, and Jessica, excuse me.

48:05.106 --> 48:33.499
jessica rose and then there was also this no virus thing with with bailey and massey and um bailey and massey and uh cowan and um and zeck and and and and uh and andrew kaufman so all five of them so there's no one else on earth no one else on earth for whom

48:35.140 --> 48:41.604
Jessica Rose, Kevin McKernan, Stephanie Seneff, and John Baldwin got together to talk about their ideas.

48:42.224 --> 48:50.229
Nobody else was able to assemble Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Tess Laurie, and Jessica Rose, just me.

48:50.790 --> 49:02.617
And no one, no one was able to bring together the no virus people, Tom Cowan, Andy Kaufman, Mark Bailey, Christine Massey, and Alex Zek.

49:02.677 --> 49:04.418
No one, no one else.

49:08.157 --> 49:09.838
And I think that's how you see it.

49:11.459 --> 49:23.387
They used their best weapon against me three times or more, which is a group of people on a coordinated script of lies, pretending not to be.

49:24.307 --> 49:28.250
They use that on me more than anyone else on the planet.

49:30.531 --> 49:31.472
Just think about that.

49:31.972 --> 49:35.154
And then let's watch Alex Zeck and find out what he thought in 2021.

49:36.328 --> 49:40.070
Today, I am interviewing one of my good friends, Alex Zek.

49:41.050 --> 49:41.830
Many of you know him.

49:41.890 --> 49:46.592
He's also a grocery store manager as of recent.

49:50.094 --> 49:51.114
We got shut down though.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.335
We were selling boomers.

49:53.355 --> 49:55.796
We were selling shrooms out of the pack, so they shut us down.

49:57.917 --> 49:58.577
Yeah, yeah.

49:58.617 --> 50:02.879
You were selling vitamin D and zinc, and that's really dangerous, so we couldn't do that.

50:05.581 --> 50:25.161
So, Alec, and for you guys watching, I had a thought last week and I just acted on that impulse of going, you know, there's a lot that I don't know about germ theory, terrain theory, and what's going on

50:25.709 --> 50:28.632
with vaccines and this and COVID.

50:30.213 --> 50:36.739
And I've done a fair amount of due diligence and attempting to decipher truth from falsehood.

50:37.920 --> 50:48.409
And I'm sitting there going, okay, I want to be able to not just share information that I believe in and resonate with that I believe is innately empowering.

50:49.446 --> 51:00.554
I want to share a perspective of how to continue to have conversations like this with those that don't see it your way, because that's something that Alec, you are incredibly good at doing.

51:00.574 --> 51:02.896
That is really the point.

51:02.976 --> 51:04.777
It's not about right and wrong.

51:04.797 --> 51:11.722
It's about this process of getting to what we might call the truth.

51:12.322 --> 51:23.035
an inner standing getting to an individual inner standing an inner standing an inner standing wow is that the stupidest shit i've ever heard um

51:24.295 --> 51:26.177
Again, this is so guru ish.

51:26.958 --> 51:29.860
The language that that guy was using was so guru ish.

51:31.041 --> 51:40.830
They use words like paradigm and resonate and resonance and, and, and it is just, it is really bullshit.

51:41.531 --> 51:43.072
I don't know how to say it any other way.

51:43.653 --> 51:46.115
That guy already made me sick a little bit.

51:46.395 --> 51:47.436
Yeah, yeah.

51:48.377 --> 52:08.484
so let's just start with like what led you to get on that impulse of going no we were selling uh we're selling boomers we're selling shrooms out of the pack so they shut us down yeah yeah you were selling you know vitamin b and zinc and that's really dangerous so so that's a reference to psychedelics just so you know right that's not

52:09.224 --> 52:12.066
That's exactly in line with the new age retards.

52:12.106 --> 52:16.389
That's exactly in line with the dope, the bullshit that, that Rogan is talking.

52:16.449 --> 52:19.511
That's exactly in line with, with all of these people.

52:20.591 --> 52:23.653
I'm not advocating for or going against psychedelics.

52:23.713 --> 52:26.835
I'm just telling you that that's the same narrative.

52:26.975 --> 52:30.858
It's the same free space with natural something, something or others.

52:33.982 --> 52:35.923
None of these people are talking about God.

52:36.183 --> 52:38.204
None of these people are talking about faith.

52:38.324 --> 52:44.046
None of these people are talking about, you know, it's really, really new agey shit.

52:44.886 --> 52:47.007
And it's scripted bullshit is what it is.

52:47.567 --> 52:49.628
These are frauds.

52:52.289 --> 53:01.373
So Alec, and for you guys watching, um, I had a thought last week and I just acted on that impulse of going, you know,

53:02.873 --> 53:15.341
There's a lot that I don't know about germ theory, terrain theory, and what's going on with vaccines and COVID.

53:16.922 --> 53:23.426
And I've done a fair amount of due diligence in attempting to decipher truth from falsehood.

53:23.446 --> 53:28.249
And I'm sitting there going, okay, I want to be able to not just

53:29.386 --> 53:39.425
share information that I, as above so below bitches, believe in and resonate with that I believe is innately empowering.

53:40.484 --> 53:51.593
I want to share a perspective of how to continue to have conversations like this with those that don't see it your way, because that's something that Alec, you are incredibly good at doing.

53:52.174 --> 53:53.935
That is really the point.

53:54.015 --> 53:55.837
It's not about right and wrong.

53:56.557 --> 54:02.763
It's about this process of getting to what we might call the truth.

54:03.343 --> 54:07.605
An inner standing, getting to an individual inner standing as like, yeah.

54:08.225 --> 54:08.465
Yeah.

54:09.386 --> 54:19.810
So let's just start with like, what, what led you to the pursuit where you just, we were just talking about, um, your, the impulse of looking up germ theory and terrain theory.

54:19.870 --> 54:23.512
What, what led you to going down that path?

54:24.221 --> 54:37.077
Man, this is such a good question because, so like previous to going down the route of understanding terrain theory, in our life we were already living in that manner and we didn't know it.

54:37.117 --> 54:43.705
Like we had already come to understand like the nefarious intentions behind the pharmaceutical industry, come to understand the power of natural health.

54:44.846 --> 54:49.751
Like how the government and media are intertwined with big pharma already understood all of that.

54:50.051 --> 54:58.099
And, you know, I'll start with this when, when our son was born, we had begun exploring like vaccines just a little bit before he was born.

54:58.119 --> 55:01.942
We were like, okay, we're just going to hold off for a while because clearly there's something amiss here.

55:01.962 --> 55:07.047
And we had done a little bit of research, but when we decided not to vaccinate him,

55:08.004 --> 55:10.165
We were really scared about him being around other people.

55:10.185 --> 55:10.785
We're like, Oh my God.

55:10.805 --> 55:11.025
Okay.

55:11.045 --> 55:14.987
So he's not protected against these pathogenic germs.

55:15.887 --> 55:22.930
Um, but he also is not getting the poisons that we knew were in the shot, but we did think that there were some level of protection that they offered.

55:23.010 --> 55:23.210
Right.

55:23.230 --> 55:30.473
And then that gets into discussions on like, if you believe, like you fundamentally believe that they're going to offer protection and they might like, even when it comes to the CBO effect, exactly.

55:30.513 --> 55:33.455
Even when it comes to these shots, like I will, I will be clear on that, but.

55:34.515 --> 55:35.656
We were so scared.

55:35.696 --> 55:50.982
And then as time went on, and as he got older, and again, completely unvaccinated, and we were very focused on his nutrition, almost obsessively because we were so worried about keeping him healthy, but he would like lick other kids and, you know, like bite random things and just play in the dirt all day.

55:51.002 --> 55:52.643
And he never got sick.

55:53.476 --> 55:54.697
We're like, this is so strange.

55:54.717 --> 56:01.121
Like, okay, well, I guess just like a healthy immune system means that you won't get sick from these, these, uh, pathogens.

56:01.181 --> 56:01.341
Right.

56:01.661 --> 56:08.105
And that's like the traditional, uh, terrain theory approach, the traditional version of what most people think terrain theory is.

56:08.665 --> 56:10.026
Um, I guess there's like three camps.

56:10.106 --> 56:13.388
It's that you can see that he's looking down all the time, right?

56:13.428 --> 56:14.388
He has notes.

56:14.448 --> 56:17.170
He can't just have this discussion off the cuff.

56:17.951 --> 56:20.372
This is a scripted fraud.

56:22.825 --> 56:33.614
Germs are pathogenic disease causing agents and there's nothing that we can do except for defend against them via You know vaccine sanitizing everything and and staying away from other people when they're sick, right?

56:33.654 --> 56:36.717
That's like the germ theory approach, right?

56:36.777 --> 56:47.606
and then there's the traditional terrain theory camp that I was in prior to kovat that says okay these pathogenic viruses and traditional

56:49.574 --> 57:02.311
it's like the trad it's the trad terrain the trad terrain space i guess is what he would say it's called the trad terrain he was in the trad terrain space

57:03.968 --> 57:11.556
And then moved pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria are only pathogenic if you have a toxic internal system.

57:12.657 --> 57:17.503
And there's some nuance to that when it comes to bacteria which I'll get into where that is still somewhat true.

57:19.765 --> 57:34.337
the understanding that I've come to since then, that's a step above, with more actual research directed at this topic specifically, rather than other tertiary things like vaccines, which are predicated off of that, right?

57:35.978 --> 57:47.307
The more that I looked, the more that I was shocked, and the more that I pressed at that shock, pressing virologists and molecular biologists on this topic, the more that I was shocked even more.

57:47.347 --> 57:47.447
So

57:48.288 --> 58:11.866
The reason I can now think about the idea that for years and years and years these people have been pressing Have been pressing have been pressing Doctors and scientists about what what have they been pressing them about listen to this carefully because this is important Wait, where is it?

58:12.146 --> 58:12.807
Is it just there?

58:16.353 --> 58:18.175
Oh, this mouse is moving slow today.

58:18.555 --> 58:29.844
Came to this understanding and even like approach this topic is because I saw a video and topic specifically rather than other tertiary things like vaccines, which are predicated off of that.

58:29.884 --> 58:30.085
Right.

58:31.726 --> 58:43.195
The more that I looked, the more that I was shocked and the more that I pressed at that shock, pressing virologists and other and molecular biologists on this topic, the more that I was shocked even more so.

58:44.677 --> 58:55.024
So he was pressing virologists and pressing molecular biologists about terrain theory or traditional terrain space, about germ theory.

58:55.044 --> 58:58.147
And in fact, that's a very, very

58:59.147 --> 59:02.150
common theme among the no-virus people.

59:02.230 --> 59:07.294
This, you know, how thorough they were at pressing virologists to get a straight answer.

59:07.694 --> 59:10.296
How thorough they were at pressing for FOIA requests.

59:10.677 --> 59:15.901
How thorough they were at pressing for a true definition of isolation, purification, and culturing.

59:18.864 --> 59:23.247
But these people have never thought to thoroughly press doctors

59:24.181 --> 59:32.108
to justify intramuscular injection as a good way to administer a combination of substances intended to help you.

59:34.890 --> 59:47.641
It's so ridiculously simple relative to pressing virologists about the definition of virology, pressing the virologists about their details of whether or not isolation really means what they say it does.

59:49.861 --> 01:00:14.871
when it would be so much easier to just pressure every doctor in America to justify in their own mind and head with some studies or with some history about where exactly this idea of intramuscular injection came from and whether it was actually proven to be as versatile as they say it is, that you can inject almost anything intramuscularly and call it a vaccine.

01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:33.781
And the most important point to understand is that this guy was on stage earlier in 2021 with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and with Brian Artis, and with Tenpenny, and with Mikovits, and with Hooker.

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:45.631
And so there's no possible way that they're still not really able to say it really simply, that they still have to get all kinds of dumb complicated about it.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.162
Intramuscular injections, just a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:00:49.202 --> 01:00:57.147
It was never proven to be a universal mechanism or methodology by which we could augment our health.

01:00:58.028 --> 01:01:06.754
It worked really well for morphine, and then people at the time were too stupid to see that that was kind of an exception rather than a rule.

01:01:08.354 --> 01:01:19.777
and Mark Kulak and Jonathan Cui apparently are the first and only Americans to get to this finish line because Suzanne Humphreys never got here with multiple books.

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.057
Ten pennies, not getting here.

01:01:23.557 --> 01:01:24.898
She's got multiple books.

01:01:25.538 --> 01:01:27.618
Robert F. Kennedy never got here.

01:01:27.658 --> 01:01:28.979
He's got multiple books.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:34.880
Sky Horse Publishing never got here and they've got multiple books from Robert Malone alone.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.150
It gets worse.

01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:46.436
It's going to get a lot worse came to this understanding and even like approach this topic is because I saw a video.

01:01:47.196 --> 01:01:53.821
And I want to say, March or April of 2020, and it was Dr. Tom Cowan speaking.

01:01:54.581 --> 01:02:10.061
And in that video, Dr. Cowan was addressing, you know, if you were following a pod of dolphins off of the coast of Florida or somewhere, I don't remember the exact example you used, but if you're following a pod of dolphins and you notice a lot of the dolphins began dying,

01:02:10.902 --> 01:02:12.443
What would be your first reaction?

01:02:12.844 --> 01:02:16.146
And then someone in the audience answered, who put some shit in the water?

01:02:17.047 --> 01:02:17.868
Like, exactly.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:23.552
Our reaction isn't to say, oh, what virus is causing these dolphins to die?

01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:25.594
It's who put something in the water.

01:02:25.634 --> 01:02:27.015
How are these dolphins poisoned?

01:02:27.095 --> 01:02:34.321
Or maybe their food source was cut off because the food source was poisoned or they were in an area that was lacking on the food that they needed.

01:02:34.401 --> 01:02:34.561
Right.

01:02:35.362 --> 01:02:42.825
And that was such a, like, shocking, like, paradigm shift for me, but it made intuitive sense, because I was already... A paradigm shift for him.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:51.488
The... The Pod of Dolphins story from Tom Cowens was a paradigm shift for him.

01:02:52.048 --> 01:02:52.789
Stop lying!

01:02:53.069 --> 01:03:04.433
I mean, you must have, like, the intellectual depth of a loaf of bread if... if that analogy is a... results in a paradigm shift for you.

01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:12.814
If an analogy from Tom Cowan can result in a paradigm shift for you, you might be a dumbass.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:16.391
living in that way.

01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:17.512
I was like, oh my goodness.

01:03:18.512 --> 01:03:39.638
So like, it's not that the virus is, but then like the more that I explored it, because he didn't outright say like, look, my understanding now that for people who are not familiar with this, if I say viruses as pathogenic disease causing agents don't exist or haven't been proven to exist, that like that statement without the context is shocking.

01:03:39.678 --> 01:03:40.918
And that's not what I heard.

01:03:41.378 --> 01:03:42.799
I hadn't heard that statement until

01:03:44.099 --> 01:04:08.124
eight to nine months ago and i already had a foundational understanding of like some of this stuff so i was like huh like that sounds so outlandish and so the idea is is that he's made progress he's gone from i i don't know living you know uh what did he say he had he was living pretty well although he didn't know why really they were skeptical of pharma and they were skeptical of the media

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:16.226
And they had a kid and they kind of delayed vaccines and he, they were afraid that he would get sick, but he never got sick.

01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:22.167
So it doesn't really sound like he's learning anything.

01:04:22.608 --> 01:04:25.528
It doesn't really sound like he's peeling back any layers.

01:04:25.568 --> 01:04:33.690
And then he saw this video by Tom Cowan and heard this analogy about a pod of dolphins and who put shit in the water.

01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:36.211
And it changed his whole paradigm.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:42.878
I mean, we are dealing with a gas station attendant.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:44.200
Oh no, sorry.

01:04:44.841 --> 01:04:48.106
He's a grocery store clerk who sells mushrooms behind the scenes.

01:04:48.807 --> 01:04:50.289
He's totally a great kid.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:58.693
crazy, but I'm going to explore it because I'd heard that video from Dr. Cowan and have obsessively explored this basically throughout the entirety of COVID.

01:04:59.514 --> 01:05:14.441
So what I've come to understand based on exploring the evidence myself is that the foundational evidence for viruses as pathogenic disease causing agents comes from what is known as a cell culture, typically a virus.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:18.563
Listen to how many details he's got to tell you in order to explain it.

01:05:18.763 --> 01:05:19.704
Instead of saying,

01:05:21.932 --> 01:05:25.314
Intramuscular injections, just a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:05:25.434 --> 01:05:29.176
And so, we shouldn't do it.

01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:35.779
And that they tell you all these stories about viruses so that you get scared into doing it.

01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:43.963
That they make up these stories about autism so that you don't really figure it out.

01:05:44.944 --> 01:05:51.287
They haven't been able to explain to you why autism spectrum disorder could be a weaponized, ever-expanding idea

01:05:53.578 --> 01:06:00.841
You know, one of the things that crossed my mind the other day that just this morning that just really freaked me out was I heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:00.921 --> 01:06:07.664
say this bullshit line about how there are no 70-year-old autistic people.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.485
There are none in his generation.

01:06:11.266 --> 01:06:16.748
And that is disingenuous for a number of reasons, but the main one being that when I was a kid, we had retards.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.522
My dad was a special ed teacher and he worked with retards.

01:06:22.322 --> 01:06:26.165
He actually worked at a whole school in Indiana full of retards.

01:06:26.885 --> 01:06:33.029
And a lot of those kids were characterized as being severely retarded, severely mentally handicapped.

01:06:34.169 --> 01:06:40.173
And it was like halfway through my dad's career where he started saying we shouldn't use the word retarded anymore.

01:06:41.613 --> 01:06:44.615
but there were definitely retarded kids around.

01:06:45.315 --> 01:06:51.079
And we definitely know that retarded kids from the seventies didn't live as long as kids that weren't retarded.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:59.224
So the idea that there aren't 70 year old retards around, that's pretty understandable.

01:06:59.284 --> 01:07:00.504
Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:07:01.105 --> 01:07:02.926
And the fake health freedom movement.

01:07:05.097 --> 01:07:06.718
but it's a really shitty script.

01:07:07.018 --> 01:07:12.060
And so once you see how shitty it is, the brick wall is right in front of your face.

01:07:16.842 --> 01:07:19.083
Cell culture, which is done on a monkey kidney cell.

01:07:19.523 --> 01:07:24.385
I'll use an analogy that Dr. Cowan explained brilliantly in his book to describe it.

01:07:25.145 --> 01:07:34.669
If I were to try to prove that a- So he's selling Tom Cowan's book and he's trying to prove a negative.

01:07:35.953 --> 01:07:42.343
He's arguing with people who take evidence from PCR as being evidence of the existence of a full molecule.

01:07:45.239 --> 01:07:54.867
He's arguing with people about things that they can argue infinitely with them about on purpose because he is a scripted traitor to our grandkids.

01:07:54.947 --> 01:07:58.150
Ping pong ball could break down a brick wall.

01:07:59.271 --> 01:07:59.912
What would I do?

01:07:59.932 --> 01:08:09.160
I would probably need to observe that ping pong ball completely by itself, having action on that brick wall to see the causes of destruction of that brick.

01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:13.053
So yesterday, I showed you this video call yesterday.

01:08:14.434 --> 01:08:18.376
Yesterday, I think was yesterday, maybe Sunday.

01:08:18.556 --> 01:08:31.544
Anyways, conference call with this, with a whole bunch of people in the global wellness forum and in this other signal group that I'm in about Maha's

01:08:32.266 --> 01:08:33.567
table talk or something like that.

01:08:34.088 --> 01:08:39.192
And Tony Lyons kind of- You see this guy Pavlovsky is going to be mentioned in the next video.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:41.134
So you can see him down here in the lower left.

01:08:41.174 --> 01:08:46.138
And then you have Sherry Tenpenny, Carrie Madra and Lee Merritt.

01:08:46.338 --> 01:08:54.986
And so Sherry's here telling us about this signal chat that involved Tony Lyons and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone.

01:08:55.226 --> 01:08:58.269
And this is the kind of signal chat where people are controlled.

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.974
where there's this general consensus of what we should do and what we should think.

01:09:03.154 --> 01:09:05.976
And they encourage each other by saying, yeah, I agree with Robert.

01:09:06.437 --> 01:09:18.808
And then she goes off of the signal chat and tells the story among four other people about what Robert Malone said and about what Meryl Nass said and reassures them that, you know, this is better than it's ever been when that's just bullshit.

01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:22.510
And they were both speakers.

01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:25.211
Each speaker had like, I don't know, 10 minutes maybe.

01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:30.233
And I know it's not a very nice thing to say that these people are all scripted liars.

01:09:30.293 --> 01:09:39.457
And a lot of people will probably have a special place in their heart for Sherry or a special place in their heart for Lee, or maybe even a special place in their heart for Larry.

01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:50.161
But the bottom line is, is that if you consider yourself a thinking, critically thinking, always learning MD, like apparently, or, or D O,

01:09:51.147 --> 01:09:51.908
or M.D.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.229
or M.D.

01:09:53.369 --> 01:09:54.049
or D.O.

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:59.613
then you have to make progress because there's progress to be made.

01:10:00.554 --> 01:10:09.541
Gigaohm Biological has shown you definitively over the last two years that there is progress to be made from the current place where C.H.D.

01:10:09.641 --> 01:10:16.185
and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:16.225 --> 01:10:17.446
apparently find themselves.

01:10:17.907 --> 01:10:20.569
There is lots of progress to be made from what this

01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:27.790
Scripted traitor is saying there's lots of progress to be made from what this person has said since interviewing me twice.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:36.772
There's lots of progress to be made from where this person has said, but they're not making the progress because they are traitors or they are really dumb.

01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:42.253
Or they're just vulnerable to three people lying to them.

01:10:44.014 --> 01:10:47.014
Maybe Larry is just vulnerable to be lied by these two.

01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:47.634
I don't know.

01:10:47.714 --> 01:10:50.295
Maybe she's vulnerable to being lied to by these three.

01:10:52.230 --> 01:11:02.535
But the vast majority of these people with multiple books are definitely, without a doubt, they are scripted traders, or they'd be dead like Tony and Brandy.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:15.101
Now, what I wanna do, uh-oh, might have a little crashy crash here, we might have to, ooh, let's see, come on, girl.

01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:16.942
Break out of it.

01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:21.849
We might have a problem here.

01:11:21.869 --> 01:11:22.810
Just hold on one second.

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.070
We'll see what's gonna go on here.

01:11:24.491 --> 01:11:26.052
Sometimes my computer locks up.

01:11:26.072 --> 01:11:26.893
Are we still live?

01:11:26.933 --> 01:11:27.753
Can you still see me?

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:33.097
Because sometimes PowerPoint doesn't like me.

01:11:33.157 --> 01:11:33.938
Can you still see me?

01:11:34.218 --> 01:11:35.499
10penny had a stroke, I read.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.262
As long as you can still see me and hear me, then I think we're okay.

01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.863
I can probably explain it.

01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:46.047
And otherwise I'll just frame by frame it with this control alt delete stuff.

01:11:46.783 --> 01:11:47.803
Can you still see me?

01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:49.544
Can you still hear me?

01:11:50.404 --> 01:11:50.924
Anyone?

01:11:52.024 --> 01:11:53.924
Yes, we see you.

01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:54.985
Can you also hear me?

01:11:55.685 --> 01:11:59.566
Because if so, then I'm just going to end PowerPoint.

01:11:59.726 --> 01:12:00.986
Let's see, did it do it now?

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:02.406
There we go.

01:12:02.926 --> 01:12:06.927
I dug through it and threw it up and made a huge big stink about it.

01:12:07.187 --> 01:12:09.288
Went to Europe and talked to their parliaments.

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:14.849
Okay, so what I want to do is I want to look at this from a realistic perspective.

01:12:14.869 --> 01:12:15.189
Now look,

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:24.043
RNA cannot pandemic gain of function is a myth, but the whole vaccine illusion is perpetuated by this bullshit right here.

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:27.707
Given too many, too early.

01:12:28.908 --> 01:12:36.956
The no virus people are also making it really hard to make any progress on the truth, which is of course that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:12:38.736 --> 01:12:39.877
It's not about health freedom.

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.278
It's not about having a choice.

01:12:41.918 --> 01:12:45.501
It's not about gain of function or DNA plasmids that contaminate shots.

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.782
It's not about adjuvants or excipients.

01:12:47.842 --> 01:12:56.388
It's not about MMR or DDP or thimerosal or adjuvants or mercury or aluminum.

01:12:57.509 --> 01:12:58.930
It's not about Tylenol.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:00.891
It's not about no placebo testing.

01:13:02.573 --> 01:13:05.254
It's about intramuscular injection being a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:13:07.898 --> 01:13:08.999
That's how we break the wheel.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:25.170
We challenge any MD or DO or clinical scientist to justify how it is mechanistically that the body is able to deal with a combination of substances injected intramuscularly.

01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:34.188
It'd be a really interesting question to ask, you know, Paul Offit.

01:13:34.228 --> 01:13:39.210
Why would you advocate for, you know, ideally there being only oral vaccines?

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.610
What would be gained by that?

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:45.493
What, what are the potential downsides of intramuscular injection that you can imagine?

01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:53.236
You see, we're not making any progress there because these people are all scripted traders, liars on a script.

01:13:54.619 --> 01:13:58.428
That's why we have a health freedom movement that's fake because of these facts.

01:13:58.529 --> 01:14:00.614
Intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:14:02.631 --> 01:14:07.254
And so after the music, I'm not going to discuss this.

01:14:08.154 --> 01:14:10.435
This list is just spectacular, though.

01:14:11.536 --> 01:14:18.379
If you want anybody to do anything or address anything, you should have them address this list right here because nobody will talk about these things.

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:22.301
It's really remarkable.

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.463
After the music, I am going to start with

01:14:27.711 --> 01:14:29.433
start with this video and see how far we get.

01:14:29.453 --> 01:14:34.237
We'll probably only watch about a half an hour of it because I do need to do some basketball today as well.

01:14:34.317 --> 01:14:35.278
Thanks for being here guys.

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:37.179
Turn it up loud.

01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:18.696
But I was

01:18:42.236 --> 01:18:44.957
It's actually an interesting question to put in the chat there.

01:18:45.177 --> 01:18:47.698
Sorry, dumb implies something better.

01:18:49.478 --> 01:18:50.719
There might be something better.

01:18:52.799 --> 01:18:59.842
I am absolutely positively, I hate to break it to you, but I am very open to the idea that we have an immune system.

01:18:59.942 --> 01:19:06.644
I'm very open to the idea that the immune system is part of us that interacts with our

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:10.445
microbiome in our gut and the microbiome in our skin.

01:19:11.105 --> 01:19:25.769
And so I have no doubt in my mind that there might be a way to augment that interaction and that interplay between the immune system and the microbiome during digestion and through

01:19:26.309 --> 01:19:34.795
environmental exposure, that that can become maladaptive, that can become out of balance, that can become somehow out of sync, out of whack.

01:19:35.495 --> 01:19:41.339
And so there is a reason why you might want to be able to molecularly interact with our body in that way.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.503
But I do not think in any way, shape, or form that intramuscular injection could ever

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.361
be that way.

01:19:49.301 --> 01:19:58.109
That's why I think the statement, intramuscular injection is dumb, is so vitally important to understand and be able to explain it.

01:19:58.769 --> 01:20:12.841
Because there very well may be some evidence in history that variolation on the skin to a smallpox infection was effective at mitigating exposure to it in the future.

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:14.382
It's possible.

01:20:17.509 --> 01:20:29.580
It's possible that an oral vaccine for a oral bacteriophage or an oral bacteria imbalance might be something that would work, would have an effect.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.382
There might be signals down there.

01:20:31.762 --> 01:20:33.824
We know for sure there are bacteriophages.

01:20:34.905 --> 01:20:42.232
The vast majority of any signals that would be found when sampling the mucosa of a mammal would be bacteriophage signals.

01:20:43.982 --> 01:20:48.446
signals that are never discussed in the context of there are no viruses.

01:20:49.467 --> 01:20:55.152
Even though when you look those people up and find out what they were talking about, all of them acknowledge that those signals exist.

01:20:55.972 --> 01:21:01.717
So it is an irreducibly complex background and there may be reason to augment our responses to it.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:09.484
I just don't think that right now intramuscular injection of a combination of substances has even approached that goal.

01:21:11.636 --> 01:21:15.378
And I think for a very, very long time, they've just let it go on knowing that.

01:21:15.658 --> 01:21:18.560
Somehow or another, they've just let it go on knowing that.

01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:23.423
It's a very malevolent place that we are right now.

01:21:23.483 --> 01:21:28.105
There is no doubt about that this is a really, really bad, bad place we are at.

01:21:29.847 --> 01:21:30.687
Is this the right one?

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:34.109
I think this is the one.

01:21:58.035 --> 01:22:10.403
Now, the first thing that I noticed about this, which really drives me bananas, is that all of the podcasts that you see behind you right now and going, he's either wearing socks or he's wearing bare feet.

01:22:11.484 --> 01:22:15.186
But in the podcast we're about to watch right now, he's wearing Jordan 3s.

01:22:17.287 --> 01:22:18.528
You think that's by accident?

01:22:19.349 --> 01:22:19.669
I don't.

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.423
I think that's how close we are to pushing this wall over.

01:22:25.164 --> 01:22:34.774
Is that almost everything that we do and everything that we say needs to be somehow absorbed or kind of neutralized by these clowns.

01:22:34.994 --> 01:22:43.824
Including the statement that he's going to open with is that he thinks that he was also following Toni Barth because she did a lot of great work in this paradigm.

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:50.534
I'm going to start that over again so you can see the bare feet and make sure that you don't miss it.

01:22:52.014 --> 01:23:09.120
Because it's important to see that is an odd, it's an odd thing to have in your reel, you know, like in your many different sets that you've been with, you know, different sets of chairs, different arrangements of the camera.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.762
And he's always got socks on or bare feet until this podcast where he's got Jordans on.

01:23:16.414 --> 01:23:18.715
I'm just gonna, oops, I did it again.

01:23:18.735 --> 01:23:19.775
I gotta set this.

01:23:26.197 --> 01:23:28.418
And of course one eyeball, that's awesome.

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:36.600
Eyeball.

01:23:40.762 --> 01:23:41.182
Socks.

01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:48.390
Barefoot.

01:23:55.636 --> 01:23:58.357
Eyeballs.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:06.303
Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, the, I don't wanna say the man, the myth, the legend, the woman, the myth, the legend.

01:24:07.704 --> 01:24:10.046
So when I first started questioning.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.447
Now I want you to remember what he told us before.

01:24:12.487 --> 01:24:17.231
He told us he's a grocery store clerk that sells boomers and got put out of business.

01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:20.831
He was building an inner standing.

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:25.294
He was already living very well before he understood why it was so important to live well.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:27.235
He was skeptical of pharma.

01:24:27.655 --> 01:24:32.978
He was skeptical of the relationship between pharma and the media and government or something like that.

01:24:32.998 --> 01:24:35.600
He had a son that he put vaccines on hold for.

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:40.904
but he was still scared of being around other people because he didn't have the protection of the vaccines.

01:24:41.364 --> 01:24:43.766
And he was kind of surprised that his kid didn't get sick.

01:24:43.806 --> 01:24:50.772
And so then he started to do some more research, but basically found himself in the, in the trad terrain space.

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:58.455
So let's hear in 2025, how he explains he came to his understanding of things.

01:24:58.775 --> 01:25:07.277
In vaccines back in 2016, just after I commissioned as an officer in the army, graduated from West Point and was fully indoctrinated into a government paradigm.

01:25:08.658 --> 01:25:16.100
Fully indoctrinated into a government paradigm, but he wanted to hold off on vaccines for his son?

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.080
When did that happen exactly?

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:19.941
That's weird, right?

01:25:20.001 --> 01:25:20.221
Okay.

01:25:21.925 --> 01:25:26.919
A series of events happened with my family that led me to start questioning things with respect to health.

01:25:27.441 --> 01:25:28.785
That's not very specific.

01:25:30.397 --> 01:25:35.799
He said in this interview, the other interview, that he had a son and he decided to hold off on vaccines.

01:25:35.819 --> 01:25:38.980
Now he says it's a whole series of events in his family that happened.

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:43.001
Wow, that sounds like, it sounds like he might be a liar.

01:25:43.742 --> 01:25:52.465
And when I started questioning vaccines, some of the first people that I came across were you, Dr. Larry Pilevsky, shout out to Dr. P, love him.

01:25:53.085 --> 01:25:56.446
The guy on the podcast that I just showed you yesterday and again today.

01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:01.845
And then I think it was Dr. Tony Bark at the time and rest in peace to Dr. Tony Bark.

01:26:01.885 --> 01:26:04.567
She did a lot of incredible work in this paradigm.

01:26:04.967 --> 01:26:07.950
A lot of incredible work in this paradigm.

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:09.231
What does that even mean?

01:26:11.613 --> 01:26:13.555
What does that even mean?

01:26:14.276 --> 01:26:18.199
Does that mean that she did some great performances?

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:24.205
Does that mean that she, you know, could speak for hours?

01:26:25.976 --> 01:26:29.359
Some great work in this paradigm.

01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:30.480
Stop lying.

01:26:34.783 --> 01:26:39.167
But I want to give you a lot of credit for my initial entry into this space.

01:26:39.287 --> 01:26:43.151
And it is pretty surreal to have you now sitting across from me.

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:48.395
This sounds like a scripted elevation to the highest point in the movement, right?

01:26:48.435 --> 01:26:49.996
I got to give you a lot of credit.

01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:51.758
You're like one of the first people I saw.

01:26:52.218 --> 01:26:53.840
So it wasn't Suzanne Humphries.

01:26:54.753 --> 01:27:03.376
even though at any event that Tenpenny would have been at, Susan Humphreys would have been the bigger draw.

01:27:03.456 --> 01:27:05.297
Susan Humphreys would have been the bigger draw.

01:27:06.497 --> 01:27:08.258
Brian Hooker would have been the bigger draw.

01:27:10.939 --> 01:27:14.280
Brandy Vaughn, Tony Bark, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:19.742
So it's really interesting that he's insisting that for him, it was really Sherry Tenpenny.

01:27:22.796 --> 01:27:31.983
having a chat and gave me a signed copy of your new book, Zero Accountability in a Failed System, How Big Pharma Weaponizes Vaccines, Public Health, and the Law.

01:27:32.383 --> 01:27:34.065
And you can find this in the show notes.

01:27:34.985 --> 01:27:40.650
And I just want to thank you so much for all your work over the years and for being here and sitting with me for this conversation.

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.672
Well, thank you so much for having me Alec.

01:27:43.032 --> 01:27:47.957
You know, we before we started we talked as Mark pointed out This is a studio who knows where it is.

01:27:48.077 --> 01:27:50.059
He's got $300 microphones.

01:27:50.139 --> 01:27:54.623
My microphones are $30 He's clearly got someone else running his switcher.

01:27:54.663 --> 01:28:04.373
He's got someone else doing the stream He's got probably someone else doing the cameras or the audio because there's more than one angle here Ladies and gentlemen

01:28:06.687 --> 01:28:08.509
This is not by accident.

01:28:08.649 --> 01:28:12.052
This is not a grocery store clerk trying to start a podcast.

01:28:12.152 --> 01:28:17.177
This is a military operation with military actors.

01:28:18.069 --> 01:28:20.110
You want to know why Sasha Latupova is right?

01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:23.110
Because it is a military operation on social media.

01:28:23.311 --> 01:28:24.171
That's how she's right.

01:28:24.431 --> 01:28:25.251
Talked about Austin.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.672
It's a big place for people.

01:28:28.992 --> 01:28:32.453
So instead of saying, yeah, Toni Bark was kick ass.

01:28:32.533 --> 01:28:35.074
It's so sucks that she and Brandi died in 2020.

01:28:35.434 --> 01:28:38.215
She starts with joking about how big Austin is.

01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:47.021
You know, the place where Andrew Wakefield has a ranch worth more than a million dollars, the place where Polly Tommy has a ranch more than worth more than $1 million.

01:28:47.041 --> 01:28:55.648
You know, the two foreigners that own fricking property in America as a result of pretending that the MMR vaccine kind of hurt her son.

01:28:55.668 --> 01:29:06.356
And she was on 90 billboards in her bra swaying 6 million votes for prime minister before she moved to America to pull the same stupid shit here with these people.

01:29:07.577 --> 01:29:07.937
Austin.

01:29:09.278 --> 01:29:11.401
You know, where Joe Rogan moved.

01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:18.731
Where, where Weinstein lives, where, where Musk lives.

01:29:21.817 --> 01:29:22.818
I don't know it ever been here.

01:29:22.878 --> 01:29:25.039
You drive for an hour to get.

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:30.083
So when people say they live in Austin, I think the question is, what part of Austin do you live in?

01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:32.445
Because it's a big place down here.

01:29:32.705 --> 01:29:40.011
It is a helpful qualifying statement to say, hey, I live in the Austin area, but that also means I live about an hour, 10 minutes away from Austin.

01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:44.174
Let me just reiterate that I think that this jackass was scripted to say Tony Bark.

01:29:44.214 --> 01:29:45.775
I bet he didn't even know who she was.

01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:55.102
And the reason why you can tell she, that he was scripted to say it is because Sherry Tenpenny doesn't admit that she knew her, doesn't say anything or respect her at all.

01:29:55.582 --> 01:30:04.008
Because actually Sherry Tenpenny in the description of this video is described as an ER physician, which curiously enough is what Tony Bark was.

01:30:04.048 --> 01:30:09.012
Although Tony Bark was a real ER physician with an MD, had a real ER.

01:30:09.032 --> 01:30:12.274
I don't know where this fake worked with her DO.

01:30:13.933 --> 01:30:17.778
But there weren't very many heads of ERs that had DOs.

01:30:17.858 --> 01:30:18.999
I can tell you that right now.

01:30:19.279 --> 01:30:19.960
Or whatever it is.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.446
And I've had guests come out who then appear on Luke Story's podcast.

01:30:24.766 --> 01:30:31.214
Austin has also given us Barry Weiss and the University of Austin, which is one of the biggest scams of all time.

01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:42.154
or Dave Asprey's podcast or Josh Trent's podcast later that day, or you know, in your case, you're going on another podcast right after this and they're, they get here and they're like, you say you're in the Austin area.

01:30:42.194 --> 01:30:42.854
I'm like, well, yeah.

01:30:43.314 --> 01:30:47.816
It is admitting that we are being ruled by podcast.

01:30:49.697 --> 01:30:55.679
Scripted liars on a shitty script can convince us of anything.

01:30:57.657 --> 01:31:02.961
I am in the Austin area and they're like, well, so does this other guy, but his studio is an hour, 20 minutes away from yours.

01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:04.362
So what am I supposed to do?

01:31:05.022 --> 01:31:08.544
Like, so I guess we just need to be a little bit more specific about where exactly that is.

01:31:09.945 --> 01:31:15.069
So before we begin this episode, I just want to sort of frame the conversation for those who are listening and watching.

01:31:15.749 --> 01:31:23.633
Obviously if you tune into my work often you know my position on on virology and you can check that out episode 141.

01:31:24.373 --> 01:31:26.774
I do not want to get into that in this conversation.

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:28.915
That is not the intention of this conversation.

01:31:29.355 --> 01:31:32.457
The intention of this episode with Dr. Tenpenny because

01:31:33.317 --> 01:31:42.141
Like when I first came across questioning vaccines for the first time, turning towards good resources for those who are just beginning to question these things.

01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:45.463
Dr. Tenpenny is one of the best people for that.

01:31:45.523 --> 01:31:46.523
Honestly, she really is.

01:31:46.563 --> 01:31:55.187
So one of the things you can see and listen to here, the enchantment is that laying down the narrative that you got a lot of long ways to go before you're going to understand it all.

01:31:56.104 --> 01:31:59.625
There's so much you got to learn in order to understand all of this.

01:31:59.665 --> 01:32:12.047
There's binders and binders of papers and thousands and thousands of hours you're going to have to do in order to really understand how bad it is that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:32:12.087 --> 01:32:13.408
You see why it's so stupid?

01:32:14.048 --> 01:32:15.568
Do you see why it's so stupid?

01:32:16.368 --> 01:32:23.930
These people have been on this shitty run out the clock script for so long that they deserve nothing but prison.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:33.867
And so the purpose of this is to sort of act as a vaccine 101 sort of style discussion and interview.

01:32:35.128 --> 01:32:40.612
I consider myself to be quite knowledgeable on this, but she's been doing this for a long time when it comes to vaccines.

01:32:40.773 --> 01:32:41.833
So I'm.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:44.055
Oh, damn it.

01:32:44.936 --> 01:32:45.837
What is happening here?

01:32:46.177 --> 01:32:47.418
Something screwed up with this.

01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:52.162
Let's see here.

01:32:52.342 --> 01:32:54.444
Animations, animation pain.

01:32:56.713 --> 01:32:57.773
Start with previous.

01:32:57.873 --> 01:32:58.954
Oh, those don't fade out.

01:32:59.234 --> 01:33:02.435
Okay, let's do this and this and this.

01:33:05.636 --> 01:33:06.436
And there it goes.

01:33:07.736 --> 01:33:08.456
Sorry about that.

01:33:08.476 --> 01:33:10.157
Slideshow, current slide.

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:13.638
I'll fast forward this a little bit.

01:33:13.678 --> 01:33:14.678
I'll fast forward it a little bit.

01:33:14.698 --> 01:33:16.579
I promise, I promise, I promise I'll fast forward.

01:33:16.659 --> 01:33:23.461
...podcast or Josh Trent's podcast later that day or, you know, in your case, you're going on another podcast right after this and they're, they get here and they're like,

01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:25.502
You say you're in the Austin area.

01:33:25.542 --> 01:33:27.283
I'm like, well, yeah, I am in the Austin area.

01:33:27.323 --> 01:33:30.786
So does this other guy, but his studio is in 141.

01:33:31.526 --> 01:33:33.928
I do not want to get into that in this conversation.

01:33:33.948 --> 01:33:36.049
That is not the intention of this conversation.

01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:39.412
The intention of this episode with Dr. T- You see the Jordans?

01:33:39.672 --> 01:33:41.253
That's quite a bit of difference, right?

01:33:41.353 --> 01:33:48.298
If you were going barefoot and you were going wool socks, and now you're going full sweatshop, Chinese made,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.701
That's pretty impressive, don't you think?

01:33:51.881 --> 01:33:53.122
I think that's pretty impressive.

01:33:53.162 --> 01:33:54.102
I think that's scripted.

01:33:54.883 --> 01:34:08.950
Tenpenny, because like when I first came across questioning vaccines for the first time, turning towards good resources for those who are just beginning to question these things, Dr. Tenpenny is one of the best people for that.

01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:10.051
Honestly, she really is.

01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:18.356
And so the purpose of this is to sort of act as a vaccine 101 sort of style discussion and interview.

01:34:19.656 --> 01:34:25.139
I consider myself to be quite knowledgeable on this, but she's been doing this for a long time when it comes to vaccines.

01:34:25.299 --> 01:34:32.902
So I'm excited to be able to pick her brain and have her fill in the gaps in some of my knowledge on the vaccine paradigm.

01:34:33.082 --> 01:34:44.267
And again, this episode will be incredibly useful to send to family members, loved ones, coming from the mouth of an expert, from a credentialed expert, a DO, right?

01:34:44.307 --> 01:34:45.127
Doctor of Osteopathy.

01:34:45.207 --> 01:34:45.447
Okay.

01:34:45.908 --> 01:34:46.088
A DO.

01:34:47.793 --> 01:34:50.895
I think this will be a very helpful episode to send people.

01:34:50.976 --> 01:35:08.327
So I'd like to start with you sort of just sharing your Your process I have listened to this once and I've got to warn you I'm gonna go bananas because this woman is about to say something so profound and

01:35:09.691 --> 01:35:18.139
And it had such an effect on me earlier today that I'm, I'm, I'm almost certain it's going to have the same effect on me again when I hear it again, and I might flip out.

01:35:18.399 --> 01:35:20.381
So just be warned.

01:35:21.402 --> 01:35:21.902
It's coming.

01:35:24.745 --> 01:35:31.591
That's in discovering the problems with vaccines initially as someone who went to medical school.

01:35:32.172 --> 01:35:32.292
So.

01:35:33.752 --> 01:35:35.634
Well, I grew up in a chiropractic family.

01:35:36.314 --> 01:35:39.597
My grandfather, my father, three uncles, and two cousins were chiropractors.

01:35:40.218 --> 01:35:42.700
So I was not vaccinated at all as a child.

01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:48.486
I grew up on Shackley vitamins and regular adjustments.

01:35:48.626 --> 01:35:55.052
And so I had measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, had pertussis twice.

01:35:55.812 --> 01:36:04.843
Um, my dad had, um, had, you know, his father was a chiropractor and he had gone to the Korean war and he said he was never so sick in his entire life.

01:36:04.943 --> 01:36:07.826
And when he got out, you know, that was, and, uh, he and my mom got married in 1956.

01:36:13.232 --> 01:36:16.857
I was born in 1958, which tells you how old I am.

01:36:16.877 --> 01:36:17.979
I've been around a long time.

01:36:18.559 --> 01:36:23.305
And that was when the polio vaccine came out in 1954.

01:36:23.906 --> 01:36:30.215
And in the chiropractic literature, there was a lot of stuff that was being published about children who became paralyzed.

01:36:30.655 --> 01:36:34.997
or had a flaccid limb or something like that after getting a polio vaccine.

01:36:35.397 --> 01:36:47.902
And so when I was born, you know, those two things together, my dad being sick after getting all those shots and then what was he was seeing in the chiropractic literature, he and my mom made the decision that I was not going to be vaccinated and I wasn't.

01:36:48.542 --> 01:36:54.966
And it was interesting because I lived in a very small town in north, kind of north central Ohio.

01:36:55.346 --> 01:36:57.928
There was about 800 people in the population.

01:36:58.368 --> 01:37:03.511
And we had a local family doctor who made an appointment one day to come in and talk to my dad in his office.

01:37:03.911 --> 01:37:05.892
And he said, you've got to get a handle on your wife.

01:37:06.573 --> 01:37:07.393
And he's like, why?

01:37:07.413 --> 01:37:10.255
And he said, well, she has to vaccinate your child.

01:37:10.755 --> 01:37:17.379
And my dad physically picked him up and threw him out of his office and went on a campaign to get him run out of town, which he did.

01:37:18.553 --> 01:37:20.994
That is a pretty extraordinary story.

01:37:21.054 --> 01:37:23.276
So she grew up in a chiropractic family.

01:37:23.356 --> 01:37:45.368
She's unvaccinated because her parents decided, um, what they saw in the chiropractic literature and the fact that when the dad went to the Korean war, um, he got sicker than he's ever been after the shots that he got to go to the Korean war.

01:37:45.468 --> 01:37:48.110
So then his, the father,

01:37:50.862 --> 01:37:51.683
Open my pen here.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:38:02.749
Tossed a dude out of his office and then ran him out of town?

01:38:05.216 --> 01:38:06.037
Is that what she said?

01:38:06.097 --> 01:38:09.682
Because I gotta make sure that that's exactly what she said, because that's interesting.

01:38:09.762 --> 01:38:11.424
In true chiropractic fashion, by the way.

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:12.786
In true chiropractic fashion.

01:38:13.127 --> 01:38:21.778
My dad was, after getting all those shots, and then what he was seeing in the chiropractic literature, he and my mom made the decision that I was not going to be vaccinated, and I wasn't.

01:38:22.399 --> 01:38:28.841
And it was interesting because I lived in a very small town in north, kind of north central Ohio.

01:38:29.201 --> 01:38:31.782
There was about 800 people in the population.

01:38:32.242 --> 01:38:37.363
And we had a local family doctor who made an appointment one day to come in and talk to my dad in his office.

01:38:37.763 --> 01:38:39.764
And he said, you've got to get a handle on your wife.

01:38:40.424 --> 01:38:41.264
And he's like, why?

01:38:41.284 --> 01:38:44.105
And he said, well, she has to vaccinate your child.

01:38:44.605 --> 01:38:51.247
And my dad physically picked him up and threw him out of his office and went on a campaign to get him run out of town, which he did.

01:38:51.867 --> 01:39:13.533
Now, I'm trying to make sure that you digest that this is her claim of her childhood understanding of vaccines being formed around parents who knew not to vaccinate her and in fact got into a confrontation with somebody that resulted in a physical assault and running the guy out of town.

01:39:15.202 --> 01:39:16.682
That's a remarkable story.

01:39:16.722 --> 01:39:18.783
My dad didn't run anybody out of town.

01:39:19.243 --> 01:39:23.064
My dad was a big dude and he didn't throw anybody out of the house ever.

01:39:25.785 --> 01:39:31.046
My mom picked me up and threw me against the wall sometimes or threw me on the ground, but my dad never did any of that.

01:39:31.086 --> 01:39:33.767
Like, so this is a pretty impressive story.

01:39:34.347 --> 01:39:36.207
I wonder if he came home and told him.

01:39:36.747 --> 01:39:38.208
I'm sure he didn't have a video.

01:39:39.668 --> 01:39:41.629
It's a very impressive story.

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:42.709
When did this happen?

01:39:44.087 --> 01:39:47.709
when she was six, when she was eight, maybe when she was 15.

01:39:47.809 --> 01:39:51.372
She has a pretty vivid memory of it.

01:39:52.713 --> 01:39:55.014
Ran him out of town, wow.

01:39:55.454 --> 01:39:57.215
In true chiropractic fashion, by the way.

01:39:57.235 --> 01:39:58.476
In true chiropractic fashion.

01:39:58.816 --> 01:40:01.678
My dad was about 6'2 and really buffed up.

01:40:01.738 --> 01:40:04.540
And so he was a good looking man when he was younger.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.062
Well, when he was older too, but especially when he was younger.

01:40:07.742 --> 01:40:11.386
So I never gave it a second thought, you know, at anything.

01:40:11.426 --> 01:40:16.371
I mean, we raised horses when I was growing up and, you know, everybody's so afraid about tetanus and horses.

01:40:16.471 --> 01:40:18.933
And I never, it was never a big deal to me.

01:40:19.434 --> 01:40:25.039
Went to medical school, graduated from medical school and, and we got no training at all about vaccines.

01:40:25.179 --> 01:40:29.224
I mean, in fact, at that point in time, there was up until 1985, there's only three vaccines

01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:32.726
polio, MMR and DPT.

01:40:33.146 --> 01:40:34.987
So I mean, what was there to talk about?

01:40:35.168 --> 01:40:37.129
And so they didn't really talk about any of that stuff.

01:40:37.569 --> 01:40:40.411
When I graduated from medical school, I went into emergency medicine.

01:40:41.031 --> 01:40:51.077
But your dad threw somebody out of his office and ran him out of town for suggesting that he should control his wife and get you vaccinated.

01:40:51.949 --> 01:41:00.153
So you went to med school and you didn't have this burnt into your head and then wonder why don't we even talk about these things?

01:41:00.493 --> 01:41:11.938
It's a strange disconnect here because such a traumatic experience, such an emotional and energetic experience of having your dad run somebody out of town.

01:41:13.456 --> 01:41:14.598
You'd think you'd know why.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.104
You'd think you'd ask some questions, right?

01:41:17.144 --> 01:41:22.475
The kid that was eventually going to go to med school must have said, hey dad, why don't you, what is he wrong about?

01:41:23.942 --> 01:41:25.003
It's so weird.

01:41:25.423 --> 01:41:26.944
It almost is like she's a lion.

01:41:27.645 --> 01:41:31.007
And I gave out zillions of tetanus shots.

01:41:31.067 --> 01:41:32.928
Like they were some special kind of candy.

01:41:33.428 --> 01:41:34.729
Never read a package insert.

01:41:34.789 --> 01:41:36.330
Never anything at that point in time.

01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:37.351
Because why?

01:41:37.711 --> 01:41:52.501
Because your dad threw somebody out of an office when you were a kid and ran him out of town because he didn't believe in vaccines because he had read the chiropractic literature and decided after long consideration with your mom, not to vaccinate you.

01:41:52.541 --> 01:41:53.502
Maybe that's why.

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:55.982
Isn't that weird?

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:58.063
It's almost like she's lying.

01:41:59.443 --> 01:42:00.824
No, it's safe and effective, right?

01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:01.524
Safe and effective.

01:42:02.404 --> 01:42:13.267
And the kids... Who told her that it's safe and effective if her dad threw somebody out of the office and ran him out of town in the old school chiropractic style?

01:42:14.747 --> 01:42:16.147
This doesn't make sense.

01:42:16.307 --> 01:42:23.429
Either she didn't learn anything from what her dad did or her dad actually didn't do that.

01:42:26.618 --> 01:42:30.119
But you know, far be it for me to say that somebody's lying.

01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:32.159
I just think that this doesn't make any sense.

01:42:32.219 --> 01:42:33.580
The story doesn't jive.

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:38.361
If I was sitting around at a bar and somebody was telling me this story, I'd have to stop them.

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:45.243
I would absolutely positively have to stop them.

01:42:45.734 --> 01:42:51.778
So we'd come in with ear infections and sinus infections and crying and fevers and miserable.

01:42:51.858 --> 01:42:54.939
And the nurses would come up to me and say, well, they're behind on their vaccine.

01:42:54.959 --> 01:42:55.820
Should we catch them up?

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.081
And I said, no, don't bother with that.

01:42:58.121 --> 01:42:59.902
They got enough to deal with right now.

01:42:59.962 --> 01:43:01.583
Their family doctor can deal with that later.

01:43:01.964 --> 01:43:04.605
And that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge of vaccines.

01:43:05.005 --> 01:43:07.447
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:14.294
So she had patients that would come to her sick, but also had family doctors.

01:43:14.455 --> 01:43:15.735
So why did they come to her?

01:43:17.276 --> 01:43:19.698
She left the vaccination up to the family doctor.

01:43:19.798 --> 01:43:25.141
How many people do you know who are going to a family doctor and also to a DO?

01:43:26.022 --> 01:43:28.023
Is it for like extra opinions?

01:43:29.044 --> 01:43:31.826
What in the Sam hell is she talking about here?

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:33.153
What?

01:43:33.754 --> 01:43:35.535
About, well, up till two.

01:43:35.915 --> 01:43:42.480
And the kids would come in with ear infections and sinus infections and crying and fevers and miserable.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.623
And the nurses would come up to me and say, well, they're behind on their vaccine.

01:43:45.643 --> 01:43:46.503
Should we catch them up?

01:43:47.124 --> 01:43:48.765
And I said, no, don't bother with that.

01:43:48.805 --> 01:43:50.586
They got enough to deal with right now.

01:43:50.646 --> 01:43:52.268
Their family doctor can deal with that later.

01:43:52.648 --> 01:43:55.270
And that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge of vaccines.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.611
That has to be a lie.

01:43:56.671 --> 01:44:01.675
That just doesn't make any sense that she's suggesting that all of her patients had another doctor.

01:44:02.395 --> 01:44:08.210
and that she had nurses that she worked with that were different nurses than worked with the family doctor.

01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:11.238
She's implying all of that with this stupid story.

01:44:13.453 --> 01:44:15.595
I just, I just, I don't know what this is.

01:44:15.615 --> 01:44:20.698
I think this is a massive, a massive failure of, of improvising.

01:44:21.539 --> 01:44:24.441
While I was up through about, well, up till 2000.

01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:29.764
So in 1996, I moved to Cleveland, started an integrative holistic practice.

01:44:29.784 --> 01:44:30.264
Ah, good one.

01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:32.766
In the chat, somebody said that she's working at an ER.

01:44:32.826 --> 01:44:41.672
So they would come into the ER sick and the ER nurses would say, should we catch them up on their vaccines in the ER?

01:44:41.812 --> 01:44:42.133
Really?

01:44:43.001 --> 01:44:44.281
That also sounds weird.

01:44:44.802 --> 01:44:45.142
Wow.

01:44:46.102 --> 01:44:53.064
And a couple of years later, there was just moms that would come into the clinic clutching their babies to their chest.

01:44:53.804 --> 01:44:55.504
Do you hear it already?

01:44:55.544 --> 01:45:03.847
What she's trying to tell you is, is that something happened and she noticed it happened because the moms were coming in, but they weren't coming in before.

01:45:04.707 --> 01:45:05.227
Do you hear it?

01:45:05.267 --> 01:45:11.609
She's trying to tell you that during her career is when this transition to herding kids started.

01:45:12.975 --> 01:45:34.195
wide eye and say what's your position on vaccines and i would say well i don't really have a position i don't really think they're necessary i don't you know i just she doesn't have a position on vaccines after her dad when she was a kid after careful consideration with the mom and reading the chiropractic literature decided to throw somebody out of his office

01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:36.496
and ran him out of town.

01:45:36.956 --> 01:45:46.022
But after that, and after med school, and after not getting taught anything, and not reading any inserts, she doesn't have a position on vaccines.

01:45:46.703 --> 01:45:50.725
Wow, what a tremendous hero this person is.

01:45:51.405 --> 01:45:55.428
And at that point in time, I didn't know anything about the 1986 Act.

01:45:55.488 --> 01:45:57.429
I didn't know about the big ramp up of the schedule.

01:45:57.449 --> 01:45:58.070
I didn't know anything.

01:45:58.230 --> 01:46:02.973
But you knew your dad threw somebody out of town for these things.

01:46:04.517 --> 01:46:09.825
You just told us you're an unvaccinated child because you're parents.

01:46:10.867 --> 01:46:14.493
What in the actual Sam hell is going on here?

01:46:15.314 --> 01:46:17.798
This is a terrible liar, ladies and gentlemen.

01:46:19.397 --> 01:46:19.917
So this was like 1998.

01:46:20.017 --> 01:46:23.179
And I was like, well, I don't think they're really necessary.

01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:25.340
I wasn't vaccinated and I'm alive to talk about it.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.121
I think I'm healthier because of it.

01:46:27.961 --> 01:46:34.565
And so that was kind of, but they planted a seed, like there must be some concern out there about vaccines.

01:46:35.785 --> 01:46:43.209
There is a concern out there about vaccines because your dad threw somebody out of his office and ran him out of town, you lying, scripted traitor.

01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.270
Wow.

01:46:45.418 --> 01:46:47.726
It's almost like it had no effect on her at all, right?

01:46:52.694 --> 01:46:58.058
I got a flyer in the mail for the National Vaccine Information Center annual conference.

01:46:58.739 --> 01:47:02.301
So NVIC is a small nonprofit in Washington, D.C.

01:47:02.361 --> 01:47:06.445
I picked up the flyer and it was such an inconvenient time for me to go.

01:47:06.965 --> 01:47:10.448
And so I even went so far as to call them and say, when's your next conference?

01:47:10.468 --> 01:47:11.929
Because I don't think I can make it to this one.

01:47:12.449 --> 01:47:13.490
They said, well, we're a small.

01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:14.851
That's this conference.

01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:15.672
That's this book.

01:47:15.912 --> 01:47:20.816
That's Barbara Lowe Fisher, the organization that she's talking about.

01:47:20.856 --> 01:47:22.137
And she says it's the DTP.

01:47:23.581 --> 01:47:26.823
non-profit, I don't, we don't even know if we'll have another conference.

01:47:27.444 --> 01:47:34.368
So every time I went to throw, and it was, I distinctly remember it was on gray paper, just a trifold with nothing fancy.

01:47:34.749 --> 01:47:39.312
Every time I went to throw it in the wastebasket, I just put it back on the counter.

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:41.613
Somehow, magically, it'll end up back on my counter.

01:47:41.653 --> 01:47:42.114
And I thought,

01:47:42.794 --> 01:48:04.558
well you know there must be somebody really important I need to meet to go to this meeting not about something that's why I'll go so I decided to go down to this meeting was in September of 2000 there were about 700 so the paper never got thrown away because of a gut feeling and finally she decided well I must not want to throw it away so I'll go to the conference it's going to get better

01:48:04.929 --> 01:48:12.072
people there from all over the country, moms of vaccine injured kids, moms of unvaccinated kids.

01:48:12.112 --> 01:48:22.396
And I sat for three and a half days and listened to doctors, scientists, researchers, lawyers, moms, all sorts of things talking about problems associated with vaccines.

01:48:22.876 --> 01:48:25.617
And I was like, how in the world did I miss this?

01:48:27.025 --> 01:48:32.166
How in the world did you miss it indeed when your dad threw somebody out of his office and ran him out of town?

01:48:32.726 --> 01:48:35.126
How the hell did you miss this?

01:48:35.927 --> 01:48:36.487
It's crazy.

01:48:37.727 --> 01:48:40.927
You know, at this point in time, you know, I'd been a doctor for 15 years.

01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:42.688
I'd had my own clinic for four years.

01:48:42.788 --> 01:48:44.868
She'd been unvaccinated her whole life.

01:48:44.948 --> 01:48:47.949
And during her childhood, her father ran somebody out of town.

01:48:52.789 --> 01:48:54.870
How did I not know anything about this?

01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:55.710
How did I miss this?

01:48:56.877 --> 01:49:03.898
You just told us, you just told us you've known about this since you were a kid because your dad did.

01:49:04.859 --> 01:49:06.839
Come on, you silly shit.

01:49:07.859 --> 01:49:14.060
Pretty wild real quick because you grew up in a chiropractic family that was already not pro-vaccine necessarily.

01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:19.561
And that just sort of shows how deep the conditioning and also the obfuscation of true information really.

01:49:19.801 --> 01:49:23.622
Oh, obfuscation of true information says the scripted faker.

01:49:25.274 --> 01:49:32.115
using a word that he never would use otherwise, just like she's gonna use the word mythology and the word multi-generational.

01:49:34.516 --> 01:49:35.556
Scripted fools.

01:49:35.836 --> 01:49:37.236
He goes, even at that point in time.

01:49:37.356 --> 01:49:40.657
Yeah, and I just thought, where do I start?

01:49:40.717 --> 01:49:43.078
I went home and my head was just spinning.

01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:45.078
I mean, I distinctly remember coming home.

01:49:45.158 --> 01:49:50.219
Just imagine if one of these heroes would have accidentally started with ingestion versus injection.

01:49:50.899 --> 01:49:57.364
or started with intramuscular injection just being dumb and a remnant from times when people were using morphine a lot.

01:49:57.404 --> 01:50:03.248
Just imagine if somebody started there instead of where these shitheads always inevitably start.

01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:07.151
The thousands and thousands of hours of research.

01:50:07.511 --> 01:50:09.513
After that conference, I'm sitting on my couch going,

01:50:11.172 --> 01:50:12.333
What do I do with this?

01:50:12.894 --> 01:50:14.255
Well, I guess I better look into this.

01:50:15.096 --> 01:50:15.956
Where do I start?

01:50:16.477 --> 01:50:17.638
So I thought, well, let me see.

01:50:17.958 --> 01:50:21.121
If I was a lawyer, I'd probably start with Supreme Court cases.

01:50:21.741 --> 01:50:23.483
So I guess I'll start with the CDC.

01:50:23.663 --> 01:50:26.306
They're supposed to be the experts on all this vaccine stuff.

01:50:26.946 --> 01:50:33.092
So I pulled out the General Recommendations of Vaccination, which would have been the 1998 version, because this was September of 2000.

01:50:33.573 --> 01:50:38.537
And at that point in time, about every two years, they were writing kind of a new version for this.

01:50:39.038 --> 01:50:41.080
So I pulled out the 1998 version.

01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:41.761
I read it.

01:50:41.781 --> 01:50:43.342
It's like a 42-page paper.

01:50:43.382 --> 01:50:43.722
And I went,

01:50:44.485 --> 01:50:45.045
This is it?

01:50:45.065 --> 01:50:47.406
I mean, this is it?

01:50:47.426 --> 01:50:50.507
It was poorly written, very dumbed down.

01:50:51.047 --> 01:50:57.390
All the references were the CDC, so it'd be like Sherry Tempany publishing a paper and every reference was written by Sherry Tempany.

01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:59.451
I was just hit with the best analogy ever.

01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:03.572
Look, ladies and gentlemen, you wanna understand how fucked up it is right now.

01:51:03.632 --> 01:51:04.853
I'm sorry, but I'm pissed.

01:51:06.413 --> 01:51:13.656
If you are a doctor or you are a PhD scientist and you're listening to this right now, this message is really for you.

01:51:15.106 --> 01:51:17.087
I want you to think of yourself as a baker.

01:51:18.407 --> 01:51:21.529
I want you to think of yourself as a baker.

01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:31.713
And I want you to think of yourself as somebody who bakes bread and supposedly is very good at it.

01:51:38.836 --> 01:51:42.078
And I want you to think about the idea that somewhere along the line,

01:51:44.341 --> 01:51:49.923
Somebody tells you to put something that you know doesn't belong in your bread, in your bread.

01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:55.885
And you keep doing it, and the bread doesn't rise like it ever did again.

01:51:57.185 --> 01:51:59.606
The bread starts to turn out a lot less reliable.

01:52:00.166 --> 01:52:01.286
It doesn't taste as good.

01:52:02.407 --> 01:52:04.007
It sometimes doesn't rise.

01:52:04.067 --> 01:52:05.308
It sometimes is flat.

01:52:05.408 --> 01:52:06.568
It's kind of unpredictable.

01:52:09.369 --> 01:52:12.630
And you as a baker simply cannot figure it out.

01:52:13.635 --> 01:52:14.775
It's too complicated.

01:52:14.935 --> 01:52:17.716
I just can't figure out why my bread never turns out.

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:19.976
I'm a baker.

01:52:20.156 --> 01:52:21.596
I'm an expert in baking.

01:52:21.797 --> 01:52:22.817
I can make donuts.

01:52:23.157 --> 01:52:25.237
I can make biscuits.

01:52:25.617 --> 01:52:37.059
I can make croissants, but my bread, when I make my bread and I follow the directions that I was given by my teacher, the bread never works out.

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:40.220
And I just can't figure out why.

01:52:42.577 --> 01:52:50.103
But when I don't add four cups of salt, the recipe works out a lot better.

01:52:50.143 --> 01:52:55.207
You know, instead, if I just put a teaspoon in, like the old recipe says, then it's fine.

01:52:55.628 --> 01:53:02.433
But if I put in a whole cup and a half of salt, my fricking bread doesn't turn out very good.

01:53:03.674 --> 01:53:04.575
This is a baker.

01:53:07.617 --> 01:53:12.481
She claims to know that baking with only a teaspoon of salt turns out a lot better.

01:53:12.521 --> 01:53:13.402
It's a lot healthier.

01:53:13.762 --> 01:53:21.329
Brian Hooker claims to know that baking with just a teaspoon of salt works out great for bread, but baking with a whole cup of salt can fuck it up.

01:53:23.491 --> 01:53:25.172
But he can't explain that to you.

01:53:28.255 --> 01:53:33.119
He can't tell you that putting a cup of salt in a loaf of bread is not going to work.

01:53:35.302 --> 01:53:54.988
but he claims to be a baker and he claims to be such an expert in baking that he or she in this case can give a bread baking 101 but still can't explain to you why putting too much salt in might screw it up, especially if you put it in, you know, right after or right before you put it in the oven.

01:53:57.031 --> 01:54:05.294
especially if you were to inject salt water into the middle of a loaf of bread right before you put it into the oven, it doesn't really work.

01:54:08.976 --> 01:54:12.417
But see, human biology is very, very similar to that.

01:54:12.477 --> 01:54:23.242
There's some very simple principles, some very simple sort of working assumptions that you could work under and arrive at a very simple explanation for why

01:54:24.628 --> 01:54:26.812
Vaccines are a bad idea.

01:54:28.134 --> 01:54:37.351
And the first thing you need to start out with is the idea that we are using the word vaccine so irresponsibly because it has no definition.

01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:48.989
And these people are very happy to keep doing that, to use a word like vaccines that can mean actually anything.

01:54:49.269 --> 01:54:54.815
It could mean a gelatin patch with little spikes on it that you put on your skin.

01:54:55.988 --> 01:55:02.213
It could mean an electroporated, an electroporated injection of DNA into your skin.

01:55:02.333 --> 01:55:06.315
It could mean an oral liquid that you swallow.

01:55:06.956 --> 01:55:11.059
It could be something that you, that you aerosolized and inhaled.

01:55:11.619 --> 01:55:16.923
And it could also be something that you injected into the skin or into the adipose tissue or into the muscle.

01:55:17.523 --> 01:55:25.349
And all of these things and many different combinations of substances administered in many different places can be described as a vaccine.

01:55:27.458 --> 01:55:35.765
And this is probably one of the most aspecific terms in the English language, and certainly one of the most aspecific terms in medicine.

01:55:35.785 --> 01:55:45.193
And yet these people, attempting to fight a battle against this illusion, continue to use the words of the illusion.

01:55:50.805 --> 01:56:00.914
And without fighting against the words of the illusion, without fighting against the definition of the words in the enchantment, the enchantment is never dispelled.

01:56:00.934 --> 01:56:02.636
The enchantment is only reinforced.

01:56:03.096 --> 01:56:09.442
So all this fancy talk, all this hot air means absolutely jack shit.

01:56:11.223 --> 01:56:17.149
If they've made no progress into distilling this down to a bad idea, which is what it really is.

01:56:20.171 --> 01:56:20.951
and penny, you know?

01:56:21.392 --> 01:56:22.913
It's like, how credible is this?

01:56:23.733 --> 01:56:26.715
And it was just terrible.

01:56:27.155 --> 01:56:30.757
So I thought, well, I better look a little closer, look at some other things.

01:56:31.197 --> 01:56:33.678
I guess I'll look at the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.

01:56:33.698 --> 01:56:35.419
Maybe they've got something about vaccines.

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:41.422
And that's kind of how the, you know, you had like a ball of yarn and you started pulling little threads and you just pulled and pulled and pulled.

01:56:41.943 --> 01:56:48.186
And so that initial investigation, I, you know, at that point in time, they had a lot of services.

01:56:48.226 --> 01:56:49.347
They really don't have them now.

01:56:50.475 --> 01:56:57.961
that you could subscribe to, that because you were a subscriber, you were able to get access to full text articles and things like that.

01:56:58.782 --> 01:57:02.004
And even at that time, when you went to buy an article, it was maybe five or $6.

01:57:02.665 --> 01:57:03.485
And now they're like 57.

01:57:03.786 --> 01:57:10.071
You know, my Baker analogy is actually better because it's not amount of salt, right?

01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:11.692
You know, you need a little salt in bread.

01:57:12.072 --> 01:57:13.673
So we shouldn't have even used that.

01:57:14.734 --> 01:57:18.077
We should have used something else that wouldn't normally be in bread.

01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:21.212
but you want to augment the bread to make the bread turn out better.

01:57:22.173 --> 01:57:23.074
I mean, it's crazy.

01:57:23.134 --> 01:57:29.540
It's really crazy because the most important point there to understand about that analogy is that these are bakers.

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:31.401
These are doctors.

01:57:32.273 --> 01:57:43.040
So when she says that she's going to put her mind to it and try to figure it out, it should be a doctor, a biologist, a detective, a mechanic that works on the human body.

01:57:43.501 --> 01:57:53.768
And so if a mechanic was going to try and figure out where that weird knocking sound was coming from in your car, a mechanic would have a pretty, pretty steady strategy.

01:57:53.808 --> 01:58:00.292
A good mechanic would have a rank order priority of strategies on what they would check first and second and third.

01:58:03.024 --> 01:58:17.791
So I would expect a professional 15 year experience doctor of the human body to have a pretty good idea of how they would like to prioritize an investigation into how and why vaccines may or may not be as good as everybody says.

01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:20.692
And instead she started with the CDC.

01:58:22.913 --> 01:58:29.096
That's almost like a mechanic who's trying to troubleshoot your car starting out with the, the AAA.

01:58:31.837 --> 01:58:38.139
You know, calling triple A. Like that's really remarkable how shitty your script is.

01:58:38.599 --> 01:58:41.740
And what you really need to see is that this is how exposed they are.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:50.822
This is how bad the trap that we are in is because there are enough mouth-breathing social media skillful users that will fall for this.

01:58:52.883 --> 01:58:57.764
Just like she said in that podcast yesterday, these people have like half of America's attention.

01:58:58.587 --> 01:59:02.350
with this nonsense, with this half-truths and lies.

01:59:03.811 --> 01:59:04.571
To like $75.

01:59:05.212 --> 01:59:08.814
And you may buy it, and it may not even be what you're looking for.

01:59:09.415 --> 01:59:11.456
And so these paywalls are just terrible.

01:59:11.816 --> 01:59:15.459
Back at that point in time, it was a little bit easier if you belonged to these services.

01:59:15.599 --> 01:59:22.524
So it was hard for her to figure it out because, you know, it's hard to get some of these papers because they're behind paywalls.

01:59:24.366 --> 01:59:32.993
Wow, I got this book off of eBay and then Mark found a PDF of it and this book just says it plainly, intramuscular injections, a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:59:35.941 --> 01:59:37.703
to be able to get access to them.

01:59:38.243 --> 01:59:48.572
So at that point in time, from September of 2000, when I started the initial investigation, that grew into 25 years and 50,000 hours worth of investigation.

01:59:49.132 --> 01:59:54.437
And it used to be- 25 years and 50,000 hours.

01:59:54.577 --> 01:59:56.218
Wow, that's a lot of wasted time.

01:59:57.479 --> 01:59:59.501
Because she still hasn't scored the touchdown.

02:00:01.384 --> 02:00:19.146
I feel like I've got to pad myself on the back here because I started out as bad as one could be, as fooled as one could be as an academic and got myself all the way past these people and to the goal in less than six years, less than five years really.

02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:23.822
25 years and 50,000 hours.

02:00:24.242 --> 02:00:25.222
Holy shit.

02:00:25.582 --> 02:00:43.011
That's an obsession of mine that I would be in the office from nine to six and I'd come home and I'd fix a little stir fry for dinner and I'd run upstairs to my upstairs office and I would be looking, going through as much as I could find about each one of the vaccines till two or three o'clock in the morning, seven days a week.

02:00:43.911 --> 02:00:48.472
There were times when I took two to three weeks off from my clinic practice.

02:00:48.953 --> 02:00:59.575
I found a little place on the beach, a little place on the beach in California, in Encinitas, and I'd go out there for three weeks and do nothing for 18 hours a day but research and write about this.

02:01:00.076 --> 02:01:08.718
And I started writing manuals for parents and manuals for doctors, and I was hired by a company called Apex Energetics.

02:01:09.278 --> 02:01:18.121
that they had just come out with a homeopathic line that had to do with prevention and treatment of things like measles and pertussis and that.

02:01:18.541 --> 02:01:29.445
And they hired me, and for two, because Armand, who is the president of Apex Energetics, we got to be pretty good friends, and he really believed in my message, and he hired me for about two weeks.

02:01:29.545 --> 02:01:30.826
What was her message?

02:01:32.017 --> 02:01:33.258
I don't know what her message is.

02:01:33.318 --> 02:01:35.360
She didn't even have a stance on vaccines.

02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:43.166
She did 25 years of research and 50,000 hours of research, and I still don't know what the end result is.

02:01:43.206 --> 02:01:44.207
What's the conclusion?

02:01:45.028 --> 02:01:46.228
That they're lying about stuff?

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:47.599
I don't get it.

02:01:47.619 --> 02:02:03.945
Two and a half years, that every other weekend I was on the road somewhere giving conferences to chiropractors and acupuncturists and nurse practitioners, a very, very few MDs or DOs that might wander into the mix for two and a half years.

02:02:04.205 --> 02:02:14.229
And so every other weekend I would be speaking to groups of 20 to 50, just planting all those seeds and then also talking about their product lines and stuff like that.

02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:16.290
She was a salesman.

02:02:16.771 --> 02:02:21.535
She was a salesman for a company that benefited from people who didn't want to take vaccines.

02:02:22.135 --> 02:02:24.177
And that's not, that's just the way it is.

02:02:24.357 --> 02:02:26.299
She's not, doesn't have a message.

02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.821
What is the message?

02:02:27.881 --> 02:02:29.342
That there are alternatives?

02:02:30.223 --> 02:02:32.044
That not all of them are safe?

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:33.666
That too many can be bad?

02:02:33.726 --> 02:02:35.527
That you shouldn't give them while they're sick?

02:02:36.929 --> 02:02:38.890
You should let your family doctor do it?

02:02:38.971 --> 02:02:40.252
What is her message?

02:02:41.624 --> 02:02:44.105
And so that's kind of how I got started in doing this.

02:02:44.185 --> 02:02:50.167
And I was, I wrote manuals and I, there wasn't, there wasn't the, um, there weren't sub stacks or anything like that.

02:02:50.207 --> 02:02:53.129
Then there was back in the day when you wrote blogs, you remember that?

02:02:53.609 --> 02:03:00.111
And so we did all, so that, and I put together two really thick, like three inch binders of material.

02:03:00.271 --> 02:03:04.113
I had, I made a lot of DVDs and, um, that was, um,

02:03:04.713 --> 02:03:07.297
DVDs were just getting started after VHS.

02:03:07.337 --> 02:03:08.338
Tells you how old I am, right?

02:03:08.719 --> 02:03:12.845
And that we had DVDs and we sent them all out and we made, we sold them.

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:15.528
And that was one of the product lines that we were selling.

02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:17.692
And, um, one day,

02:03:19.255 --> 02:03:29.262
I got a letter in the mail from some gentleman who was a retired from the military.

02:03:29.922 --> 02:03:36.127
And he was really, he watched my DVD, it was a three hour DVD called The Risk, The Benefits, and The Choices.

02:03:36.627 --> 02:03:39.389
And I went through all the different vaccines at the time, this would have been 2009.

02:03:42.594 --> 02:03:44.095
two or three, something like that.

02:03:44.635 --> 02:03:47.817
So there are a whole lot more vaccines that are developed since then.

02:03:48.237 --> 02:03:56.401
So I went through this whole thing and he wrote me a letter and he said, would you mind if I made copies of your DVD and handed them out?

02:03:57.041 --> 02:03:59.783
And I said, well, I do mind because we sell them.

02:04:01.223 --> 02:04:03.925
And he said, well, I found it on Google videos.

02:04:05.265 --> 02:04:08.547
Don't make copies of my video because I make money from it.

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:10.388
I wouldn't want to save kids for free.

02:04:12.287 --> 02:04:16.672
So I went out and looked at Google videos, and it had 57,000 views.

02:04:17.833 --> 02:04:20.896
I thought, oh, if I'd had a dollar for each one of those.

02:04:20.976 --> 02:04:22.738
Yeah, like I'm doing this as a vocation here.

02:04:22.758 --> 02:04:24.059
I'm spending my blood sweat and tears.

02:04:24.079 --> 02:04:28.424
Because I had to rent out studios and all those recording things and stuff like that.

02:04:28.804 --> 02:04:28.984
Wow.

02:04:29.204 --> 02:04:29.265
Wow.

02:04:31.707 --> 02:04:32.827
Oh, that's awesome.

02:04:32.867 --> 02:04:36.288
How more and more and more information started to get out there.

02:04:36.848 --> 02:04:41.009
And now 25 years in September, it'll be 25 years since I've been doing this.

02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.569
Wow.

02:04:41.729 --> 02:04:53.231
And I still, that's my whole life, you know, because it started, you know, it's like, if I'm not sleeping, I'm generally eating, writing, talking, investigating, researching something about vaccines.

02:04:53.711 --> 02:04:56.852
And I really have stuck with it because it's what God told me to do.

02:04:57.512 --> 02:05:01.776
You know, in 2002, I was sitting upstairs in my upstairs office.

02:05:02.556 --> 02:05:04.558
It was probably two o'clock in the morning.

02:05:04.578 --> 02:05:10.403
I remember I was sitting, my desk sat this way, and there was a window that looked out across the street.

02:05:10.863 --> 02:05:14.906
And it was snowing, like a little Rockwell moment out there, you know, coming down the street.

02:05:15.647 --> 02:05:20.931
And I was looking at information from the CDC's pink book about pertussis.

02:05:21.992 --> 02:05:24.775
And this was like the sixth version.

02:05:24.795 --> 02:05:26.276
There's now like 20 versions.

02:05:26.556 --> 02:05:28.418
And you can't even find the sixth version anymore.

02:05:28.999 --> 02:05:45.914
But it said, because people believe that there's a problem with vaccines and there's no syndromes of vaccines, and I'm paraphrasing, they said when a child has a seizure disorder, myoclonic jerks or dies of SIDS,

02:05:46.855 --> 02:05:51.002
Parents will blame vaccines, but it was really nothing to do with the vaccine.

02:05:51.062 --> 02:05:53.406
It had to do with the defective child.

02:05:54.725 --> 02:05:58.166
And I just sat there, just froze.

02:05:58.946 --> 02:06:04.087
And I just started sobbing, because I realized that that's truly what they teach physicians.

02:06:04.607 --> 02:06:08.948
It's not about all the garbage that's being injected into these little human beings.

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:15.149
It's about the defective child that can't stand up from the assault of all this poison.

02:06:15.829 --> 02:06:18.070
And I was just sobbing.

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.630
And I just said, Lord, why'd you give me this to do?

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:23.331
Why didn't you give me Tony Robbins go team rah-rah?

02:06:24.071 --> 02:06:25.692
I mean, why did you give me this to do?

02:06:25.732 --> 02:06:26.992
And I'm just crying and crying.

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:35.056
And I heard him say, I heard a voice out loud and I was the only person in the house out loud say, because you're willing to do the work.

02:06:35.076 --> 02:06:42.600
And it's like, I sat there for a second and I kind of looked around and I thought, well, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do.

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:43.520
Okay.

02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:44.021
I'm sorry.

02:06:44.041 --> 02:06:50.804
Um, I've been praying since I was a little boy.

02:06:52.082 --> 02:06:53.022
I've never heard a voice.

02:06:53.102 --> 02:06:54.103
I've never got an answer.

02:06:56.404 --> 02:07:06.727
And anybody that claims to have gotten an answer in a voice that they could hear needs to be one of the humblest people on earth and better have changed everything.

02:07:06.747 --> 02:07:15.011
You know, like, like what Alex said, when he, he heard this analogy about the dolphins and it totally changed his paradigm.

02:07:15.531 --> 02:07:21.333
If I heard a voice and I attributed it to not to somebody in my head, but to God,

02:07:24.389 --> 02:07:33.179
If I heard a voice that I attributed to my Lord and Savior in heaven, my whole life would change forever.

02:07:36.823 --> 02:07:45.193
And this woman is telling a story about hearing a voice that she's sure is God, and it hardly even broke her step.

02:07:49.821 --> 02:07:59.366
If you hear a voice that you attribute to your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and it doesn't change everything about your life, you might be a liar.

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:04.389
So I've never really stopped.

02:08:04.689 --> 02:08:08.492
And for the first three years, I was really angry.

02:08:09.052 --> 02:08:16.756
I was just, and the first three years I could say, I kept trying to find the house, out loud say, because you're willing to do the work.

02:08:17.657 --> 02:08:17.997
And it's like,

02:08:19.298 --> 02:08:24.283
I sat there for a second and I kind of looked around and I thought, well, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do.

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:27.046
So I've never really stopped.

02:08:27.347 --> 02:08:31.131
And, and for the first three years, I was really angry.

02:08:31.151 --> 02:08:33.153
I was just, and the first,

02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:36.435
For the first three years, she was really angry.

02:08:36.555 --> 02:08:36.955
I don't know.

02:08:37.596 --> 02:08:45.821
After praying your whole life and finally getting an answer in the form of verbal communication, I would have thought you'd felt pretty blessed for the rest of your life.

02:08:46.361 --> 02:08:53.406
I thought it would have changed everything about who you were because you'd finally have the confidence to know that you were backed up by the divine.

02:08:53.746 --> 02:08:59.430
You would feel like a ghost, like a blues brother all by yourself on a mission from God.

02:09:01.032 --> 02:09:03.294
but it doesn't really seem to have changed her very much.

02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:16.246
First three years, I could say, I kept trying to find the paper, the statement, the something of why we did this.

02:09:17.227 --> 02:09:19.108
Why are we injecting all this stuff into kids?

02:09:19.529 --> 02:09:22.611
Because we're so afraid of the measles or mumps.

02:09:22.972 --> 02:09:25.594
I mean, come on, a chicken pox, really?

02:09:25.614 --> 02:09:27.135
And so I, you know,

02:09:28.802 --> 02:09:36.329
I have a friend who's kind of come over and visit because I'm still alone and I actually have friends on this earth So I'm gonna cut this a little short.

02:09:36.429 --> 02:09:41.774
I apologize ladies and gentlemen That should be over here.

02:09:42.094 --> 02:09:43.355
No, this should be over here.

02:09:43.495 --> 02:09:49.060
And then this should be over here and then that should be there There was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality I

02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:55.223
And people like Shannon Joy are clowns.

02:09:55.303 --> 02:09:59.905
People like Mary Holland are probably military scripted traitors.

02:10:00.705 --> 02:10:09.249
She has probably been scripted by the US military or some branch of DOD or DITRA since she started out opposite Paul Offit in 2015.

02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:15.492
I think most of the people that worked at CHD minus Laura Bono were probably working for the military.

02:10:16.033 --> 02:10:20.395
Maybe many of them are actually connected to the private security company run by Gavin DeBecker,

02:10:21.475 --> 02:10:42.538
One of the things that I was trying to say earlier that still strikes me as pretty odd is that after Mary Holland left the campaign and came back to CHD in order to eventually be there to fire me, Bobby went around the United States complaining to everybody that the Biden administration wouldn't give him Secret Service protection.

02:10:43.462 --> 02:10:58.687
But Bobby had secret service protection for all of the time that he was at the head of CHD, almost like they were already protecting him like a future presidential candidate before he was ever even declared running for anything.

02:10:59.547 --> 02:11:12.772
He's had a private security detail since around the time that they wrote the book in 2008, where they said that he would run as vice president and then get taken by one of the two parties from an independent candidate to a vice presidential candidate.

02:11:15.017 --> 02:11:19.139
And yet he still raised money after Trump was elected.

02:11:19.199 --> 02:11:28.523
And after he was appointed to HHS, he raised money for the private security that he had to pay for during the fricking campaign.

02:11:31.044 --> 02:11:41.768
Bobby Kennedy is a scripted punk and he is probably being run by a military group inside of CHD and inside of Gavin DeBecker associates.

02:11:44.127 --> 02:11:45.728
And that's how this was done.

02:11:46.108 --> 02:11:52.673
CHD, ICANN, and the rest of these things are all spinoffs from the same basic core group.

02:11:53.633 --> 02:12:06.982
Mary Holland, Merrill Nass, Robert Malone, Brian Hooker, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and all the people that imagined that that core group would save the world right after they killed Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker.

02:12:08.632 --> 02:12:15.177
These people all knew or don't know that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality until I told them.

02:12:15.618 --> 02:12:18.440
But I told them that this was sculpted using murder and lies.

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:22.403
I told them that Denny Rancor was put in place to obfuscate that.

02:12:22.523 --> 02:12:26.186
I told them that Robert Malone was on this script with all of these people.

02:12:26.206 --> 02:12:29.389
And the reason why they ignored me is because they're on the script too.

02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:36.455
Because Skyhorse Publishing, Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, and CHD are the heart of the script.

02:12:37.537 --> 02:12:55.392
that will forever ignore the lack of antibiotic use, will forever ignore the impact on life expectancy from the opioid pandemic, and will forever, ever, ever ignore the illusion of virology, the illusion of endemicity.

02:12:56.707 --> 02:13:06.096
the illusion of the placebo effect versus using a placebo to greatly reduce the damage done by intramuscular injection.

02:13:06.236 --> 02:13:21.710
I'm starting to think that the placebo effect is a sort of exaggerated myth as well, which is to make sure that you don't think of the possibility that they have been using placebos across the schedule in order to get to where they are now, where

02:13:22.450 --> 02:13:34.155
We are willing to absolutely argue with our children that it's okay that we could give all of the vaccines from the entire schedule in one go, according to Paul Offit.

02:13:36.465 --> 02:13:43.893
And of course, nobody's ever going to talk about PCR because PCR is the remnant stream that they created and have maintained for the entire duration of the pandemic.

02:13:44.414 --> 02:13:46.076
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

02:13:46.196 --> 02:13:55.366
I'm going to have a beer and rest my voice, which probably needed more rest than I gave it today.

02:13:56.886 --> 02:13:59.148
These are the traders, ladies and gentlemen.

02:13:59.488 --> 02:14:04.033
This event in Bucharest, Romania was probably the most revealing event in the last five years.

02:14:05.073 --> 02:14:06.795
This paper is also pretty revealing.

02:14:07.976 --> 02:14:12.660
And my stream and my track record over the last six years is also pretty revealing.

02:14:13.201 --> 02:14:14.602
And I'm extremely proud of it.

02:14:16.118 --> 02:14:16.899
Thanks for being here.

02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:24.068
Thanks for understanding that it's gonna take a lot of repetition to get this done, but at least we know what we're repeating.

02:14:24.668 --> 02:14:25.709
Thanks very much for being here.

02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:26.631
See you again tomorrow.

02:14:50.345 --> 02:14:57.048
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you've been listening to is that of Jonathan Cooey, Chief Biologist of GigaOM Biological out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:14:57.088 --> 02:15:03.411
You can research his past work by looking up CooeyJJ on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

02:15:03.792 --> 02:15:13.596
You can also buy the book, Wuhan Cover-Up, support the wonderful, traitorous organization, Children Health Defense, and also get a copy of this historical book where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:15:13.836 --> 02:15:14.617
unwittingly

02:15:15.758 --> 02:15:18.340
Forever put Jonathan Cooey into history.

02:15:19.101 --> 02:15:20.162
There's my taco buddy.

02:15:20.582 --> 02:15:24.766
That's my broken science friend Jay Bhattacharya.

02:15:24.846 --> 02:15:28.630
I've got a website that I'm streaming from a couple different ones.

02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:30.832
Stream.GigaOM.bio is the real big one.

02:15:31.232 --> 02:15:36.817
If you want to find your way around go to GigaOMBiological.com and share that stream because sharing is how this works.

02:15:37.698 --> 02:15:39.579
If you want to help me out, that's the best way to do it.

02:15:39.639 --> 02:15:40.639
Please, please share.

02:15:41.159 --> 02:15:49.582
And if you really are generous enough to try and support my family, even with $10 a month, please go to gigohomebiological.com and find a way to do it.

02:15:49.722 --> 02:15:53.703
At there, you can also find all the links that you need to share everything, including stuff.

02:15:53.743 --> 02:16:01.826
If you go to stuff tomorrow, there will be probably three new PDFs and we'll start going over the first one, hopefully tomorrow.

02:16:02.266 --> 02:16:03.366
Thanks very much for being here.

02:16:04.527 --> 02:16:05.167
See you again soon.
