00:19.198 --> 00:24.017
A stained soul cringes at the small details in the mirror of embarrassment.

00:45.254 --> 00:49.657
You've done got your power, making everything's fine.

00:49.897 --> 00:54.800
Giving yourself credit, certain about what's next.

01:21.048 --> 01:38.704
I see you in your fancy hair Ain't no ego, never an ego, no ego center You're a man of position Go clean off that land

02:00.779 --> 02:02.935
Aren't going to save me, well

03:15.188 --> 03:18.894
Everything is homeless Working in your city Prisoner of misery

04:16.786 --> 04:19.147
Yo, welcome to the Spice Passa.

04:19.447 --> 04:20.807
And let's see how I'm pricey.

04:22.708 --> 04:23.969
Yo, you remember O'Hara.

04:24.009 --> 04:24.809
My boy, Sulu.

04:24.969 --> 04:25.489
Hey, y'all.

04:25.509 --> 04:26.209
What up, Spock?

04:26.269 --> 04:28.230
Baby, no salsa on the leather.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.111
Keep it on the chips.

04:31.791 --> 04:32.291
Hard work.

04:33.252 --> 04:33.472
Dope.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.493
James T. Kirk, president of the council.

04:38.354 --> 04:40.414
This boy love that leftover roast beef.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.655
Spock, it's solid beef, baby.

04:43.275 --> 04:44.896
He like it a little, you know, rotten.

04:46.181 --> 04:48.002
And this here is my sanctuary.

04:48.022 --> 04:51.425
See, this is where I chill, where I relax, where I chillax.

04:54.547 --> 04:57.409
Scotty, beam on down, baby.

05:01.392 --> 05:05.094
As always, Scotty, bringing the power.

05:05.134 --> 05:06.175
Oh, yeah.

05:06.195 --> 05:06.875
Oh, yeah.

05:07.175 --> 05:07.916
Oh, yeah.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.022
I did have some browser problems today.

05:18.182 --> 05:22.165
I'm still not sure how the timing's gonna be, what's going on here.

05:22.705 --> 05:24.806
My browsers don't open normally anymore.

05:26.087 --> 05:27.728
So I know that something's going on.

05:27.808 --> 05:36.194
I've been working pretty hard this morning to try and clean everything and work on figuring out what it is, but it's still not gone yet.

05:36.294 --> 05:41.218
So I'm still cautiously moving forward.

05:41.238 --> 05:44.060
Hopefully the timing and everything will, this will at least be okay.

06:08.387 --> 06:14.574
I'm still getting text messages from my kids' school telling me to put more money on their food card that they never use.

06:15.935 --> 06:17.777
And school ended two days ago.

06:17.857 --> 06:18.758
It's so bizarre.

06:19.679 --> 06:23.404
I don't understand the world we're living in, but it's definitely awful.

06:39.369 --> 06:46.296
If you all have not seen the video from yesterday, it's on BitChute and on Rumble and other places, please seek it out.

06:47.157 --> 06:52.302
Mark did a spectacular broadcast yesterday and it has been cleaned up.

06:53.003 --> 06:59.270
It had to be removed from YouTube, but it has been cleaned up and you can find it and share it with everyone, so please do that.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.166
Mark is getting punchier.

07:10.246 --> 07:12.126
Mark is definitely getting punchier.

07:12.186 --> 07:15.208
But you know, every once in a while, there's a little snooze-a-tronic moment.

07:15.248 --> 07:16.348
I mean, you know, that's what happens.

07:16.368 --> 07:20.130
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.211
We want everybody to feel good.

07:22.231 --> 07:24.592
That's not, that's not the way life is.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.995
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:32.825 --> 07:33.545
And I have lied.

07:33.565 --> 07:34.606
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:34.626 --> 07:35.567
I don't want to lie.

07:36.047 --> 07:37.388
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:37.488 --> 07:38.548
I try not to be a liar.

07:38.568 --> 07:39.409
I don't want to be a liar.

07:39.969 --> 07:42.730
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:45.172 --> 07:49.274
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

08:03.095 --> 08:04.837
What an interesting statement.

08:04.877 --> 08:06.519
We're looking for LARPers.

08:06.579 --> 08:08.441
That's exactly what we are doing.

08:08.501 --> 08:10.484
We are looking for people who are LARPing.

08:10.564 --> 08:11.325
It's a good one.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.025
It's a good one.

08:12.546 --> 08:19.294
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

08:25.325 --> 08:25.725
The End

08:53.194 --> 08:53.294
you.

09:19.625 --> 09:34.455
Good morning, everyone, from, uh, it's actually afternoon right now, six minutes afternoon, on Co-Weirdo, Weirdo, Weirdo, the sixth month of the sixth day, it's six minutes afternoon, and I didn't do it on purpose, that's strange.

09:35.656 --> 09:42.381
Anyway, this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief, brought to you by a biologist.

09:45.899 --> 09:47.780
Today will be an interesting stream.

09:47.820 --> 09:59.129
I do think it's possible we're gonna get a guest on the show today that has been around on the internet for a little while, I think, I guess.

09:59.689 --> 10:03.111
An anonymous account on the internet may join us for a little discussion.

10:04.833 --> 10:14.440
Not sure what we're gonna get out of it, but we're gonna try and stay focused as we usually do, because our consciousness is the prime real estate that these people are all competing for.

10:15.683 --> 10:21.011
And they definitely want us to believe in mythologies.

10:21.071 --> 10:22.854
They don't want us to ask these questions.

10:22.914 --> 10:31.606
So I'm hoping that our anonymous guest will be able to explain some of these observations or some of these ideas and why they're so wrong.

10:33.117 --> 10:38.999
that they and others have decided that the only way to combat this is to attribute bad motives to me.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.081
And I guess they attribute bad motives to other people, too.

10:44.141 --> 10:50.543
There are some mice out there that claim that the whole group of panda is just one big psy-op.

10:50.583 --> 10:55.145
There are people that say that Nick Hudson in particular is a psy-op, and I know that Jiki

10:56.345 --> 11:06.028
thinks that Nick Hudson is a psyop and is working very hard to convince everybody that he's a leader of an entire group of people that is a psyop.

11:06.208 --> 11:17.252
And so it's an interesting place that we're in because I don't really see how we're going to get out of it until we come to agree on some understanding about what they're trying to fool us about.

11:19.321 --> 11:30.708
And I think what they're trying to fool us about has to do with our history and how they're moving us forward, thinking that there are pandemics that we need to be protected from.

11:32.569 --> 11:34.630
And I don't really think that's true.

11:34.710 --> 11:41.374
I think that actually these charlatans have inherited power from their own mentors.

11:42.275 --> 11:45.096
And we inherited these charlatans from our parents.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.138
And so it's gonna take us a while to

11:48.038 --> 11:51.779
really see how bad we have been deceived.

11:53.740 --> 12:08.804
And I think that just like I was in 2020 and 2021, clinging to some of these things that I was sure I understood, I still think that there are a lot of people that really want us to cling to what we thought we understood.

12:08.824 --> 12:16.586
And if we're going to break free of this mythology and at the same time make gentle the life of this world, there's a specific way out of it.

12:17.944 --> 12:40.537
And it is to first acknowledge, I think, that they pretty much, the way that they created the pandemic, this artificial wave that you see here in this video, the way they created the pandemic was with a coordinated group of liars, people that agreed on a narrative and a mystery to solve and an argument to have and questions to ask.

12:40.617 --> 12:42.358
And I am making the argument that

12:43.354 --> 12:49.996
Wittingly and unwittingly, we have all been asking the wrong questions for an extraordinarily long time.

12:51.397 --> 13:02.460
And if we want to teach our kids how to ask the right questions, I really think we need to stay focused on the biology that we can really understand and verify.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.482
We need to not take the bait on social media, and we need to love our neighbors.

13:09.158 --> 13:11.498
People who share this work are the reason why this works.

13:11.538 --> 13:14.459
There's a few supporters out there, a few hundred people helping.

13:15.439 --> 13:21.661
But in reality, that's not enough for somebody to rent a house in Pittsburgh and raise three kids.

13:22.541 --> 13:25.001
And so we're doing other things to raise money.

13:25.081 --> 13:28.542
We're doing other things, but we're never going to stop this stream.

13:29.522 --> 13:32.183
This stream won't stop, even if we don't have any subscribers.

13:32.223 --> 13:38.124
But my goodness, am I thankful for every one of you that has decided to

13:39.437 --> 13:42.459
to support this work, it's really humbling.

13:44.761 --> 13:51.025
Because, you know, there are people like a lot of anonymous accounts on Twitter that think that I'm just a guy who sits in the back of my garage and

13:52.262 --> 13:58.606
uses drugs and rants into a camera and never has taught anything.

13:59.867 --> 14:03.469
At least that's the impression that I get from the way that they tweet behind me.

14:03.489 --> 14:07.832
I don't see a lot of it because I'm not actively participating.

14:08.992 --> 14:10.693
I'm engaging in non-compliance.

14:11.434 --> 14:18.258
I don't follow a lot of accounts and more importantly, I mute a lot of accounts because I don't think they have a lot to say.

14:27.456 --> 14:37.983
I screwed all that up with trying to get one thing up and then somebody walked in and then... I can't inflate basketballs right now!

14:43.891 --> 14:44.712
Good morning, everybody.

14:44.752 --> 14:49.174
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by Biologists.

14:49.234 --> 14:50.635
It's June 6, 2024.

14:51.996 --> 14:54.077
I'm going to give a very, very brief introduction.

14:54.137 --> 14:55.378
I am a human just like you.

14:55.398 --> 14:56.859
I'm not anonymous on the internet.

14:56.879 --> 15:02.923
I'm going to show up in person in South Dakota and give a presentation about what I think is happening here.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.384
I've had my name on the internet since the very beginning.

15:05.424 --> 15:05.845
That's why

15:06.365 --> 15:10.647
There's a record of me being removed from the University of Pittsburgh website.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.548
That's why there's a record of my work on PubMed.

15:14.109 --> 15:17.790
And I stand by these things that I've been saying for the last few weeks.

15:18.351 --> 15:23.193
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

15:23.713 --> 15:27.555
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA can't pandemic.

15:28.115 --> 15:41.632
And I'm hoping that the anonymous person that we're having on today will be able to clarify what part of this faith is actually real and what part of this faith is something that the biosecurity state has led us to believe.

15:41.672 --> 15:42.513
Because apparently,

15:43.494 --> 15:48.597
Some of these bad ideas on the internet are actually still being spread by me, according to this person.

15:49.278 --> 15:51.559
Now, I've shown you this picture a number of times.

15:52.019 --> 15:58.944
I believe there are a lot of non-anonymous people who are playing this game where they're happy to talk about how bad the COVID shots are.

15:59.344 --> 16:05.346
But they're less inclined to talk about what they were actually up to and what they were actually saying in 2020.

16:05.666 --> 16:10.368
And once you go back to look at what these people were doing, you find out that they weren't doing very much.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.489
They definitely were not saving anybody from what's happened to us.

16:14.509 --> 16:24.753
This is because a very strict, limited spectrum of debate was curated by these people that I'm calling a loosely organized worst case scenario team.

16:25.753 --> 16:30.335
And they included, I believe, a lot of anonymous accounts on Twitter and other places as well.

16:30.355 --> 16:37.477
But Twitter is one of those places that has been plugged since the very beginning of the pandemic as the place where the mystery is gonna be solved.

16:37.918 --> 16:45.920
And that's because the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses has been going on for decades.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.662
And this is the finest hour of that manipulation.

16:51.183 --> 17:06.902
I have been accusing very specific people of being put in place very early to be narrative curators, and a lot of these anonymous accounts just simply don't name any names and actually spend a lot more time on me than they do on people who are actually having an impact.

17:08.163 --> 17:21.630
And that includes people like Kevin McKernan who I've been featuring over the last week because he was on so many interesting podcasts in 2020 with so many interesting things to say that I can hardly stop talking about it.

17:22.390 --> 17:25.792
He was also promoted by CHD and in fact I think involved in

17:26.492 --> 17:30.054
And the whole turmoil that ended up in CHD having me let go.

17:30.474 --> 17:36.357
I've also called out Jessica Rose and Robert Malone as part of this same group of people.

17:36.397 --> 17:42.841
And the first time I came into real close contact with Robert Malone was actually on this podcast with Bobby Kennedy Jr.

17:42.861 --> 17:48.164
When I still thought that Bobby Kennedy was actually a really great guy and probably fighting for all these people.

17:48.644 --> 17:51.591
And now I've come to understand that I don't think that's the case at all.

17:51.651 --> 17:58.086
I think a lot of these people were put in place early and maybe even before the pandemic were misleading a lot of people to begin with.

17:59.246 --> 18:07.488
And so we are in the depths of trying to get out of this to extricate our children from this illusion that has been created over many, many years by these people.

18:07.949 --> 18:18.852
I've had a very personal experience with Brett Weinstein, such that I just find it laughable how he has risen, has some kind of pseudo-dissident when in reality he's definitely working for them.

18:19.392 --> 18:22.894
And I've pointed out that there are people on Twitter that meddle in this way.

18:22.954 --> 18:33.581
They attack me and they promote Brett Weinstein and these other people who were recently in Geneva telling us about the gain of function lab leak that was covered up.

18:34.242 --> 18:39.165
And so I've been naming names because I think it's really important at this point to name names.

18:39.565 --> 18:41.927
And I've been trying to summarize very well.

18:42.527 --> 18:46.390
And the response has been pretty exclusively attributing bad

18:47.470 --> 18:49.331
motives to the people who disagree with me.

18:50.031 --> 18:52.492
Here's an example of just such a thing.

18:52.532 --> 19:03.316
The guy that we're gonna have on right now has basically decided that the way to debate with me is to make a picture of me and put a crack pipe in my mouth and wants to remain anonymous.

19:03.356 --> 19:05.157
So I thought, you know, why not?

19:05.237 --> 19:10.459
Let's let the guy be anonymous then and come on and tell us his big story.

19:10.519 --> 19:14.060
So I guess we're gonna get a critique of our biology.

19:14.140 --> 19:15.961
This is canceled mouse, at least he,

19:16.781 --> 19:17.402
He says he is.

19:17.462 --> 19:17.822
Hello.

19:18.002 --> 19:19.984
I don't know your name, but it's great.

19:21.305 --> 19:22.146
Great that you're here.

19:22.646 --> 19:23.427
So take it away.

19:23.487 --> 19:24.708
I guess the floor is yours.

19:26.150 --> 19:28.512
Tell us what's going on and what we've gotten wrong.

19:29.858 --> 19:34.121
First of all, good afternoon to you, and my apologies to your audience.

19:34.321 --> 19:38.163
I am French, and therefore I am heavily accentuated.

19:38.183 --> 19:40.765
Tell me if I am unclear on something.

19:41.886 --> 19:54.194
Secondly, you started introducing your show, explaining that we had been attacking you, and that having... How would I say that?

19:54.434 --> 19:57.016
Being anonymous would be nefarious in intent.

19:58.044 --> 19:59.685
So we have two things to discuss.

19:59.745 --> 20:10.853
First of all, why you have been attacking us and why PANDAR indeed constitutes a psyops, being unable to address accurately various elements.

20:11.193 --> 20:25.203
You started yourself to attack me by saying that I was anti-American because I was calling out Nick Hudson on his absolutely shitty analysis of the Pfizer trial, of which I am an expert.

20:26.380 --> 20:45.973
So we have plenty to discuss why Nicholson doesn't attack efficiently the propaganda, or why we can be anonymous and deficient, or why Jiki has promoted your work for years until you started to attack mice.

20:46.093 --> 20:49.135
Sorry, I don't really understand.

20:49.196 --> 20:51.077
So you don't want to talk about biology at all?

20:53.526 --> 20:58.849
At which stage did we mention biology when you accused me to be an American meddler on the Pfizer trial?

20:59.369 --> 21:02.610
Oh, is that really the way we're going to go?

21:02.710 --> 21:04.691
This is not about biology at all?

21:04.751 --> 21:07.653
I think the meeting is already over.

21:08.453 --> 21:16.557
If you can anonymously behave and say anything you want on the Internet and no one can attribute any... We can't talk to you about it.

21:16.957 --> 21:18.677
We're not talking about the biology?

21:18.818 --> 21:19.178
Really?

21:20.018 --> 21:22.219
This is what you wasted all my time for?

21:22.299 --> 21:28.282
To accuse me of... I haven't wasted much of your time, given that you have given absolutely no preparation to the meeting.

21:28.302 --> 21:32.023
I offered you to prepare talking points, which you declined.

21:32.043 --> 21:35.645
I didn't decline anything.

21:35.705 --> 21:37.166
We said we were going to talk live.

21:37.306 --> 21:38.226
You declined.

21:38.986 --> 21:45.869
I offered you, everyone can find on Twitter, the proof that I'm telling... I can't follow all of the places that you tweet.

21:45.949 --> 21:46.970
That's not possible.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.110
You know how Twitter works.

21:48.190 --> 21:48.731
Why not DM me?

21:50.272 --> 21:53.074
I could not DM you before you DM me.

21:53.194 --> 21:54.395
You know that perfectly.

21:54.695 --> 21:56.256
You are a pure bad faith.

21:56.997 --> 21:58.598
You are just demonstrating bad faith.

21:58.678 --> 22:02.722
Everyone can read on Twitter that yesterday I told you that I couldn't DM you.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.523
And so today you're here.

22:04.843 --> 22:09.207
Today you're here and you're now accusing me of calling you anti-American.

22:09.407 --> 22:10.568
I don't understand.

22:10.948 --> 22:14.211
And so you can put a crack pipe in my mouth.

22:14.811 --> 22:15.992
Yeah, go ahead, please.

22:16.052 --> 22:16.453
Show me.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.614
Can I share my screen?

22:18.854 --> 22:22.035
Of course, please make an argument that's cogent.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.316
I'm trying, really.

22:25.476 --> 22:29.178
I would even like us to have a civilized conversation if you allow us.

22:29.198 --> 22:32.359
Then why would you put a crack pipe in my mouth, sir?

22:33.559 --> 22:35.520
Because you accused me to be anti-American.

22:35.580 --> 22:38.341
Anti-American is not the same thing.

22:38.401 --> 22:39.842
It's not the same thing.

22:44.690 --> 22:48.313
The average mouse on this platform is working against America.

22:48.353 --> 22:49.373
Is that attack on you?

22:49.393 --> 22:55.478
Who are you quoting and who is the mouse under your tweet, please?

22:55.618 --> 23:04.064
I would go so far as to say that the following anonymous accounts on this abomination of social media platforms is like offering your mind up for grabs.

23:04.144 --> 23:06.846
I'm saying that all anonymous accounts are shit.

23:07.406 --> 23:09.267
because a lot of them are meddlers.

23:09.307 --> 23:16.249
Are you gonna honestly say that you don't think that there are anonymous accounts that are causing much more trouble than the anonymous accounts that are doing good?

23:16.689 --> 23:17.029
Really?

23:17.069 --> 23:17.870
Do you believe that?

23:18.010 --> 23:22.131
I would agree with you on the fact that anonymous accounts are nefarious.

23:22.431 --> 23:25.332
I'm not attacking you there then, am I?

23:25.912 --> 23:27.113
Read English!

23:28.175 --> 23:28.735
Next!

23:29.096 --> 23:29.596
Next!

23:30.677 --> 23:31.918
No, so you're not attacking me.

23:31.958 --> 23:32.798
That's your position.

23:32.818 --> 23:40.003
I'm attacking all anonymous accounts that are working against America, pulling themselves out.

23:40.303 --> 23:55.673
Among all the anonymous accounts making nonsensical attacks, you chose to pick the video of a guy who is criticizing Nick Hudson on the prize of trial, subtitling, you can see, half true or false, every false statement of Nick Hudson in that video.

23:58.379 --> 23:59.100
Play the video.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.061
Can you play the video?

24:00.842 --> 24:01.482
Yes, of course.

24:03.284 --> 24:04.405
Hold on a second.

24:04.565 --> 24:06.167
Just pause it for a second.

24:12.881 --> 24:13.101
Yes.

24:13.281 --> 24:20.866
You have to go up to the top of your screen and click on original sound for musicians and then it'll play better because right now it sounds a little bad and I don't want it to play.

24:20.886 --> 24:23.127
I want everybody to be able to hear it so we get through it.

24:23.167 --> 24:26.850
Can I send you the URL by DM and you can play it on your side?

24:27.110 --> 24:27.610
Absolutely.

24:27.670 --> 24:27.810
Sure.

24:27.850 --> 24:28.271
That's great.

24:29.792 --> 24:34.194
Oh, but no, it won't because I'm sorry, but my, my browsers are, you can, they can hear it.

24:34.234 --> 24:34.815
You can play it.

24:34.895 --> 24:35.295
It's fine.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.336
Just go ahead and play it.

24:37.196 --> 24:38.397
My browsers are not working.

24:38.437 --> 24:39.298
It'll mess with our stream.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.962
when it came to hospitalizations, when it came to severe disease incidents.

24:46.522 --> 24:51.384
So perhaps can we already pause here because there have been already three false statements.

24:51.525 --> 25:02.750
Nick Hudson is explaining that on every clinical endpoint, the vaccine arm in the prior trial performed worse than the placebo, including hospitalizations, severe disease and deaths.

25:03.970 --> 25:09.872
Those three statements are false because his entire analysis of the clinical trial is false.

25:09.952 --> 25:19.256
First of all, the vaccine arm in appearance, of course, performed far better than the placebo arm in terms of hospitalizations and cases.

25:19.876 --> 25:27.659
Otherwise, the vaccine wouldn't have been authorized and promoted as a 95% efficacious product, which was, of course, entirely false.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.920
So what do you want to discuss in that?

25:33.141 --> 25:35.802
How, what are your disagreements with me on that?

25:36.702 --> 25:45.245
So, um, play it again because I don't, it's very hard for me to understand exactly what you're debating with him there.

25:45.765 --> 25:46.626
I don't get it.

25:47.386 --> 25:58.790
The vaccine arm of the first two trials performed much worse than the placebo arm when it came to deaths.

25:59.537 --> 26:03.638
when it came to hospitalizations, when it came to severe disease incidents.

26:04.659 --> 26:05.559
And so what do you mean?

26:05.659 --> 26:21.084
Are you saying that they didn't remove deaths from the... Precisely, I'm saying that they removed deaths, but in appearance, the data we have communicated via PHMPT and the studies which have been published absolutely don't show what Nicholson says.

26:21.824 --> 26:25.065
His entire angle of attack is completely wrong.

26:26.818 --> 26:27.719
Yeah, it could be.

26:27.739 --> 26:28.339
I don't know.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.940
I guess it's it's possible.

26:30.060 --> 26:37.246
But this this for me is I mean, you got I guess we got to keep playing it because I still think you're here by false pretenses.

26:37.326 --> 26:39.207
If you're saying that I was attacked.

26:39.227 --> 26:44.951
Yes, you are giving me you haven't been interested in asking me to present myself.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.454
You haven't been interested in having me exposing

26:48.894 --> 26:51.337
But here's what it is.

26:51.397 --> 27:01.250
Here's the problem that what you're doing with what I see you're doing is you're making it seem like I am attacking you in particular when I'm making a statement about all the mice in general.

27:01.950 --> 27:03.292
And there are a lot of them.

27:04.253 --> 27:19.438
now i've given you now i've given you now yes i am i'm attacking the mice i think geeky leaks is probably working against america and i think a lot of the other ones are as well this may be a bad tweet this may be i may have picked a bad video you may be right

27:20.018 --> 27:22.179
He may be wrong about that stuff Nick.

27:22.259 --> 27:23.200
I'm absolutely right.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.201
He's absolutely wrong.

27:24.301 --> 27:30.884
Okay, that's fine But let's talk about my biology and what I'm getting wrong because you put a crack pipe in my mouth.

27:31.105 --> 27:42.771
That's you know, but that's you So no, no, no, no, don't you don't get to come off of coming and calling me running short and getting unhinged again two days ago That's not allowed.

27:42.811 --> 27:47.654
You can't back that up because I called you an anti-american and now it looks like you were mistaken

27:48.375 --> 27:56.581
I called a lot of people an anti-American, and now you need to explain why you get to put a crack pipe in my mouth, or this is over.

27:57.202 --> 28:12.934
Because me calling you an anti-American in general, along with a lot of other accounts, is not worthy of putting a crack pipe in my mouth if you're not going to discuss my biology, the statements that I've made, and instead want me to argue for Nick Hudson, who could very well be a liar.

28:13.355 --> 28:15.737
It's very possible he's not an American.

28:16.337 --> 28:18.538
So you got me to say it and I'm fine with it.

28:18.578 --> 28:19.978
I've said it to Nick before.

28:20.379 --> 28:22.960
Believe it or not, we've actually had this conversation.

28:23.320 --> 28:31.823
So you're not getting anywhere until you admit that you put a crack pipe in my mouth, criticizing the last four streams that I've done apparently.

28:32.283 --> 28:33.944
And what are you critiquing?

28:34.024 --> 28:36.665
If it's just this, the meeting is over.

28:38.004 --> 28:38.885
Is it only this?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.166
Is this all you brought?

28:40.247 --> 28:48.296
Because then I'll just do a different show and I'll figure out whether he's wrong or right about this and I'll have Nick come on and explain it.

28:48.916 --> 28:58.988
But if this is all you've got, then you have brought yourself here to try and accomplish something you can't accomplish because there are only a few things that you need to address.

28:59.468 --> 29:11.254
The first one is, explain to me why it is that you get to put a crack pipe in my mouth because I said that you and a lot of other people won't admit that they murdered people and then called it a gain-of-function virus.

29:11.555 --> 29:15.797
Because that's what my tweet is underneath your crack pipe.

29:16.657 --> 29:18.058
So what are you talking about?

29:18.118 --> 29:21.360
You don't think they murdered people and lied about it and called it a lab leak?

29:22.199 --> 29:24.002
Because that's what you're distorting here.

29:24.022 --> 29:28.248
I think you're failing miserably at accomplishing what you thought you could accomplish.

29:28.288 --> 29:36.179
Because this tweet is weak, and Nick Hudson may be a liar, but you're a liar if you don't want to talk about my biology.

29:36.239 --> 29:38.042
You put a crack pipe in my mouth.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.061
Come back.

29:40.181 --> 29:40.721
I'm ready.

29:41.302 --> 29:49.350
I'm waiting for some comment about what we're getting wrong on GigaOM Biological.

29:49.430 --> 29:52.533
I'm sure it's difficult with your French background.

29:52.593 --> 29:53.594
I'm sure it's really hard.

29:53.894 --> 29:54.535
Oh, come on.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.785
I'll give you five more minutes.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.567
Just go ahead and tell me why it is you put a crack pipe in my mouth.

30:07.587 --> 30:08.508
I don't need five minutes.

30:09.009 --> 30:14.554
I think that we should both let an occasion to the other to place a sentence if we want to have a dialogue.

30:15.015 --> 30:18.438
Second, I'm showing here because I don't think that you're completely corrupt.

30:18.538 --> 30:21.120
I think that you may have been misguided in a few ways.

30:22.017 --> 30:24.559
Third, we have been speaking about... I'm waiting.

30:24.579 --> 30:25.400
Say something.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.741
Something concrete.

30:26.781 --> 30:27.742
I've been misguided.

30:27.822 --> 30:28.122
How?

30:29.003 --> 30:32.526
I have already established that you had attacked me before I attacked you.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.388
If you want to have a conversation, we can.

30:34.448 --> 30:38.631
If you want to attack me, you will find a worthy opponent.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.572
I can guarantee you.

30:40.153 --> 30:46.458
Second, I already established that my attack against Hudson was fine, and you recognize that he may be a liar.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.419
Okay.

30:47.819 --> 30:48.220
Okay.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.180
So now what?

30:49.941 --> 30:58.447
Third, you have explained that you haven't been paying a lot of attention to Twitter before to put a crack pipe in your mouth, for which I apologize.

30:58.787 --> 31:00.628
Oh, now you're going to apologize.

31:00.788 --> 31:01.188
Great.

31:01.268 --> 31:02.549
This meeting's over, dude.

31:02.609 --> 31:06.111
You're a fake and you need to write something up.

31:06.131 --> 31:09.774
I am certain that everyone who listens to that knows who is a fake here.

31:10.612 --> 31:11.132
Goodbye.

31:11.652 --> 31:12.273
Oh, there he goes.

31:12.293 --> 31:12.873
He's hanging up.

31:13.233 --> 31:13.933
There he goes.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.213
He's going to leave.

31:15.834 --> 31:16.234
Leave.

31:16.994 --> 31:17.374
Leave.

31:17.394 --> 31:18.795
Bye.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.815
Really?

31:19.895 --> 31:22.116
You're a knowledge retard.

31:22.236 --> 31:25.977
We can't have a conversation with you because you don't want to have a conversation.

31:26.477 --> 31:35.103
You want to have an accusation, you want to bring the debate on your field of expertise, while we have already demonstrated that you made an unhedged act against us.

31:35.503 --> 31:38.385
You are really, you are really a wonderful liar, though.

31:38.445 --> 31:39.446
It's really your skill.

31:39.526 --> 31:41.287
Oh, I'm really, I'm really telling the truth.

31:41.347 --> 31:47.931
As you passed in the introduction of the ridiculous Tucker Carlson, people can easily say who is telling the truth.

31:48.151 --> 31:53.715
I am very confident that no one in the audience is thinking that you are seriously trying to have a debate here.

31:54.595 --> 31:55.876
What debate are we having?

31:55.916 --> 32:01.239
You're trying to say that a single tweet is something that gets a crack pipe in my mouth.

32:01.279 --> 32:09.243
No, I'm trying to say that for over a year now, you have been attacking every of your former friends in the show, and that everyone who has supported you, including myself.

32:09.343 --> 32:10.503
Who are you talking about?

32:10.523 --> 32:12.724
You're not making any accusations.

32:12.804 --> 32:14.145
Who are you talking about?

32:14.205 --> 32:15.106
Just everybody?

32:15.286 --> 32:21.249
We could speak about Charles Rixely or Kevin McCann, who have both offered you to debate several times and which you declined.

32:21.769 --> 32:22.049
Really?

32:22.309 --> 32:24.190
Are those the ones that you believe?

32:24.330 --> 32:25.290
Are those the ones that you believe?

32:25.330 --> 32:26.251
Oh, we can speak about myself.

32:26.471 --> 32:27.231
I supported you.

32:27.811 --> 32:28.091
When?

32:29.232 --> 32:32.553
When you were banned, I was the first to denounce your ban on Twitter.

32:32.693 --> 32:33.493
Oh, well, guess what?

32:33.534 --> 32:37.075
I wasn't paying attention to anonymous accounts, so I didn't pay attention to you.

32:37.175 --> 32:42.437
And to provide an entire backup of your tweets on an alternate platform.

32:42.517 --> 32:43.617
And so then now why?

32:43.637 --> 32:45.498
Are you really ashamed that you did it?

32:45.578 --> 32:48.079
I contacted you by email in 2022 to offer you help.

32:50.760 --> 33:06.993
uh in every uh data or technical and so you think i should have i should have i should have taken an anonymous account and said oh yes please help me give me money from france that sounds good plenty of people did i work with a lot of phds who accepted my help and were delighted to have done so

33:08.706 --> 33:10.686
Are you saying that they are all dumb?

33:11.587 --> 33:15.948
Are you the only possessor of a... I don't understand the argument you're making.

33:16.168 --> 33:25.510
I think you... The argument I'm making is that we work seriously while you do clone shows, and that the Panda, indeed, is an anti-op psyops.

33:25.910 --> 33:26.790
I can explain why.

33:27.050 --> 33:27.270
Who?

33:27.290 --> 33:27.870
Panda.

33:28.890 --> 33:33.171
Panda, your friends weren't your friends because they attacked you.

33:33.191 --> 33:34.372
I don't know who are you saying.

33:34.452 --> 33:35.752
Who is a psyop what?

33:37.298 --> 33:41.700
Who is he talking about?

33:41.740 --> 33:42.980
Can you tell me what he's saying?

33:43.040 --> 33:43.501
Panda?

33:44.521 --> 33:45.181
Yes, Panda.

33:45.661 --> 33:47.982
So Panda is a group of a lot of people.

33:48.362 --> 33:51.084
There are lots of groups like that that are infiltrated.

33:51.164 --> 33:52.464
CHD is one of them.

33:53.044 --> 33:54.125
ICANN is one of them.

33:54.525 --> 33:56.926
The International COVID Summits are one of them.

33:57.826 --> 33:59.867
All of these groups are infiltrated.

33:59.907 --> 34:00.887
I'm not surprised.

34:00.907 --> 34:01.708
I agree with that.

34:01.808 --> 34:02.388
Even the mice.

34:03.872 --> 34:04.714
Even the mice.

34:04.814 --> 34:17.173
And so now again, we come back to you making this all about yourself getting attacked when you knew all along that I was attacking all the mice that you already admitted twice now are infiltrated with a lot more bad people than good.

34:18.095 --> 34:21.516
Of all the mice, you chose me, attacking Nicholson.

34:21.536 --> 34:26.277
I chose random because I tweet very little and I tweet just to annoy.

34:26.317 --> 34:29.118
You chose absolutely not random.

34:29.138 --> 34:31.259
No, you're making it about yourself again.

34:31.279 --> 34:32.519
I don't know who you are.

34:32.539 --> 34:34.400
I don't know who you are.

34:35.253 --> 34:37.735
You never gave me your name in two years.

34:38.195 --> 34:39.837
I don't know who any of these people are.

34:39.877 --> 34:40.757
That's the point.

34:41.158 --> 34:45.021
You haven't put anything on the line because your name has never been out there.

34:45.381 --> 34:47.343
My name's been out there in the newspapers.

34:47.703 --> 34:48.884
People know where I live.

34:48.904 --> 34:49.945
They come to my house.

34:50.285 --> 34:53.448
You've risked nothing and you put a crack pipe in my mouth.

34:54.512 --> 35:04.500
In your opinion, is the fact that I didn't took risk stupidly to achieve nothing, the fact that... Oh, so we've taken risk stupidly to achieve nothing.

35:04.961 --> 35:07.162
That's your estimation of what I've done.

35:07.343 --> 35:08.584
I've taken risk to achieve nothing.

35:08.604 --> 35:09.224
No, absolutely not.

35:09.244 --> 35:10.325
That's not what I have said.

35:10.365 --> 35:12.267
You are trying to misrepresent what I have said.

35:12.947 --> 35:29.578
I am saying that my position, being public, would just be a stupid risk, achieving nothing, because it would bring no pertinent credential to the element, because I have never been focused on credentials in life, and that I don't need it to be efficient.

35:29.799 --> 35:32.561
This is not going anywhere.

35:32.641 --> 35:34.562
I don't understand what you want to accomplish.

35:34.822 --> 35:35.983
What do you want to accomplish here?

35:37.443 --> 35:39.149
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

35:39.189 --> 35:39.851
About what?

35:40.453 --> 35:42.721
What are you going to enlighten us on?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.025
Do you have a message or not?

35:44.864 --> 35:47.525
I offered you several angles on what you said yourself.

35:47.765 --> 35:49.225
You say you're just a human.

35:50.226 --> 35:52.666
Do you have a message or not?

35:52.766 --> 35:58.348
Because my viewers like to have information, so I'm giving you the opportunity to be very clear.

35:58.368 --> 36:00.869
I already passed very clearly my message.

36:01.269 --> 36:05.490
I said that I was considering that most of the panda leaders were upside ups.

36:05.970 --> 36:08.371
Indeed, there are good people inside, thankfully.

36:09.171 --> 36:20.242
and that for the rest you had been attacking mice without basis, stealing topics on which we had worked years before you, and... That's ridiculous!

36:20.562 --> 36:21.583
That's ridiculous!

36:21.663 --> 36:25.887
Years before you, it's... I'm sorry, we're not gonna... You just said you didn't...

36:26.127 --> 36:28.108
You just said you didn't want to do credentials.

36:28.188 --> 36:29.789
Now you're saying who was in front of who.

36:30.269 --> 36:32.710
I've already admitted that I didn't know what was going on in 21.

36:32.770 --> 36:33.390
I was lost in these people.

36:33.410 --> 36:35.151
You said, but absolutely no one knows me.

36:35.251 --> 36:38.372
I know probably more leaders of the anti-vaxx movement than you.

36:38.392 --> 36:39.813
Okay, you know more of the leaders.

36:40.513 --> 36:42.274
Drop more names, telephone numbers.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.955
I don't understand what your message is.

36:44.235 --> 36:48.436
If you don't have a message, like in a few minutes, I'm not going to waste any more time.

36:48.996 --> 36:55.577
My first message would be that Pfizer can be attacked efficiently and that Sashirer, Tipova and Nikketson are full of shit.

36:55.738 --> 36:57.378
I can explain why if you let me.

36:58.018 --> 37:11.201
And my second message is that if you want to have a real conversation on our analysis, I think that you will find that we agree on most topics, as Jiki has been supporting you for years.

37:11.801 --> 37:14.883
And so then it makes sense for you to put a crack pipe in my mouth, right?

37:14.923 --> 37:22.207
Because if we agree on most things, again, you keep coming back to, I attacked you, but it just seems like you can't read English.

37:22.267 --> 37:22.767
That's all.

37:23.307 --> 37:26.429
I'm sorry, man, but it's not making sense to me.

37:26.689 --> 37:27.970
It's not making sense to me.

37:28.430 --> 37:29.151
It's really not.

37:29.431 --> 37:31.272
I think you're kind of, I think you're lying.

37:32.085 --> 37:32.666
I don't know.

37:32.766 --> 37:37.310
But why don't you tell me, for example, the message you just said is very attractive to me.

37:37.370 --> 37:40.613
Tell me why Sasha Latupov is wrong and why Pfizer can be attacked.

37:40.653 --> 37:43.436
I've already said they're going to throw Pfizer under the bus three years ago.

37:43.936 --> 37:45.217
Why not attack Moderna?

37:45.838 --> 37:46.919
Why not attack Moderna?

37:47.878 --> 37:49.320
Can I formulate a full sentence?

37:49.420 --> 37:51.622
First, I agree with you, why not attack Moderna?

37:51.642 --> 37:57.068
The reason is that we don't have a Moderna data because Pfizer has been fed to us to keep us busy.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.832
Second, why is Sacha Tipova is full of shit?

38:01.032 --> 38:04.236
It's because she has been made rich by Pfizer themselves.

38:04.736 --> 38:07.557
you can check that her husband is Michael Toterman.

38:07.737 --> 38:12.739
You're not going to actually claim that you brought that up before Mark Kulak or anybody else did, are you?

38:13.159 --> 38:13.819
Absolutely not.

38:13.899 --> 38:16.640
I have credited Mark for the Toterman information.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.282
On the other hand, we digged far deeper in the past links of her daughter.

38:21.362 --> 38:26.824
I mean, you've seen that Sasha Latapova is all over the internet telling everybody that I'm an idiot, right?

38:27.717 --> 38:29.897
But you and I agree on most things.

38:29.937 --> 38:34.578
But you and I agree on most things, but you haven't noticed that, I guess, huh?

38:34.998 --> 38:35.819
That's interesting.

38:36.639 --> 38:39.539
Indeed, you haven't been paying attention, as we said.

38:40.200 --> 38:48.141
So you can attack me and not answer my replies afterwards, but I can't put a crack pipe in your mouth for doing that.

38:48.541 --> 38:49.661
OK, that's noticed.

38:50.282 --> 38:56.103
And second, I can't attack Nick Hudson on my domain of expertise because he is holy and sacred.

38:56.403 --> 38:57.083
Is that your point?

38:57.743 --> 39:00.165
You're arguing about what Pfizer reported.

39:00.465 --> 39:03.426
So I don't even know why we're running in that hamster wheel.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.927
You think Pfizer reported the truth?

39:04.947 --> 39:09.910
Because we could, for example, have an interesting conversation to establish that Pfizer tested its product on people.

39:09.930 --> 39:16.433
And as long as we do that, as long as we have that very interesting conversation, we're not saying that they murdered people and lied about it.

39:16.513 --> 39:18.614
And that's what the goal of all these mice is.

39:18.654 --> 39:26.279
We could also say how and when they murdered people and lied about it if we were trying to have a conversation and why it connects to Pfizer.

39:26.299 --> 39:27.039
But that's why...

39:27.459 --> 39:29.960
That's what I said when you put a crack pipe in my mouth.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.221
I tweeted that.

39:31.401 --> 39:36.363
I said that the mice won't talk about them murdering and calling it a gain-of-function.

39:36.403 --> 39:39.604
The mice won't talk about it and you put a crack pipe in my mouth.

39:39.944 --> 39:41.545
Sorry, that's what you did.

39:42.145 --> 39:43.086
That's what you did.

39:43.146 --> 39:50.209
So it looks awful lot like to everybody on the internet that the mice think that Jay smokes crack because he thinks gain-of-function is a mythology.

39:51.072 --> 39:52.294
Do you see what you did?

39:52.574 --> 39:53.876
Do you see what you did?

39:54.316 --> 39:58.081
You are so disingenuous, it makes me kind of ill.

39:58.902 --> 40:03.929
We were the first to discuss the Yatros genocide, so your point is mute.

40:04.149 --> 40:06.392
You are coming in a...

40:07.353 --> 40:08.934
I'm sorry, I can't do it anymore.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.395
This is the person that I'm supposed to talk to.

40:12.756 --> 40:17.878
As someone found Crackpot's weed, he's running short again and getting unhinged.

40:17.958 --> 40:24.622
And what I had tweeted was, they murdered people and pretended it was a gain-of-function virus and none of these mice will say it.

40:25.618 --> 40:26.679
And he won't say it now.

40:26.739 --> 40:30.001
He wants me to have an argument about whether Nick Hudson is a liar.

40:30.461 --> 40:37.727
And he wants me to have an argument about whether Pfizer should be taken down and how to do it and whether Sasha Latupova is right or not.

40:38.187 --> 40:43.471
And as long as we talk about that, we're not calling all of these people liars.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.740
Instead, we're doing something dumb.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.601
We're doing something really dumb.

40:49.081 --> 40:50.761
Like we're allowing these people.

40:51.381 --> 40:52.601
Oh, what is going on here?

40:52.681 --> 40:54.582
Give me my, everything is hacked.

40:54.722 --> 41:01.783
I don't know if it's working or not, but everything is not really functioning well with my computer right now.

41:01.943 --> 41:03.563
And I don't know what else to do about it.

41:05.184 --> 41:07.944
Maybe PowerPoint needs to be killed or something like that.

41:08.024 --> 41:11.525
I'm gonna end the show right now and I'm gonna, maybe I will,

41:12.751 --> 41:16.692
Maybe I will do something later to replace this after.

41:18.253 --> 41:24.415
Yeah, I'm gonna reboot and then I'm gonna go ahead and do the stream that I was gonna do.

41:24.935 --> 41:28.857
It's called Levitt Unfolding and then we'll do that in a minute.

41:28.977 --> 41:30.657
So I'm gonna reboot and see what we get.

41:30.757 --> 41:31.278
Thanks guys.

41:32.318 --> 41:33.038
You still hear me?

41:33.598 --> 41:35.199
Was it synced?

41:35.379 --> 41:36.700
I mean, is that still synced?

41:40.242 --> 41:43.445
I'm just actually shocked that this is the way it is.

41:44.807 --> 41:47.409
I'm just really shocked that that's where we are.

41:48.731 --> 41:49.792
I love you guys all very much.

41:49.832 --> 41:50.753
I'll be back in a few minutes.
