02:00.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh, timeout, JC on the bike.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
JC on the bike. It's JC on the bike. It's JC on the bike, yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning and I know just the one.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
Look at round. It's JC on the bike. Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Test one, two, testing one, two.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
That's not going across yet.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This is going to cut fast, I think.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
This is Gigaohm Biological.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I think you can hear me.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I don't have my headphones in.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm just going to hit play

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
and sit back and relax.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I gave a long talk,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and then I went home.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So I'm going to play

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
and I'm going to play

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and I'm going to play

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and I gave a long talk

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and I went right to basketball practice

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
and I came back and I tried to

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
find some food and stuff

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
and then, sorry, that's still too long.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And so I'm just going to hit play

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
and then there's lots of

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
there's lots of

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I had a really good

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
session with this group of doctors.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
There's a little bit of repetitiveness

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
for you guys.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But it's a little bit of a new

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
spin on what I've been saying

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
over and over again, so it's just another

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
repetition of the jazz song.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But some of these people have not heard this beat

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
before, and it was really important for me, especially

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
because Thomas Binder was there.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
This guy from Switzerland

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
who I have a great deal of respect for

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I've been connecting to

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
for a while and never managed to do it.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Michael Palmer was also

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
there and a few other people.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Veer Sharab showed up, so it was

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
really nice.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So anyway, I'm just going to

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
escape out of that.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And I think I'm right

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
there.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And I think I need to do this

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
too.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And then

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
um

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I guess I'll just shift

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
over.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And I'm just going to hit

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
play and I'll be here for questions and

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
stuff, but

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
for the most part I think I'll just let it go.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, JJ Kiwi,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
thank you very much for joining us

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
today. You have been

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
you worked with this group

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
long ago in 2021.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So it's nice to see you here

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
again, and I

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
really liked your

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
title that you proposed.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm very curious

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
about your

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
presentation.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Did you agree

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
to have your presentation

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
recorded and posted? Absolutely.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's fine with me if you can hear me.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So in that case

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
it might be good if we started

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
with a brief

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
introduction from you about yourself.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Absolutely. Say a few words.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
OK, very good. And I will just

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
hand it over to you. Thank you very much.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Thank you. In case you're not seeing

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
me as full screen with your little

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
gallery above, you got to go to the view

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
up in the upper right and click on that and click on

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
speaker and then you will see me.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
But most of the time I'm actually going to shift

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
myself down here into the corner if you don't

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
mind. This is the one time you're going to

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
see my little logo. I apologize for that.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That cut. There we go.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So if you can see me down here

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
in the corner, sometimes if I need to be

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
up in your face, I'll put it up

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
like this. So 30,000

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
foot perspective of the pandemic

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
and ideas on how to teach the

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
biology correctly. So I'm not coming here

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
thinking that you guys are

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
are new to this. I, as

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
as Michael alluded to,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I followed you guys very

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
early. I actually came

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
to Doctors for COVID Ethics

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
as still a working

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
thinking. I was a member of this group

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
called Drastic on Twitter that had solved

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
the puzzle of the lab leak.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And I was still struggling within

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
that group to try and to get them to understand

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
that transfection was a really bad idea

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
and wasn't vaccines, but they were very

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
focused on the origin.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And I just, if you want to know

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
where I'm from,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm originally

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
a neurobiologist. So this little

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
picture is an electron

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
micrograph of two neurons that I made

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
a recording from. Basically

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I manipulated mice both

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
alive and very

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
recently dead to

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
record from small

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
microcircuits in the brain and

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
manipulate those microcircuits again

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
alive and dead to see how

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
they're connected, how they grow, et

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I spent about 20 years as a microscope

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
jockey doing this.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
The highlight of my career was

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
working with Edward and Mabryt Moser

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
in Norway. And a year after

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I left their lab, that lab was awarded

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
the Nobel Prize in 2014

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
for physiology

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
and medicine. So that was kind of cool.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It made my CV pretty

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
strong. If you want to check it out, you can

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
put my last name in PubMed and you

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
can find all of the crazy

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
nonsense I was involved in.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I want

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to try and start out with my main

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
message, which is

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
that a weaponized

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
illusion of consensus

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
has been formed over the last three

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
years. And it might feel

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
like to some people that we are

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
escaping it. But in reality, the

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
escape is actually the final

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
trap door.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I want to convince you by the end of

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
this talk that we've been led to believe

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
that there was a novel virus that

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
killed millions of people, that millions

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
of more were saved from, that likely came

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
from gain of function and therefore will

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
come again. But I want to

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
really argue that in order to

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
free our family and friends, we need to

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
get them here without actually them

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
knowing they're going to get here. Because

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
this, it pretty much involves

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
accepting that everybody's been lying to

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
them. And that's something that's hard for everybody

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
to accept. So I've been trying

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
a way to get us there

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
with regard to biology. So I've come up

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
with these three statements. And again, I'm starting

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
right with the meat of the talk because I don't

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
want to insult you guys and waste your time by giving

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
you all kinds of introductions on biology

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
or immunology or the pandemic and

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
all the things that happen because you guys are

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
familiar with it. You've been busy with it from the beginning.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
But I wonder if you haven't seen

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
my stream before, if you've ever heard things

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
codified kind of like this. So intramuscular

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
injection of any combination of substances

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
dumb. I use the word dumb

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
because that makes a lot of sense to people

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
who aren't typically biologists.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Transfection in healthy humans

10:42.000 --> 10:43.460
is criminally negligent.

10:43.460 --> 10:47.340
I use those words because it is my belief now

10:47.340 --> 10:49.860
that after three years of trying to explain to people,

10:49.860 --> 10:51.980
this has always been transfection.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.060
It's never, it's not a new word.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.860
It's an old word that has always applied to this.

10:56.860 --> 10:58.260
And we just started calling it

10:58.260 --> 11:01.700
an investigational vaccine for other purposes.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.820
Yeah, that's what makes it criminally negligent.

11:03.820 --> 11:07.980
There isn't a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh

11:07.980 --> 11:09.300
that shouldn't have done known better

11:09.300 --> 11:10.820
that this was transfection

11:10.820 --> 11:13.580
and that it would be inappropriate for healthy humans.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.000
So in a way, any doctor that gave this

11:16.000 --> 11:18.180
is criminally negligent if they didn't look into it,

11:18.180 --> 11:20.620
if they didn't find out, or if they permanently,

11:20.620 --> 11:25.380
or if they purposefully ignored those signals in their head.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.540
And then finally, I wanna say viruses aren't pattern

11:28.540 --> 11:31.660
integrities and I'm trying to tap into this,

11:31.660 --> 11:33.920
what I think was largely,

11:35.140 --> 11:37.100
I hate the word psychological operation,

11:37.100 --> 11:38.420
but that's the best I can do.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.860
With this idea that there's no virus at all.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.900
Because what that is is a very unsophisticated way

11:45.900 --> 11:49.180
of addressing the lack of fidelity in this field,

11:49.180 --> 11:51.780
the lack of fidelity in RNA viruses,

11:51.780 --> 11:54.940
and the biology that's attributed to them,

11:54.940 --> 11:57.220
but it is a disingenuous way of doing it

11:57.220 --> 12:00.180
so that you actually don't ever get to the real answer.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.700
So this is the heart of my talk.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.180
This is what I wanna get across these three things.

12:04.180 --> 12:07.100
And then hopefully by the end, you won't still hate me.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.100
The reason, or rather, the story that I've been telling

12:11.100 --> 12:13.060
the people that watch my stream

12:13.060 --> 12:15.700
is that we've been tricked into solving a mystery.

12:15.700 --> 12:19.220
And the analogy that I use is Scooby-Doo,

12:19.220 --> 12:21.460
which is a cartoon show from America

12:21.460 --> 12:25.420
where teenagers and their dog would solve mysteries

12:25.420 --> 12:28.060
in different towns that they traveled through,

12:28.060 --> 12:30.300
then it always inevitably would result

12:30.300 --> 12:32.300
in people getting the mask taken off,

12:32.300 --> 12:34.700
and the ghost, or the monster,

12:34.740 --> 12:36.780
or the voodoo doctor,

12:36.780 --> 12:38.740
is actually just some rich guy in town

12:38.740 --> 12:40.660
who's trying to rip everybody off.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.300
And the reason why I thought it was an apt analogy

12:43.300 --> 12:45.180
is because I think we've been tricked

12:45.180 --> 12:48.740
into trying to solve the mystery of the laboratory leak,

12:48.740 --> 12:51.620
the mystery of where did this virus come from,

12:51.620 --> 12:53.820
and the way that they tricked us

12:53.820 --> 12:56.820
into solving this mystery is to getting us

12:56.820 --> 13:00.260
to accept the idea that there is pandemic potential

13:00.260 --> 13:02.820
of coronaviruses in bat caves

13:02.860 --> 13:05.820
that is accessible via cell culture,

13:05.820 --> 13:07.260
or animal passage,

13:07.260 --> 13:10.460
and more recently through genetic stitching.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.980
And they have seeded this idea

13:12.980 --> 13:14.700
for not just the last three years,

13:14.700 --> 13:16.220
but for earlier than this,

13:16.220 --> 13:17.900
as soon as they figured out

13:17.900 --> 13:20.020
that whatever this RNA signal was,

13:20.020 --> 13:23.300
it wasn't going to be useful as a bio-weapon.

13:23.300 --> 13:27.300
But it would be useful as potentially a psychological weapon.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.260
That's what they've done.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.500
They've created this illusion of consensus

13:30.500 --> 13:33.540
that you've started to hear already in 2020

13:33.540 --> 13:37.740
as a worst-case scenario being a gain-of-function bio-weapon

13:37.740 --> 13:40.940
that could wipe out millions, if not billions.

13:40.940 --> 13:43.140
And since the start of the pandemic,

13:43.140 --> 13:45.660
we've heard this repeated over and over on the left

13:45.660 --> 13:47.940
and the right, on the red and the blue,

13:47.940 --> 13:50.380
and it's all about the same thing

13:50.380 --> 13:52.560
because if you accept this possibility

13:52.560 --> 13:54.620
and then pass it to your children,

13:54.620 --> 13:57.480
your children will be trapped in this mythology forever.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.160
And so I'm not at all saying that there are no viruses.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.680
I'm not at all saying that there are no biological signals

14:04.680 --> 14:05.560
at this size scale.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.400
I'm not at all claiming any of that.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.760
But what I am saying is that this faith

14:10.760 --> 14:12.960
that there is pandemic potential in caves

14:12.960 --> 14:15.880
that can be tapped into and laboratories and leaked

14:15.880 --> 14:16.760
is a faith.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.280
There is no evidence for this in the medical literature.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.440
And that's part of the reason why the no-virus people

14:22.440 --> 14:24.400
have so much ground to stand on.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.360
I apologize for the blower in the background.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.280
I hope you don't hear it.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.640
I'm in my garage, so I have to heat it.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.840
So in this faith of a novel virus, we accept,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.520
and we have been made to accept that vaccination worked.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.480
And that's how we got rid of all previous disease.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.800
And you know that people hammer that all the time.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.480
We've also been made to accept that zoonotic jumps happen,

14:44.480 --> 14:47.480
that PCR false positives are rare,

14:47.480 --> 14:49.560
that asymptomatic spread is real,

14:49.560 --> 14:51.720
that variants are evidence of that evolution

14:51.720 --> 14:53.720
and that we spend money on gaining function research.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.240
This is all accepted by everybody.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.400
And it doesn't matter if you're a far left person

14:58.400 --> 15:01.960
or a far right person, you've basically accepted all of this

15:01.960 --> 15:06.400
if you've been a skilled TV watcher for the last three years.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.040
And I'm calling it a new world order with little bat symbols

15:10.040 --> 15:13.920
like a north-faced symbol, because I

15:13.920 --> 15:16.560
want to take this phrase back, because that's

15:16.560 --> 15:17.200
what they're doing.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.280
They're replacing all of the previous governing

15:21.280 --> 15:23.320
mythologies about who are the bad guys

15:23.320 --> 15:26.120
and who are the good guys with a mother nature

15:26.120 --> 15:29.080
and bio-weapon-based mythology that they can govern us

15:29.080 --> 15:33.360
into the future forever, across languages and cultures.

15:33.360 --> 15:38.840
And it's an illusion of consensus about the core ideas

15:38.840 --> 15:41.440
that are the foundation of this that have been thrown

15:41.440 --> 15:43.360
at us for three years.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.120
And so I've been trying to figure out,

15:45.120 --> 15:49.520
where have these people been in 2020, even in 2019?

15:49.520 --> 15:52.000
What were they saying about this biology?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.040
And it's become very obvious that all of them, all of them,

15:55.040 --> 16:00.040
were involved in ceding this worst-case scenario narrative.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.080
And it basically comes down to something

16:02.080 --> 16:04.360
that Noam Chomsky said, and that is

16:04.360 --> 16:06.560
that the smart way to keep people passive and obedient

16:06.560 --> 16:09.360
is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion,

16:09.360 --> 16:12.880
but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
And so I would like to make the argument

16:14.880 --> 16:17.800
that instead of releasing a bio-weapon and trying

16:17.800 --> 16:20.040
to kill the whole planet, they have

16:20.040 --> 16:23.880
released a series of narratives at a series of theaters,

16:23.880 --> 16:26.280
which have led us to believe that the thing to argue

16:26.280 --> 16:29.720
about is whether or not it was a lab leak or a natural virus,

16:29.720 --> 16:31.800
but accept the fact that it was a pandemic,

16:31.800 --> 16:35.640
a spreading RNA molecule that started out as a puddle

16:35.640 --> 16:38.920
and then covered most of the lungs of primates

16:38.920 --> 16:42.520
and deer over the last three years.

16:42.520 --> 16:46.760
And that's an extraordinary claim for all practical purposes

16:46.760 --> 16:49.320
and RNA molecule wrapped in a lipoprotein.

16:49.320 --> 16:56.200
And so I want to suggest to you that some of the people

16:56.200 --> 16:59.080
that you trust are responsible for ceding, guiding,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.400
and even maintaining this pandemic confusion,

17:02.400 --> 17:05.080
and some of them don't know what they've done.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.440
But I want you to listen to this 2017, very brief,

17:08.440 --> 17:09.960
this is the only thing I'm ever going to play

17:09.960 --> 17:14.280
that's a video description of how a pandemic could be ceded

17:14.280 --> 17:15.840
without ever using a pathogen,

17:15.840 --> 17:18.320
but just using the appearance of one.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.160
I hope the volume will be OK.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.320
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.120
I want people to complain.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.800
Can you hear that or do I need to change my sound settings?

17:31.800 --> 17:32.480
We can hear it.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.000
OK, good.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Thank you.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.360
So what do I do?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.600
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.320
I want people to complain.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.560
So what do I do?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.840
I go to Des Moines.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.200
Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen,

17:45.200 --> 17:46.240
I have nothing against Des Moines.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.320
I live there for four years.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.560
I go to Des Moines.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.640
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.000
I go to Seattle.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.240
I infect a couple of cases there.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.200
I go to North Carolina.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.040
I go to Wisconsin.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.720
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology

18:01.720 --> 18:03.680
to be able to infect sentinel cases

18:03.680 --> 18:06.240
with a highly morbid condition.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.560
These individuals complain.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.640
Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.280
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.920
It'll produce some cascade of neurological

18:14.920 --> 18:17.720
and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.360
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.600
I take attribution for that.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.480
Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.360
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent

18:28.360 --> 18:32.440
and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x, y, and z.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.360
These people are really sick with this.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.880
But then I say, others who are also infected

18:36.880 --> 18:41.160
will show subdramal, predrome signs of lethality

18:41.160 --> 18:44.800
and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness,

18:44.800 --> 18:46.560
agitation.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.840
What I've now done is I've got every individual who

18:48.840 --> 18:51.040
is diagnostically hypochondriacal.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.400
And I've got every individual who's

18:52.400 --> 18:55.240
the worried well flooding the public health system banging

18:55.240 --> 18:56.360
on the door.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.880
The CDC comes back and says nonsense.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.480
That's not real.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.000
I understand that this analogy is not quite right.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.160
But of course, you can see, I hope,

19:07.160 --> 19:10.720
how the discussion of a covered up lab leak

19:10.720 --> 19:13.640
and the discussion of a pandemic originating somewhere

19:13.640 --> 19:16.320
in Wuhan could easily be distorted into something

19:16.320 --> 19:18.080
just like this.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.800
And instead of needing to seed really deadly cases,

19:21.800 --> 19:26.600
they need to see a few TikTok videos of very deadly cases

19:26.600 --> 19:28.480
in places where you don't live.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.680
And the other places only need to have tests that turn out

19:31.680 --> 19:35.360
positive, maybe a sequence that turns out positive.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.520
And so it's very important to really consider,

19:38.520 --> 19:43.840
if you haven't, the real fractional necessity,

19:43.840 --> 19:46.440
how many cases would really need to be real?

19:46.440 --> 19:49.240
In my humble opinion, I can sum it up pretty succinctly

19:49.240 --> 19:51.920
to say that the only cases that needed to be real,

19:51.920 --> 19:54.200
depending on what real meant.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.400
If you're going to culture the virus and sequence it,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.120
then you need enough RNA to do that.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.680
But if you're not going to do that,

19:59.680 --> 20:01.640
then there are a whole bunch of different ways

20:01.640 --> 20:03.960
for that to have been a case.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.800
And of course, I'm not telling you anything you don't know.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.760
I just want you to consider it in a different way.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.080
I want you to consider the idea that what our job now is

20:12.080 --> 20:15.560
is to pull all these people in to try and get them

20:15.560 --> 20:18.600
to consider the possibility that everybody involved

20:18.600 --> 20:23.200
in bioweapons and intelligence and the Department of Defense

20:23.200 --> 20:25.360
and all these other things has a vested interest

20:25.360 --> 20:28.320
in lying for a living, either by omission

20:28.320 --> 20:31.720
or by outright lying for national security reasons.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.120
And once it's for national security reasons,

20:34.120 --> 20:37.000
they'll lie on camera consistently, together.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.320
And so I'm trying to paint a picture

20:41.320 --> 20:43.520
where, wittingly or unwittingly,

20:43.520 --> 20:46.560
a number of people who have been promoted on social media

20:46.560 --> 20:50.040
who are on our team have been staying very far away

20:50.040 --> 20:52.800
from questioning the novel virus that killed millions of people

20:52.800 --> 20:54.960
that millions of more were saved from the gain of functions

20:54.960 --> 20:57.920
likely the source of and will come again.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.000
They don't question it.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.040
And that is a danger because if we teach our children this,

21:03.080 --> 21:04.560
they will live like this.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
And so what I want to suggest is happening

21:07.840 --> 21:09.960
and I apologize if everybody here has seen it,

21:09.960 --> 21:11.800
but I can't believe that that's true,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.840
is to imagine this analogy here that this kid

21:15.840 --> 21:19.760
is pretending to stop the train

21:19.760 --> 21:23.520
and imagine that I take my son's sixth grade basketball team

21:23.520 --> 21:25.080
and I take him to this subway station

21:25.080 --> 21:26.800
and they see this guy doing it.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.320
My sixth grade basketball team is not going to believe.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.680
They're 11 years old.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.480
They're not going to believe that this guy is capable

21:32.520 --> 21:33.840
of stopping the train,

21:33.840 --> 21:35.760
is necessary for stopping the train,

21:35.760 --> 21:37.520
nor are they going to believe that he's pushing it

21:37.520 --> 21:38.480
or even helping it.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.480
Now, on the other hand,

21:40.480 --> 21:45.480
if we had 150 large rugby players from New Zealand,

21:46.920 --> 21:50.040
and we fitted them with machines on their arms

21:50.040 --> 21:51.760
that made a lot of noise and sparks,

21:51.760 --> 21:54.840
and then we had them all coordinatedly do the same thing

21:54.840 --> 21:56.120
that this guy's doing,

21:57.640 --> 22:01.640
and coordinate the lights and make a little smoke

22:02.480 --> 22:05.280
and have the guys go, oh, when they stop it,

22:06.520 --> 22:08.400
the boys would have a lot harder time

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
disbelieving that they were actually stopping

22:10.400 --> 22:11.240
and starting the train.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.160
They might start to think, wow,

22:12.160 --> 22:15.240
this is a pretty cool subway, it's human powered.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.600
And what I want to suggest to you

22:16.600 --> 22:18.120
is that at the beginning of the pandemic

22:18.120 --> 22:21.400
with good planning and concise lying,

22:22.400 --> 22:25.240
then the debate about a novel virus

22:25.240 --> 22:27.360
and everybody being vulnerable

22:27.360 --> 22:30.120
could be one person standing next to this train.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.520
The mass casualty events that were misconstrued as spread,

22:33.520 --> 22:34.880
like what happened in New York City,

22:34.880 --> 22:37.840
that Jessica Hockett and others have documented so well,

22:37.840 --> 22:40.120
would also be another person standing at this train

22:40.120 --> 22:42.160
pretending to stop and start it.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.400
The mass non-specific PCR tests

22:44.400 --> 22:47.640
and lateral flow tests in the UK, a same thing.

22:47.640 --> 22:52.360
And so the more novel stories about the novel virus

22:52.360 --> 22:55.080
that needs new solutions that we have to talk about

22:55.080 --> 22:57.760
and argue about is more people standing at this train

22:57.760 --> 22:59.480
and pretending to stop and start it.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.760
And what I would like to argue is that that was planned

23:04.760 --> 23:06.440
and there are many of these people

23:06.440 --> 23:09.040
who, whether we like it or not, are involved

23:09.040 --> 23:13.000
and you can see it because they don't do this math correctly.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.720
In America and all around the world,

23:14.720 --> 23:18.360
the thing that was shown, can you see my arrow was here?

23:18.360 --> 23:19.600
And this graph wasn't shown.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.240
They shown this graph more in the UK

23:21.240 --> 23:22.440
than they ever did anywhere else,

23:22.440 --> 23:25.160
but this was all you ever saw in America.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.120
The blue in this graph, if you've never seen this before,

23:28.120 --> 23:31.600
is pneumonia and it starts at 2014

23:31.600 --> 23:33.960
and it goes all the way to 2022.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.000
The light blue here where my arrow's now bouncing

23:37.000 --> 23:39.720
is the all-cause mortality in the United States.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.320
So this is where the pandemic starts,

23:41.320 --> 23:44.640
but this is how we were shown it with the graph in red.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.160
And you can see there's an unprecedented increase

23:47.160 --> 23:50.120
tripling almost of deaths due to pneumonia

23:50.120 --> 23:52.440
that's never occurred in the history of America

23:52.440 --> 23:53.360
and that's very odd.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.800
We've had that under control for quite some time.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.280
I would like to just point out, for example,

23:59.280 --> 24:03.600
that these four guys spoke in front of Parliament

24:03.600 --> 24:06.360
about the shots, I understand that,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.320
but they have been speaking around the world

24:09.320 --> 24:11.320
at many events over and over again

24:11.320 --> 24:13.440
for almost two and a half years

24:13.440 --> 24:16.480
because none of Robert Malone, for example,

24:16.480 --> 24:19.400
didn't start speaking out until June of 2021.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.000
So let's make sure that we realize

24:21.000 --> 24:22.360
that's a year and a half in

24:22.360 --> 24:25.000
or a year and two months into the pandemic

24:25.000 --> 24:28.200
where a lot of other people were speaking out in 2020.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.960
But these people have never started to question

24:31.960 --> 24:36.520
the misuse of these graphs

24:36.520 --> 24:38.280
and the misuse of excess deaths

24:38.280 --> 24:42.080
to sort of tally up how many people have died.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.560
They will say over and over

24:43.560 --> 24:44.840
that millions of people are dead.

24:44.840 --> 24:45.840
They will not subtract

24:45.840 --> 24:48.440
and do not resuscitate orders in New York City.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.840
The ventilators, the lack of antibiotics,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.960
the poor use of steroids, remdesivir, medazolam.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.840
In America, we have an opioid epidemic

24:56.840 --> 25:00.800
that is killing between 150,000 and 200,000 people a year.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.640
It's undercounted and it's underreported.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.000
It's under cared for and it contributes to excess deaths

25:07.000 --> 25:09.760
because it kills people of all age groups

25:09.760 --> 25:10.960
that shouldn't be dying.

25:12.160 --> 25:16.000
And those numbers, if you just do silly accounting,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.400
like, look, there's excess deaths,

25:17.400 --> 25:20.280
can be misconstrued as the spreading of a virus.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.320
But we know from Denny Rancor's data

25:23.320 --> 25:25.720
that there is no evidence of geographic spread

25:25.720 --> 25:27.360
and their dang well should be.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.720
Finally, death certificate fraud

25:30.720 --> 25:32.040
and all the other things that add up,

25:32.040 --> 25:33.200
the whole point of this is,

25:33.200 --> 25:34.640
oh, those are supposed to already be there,

25:34.640 --> 25:35.560
sorry about that,

25:35.560 --> 25:38.400
is that there's zero epidemiological evidence of spread

25:38.400 --> 25:39.760
and we all ignore this.

25:39.760 --> 25:42.720
We all, as in the people that are up on top

25:42.720 --> 25:44.480
of the social media platforms

25:44.480 --> 25:48.320
telling, pretending, I think, to be fighting for us

25:48.320 --> 25:51.520
because they're not questioning the narrative.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.120
They're not questioning this idea

25:53.120 --> 25:56.080
that in 2019, something was released

25:57.240 --> 25:58.680
and it spread around the world.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.200
This is the first scenario, a bat cave zoonosis.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.160
So you see the years are going here along the X axis

26:07.160 --> 26:08.480
and each stripe is a new year.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.560
The earth is green in this scenario,

26:11.560 --> 26:13.520
just kind of saying that lockdowns, protocols

26:13.520 --> 26:14.840
and vaccines have saved lives.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.160
The second is a laboratory zoonosis,

26:17.160 --> 26:18.280
exactly the same thing,

26:18.280 --> 26:21.920
but now it's a lab instead of a bat cave.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.240
The third scenario is something

26:25.240 --> 26:29.200
like a genetically altered virus,

26:29.200 --> 26:32.280
but the point is is that the earth is clean in 2018.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.720
The earth is clean in 2019 and then it's dirty

26:34.720 --> 26:38.960
at the end of 2019 and that dirt spreads from a puddle

26:40.440 --> 26:44.640
and it spreads around the world with extremely high fidelity.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.600
We can track it like we've never tracked

26:46.600 --> 26:51.200
any RNA molecule before and we're still tracking it now.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.240
And there's a huge illusion of consensus

26:53.240 --> 26:55.320
that this is just how it is,

26:55.320 --> 26:58.200
that there's nothing unprecedented here at all.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.040
Even though before 2019,

27:00.040 --> 27:03.520
how much data do we have about circulating RNA coronavirus

27:03.520 --> 27:08.480
is almost zero, almost zero.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.480
And before the start of the pandemic,

27:10.480 --> 27:14.760
they used to lament about the inability to survey them

27:14.760 --> 27:17.160
because they're so hard to detect,

27:17.160 --> 27:19.540
we need a pan coronavirus test.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.680
And then as soon as the pandemic started a coronavirus test

27:25.680 --> 27:29.720
that was specific for just one was extremely easy to make

27:29.720 --> 27:33.600
and up to 200 different emergency use authorized forms

27:33.600 --> 27:34.720
in America alone.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.960
And so the faith just took over

27:37.960 --> 27:39.880
and we just started following that faith.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.880
But the real question is,

27:41.880 --> 27:44.840
is how do we know it's not a conflated background signal

27:44.840 --> 27:47.240
that there are all kinds of RNA and DNA

27:47.240 --> 27:49.320
in the background at that size scale?

27:49.320 --> 27:52.800
And we sample it as if there's only viruses there.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.800
No exosomes, no vesicles, no endogenous viruses, nothing.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.680
And that's disingenuous.

28:02.680 --> 28:06.840
And it's certainly disingenuous to say that we can assess

28:06.840 --> 28:11.840
what the total RNA signal in the background was before 2019

28:11.840 --> 28:14.360
and say that it was free of this new signal,

28:14.360 --> 28:17.480
which we are now measuring with ultra high fidelity

28:17.520 --> 28:19.400
down to the amino acid or sorry,

28:19.400 --> 28:24.400
the nucleic acid in a 30,000 or whatever base pair RNA genome.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.600
And so we must get our kids off this train.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.160
If our kids grow up believing this faith

28:36.360 --> 28:38.960
without the sophistication to question it,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.480
then they're gonna be lost forever

28:41.480 --> 28:43.080
because they will grow up believing

28:43.080 --> 28:44.680
that we defeated diseases.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.720
We always defeat them with vaccines,

28:46.720 --> 28:48.200
just like the TV says,

28:48.200 --> 28:49.280
they're gonna grow up believing

28:49.280 --> 28:51.880
that another pandemic can come from a bad cave,

28:51.880 --> 28:53.440
nevermind a laboratory.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.000
Even Robert Malone was in front of Parliament saying

28:56.000 --> 28:57.960
that actually with a bachelor's degree,

28:57.960 --> 28:59.400
you can do it in your garage.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.920
That's almost word for word.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.360
And so PCR false positives are rare,

29:04.360 --> 29:08.240
but we know that they've confounded this idea.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.920
For you people in the, I hope for this audience,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.600
it's sophisticated enough to say that,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.600
I wonder if you're aware that in academia,

29:16.600 --> 29:19.320
when you do PCR, it's always nested primers.

29:19.320 --> 29:23.240
And that's what gives them such great specificity.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.080
But as far as we know, in America and Canada and elsewhere,

29:27.080 --> 29:29.000
there's never been a nested primer test

29:29.000 --> 29:33.080
for coronavirus at least before 2021.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.000
And they really never used it in Canada.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.160
And as far as I can tell,

29:37.160 --> 29:40.720
they never used a nested primer set in America ever.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.120
And so that means that the PCR test isn't specific.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.920
And if they aiming at homologous genes,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.800
then they're also never going to find anything,

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
but just background.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.160
It's like saying that you have a very specific test

29:55.160 --> 29:56.800
for a certain year of Mercedes,

29:56.800 --> 30:00.680
but in reality, you're just looking for four rubber wheels.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.760
And so again, we can't let our kids grow up believing

30:06.760 --> 30:08.680
that gain of function virus is something useful.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.080
So this is my strategy for dispelling this mythology.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.000
We have to revisit this role of sanitation,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.960
nutrition and better medicine and decline of disease.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.400
But that's been done in many books.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.560
We just have to, of course, teach those to our children.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.520
We have to recalculate all cause mortality during 2021.

30:23.520 --> 30:28.200
We have Rancor and Hockett and John Bodwin and others

30:28.200 --> 30:29.880
who are doing it, but we need more people doing.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.360
We probably need state funding to do that right.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.480
Reevaluate the role of criminal negligence.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.840
That's what I'm going to still talk about now.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.960
It's why it's yellow.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.880
And then strict liability, of course,

30:39.880 --> 30:42.320
is the idea that you make a product

30:42.320 --> 30:44.840
and you're responsible for what happens with it

30:44.840 --> 30:48.120
unless you provide the warning of what could hurt you.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.280
So if you sell ladders, you have to put a warning on it

30:51.280 --> 30:52.960
that says that you can fall off the ladder

30:52.960 --> 30:55.640
and get extremely injured, so be careful.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.880
And when you sell drugs on TV in America,

30:57.880 --> 30:59.240
you have to tell all the side effects,

30:59.240 --> 31:01.920
including that it could cause your heart to explode

31:01.920 --> 31:05.560
or whatever, that you have to say all those things.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.720
But for vaccines, you don't.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.600
So it's very simple.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.320
Restore strict reliability to all vaccine products.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.000
Anything else would be just not acceptable.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.760
And finally, teach the concept of life

31:14.760 --> 31:18.360
as an impossibly complex pattern integrity.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.160
So we'll do those three things and then we'll quit.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.080
I'm going to go as fast as I can.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.240
Remember that we're just doing these three points,

31:25.240 --> 31:28.200
but we're trying to get people to come to this,

31:28.200 --> 31:33.200
these conclusions and understand them in a sort of

31:33.520 --> 31:36.720
a way that a biologist, not necessarily a biologist,

31:36.720 --> 31:38.960
but somebody who's not a biologist can understand.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.560
So the first one was injection

31:41.560 --> 31:43.160
and any combination of substances

31:43.160 --> 31:45.400
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.600
So the way to explain this to your family and friends

31:47.600 --> 31:49.240
is to talk about epithelial cells

31:49.240 --> 31:52.920
and how the immune system is oriented around them.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.080
So the first arrow here is pointing to stomach acid.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.840
The first line of defense is skin, mucous membranes,

31:57.840 --> 32:00.160
silly as stomach acid, urine flow.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.920
We are basically need to teach people

32:02.920 --> 32:04.280
what the immune system is.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.480
So in every place in the body,

32:06.480 --> 32:09.600
the immune system is oriented around a barrier.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.200
And a barrier is that's formed by epithelial cells.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.160
And so if you're going to give an introduction

32:15.160 --> 32:16.520
to the immune system to somebody

32:16.520 --> 32:17.600
who doesn't know anything about it,

32:17.600 --> 32:19.560
you got to point out to the fact that no matter

32:19.560 --> 32:21.440
where you look at the immune system,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.560
it's oriented around that barrier.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.020
And so the first thing I want to do is draw this picture

32:26.020 --> 32:27.280
that I drew for somebody else

32:27.280 --> 32:28.560
and it worked really well.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.320
So I'm going to try it here again.

32:30.320 --> 32:33.280
And I apologize for anybody that this is too little

32:33.280 --> 32:35.040
and too belaboring, but I'm trying again

32:35.040 --> 32:37.000
to help people who want to try and teach

32:37.000 --> 32:38.440
their family and friends.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.640
I'm going to draw a really simple picture of the body

32:40.640 --> 32:42.360
and I'm going to try and orient it

32:42.360 --> 32:44.160
with regard to the immune system.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.760
And so if I draw it like this

32:50.760 --> 32:52.760
that looks kind of like an ion channel,

32:55.080 --> 32:57.360
then there's a hole that goes through the body like that,

32:57.360 --> 32:58.200
right?

32:58.200 --> 33:02.240
And so this is food in and poop out, right?

33:02.240 --> 33:06.160
And so we're going to go, this is the body.

33:06.160 --> 33:10.440
And so this side in here, this is all interior,

33:10.440 --> 33:12.160
but it's actually not interior, right?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.640
It's still the outside of the body.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.560
So you have a tube that runs through your body.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.840
And this is how I explain to my kids.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.080
And that tube is still the outside world.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.320
The tube, or the bag inside of your lungs here

33:25.320 --> 33:27.960
that I'm coloring in is also the outside world.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.080
And all along this barrier

33:30.120 --> 33:35.120
is the same basic orientation of the immune system inside out.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.080
All of the defenses are organized inside out like this.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.840
And you could draw the same thing on this side,

33:42.840 --> 33:43.680
but I don't really need to

33:43.680 --> 33:47.360
because there's no lungs over there, but it is.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.200
And so on the inside of this barrier,

33:51.200 --> 33:55.040
then we all know, because we're all doctors and PhDs

33:55.040 --> 33:56.840
and we're readers and we've learned this

33:56.840 --> 33:57.880
over the last three years

33:57.880 --> 33:59.560
that we didn't know beforehand,

33:59.560 --> 34:02.080
is a system of the lymph nodes

34:02.080 --> 34:05.040
where all of these cells reside

34:05.040 --> 34:07.880
to kind of respond to the needs of the barrier.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.560
Now, the reason why this is most important

34:10.560 --> 34:12.520
to understand is very simple.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.480
How do I tell my parents who haven't talked to me

34:15.480 --> 34:17.760
in three years because I'm a know-it-all

34:17.760 --> 34:20.200
that they shouldn't get injected anymore

34:20.200 --> 34:22.200
without giving them a three-hour lecture

34:22.200 --> 34:24.440
that sounds like a know-it-all about the immune system?

34:24.440 --> 34:26.040
Well, I draw a picture like this and I say,

34:26.120 --> 34:28.920
so if you want to augment the immune system

34:28.920 --> 34:32.040
and it's orientated this way to protect the inside,

34:32.040 --> 34:34.160
why would you inject something here?

34:37.280 --> 34:39.240
And it's just that simple

34:39.240 --> 34:40.920
because you can go at as far as you want.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.760
You can explain that oral vaccines go in this hole.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.360
And so they actually expose themselves

34:47.360 --> 34:49.760
to the outside of the barrier here.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.720
You can say that we used to variolate for smallpox

34:53.720 --> 34:55.520
and that's again scratching the skin

34:55.520 --> 34:57.680
on the outside, so that's the barrier again.

34:58.640 --> 35:03.640
And so most of the cases where we have some historical reason

35:03.840 --> 35:07.040
to believe that vaccination or immunization worked,

35:07.040 --> 35:09.960
we were always antagonizing the immune system at the barrier.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.320
We were never injecting intramuscularly

35:12.320 --> 35:15.200
and that's become a very recent advance

35:15.200 --> 35:18.240
in our quote-unquote understanding of the immune system

35:18.240 --> 35:20.720
and I think we need to dismiss it wholeheartedly.

35:20.720 --> 35:25.720
So the other way to get fancy with it would be

35:26.520 --> 35:30.280
to talk to people about immune linked recognition.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.160
So link recognition is how B cells and T cells

35:33.160 --> 35:35.440
coordinate their recognition of antigens

35:35.440 --> 35:38.760
and how sometimes the recognition of one antigen

35:38.760 --> 35:42.440
by a T cell can be linked to the recognition

35:42.440 --> 35:44.080
of another antigen by B cells,

35:44.080 --> 35:46.600
but it's a different antigen

35:46.600 --> 35:50.000
that the B cells recognizing that the T cells present.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.760
And that has to do with how B cells process antigens

35:53.760 --> 35:55.920
and then present them for T cell help.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.360
And that's a great place to teach the difference

35:58.360 --> 36:02.320
between an infection and a transfection

36:02.320 --> 36:04.920
where there are so many signals and so many differences

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
between the way that the body is presenting

36:06.920 --> 36:09.760
and finding the proteins versus in an infection,

36:09.760 --> 36:12.120
but that's of course too much for this.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.880
But it's the best place in immunology to start.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.320
So the second thing I would start with,

36:18.320 --> 36:20.600
I think I'm going next to transfection

36:20.600 --> 36:24.880
in healthy humans is criminally negligent.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.000
And let me just move my mouse over here

36:27.000 --> 36:28.320
because I can't quite see that.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.440
So what we have, first of all,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.000
I think that this list is most important to understand

36:35.000 --> 36:39.680
and this list was basically done in March of 2020.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.440
If you wanna ask in the question and answer

36:41.440 --> 36:43.200
about how I know about transfection

36:43.200 --> 36:44.560
or what my impression of it is,

36:44.560 --> 36:47.880
I used it for almost 10 years in my mice

36:47.880 --> 36:49.360
and so I can tell you a lot about it,

36:49.360 --> 36:51.880
especially with regard to using a dendovirus

36:51.880 --> 36:54.320
to transform actually.

36:54.320 --> 36:57.200
So transfection in its purest form

36:57.200 --> 36:59.800
would be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.760
That's the first most important thing to say.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.720
You don't want anybody to have any openings for it to say

37:04.720 --> 37:08.560
that it was rushed or that they weren't doing quality control

37:08.560 --> 37:13.240
because if they made the best small batch brew beer

37:13.240 --> 37:15.360
of transfection, it would not be appropriate

37:15.360 --> 37:16.960
for your children, it wouldn't be appropriate

37:17.000 --> 37:19.240
for your healthy grandmother.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.520
It's just not appropriate for healthy humans.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.600
The upscaling from nanograms to kilograms

37:25.600 --> 37:28.800
compounds this problem and you can hear people

37:28.800 --> 37:33.160
on all sides of the debate joking about this in 2020.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.280
It's almost comical if you go back.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.160
You can find people as diverse as Vincent Rancin Yellow

37:39.160 --> 37:44.160
and Rach and Yellow, excuse me, and well, anyway,

37:45.160 --> 37:46.480
it doesn't matter.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.960
You can find lots and lots of people talking about how

37:49.960 --> 37:53.600
it's amazing how we're going from nanograms to kilograms.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.680
Never either they are not processing what they're saying

37:56.680 --> 38:00.240
and the absurdity of it or they're saying it that way

38:00.240 --> 38:03.720
in order to actively allow you to dismiss the comedy of that.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.120
It's very much equivalent to your grandmother

38:07.120 --> 38:09.640
making the best pie for the state fair

38:09.640 --> 38:10.760
and then saying, okay, grandma,

38:10.760 --> 38:12.920
now I want to make 10,000 of those.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.880
And her just saying, okay, well, we'll make them by tomorrow.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.920
And thinking about how to make those,

38:18.920 --> 38:21.360
the big batch of everything, it's just that, no,

38:21.360 --> 38:23.640
it's not possible, not in the speed.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.040
And that's what Mike Eden has been arguing for a very long time,

38:26.040 --> 38:29.160
not only about this product, but all the other ones.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.080
The RNA was impure, we've known that since the smear

38:32.080 --> 38:36.520
was released from the European agency

38:36.520 --> 38:38.920
where instead of getting a band of RNA they got a smear.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.000
So that already told you that we were going to get

38:41.000 --> 38:43.680
a whole bunch of small protein fragments.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.720
The RNA codon was optimized.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.080
This meant that it's going to go through the ribosomes

38:48.080 --> 38:49.520
at different speeds.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.520
It's going to means that it's going to fold differently,

38:51.520 --> 38:53.640
which means it'll produce different epitopes

38:53.640 --> 38:56.720
because epitopes aren't just the sequence of the amino acids,

38:56.720 --> 38:58.640
but they're three dimensional structure.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.560
It was also chemically altered.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.400
So this caused wobble bases

39:03.400 --> 39:05.020
and it also caused premature stops.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.040
And now we just saw a paper from UCL come out

39:08.040 --> 39:09.960
that shows that it's also causing frame shifts.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.000
So this is even worse.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.400
So talk about RNA is impure.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.880
The protein that's produced is definitely also very impure.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.280
The protein produced is also uncharacterized.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.440
That's how we're here now.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.600
After three years, we're just finding out

39:24.600 --> 39:27.800
all the implications of just some of these things.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.520
The LNP was never tested in humans.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.800
We know that from a wide variety of things.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.880
We also know that they've known for a very long time

39:34.880 --> 39:36.840
that they can't control where it goes.

39:36.840 --> 39:41.200
There is a lecture from 2022 of how Peter Cullis,

39:41.200 --> 39:42.800
the guy who invented the LNP,

39:42.800 --> 39:45.200
admitting it freely during the question and answer session

39:45.200 --> 39:47.920
that he wasted the lives of five postdocs,

39:47.920 --> 39:50.840
trying to find a way to target LNPs to particular tissues

39:50.840 --> 39:51.880
and it just ain't possible.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.360
It might take 40 more years.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.240
So more recently, we found out that the process too

39:57.240 --> 40:00.640
is indeed contaminated with endotoxins from the bacteria

40:00.640 --> 40:02.360
that's used from the recombinant process.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.640
It's also contaminated with double-stranded DNA fragments,

40:05.640 --> 40:08.760
but I would argue that these are probably less of a danger

40:08.760 --> 40:10.760
than all of that other stuff up there,

40:10.760 --> 40:13.320
including number one, which is that even if it works great,

40:13.320 --> 40:15.000
it was still a really bad idea.

40:16.120 --> 40:19.120
Is the spike protein toxic in transfected cells,

40:19.120 --> 40:20.720
does it have added biology?

40:20.720 --> 40:23.120
That's all on top of this stuff one through nine.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.400
And so what I'm arguing is that there's lots of academic

40:28.400 --> 40:30.040
biologists that should have done known better.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.040
There's lots of doctors that heard it

40:32.040 --> 40:33.400
and should have known better.

40:33.440 --> 40:38.600
And everybody behind the scenes of this thing in 2020

40:38.600 --> 40:40.520
definitely knew better.

40:40.520 --> 40:44.040
So the final thing is viruses are not patterned integrities.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.400
I'm stealing the term pattern integrity

40:46.400 --> 40:47.680
and applying it to biology.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.120
It's really a bigger term than that

40:50.120 --> 40:53.360
and I'm stealing it from Buckminster Fuller,

40:53.360 --> 40:58.080
who originally explained it as taking three pieces

40:58.080 --> 41:00.920
of different kind of rope, like a Manila rope,

41:00.920 --> 41:05.000
a nylon rope and a hemp rope and splicing them together

41:05.000 --> 41:08.200
so you have one continuous rope and then tying a very simple

41:08.200 --> 41:11.840
knot in the nylon rope and then sliding that knot down

41:11.840 --> 41:13.800
through the different kinds of rope.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.480
And the knot is the pattern integrity.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.280
It's not nylon, it's not cotton and it's not hemp,

41:20.280 --> 41:23.280
but it is the pattern that is integral

41:23.280 --> 41:25.840
as it moves down the rope.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.160
What I would like to argue is that life on earth

41:28.160 --> 41:30.760
is a complex pattern integrity that we don't fully

41:30.760 --> 41:33.200
understand how it sustains itself,

41:33.200 --> 41:36.400
but it requires energy, it exhibits homeostasis

41:37.400 --> 41:42.160
and all of the species that we call species on earth

41:42.160 --> 41:45.680
could be considered this kind of complex pattern integrity

41:45.680 --> 41:47.200
and a virus is not that.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.320
A virus as best as their cartoon describes it

41:51.320 --> 41:55.560
is a molecule wrapped around small proteins

41:55.560 --> 41:57.880
coated in lipoprotein.

41:57.880 --> 42:02.720
So there's no aspect of a pattern integrity there.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.400
At best, you could call that a packet of genetic information

42:05.400 --> 42:08.040
or genetic noise, but you can't call that a pattern integrity

42:08.040 --> 42:13.080
like you can a mosquito or a squirrel or your son.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.160
And so if viruses aren't patterned integrity,

42:18.160 --> 42:20.320
how have they lied to us about these things?

42:20.320 --> 42:23.560
And I think after reading, I mean, countless papers

42:23.560 --> 42:25.440
over the last three years trying to figure out

42:25.440 --> 42:28.960
what is and isn't real and really challenging

42:28.960 --> 42:33.960
these no-virus people to stop stopping at purification

42:34.960 --> 42:39.960
and isolation, but to think more about the whole thing.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.160
This is the cartoon that broke down.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.400
So what they tell you is that the virus infects you

42:45.400 --> 42:47.120
and then it makes lots of copies of itself,

42:47.120 --> 42:50.000
but for some reason, they're really hard to culture.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.440
You gotta have exactly the right cell culture type

42:53.440 --> 42:56.600
and even when you do have the right cell culture type,

42:56.600 --> 42:58.920
it only grows in like two of the 96 wells

42:58.920 --> 43:00.720
and then you can barely get anything.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.600
You just get a sequence and that sequence

43:02.600 --> 43:05.640
is sometimes incomplete, but we fill in the holes anyway.

43:05.640 --> 43:10.640
And that's basically coronavirus biology up until 2020.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.480
That's how they did it.

43:12.480 --> 43:16.560
They look for a small, very conserved sequence

43:16.560 --> 43:18.400
of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.360
If they find it in one of these wells,

43:20.360 --> 43:21.920
they say they found a virus

43:21.920 --> 43:24.640
and then they sequence everything in that well

43:24.640 --> 43:28.080
and assemble a coronavirus genome if they can.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.240
And that's the extent of the fidelity up until 2020.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.520
Now what's wrong with this is that they're not

43:34.520 --> 43:37.360
adequately acknowledging the virology

43:37.360 --> 43:40.040
that's been around for since the 80s.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.160
So I was gonna slide back there and grab a book,

43:42.160 --> 43:43.240
but that's not really important.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.480
There are old bound books where people were working

43:47.480 --> 43:50.000
on these RNA signals back in the 80s

43:50.480 --> 43:52.160
and talking about coronaviruses.

43:52.160 --> 43:55.600
And you can see that they already knew back then

43:55.600 --> 43:58.680
that most of the particles didn't really have a full set

43:58.680 --> 44:01.040
of the RNA, whatever they're looking for,

44:01.040 --> 44:02.360
but it was weird.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.360
They could never find a full signal.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.720
And when they could find a full signal,

44:05.720 --> 44:07.280
it was very, very faint.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.720
It was like almost none of the signal was the genome

44:10.720 --> 44:13.160
that they thought was responsible for this.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.800
And it seemed like in the 80s,

44:14.800 --> 44:17.400
they actually understood that as part of the reason

44:17.400 --> 44:18.760
why they're so hard to culture

44:18.760 --> 44:21.400
because they don't replicate themselves very well,

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
whatever they are.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.640
And so what I would like to suggest to you,

44:26.640 --> 44:28.280
and I don't want to waste too much time here

44:28.280 --> 44:30.760
because we're already quite a long ways in, I think,

44:30.760 --> 44:35.360
but is that how virology has overcome this,

44:35.360 --> 44:37.400
is they've taken these RNA signals

44:37.400 --> 44:39.240
that they can see in the wild

44:39.240 --> 44:40.920
and they've converted them to DNA.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.240
And when you do that, what that allows you to do

44:44.240 --> 44:47.760
is the same process too that they used

44:47.760 --> 44:50.920
to make the RNA that everybody's all up in arms about.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.720
And I've been trying to teach everybody

44:52.720 --> 44:53.920
for the last couple of years

44:53.920 --> 44:57.240
that that's how they overcome this low fidelity replication

44:57.240 --> 44:59.440
of coronavirus signals that they see in the wild

44:59.440 --> 45:01.000
that they can never grow,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.920
that don't skip animals very easily.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.360
They have to start out with a larger quantity

45:05.360 --> 45:06.840
that they can get in nature.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.920
And the way that they get that larger quantity

45:09.920 --> 45:11.640
is they take that RNA sequence

45:11.640 --> 45:14.840
and they make it into a synthetic DNA molecule.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.880
Break it up into five little plasmids

45:17.880 --> 45:21.680
and grow those plasmids in a large vat of bacteria,

45:21.680 --> 45:23.840
just like they do any other DNA

45:23.840 --> 45:25.720
that they need a large quantity of.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.560
And just like process two, they lice those bacteria,

45:29.560 --> 45:32.360
they take that CDNA out, they ligate them together

45:32.360 --> 45:34.760
and they put them on a cell culture,

45:34.760 --> 45:37.000
which will turn it into RNA.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.400
They can also mix it with a industrial

45:40.400 --> 45:44.400
or commercial version of an RNA,

45:44.400 --> 45:49.400
RNA polymerase and just translate the DNA to RNA that way,

45:50.160 --> 45:51.480
depending on how you want to do it,

45:51.480 --> 45:52.880
depending on what process you use.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.800
I don't know for sure exactly the details

45:54.800 --> 45:56.080
of how they did it with the mRNA,

45:56.080 --> 45:58.880
but I think they used an RNA to do it,

45:58.880 --> 46:02.680
RNA polymerase to do it, not a cell culture.

46:02.680 --> 46:03.600
I'm sure they did that.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.360
But anyway, so then what you can do with that RNA

46:06.360 --> 46:08.000
is you can put it on a cell culture

46:08.000 --> 46:11.440
and it will cause that cell culture to blab

46:11.440 --> 46:13.400
and to show psychopathic effects.

46:13.480 --> 46:14.880
You can put it in animals

46:14.880 --> 46:17.240
and those animals will show immune responses to it.

46:17.240 --> 46:21.000
You can send it to other people and they'll see the same thing.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.520
You can sequence it and you'll get sequences.

46:23.520 --> 46:26.560
The most important thing is this DNA can be gone back to,

46:26.560 --> 46:28.400
put it back in the bacteria, make more

46:28.400 --> 46:32.840
and you have, for example, what SARS or Bany is.

46:32.840 --> 46:37.200
Every SARS paper that was done after say 2005

46:37.200 --> 46:40.880
basically uses a strain called SARS or Bany,

46:40.880 --> 46:44.760
which is RNA, infectious RNA,

46:44.760 --> 46:48.360
derived from a cDNA clone made from a patient

46:48.360 --> 46:49.840
with the last name or Bany.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.200
And Ralph Barrick just distributes that clone

46:53.200 --> 46:55.640
whenever anybody needs it for their paper.

46:55.640 --> 46:58.240
And the way that clone is made is from a DNA copy

46:58.240 --> 47:00.960
of the RNA sequence they can make as much of that DNA

47:00.960 --> 47:01.800
as they want.

47:01.800 --> 47:06.400
That means they can make a very pure quantity

47:06.400 --> 47:09.280
of the RNA, which they can't get from the wild,

47:09.280 --> 47:12.320
no matter what they do, they can't get it from the wild.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.880
This is the only way they can't.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.040
This is the only dangerous form of RNA

47:16.040 --> 47:18.960
because it's the only form that can be produced and mass

47:18.960 --> 47:21.800
and incidentally, it's probably the only way

47:21.800 --> 47:24.040
you can get the same sequence in multiple places

47:24.040 --> 47:24.880
around the world.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.680
And so I want to make a scientific argument here

47:29.680 --> 47:31.280
and stop with the cartoons.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.280
Is there any way to see evidence of this?

47:36.400 --> 47:38.880
So I'm gonna start with direct nanopore sequencing

47:38.880 --> 47:42.680
from a paper that is from right before the pandemic in 2019

47:42.680 --> 47:47.240
where they use nanopore sequencing to sequence a coronavirus.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.440
Nanopore sequencing in case you're unaware

47:49.440 --> 47:53.280
is using a ion channel and then the DNA goes

47:53.280 --> 47:56.400
through the ion channel and they could read the electric signal

47:56.400 --> 47:59.920
of the ion channel and then they can use modeling and math

47:59.920 --> 48:02.640
to decide what the sequence is of the molecule

48:02.640 --> 48:05.560
that went through and the beauty of sequencing this way

48:05.560 --> 48:08.120
is that you're not as nearly as limited

48:08.120 --> 48:11.240
in the size of molecule you can sequence at once

48:11.240 --> 48:13.040
and you're also not limited to DNA

48:13.040 --> 48:15.800
but you can actually also sequence RNA with these techniques.

48:15.800 --> 48:19.360
So for the first time in coronavirus history,

48:19.360 --> 48:23.960
it was possible to bypass these limitations

48:23.960 --> 48:27.760
of PCR-based sequencing where you have to amplify

48:27.760 --> 48:30.720
all these amplicons in case you're not aware

48:30.720 --> 48:34.680
when they sequence SARS-CoV-2, they need to use between 105

48:34.680 --> 48:39.360
and I think the smallest number is 99 primer sets

48:39.360 --> 48:42.440
in order to sequence the whole genome

48:42.440 --> 48:45.640
because again PCR you can't just do as big a sequence

48:45.640 --> 48:47.680
as you want because it's limited in size.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.600
Maybe the amplicon is something like 300 to 500 amino acids

48:51.600 --> 48:52.680
or base pairs.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.720
So nanopore sequencing was a great,

48:55.720 --> 48:57.960
it should have been a great leap forward

48:57.960 --> 49:01.040
because now we can take one of these coronaviruses

49:01.040 --> 49:05.040
in a clone form and we can put it in a cell culture

49:05.040 --> 49:09.040
and really check, okay, what happens when a virus replicates

49:09.040 --> 49:12.480
in a cell culture, what do we see?

49:12.480 --> 49:13.760
And since it's direct nanopore,

49:13.760 --> 49:15.600
we can just dump all the RNA through

49:15.600 --> 49:18.560
and we'll get a pseudo-quantification

49:18.560 --> 49:22.520
of what's going on during a virus replication process.

49:22.520 --> 49:25.560
So what we're supposed to believe is that the RNA,

49:25.560 --> 49:29.840
which is that little red bead of material there

49:29.840 --> 49:33.840
around the end protein is supposed to be perfectly packaged

49:33.840 --> 49:38.080
inside of the endosome and you get a replication-competent virus

49:38.080 --> 49:40.000
that you cough out on your friends

49:40.000 --> 49:41.400
and that's the whole cartoon.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.960
They make beautiful computer animations of it

49:44.960 --> 49:46.960
but that doesn't make it true.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.280
And so if we look at this nanopore sequencing,

49:49.280 --> 49:51.800
what they do is they do, I'm just gonna point out here,

49:51.800 --> 49:53.640
I don't know if I circled it in the thing

49:53.640 --> 49:55.280
so I'm just gonna underline it.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.480
They're using two clones here,

49:57.480 --> 50:02.840
full-length CDNA copies of genomes from 229E

50:03.920 --> 50:07.080
and they're growing it in vaccinia

50:07.080 --> 50:10.880
and so they use a vaccinia virus to transform an MRC-5 cell

50:10.880 --> 50:14.560
and then that repackages this recombinant human coronavirus.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.600
It's not important that you understand this

50:16.600 --> 50:18.440
because actually I probably couldn't explain it to you

50:18.440 --> 50:21.720
in super detail either, but they're basically hijacking

50:21.720 --> 50:25.240
some known properties of that vaccinia virus's genome

50:25.240 --> 50:27.320
in order to produce this RNA.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.160
But then they put this on that cell culture

50:30.160 --> 50:32.280
and here we go, this is what they find.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.640
They find subgenomic RNAs get translated

50:35.640 --> 50:39.040
so very rarely does the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

50:39.040 --> 50:42.400
go from beginning to end and get you a full genome.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.920
You can then package it into the cartoon

50:44.920 --> 50:48.280
and then send it out to the next infector.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.640
Instead, you get really, really huge numbers

50:51.640 --> 50:56.280
of incomplete genomes and in fact, you only get,

50:56.280 --> 50:58.040
I don't know if I wanna show this, I'm sorry,

50:58.040 --> 50:59.320
that's not what I wanted to show.

50:59.320 --> 51:02.800
Here's the coverage and so if you look on the side here,

51:02.800 --> 51:06.760
this is 10 to the zero and then up here is 10 to the fourth

51:06.760 --> 51:11.440
and so for RNA transcripts of N and for S,

51:11.440 --> 51:14.560
you get hundreds, if not, you get tens of thousands,

51:14.560 --> 51:17.360
if not hundreds of thousands of copies of them.

51:17.360 --> 51:20.520
But for whole genomes, there's actually less than 100

51:20.520 --> 51:24.080
that they actually find and in this, less than 100,

51:24.080 --> 51:26.640
it's less than five, it's only two

51:26.640 --> 51:29.400
that they find, I was already a paper ahead of myself.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.400
In this paper, they only found two genomes

51:32.400 --> 51:34.240
which would qualify as full length

51:34.240 --> 51:36.240
and neither of them are actually full length

51:36.240 --> 51:38.800
but that doesn't matter and again, remember,

51:38.800 --> 51:42.760
we also did this, oh shoot, so I explained that

51:42.760 --> 51:44.400
a little bit wrong, I was going too fast.

51:44.400 --> 51:47.960
This paper that's here is done

51:47.960 --> 51:50.320
in a more traditional clone method

51:50.320 --> 51:53.960
and why I popped this paper up was to show you

51:53.960 --> 51:58.000
that this is clone methodology from many more years ago,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.160
this is 2001, where they use a vaccinia virus

52:01.160 --> 52:05.520
to do the same thing and what I wanted to get to with that

52:05.520 --> 52:07.120
is what they found in this paper

52:07.120 --> 52:09.920
which is here's where the full genomes are supposed to be

52:09.920 --> 52:12.800
and they're almost a shadow, they're not even there

52:12.800 --> 52:16.920
and so in this paper, they also see sub-genomic RNAs

52:16.920 --> 52:21.160
in huge quantities but full genomes are almost invisible,

52:21.160 --> 52:26.160
undetectable and 20 years later in this infectious clone,

52:26.360 --> 52:28.560
oh I'm gonna go back, in this infectious clone paper,

52:28.560 --> 52:32.360
they find the same thing, they only find two full genomes

52:32.360 --> 52:34.600
and then hundreds and hundreds of thousands

52:34.600 --> 52:39.240
of sub-genomic RNAs, so you would think that's kind of cool,

52:39.240 --> 52:42.040
they'd actually made an infectious clone of CDNA,

52:42.040 --> 52:45.520
a CDNA infectious clone of SARS-CoV-2,

52:45.520 --> 52:48.760
they put it in genomic sequencing,

52:48.800 --> 52:51.240
nanopore direct RNA sequencing

52:51.240 --> 52:53.400
and they found exactly the same thing,

52:54.360 --> 52:59.080
remember they put the clone in the cell culture,

52:59.080 --> 53:01.760
so there were already hundreds of full copies

53:01.760 --> 53:05.240
of the RNA in there, of the DNA rather,

53:05.240 --> 53:07.760
already in there, hundreds of copies,

53:07.760 --> 53:12.120
so they only found 111 full reads of the RNA,

53:13.040 --> 53:16.800
even though they threw in a DNA infectious clone

53:16.800 --> 53:19.240
into the cell culture, that's all that it produced,

53:19.240 --> 53:22.960
but hundreds of thousands, look at the coverage here,

53:22.960 --> 53:26.400
if you can see my arrow, 400,000 is that line right there

53:26.400 --> 53:28.360
and it's much above it, it's almost at,

53:28.360 --> 53:33.000
I think that would be 600,000 of the end protein,

53:34.280 --> 53:37.160
so the way that these things behave,

53:37.160 --> 53:39.640
relative to the cartoon that we've been told

53:39.640 --> 53:43.000
is completely different and yet somehow or another,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.520
this observation was made already back in the 80s

53:45.520 --> 53:48.480
and it keeps being made over and over and over again

53:48.480 --> 53:50.120
and we ignore it for what it is,

53:50.120 --> 53:53.160
which is the revealing that the infectious cycle

53:53.160 --> 53:56.320
is not what virology textbooks have told us,

53:56.320 --> 54:00.160
it's a very low fidelity replication process

54:00.160 --> 54:03.760
and that means that they're really not patterned integrities

54:03.760 --> 54:07.440
and so the way that we're talking about them is pathogens

54:07.440 --> 54:09.680
and all this other, it's just ridiculous,

54:09.680 --> 54:13.640
they don't have the level of biological sophistication

54:13.640 --> 54:16.800
to justify the use of all of these biological terms

54:16.800 --> 54:20.700
that we otherwise only apply to real pattern integrities.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.000
So again, this was just my summary of what I think

54:25.000 --> 54:27.760
the way out is, I don't really know,

54:29.800 --> 54:31.160
I don't really have all the answers

54:31.160 --> 54:32.880
and I didn't really know what to say to you guys

54:32.880 --> 54:35.400
because I know that you've had so many other people tell you

54:35.400 --> 54:37.440
all kinds of amazing things and point out

54:37.440 --> 54:40.920
all kinds of amazing dots on the map.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.320
The last dot I'd like to point out is that

54:43.320 --> 54:45.920
even if they're not trying to kill us,

54:45.920 --> 54:48.120
they are trying to limit the amount of people

54:48.120 --> 54:52.000
that are being born and I think we have to acknowledge

54:52.000 --> 54:55.960
that they also have this idea that somewhere down the line

54:55.960 --> 54:58.320
an AI that had enough computing power

54:58.320 --> 55:02.320
and had enough data would be able to solve any puzzle

55:02.320 --> 55:03.720
and they've been trying to tell us that

55:03.720 --> 55:06.440
by first beating chess and then beating Go

55:06.440 --> 55:08.320
and then they've recently told us

55:08.400 --> 55:11.240
they've solved the problem of protein folding

55:11.240 --> 55:15.480
but in reality, what they know for sure

55:15.480 --> 55:18.800
is that if their plans go through the genetic diversity

55:18.800 --> 55:20.960
that's on Earth, this genetic diversity

55:20.960 --> 55:23.360
is the last time it's gonna exist.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.000
There's never gonna be 10 billion people on the planet

55:26.000 --> 55:28.880
fighting to have babies ever again

55:28.880 --> 55:32.440
if their plans go through so they need to collect this data.

55:32.440 --> 55:35.320
It is a multi-generational fight not for us,

55:35.320 --> 55:37.560
they don't need our data, they need babies.

55:37.560 --> 55:40.480
From birth to death, people like Craig Ventner

55:40.480 --> 55:42.920
have said that before, people like Joshua Lederberg

55:42.920 --> 55:45.040
have said that before, old school leaders

55:45.040 --> 55:48.160
in this trans-human genetic movement

55:48.160 --> 55:50.960
have been saying this for years that we need that data

55:50.960 --> 55:53.440
and the way they're gonna do it is my kids,

55:53.440 --> 55:55.680
if they get given this mythology,

55:55.680 --> 55:58.200
then it will be logical for them to give their children's

55:58.200 --> 56:02.040
data to the state, to contribute to their social

56:02.040 --> 56:04.320
obligations to their society.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.520
All based on a mythology that there might be

56:06.520 --> 56:09.280
to gain a function virus made by a bachelor student

56:09.280 --> 56:10.280
in their garage.

56:12.600 --> 56:15.360
And so we've got to teach our children that this is a lie,

56:15.360 --> 56:18.120
that this idea that we are tracking something

56:18.120 --> 56:20.200
with such high fidelity around the world

56:20.200 --> 56:21.720
and it's still spreading.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.840
We've got to break that myth because that is not possible.

56:24.840 --> 56:28.120
You cannot have a thousand RNA molecules

56:28.120 --> 56:29.640
that are pretty similar to one another

56:29.640 --> 56:33.920
and then three years later have an uncountable number

56:33.920 --> 56:35.500
that are descended from that puddle.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.420
It's not possible because they're not patterned integrities.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.500
And I can go into that in more detail.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.260
I can, but it's just what to talk about

56:43.260 --> 56:46.620
and how to talk about it was a 30,000 foot level thing,

56:46.620 --> 56:49.060
trying to get more people to listen and talk about this stuff.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.740
So stop all transfections in humans

56:50.740 --> 56:51.860
and that's the end of the talk.

56:51.860 --> 56:53.260
I'm happy to answer questions.

56:55.700 --> 56:57.260
Wow, sorry.

56:57.260 --> 57:00.100
I don't know if that was a felt right or not.

57:01.100 --> 57:03.100
Well, thank you very much, Jay.

57:03.100 --> 57:09.100
Let me just okay, Dene, go ahead, please.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.100
Hi, Jay. Thank you very much.

57:15.100 --> 57:18.100
I found that very stimulating and very interesting

57:18.100 --> 57:19.100
and I really loved it.

57:19.100 --> 57:22.100
I loved how you, the package that you presented.

57:22.100 --> 57:27.100
I think I understood, you know, critical parts of it and everything.

57:27.100 --> 57:29.100
Okay, I have a couple of questions.

57:29.100 --> 57:34.100
Just your last point, you said that they want this data.

57:34.100 --> 57:37.100
What data exactly do they want

57:37.100 --> 57:40.100
and why do they think it would be useful to them?

57:40.100 --> 57:44.100
Well, they have said for a very long time

57:44.100 --> 57:46.100
that they would like to crack the human genome, right?

57:46.100 --> 57:48.100
And if you just take the analogy

57:48.100 --> 57:51.100
of how they are cracked to the game goal,

57:51.100 --> 57:54.100
it was putting the computer against itself

57:54.100 --> 57:56.100
and playing millions and millions of games.

57:57.100 --> 57:58.100
Recording stopped.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.100
The equivalent of that in biology

58:00.100 --> 58:02.100
is millions and millions of examples

58:02.100 --> 58:04.100
of the expression of the human genome

58:04.100 --> 58:06.100
and unique examples of it.

58:06.100 --> 58:09.100
So in theory, if you could have all of this data

58:09.100 --> 58:11.100
and have it in high fidelity,

58:11.100 --> 58:13.100
that's exactly what an AI would need to go,

58:13.100 --> 58:15.100
see how does this genome work?

58:15.100 --> 58:17.100
And if you could have that whole time series

58:17.100 --> 58:21.100
for every baby on Earth with biosensing devices

58:21.100 --> 58:23.100
that aren't invented yet

58:23.100 --> 58:26.100
and all of these other projections that they make,

58:26.100 --> 58:28.100
then eventually at some point the nexus

58:28.100 --> 58:31.100
of all these technologies is going to come together

58:31.100 --> 58:33.100
and we're going to be able to have the computing power

58:33.100 --> 58:35.100
and the storage power and the sampling power

58:35.100 --> 58:38.100
and whatever to crack the human genome.

58:38.100 --> 58:41.100
That's the whole prediction that they're making.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.100
And I think it's a silly one,

58:43.100 --> 58:45.100
but that's the one that they brainwash each other with

58:45.100 --> 58:47.100
in the secret meetings

58:47.100 --> 58:49.100
and convince these venture capitalists

58:49.100 --> 58:51.100
and everything to believe in this potential.

58:52.100 --> 58:55.100
Okay, so I mean the answer that I get from your answer is

58:55.100 --> 58:59.100
it's a silly idea and it's hard to see how

58:59.100 --> 59:01.100
it would be truly useful to them.

59:01.100 --> 59:04.100
And that's what I would retain from your answer.

59:04.100 --> 59:07.100
But my second question is,

59:10.100 --> 59:13.100
you said transfection was dumb,

59:13.100 --> 59:16.100
but my question is, is it dangerous?

59:16.100 --> 59:20.100
Because, you know, that's more important, I think.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.100
Is it dangerous?

59:21.100 --> 59:24.100
It doesn't the body have enough,

59:26.100 --> 59:28.100
you know, safety mechanisms within it

59:28.100 --> 59:31.100
that even if you succeed by chemistry

59:31.100 --> 59:34.100
or whatever this transfection on many cells,

59:34.100 --> 59:35.100
who cares?

59:35.100 --> 59:37.100
Most of the time it won't matter.

59:37.100 --> 59:39.100
Is it dangerous?

59:39.100 --> 59:43.100
I would say that, unfortunately,

59:43.100 --> 59:47.100
it terrifies me to say that I think it is very dangerous

59:48.100 --> 59:51.100
and what someone said at the beginning

59:51.100 --> 59:53.100
of the call before the recording was on

59:53.100 --> 59:55.100
and before everybody was here

59:55.100 --> 59:57.100
is that we have no real time horizon

59:57.100 --> 59:59.100
as to when it's going to happen.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.100
And I'm going to try and say this without crying,

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.100
but my best friend had aneurysm

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.100
on Saturday of this past weekend

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.100
and he's 49 years old.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.100
He took two shots,

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.100
stopped talking to me for three years

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.100
because I'm a know-it-all, just like my parents did.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.100
And there's no way that I can go to his funeral

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.100
because everybody there believes

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.100
that the shot has nothing to do with it.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.100
And this is the kind of thing

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.100
that we're going to be dealing with

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.100
over the next five or four

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.100
or however many years it's going to be, I don't know,

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.100
but everybody is potentially looking at the problem

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.100
with it is very simple.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.100
If the auto-immunity that's almost inevitable

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.100
when you transfect an organism,

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.100
if the auto-immunity that's forming

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.100
is something that takes a while to build,

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.100
it could be a decade before

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.100
the auto-immunity reaches a stage of symptomology

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.100
and never mind lethality.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.100
And so the idea that this is just going to be

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.100
some kind of spike in reactions is very naive

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.100
because some of the mice that I transfected

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.100
could live for a whole year

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.100
because of where we put it and what we used.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.100
And other mice would die in eight weeks

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.100
because of where we put it and what we used.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.100
And so the idea that the random nature

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.100
of this transfection makes it very much a crapshoot.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.100
I think it's very possible that lots of people

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.100
will get away with it and never find out

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.100
what happened and maybe, you know,

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.100
never have what they would consider

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.100
a clinically significant disadvantage

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.100
as a result of the transfection,

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.100
but keep messing around

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.100
and they will definitely find out.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.100
I can't dodge that bullet forever.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.100
But again, I would also say that after three years

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.100
we all know that there's a lot of different ways

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.100
that this could have been distorted.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.100
The biggest one being placebo doses,

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.100
either intentional or accidental

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.100
because of not storing or producing them correctly

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.100
and countless other reasons

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.100
why there's not going to be a uniform signal

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.100
across all the people that receive these.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.100
But if it worked and that's what I was trying to make

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.100
with that slide, if it worked,

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.100
transfection is terrible.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.100
Thank you.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.100
Okay, thank you, Lars.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.100
Yes, thank you.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.100
I love your way of explaining very difficult things.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:30.100
When we tried to explain to our friends and families

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.100
what's been going on,

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.100
have you seen any good descriptions

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.100
that we can use for regular folks

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:44.100
or why the PCR test is so ridiculous

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.100
and how that should make everybody understand

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.100
that this is fake or some other wedge

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.100
that we can throw into the discussion

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.100
that makes people actually understand?

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.100
I think I can.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.100
So, you can basically go through it.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.100
I could have just done that talk.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.100
There's all kinds of things.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:11.100
But the big picture is that before the pandemic,

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.100
the way that coronavirus biologists went about their work

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:19.100
was looking for signals which were shared across coronaviruses.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.100
And since coronaviruses are believed

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.100
to be these self-replicating RNA molecules,

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.100
the most important molecule or protein, rather,

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.100
in that genome is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.100
which copies the virus genome in your cells.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.100
That protein is really conserved across many coronaviruses.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.100
And, in fact, there's a 2013 paper

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100
that's probably the best example.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.100
It's a Shengli sheet paper

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.100
where they go sampling for coronaviruses

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.100
and basically they look for the same fragment

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.100
in every sample that they look in.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.100
And whenever they find it,

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.100
if there's a slight difference in that signal,

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.100
then they classify it as a different virus.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.100
If they find a different protein that looks different

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.100
than another one, then they classify it.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.100
And so, from these very, very small signals

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.100
that are supposed to represent larger signals,

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.100
so remember, in these papers off the top of my head,

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.100
they were looking for a 350 base pair segment

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.100
of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene,

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.100
which is part of a 30,000 base pair genome.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.100
So, by finding that one fragment with PCR,

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.100
they said they found the whole thing,

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.100
and then they started classifying the noise

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.100
that they found in those samples

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.100
as distinct coronaviruses from different bats

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.100
or different animals.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.100
And so, the fidelity that they used

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:45.100
to create the illusion of this diversity

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.100
of pandemic potential in the past

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.100
is completely, it's not even close to related

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.100
to how they're now portraying it,

01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.100
which is that this PCR is specific for just one,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.100
and that the sequences are specific for just one

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.100
and its ancestors.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.100
This has never been able to be done.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.100
The most robust signal of a coronavirus

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.100
that I've been able to find in the literature

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.100
was one that was recorded by Mark von Rundst in Belgium

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
in 2008 in a paper where he found the NL67,

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.100
I think it is, but it could be wrong, it might be 47,

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.100
and the NL67 coronavirus,

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.100
and they found coronavirus genes,

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.100
the specific gene fragments that were indicative

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.100
of this coronavirus in 27 kids,

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.100
and then they lost it.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:46.100
And so, the most fidelity we've ever had

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:50.100
is from SARS-1, and that was supposedly 10,000 people

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.100
and 800 people dead,

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.100
but we don't have sequences from every one of those patients,

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.100
and every time we have a sequence,

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.100
the difference is extraordinary.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:04.100
So, again,

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.100
with regard to the PCR test,

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.100
I guess the analogy would be something like

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.100
what I tried to say earlier, which is

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:17.100
you've got to kind of imagine a world like America

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:21.100
where everybody is unaware that they have automobiles,

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.100
and then you tell people that there is a

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.100
there is a novel vehicle spreading around,

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.100
and you're not even going to know whether you have it or not

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100
without this test,

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.100
and the test is that you've got,

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.100
you're going to look for rubber tires,

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.100
and you're going to look for a

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.100
internal combustion engine in your garage,

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.100
and if you find those two things,

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.100
then you're infected.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.100
And so, as this test spreads around the United States,

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.100
we find out that, wow, lots of people are infected with this thing.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:56.100
And if we had told you that it's an epidemic of Toyotas,

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:01.100
but then told you that even when you don't see,

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.100
it starts to get confusing because the background signal is varied,

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.100
the background signal is very heterogeneous,

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.100
and the background signal is already there.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:15.100
And then on top of this, you're going to falsely imply a very specific test

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.100
that's actually not specific, but every time it shows up, you say it is.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.100
And so, by the time we're done with this,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.100
I've convinced you that everybody owns a Toyota,

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.100
when in reality,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.100
very of a small fraction of people in Pittsburgh own a Toyota,

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.100
but because my test was implied to be specific on a background

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.100
that was confounding,

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.100
then you have a pandemic and you have evidence of spread.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
Thank you.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.100
Okay, thank you.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.100
Who was next?

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.100
A little bit confused.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.100
I just updated my Zoom,

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.100
and everybody gets reordered here.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.100
Sorry?

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100
I think Matt's next.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100
At least that's what I see on my screen.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100
I don't know.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.100
Okay, Matt's go ahead, please.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100
All right.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.100
Thanks for the great talk.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.100
I wanted to ask you about these patterning categories,

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:13.100
and your argument with the paper about replication

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.100
of certain parts of the genome,

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.100
and you were saying these fragments were replicating hundreds of thousands of times

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:24.100
while the full genome was only replicating like 10 times or something.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.100
So why, like, what,

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.100
so I guess you're saying,

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.100
and correct me, if I'm wrong, I'm really not an expert.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:39.100
So are you saying that the full genome doesn't have a survivor ability?

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:44.100
It's not able to sort of replicate at a regular or at an expected level.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:48.100
And so that's why we would expect these viruses to die out very quickly or.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.100
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:56.100
That's the reason why they have been so notoriously difficult to get a handle on.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:00.100
And the only way they've been able to get a handle on it is to revert to DNA

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:06.100
and make large quantities that kind of do some of the things that they expect them to do in the laboratory.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:12.100
But actually, they don't recapitulate whatever signal they find in nature.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:18.100
They're just a terrible proxy for it.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.100
I ask another question because I don't think I'm answering your question sufficiently.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100
No, no, no. I think it's good.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:27.100
I mean, I just wanted to know whether you're basically saying that, you know,

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:32.100
from this paper and from these results, you're saying that these viruses in their fullness,

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:38.100
we're using these full genomes as the proxy for the existence of the presence of the virus, I guess.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:43.100
Yeah, and I remember the other thing that we're assuming is that this signal is pathogenic.

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:49.100
If you swab a bat and find this sequence and assume that the bat isn't making it,

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:55.100
it is the same thing as using chimpanzee cells to make vaccines

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.100
and then finding out that there's a virus in there.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:01.100
You didn't know it was in there and then claiming that it was always there.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.100
It's a very similar kind of mistake, but this time intentional.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:14.100
And I would argue that in the 80s and 90s, they were looking at whatever this mRNA signal is as a potential tool.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.100
A potential tool for medicine, a potential tool for therapeutics,

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:22.100
and that's what Ralph Beric's theme was for a very long time,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:28.100
was going to try and use coronavirus as a vaccine that would just spread by itself because they're so innocuous.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.100
And so once they figured out that they were never going to be able to harness this stuff,

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:37.100
even when they made large quantities of the RNA, they couldn't really use it for anything.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.100
They decided, well, what are we going to do with this giant background signal

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.100
that doesn't really seem to behave like our theories match?

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.100
Well, why don't we just use it?

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:51.100
And so I think they just used a background signal in the only way that they could use it.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.100
And if they needed to augment it, how they would augment it is with this cloning technology.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:03.100
They would make, for example, a truck full of RNA that was all identical to SARS-CoV-2

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:09.100
and spray summon Iran, and all those people would get sick because they would make all this RNA protein

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:14.100
and they would transfect their lungs because that's what happens when you spray RNA on things.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:20.100
It gets transfected, and these people would get sick, but it wouldn't really be transmissible.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:25.100
It wouldn't go anywhere, but all of the sequences that they wanted to be there would be present

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.100
and it would be very bright signal.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:33.100
And do the same thing in Wuhan and send one guy to Seattle and call him the Sohomish County man

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:38.100
and get all of your antibodies from him, get all of your genome sequence from him,

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.100
and then never sequence the virus again.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:49.100
And the connection between the PCR rollout and the original detection of the virus

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.100
is completely disconnected. They're not even remotely related to one another.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.100
And yet, somehow or another, those three things are connected.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:01.100
The isolation and sequence of the virus in a few people in a few places

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:07.100
with the rollout of PCR tests on that confounding background that are not related to each other at all.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:13.100
And again, the stuff that I think like Jonathan Engler and Jessica Hockett

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:19.100
and Martin Neal are finding with regard to the local mass casualty events

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.100
that actually never keep spreading.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.100
That's really the evidence that I think is the most damning.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.100
And it's actually the evidence I think a lot of people are trying to ignore

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.100
that Denny's brought to the table.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:33.100
They're happy to say that Denny thinks that 17 million people were killed by the shot,

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.100
but nobody seems to want to touch the fact that Denny has also shown

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.100
that lots of borders seem to be impenetrable to the super deadly virus.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.100
Okay, one final small question.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.100
What is the chance that or what are the, are there any false positive rates

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.100
for these discoveries of the genes?

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.100
Like when they say we found 10 copies of the full genome,

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.100
are they all 100% guaranteed to be?

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.100
No, I mean, that's the other problem, right?

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.100
The molecular biologists will argue that that sample is imperfect,

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.100
that a lot of them don't go through the pore, that's not really, you know,

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.100
sampling a small fraction of the total things that are there,

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.100
and so you're over representing the fidelity of nanopore.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.100
What I'm really trying to argue is that this signal of massive numbers

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:24.100
of subgenomic RNAs and very tiny, almost undetectable fractions

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:30.100
of what would be the full copy of the RNA translated from the DNA.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:37.100
Because please understand that if they don't do this cloning manipulation,

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.100
they can never get a full sequence.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.100
Never.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:46.100
It's always an assembled fraction of amplicons with large portions missing,

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.100
and you can find paper after paper after paper where they say

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:52.100
that we found a novel coronavirus in salmon,

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.100
and we found this gene, this gene, and this gene,

01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:02.100
and so taking the consensus coronavirus, we filled in the rest of the genes

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.100
necessary for it to be replication competent,

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.100
and then we made a clone of that, and then we did all our experiments with that.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.100
So that's really important to understand,

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:18.100
that the fidelity of coronavirus biology has been grossly over-exaggerated,

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.100
and that was used to confuse us,

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.100
and I think that's what the no-virus people really did,

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.100
whether they knew it or not.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:33.100
By sticking to isolation and purification,

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:37.100
we never really were able to progress to the stage where we were like,

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.100
wait, but then they lied about it,

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:44.100
and how do we explain the molecular biology that we see or think we're seeing,

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:52.100
and I think that not digging deep enough into that was also part of the slow role of the realization,

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.100
because we're all going to come to the eventual understanding of what they did to us.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.100
It's just a question of when.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.100
That's part of the way they're going to control demolish America,

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.100
is that Americans are eventually going to come to realize

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.100
that everything they knew about American history is twisted and wrong,

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.100
and so then they're going to be ashamed of themselves

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.100
and they're going to burn it down themselves.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:15.100
That's the plan, and so if you want to get ahead of that,

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.100
we've got to explain people what the lies are when they were told

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.100
and hope that people won't kill each other,

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:25.100
but instead turn their ire into a community uprising that takes our country back,

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:28.100
and the rest of the world has to do the same thing.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:31.100
The Netherlands and Germany and everywhere else, too.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:36.100
It's all a great big story to get us to tell our kids.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100
It's terrible.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100
Thank you.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.100
Okay, I think Thomas was next. Thomas been there.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.100
I can almost start crying.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.100
Thanks, Chee for your great presentation.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.100
Great to finally meet you.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100
You're such a hero, man.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.100
I can almost cry meeting you right now, man.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.100
Thank you so much for everything you've done.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.100
Come on, come on.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.100
No, really, man.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:07.100
Well, I put my simplest explanation how this COVID-RT PCR testing pandemic

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.100
was created in the chat.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.100
It was a treat from March 2020.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:16.100
I mean, theoretically, if you're running off cycles,

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.100
even if the test is 100% specific, which is not,

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:25.100
even if it was, theoretically, we can find one RNA or DNA fragment

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.100
of one single, any cold virus.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:33.100
And then, of course, the scam was to declare a positive test as infected

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.100
or even deceased from COVID.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.100
This was the scam.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.100
They didn't look at the CT.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.100
They didn't look at the clinical symptoms or the clinical findings.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:54.100
So with this method, we can create a XYRT PCR or PCR test.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.100
PCR testing pandemic with any cold virus.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:03.100
And I think now, when this WHO pandemic treaty threatens,

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:10.100
it is really important to explain to the people how this COVID-RT PCR

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:16.100
testing pandemic was fabricated as a recipe for any X, Y, PCR,

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.100
or T PCR testing pandemic.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:22.100
If the people realize this, they cannot be fooled again.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.100
And this, for me, this is something of the most important things

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.100
we have to do.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.100
And I think we totally agree.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:35.100
I mean, I can underline everything you told in your presentation.

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:40.100
And I always thank Bernie again and again, because he proved

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.100
what I, what I yesterday, did in March 2020,

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.100
that it was mainly an RT PCR testing pandemic.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.100
And the people did not frat.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.100
Most people at least are maybe on died from COVID,

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:56.100
but from anything that was mislabeled as COVID.

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.100
Yeah, thanks.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.100
Thank you, Caroline.

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:05.100
Hello, thank you so much.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.100
I understood almost everything.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.100
And that's saying something because I'm not a scientist.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:15.100
And, you know, all the drawings and all the long words don't,

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.100
I just don't get it all.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:23.100
But this was, this was based on, on things that I understand,

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.100
the explanations and the cars are great.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.100
I, you may have said this in words that are more complicated

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.100
than what I can understand.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:36.100
But I'm interested in knowing what did people have?

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:44.100
Was it a purely psychological hypochondriac reaction through fear

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.100
to the, to the propaganda?

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.100
Was it whatever they say?

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:55.100
EMF poisoning and, you know, a group of things like the poison

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.100
and the foods and the spraying and all of that.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:03.100
I never got notwithstanding that there are prominent people

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.100
who say virtually everyone had COVID.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.100
I, I didn't have it.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.100
And, you know, I was raised by a mother who said,

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.100
you're not sick.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.100
You know, it's like, I went to school anyway.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:19.100
People when I coughed and, you know, I just don't really believe in disease.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.100
So I can't afford to be sick, so I'm not sick.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.100
So I don't know whether that has anything to do with it.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:30.100
But, but I, I remember talking to Denny and saying, Denny,

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.100
how many people do you think died of COVID?

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.100
And he said, none.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.100
And that was just earthshaking to me.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.100
It's like, right, they died of the protocol.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:45.100
But I've heard a lot of the people in the bus stories talk about, you know,

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.100
my husband couldn't breathe.

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.100
He couldn't breathe.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.100
And so we went to the hospital.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:57.100
Well, I don't hear about perfectly healthy people not being able to breathe very often.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.100
So was that just fear?

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:05.100
I would, I would first preface by saying I'm just going to wildly speculate here.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:13.100
But what I really want you to do is to try and open, open the possibility space in your mind.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:23.100
So the story that I want you to consider accepting is that after the biosecurity state realized

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:28.100
that the only bioweapons that they were going to make were not going to do, you know,

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:33.100
the story of them being a nuclear weapon or better than a nuclear weapon is not possible.

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.100
That's not the way biology works.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.100
And they probably figured that out more than a decade ago.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:51.100
And the best way that I would describe it is if they figured that out but still wanted you to believe that story,

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:59.100
then as many compounding variables that would generate the fear and confusion and uncertainty

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:08.100
that could be twisted by messaging, like real, beautiful, coordinated messaging, like that guy standing on the train,

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:13.100
but with lots of friends could convince you that something was happening that wasn't.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:19.100
And I think the most important example is a woman by the name of Jessica Hawkins' data

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:28.100
who's been looking into New York City and basically shows that New York City is like a, it's a, oh, shoot.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.100
What did I do there? It's a, it's just an event where it went like this.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:41.100
There was a huge number of people, like 20,000 people died in four weeks and then it went right back to baseline and never spread again.

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:49.100
And so this event was recreated in several places around the world using various means of doing it.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:55.100
In Italy, people are speculating that they were given vaccines a few times in a row before the pandemic

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.100
and then they all got sick and they treated them badly with violent ventilators and killed them all.

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:09.100
There are people that are speculating that people who had a bacterial pneumonia were sent back to old folks homes in New York City

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:13.100
and not given antibiotics which would have cured their pneumonia instead they died.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:23.100
And you shouldn't underestimate the picture that I show there shows between five and 10,000 people every, I think it's, sorry,

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:32.100
it's between three and 5,000 people every week dying of pneumonia in America and that went up to 50,000 people sometimes.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:45.100
And that, that change is likely due to the absolute just drop off of use of standard antibiotics because of the narrative that antibiotics don't work on viral pneumonia.

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:56.100
And every one of these incremental changes in the way that we normally behave that resulted in more people dying was misconstrued as evidence of spread.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:07.100
And so some people probably did have a very bad bout of pneumonia that they got through on their own because they thought they had COVID and they stayed at home and isolated.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:13.100
And it was like needles in their, in their, and they were coughing stuff up and everything else.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:24.100
I mean, I think you have to consider and try to consider the possibility that there is not one explanation that describes what happened,

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:30.100
but the mythology they want you to accept is exactly that, that it's one explanation.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.100
It is the virus that spread.

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:38.100
And we just don't remember how many times we've been sick.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.100
You don't remember the times when you were super sick as a kid.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:54.100
I mean, maybe you remember one, but there's lots of times when you've been an adult and had three days of the flu and never wrote it down in your diary as, as, you know, a pandemic.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.100
And this is the same thing.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.100
We were paying attention to everybody that died.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:16.100
And if you look at that thing, I mean, one of the numbers you should share with your family and friends, we have 350 odd people, 350 million people in America and between 2,700,000 and 3 million people are expected to die every year.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.100
That's between 55 and 65,000 people a week.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.100
That's a lot of bodies.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:24.100
And that's normal.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:32.100
And so they tried very hard for you not to understand that process as they started to frame what was happening.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:47.100
And in that year, every year in those 50,000 people a week, there are people that get sick with pneumonia and die and it feels exactly like COVID supposed to feel with all the same symptoms of not being able to breathe and low oxygen and all the other stuff.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:56.100
And so that set of symptoms is not new, but we have been somehow convinced to attribute it to something new, if that makes sense.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.100
Okay, thank you, Tom.

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:29.100
Okay, yeah, I try to listen, you know, and I get an email and I have the idea for me, you can get some feedback about like what one thing that you had been saying in your repeatedly is this the viruses have this lipid coating and as somebody a lay person, I started getting really confused thinking about the

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:35.100
nano lipid particles and now you're saying it seemed like you were getting confused.

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:41.100
But now I realize that I need to go and look up basic virology and what a virus is.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.100
That's just a side point.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:54.100
The original reason why I wanted to bring up the question is, going back to the origin, you know, SARS-CoV-2 when it was sequenced.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:13.100
And I think I'm falling right into the trap that you're trying to prevent me from falling into, which is, you know, the Scooby-Doo of focusing on all these little details, thinking that these are, these are where are important, but they are, they're interesting and I'm curious.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:25.100
So I want to go back to the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered, that there was, if it's not getting a function, it was at least engineering design.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:35.100
And, you know, they have the martianis patented sequences in there and isn't that really interesting and how did that happen?

01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:41.100
And, you know, that somehow, gee, this just must be key, this must be important.

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.100
Sure.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:52.100
And so when you try to downplay the gain of function and all this engineering stuff, and I know other people would be mentioning binding sites in the ACE2.

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:56.100
And I know I'm throwing a lot out on the table.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.100
No, I love it.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.100
I can take it right now if you want me to take it right now.

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.100
Okay.

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:10.100
I'm so happy you brought up ACE2 because I think that was one of the most wonderful aspects of the first year of the pandemic.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:20.100
How much physiology we were forced to learn about ACE2 and fluid regulation and how widespread this receptor was and that it was also in circulation.

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:26.100
The engineering aspect of this, I think, is really simple after three years.

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:44.100
For about, I would say 25 years at least, the common parlance inside of NIH and NIAID and the Department of Defense with regard to viruses and bioweapons has been that antibodies are the way to solve this problem.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:51.100
They're not a correlate of immunity so much as they are, the immune marker that these products are supposed to produce.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.100
And it's the only measurement that they really have is production of antibodies.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:01.100
This has been known for a long time and it's been stuff that they fight about neutralizing non-neutralizing antibodies.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:20.100
This is all part of the discussion that's irrelevant because they're over accentuating the very final step in the immune response as if it's the one that's most paramount when in reality, it's likely that the immune response stops as quickly as it possibly can and avoids getting to the point of reproducing antibodies whenever possible.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:30.100
And it seems that the previous times that we're producing antibodies are really aimed at, and this is something that I would like to expand on as I'm moving forward.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:36.100
There were two schools of thought about immunology in the early 90s, early 2000s.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:43.100
One was centered around pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the other was associated with damage-associated molecular patterns.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:48.100
And there are two very different opposing views about how the immune system produces memory.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:53.100
One is a pathogen-specific thing where you have to make memory to every pathogen because they're all different.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:29:02.100
And the other one is about the idea that evolutionary mechanisms have conserved these damaging epitopes that are often hydrophobic.

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:13.100
And your immune system has formed to generalize across these damage-associated molecular patterns and minimize the memory response to them and generalize across them.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:26.100
And so they're very different opposing views because one suggests that there's very little need to augment your immune system and you better damn well understand what the damage-associated molecular pattern signal is before you try to do it.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:38.100
And on the other hand, there's this thing where there's a unique response to every antigen, and then there you can use that to make a product for every antigen or product for every epitope or a product for every pathogen.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:50.100
And the NIH unsurprisingly chose to let go of everybody in NIAID that was working on the damage-associated molecular pattern research line in the late 2000s

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:56.100
and left all these people who were working on pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the specificity of the response.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:02.100
So why am I here, cue me up again?

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.100
Oh yeah, so then the reality is the engineering was the story.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:13.100
So I want you to imagine a scenario where they want you to accept transfection as a vaccine,

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:19.100
and they want you to accept it as they're selling it right now, which is a universal methodology for it.

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.100
All they have to do is swap out the RNA and then they have a different vaccine.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.100
And they want you to accept that idea.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:33.100
The way that they thought to get you to accept that idea was to design a protein that would be its own adjuvant.

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:43.100
And so much of what is in the spike protein that everybody's been up in arms about all this time has in reality been the signal of epitopes,

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:54.100
which were added to get the attention of the immune system and produce a robust, reliable, and expected antibody response.

01:30:54.100 --> 01:31:02.100
And so if you have a protein that the immune system treats all the same, or even worse, you have a protein that you just found in the wild

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:10.100
and you have no idea what parts of it are going to attract to your immune system, you might say, well, naively, we're going to transfect you to the whole protein.

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:16.100
But these people were clever. They knew that they could pretend, I think, no, I'm speculating.

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:23.100
They knew they could pretend that they just found this protein and they took 45 minutes to encode it in the mRNA in a way they went.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:27.100
But in reality, what I think they did was they already had a designer protein.

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:33.100
They already knew what epitopes they wanted to find and then they made a clone of that thing in a coronavirus genome

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:39.100
and seeded it in a few places so they could shrug their shoulders and say, oh, wow, this protein's pretty cool.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:48.100
Let's make an mRNA of it. And lo and behold, four exposures still gives them a robust antibody response that they can publish in papers.

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:56.100
Well, that's handy, isn't it? And if they used a sort of generic epitope that would just piss off antigen-presenting cells

01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:03.100
and get a neutralizing antibody that they could test for or already predict was going to be there so that their test would detect for it,

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:16.100
it's almost like a stacked deck of cards in the sense that they pretend that, oh, it's a random virus that came out of nature

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:22.100
when in reality the fifth card was the card that they put in there and then they said, oh, we'll use this one for the vaccine.

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:29.100
So if there was engineering, that was the engineering and they covered it up with a three-year scooby-doo about an engineered virus.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:36.100
And everybody arguing about how the spike protein was a toxin and it was going to cause amyloid and it was going to cause prion disease

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:41.100
when all along they knew that transfection to that protein would be expected to do all those things.

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:48.100
And so as long as they attributed myocarditis to the virus first, then they could get away with the shot causing it.

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:54.100
As long as they contribute prion disease to the virus first, then the shot can get away with causing it.

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:59.100
And they've pulled this shit every damn time with every single piece of the biology we've uncovered.

01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:03.100
That's what I think.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:10.100
Wow, okay. So, and they could have really designed SARS-CoV-2 itself.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.100
I'm just repeating what you're saying. I see.

01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.100
But really they only needed to design the spot.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:19.100
And they want that robust antibody response.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:23.100
And what was the other school that got pushed out?

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:32.100
It's called damage-associated molecular patterns as opposed to pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:41.100
And so in one model, the immune system is learning molecular patterns that are associated with the unique virus.

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:49.100
And in the other model of the immune system, the immune system is trying to generalize across molecular patterns that can cause damage.

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:55.100
And so if a signal, be it a coronavirus, doesn't have one of those patterns in it,

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:59.100
then your body will necessarily not develop immunity to it.

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:05.100
And I think that's how you should better describe what coronaviruses as a signal were before the pandemic.

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.100
They were an innocuous noise that your body basically ignored.

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:16.100
And this is the first example of apparently something that we've never seen before, so we're responding to it.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:21.100
And I just don't think that's a, that's not a real story.

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:24.100
Thank you.

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:29.100
Denise, thank you for next.

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:32.100
Okay, thank you. Okay, yeah.

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:42.100
I don't know if it's a question or suggestion or what, but if I accept your premise that there was no COVID that caused death.

01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.100
Let's put it that way. Okay. No, no, no COVID pathogen that caused death, no particularly.

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:53.100
And I've been saying that, as you know, for years, based on other kinds of data.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:35:11.100
But one of the things I've observed is that one of the sectors of society that is arguing for this idea that there was a deadly pathogen and that it caused a lot of death is the medical clinicians who treat people.

01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:30.100
And so, for example, I have argued in one of my papers that Ivermectin is extraordinarily effective at treating bacterial pneumonia and that you can fool yourself by prescribing Ivermectin that you save someone from bacterial pneumonia and think that you save them from COVID.

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:45.100
And I think that the medical freedom people and the people who are convinced they've saved hundreds or thousands of lives in their own practice and they go on and on about this deadly COVID are in a sense part of the problem.

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:53.100
The problem being that it's pushing this idea that there was a deadly pathogen that could cause death.

01:35:53.100 --> 01:36:04.100
So I want to do a reaction to that because I, every time I hear them, but they're unwitting, right? They're unwitting participants because they're unwitting participants because they have been.

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:13.100
And I think that that's the magic of also the hype of hydroxychloroquine was the same thing. These are not, these are not substances without benefit.

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:36.100
And they are substances that before the pandemic, we basically were unaware of for the most part. And so to create a debate about them and then also, obviously, a disingenuous evaluation of them with these fake trials that were obviously bad or doses that were obviously high so that people would argue again within this limited spectrum of debate without actually coming to the realization,

01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:44.100
that maybe we should have just had Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine over the counter before the pandemic and lots of other things would have gone away.

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:48.100
But, you know, we didn't think that way, of course, and we're still not thinking about it.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:54.100
All of the argument and all of the movement for medical freedom and all of the movement that you're treating people and we could have treated them.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:37:04.100
We could have saved so many more lives. And all of that is sending us directly in the wrong direction because there was no particularly virulent pathogen period.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:13.100
All of the deaths have been explained by the many things that you put in your points and the many things that I've been talking about in my articles and so on.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:21.100
It's not hard to cause death when you completely overhaul the society and stress everyone all to hell and isolate them.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:30.100
And especially vulnerable people in institutions. It's not hard to cause significant numbers of excess deaths when you start doing that to a society.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:35.100
And the places where they did it most aggressively have the biggest peaks of excess death.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:50.100
We showed that in our recent paper for Peru, where they called in 10,000 military reservists to go and get everybody in the countryside that tested positive and put them through hell and ripped them out of their families and everything.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:55.100
And there's these huge peaks of death. And then when they stop doing that, the deaths come down.

01:37:55.100 --> 01:38:09.100
And then there's an election. They start doing it again. The deaths go up again. I mean, there's so many direct concrete examples where we kind of know what the causal mechanism is of those deaths, you know.

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:33.100
So that's been my perspective all along, but I just wanted to try to get it across to treatment clinicians that, you know, please accept the idea that you may actually be fooling yourself at the deepest level when you think that there was a virulent new viral pathogen.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:41.100
Absolutely. I don't percent agree. I don't think I can really add anything to it. I think Thomas would agree to.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.100
I don't know about that, but OK, thanks.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:54.100
I just wanted to fully agree. I may. I also believe it's mainly the changing of the behavior of how we care for our patients.

01:38:54.100 --> 01:39:04.100
I never used hydroxychloroquine. I never used ivermectin. None of my patients who I saw early had to be hospitalized or even died.

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:22.100
Just today, I left the WhatsApp group of all these early treatment guys. They are still convinced that there was a pandemic of a killer virus, and this is not a good idea. This is exactly what we have to tell the people that it was not the case.

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:35.100
If you want to proceed. I really have the same problem with these guys. Most patients were treated, were diagnosed too late or not at all.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:50.100
They had to be full blown bacteria, secondary bacterial pneumonia. They came to the hospital and even there, sometimes the colleagues were looking at the world through their COVID lenses and did not even diagnose the dent.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:59.100
They had sepsis and then they have hyplongs. I mean, if you have if you miss bacterial pneumonia, you do end up with hyplongs.

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:13.100
There is no CT criteria on how you can distinguish bacterial pneumonia with sepsis, ARDS from from COVID pneumonia. You cannot, you simply cannot.

01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:22.100
I also believe they fooled themselves. And in the God's Eververse, the more patients died, the God's Eververse.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:30.100
So I fully agree with this. And sorry or sorry about that. I have to say one person who disappoints me more and more is Robert Kennedy.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:38.100
Now he, this book came out. He's again blathering about these lovely shots and about the pandemic of a killer virus.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:46.100
Now hold on though. And all the things that I said are in that book though. They're all in there. Everything that I said is in the book.

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:56.100
Every quote of what of me in the book is just the talk I just gave that it had to be clones that they had to fake it. And then, and they're even on page 441.

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:01.100
It quotes me as saying there didn't even need to be a real virus. So it's in the book.

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:08.100
So maybe I'm just going to say I just ordered the book. I misunderstood the message. So, yeah. Okay.

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:09.100
Okay.

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:14.100
Okay. You earned yourself a Christmas present as I send it to you.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:27.100
I mean, I'm not saying I'm not saying that 500 pages aren't about a lab leak, but there are 18 pages where I have biology in there that says that that didn't need to be and it probably wasn't. So it's in the book.

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:40.100
Something else I stayed again and again. Imagine. Don't don't charge your neighbor until you walk two moons in his moccasins.

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:56.100
It's an old chain pro war, but this is also true for adversaries. So if I was a psycho calf, who should plan this pandemic and if I was not suicidal, I would not choose dangerous virus.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:05.100
For the very dangerous virus that cannot even be yet pandemic because we are sick that's rapidly or even died that we have not a lot of social contacts.

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:18.100
But I will not choose a dangerous virus because it could hurt or even kill media as well. So I will choose a relatively harmless or even no virus and inflate.

01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:33.100
The PR and PCR into the killer lives. And the part part of this PR, of course, is this library story. The people, even if the people do not believe it, they still have the best way.

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:37.100
Oh my God, this is a bio weapon. This country is the bio weapon.

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:51.100
In fact, the bio weapon, of course, is the directed by a weapon, the targeted by a weapon that that does not affect the criminals and this bio weapon, of course, or the injections.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:43:00.100
It's that simple and just some common use some common sense, but common sense lost in February, 2020.

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:05.100
Okay.

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:11.100
That was great Thomas. Thank you for clarifying your position.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:19.100
Mark, I call yourself silent. I would be very interested in your thoughts about all these.

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:24.100
Yes, I think it's good. I'm silent.

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:40.100
And Jay Jay, thanks for your presentation. It's got me thinking about a lot of things. But I'm hoping for clarification because I, I totally agree with you that there's deception on many levels in COVID and beyond.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:49.100
And it's really difficult to sort through. And I always, I asked myself, well, what are the goals or the objectives of all of this.

01:43:50.100 --> 01:44:02.100
And so I think I heard you say that one goal was to decode the human genome, possibly another one is for us to destroy ourselves and we see what is going on will be so upset.

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:12.100
Another goal is to maybe shorten the lives of many, which we're observing and prevent future births.

01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:24.100
Could you maybe clarify and summarize what you, why you think there are so many lies and so many layers of deception and what those ultimate objectives are.

01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:30.100
I think it can also be adequately reflected in the term personalized medicine.

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:45.100
I think basically they've come to the conclusion that any kind of genetic manipulation of humans is not going to pass the typical random randomized control trial, certainly not.

01:44:46.100 --> 01:45:02.100
And so their way of getting people, you know, the skilled TV watchers to accept that transfection is relatively safe is to keep repeating now for the last few months that a billion, five billion people have been given the shot so obviously they're safe.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:08.100
And anybody that was hurt is now being led to believe that it's because the shot was contaminated.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:22.100
And only recently this paper from UCL comes out and says that actually it's the chemical alteration that causes frame shifts and that's huge, that's terrible, and that's causing a bunch of aberrant immune responses.

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:41.100
But it's still, it still begs the question that in the best case scenario, transfection would have never been a way of augmenting the immune system and we're still avoiding actually answering or saying that out loud because the intention is to keep rolling out genetic technologies.

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:55.100
The intention is to never go back to doing vaccines the old fashioned way. And so we may get inhaled vaccines, we may get electroporated vaccines, we may get vaccines which produce antibodies instead of producing.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:46:11.100
So one of the very interesting things that happened during the pandemic was the intellectual property space that governs monoclonal antibodies was changed drastically so that it's not really clear whether any patent on a traditional monoclonal antibody is really enforceable anymore.

01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:28.100
And so one of the natural evolutions of transfection which has been brewing in the background for a long time was circumventing the expensive production of monoclonal antibodies by just transfecting people in their liver to produce the antibody that they've identified

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:42.100
or designed to be appropriate for the transfection and then they'll just do that so they can fight cancer that way and they're going to start to augment other diseases and things like that with antibodies in that nature.

01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:54.100
So the progress that they want to make is to do a bait and switch where they tell you a story about how this technology was rushed but in essence we don't have to test it really anymore.

01:46:55.100 --> 01:47:14.100
That's another very big part of this but I still think the overarching goal is to make sure that we as in me and you are the last generation to think of ourselves as being really sovereign over our lives and sovereign over our children's lives.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:26.100
And they want really us to in some way or another not pass on that value to our children so that they can start requiring the sampling of this data from beginning to end.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.100
That's what I think.

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.100
Thanks.

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.100
That helps.

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.100
Okay.

01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:40.100
Do you have a hand up still?

01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.100
Yes.

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:42.100
Again.

01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:43.100
Again.

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:44.100
Again.

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.100
Yeah.

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.100
So.

01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.100
Okay.

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:52.100
So this is first I'm going to say something a little sacrilegious and then I'm going to ask the question.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:48:04.100
I don't think that I'm not convinced that transfection itself is dangerous or is necessarily the most toxic aspect of these injections.

01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:09.100
I mean the cationic lipids, the damage to cell walls, there's all kinds of things.

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:16.100
You haven't convinced me that the fact that you're transfecting is a particular danger.

01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:33.100
Now having said that, I believe and this is just my conjecture but I believe that the military and in conjunction with the elite and some of the bigger people actually believe the fantasy that they can change us fundamentally.

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.100
By this transfection technology using nanoparticles.

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:49.100
I think they actually believe that and they are on a program, a research program to find out how they can achieve it and to what degree it works and what the problems are.

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:56.100
And I see this as kind of a first step experiment where you do it globally like this and you see what happens.

01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:10.100
But I honestly believe that they think that they'll be able to design the mRNA that they need to affect a particular thing, a particular bodily function or whatever.

01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:16.100
I think they believe they can protect the people they want or change people in the way that they want.

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:25.100
I think this is real that they actually believe this and so for military reasons and also maybe ideological reasons,

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.100
they're just going to go there, they're doing it.

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.100
And so how would you react to that?

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:32.100
I'm sure that's the case.

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:46.100
I would say that the reason why there were so many different stories about all the things that happened with the shots around the world from magnets to 5G to graphene and all this other stuff is likely because they already took advantage of the first round to test different things.

01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:57.100
And even if not to test them to actually put them out there so that there would be these conflicting stories that could be debunked from different directions and set up that confusion.

01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:13.100
So I have no doubt in my mind that genetic technologies, DNA and RNA are at their infancy and they know that the only way that they're going to learn how to use these things in their imagination is to roll them out and let them test on people because it doesn't work to test on animals.

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:15.100
So I'm totally with you with that.

01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:35.100
Just to tell you a story about, just to tell you a story about transfection, when we would use it in mice, one of the beauties of using a mouse as an animal model is that you get all the anatomy because you can sacrifice the animal and make a very detailed anatomical reconstruction of the brain.

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:45.100
Any sort of transfection using mRNA and electroporation, gold particles, DNA and adenovirus, they all do the same thing.

01:50:45.100 --> 01:51:00.100
They target neurons and the neurons express a protein they're not supposed to express and it doesn't matter whether it was a glow-in-the-dark protein for anatomy or whether it was a protein that was functionally altering the neuron or whether it was an ion channel.

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:20.100
When you express these proteins in these neurons, you have a limited time window in which you can do your experiment and also sacrifice the animal and reconstruct the brain circuit that you manipulated because after about eight weeks of transfection, wherever you injected that transfection is entirely obliterated.

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:44.100
And I can't tell you for sure that it's the immune system, it could also be the overexpression of the proteins, but we have spent, sometimes we spend a few months, sometimes we spend a few weeks trying to optimize that time window where we can still sacrifice the animal and reconstruct the neurons that are there without them having been lesioned before we do that experiment.

01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:58.100
And for either overexpression and toxicity or because the immune system responds by destroying those neurons, that's what you get and you get a real lesion.

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:12.100
So I actually had a huge problem with an experiment at Pitt because we helped somebody do an experiment in monkeys and for whatever reason, they didn't understand what I said.

01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:19.100
And they let the monkey go for 12 weeks before they sacrificed the animal at the end of the experiment and they had no anatomy.

01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:23.100
The entire area of the brain that they had been recording from for eight weeks was just lesioned.

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:37.100
And they were like, how come this didn't, your prep didn't work? And I'm like, it can't work. You can't have this status of foreign protein being expressed in high volume and a neuron for that long.

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:50.100
And so I would argue that the only reason why transfection in the muscle is not having more devastating effects is because the liver is very good at detoxifying and the body is very good at detoxifying.

01:52:51.100 --> 01:53:08.100
But if the body makes a mistake and it attacks the endothelial cells, then you can get any range of effects that include, you know, myocarditis is not endothelial cells, but it's the same kind of random transfection of cells that then the immune system responds to.

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:16.100
And then a question is, how robust is the autoimmune response? Is it robust enough to have any symptoms in a year or two years or three years?

01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:25.100
Or will it take 10 years before your body's finally weakened your endothelial cells enough for your blood brain barrier to leak or for you to have a stroke or for my friend to have an aneurysm?

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:28.100
Okay, okay, but let me respond just quickly.

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:29.100
Yeah, sure.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:31.100
Have a look at responding.

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:38.100
Is it possible that you're wearing, when you when you describe all this, when you do the experiments and everything, you're wearing your transcription glasses.

01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:56.100
Isn't it possible that by the intervention, your causing damage, which is not trans, transfection type damage, but which is related to the delivery method, even though you've used different methods, but you're always causing damage.

01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:57.100
Yes.

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:04.100
And it's that damage that that that is that is causing these lesions and the reaction of the immune and so on and so on.

01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:12.100
That is possible, but in all of those scenarios, the immune system still needs to clean up the mess without making a mistake of developing autoimmunity.

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:26.100
And so if transfection destroys tissues in a way that's unnatural or destroys tissues in a way that causes the immune response to be somehow overzealous, then you're going to have autoimmunity.

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:31.100
And so it doesn't necessarily need to be the immune response to the protein and overexpression.

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.100
It can also be just to the death of the cell.

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:37.100
And either way, that's the immune response having to ignore self and.

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:43.100
Okay, but the death of the cell, my point is the death of the cell or the damage to the cell can occur whether or not there was transfection.

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.100
Yes, that's true.

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.100
I can't argue with that.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.100
That's true.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.100
Okay.

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:53.100
The basic of the fundamental sin was transfection.

01:54:53.100 --> 01:55:00.100
It's not the bad thing if you can make a patient suffering from type one diabetes is producing insulin.

01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.100
This is a good thing.

01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:09.100
This is a protein of my own body, the the basic fundamental sin was to transfect.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:13.100
With a gene encoding a protein forward to the body.

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:27.100
And then I mean, nobody who was who was involved in this development is that stupid that he does not know the fundamental principle of our immune system to distinguish self from non-self.

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.100
And then the catastrophe.

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:42.100
I heard that took a drive at least when when we need such a huge doses to to to induce immune response and the production.

01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:45.100
So that so many cells are killed.

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:50.100
If only a few cells would would would be killed, the damage would be stopped clinical.

01:55:51.100 --> 01:56:04.100
But obviously the dosage they use to induce this antibody response is so enormous that in many patients, so many cells are destroyed that they get sick or even died.

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:15.100
And then it is the most heinous poison I ever saw because this is the fundamental problem that Michael explained nicely in his book.

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:20.100
But then there comes the toxicity of the lipid nanoparticles in all these.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:28.100
So there are many many levels of toxicity that may be not in all patients work in the same manner.

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.100
And this makes it make it even more complicated.

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:35.100
And I think the fundamental they made two errors.

01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:41.100
They underestimated so much underestimated the toxicity of these injections.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.100
It becomes more and more difficult to hide this.

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:49.100
And they underestimated the resistance of the populace.

01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:54.100
They thought they might inject 95 or maybe 99% of the people.

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:59.100
And then there will be no control, no unvaccinated control group, I guess.

01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:07.100
I think they thought that they could put the pig upon the so much pressure that there would not be a control group.

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:10.100
And then doing 50% of the problem would be solved.

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:19.100
And now they have this huge problem that is 17 million, at 20, 17 million and counting on more and more difficult to hide.

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:26.100
I would just add that the only time where they've tried to replace a protein in somebody who was missing it.

01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:30.100
The first example was Jesse Gelsinger in the United States.

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:38.100
They used an adenovirus to replace a protein that he was missing in his liver and he died of liver failure within three weeks.

01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:40.100
And that's because it was a foreign protein.

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:49.100
So the immune system attacked his liver even though they were replacing what should be an enzyme that he had because he didn't have it.

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:53.100
His immune system grew up to attack it or to recognize it as non-self.

01:57:53.100 --> 01:58:02.100
And so unlike they expected, instead of fixing him, he was fine for about a week and then he had an absolutely catastrophic liver failure and died.

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:08.100
And that is really the start of this catastrophic train crash.

01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.100
It's a difference whether you have no protein at all or just a deficiency.

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.100
Deficiency would be no problem in that aspect.

01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:27.100
He probably had a mutant version of the protein, so the anti-genic difference between the functionally intact and the deficient one would be pretty small.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:35.100
I think if I remember this correctly, this was mostly a reaction to the adenoviral proteins, which are foreign.

01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:42.100
I mean, if you use that vector, you introduce a ton of foreign proteins along with that normal one.

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:51.100
Yeah, that's actually the sales talk for the mRNA vaccines, not for the mRNA technology.

01:58:51.100 --> 01:59:05.100
In the context, different from vaccines that you do not need to introduce any vector derived foreign proteins, but you can introduce only the replacement intact version of the body's own protein.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.100
Okay. Dr. Johansson.

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:16.100
Thank you for getting me a new title. I needed that.

01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:25.100
We have people coming into Stockholm right now for the Nobel Prize award ceremony this weekend.

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:31.100
And so Kariko and Weisman will get their little medal and some money.

01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:45.100
There are some of us who tried to protest. What do you, could you tell us your view on the role of the Sudiridine in the mRNA process?

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:56.100
Is it as bad as some people say? Should we protest? Are they dangerous people? And where can we read? Where can we get some facts? Some, some, some good write-ups.

01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:11.100
One of the best things that's been written is what Michael Palmer and Sukrit wrote, that little pamphlet. I mean, it really, I don't think that anyone has produced an exhaustive list of all the reasons why this is a bad idea.

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:18.100
But that's as close as I've come to an exhaustive expose on why this would be a bad idea.

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:29.100
But the implications of the chemical alterations and the codon optimization, it's just adding layers of variability.

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:42.100
And the variability is not a few more possibilities, but it's each one is like another log component of more variability. That's what makes it so nasty.

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:52.100
And that's why I tried to start out with the statement that even if this was the perfect transfection and made the perfect spike protein every time, it would still be a bad idea.

02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.100
Right.

02:00:53.100 --> 02:01:08.100
Now, one last question. Can you put your contact details or something? I can reach you because I need to, I need to send you some material. I think I have an idea of how they can get rid of the control group.

02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:25.100
Because I've been contacted as some of the people on the call here know by people that want me to participate with the US Department of Defense in the next phase of what's going to come.

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:31.100
That's called the pandemic phase two. I'd like to discuss it with you so that you can.

02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:37.100
I put my oh sorry I put that in a private chat to Tom, whoever the hell that was that I was. What the heck.

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:39.100
He probably needs it too.

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.100
Yeah.

02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:45.100
Let me see here the whole meeting group. There's my email.

02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:51.100
It's just JJ period, my last name and then at children's health defense.org.

02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:54.100
Okay, fine. Thank you.

02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:07.100
Thank you very much guys for taking the time to listen to me. I know that I haven't told you anything you didn't know, but it's been a long time and everybody here is a hero. We just all haven't had time to hang out. And so I appreciate it a lot.

02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:13.100
Yeah, first of all, I haven't said much this evening. I just wanted to say thank you very much.

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:23.100
And while I'm not a scientist, I'm a lay person. I can't comment on the scientific concepts here, but I just wanted to convey that I thought your presentation, your skill set and talent.

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:33.100
In your presentation and in your in your educational abilities was a very superb. You were very talented and you defined job today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:37.100
Thank you. And you're in Pittsburgh. I am in Pittsburgh. Yep.

02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:41.100
It's right by my hometown. So yeah, very familiar.

02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:51.100
Wow. Yeah, we moved here on a whim and we love it actually. It was very surprising. I don't know if we would have liked so many other places coming back to I grew up in Wisconsin.

02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:56.100
So, okay, a lot of big cities might have been bad for us, but Pittsburgh was great.

02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.100
Wonderful.

02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:02.100
May I ask you about working? How are you earning?

02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:08.100
The CHD is paying me now as a staff scientist. Thank goodness. So that was great.

02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:13.100
I got hired. I got hired in July. So I'm very happy to be working under Brian Hooker now.

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:18.100
Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah. Thanks.

02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:29.100
Can I can I make a request to this group that as soon as the video is made public to send us an actual email so that we can spread it on social media right away.

02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:45.100
Yeah. In fact, you're the second person to ask for it to this evening. Fortunately, there aren't so many edits to this. So I can probably get it out to everybody literally quite quickly. I don't have to edit much. So that's, that's great.

02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:56.100
So, yes, absolutely. I'm going to leave it there just to make sure that I don't, I don't know what they talk about at the end here.

02:03:56.100 --> 02:04:04.100
That last guy that came in from Germany or from, I don't know where he was from, Romania, wherever he said he was from.

02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:09.100
And the next phase was very interesting.

02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:18.100
I couldn't recognize, I didn't recognize him from anywhere before and I haven't gotten an email from him yet. I'm not sure.

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:30.100
I guess I haven't talked in a while. This is also from basketball practice. So anyway, hopefully we'll have another show tomorrow night.

02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:38.100
Yeah, there's no basketball practice. I'll be on tomorrow night at some point. Thank you very much for joining me. I'm glad you watch till the end.

02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:45.100
Fun times, ladies and gentlemen, fun times. Thanks for joining me. I'll see you again soon.

02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:48.100
Maybe I'll play it out.

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:18.100
I don't know who I was talking to there. One of my kids wants to come in here.

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:25.100
Alright, thank you very much for joining me. I don't know what's going on with my voice. I think I better go get a drink.

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:31.100
It could also be that my voice has dropped even lower now. Thank you very much.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:06:05.100
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:11.100
It's too dark in here for this to work. Sorry about that. I thought I could sit down here and laugh at myself, but I can't.

02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:17.100
Oh boy, something's going on with my voice. I'll see you tomorrow.

02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:47.100
Thank you very much.
