WEBVTT

00:45.660 --> 00:49.045
Humanity was hit with dual biological weapons.

00:49.145 --> 01:00.281
When I say dual, I mean by the manufactured SARS-CoV-2 virus that was manufactured in collaboration with UNC Chapel Hill and Wuhan.

01:00.302 --> 01:00.822
Stop lying!

01:01.543 --> 01:06.427
that that has exposed basically the entire population to the spike protein.

01:06.848 --> 01:17.997
But then we also have the second biological weapon, which was the mRNA injections, which installed about seven times more spike into people and those who received the injection.

01:18.777 --> 01:25.443
And now we do understand that this can indeed shed onto others, particularly when you're freshly vaccinated.

01:26.464 --> 01:29.627
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

03:17.617 --> 03:18.319
birds chirping

03:37.216 --> 03:40.299
There's no need to feel down, I said, young man.

03:40.319 --> 03:44.042
Pick yourself off the ground, I said, young man.

03:44.783 --> 03:51.389
Cause you're in a new town, there's no need to be unhappy, young man.

03:52.289 --> 03:55.372
There's a place you can go, I said, young man.

03:56.133 --> 03:59.216
When you're short on your dough, you can stay there.

04:11.569 --> 04:22.175
The thing with Joe, the thing with Joe, yeah, is I don't know that we have a lot to talk about because of my, you know, my idea of what he's done to comedy.

04:22.475 --> 04:22.695
Sure.

04:22.915 --> 04:24.336
And I don't think it's great.

04:24.937 --> 04:26.437
I think that it's tribalized.

04:26.798 --> 04:33.781
And I think that, you know, he's created a sort of army of people that think they know comedy, but they only know a specific thing.

04:34.082 --> 04:37.343
And what they think is good is not necessarily good.

04:37.363 --> 04:38.364
It may be what they're like.

04:38.772 --> 04:49.525
So it seems that Marc Maron has reignited his decades-long beef with Joe Rogan and his group of comedic assassins, as he just called them out on two separate podcasts in the span of a week.

04:49.810 --> 04:53.472
And Mark Maron's not just going after these guys because he doesn't like them.

04:53.692 --> 04:56.413
As he puts it, he has reasonable criticism for them.

04:57.274 --> 05:00.756
And so what we're supposed to believe is that this man is not on a script.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.396
He has not been queued up.

05:03.497 --> 05:08.900
We're supposed to believe that this guy is just acting spontaneously just like these guys believe.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.680
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

05:10.740 --> 05:19.382
is acting spontaneously, that Joe Rogan is acting spontaneously and booking guests spontaneously based on the last video that he saw.

05:19.902 --> 05:27.924
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a national security theater and none of these people are doing anything but what they are scripted to do and say.

05:28.384 --> 05:31.945
That's why he has an HBO special where he gets to say it.

05:32.905 --> 05:33.945
It's reasonable criticism.

05:34.005 --> 05:34.906
Reasonable criticism.

05:35.126 --> 05:50.950
Like in his most recent special, Panicked, Mark actually spends a good portion of time calling out the anti-woke comedy scene that Rogans forged in Austin, criticizing them for normalizing slurs, punching down at marginalized groups, and overall platforming dangerous ideas.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.691
Pterodactyl arms?

05:53.551 --> 05:55.252
You supposed to put that nigga on the grill.

05:55.292 --> 05:56.472
He ain't even supposed to live.

05:57.887 --> 06:02.392
And if you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend you go watch that entire special.

06:02.512 --> 06:12.462
But to give you an idea of what he talks about in that special, here's him poking fun at the idea of Theo von having Adolf Hitler on his podcast, and what exactly that would sound like.

06:12.903 --> 06:16.947
I think if Hitler were alive today, he'd probably appear on Theo von's podcast.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.007
And Theo would be like, see, y'all did a lot of meth, right?

06:25.087 --> 06:29.009
I mean, all the Nazis were all fucked up on meth, right, Hitler?

06:29.029 --> 06:31.351
That shit will make you crazy, dog.

06:34.312 --> 06:45.579
I hope you can see how people on the fake populist right, conservative right, have been lured into a trap over the last six years.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.542
And now the trap is closing very rapidly around them.

06:50.487 --> 07:00.792
around us, around America, and it's going to sever our population in a way that maybe cannot be healed if we are not made aware of what's happening right now.

07:01.673 --> 07:03.834
This guy is a scripted actor.

07:04.494 --> 07:17.321
He was behaving, he was questioning the narrative on a remote website called the Burning Platform in 2020 and was actually in contact with yours truly.

07:18.257 --> 07:34.054
under the pseudonym of the the hard scrabble farmer and so I gotta tell you this is some serious business when this guy is now being elevated across the podcast universe at least eight

07:35.177 --> 07:52.441
At least eight of the podcasts that are on my radar have promoted this guy's HBO special and specifically promoted this idea that Joe Rogan and him are on opposite sides of some kind of adult spectrum of behavior, which is absurd.

07:52.981 --> 07:58.182
These people are actors and the only difference is they're not on TV, they're on your phone.

07:58.542 --> 08:04.166
So now he's on a podcast press tour for that new special, and he's sent shots left and right at the entire Rogansphere.

08:20.458 --> 08:40.086
Like, in this recent Bad Friends episode, he goes at Rogan in a pretty hilarious and major way, roasting him for leading an army of enlightened meatheads and predicting that they'll run out of material pretty quickly, since the majority of jokes that they tell are pretty surface-level jabs at marginalized groups that they've completely beaten into the ground.

08:40.246 --> 08:45.129
Like, if you know anything about this Rogan era of comedy, you'd know that they do this quite frequently.

08:45.369 --> 08:47.710
Like, to this day, they're probably still making COVID-19 jokes.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.172
And Mark Maron considers this shtick to be hack.

08:51.392 --> 08:52.573
But yeah, who me and who else?

08:52.653 --> 08:52.974
Rogan.

08:53.174 --> 08:53.494
Okay.

08:53.714 --> 08:54.054
Who's that?

08:54.114 --> 08:54.455
Who's that?

08:54.595 --> 08:55.135
Joe Rogan.

08:55.175 --> 08:55.556
Joey.

08:55.716 --> 08:56.416
Joseph Rogan?

08:56.456 --> 08:57.297
Yeah, he's out of Texas.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.938
Oh, Texas.

08:58.958 --> 08:59.599
Got it.

08:59.679 --> 09:00.099
I got it.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.400
Got it.

09:01.701 --> 09:02.621
You love awesome, don't you?

09:02.641 --> 09:04.463
He's running half the planet out of Texas.

09:04.523 --> 09:06.825
Yeah.

09:07.205 --> 09:09.587
He's got a tight hold on the enlightened meathead.

09:11.374 --> 09:13.077
Dude, Marin's disdain.

09:13.097 --> 09:15.821
It's not disdain, it's reasonable criticism.

09:15.861 --> 09:16.663
Reasonable criticism.

09:16.683 --> 09:18.546
When was the last time you spoke with him?

09:20.895 --> 09:21.415
I don't know.

09:21.555 --> 09:22.415
That's a good question.

09:22.656 --> 09:23.876
I guess it would have been at the store.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.057
I never talked to him in Austin.

09:25.497 --> 09:38.703
So I'm making the argument that we have been set up exactly for this kind of cultural introspective face plant where America is going to be permanently divided.

09:38.783 --> 09:42.185
The people that are still following Trump right now, still rooting for

09:43.547 --> 09:49.490
Bobby Kennedy and Pauly Tommy and Mary Holland and Jimmy Dore and Dr. Drew.

09:50.270 --> 09:58.795
These people are going to be ostracized, essentially, from all of America.

09:58.935 --> 10:01.076
All of America is already there.

10:01.836 --> 10:05.118
And so if your family and friends are trapped in that universe,

10:06.035 --> 10:13.800
This is one of the only streams on earth, maybe the only stream on earth that you can show them that might help them get out.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.202
And the only reason why I'm doing this is because I was there.

10:18.282 --> 10:22.085
I fell for it all, or at least I entertained the possibility of it all.

10:23.035 --> 10:25.758
And in so doing, I got roped in.

10:25.878 --> 10:31.504
I think they thought I would go for it, that I would play the role that these guys are playing on a lower level, of course.

10:33.226 --> 10:34.547
This is all very real.

10:34.587 --> 10:39.353
If you listen to this, this is a scripted, coordinated theater.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.982
It's designed to trap us, ladies and gentlemen.

10:43.002 --> 10:44.443
I don't go into the club.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.365
I don't really think I'm on his radar.

10:46.885 --> 10:48.307
Something tells me you are.

10:48.647 --> 10:48.927
Oh, yeah.

10:49.127 --> 10:50.709
Yeah, something tells me you are.

10:52.630 --> 11:02.099
It's weird that you get lumped into a certain thing, and maybe it's my assumption that his army of healthy fellas

11:05.657 --> 11:06.458
Is that their title?

11:07.018 --> 11:08.519
Army of Healthy Fellas is so good.

11:08.539 --> 11:11.661
No, you just got to, you know, you got to stay and keep the machine.

11:11.681 --> 11:12.682
The machine's got to be good.

11:12.722 --> 11:12.962
Yeah.

11:12.982 --> 11:14.243
That's a shot at Burt.

11:14.283 --> 11:14.584
Go ahead.

11:14.624 --> 11:17.266
What do you think the Austin shelf life is going to be?

11:18.006 --> 11:31.937
I don't advocate that you do watch for these people, but understand that the man that's on the screen right now is partially responsible for RFK's rise in popularity amongst people on the generally central left.

11:32.779 --> 11:45.410
His podcast during 2024 helped promote RFK and his wife to a part of the left that otherwise would not have seen him as possibly an okay guy.

11:46.091 --> 11:48.973
And that podcast is extraordinarily revealing.

11:48.993 --> 11:55.800
Of course, it's evolved now and he's instead doing a podcast with this other dude and they've got graphics and stuff.

11:56.601 --> 12:03.544
but it is governance by a national security theater and they have come to understand podcasts as the way to do it.

12:04.304 --> 12:13.769
And so this is a continuation of the script, albeit changed from where they wanted to be because of course there's been lots of trouble created by the

12:14.529 --> 12:31.083
breadth and depth of the biological information that became available during the pandemic, and they were not able to control the narrative as well as they wanted to, despite having seeded this national security theater narrative about a virus and about a lab leak cover-up.

12:32.104 --> 12:38.770
Now that we are here in 2025, the reason why the script is where it is, is partially because of that.

12:38.871 --> 12:46.497
The ludicrous nature of the lab leak as an explanation has been pretty thoroughly exposed.

12:46.698 --> 12:52.022
Only those people who are still skillfully using social media do not understand this.

12:52.723 --> 12:57.527
But that might be your family and friends, and if so, please, please use this stream

12:58.548 --> 13:17.072
um to help them get out use it as a rope ladder throw it down into the cave and see if we can save a few more people this week and then we're done well i don't know like i i think that it's so effectively tribalized at this point it really comes down to material i mean at what point like at what point

13:17.921 --> 13:34.403
it's like whatever they represented in terms of policy and it's not a stretch it's like they won trans people are frightened they have no ability to get health care anymore and they're afraid of being alive and have no freedom left so that's done when do you stop with the jokes

13:34.884 --> 13:44.496
When immigrants, OK, well, they're being ripped away from their homes and yeah, and they're, you know, and they're all terrified and and OK, so that's done.

13:44.556 --> 13:45.878
When do you stop with the joke?

13:46.018 --> 13:46.519
Right.

13:46.539 --> 13:51.966
I mean, it's one thing to to pick on the vulnerable and the marginalized, but I mean, they're down.

13:54.105 --> 14:04.430
Joe Rogan was one that Marx had a problem with since the early 90s, which is that comedy is supposed to be for the quote-unquote sensitive weirdos, not necessarily for the high school locker room bullies that Joe Rogan's ushered in.

14:19.656 --> 14:24.460
And even though I don't fully agree with this stance, since to me, if you're funny, you're funny.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.182
It is a stance that I've seen other- Now it's interesting, right?

14:27.222 --> 14:33.728
That their paths have been crossing on television and before social media.

14:33.768 --> 14:35.809
That's the most extraordinary thing here.

14:36.550 --> 14:40.393
These people have been in place and on stage for a long time.

14:40.934 --> 14:45.437
The trick is to see that the stage, the stage is now social media.

14:46.338 --> 14:47.159
Welcome to the show.

14:47.239 --> 14:47.999
Thanks for being here.

14:48.019 --> 14:48.680
I'll see you in a minute.

14:50.734 --> 14:54.478
During reconstruction time, there were folks who had been promised 40 acres and a mule.

14:54.598 --> 14:59.643
And they were told that a man with their legal papers could be expected on a train from Washington.

15:00.363 --> 15:04.027
There were folks who waited for him, and there are folks who are still waiting for him.

15:04.868 --> 15:07.110
But you can't depend on the train from Washington.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.111
It's 100 years overdue.

15:22.722 --> 15:45.544
You can't depend on the stars and planets, yeah They'll always tell you the truth You can't depend on the 15th of April, yeah Somehow it always gets through You can't depend on the daily papers, cause They'll sure not bring you the blues

15:47.651 --> 16:10.749
But don't depend on the train from Washington It's 100 years overdue I see people, dragging all they own See them standing, anxious near the tracks I see people, a long, long way from home Wondering how they'll ever get back

16:12.551 --> 16:40.763
You can't depend on the politicians, yeah Always got a point of view They are contemporary court magicians, yeah Slight of mouth will dazzle you You can't depend on a weak position From them changes that you got to go through But don't depend on the train from Washington It's 100 years

16:44.315 --> 16:48.241
I see people on their way to work.

16:48.481 --> 16:51.245
I see factories bursting at the seams.

16:52.447 --> 16:59.497
I see people listening for the whistle on the train that will carry their dreams.

17:33.403 --> 17:37.266
I see people on their way to work.

17:37.507 --> 17:40.629
I see factories bursting at the seams.

17:41.530 --> 17:49.717
I see people listening for the whistle on the train that would carry their dreams.

17:50.357 --> 17:53.580
You can't depend on the force and gravity.

18:06.693 --> 18:20.806
you can't depend on the first two numbers but damn if the last one comes through but don't depend on the train from washington it's 100 years overdue you can't depend

19:02.789 --> 19:06.893
You can't depend on a train from Washington.

19:07.353 --> 19:10.756
Don't you take no for an answer.

19:10.896 --> 19:14.679
You can't depend on a train from Washington.

19:31.181 --> 19:32.742
I think truth is good for kids.

19:33.162 --> 19:37.005
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

19:37.465 --> 19:39.106
We want everybody to feel good.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.427
That's not the way life is.

19:50.123 --> 19:55.768
an agent, agentic AI, the thing that is the new buzzword that everything that used to be an assistant now is.

19:57.350 --> 20:12.884
I think there's a real danger that we're facing, and Signal is clocking this pretty closely, of the introduction of this sort of notion of agentic AI into our devices and lives, in part because what we're doing is

20:13.584 --> 20:18.466
giving so much control to these systems that are going to need access to data.

20:18.506 --> 20:32.450
So if you read the marketing on this, the value add is something like, can look up a concert, book a ticket, schedule it in your calendar, and message all your friends that it's booked.

20:32.630 --> 20:37.631
And so we can just put our brain in a jar, because the thing is doing that, and we don't have to touch it.

20:38.452 --> 20:39.612
So what would it need to do that?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.693
Well, it would need access to our browser,

20:43.703 --> 20:44.884
an ability to drive that.

20:45.284 --> 20:48.285
It would need our credit card information to pay for the tickets.

20:49.186 --> 20:52.787
It would need access to our calendar, everything we're doing, everyone we're meeting.

20:53.708 --> 20:58.570
It would need access to Signal to open and send that message to our friends.

20:59.611 --> 21:05.153
And it would need to be able to drive that across our entire system with something that looks like route permission.

21:06.434 --> 21:12.097
Accessing every single one of those databases probably in the clear, because there's no model to do that encrypted.

21:13.120 --> 21:23.224
And if we're talking about a sufficiently powerful model, AI model that's powering that, there's no way that's happening on device, even though on device isn't a prophylactic, isn't going to really solve a lot of those issues.

21:23.645 --> 21:27.246
That's almost certainly being sent to a cloud server where it's being processed and sent back.

21:28.687 --> 21:35.750
So there's a profound issue with security and privacy that is haunting this sort of hype around agents.

21:36.775 --> 22:04.731
and that is ultimately threatening to break the blood-brain barrier between the application layer and the OS layer by conjoining all of these separate services, muddying their data, and doing things like undermining the privacy of your signal messages because, hey, the agent's got to get in, the agent's got to text your friends, the agent's got to pull the data out of your text and got to summarize that so that, again, your brain can sit in a jar and you're not doing any of that yourself, you're doing something else.

22:05.131 --> 22:14.718
So I think we need to be really careful when I think about the immediate concerns, not simply the history of AI and the fact that it's predicated on this larger surveillance model.

22:15.159 --> 22:28.589
There's a real issue right now of the undermining that AI systems are poised to do in these privacy and security guarantees in the name of this sort of magic genie bot that's going to take care of the exigencies of life.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.892
It's remarkable because what they're talking about essentially is

22:34.495 --> 22:39.298
a glorified, I don't know, cyber secretary, something like that that can book.

22:40.179 --> 22:48.424
I don't even get it other than this is a scripted actor and she is improvising through a script that she's worked on long enough.

22:48.464 --> 22:50.045
I'm not saying she's not smart.

22:50.185 --> 23:00.932
All of these people have to be smart enough to improvise within the script they're given and have past auditions that have gone on for years that they can stay on this script and improvise within it.

23:02.230 --> 23:08.232
can take direction afterward, will go where they're told and perform on stage when they're told.

23:08.332 --> 23:19.174
I mean, this is supposed to be the woman who invented, brought to the market the Signal app that up until very recently has been a big part of my shit life.

23:20.995 --> 23:29.797
But I don't know, a week or so ago, all the last Signal app person connection disappeared from my life.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.083
told me to F off.

23:33.807 --> 23:40.922
And now I'm living in a very different kind of world where I don't have signal at all anymore.

23:42.113 --> 23:43.434
Like it's not doing anything.

23:43.474 --> 24:02.589
The only reason why I have it is because I don't want to delete all those chats that all these people and all this evidence of a network of monkeys that was throwing thoughts around all over the place and misrepresenting the presence of all of these people and on all of our phones.

24:03.610 --> 24:11.637
And so many of us were fooled into believing that we were in a special telegram group or a special signal chat where people were listening to us.

24:12.927 --> 24:17.629
And in retrospect, I'm not sure I ever knew that any of these people were listening to me.

24:18.029 --> 24:32.254
And more importantly, I think what was more likely happening was it was made sure that these people did not know that there was somebody criticizing them, coming behind them and saying that they're wrong or trying to get their attention to correct their course.

24:32.835 --> 24:33.895
But instead they were

24:35.273 --> 24:51.058
in a military fashion protected from criticisms in their own mind, in their own experience, so that they would never have even the challenge of performing in front of an audience that they perceived as aggressive or negative.

24:52.038 --> 25:00.921
And that's my best explanation in my own mind for why at the Brownstone Institute event that happened in Pittsburgh,

25:02.128 --> 25:12.478
Bret Weinstein and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone, all five or six of these people that were there knew who I was.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.760
None of them made eye contact with me.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.884
Bret Weinstein touched my name tag and then walked away.

25:18.944 --> 25:22.807
And so he's even only vaguely aware of who I am.

25:22.847 --> 25:27.311
And I suspect all the time that I spent in that Signal chat thinking I was

25:28.152 --> 25:34.101
I don't know, trying to get through to Brett Weinstein about something big and biological and immunological.

25:34.842 --> 25:39.630
That whole signal chat was being mined and controlled by other people.

25:43.271 --> 25:45.153
And maybe Brett just had a lot of those.

25:45.833 --> 25:53.959
And so he didn't read mine any more than he read the 500 others that were on a phone representing itself as Brett Weinstein.

25:54.500 --> 25:59.484
You know, and when he needed to be on a call that involved that phone, they would just hand it to him.

26:01.966 --> 26:12.234
I want you to think about how with very little money, with very little expense, these people could have three phones.

26:13.519 --> 26:35.224
manned by three staff members who make their presence felt on multiple signal chats, multiple telegram groups, in DMs, on Instagram, and even maybe occasionally on a Zoom meeting by just having a placeholder there, handing them the phone to say something.

26:37.867 --> 26:54.735
This is how the social media would be weaponized if they were doing it without morals, without restriction, to see what is the maximum amount of governance by narrative, governance by podcast, governance by podcast actors is possible.

26:55.996 --> 27:03.119
Because if complete dominance of a civilian population is possible with podcast acting,

27:06.052 --> 27:09.513
That seems like pretty much the safest way to govern a country.

27:10.854 --> 27:19.417
Safest way to hide totalitarianism in a technocratic society where the elite are governing us.

27:19.477 --> 27:22.798
Of course, we are always calling them elites, right?

27:22.878 --> 27:23.618
They're elites.

27:24.879 --> 27:26.620
They're the people with the guns and the money.

27:26.920 --> 27:27.780
They're not elites.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.681
Most of the time, they're actually pretty dumb.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.804
And that's the sort of precarious situation we're in.

27:34.525 --> 27:47.211
We as a society, as a group of societies, as an earth, as a human species, are not governable by a few elites.

27:47.451 --> 27:50.512
We are not governable by a few elites in their banks.

27:52.673 --> 27:57.656
We are only governable by huge illusions of consensus across

27:58.687 --> 28:13.861
multiple sort of spheres of our society and those illusions of consensus have been crafted and molded and gardened and put in place and kept in place and trimmed and sculpted to be where they are right now.

28:15.598 --> 28:20.822
And a lot of the people that participate in that are just going along with the job that they have to do.

28:20.902 --> 28:29.048
And so in order for us to break out, we're going to have to have a multi-generational view of what we're trying to achieve here.

28:30.209 --> 28:44.720
And we are trying to achieve the raising of children that understand that social media as it stands right now is only a weapon, is only a lie, is only a tool to work and use against us.

28:46.863 --> 29:02.497
And it can be as malevolent as convincing our kids that they're gay or trans and don't need to have kids because that's selfish or it's against the, it's gonna create more climate change or something like that.

29:04.579 --> 29:06.301
All the way to the most malevolent.

29:07.486 --> 29:12.267
where families could be ripped apart by a targeted social media campaign.

29:12.387 --> 29:19.129
A kid, for example, could be convinced to show up on a rooftop that maybe somebody is going to meet him there.

29:22.810 --> 29:28.051
And then he will get shot by a national security state that needed that actor dead.

29:31.508 --> 29:45.294
and a national security state that needed America's to have this sort of schizophrenic idea of what we have as a governance right now, as an administration right now, where the rest of the world is just bewildered.

29:48.975 --> 29:53.697
And social media is keeping your family and friends insulated from this fact.

29:53.797 --> 29:58.719
And they actually believe that the truth is getting out about something to do with health freedom.

30:00.066 --> 30:06.095
And if you want to save them, you have to show them how they got trapped by signal, by telegram.

30:06.115 --> 30:12.926
You have to also give them credit for having worked hard enough to get in the trap.

30:14.858 --> 30:29.907
Because part of the reason why you might not be in the trap, why you might not have fallen for Donald Trump, or you might not have fallen for the people around Donald Trump as being patriots is because you might not have been working as hard as other people were to find the truth.

30:30.107 --> 30:43.455
One of the reasons why I lost my job at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine is because I was working hard to find the truth at the beginning and have worked hard continuously for six years.

30:46.280 --> 31:10.594
People who, for pressures of their job or their commitment to their country or whatever they imagined they were doing, might not have worked that hard to try and understand what was going on and may have accepted the 60 Minutes version of it and just buckled down and not argued about it and accepted it, even if there were contradictions occasionally that were comically wrong.

31:12.657 --> 31:14.117
We're just doing our best, you know?

31:14.177 --> 31:17.038
It's kind of sloppy when there are seven billion people on Earth.

31:17.138 --> 31:23.681
This kind of thing is only possible because we have acquiesced to social media.

31:23.721 --> 31:25.561
Otherwise, this would have never happened to us.

31:27.682 --> 31:29.822
Never, ever, ever would it have happened to us.

31:29.903 --> 31:31.143
That's the frustrating part.

31:34.024 --> 31:35.084
It's a bridge.

31:35.104 --> 31:37.425
Just goes around a corner.

31:40.921 --> 31:43.324
It don't it don't go down no don't

32:08.342 --> 32:09.823
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

32:09.863 --> 32:10.663
Welcome to the show.

32:10.723 --> 32:13.065
It's good afternoon here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

32:13.325 --> 32:14.465
It is 1245.

32:15.586 --> 32:17.847
It has been difficult to get shows out.

32:18.748 --> 32:22.990
I have been at the bottom, so to speak.

32:23.891 --> 32:28.073
I feel very much like some of the last sort of

32:30.140 --> 32:33.603
sort of hooks that were in my psyche have been removed.

32:34.604 --> 32:42.210
It has been a very, very tough road having so many people betray me and betray my family.

32:42.250 --> 32:45.953
And it's not just betray, it's really actively lie.

32:46.793 --> 32:53.679
Having people come to your house and pretend is really, it's really something.

32:53.799 --> 32:55.420
And so without the,

32:56.348 --> 33:00.450
the support of my family, I don't even know if I would even be streaming anymore, to be honest.

33:00.850 --> 33:12.174
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

33:12.595 --> 33:15.956
And in fact, they've done the same thing with pandemics and gain of function.

33:16.396 --> 33:25.040
They've created these myths, they've created them over several decades, and now these myths, in a weaponized fashion, are being used against us on social media.

33:25.860 --> 33:30.523
Um, there is no doubt in my mind that social media is how I got fooled.

33:31.063 --> 33:34.705
Participating in a Scooby-Doo mystery on social media.

33:34.765 --> 33:36.966
Everybody telling me that I was on the right track.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.488
Um, they were all lying.

33:39.648 --> 33:45.891
And the only reason why I'm only as far as I've gotten now is because they were all lying together.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.914
And every time I thought I was exposing someone, um...

33:50.894 --> 34:07.033
two or three more would step in and and that's the remarkable thing it's just one giant cast and i don't have anything else to say other than that the last person um the last person that that kind of exposed themselves um

34:08.470 --> 34:13.012
lost their mind in the chat a few days ago, and it's tough.

34:13.112 --> 34:13.872
I don't know what to say.

34:13.912 --> 34:15.493
Don't let the bastards get you down.

34:15.513 --> 34:23.636
I don't want that to happen, but I've had years and years of this now, and it doesn't feel good.

34:24.697 --> 34:35.281
Social media is awful, and I think that's the only reason why I'm starting to recover, because I'm finally able to stay focused, stay focused on the biology,

34:36.121 --> 34:47.454
I really think that social media has been something that has not been friendly and helpful for me and has been used against me pretty awfully.

34:49.056 --> 34:51.819
And so I don't think there's any safe way

34:52.620 --> 35:12.787
to i don't think there's any safe way to stay focused on the biology while trying to engage people on social media and that's what it is i was engaging people on social media and if you are if you are somebody that they want to actively use this fifth generation warfare against you i assure you

35:13.627 --> 35:17.549
that there are stops that you can't even imagine that they can pull.

35:18.690 --> 35:31.996
And there are knobs that they can turn and buttons they can press to make it very, very hard for you or your family to be able to get past it.

35:32.276 --> 35:40.940
And fifth generation warfare is a lot more complicated than Robert Malone explained on the stage in Stockholm, Sweden in January of 2023.

35:42.662 --> 35:48.093
It is an all-encompassing, organized effort to

35:50.970 --> 35:52.231
to tear America apart.

35:53.191 --> 35:54.132
That's what I really think.

35:54.512 --> 35:58.234
And I'm optimistic only because I can see it.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.376
I can see the health freedom movement trapped for what it was.

36:02.797 --> 36:03.557
I fell for it.

36:04.258 --> 36:05.458
I believed in these people.

36:05.498 --> 36:08.260
And now they're going to quietly step off stage.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.081
They're going to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:10.121 --> 36:11.041
take the brunt of it.

36:11.622 --> 36:13.123
Nobody's getting mad at Brian Hooker.

36:13.863 --> 36:22.649
Nobody's getting mad at Andrew Wakefield or Pauly Tommy or any of these people with their big ranches and estates in multiple countries.

36:23.269 --> 36:24.310
Nobody's getting mad at them.

36:26.131 --> 36:31.494
Everybody's getting mad at Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:31.554 --> 36:35.016
and maybe a little bit for the Jay Bhattacharya or something like that.

36:35.036 --> 36:42.461
But there's not really anything substantial happening because you have fallen for a national security theater.

36:43.743 --> 36:48.245
National Security Theater.

36:48.805 --> 36:49.765
It is remarkable.

36:51.566 --> 36:52.486
It is remarkable.

36:52.506 --> 37:05.291
I gotta tell ya, one of the things that has happened over the last four or five days, I actually didn't do it today, I don't know when I'm gonna do it, maybe it'll be at the end of the month, maybe it'll be next week.

37:07.088 --> 37:07.948
I'm pulling the plug.

37:08.728 --> 37:15.330
So putting my money where my mouth is, I am, ooh, I spelled that Wuhan there.

37:15.350 --> 37:20.351
It's supposed to be Wuhan, Wuhan, Wuhan.

37:21.371 --> 37:28.933
The PeerTube app, ladies and gentlemen, and PeerTube as the site, I think is the way to go.

37:29.293 --> 37:31.854
And I want you to start using the app.

37:32.699 --> 37:37.125
Because it plays the best, it's on your phone, it's very easy.

37:37.165 --> 37:39.648
When I put out a new video, it's just gonna be there.

37:39.708 --> 37:46.376
So anytime you're interested in wasting a little time on Gigaohm, you can just open the Peertube app and there it will be.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.779
And if it's the last video you saw, you can skip it.

37:50.020 --> 37:53.842
And come back later, but I don't collect that doesn't collect any data.

37:53.862 --> 38:10.348
It doesn't need any data And so you're just not on social media if you watch me on peer tube And I think that I need to stop making content for YouTube and for rumble and for twitch I just need to stop making that content.

38:11.088 --> 38:13.569
I don't I don't I'm not doing myself any favors.

38:14.249 --> 38:16.790
In fact, what I'm doing is anybody

38:18.900 --> 38:27.486
Anybody that watches my stuff on those platforms is added to their list and all, maybe all of their data is harvested.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.948
And I don't know what Twitch does with the app.

38:30.369 --> 38:32.430
I don't know what YouTube does with their app.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.412
And I don't know what Rumble does with their app.

38:34.852 --> 38:44.319
And so anybody that watches me on any of those platforms is essentially, I guess, feeding their information into the network that I don't think we should be a part of anymore.

38:44.879 --> 38:55.845
And so as difficult as it is, as scary as it is to say, I'm just gonna stop streaming on all those platforms where all of my subscribers have been found, I think I gotta say it.

38:56.805 --> 39:00.047
I think we need to transition off of social media.

39:00.747 --> 39:02.648
I don't need to make a rumble anymore.

39:02.708 --> 39:08.671
There's no reason for me, I haven't gotten not one new subscription on this channel because of rumble.

39:09.051 --> 39:11.032
And it's not because I don't put thumbnails.

39:11.112 --> 39:12.253
It's not because I don't,

39:12.873 --> 39:14.275
I don't change the titles.

39:14.936 --> 39:19.662
It's because Rumble is an absolutely abomination of a platform.

39:20.062 --> 39:22.085
And you can say the same thing about YouTube.

39:22.165 --> 39:29.234
I'm not going to get any more subscribers because I'm live streaming on YouTube because YouTube can just not show people it.

39:32.466 --> 39:35.248
And so the only way this works is brute force.

39:35.548 --> 39:38.650
You just share this with your family and friends.

39:38.690 --> 39:41.632
You just, you hope that this is how you do it.

39:41.992 --> 39:46.515
And I got to tell you, I'm just going to say it right out loud.

39:46.755 --> 39:52.439
I haven't been on in a few days and there's been some concern and I really appreciate the emails and the concern.

39:52.979 --> 39:58.163
And I would flip those emails around and ask you during the days that I've had off,

39:58.803 --> 40:27.785
how many people have downloaded a video or downloaded an audio stream or made a clip using ctrl alt g on your windows machine or window a window g with your with your windows machine and made a clip and and shared it on social media how many people in the last four days have sent an email to a family member saying hey you know i know you're a trump fan maybe you should watch this guy because america might be in big trouble

40:28.703 --> 40:35.226
When's the last time you decided to teach somebody about how intramuscular injection might just be a dumb idea from the 1800s.

40:35.706 --> 40:42.749
And so the whole like the concept of immunization becomes a much more complicated if there might be limited.

40:43.894 --> 41:02.658
kinds of effects and returns from different kinds of immunizations and that intramuscular injection is at the heart of most of the ridiculous toxicities because intramuscular injection has kind of been accepted as the same as subcutaneous, the same as oral.

41:03.278 --> 41:03.959
It's fine.

41:04.279 --> 41:05.539
It's totally fine.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.600
And that concept is so much different.

41:10.523 --> 41:26.085
than anything that's being represented by anyone on the no virus side, anyone on the no pathogen side, anyone on the skeptical side of pathogenic illnesses.

41:27.518 --> 41:31.722
is unable to get far enough to say something as simple as that.

41:31.782 --> 41:50.241
That intramuscular injection is actually just a dumb idea that we accepted as completely okay and logically sound back when we had no idea how our immune system was organized, how it might work, and what relationship it might have to the microbiome.

41:56.343 --> 42:02.508
I mean, this is the kind of show that you would have gotten the other day, except I would have been so much angrier, you can't even imagine.

42:04.949 --> 42:23.303
At some moment in time, it really feels like over and over again, during the entire six years of the pandemic, six years of the pandemic, seven, if you include the 2019, the six years of the pandemic have felt like I have repeatedly been

42:25.653 --> 42:40.420
assaulted, insulted, attacked, backstabbed, and generally speaking, goaded to attack over and over and over again.

42:40.800 --> 42:54.367
I think that maybe one of the things that was supposed to be possible at the Brownstone Institute sort of meeting in Pittsburgh was that I would punch somebody out or I would start screaming at somebody or even worse,

42:58.934 --> 43:23.722
Ladies and gentlemen, social media has been militarized and actors on social media with specific scripts were deployed in 2020 to control a narrative about a novel virus and its evolution in time and space, as well as the evolution of diagnostic tools to follow it, and as well as the evolution of pharmaceutical treatments for it.

43:27.051 --> 43:35.292
So they didn't need to release anything unless they wanted to find it and tell you they found it.

43:37.493 --> 43:54.976
And then they could have released it anywhere they wanted to with extremely high rate of confidence that they themselves, whoever they are, would never be in danger because you can put a lot of DNA somewhere and find it.

43:56.459 --> 44:02.328
It's one of the little things that the Human Genome Project has actually provided to everyone on Earth.

44:02.929 --> 44:10.160
The ability to make a lot of DNA, the ability to find DNA, the ability to sequence DNA if you have enough of it.

44:10.862 --> 44:11.503
That's about it.

44:12.611 --> 44:28.719
And so that biological tool set was manipulated, misrepresented, and the fidelity of which exaggerated to the point where we now believe that there are RNA viruses that can circle the globe in a matter of months.

44:31.092 --> 44:33.834
because of a particular molecular motif.

44:34.014 --> 44:45.522
And that belief is only there because there was a military script distributed, actors in place for decades, ready to be queued up for this theater.

44:50.243 --> 44:56.028
Now, if you really want to understand what's going on, then you have to understand that the theater was quite complex.

44:56.549 --> 45:14.045
It was akin to a Lollapalooza of liars, where there were multiple stages, and some of those stages might have even been contradictory in some ways, in the sense of, you know, there might have been bluegrass over on one, and heavy death metal on the other, and the idea that, wow, that's interesting,

45:14.625 --> 45:26.254
It's hard for me to imagine a festival where there would be such an eclectic group of people that they would want to walk from a death metal concert to a bluegrass concert, but okay, I'll entertain the option.

45:26.555 --> 45:28.797
And that's exactly what they did on the internet.

45:29.517 --> 45:38.024
They provided every genre of variation on this story.

45:38.705 --> 45:41.387
And then those genres were carefully crafted

45:42.662 --> 45:54.331
to fit together in such a way that the sort of illusion would be that there's a mystery to solve about a definitely novel virus, but the question is only where did it come from?

45:57.373 --> 45:58.954
And so it is six years.

46:01.616 --> 46:08.682
We are almost into year seven since this group of people was unleashed on us.

46:10.148 --> 46:20.397
This macabre theater of performing clowns that ranges from Russell Brand and Jessica Rose all the way up to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:20.437 --> 46:21.518
and Jay Bhattacharya.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.241
Ro Khanna.

46:26.723 --> 46:27.564
Thomas Massey.

46:29.304 --> 46:32.386
It's all one malevolent show.

46:32.907 --> 46:53.042
My only question is, are these Indian people that are in front of us now, like Jay Bhattacharya and Ro Khanna and, and that ambassador to India that was with Piper Stover at the beginning of the pandemic, whatever his name was, are all of these people, Indian agents or are they Chinese agents?

46:54.906 --> 46:58.508
Because they're all anti, they all say China's really big.

46:59.049 --> 46:59.489
I don't know.

47:00.289 --> 47:11.457
My guess is, is that in the end, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta believe that India is not really in trouble from a population perspective because of their pyramid.

47:14.579 --> 47:24.345
I kind of have to believe that China might be in a little more trouble because of their pyramid and their one child policy for so long has created a problem for their society.

47:25.948 --> 47:43.918
and a very similar thing existed in Scotland and in the UK and in America and effectively the agreement across nations in 2020 about this pending doom gave any and all administrative groups

47:46.207 --> 48:02.898
the freedom or let's say the opportunity to manage those population pyramid problems any way they wanted to under the pretense of responding to a novel virus that was, I guess, found first in Wuhan.

48:03.678 --> 48:13.365
Now, interestingly enough, a guy that Housatonic Live mentioned a couple of days ago by the name of Michael Osterholm,

48:14.349 --> 48:21.612
who was on Joe Rogan when I was still doing JC on a Bike and I did two JC on a Bikes about his appearance on Joe Rogan.

48:23.733 --> 48:33.297
Michael Osterholm was just on a, I don't think I have the video loaded for this show, was just on a television program not one day ago saying that

48:35.160 --> 48:39.742
that the avian flu, the bird flu, or something like this is coming.

48:40.323 --> 48:41.923
And there's no buts about it.

48:42.404 --> 48:46.726
And that they've actually recently isolated variants in bats again in China.

48:47.766 --> 48:50.188
So they're telling exactly the same story again.

48:50.248 --> 48:55.090
My guess is that the only way that this works is with PCR testing again.

48:56.191 --> 49:02.754
Because unless you get sick and get tested, there's no way to fuel this narrative.

49:02.814 --> 49:03.094
And so

49:05.155 --> 49:13.477
I don't know what to tell you other than the script seems to be doubling down and even on the health freedom movement and the trap that it represented.

49:14.417 --> 49:19.998
If you want to do some background reading, the way to go is the SPARS pandemic document, S-P-A-R-S.

49:21.299 --> 49:30.581
If you go into that document and read about Epigirl, essentially Epigirl is a compound character now, right, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:30.661 --> 49:30.721
and

49:32.221 --> 49:58.127
and all those people they're all basically blowing the whistle on VAERS in the same way and of course you can see the script has now brought VAERS into focus again because the CDC apparently was never paying attention to VAERS or something like that and so this nonsensical script is gonna keep going until this fake populist movement gets face-planted and embarrassed and it will probably involve the

49:59.264 --> 50:13.024
either death of Donald Trump, the corruption of Donald Trump's reputation by admitting or releasing evidence that discredits him, maybe he'll resign.

50:15.187 --> 50:41.001
Who knows what kinds of shenanigans that they will pull I'm sure he won't kill himself So, you know, there are just lots of crazy things that that unfortunately are Probably gonna have to happen in order to keep the masses on social media focused on the script because otherwise the disengagement from social media is inevitable because again, it's not real and

50:42.165 --> 50:51.730
And so unless the dust isn't allowed to settle, people are gonna figure this out very, very, very soon, I think.

50:52.570 --> 51:00.334
And I think we're really one of the only people on the internet that's helping with this right now, but I think the truth is starting to escape.

51:01.414 --> 51:07.277
I have really the feeling that something really wonderful is gonna happen, especially once I get off of social media.

51:08.494 --> 51:14.221
So, of course, on the red side, we have this idea that there are elite pedophiles.

51:15.102 --> 51:16.644
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

51:16.664 --> 51:18.305
We're definitely fighting for something.

51:19.126 --> 51:22.951
But that's why we have to support Trump and we have to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:22.971 --> 51:23.852
We have to believe

51:24.673 --> 51:32.341
that the Q movement is going to come, and that all of these people are going to get arrested, and that Trump is not an elite pedophile.

51:32.381 --> 51:38.167
He just hung out with those people before the real pedophilia started, and he certainly didn't eat any babies.

51:39.269 --> 51:41.071
COVID is definitely real.

51:41.872 --> 51:43.113
It was weird.

51:43.313 --> 51:44.635
Everybody's sure they've had it.

51:44.695 --> 51:45.395
It was strange.

51:46.596 --> 51:50.738
Mary Holland had it for like two days, but it didn't even bother her because she took ivermectin.

51:51.378 --> 51:52.958
Vaccines can work.

51:53.058 --> 51:57.320
It's not about the fact that vaccines don't work or do work.

51:57.360 --> 52:01.081
It's about the fact that sometimes people get hurt by vaccines.

52:01.141 --> 52:04.002
If people would just listen, it would all be clear.

52:04.922 --> 52:09.346
And of course, on the other side, it's not a lab leak, gain-of-function virus, it's Mother Nature.

52:09.726 --> 52:11.868
But humans are actually a plague on the Earth.

52:11.948 --> 52:16.853
I mean, my brother believes that he's doing the right thing by not having kids with his wife.

52:17.633 --> 52:22.658
Because this is about the grandchildren of Earth, and he's not under any obligation to make any grandchildren.

52:23.038 --> 52:28.443
So the culmination of everything wrong with the world is essentially happening right now.

52:29.775 --> 52:36.707
Donald Trump and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and all this stuff in Italy and in Germany.

52:36.747 --> 52:37.909
It's like, it's terrible.

52:38.632 --> 52:43.434
because I guess the elite pedophiles, I don't know, Trump is an elite pedophile.

52:43.454 --> 52:45.195
There are some, I guess, I don't know.

52:45.555 --> 53:00.481
COVID was real, vaccines definitely work, but somehow or another, all big power structures in the world, even in, I guess, the corporate boardroom, are kind of controlled by a combination of blackmail, sex, and drugs, but whatever.

53:01.181 --> 53:07.804
Humans are a plague on earth, so if we could just fix that, everything would be fine, and I want you to see it very differently.

53:09.520 --> 53:16.628
I want you to see this as an opportunity to take a huge burden off the shoulders of your children.

53:17.550 --> 53:22.215
Because right now, our children very much believe that the adults have lost it.

53:24.197 --> 53:26.440
That the adults really don't get it anymore.

53:27.341 --> 53:29.143
That their teachers at school don't get it.

53:30.191 --> 53:48.922
that their parents don't get it because the adults that they see and the models of behavior that they are seeing are overwhelmingly dominated by ridiculous models on social media, ridiculous examples on social media, short videos on social media.

53:53.485 --> 53:56.487
And that's why there's a fake health freedom movement in America.

53:58.263 --> 54:02.244
because there is vaccine harm.

54:03.264 --> 54:12.627
There is immunological and neurological damage after intramuscular injection, especially when there are multiple injections on the same, of course.

54:15.128 --> 54:18.608
But that reality is going to be used against us.

54:18.688 --> 54:27.791
It has already been used against us and weaponized against us because some people in America believe that autism is a real thing caused by these vaccines.

54:28.772 --> 54:38.331
without the specificity of knowledge or depth of understanding to be able to say that intramuscular injection has a hundredfold more likely

54:40.663 --> 54:49.726
contributor to this, and that autism itself is too aspecific of a term at this point to describe the thing that you've been fighting for.

54:49.786 --> 55:06.311
But unfortunately, these people, these actors have been put in place to absorb any parent with the energy to fight, absorb any movement with any grassroots momentum at all, and kill anybody else like Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker.

55:09.830 --> 55:13.371
And that's why Israel vs Gaza is so ridiculous.

55:14.252 --> 55:25.776
That's why Elon and Jeff and Peter and Alex and Mark and Bobby and Donnie are all so very ridiculous.

55:27.096 --> 55:29.737
There's no video of Elon Musk sounding smart.

55:32.523 --> 55:38.945
You know, there's really no video of Jeff Bezos sounding smart either, not even when he was in the car in an interview on 60 Minutes.

55:39.365 --> 55:42.646
There's no video of Peter Thiel sounding smart.

55:43.006 --> 55:49.068
There is, he apparently plays chess well, but Elon Musk says chess is a really dumb and easy game.

55:50.209 --> 55:55.630
I don't know, Mark Zuckerberg, is there a video of him sounding smart?

55:55.670 --> 55:56.270
I don't think so.

55:56.311 --> 55:59.351
I think his character in the movie sounded smarter than he's ever sounded.

55:59.952 --> 56:00.732
Bobby Kennedy?

56:05.146 --> 56:14.255
One side of America thinks Bobby Kennedy is a recovering multiple drug addict womanizing brain worm victim.

56:17.297 --> 56:24.484
The other side of the country thinks that Bobby's been praying for something that Donald Trump is the answer to.

56:30.126 --> 56:33.589
I want to help America and the rest of the world get out of this.

56:33.829 --> 56:48.361
I want the Western world in general that's still watching and connected to the internet to be able to pull their children out of this by breaking Bad Biology 101, evolution because DNA must be unlearned.

56:50.323 --> 56:53.526
We are the victims of a very long con.

56:55.310 --> 57:12.524
And in the 50s and 60s, there were men, mostly men, that thought that it was an inevitability that we would soon have the keys to the church, that we were about to figure out everything.

57:14.385 --> 57:24.513
And that was a gross underestimation of the problem, gross underestimation of the complexity, a gross overstatement of the possible.

57:27.671 --> 57:46.457
in order to justify a sort of shadow totalitarian movement where, you know, a technocracy where at some point in time the people that are the smartest should take control of the evolution of our species or we might miss a turn on the way to immortality.

57:48.098 --> 57:52.500
We might miss a turn on the way to all powerful design capabilities.

57:52.540 --> 57:56.421
We might miss a miss a turn if we're not careful at this point

57:57.827 --> 58:03.010
with the number of humans on Earth, we really need to manage ourselves correctly.

58:04.231 --> 58:07.373
It only takes one generation for this to end.

58:08.833 --> 58:13.856
Just one generation of people like my brother, and suddenly there's only 10,000 kids on Earth.

58:16.158 --> 58:18.359
They have made movies about that possibility.

58:20.700 --> 58:30.248
So bad biology needs to be unlearned and I've been trying to make some safety ladders for people that are the most useful to get people to start climbing.

58:31.009 --> 58:42.278
I think the most useful one to date is that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the 1800s and we have anthropological evidence of it.

58:44.179 --> 58:48.303
We have books in multiple languages

58:50.154 --> 59:01.244
expounding on the great new invention of the hypodermic needle and what it allows physicians to do with substances.

59:02.545 --> 59:09.751
Extremely accurate placement of substances titrated to extremely accurate concentrations.

59:11.880 --> 59:19.925
and it allows the administration and the exposure to substances in ways that will not cause scarring, will not even hurt.

59:22.967 --> 59:31.653
And these advances happening in the late 1800s were all on the background of almost no knowledge at all with regard to our own biology.

59:33.555 --> 59:39.799
No knowledge with regard to what systems we were augmenting, what pathogens we were fighting,

59:40.532 --> 59:45.316
and what the molecular mechanisms of that pathogenicity might be.

59:48.379 --> 59:58.088
At the time, we were improving on the inoculation of people through the scarification of their skin and the rubbing in of pus.

59:59.589 --> 01:00:01.311
We were trying to improve on that.

01:00:04.894 --> 01:00:06.956
Is that not set to play constant here?

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:17.698
And so that's really the trick for me is that we have, come on baby.

01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:25.549
We have really acquiesced to this in a way that it's hard to really express.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:44.691
because we now are six years in and we still have such an adherence to the script that still no one on any side is able to say that this RNA is not new intellectual property, it's not new technology, it's not untested technology.

01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:53.798
It is transfection in a form that is very similar to a form called lipofectamine, which is a product

01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:59.484
that has been used to transfect things on the bench for at least a decade, if not two.

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:17.637
And so the whole show from beginning to end has been about recycling and resetting the intellectual property clock on this transfection technology and people like Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:19.198 --> 01:01:32.550
and Brett Weinstein, all of whom, and Steve Bannon, an intellectual property expert that used to work for none other than Goldman Sachs, and Aaron Seery, a lawyer who used to work for Goldman Sachs.

01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:37.055
They're all part of the same group of people that wants to bring down the FDA.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:50.629
that wants to reset the clock on this intellectual property and open up the supplement industry and take it out from underneath FDA regulation.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.835
And so transfection is a crime because they lie about it.

01:01:58.035 --> 01:01:59.276
They're lying about it now.

01:01:59.356 --> 01:02:04.100
And if they keep calling it an mRNA gene therapy or an mRNA vaccine, they're lying.

01:02:05.475 --> 01:02:08.076
And they have been lying since the beginning.

01:02:08.256 --> 01:02:16.619
And I lost my job at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine for yelling at people about this, for telling them that we're not gonna transfect old people.

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:18.460
That would be ridiculous.

01:02:19.838 --> 01:02:30.645
And most of the time, faculty members at the University of Pittsburgh responded with, they're obviously not the same as the transfection that we use on our bench.

01:02:31.505 --> 01:02:36.068
It's obviously not the same as the stuff that we use in our animals.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:42.312
So RNA cannot pandemic.

01:02:42.332 --> 01:02:47.655
And I think this is another thing where, you know, a wide variety of people that think they know what they're talking about.

01:02:47.716 --> 01:02:48.296
I don't know, like,

01:02:49.099 --> 01:03:05.730
maybe debunk the funk brian dan wilson maybe somebody like i don't know vincent rack and yellow just put this in the chat can you briefly explain how rna can pandemic

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:13.903
Can you explain why DNA wouldn't be a lot better at pandemicing than RNA wouldn't be?

01:03:14.784 --> 01:03:20.870
Can you explain how it is that RNA maintains its fidelity even at a 30,000 base pair length?

01:03:23.172 --> 01:03:26.094
of a coronavirus genome through proofreading.

01:03:26.154 --> 01:03:37.081
Is there any molecular proof of proofreading besides the two papers from Mark Dennison and Ralph Baric that also report that remdesivir interferes with that proofreading?

01:03:37.601 --> 01:03:41.324
What part of RNA cannot pandemic can you refute?

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:47.348
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:04:00.200
just like AIDS was a meaningless set of symptomologies and diseases that included even things like uterine cancer, because people were apparently testing positive with uterine cancer.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.303
Therefore, AIDS can cause uterine cancer.

01:04:07.766 --> 01:04:09.767
I'll give you another one, get my head out of the way.

01:04:09.787 --> 01:04:12.890
A man who thinks he is a woman is not normal.

01:04:13.715 --> 01:04:20.623
The cosmetic transformation, regardless of specific details, results in a transitioned or trans man.

01:04:21.845 --> 01:04:22.586
Ta-da!

01:04:23.467 --> 01:04:25.670
No more problem with, well, how do you define women?

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.193
Because people can't do that.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.243
It's just a semantic game that these people are playing when they don't call it what it was.

01:04:35.803 --> 01:04:39.465
That they don't call it what it was because it's old stuff renamed.

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:44.968
It's just a semantic game when they use the word vaccine over and over and over again.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:51.852
It's just a semantic game when they say that placebo controlled trials are important or they're unethical.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:58.495
It's just a semantic game when they say that we had a pandemic and that pandemics happen.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.072
That one is just brute force.

01:05:03.672 --> 01:05:09.117
Hitting you in the head with something that's not true so often that you guess you believe it's true.

01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:13.742
Hitting you in the head with something so often you believe it's real.

01:05:15.683 --> 01:05:17.965
I'm not saying there are no kids with autism.

01:05:18.025 --> 01:05:21.828
I'm not saying that there are no people that are injured by vaccines.

01:05:21.968 --> 01:05:38.980
I'm saying that their lack of specificity and their inability to hone their messaging, hone their understanding to come to an ever finer scientific understanding of what it is they're fighting for is exactly the reason why you should see that

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:46.873
CHD and ICANN and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:46.913 --> 01:05:47.974
and Jay Bhattacharya.

01:05:48.034 --> 01:05:57.180
None of these people can show you a trajectory of learning, a trajectory of understanding, a trajectory of sharpening their message.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.301
In fact, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:05:59.281 --> 01:06:07.187
's anti-vax message is very similar now as it was in 2015 when Mary Holland first went on Democracy Now!

01:06:07.347 --> 01:06:08.448
opposite Paul Offit.

01:06:08.768 --> 01:06:10.469
And that same schtick

01:06:10.909 --> 01:06:18.855
That same set of actors has been present in front of us for the next 10 years straight.

01:06:20.296 --> 01:06:24.478
And they've never made the progress that anyone should have made.

01:06:24.959 --> 01:06:29.242
25 years, says Sherry Tenpenny, and 17 hours a day.

01:06:30.462 --> 01:06:32.784
She hasn't made any progress with all that work.

01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:51.650
And after all this time, all these conservative people are unable to see through the simple semantic trick that instead of calling a biological male who transitions to being a female, a trans woman, you call him a trans man.

01:06:53.812 --> 01:06:54.552
And it's all done.

01:06:55.953 --> 01:07:02.598
And there's no semantics, there's no game to be played, there's no argument to be had, but just the illusion of consensus

01:07:03.772 --> 01:07:07.856
that a man that believes he's a woman can be a trans woman.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:17.265
That illusion of consensus about that language is powerful enough to confuse a planet full of social media users.

01:07:17.385 --> 01:07:29.356
Understand that, that the illusion of consensus around what a trans man and a trans woman are,

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:39.516
And the illusion of consensus is, is that a man transitioning to cosmetically appear as a woman is now a trans woman.

01:07:39.996 --> 01:07:49.240
That's an agreement that all of these people somehow or another seem to be under and can't seem to see that, no, it's really just a mistake.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.061
We should just call those people trans men.

01:07:51.522 --> 01:07:52.182
And then it's fine.

01:07:53.183 --> 01:07:54.304
They want to dress like that.

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:55.865
They want to get all those operations.

01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:56.685
They're just trans men.

01:07:56.725 --> 01:07:57.145
It's cool.

01:07:57.926 --> 01:08:00.428
And then we can have all the equal rights they want to.

01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:06.912
And we can still protect our daughters and call our daughters what they are.

01:08:07.432 --> 01:08:12.155
And we can still cherish our, our wives, our spouses.

01:08:14.844 --> 01:08:25.327
We can still love the female form and all of its beauty and never be challenged by this nonsense if we just simply don't accept their language as they give it to us.

01:08:27.268 --> 01:08:31.509
Stop arguing about vaccines because it's intramuscular injection that's dumb.

01:08:33.638 --> 01:08:41.122
And you will find that most nurses take the easy way out and give an intramuscular injection for everything that they shoot.

01:08:41.902 --> 01:08:54.388
Even if it says you should do it subcutaneously, they'll do it intramuscular anyway, because the indications on the paper say that it's so, and the assumption across the professional field is definitely that it's so.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:02.652
This is a mistake that we are gonna make for generations to come if we don't wake up our kids now.

01:09:03.865 --> 01:09:11.070
If we don't pull them off of social media now, they will be enslaved and they will be inverted into experimental animals.

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:11.910
That's for sure.

01:09:14.992 --> 01:09:31.984
And so, social media is best described as a situation where you think that with the right tweet or the right Facebook posts, you can change what happens on the Star Trek Enterprise.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:41.023
You are being led to believe that if I just turn around and say, hey, captain, I've got everything under control.

01:09:41.163 --> 01:09:42.244
No problem, thanks.

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:45.425
You can go back down to engineering and check on the warp drive.

01:09:49.807 --> 01:09:56.050
And so with coordinated scripts, it can look very similar to as if that guy is responding to me.

01:09:58.011 --> 01:10:00.012
And that's what they're doing on social media.

01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:02.993
That's what they did to us during the pandemic.

01:10:03.922 --> 01:10:05.823
got us running in all different directions.

01:10:05.923 --> 01:10:09.025
And on social media, we thought we could change the story, but we couldn't.

01:10:09.065 --> 01:10:12.247
The story was already set in stone by the population pyramid.

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:13.948
And this line isn't level.

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:21.793
They just swept a few people together, killed a few old folks, and they killed a few people with protocols, and here you have it.

01:10:21.833 --> 01:10:24.934
Because three million people die in America every year.

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:28.657
And so they needed to lie about how some of those people died.

01:10:29.117 --> 01:10:30.558
Maybe even this peak,

01:10:31.809 --> 01:10:48.691
which is missing right here in 2019 is them sparing no expense in 2019 to keep a few more extra people alive so that when this spike hit, it would hit and be able to be shown on the television screen as something more dramatic than it was.

01:10:49.707 --> 01:11:04.019
And of course, the murder and lies in America that was misconstrued as a mismanaged response to the pandemic because Donald Trump is a clown was portrayed around the world as evidence for why their lockdowns worked or why their lockdowns should be enforced.

01:11:11.665 --> 01:11:17.550
And so there's an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals associated with the bacteria and archaea

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:27.163
in the background and quite simply using PCR to find something on that background with a single set of primers and a probe is ridiculous.

01:11:27.963 --> 01:11:41.248
Instead, what you need to realize is that already back when I was in high school in the 90s, you could see this bump in the population pyramid that was going to be responsible for the absolute increase in the number of people at the top of the pyramid.

01:11:41.288 --> 01:11:45.790
And the number of people at the top of the pyramid are the people who are dying, mostly.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:53.834
And so as this bump goes to the top, you can see that these lines at the top are all getting wider.

01:11:54.735 --> 01:12:00.200
These lines right here are all getting wider, wider than they've ever been, going from 2 million to 4 million.

01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:08.987
And so that means twice as many old people are available to die on Medicare and Medicaid than were available 10 years ago.

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:14.881
And that number looks to be likely to increase over the next 10 years.

01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:19.849
And so public health, as I see it, becomes a way of managing this problem.

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:34.956
Careful orchestration of protocols, careful orchestration of narratives around pandemic viruses can give all these countries the excuse to manage their pyramid by just tweaking a few knobs so that a few more people die.

01:12:35.657 --> 01:12:41.421
And at the same time, of course, we've created a whole remnant stream based on those PCR tests

01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:46.446
that is the dream of the Human Genome Project.

01:12:46.606 --> 01:12:54.530
And of course, it would have been the dream of the Human Genome Project 20 years ago, but we didn't have the infrastructure or technology to sequence all of that data anyway.

01:12:56.451 --> 01:13:03.014
And so an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was sculpting using murder and lies and a bunch of liars on the internet.

01:13:04.736 --> 01:13:15.985
And a big part of this was the opioid epidemic in America that killed about a half a million people that are not acknowledged and certainly not subtracted from this mystery virus totals.

01:13:17.206 --> 01:13:27.675
And the biggest effect of the opioid crisis in America has been the reduction in life expectancy, which curiously enough, all of these people are scripted to not understand.

01:13:29.835 --> 01:13:42.600
as if all these math geniuses that claim to be epidemiologists and computational biologists can't figure out that if you kill people under 40 and you kill a lot of them, that might reduce the life expectancy of a population.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:52.104
And since that's exactly what happened with opioids, it's odd that so many people have mentioned it and insisted that it's not that, you know, like all of them.

01:13:55.686 --> 01:14:01.230
So unfortunately, anybody that's risen into clear view is a scripted need-to-know basis actor.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:05.293
I don't think you need to see it as more complicated than that.

01:14:06.494 --> 01:14:07.956
You basically sign at the line.

01:14:08.136 --> 01:14:12.919
And so a key aspect of our governance is the use of scripted actors on podcasts.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.922
Social media has been militarized using podcast actors.

01:14:16.942 --> 01:14:19.264
That's the best way to see it, in my opinion.

01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:25.129
And podcast actors are therefore used to define and curate narrative spaces like pandemics, public health,

01:14:25.609 --> 01:14:35.521
climate change, religion, morality, parental rights and responsibilities, relevant threats to our democracy, and what it means to be liberal or conservative.

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:40.487
All of these things now are under the control of podcast actors, and it's very effective.

01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:44.112
The only question is, can we save our children from it?

01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:47.953
because elections don't matter.

01:14:48.554 --> 01:14:51.155
Elections are not under our control.

01:14:51.215 --> 01:14:53.917
Election fraud is an issue they want us to fight about.

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:57.439
These people are all allowed to win.

01:14:57.479 --> 01:15:02.882
They've passed their auditions long, long ago, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:02.942 --> 01:15:04.863
passed his audition long, long ago.

01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.705
He's just a scripted actor.

01:15:07.745 --> 01:15:09.746
He's not smart enough to know how he's being used.

01:15:09.786 --> 01:15:11.707
He just wants whatever he wants.

01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:12.368
Despite COVID.

01:15:13.479 --> 01:15:16.482
which was a very unfortunate situation for the whole world.

01:15:16.522 --> 01:15:17.783
We did a great job with it.

01:15:17.803 --> 01:15:19.905
Never got the credit for the job we did.

01:15:20.585 --> 01:15:29.633
Operation Warp Speed, people say, is one of the greatest achievements ever in politics or in the military, because it was almost a military procedure.

01:15:30.455 --> 01:15:32.316
But everybody.

01:15:32.857 --> 01:15:37.800
And so supposedly, this is a real guy with, you know, a real staff and a real administration.

01:15:38.521 --> 01:15:41.884
And they're a real administration that's under his control.

01:15:41.984 --> 01:15:43.345
He's making decisions.

01:15:43.965 --> 01:15:45.686
You know, he's signing all the papers.

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:49.729
And for now, I guess it's just Donald Trump.

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:51.451
And we're stuck with him.

01:15:52.151 --> 01:15:57.015
And all of the people on the left that are scripted are scripted to say that.

01:15:58.055 --> 01:16:07.223
It couldn't be that he's controlled by people behind the scenes or behind him or above him, or that he's controlled by the same people that Biden or Harris would have been controlled by.

01:16:07.704 --> 01:16:08.744
That would be crazy.

01:16:11.147 --> 01:16:17.072
And so we are on the right, on the right are people on the right are believing that this is a real woman.

01:16:18.049 --> 01:16:28.952
that she's a real person who's trying to save America and act as a patriotic director of national intelligence by producing videos from her car and a seatbelt.

01:16:33.553 --> 01:16:41.775
Now, what I would like to show you is that this entire theater is inverted and used against us all around the world.

01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:49.761
And I could show you German or I could show you Dutch, but that's not very easy for me, especially German, but Dutch I could translate.

01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:51.043
It's still not a nice show.

01:16:51.504 --> 01:16:53.787
So I thought I'd show you what they're doing in Australia.

01:16:56.207 --> 01:16:57.028
Welcome to Planet America.

01:16:57.068 --> 01:16:59.029
Here in the Situation Room, I'm John Baer.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:07.876
So this is a show called Planet America, and they're in the Situation Room, and they're going to tell us all about what's happening in America, because it's Planet America.

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:10.839
Yes, we've got another situation.

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:15.182
Breaking news out of the CDC, where top officials are resigning en masse.

01:17:15.202 --> 01:17:19.786
CDC director Susan Menard has been ousted from her position just weeks into the job.

01:17:19.946 --> 01:17:24.648
Vaccine policy is changing quickly under HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:17:24.748 --> 01:17:26.989
Science will be contaminated by ideology.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:34.531
Chaos and confusion at the Centers for Disease Control while Health Secretary Bobby Kennedy continues to stoke fears about vaccines.

01:17:34.711 --> 01:17:38.273
And the plot thickens following the FBI raids on John Bolton.

01:17:38.753 --> 01:17:40.634
Might he have some questions to answer?

01:17:40.654 --> 01:17:41.534
But first...

01:17:44.138 --> 01:17:47.402
Global trade has been thrown into turmoil again.

01:17:47.803 --> 01:17:54.732
Just moments ago, actually, a federal appeals court ruled most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal.

01:17:55.509 --> 01:17:59.673
The court is saying the president exceeded his authority in imposing those levies.

01:17:59.993 --> 01:18:07.479
The majority found the power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch.

01:18:07.779 --> 01:18:08.440
It's up to the U.S.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.061
Congress, not the president.

01:18:10.402 --> 01:18:13.744
President Trump's reaction was about what you'd expect.

01:18:14.105 --> 01:18:20.290
If allowed to stand, this decision would literally destroy the United States of America.

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:21.171
Literally.

01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:23.893
But he also had this piece of reassurance.

01:18:24.372 --> 01:18:26.573
Our tariffs are still in effect.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:33.437
And they are, at least until mid-October, to give Trump time to appeal against this defeat to the US Supreme Court.

01:18:33.877 --> 01:18:38.780
The lawyer who argued this case says it is clear Trump exceeded his powers.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.241
The court overwhelmingly today in a 7-4 decision

01:18:42.402 --> 01:18:50.169
rejected President Trump's notion that he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and have said, no, the Constitution imposes limits.

01:18:50.429 --> 01:18:55.053
And one really important limit, Mr. President, is you're not allowed to tariff on your own.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:06.209
And the stakes for Trump are high, with his tariffs expected to bring in $500 billion or more a year in revenue from American taxpayers to the US government.

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:08.551
At least that's what Treasurer Scott Besant tells us.

01:19:09.371 --> 01:19:13.695
But to be clear, this ruling does not apply to all of Trump's tariffs.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:24.322
It's mostly about the so-called Liberation Day tariffs that Trump imposed back in April on all the countries of the world, as well as Trump's tariffs this year on Mexico, Canada and China.

01:19:24.622 --> 01:19:31.646
So what that means is Trump's sector-specific tariffs on silicon chips, steel, aluminium, they'll be unaffected.

01:19:31.986 --> 01:19:36.089
Trump's tariffs on China from his first term, they'll also be unaffected.

01:19:36.209 --> 01:19:41.490
And these new tariffs on online sales worth $800 or less, they'll be unaffected as well.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:50.792
Basically, if this ruling holds up, Trump's tariffs will go from affecting 69% of America's imports to 16% public health in America.

01:19:51.072 --> 01:20:04.595
Well, I'm terribly worried, John, that what we're seeing in the United States is really a dismantling of an incredibly important leadership role on public health, both in this country and across the globe.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:14.127
and the departure of the incredibly talented leaders at CDC are just the next blow along the way.

01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:22.054
So the budget for that critical public health agency has already been cut by about 40%.

01:20:23.395 --> 01:20:34.484
And so they think that we're supposed to believe that the CDC is such a vital organization and that those people have dedicated their careers to that organization because of a disagreement

01:20:35.084 --> 01:20:48.029
or because of solidarity with somebody who used to work for ARPA-H, they've decided to resign and leave the entire structure of the CDC open for appointment for, I don't know, anybody that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:48.049 --> 01:20:49.450
wants to appoint in their place.

01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:53.552
It doesn't really seem like they believe what they say.

01:20:54.457 --> 01:21:08.205
It's kind of like, I don't know, an anti-vaxxer who says that the RNA shots are contaminated with DNA, but I'm just gonna, you know, go on with my life and not worry about that anymore because whatever.

01:21:09.205 --> 01:21:13.287
When I need to be on a podcast and say that there's DNA in the shots, I can do that.

01:21:13.307 --> 01:21:15.749
But otherwise I got businesses to run, you know.

01:21:17.369 --> 01:21:27.235
So I don't understand how somebody can believe that three prominent leaders at an organization would resign in solidarity with somebody who was asked to resign.

01:21:27.955 --> 01:21:36.060
And that would be a way of solving a problem at what they also say is a vital organization to the United States and the world.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:45.447
It's like, yeah, it's really important what I'm doing in this car, because if I don't hold my stands on this steering wheel, we'll crash into a telephone pole in less than 10 seconds.

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:51.391
And as soon as somebody says something wrong and you disagree with them, you're like, okay, whatever, I'm gonna take my hands off the wheel.

01:21:51.892 --> 01:21:55.875
If it's not important to you guys, it's not important to me either, and walk away.

01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:03.832
That it's just the most remarkably stupid story I've ever heard.

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:11.154
And yet it's being told on every major newscast in a lot of different languages in the Western world right now.

01:22:12.515 --> 01:22:18.417
It's such a dumb story that it's hard for me to believe that any thinking adult human would believe it.

01:22:19.197 --> 01:22:23.358
Except there's a consensus on the internet that that's exactly what's happening.

01:22:24.485 --> 01:22:28.306
And the consensus spans all of the internet.

01:22:28.406 --> 01:22:32.468
It spans all of the news programs, even across languages.

01:22:34.248 --> 01:22:38.629
Staff members have been fired and let go across the board.

01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:52.734
We have withdrawn our leadership role in world health by dismantling USAID, by threatening to leave the World Health Organization and the CDC.

01:22:53.596 --> 01:22:59.597
led the delegation of the United States members to the World Health Organization.

01:22:59.657 --> 01:23:04.078
We are not going to participate in world discussions on vaccines.

01:23:04.158 --> 01:23:09.219
We've slashed the budgets for vaccine research and development.

01:23:09.899 --> 01:23:15.921
So we now have a real collapse of the whole leadership team at.

01:23:16.101 --> 01:23:21.802
But of course, one of the things that you see here, and I think somebody in the chat sees it,

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:34.358
The left needs to forgive themselves for how they went all in on lockdowns and masks and all this other stuff.

01:23:35.258 --> 01:23:37.820
They need to be able to erase 2021.

01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:43.765
And in order to do that, they need to protect the CDC.

01:23:43.805 --> 01:23:45.726
They need to stand up for the CDC.

01:23:46.126 --> 01:23:47.908
They need to stand up for NIH.

01:23:47.948 --> 01:23:50.510
They need to stand up for HHS.

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:53.332
Even though they understand that at the time,

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:01.084
the beginning of the pandemic, those were the exact same organizations that they were against because Donald Trump was in the White House.

01:24:01.924 --> 01:24:16.412
That's the cognitive dissonance that they have to heal by taking the side of, oh my gosh, I mean, it's just as malevolent a mental trap as the people who believe that Donald Trump and

01:24:16.832 --> 01:24:22.597
You know, Alex Jones and all these other imperfect people are really coming to our rescue as patriots.

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.458
I mean, that's all the same.

01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:30.643
You're accepting a certain amount of nonsense, but it feels better to you.

01:24:31.504 --> 01:24:34.006
And she's exhibiting it right here.

01:24:35.066 --> 01:24:47.295
where the absolute ridiculousness of Donald Trump makes it easier to accept the CDC as a lesser of two hells than the other way around.

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:51.098
And the same trick is applied over and over and over again.

01:24:51.818 --> 01:24:53.339
The Centers for Disease Control.

01:24:53.399 --> 01:24:54.140
And I think it is

01:24:54.994 --> 01:25:03.780
threatening the welfare of the health of American children, American families, but also the health of people across the globe.

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:12.186
Governor, these newly appointed members of the Vaccine Advisory Panel to the centers are causing a lot of concern within the centers, reportedly.

01:25:12.366 --> 01:25:19.831
So even in Australia, they're talking to American actors, improvising on a script about the ACIP.

01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:24.054
And of course, this would be Retsit Levy and Robert Malone.

01:25:25.215 --> 01:25:41.715
and Martin Kulldorff, the same scripted actors that were put in front of us at the beginning of the pandemic as fake dissidents, the same group of actors that was in front of us at at doctors meetings like medical doctors for COVID ethics or panda presentations.

01:25:42.156 --> 01:25:44.138
And they have rumble channels and they were

01:25:44.578 --> 01:25:46.339
on all of these different podcasts.

01:25:46.379 --> 01:25:52.202
And they also testified in front of that CIC in Germany with the lady with the barrette.

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:56.003
And so it's all one coordinated scripted show.

01:25:56.063 --> 01:26:08.789
Some of these people have flown down to Australia to testify before their Senate and others of them have been to UK or been in front of the, in some room in the EU parliament, or maybe they went to Japan for the sixth international COVID summit.

01:26:09.209 --> 01:26:12.491
And now for some reason or another, somebody like Robert Malone,

01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:17.015
is being indirectly referenced even on international news television.

01:26:19.538 --> 01:26:36.574
It's because they are scripted national security actors being used against mostly the American population, but effectively using the smaller populations and the smaller presence of these other Western nations and populations on the internet against us.

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:39.180
Because that's what happens too.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:49.486
All of these posts and all of these opinions from these other countries can be put in our feeds as well to create an illusion of consensus that spans the globe.

01:26:50.727 --> 01:26:55.830
And that illusion of consensus that spans the globe is that America's government is out of our control.

01:26:56.290 --> 01:27:06.857
American populace is retarded and that very soon we're just going to have to dissolve the United States because you know, they're financially insolvent anyway.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:19.829
Are we really in a situation where essentially unqualified people with fringe, unscientific views are going to limit access to vaccines?

01:27:20.389 --> 01:27:37.074
Well, your description of some of the members of the advisory panel also, I think, applied directly to the current Secretary of Health and Human Services, a person who has no scientific background, has no medical degree, has lots of

01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:44.706
frequently disputed fringe theories, which he cites on a regular basis.

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:56.929
And he has handpicked a group of people, many of whom are his devotees, to be on the Vaccine Advisory Commission.

01:27:57.049 --> 01:28:08.312
And it's a very dangerous combination, where rather than choosing people for their scientific expertise, for their vaccine knowledge, for their research knowledge, for their peer

01:28:10.054 --> 01:28:13.675
It's the entire internet.

01:28:14.855 --> 01:28:16.236
It's the entire internet.

01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:19.697
It's all gone south.

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:28.619
If you're watching conservative social media, you are completely unaware that the rest of America has written you off.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:39.851
As a fool, as a snake oil buyer, you believe in a heroin addict that has half a brain because the other half was eaten by a worm.

01:28:40.412 --> 01:28:44.355
You believe in a womanizing fraud named Donald Trump.

01:28:45.433 --> 01:28:50.674
And it is going really, really south, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:51.675 --> 01:28:58.616
American conservatives need to wake up that something has been done that's misrepresenting us.

01:28:58.756 --> 01:29:04.478
Because make no mistake about this, there is no conservative movement in America.

01:29:04.518 --> 01:29:14.180
The conservative movement, the populist right that is headed by Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, it only exists on the internet.

01:29:16.539 --> 01:29:20.640
Even the people that have signs in their yard are ordering those signs on the internet.

01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:22.120
They're not making them on their own.

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:27.381
This is not a grassroots movement.

01:29:27.441 --> 01:29:28.422
It doesn't exist.

01:29:28.562 --> 01:29:30.822
It's only on social media.

01:29:31.362 --> 01:29:39.484
If you stop reading Substack and delete X on your phone, there will be no social media movement called the right.

01:29:40.643 --> 01:29:42.664
There will be no conservative right.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:30:03.276
There will be no nationalist Christian right that only exists on and because of social media, because of the illusion of consensus that is actively created on both sides about its existence by scripted actors on social media.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:10.264
The conservative right in America does not exist except for on social media and it is sustained.

01:30:10.764 --> 01:30:18.048
Its existence is defined by the illusion of consensus created by scripted actors on social media.

01:30:18.128 --> 01:30:19.029
Do you hear me?

01:30:28.559 --> 01:30:31.361
at the beach, and yet... I am at the beach.

01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:32.021
Oh, you are?

01:30:32.181 --> 01:30:35.243
Well, you're at the beach, but you're in your office at the beach.

01:30:35.303 --> 01:30:37.384
I will walk out to the beach, yes.

01:30:37.444 --> 01:30:40.046
All right, you should be on the beach, is my point.

01:30:40.586 --> 01:30:47.030
But what's going on at the CDC and the dismantling of America's public health apparatus?

01:30:47.470 --> 01:31:12.451
Seems so Urgent and so of course one of the tricks they're playing on us is always having somebody with an English accent in the mix Always have somebody with a foreign accent in the mix and curiously enough They have used some of these American actors on those other populations By having them, you know speak on those on those platforms as well like GB news and that kind of thing.

01:31:12.471 --> 01:31:12.491
I

01:31:14.278 --> 01:31:15.840
But they know how well this works.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.782
Trust me, they know how well this works.

01:31:19.123 --> 01:31:31.456
Important that we decided we would do an emergency episode of Inside Trump's Head to find out what's going on inside Trump's head and where he is about RFK Jr.

01:31:32.031 --> 01:31:36.916
Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's just been an extraordinary 24 hours.

01:31:39.919 --> 01:31:50.591
Now remember, what I want you to pay attention to is that the assumption on the left, and this is the left, even though I have it in yellow, the assumption is that Donald Trump is a free actor.

01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:54.610
that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:57.331
after being appointed is a free actor.

01:31:57.811 --> 01:31:59.172
He has no advisors.

01:31:59.572 --> 01:32:01.112
He's got nobody behind him.

01:32:01.472 --> 01:32:02.872
He's got no controllers.

01:32:02.912 --> 01:32:04.133
He's got no funders.

01:32:04.193 --> 01:32:05.653
He's got no influencers.

01:32:06.073 --> 01:32:07.273
He's doing it.

01:32:09.254 --> 01:32:11.835
Donald Trump is playing 5D chess.

01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:13.295
You see, they believe that too.

01:32:14.574 --> 01:32:16.436
It's just that they don't think it's 5D chess.

01:32:16.456 --> 01:32:22.061
They think it's like some kind of totalitarian attempt to ruin America or something like that.

01:32:22.461 --> 01:32:26.625
But again, they attribute agency to Donald Trump.

01:32:26.685 --> 01:32:33.490
They attribute agency to the Secretary of Defense.

01:32:33.531 --> 01:32:36.693
They attribute agency to Jay Bhattacharya.

01:32:37.114 --> 01:32:38.255
And that's just absurd.

01:32:39.867 --> 01:32:42.648
And attributing agency to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:32:42.728 --> 01:32:43.929
is also absurd.

01:32:44.369 --> 01:32:47.991
And yet, curiously enough, these people do that.

01:32:48.211 --> 01:32:49.571
And that's because they're scripted.

01:32:49.591 --> 01:32:50.772
It's not because they're dumb.

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:55.514
It's not because they don't know that there must be people behind these actors.

01:32:55.574 --> 01:32:57.075
It's because they are scripted.

01:32:59.236 --> 01:33:04.458
And we are seeing this, the emergence of RFK Jr.

01:33:04.698 --> 01:33:08.100
as, you know, one of the most significant powers in the country.

01:33:08.755 --> 01:33:09.839
And one of the most dangerous.

01:33:09.939 --> 01:33:10.581
Come on.

01:33:10.802 --> 01:33:11.986
One of the most dangerous.

01:33:12.287 --> 01:33:15.015
And also potentially one of Trump's successors.

01:33:15.367 --> 01:33:21.591
And I also see this as a kind of Trump is in a bit of a squeeze here.

01:33:21.712 --> 01:33:24.894
So this is what's going on in Trump's mind.

01:33:24.994 --> 01:33:30.698
I do definitely see Trump as thinking, God, I'm stuck with this nutcase.

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:37.623
And I'm stuck with this nutcase because the vaxxers are nuts.

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:43.227
And I'm making my accommodation.

01:33:43.867 --> 01:33:44.868
RFK Jr.

01:33:45.588 --> 01:33:47.710
covers me with the Vaxxers.

01:33:48.230 --> 01:33:49.511
Wow, the Vaxxers.

01:33:49.571 --> 01:33:50.572
So he says it wrong.

01:33:50.652 --> 01:33:52.453
It's anti-Vaxxers, not Vaxxers.

01:33:53.254 --> 01:34:09.906
And he here says that Donald Trump just took Bobby Kennedy to get more votes, to get this part of the health freedom movement, which is not that dissimilar from saying that Steve Bannon and Aaron Siri and ICANN and

01:34:10.606 --> 01:34:30.434
Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield are all part of an elaborate hoax to make sure that the health freedom movement in America would always be under their control and would always be a trap for conservatives with enough gumption to take action.

01:34:31.877 --> 01:34:55.267
So that anybody that tried like I did to, to try and figure out what was going on and join the winning team, I would end up being inevitably behind somebody like Mary Holland or somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is exactly where I found myself and exactly why I'm in his book as a, as an, in the acknowledgements page as an expert without which the book would have been, would not have been possible.

01:34:58.413 --> 01:35:06.476
I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, there aren't very many people like me in America that can actually and are blowing the whistle on this fraud.

01:35:07.836 --> 01:35:16.199
These people aren't blowing the whistle on anything because they still attribute all the agency to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:16.239 --> 01:35:18.920
and Jay Bhattacharya and Elon Musk.

01:35:20.161 --> 01:35:20.761
Come on.

01:35:21.241 --> 01:35:23.462
So Trump has had a very busy week.

01:35:24.282 --> 01:35:26.523
Inside his head, it must be very kind of

01:35:27.418 --> 01:35:42.130
frantic because he's gone from Putin to Ghislaine and releasing the Ghislaine tapes and being squeezed by the notion of giving her a pardon to now what appears to be the collapse of America's public health system.

01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:49.015
Well, that's the kind of chaos which actually he's used to and I think that he likes and that he thrives on.

01:35:49.616 --> 01:35:51.217
OK, Michael, let's do it.

01:35:51.277 --> 01:35:56.021
Let's take a journey together arm in arm inside Trump's head.

01:36:00.529 --> 01:36:06.352
Michael, I mean, America's public health apparatus appears to be on fire.

01:36:07.113 --> 01:36:11.095
The arsonist is RFK Jr.

01:36:12.036 --> 01:36:20.821
I just can't understand why Donald Trump put him, a man with zero medical qualifications, into this job.

01:36:20.881 --> 01:36:25.063
And he seems to be sowing his vaccine skepticism.

01:36:25.164 --> 01:36:25.804
We've got the

01:36:26.677 --> 01:36:34.904
head of the CDC leaving, we've got scientific experts leaving, we've got expert panels collapsing.

01:36:35.244 --> 01:36:39.047
Why did Donald Trump put RFK Jr.

01:36:39.147 --> 01:36:39.928
in this job?

01:36:40.168 --> 01:36:46.733
I don't think we should express surprise that Donald Trump would put any incompetent in any job.

01:36:47.854 --> 01:36:50.296
The administration is filled with them.

01:36:50.476 --> 01:36:52.878
Actually, that seems to be a requirement.

01:36:53.448 --> 01:36:56.789
but this seems really dangerous, a really dangerous one.

01:36:56.829 --> 01:36:59.210
I guess they're all dangerous.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.971
They're all dangerous.

01:37:01.011 --> 01:37:11.494
Yeah, I mean, this seems more personally dangerous because it really relates to the health of the people, to our own health or the health of the people.

01:37:11.794 --> 01:37:15.636
Now, the next example I want to show you is from PBS News yesterday.

01:37:15.656 --> 01:37:22.118
And what I want you to see very specifically is that PBS News is promoting Substack,

01:37:23.659 --> 01:37:29.721
as a news source, as a website, as a way for adjunct professors to make a living.

01:37:31.842 --> 01:37:41.806
And if you pay a close attention to PBS NewsHour, supposedly a kind of, you know, middle of the road, centrist left, whatever it is, obviously it's nonsense.

01:37:42.386 --> 01:37:48.849
But when you see it for what it is, they promote exactly the same thing that the people on our side promote.

01:37:49.793 --> 01:37:54.955
Kim Iverson promotes Rumble and Substack authors and ex-posts.

01:37:56.476 --> 01:38:01.338
And the only thing that PBS NewsHour hasn't overtly done is promote Rumble.

01:38:02.379 --> 01:38:09.062
They have definitely, repeatedly, and often on a weekly, if not daily basis, promote Substack journalism.

01:38:10.502 --> 01:38:13.944
And that is a Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, et cetera.

01:38:14.524 --> 01:38:17.826
Substack is a AI feeding

01:38:19.537 --> 01:38:34.291
Platform, the text that you write there is fed into the algorithm, not that any different than how all the text of the short posts of Twitter was fed into chatbots as a way of instructing them and teaching them.

01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:39.265
We have trained these chatbots ourselves.

01:38:39.825 --> 01:38:41.346
They have been trained on us.

01:38:42.047 --> 01:38:52.554
And these people may be woefully unaware of how they're being used and played by the Trump administration, just in the same way that we were woefully unaware.

01:38:52.754 --> 01:38:58.958
And many people have been woefully unaware of how Donald Trump and Steve Bannon and all these people are playing them.

01:39:00.854 --> 01:39:05.058
These people are played justice badly because they think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:05.298 --> 01:39:10.744
is an actor, a guy with agency, and a plan, and a devious one.

01:39:13.183 --> 01:39:16.025
or they are scripted to say that and either way it's wrong.

01:39:16.045 --> 01:39:19.287
Get the newest COVID vaccines may now have a harder time.

01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:20.068
Listen carefully.

01:39:20.328 --> 01:39:28.674
After the Food and Drug Administration limited approval for the shots to adults 65 and older, or those who are at high risk for severe disease.

01:39:28.694 --> 01:39:32.256
The vaccine was previously available to anyone six months and older.

01:39:32.757 --> 01:39:37.380
People have questions and we're gonna try to answer some of them now with Caitlin Gedolina.

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:40.502
She's adjunct professor at the Yale School of Public Health

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:44.465
and the author of the Substack column, your local epidemiologist.

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:51.211
Adjunct professor means that you don't get paid, you're not on tenure, you're not on a tenure track.

01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:54.734
Adjunct professor is like a substitute teacher at best.

01:39:56.716 --> 01:39:57.997
I mean, it's really lame.

01:39:58.037 --> 01:40:04.843
I was an adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University and I was an adjunct professor because I taught a course there.

01:40:07.062 --> 01:40:09.363
but they didn't pay me except for that course, right?

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:12.405
Then I could say I was an adjunct professor and had a little ID.

01:40:12.425 --> 01:40:15.407
This is a Substack author.

01:40:17.768 --> 01:40:26.413
Substack authors have been put in place and recruited and probably given material and scripted material and AI enhanced material.

01:40:28.877 --> 01:40:40.228
in such a way that somebody like Jessica Rose can have tens of thousands of followers, that Robert Malone can have tens of thousands of followers and bringing in tens of thousands of dollars a month.

01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:48.916
So that they are completely independent actors able to stay on their provided updated scripts.

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:51.799
And this is just the other side of it.

01:40:52.788 --> 01:41:06.914
She is the equivalent of Alison Morrow and Meryl Nass on Dr. Drew, except she is a Substack author on the PBS NewsHour talking about the other side of the mystery virus narrative.

01:41:07.515 --> 01:41:08.435
That's all this is.

01:41:09.075 --> 01:41:10.136
Welcome back to the NewsHour.

01:41:10.176 --> 01:41:10.996
Thanks for joining us.

01:41:11.496 --> 01:41:12.277
Thanks for having me.

01:41:12.417 --> 01:41:13.737
Let's just start with the basics here.

01:41:13.837 --> 01:41:19.080
Right now, according to the FDA, who is eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine?

01:41:22.152 --> 01:41:39.057
And so, substack authors are part of a network of actors that are scripted to generate illusions of consensus on asocial, asocial media, that's a Dutch word spelled with two A's there, it's the opposite of social, that supports the notion that real things are happening.

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:49.098
And so the discussion between these two people supports the notion that they're discussing real things and, and debating real answers to real questions.

01:41:49.478 --> 01:42:01.082
And this trick, when it's applied with Joe Rogan can be easy for some people to see through when it's applied by a PBS news hour, it's harder for those same people to see through and vice versa.

01:42:01.762 --> 01:42:08.144
The people that think that they can see so easily through PBS news hour, some of them have been fooled by Joe Rogan's guests.

01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:16.033
That's how we have been bamboozled, how adults are being governed in America.

01:42:16.153 --> 01:42:20.916
And we need to wake our fellow adults up and we need to teach our kids this truth.

01:42:24.097 --> 01:42:27.760
I think one of the worst examples of this is this man right here.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.661
Kevin McKernan is his name.

01:42:30.361 --> 01:42:33.423
He is associated with the Human Genome Project and Mark Lander.

01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:35.420
and cannabis.

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:43.986
This guy has been going around social media on Substack and on X exclusively on the Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:44.066 --> 01:42:54.153
Free Health Freedom Movement side and perpetuating the idea that there's contamination in the shots that they, you know, lied about.

01:42:54.273 --> 01:42:57.155
And that's why people are being damaged by the mRNA.

01:42:57.195 --> 01:42:58.336
This guy's a scripted liar.

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:04.706
And he is a scripted liar and you can see it very easily if you watch this next video.

01:43:07.309 --> 01:43:09.953
This next video is from just last week.

01:43:11.601 --> 01:43:13.423
And so I want you to ask yourself a question.

01:43:13.463 --> 01:43:20.109
Is this a man who believes that the human race around the world has been poisoned by a contaminated COVID shot?

01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:27.535
A COVID shot that's contaminated with something that he terms SV40, which can cause cancer in his description.

01:43:27.956 --> 01:43:31.659
Does it sound like this is a guy who believes that?

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:33.881
Thank you.

01:43:35.424 --> 01:43:37.965
the dedicated team out here fighting the beach.

01:43:38.266 --> 01:43:38.606
I get it.

01:43:38.786 --> 01:43:40.667
If you're making sacrifices, I appreciate it.

01:43:42.148 --> 01:43:44.349
So, Deddy's always a hard talk to fill.

01:43:44.369 --> 01:43:45.149
He's got big shoes.

01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:46.550
He gives great talks on cancer.

01:43:47.671 --> 01:43:50.272
Unfortunately, he can't make it to the Israel stuff that's going on.

01:43:51.917 --> 01:44:08.183
I figured what I'd do is I'd fill in on discussing what's been very hotly debated throughout this entire conference, which is what is going on with the differential regulation that we have and what fingerprints does this leave in the sequencing data and in the microbial data that we have.

01:44:09.183 --> 01:44:16.545
And so I asked AI to sum up this and make me a little picture and it came up with this circular firing squad on top of a Titanic filled with cannabis.

01:44:19.406 --> 01:44:33.999
In this video, he is giving a talk about the differential regulation of hemp products versus cannabis and what compounds can be extracted from either and how they are regulated and governed and how he might contribute to it.

01:44:34.059 --> 01:44:44.888
He's also talking about how whole genome sequencing of a pot plant results in the whole genome sequencing of the microbiome.

01:44:47.389 --> 01:45:07.854
And so in a nutshell here, he's about to tell you exactly the problem with whole genome screening of a human being and why that is always really pretty tough because a human being is a sort of symphony that really includes the microbiome and our immunological interaction with it.

01:45:09.514 --> 01:45:13.495
And that optimizing that has never been on our radar as part of our health.

01:45:15.663 --> 01:45:23.186
The result of under optimizing it or even maladaptively, you know, fighting against it has never been factored into our health.

01:45:23.246 --> 01:45:30.830
And now they are going to slowly release this truth that in reality, we need to understand ourselves as a little more complex than just our DNA.

01:45:31.190 --> 01:45:35.232
We also have to worry about those pesky bacteria in our, in our guts and stuff.

01:45:36.237 --> 01:45:39.679
But they're still not talking about phages, which is really odd.

01:45:40.059 --> 01:45:48.423
They're not talking about bacteriophages at all, which is really odd because they are a central part of our very existence.

01:45:48.443 --> 01:45:51.445
So let's listen to this genius and scripted liar.

01:45:52.245 --> 01:46:00.790
Um, I guess be able to give a talk about cannabis and hemp, even though he believes that the human race was poisoned by transfection.

01:46:01.041 --> 01:46:08.206
And it's meant to symbolize the fact that we do seem to have two markets that are chasing the same plant but fighting.

01:46:09.387 --> 01:46:16.171
And we also have lots of consternation right now over laboratory shopping, which is valid, a valid concern, and we'll show you why.

01:46:17.152 --> 01:46:25.317
But the most egregious form of laboratory shopping is not ever doing any testing, which is what we have now legalized throughout the country through the Farm Bill.

01:46:27.202 --> 01:46:31.188
So this study will go through some of the tools we've built to monitor safety in a different way.

01:46:31.769 --> 01:46:35.254
And it will also go through some of the economics that are behind this.

01:46:35.334 --> 01:46:39.641
Because if you don't pay attention to the economics, you're probably going to be digging in the wrong place for a while.

01:46:40.046 --> 01:46:45.887
In the economics, I was shocked to find this year just reading a couple of these reports have really changed quite a bit.

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:49.808
For those who don't know medicinal genomics, I think you probably know us by now since you're here.

01:46:50.588 --> 01:46:57.369
But we do a lot of different things in the space in that we make microbial testing tools, usually PCR based with some of the robotics you saw out there.

01:46:57.389 --> 01:46:59.709
We do a lot of plant and virus detection.

01:46:59.729 --> 01:47:01.190
These aren't necessarily regulated tests.

01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:03.530
These could get used in either the hemp or the cannabis industry.

01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:08.751
And we build like automation tools for a lot of the labs that are out there doing safety testing.

01:47:09.638 --> 01:47:11.399
There's also some plant genetics work that we do.

01:47:11.419 --> 01:47:12.939
We do a lot of sequencing of cannabis genomes.

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:14.500
I'm going to share what we've learned from that.

01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:20.341
We have over 2,200 cannabis genomes now sequenced, so it's given us a very unique picture on the microbiome.

01:47:21.402 --> 01:47:26.183
And this also helps us understand how to grow cannabis in certain environments because we are finding

01:47:26.733 --> 01:47:39.558
If you guys saw Zemir Poonja's talk this morning, we've all been trying to scrub the environments in our grows to make sure we don't have any of these pathogens getting in, but what they're finding now is that a lot of these things, we think the entry is coming from the substrates we're growing in.

01:47:39.598 --> 01:47:50.962
The very cocoa and the rockwool that we're using seems to be seeding the plants with these contaminants, and they're trickling all the way through to the point where they can be failing people's total use and mold tests and what have you.

01:47:51.829 --> 01:47:56.552
So the hemp industry, you'll probably be shocked to find out, is now bigger than the cannabis industry.

01:47:56.853 --> 01:47:58.054
And this happened in two years.

01:47:59.455 --> 01:48:09.902
It's a really rapid growth of grows shifting and running away from the cannabis industry to become hemp companies because there are several advantages to doing this, which we'll lay out.

01:48:10.202 --> 01:48:12.104
These are based on Whitney Economics.

01:48:12.244 --> 01:48:19.189
They have this estimated anywhere between $28 billion to $80 billion, depending on how you measure the additional

01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:35.560
Multipliers that's almost as much as the monoclonal and polyclonal antibody market was worth before the pandemic Wow on the economy But we know we have the cannabis industry from his same Estimates is around 35 billion 34 to 35 billion.

01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:43.165
So we're getting a hemp market now that is actually larger than what we have in the last few years if you look at the

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.245
growth of the cannabis industries, many of the emissions have all sort of stalled in their sales.

01:48:48.626 --> 01:48:50.128
They're flat for two or three years.

01:48:50.168 --> 01:48:54.733
Well, one of the things that you need to understand about this guy is that he's all about artificial things.

01:48:54.793 --> 01:48:58.057
He's about artificially manufacturing plant compounds.

01:48:58.097 --> 01:49:01.241
You might find them in plants, but why would you use plants to make them?

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:05.985
He also wants to artificially manufacture psilocybin and its derivatives.

01:49:06.485 --> 01:49:22.578
This is one of the more malevolent monsters on stage because remember this guy's at a beach now giving a talk about the hemp versus cannabis industry while he also sometimes does a podcast about how the entire human race has been contaminated by the DNA contaminated shot.

01:49:23.339 --> 01:49:25.440
And if you look in the graph over on the

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.098
Oh my God, sorry, I'm shooting you guys.

01:49:28.438 --> 01:49:29.679
That's the cannabis industry.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.221
That there is the hemp industry in the same timeframe.

01:49:32.241 --> 01:49:34.402
So it has eclipsed the industry in a really short period of time.

01:49:34.462 --> 01:49:36.624
I mean, he's exactly the same as Brian Hooker.

01:49:36.664 --> 01:49:41.027
They might've even met when they were working on plants and making medicine with plants.

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:43.949
Like, come on, ladies and gentlemen, can you see it?

01:49:44.009 --> 01:49:48.192
It's all one little scripted show that's been behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:48.652 --> 01:49:50.713
And now they can throw Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:50.773 --> 01:49:52.294
under the bus and us along with it.

01:49:52.715 --> 01:49:55.637
If we can pull our family and friends out of this,

01:49:56.677 --> 01:50:00.339
nosedive, I think America might be able to heal.

01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:12.506
Of course, the left is still trapped in their own little nasal gazing, but of course they need to come to the same rude awakening that Donald Trump isn't the mastermind here.

01:50:14.006 --> 01:50:15.307
That Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:50:15.387 --> 01:50:16.768
isn't the mastermind here.

01:50:17.188 --> 01:50:23.071
You can't think that all these people behind the scenes are just letting incompetence rule America.

01:50:23.511 --> 01:50:24.472
That would be absurd.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.980
It can only be by script.

01:50:31.261 --> 01:50:38.303
And that's why this guy can so lackadaisically talk about hemp versus cannabis on his off time.

01:50:42.644 --> 01:50:46.285
So there's clearly demand for things going that direction.

01:50:47.421 --> 01:50:48.782
Now what's driving some of this demand?

01:50:49.263 --> 01:50:55.609
You can look to Google and do a quick search on THCA flour and you'll see a rapid rise in the interest of that term ever since the Farm Bill.

01:50:56.049 --> 01:50:56.830
Probably not surprising.

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:01.014
And then there is this curious increase of smoke shops everywhere.

01:51:01.694 --> 01:51:02.976
So these are smoke shops

01:51:03.756 --> 01:51:11.401
licenses, this individual on Twitter pulled them all down from, I think this is Florida, Georgia, and Texas, and they are going exponential.

01:51:11.561 --> 01:51:12.862
It's just not a real person.

01:51:13.682 --> 01:51:14.703
He's not a real person.

01:51:14.743 --> 01:51:19.545
His entire last six years of track record shows that he's not a real person.

01:51:19.585 --> 01:51:26.289
He's a scripted actor that has probably been recruited and part of this for a couple decades now.

01:51:26.710 --> 01:51:28.711
The Human Genome Project is an illusion.

01:51:29.672 --> 01:51:33.535
It is an illusion and it will remain an illusion for many decades to come.

01:51:34.935 --> 01:51:35.916
He is an illusion.

01:51:36.476 --> 01:51:38.037
Kevin McKernan is an illusion.

01:51:38.097 --> 01:51:46.523
He's an expert in a set of methodologies and its effect on our understanding of ourselves has been grossly exaggerated.

01:51:47.223 --> 01:51:49.905
He was also part of this paper and this paper really

01:51:50.525 --> 01:51:54.370
really reveals him and others as being part of this elaborate hoax.

01:51:55.271 --> 01:51:59.255
They never questioned it from the very beginning because it's part of the Human Genome Project.

01:51:59.315 --> 01:52:06.484
That's why all of these people were so curiously involved, and that's why none of them have ever made any progress to understanding that

01:52:06.844 --> 01:52:22.945
there is a bad biology 101 and evolution ain't real because we found dna that's absolutely absurd and in fact all of the scientists that were working at that time the discovery of dna and trying to figure it out in the context of bio bacteria and bacteriophages

01:52:23.365 --> 01:52:26.268
and came to the conclusion that they weren't figuring anything out.

01:52:26.408 --> 01:52:31.893
So something happened between the 60s and the 70s where we just decided we figured everything out.

01:52:32.334 --> 01:52:43.344
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:52:43.384 --> 01:52:45.046
And they have indeed done the same thing.

01:52:45.606 --> 01:52:47.907
with gain of function and pandemics.

01:52:48.408 --> 01:52:52.010
If you wanna get out, I think there's a way to move on from the bad biology.

01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:54.071
I'm just gonna put these up here for now.

01:52:54.111 --> 01:53:00.455
I'm not gonna read them because somebody's probably gonna steal them, but you can pause the thing and read them for yourself.

01:53:00.475 --> 01:53:03.857
This is the direction that I'm going with regard to Biology 101.

01:53:04.317 --> 01:53:11.622
And as soon as it's all written, we'll start working on it, but I'm not gonna write it on Substack in chapters, and I'm not gonna write it on

01:53:12.422 --> 01:53:14.243
on anything to do with my computer.

01:53:14.283 --> 01:53:15.343
It's going to be done first.

01:53:15.423 --> 01:53:17.384
These are not real people, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:17.424 --> 01:53:18.204
None of them are.

01:53:19.104 --> 01:53:19.945
None of them are.

01:53:20.105 --> 01:53:22.645
That's why Teo Vaughn is on this picture.

01:53:22.685 --> 01:53:25.927
That's why all of these people, this guy's on the picture.

01:53:26.627 --> 01:53:28.907
This guy just did a podcast with that character.

01:53:30.468 --> 01:53:33.309
And so I just want to leave you with something fun here.

01:53:34.429 --> 01:53:36.150
And then I'll just disappear.

01:53:38.214 --> 01:53:39.755
Imagine what I could do with this.

01:53:40.475 --> 01:53:42.417
Imagine what I could do with this skill.

01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:47.099
And then hopefully we'll see you tomorrow for another show.

01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.121
Thanks for being here again.

01:53:49.161 --> 01:53:50.021
Thanks for the patience.

01:53:50.401 --> 01:53:50.962
I'll see you soon.

01:54:00.227 --> 01:54:00.828
Oh, darn it.

01:54:00.868 --> 01:54:02.289
That's not where I was supposed to go.

01:54:02.349 --> 01:54:02.909
Sorry about that.

01:55:47.475 --> 01:55:47.556
do
