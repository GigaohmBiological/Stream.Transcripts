00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
So,

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
so,

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
so,

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
so,

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
so,

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
so,

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
so,

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
so,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
so,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
so,

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
so,

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
so,

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
so,

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
so,

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
so,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
so,

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
so,

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
so,

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
so,

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
so,

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
so,

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
so,

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
so,

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
so, so,

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
so, so,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
so,

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
so,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
so,

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
so,

00:33.500 --> 00:34.500
so,

00:34.500 --> 00:36.500
so,

00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
so,

00:38.500 --> 00:40.500
so,

00:40.500 --> 00:42.500
so,

00:42.500 --> 00:44.500
so,

00:44.500 --> 00:46.500
so,

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
so,

00:48.500 --> 00:51.300
so,

00:51.300 --> 00:54.500
so,

00:54.500 --> 01:12.820
Thank you very much.

01:12.820 --> 01:14.580
This is going to be a pretty relaxed stream.

01:14.580 --> 01:20.540
I'm not going to do a big intro, not a lot of music.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.660
I just need to keep going online.

01:22.660 --> 01:27.660
I'm doing a lot of work during the day now.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.260
And I'm trying very hard to get done with something that my friend, Denny, suggested

01:32.260 --> 01:36.620
that I do, which is write some stuff up.

01:36.620 --> 01:40.820
And so I am working on that, and I don't want to say much more because there's going to be

01:40.820 --> 01:47.340
plenty of people who are already starting to call me some kind of gatekeeper or whatever.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.020
And so we're not going to worry about these people.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.900
We're going to keep our flashlights facing forward.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.980
We're going to keep our arms straight.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.500
And we're going to keep looking for the exit of this cave.

01:58.500 --> 02:04.060
And we're not going to get into any of the arguments or discussions that are extemporaneous

02:04.060 --> 02:07.780
to that.

02:07.780 --> 02:14.580
But there are a lot of discussions that are going on with things like this.

02:14.580 --> 02:19.740
And so I wanted to bring a couple of those things to your attention today.

02:19.740 --> 02:26.580
Because I want you to have, I want you to be in touch with what's going on.

02:26.580 --> 02:42.140
The other day, I discussed with you a video with a good friend of mine in my imagination.

02:42.140 --> 02:51.660
A guy by the name of Fortnine or 4949 on YouTube who does a lot of motorcycle videos.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.180
I don't, I never, I don't, I haven't really thought about all the things I'm going to

02:55.180 --> 02:56.180
say.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.500
I've got four videos that I want to look at and four videos that I think kind of make

02:59.500 --> 03:05.420
the same point in different ways.

03:05.420 --> 03:11.660
What we talked about with Fortnine was to try and connect the idea that AI is being exaggerated

03:11.660 --> 03:18.140
as a power, AI is being exaggerated as a force in our world, not to say that it can't

03:18.140 --> 03:21.460
be used, not to say that it isn't being used.

03:21.460 --> 03:26.700
But there are certain intractable problems that even though AI is cool and machine learning

03:26.700 --> 03:33.180
is cool, we are being sold, sorry about that, I forgot that was still there.

03:33.180 --> 03:40.340
We are being sold a, the idea that there is a sort of infinite potential for AI to not

03:40.340 --> 03:44.260
only match us but to exceed us in the future.

03:44.260 --> 03:51.140
And this concept I think is, is very similar in a lot of ways in my imagination.

03:51.140 --> 03:55.340
And so I'm, as a teacher, I'm trying to impart this idea onto you.

03:55.340 --> 04:01.660
You can evaluate whether or not this metaphor or this parallel is accurate or not.

04:01.660 --> 04:10.260
But I feel very much as though the illusion of AI and it's, it's almost limitless potential.

04:10.260 --> 04:16.380
It's very similar to the illusion that was created in the 80s and 90s about the idea

04:16.380 --> 04:22.980
that if we could just sequence the human genome, we would be entering a new era of understanding

04:22.980 --> 04:30.020
that's simply the limitless possibilities that exist once we get to that stage.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.140
And that story was told for a long time.

04:32.140 --> 04:37.380
And I think one of my favorite anecdotes that I've heard during the pandemic was Robert

04:37.380 --> 04:42.300
Malone telling a story about how when he was a grad student, he naively thought that

04:42.300 --> 04:48.220
in 10 or 15 years that there would be a geneticist at every hospital curing childhood diseases

04:48.220 --> 04:50.980
with retroviruses.

04:50.980 --> 04:57.380
And so I think this is very similar to the idea that, okay, look, we show him that, that

04:57.380 --> 05:03.180
using CT scans, AI is better at diagnosing a particular thing than humans are, or they

05:03.180 --> 05:04.460
can see it earlier.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.020
But yeah, that's not quite the same thing.

05:08.020 --> 05:13.740
It's not even close to the same thing as, as what they're considering general intelligence

05:13.740 --> 05:19.700
to include creativity and problem identification, never, never mind problem solving.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.500
And this sort of iterative learning that will spin out of control and then suddenly we are

05:24.500 --> 05:29.820
enslaved by our eye watch because the, you know, something happened.

05:29.820 --> 05:35.740
And so there are people who believe this and I think one of the most spectacular examples

05:35.740 --> 05:41.660
of it is, is Sam Harris and Sam Harris is interesting because he's one of the original

05:41.660 --> 05:46.940
intellectual dark web members when it was a name that was christened at a table over

05:46.940 --> 05:48.660
dinner.

05:48.660 --> 05:55.340
And so I'm very curious as to what this guy who gave his first TED talk long ago about

05:55.340 --> 05:58.540
AI, what he really thinks about it.

05:58.540 --> 06:03.740
And, and I just happened to stumble on this David Pakman show and David Pakman is one

06:03.740 --> 06:11.060
of these guys who's one layer below in this, in this bros with shows pyramid where the

06:11.060 --> 06:16.500
guys at the top or the mid level, you know, the real old school intellectual dark web,

06:16.500 --> 06:22.580
they circulate down below to this level and legitimize certain members of this bros with

06:22.580 --> 06:23.980
shows level.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.380
And then this bros with shows level has people that argue with each other about the people

06:28.380 --> 06:30.740
up this up here at this level.

06:30.740 --> 06:37.580
And they show different loyalties to different people, Pakman David Pakman will defend Sam

06:37.580 --> 06:39.940
Harris and ridicule Brett Weinstein.

06:39.940 --> 06:44.420
And then somebody else over here will protect Brett Weinstein and ridicule Sam Harris.

06:44.420 --> 06:49.300
And it's this thing where it's not necessarily, you know, you don't draw lines or connect

06:49.300 --> 06:55.500
them with, with thread on a, on a bulletin board, but the behavior is, and the network

06:55.500 --> 07:01.100
is very consistent there, their sponsorships are very consistent in the way they circulate

07:01.100 --> 07:03.740
amongst each other is very consistent.

07:03.740 --> 07:10.660
And you can, you can be let into that discussion privately, you can be even teased with being

07:10.660 --> 07:15.020
led into that discussion publicly, but it, it is a gate.

07:15.020 --> 07:21.540
They are gatekeepers to their little network of people now that's not necessarily wrong.

07:21.540 --> 07:27.180
I mean, you know, Rogan having certain people that he decides to have on regularly as a

07:27.180 --> 07:31.900
way to try to give them a platform and get their own podcast going in principle.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.740
That's fine.

07:33.740 --> 07:38.940
But if the pyramid is being set up by weaponized piles of money, and we're being led to believe

07:38.940 --> 07:44.860
that this is just some grassroots cool dudes network, then it's very different.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.140
If we're being led to believe that all these guys are just, you know, getting mushrooms

07:48.140 --> 07:52.460
on the street, and they're getting all these drugs, but it's, it's not being supplied

07:52.460 --> 07:54.180
by anybody that we should care about.

07:54.180 --> 07:59.260
They're just as criminal as we are when we get our drugs, you know, drill Rogan talks

07:59.260 --> 08:03.700
about having all these different psychedelics all the time and all these different experiences

08:03.700 --> 08:06.020
with all these different people on his show.

08:06.020 --> 08:09.420
And we're supposed to kind of believe that that's the same thing as going to a goose

08:09.420 --> 08:12.900
concert and getting a bag of mushrooms and going home and doing it.

08:12.900 --> 08:17.140
And what they're doing is the same thing, but it's not because they get away with it.

08:17.140 --> 08:19.580
If you get caught, you'll be a schedule one substance.

08:19.580 --> 08:22.420
You'll do 10 years.

08:22.420 --> 08:27.540
And yet they're allowed to talk freely on their podcast about these kinds of things as if

08:27.540 --> 08:34.660
it's just okay for the cool kids to use testosterone late in life or or any number of supplements

08:34.660 --> 08:40.140
or go on a steak only diet and all these other things that again, in principle, I'm not arguing

08:40.180 --> 08:44.740
about the biological benefits of any of these particular things.

08:44.740 --> 08:50.620
I'm just suggesting that as many, many other people before me have suggested that this

08:50.620 --> 08:55.340
is not some spontaneous network of cool guys.

08:55.340 --> 09:02.020
This is a carefully crafted network of influencers that's been put there because of their appeal,

09:02.020 --> 09:06.980
because of their skill and their, and their orative ability, but also because they're

09:07.020 --> 09:11.460
part of this team through family connections and other reasons.

09:11.460 --> 09:18.300
And those connections are starting to become obvious to, you know, if you do enough reading

09:18.300 --> 09:22.940
and you do enough paying attention and you listen to them, them, them talk themselves

09:22.940 --> 09:27.980
talk and pay attention to what they say, they've actually admitted it throughout the pandemic

09:27.980 --> 09:37.580
and before that this was kind of an orchestrated effort to set up this alternative limited

09:37.580 --> 09:38.580
spectrum of debate.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.500
Now, whether or not these guys are bad guys is a completely, they could be the good guys,

09:42.500 --> 09:47.740
they could be the cavalry riding and I don't think Sam Harris is, but maybe Brett Weinstein's

09:47.740 --> 09:48.740
a great guy.

09:48.740 --> 09:53.340
Maybe he's going to be end up to be the greatest patriot in American history.

09:53.340 --> 09:59.460
I guess it's possible, but I think because of who his father is, because of who his brother

09:59.460 --> 10:05.700
is, because who his brother works for, because of his weird circumstances of leaving a university

10:05.700 --> 10:11.820
with a $500,000 settlement, I mean, these are, these are things that bring into question

10:11.820 --> 10:16.980
for me exactly how much he suffered and exactly how much he suffers on a daily basis relative

10:16.980 --> 10:23.300
to somebody like me or Mark Coolack or, or even somebody like Charles Rixi who was working

10:23.300 --> 10:29.300
at a shoe store at the beginning of the pandemic, not, not running a successful podcast on its

10:29.300 --> 10:38.100
eighth episode with Sam Harris, bringing up the or, or navigating for him behind him telling

10:38.100 --> 10:43.620
him about how in the next deadly pandemic when 70% of the people are dying, we're not

10:43.620 --> 10:49.060
going to have any time to tolerate anti-vaxxers.

10:49.060 --> 10:57.740
So again, there are people that need special attention, not because of just because that

10:57.740 --> 11:02.780
they got things wrong, not just because they advocated for masks and lockdowns for way

11:02.780 --> 11:09.660
longer than any sane person should have advocated for them, especially any person who now claims

11:09.660 --> 11:12.900
to understand that they are indeed some kind of a problem.

11:12.900 --> 11:20.820
I actually expect Brett Weinstein to say something to the effect of masks were not significantly

11:20.820 --> 11:23.500
beneficial.

11:23.500 --> 11:29.340
I actually expect Brett Weinstein to say something like, they did stop spread, but just not enough

11:29.340 --> 11:35.860
for them to mean to justify having worn one, certainly not enough to justify the mandates.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.220
It's something like that.

11:37.220 --> 11:45.460
It's not going to be, I was wrong and putting a mask on people to stop a virus of this size

11:45.460 --> 11:47.620
should have never been a debatable thing.

11:47.620 --> 11:54.380
I should have never debated the idea of fomites or aerosols, the idea that anything to do

11:54.380 --> 11:56.260
with goggles would have been a good idea.

11:56.260 --> 12:01.900
I was just being silly and even more, I should admit, Brett should admit that that was of

12:01.900 --> 12:09.020
course crazy to tell adults to do that to their kids and then us to impart this idea

12:09.020 --> 12:13.500
to children that when we go out in public, we've got to protect ourselves from the outside

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
world.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.700
This was a very, very, very, very dangerous psychological attack on our children that

12:19.700 --> 12:26.180
we, for the most part, went along with because we had to, because we were made to, but mostly

12:27.180 --> 12:35.380
but for a lot of people, because we saw people on television, we heard authority figures telling

12:35.380 --> 12:37.260
us that it would make a difference.

12:37.260 --> 12:41.260
And so I could tell my brother all I wanted to, that it was pointless.

12:41.260 --> 12:48.220
I could tell my brother all I wanted to about the people who work on controlling biohazards

12:48.220 --> 12:53.300
in a laboratory, know what masks work and what masks don't, you don't wear a surgical

12:53.300 --> 12:58.020
mask to protect yourself from getting things in.

12:58.020 --> 13:02.340
You're wearing a surgical mask so that you don't spray sputum on the thing that you're

13:02.340 --> 13:03.340
working on.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.340
That's it.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.300
It's nothing else.

13:06.300 --> 13:14.940
That's why when people come into a surgery to observe, they don't have to wear a a a covering.

13:14.940 --> 13:19.380
They do a lot of times, but if you bring someone in and they're standing far enough back, most

13:19.380 --> 13:23.860
of those students and stuff don't wear a face mask because they're, they're not going

13:23.860 --> 13:27.780
to be allowed to talk anyway.

13:27.780 --> 13:34.020
And so again, we're going getting a little off task here, but what I wanted to to emphasize

13:34.020 --> 13:39.420
is that Sam Harris is a guy who at the very beginning of the pandemic was already in this

13:39.420 --> 13:45.020
alternative position of being an influencer in the intellectual dark web, a real, you

13:45.020 --> 13:48.900
know, in some people's mind, a very exalted intellectual.

13:48.900 --> 13:57.380
I'm not really sure if his pedigree and, and his, his, his career, you know, it doesn't

13:57.380 --> 14:01.020
really, it's not really supported by what he's actually accomplished in his career, either

14:01.020 --> 14:05.780
as an academy magician or as, I guess maybe he's an author that a lot of people have liked

14:05.780 --> 14:08.420
his books.

14:08.420 --> 14:13.420
But if you look backwards at what he's done over his career, it really feels like a bunch

14:13.420 --> 14:15.860
of forced topics.

14:15.860 --> 14:22.180
This last latest foray into whether or not we have free will is just right.

14:22.180 --> 14:25.100
It's a, it's a dead on strike.

14:25.100 --> 14:31.460
If you think baseball, it's a dead on strike right in the middle, right down the pipe for,

14:31.460 --> 14:35.500
for all of these people that are trying to organize our thoughts and, and organize our

14:35.500 --> 14:43.340
kids thoughts to surrender to this, this overwhelming, you know, global force, this global, this

14:43.340 --> 14:48.380
globalizing force, this thing that, you know, nationalism and, and national borders and

14:48.380 --> 14:55.780
national governments, it's all just a antiquated idea, a multi polar world is coming into existence

14:55.780 --> 14:56.780
very soon.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.420
This, this is where we are.

14:58.420 --> 15:04.300
And so these people need to maintain the worst case scenario and Sam Harris maintains the

15:04.300 --> 15:09.660
worst case scenario with number one, he's denying all the time that this has anything

15:09.660 --> 15:10.940
to do with the laboratory.

15:10.940 --> 15:14.780
And so we're never going to get him to understand that clones are important and clones are important

15:14.780 --> 15:16.180
in the laboratory story.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.980
And so he's just going to deny the laboratory story because again, this fuels the Scooby-Doo,

15:20.980 --> 15:25.860
but also he's very big on AI and the potential dangers of it.

15:25.860 --> 15:26.860
Let's listen.

15:26.860 --> 15:30.300
It's about it really haven't changed.

15:30.300 --> 15:36.380
I think we're, we've seen progress in it that has surprised more or less everyone.

15:36.380 --> 15:41.500
So I, I, we're, we're here sooner than, than I was expecting, frankly, I don't know

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
what I was expecting.

15:42.500 --> 15:48.140
I mean, my, my argument for, uh, are being concerned about AI really wasn't anchored

15:48.140 --> 15:49.140
to any kind of timeline.

15:49.140 --> 15:55.060
I, I think I gave my, I gave my TED talk on this topic in 2016 and I think it was about

15:55.060 --> 16:01.060
2014 or 15 where I first became a cognizant of the issue and, and worried about it.

16:01.060 --> 16:05.460
I mean, I, I, I, more or less everyone had thought we hadn't made much progress than

16:05.460 --> 16:07.340
all of a sudden progress.

16:07.340 --> 16:12.180
The rumors of progress were, um, uh, you know, unenorable with, with the breakthroughs

16:12.180 --> 16:19.660
that deep mind made, uh, with chess and go and, um, alpha fold and so there's, there's

16:19.660 --> 16:23.340
the first, um, there's the first chicanery, right?

16:23.340 --> 16:31.420
So chess and go chess number one has turned out to be a very conquerable level of possibilities

16:31.420 --> 16:38.300
and a possibility space that's quite conquerable because the possibility space, useful versus

16:38.300 --> 16:43.220
useless possibility space is pretty easy to delineate.

16:43.220 --> 16:49.860
Go on the other hand is a much bigger possibility space with much less clear borders around

16:49.860 --> 16:55.180
what is useful and what isn't as far as the configuration of play.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.620
So that's also something that you can't underestimate.

16:58.620 --> 17:02.660
Chess is very constrained from the perspective of the pieces, how they move and the space

17:02.660 --> 17:03.940
and all that other stuff.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.660
I mean, it's still a wonderful game.

17:05.660 --> 17:06.660
Don't get me wrong.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.340
I'm not, I'm not some kind of chess master.

17:08.340 --> 17:10.740
I don't, I'm not insulting the game.

17:10.740 --> 17:15.540
I think most people that know the games and their, their total possibility spaces will

17:15.540 --> 17:22.180
all agree that go is a more, um, it's a harder game to get your head around.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.060
It's a harder game to understand.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.100
It's a harder game to explain.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.060
It's a harder game to finish.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.820
It's an extraordinary game.

17:30.820 --> 17:37.900
And so it was a more significant accomplishment from an AI perspective to win against Go.

17:37.900 --> 17:43.340
It's turned out that it's not really foolproof anymore and that humans with enough random

17:43.340 --> 17:47.620
play can basically throw the computer off quite a bit.

17:47.620 --> 17:55.260
And the algorithm that works against the best of the best is vulnerable to, to noise basically.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.380
Now I'm not saying that, that, that it didn't work.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.340
It still does work.

17:59.340 --> 18:06.540
But now the last thing that he brings up here is alpha fold and alpha fold is Google's,

18:06.540 --> 18:13.420
um, we're almost there exclamation about the idea that we have a computer program that

18:13.420 --> 18:19.980
you can put in your amino acid, uh, sequence and we can show you how that, that protein

18:19.980 --> 18:21.340
is going to fold.

18:21.340 --> 18:27.100
There's a number of different reasons why this, this claim is absurd, um, and the claim

18:27.100 --> 18:33.620
probably works to a certain extent on certain things with certain, uh, amino acid combinations

18:33.620 --> 18:41.820
that are, let's say, could be hierarchically, hierarchically ranked so that, um, you know,

18:41.820 --> 18:47.980
basic patterns like, uh, alpha helices or, or beta pleated sheets that, that form and

18:47.980 --> 18:55.580
are agreed upon as general tertiary structures that proteins fold, uh, or proteins make.

18:55.580 --> 19:01.660
These kinds of things can generally speaking be analyzed and identified very similarly,

19:01.660 --> 19:05.820
um, you're going to have, and you've seen this throughout the pandemic, people using

19:05.820 --> 19:12.940
algorithms to identify potential amyloidogenic protein sequences and potential pre-energetic

19:13.020 --> 19:20.060
sequences and how long they are depends on what protein, uh, program that they use, what sequence

19:20.060 --> 19:25.260
program that they use, what algorithm that they use. And a lot of these things haven't been shown

19:25.260 --> 19:30.620
in vivo. They've been shown in vitro in cell culture or something like that. It's not to dismiss

19:30.620 --> 19:35.580
the phenomenon. It's not to dismiss the observations. It's to say that you have to take all of these

19:35.580 --> 19:41.500
things with a grain of salt. And so alpha fold is another one of these things where if that thing

19:41.500 --> 19:47.180
was as useful as you thought it was, then there would be lots of tractable, tractable problems

19:47.180 --> 19:52.940
that are currently on the desk that could be solved by alpha fold and it hasn't done any of them.

19:53.500 --> 19:59.660
Basically, there's a number of chest problems or a number of go problems in proteins that has

19:59.660 --> 20:06.060
yet to be solved that haven't been solved. And those are all kinds of proteins that have never

20:06.060 --> 20:11.580
been able to be crystallized. And so I would love to be corrected or I'd love to be updated

20:11.580 --> 20:16.140
that alpha fold is just going down a list of things that haven't been crystallized and haven't been

20:16.140 --> 20:21.100
visualized and just knocking them down and being like, wow, here's this one. Here's this one. Here's

20:21.100 --> 20:27.020
this one. And answering questions about function and structure that they haven't known because

20:27.020 --> 20:32.460
they haven't had the structure of the ion channel or they haven't had the structure of the

20:33.020 --> 20:37.180
the G protein coupled receptor that they're talking about. And now that they have the structure,

20:37.180 --> 20:41.740
they can connect the structure to function. I would love to see that these questions are being

20:41.740 --> 20:47.500
answered. And I think by listing them here, it's almost as if he assumes that they are or soon

20:47.500 --> 20:52.700
will be because otherwise alpha fold wouldn't exist. But the bottom line is is that alpha fold

20:52.700 --> 20:58.380
was announced. They said that we know how proteins fold. And then no major breakthroughs have been

20:58.380 --> 21:04.380
made since. The nuclear pore was shown to be opening and closing. And that was really cool.

21:04.380 --> 21:12.060
That's all well and good. But does that really mean that when we put in a sequence like a viral

21:12.060 --> 21:18.940
sequence that we can understand how that protein folds in different ribosome complements? Can we

21:18.940 --> 21:25.580
understand how the ribosomes of different tissues work relative to that same RNA sequence? Or are

21:25.580 --> 21:32.700
we really talking about proteins and how they fold? And then the variability that's created by

21:32.700 --> 21:39.260
the ribosome that's created by the the differential ribosome complement that's in every cell at every

21:39.260 --> 21:46.380
tissue and every, every different kind specific on earth, then are we really looking at it? Or are we

21:46.380 --> 21:53.340
are we just kind of doing what I would call some kind of computer chicanery? You know, if we get

21:53.420 --> 22:00.540
pretty close, they'll never know the difference. And it with biology, I'm afraid that there's

22:00.540 --> 22:04.060
going to be a lot of times when they're going to say, well, if we get pretty close, they're never

22:04.060 --> 22:12.780
going to know the difference. If we can get it right with, you know, diabetes and heart disease and,

22:12.780 --> 22:18.620
you know, a couple, let's say five really bright signals, then we can pretend that the blood tests

22:18.620 --> 22:24.380
were using tests for 100 signals, as long as we get those five right, then we can probably pretend

22:24.380 --> 22:29.260
on the rest of them. And then we'll catch up later. We'll fix all those other problems later.

22:29.260 --> 22:33.660
That's where alpha fold is. We've tested it on a few things that we know it works on. It works

22:33.660 --> 22:38.220
really well. We put it on a few other things that work pretty well. So pretty much we've got protein

22:38.220 --> 22:45.660
solved. Ta-da, cut the ribbon, pop the champagne. Here it is. And now this tool is still not really

22:45.660 --> 22:51.820
useful because it doesn't translate into any real world advantage. And then,

22:53.820 --> 22:58.620
and then, yeah, I mean, this has been quite thrilling on one level. If you're at all

22:59.580 --> 23:04.620
hopeful that we can build this technology in a way that is safe, well, then it really does seem like

23:06.060 --> 23:12.140
we're on the cusp of solving lots of problems for which more intelligence is the solution.

23:13.020 --> 23:19.020
So it could be the most useful labor-saving device ever invented. And then we just have to

23:19.020 --> 23:24.300
get our minds around what we do politically and economically around that and the displacement of

23:24.300 --> 23:32.700
human labor that would be quickly following that. But I do worry, and I think many people much

23:32.700 --> 23:41.260
closer to this work are similarly worried, that we're in a situation where the incentives are

23:42.620 --> 23:51.100
aligned so as to produce a catastrophic outcome if we make sufficiently quick progress. I mean,

23:51.100 --> 23:55.820
we're in an arms race condition. And an arms race is not the condition you want to be into it,

23:55.820 --> 24:08.940
to incentivize the cautious ethical deployment of a technology, which it seems you sort of have

24:08.940 --> 24:17.900
to get right on the first try, right? I mean, we can't birth a digital God that is more intelligent

24:17.900 --> 24:24.540
and more competent than we are digital God that is more intelligent and more competent than we are

24:25.100 --> 24:31.980
a digital God that is more intelligent and more competent than we are that is unaligned with our

24:31.980 --> 24:38.780
interests. And then we have to find ourselves in the position of negotiating with that thing.

24:39.260 --> 24:44.540
To become more aligned with our interests. I just don't understand how this digital God

24:45.900 --> 24:53.500
gains this all powerful status. How does it start jumping into end loaders and changing traffic

24:53.500 --> 25:02.060
patterns? How does it? You know, I get the idea. I've seen the Hollywood movies of the internet

25:02.060 --> 25:07.500
virus or Ultron going into the computer and being everywhere and taking over stuff. But

25:10.700 --> 25:15.580
that's very different than what we're able to accomplish with chess and with Go and any of

25:15.580 --> 25:22.220
these language models are also just an elaborate illusion. The point of it being that our own

25:22.220 --> 25:27.660
understanding of language and its power over us is very limited and it's limited on purpose

25:27.660 --> 25:33.900
because people have been using language against us in a weaponized way for decades, if not centuries.

25:37.020 --> 25:46.540
And these tricks are not new. Having a computer have the machine learning capability to

25:47.420 --> 25:55.500
use language effectively against us is not very surprising. But that is a

25:56.380 --> 26:01.980
sort of asymptope of functionality that is very different than the asymptope that he's talking

26:01.980 --> 26:06.620
about, which is general intelligence, where it's just going to get if it wants to and gets

26:06.620 --> 26:13.500
pissed off. It's just going to build stuff and get rid of us. And we won't be able to unplug it

26:13.500 --> 26:19.900
or you know, it won't need batteries anymore or a magnet won't you know, I don't know, but it seems

26:19.900 --> 26:29.980
very, there's a long ways between the Hollywood worst case scenario of AI and where we are now

26:29.980 --> 26:38.140
with chess go and alpha fold. And I find it absolutely preposterous that this guy whose whole career

26:38.140 --> 26:43.980
is just based on talking smack and I guess being able to write it down on paper with some degree

26:43.980 --> 26:53.180
of clarity is able to be an authority on this stuff. I'm pretty sure that he's not sophisticated,

26:53.180 --> 26:59.260
I may could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure he's not sophisticated enough to even build a basic

26:59.260 --> 27:06.060
machine learning algorithm. Like, you know, I don't know, like a visual network that would process

27:06.060 --> 27:10.700
images or something like that, he might be able to describe it, I would hope that he would. But

27:10.780 --> 27:15.420
I wonder if he could describe it off of the cover, we'd have to go back and read it first to describe

27:15.420 --> 27:19.820
a multi layered neuronal network and how it would work to process images.

27:22.940 --> 27:28.620
Because that's not even close to the kind of network that is necessary for chess or for go.

27:28.620 --> 27:32.860
And that's not even close to a network that's necessary to even penetrate one

27:33.660 --> 27:37.660
of the complex patterned integrities that is us in concert.

27:41.500 --> 27:49.180
And so again, this idea of AI becoming all powerful or generally intelligence, a digital god,

27:50.540 --> 27:56.860
right, like Ultron, who's talking smack in our own language to us about how pathetic we are,

27:56.860 --> 28:05.500
that AI is a Hollywood illusion. And he apparently believes we're right around the corner,

28:05.500 --> 28:09.980
we need to be really careful because we can only get it right once if Ultron comes out angry,

28:09.980 --> 28:17.900
we're done. That's pretty impressive. I mean, the people who doubt that there's any real danger

28:17.900 --> 28:25.420
here, in my view, are people who are who are not taking the time to imagine what it will be like

28:25.420 --> 28:31.340
to have a system that really is general in its intelligence and superhuman in its intelligence.

28:31.340 --> 28:36.220
It will be superhuman by definition, because all of our narrow intelligences are already superhuman.

28:36.220 --> 28:43.260
I mean, the calculator in your phone is better than you are at arithmetic. It's the facial

28:43.260 --> 28:48.700
recognition and speech recognition and emotion recognition and all these piecemeal capacities

28:48.700 --> 28:53.420
we're building. I mean, if we want to make this stupid argument, isn't a hammer superhuman because

28:53.420 --> 29:03.500
a hammer can pound in a nail much better than a human can, isn't a bicycle superhuman because

29:03.500 --> 29:09.420
a human on a bicycle, isn't that an augmented human because it's a human on a bike, and going

29:09.420 --> 29:16.780
faster than a human could ever go. I mean, he's talking about apples and oranges and saying it,

29:16.780 --> 29:21.420
so I mean, I don't really know what the analogy is, but he's not making a real coherent connection

29:21.420 --> 29:26.860
between what he's claiming and what he's thinking and what he wants to happen, what he thinks can

29:26.860 --> 29:39.020
happen. This is just a general worst case scenario is, and remember, and this is the point I'm sorry,

29:39.020 --> 29:48.700
I'm drinking, I'm going to try not to try not to have a little burp there. This is the same power

29:49.020 --> 29:59.820
that Klaus Schwab and all the transhumanist futurists like Jamie Metzel. This is the power that they

29:59.820 --> 30:07.820
think that if they just turn it on the human genome, if they just turn it on the epic database,

30:07.820 --> 30:14.860
if they just turn it on the DMED database of all the biomedical data of all the people in the

30:14.940 --> 30:22.380
Midwest or all the people in the military, that AI will be able to take that information and

30:22.380 --> 30:29.740
turn it into useful understanding about who we are, about how our genome works, about how our

30:29.740 --> 30:35.420
proteome fluctuates over the course of our lifetime to orchestrate who we are as people

30:35.420 --> 30:41.820
spiritually, mentally, and in our well be. That's what they believe because again, you know, I mean,

30:42.300 --> 30:49.900
chess and go and an alpha fold. That's the argument that this pseudo intellectual is making right

30:49.900 --> 30:57.180
now. And it's it's absolutely terrifying because of again, he is being amplified over and over again.

30:57.180 --> 31:03.580
This is all around. And half of the people really think that this is have intellectual powerhouse.

31:03.580 --> 31:16.060
I mean, he's got the horsepower of a of a pocket watch that only runs in two orientations. I mean,

31:16.060 --> 31:24.940
give me a break. Building into to AI at this point, once it once they become and both of them have

31:24.940 --> 31:31.020
become, you know, better than we are at those at those tasks, but anything that we actually deploy

31:31.100 --> 31:37.260
is going to be is going to be very quickly be at at human level for about five minutes. And then

31:37.260 --> 31:42.540
it'll be superhuman. And it'll never be subhuman again, right? It's just like chess, you know,

31:42.540 --> 31:47.980
chess was not as good as you and me at one point. I don't know when that was maybe in the in the

31:47.980 --> 31:52.540
sixties. And then it got better than the average person, but still not nearly as good as a as a

31:52.540 --> 31:57.420
grandmaster. But this had a lot more to do with the algorithms. And it had a lot more to do with

31:57.420 --> 32:03.740
computing power. And once they could throw computing power at it, and it started to multiply the

32:03.740 --> 32:10.140
number of calculations and the number of games that could be played in a given time. That was

32:10.140 --> 32:14.060
always what the problem was when I was in high school, and then definitely when I was in college,

32:14.060 --> 32:19.980
all you had to do is set it to grandmaster level and give it infinite time. It come up with the

32:19.980 --> 32:26.220
right move and in two hours or three hours. And that was just the limitation of the computing,

32:26.380 --> 32:32.460
the cranking it through. Now we can use those same algorithms and crank it through and in a

32:32.460 --> 32:38.860
thousand or even a 10,000th of that time, especially if you can take a graphics type chip, you know,

32:38.860 --> 32:43.820
with a kudos with kuda cores or whatever the hell they are, and use those for calculations.

32:45.100 --> 32:55.660
So it's kind of disingenuous that he's portraying the progress of AI being any more than frame rate.

32:56.700 --> 33:07.020
Because in so many aspects, the advance of computers and AI is frame rate its calculations per second,

33:07.020 --> 33:15.900
and then brute force application of that onto a problem. And so I still don't think that he

33:15.900 --> 33:25.580
understands how this in no way, shape or form penetrates or would be useful in penetrating

33:26.300 --> 33:33.340
the irreducible complexity of biology, wherever that irreducible complexity

33:33.340 --> 33:40.940
complexity irreducible complexity, wherever that boundary lies, you can't get past that

33:41.580 --> 33:48.060
by recalculating over and over and making many, many, many, many, many, many measurements of it

33:48.060 --> 33:54.300
until you finally have enough measurements so that you understand that complexity. That's not how

33:54.300 --> 34:00.700
that works. You can't measure the temperature in a moving river enough times to understand how the

34:00.700 --> 34:07.340
temperature is fluctuating in that river. You just can't. And you're not going to be able to

34:08.300 --> 34:22.220
usefully measure the biology of a human relative to their genetics, even if you can monitor all the

34:22.220 --> 34:27.420
epigenetics in all of the cell types in the body at the same time, which you can't. But I guess the

34:27.420 --> 34:33.980
the Chan Zuckerberg initiative is going to make little cells that can do all that reporting and

34:33.980 --> 34:38.380
they're going to they they purport to be able to. They're going to send little sensors around

34:38.380 --> 34:42.540
the body. They're going to make measurements and they're going to do informatics and all this stuff

34:43.100 --> 34:54.300
has all been said to be eventually doctors in hospitals using retroviruses to cure childhood

34:54.300 --> 35:03.500
diseases. It's the same quackery because you're talking about crossing a line. You're talking about

35:04.620 --> 35:11.260
crossing a line with this technology that just simply can't be crossed because this technology

35:11.260 --> 35:21.020
isn't capable of pushing across it. It is useful for a lot of things. And I'm going to give you an

35:21.020 --> 35:27.900
example of what it might be useful for. It might be useful, for example, to oh wait I didn't have

35:27.980 --> 35:33.020
that up here. Where's that? Wait, okay, I got one more. I got to do one more. Sorry.

35:35.340 --> 35:44.780
This was the whole reason why I was going to do this today. I saw this this episode of 60

35:44.780 --> 35:49.500
minutes the other day, which really got me thinking about a number of things. And so I wanted to watch

35:49.500 --> 35:54.620
it with you. This is really tonight's main episode. That's why I have the the ticking in the background.

35:55.420 --> 36:00.620
Next Sunday on CBS, the Super Bowl will, for the first time, be held in Las Vegas,

36:00.620 --> 36:06.700
a fitting venue given the prominent role gambling plays in sports today. America's recently brought

36:06.700 --> 36:12.140
its age-old love of sports betting out of the shadows and onto our phones. And this has created

36:12.140 --> 36:17.980
an all-time mismatch, pitting man against machine. Gamblers, overwhelmingly young men,

36:17.980 --> 36:25.180
versus gambling companies armed with sophisticated AI data and engineering enticing fans to make

36:25.180 --> 36:31.260
snap bets not just on games but on every play within games. The early results billions for

36:31.260 --> 36:36.460
gambling companies, leagues, and state governments and a growing population of sports betters

36:36.460 --> 36:42.940
struggling to defend against the rush. The story will continue in a moment.

36:48.220 --> 36:54.940
Boston is nothing if not a sports town. And when there's a game, odds are good. There are guys like

36:54.940 --> 37:03.100
Billy, Andrew, and John at the local bar. They grew up playing hockey together. Now in their

37:03.100 --> 37:09.740
mid-20s, they bond over beer, wings, trash talk, and lately a new fixture of the fan experience.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.220
Now what I find interesting, oh, I'm going to play that.

37:14.380 --> 37:19.340
I'm going to catch that right in lately. A new fixture of the now what's interesting about

37:19.340 --> 37:28.140
this is is that AI is not solving a super problem here. AI is not solving a super problem here.

37:28.140 --> 37:34.620
What AI is doing is a lot like what Hugh Sotonic live Mark Coolack has suggested for a very long

37:34.620 --> 37:40.060
time. AI did with the domain program. The AI spit out an answer so that you can just say,

37:40.060 --> 37:47.580
well, the AI told me. And in this case, the AI is producing instant odds all the time so that

37:47.580 --> 37:54.140
the bookie doesn't need to be present. And the bookie is optimizing his thing based on your

37:55.100 --> 38:05.820
engagement with the app. You're betting on every play, every series in football, every quarter

38:05.820 --> 38:12.940
in basketball, every set in tennis, even on matches that you don't care about.

38:14.300 --> 38:22.460
And the idea, again, is to use AI to entice people, use AI to learn how to make you engage

38:22.460 --> 38:28.540
with this thing is a very, very simple game relative to chess or go.

38:29.020 --> 38:39.260
It is not some kind of wow, this thing is just figuring stuff out wizard, like, no, no, no, no,

38:39.260 --> 38:47.260
no. And it's horrible because the AI also then is completely sort of absolving the people who

38:47.260 --> 38:54.460
run the site from any malicious activity because the AI is doing it. They don't have to feel bad

38:54.540 --> 39:00.060
about taking all of these people's money all the time, just because they want to bet on a

39:00.060 --> 39:06.860
Patriots game. I mean, sorry, man, we all got to make a living, right?

39:10.380 --> 39:15.500
Gambling used to be something that most people would have been ashamed to admit that they do.

39:15.500 --> 39:20.540
When I was a kid, adults would have been ashamed to admit that they had a bookie and that they

39:21.340 --> 39:31.420
bet on games. Now it's being portrayed as basically okay. I mean, it's fun and harmless.

39:35.180 --> 39:40.220
Spectacular. Spectacular where we are. Fan experience. What do you guys been on?

39:40.220 --> 39:43.980
Football hockey. You have a team? Berlin's Patriots. You want to lose money, you don't

39:43.980 --> 39:49.500
lose the Patriots. Meaning and losing money for millions of fans like these guys. It's one more

39:49.500 --> 39:55.820
reason to watch and enjoy sports. Big news. During games, promotions for sports books like

39:55.820 --> 40:04.060
Fan, Dual and Draft Kings are everywhere. A 2018 Supreme Court decision opened the door for states

40:04.060 --> 40:11.020
to legalize sports betting. Cantalized by new revenue, 38 states and counting have done just that.

40:12.380 --> 40:16.460
And Americans have spent more than a quarter of a trillion dollars sports betting.

40:17.100 --> 40:22.300
That's the GDP of Greece. Yigs have cashed in. Network's too.

40:22.300 --> 40:25.900
Man, I got to teach you how to get with it. For decades, odds and points spreads were

40:25.900 --> 40:28.940
forbidden topics too. That's pretty funny. And I got to teach you how to get with it.

40:28.940 --> 40:35.900
Decades, odds and points spreads were forbidden topics. Now do you see that? That's that's them.

40:36.700 --> 40:44.380
Social distancing on the TNT tip-off auto trader presented by tip-off social distance.

40:45.180 --> 40:51.820
For decades, odds and points spreads were forbidden topics. Now ESPN has its own sports book.

40:51.820 --> 40:56.940
Call it, baby. Full disclosure, when I work at the tennis channel, I sit here. The Draft Kings

40:56.940 --> 41:01.420
fund download the app. So right now, I'm just looking at the box. Back at the bar, casual social

41:01.420 --> 41:07.020
betters like Billy, Andrew, and John revel in their wins. What'd you throw down? Eight dollars.

41:07.020 --> 41:11.660
Now what I'm going to ask you to listen to for a little while longer because the language starts

41:11.660 --> 41:15.740
to become the enchantment. And I need you to hear it. I need to see it because they've been

41:15.740 --> 41:21.580
doing it for a while. But now it's starting to become frighteningly obvious. But survey after survey

41:21.580 --> 41:27.580
confirms that of the 50 million or so sports betters in the U.S., men under the age of 35

41:27.580 --> 41:32.860
are far and away the biggest demographic. For decades, league-speared gambling would

41:32.860 --> 41:39.180
corrupt competition. So far, that crisis hasn't happened. But the last five years have given rise

41:39.260 --> 41:46.140
to a surge in young gambling addicts. Joe Rassillo, now 26, says his problem started in high school.

41:46.140 --> 41:51.020
Then in 2022, sports betting apps came to his home state of New York.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.540
What impact did that have? It had a big impact. I've worked my whole life. So, you know, I got

41:54.540 --> 41:59.660
to check every week, but it would deposit right into whatever app I was using. Were you interested

41:59.660 --> 42:05.900
in the game itself? I am a sports fan. But as the years grew on, you become less interested in

42:05.900 --> 42:10.300
the game itself and more interested in the result. And who needs a bookie when a fresh

42:10.300 --> 42:14.220
bet is just a swipe away? You know, you can wake up in the middle of the night, take your phone out,

42:14.220 --> 42:19.100
set an alarm for a match, maybe overseas or something like that. I would place a bet on anything,

42:19.100 --> 42:25.820
anywhere, at any time. He'd sneak in bets at family functions. He'd delete the apps one day,

42:25.820 --> 42:31.580
reinstall them the next. To help get clean, a tech downgrade. This is the phone I use on a daily

42:31.580 --> 42:36.220
basis. You can't gamble on this phone. Not too many apps on that phone, huh? No. I think people

42:36.220 --> 42:41.020
who aren't familiar might think of the typical gambling addict as, you know, the middle-aged guy

42:41.020 --> 42:45.820
and a windbreaker who's betting his retirement savings. It's more prominent in the younger

42:45.820 --> 42:50.220
generation, I think, than ever. Are they going to have to protect us from this? Are they going to

42:50.220 --> 42:58.540
have to protect us by putting a digital ID on the internet so that I don't know where this is going,

42:58.540 --> 43:02.620
but waiting till you hear the language change here. Remember, this is a very recent 60 minutes.

43:02.620 --> 43:09.660
It's like from a day a week ago or so. Sportsbooks and the commercials and the leagues themselves

43:09.660 --> 43:15.980
are making it look so cool to gamble and risk your money. There are distinct signs of trouble.

43:15.980 --> 43:20.300
According to a Sienna College poll, which we can report for the first time now,

43:20.300 --> 43:25.260
of the young men wagering online nearly half feel they're betting more than they should.

43:26.060 --> 43:31.500
In the five years since New Jersey legalized online sports gambling, calls to the state's

43:31.500 --> 43:38.220
problem gambling helpline nearly tripled. The largest color demographic, 25 to 34.

43:38.220 --> 43:44.380
This is a public health emergency happened. Sorry, what? What did he say it was?

43:46.380 --> 43:53.100
25 to 34. This is a public health emergency happening and we're not talking about it yet.

43:53.100 --> 44:00.140
Harry Levant is a game health emergency graphic. 25 to 34. This is a public health

44:00.140 --> 44:05.580
emergency happening and we're not talking about it yet. A public health emergency.

44:08.060 --> 44:14.780
A public health emergency. Imagine if the CDC gets involved in this gambling epidemic. Harry

44:14.780 --> 44:19.660
Levant is a gambling addiction therapist and leading voice on the public health impacts of

44:19.740 --> 44:24.700
online sports betting. A decade ago, Levant was a trial lawyer whose gambling addiction

44:24.700 --> 44:31.020
was so fierce he used client money to fuel his habit leading to his disbarment. In his current

44:31.020 --> 44:36.860
career, he's noticed today's desperate gambler looks and acts a lot different. I have patients

44:36.860 --> 44:41.340
who gamble in the shower. I have patients who gamble before they gather the bed in the morning.

44:41.340 --> 44:47.420
I have patients who gamble while they are driving. There are no guardrails. We scientifically know

44:47.420 --> 44:51.820
the human brain the risk reward system for a young man isn't fully formulated. That's

44:51.820 --> 44:56.620
your 25. Where are the young men getting the money to gamble like this? I have patients,

44:56.620 --> 45:01.260
some of whom are college students who have gambled federal student loan money. I have

45:01.260 --> 45:07.820
young patients who have gambled away inheritances. Levant showed us what gambling today entails.

45:07.820 --> 45:13.580
It was an NFL Sunday, though on draft Kings, the betting options extended far beyond football.

45:13.580 --> 45:21.980
Soccer, basketball, hockey, motorsports, rugby, volleyball, and there was tennis. Pedro Redenas

45:21.980 --> 45:28.620
playing Alfredo Perez in a challenger qualifying match in Charlottesville. Those are two names I've

45:28.620 --> 45:34.140
never heard before. Who is betting on this match? Two guys who are nowhere near the top 100.

45:34.140 --> 45:40.460
Because John, this is not about tennis. They're not designing them for the fans of qualifier

45:40.460 --> 45:45.260
tennis in Charlottesville. They're designed for people who want more action.

45:45.260 --> 45:51.420
The opportunities for action are literally limitless. Live in-game micro betting allows

45:51.420 --> 45:56.940
users to win. Is this any different than what they did with the opioid epidemic in America? Like

45:57.820 --> 46:04.860
just giving them away like candy prescriptions, like candy profits, like candy? They knew it was

46:04.860 --> 46:09.980
bad. They've known for decades that opioids have to be used with the strictest rules and

46:09.980 --> 46:15.500
attention. And yet somehow or another, people can have opioids in their cabinets that aren't

46:15.500 --> 46:23.900
even labeled. Now, I understand that gambling is a little bit different, but we understand how

46:23.900 --> 46:32.780
damaging it can be. When I grew up as a kid, gambling was... I mean, it's just extraordinary

46:32.780 --> 46:39.020
to me now how we talk about these things as problems, as if we're surprised. It's a public

46:39.020 --> 46:46.380
health crisis because you put gambling on people's phones. Well, no kidding. Really? I'm so surprised

46:47.260 --> 46:52.140
if you put cigarette machines that dispensed free cigarettes in high school. Do you think that

46:52.140 --> 46:59.980
might be a problem? Maybe. I don't know. If you put soda pop and candy at the food and the cafeterias

46:59.980 --> 47:04.140
of schools, do you think those kids get fatter? I don't know. Maybe. I wouldn't be

47:04.140 --> 47:08.940
surprised if they did. Would you be surprised if people ruined their lives if you made gambling

47:08.940 --> 47:19.260
something that was so easy you could do it with a swipe? Are we regulating this? Are they making

47:19.260 --> 47:26.060
us beg for regulation? Is that what they're doing here? Do they want us to feel as though our kids

47:26.860 --> 47:33.740
are under assault and that we need the big bad government to come or the big good government to

47:33.740 --> 47:42.460
come and save us from these predatory people on our phones? Give us digital IDs so that we can

47:42.460 --> 47:50.140
turn it off. I don't know what the plan is, but it's really sad how much of a big deal they're

47:50.140 --> 47:57.100
making this major on every pitch serve and snap. If you come down here, you can bet on the current

47:57.100 --> 48:02.300
drive of the Green Bay Packers. Will it be a punt, a touchdown, a turnover, or a field goal? Using

48:02.300 --> 48:08.620
algorithms powered by AI, draft Kings refreshes the odds constantly. The common fan can't possibly

48:08.620 --> 48:16.860
calculate whether it's a good bet or a bad bet, much less in real time. And so if the domain

48:16.860 --> 48:21.980
server couldn't have possibly done what it could have done to go through and take the

48:23.420 --> 48:31.420
computer generated x-ray crystallography model of the three CL protease and interface that model

48:31.420 --> 48:38.380
with all the known drugs and pharmaceuticals on the FDA catalog in less than three weeks with a

48:38.380 --> 48:48.620
volunteer team. And in reality, they knew that in the end, they were just going to say that the

48:49.500 --> 48:55.180
the AI spit out these drugs because these were the drugs they wanted it to spit out. How would

48:55.180 --> 49:04.300
it be any different? How would this AI be any different than giving you odds and knowing what

49:04.300 --> 49:13.100
you will bet, giving you odds to entice you to bet? What teams do you bet for? What teams do you

49:13.100 --> 49:17.180
bet against? Who are you watching? What are you looking for? Blah, blah, blah. Your patterns

49:17.180 --> 49:20.540
figure out what your patterns are and then give you those kinds of bets.

49:26.940 --> 49:30.940
And how vigilant would you have to be, right? How vigilant would you have to be if you check

49:31.020 --> 49:37.580
those sports scores and the app could even be lying to those people for all we know. And the AI

49:37.580 --> 49:43.180
would be very good at doing things like that with the proper programming. That's not solving

49:43.180 --> 49:52.940
goal. It's not even alpha fold level processing. And we are supposed to believe that the inevitable

49:52.940 --> 49:58.860
consequence of this is that the AI is going to become superhuman intelligence in general.

50:00.940 --> 50:05.580
And be able to move and create freely. And we're going to be screwed if we don't do it right. I

50:05.580 --> 50:13.580
mean, think about how absurd it is that that Sam Harris isn't first just advocating for AI not

50:13.580 --> 50:21.420
to be used as a weapon to deceive people out of their money. That AI stopped being used as a weapon

50:21.420 --> 50:29.740
to to control the opinions and habits of the masses like it is right now. Instead, he's warning

50:29.820 --> 50:37.100
us about an AI in the future that's going to, you know, it's really going to be smart.

50:40.700 --> 50:45.020
And so for me, that's what this distraction is all about. That's what gets revealed right here

50:46.300 --> 50:51.260
is that AI is plenty dangerous. Machine learning is plenty dangerous. When it's applied to us,

50:51.260 --> 51:01.900
it can extract our money and prey on our addictions. And in the case of social media algorithms,

51:01.900 --> 51:06.700
that's what they're doing to control our opinions and to control what we think about and control

51:06.700 --> 51:14.700
how we argue about it. And the effectiveness of these algorithms can be seen in that they can

51:14.700 --> 51:22.700
convince people to bet on play by play in football. Play by play in tennis, Senate by set in tennis.

51:26.140 --> 51:29.980
So yes, these algorithms are powerful, but it's only because humans are weak.

51:32.940 --> 51:39.100
And the actual intractable problems of the, you know, irreducible complexity and biology are not

51:39.100 --> 51:47.420
going to be tackled by this, by these, these parlor tricks of computational power. That's all

51:47.420 --> 51:54.700
they are parlor tricks of computational power. They are not actually understanding. They're not

51:54.700 --> 52:05.020
actually insight. And no more than the algorithms that are, that are harvesting the money from

52:05.020 --> 52:10.620
these people who are betting are algorithms that understand human behavior. They don't.

52:11.580 --> 52:15.660
And you're none of the people that own those algorithms are gaining any understanding of

52:15.660 --> 52:23.260
human behavior. The algorithms have optimized the extraction of money from the people who interact

52:23.260 --> 52:29.740
with the app. That's it. And it's not a very hard problem. It's not any more difficult than chess

52:29.740 --> 52:36.300
or go. And it's actually less easy to evaluate how successful they are, other than to say that

52:36.300 --> 52:40.860
they're making a lot of money. But gambling's easy. So then really is the AI that big a deal?

52:41.980 --> 52:47.660
Is the AI really that big of a deal? Does it really matter if in the end gambling is addictive?

52:48.220 --> 52:55.340
Ooh, the AI is deciding exactly how much cocaine and when to give it. And because the AI

52:55.340 --> 53:00.620
optimizes when the person gets cocaine, holy cow, do they become addicted to cocaine?

53:02.060 --> 53:07.500
It's like, well, I don't know, man. If you've got a person who wants to use cocaine and you give

53:07.500 --> 53:11.340
it to him pretty much, they're going to get addicted. It doesn't matter what. Oh, no,

53:11.340 --> 53:16.860
our AI gives it to him at exactly the right time and exactly the right doses and exactly the right

53:16.860 --> 53:22.380
optimal amount of times per day. And that's why it works much better than just regular cocaine.

53:23.020 --> 53:29.980
That would be the argument that you would make about AI. It's it makes gambling even more

53:29.980 --> 53:37.020
addictive. It makes gambling even more shitty. That's the art. That's the only argument you can make

53:37.020 --> 53:43.820
here. And I'm afraid that in a lot of these cases, that's the power of AI. You can make

53:43.820 --> 53:51.740
something a lot crappier than it was by itself. A lot more dangerous. A lot more effective at

53:51.820 --> 54:00.300
whatever it does. But that's the exact different direction than trying to understand a complexity.

54:00.300 --> 54:07.180
Understand an irreducible complexity with that strategy. It's like, no, again, I do think it's

54:07.180 --> 54:12.460
kind of close one, but not right would be to say that you can't measure the temperature in a river

54:12.460 --> 54:18.780
enough times to understand the temperature of the river. You just can't. You can measure it in a

54:18.780 --> 54:25.900
million places a million times a day. And still, you're not really going to understand it.

54:27.020 --> 54:30.620
Because there's the sun, there's the rain, there's the seasons blah, blah, blah.

54:33.100 --> 54:36.220
And they think that they can, with the help of AI,

54:38.860 --> 54:45.500
measure the temperature of our body or some aspect of our body a lot of times in a lot of places.

54:45.980 --> 54:50.940
And that'll be enough data to finally understand how this patterned integrity sings.

54:53.180 --> 54:57.580
I'm telling you, they can optimize the way people lose their money on a gambling app for sure.

54:57.580 --> 55:03.420
They can optimize the way your kids interact with an app and their friends. Absolutely. They can

55:03.420 --> 55:10.700
optimize the way or optimize the amount of depression that someone gets from TikTok as they scroll.

55:10.700 --> 55:18.540
Absolutely. But that is not even as difficult as the accomplishment of AI and Go.

55:19.900 --> 55:26.540
And it's not even close to as complicated as as what alpha fold should be if it actually could

55:26.540 --> 55:31.100
do all the things that they purported to do and all the problems that it should be able to solve.

55:33.740 --> 55:37.100
I'm not sure if I wanted to watch that anymore. Just let me let it go for a second.

55:37.100 --> 55:42.860
These numbers coming from. How do they know what the odds of Green Bay losing a fumble are?

55:42.860 --> 55:49.020
We don't know that they have access to all of the stats combined with artificial intelligence.

55:49.020 --> 55:54.540
And see artificial intelligence here just gets to do everything else. It's like this black box,

55:54.540 --> 56:00.380
very similar to how it's used with the domain server. We have this black box and we put stuff

56:00.380 --> 56:05.980
in and out comes the answers. And the answers are just, you know, what they are. So if the answers

56:05.980 --> 56:11.100
give us millions and millions of dollars, then I guess the answers must be right. It can't just

56:11.100 --> 56:17.420
be that we're selling lots of instances of gambling and gambling is a really bad idea.

56:19.740 --> 56:25.900
You understand that, right? It just has to organize the it just has to organize it in such a way so

56:25.900 --> 56:32.220
that it gets it right. And the house just has to organize those odds so that no matter how you

56:32.300 --> 56:39.100
bet you lose. And so in football, if the algorithm is just picking, it's not

56:40.060 --> 56:45.660
see that's the other thing here that I think is is being misled here is misleading here. What

56:45.660 --> 56:52.300
you're thinking of is a bookie. A bookie is a guy or a gal who has a bunch of clients and the more

56:52.300 --> 56:59.500
clients that bet on the on the Packers, then the odds go up because I can't back all those bets

56:59.500 --> 57:05.500
unless the bets that are coming in have to pay more to get less wins than the people that first

57:05.500 --> 57:09.420
started when I had the odds a little wrong or I didn't know that everybody was going to bet on

57:09.420 --> 57:17.260
the Packers. But an algorithm and an AI algorithm in a phone app doesn't have to do that. A phone

57:17.260 --> 57:22.780
app is not going to be saying, well, everybody's betting on the Packers today. So I'm just going

57:22.780 --> 57:30.780
to change that. It's going to say that already based on it's going to do it based on a whole

57:30.780 --> 57:37.100
other thing. It could even be giving different odds to different people knowing that the odds are

57:37.980 --> 57:45.980
part of the way that you decide whether to bet. And so this proprietary crap where all we can't

57:45.980 --> 57:50.380
tell you how this works, it's pretty complicated. We have all the stats and then we give it to the

57:50.380 --> 57:56.860
AI and the AI does the AI is optimizing the idea that you will bet something.

57:59.820 --> 58:07.180
And and optimizing how often you will lose. It's not optimizing how much it is we don't even know,

58:07.180 --> 58:14.540
but the point would be again that these are not intractable problems. They are not magic. It's a

58:14.540 --> 58:22.060
parlor trick with it's a parlor trick based on computational power. The ability to predict

58:22.060 --> 58:29.020
what will draw the action in. Matt's Arb Cousin is a leading gambling reformer in the UK. He is

58:29.020 --> 58:35.580
also a recovering gambling addict. I would say understand what the nature of these companies

58:36.140 --> 58:40.540
really is. They are big data companies that are extractive.

58:40.620 --> 58:44.780
Zarb Cousin successfully lobbied for stricter gambling regulations in Britain,

58:44.780 --> 58:50.780
limiting how betting companies advertise and how much gamblers can wager. He says the UK,

58:50.780 --> 58:55.820
where gambling has been legal for decades, offers a sobering glimpse into what he believes is a

58:55.820 --> 59:00.540
crisis headed straight toward the US. There's lots of opportunities to gamble in Britain,

59:00.540 --> 59:04.380
you assume it's safe, you don't realize how easy it is to get addicted to that stuff.

59:04.380 --> 59:08.860
Addiction is intensified, he says, by how much the gambling companies know about each user.

59:09.740 --> 59:14.700
Recently, Zarb Cousin was able to use Britain's public information laws to access data the

59:14.700 --> 59:21.180
betting company Flutter, owner of Fandall, had on the UK customer. That data was used to tailor

59:21.180 --> 59:25.500
offers and push notifications to keep the guy in action. What did you learn?

59:25.500 --> 59:31.740
So about 93 different data points they had on this individual were when they bet what

59:31.740 --> 59:36.300
offers worked, what inducements worked. On this particular one, he plays...

59:36.380 --> 59:41.580
So it has nothing to do with the odds of the game. It has nothing to do with booking skills,

59:41.580 --> 59:48.940
like setting the odds. We are talking about marketing here. AI marketing to get this guy to

59:48.940 --> 59:54.220
click and click again and click again. We'll give you a free bet with this much odds.

59:54.220 --> 01:00:03.100
It's not gambling, don't you see? This is an AI being unleashed on people. Yes, that's true,

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:09.180
but it's not a magic. Oh my gosh, it's about to become conscious and take over the world.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:16.460
And that's the idea. They want you to believe that this is evidence for where things are going

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.740
to go. No, this is where things are and where they will remain because this is the prison

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:28.780
that they want our kids to grow up in. Where they can control their image of the world,

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:33.980
their perception of the world based on an AI algorithm giving them what they need to see.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.860
And an AI algorithm understanding what they've already seen so what they know what they need to see.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:48.540
And that is not a very complicated propaganda algorithm if there is the idea of controlling

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:56.380
the masses and their opinions in order to make us angry or upset, confused, frustrated, or doubtful.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.380
And so the magic and scariness is not Ultron.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:12.620
The scariness is people like Sam Harris and Peter Teal and Elon Musk already applying these

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:24.060
algorithms to create dismay and despair and dissidents and doubt and division in our societies

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:31.740
and confusion about what's important and what questions are important to ask using algorithms

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:39.100
that's addict us to these apps, that addict us that are addicting to our attention

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:46.700
and that are confusing to our minds. That's already happening. And what Sam Harris wants you to

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:52.140
worry about is Ultron. And when Ultron finally gets here, now we're really going to be screwed.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:58.540
No, we're screwed right now because weaponized piles of money are using algorithms to confuse

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:06.860
us to frustrate us and to create doubt and division because they want to control, demolish all of

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.980
our Western republics, our republic and Western democracies, whatever you want to call them.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:21.020
That's what's happening here. And you can't miss it if you see how ridiculous things are. What is,

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.940
what is Brett Weinstein's role in this Brett Weinstein's role is kind of like a clown

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:37.660
in some respects for some people and some parts of this of this pyramid are meant to make fun of

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:45.020
Brett meant to make fun of the people that go somewhere with that was set up to ostensibly go

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:52.380
to Texas and go to the park there. I can't remember the name of the park. Shelby Park.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:59.580
To the park their horns or something to I guess, you know, bolster Governor Abbott's

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:06.940
basically they're playing dress up. Yeah. And we've reported that it was basically God, apparently,

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:14.300
who suggested that they go. Yeah, listen to him. And it's the, we should say the convoy seems to

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:20.380
be falling apart a little bit because of a dueling sort of charges of pedophilia. But this,

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:25.340
this woman here is one of the most frightening examples of

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:37.580
someone who is very, very, very convinced, certain in fact, that they have a better grip on reality

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:46.700
than almost anyone they know. And that the realities of progressivism and left versus right

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:58.140
is also something that she believes she understands so thoroughly that she deserves to have millions

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:06.300
of people listening to her opinions, often condescending about how people don't understand the world

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:12.940
as well as she does. And it is extraordinary the level of arrogance and conceit that's on this

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:19.820
show from both of them. But this is a person who just by her age and life experience alone can't

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:26.860
possibly know enough to be as confident as she is in what she knows. And so it really frightens me

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:33.980
because I do think it's kind of an attribute of a lot of people her age that they have been led to

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:41.020
believe that the adult world isn't that complicated that the truth is pretty simple. And now I want

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:47.500
what's mine and that the old people have kind of ruined the world and that they've been bad people

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:53.260
and we need to fix this because I'm not a bad person. It's something like that. America's bad

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:59.900
has always been bad. And Republicans and Democrats alike were used to be bad. But now the only people

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:06.780
you can possibly I don't know. Anyway, watch carefully as they ridicule Jan.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:15.580
This guy who was over in in in the Netherlands, the the bald dude, the the the guy that took them

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:24.940
to Panama. He's a former Navy SEAL. He's an interesting character, him and Brett and and Chris Martinston

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:29.500
went to the Panama Canal to look at some of these camps and whether or not we're being invaded.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.620
And they came back with a little report. And these guys are making fun of that report.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:45.740
And I'm sure you remember it before we get to that. Here is a clip of one of the speakers. He's a

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:52.220
former green beret named Michael yawn. He is at Springs dripping Springs, Texas. So they've gotten

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:57.020
close. They're close, which by the way is outside of Austin. It's not even that close to the

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:02.300
border yet. But it's in Texas. Yeah, they're in Texas though. They are in Texas. And they're migrating

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:12.380
that here is he is. Well, you can see that the border and like these to all these issues. Let me

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:19.580
put this way. The symbolism is these guys are one level below Brett Weinstein. So Joe Rogan and

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:25.340
then Brett Weinstein and all those people are on this level. And then down here is another level

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:32.220
of people. And these guys might be one level below that. They want to be up here maybe on this

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:38.380
level where Tim Poole is, but they're not quite on Tim Poole's level, but almost. And they argue

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:43.660
with Tim Poole a lot. She's been on Tim Poole's program once Sam won't go on it. I don't know.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:50.300
But Sam has been doing this for longer than her. She's a kind of a recent addition to this. But

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:58.220
Tim Poole generally supports Brett Weinstein and thinks Sam's an idiot and Sam Harris is an idiot.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:05.820
And then and these guys are generally the opposite. These two like Sam Harris and like the mainstream

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:13.260
idea and think vaccines are great and people that don't like vaccines are idiots and don't even

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.740
need to be talked to just like Sam Harris would think. And Tim Poole is of course on that other

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:23.100
side. And then they have their own little gurus up here. And then those gurus have their gurus

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:28.460
up here and somewhere up there in the middle there, Joe Rogan talks to all the gurus.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:34.620
On the right, the issues are connected. Here you go.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:52.540
Okay. We're seeing asking some across. Also, check our back home.

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.540
And they're coming across that border every day. Right.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.740
Are you listening to me?

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.900
Positive for one second. Now he's also mad that people aren't listening to him. Those people are

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:13.180
the talking. But I just wanted to make it clear that down at the Darien's Gap,

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:18.620
they and I don't know who would say, do you say Chuck Colson?

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.780
Chris Martinson.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:28.300
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if he had seen it, but he said that in Darien Gap,

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.740
which is like down near Panama, or I think it's part of Panama actually,

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.380
there are Afghans coming. Now it's quite possible. Like I said,

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.900
anything happening in Afghanistan, the last like, I don't know, a couple of decades,

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:51.100
I would there. There might be a reason why there's a certain cohort of Afghanis.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.940
See, so they they automatically then go to the well, but whose fault is it that there are

01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:01.820
Afghanis coming in through South America? Whose fault is that? That's our fault because

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:08.620
we wrecked Afghanistan. If there are Syrians, well, why wouldn't there be? We did that.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.620
And so this is a very typical take that they have. This is the bait that's on the social media

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:21.580
right now. This is the bait that's on TV. These are the kinds of people that pass for, you know,

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:30.860
dipping into the intellectual space of real politics. This is the joke that is misleading

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:35.660
our children on the internet. This is the reason why we need to get back in touch with our college

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:40.700
kids and get them to start listening to things that are a bit more on point.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:45.740
Because if they're not listening to things that are on point, they're listening to things that are

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:55.580
just absolutely gosh awful. Now, it's awful also because of course,

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:02.380
this Michael Jan guy is a sort of kind of set up for this. I feel like it's kind of set up for

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:09.260
this and it's very frustrating. And we're also talking about it here with Michael Malice. Michael

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:15.180
Malice is another bro with a show. These two guys are bros with shows. And so he's visiting

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:20.780
their bros with shows and they're having a discussion about about the world and about not

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:27.500
being cynical and about how taking a cynical point of view is kind of easy. Actually, I think

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.220
another one of those things that you're going to hear from Brett Weinstein eventually is going

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:41.580
to be very similar to what. What is that clown's name? That bald guy on Twitter that was

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:49.180
he's got isn't the guy runs does Dilbert. Isn't that who it is? Adams is that his name?

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.340
What's his name? Can you tell me it's Adams, right? It's

01:10:54.220 --> 01:11:00.780
it's but he was this guy Scott Adams. Yes. Oh my gosh. What a dense individual he is.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:08.060
He's probably going to put up Brett is probably going to put up an argument very similar to Sam

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:16.060
Adams and say Scott Adams and say that if you got COVID right from the beginning because you were

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:22.380
very cynical and you just didn't believe anything then it's not really an intellectual position to

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:30.060
take and that's basically what I think a lot of times this guy says and I like this guy a lot

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.380
more than I like Brett Weinstein. I'll be very honest with you. This guy has never rubbed me

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:40.780
really the wrong way. But with Brett, I really feel like number one, he's not going to admit

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.900
that masks don't work. He's not going to admit that masks damage children. He's not going to admit

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:53.500
that that that getting adults around the United States and around the world to submit to masking

01:11:53.500 --> 01:12:01.420
was an entirely an entirely damaging psychological operation that has made it easier the next time

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:07.020
that we are required to submit because that people didn't stand up and should have stood

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.660
up and more people should have stood up more people that should have known better should have stood

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:16.940
up. And he's one of those people that claiming all the expertise he does and all the advantages

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:23.980
of being coming from the evolutionary perspective, he didn't know Jack squat about principles.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.940
And he's still making the argument up until very recently that effective lockdowns are useful,

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:35.180
that effective lockdowns would have done something for something that amounts to

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:42.940
Iatrogenic murder, if anything. I mean, so we are far from this is far from over.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:52.460
We're one nail away from America being destroyed. What does that even mean destroyed, right? And

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:58.540
it's just and if you your perspective is that the Biden administration in two years and 51

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.180
Democratic senators can destroy America, well, it's a wrap and get out of this country because

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:08.700
you hate America because to me, it's just absurd that, you know, a country as prosperous as we are,

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:13.020
which certainly has problems. Let's let me not but speak about the rug, but to say that we're

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:18.620
two years away from our destruction to me is absolutely crazy to the point of being dishonest.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:24.860
And it's also these narratives are highly addicted. We all know and we're not going to mention

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:30.860
names, certain channels that feed and fuel a doomsday narrative, they get millions of views

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.860
and a lot of the time. Yeah, I know. Everything's shit.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:43.740
I should change the book title. Look how shit things can get and it's coming to America

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:49.900
right now. Yeah, exactly. Get your copy. But they put out the same narrative again and again.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:55.180
That doesn't seem to be very little variety in the output. You look at it and even a cursory

01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:00.380
glance will make it or once you analyse it, you realise that a lot of these arguments don't

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:06.060
have a lot of merit yet people tune in. They love it, don't they? Oh, and then you could have

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.500
and the thing is then they can say that they're being rational because they could open up any

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:15.660
newspaper and find bad news and be like, look, look, I'm not being irrational. The newspaper

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:21.660
validates my perspective. So it does become a self-fulfilling cycle. I think COVID certainly

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:27.580
allowed people who are, you know, neurotic or anxious or depressed now to externalise their

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.500
neurosis because now it's not calling from inside the house. It's the whole country or the whole

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:36.140
world that's experiencing this and how can you expect me to have any hope or vision of happiness.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:43.340
So I think it's a very useful technique if you want to conquer a people or a people's to convince

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:48.300
them that their victory over you is impossible and then you don't have to fight because they could

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.660
just go home, shrug their shoulders and be like, all right, you know, I can't win. I have no hope.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.940
The people I'm against are too powerful or been around. And that I think is a beautiful point.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:04.220
That's what they want us to feel. That's what they wanted us to feel with worst case scenario.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:09.420
You better lock down the crazy people on the internet. The really, you know, people that

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:14.060
think it's worst case scenario are saying 60 days. So you better not complain about 15.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:21.180
We can see from Deborah Birx's own book that they knew that they had to convince Trump to accept

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:25.580
15 days and they knew that if they've got him to accept 15 days in a way we're never going to

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:35.260
reopen in 15 days, they knew that Deborah Birx said that in her book. So the concept here

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:41.660
that we need to understand is that that we have been played that people who think that we have

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:48.460
been played have been played. And so Brett Weinstein may have been played. Maybe he doesn't know how

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:55.660
badly he's been played. Maybe he needs to really really reflect on who was telling him what to say

01:15:55.660 --> 01:16:05.580
when. Was he really independently wearing a mask and bandanas and goggles rather? Was he really

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:13.900
independently advocating for harder lockdowns? Was he really advocating for Ivermectin? Was he

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:19.020
really advocating for these things or was he encouraged to? And who encouraged him? And if he

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:24.060
thinks very carefully about who encouraged him, could he think of alternative reasons why they

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:30.060
were encouraging him? And has he ever considered, have any of these people ever considered the

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:37.020
possibility that the worst case scenario of a biological leak of an RNA that was capable of

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:44.220
high fidelity circulation of the globe for five years was an illusion, a mythology used against

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:50.780
us? Have they ever considered this a possibility? Brett Weinstein and his infinite wisdom as an

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:59.100
evolutionary biologist he ever considered the just the mathematical aspects of an RNA that is capable

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:07.340
of doing what they claim it has done? Starting from a puddle in Wuhan? The consideration that

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:14.220
I've been trying to get him to make in his head for like three years? No, of course they won't

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:18.700
because they're protecting this narrative. They're making sure that you ask the wrong questions

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:24.620
over and over again. Is Malice doing that? I'm not really sure. I don't really think it matters

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:29.260
because he's not really dangerous. He's not really tapping into anything that no one else

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:35.740
taps into. He's certainly not breaking any firm illusions like we're trying to do about

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:41.900
about mythologies that upon this is all based. Maybe he's going against fractional reserve banking

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.140
or something like that. But I don't think it's that really that big of a deal. So the last thing I'd

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:53.500
like to cover tonight before I go to bed is an audio leak from at the end of 2020 that hadn't

01:17:53.500 --> 01:18:00.540
been published anywhere and was published today by Sasha La Topova on her sub stack.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:10.220
It's just a six minute recording from a AstraZeneca employee apparently. And she also coupled it with

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:19.100
a Catherine Watts thing reclassifying by our weapons as identical legally. Legally identical to pandemics.

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:27.020
So we're still trying to figure out exactly the role of different governmental organizations

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:33.980
executive branch organizations and also Department of Defense organizations in this whole exercise

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:40.300
of the pandemic. And Sasha La Topova has picked up on a lot of the things that we're doing and a

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:46.140
lot of the themes that we're pushing forward. And so I'm very happy about that. And so here's Sasha

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:50.780
providing a little bit of insight into what happened at AstraZeneca and the fact that they

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:55.500
were looking for an antibody which is very interesting. And I just want to listen to this

01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.700
audio with you and see if you catch any of the things that I catch. And that I'm probably going

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.300
to go to sleep.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:11.180
Yes, sir. Has been the architect of the long acting antibody against COVID-19. Mark,

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:18.140
back to you. Excellent. So thank you for the introduction Mark. And it's really a pleasure

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.740
to share with all of you a little bit of the journey that the long acting antibody team has

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:28.380
taken in 2020. But actually our story begins back in 2017 in the basement of a quality in

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:34.780
and Tyson's corner Virginia at a Defense Department industry day. There I met Colonel Matt Hepburn

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:40.380
who was actually the architect of the pandemic prevention program or P3. And the goal of P3

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:46.540
was to go from discovering a novel virus to producing a drug in less than 60 days. Something

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:51.660
that would normally take six years at best. To me this sounded a little bit more like science

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:57.020
fiction than science. But we signed up in a small and committed and talented team of

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:02.220
virologists molecular biologists as engineers started working in 2018 on new technologies to

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:07.980
discover and manufacture antibodies against viruses. The team had actually been pretty successful on

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:14.140
the early discovery engine piece and had won a biopharma R&D award about this time last year.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:22.300
So in January we were all anxiously following emerging news coming out of China of a new disease.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:27.740
And it wasn't a surprise to me that when I got a call on February 4th from the Defense Department

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.460
here in the US saying that the newly discovered SARS-2 virus posed a national security threat.

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.940
We needed to stop everything that we were doing on our model system influenza

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:43.100
and put everything on to SARS-2. Fortunately our top two virologists Patrick and Ming were already

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:48.380
a step ahead having cloned and expressed the virus protein soon after the virus sequence was

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:56.380
published on January 21st. Okay. Holy shit balls. What did he just say? Let's look at the transcript.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:03.340
Thank goodness Sasha provides a transcript here. Fortunately we needed to stop everything.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:11.900
And we were doing on our model system and we put everything else into SARS-2. Fortunately our top

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:18.700
two virologists were already a step ahead having cloned and expressed the virus protein

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:29.180
as soon as the virus sequence was published on January 21st. Now that's some very interesting

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:37.420
language the virus protein. I think there are about 31 give or take a few depending on how you

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:45.500
divide them up. I'm sure there are more than 20. So what we're talking about here just to make

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:51.340
sure everybody's on the same page. What we're talking about here is the long acting antibody team.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:22:02.940
And he mentions the pandemic the PP3 or PPP3 program where we were supposed to do something in 60

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:14.620
days a countermeasure. Right. So that that program was what I showed over here with this other

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:22.780
sub stack which I also think is worth following. Democracy manifest sub stack is a pretty decent one

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:29.100
written by some Australians I believe and I've liked a lot of what they've written so far and they

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:36.540
actually maybe serendipitously were on this on January 5th already with pandemic

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.100
protection platform that's what it was.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.420
Prevention or protection prevention.

01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:02.860
And so I believe what he is suggesting is that AstraZeneca was already involved in the R&D

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:09.420
in 2017 because they were already involved in the pandemic prevention program. So that's

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:16.620
interesting. And then yeah so then what I was getting at was is that these top two virologists

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.260
this is just so curious to me.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:25.900
What did what did they?

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:48.940
What did they do? What did they what did they what did they clone?

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.860
So what what are they?

01:23:53.900 --> 01:24:01.020
Fortunately our top two virologists Patrick were already ahead having cloned and expressed

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.780
the virus protein soon after the virus. So what are they talking about the spike?

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.020
What what virus protein did they clone? Like it's so bizarre.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.500
Of course Robert Malone didn't clone the spike protein. Robert Malone thought it would be

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:27.100
important to make a computer generated model of the S X ray crystallography of of the three

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:33.020
cl protease which is what he told a couple different people but for sure I have

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.740
a couple recordings of him saying that I think one time to Steven Hadfield.

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:48.220
So I find it quite perplexing what what protein what viral protein should be referred to as we

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:54.860
cloned the viral protein is it all the proteins or is that like a quantity you know I'm confused

01:24:54.860 --> 01:25:00.620
by that let's let it go. Of course the task was formidable we first had to learn everything

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:06.140
we could about a new virus the immune response to the virus and a new disease called COVID-19.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:13.100
What we and others quickly learned was that the critical protein on the virus is called the spike

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:18.940
protein and this is the protein on the virus that allows the virus to infect cells by binding to

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:25.180
the ACE2 receptor and what we also learned was that it could exist in an active and inactive form

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:32.060
in the active form it expressed a special domain called the receptor binding domain or the RBD

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.580
and what we quickly figured out was the RBD was going to be the Achilles heel of the virus.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:42.700
So we decided our best strategy was to come up with two antibodies against this receptor binding

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:46.780
domain and we set out with a three-pronged approach to discover those antibodies.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:55.500
First we tried to isolate these B cells from the blood taken from COVID-19 patients.

01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:01.260
Second we immunized humanized mice with different constructs of the spike protein to elicit those

01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:07.340
magical B cells and then third we ran a huge screen using our traditional Cambridge antibody

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:12.700
technology phage display library. All in all we screened tens of thousands of antibodies

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.980
and then discovered about 1,500 that bound the spike protein and whittled it down to our top

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:24.220
100 by the end of March. The teamwork laid into the night weekends their commitment was inspiring

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:30.140
and they surprised me with their top 12 neutralizing antibodies on my birthday April 10th.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.820
The next challenge was to down select from those 12 neutralizing antibodies to our top two.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:41.660
The best way I can describe this is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle by blindfolded

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.140
but in the end the team selected two very distinct two very potent antibodies

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:51.900
that showed synergistic activity and when I say synergistic activity was 1% plus 1%

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:58.540
actually equal 93% neutralization. At the same time our protein engineers who in my mind are

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:02.940
some of the best in the world made key enhancements to the antibodies to extend their half life so

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:08.780
that a single dose could afford up to six to 12 months of protection ensure high yield production.

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.460
Some key enhancements

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.900
to increase production

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.260
and increase lifespan.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:38.300
So that is some interesting stuff so let's just I just want to break it quick break down

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.020
that quick

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:46.140
whoops that was not what I wanted and remember where we are I guess you can't see that there

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:53.180
I'll get rid of that. So top two virologists they did the viral protein we don't know what

01:27:53.180 --> 01:28:01.500
protein they did and then he states that the the faith very clearly he says you know it was a

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:07.660
very formidable task because we had to get to know a new virus we had to get to know a new immune

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:13.260
response to the virus and we had to get familiar with a new disease called COVID now this was

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:18.460
one of the more spectacular things I thought that he said because this is really

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:25.180
scripted this is really some scripted BS right here this is making sure that he hits all the

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:31.580
check marks that he's supposed to hit this is a really in my mind this is a really big admission

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:37.260
here anybody that would to go off the book and say something like this so the active form of

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.380
the spike protein

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:47.180
the active form of the spike protein this this one

01:28:50.700 --> 01:29:01.420
this one gets a little testy here I don't know why but I like this ink the active form expresses

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:08.380
the receptor binding domain so this active form seemed would seem to be the fear and cleavage

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:15.660
but we don't know for sure and he doesn't mention it which is also an interesting thing

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:20.300
because the fear and cleavage was known to a lot of people very very early on

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:29.260
just random people on the internet including people like uh like James Lyons Weiler and Yuri

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:35.500
Dagen and others that that knew already that this fear and cleavage site for some reason or another

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:41.900
was a very big deal like it was something that they they saw as evidence of a laboratory so

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.860
it's interesting that this guy who works for AstraZeneca with his two top virologists

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:51.820
they just made the viral protein whatever the viral protein is right that's here

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:55.980
they just made the viral protein but they didn't tell us what it was and then only later

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:59.100
did they all learn according to the narrative

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.180
that it was the spike protein that they needed to make and that the spike protein had an active

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:10.140
and an inactive form and that the active form had a receptor binding domain and so they wanted to

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:17.580
make an empty body cocktail was aimed at the receptor binding domain and antibody cocktail

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:23.900
is already a very interesting thing because if you are working on an antibody cocktail in 2017

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:27.660
then there was still would have been very good reason to believe that all the intellectual

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.380
property associated with the monoclonal antibodies that would be in that cocktail

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:39.980
that that intellectual property would be patentable and transitioning into the pandemic era

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:45.900
there was a number of changes that occurred to that intellectual property space as highlighted

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:56.620
by Mark Gulak's work on the antibody patent paradox and so now a a polyclonal collection

01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:02.620
of monoclonal antibodies designed to synergistically neutralize a wide variety of viruses i.e.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:15.100
a universal countermeasure for an RNA virus type is almost it is almost a a non-existent idea

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:23.580
anymore and Barrick thought it was cool the Z map product in in Canada got like awards in a

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:32.460
time magazine cover and and it was the main competitor to remdesivir Z map was the the most

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:37.660
effective countermeasure for Ebola i think or something like that mark could tell you but the

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:45.260
point is is that collections of monoclonal antibodies that synergistically worked together

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:51.420
was kind of the gold standard for what the pandemic prevention platform was looking for

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:57.740
and more importantly identifying those antibodies in a timely manner so that they could then put into

01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:03.500
uh oh you're going to hear it a bioreactor and be made in less than a hundred days here we go

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:10.540
15,000 liter bioreactors and be stable for up to one year in a refrigerator so all in all this was

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:16.620
done in just 99 days one day had a schedule so our last hurdle to overcome was activity and when I

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:24.220
say synergistic activity it was 1% plus 1% actually equal 93% neutralization at the same time our

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:29.660
protein engineers who in my mind are some of the best in the world made key enhancements to the

01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:35.980
antibodies to extend their half life so that a single dose could afford up to six to 12 months of

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:42.460
protection ensure high yield production in 15,000 liter bioreactors and be stable for up to one

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:49.900
year in a refrigerator so all in all this was done in just 99 days one day had a schedule so our last

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:54.700
hurdle to overcome was to accelerate that normal kind of two to three year early development timeline

01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.100
into two months and we basically did that by running everything in parallel

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:06.300
and making significant investments at risk two notable examples were manufacturing off

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:12.140
the chose cell pools and starting our tech transfers to our manufacturing partners before we had even

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:17.820
selected our top clones our clinical and regulatory teams worked around the clock and we dozed our

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:23.580
first patient on August 21st and I'm happy to report that we started our two phase three studies

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:29.340
prevent last week and yesterday we did our first patient in my favorite study storm chaser

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:33.820
yesterday it's really been astonishing to see how everyone in the company is pulled together

01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:37.660
and risen to the challenge and I've had the good fortune of working with everyone in biopharma

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:44.860
R&D precision medicine legal business development procurement project management ops IT commercial

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:49.740
and the all important government affairs and I'd like to just take this moment to thank everyone

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:56.140
so clearly fighting a virus like SARS 2 in a worldwide pandemic is not for the faint of heart

01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.940
but clearly we're in this fight to the finish I'm also very grateful to Pascal many in the set for

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.820
their leadership and I'm very proud to be part of a company that not only follows the science but

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:11.260
is putting patients first and doing the right thing for the whole world just like the antibody

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:17.820
we're better together and I look forward to being with many of you in a healthier and happier 2021

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:24.140
so thank you and over to you Pascal so that's um you know you can see more about this

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.460
you can listen to your for sure for yourself on sash a lot to pull with substack

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:39.500
I am it's a little bit of a broken up stream tonight didn't have a much of a prepared

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.900
talk I just really wanted to kind of hit a couple things one of them being this over-exaggeration

01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:51.820
of the power of AI and how it's already being used against us in plenty of nefarious ways

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:57.500
and that those uses are the things that everybody should be already up in arms about especially

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:03.020
with regard to our young people and our children and we're just not we're talking and everybody's

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:08.060
got us focused on Ultron and when Ultron finally gets here while we're going to have some problems

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.780
Helon Musk is telling that story Sam Harris is telling that story Brett Weinstein is telling

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:17.580
that story and it's not very much different than the worst case scenario story that they were

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:24.380
telling us about pandemic viruses before the pandemic occurred and so if some of these people were

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:30.780
taken already by this narrative then it's not necessarily their fault that they they got taken

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:38.060
by the extremely powerful psychological operation that was worst case scenario at the beginning of

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:44.620
the pandemic I apologize for being late and for not being on and for also not having a

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:50.060
sub-stack up I'm just working as hard as I can to make sure that my family gets on solid ground

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:55.420
as we move forward and now we are really we really got kicked out of a moving truck in

01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:02.300
January with lots of balls in the air and not a lot of those balls can be afforded to be dropped

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:10.540
and so I will eventually be daily I promise you on that I don't know if it's going to be

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:18.780
in the coming couple weeks or if it's going to be a little while longer but I hope I hope I hope

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:25.580
there is a possibility that that we're getting very close to being able to do it daily and during

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:35.420
the day I dig a home I think AstraZeneca manufactured the antibody found by Absolera was

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:42.940
that mentioned they may have chose to clone the Sohomish County man that's possible I'm not sure

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:51.900
I have to look it is possible that they had their own cocktail but again I just I just put this

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:58.620
video up because I wanted to give a little shout out to Sasha who's been kind of coming

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.580
around on some of the ideas and and and coming into parallel and again I've made this statement

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:08.620
many times and I'm going to keep making this statement because I do think it's true we don't

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:15.020
need to necessarily have teams we don't need to be you know wearing the same t-shirt or everybody

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:20.940
doesn't have to think that giga ohms great if we're all fighting for the same thing and we're all

01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:27.500
trying to get to the same place then necessarily our our work is going to be synergistic so I'm

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:34.460
going to take less time during the week to say pin people down on the board on what they've done

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:38.940
or what they haven't done with the exception of the people that I've already pinned to the board

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:44.380
because I do think those people belong there but the rest of the time I think the most important

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:50.460
thing in the next few weeks is going to be for us to revisit the immunology and for us to revisit

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:58.140
that history of 2019 20 and 21 and then actually revisit this biology which

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:07.020
I think will help us understand the scam of the PCR the potential scam of the sequences

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:14.220
and the potential scam of the iatrodenic deaths which were used to create the mass

01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:20.780
casualty events which have been misconstrued as spread and so I am really excited because I

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:25.500
do think that we have a lot of people paying attention and a lot of people listening and so

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.260
all we have to do is just keep our arms straight and keep our flashlights forward and keep working

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.780
and I think over the next couple weeks I'm still preparing right in the background I can't

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:43.180
I can't just you know give you a lecture on where I'm at right now with some of these concepts

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:47.340
because I really am trying to get to the point where I understand them well enough so that I

01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:51.660
can teach them once I get to the point where I understand them well enough so that I can teach

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.540
them then we can maybe make a bridge between myself and Kevin McCurnan maybe we can make a

01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:01.500
bridge between myself and the no-virus people maybe we can even make a bridge between Kevin

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:08.620
McCurnan and the no-virus people once we all can collectively talk in the same terms and discuss

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:15.020
things in the same way it may be possible that everybody will agree that wow it had to be clones

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:23.500
and and it's all lies I don't think that's gonna happen but I do think that that's that's kind of

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:30.380
where the the ultra optimist would be because I do in my gut and in my heart I do think that we

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:35.980
are so close to over the target right now that's so close and that's the reason why everybody is

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:43.340
so up in arms about it on all sides because we are about to break the illusion of virology

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:52.140
with the help of people like Sam and Mark Bailey and Tom Cowan and and and Andrew Kauffman and

01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:56.380
all the stuff that they've done over the last three years is not going to go to waste of course

01:39:56.380 --> 01:40:03.820
it's it's perfectly awesome work especially with regard to COVID and if we use that in concert with

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:09.260
the stuff that we have sort of hit upon with regard to whether or not the swarm is there and

01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:16.140
whether or not that's relevant for clones and how clones could be used to create the illusion of

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:23.340
a pandemic that would fit and check a lot of the boxes that include the idea that has Denny Rancor

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:29.900
so recently said so eloquently that you may be able to make a very cohesive argument about how

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:35.420
viruses haven't been isolated and about how viruses haven't been purified but it's more difficult

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:42.380
to make a a cohesive and and definitive argument about how these sequences are right or wrong and

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:48.940
how these sequences exist or don't exist and that's the the place where the cognitive space where

01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:57.180
virology hides right now and so I think if we can penetrate that hiding place by adequately and

01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:02.780
sufficiently describing the significance of the methodology of cloning and how much it has

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:09.340
enabled us to essentially create a field of RNA virology that otherwise would not exist simply

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:15.420
because the availability of infectious material would be so low that the field itself couldn't be

01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:23.180
sustained that's the reality that we need to explain as being irrelevant in relevance to whether

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:30.460
or not the genetic swarm is as diverse as as as crazy diverse or as relatively pure

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:37.900
implying some level of fidelity and and and either way it still doesn't change the fundamental

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:45.740
biology of RNA versus DNA and doesn't change the fundamental biology of how a lip lipoprotein

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:51.900
genetic signal is not a pattern integrity it's just not and so once we get there

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:57.580
I really think that there's going to be a lot less arguing a lot less complaining a lot less

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:03.980
vitriol because there's going to be two things either we start working toward a common understanding

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:10.060
or people will just ignore us because there won't be a discussion anymore there won't be any discussion

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:15.260
to have they'll just ignore us and so we're getting very close to that already happening and

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:21.900
we're getting there because so many people have risen to the occasion and I don't have them all

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:29.980
on this list right now because like I said I'm trying to get everything all my ducks in a row

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:36.860
when I have an opportunity to consult I'm consulting right now and that means that I have had a few

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:43.100
hours of work to do during the day and that has precluded a little bit of like things like

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:48.300
updating this list and has precluded beginning a new sub stack up there will be a new sub stack

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:56.780
up tomorrow and I put another video up with with the transcript in with the with the subtitles

01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:02.780
and again all this work is possible because of these people taking the risk to support my work

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:09.100
and my family with a subscription all of these people have been given a free paid subscription

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:14.380
you know whatever lifetime paid subscription to sub stack so you can support me on sub stack I'm

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:20.460
not discouraging anyone from doing that but if you subscribe through giggleomebiological.com

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:26.540
then I'll my wife and I will push that through to sub stack so that you get that too sub stack

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:32.700
is not wasn't really meant to be a way for people that were already supporting me to support

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:38.860
me more it was more of a way of people that weren't supporting me to more easily step over into the

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:46.060
on onto the team and so we're trying to get around a thousand subscribers one way or another because

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:54.300
I think between yeah well that I don't know if you know how a business works like a LLC

01:43:55.180 --> 01:44:00.780
but you got to pay a lot of taxes and so there there's a certain amount of subscribers that

01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:05.420
we're going to need in order to keep this going and I think a thousand is a little bit more than

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:11.100
we would need but a thousand would be a pretty solid hovering state where I think I could sustain

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:15.900
this almost indefinitely we might be able to make a high school curriculum and we can definitely

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:21.580
teach biology regularly once we get our feet underneath us so thank you very much for subscribing

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:29.020
it's GigaOMbiological.com it's also GigaOMbiological on Twitch it's also GigaOMbiological on sub stack

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:35.580
and it's also GigaOM.bio on the internet for that soapbox thing thank you very much for joining me

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:43.020
and I will see you again tomorrow this has been the intellectual independent bright web and Mark

01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:48.540
is still revamping his studio but I suspect that he's going to be back shortly and that's going to

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:54.140
be also very exciting so thanks thanks very much sorry it was so broken up but yeah you know

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:58.540
that's how it goes a little impromptu study halls we're going to do more of those until we get the

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.860
lectures going again and the PDFs coming again thank you very much and I'll see you tomorrow

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:10.540
I guess I could play the out though I could play the music out. I could play the music out

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:14.620
you can definitely do that

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.380
see you tomorrow

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:52.380
so

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:18.420
I'm not going to leave you hanging on this.

01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:22.820
We are going to tell this story.

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:28.580
We are going to make it into a written form that you can share with your family and friends.

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:34.420
Just like we did with the review, we are going to dispel this faith in a written form.

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.380
Thank you very much for the encouragement, Jenny Rancor.

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:48.420
I think we are less than a week out and then stuff is going to happen.

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.180
I'm going to put my slides up on substac too but they don't move on substac so it's a

01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:59.460
little annoying because not all of my substac or not all of my slides really translate to

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.500
that but I will try sooth spider.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.900
I haven't not thought about that.

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:07.180
I used to put my slides up all the time but now that they are so layered it's a little

01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:08.780
trickier anyway I'll see you tomorrow.
