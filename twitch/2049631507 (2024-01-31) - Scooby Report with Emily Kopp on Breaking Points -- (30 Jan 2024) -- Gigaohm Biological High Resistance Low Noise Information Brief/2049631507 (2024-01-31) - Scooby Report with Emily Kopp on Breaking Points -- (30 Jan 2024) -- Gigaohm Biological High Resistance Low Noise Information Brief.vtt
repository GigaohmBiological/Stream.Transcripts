00:00.000 --> 00:29.520
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important

00:29.520 --> 00:35.640
ones you know until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone you know and you know it's not

00:35.640 --> 00:41.600
it's you know measles plus and okay I can tolerate what you think about measles because you know not

00:41.600 --> 00:48.760
that many people die from it it's just a big hassle in the end but no one when we have this

00:48.760 --> 00:59.280
new pandemic that is you know got 75% mortality and it's not it's that there'll be no pretense

00:59.360 --> 01:05.840
of being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be and this

01:05.840 --> 01:17.000
is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another I mean so so the next

01:17.000 --> 01:21.480
thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of

01:21.480 --> 01:28.160
America the American people is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to

01:28.160 --> 01:35.960
ruin maybe America I don't know crash the dollar I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited

01:35.960 --> 01:43.360
treasury value we have left I don't know but I know for sure that they are combining our lack of

01:43.360 --> 01:50.200
biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to

01:50.200 --> 01:56.680
create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more

01:56.680 --> 02:06.000
importantly never be possible just like the Patriot acted 911 highly profitable control mechanisms

02:06.000 --> 02:13.160
based on immunity are the near term goal I believe this firmly now there are too many people talking

02:13.160 --> 02:19.000
about it in the mainstream media hinting at it sound you hear is a single cicada there are no

02:19.000 --> 02:26.360
crickets highly profitable control mechanisms I'm talking about apps that you have to have and maybe

02:26.360 --> 02:31.440
even worse in order to cross state lines in order to go to work maybe in order to go to the store

02:31.440 --> 02:37.400
you're going to have this happen so there's going to be technology that's need to be distributed

02:37.400 --> 02:42.800
there's going to be laws that are going to be need to be passed there's going to be all kinds of

02:42.800 --> 02:49.160
products that are need to be sold and the whole idea is going to be to sell you on the idea that

02:49.160 --> 02:55.040
antibodies are the only evidence of immunity and the only way to get antibodies is to get this

02:55.040 --> 03:01.440
vaccine because a lot of people of course are not showing long lasting antibody levels so even the

03:01.440 --> 03:06.240
people who've been infected and that's what they're hyping right now is that you can get infected

03:06.240 --> 03:11.400
again this is the narrative they're bringing to you so that they're going to tell you the only way

03:11.400 --> 03:18.680
we're going to be sure is that if everybody gets vaccinated I should also point out that our viewers

03:18.680 --> 03:24.200
will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked and I should point out that actually we are in

03:24.200 --> 03:30.560
an interesting sense a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar so if I'm

03:30.560 --> 03:36.600
correct you Robert have had COVID I've had COVID and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna all

03:36.600 --> 03:44.320
right Steve you have been vaccinated fully vaccinated with Moderna all right I am unvaccinated but I am

03:44.320 --> 03:49.760
on prophylactic ivermectin and the data actually shocking as this will be to some people the data

03:49.760 --> 03:56.320
suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from

03:56.320 --> 04:03.320
contracting COVID when taken properly so aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't

04:03.320 --> 04:09.640
real and I have every reason to think it was it certainly appears to be the genuine article I

04:09.640 --> 04:15.160
believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity where through

04:15.160 --> 04:22.720
three different routes COVID vaccine and Ivermectin we are protected and you are doubly protected so I

04:22.720 --> 04:27.640
would just say that for anybody who's enthusiastic about the vaccines if you're unconvinced by what we

04:27.640 --> 04:32.720
have to say about the hazard of them one thing to consider is that the way to get society to herd

04:32.720 --> 04:38.400
immunity and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction which ought to be our goal the way to do it is to

04:38.400 --> 04:43.760
get people into this category one way or the other whether that's through prophylaxis whether it's

04:43.760 --> 04:50.440
through a vaccine or whether it's because they've had COVID already one could argue that if everybody

04:50.440 --> 04:58.040
just took Ivermectin for a month worldwide really independent some will find the title that I have

04:58.040 --> 05:05.080
given this episode perplexing I would ask them to stick with the episode through the end and I will

05:05.080 --> 05:11.520
explain why I titled it as I did I really believe that actually we have the capacity at any moment

05:11.520 --> 05:18.920
we decide to utilize it to end the pandemic and that it is it is well within reach should we choose to

05:18.920 --> 05:34.040
see what is in front of us how's that look is that alright we got a little synchrony there hopefully we

05:34.040 --> 05:41.160
have a little sink and we're ready to go it was a very phony three part play indeed very phony

05:41.160 --> 05:46.920
three part play thank you very much good sink here we go

06:34.040 --> 06:41.180
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're

06:41.180 --> 06:45.840
essentially a worst case scenario I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with

06:45.840 --> 06:49.320
essentially a worst case scenario

06:53.320 --> 07:02.360
mark at a head of a good video this morning at about 7 45 or 7 30 Eastern Standard Time you

07:02.360 --> 07:06.800
got to be a real wide awake if you're gonna follow mark and try to catch him live that was

07:06.800 --> 07:12.320
that was some some sticking and moving very good

07:12.320 --> 07:25.320
video is going on French British Italian Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing

07:32.360 --> 07:38.400
time follow my structure keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it

07:38.400 --> 07:48.320
this is so crazy like this is so crazy I feel so nervous like what in the world man

08:08.400 --> 08:19.760
so we are still trying to dispel this enchantment because the illusion is still coming on strong

08:19.760 --> 08:29.360
the latest thing is a woman by the name of Emily cop who works for the US right to know and they

08:29.360 --> 08:37.240
have acquired some new new FOIA documents that have convinced them that they have really solved the

08:37.240 --> 08:46.080
mystery once and for all the Scooby-Doo mystery is solved and the bad guys have but unmasked and we can

08:46.080 --> 08:52.200
cook our muckoo guy pan but I don't think we can I don't think it's time for a celebration I don't

08:52.200 --> 08:59.840
think it's time for Chinese food just yet and that's that's what I'm most concerned about I don't think

08:59.840 --> 09:08.840
we're ready for that yet I'm a little bit behind on this little slide deck but that's all right we are

09:08.840 --> 09:13.720
trying not to mislead the young around here and we're trying to make everybody aware of this this

09:13.720 --> 09:22.640
intentional manipulation conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits and our opinions because

09:22.640 --> 09:29.160
that's why we're here it's not because of a spreading RNA pathogen that's not why we're here

09:29.160 --> 09:41.320
it's really not it's because listen here buddy poke poke poke listen here buddy it's because some

09:41.320 --> 09:53.640
people don't see even when they're shown even when they're shown I don't see anyone else able to

09:53.640 --> 09:59.520
see that head flying around or did I add that in there for nothing can you see that that guy coming

09:59.520 --> 10:20.480
okay I hope someone could see that I heard a really interesting discussion between watching

10:20.480 --> 10:26.720
the theater today watching the theater today and I listened to a very interesting discussion

10:26.720 --> 10:38.040
between Brett Weinstein and this guy Marek no malice and they discussed whether or not Bobby

10:38.040 --> 10:46.680
Kennedy was a sociopath and Brett Weinstein is making a pretty hard argument for for Bobby being

10:46.680 --> 10:51.880
a good candidate for president it's a really interesting time it's a really interesting time

10:52.320 --> 11:02.520
because I have brushed I am I have shaken hands with a lot of interesting people during this drama

11:02.520 --> 11:07.840
and not a lot of them have a great reaction to me I guess I've got some kind of some kind of

11:07.840 --> 11:16.200
negative polarity about me maybe it's the patch clamp physiology that's still stuck in my hands I am a

11:16.200 --> 11:25.000
patch clamp Jedi master retired and Giga ohm is a term from that kind of biology that kind of

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
investigation and that's why I've also named my website Giga ohm biological and you can also find

11:31.000 --> 11:39.280
me to chat at Giga ohm.bio you can find my confession at the Scooby-Doo link up there at the top you can

11:39.280 --> 11:45.840
also find a one-time support link they're a a schedule down here at the bottom that isn't

11:45.840 --> 11:53.240
updated yet because they're and a place to leave a voicemail you could send me an email and you

11:53.240 --> 11:58.800
can also subscribe and right now we are on a campaign to try and get that number of subscribers

11:58.800 --> 12:05.760
up around a thousand because I think that's what we need to swing this this bat repeatedly nine

12:05.760 --> 12:14.400
innings a night five games a week and so far I've got quite a few people on board with this idea

12:14.400 --> 12:20.080
since I've started to ask for it I have been working for children's health defense and before that I

12:20.080 --> 12:26.800
was a private consultant for Bobby on his book and so I haven't been asking for support that much

12:27.440 --> 12:33.520
over the last year or so and starting on January 4th I've decided while my family's decided that

12:33.520 --> 12:41.200
we're going to need some money and so we are not taking unemployment we did not sign an NDA and

12:41.200 --> 12:48.240
take the eight thousand dollar severance pay but we put ourselves in the hands of people like Greg

12:48.240 --> 12:55.040
James and others and so far so good but really if this is going to be a sustainable thing I need

12:55.040 --> 13:02.000
some people to subscribe to take the risk have given me ten bucks a month and you know you do it

13:02.000 --> 13:05.760
for lots of other people at least some people do and so I don't think it's a crazy thing

13:06.560 --> 13:10.800
to think that gig home biological can establish a sort of independent bright web

13:12.400 --> 13:18.640
you know and a thousand people on the internet it's not that many and I know I know that we can

13:18.640 --> 13:23.440
share it enough to get to get it far enough for this to be meaningful enough to enough people

13:24.160 --> 13:30.640
so that this is sustainable I just know it so if we can just fix this problem

13:32.960 --> 13:38.320
that would be really great this this idea that a laboratory or bad cave virus zone knows this

13:38.320 --> 13:46.000
happened five years ago or four full years ago I'm sure we can fix this I'm sure we can crack this

13:46.080 --> 13:48.400
faith thank you

13:52.400 --> 13:54.640
I'm sure we can crack this faith

14:03.760 --> 14:08.160
got to explain the biology of course that would underlie a background signal we got to explain

14:08.160 --> 14:13.440
the biology that might underlie a hot PCR background we got to explain the biology where

14:14.080 --> 14:18.720
sequencing might might be able to pull some of these signals up we can't just say it's all

14:19.520 --> 14:24.720
it's all an illusion because that's really a cop out that's really not possible we haven't

14:24.720 --> 14:28.480
been looking at nothing for the last 50 years

14:32.080 --> 14:37.920
now we could be very very wrong don't get me wrong that we could be very very wrong about what

14:37.920 --> 14:45.440
viruses or virus and virology is I guarantee we are but the idea that there is no signal at this

14:45.440 --> 14:52.800
times at this size scale that there are no genetic noise signals at this size scale is a pretty bold

14:52.800 --> 14:58.320
assumption at this stage I think it's more likely that there are signals at this size scale that have

14:58.320 --> 15:05.680
been then confounded as as as pathogens have been distorted as pathogens when in fact there's

15:05.680 --> 15:14.320
probably a whole a whole bouquet of of of living signals at that timescale where where

15:16.720 --> 15:22.320
tissues are communicating with other tissues and and even conspecifics are communicating with

15:22.320 --> 15:26.800
other conspecifics so we're going to break this I guarantee we're going to break this

15:27.920 --> 15:33.360
this is we got we got let it off at the side of the road and we got into the wrong car because

15:33.440 --> 15:40.320
there was no car to get into it's been only very recently that I've been able to come in contact

15:40.320 --> 15:47.200
with somebody like Jessica Hockett actually find somebody who has corroborative evidence from a

15:47.200 --> 15:53.760
completely different angle that this elephant is as big as we think it is a lot like Mark Koolack

15:53.760 --> 15:58.880
and I found ourselves kind of coming at this elephant from very different sides and then also

15:58.880 --> 16:06.240
seeing the biology from very different sides but seeing the same thing it's been a lot of fun

16:06.240 --> 16:13.440
and also terrifying because there is a spectacular commitment to lies that we come up against every

16:13.440 --> 16:19.840
time we think we're trusting somebody it turns out that they're I don't like the word I know Eddie

16:19.840 --> 16:25.600
doesn't like the word but you know they're liars they're people that are are absolutely committed

16:26.160 --> 16:31.360
and they'll lie right to your face sometimes for a whole week long boat cruise off the coast of

16:31.360 --> 16:36.320
Turkey they'll lie right to a whole boat full of people's face that's what I'm talking about

16:41.440 --> 16:48.480
so we are over the target here at Gigo and biological it is the 31st of January it looks like I got

16:48.480 --> 16:55.120
my stream uh labeled right here on the slide but not right on twitch I'll fix that on the post

16:55.120 --> 17:02.160
edit trying to pound down a little bit this peppermint tea here and get my voice back

17:02.960 --> 17:04.400
let me switch over to the main

17:08.480 --> 17:12.960
good evening ladies and gentlemen this is Gigo and biological a high resistance low noise

17:12.960 --> 17:17.760
information brief brought to you by a biologist my name is Jonathan Cooley I am that biologist

17:17.760 --> 17:22.560
coming to you live from Pittsburgh in the back of my garage it is again as I said the 31st of

17:22.640 --> 17:29.120
January 2024 you are lucky enough to see me at the one rare occasion every once in a while where

17:29.120 --> 17:35.360
I'm wearing my my favorite basketball jersey the Larry Bird Indiana state number 33

17:38.240 --> 17:42.560
I don't know why I'm wearing I know why I'm wearing and I went to the gym tonight and the

17:42.560 --> 17:46.880
boys team was going to be there and so I've been I've been wearing my jerseys when I go to

17:47.520 --> 17:52.720
go to shoot around with them and so this is the independent this is the independent bright web

17:53.440 --> 17:57.440
um I don't know who else is a member of the independent bright web but it it ain't me

17:58.320 --> 18:05.600
it made me alone um but uh yeah there there are uh

18:08.560 --> 18:13.520
there are lots of people out there that are misleading the young and we need to stop that

18:13.600 --> 18:18.400
from happening we need to start to teach the young that there is this machine out there and

18:18.400 --> 18:25.360
what is this machine we need to teach them this I'm going to drop this out

18:27.440 --> 18:32.880
we need to teach them about this machine they need to understand that this machine is there

18:32.880 --> 18:37.120
that it is targeting them through their phone but also through the television also through these

18:37.120 --> 18:42.880
algorithms and they need to understand that this is not a machine that just recently came into

18:42.880 --> 18:49.440
existence because AI is now helping us it's not a machine that recently came into existence

18:49.440 --> 18:54.080
because we started censoring a few people like Robert Malone and Alex Berenson

18:57.120 --> 19:02.800
it is a machine that has been in place since the 20s and been ever honed and perfected

19:04.240 --> 19:11.920
and now it has come into a new level of power with respect to social media and then us being

19:11.920 --> 19:16.560
left on the side of that road at the start of the pandemic with only social media and mainstream

19:16.560 --> 19:24.320
media to feed us our reality and so if there was ever a time when this invisible government

19:24.320 --> 19:25.920
was in charge it's now

19:29.920 --> 19:33.920
what do I got here coming up for slides am I supposed to be down there already I guess

19:33.920 --> 19:35.360
I'm supposed to be down there already

19:36.240 --> 19:42.880
so that's where we are right the principle of informed consent has been ignored for the

19:42.880 --> 19:46.560
duration of the pandemic the way they got away with it is because they've controlled the narrative

19:46.560 --> 19:52.080
they've controlled who's in front of you they've controlled the people that you see the arguments

19:52.080 --> 19:56.240
that you listen to and the debates that you think you participate in in your head

19:59.440 --> 20:04.800
and by doing so the spread of bad ideas has become much more dangerous than the spread of any RNA

20:04.800 --> 20:06.480
molecules that's for sure sure

20:10.240 --> 20:15.920
and there are some good ideas spreading around too uh social octopova seems to be

20:15.920 --> 20:22.960
picked up on the idea that this could be largely a fake PCR pandemic a fake pandemic with protocols

20:22.960 --> 20:29.760
she's picked up on the idea that um it could be poisoning she's picked up on the idea that uh

20:29.760 --> 20:32.960
there are lab leaks before so there could be a hot background

20:34.960 --> 20:39.120
she's picked up on the idea that number of the participants are winning and unwitting

20:39.120 --> 20:42.720
participants it's not all people going along with it which is really nice

20:43.440 --> 20:49.120
she's a little bit harsh on on Bobby because he's not quite there yet with the no pandemic thing

20:49.120 --> 20:54.720
which is also pretty cool and then of course she reminds everybody of James Giordano as far as I'm

20:54.720 --> 21:01.840
concerned I should just step off my work is done here except she doesn't really cover the

21:01.840 --> 21:07.520
infectious clone idea the swarm idea and the implication that what that means is that pandemics

21:07.520 --> 21:15.360
can't really occur and I think that's where we are at this very moment this spec in time this

21:16.000 --> 21:23.440
moment in history in giga ohm biological and in this pandemic narrative that's where we are

21:24.960 --> 21:33.680
we have people who believe that there is biology of a coronavirus quasi-species swarm which support

21:33.680 --> 21:41.920
the idea of pandemic spread there are people that support the idea that if you made clones that they

21:41.920 --> 21:50.240
would spread and there are people who have the idea that nothing spread nothing can move nothing

21:50.240 --> 21:58.320
is of high enough fidelity to spread and this is all a hoax and so in reality we haven't moved

21:58.320 --> 22:03.280
very far because the people are always trying to force me and all of us to decide whether

22:03.280 --> 22:08.080
we're no virus people oh I thought you were a no virus person is what I heard this morning before

22:08.080 --> 22:12.560
I got out of bed I checked my phone and one of the first things that I heard was that somebody

22:12.560 --> 22:19.120
thought I was a no virus person somebody that I'd already had email contact with previous months

22:19.120 --> 22:27.600
and had this exact argument before that saying that clones are a way of getting a viral sequence

22:27.600 --> 22:33.680
to be in the same place all around the world at the same time and cause the illusion of mass spread

22:34.240 --> 22:37.600
it's not the same thing as saying you're in a no virus team

22:40.320 --> 22:44.160
and yet half the people jump to that conclusion and the other half of the people jump to the

22:44.240 --> 22:49.600
conclusion that you think it was released everywhere and they put it in the engines of airplanes in

22:49.600 --> 22:56.160
its chemtrails and that's how they spread it all around the world is with chemtrails for years

22:56.160 --> 23:03.360
or something like that and so we're gonna have to become really good at it or because we can't

23:03.360 --> 23:09.440
rely on these people to get the idea right these people are too busy working hard and dying rich

23:14.560 --> 23:19.760
and so the pandemic was created with a previous scientific program scheduled of

23:20.880 --> 23:27.680
publications and grant applications and and potential pre-pandemic potential viral results

23:28.800 --> 23:33.120
also with exercises at the government levels to make sure that these people understood that

23:33.120 --> 23:38.640
the potential was being created that a potential had been identified and then at the start of the

23:38.720 --> 23:44.240
pandemic you had to have a team of people that was ready to make sure that the consequences

23:44.240 --> 23:50.720
of the lockdowns and the consequences of the protocol changes and the consequences of the

23:50.720 --> 23:56.720
do not resuscitate orders and all of these things would be confounded with the consequences of the

23:56.720 --> 24:03.120
spread of this worst case scenario gain a function virus we're not sure but it sure seems that way

24:03.120 --> 24:05.440
although we can't tell anybody on tv that yet

24:08.880 --> 24:13.680
and so on top of that of course everybody that was read in everybody that understood where we were

24:13.680 --> 24:17.840
from a national security perspective was already locked into a narrative they couldn't actually

24:17.840 --> 24:22.880
tell you what they thought they had to stick to the worst case scenario because that's the way

24:22.880 --> 24:28.480
they were going to get compliance that was part of the plan and so it's totally okay from the

24:28.560 --> 24:36.720
perspective of the US government and from the whatever sort of national security i keep saying

24:36.720 --> 24:41.920
national security priority because i don't even really know what to call it but but to have a

24:41.920 --> 24:47.520
team worst case scenario of actors in places all around the internet making sure that when somebody

24:47.520 --> 24:53.680
asked you said well a billion people could be dead and the knock on consequences of a billion

24:53.680 --> 24:59.440
people dying with all the families and working and companies it could be just devastating the

24:59.440 --> 25:06.880
whole economy could collapse of course i had somebody telling me that in private streams for

25:06.880 --> 25:15.680
five weeks straight at the beginning of the pandemic and so after four continuous you to

25:15.680 --> 25:24.000
continuous years of this in our fifth year most mouth breathing skilled tv watchers have

25:24.000 --> 25:30.800
come to the conclusion that the virus and the spike protein transfection are basically capable

25:30.800 --> 25:37.440
of hurting you in many of the same ways and it's unfortunate that we rushed it it's unfortunate

25:37.440 --> 25:42.160
that we didn't know back then that this was a laboratory gain of function virus otherwise we

25:42.160 --> 25:45.600
probably wouldn't have used the spike protein which was a gain of function protein

25:47.280 --> 25:53.200
that's where we are with this thing that's where where the the skilled tv watching people are they

25:53.200 --> 25:59.200
have not gotten to the stage where they understand the biology which underpins these statements

26:00.640 --> 26:01.520
not even close

26:04.800 --> 26:10.560
and so again it's about this pandemic potential that's accessible in laboratories in order to

26:10.560 --> 26:18.480
invert our sovereignty i know our freedom to permissions these people are involved in it

26:18.480 --> 26:28.000
there is a network of people pentagon driven governance that was in place before the pandemic

26:28.000 --> 26:37.200
that was just just activated at the start of the pandemic to control the narrative so we were here

26:37.520 --> 26:44.640
uh i don't know a half a year ago already where we found these endo nucleus fingerprints

26:44.640 --> 26:54.320
indicating a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 i wrote an article with uh robert f Kennedy jr and a

26:54.320 --> 26:59.440
guy by the name of charles rixie who actually fell asleep in the middle of the night and didn't

26:59.440 --> 27:04.640
really help write this article but he was invited to be an author on it and we didn't bother to take

27:04.640 --> 27:10.560
him off and here is an article that i wrote where the diffuse proposal

27:12.160 --> 27:20.160
diffuse proposal which is a leaked darpa proposal supposedly submitted by eco health alliance in

27:20.800 --> 27:28.720
2018 or 2019 before the pandemic about engineering coronaviruses with fear and cleavage sites these

27:29.280 --> 27:34.720
this signature that for almost a year and a half we argued about whether or not that signature

27:34.720 --> 27:41.600
indicated that it was a lab leaked virus fauci absolutely denied it christian christian

27:41.600 --> 27:46.560
anderson absolutely denied it all kinds of people argued about it for a year and a half

27:47.200 --> 27:52.640
then comes out this paper about the endo nucleus fingerprint that might indicate that it's a lab

27:52.640 --> 27:59.920
oriented or originated virus and so we wrote a paper about it it was like a really big deal

27:59.920 --> 28:03.200
we had to write it right now we wanted to get it out and get it ahead of everybody

28:04.560 --> 28:07.120
we got the nocium methodology in here

28:10.160 --> 28:17.920
and so i know what this was about i knew that this was sort of hand in hand with the diffuse

28:17.920 --> 28:23.120
proposal which i had already argued for many many months had to be fake

28:25.200 --> 28:32.960
and it was a very very convenient set of words on a piece of paper actually in a pdf without

28:32.960 --> 28:42.080
metadata that made it very convenient story about everything that they had said for a year and a

28:42.080 --> 28:49.040
half about what were the circumstantial evidence for it to be a lab leak and then lo and behold

28:49.040 --> 28:56.960
look what i found i found a list of things that the bad guys were going to do and their whole plan

28:56.960 --> 29:07.120
is written right here and so when it first came out i kept saying this and when they wrote we wrote

29:07.120 --> 29:11.760
this paper i was still saying it behind the scenes i was still trying at this stage at this time

29:11.840 --> 29:16.480
was when i figured out what clones really were and i was able to really explain it for the first

29:16.480 --> 29:23.920
time and i didn't get it in this article stay tuned it says on the bottom didn't get it in the book

29:23.920 --> 29:30.960
as well as i wanted to but it's in the book and it doesn't matter because cena bovari has written

29:30.960 --> 29:36.000
it up in his own peer-reviewed paper you know and there are and there are reviews from the 90s that

29:36.080 --> 29:40.800
say why infectious clones are so valuable to RNA virology

29:44.400 --> 29:49.360
and so that's really what's ruined my life not speaking out what's what's ruined my life is

29:49.360 --> 29:55.840
speaking out about the diffuse proposal and calling it a fake what's really ruined my life is calling

29:55.840 --> 30:02.880
the diffuse proposal a fake because clones don't do that RNA doesn't do that you can make clones

30:02.880 --> 30:08.160
and spray it into bad caves it's totally okay some of those bats might even get viruses and they

30:08.160 --> 30:13.040
might even express and they might even inoculate the bats or whatever they want to do my work

30:13.840 --> 30:19.840
that's not going to cause a pandemic no way no how you could get a truckload of it you could

30:19.840 --> 30:23.840
put it in different places and tell people that a pandemic was underway

30:26.320 --> 30:31.360
but but you can't create one you can't spill enough in one place for it to go

30:31.360 --> 30:38.800
everywhere on earth and it's interesting because about a week ago Robert Malone promoted Kevin

30:38.800 --> 30:48.080
McCurnan talking about diffuse and the endo nuclei sites and emily cops release from uh sorry

30:48.080 --> 30:57.040
a foria request fulfillment um while working for us right to know so did ark medic so did the

30:57.120 --> 31:03.520
unacceptable jessica rose and so i find it really cool because i've been working on trying to get

31:03.520 --> 31:09.520
RNA and RNA clones to be real again and these people are working really hard to make diffuse

31:09.520 --> 31:16.320
real again and diffuse is important because diffuse is basically the way that they're going to try

31:16.320 --> 31:23.200
and cover up this whole mess diffuse is going to be a way for them to sort of say checkmate

31:23.200 --> 31:28.480
you don't want to argue about it but it this this document that's what they're going to argue

31:28.480 --> 31:35.440
this document makes makes the origin of the virus the ultimate or not the ultimate but the most

31:35.440 --> 31:43.360
important the most important issue and so once the diffuse proposal becomes real

31:44.160 --> 31:50.080
and the likelihood of it being a manufactured pandemic that then spread around the world and

31:50.080 --> 31:55.200
is still spreading and we might be stuck with it forever then it becomes something that needs

31:55.200 --> 32:00.560
to be solved from the perspective of who did this who leaked this who who broke this

32:03.200 --> 32:06.080
and we're going to be stuck in this hamster wheel for another five years

32:07.760 --> 32:14.080
but if we break this now if we break this faith in a novel virus if we break this idea that

32:14.720 --> 32:20.880
I just heard I think we're going to hear it here again when we watch these things I think I heard

32:20.880 --> 32:28.160
2017 million people how many million people was it I mean it's going to blow your mind what we hear

32:28.160 --> 32:36.880
here so where we are is we're trying to solve this we're trying to stop ourselves from getting

32:36.880 --> 32:41.680
sucked into solving this mystery we're trying to pull people out of solving this mystery and now

32:41.680 --> 32:47.040
I'm going to show you two different interviews with the same person who I think practically might

32:47.040 --> 32:54.400
as well either be Velma or Daphne instead of calling her Emily we should call her Velma or Daphne

32:54.400 --> 33:00.640
because she is solving this Scooby-Doo mystery and she can barely keep up the details

33:01.840 --> 33:06.720
she's barely got a grasp on them she can put the words in the right order but if you had to get her

33:06.720 --> 33:11.040
on a whiteboard and have her explain it in three different sets of words it would be pretty tough

33:11.840 --> 33:18.960
so let's see what we're gonna do let's see what we got I'm not trying to to to jam uh jam her

33:18.960 --> 33:26.480
up or anything like that I'm just saying she's a young lady um she doesn't know that much about

33:26.480 --> 33:33.840
virology she's not a biologist and so sometimes you can hear just clinging clinging to it barely

33:33.840 --> 33:38.720
able to explain it so this one is from five days ago and then the next one will be from four days

33:38.800 --> 33:45.520
ago what's going on why is that not sounding joining us now is Emily cops she's a reporter

33:45.520 --> 33:50.320
at us right to know she's done some of the best work that there is on the lab leak hypothesis on

33:50.320 --> 33:54.000
that investigation she's joining us now for our latest report thank you so much for joining us

33:54.000 --> 33:58.320
Emily great to be here absolutely so we've covered your work here for a long time and we have one

33:58.320 --> 34:03.040
of your latest that we can put up there on the screen let's see it us scientists proposed to make

34:03.040 --> 34:09.280
viruses with unique features of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan all right so uh it's a headline of which is

34:09.280 --> 34:13.840
you know we've got a little bit of uh some jargon in there unique features SARS-CoV-2 I think that's

34:13.840 --> 34:18.480
COVID Wuhan I think I'm a little bit familiar some of our viewers probably know but just break this

34:18.480 --> 34:23.440
down for the average person they have a little bit of familiarity with COVID with the lab leak

34:23.440 --> 34:28.400
and more what did you find in this report he's so out of place that's a little bit of an understated

34:28.400 --> 34:33.280
headline I'll give you that but um takeaway is origins of COVID solved question mark

34:34.720 --> 34:40.560
basically what we found is that some of the most unusual features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

34:40.560 --> 34:47.280
the things that made SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 the most pathogenic virus of the last 100 years

34:47.840 --> 34:54.240
were I mean they're very rare in nature but they were essential to the esoteric research

34:54.240 --> 34:57.520
kidding me of the what did she just say central

35:01.840 --> 35:07.600
the most unusual features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome the things that made SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2

35:07.600 --> 35:14.080
the most pathogenic virus of the last 100 years has she been talking to Charles Rixie

35:14.640 --> 35:23.840
holy cow what was that the most pathogenic virus in the last 100 years wow what a way to open this

35:23.840 --> 35:31.920
interview holy ships were I mean they're very rare in nature but they were central to the

35:31.920 --> 35:38.160
esoteric research interests of the top coronavirus virologists in the world Ralph Barrick and the

35:38.160 --> 35:45.360
top coronavirus collectors in the world Peter Dasek and you know the who wants yeah they were

35:45.440 --> 35:57.120
coronavirus collectors coronavirus collectors were caught red-handed what is she talking about

35:57.120 --> 36:04.400
to the virology we also found that while these scientists told the US government that they were

36:04.400 --> 36:11.440
going to be doing this high-risk virology at UNC under relatively strict biosafety protocol they

36:11.440 --> 36:16.560
were actually going to secretly be outsourcing much of this research to the Wuhan Institute of

36:16.560 --> 36:23.520
Virology under an inadequate biosafety level essentially in order to save on costs and to be able to do

36:23.520 --> 36:30.640
the work more quickly so you know obviously that is very concerning yeah yeah I would say so let's

36:30.640 --> 36:36.560
let's talk about the the Alex Washburn at all pre-print that kind of led that led to this reporting

36:36.640 --> 36:42.640
that you did and so we can go back to Bob Gary to who's a to Lane University virologist who

36:43.360 --> 36:49.920
people might recall was involved in this that first kind of famous in now infamous conference

36:49.920 --> 36:55.920
call with Anthony Fauci February second or fourth or whatever between the first and the fourth where

36:55.920 --> 37:01.440
the virologists all at the beginning are leaning towards a lab leak and by the end of it are

37:02.400 --> 37:07.920
pronouncing and organizing public statements and articles saying that there couldn't have been a

37:07.920 --> 37:14.960
lab leak and everybody is crazy who thinks it is so Bob Gary at the time observed the makeup

37:14.960 --> 37:24.320
of COVID-19 and identified some unusual features of it which takes us to the Washburn paper so

37:24.320 --> 37:30.320
what would Bob Gary find and how important was that to your reporting? Sure so I'll start out with

37:30.320 --> 37:35.760
what is I think indisputable at this point from our reporting and then I'll get into the more

37:35.760 --> 37:40.400
controversial indisputable here we go the stuff that's indisputable is that the

37:41.360 --> 37:45.840
scientists working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology were interested in making engineered

37:45.840 --> 37:51.520
viruses in the lab and testing whether they could infect human receptors and their so-called gold

37:51.520 --> 37:58.320
standard would be to identify viruses that could cause disease they were also knowledgeable about

37:58.880 --> 38:05.200
two things that could essentially supercharge a coronavirus into that gold standard of something

38:05.200 --> 38:12.560
that could cause disease in human, humanized mice and those two features were a fear and cleavage

38:12.560 --> 38:19.600
site at the S1S2 junction of the spike protein and a receptor binding domain that was very good at

38:20.240 --> 38:27.520
latching on to a receptor called ACE2 and when SARS-CoV-2 first came out those

38:27.520 --> 38:33.440
virologists who initially said privately oh no this looks engineered and then came out with a

38:33.440 --> 38:38.000
paper that said if you think that this is engineered here no one of the things that I find very

38:38.000 --> 38:43.440
frustrating here and I'm gonna I'm gonna do this on I don't think this is um

38:46.400 --> 38:52.640
probably didn't turn that on yet um one of the things I find frustrating here is this discussion

38:52.720 --> 39:00.800
about what Wuhan engineers wanted what Wuhan um what Wuhan virologists wanted she says that

39:00.800 --> 39:06.960
they wanted to test engineered viruses now all that means is that they were making everybody

39:06.960 --> 39:13.840
else was making anyone that works on RNA viruses has to make clones and they were doing it other

39:13.840 --> 39:20.320
people did it all IR RNA virologists are eventually making clones so they were making clones of the

39:20.320 --> 39:24.240
viruses that they were finding in the wild when they could find them that doesn't make them

39:24.240 --> 39:28.560
necessarily any spookier than any of the other virologists that are doing this kind of stuff

39:29.280 --> 39:34.400
they're making clones Ralph Barrick works on clones maybe he doesn't find them maybe he just

39:34.400 --> 39:40.560
imagines them maybe computer generates them whatever the she's these people were making clones and

39:40.560 --> 39:47.120
then they were using humanized mice is like oh it's always the same humanized mice are not that big

39:47.120 --> 39:54.720
a deal they are a cheap way of making a mouse model of disease that is more likely to show

39:54.720 --> 40:03.600
disease and so part of the mouse model trick is again making this this sort of simplification

40:03.600 --> 40:09.440
of a disease model that can get you grants over and over and and create this illusion and this

40:09.440 --> 40:17.040
is the big deal create the illusion of pandemic potential so if we think then about what she lists

40:17.040 --> 40:23.520
she lists the fear and cleavage site and she lists ace to affinity the ace to affinity argument

40:23.520 --> 40:29.520
is so frustrating to me because it is so disingenuous for all of these people who are not virologists

40:29.520 --> 40:36.000
and in fact kevin mccernan also makes this argument in his uh sub-stack comments where he calls my

40:36.000 --> 40:43.680
ideas chemtrail retarded he says that the ace to affinity was was enhanced in order to increase

40:43.760 --> 40:50.480
its infectivity or its transmissibility or whatever and it's so weird because before the pandemic

40:50.480 --> 40:57.680
there is no discussion about a how shall i say it there's no discussion about some kind of gradient

40:57.680 --> 41:03.040
that has an exponentially increasing affinity which can result in an exponentially increasing

41:03.040 --> 41:11.360
infectivity transmissibility or virulence it's either it works on the receptor or it doesn't work on

41:11.360 --> 41:19.760
the receptor virologists before the pandemic are absolutely positively not concerned at all

41:20.960 --> 41:27.520
about the relative affinity and they're not concerned about the fact that well the affinity

41:27.520 --> 41:33.520
could increase and then that will make the virus more dangerous it's a yes or no question either

41:33.520 --> 41:40.320
it neutralizes or it doesn't either it it it it is culturable and it's passagable or it's not

41:42.080 --> 41:50.880
and so i find it in retrospect extremely dubious looking back on how we were so encouraged to discuss

41:51.440 --> 41:57.920
the affinity of the ace to receptor or the affinity for the ace to receptor and we were

41:58.000 --> 42:04.240
supposed to compare it across like well we compared all these different ace to receptors and this one

42:04.240 --> 42:13.840
is like so perfect for human no one ever discussed this possibility before the pandemic people talked

42:13.840 --> 42:24.480
about it changing from able to infect one animal to able to infect another but the idea that there

42:24.560 --> 42:30.480
was this okay now it can infect ace to and then now it's got more affinity and it's even more

42:30.480 --> 42:36.640
dangerous and now it's got more affinity and it's even more dangerous this concept doesn't exist

42:36.640 --> 42:44.080
before 2020 and she's not a virologist so for some reason or another she's she's regurgitating

42:44.080 --> 42:50.080
this idea even though it has no basis in biology and interestingly enough at the same time a little

42:50.160 --> 42:57.200
bit farther behind the scenes in the dissident world there are four bloggers for substackers

42:57.200 --> 43:04.400
excuse me who are all talking about it the idea that we need to make diffuse real again

43:06.640 --> 43:13.760
and one of them even mentioned ace to affinity as a way of increasing infectivity it's so

43:14.400 --> 43:19.760
so strange it's so strange

43:22.320 --> 43:26.720
crazy they were privately very concerned about these two features if you're in an image site at the

43:26.720 --> 43:34.080
s1s2 and the fact that it was sort of immediately very good at infecting human cells and so

43:34.880 --> 43:41.360
the documents that we obtained show they lay out their plan to create a model where they could

43:41.360 --> 43:46.400
create engineered viruses with these features that we later see in SARS-CoV-2 but that are

43:46.400 --> 43:51.840
exceedingly rare in nature so that that all is indisputable at this point I think there have

43:51.840 --> 43:59.280
been people you know people like Robert Gary who have really nitpicked and said well it's not a

43:59.280 --> 44:05.440
fear and cleavage site at the s1s2 it's a fear and cleavage site at the s1 or s2 but

44:06.080 --> 44:09.680
you know the new documents we obtained make it very explicit that they were interested in

44:09.680 --> 44:15.120
precise so one of the things she just said there were these were features that are exceedingly

44:15.120 --> 44:21.760
rare in nature so before the pandemic we didn't have millions of coronavirus sequences

44:22.720 --> 44:28.240
it was very hard to get a full sequence and in fact one of the methodological

44:31.360 --> 44:37.360
advances that that that Ralph Barrett brought to the field was putting together a minimum

44:37.360 --> 44:44.320
coronavirus genome that could be used as a basis for substitution from and if you found a

44:45.120 --> 44:51.680
n protein and an s protein in a in a sample you could create a whole functional coronavirus from

44:51.680 --> 44:56.400
those two proteins by just substituting the other 24 that are required for assembly

44:57.040 --> 45:04.560
and and virulence or assembly and infectivity replication competence could be engineered in

45:04.640 --> 45:12.880
other words so so exceedingly rare features this doesn't really you know it doesn't really make

45:12.880 --> 45:17.920
sense because we don't have we don't have some kind of you know weather balloons all over the world

45:17.920 --> 45:23.040
that are constantly reporting viral sequences to us all the time and they really would like you to

45:23.040 --> 45:26.960
believe that that's the case that they just have all these sequences and they're always there all

45:26.960 --> 45:32.080
the time and I think that's part of Kevin McCurnan schtick as well he wants you to believe that

45:32.160 --> 45:37.760
you know it's like the Hollywood movies and and uh you know they have they can sample a million

45:37.760 --> 45:44.240
viruses from the subway every hour or something I mean it's it's all this this this implic this

45:45.120 --> 45:52.400
they imply such a degree of fidelity of understanding that they don't have and they've clearly they've

45:52.400 --> 45:57.440
clearly convinced her that they have this fidelity of understanding these guys are clearly not

45:57.440 --> 46:02.720
sophisticated enough to to understand that they don't have this fidelity of understanding

46:02.720 --> 46:07.520
and more importantly they aren't they don't have the background I mean that guy just needs a job

46:07.520 --> 46:14.320
it looks like to me. Lee viruses like SARS-CoV-2 the Alex Washburn paper that you mentioned around

46:14.320 --> 46:18.640
restriction sites I think that's a little bit more controversial and requires a little bit more

46:18.640 --> 46:25.280
scientific inquiry but what they found in 2022 is that a pattern of restriction sites and restriction

46:25.360 --> 46:31.360
sites are essentially little bits of code that occur in the genome that can be used in the lab to

46:32.560 --> 46:37.840
engineer new viruses but they also can occur naturally but what they found they did a

46:39.280 --> 46:45.360
statistics around how likely is it that we would see this precise pattern and they found it to be

46:45.360 --> 46:52.400
very unlikely and so the new documents that we have so you can see right she's just barely able to

46:52.400 --> 46:58.160
process how this works and because she's just barely able to process it and because

46:58.800 --> 47:06.480
she's been made to feel like she's responsible for putting the pieces together she's convinced

47:06.480 --> 47:12.160
herself that again a function virus did circulate the globe for the last four years that they did

47:12.160 --> 47:18.480
cover it up and that did she did figure it out and that the only logical conclusion to come to

47:18.480 --> 47:24.560
is that we hit we did make it we were intending to make it they they made it and then this happened

47:25.600 --> 47:32.080
and she's very convinced she's barely she can barely feel the jungle gym in the dark but she

47:32.080 --> 47:37.360
knows where all the hand holds are and she can move from one end of the room to the other in the dark

47:37.360 --> 47:45.360
on the jungle gym because she has figured it all out but she's under the impression that there is

47:45.360 --> 47:51.360
a never-ending abyss underneath her when in reality it's a padded floor that's about six

47:51.360 --> 47:58.960
inches from her feet and so as she struggles over that jungle gym in the dark to get from one side

47:58.960 --> 48:05.360
of the room to the other to demonstrate that she understands it she thinks that she's really just

48:05.360 --> 48:12.640
you know wow this is an amazing feat you understand something that is so high level and if you make

48:12.640 --> 48:17.760
just one mistake you're going to fall and it's just going to be a plummet to humiliation

48:19.040 --> 48:23.760
and so she is so carefully trying to explain this right now making sure that she doesn't make any

48:23.760 --> 48:28.400
mistakes I don't want to overextend but oh my gosh the things we know for certain are that they

48:28.400 --> 48:33.840
wanted to engineer viruses that could cause disease the thing we know for sure is that they were

48:33.840 --> 48:39.920
going to use humanized mice to evaluate whether they could cause disease which she thinks means

48:39.920 --> 48:46.160
all kinds of terrible things but it doesn't it means that they're going to use clones

48:46.960 --> 48:53.360
in mice that express human receptors probably not in a naturally equivalent way to the way that

48:53.360 --> 48:59.760
mice would use these receptors of their own and therefore whatever disease model they've created

48:59.760 --> 49:05.360
with those mice is wholly inappropriate to understand what goes on with any of these kinds of things

49:05.440 --> 49:14.880
in humans if they are not even real and so they've worked on fear and cleavage and ace to affinity

49:14.880 --> 49:22.400
in order to create a gain of function virus and they added these exceedingly rare features

49:23.280 --> 49:30.000
using endonuclease restriction restriction endonucleases and one or two in particular because

49:30.000 --> 49:36.160
they're very special she didn't explain that very well but the gist of it is is that some

49:36.160 --> 49:43.840
endonucleases cut at very specific places with very specific ends because the ends are where the

49:43.840 --> 49:56.400
cut site occurs and then other enzymes cut at a certain cut site but then away from the recognition

49:56.560 --> 50:02.080
site and so if I was to explain that to you as best I can in a cartoon

50:03.920 --> 50:11.040
um what I would do is something like this um you have two strands of DNA here

50:12.640 --> 50:20.160
and you will have a sequence of some sort like this yes and so an endonuclease could cut

50:20.880 --> 50:23.760
an end which looked which cut here

50:28.240 --> 50:33.920
like that so then this was where the the recognition sequence was and then this is the cut that it

50:33.920 --> 50:40.640
makes and so if it makes this cut like this then you're left with sticky ends that look like this

50:40.640 --> 50:46.400
and more importantly there are sticky ends that have certain bases here because the certain bases

50:46.400 --> 50:53.680
are here so if the recognition site was a c g t for example i'm just making this up

50:54.400 --> 51:02.880
then where it cuts is a c g t and so that leaves it like an a here right and it will leave like a

51:03.600 --> 51:08.960
c g t here and then it will leave whatever is over here and whatever is over here so this cut space

51:09.520 --> 51:16.160
that's for this enzyme is the recognition site is the cut and so unless you want to put this

51:16.160 --> 51:22.800
exact sequence and cut this exact sequence into your DNA this one's kind of specific i mean you

51:22.800 --> 51:28.320
can use them and there are lots of enzymes that cut this way but they're they're more specific

51:28.320 --> 51:34.480
scissors that cut a specific shape as a result of the fact that the recognition site is also the

51:34.480 --> 51:40.160
cut site now what berry has specialized in and what i've figured out over the last few days of

51:40.160 --> 51:46.000
trying to you know get my get my britches underneath me here with regard to arguing about this stuff

51:46.000 --> 51:51.920
and knowing what i'm talking about i got to turn the page here it's just off is that there are some

51:51.920 --> 52:00.240
enzymes that will that will will recognize a sequence here but then they'll actually cut here

52:00.800 --> 52:08.080
whoops i just bumped the camera and so if they cut here what that means is is that you can

52:08.080 --> 52:18.880
engineer the cut recognition site next to the site that you want to protect you see and so now

52:20.000 --> 52:26.480
that using enzymes that cut like this where the sticky ends that are produced are variable

52:26.480 --> 52:33.280
because the recognition site is not where it cuts and so if this is a sentence like you know

52:34.480 --> 52:43.200
if this is the the sentence that says a quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and it

52:43.200 --> 52:52.320
recognizes a quick brown fox but cuts at the lazy dog then you can make another sentence where

52:52.400 --> 53:01.680
it says a quick brown fox um a to a rare steak and so now you've got a cut here that's at a

53:01.680 --> 53:10.640
rare steak instead because it started with um the the the quick brought the quick fox or whatever

53:10.640 --> 53:15.680
i can i'm sorry i'm confusing myself now trying to use a sentence off the top of my head so you

53:15.680 --> 53:21.600
have two kinds of have endonuclease you have an endonuclease that cuts at the recognition site and

53:21.600 --> 53:29.280
therefore the the sticky ends are very specific and they're not variable but barrack discovered

53:29.280 --> 53:36.960
a way excuse me uh that was the um pennsylvania department of health phone number don't think i

53:36.960 --> 53:43.760
splash something interesting there um barrack discovered a way of using endonuclease sites whose

53:43.760 --> 53:50.160
recognition site is separate from the cut site which means that allows you to you make more flexible

53:50.160 --> 53:57.440
ends and more importantly you can make more specific ends those ends here that are specific

53:57.440 --> 54:04.720
for each cut because again you're just and you're going to engineer this cut site into the places

54:04.720 --> 54:09.680
where you want to cut to happen but the where the cut happens is unique because it comes after

54:09.680 --> 54:17.040
the recognition site what that means is is that if you wanted to ligate five pieces of DNA together

54:17.120 --> 54:26.400
then all you have to do is put this this flexible recognition site right here and each one of these

54:26.400 --> 54:33.360
pieces will cut a unique end that will always stick together in only this way because this end

54:33.360 --> 54:38.400
will only fit with this end because the word that comes after the cut site here is going to be

54:38.400 --> 54:44.800
different than here and if you were using a specific enzyme like this one then the cut site would be

54:44.880 --> 54:51.920
the same the cut site would be the same at every one of these junctions and then the the whole genome

54:51.920 --> 54:58.400
wouldn't assemble correctly but if you use one of these endonuclease is that the recognition site

54:58.400 --> 55:02.720
is separate from the cut site then the ends are flexible and the ends are specific and so then

55:02.720 --> 55:10.400
you can ligate all with one enzyme and so that was what was really neat about what she is found

55:10.480 --> 55:16.320
or what they found with their supposedly with their scooby-doo with their scooby-doo

55:17.120 --> 55:25.520
foyas is that they got more information which seemed to indicate that not only did this did this

55:28.560 --> 55:36.480
what did I have did I have this up not only did this this paper found regularly spaced

55:37.120 --> 55:43.840
right regularly spaced regularly spaced endonuclease sites but also regularly spaced endonuclease

55:43.840 --> 55:50.480
sites that were of this nonspecific um recognition site separate from the cut site type enzyme

55:51.120 --> 55:57.040
really how barrack set this stuff up and so it seems very logical that this must be evidence of

55:57.040 --> 56:03.360
it being a cloned virus and I'm not arguing with that at all what I'm arguing with is that if this

56:03.440 --> 56:08.240
is a cloned virus does that mean that this RNA can spread around the world at high fidelity and

56:08.240 --> 56:15.520
high speed has the most pathogenic virus in a hundred years no I do not I think the whole concept

56:15.520 --> 56:21.760
of the most pathogenic RNA in a hundred years is absurd and they've got her believing it and

56:21.760 --> 56:27.040
they've got her explaining it to them and they've got her explaining it to thousands and thousands

56:27.040 --> 56:33.360
maybe millions of viewers that's the problem oops that was not the right one this is the right

56:33.360 --> 56:42.080
one no that's not the right one come on Jay learn your setup wait it should be this one yeah okay

56:42.080 --> 56:48.480
sorry then I had to get out of this there we go I maybe I'm taking too long but I want you to

56:48.480 --> 56:54.080
understand what they're doing with this synthetic viruses with these restriction enzymes in six

56:54.080 --> 57:00.800
pieces which is what the washburn paper found and they also include a budget line for one of these

57:00.800 --> 57:05.600
specific restrictions right let's talk stop there talk sorry about that so the paper says okay

57:05.600 --> 57:11.920
there's these six different you know whatever they are and they basically predicted okay if you

57:11.920 --> 57:17.760
were going six different one you would need would be this one particular this is one got five but

57:17.760 --> 57:22.480
there would be six thousands of enzymes commercially that are available to do this research and what

57:22.480 --> 57:30.000
you found is that they in fact did purchase that enzyme and did use this you know for which see so

57:30.000 --> 57:36.080
now he's saying that of the thousands of ends is probably hundreds of the hundreds of of restriction

57:36.080 --> 57:43.680
and the nucleus is available they identified one and this one is also one that they ordered now

57:43.680 --> 57:48.720
what I need you to understand is that they there are about six or eight of these enzymes that would

57:48.800 --> 57:54.160
qualify very well for this no-seum technique and if you go back into barracks of literature

57:54.160 --> 57:59.920
you'll find that previous papers used different enzymes for doing for accomplishing the same thing

58:00.960 --> 58:05.600
and so I don't think the enzyme is that important I don't think that it matters I just

58:07.280 --> 58:12.640
what I think and I need to be very clear about it is is that this was the plan all along

58:13.600 --> 58:19.520
the plan all along was to fool us into thinking that we had solved this mystery by getting the

58:19.520 --> 58:24.640
diffuse proposal and understanding that the diffuse proposal represented pandemic potential

58:24.640 --> 58:30.560
it represented a guy like like like Peter Dasek getting so cocky as to think that he could spray

58:31.120 --> 58:39.920
viruses into bad caves with fear and cleavage sites in them and she's believing it I was

58:39.920 --> 58:45.760
believing it four years ago I'm not believing it now I'm trying to break this mythology

58:47.280 --> 58:54.640
these guys are trying to to expound on it this is the spellcasting in real time right now this

58:54.640 --> 59:00.240
is how they did it this is how they're doing it suggests that they're doing the exact thing that

59:00.240 --> 59:05.520
was predicted so not only do you have a regression analysis that shows the chance of this being

59:05.520 --> 59:11.760
formed naturally is you know infinitesimally small but then they then they add a prediction

59:11.760 --> 59:18.240
on top of it that you would need this particular enzyme and the chance that they actually then

59:18.240 --> 59:25.200
purchased that and it all being a coincidence takes it from infinitesimally small to me to

59:26.080 --> 59:31.680
impossible to be anything other than a smoking gun so why is it still considered somewhat

59:31.680 --> 59:37.440
controversial even among you know some people who have always who have recently been saying yeah

59:37.440 --> 59:42.720
I I believe I lean toward a lab leak but I want to see more scientific inquiry on this

59:43.360 --> 59:49.360
yeah it's sort of hard for us laypeople to evaluate because it does require knowledge of

59:50.080 --> 59:55.600
statistics and of bioengineering so the number of people who can really evaluate these claims I

59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.640
think is pretty small but some scientists who are that's what they want you to believe they

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:06.400
want you to believe that it's so stupid complicated that you might as well just leave it to the experts

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.320
and we are never doing that again please understand that at giga ohm biological we are never doing

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.680
that again there is nothing that's too complicated nothing is too difficult to be explained to us

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.880
if it's that complicated then you better be able to explain that or you don't understand it and

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.680
that's one of the ways that you can really see that some of these people are burning themselves

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.880
because they come out and they throw stupid complicated for an hour and after an hour you

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:41.120
don't know any more than you did before the hour started and I don't think that happens very often

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.800
here now correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that happens very often here more skeptical

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.960
like Alina Chan they basically point oh my gosh who is who are who can really evaluate these claims

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.080
I think is pretty small but some scientists who are a bit more skeptical like Alina Chan they

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:05.680
basically point to other viruses in nature that Alina Chan is a person without a CV

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.560
who had no reason to be talking about sequences in May of 2020

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:21.520
and yet had a preprint that showed that the that the virus was not changing at all and I think

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.680
it's kind of a mistake because it hasn't actually been ever formally published just like the end

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.640
of the nucleus paper hasn't been formally peer reviewed published yet so it's a little strange

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:41.200
where we are right now it's it's a little strange where we are but Alina Chan sold a book is selling

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:50.080
a book um and Alina Chan do I have that book I don't think I have that book Eddie I don't

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:56.000
Eddie I don't think you sent me Alina Chan's book yeah did you did I get that book already

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.200
I don't think I did um

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.120
I thought I had it but maybe I don't anyway the point is she's selling a book and it's a book about

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:13.120
a lab leak it's probably terrible compared to Bobby's book um but it is a book that she was written

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.920
right and written and sold very early on and then she got a permanent appointment at the broad

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.760
Institute or the Broad Institute um and I believe uh Eric Lander is the head of that

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.840
Institute and I think Eric Lander also worked in the White House um at the start of the Biden

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:39.360
administration um and charge a science or something like that and um I think Eric Lander was also

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.840
Kevin McCurnan's first uh you know like he was kind of Kevin was kind of his protege it's it's

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:53.360
interesting small little circle of people trying to protect the idea that coronaviruses are very

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.000
high fidelity circulating pathogens in the background all the time but not really just now

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.640
very similar to SARS-CoV-2 having similar restriction sites then you get kind of another layer of

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.000
complexity which is that there is a debate about how many silent mutations you would see around

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.880
these sites in nature versus in the lab um and so I think that's something that scientists need to

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:25.520
duke out I think another um I guess just a cautionary word I've heard is that Ralph Barrick this

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.480
coronavar virologist who was working very closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology he was known

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:37.360
for doing this sort of work without any of these sort of markings without leaving the restriction

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:45.040
sites in um he patented no-seum technology no-seum being the name of a insect. I'm not sure that

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.280
it's patented um I hate it when people say that and they don't know and I don't think it's patented

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:59.760
um he nicknamed his invention no-seum you see that there that's what I wrote in my article he

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.880
nicknamed his invention no-seum I don't think it's patented and these are the kinds of things that

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:17.600
really that implies a lot and what it implies which is really annoying is that no other

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.080
molecular biologist could have come up with this idea that no other molecular biologist

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:29.520
understood that using these kinds of of enzymes could hide your your linkage sites that's just

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.280
that's just ridiculous and that's why I didn't like writing this article and trying to blame it on

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:46.720
on Ralph Barrick because using restriction endonucleases to assemble a coronavirus genome

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.280
should be considered like baking a cake once you show everybody how to make angel food cake and

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.600
you give the recipe to everyone if an angel food cake shows up in China it doesn't mean that that

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:08.400
baker was there and this is not a very complicated kind of recipe for a molecular biology lab to

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.440
link different DNA molecules together by unique sticky ends that's what they do

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:23.600
so this doesn't implicate him any more than a cake implicates a particular baker in Pittsburgh

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.040
now you might be able to trace it to somebody if they have a particular recipe yada yada yada

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:42.240
that's fine I get it but the technique and what's written in the diffuse proposal inserting fear

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.160
and cleavage sites and this kind of thing where's the technique there what why I don't get it

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.920
so the technique is in the viral sequence that was reported to us from China

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.160
but in the diffuse proposal they use the technique or they don't they were gonna make clones or they

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:06.400
weren't because that's where this starts to get really hairy because they they want you to pay

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.160
attention to the diffuse proposal but they don't really want you to pay attention to it

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.640
because if you really pay attention to it then you see that RNA virology is done using infectious

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:28.400
clones synthetic RNA virology is RNA virology there is no other you don't go out in the wild

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.600
and get viruses and then keep them growing in your lab and have all different stocks in little bottles

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.040
and and and keep the lights on keep feeding them that's not how this works

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:47.920
these are molecular constructs that can be passaged for a time if they start out pure

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:57.200
because that's the trick that nobody wants you to know that's the trick that even the no virus

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:02.640
people don't want to accept as possible that if you made self-replicating RNA that some cells

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.000
might package it up if you gave them the right sub-genomic RNA in the right in the right uh

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.240
proportions and that's what i'm figuring out over these last few days they already know these

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:23.120
proportions they already know how it works and when they can't get a viral construct to form

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:32.000
they just add a few things and then it works just fine we are going to win this argument there is

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.720
no doubt in my mind we are going to win this argument and maybe we are going to be the ones

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:44.560
that carry this football over the over the goal line where a pandemic isn't possible

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.640
and where the only way this molecular signal could be real is if they used clones to do it but

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.480
it didn't mean that they did i don't need to argue that they did but if people like kevin

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.760
mccernan want to say that these signals are real that these pcr tests find something that

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:09.360
these sequences are almost all real things the only way that's possible is with clones

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.280
and not every one of them is clones of course they're not clones of course

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.840
not every one of them is clones but this started with clones it started with

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:27.440
seeding a perfect viral sample in a few places with perfect fidelity with those other viral samples

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.600
if it's spread a little ways all the better

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.520
this insistence that this is a real thing this insistence that this is a real thing

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:49.280
over and over again no one no one seems clever enough to consider the possibility that maybe they

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:57.840
would lie with a document that that would only take one or two people not pulling in the tug of

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:06.720
war for all these people to be fooled one or two people not pulling in the tug of war results in

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:15.840
all of these people being fooled in fact it's as simple as the guy leaking the document being

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:22.080
fooled by the it person who put it there it's that simple

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.160
but i don't think it's that simple because some of these people have to be clever enough to know

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.320
because i've told them already i've talked to jessica about this not being real

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.560
i've talked to them about the circumstances in which it was released i talked to them about the

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:48.000
why is it that the major murphy who released this to veritas also released it to charles rixie but

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:57.040
veritas didn't know that rixie had it and that it is in in all of his patriotic boots charles rixie

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.240
decided that what he would do with this newly leaked document is give it to a bunch of foreigners

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.440
that he doesn't even know their names on the internet on twitter

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:17.280
on a social media platform not on proton mail or on signal or some other form of of highly

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:28.480
secured communication on twitter and that's supposed to be a patriot somebody who's trying to save

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.680
our grandchildren took the diffuse proposal from the leaker at the at the pentagon and handed it

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:41.040
over to a bunch of anonymous people on twitter so that they could write a report

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.360
in a pdf form without metadata oh that's great

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.960
and now we're supposed to believe from all these people that the diffuse proposal is real because

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:04.720
now we see that they used enzymes they ordered enzymes but not one of these master biologists

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.120
is going to explain to you what's so special about those enzymes how many of those enzymes are

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:15.600
there is it really that hard to do or is it something that any molecular biologist could do

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:22.960
every one of these people knows anybody could do it every one of these people knows it's just

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:29.200
baking cakes they can read the same 1994 reviews that you and i can

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:37.840
they can read all the methodology papers as they start to find better enzymes enzymes that are

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.320
more convenient enzymes that have a cut site that's farther away from their recognition sites so they

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:50.960
get even better sticky ends so what it's all the same principle and it's not even as complicated as a

01:11:50.960 --> 01:12:01.120
cake and it's so frustrating that these people they must know they they can't possibly not know

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:12.160
that these are not you know this is not JS Bach of coronavirus biology he's not JS Bach of molecular

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:20.240
biology molecular biology has been linking DNA and making unique DNA sequences for 30 years

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.360
it's only gotten cheaper and easier that's it about that kevin mccernan is right

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:33.600
but RNA clones are how they do all this RNA clones is how it's always been done RNA clones

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.560
allows you to have infectious material where there is none RNA clones allow you to produce

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.240
infectious stocks that are near homogenous and you can't do that in any other way what i want

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.120
is high morbidity and infectious clones would allow you to set up this perfect scenario

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.720
and hide it behind a novel virus

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.960
would hide it behind the scooby-doo

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.360
listen to the scooby-doo go

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.920
um so it's almost unusual to find a pattern like this if we expect it to be

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.360
barracks idea that the Wuhan lab was working with

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.800
yeah i mean what's really concerns me and Lee is like i've never believed obviously a natural

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.800
origin but let me ask you then this chrysal often does this how would you steal man you know you

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:31.600
are reporting what what natural origin hypothesis at this point even bears scrutiny for a seasoned

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.640
health care reporter like yourself what would the you know the the critics critics say in response

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:44.560
to this um i know i i feel statewide that's why i'm asking you yeah well i think the

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:50.960
possible coincidence of the pandemic first being detected at the wet market

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.920
that i think that story still hasn't been told how is it that that was the first place

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:06.320
where we started detecting cases um wow so holy cow i mean you see it right

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.520
this is how deep in the scooby-doo she is this is daphne

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:21.600
this is velma she is barely clinging to the back of a moving truck in the middle of the night

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.040
and she's climbing in and she just can't believe she barely escaped with her life

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:38.240
but she figured it out the enzymes are the same enzymes that these guys found in the paper

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.120
and in the paper those enzyme sites were spaced evenly to create six pieces

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.000
and it's the same way that Ralph Barrick used to build his coronaviruses

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.200
and then we found this diffuse proposal where they proposed to put some of these very same

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.320
extreme exceedingly rare in nature aspects into the viruses

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.640
and these are things that are indisputable now after all of my research

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.000
and now she can't fake one of the things that still makes her scratch her head is how is it that

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.600
we found cases around that market that's weird so maybe the the lab leak person went to the market

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.360
we still got to solve that mystery that's still that's still one mask we haven't pulled off yet

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.240
i think the idea that early cases clustered around the wet market is based on um a really

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:41.200
bad analysis i think the idea that uh spillover occurred at that market um is based on an analysis

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:48.160
that was recently uh recently suffered a major correction exactly yeah right so so it's hard

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:55.440
but i i do you know i'll give it to my opponents i guess um and say that i think it is hard to

01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:00.240
explain um just given the information that we have the limited information right why it was

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.880
the wet market that you know where we first but can't can't we just say that well yeah that's

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.240
where the chinese first report of the cases i mean they're the ones who are responsible for

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.200
you know they we control the information that we get not like not vice versa it's not necessarily

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:19.200
organic yeah continuing to like occupy the mind space of a virologist who are a natural origin i

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.720
would say um some of the first people who detected the pandemic were doctors in wuhan right um

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.640
you know i would also say i've done a reporting showing that the doctors in wuhan were censored

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.520
very heavily and face a lot of retaliation for early reporting so whether that early reporting

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.320
is actually reflective of the earliest cases um i'm not confident in that yeah good great point

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.720
and get so i mean given the documents you've obtained in the work that you've done uh

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.400
right now uh news outlets are busy submitting their their different articles for for pollencers

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.360
you know i think uh i don't even know if us rights know is eligible uh for a Pulitzer i think you

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.240
deserve one for the work that's been doing on this yes thank you but i'm i'm curious what it's been

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:06.480
like to see so little mainstream media uh follow up on on this reporting because we're talking about

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:14.720
a pandemic that killed at least 25 million people holy crap what pandemic that

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:21.600
on this reporting because we're talking about a pandemic that killed at least 25 million people

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:31.120
correct oh holy shit upended uh our geopolitics upended 25 million people i heard seven million

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:44.080
once 25 million people wow wow that is impressive wow our politics our economy uh the number of

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:52.080
people who are suffering uh from you know having lived through covid have you know and on and on

01:17:52.080 --> 01:18:00.080
is just the damage is incalculable and the evidence points to a small group of people breaking rules

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.800
because you know the obama administration had put in place restrictions around this type of

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:10.000
research that they you know went around in order uh in order to do this small group of people

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.440
we're talking fewer than a dozen perhaps um doing something not on purpose you know but recklessly

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:23.600
knowing that it was a possibility uh Anthony Fauci in 2014 said that you know the potential

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.400
risks outweigh the benefits of this type of research i think that's absurd given uh the

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:36.800
costs that we've endured so what's been like uh from your perspective to see so little uh follow

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.360
up at this point the new york times if you only read the new york times you believe that it's

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.600
open and shut case and it came out of natural order came out of that in your racist it wasn't bad

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.040
and then it was a raccoon dog and i just must even know yeah so what what's been like uh to to know

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:59.520
the opposite and to watch this unfold i mean it's maddening it makes me feel like i'm losing it

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:07.360
a little bit but i mean i think some of the things that are at play are the same things that are

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:16.080
making this show so popular i think the mainstream media is becoming culturally irrelevant um and

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.600
to me she is really not good on camera why is she staring at the freaking table all the time

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.360
with her swollen fingers i think my theory just kind of coming out of the health reporting space

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.760
and knowing kind of the culture and some of the editors who are running the health and science

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:40.000
desks at um these major outlets i think they're friends oh i didn't know that about right as well

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.200
it's just personal relationships um and they really admire him and i think they have a hard time

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.840
grasping the idea that someone who had good intentions um and who might not be a bad person might have

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:58.880
made a catastrophic error in judgment yeah i mean to me the smoke if you'll remember dal McNeil who

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.400
worked for the times he got fired it was a bunch of controversy and he came out later and he's like

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.600
look i didn't believe it because i was friends with these guys he literally said that and they

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.680
wanted him yeah we have yeah yeah yeah good those really be little screens though i never thought

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:17.040
about that you could have a little screen there with words on it why not i mean how many it could

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.880
be like this wide it could have like four i think those are screens right there i didn't even think

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:33.040
about it wow that's scary oh no way that's scary if she's looking at that oh my gosh of them lot like

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.120
yeah he came out and is like i've known Anthony Fauci and Peter Dazak for 30 years i believed

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.280
them and he's like and i've they misled me and i he's open about it but he can only be open about

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.280
it because he hears yes of them like like to friends with these guys he finds you got fired

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.400
it was a bunch of controversy and he came out later and he's like look i didn't believe it because

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.920
i was friends with these guys he literally said that and they lied to him we have we have the

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.920
emails of them like like directly lying yeah he came out and is like i've known Anthony Fauci

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.480
and Peter Dazak for 30 years i believed them and he's like and i've they misled me and i he's

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:04.160
open about it but he can only be open about it because he's no longer within the system so i

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:10.080
guess finally you know we can bring this you've effectively solved the case for us but what else

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:16.480
is there like your solve the case what the case is solved the masks have been removed other things

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.960
are you going to potentially inquire in can our audience help you what can people point you in

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:26.960
the right direction well your audience can definitely you know follow us obviously i think we're

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.720
punching above our weight but we're not in your time so um so that every little bit helps every

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:40.080
follower every subscriber to our newsletter um i think next steps this you know latest document

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:47.840
set i think lays out how SARS-CoV-2 probably got its unique features but we still don't have the

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:54.400
starting genomics sequence and even the guys you know the virologists who very strongly favor a

01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:00.080
natural origin have said a smoking gun would be identifying that virus in that lab in 2019 got it

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.520
so i think if we can confirm that they were doing this experimentation i mean this is just basic

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.480
virology she doesn't understand there's not going to be a virus in a lab unless it was created as a

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:18.000
clone otherwise it'll be a cluster of of of of non-infectious particles that are mixed with

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.760
infectious particles that they're passaging from cell to cell the only pure pure thing is the

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.640
is the infectious RNA so it's it's unfortunate you know maybe i should try to get her on the

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.480
on the show with other binding domains that strong or that binds strongly to um ace two with

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:43.840
something like SARS-CoV-2 that would be i mean game over like truly game over indisputably got it

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:49.680
so i think also one thing the audience could not do is jump in and be like i always knew this

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:56.000
from day one it's such a useless yeah point to make stop it because even if we definitely did

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.480
even if you do yeah it's just it's this miss of of all of the the great work that's right that so

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:06.720
many journalists have done to confirm your hunch that's right your hunch i'm sorry youtube audience

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.800
your hunch is not worth much that's right now he's right he's right and it's like this is why

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.560
we need you to do the work that you continue to do so uh people can follow you on twitter what's

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.400
the most helpful way people can help you um i think subscribing to our newsletter us right

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.720
to know okay all right well i'll link down that in the description everybody go also support

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.040
emily's work follow her on twitter etc and we will see you guys later hey guys if you like that

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.680
she says there's another one that we could watch but i'll watch it some other time

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:47.680
i've also got another video a couple other videos queued up i mean it's there's a lot of things to

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:54.320
watch and uh not enough time to watch that all and i'm spending a lot of my time during the day

01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:01.200
trying to put together this response to um the clone idea once and for all so that people actually

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.000
understand what the clones are about um the contention i'm trying to make and what i'm not

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.600
trying to make and so that people can't really pigeonhole us into one particular box like no

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.520
virus or something like that um ladies and gentlemen please stop all transfections and humans because

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:23.200
they are trying to eliminate the control group any means necessary this has been giggle and

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.680
biological or intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.000
augmenting the immune system is dumb transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent because

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.960
most of our our academic biologists and all of our doctors should have done known better and if

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.840
they didn't known better they should have read a little bit more before they recommended it viruses

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.040
aren't patterned integrity that's the way to start trying to understand they're not alive and so

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.200
there's certain things that you shouldn't use certain terms that you shouldn't apply to them

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.560
and we've been talking about them like they're just species and they're not um an RNA molecule

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:05.680
coated in a lipid lipoprotein code cannot do what they are attributing um this this one to

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:13.760
have done um so somewhere something is very fishy and they want us to um be like emily and think

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.280
that we should just accept our Pulitzer Prize for having solved the mystery of the Scooby-Doo virus

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.000
and we definitely are not going to accept that prize and we are not going to teach that to our

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.520
kids um thank you thank you thank you very much for joining me and thank you very much for sharing

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.920
my work i think i finally figured out how to get the video to show up immediately so as soon as

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.360
i sign off you should be able to watch the replay or check the beginning if you missed it um thank

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.560
you so much um please keep sharing my work please please please please that's the best way for me

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.480
to find more subscribers um is for you guys to keep sharing my work i really appreciate it very much

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.320
and i will be on again tomorrow because this is my job um i don't know i'm gonna try and do it

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.520
earlier actually um and then the night show would be like a bonus but right now um the days are still

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.640
i'm not trying to i really want to finish this thing about the clones i think it's really important

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.240
so that's what i'm going to be doing um it's giggleonbiological.com and the subscriptions are down below

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.720
thank you very much and i will see you again tomorrow
