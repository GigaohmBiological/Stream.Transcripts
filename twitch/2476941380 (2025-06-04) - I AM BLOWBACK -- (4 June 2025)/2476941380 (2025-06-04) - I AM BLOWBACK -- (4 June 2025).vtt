WEBVTT

00:19.778 --> 00:21.518
Hey, welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

00:21.538 --> 00:27.680
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

00:28.580 --> 00:38.203
I'd like to open the show today by making sure everybody understands that using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster.

00:39.123 --> 00:43.404
And I want to explain that in a little more detail just at the beginning.

00:43.424 --> 00:45.205
I'm not going to go really in-depth.

00:45.965 --> 00:56.210
But it has occurred to me that my graphic has not been sufficiently simplified in quite some time that a lot of people might not have any idea what this image behind me even represents.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.311
And the same goes with this one.

00:59.232 --> 01:08.957
I've been saying it's for all the marbles because this is for the grandchildren of Earth and trying to emphasize for you to think about it on longer time horizons, longer time scales.

01:09.877 --> 01:15.803
to really understand, try to understand why there would be a fake anti-vax movement in the first place.

01:16.444 --> 01:23.490
All these stories from these wacky people on the far right and the far left about all these conspiracy theories.

01:24.111 --> 01:31.438
Why would a military, industrial, multi-government operation need

01:32.598 --> 01:34.338
fake anti-vax movement.

01:34.418 --> 01:36.579
Why would one need to be tried out?

01:37.239 --> 01:44.781
Why would one need to be rehearsed on a smaller scale before being executed on a larger scale, on the real mark?

01:46.281 --> 01:56.063
And if the real mark was America and the rehearsal was in the UK, then are we being played by the UK?

01:56.143 --> 02:01.304
Are we being played by people loyal to the City of London, the Crown?

02:01.424 --> 02:01.824
I don't know.

02:02.895 --> 02:09.797
But I do know for sure that there is no good explanation for Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy.

02:10.658 --> 02:20.721
There's no good explanation for their almost catastrophic lack of progress in their messaging, a catastrophic

02:22.203 --> 02:28.990
lack of progress in their ability to change anything in society or to get any message out.

02:29.751 --> 02:43.105
The idea that after so many decades of fighting, so many billboards, they've come to rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

02:43.586 --> 02:44.427
It's remarkable.

02:45.663 --> 02:53.369
So I really also want you to understand a little bit more about why endemicity is such a magnificent myth.

02:54.150 --> 03:02.457
Why talking about endemicity as a process and also as an endpoint or a result is an enchantment.

03:03.017 --> 03:08.082
It's an acceptance of this phenomenon just based on the fact that we're telling you what it is.

03:09.428 --> 03:23.360
It's no different really than them telling you that there is an autism spectrum disorder and you need to do the requisite learning in order to understand what that is.

03:24.994 --> 03:36.082
And these are all myths that can really only be dispelled by students that have worked hard enough to be able to sit at the table with their teachers.

03:36.262 --> 03:40.545
And there are very few of those students anymore.

03:42.386 --> 03:52.073
There are very few students who have studied things with love and with passion and with genuine interest in knowing.

03:55.000 --> 04:09.666
The point is, is that you gotta be a student long enough to understand how, how persistence pays off in the end and how all the wasted hours and pain that you put in pays off in the end.

04:09.706 --> 04:17.489
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't know what that's like until long many, many, many, many, many failures.

04:18.269 --> 04:19.350
And in order to

04:21.405 --> 04:42.830
In order to achieve the kind of understanding of this myth that you need to achieve in order to escape, you have to necessarily pass through all of these stages of realization, because they're already there in the public consciousness, in the subconscious of every other person in the world.

04:43.715 --> 04:50.878
because they've been put there on purpose, because the uniform messaging on social media and on mainstream media.

04:51.858 --> 05:12.246
I always need to remind myself of how much of this, what we assume to be a consensus brought about by a bunch of thinking people is actually a consensus that can be and should be assumed to be possibly manufactured out of whole cloth with a combination of lies and messaging.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.067
And so,

05:14.654 --> 05:25.943
Starting from that perspective, it's easier for me than most to start at that perspective with biology, because I've studied it for so long.

05:26.383 --> 05:37.292
Somebody who's worked on carpentry their whole life and then finds out that there's a whole bunch of people pretending to be carpenters out there, but they're really not carpenters, and you can figure it out if you really listen to them,

05:37.992 --> 05:41.453
For a carpenter to really go back to the basics wouldn't be that hard.

05:41.493 --> 05:50.295
For you or me, who's never, you know, beyond using a table saw safely a few times in high school, I'm not a carpenter.

05:50.335 --> 06:04.018
And so if you told me that there are a bunch of people that are faking it out there, it would take me a lot of work to get to the point where I would be able to say, yeah, I guess I see it is really a crafty grift they got going on there.

06:05.236 --> 06:27.741
And so for me, I feel like I'm in a lucky position because at some point they, for a long time, I think these people grossly underestimated my previous mastery of general biology as a teacher and as a thinker and as a child.

06:29.278 --> 06:30.419
because that's the trick.

06:31.139 --> 06:42.227
They were coming at a kid who was a bird watcher and a snake collector and a repeat Merc manual reader.

06:42.427 --> 06:46.310
I used to check the Merc manual out of the

06:47.501 --> 06:49.323
The Kadat Public Library.

06:49.403 --> 06:52.967
The Merck Manual is the veterinary manual that all the vets use.

06:53.007 --> 07:00.074
It's just this book with a lot of marked indices and you can look up anything and read about all the diseases and all the farm animals.

07:01.255 --> 07:08.623
And I actually used to carry that around in my backpack as I dreamed about being a veterinarian for a long time.

07:08.683 --> 07:09.624
That was what I was going to do.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.446
And then I was going to be a marine biologist.

07:13.486 --> 07:15.068
And then I was told that was even worse.

07:16.029 --> 07:21.896
And then I settled on doctor and suddenly all the adults in the world said, right answer.

07:22.137 --> 07:29.986
And I stuck to that for quite some time, just not understanding what had happened and why I was answering that question with that answer.

07:32.478 --> 08:01.772
I don't know what to tell you, friends, I really don't, but I do think that we are at such a crucial point in human history, a crucial point in American history, a crucial point in your own history, where you can finally realize that you not only have responsibility over your actions and what you do with the rest of your life going forward, you have very much sole responsibility for that,

08:02.591 --> 08:23.147
but you have an opportunity to act in a way that could benefit your kids, benefit your brother's kids or your sister's kids, benefit your community and benefit Americans in generations to come that would otherwise not be free if we don't act now.

08:27.082 --> 08:50.195
And so endemicity is this idea that something, for example, released from a Petri dish, if it has the right combination of bases, you know, like a furin cleavage site or some HIV inserts in the spike protein, that it could be the most contagious virus in human history, and in less than five years go from being in a few stalls of a Wuhan market

08:51.837 --> 09:01.365
to most of the white-tailed deer in North America, most of the zoo animals around the world, and most of the humans have had it more than three times, some of them.

09:03.727 --> 09:11.253
And so this is a pretty gregarious RNA sequence, a pretty amazing RNA sequence.

09:11.293 --> 09:18.199
We should want to know every single detail about this sequence that allows this phenomenon to happen.

09:21.863 --> 09:43.391
But endemicity is the idea, and remember this very clearly, endemicity is the idea that there are other signals back there that we presume also started in a mud puddle or in a animal stall or in a whatever, and then spread through the entire human population to stay there forever.

09:44.291 --> 09:49.013
Endemicity is something that we use to describe other viruses.

09:49.793 --> 09:57.716
Those viruses are endemic and the word means that it started from a point and then became a background.

09:59.257 --> 10:07.640
And that is a phenomenon that must be accepted like the Big Bang or like evolution from a single bacteria.

10:08.500 --> 10:18.864
You have to accept it because there is no empirical proof of any kind to support such a miraculous slash ridiculous idea.

10:20.871 --> 10:37.797
And yet all of virology is based on the idea that if you use some genetic tools that have been made cheaper and higher fidelity by the endless development of the Human Genome Project, you can find signals in nature which represent endemic signals.

10:37.857 --> 10:45.680
Signals that started as a signal or a few hundred RNA molecules and are now an inestimable number of

10:46.440 --> 10:50.442
RNA molecules of the same class and sequence floating in the background.

10:50.582 --> 10:59.547
That's what endemicity is And understand that in all of these papers and in all of these Documentaries and all of these Hollywood movies.

10:59.587 --> 11:11.374
There's always somebody in there who's gonna say the word once even if it's only about racism being endemic and This concept is as

11:12.691 --> 11:19.154
as enchanting as the idea of a video going viral or an idea going viral.

11:19.234 --> 11:20.475
That's not how it happens.

11:20.635 --> 11:21.635
It's programmed in.

11:22.076 --> 11:28.579
They want you to believe that it's a spontaneous thing that occurs on social media because social media is a spontaneous thing.

11:32.901 --> 11:40.625
And so the background that I'm talking about is an irreducibly complex background because there are bacteria.

11:41.636 --> 12:03.469
And I should really be able to stop right there because every surface, every atmosphere you're in, every water you've ever been in, any chair you've ever sat on, every bathroom you've ever been in, has probably what is adequately described as an inestimable number of and variety of bacteria.

12:05.231 --> 12:14.319
If you think and believe that these scientists and biologists who say that we don't even know how many, we don't have all the insects in the book yet.

12:14.599 --> 12:16.581
We don't have all the plants in the book yet.

12:17.021 --> 12:20.284
How the hell do you think we have all the bacteria in the book yet then?

12:21.645 --> 12:22.426
Of course we don't.

12:23.727 --> 12:30.093
The ocean is a source of endless diversity from which we could never hope to adequately estimate.

12:31.243 --> 12:36.545
That's the reason why Craig Ventner is out there on a big boat, just trying to sample all the DNA he can read.

12:40.807 --> 12:58.255
I think it is really important to understand that the PCR tests that we use in academia, I used to use in academia to show something is in present, like, you know, a particular nicotinic receptor is present in a brain sample or not.

12:59.420 --> 13:08.102
a very small brain sample that you had reason to believe might have a specific subtype of nicotinic receptor.

13:08.122 --> 13:18.885
And then you make single primer pairs nested to fit these different subtypes of nicotinic receptors.

13:18.905 --> 13:25.067
And then you run all of those primers on those samples and they come up differentially for different samples.

13:26.297 --> 13:32.462
The only thing reviewers would allow me to do is do a plus or minus or a plus plus or a minus minus.

13:33.483 --> 13:36.065
They would not allow me to say that there was none.

13:37.646 --> 13:46.112
And that included controls for other subtypes, positive controls that overlapped all of them.

13:46.573 --> 13:50.716
And all of those things were required to be shown in the supplementary figures.

13:53.075 --> 13:59.159
just to go plus, plus, or minus, minus, not yes or no, not a cycle number.

14:00.981 --> 14:04.303
Although we were getting cycle numbers, we were doing quantitative PCR.

14:04.323 --> 14:11.608
We were doing many replicates to show that the quantitative PCR occurred roughly at the same cycle so that we were getting consistent results.

14:11.628 --> 14:17.072
We had to do it in triplicate, and then we could still only go plus, plus, or minus, minus, or plus, or minus.

14:20.069 --> 14:31.393
These people were trying to tell you that cycles matter in single with one set of primers that was specific for, I guess, one protein.

14:31.473 --> 14:41.057
But such a short sequence could be specific for any number of the irreducibly complex background signals that come from bacteria.

14:41.097 --> 14:44.398
But don't forget, also bacteriophages.

14:45.851 --> 14:55.335
That might be 10 times or 100 times more hot signal than the bacteria that are already inestimably dense in the background.

14:55.415 --> 15:00.618
Impossible to differentiate from or to do an adequate control for.

15:01.658 --> 15:05.040
But all these PCR tests that were released in 2022, or sorry, in 2020,

15:09.141 --> 15:13.104
were not specific for any one thing in the background.

15:13.524 --> 15:14.705
And they didn't have to be.

15:14.805 --> 15:20.788
All they had to be was something that they said was red, but was already there.

15:21.269 --> 15:25.832
And now you convert something that's already there into a new signal and it's going everywhere.

15:25.912 --> 15:28.093
Wow, we found a new deadly car.

15:29.154 --> 15:34.097
And it's this special model of Toyota and it's got really special wheels on the front.

15:34.377 --> 15:37.039
And it's also got inserts in the engine.

15:39.557 --> 15:44.520
And so you got to look in your garage and we're gonna search everybody that ever parks at a hospital.

15:45.461 --> 16:00.711
And if they have rubber wheels on their tires or any other, if they have a leather covered steering wheel, then we're gonna just consider them positive for this new dangerous car because the car is so dangerous.

16:01.271 --> 16:05.554
We would rather have false positives than false negatives.

16:05.694 --> 16:06.815
All of these arguments,

16:07.731 --> 16:15.839
benefit these yo-yos who wanted to and very successfully rolled out a non-specific PCR test in what?

16:16.360 --> 16:22.225
Concordance with a anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

16:22.926 --> 16:23.146
Right?

16:23.206 --> 16:23.947
That's what this is.

16:24.668 --> 16:26.690
Sorry, I didn't see I stopped that.

16:27.423 --> 16:50.018
And so you have an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality here, that they timed perfectly, that Fauci knew would be timed perfectly, that the people who work at the Human Genome Project knew would be timed perfectly, because it's very likely that this whole pandemic exercise was just part and parcel for the same Department of Energy top-level security

16:50.899 --> 17:11.974
national security priority the human genome project and look where we are in 2025 you have that giant top of that pyramid that's costing us so much money it's bankrupting social security bankrupting medicaid and the the ballooning national debt now just seems to happen to coincide with this too stop lying

17:13.155 --> 17:14.496
so that's what you see here.

17:15.197 --> 17:18.260
It's an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

17:18.300 --> 17:24.866
That thing rose up from decades ago and they timed this silliness perfectly.

17:25.606 --> 17:30.130
That's why they needed control of the FDA now because the FDA is the only

17:31.075 --> 17:46.120
governmental organization with any mandate to go back and look at the safety and effectivity of medical devices in 2020 and show that there were no effective medical devices in 2020.

17:46.461 --> 17:47.561
They were all bogus.

17:50.635 --> 17:59.804
More importantly, the FDA is the only organization that's tasked with regulating all of these things that are just in the way.

17:59.884 --> 18:00.705
It's just in the way.

18:00.765 --> 18:02.086
The FDA is just in the way.

18:02.226 --> 18:08.733
It's regulating what's on the label and the promises made on the label, and that's a problem for them.

18:10.615 --> 18:17.957
if they're going to admit to you that, you know, we're at the limit of what we can figure out with mouse studies, the beagles, we don't really need them anymore.

18:17.997 --> 18:34.780
And, you know, monkeys were never, they're just so, so, so costly and from, from all sides that, you know, it would just be easier if everybody would accept that you're going to have to be experimental animals.

18:35.540 --> 18:43.845
You're just gonna have to let us inject some things, and sometimes it's gonna go wrong, but if you let us keep track of stuff, we'll minimize it in the coming generations.

18:47.207 --> 18:53.610
And if you're at the table of technocrats making that choice, then all you gotta do is come up with a narrative where you don't ever have to really tell people that.

18:55.271 --> 19:03.176
You know, a narrative about a novel virus that killed millions of people, but millions more were saved from a not perfect, but pretty good vaccine.

19:04.406 --> 19:06.491
and another one could come again, so get ready.

19:07.153 --> 19:11.464
We're gonna keep trying to update this stuff and make sure that everything is safe and effective.

19:12.492 --> 19:17.853
So they took that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and they sculpted it using murder and lies.

19:17.894 --> 19:22.455
And those sophisticated lies are pretty, for at least doctors, it should be really simple.

19:22.955 --> 19:37.439
Anybody that was given supplementary oxygen during 2020 and 2021 and subsequently died without leaving the hospital, I think should be assumed to have been injured by the pure oxygen, the ARDS.

19:38.280 --> 19:44.443
if that's what ended up happening, classified as COVID pneumonia, and then not treated with antibiotics, those are all murders.

19:45.163 --> 19:55.048
And every doctor and hospitalist should be reflecting on what they did or what their staff did to identify if that pattern took place in their hospital.

19:55.068 --> 20:01.312
And if there did, they should put their big boy pants on or their big woman pants on and fricking tell the truth.

20:01.412 --> 20:02.132
That's murder.

20:03.479 --> 20:12.827
And if they ventilated people after they complained about pain from supplementary oxygen that they were given when they came into the hospital, that's also murder.

20:15.529 --> 20:28.139
They didn't treat any other septic, you know, urinary tract infection or pneumonia or whatever without using antibiotics, that's murder.

20:29.926 --> 20:44.251
Poor use of steroids is another way they could murder people because as Robert Malone admitted with Paul Cuttrell on some weirdo podcast with no viewers in August of 2021, dexamethasone is a hammer for the immune system.

20:44.291 --> 20:48.572
It's a great way to get people out of the hospital and back to the care home and not have to treat them anymore.

20:50.913 --> 20:57.195
But one of the worst signals here in America that allowed this murderous story to be told

20:58.249 --> 21:00.270
is this opioid death problem.

21:00.910 --> 21:03.871
And how it reduced all-cause mortality?

21:04.472 --> 21:04.712
No.

21:05.812 --> 21:08.253
How it reduced life expectancy.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.595
All-cause mortality was gonna go up, you see.

21:12.655 --> 21:14.596
There's no need to explain that.

21:14.656 --> 21:15.836
That was gonna go up.

21:15.876 --> 21:19.558
What you need to explain is why certain causes of death went up.

21:21.232 --> 21:28.277
certain causes of death that we've had under control for decades and got under control again suddenly abruptly at the end of 2022.

21:33.564 --> 21:51.109
There's just too much evidence here, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a paramilitary, multinational kind of organization, a kind of operation that's designed to, I don't know, are they trying to mitigate the disaster of the current population pyramid crash across Western civilization?

21:51.570 --> 21:53.410
Try to take advantage of that crisis?

21:53.850 --> 21:56.011
I think that's probably a more accurate

21:57.501 --> 21:59.842
a more accurate characterization of it.

22:00.282 --> 22:03.102
But I can assure you that RNA cannot pandemic.

22:03.582 --> 22:09.044
I can assure you that intramuscular injection is not a useful methodology for medicine.

22:09.984 --> 22:13.044
I can assure you that transfection was always what it was called.

22:13.565 --> 22:21.046
And that's why they avoided using the word for five years and why I was fired for using the word from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.567
And also I think later basically from Children's Health Defense.

22:25.387 --> 22:53.449
The population pyramid is a problem that needed managing, a problem that still needs managing, and a sort of biological fact that always was part of any military model, any long-term governance model, any long-term projection from a McKinsey Institute or from Shell Corporation would have included talking about the population pyramids and what those predict.

22:54.176 --> 22:56.157
about the future of those countries.

22:57.138 --> 23:05.304
I think one of the best ways to see through this is to realize that Brian Hooker of CHD in 2013 did not use the word autism.

23:05.804 --> 23:07.345
He didn't like the word autism.

23:07.785 --> 23:09.446
His son was vaccine damaged.

23:09.486 --> 23:14.350
He was neurologically damaged and he would not use the word autism.

23:24.557 --> 23:27.303
condition that we will not call autism.

23:27.443 --> 23:29.006
I don't like the word autism.

23:29.908 --> 23:30.790
He was vaccine damaged.

23:32.618 --> 23:35.899
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it.

23:36.199 --> 23:48.644
And that's why also we have Suzanne Humphreys in front of us now and on Joe Rogan and not Brandy Vaughn, for example, and Suzanne Humphreys now playing the role of pseudo skeptic.

23:50.245 --> 23:57.628
It is awful because she, like many others, has not made any logical progress in her understanding or in her messaging.

23:58.248 --> 24:09.417
and is still stuck in the same gray areas about whether vaccines are okay in some instances or in some concentrations or in some cases.

24:09.637 --> 24:13.000
And it's just, it is absolutely remarkable.

24:15.242 --> 24:22.848
often enough from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

24:23.389 --> 24:28.253
The reason why he said that on that podcast is because of me.

24:28.293 --> 24:43.486
It directly addresses the RNA cannot pandemic statement, and it addresses it in a very mealy-mouthed, cowardly way, in the same mealy-mouthed, cowardly way that this woman has been making money

24:44.733 --> 24:49.935
and living a pretty good life in America ever since she decided to be part of this show.

24:51.216 --> 24:59.500
And before that, she was in the UK doing the same shtick for 6 million votes on 90 billboards in her bra.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.561
Hello, boys.

25:06.122 --> 25:07.263
Brandy Vaughn is dead.

25:12.415 --> 25:25.300
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

25:25.421 --> 25:30.923
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

25:31.223 --> 25:33.184
It's just a big hassle in the end.

25:36.328 --> 25:49.535
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

25:49.575 --> 25:52.116
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

25:52.136 --> 25:55.118
Oops.

25:58.271 --> 26:00.713
I am very excited about this show today.

26:00.853 --> 26:03.816
It's been really hard to keep up with Mark Kulak.

26:04.477 --> 26:12.524
Mark Housatonic, ITS, has been doing some serious work and some serious archiving and of course now that we are

26:14.159 --> 26:25.887
Now that we are digging in the right place with some idea of what we're looking for, it starts to become really easy to find the fossils and the seashells and the little gold trinkets.

26:26.167 --> 26:32.191
And now Mark is starting to pull out great big treasure chests full of gold nuggets and crystal skulls.

26:32.431 --> 26:34.493
It's pretty nuts.

26:34.713 --> 26:40.657
I don't know what to say other than I'm very, very happy that I asked Mark, who the hell is that guy in that photo with Piper?

26:42.492 --> 26:44.713
This is Giggle and Biological, see you in a sec.

26:47.355 --> 27:07.707
I don't care how you get there.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.389
I don't care what you do to get there.

27:12.438 --> 27:13.080
goals do I?

27:30.698 --> 27:32.898
Yes, it is definitely game time.

27:32.998 --> 27:34.719
Ladies and gentlemen, game time.

27:34.739 --> 27:35.959
It is mail time.

27:35.979 --> 27:39.680
It is wonderful to be here.

27:39.780 --> 27:42.180
I know you're in the middle of your daily routine.

27:43.180 --> 27:43.560
Thank you.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.101
If I'm starting to become a part of it, I'm really happy.

27:47.461 --> 27:56.843
It is a long road we're on right now, but on your daily routine, it is going to be very tempting to take a break and go on social media and let that apparatus

27:57.563 --> 27:58.704
put thoughts in your head.

27:58.784 --> 27:59.424
Don't do it!

28:00.165 --> 28:00.685
Don't do it.

28:00.705 --> 28:03.968
The only non-compliance that matters is getting off of social media.

28:04.729 --> 28:09.472
I will spend some time there and bring what I learned to you.

28:10.913 --> 28:22.982
I can assure you that autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

28:23.993 --> 28:36.298
Pandemics and gain-of-function are also myths to do the same thing and they went full in all in on this pandemic gain-of-function scooby-doo operation because this is their last chance.

28:36.478 --> 28:40.499
This is their last chance because the population pyramids tell you why.

28:41.560 --> 28:47.122
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't understand the trap you're in, you won't understand why the cheese is free and you'll be dead.

28:47.842 --> 28:52.184
Or maybe a better way to say it is your grandchildren will be enslaved.

28:52.284 --> 28:55.326
Don't forget you need to learn the biology in order to get out.

28:55.666 --> 29:01.469
Otherwise they're just going to show you these really fancy computer cartoons and tell you they learned everything about folding proteins.

29:02.289 --> 29:06.651
Or that it's so cheap to sequence stuff now it's like a joke.

29:07.131 --> 29:10.573
And you can make gain-of-function viruses in your garage with eBay equipment.

29:13.613 --> 29:16.116
I am very, very happy to be here today.

29:16.176 --> 29:17.517
I feel energized.

29:17.577 --> 29:18.418
I feel excited.

29:18.699 --> 29:27.688
I'm a little taken aback by the number of landmarks that are lining up now.

29:29.212 --> 29:37.122
This whole Indian angle with the former ambassador from the Obama administration and Piper.

29:37.723 --> 29:40.346
It really is an American operation, ladies and gentlemen.

29:40.386 --> 29:47.135
I'm really convinced that they murdered people in America and then told the rest of the world that it was the start of a pandemic.

29:48.342 --> 29:52.966
And so if you've been here for a while, you've been hearing this for way too long and you're here at the top of the wave.

29:53.006 --> 29:59.811
If you're here for the first time, you might be a skilled TV watcher or a, a, a, what, how would we call you?

29:59.952 --> 30:04.255
A, um, um, a, a skilled social media user.

30:05.096 --> 30:08.939
And so you might not be aware of the strategy of staying focused on the biology.

30:08.979 --> 30:11.581
Don't take the bait on social media and mainstream media.

30:11.601 --> 30:12.242
They're just one big,

30:13.280 --> 30:16.442
malevolent chorus at this point, and love your neighbor.

30:17.363 --> 30:19.564
And that means more and more and more.

30:19.724 --> 30:21.626
You don't love your neighbor on social media.

30:21.646 --> 30:23.427
There are no neighbors on social media.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.988
That's not at all what I'm talking about.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.630
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

30:28.670 --> 30:33.494
I'm chief biologist at Giga Home Biological, coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

30:34.094 --> 30:41.999
You can find my academic work on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, under the last name Cooey, first name J. J.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.982
You can also find some of my work on a substack or two.

30:48.042 --> 30:50.082
They're usually lying or obfuscating things.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.243
I'm not on JC on a Bike right now.

30:52.283 --> 31:02.546
If you want to see where this all started for me when I was captured and first sort of met all these people, you can go to YouTube on JC on a Bike.

31:02.566 --> 31:06.948
But I'm not streaming there right now because for some reason I guess I don't have sufficient channel history.

31:07.948 --> 31:10.331
I also helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:10.391 --> 31:12.053
write his Wuhan cover-up book.

31:13.775 --> 31:19.722
I also worked as Children's Health Defense's staff scientist under Brian Hooker for about half a year in 2023 to 2024.

31:24.307 --> 31:27.269
I've also been good friends off and on with Jay Bhattacharya.

31:27.790 --> 31:32.654
Sometimes he defers to me as a biologist, other times he's a very big expert on everything.

31:33.815 --> 31:40.561
It's just the time frame of this whole thing leads me to believe that Jay Bhattacharya was never my friend, not even in those pictures.

31:40.582 --> 31:42.703
I can only just tell the truth.

31:46.126 --> 31:55.330
The way this thing works is that there are a select few people that have decided to give me $10 every month by going to Giga Home Biological and subscribing.

31:55.931 --> 31:56.951
They don't get a lot for that.

31:56.991 --> 31:58.512
You don't get a lot for that right now.

31:58.832 --> 32:07.796
I have intention to give you more, but right now this work and keeping up with this stuff and keeping my family out of trouble is about all I can do.

32:08.816 --> 32:24.482
but I'm very thankful for a few larger donors who make up the difference now and We we do get by we've gotten by for five years but I could and And would show you all of the paperwork of giga home biological to let you know that for example

32:25.862 --> 32:29.025
Our family was below the American poverty line last year.

32:29.045 --> 32:31.046
That doesn't mean much if I have an LLC.

32:31.086 --> 32:35.849
You know that there are ways to move stuff around in the background and make it make ends meet.

32:35.909 --> 32:38.671
But I assure you, we don't have a big savings account.

32:38.711 --> 32:44.955
We are renting our house in Pittsburgh for a ridiculous amount of money from an LLC that owns lots of other houses.

32:45.015 --> 32:46.456
I think you know what I'm talking about.

32:47.377 --> 32:52.320
And so if you if you want to go to Giga Home Biological and find a way to chip in, that would be great.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.461
We would be very grateful.

32:53.501 --> 32:54.942
We are still trying to find the

32:55.882 --> 33:03.406
the lawyer and the accountant to help us start a non-profit, a giga-ohm biological non-profit.

33:03.806 --> 33:10.149
This is the guy that I'm talking about, Mark Housatonic at housatonicics.com.

33:10.189 --> 33:10.850
Please go there.

33:10.870 --> 33:16.773
He has a research link there that you can go and read about a lot of these people, look at the archive that he's put together.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.614
It's really quite a magnificent piece of work.

33:18.634 --> 33:18.834
Whoops.

33:19.794 --> 33:21.775
Um, I think there was one more there, no?

33:21.955 --> 33:22.635
Oh no, okay.

33:23.455 --> 33:29.917
Um, Mark and I and Joe, uh, maybe a few other people are part of what I like to call an independent bright web.

33:30.278 --> 33:39.761
It's kind of the opposite of the intellectual dark web, which was actually a, basically a paramilitary internet organization made up of rich guys and their friends.

33:40.741 --> 33:52.711
Um, I don't... I was corrected the other day by a good friend of mine not to call this a military organization because it automatically makes people kind of jump to the thought of the U.S.

33:52.771 --> 33:58.856
military, but instead maybe paramilitary is a better word, and I have to take that criticism.

33:58.896 --> 33:59.897
I think I agree with that.

34:01.738 --> 34:04.200
The reason why I don't like that, of course,

34:05.925 --> 34:17.493
I don't like the idea of using military as the word to describe these people either is because I have also become convinced that it's not an exclusively US operation.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.855
It feels very, very global.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.236
There's a big Indian presence.

34:22.276 --> 34:24.678
There's a big UK presence.

34:24.718 --> 34:26.519
There's a big South African presence.

34:26.539 --> 34:30.442
There's actually, the UK presence could be kind of

34:31.360 --> 34:37.866
diluted as a UK, Australia, New Zealand kind of bullshit, all mixed in there.

34:37.906 --> 34:39.767
And Canada is also very nasty.

34:40.248 --> 34:51.817
There are a lot of Canadians that, quite frankly, I think might be working for one of many intelligence agencies, either in Canada or abroad, including some American intelligence agencies.

34:52.398 --> 34:55.180
And so it wouldn't surprise me at all if

34:56.502 --> 35:02.968
We're never going to really be able to adequately characterize this in terms that all of us collectively understand.

35:03.008 --> 35:07.512
You know, like, it's a British thing, or it's the city of London, or it's Freemasons.

35:07.592 --> 35:10.154
It's probably none of those things.

35:10.214 --> 35:14.018
It's probably people in or associated with a lot of those things.

35:14.098 --> 35:17.321
But it is a group of performers on the internet

35:18.001 --> 35:26.525
that is paid by these people and the organization of them and the tactics that they use are of a military level.

35:27.625 --> 35:35.789
And so as precisely as I can, I want you to see that they could communicate limitedly or extensively.

35:36.409 --> 35:38.710
They could exchange scripts or not.

35:38.770 --> 35:44.133
They could have been given a script and then allowed to go and then they're all kind of chaotically

35:44.813 --> 35:49.838
you know, responding to one another without clear, there's all different ways where it could be done.

35:49.918 --> 35:53.782
And I am definitely not of a mind where the U.S.

35:53.862 --> 35:57.606
military is somehow screwing over the whole world with this.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.909
This is, that's not what's happening.

35:59.989 --> 36:00.489
If the U.S.

36:00.529 --> 36:05.795
military is involved, it is involved in the same way that likely

36:06.375 --> 36:15.325
The German military, the Dutch military, the British military, MI6, you know, whatever things you want to list are probably involved.

36:18.288 --> 36:22.994
Ultimately, I think you need to explain why Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project is involved.

36:23.034 --> 36:24.996
It ain't because he's a cannabis activist.

36:29.485 --> 36:37.173
I think ultimately you've got to ask yourself why the guy who was charged with setting up the Wimber Institute is involved.

36:38.134 --> 36:42.098
Especially since, yeah, it's really remarkable.

36:42.278 --> 36:50.587
I mean, you have to ask yourself why Eric Weinstein and Brett Weinstein and the intellectual dark web are involved.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.582
because they are involved.

36:52.602 --> 37:00.997
They are not a loosely organized group of dudes that wanted to start podcasts and fight against the heterodoxy.

37:02.965 --> 37:04.286
That's bullshit.

37:04.986 --> 37:06.906
That's just absolute bullshit.

37:06.946 --> 37:08.567
These people were inserted.

37:09.127 --> 37:24.212
That's the reason why Bret Weinstein, before the pandemic, was allowed to go in front of the Senate and complain about what happened to him at Evergreen University, so that as many people as possible that needed Bret would see Bret.

37:24.412 --> 37:27.833
It's not that dissimilar from what is said in that

37:30.134 --> 37:42.203
in that silly book i don't even remember what it's called anymore um uh morals and dogma where they say if you know we need heroes we will provide them the people that think

37:43.467 --> 37:50.172
Understand one thing, Bret Weinstein and Heather Haying and their scripted bullshit are useful on both sides of the coin.

37:50.632 --> 38:06.124
They are useful if you find Bret Weinstein compelling and soothing, and you find Heather soothing and insightful, or if you find them annoying and conspiratorial and egoistic and ridiculous.

38:07.056 --> 38:09.036
They're useful on both sides of that coin.

38:09.436 --> 38:18.258
And the beautiful thing about social media is that neither Brett nor Heather needs to see the way that they are used in the negative way.

38:18.698 --> 38:27.000
They can just be aware of, and even just shown the way that they are given accolades and supported, and their stance is confirmed.

38:32.028 --> 38:39.534
They can use social media against the exact people who think they are part of social media.

38:41.936 --> 39:00.150
And so this is a depth of understanding that I think very few people have ever gotten to in the terms of even considering the idea that Brett Weinstein could also be fooled by X and his interaction with it, even as he is told behind the scenes that X will be gamed for him.

39:01.735 --> 39:04.877
that locals will be gamed for him, that YouTube will be gamed for him.

39:04.897 --> 39:11.242
He could be told all of that, and then they could do something else and tell him that he's seeing something else.

39:12.823 --> 39:17.606
And never be aware of how many people, Bret Weinstein, people think he's an idiot.

39:21.168 --> 39:23.170
And I think it's likely that that's occurring.

39:26.038 --> 39:35.930
They can also have friends of their friends fund people like Tommy, and then have Tommy be on Rumble every day, all the time.

39:35.950 --> 39:42.698
And have these people go on Tommy's podcast and talk to him.

39:44.833 --> 40:08.253
Is it really that the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project and multi-millionaire entrepreneur and his sidekick, Jessica Rose, with five post-secondary degrees, Canadian-Israeli, they're really going on the Tommy podcast to discuss the DNA contamination.

40:09.193 --> 40:12.016
They really think that that's pushing the ball forward.

40:13.055 --> 40:22.123
Because the people that watch him play Call of Duty are interested in the truth, and if they just heard it, they would get off their Call of Duty ass and change things?

40:26.407 --> 40:27.548
Or are they performers?

40:29.370 --> 40:30.811
Are they doing a job here?

40:32.312 --> 40:36.456
And he's just an unwitting, probably addict clown.

40:38.962 --> 40:41.644
It's very bad where we are in America, ladies and gentlemen.

40:41.664 --> 40:45.406
There's no explanation for this other than we have been fooled.

40:47.307 --> 40:50.649
Nobody in America knows who Kevin McKernan is except us.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.151
And those people who needed to see Kevin McKernan.

40:56.272 --> 41:01.515
Nobody in America knows who Robert Malone is except those people who kind of might have needed to see him.

41:02.776 --> 41:04.238
They clicked the right boxes.

41:04.999 --> 41:11.087
They pushed the right algorithmic button so that the algorithm said, hey, this was a person who's asking too many questions.

41:11.648 --> 41:12.709
Give him Robert Malone.

41:14.031 --> 41:15.533
Give him Del Bigtree.

41:15.894 --> 41:18.958
Send him to that old Andrew Wakefield video.

41:22.881 --> 41:28.707
And that is exactly how we got here, where we thought that getting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:28.747 --> 41:36.254
into HHS Secretary by electing Donald Trump was going to be somehow three-dimensional, four-dimensional chess that would be checkmate.

41:38.115 --> 41:45.983
And instead, what we have is a malevolent show being run on the front by Steve Bannon,

41:48.401 --> 41:52.683
and Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein and a bunch of other clowns on the internet.

41:52.703 --> 42:03.187
I mean a bunch of other clowns that are all associated with one another ever since really 2008 and that Wall Street nonsense with Tim Pool and Luke Rudowsky.

42:03.607 --> 42:11.090
It's all one continuous buildup of media personalities on the internet that are all bullshit.

42:11.730 --> 42:11.790
All

42:12.910 --> 42:18.437
Either unwitting or people that are witting to go along with it once they were told what they were going to be doing.

42:19.118 --> 42:20.400
You're part of the ruling elite.

42:21.786 --> 42:23.627
You can't tell everybody everything anymore.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.548
You know, like Tucker Carlson has done for the last 20 years.

42:27.088 --> 42:33.290
This is all one malevolent show now on a very sophisticated biological script.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.931
And we know that for sure now.

42:35.631 --> 42:50.696
I started to see it and started to articulate it about a year ago, but Mary Holland and Paul Offit and their endless dance around each other for the last 15 years is the best evidence that this has been a bullshit show all along.

42:55.575 --> 42:57.016
Absolutely the best evidence.

42:57.216 --> 43:07.103
And now, if you want more evidence, what you need to do is go to the internet and look at the evidence that this was always an intelligence operation.

43:07.684 --> 43:14.288
This was always an elaborate performance on the internet, again, provided to anybody who needed it.

43:15.249 --> 43:22.334
Put in the right keywords, do the right searches, follow the right people on X, and inevitably you ran into this.

43:24.395 --> 43:28.921
And for those that found it appealing, it was extremely misleading.

43:29.081 --> 43:32.565
And it's not that you got your champions where they needed to go.

43:33.206 --> 43:36.791
They got their saboteurs where they always wanted them.

43:39.960 --> 43:46.523
The ruling class has gotten their saboteurs exactly where they wanted them in the places that they wanted.

43:46.963 --> 43:51.545
And you thought it was that they wanted to avoid Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.006
getting HHS secretary.

43:53.046 --> 43:56.227
They gave him a real hard, a confirmation hearing.

43:56.247 --> 43:58.148
Boy, those were some hard hitting questions.

43:58.608 --> 44:01.309
And I was pretty disappointed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:01.349 --> 44:02.570
said he wasn't anti-vax.

44:04.522 --> 44:17.471
Meanwhile, Marty McCarty, McCarty is at the head of FDA, the organization they wanted to neutralize from the very beginning that, that this foreigner says that, you know, it's probably America would be better off without.

44:17.851 --> 44:27.038
And this foreigner agrees that, yeah, it's probably better off without, but, but, but now you're at the head of the center for biologics evaluation and research.

44:30.812 --> 44:32.254
It's just scripted bullshit, right?

44:32.294 --> 44:32.615
So is this.

44:43.939 --> 44:45.320
Significant shift this week.

44:45.340 --> 44:47.302
Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy jr.

44:47.442 --> 44:49.023
Joined by FDA commissioner.

44:49.043 --> 44:50.184
It's hard to keep up.

44:50.524 --> 44:59.251
And NIH director, Dr. J Bhattacharya announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant individuals.

44:59.772 --> 45:00.892
That sparked concerns.

45:01.093 --> 45:07.638
What I'm trying to suggest to you is that this UK American dual citizen named Marty Makari,

45:09.133 --> 45:15.055
as part of a Trojan horse, that we were all focused on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:15.135 --> 45:26.919
swinging from chains and doing push-ups without a shirt on, that we didn't see right in front of us what was happening with the complete undermining takeover of the FDA.

45:28.115 --> 45:42.407
which will again assure that the clock on the illusion of pandemics and PCR is diagnostics and sequencing as phylogeny and all of this stuff is going to go unevaluated.

45:44.628 --> 45:46.490
And we're going to keep looking forward.

45:50.236 --> 45:55.599
The FDA is supposed to evaluate what's on a label and make sure that what's on the label is in the box.

45:55.760 --> 46:00.122
And the FDA has never done that for a PCR test ever.

46:01.343 --> 46:02.684
Please understand that.

46:03.264 --> 46:12.210
The FDA is supposed to evaluate what's on the box, on the bottle, and make sure that what's on the label is actually what's in the bottle or on the box.

46:13.711 --> 46:16.873
And they have never done that for PCR testing.

46:18.311 --> 46:23.294
Of course, they would never do it for sequencing either, because sequencing isn't a medical diagnostic anymore.

46:23.334 --> 46:25.696
It's just a measurement, a scientific thing.

46:27.697 --> 46:28.818
So you see where we are.

46:29.838 --> 46:45.048
We have an unevaluated diagnostic being used around the world, in every hospital, and in many doctors' offices, providing an endless remnant stream of genetic material, and no useful diagnostic

46:45.945 --> 46:53.807
information at all, except for the illusion that there are many things in the background moving around asymptomatically.

46:54.207 --> 47:05.270
Now, I agree, there are many things in the background, but they're not moving from person to person, killing yourselves on the way to the next person all the time, like the virology of their mythology says.

47:05.790 --> 47:14.333
And this guy is a surgeon, a UK citizen, American citizen, a surgeon who decided to get a master's in public health.

47:15.793 --> 47:17.514
I mean, that doesn't even make any sense.

47:20.475 --> 47:21.936
And he's the head of the FDA now.

47:22.016 --> 47:23.497
On PBS NewsHour last week.

47:23.657 --> 47:24.057
Have fun.

47:24.617 --> 47:27.259
Some public health officials and medical professionals.

47:27.639 --> 47:30.260
But Commissioner McCary has defended the new guidelines.

47:30.440 --> 47:34.362
He joins us now to discuss that and other major health news.

47:34.422 --> 47:35.443
Commissioner, welcome to the news.

47:35.483 --> 47:36.143
Good to be with you, Amna.

47:36.203 --> 47:37.124
Thanks for being here.

47:37.204 --> 47:39.185
So let's start with that vaccine announcement.

47:39.225 --> 47:45.528
As you've heard, some people say this was an end run around CDC that doesn't currently have a permanent director.

47:45.888 --> 47:50.091
There's an advisory council on vaccinations that usually weighs in on these decisions.

47:50.151 --> 47:52.292
They are scheduled to meet in late June.

47:52.852 --> 47:55.594
Why not wait for them to meet before making any kind of announcement?

47:55.854 --> 47:59.495
So most of America has said no to the COVID booster last year.

47:59.515 --> 48:04.677
About 85% of health care workers refused the COVID booster last year.

48:05.297 --> 48:08.438
And very few children are getting the COVID booster.

48:08.878 --> 48:12.279
For 88% of children, their parents said no to the COVID booster.

48:12.740 --> 48:14.660
So we can't have this huge disconnect.

48:14.700 --> 48:16.961
And the reality is- What do you hear, my friends?

48:17.441 --> 48:22.063
As your biology coach, I would like to point out or try to coach you to what you hear.

48:23.503 --> 48:27.984
I'm going to go back a second, and I'm going to try and make you listen to it again.

48:28.024 --> 48:34.065
People want to either see more data or... June, why not wait for them to meet before making any kind of announcement?

48:34.285 --> 48:37.926
So, most of America has said no to the COVID booster last year.

48:38.106 --> 48:46.868
About 85% of healthcare workers refused the COVID booster last year, and very few children are getting the COVID booster.

48:47.288 --> 48:50.649
For 88% of children, their parents said no to the COVID booster.

48:51.149 --> 48:53.070
So we can't have this huge disconnect.

48:53.110 --> 48:57.051
And the reality is people want to either see more data or they have some concerns.

48:57.151 --> 49:01.252
And so we need to provide that data for the public to make the case.

49:01.452 --> 49:11.676
So what I hear him saying there is that Americans are making a choice and the choice is no healthcare workers made the choice.

49:11.736 --> 49:13.916
They refused the booster.

49:17.398 --> 49:17.958
And so the,

49:19.912 --> 49:31.257
The language chosen there is very important because refusing the booster also seems to suggest that they were offered it or encouraged to take it, suggested they should have it.

49:31.778 --> 49:33.038
You fill in the blank, right?

49:33.498 --> 49:36.120
That's the neurolinguistic programming going on here.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.421
And I think that's why this is a Trojan horse.

49:39.501 --> 49:42.643
Why would we have this UK American guy

49:44.008 --> 49:46.809
on the PBS NewsHour instead of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:46.849 --> 50:00.272
They had him on when he was running for president, but now when he's head of Health and Human Services, this FDA guy is on Face the Nation, and on PBS NewsHour, and on all these news programs, on Megyn Kelly.

50:03.633 --> 50:09.575
And he's doing his own FDA podcast with Vinay Prasad and some other Indian girl who's the associate director of something.

50:11.027 --> 50:17.954
Right now, when we came into office, there was this absolute universal recommendation at the CDC.

50:18.114 --> 50:29.144
And so the secretary consulted with a number of physicians and decided that he wanted to turn that decision back to a physician and the patient, and we would be more in line with Europe.

50:29.324 --> 50:35.931
Because in the UK, for example, they only recommend the COVID booster if you're 75 years of age and high risk,

50:36.471 --> 50:38.853
Or in France, it's 80 years of age and high risk.

50:38.893 --> 50:41.115
So we're really getting closer to the European model.

50:41.155 --> 50:48.600
And then the idea that you need a COVID booster every year in perpetuity, that is a young baby born today needs 80 shots in her average lifetime.

50:49.021 --> 50:52.243
That was a theory, a theory that's not- That was a theory?

50:53.544 --> 50:54.785
Nobody had that theory.

50:56.547 --> 51:00.490
Nobody had an infinite booster theory, except for maybe Peter Hotez.

51:00.710 --> 51:03.512
And you can find videos where it seems like he had that theory.

51:05.351 --> 51:09.332
Nobody's arguing that and nobody would be willing to accept that.

51:09.412 --> 51:13.854
This is a ridiculous argument that now you're going to get data on that or what?

51:14.714 --> 51:20.455
Or you're not going to be recommending multiple boosters because we don't have data on multiple boosters.

51:20.976 --> 51:22.876
What an interesting jackass this is.

51:22.896 --> 51:25.777
Not supported with any randomized control trial data.

51:26.037 --> 51:30.438
We know the uptake has been low, as you mentioned, but what's their science and data behind this?

51:30.498 --> 51:32.499
Or was this just a decision to end the recommendation?

51:32.659 --> 51:40.125
Well, that's exactly the problem is that we don't have the data to support that repeat vaccination booster strategy every year in perpetuity.

51:40.185 --> 51:43.288
If you get a hepatitis A vaccine, it's one shot.

51:43.308 --> 51:47.791
We don't have the data to support endless coronavirus vaccines.

51:47.931 --> 51:51.074
What a stupid nonsense argument.

51:51.114 --> 51:53.256
What a dumb question to argue about.

51:53.336 --> 51:55.277
What a dumb question to discuss.

51:55.898 --> 51:59.481
What a perfectly malevolent hamster wheel this guy is a part of.

52:00.356 --> 52:01.937
We are trapped in America.

52:01.997 --> 52:02.717
We need help.

52:02.817 --> 52:04.097
We need to get out of this.

52:06.058 --> 52:07.999
You don't have to watch PBS NewsHour.

52:08.039 --> 52:11.220
You just need to understand that this is where it is.

52:12.841 --> 52:14.482
This is where the narrative is.

52:14.562 --> 52:17.963
This is where it sits for at least half of America.

52:22.014 --> 52:25.976
If you get a hepatitis B or MMR, it's two, depending on the age group.

52:26.316 --> 52:34.080
And so the idea that you need 80 shots in your lifetime in the average lifespan of a woman for the COVID booster is a theory that's unsubstantiated.

52:34.140 --> 52:35.040
Some have concerns.

52:35.060 --> 52:44.104
There's still people who claim- That's a quite different argument than what some people at CHD and ICANN were saying was extraordinary, that there was like 72 shots before 18.

52:47.222 --> 52:53.928
Now we have a whole nother argument set up here with a whole nother set of questions and justifications.

52:54.188 --> 52:56.650
It is a hamster wheel of liars.

53:00.213 --> 53:06.459
When Brian didn't use the word autism in 2013 because he didn't like the word autism, his son was vaccine damaged.

53:06.499 --> 53:07.900
He was neurologically injured.

53:08.933 --> 53:11.476
And so you don't need to call that autism.

53:12.097 --> 53:18.484
There could be an autism spectrum that is genetically caused and it's a bunch of different kinds of goofy people.

53:18.564 --> 53:22.548
That's fine with me, with some with talents and some with handicaps.

53:22.588 --> 53:23.409
That's fine with me.

53:23.930 --> 53:24.691
You want to do that.

53:26.001 --> 53:53.392
But we are talking about a very specific thing when we talk about Paulie Tommy's son, and we talk about Brian Hooker's son, and we talk about all of these other people who after injections had a rather fast, if not abrupt change in the behavior and stability of their children.

53:58.496 --> 54:01.559
We are in a very malevolent trap, ladies and gentlemen.

54:01.579 --> 54:03.962
I have no other way to say it.

54:04.002 --> 54:06.584
I know because I had kids in Norway.

54:06.704 --> 54:13.071
I know because I tried to raise some kids in the Netherlands for a little while.

54:14.172 --> 54:19.137
I know how it is in other societies that are very similar to ours.

54:19.418 --> 54:21.660
I can tell you that America is in trouble right now.

54:23.757 --> 54:25.479
And we need to pull our heads out.

54:25.859 --> 54:36.190
We need to understand that mainstream media and social media are one malevolent chorus that has somehow been weaponized to control, demolish America.

54:36.230 --> 54:41.336
That's why they're talking like, oh, it doesn't matter if we're $25 trillion or debt.

54:42.377 --> 54:43.538
What difference does that make?

54:43.618 --> 54:45.240
No, we are really at a precipice.

54:46.844 --> 54:47.804
These people knew it.

54:48.425 --> 54:59.868
A precipice of economics, a precipice of banking, a precipice of population pyramid change and instability.

55:00.468 --> 55:05.050
Honestly, I can't see it any other way than these people with this multi-generational

55:05.911 --> 55:17.377
view of a ruling elite have always planned to use this as a transition to essentially make nation states irrelevant.

55:18.238 --> 55:22.440
A lot of the way nation states are kind of irrelevant in the EU right now.

55:24.221 --> 55:26.342
And I believe that's coming for North America.

55:26.442 --> 55:32.786
I believe that the collapse of the dollar will probably be replaced by another currency that may or may not be digital.

55:34.884 --> 55:37.645
But for sure, for sure, this is a plan.

55:38.026 --> 55:38.986
It is a script.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.768
And that explains the certainty of people like him.

55:45.409 --> 55:47.611
And not the certainty he displays now.

55:47.731 --> 55:50.272
I'm talking about the certainty that he displayed in 2020, in 2021, and in 2022.

55:50.352 --> 55:51.593
Because that certainty

55:57.028 --> 56:07.638
This certainty that you see here, this confidence and swagger is born of the five years of being repeatedly told that you are helping this operation.

56:07.678 --> 56:09.379
You are a part of this operation.

56:09.479 --> 56:11.121
You are hitting all the marks.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.484
We are going to put you in the place that we promised.

56:17.372 --> 56:18.573
This is a Trojan horse.

56:18.833 --> 56:20.934
America has been infiltrated.

56:21.535 --> 56:25.698
In vaccine injury, I've heard of people who have died from the vaccine.

56:25.738 --> 56:28.539
It's rare, but these are questions that the public has.

56:28.600 --> 56:34.443
And so at the FDA, we've done our job to put out guidance in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.

56:34.864 --> 56:40.568
And that guidance basically says for young, healthy individuals, we'd like to see, this is a good time to check in with.

56:40.708 --> 56:47.072
Now, remember, they put out a New England Journal of Medicine, a British Medical Journal article, him and Vinay,

56:47.673 --> 56:51.899
And they were very excited about their evidence-based approach to COVID vaccines.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.024
And, you know, it's going to find, it is so gross.

56:56.907 --> 56:58.149
It is so gross.

56:59.983 --> 57:03.025
Vinay Prasad is probably the fakest person on earth.

57:22.737 --> 57:26.320
Four and five years ago, it was proven to be safe and effective.

57:26.361 --> 57:29.604
She just said it was proven to be safe and effective, just so you know.

57:30.104 --> 57:32.006
And he says four and five years ago.

57:32.026 --> 57:35.109
Does that sound like questioning the narrative?

57:37.651 --> 57:37.911
Sure.

57:38.092 --> 57:42.095
That's when it was implemented in the rush to the pandemic response.

57:42.155 --> 57:45.599
In the rush to the pandemic, the first dose, he says.

57:48.717 --> 57:50.222
COVID shot bad, don't talk about 2020.

57:50.643 --> 57:52.710
Well, we rushed it, she says.

57:53.212 --> 57:53.834
In the rush.

57:56.032 --> 58:01.573
There is, I should mention, a new COVID variant that's been gaining momentum overseas, has now landed in the States.

58:02.134 --> 58:04.314
Are you anticipating a summer uptick?

58:04.374 --> 58:11.796
And if people choose to get the booster, if they- You see there's a COVID variant that's now landed in America.

58:11.876 --> 58:21.339
So the ongoing spread evolution of this thing is, as he said on the other program we watched yesterday, it's become endemic.

58:21.379 --> 58:22.259
Now it's the fifth.

58:22.799 --> 58:26.360
human coronavirus that is just endemic in the background.

58:28.861 --> 58:29.981
They want to get it now.

58:30.562 --> 58:31.162
What does that mean?

58:31.182 --> 58:32.322
They have to pay for it out of pocket?

58:33.062 --> 58:35.263
Well, that's up to every individual insurance company.

58:35.303 --> 58:38.444
Again, vast majority of Americans have said no to the COVID booster.

58:38.464 --> 58:41.045
For those who want to get it, they'll be able to get it.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.026
There's still going to be vaccines available.

58:43.166 --> 58:46.207
But if it's not recommended, it's likely not going to be covered by insurance, correct?

58:46.227 --> 58:47.447
That's up to insurance companies.

58:47.507 --> 58:51.989
I mean, I would love some cancer therapies to be covered by certain insurance companies, and they've chosen not to.

58:52.529 --> 58:55.972
So we're going to turn this decision back to patients and their doctors.

58:55.992 --> 58:58.595
We're going to get more in line with where the public is.

58:59.255 --> 59:10.546
The sort of absolutism of you must get your COVID shot every year, even if you're young, healthy, a 12-year-old girl, that disconnect, it's not healthy to be that disconnected from the public.

59:10.566 --> 59:15.030
And the reality is we'd like to see a clinical trial supporting that repeat booster strategy.

59:15.290 --> 59:24.376
I want to ask you about some reporting just today from the news organization, Notice, about that landmark Maha report you put out recently, the Make America Healthy Again report.

59:24.756 --> 59:28.479
They found that it cited a number of sources that don't appear to exist at all.

59:28.519 --> 59:30.840
At least one scientist's name included on a paper.

59:30.880 --> 59:32.481
She says she never wrote.

59:32.541 --> 59:35.403
When we checked on the report later today, it looked like it had been updated.

59:35.483 --> 59:37.965
Some of those false sources and names were removed.

59:38.005 --> 59:42.548
But what do you want people to know about how that bad information got in there in the first place?

59:43.328 --> 59:46.130
how that bad information got in there in the first place.

59:46.170 --> 59:56.657
We got some author names mixed up on papers in a article with 250 citations because we're just really, you know, it's a whole team of people.

59:56.977 --> 59:57.918
I didn't look at everything.

59:57.938 --> 01:00:01.100
500 references and citations in that report.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.341
It's an incredible report.

01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:08.285
Like I've written medical journal studies and the peer review literature and some of- It's an incredible report.

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:09.766
I have ne- Wow.

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:11.007
What a- Wow.

01:00:11.787 --> 01:00:18.811
The citations may not be perfect in the way that they're described there, but... But do you include citations that don't exist for sources that don't exist?

01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:25.134
I haven't double-checked those citations, but I can tell you that the content of that Maha Commission report is amazing.

01:00:25.275 --> 01:00:27.296
It's game- It's amazing.

01:00:27.436 --> 01:00:28.736
It's game-changing.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:38.882
...changing because now we're talking about microplastics and pesticides and seed oils and the fact that 70% of the food consumed by kids is ultra-processed.

01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:40.283
I don't think our obesity

01:00:41.003 --> 01:00:44.326
Diabetes epidemic in children is a willpower problem.

01:00:44.386 --> 01:00:45.527
I don't think it's their fault.

01:00:45.587 --> 01:00:47.648
I think this is something we are doing to kids.

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:59.938
And this report changes the entire discussion in health, because we can talk about Medicare payments and states and, you know, site-neutral payments, which is a reform that Bemidaz has put forth.

01:01:00.638 --> 01:01:11.943
But the ultimate driver of our health care costs in America, of our health care crisis and the affordability crisis and the health disparities that result, is the worsening health of the population.

01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:16.024
And we have not been talking about the health of the population.

01:01:16.144 --> 01:01:19.265
It has been a 50-year failure of American health care.

01:01:19.386 --> 01:01:25.668
American medicine's amazing at high sophisticated operations and chemo and proton beam therapy.

01:01:25.688 --> 01:01:27.269
But when it comes to the health of population,

01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:34.156
It has been a 50-year failure, and no one has talked about root causes until this Maha Commission report.

01:01:34.517 --> 01:01:35.578
It's unbelievable.

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:46.971
And I know it is a priority for you on this message, but to get back to the report, if you want people to trust what's in it, and there were false sources and scientists who didn't work on these papers, are you worried people won't trust you?

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:51.454
Every one of those citations that I read and every line of that report was solid.

01:01:51.494 --> 01:02:01.039
Now, I took a hard look at that report and I thought this is an amazing game changing discussion that for the first time in history is talking about.

01:02:01.139 --> 01:02:02.900
See how on message he is.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.362
He is well sharpened.

01:02:06.362 --> 01:02:08.644
Like this is one of their knives in their drawer.

01:02:09.444 --> 01:02:10.485
It ain't Bobby Kennedy.

01:02:11.411 --> 01:02:17.123
His 12 scripted things he says, he's running out of that stuff now.

01:02:17.464 --> 01:02:18.586
This guy is a player.

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:21.386
and part of the real Trojan horse.

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:26.488
About the fact that 40% of American kids have a chronic disease.

01:02:27.768 --> 01:02:32.010
What that means for the future of American health care is very concerning.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.511
And we can't keep blaming kids for this problem.

01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:42.354
At the FDA, we're doing... See, they're concerned about the future of American health care, but the future of American health care had nothing to do with COVID.

01:02:42.874 --> 01:02:43.395
Nothing at all.

01:02:43.715 --> 01:02:49.840
In our part of that report, we have taken action to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the food supply.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.184
So our kids don't have these petroleum-based chemicals in their system.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:03:00.829
We're going to remove all chemicals, including 1,000-plus chemicals banned in Europe that appear in the U.S.

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:01.550
food supply.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:02.031
Why?

01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:06.214
And so we're asking big questions on root causes that we've never asked before.

01:03:06.454 --> 01:03:07.896
We've got to talk about school lunches.

01:03:08.556 --> 01:03:09.657
not just chemotherapy.

01:03:09.697 --> 01:03:12.178
We gotta talk about activity.

01:03:12.318 --> 01:03:35.491
The agreement between Peter McCullough and James Lyons-Weiler that you should see as you discuss it in the chat is that Peter McCullough produced a video about a month ago saying that he didn't think that autism was caused by aluminum or mercury because aluminum and mercury have very specific neurological effects that you don't always see in autistic kids.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.891
It's a much wider spectrum of effects.

01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.853
And so he doubts it's that.

01:03:44.175 --> 01:03:56.203
And so for James Lyons Weiler to say, well, it might be aluminum, it might be mercury, it might be the genetic ability to detox aluminum or detox mercury, and maybe you're not built with that, or your detox proteins are shittier than mine.

01:03:57.443 --> 01:04:03.948
It's, number one, first and foremost, accepts the existence of a phenomenon

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:12.909
for which there is a single or a few causes that are still unknown, but as soon as we find them, we'll be able to fix it.

01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:21.937
And on the flip side of that coin is the, well, there's so many different causes, we're never gonna nail it down to one.

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:27.441
So there's no reason to nail it down to one, you know, like intramuscular injection.

01:04:27.922 --> 01:04:30.704
It could be any number of things, including that.

01:04:32.987 --> 01:04:45.151
And so it's not that dissimilar to how they trapped us in the lab leak or natural virus gets you to accept that there are viruses that are circulating all by themselves and going from a mud puddle to endemicity.

01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:57.835
This same kind of hamster wheel is occurring here where you're thinking about all the different causes for the chronic diseases and are the chronic diseases the same as autism and is allergies the same as autism?

01:04:57.875 --> 01:04:58.875
Is it all one thing?

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.458
And it doesn't matter because there are so many things.

01:05:03.618 --> 01:05:09.401
It could be all the exhaust I inhale every day, or all the food that I eat, or it's all the sunscreen I put on.

01:05:09.861 --> 01:05:18.966
And it's as many different answers as possible at this point makes his job as easy as possible because there's no wrong answer then.

01:05:20.407 --> 01:05:22.370
And he never has to give you an answer then.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:25.335
And this guy is exactly the script they needed.

01:05:25.835 --> 01:05:28.239
Not the one that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:28.279 --> 01:05:30.783
has been learning for the last 10 years.

01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:34.048
The one that Mary Holland has been keeping him on for the last 10 years.

01:05:34.088 --> 01:05:35.050
They need this script.

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:44.306
and chemicals and light exposure in children, circadian rhythms, all of it's in the report.

01:05:44.686 --> 01:05:47.148
We can't just keep talking about having every kid.

01:05:47.168 --> 01:05:52.092
Just make sure you know that I grew up in a school with fluorescent lights and I'm fine.

01:05:52.132 --> 01:05:54.854
I don't think fluorescent lights in the school are killing anybody.

01:05:54.874 --> 01:06:05.102
Um, led lights could be much worse because they flicker when they have a pulse pulse mediated, you know, like when they, their brightness is created by flashing.

01:06:05.642 --> 01:06:06.283
That sucks.

01:06:06.503 --> 01:06:07.644
I agree with that for sure.

01:06:09.107 --> 01:06:09.968
hit on Ozempic.

01:06:10.308 --> 01:06:14.351
We're not on a good path, and this agenda, I think, is laid out beautifully in the Mahan report.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:19.894
Mr. Chairman, I want to note you're not sharing how those false sources got in there, but you're asking people to trust the information in there.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.976
Regardless, we can talk about that more another time.

01:06:22.016 --> 01:06:29.240
I do want to ask you, though, about the last time we talked, I asked you about the medication abortion Mifepristone.

01:06:29.521 --> 01:06:31.722
You said you had no plans to pull access for that.

01:06:31.762 --> 01:06:36.705
You were waiting to see more data coming in to review it, to see if you make a decision or not.

01:06:36.886 --> 01:06:37.946
Why would they review this?

01:06:39.808 --> 01:06:41.229
What is this discussion about?

01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:46.915
This discussion accepts the idea that it's okay if you're pregnant to get rid of a baby.

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:48.536
Just do it.

01:06:49.117 --> 01:06:49.618
It's fine.

01:06:50.198 --> 01:06:51.459
Why would we prevent it?

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.042
Why would we discourage people from doing it?

01:06:54.863 --> 01:06:55.564
It's your choice.

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:57.826
We don't need babies.

01:07:01.306 --> 01:07:04.768
It's a real dark thing, because they're not going to even, it's really dark.

01:07:05.028 --> 01:07:10.610
When you last spoke, have you seen any additional information that tells you you have to make a decision one way or the other?

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:18.534
I still have the same view I had when we had that discussion, and that is I've got no preconceived plans to take action on that drug.

01:07:19.094 --> 01:07:20.955
We are constantly looking at new data.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.236
You know the reason why they wouldn't want this drug?

01:07:24.116 --> 01:07:25.997
Because they lose that remnant.

01:07:27.383 --> 01:07:32.044
because this allows women to abort a fetus at home and flush it down the toilet.

01:07:32.944 --> 01:07:33.925
Holy shit.

01:07:34.445 --> 01:07:40.846
That is absolutely terrible for their current model and needs.

01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:42.387
That is terrible.

01:07:42.407 --> 01:07:45.248
This drug is terrible.

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:51.009
It would be much better if you went somewhere where we could vacuum it into a sample bag and sell it.

01:07:54.275 --> 01:07:56.117
as it comes in, and I think we should.

01:07:56.157 --> 01:08:00.440
I mean, let's say there's a drug-drug interaction that pops up in big data analyses.

01:08:00.781 --> 01:08:02.862
That's something that we need to look at and pay attention to.

01:08:02.922 --> 01:08:06.025
Maybe it'll be a drug interaction that we can bring it off the market from.

01:08:06.185 --> 01:08:07.806
Perfect, perfect.

01:08:08.047 --> 01:08:11.850
Keep that abortion industry running smooth.

01:08:12.602 --> 01:08:13.542
The data guy, though?

01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:14.463
I'm a science guy.

01:08:14.483 --> 01:08:23.307
Will you hold up the dozens of studies over decades on the medication of abortion, methampristone, over new information that comes in now?

01:08:23.407 --> 01:08:24.888
We have to look at all data.

01:08:24.908 --> 01:08:26.469
You can't say there's... See that?

01:08:26.549 --> 01:08:27.569
That's crazy, right?

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:30.070
They're gonna make us fight for methampristone.

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:30.791
Like, really?

01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:32.051
It's gross.

01:08:32.251 --> 01:08:33.392
This is just gross.

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:48.695
There's a sacred cow thing that makes us be blind to certain data, and that's for the same reason we at the FDA are saying in the New England Journal of Medicine that we want to see a clinical trial to support the infinite booster strategy.

01:08:48.715 --> 01:08:58.177
So not an American journal, but a British journal is trying to tell Americans and their FDA how to do stuff.

01:08:58.217 --> 01:08:59.418
You see what's happening here?

01:08:59.438 --> 01:08:59.938
Do you see it?

01:09:00.018 --> 01:09:01.098
It's subtle, but it's there.

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:04.001
Because India is also the British crown.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.802
Canada's the British crown.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.084
Australia's the British crown.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:10.046
New Zealand's the British crown.

01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:18.813
Jill Glasspool Malone is the British crown.

01:09:20.855 --> 01:09:22.316
This guy is the British crown.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:26.199
I don't know.

01:09:26.219 --> 01:09:29.202
Strategy for young, healthy people.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.092
FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty McCary.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:33.013
Thank you for your time.

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:33.914
I appreciate you being here.

01:09:36.396 --> 01:09:40.799
I definitely think it's scripted bullshit, but interestingly enough, they do tell you the truth here.

01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:51.929
The groundwork for the FDA was created by a 1906 act and the amendment that was put forth by Kefauver and others in the 60s modernized it.

01:09:53.454 --> 01:09:54.997
right before Keef Offer was killed.

01:09:56.098 --> 01:09:57.740
You can see that there.

01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:01.986
They do show that interesting little history.

01:10:02.527 --> 01:10:04.349
Of course, this is all scripted bullshit.

01:10:04.369 --> 01:10:08.154
You've got to imagine a team of performers that were put out there with a script.

01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:10.255
And they didn't have to have the whole script.

01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:19.098
They could have just been told to stick to the VAERS reports or stick to myocarditis from the spike protein and then pivot to amyloidosis from the spike protein.

01:10:19.638 --> 01:10:25.180
Hell, just focus on the spike protein for five years seems to be what a lot of people were told to do.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.401
And while that happened, people were murdered in America.

01:10:30.478 --> 01:10:37.644
And then those numbers were thrown out to the rest of the world as evidence of the beginning of something very, very terrible.

01:10:38.324 --> 01:10:50.234
And at the same time, populations in the West that were even more out of balance in their population pyramids were much more rigorously managed.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:57.900
I think one of the nastiest examples of this is Scotland, where a tremendous number of old people were killed.

01:10:59.033 --> 01:11:03.016
a tremendous number of old white people were killed.

01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:07.798
And the evidence of that is now gone really.

01:11:07.919 --> 01:11:26.270
And if you look at this report from the McKinsey Global Institute, you might not even see how top heavy a lot of these pyramids were around 2018 and how predictable it would be that this all cause mortality rise was going to be a pretty big burden on hospitals and on budgets.

01:11:28.129 --> 01:11:35.756
Never mind the coming loss of children in schools and students in universities.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:43.023
A huge sector of the economy is about to change very drastically simply because of the loss of demographic.

01:11:44.656 --> 01:11:46.677
And they've seen this coming for a while.

01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:57.680
And now they proposing, you know, some solutions to this demographic reality, but this demographic reality was actually mitigated quite a lot by sculpting it using murder and lies.

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.102
This is not an insignificant number of people that they killed.

01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:07.244
They saved a lot of money here and they are still saving money because COVID still exists.

01:12:08.264 --> 01:12:14.206
And because people can be killed in the hospital because of that mythology.

01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:20.820
There are no financial incentives in place anymore to kill people as far as I know, but there used to be.

01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:28.349
There aren't as many PCR tests for that particular target as there used to be, but there still are PCR tests.

01:12:28.829 --> 01:12:32.394
Some PCR tests purport to test for like 17 different things at once.

01:12:34.514 --> 01:12:50.579
And none of those will be evaluated by an FDA with a UK citizen and an Indian citizen and an Indian citizen and Indians in the head of them that are all looking forward to, you know, revolutionizing the approval of cancer drugs, which is what Vinay and this guy have said repeatedly.

01:12:53.069 --> 01:13:03.820
This team of performers with elaborate costumes and fancy rumble scripts and fancy rumble studios provided to them in their garden are just an elaborate team of performers.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:15.232
And that script is largely provided by the Human Genome Project Research and Development Director Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone of DITRA and other organizations.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:25.602
Meryl Nass has probably been on Robert Malone's biological script for some time, maybe ever since her anthrax hearing where they first overlapped.

01:13:26.222 --> 01:13:29.903
You got to get off social media because that's where all these people have power.

01:13:29.943 --> 01:13:32.044
That's where they can enact their stunts.

01:13:32.624 --> 01:13:34.144
They can perform their shtick.

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:39.866
They can pretend that there's some agreement between Malone and McKernan and some argument between

01:13:40.606 --> 01:13:46.888
Crawford and rose and so you're watching real time the truth being sorted out and it's not true.

01:13:47.408 --> 01:13:56.970
It's not true Just like brian hooker saying, you know It is it is we're really in big trouble.

01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:03.332
We really are Um I guess that is gonna stop.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:06.392
Yeah We are really in big trouble.

01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:08.693
Um, and so we just got to keep working

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:13.367
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:14:15.168 --> 01:14:15.868
And I have lied.

01:14:15.888 --> 01:14:16.929
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:14:16.949 --> 01:14:17.869
I don't want to lie.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.731
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:20.851
I try not to be a liar.

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:21.732
I don't want to be a liar.

01:14:22.312 --> 01:14:25.014
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:32.431
really scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted.

01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:45.536
I just, it's just, it should be, it should be absolutely infuriating when you just see this one slide and realize that for 20 years, she's made no progress.

01:14:45.556 --> 01:14:47.117
20 years, she's made no progress.

01:14:47.157 --> 01:14:56.080
She spent more time and made more progress getting her daughter a modeling contract than she has in getting the word out about the dangers in the vaccine schedule.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:15:20.349
The myth of vaccines is something that she'll never say because she is part of this grift, a very integral part of this international grift that originated apparently in the UK with a guy by the name of Andrew Wakefield who they used to kind of help hijack this otherwise just, you know, innocent environmentalist who was just trying to save the water from burning.

01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:23.738
And I think that's bullshit.

01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:28.581
I think Tony Lyons and Steve Bannon and others whispered in his ear and said, we can make you president.

01:15:28.801 --> 01:15:30.362
And first, we'll make you vice president.

01:15:31.403 --> 01:15:35.045
Here's a friend of ours who's writing a biography.

01:15:35.545 --> 01:15:37.646
We're going to put a little epilogue in the back of that book.

01:15:37.686 --> 01:15:43.310
And we're going to seed the narrative right away in 2008 that you're going to run for president independently.

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:45.671
And then you're going to join one of the candidates and win.

01:15:47.307 --> 01:15:51.049
And then that's where we are right now, almost exactly where we are right now.

01:15:51.069 --> 01:16:08.298
But we needed a biological narrative because of course we're talking about a, a anticipated rise in all cause mortality and a transition from national sovereignty to some kind of international, you know, globalist, uh, I don't know what it is, technocracy.

01:16:08.738 --> 01:16:10.499
And these guys would love to be a part of it.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.441
I have no doubt in my mind that Kevin McKernan,

01:16:13.999 --> 01:16:17.787
and Robert Malone would love to be a part of any global technocracy.

01:16:18.612 --> 01:16:33.838
That's the reason why so early on in 2020, he was collaborating with such a diverse crowd as Mike Eden and Claire Craig and Thomas Binder and all these other people on the Corman-Jorston report.

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:42.122
It's too remarkable for words, other than to say it is an elaborate intelligence operation.

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:44.263
This is some kind of

01:16:45.592 --> 01:16:53.194
of privately organized or multinationally organized cabal of people that are trying to make social media relevant for governance.

01:16:53.995 --> 01:17:04.198
And the way they're making it relevant for governance is their performances on social media, what they say on social media, the scripts that they provide to people on social media, and their coordination of them.

01:17:05.899 --> 01:17:06.939
That's what's happening here.

01:17:07.559 --> 01:17:09.940
You see a bunch of actors with a provided script.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.201
Maybe the script at this point is being generated by an AI that's fed certain texts by these guys.

01:17:16.921 --> 01:17:26.424
Maybe the substacks of Robert Malone and Jessica Rose provide the bare necessities for an AI to give a script to a bunch of jokers.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:32.485
But you can see it if you look clearly at the history that I have always been honest about.

01:17:34.212 --> 01:17:37.355
And it really can see it when you look at Piper Stover and where she went.

01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:39.236
Disappeared.

01:17:40.977 --> 01:17:46.262
Even as soon as like a year ago, she still, you would have the guts every once in a while to say that, oh, I watched your stream.

01:17:47.843 --> 01:17:49.444
Sounds pretty good or something like that.

01:17:52.146 --> 01:17:57.771
This is an organization of liars of the highest malevolence.

01:17:59.005 --> 01:18:00.126
That's all I know for sure.

01:18:00.686 --> 01:18:02.687
I know that a lot of them have lied to me.

01:18:02.768 --> 01:18:10.293
I've been the focus of a lot of their attention, sometimes in groups at a time, over the course of the last six years.

01:18:11.593 --> 01:18:28.725
Some of the worst characters in this narrative, unfortunately, are Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, and Brett Weinstein, just for their level of fakery and their level of personal attacks or personal omission, essentially interfering with my family's ability to make a living.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.062
And so Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:32.122 --> 01:18:44.475
is the victim of The Ultimate Truman Show because he's had people like Meryl Nass and Mary Holland, absolute traitors to American children in his whispering for a decade already.

01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:48.440
He's a hopelessly lost person at this stage.

01:18:50.111 --> 01:18:53.132
It's unfortunate, but that's the conclusion I have to come to.

01:18:53.172 --> 01:19:02.955
That's the reason why they're bringing in all these new people on social media that we're supposed to pay attention to, like Jack Cruz or the Cali means and Casey means stuff.

01:19:03.455 --> 01:19:12.858
This is all desperate script reorganization, pulling people off of a bench that should have never existed in the first place to try and keep the last

01:19:13.758 --> 01:19:20.641
unwitting participants on on script, including Mary Talley Bowden, who was just on Joe Rogan.

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.526
Let's listen to some more.

01:19:31.866 --> 01:19:33.367
Oh, I got to probably fix this.

01:19:33.547 --> 01:19:34.787
Hold on one second.

01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:42.391
This is going to be interesting, I think.

01:19:43.001 --> 01:19:43.822
We're live.

01:19:43.882 --> 01:19:44.722
Hello, Facebook.

01:19:44.782 --> 01:19:46.183
It's your boy, Dr. Zubin Damania.

01:19:46.203 --> 01:19:48.304
Welcome to the ZDoggMD show.

01:19:49.065 --> 01:19:52.267
Dude, dude, you know who I have in the garage today?

01:19:52.427 --> 01:19:54.328
Such a Silicon Valley thing shooting out your garage.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:58.390
Dr. Peter Hotez is a like super duper professor at

01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:02.473
Baylor in Texas, and he is legendary.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:18.025
I'm gonna let him introduce himself, but he is legendary as a vaccine researcher, as a studier and fighter of tropical diseases, particularly in the developing world and in the world of people who live in poverty, which is still the vast majority of human beings.

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:25.470
He is also a hero of science communication and a hero to people who care about keeping our children safe and

01:20:26.351 --> 01:20:31.058
fairly reviled by anti-vax and the anti-vax cult around the world.

01:20:31.319 --> 01:20:32.741
Dr. Peter Hotez, welcome to the show.

01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:33.682
Thanks so much.

01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:35.104
No pressure with that introduction.

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:36.707
You know what, I set the- This is 2020.

01:20:38.988 --> 01:20:41.849
the bar low, and then you just traipse right over it.

01:20:42.249 --> 01:20:43.809
I like your style, brother.

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:46.090
Look at the outfit, man.

01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:55.433
Here I am in a Patagonia jacket, and you are bringing actual, you know, there's something about the way you project yourself that brings the science into it.

01:20:55.653 --> 01:20:57.994
Is this thoughtfully done by you, or something that you drifted into?

01:20:58.034 --> 01:21:03.195
Well, I can tell my medical students and residents you can either dress for the job you have, or you can dress like Peter Hotez.

01:21:05.976 --> 01:21:09.602
You know, the bow tie adds about 10 to 15 IQ points.

01:21:09.863 --> 01:21:11.626
So that's what my dad wears one.

01:21:11.646 --> 01:21:11.946
Yeah.

01:21:12.126 --> 01:21:12.387
Yeah.

01:21:12.627 --> 01:21:12.948
Sorry.

01:21:12.988 --> 01:21:13.389
December 2019.

01:21:13.429 --> 01:21:13.689
My bad.

01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.990
Thank you.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:17.934
When you wear that, people think you really know.

01:21:18.035 --> 01:21:20.175
And now look at me, I'm a dean.

01:21:20.235 --> 01:21:21.915
So there you go.

01:21:21.975 --> 01:21:23.936
So what is your background and title there?

01:21:23.956 --> 01:21:24.956
Just walk me through it real quick.

01:21:26.196 --> 01:21:27.817
Well, I grew up in Hartford, Connecticut.

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:33.318
And ever since I was a kid, I wanted to study tropical diseases.

01:21:33.378 --> 01:21:38.219
I was a nerdy kid who had a fascination with microbes after reading Microbe Hunters.

01:21:39.139 --> 01:21:42.321
I used to bring maps with me into the bathroom.

01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:44.403
I was obsessed with maps.

01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:47.885
So what happens when you get microbes and maps together?

01:21:47.925 --> 01:21:49.666
You get tropical diseases.

01:21:49.706 --> 01:21:53.969
So you're literally like Jack Black's character on Jumanji.

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.290
Oh, that one I don't know.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.991
Oh, now you have homework.

01:21:57.071 --> 01:21:58.913
Go watch Jumanji the remake.

01:21:59.033 --> 01:21:59.833
All right.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:04.697
But I went to Yale because they had a lab there that was working on sleeping sickness.

01:22:04.717 --> 01:22:05.797
And that's what I wanted to do.

01:22:06.918 --> 01:22:08.439
Then I did an M.D.

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:09.099
and Ph.D.

01:22:09.119 --> 01:22:15.142
at Rockefeller and Cornell because they were opening up this new science of molecular parasitology.

01:22:15.162 --> 01:22:19.664
It was the first time people were cloning genes from medically important parasites.

01:22:19.684 --> 01:22:20.244
When was this?

01:22:20.444 --> 01:22:27.987
This was the whole length of the 80s, 1980, 1987, just at the dawn of the molecular biology revolution.

01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:29.768
So I was one of the first

01:22:30.148 --> 01:22:32.633
Funny, that's the same timing as Robert Malone, huh?

01:22:32.653 --> 01:22:34.737
The dawn of the molecular biology revolution.

01:22:34.777 --> 01:22:41.630
I wonder if he also thought that maybe there would be a geneticist at every hospital curing childhood diseases with retroviruses.

01:22:46.334 --> 01:22:51.159
cloned a gene from hookworms and wanted to make a vaccine even as an MD-PhD student.

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.041
So I'm living out my boyhood fantasies.

01:22:53.141 --> 01:23:00.768
I'm doing exactly what I've always... It was his boyhood fantasy to make a vaccine for tropical diseases.

01:23:00.888 --> 01:23:08.736
He carried maps into the bathroom while he was a kid because he always knew he wanted to be a microbe hunter and microbe hunters need maps.

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:09.377
I get it.

01:23:10.279 --> 01:23:13.027
I'm probably one of the most goal-directed people you'll ever meet.

01:23:13.327 --> 01:23:17.919
One of the most goal-directed people you will ever meet.

01:23:21.693 --> 01:23:22.533
Holy shit.

01:23:23.113 --> 01:23:25.394
We used to, in medical school, we used to call people like you gunners.

01:23:25.774 --> 01:23:27.694
I don't know if they still use that, if they use that term at Baylor.

01:23:27.734 --> 01:23:28.254
It's a good term.

01:23:28.274 --> 01:23:36.535
I've never heard it, but it's, the only difference I think between then and now is the public engagement advocacy piece.

01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:43.397
I always knew I'd be an MD PhD laboratory investigator, having a lab, working on vaccines for tropical diseases.

01:23:43.557 --> 01:23:49.078
It's all the other stuff that, uh, I never would have anticipated doing.

01:23:49.118 --> 01:23:50.698
Never realized that I had a voice.

01:23:53.299 --> 01:24:00.121
to get people to care about people living in poverty with neglected tropical diseases, building up that whole ecosystem.

01:24:00.741 --> 01:24:08.703
Neglected tropical diseases will soon be abbreviated NTDs, just so you know, not to be confused with STDs.

01:24:08.903 --> 01:24:09.724
NTDs are

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.842
something tropical diseases.

01:24:13.922 --> 01:24:14.782
I can't even remember it.

01:24:15.442 --> 01:24:25.466
Or defending vaccines or getting people to care about the poor in the United States and working with elected leaders and high-profile people.

01:24:25.526 --> 01:24:30.688
That is something that I would not have predicted and is really something.

01:24:30.888 --> 01:24:33.529
I think they probably use poor people as test subjects.

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:34.990
I don't think they're just poisoning them.

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:36.250
I think they're testing on them.

01:24:36.411 --> 01:24:37.511
I think they test on them.

01:24:38.131 --> 01:24:40.332
I think that's unfolded maybe in the last two decades.

01:24:40.512 --> 01:24:49.417
In the last two decades, it's interesting to me how advocacy becomes a thing because there have been people on the show that are big advocates, they're also scientists, but it's a really unusual thing.

01:24:49.858 --> 01:24:55.521
Now, people like Einstein, you know, were big advocates, you know, say against nuclear war, things like that.

01:24:56.161 --> 01:25:02.248
about understanding the nature of our universe so we understand our place in it and this kind of humanity that met the science.

01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:10.037
And I think in advocacy where we've let down the public is that we put our smartest people back in the lab.

01:25:10.497 --> 01:25:11.218
We don't let them

01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:17.945
We don't let them use language that triggers emotions because we're not trained to do that as scientists.

01:25:18.025 --> 01:25:22.129
And then we wonder why celebrities and other people run with this stuff.

01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:25.331
Well, what happened was that the way this got started was a very interesting way.

01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:31.696
I moved from Yale to George Washington University in 2000 to chair the microbiology department.

01:25:31.716 --> 01:25:35.820
I was a young- Listen to this story and understand.

01:25:37.998 --> 01:25:56.852
Please listen to this story and understand and put it into the context of Mark Kulak's work on 9-11 and the possibility that, you know, how do you explain that the focus before 9-11 was exclusively bioterrorism and then 9-11 happened?

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:08.870
Was it because they decided that a bioterrorist attack for real wasn't doable, so they did a big explosion first and then did some envelopes?

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:10.571
I guess you could see it that way.

01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:28.119
But the point is very clear, I want to make, is that the anthrax attacks that occurred in America entangled people like Stephen Hatfield.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:34.327
who was the original suspect of the leak of the anthrax from U.S.

01:26:34.547 --> 01:26:51.592
Amarid, who was also on stage in Romania in November of 2023 with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, Brett Weinstein, Denny Rancor, Nick Hudson, Ryan Cole, the list goes on.

01:26:55.393 --> 01:26:57.914
And this guy, sitting at his desk,

01:26:59.071 --> 01:27:01.473
rose to prominence in this way.

01:27:03.035 --> 01:27:03.875
Listen carefully.

01:27:05.257 --> 01:27:07.859
Department chair, 40 years old.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:13.164
And so here I was in the microbiology department a few blocks from the White House, and then anthrax hit.

01:27:13.264 --> 01:27:14.605
There were the anthrax attacks.

01:27:14.665 --> 01:27:15.306
Oh, and that's a 2001.

01:27:15.386 --> 01:27:16.727
In Washington, New York.

01:27:16.987 --> 01:27:23.233
And what happened was the Centers for Disease Control had sort of gone into shutdown mode.

01:27:23.253 --> 01:27:25.274
They weren't really talking to journalists.

01:27:26.275 --> 01:27:29.437
And this was not far after 9-11, right?

01:27:29.517 --> 01:27:34.579
And so the major news outlets were going crazy wanting to talk to experts.

01:27:34.599 --> 01:27:35.480
So who do you talk to?

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.742
The guy who had the microbiology department next to the White House.

01:27:39.662 --> 01:27:41.243
And so the phone was ringing off the hook.

01:27:41.283 --> 01:27:42.864
Now, what did I know about anthrax, right?

01:27:42.904 --> 01:27:47.326
I mean, I knew as much about anthrax, never had seen a case of anthrax.

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:54.610
I knew as much about anthrax as anybody who had infectious disease training, you know, had to study it for a board exam or something like that.

01:27:55.058 --> 01:27:58.519
A board exam, an infectious disease training.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:27:59.780
Stop lying!

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.181
That's ridiculous.

01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:02.521
That's just stupid.

01:28:02.581 --> 01:28:04.042
That doesn't even make any sense.

01:28:04.182 --> 01:28:04.742
Come on.

01:28:05.562 --> 01:28:14.186
I literally had Mandel's infectious disease book open to the anthrax chapter and Stan Plotkin's vaccine book open to the anthrax chapter.

01:28:15.046 --> 01:28:19.408
And I was getting calls from, you know, Donald McNeil, the New York Times.

01:28:19.608 --> 01:28:21.809
He had two books open

01:28:22.679 --> 01:28:50.522
to the anthrax chapter okay let's see i'm going to check it right now so he says that he checked these two books were right down here underneath my desk underneath my drafting table he said

01:28:51.834 --> 01:28:53.234
I'm going to plug in my earphones again.

01:28:53.274 --> 01:28:54.095
Hold on one second.

01:28:57.676 --> 01:29:01.076
He said that he looked in Plotkin's Vaccines.

01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:04.797
He had that book open to the anthrax chapter.

01:29:04.837 --> 01:29:08.158
This is Plotkin's Vaccine book written also by Paul Offit.

01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:09.019
Look how thick it is.

01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:12.600
It's pretty, pretty complicated subject vaccines.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.200
You need a great big fricking book.

01:29:15.376 --> 01:29:21.940
Let's look up the anthrax in Stanley Plotkin's book, The Anthrax Vaccines.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:22.920
Oh, there they are.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:23.421
Page 11.

01:29:23.861 --> 01:29:24.861
1-11.

01:29:24.881 --> 01:29:25.422
Hmm.

01:29:28.383 --> 01:29:30.625
It's pretty far, not very far in the book.

01:29:31.385 --> 01:29:32.766
The anthrax vaccine.

01:29:32.866 --> 01:29:34.567
Okay, he had it open to that, huh?

01:29:35.707 --> 01:29:40.210
Pretty long, pretty long chapter here.

01:29:42.554 --> 01:29:44.795
Passive immunization, active immunization.

01:29:44.836 --> 01:29:45.816
Wow, crazy.

01:29:46.777 --> 01:29:47.057
Wow.

01:29:48.638 --> 01:29:49.178
It's nuts.

01:29:50.779 --> 01:29:52.881
That's a lot of, oh wow, look at all those references.

01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:54.102
So he had it open to that.

01:29:54.382 --> 01:29:55.963
I guess, I don't know what he would get out of this.

01:29:57.674 --> 01:30:01.196
Clinical description, you know, cutaneous inhalation.

01:30:01.237 --> 01:30:02.597
I guess he would have learned a lot of this.

01:30:03.178 --> 01:30:04.939
Gastrointestinal anthrax.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.541
Treatment and prevention with antibiotics.

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:10.543
History of vaccine development.

01:30:10.783 --> 01:30:12.644
That'll be really interesting to read that.

01:30:16.127 --> 01:30:17.488
There's some Russian stuff there.

01:30:18.547 --> 01:30:19.968
Okay, so he had it open to that.

01:30:20.008 --> 01:30:20.629
I'd give him that.

01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:22.991
Maybe he got something out of that.

01:30:23.031 --> 01:30:24.612
I don't think he could get very much out of that.

01:30:24.692 --> 01:30:26.734
The Infectious Disease by Mendel.

01:30:26.794 --> 01:30:27.494
That's this one.

01:30:28.555 --> 01:30:29.816
Sorry, I'm looking at the wrong camera.

01:30:30.657 --> 01:30:32.518
Let's see if I can find the anthrax in here.

01:30:32.538 --> 01:30:37.042
I don't know if this is an alphabetical thing or what.

01:30:38.543 --> 01:30:41.826
Section C. No, I don't think that's going to work.

01:30:42.126 --> 01:30:44.148
We're going to have to look up anthrax in the back.

01:30:47.398 --> 01:31:12.216
in the index anthraxythraxy hey there's a vaccination during pregnancy that's funny um anthrax boy i can barely see i got a new pair of glasses the other day they're my they're my whitney webb readers i like my whitney webb reading glasses let's see anthrax a n

01:31:13.533 --> 01:31:24.824
anthrax toxin anthrax vaccine anthrax 1885 to 1889 okay 18 i mean there's a lot of infection 1880 1880 what i can't do that very well

01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:35.592
1881 dang it.

01:31:36.132 --> 01:31:38.915
It's right here somewhere.

01:31:38.955 --> 01:31:49.564
There's pneumonia bacillus bacillus Anthrax, here we go It's basically the same titles.

01:31:49.604 --> 01:32:00.433
Look at that historical background epidemiology microbiology pathogenesis clinical manifestations cutaneous respiratory and gastrointestinal

01:32:02.129 --> 01:32:03.531
Control and Prevention.

01:32:03.971 --> 01:32:05.192
It's not a very long chapter.

01:32:05.232 --> 01:32:06.473
It's three pages long.

01:32:10.617 --> 01:32:19.646
If you want a pair of Whitney Readers, you got to go to Blenders, you know, where that's the glasses that Dion Sanders wears.

01:32:21.184 --> 01:32:23.125
Sorry that I defaulted to that, my bad.

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:25.245
Anyway, they were there.

01:32:27.106 --> 01:32:28.607
So he had it open to these two books.

01:32:28.647 --> 01:32:31.508
So these are the two books that he's talking about.

01:32:32.308 --> 01:32:34.989
That is Mendel's Infectious Disease.

01:32:35.029 --> 01:32:37.330
It's actually a two volume book, the one that I got.

01:32:38.659 --> 01:32:46.945
And this one, which is bigger than most Catholic Church Bibles, the Vaccines by Plotkin, which is a great book.

01:32:46.965 --> 01:32:52.648
I mean, I haven't read it all yet because it's really, you know, it's just invigorating.

01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:54.729
Can't take it all at once.

01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:59.913
So, let's see if we can get this back going here and see what we got going.

01:33:03.442 --> 01:33:06.804
Times and Steve Sternberg was USA Today and Maggie Fox at Reuters.

01:33:06.904 --> 01:33:20.972
And, you know, I was practically reading from the chapter pretending like I wasn't reading and they all thought it was the smartest thing that ever lived and, and wound up cultivating a whole group, group of journalists and found that I enjoyed it.

01:33:21.192 --> 01:33:26.535
I liked, I liked the intellectual interaction with especially science journalists.

01:33:26.575 --> 01:33:27.796
They're really smart people.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:28.156
Yeah.

01:33:28.416 --> 01:33:29.097
And they ask

01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:35.653
questions that I never would have asked myself, and they forced you to look up things.

01:33:36.053 --> 01:33:39.414
And I actually learned, I found it a great learning experience.

01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:40.974
So it was something I really enjoyed.

01:33:41.014 --> 01:33:47.656
And then what happened was, at that time, the Millennium Development Goals had been launched by the United Nations.

01:33:47.977 --> 01:33:49.257
And I was- What are those?

01:33:49.477 --> 01:33:56.630
And my wife is a long time, uh, you know, coauthor of a guy by the name of Jeffrey Sachs who works for the UN.

01:33:56.711 --> 01:33:59.436
So, you know, one in one makes two, right?

01:33:59.496 --> 01:34:02.080
I just started working for the UN then why not?

01:34:02.702 --> 01:34:21.256
Those are the set of shared goals for global poverty reduction at that time, how to address the plight of people who live in extreme poverty, what were then called the bottom billion, a billion people in the world that live below the World Bank poverty figure of what was then a dollar a day, and how to lift those people out of poverty.

01:34:21.276 --> 01:34:27.140
And there was a goal for infectious diseases called to combat AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.

01:34:27.921 --> 01:34:30.302
And then I realized everything I had done,

01:34:31.383 --> 01:34:33.204
What do you think that is behind him there?

01:34:33.884 --> 01:34:34.504
Can you see that?

01:34:34.584 --> 01:34:35.465
What do you think that is?

01:34:35.785 --> 01:34:36.485
What character?

01:34:37.626 --> 01:34:38.606
Put that in the chat.

01:34:38.726 --> 01:34:40.047
I want to know what you think that is.

01:34:40.087 --> 01:34:42.328
That's a coffee cup, but I don't know what that is.

01:34:42.368 --> 01:34:43.028
That's a dude.

01:34:43.888 --> 01:34:52.352
Looks like a dude in jeans with a belt on and then a white shirt with maybe a funny collar.

01:34:52.492 --> 01:34:53.572
I don't know what that is.

01:34:53.632 --> 01:34:54.613
That's weird to me.

01:34:54.853 --> 01:34:55.593
That's a funny one.

01:34:55.633 --> 01:34:56.493
I want to know what that is.

01:34:56.513 --> 01:34:58.114
It's probably a germ hunter.

01:34:58.733 --> 01:35:03.881
parasitic diseases and tropical diseases was now called other diseases.

01:35:04.742 --> 01:35:10.850
So you saw all of the excitement of Bono, you know, getting up there talking about HIV AIDS and a half scale Fauci.

01:35:13.885 --> 01:35:23.347
you had Angelina Jolie, and then if that time you got Angelina, you got... His muscles are too big, that's then, and his torso, legs are a little long for that to be a Fauci.

01:35:23.387 --> 01:35:25.628
Brad as well, so this is creating all this buzz.

01:35:26.188 --> 01:35:27.688
I miss Brangelina, I really do.

01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:36.230
Yeah, me too, and here I was stuck, you know, working on something called Other Disease, I was like, what the fuck is this?

01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:36.470
Also ran?

01:35:36.911 --> 01:35:38.491
What the fuck is this?

01:35:41.897 --> 01:35:50.821
In 2019, he's on a podcast with an Indian former doctor, now podcaster in the garage in California.

01:35:50.861 --> 01:35:52.121
He says Silicon Valley.

01:35:52.162 --> 01:35:53.982
I thought he was in Las Vegas, but whatever.

01:35:54.022 --> 01:35:55.823
He's got lots of places he shoots.

01:35:58.604 --> 01:35:59.885
Think about this carefully.

01:36:01.972 --> 01:36:12.524
Why would somebody who's trying to be a UN representative, a global leader in public health, use the word F word, the F word ever?

01:36:16.308 --> 01:36:16.688
Why?

01:36:16.928 --> 01:36:18.550
Why would you choose to do that?

01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:21.814
And now, unfortunately, they're going to do it several times in a row.

01:36:22.541 --> 01:36:23.882
I love doing other diseases.

01:36:23.922 --> 01:36:32.545
So I, we teamed up with two colleagues, David Molyneux at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Alan Fennec at Imperial College London.

01:36:32.585 --> 01:36:39.468
David Molyneux, it's an interesting name, because there's another Molyneux that was on the web doing stupid bullshit.

01:36:39.508 --> 01:36:40.548
I wonder if they're related.

01:36:42.324 --> 01:37:00.195
And we went about doing a branding exercise, just calling it neglected tropical diseases and looking at the opportunity of targeting them with a package of medicines that we could deliver potentially for 40 cents a person per year because the drug companies

01:37:00.635 --> 01:37:02.596
At that time we're donating a lot of medicines.

01:37:02.776 --> 01:37:23.783
Uh, they still are so it was so it took away the cost of the medicine So we wrote these back-to-back papers in plus in the public like back then it was plus medicine plus ntds wasn't created then Okay, you write the papers and then what right as an academic have a whole journal called plus ntds for neglected tropical diseases, I mean

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:26.230
It's so awful.

01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:27.651
It's just so awful.

01:37:27.731 --> 01:37:28.611
Why do you write the papers?

01:37:28.631 --> 01:37:31.313
You write the papers so you can advance your academic career.

01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:32.073
So you can get grants.

01:37:32.573 --> 01:37:33.514
And why do you write grants?

01:37:33.534 --> 01:37:34.935
So you can write more papers.

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:36.036
So you can write more grants.

01:37:36.856 --> 01:37:50.484
And so even if viruses don't exist or gain of function isn't real, if you can establish a mythology in the literature that it is real, then your career is going to be set and your justification for your work is done.

01:37:51.425 --> 01:37:53.526
And you can move lots of piles of money around.

01:37:55.977 --> 01:37:58.434
Governance by mythology, ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:10.556
We wanted to get this out there, and I was able to bring in back all of those journalists I talked to about the anthrax attacks, to get them to care about this.

01:38:11.397 --> 01:38:16.920
And before I knew it, I was taking a taxi down to the executive office building of the White House.

01:38:17.561 --> 01:38:21.023
This was the Bush administration at the time, and talking to- Bush one?

01:38:21.703 --> 01:38:25.885
Bush two, George W. Bush, and members of Congress.

01:38:27.166 --> 01:38:43.154
And I found again that I had a voice and which is really an important message is that as a physician or a physician scientist Don't underestimate your power If you're willing to take the time to step away from the grants and the papers And now of course, it's all the other garbage, right?

01:38:43.194 --> 01:38:50.438
There's the over credentialing and the terrible EHR and everything else if you're willing to take take the terrible EHR

01:38:52.563 --> 01:38:54.524
electronic health records.

01:38:54.564 --> 01:38:55.785
They're so annoying.

01:38:55.925 --> 01:38:57.666
Gosh, I wish we could fix those.

01:38:58.547 --> 01:39:02.109
Man, oh man, maybe there's an AI solution that the FDA could push.

01:39:03.015 --> 01:39:05.196
time to step away from that, you can move mountains.

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:15.203
And we were able to get 15, within a year of this, of those papers, we got $15 million appropriated through Congress.

01:39:16.303 --> 01:39:19.405
It may not sound like much, but that was enough to treat 30 million people.

01:39:19.645 --> 01:39:19.926
Wow.

01:39:20.026 --> 01:39:26.810
And now the World Health Organization- That was enough to make him dean.

01:39:28.985 --> 01:39:33.687
announced that more than 1 billion people have received this package of medicine.

01:39:33.707 --> 01:39:35.507
That's crazy.

01:39:36.087 --> 01:39:42.570
You know, it's funny because I was looking up Marty McCarty, and I couldn't believe what I found.

01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:51.373
Actually, just going to his Wikipedia, I noticed that Marty, not only is he from Liverpool, England,

01:39:52.753 --> 01:40:13.705
But if I look at this carefully, what I see is a dude who went through surgical oncology, that's cutting out cancers, and then decided to go into public health and actually worked for the World Health Organization to develop the official World Health Organization surgical checklist.

01:40:17.116 --> 01:40:28.242
So we have a former World Health employee at the head of the FDA who's also a UK citizen with allegiances outside of America.

01:40:28.342 --> 01:40:30.863
Think about that bullshit for a second.

01:40:31.944 --> 01:40:36.086
Think about that bullshit very carefully for a second, please.

01:40:36.106 --> 01:40:44.551
What's really interesting is I was just inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but not for my science.

01:40:45.769 --> 01:40:48.731
I got it in the public policy sector.

01:40:48.811 --> 01:40:58.436
And I was never trained in public policy, but again, it points to the fact that as a physician or physician scientist... Awards are given to people they want you to believe in.

01:41:00.518 --> 01:41:06.381
Like a Nobel Prize for Barack Obama or a Nobel Prize for Carrico and Weissman.

01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:25.444
You can be a subject matter expert and you can... I would go so far as to say that the last real Nobel Prize was awarded to Edward and Maybritt Moser and John O'Keefe for their discoveries in the hippocampus and interrhinal cortex.

01:41:25.484 --> 01:41:26.105
Prove me wrong.

01:41:27.352 --> 01:41:29.473
do things that nobody else can do.

01:41:29.513 --> 01:41:36.757
So it's an amazing story because I think many people feel pigeonholed if they do the MD-PhD route or they do the researcher route.

01:41:36.777 --> 01:41:41.680
They're like, well, I'm not really, I'm a couple of levels of abstraction away from actually helping people.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.840
It's gotta go through this and that.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:47.923
But through advocacy, through actually putting yourself out there, which I think is, this has been the struggle.

01:41:47.963 --> 01:41:52.286
So recently I've been talking a lot about, because doctors will ask me all the time, like, hey man, Z,

01:41:53.146 --> 01:41:54.507
How did you get out of the game, man?

01:41:54.527 --> 01:42:05.458
Because I don't see you with a finger in anyone's butt today and I'm still like clicking away at Epic and I'm still, you know, having to deal with Macra and MIPS and—and all these quality measures and I'm like, no, I did that too.

01:42:05.898 --> 01:42:07.420
I did that and it made me so mad.

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:12.505
I realized I wasn't able to—to actually prevent a single person from coming in the

01:42:12.605 --> 01:42:14.427
Oh man, you practically had me in tears.

01:42:14.847 --> 01:42:20.973
I looked at that, when you put out that, I think you called it Moral Injury YouTube video.

01:42:21.553 --> 01:42:24.196
I was like, oh my God, he's so right.

01:42:24.216 --> 01:42:25.917
You tapped into something.

01:42:26.698 --> 01:42:28.059
And you tapped into something

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.022
especially for young physicians.

01:42:31.102 --> 01:42:46.073
I mean, when I talk to young medical students, residents, as well as doctoral students for getting their PhD or MD-PhD, the commitment to public service and wanting to do good in the world is at an all-time high.

01:42:46.574 --> 01:42:49.136
I don't know, whatever they're saying about young people, it's bullshit.

01:42:49.176 --> 01:42:50.036
It's bullshit.

01:42:50.076 --> 01:42:52.598
These guys are as idealistic as you've ever seen.

01:42:52.658 --> 01:42:56.901
They want to do good, but it's my generation of

01:42:57.702 --> 01:43:00.124
physicians and scientists and academics.

01:43:00.464 --> 01:43:05.187
We've done everything we can to squash the young generation.

01:43:05.908 --> 01:43:09.950
And we've not created an ecosystem for them to allow that to flourish.

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:14.053
And so- Is this intentional or is this a product of our own hierarchy and our own conditioning?

01:43:14.073 --> 01:43:15.194
I think it's complacency.

01:43:15.214 --> 01:43:16.495
A lot of it's laziness.

01:43:16.575 --> 01:43:22.318
We've allowed so many other forces to gain a hold.

01:43:22.379 --> 01:43:26.061
I mean, the medical profession is over-credentialed.

01:43:26.141 --> 01:43:27.262
It's too obsessed with

01:43:28.122 --> 01:43:33.865
board certified this and that, these horrible standardized tests at USMLE.

01:43:33.925 --> 01:43:39.748
You know, when I was a medical student, I had to take the USMLE, but you had to pass it.

01:43:40.008 --> 01:43:42.849
I don't know if I got a score.

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:44.650
So did I study for it?

01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:49.493
So I remember that I did really badly in renal physiology.

01:43:50.553 --> 01:43:58.235
Uh in my first two years of medical school, so I made sure I studied renal physiology And I still did the worst that was still my worst score anyway, too But the point is, you know, what did I do?

01:43:58.275 --> 01:44:01.957
I took a week a week off for a few days off to look at renal physiology.

01:44:01.997 --> 01:44:07.378
That was it now You know what we see medical students doing is is awful.

01:44:07.398 --> 01:44:18.882
They're spending months studying for this Stupid fucking exam when they should be, you know in the lab when they should be doing creative stupid fucking exam How how is it possible?

01:44:19.702 --> 01:44:38.131
there's no way this is a a military operation of some sort put together by some paramilitary like you know weaponized pile of money putting shitheads out there this guy there's no way you're swearing like this and trying to save anybody

01:44:38.464 --> 01:44:59.407
Endeavors when they should be making discoveries and we're burying them with tests and credentialing and all the other stuff that you talk about So so, okay everything you just said brings to mind an email I just got from a third-year medical student who's about take some step examine and it's just like oh they just computerized the scoring of it so now a computer is gonna score us and the

01:44:59.867 --> 01:45:04.870
Well, you know, we started branding them as NTDs, and now everyone gets it, so I'm afraid to mess with it.

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:06.731
Yeah, it's like when they change it to STI.

01:45:06.871 --> 01:45:08.933
I'm like, no, these are sexually transmitted diseases.

01:45:09.033 --> 01:45:12.655
Let's just keep it as NTDs, and that's like a thing now.

01:45:13.335 --> 01:45:16.517
So, you know, it's amazing how widespread they are.

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:20.619
And getting people to care has been tough.

01:45:20.639 --> 01:45:27.042
So now with Senator Booker on board and the House and Chris Smith, maybe we'll get some traction.

01:45:27.062 --> 01:45:32.864
But the vaccine issue, the vaccine advocacy issue, that was something I never intended to do.

01:45:32.944 --> 01:45:35.986
Again, the history of my advocacy is

01:45:37.446 --> 01:45:38.787
I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

01:45:38.827 --> 01:45:45.330
I love being a physician, pediatrician, scientist, working in Texas Children's Hospital in Baylor, great bosses.

01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:46.911
I couldn't be happier.

01:45:47.231 --> 01:45:50.733
But then you see a vacuum and somebody has to say something.

01:45:50.793 --> 01:45:54.495
So NTDs, poverty related disease among the poor in the US.

01:45:55.095 --> 01:46:00.678
In Texas, after I moved to Texas in 2011 to set up the school and the vaccine center,

01:46:01.798 --> 01:46:06.980
we saw 60,000 kids in Texas being denied access to vaccinations.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.322
And those are the ones we know about, because we have 325,000 homeschooled kids in Texas.

01:46:12.523 --> 01:46:14.143
We have no idea how many of those are.

01:46:14.563 --> 01:46:17.445
So we probably have over 100,000 kids not getting vaccinated.

01:46:17.765 --> 01:46:21.046
And it turned out, why weren't they getting vaccinated?

01:46:21.446 --> 01:46:24.968
Because a political action committee, a PAC,

01:46:25.988 --> 01:46:33.333
came in to Texas, aligned themselves with the far right wing of the Republican Party, the Tea Party.

01:46:33.493 --> 01:46:41.318
And then, not that I have a problem with the far right wing of the Republican Party, because one of the things the anti-vaccine movement does is they shift their language depending on the state.

01:46:41.338 --> 01:46:42.198
Depending on the state, right.

01:46:42.258 --> 01:46:43.019
Their opportunists.

01:46:43.039 --> 01:46:48.923
So in the case of Texas, they used this language that would appeal to the libertarian streak of the Republican Party.

01:46:48.943 --> 01:46:49.223
Of course, yeah.

01:46:49.523 --> 01:46:54.147
And they started making up these terms like health freedom, medical freedoms, bullshit, right?

01:46:54.207 --> 01:46:59.091
Basically they're denying kids the right to protection against serious to deadly infections.

01:46:59.531 --> 01:47:00.953
And so it's, he's right.

01:47:01.013 --> 01:47:15.685
It is bullshit, but not the way that he is characterizing it as bullshit because it's not a useful opposition to the biological conundrum that is intramuscular injection as a great way to administer medicine.

01:47:17.705 --> 01:47:27.145
but instead putting up this ridiculous hamster wheel that Paul Offit and Mary Holland established in 2015 with their clash on Democracy Now!

01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:34.471
They appeal to the left, by the way, through this like mystical sanctity, purity, organic, pure toxins.

01:47:34.491 --> 01:47:36.912
So they speak the language of the extreme very well.

01:47:36.952 --> 01:47:42.794
I like to say it's the one thing that's going to unite the country, the far left and the far right is the anti-vaccine movement.

01:47:43.454 --> 01:47:55.397
That's not dissimilar to what I think Steve Bannon saw all along, that they saw and tested all along in the UK when they put Pauly Tommy on 90 billboards to shift six million votes.

01:47:56.604 --> 01:48:09.307
It is a way to unite some far left and some right people on some kind of pseudo conservative basis and get them to vote for somebody or cheer somebody on, you know, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:48:10.968 --> 01:48:14.629
And now an elaborate bait and switch has happened where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:48:14.689 --> 01:48:19.930
is just a mindless, meaningless puppet.

01:48:21.089 --> 01:48:24.910
just put in place wherever he needs to be so that people clap and cry.

01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:40.134
And, and Marty McCarty does all the Sunday shows and, and, and seeds all the, the scripted narratives of the, of the Casey means and Callie means, and all these other nutritional people who have no concept of how badly they're being used.

01:48:40.254 --> 01:48:42.195
It's all one malevolent show.

01:48:44.395 --> 01:48:46.176
Scrambling for people to get out.

01:48:46.196 --> 01:48:51.680
I mean, you know to take part, uh, I walked in So what the hell's going on here?

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.743
And uh, and then once again, so we could watch more of that, but I don't really have time It's a scree.

01:48:56.843 --> 01:49:00.526
It's a team of performers I know all of these people.

01:49:00.706 --> 01:49:03.868
I know all of them are on a script for bullshit.

01:49:03.888 --> 01:49:04.949
The question is for what?

01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:27.365
If you want to understand why, you need to understand what Brian Hooker, a 16-year government employee that was genetically modifying plants to make medicines before his child was inflicted with autism, what he doesn't call autism in 2013, doesn't like that word, because his son was neurologically damaged by an injection or a series of them.

01:49:28.325 --> 01:49:28.946
And he's pissed.

01:49:30.029 --> 01:49:37.455
But then somewhere in 2015 or 16, he decided to use the word autism, maybe because Meryl Nass and Mary Holland convinced him to.

01:49:38.056 --> 01:49:40.838
Mary Holland was on Democracy Now!

01:49:40.938 --> 01:49:55.250
in 2015 opposite Paul Offit arguing about MMR restarting the narrative that was already enacted by Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy in the UK at least five or eight years before this.

01:49:56.171 --> 01:49:56.992
Understand that.

01:49:57.987 --> 01:50:03.474
It's a hamster wheel because the same parts of the narrative keep coming back in front of you again.

01:50:03.935 --> 01:50:08.641
That's why Andrew Wakefield keeps coming down and will probably soon be on the Joe Rogan Show.

01:50:10.543 --> 01:50:14.148
2016 is when ICANN was established on April Fool's Day.

01:50:15.185 --> 01:50:23.908
and also when Vaxxed One was released, the first movie produced by Polly, Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield, a movie produced by them.

01:50:24.248 --> 01:50:26.189
That's why they have ranches in Texas.

01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:38.193
2018 is when Bobby Kennedy reluctantly changed the World Mercury Project to Children's Health Defense with Mary Holland and Meryl Nass behind him, not recruiting

01:50:39.187 --> 01:50:46.008
Of course, Brandy Vaughn, because Brandy Vaughn and Learn the Risk were already aware that these people were liars, that Larry Cook was a liar.

01:50:46.808 --> 01:51:07.872
And in 2018 is when Larry Cook and StopMandatoryVaccinations.com, or whatever the hell his shitty website is, decided to pull a fake stunt with Paul Offit and ZDogg, where they actually promoted not Brandy's website, but this StopMandatoryVaccinations website of,

01:51:08.752 --> 01:51:17.980
Larry Cook, an associate of these assholes, and probably somebody who facilitated the murder of Brandy Vaughn.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:29.171
2019, you have to realize that in 2019, we had James Lyons Weiler touring the United States, telling everybody that vaccine preventable diseases are circulating asymptomatically in the background.

01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:35.076
And that's why there's a constant danger for genetically vulnerable or immunocompromised people.

01:51:37.807 --> 01:51:42.409
You have to understand that in 2019, Brandy Vaughn was still alive.

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:46.331
That Tony Bark was still alive.

01:51:46.351 --> 01:51:47.932
And then they just started dropping off.

01:51:47.972 --> 01:51:51.174
And by December of 2020, Brandy Vaughn was dead.

01:51:51.574 --> 01:51:52.614
Tony Bark was dead.

01:51:53.855 --> 01:52:06.321
And former government employee, Brian Hooker, is on live streams telling everybody that COVID is asymptomatic, that you can look for antibodies, and that we need to test the vaccines more.

01:52:09.312 --> 01:52:12.153
And then five years later, we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:52:12.473 --> 01:52:21.017
in the White House, and PCR is a universal diagnostic tool for everything from viruses to measles to some genetic diseases.

01:52:21.698 --> 01:52:30.522
Sequencing is a high-fidelity measurement of these signals in the wild, including coronavirus, and there's a new variant coming because we're monitoring that sequence all the time.

01:52:31.835 --> 01:52:39.963
Endemicity is a process and also an end state that you have to accept, even though there's no biological evidence for that process or that end state.

01:52:40.544 --> 01:52:44.467
It is part of the mythology of RNA being able to do something that it can't.

01:52:45.228 --> 01:52:54.217
And finally, gain-of-function has many forms, from serial passage to direct construction, and you have to accept all of these things under their rubric of pandemics and

01:52:54.777 --> 01:52:57.459
Bad Biology 101, Evolution Because DNA.

01:52:57.879 --> 01:53:03.303
Very similar to how you accept that intramuscular injection is like the best invention ever.

01:53:04.143 --> 01:53:08.386
That you accept pandemics are real and that we can also make them, sometimes in a garage.

01:53:09.146 --> 01:53:14.770
You are a human, not a person with a select amount of time to contribute to future generations.

01:53:16.471 --> 01:53:19.433
You are a human experimental subject.

01:53:20.492 --> 01:53:25.294
And finally, we all descend from the same puddle, so stop pretending you're so special.

01:53:26.554 --> 01:53:34.057
That's the message of the pandemic, I think, and that's what we have to stop them from teaching our kids, and we have to stop teaching it to our kids ourselves.

01:53:34.437 --> 01:53:37.558
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, strange trip.

01:53:37.678 --> 01:53:39.019
I don't know how to characterize it.

01:53:39.759 --> 01:53:40.380
any other way.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.101
A long, long, strange trip.

01:53:42.702 --> 01:53:43.542
Thanks for being here.

01:53:44.343 --> 01:53:47.966
We are going to work very hard on Bad Biology 101, but not today.

01:53:48.006 --> 01:53:51.469
I'm going to do a little music break and then we're going to go back to Peter Hotez again.

01:53:51.909 --> 01:53:52.589
Thanks for being here.

01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.530
Wow!

01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:56.871
The winner is Eric Johnson.

01:57:56.971 --> 01:57:57.951
Eric Johnson.

01:57:57.971 --> 01:58:00.132
Ah, via Musicom.

01:58:01.072 --> 01:58:04.233
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:58:04.713 --> 01:58:06.533
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:08.894
Isolation?

01:58:08.934 --> 01:58:09.254
What was that?

01:58:09.394 --> 01:58:10.654
Isolation and purification.

01:58:12.375 --> 01:58:13.075
Of the virus?

01:58:13.195 --> 01:58:13.395
Yes.

01:58:14.635 --> 01:58:16.956
Well, you isolate a virus by, um,

01:58:23.211 --> 01:58:25.692
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:58:26.333 --> 01:58:31.216
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:58:31.777 --> 01:58:34.338
I don't understand what the issue is.

01:58:34.539 --> 01:58:41.824
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

01:58:41.844 --> 01:58:43.565
Okay.

01:58:43.705 --> 01:58:46.367
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

01:58:48.882 --> 01:58:50.845
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:58:50.925 --> 01:58:56.955
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:58:57.035 --> 01:58:59.058
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

01:59:05.484 --> 01:59:06.024
Good morning.

01:59:06.104 --> 01:59:06.885
Hello, everybody.

01:59:06.925 --> 01:59:07.525
Good afternoon.

01:59:07.545 --> 01:59:08.186
Welcome to the show.

01:59:08.206 --> 01:59:10.087
This is Gigaohm Biological on the back end.

01:59:10.567 --> 01:59:12.148
This is the second half of the show.

01:59:13.429 --> 01:59:19.693
It is still the Gigaohm Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by those people scrolling on the left there.

01:59:20.533 --> 01:59:23.976
You can find this work at stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:59:24.096 --> 01:59:27.358
Also, some more links at gigaohmbiological.com.

01:59:28.379 --> 01:59:34.568
That's also a way to get informed there by giving that email To my wife so she can let you know that I'm doing a stream.

01:59:34.608 --> 01:59:35.009
Basically.

01:59:35.049 --> 01:59:43.382
I'm doing a stream every day Five days a week at about 11 o'clock 10 o'clock is generally my target, but I don't always make it and then I I

01:59:43.925 --> 01:59:46.986
delay it until 11 and then by the time I've delayed it I'm late.

01:59:47.927 --> 02:00:01.352
That's my only explanation for what's going on here other than the fact that there's a Trojan horse in the American government that is intellectually fueled on mostly by social media theater.

02:00:02.319 --> 02:00:11.624
And that social media theater, the biological portion of it is scripted by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone with lots and lots of players witting and unwittingly participating.

02:00:12.504 --> 02:00:18.187
Steve Bannon is in the background whose name is again spelled N because I guess I put the wrong slide there.

02:00:19.407 --> 02:00:22.209
And yeah, let's get those guys back in again.

02:00:22.269 --> 02:00:22.789
Does that work?

02:00:22.909 --> 02:00:23.089
No.

02:00:23.509 --> 02:00:24.950
Jiminy Christmas, come on.

02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:26.891
Get those guys back in there.

02:00:27.324 --> 02:00:40.117
And Brent Weinstein, of course, is really interesting to understand as a phenomenon that I think probably wasn't supposed to play as much of a role as he's being allowed to play now, simply because, as I explained earlier, he's useful on both sides.

02:00:40.157 --> 02:00:46.724
He's useful if you find him annoying and can make fun of him, and he's useful if you find him insightful or soothing.

02:00:49.617 --> 02:01:07.322
So I think the best example that I have from my personal experience to show you how awful this is, is number one, Andrew Kaufman, who had a contract with the state of New York to make biometric monitoring devices for the prisons before the pandemic.

02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:33.116
And Tom Cowan, who had a kind of skeptical book in 2018, you know, I like a lot of these people, who doesn't seem to have progressed in his messaging very well, other than just saying that these people don't know what they're talking about because I'm such a down-home kind of guy that I just like to stand around and talk like an American.

02:01:33.576 --> 02:01:34.477
He's a real fake.

02:01:35.578 --> 02:01:47.691
And then you have a Canadian like Christine Massey, who spent an inordinate amount of time trying to contact me via email and convince me that her FOIA requests were more important than my biology or something, something.

02:01:47.771 --> 02:01:51.916
And especially while I was working at CHD, which is kind of comical.

02:01:53.188 --> 02:02:08.672
Remember that Andrew Kaufman was on a stream in 2021 where they showed him some video of Ryan Cole and Robert Malone, and he wouldn't want to disparage anybody in the field, but he disagrees with some of their biology.

02:02:10.132 --> 02:02:19.194
And so what we have here is a scripted narrative and people performing different parts of it with the express purpose

02:02:20.848 --> 02:02:25.132
of militarizing social media against you.

02:02:25.453 --> 02:02:30.878
Militarizing social media against you cannot be done with programming and bots.

02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:39.106
Militarizing social media cannot be done to you by algorithms and bots.

02:02:39.446 --> 02:02:40.407
Understand that.

02:02:40.908 --> 02:02:41.628
The only

02:02:42.578 --> 02:02:52.822
Real militarization of social media is the purposeful placement of fake people on it and their scripting.

02:02:54.822 --> 02:03:04.506
You can't take a bunch of real people trying to be themselves and say the truth and then take an algorithm and shake it up so that the truth can't be figured out.

02:03:05.458 --> 02:03:08.399
That's a bullshit, ridiculous idea.

02:03:08.719 --> 02:03:19.922
And you also can't just, you know, pull a few people off the internet or censor a couple people to demonetize a couple of Brent Weinsteins and then keep the truth from getting out.

02:03:19.982 --> 02:03:21.762
That's not how the internet works.

02:03:21.962 --> 02:03:29.564
Instead, the internet works by populating your feed with fake people on fake scripts.

02:03:32.546 --> 02:03:45.819
That's what Kevin McCarren is, that's what Andrew Kaufman is, that's what the Bailey's are, that's what Christine Massey is, that's what Tom Cowan is, that's what Mary Holland is, that's what Meryl Nass is, that's what Brian Hooker has chosen to become.

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.764
What Pauly Tommy has always been, what Andrew Wakefield is.

02:03:52.537 --> 02:03:58.625
These are people who have helped to weaponize the internet against populations of Earth.

02:03:59.907 --> 02:04:02.310
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

02:04:02.971 --> 02:04:07.076
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

02:04:09.671 --> 02:04:10.131
actually J.J.

02:04:10.191 --> 02:04:16.835
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:04:17.075 --> 02:04:30.561
And of course, this is particularly damning for the Weinsteins because they knew this in a Signal chat in 2021 that also included Chris Martinson of IMA-FLCCC board fame.

02:04:31.862 --> 02:04:32.122
Yeah.

02:04:32.522 --> 02:04:38.025
Also included Alexandros Marinos, the possible gay lover of Elon Musk.

02:04:40.225 --> 02:04:54.956
Matt Crawford, who's supposedly a victim of a military rape camp when he was a kid and now permanently traumatized and used to oversee a billion dollars in day trading and has made a fortune in retiring because of Bitcoin, I guess.

02:04:57.378 --> 02:05:06.465
Heather Haying, Jumi Kim, somebody who used to do, I guess, genetic modification of algae to make fuels or something like that, I don't know.

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:10.914
That thing that the guy from the Human Genome Project's all fired up about?

02:05:11.955 --> 02:05:13.695
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

02:05:14.115 --> 02:05:16.336
That was in 2021.

02:05:18.437 --> 02:05:25.299
And then in 2022, they started talking about me on their podcast and teasing me with the possibility that I might get on.

02:05:26.479 --> 02:05:32.181
But every time Brett went in my name, he said, I think I thought of this myself, but I also heard it from Peter McCullough and Jay Cooey.

02:05:35.146 --> 02:05:49.770
they knew it all and most importantly they knew that transfection was the right word but it took him until 2024 to say that on twitter and then when he said it he still kind of said it in a pretty shitty snarky way in 2022 what did heather say?

02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:51.991
transfections rather than vaccines

02:05:52.791 --> 02:06:16.746
actually j.j cooey's insistence and i think he's right on calling them transfections rather than the vaccine so not dr jonathan cooey of pittsburgh pennsylvania not dr jonathan cooey formerly of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine j.j cooey i have a phd like they do but i'm j.j cooey

02:06:18.214 --> 02:06:21.558
Not Jonathan J. Cooey, PhD from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:06:21.598 --> 02:06:27.285
He used to work at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, is currently a consultant for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:27.345 --> 02:06:28.787
No, no, no, no, no.

02:06:29.768 --> 02:06:29.968
J.J.

02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.309
Cooey.

02:06:36.997 --> 02:06:40.600
You have now a rough relationship with Joe Rogan.

02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:42.662
It started off positive.

02:06:42.822 --> 02:06:43.262
How are you, sir?

02:06:43.562 --> 02:06:44.003
How are you?

02:06:44.023 --> 02:06:44.743
Good to see you again.

02:06:44.944 --> 02:06:45.804
I'm thrilled to be here.

02:06:45.864 --> 02:06:50.808
He was inviting you on as an expert to talk about what's going on in the early days of the pandemic.

02:06:50.848 --> 02:06:51.869
How did that change?

02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:57.474
I criticize him when he puts out vaccine disinformation and ask him not to do that.

02:06:57.594 --> 02:07:00.956
If you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?

02:07:01.036 --> 02:07:01.716
I go, no.

02:07:01.916 --> 02:07:02.556
I was writing to him.

02:07:02.596 --> 02:07:05.598
I said, Joe, have me on because what you're doing is dangerous.

02:07:05.658 --> 02:07:09.039
People are now making decisions based on what they're hearing.

02:07:09.059 --> 02:07:13.281
Now this is Peter Hotez five years after, almost six years after now.

02:07:13.361 --> 02:07:16.563
It's six years after that 2019 video that we started with.

02:07:16.623 --> 02:07:21.925
So we're going to hear his shtick from a much more confident and certain perspective.

02:07:21.985 --> 02:07:25.547
Maybe even a potential, you know, government official at some point.

02:07:25.647 --> 02:07:26.267
He knows that.

02:07:26.827 --> 02:07:28.828
How did he respond to your messages?

02:07:28.848 --> 02:07:29.608
There was no response.

02:07:30.928 --> 02:07:37.331
I didn't hear from him in two years until he taunted me to debate RFK Jr.

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:42.612
There were a few reasons why I wasn't going to debate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:07:42.632 --> 02:07:47.274
I didn't want to send the message that science is done by a debate with crackpots.

02:07:48.214 --> 02:07:53.096
And whoever says more clever things in a debate, that's how science gets done.

02:07:53.216 --> 02:07:54.937
That's not how a science debate works.

02:07:54.977 --> 02:07:56.177
This is bullshit already.

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.301
that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:00.321 --> 02:08:03.101
would just say zingers and that's why he couldn't win.

02:08:03.601 --> 02:08:13.424
They couldn't discuss paper by paper and figure by figure or reference by reference or statistic by statistic.

02:08:13.984 --> 02:08:17.025
Nah, that's not how science is done.

02:08:17.065 --> 02:08:18.245
We don't teach people.

02:08:18.705 --> 02:08:21.466
Students aren't allowed to ask questions in my class.

02:08:22.066 --> 02:08:22.786
Come on now.

02:08:23.948 --> 02:08:25.789
I thought that would be very dangerous.

02:08:25.889 --> 02:08:27.550
You faced a lot of abuse during that time.

02:08:27.590 --> 02:08:29.871
Harassment, anger, vitriol.

02:08:30.251 --> 02:08:34.353
He offered a million dollars for him to debate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:34.413 --> 02:08:36.534
on a podcast and he didn't reply.

02:08:36.554 --> 02:08:39.256
Yeah, he got a lot of shit for that.

02:08:39.596 --> 02:08:40.856
The general public, what was that like?

02:08:40.976 --> 02:08:46.139
I got stalked at my home by an anti-vaxxer, a couple of anti-vaxxers.

02:08:46.239 --> 02:08:47.580
It was very dark.

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.881
It was probably Larry Cook came over for dinner.

02:08:51.836 --> 02:08:52.536
very quickly.

02:08:52.716 --> 02:08:58.020
Today, I sit down with Dr. Peter Hotez, pediatrician scientist, co-inventor of a $3.

02:08:58.661 --> 02:09:10.729
And yes, this guy has gotten fat in the last five years as he's risen in his fame and fortune on the internet after interviewing Fauci several times about adding the COVID vaccine to the schedule.

02:09:10.769 --> 02:09:15.553
And after shilling for these people for so many years, yeah, he's eaten well.

02:09:17.677 --> 02:09:22.420
patent-free COVID vaccine, and the researcher anti-vaxxers love to target.

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:31.445
In this episode, we peel back the curtain on how he was able to create a low-cost vaccine with the help of Tito's vodka, and without the help of Big Pharma.

02:09:31.525 --> 02:09:37.429
We get into the details between a public clash with Joe Rogan, and what really happened when RFK Jr.

02:09:37.509 --> 02:09:41.331
tried to lure Hotez into a debate page match with Elon Musk.

02:09:42.252 --> 02:09:43.332
And then I'll start it again.

02:09:43.672 --> 02:09:44.253
Sorry about that.

02:09:46.943 --> 02:09:48.244
Just have to advance it a little bit.

02:09:48.284 --> 02:09:51.907
You have now a rough relationship with Joe Rogan.

02:09:52.508 --> 02:09:53.289
Time to look it up.

02:09:53.329 --> 02:09:56.111
So it's it's become sophisticated also.

02:09:56.191 --> 02:10:02.337
I mean, not really, but but it requires people with more technical knowledge than the past.

02:10:02.897 --> 02:10:04.899
to debunk it, you know, so for instance.

02:10:26.477 --> 02:10:27.437
I'm excited to speak.

02:10:28.418 --> 02:10:33.640
I've seen your work throughout all of social media, all the major cable stations.

02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:41.182
You've been a prominent voice in debunking a lot of misinformation, both online, offline, and on television.

02:10:42.143 --> 02:10:48.925
What are some of the lessons you've learned over these last few years as to how complicated it is to battle misinformation?

02:10:49.229 --> 02:10:54.993
Well, it's, you know, Mike, it's gotten more complicated because the anti-vaccine movement has grown in sophistication.

02:10:55.033 --> 02:10:59.937
They've grown in political power and in money and infrastructure.

02:11:00.817 --> 02:11:05.941
And, and I mean, Children's Health Defense had like 70 employees when I worked there.

02:11:05.981 --> 02:11:07.162
So yes, it's true.

02:11:07.942 --> 02:11:09.904
And they're doing million dollar matches.

02:11:10.344 --> 02:11:11.585
And it's true.

02:11:11.625 --> 02:11:16.048
They have react and react 19 and they have door to freedom.

02:11:16.228 --> 02:11:17.109
Yes, it's true.

02:11:18.567 --> 02:11:22.149
bigger, bigger infrastructures to make movies and thumbnails.

02:11:22.269 --> 02:11:22.749
It's gross.

02:11:22.769 --> 02:11:28.671
Kinds of pieces of disinformation that they're putting out have become more sophisticated also.

02:11:28.771 --> 02:11:39.156
I mean, not really, but it requires people with more technical knowledge than the- I remember the photographs of his birthday party on the boat with a bunch of girls in swimsuits.

02:11:39.196 --> 02:11:39.976
That was awesome.

02:11:41.267 --> 02:11:42.708
asked to debunk it.

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:52.254
You know, so for instance, you know, saying Bill Gates is sticking microchips into your vaccine that, you know, most general physicians could debunk that.

02:11:52.314 --> 02:11:58.398
But, you know, in the Florida Surgeon General, Latipo says mRNA vaccine... I'm not bragging, okay?

02:11:58.638 --> 02:11:59.599
I'm kind of bragging.

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.463
There's like a minimum amount of personal hygiene that somebody has to do in order to not have teeth like that.

02:12:06.809 --> 02:12:17.099
And that minimum personal hygiene, if you're not willing to do it for yourself, what does that mean for you as a doctor or a professional or a worldwide advocate for neglected tropical diseases?

02:12:17.219 --> 02:12:26.649
In my mind, it labels you as a fraud the same way it does if you go on a podcast with Zubaz and you start saying the F word all the time.

02:12:28.618 --> 02:12:37.666
It's exactly what Kevin McCairn did for five years while he kept GigaOM Biological on his McCairn Dojo website as the biology.

02:12:38.747 --> 02:12:47.074
And then went on stream after stream to talk about the Jews who had nigger slaves that worked for the kikes and the spooks and the whatevers.

02:12:48.876 --> 02:12:52.999
Because his goal at that stage was to associate himself with me

02:12:53.962 --> 02:12:57.445
so that I would be discredited through my association with him.

02:12:57.485 --> 02:13:02.388
And then when that didn't work, he went to attacking me to try and wave to get my attention.

02:13:03.349 --> 02:13:05.230
They brought Rixey into this shit.

02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:07.712
They brought McKernan into this stuff.

02:13:08.312 --> 02:13:11.775
They brought me, they brought me to write in this book for shit sake.

02:13:12.235 --> 02:13:14.296
And then they brought Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:14.356 --> 02:13:14.697
into it.

02:13:14.737 --> 02:13:16.638
And then he couldn't sustain it anymore.

02:13:18.379 --> 02:13:19.160
And now we're here.

02:13:20.575 --> 02:13:37.107
And the vast majority of people still think that Tony Fauci's okay, Peter Hotez is okay, almost nobody knows who Robert Malone is, almost nobody knows who Kevin McKernan is, nobody knows who Jessica Rose is, except for the people who needed to know.

02:13:38.208 --> 02:13:40.629
And that's nobody who watches Dr. Mike.

02:13:41.810 --> 02:13:49.876
There's a whole world of humans out there who don't know that we exist, don't know that the questions that we're asking exist or are even worth asking.

02:13:50.814 --> 02:13:53.035
because social media is a military trap.

02:13:53.595 --> 02:14:00.078
Scenes are causing turbo cancers because they're inserting nucleic acid into our genome.

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:07.302
No, it's because there's an SV40 insert in there and SV40 is a contaminant in all the vaccines.

02:14:07.382 --> 02:14:11.004
And that's why we find SV40 in everybody's genome now.

02:14:11.064 --> 02:14:13.705
Come on, Peter, get with the program.

02:14:14.502 --> 02:14:15.923
you have to think about that for a minute.

02:14:15.943 --> 02:14:19.204
And you have to say, wait a minute, there's no such thing as a turbo cancer.

02:14:19.224 --> 02:14:20.024
It's a made up term.

02:14:20.064 --> 02:14:27.687
And mRNA lipid nanoparticles delivered the nucleic acid package past the cell membrane into the cytoplasm, but they don't get into the nucleus.

02:14:27.707 --> 02:14:29.027
For that, you need electroporation.

02:14:29.047 --> 02:14:30.708
That's why we have no DNA vaccines.

02:14:33.989 --> 02:14:39.011
In order to get the DNA into the nucleus, you need electroporation.

02:14:40.371 --> 02:14:41.532
That's completely wrong.

02:14:42.617 --> 02:14:45.384
I don't know how much more wrong that could be.

02:14:45.504 --> 02:14:49.996
Electroporation is also to get across the cell membrane.

02:14:50.637 --> 02:14:51.499
That's wrong.

02:14:52.458 --> 02:14:57.500
So why would he be mentioning DNA vaccines and electroporation, Mark?

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:05.684
Can you imagine any reason why Peter Hotez would mention electroporation and that's why we don't have any DNA vaccines?

02:15:06.344 --> 02:15:13.307
I can't think of any reason why he would mention that together in one stupid sentence.

02:15:13.707 --> 02:15:20.571
And even if they did, we have proteins of our innate immune system that prevent incorporation of foreign nucleic acid into our genome.

02:15:20.691 --> 02:15:26.734
Otherwise, every time we eat a hamburger, you'd have cow DNA in our genome.

02:15:27.254 --> 02:15:41.301
But I have an MD and a PhD, and so I... He just told us a little while ago in one of these interviews that it's the over-credation in medicine that's really, but I've got an MD and a PhD.

02:15:41.982 --> 02:15:42.262
Stop!

02:15:43.863 --> 02:15:46.526
Man, anytime anybody throws around, oh my goodness.

02:15:46.546 --> 02:15:51.591
That's not so hard for me, but for a general physician, you know, they're like, oh, gee, I never heard that.

02:15:51.632 --> 02:15:53.033
And they need time to look it up.

02:15:53.073 --> 02:15:56.477
So it's becoming tougher and tougher.

02:15:56.737 --> 02:15:57.017
Yeah.

02:15:57.177 --> 02:16:04.345
What strategies have you used, both successfully and unsuccessfully, in helping people better understand what's true versus what's not?

02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:20.091
Well, I think, you know, over the years, I've come to recognize that, you know, people who espouse anti-vaccine views are themselves victims, victims of a very targeted, predatory, often politically motivated anti- Exactly.

02:16:21.472 --> 02:16:31.939
Most of the people in the health freedom movement are victims of CHD, ICAN, and all the other people on that list, Brownstone, Hart, Panda,

02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:36.516
They are all paramilitary organizations present only on the internet.

02:16:37.977 --> 02:16:49.873
And their whole goal is to provide an endless series of hamster wheels where you will spin around in and the clock will run out while the rest of the world doesn't even know they exist.

02:16:51.966 --> 02:16:56.912
Nobody from the Brownstone Institute's never gonna get on PBS NewsHour, I assure you.

02:16:56.932 --> 02:17:03.439
The vaccine campaign very much linked to money and the health, wellness, and influencer industry, which is very corrupt.

02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:08.825
And so that's very important to try to be as patient as you can.

02:17:09.706 --> 02:17:13.507
And I think the hard part is you wind up repeating yourselves a thousand times.

02:17:13.547 --> 02:17:18.168
I mean, I mean, how many times have, you know, I really don't think it's crazy anymore.

02:17:18.368 --> 02:17:31.491
What I think first was suggested by Mark that, that really what they're going to do is, is say that transfection doesn't really work with RNA and we need to transfect you with naked DNA that we're going to use electroporation to transfect you.

02:17:32.271 --> 02:17:32.351
Um,

02:17:33.826 --> 02:17:40.252
It's not crazy to think he just said, well, that's why we don't have, that's why we don't have DNA vaccines.

02:17:44.164 --> 02:18:03.650
somebody online, whether it's through social media, through an email, will say, you know, I'm a shill for Pfizer, the pharma companies, and how many thousands of times I have to explain, wait a minute, we made a low cost COVID vaccine that bypassed the big pharma companies, we reached 100 million people with our- In India.

02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:05.050
... Texas Children's Hospital.

02:18:05.891 --> 02:18:12.878
in collaboration with India and Indonesia, showing proof of concept that you don't need big pharma, that you could bypass big pharma.

02:18:12.918 --> 02:18:13.919
So it's just the opposite.

02:18:13.999 --> 02:18:17.682
But you practically have to repeat it on a daily basis.

02:18:17.783 --> 02:18:20.565
When you do say that, what's the feedback from the general audience?

02:18:21.666 --> 02:18:22.507
Sometimes it's...

02:18:24.369 --> 02:18:26.733
Rarely you'll get an apology, which is always the best.

02:18:26.814 --> 02:18:36.370
Remember that the main ivermectin story was really from India, that somewhere in some province of India they distributed ivermectin and COVID disappeared.

02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:38.851
also an Indian narrative.

02:18:39.291 --> 02:18:42.533
Or they'll try to find something else to discredit you.

02:18:42.553 --> 02:18:48.136
You know, there's so much- And that narrative was parroted by these people, especially Corey.

02:18:49.056 --> 02:18:52.818
Garbage, you know, about me and my colleagues that's online.

02:18:52.838 --> 02:18:56.500
The one thing that's circulating says that I'm worth $35 million.

02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:02.303
And, you know, I have to explain, no, you don't get a net worth of $35 million making low-cost recombinant.

02:19:05.825 --> 02:19:09.627
vaccines as a professor in an academic health center.

02:19:09.707 --> 02:19:10.467
It's nothing like that.

02:19:10.507 --> 02:19:11.387
I'm curious about that.

02:19:11.447 --> 02:19:16.409
How do you go about bypassing big pharma in creation of a vaccine like you did?

02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:17.930
Well, this has been my life.

02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:20.391
Bypassing big pharma.

02:19:22.435 --> 02:19:22.836
Lying!

02:19:23.436 --> 02:19:25.579
That's like getting demonetized on YouTube.

02:19:25.599 --> 02:19:26.480
It's just bullshit.

02:19:27.021 --> 02:19:29.263
All my books were all banned.

02:19:29.404 --> 02:19:30.305
Books banned.

02:19:30.725 --> 02:19:31.566
Time dream.

02:19:31.586 --> 02:19:39.956
So I actually did my MD-PhD in New York, not far from here on the east side at Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medical College.

02:19:39.976 --> 02:19:41.478
And that's what I wanted to do with my life.

02:19:42.245 --> 02:19:48.187
make vaccines, especially for parasitic diseases, diseases of poverty in low-income countries.

02:19:48.247 --> 02:19:54.190
And the hookworm vaccine- He is the most goal-centered human you've ever met, don't forget.

02:19:54.330 --> 02:20:01.632
I started working out as an MD-PhD student 40 years ago, is now showing close to 100% protection in clinical trials, so that's really exciting.

02:20:02.112 --> 02:20:02.673
That is really exciting.

02:20:02.693 --> 02:20:11.016
And then, you know, we started making coronavirus vaccines because we got approached by a group at the New York Blood Center who said, hey, Peter, just like no one cares about your

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.077
parasitic disease vaccines.

02:20:13.137 --> 02:20:17.161
No one cares about our coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS.

02:20:17.221 --> 02:20:23.206
And those were the two original pandemics back in the early 2000s.

02:20:23.406 --> 02:20:24.167
Would you work with us?

02:20:24.187 --> 02:20:24.687
So we did.

02:20:24.747 --> 02:20:30.212
And that allowed us to learn how to make coronavirus vaccines.

02:20:30.252 --> 02:20:30.892
So when the COVID

02:20:31.973 --> 02:20:34.415
19 sequence came online in January 2020.

02:20:34.515 --> 02:20:36.576
We were able to pivot and make that.

02:20:36.796 --> 02:20:46.861
But that's really not true because we have video of him saying in Congress that they tried to make coronavirus vaccines, but they didn't work because of something called antibody dependent enhancement.

02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:48.442
So he's telling a lie here already.

02:20:48.482 --> 02:20:49.382
It's a new story.

02:20:49.422 --> 02:20:50.363
It's a new narrative.

02:20:51.143 --> 02:20:56.186
You know, soon he's going to recall how his daughter has autism, but she's like 38 and has got her own business.

02:20:57.006 --> 02:20:58.107
It's just a joke to me.

02:20:59.130 --> 02:21:05.095
We licensed it with, when I say we, we call it our Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.

02:21:05.115 --> 02:21:08.218
It's all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen, with scripted bullshitters.

02:21:08.779 --> 02:21:11.822
It's good, and we're doing this, and it's good to see you again.

02:21:11.882 --> 02:21:13.843
So, Vinay, good to see you.

02:21:13.923 --> 02:21:14.564
Sandra, great to see you.

02:21:14.584 --> 02:21:15.805
Just one more data point.

02:21:17.146 --> 02:21:21.331
root causes of Diseases and we are talking about one.

02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:29.320
This is podcast number five And it was last week that they did this and they're talking about the root causes of disease what root cause of disease?

02:21:30.041 --> 02:21:33.185
potential root cause in particular and that is

02:21:34.346 --> 02:21:36.046
the roundtable we just had on talc.

02:21:36.847 --> 02:21:46.229
And so we convened experts from around the world and they came and educated us about talc and it was pretty eye-opening, I would say.

02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.789
It was.

02:21:46.809 --> 02:21:50.770
I have, you know, my association of talc was always baby powder, right?

02:21:50.890 --> 02:21:52.690
And, you know, when I'm asserting.

02:21:53.531 --> 02:22:03.053
This is Sanjula Jain Nagopal, PhD, Associate Director of Policy and Research Strategy.

02:22:03.233 --> 02:22:03.593
Why?

02:22:06.141 --> 02:22:06.561
Why?

02:22:08.662 --> 02:22:14.523
That's Vinay Prasad, head of Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

02:22:15.103 --> 02:22:15.624
Why?

02:22:16.564 --> 02:22:24.706
This is the head of the FDA, Marty Macari, a UK citizen and former employee of the World Health Organization.

02:22:25.326 --> 02:22:25.886
Why?

02:22:25.906 --> 02:22:31.448
The company was in the news a couple of years ago, but I had not thought about it since then.

02:22:31.768 --> 02:22:34.409
And now I'm reevaluating a lot of what I consume now.

02:22:36.024 --> 02:22:46.771
Yeah, I learned a ton, and I had not appreciated that it was used almost as an industrial lubricant in the tablets and pills of even commonly taken prescription medications.

02:22:47.231 --> 02:23:03.102
Director of CBER, successor to Peter Marks, is this fake child, traitor to our grandchildren, with most certainly

02:23:04.912 --> 02:23:06.753
hadn't appreciated that that was the case.

02:23:06.773 --> 02:23:13.418
The number one, three, nine, and 10 most common medications in the United States have talc.

02:23:13.858 --> 02:23:14.338
In the pill.

02:23:14.638 --> 02:23:15.699
In the pill or on the pill.

02:23:15.739 --> 02:23:19.662
Presumably so that it doesn't get stuck when it goes through the machines that machine it or something.

02:23:19.682 --> 02:23:21.983
The machine or to keep the texture of the pill.

02:23:22.143 --> 02:23:22.424
I see.

02:23:22.544 --> 02:23:25.526
And so 20 million Americans plus

02:23:26.286 --> 02:23:31.711
are taking talc probably on a daily basis on top of the talc that appears in food.

02:23:31.731 --> 02:23:33.252
Yeah, tell us about that.

02:23:33.312 --> 02:23:34.633
It appears in like gum or something.

02:23:34.653 --> 02:23:35.994
Yeah, so, I mean, it's crazy.

02:23:36.014 --> 02:23:40.939
So, you know, I grew up, my grandfather would always, like, have gum in his pocket, pockets in his jacket.

02:23:40.959 --> 02:23:43.761
Oh, my dad would always have a certain... So, I didn't know this.

02:23:43.961 --> 02:23:47.324
I always thought if you, like, open gum... Do you chew gum, by the way?

02:23:47.344 --> 02:23:48.305
Is that something you do?

02:23:48.465 --> 02:23:49.866
I do, but now... It's okay.

02:23:49.926 --> 02:23:51.688
I maybe now need to reevaluate this.

02:23:51.708 --> 02:23:53.129
I mean, it's not smoking cigarettes.

02:23:53.329 --> 02:23:53.630
I mean, it's...

02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:55.231
It's as a kid, right?

02:23:55.291 --> 02:23:56.231
It was like this tree.

02:23:56.391 --> 02:24:01.314
And so, I don't know if you can see it, but like this, there's this white dusting.

02:24:02.015 --> 02:24:03.476
And I always thought it was sugar.

02:24:03.496 --> 02:24:04.176
I thought it was flavor.

02:24:04.717 --> 02:24:06.598
I thought it was sugar or flavor.

02:24:06.678 --> 02:24:09.219
But I think in most cases, it's talc.

02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:11.000
So it doesn't stick to the wrapper.

02:24:11.061 --> 02:24:11.321
Yeah.

02:24:11.421 --> 02:24:14.563
Talc is definitely, I don't know how frequent, but it definitely

02:24:16.244 --> 02:24:24.153
is used to prevent sticking when it comes to gum and candy, and it's been used ubiquitously throughout the food supply.

02:24:25.414 --> 02:24:27.096
Doesn't this feel like winning?

02:24:27.536 --> 02:24:30.660
Aren't you so glad that we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:31.260
at the head of HHS?

02:24:33.823 --> 02:24:36.908
that we have Jay Bhattacharya at the head of NIH?

02:24:37.008 --> 02:24:44.119
Aren't you so happy that we have Marty Makary at the head of FDA and we have Vinay Prasad at the head of CBER?

02:24:44.199 --> 02:24:47.804
Isn't that exciting to have an associate director like that woman over there?

02:24:48.325 --> 02:24:49.467
Wow, am I happy!

02:24:51.851 --> 02:25:00.480
I just, I'm so glad that we don't have any Chinese people or Russian people in our government because then we'd really have a shit show on our hands.

02:25:01.281 --> 02:25:10.630
Well, you know, I've, you know, I've tried to look at the numbers and I was trying to quantify it, but it's really hard because usually it presents in trace amounts.

02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:13.313
So sometimes you don't see it on ingredient lists and it's.

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:19.265
You know, I think some places, you know, in the, in the medications, um, generic versions may be less.

02:25:19.325 --> 02:25:21.908
I wonder if those are real diamonds she's gotten her ears.

02:25:22.088 --> 02:25:22.668
Probably not.

02:25:22.869 --> 02:25:24.290
Nobody wears real diamonds, right?

02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:38.984
You have it versus the branded versions, but then, you know, it can be something in like rice and then particularly like in international, you know, rice, like Basmati rice, you know, probably is more likely to have it, which is why they kind of tell you to, or do you think an associate director at the FDA wears fake diamonds?

02:25:42.099 --> 02:25:44.401
Maybe she's just from a rich family in India, who knows?

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:46.904
Or at least my mom told me that.

02:25:46.924 --> 02:25:48.786
When you cook the rice, you rinse it.

02:25:49.146 --> 02:25:51.349
Yeah, it could be the starch and the talc and other things.

02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:52.710
Does it prevent the rice grains from sticking?

02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:55.613
Yeah, not all, but it helps with preventing the stickiness.

02:25:55.633 --> 02:26:00.278
There was a study that is cited in this recent review from Stanford that showed

02:26:00.838 --> 02:26:07.764
that some of the rice, I think it was in China, was tested and they found talc on the rice particles.

02:26:08.324 --> 02:26:10.786
I wonder if they're using PCR to find the talc.

02:26:11.907 --> 02:26:13.007
Industrial lubricant.

02:26:13.308 --> 02:26:17.051
It prevents jamming in the machines and mass production of food.

02:26:17.731 --> 02:26:20.293
And so talc is really kind of everywhere.

02:26:20.433 --> 02:26:20.953
And makeup.

02:26:21.074 --> 02:26:23.856
I mean, it's probably in my foundation or something.

02:26:23.936 --> 02:26:25.377
I mean, it's just everywhere.

02:26:25.857 --> 02:26:30.221
And we've learned a lot about talc and the potential carcinogenic risk over less.

02:26:30.301 --> 02:26:32.183
Just understand that they're all being paid.

02:26:33.925 --> 02:26:35.166
And not a shitty salary.

02:26:36.107 --> 02:26:40.491
Our taxpayer money is paying for them to do this podcast.

02:26:41.753 --> 02:26:44.255
Paying for them to pretend like they're doing work.

02:26:44.675 --> 02:26:47.238
He has an office with his name on it, for shit's sake.

02:26:49.093 --> 02:26:51.798
This should make you so angry you can hardly breathe.

02:26:52.399 --> 02:27:00.273
It's 30 years or so, and it was not well appreciated just a few decades ago that it could be linked to potentially human cancer.

02:27:01.274 --> 02:27:04.295
Well, that's what's nuts is we thought it was just in baby powder.

02:27:04.455 --> 02:27:08.477
There was a big effort to get talc out of baby powder, but we're eating it.

02:27:09.398 --> 02:27:12.139
And so what I learned at this round table, were you gonna say something?

02:27:12.159 --> 02:27:17.261
Oh, I was just gonna say that I think like initially people thought that like talc was carcinogenic because it also had asbestos in it.

02:27:17.481 --> 02:27:24.084
But then even when you look at talc separate from the asbestos containing talc, it still had a concerning safety signal.

02:27:24.564 --> 02:27:27.666
And you're gonna say, so, and then there's still residual amounts we're ingesting.

02:27:28.686 --> 02:27:29.286
And inhaling.

02:27:29.486 --> 02:27:30.747
And inhaling and putting on our face.

02:27:31.892 --> 02:27:41.897
So this all started in 1993 when the National Toxicology Program did a report and they found quote-unquote clear... He ever baled hay?

02:27:42.998 --> 02:27:47.120
He ever worked in the garage or in the barn when they're baling hay?

02:27:48.101 --> 02:27:50.462
If you don't know what I'm asking, then you've never done it.

02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:55.491
But there are usually two basic jobs baling hay.

02:27:55.691 --> 02:27:59.572
One is on the tractor and putting the hay on the elevator.

02:27:59.652 --> 02:28:05.974
And then the other one, much more shitty job, is catching the bales of hay as they come off the elevator in the barn.

02:28:06.554 --> 02:28:07.855
Because in the barn, it's hot.

02:28:08.395 --> 02:28:11.616
And in the barn, there's dust, a lot of dust.

02:28:12.296 --> 02:28:16.197
And after an afternoon of sweating your ass off in hay dust,

02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:22.574
You come out of the barn and you can actually cough up mucus balls that have dust in them.

02:28:22.694 --> 02:28:29.620
And your nose is clogged with mucus that's full of that dust after hours of working in the barn.

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:33.823
And so, ooh, we're inhaling talc.

02:28:34.164 --> 02:28:35.985
We're swallowing talc.

02:28:36.345 --> 02:28:45.573
We've got all kinds of defenses, physical, chemical, biological, that stop talc dust from harming us.

02:28:47.438 --> 02:28:51.420
to stop talc dust from harming us unless we inject it.

02:28:53.641 --> 02:28:56.403
Suddenly that bypasses all of that stuff.

02:28:56.603 --> 02:29:09.890
And I'm not suggesting that we should inject any dust from any barn or any dust from any of the manufacturer of rice or chewing gum, but they're making a whole podcast about this.

02:29:09.930 --> 02:29:11.351
This is a big concern.

02:29:13.812 --> 02:29:14.973
It's a big hamster wheel.

02:29:15.874 --> 02:29:19.818
and it's traders that maint of carcinogenic activity with talc.

02:29:19.858 --> 02:29:25.084
And then that of studies that was revi specifically looking at o they found that there wa

02:29:39.398 --> 02:29:45.342
statistically significant association between talc exposure and ovarian cancer with an odds ratio of 1.3.

02:29:46.463 --> 02:29:55.288
So roughly a 30% increase in ovarian cancer and in some cases when there was higher exposure there was believed to be an even greater risk of ovarian cancer.

02:29:55.449 --> 02:30:01.513
So promoting the very correlative probabilistic studies

02:30:02.677 --> 02:30:11.505
that are manufacturing fake facts and the main problem with modern science as if this is evidence for what he's saying.

02:30:12.045 --> 02:30:15.728
So in some interviews, he says he's going to change the way that we do things.

02:30:15.828 --> 02:30:20.452
And Jay Bhattacharya says he's going to change the way that they do things, but they're going to keep correlating.

02:30:20.812 --> 02:30:28.259
They're going to keep telling you P values and odds ratios based on computer models and AI modeling.

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:30.781
And it's all the same malevolent bullshit.

02:30:32.157 --> 02:30:35.980
Ovarian cancer I think affects like 1 in 67 women.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.723
Dude, there are few places hotter than a barn loft in August.

02:30:40.883 --> 02:30:43.045
There are few places hotter on earth.

02:30:43.245 --> 02:30:46.007
You'd have to go to somewhere like Death Valley to find something.

02:30:46.247 --> 02:30:50.130
I really believe the most common forms come from the fallopian tube.

02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:51.051
Yeah, not the ovary itself.

02:30:51.571 --> 02:31:05.107
And so there was a pathologist at this expert panel who actually said I was looking at ovarian cancer cells after resection and could see talc in the ovarian cancer in the tissue.

02:31:05.247 --> 02:31:05.547
Wow.

02:31:06.689 --> 02:31:11.094
Then in 2019, associate director says wow to director.

02:31:13.918 --> 02:31:21.641
there was a review of 30 studies that found a similar 1.3 odds ratio in its causing cancer.

02:31:22.021 --> 02:31:23.882
So it sort of affirmed the other review.

02:31:24.282 --> 02:31:29.284
And then in Taiwan, they did a study where they found oral talc consumption was associated with stomach cancer.

02:31:29.904 --> 02:31:33.945
And guess what cancers in the United States are going up in young people?

02:31:34.106 --> 02:31:35.266
It's the GI cancers.

02:31:36.209 --> 02:31:37.710
Oh boy, here we go.

02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:43.833
We're gonna cover the turbo cancers with talc and petroleum-based dyes.

02:31:44.453 --> 02:31:47.194
It's all the same bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

02:31:47.234 --> 02:31:48.675
It's all the same bullshit.

02:31:48.695 --> 02:31:49.515
With no known cause.

02:31:49.955 --> 02:31:51.236
Now, I'm not suggesting.

02:31:51.816 --> 02:31:58.339
They are all scripted because they are all in place to make sure that transfection never is blamed for anything.

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:02.141
That a novel virus is believed.

02:32:02.884 --> 02:32:09.049
that public health is believed, that virology is believed, that intramuscular injection is never questioned.

02:32:09.069 --> 02:32:17.096
The one thing I'm most confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:32:17.277 --> 02:32:19.318
It's a spectacular commitment to that lie.

02:32:19.378 --> 02:32:19.979
That's all it is.

02:32:20.019 --> 02:32:22.561
You just have to believe in the virus and never question it.

02:32:22.601 --> 02:32:23.302
Believe in the piece
