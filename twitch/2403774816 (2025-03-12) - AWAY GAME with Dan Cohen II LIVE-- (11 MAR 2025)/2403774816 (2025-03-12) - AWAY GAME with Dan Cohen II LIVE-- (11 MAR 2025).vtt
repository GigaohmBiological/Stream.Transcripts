WEBVTT

00:00.449 --> 00:07.535
like Thinking about it this morning how to approach this I think we just have a conversation.

00:07.615 --> 00:23.629
I think the thing is we make it conversational and And that'll be it and you know, and however it goes is how it goes and I'm not I don't want to try to make you Into no, but one of my friends said, you know when somebody asks you a question You don't have to give them 50 sentences.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.211
Maybe you can try and give them five or three and

00:26.932 --> 00:28.052
and then see where that goes.

00:28.112 --> 00:30.353
So that's that's also what I'm working on, too.

00:30.413 --> 00:31.334
I mean, it's hard, right?

00:31.454 --> 00:38.857
I just have a fountain of of random garbage in my head right now because I'm so discombobulated.

00:38.897 --> 00:45.159
And so it's it's quite frankly, it's a godsend in a way to have somebody like you challenge me to organize my thoughts a little bit.

00:45.199 --> 00:45.959
So I appreciate it.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.580
OK, cool, cool, cool.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.460
I'm glad.

00:49.121 --> 00:49.321
Yeah.

00:49.481 --> 00:51.782
I mean, I just I figured I was like, you know,

00:54.389 --> 00:57.211
let's just like talk as if like we're having a phone call.

00:57.311 --> 00:57.551
Yeah.

00:57.571 --> 01:09.658
The way we when we talk on the phone and like the way we talk, you know, even even right now and we're not talking like the you know, about this whole covid thing at this moment, we're talking about how we're going to talk about it, but where it's kind of conversational.

01:09.758 --> 01:15.341
And yeah, maybe at points you do talk for three or four minutes uninterrupted or whatever it is you need to make a point.

01:15.381 --> 01:16.542
And that's perfectly fine.

01:17.342 --> 01:22.443
Um, but, uh, I think if it's like kind of conversational, I think, uh, people will benefit from that.

01:22.723 --> 01:31.185
And so, um, but I'm going to, I'm going to do a little bit of a, of, of like a sort of intro, whatever you want to just start.

01:31.345 --> 01:31.946
Absolutely.

01:32.046 --> 01:32.586
Absolutely.

01:33.146 --> 01:34.146
Make it spontaneous.

01:34.206 --> 01:36.307
I promise I'm not going to drop the ball like yesterday.

01:36.867 --> 01:37.167
No worries.

01:37.187 --> 01:37.667
No, no, no.

01:40.088 --> 01:41.148
I don't see it as dropping the ball.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.588
I just see it as like a process.

01:42.888 --> 01:43.648
So it's all good.

01:45.289 --> 01:45.509
Okay.

01:45.709 --> 01:45.969
Here it goes.

01:54.517 --> 01:56.759
All right, Jay Cooey, how are you?

01:57.079 --> 01:57.459
Good morning.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.440
Good morning.

01:59.101 --> 01:59.821
I'm doing all right.

02:00.922 --> 02:05.185
It's getting warm in Pittsburgh, so now that it's spring suddenly, it's great here.

02:06.006 --> 02:06.306
Indeed.

02:06.346 --> 02:07.707
Yeah, same here in D.C.

02:08.207 --> 02:10.029
It was like 75 yesterday.

02:10.049 --> 02:10.549
It was beautiful.

02:10.749 --> 02:12.811
And I think maybe we've turned the corner.

02:14.764 --> 02:18.885
So you and I have been in touch for roughly two years.

02:19.365 --> 02:21.026
We've talked extensively.

02:21.486 --> 02:23.027
We've talked about collaborating.

02:23.807 --> 02:31.409
And I got sort of sidetracked by October 7th in Gaza and everything happening there.

02:31.509 --> 02:39.331
But, you know, the whole time, this whole COVID question and all of the implications are just eating away at the back of my head.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.792
And I've been meaning to

02:41.533 --> 02:45.014
do an interview with you or find a way to collaborate all this time.

02:45.054 --> 02:47.554
And so I'm glad we finally get to do it.

02:47.874 --> 02:48.614
So thanks a lot.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.655
Hey, no problem.

02:49.735 --> 02:54.376
I don't know what to say other than the timing probably couldn't be better at this point.

02:55.216 --> 03:03.698
So many hypothetical stars have aligned that we might have sat around a campfire and said, hey, wouldn't it be funny if this happened?

03:03.798 --> 03:04.858
And now we're here.

03:05.458 --> 03:10.119
So it makes more sense almost to talk about it now and be on

03:11.064 --> 03:16.985
somewhat stable or ground, at least in the sense of, you know, the the basic players are the basic players.

03:17.045 --> 03:18.346
And so we might as well talk about it.

03:18.426 --> 03:20.846
And it is something that's really extraordinary.

03:20.946 --> 03:31.368
When we first when we first started talking, I don't even think I was ready to to I don't even know if I'm ready right now to explain everything.

03:31.408 --> 03:33.389
I mean, it is really so overwhelming.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.822
just to kind of accept things the way that they are not perceived on TV and whatever.

03:40.862 --> 03:47.986
It's been a long journey for me because I was not awake before the pandemic, except for in certain aspects.

03:48.046 --> 03:56.089
I understood that they might lie about Hillary Clinton's past, or they might lie about Bill Clinton, or they might lie about, I don't know, Jeffrey Epstein or whatever.

03:56.109 --> 04:02.412
I understand that there are stories and within stories and certain arenas, but I guess I...

04:03.846 --> 04:13.118
I underestimated how much truth Dulles told us when he said, you know, the when the American people, everything that they believe is false, then we will have finally succeeded.

04:13.138 --> 04:15.901
I never I never understood the depth of that truth.

04:15.981 --> 04:17.824
But I think I understand it better now.

04:19.386 --> 04:19.846
Absolutely.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.369
That's such a remarkable quote, and

04:23.510 --> 04:37.756
you when you apply it to, I mean, a variety of of sort of mythologies, maybe you could call them some people, you know, would call psyops, which has, you know, kind of military implication, which is often the case.

04:38.356 --> 04:45.199
But I think, you know, we can maybe call them mythologies that are constructed intentionally.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.800
And the covid event is one of them.

04:49.681 --> 04:52.122
And I'll say, you know, for

04:52.935 --> 05:20.660
not to pump you up too much, Jay, but through the sort of journey, if we can call it that, that I've had since the earliest days of COVID until now, there are very few people who I have seen, I mean, myself, my understanding, my opinion, my analysis has changed drastically, where I was totally caught up in the narrative in a big way.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.720
No pun intended.

05:23.177 --> 05:23.457
Right.

05:24.398 --> 05:29.023
And and there's been a long process.

05:29.683 --> 05:34.588
And you are one of the people who I've seen who has gone through your own sort of process.

05:34.728 --> 05:45.659
And the people that I do not trust are the ones whose analysis has not changed, who is have not evolved or have evolved in the way that

05:46.736 --> 05:51.898
we are, you know, basically the official narrative evolved.

05:52.399 --> 05:54.680
And so, you know, there's a lot to say about that.

05:54.720 --> 06:03.604
But I mean, I think it'll be helpful for people if I kind of explain why I reached out to you, got in touch with you in the first place.

06:03.664 --> 06:07.466
So, I mean, my understanding of COVID early on was,

06:08.286 --> 06:12.869
I mean, I was very focused on regime change operations.

06:13.269 --> 06:17.352
And at that point, US regime change operations against China.

06:18.293 --> 06:23.556
There was like a color revolution in Hong Kong that was happening in 2019.

06:23.616 --> 06:29.740
These basically crazy riots that were backed by the US, where they're terrorizing the population of Hong Kong.

06:31.101 --> 06:33.243
in order to destabilize it.

06:34.063 --> 06:41.449
And there was also the whole Uyghur genocide narrative, which was totally, basically fake.

06:43.090 --> 06:48.835
And so I see this, you know, what's going on in China, that there's some crazy virus going around and

06:49.355 --> 06:55.580
And they're taking it very seriously, and they're building hospitals in three days, and everyone's wearing a mask and all these kinds of things.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.782
And I'm like, wow, that's pretty crazy.

06:58.262 --> 07:07.789
And then I start to, around a little bit after the new year of 2020, I come to understand somehow that that virus is coming here.

07:08.750 --> 07:19.362
and we are wholly unprepared and our capitalist government does not care about us and is going to let this virus spread all around and kill as many people as possible.

07:20.510 --> 07:27.375
And that was kind of like the the left wing dissident view that I had been taken in by.

07:27.875 --> 07:31.658
And so therefore, I thought we need to lock down.

07:31.678 --> 07:34.540
I mean, they're not going to like they're just going to let this thing spread.

07:36.001 --> 07:37.162
We need masks.

07:37.322 --> 07:39.343
I mean, look, everyone in China is wearing a mask.

07:39.403 --> 07:40.844
Why are we not wearing masks?

07:40.904 --> 07:42.365
The mailman is coming around.

07:42.385 --> 07:43.966
You know, I go to the grocery store.

07:44.026 --> 07:46.388
These workers are not provided with what they need.

07:47.769 --> 07:49.290
And I was like, even

07:50.601 --> 08:02.916
Before even it really hit the mainstream narrative because I was tapped into kind of what was happening in China to some degree I was like, you know, the sky is falling everyone and the media machine hadn't even really turned on here.

08:03.597 --> 08:07.121
So Then finally it happens here

08:08.082 --> 08:12.827
And, you know, everyone's going to Costco and getting toilet paper and and water.

08:12.907 --> 08:14.488
And there's this like panic.

08:14.608 --> 08:18.372
And I'm still thinking like, you know, this is this is serious.

08:18.452 --> 08:20.334
OK, like what's going to happen now?

08:22.536 --> 08:26.980
And then the origins debate started soon after that.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.361
That was one of the big questions.

08:29.395 --> 08:38.421
And it took me, I mean, whatever, I'm in some ways I'm embarrassed, but this is just it's I didn't have fluency in any of this stuff.

08:38.461 --> 08:48.208
You know, I know about like Gaza and Israel and these kinds of things, this like medical, biological virology thing.

08:49.249 --> 08:50.210
People don't know about that.

08:50.510 --> 08:52.211
It's very hard to resist the propaganda.

08:52.311 --> 08:52.431
So

08:55.052 --> 09:20.217
I was skeptical of the lab leak narrative from very, very early on, as I think a lot of leftists were, because I, and they, saw it as racist, that there's this long history of claiming that migrants, and Asian migrants especially, bring disease into our country, and we're blaming it on them, and much more likely, this is something the US may have been involved in.

09:21.474 --> 09:24.636
So I was skeptical of that and I saw who was promoting it.

09:25.797 --> 09:28.219
Very hawkish right wing figures.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.782
Senator Tom Cotton, for example.

09:34.303 --> 09:40.168
You know, Trump ended up promoting it and he has, you know, very strong anti China bend.

09:40.228 --> 09:42.489
There was all this warmongering going on with China.

09:43.290 --> 09:50.175
And I thought that this was phony, much more likely, you know, well, then probably it's a natural origin.

09:51.016 --> 10:05.546
So it took me, I would say, I don't know, a year or so to I never became like an aggressive, like angry person telling, you know, who if people didn't wear masks, I wasn't going to like denounce them or anything like that.

10:05.586 --> 10:06.986
I never became angry and aggressive.

10:07.387 --> 10:12.950
But it took me, I would say, about a year to realize there was something really fishy going on.

10:14.471 --> 10:14.631
And

10:16.980 --> 10:26.134
What I started to see, actually, one of the first big piece for me was the death certificate issue that I got clued into.

10:26.154 --> 10:27.516
And I saw there was a

10:33.664 --> 10:49.054
a directive that the CDC had issued telling medical professionals to issue death certificates in a completely different way than they had ever been issued before and only

10:49.774 --> 10:54.896
specific to this, what they claimed was a new disease, COVID-19.

10:55.416 --> 11:08.461
But the thing is, if you are issuing a death certificate in a specific way only for one disease, and you don't have a standard way that you're just applying to all of them, then you're going to get a different result using different tests, right?

11:08.681 --> 11:09.901
So a different measure.

11:10.521 --> 11:14.423
So that started to suggest to me that there's something seriously wrong here.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.284
Maybe I can even pull up

11:21.215 --> 11:22.715
Hold on, I'm gonna pull up.

11:22.775 --> 11:24.956
Okay, I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna pull it up.

11:25.676 --> 11:29.957
I think this will be really actually instructive for people.

11:34.118 --> 11:36.879
Death certificate, here we go.

11:43.301 --> 11:44.421
Death certificate.

11:56.167 --> 11:56.427
Okay.

12:00.892 --> 12:01.212
Oh, shoot.

12:10.161 --> 12:10.662
Okay, resume.

12:14.232 --> 12:19.258
Okay, so I start to see there's something funny going on with the death certificates.

12:19.518 --> 12:23.463
Specifically, this is the alert.

12:23.523 --> 12:26.526
There were a series of alerts that the CDC issued.

12:27.527 --> 12:30.250
And in particular, if you look at this language,

12:32.950 --> 12:36.312
basically, you have to understand how death certificates work.

12:36.352 --> 12:40.615
And I spent weeks learning that with someone who had a lot of experience in death certificates.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.637
And what I saw in here, the key thing was that

12:47.577 --> 13:07.310
COVID-19 would be, it says the underlying cause are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying, the underlying cause of, okay, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.

13:07.891 --> 13:11.733
So this is before they have said what these new.

13:11.813 --> 13:12.554
Wow.

13:12.674 --> 13:13.915
I've never seen that before.

13:13.955 --> 13:16.096
At least maybe if you showed it to me, it's been a long time.

13:16.116 --> 13:16.857
That's funny.

13:16.937 --> 13:17.157
Wow.

13:18.097 --> 13:18.658
So right.

13:18.678 --> 13:24.041
So like any scientific minded person should understand they are now biasing people.

13:24.421 --> 13:28.844
So they're creating their they've they're they're stating what their intentions are.

13:29.024 --> 13:30.865
We want more COVID-19 deaths.

13:32.326 --> 13:39.290
So if you really examine this death certificate stuff, what they did is actually flip it on its head.

13:39.470 --> 13:42.992
So the bottom there, the bottom there, it's even better where it's bolded.

13:43.732 --> 13:53.582
COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease is caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.

13:53.602 --> 13:54.883
So you don't even need a test.

13:54.983 --> 13:55.444
No, no.

13:55.464 --> 13:56.605
It gets better.

13:56.745 --> 13:56.985
Yes.

13:57.305 --> 13:58.006
Yeah, crazy.

13:58.767 --> 13:59.127
Oh, yeah.

13:59.147 --> 14:02.010
So I mean, actually, I have even, um, uh,

14:02.907 --> 14:07.831
Sorry, I have to look over there to that screen and then I can see it very big, so that's why I'm looking over there for your viewers.

14:07.851 --> 14:20.562
I have videos of CDC, top CDC scientists and doctors giving like a seminar or like instructions to medical professionals around the United States.

14:21.403 --> 14:26.226
I'm saying that, yeah, you don't if you think it's covid-19, just mark it as covid-19.

14:26.326 --> 14:27.026
Fantastic.

14:27.046 --> 14:28.387
I would love to see that stuff.

14:28.427 --> 14:30.688
That stuff needs to be revisited and archived.

14:31.089 --> 14:33.830
It's not probably archived any on any of my sites yet.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.751
I should have a few of those videos archived.

14:35.931 --> 14:36.492
I have it all.

14:36.512 --> 14:37.252
I have it all.

14:37.372 --> 14:48.919
And then and then there was actually a question from from a doctor who says, OK, well, do you want to know, you know, if we have like an initial an assessment that, yes, this is covid-19 is probable.

14:49.679 --> 14:56.566
Do you want us to come back when we have confirmation of when it was, of whether it was actually covid-19, if it's confirmed or not?

14:57.067 --> 14:59.369
And they said, yeah, but you know what?

14:59.469 --> 15:01.271
You don't have to do that because we're not going to change it.

15:01.291 --> 15:04.114
It's just going to be marked as covid-19 anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.056
They basically say that.

15:06.957 --> 15:07.077
So.

15:08.258 --> 15:20.632
So this is a huge scandal from the top, and I began to understand mine, you know, the entire basis of like everything I've thought about this was was probably wrong.

15:23.795 --> 15:34.539
I spent several weeks on this death certificate thing, trying to understand it and going through these alerts that they had put out.

15:35.880 --> 15:43.803
And then I started to look at the narrative of the origins debate.

15:44.183 --> 15:46.144
At some point, I started to look at the origin of the narrative.

15:46.524 --> 15:48.545
I'm sorry, you know what it was as I saw

15:50.169 --> 15:57.114
Denis Rancourt's work, where he basically said there's no evidence of a pandemic.

15:57.634 --> 16:00.716
Now, there's a lot to be discussed about that.

16:00.996 --> 16:11.663
Denis Rancourt is a Canadian scientist and physicist who did a lot of the early work looking at the death data.

16:12.824 --> 16:18.448
And his position was that there's no evidence of a pandemic.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.850
So of a spreading virus.

16:21.910 --> 16:28.832
So and we'll come back to that, Jay, because I know you have a lot to say about it now.

16:29.873 --> 16:39.456
That made me think, well, if that's correct, OK, I want to look at the narrative of of the origins debate.

16:39.816 --> 16:41.197
And so what I started to see

16:42.395 --> 16:50.701
is there was a concerted effort starting in January, 2020 with articles like this.

16:50.741 --> 16:56.005
This is one of the early ones from the Washington times saying virus.

16:57.306 --> 16:58.367
Oh, have you seen this one?

16:58.427 --> 16:59.047
Yeah.

16:59.167 --> 17:05.312
But all the more importantly, the Washington times is the one place I was actually quoted before they kind of quieted me down.

17:05.352 --> 17:05.993
So it's funny.

17:06.033 --> 17:06.433
I like that.

17:07.449 --> 17:07.689
Right.

17:08.189 --> 17:11.591
So coronavirus linked to China biowarfare program possible.

17:11.791 --> 17:13.572
Analyst says who is this analyst?

17:14.333 --> 17:15.433
This analyst is.

17:16.394 --> 17:21.276
Well, first, it's referencing Radio Free Asia, the old CIA propaganda outlet funded by the U.S.

17:21.316 --> 17:21.676
government.

17:22.176 --> 17:26.979
And they and they reference Danny Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer.

17:27.259 --> 17:27.659
Officer.

17:28.360 --> 17:30.541
OK, so that's pretty shady.

17:30.601 --> 17:31.601
Why is that name?

17:31.641 --> 17:33.422
That name rings a bell with me.

17:33.502 --> 17:36.504
That's not like some kind of Israeli super soldier guy, is it?

17:36.584 --> 17:36.644
Or.

17:38.241 --> 17:45.990
That's the only time I've heard of him, and he's linked to some NATO program that... Oh, there's something to... I gotta write that name down.

17:46.050 --> 17:46.951
That's awesome.

17:46.971 --> 17:47.411
Wow, okay.

17:48.283 --> 17:56.611
Okay, so, so this is, you know, the basically, right wing media promoting lab leak early on.

17:56.731 --> 18:01.296
And at this point, the mainstream media is saying no, no, no, no, no, this is racist.

18:01.356 --> 18:02.197
This is crazy.

18:02.277 --> 18:03.938
Donald Trump is a lunatic.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.080
Steve Bannon, Tom Cotton, they're crazy.

18:06.121 --> 18:07.061
How could they say that?

18:07.822 --> 18:09.944
And then you have

18:11.545 --> 18:14.047
Another one that you should keep in your list is Steve Bannon.

18:14.087 --> 18:19.871
The first person that I ever found to say it on the on the media was Steve Bannon, that that that it was a lab leak.

18:19.911 --> 18:21.712
I think he said it on January 25th.

18:22.913 --> 18:29.258
OK, so, yeah, Bannon, you know, you and I know it's a key figure in this we can talk about.

18:29.278 --> 18:31.739
But so so I just want to illustrate this dynamics.

18:31.799 --> 18:38.344
On one hand, you have basically NATO aligned Israeli disinformation

18:40.720 --> 18:47.484
claiming that this is a lab leak from some Chinese biowarfare program, some kind of version of that.

18:47.824 --> 18:59.991
Then on the other hand, you have the Poynter Institute, which is funded by the National Endowment for Democracy, which I knew very well as basically a CIA front meddling arm that operates all over the world.

19:01.733 --> 19:13.581
and funded by Google, funded by basically the other arm of the deep state, saying that, no, this is not true.

19:13.641 --> 19:20.366
This is false, that Danny Shoham's claim in The Washington Times is false.

19:21.026 --> 19:27.951
And oh, I should also say that the author of this Washington Times article is Bill Gertz.

19:28.491 --> 19:29.191
Bill Gertz.

19:29.412 --> 19:31.093
Bill Gertz is the guy who interviewed me.

19:32.574 --> 19:32.875
Really?

19:33.055 --> 19:33.255
Yeah.

19:33.676 --> 19:34.777
He wrote the same article.

19:34.897 --> 19:35.097
Yeah.

19:36.018 --> 19:36.259
OK.

19:36.819 --> 19:41.224
Bill Gertz is basically like longtime Pentagon official.

19:42.766 --> 19:43.147
I will.

19:44.048 --> 19:46.911
Well, that's again, that's me not doing my legwork.

19:46.971 --> 19:47.451
But yeah.

19:47.492 --> 19:47.632
Wow.

19:48.553 --> 19:52.155
like longtime neoconservative with ties to the Pentagon, the CIA.

19:52.395 --> 20:10.745
He actually got fired from his position at the Washington Free Beacon after he took a $100,000 loan from a Hong Kong tycoon that was arranged by the fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who became like Miles Guo, right?

20:11.406 --> 20:13.587
Oh, my gosh, dude, what are you?

20:14.568 --> 20:16.949
Why haven't I had this conversation already?

20:17.029 --> 20:17.529
Wow.

20:18.350 --> 20:18.650
I don't know.

20:18.670 --> 20:22.571
I don't think we ever talked in this about about this level of details, though.

20:23.172 --> 20:30.214
And so he was he was hailing Myles Guo, if I'm saying that that name right, as this anti corruption figure.

20:30.234 --> 20:31.255
And so it's totally corrupt.

20:31.315 --> 20:37.537
So this guy's this guy's like a CIA operative who's writing this this like total slop.

20:39.658 --> 20:54.044
And of course, Miles Guo ended up, you know, he was very close with Steve Bannon and they went out on a yacht and declared that they were creating like they were basically announcing like one Guaido style regime change in China.

20:55.585 --> 21:00.527
So so you start to see this how this like whole thing comes together.

21:00.607 --> 21:07.290
You have basically one side of the deep state saying that

21:08.553 --> 21:12.535
lab leak is probably what happened is probably responsible for covid.

21:12.855 --> 21:16.037
And then you have the other side saying, no, no, no, no, no.

21:16.177 --> 21:22.900
This is you know, it's a natural origin and neither of them will give any conclusive claim or evidence.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.401
Neither of them will ever prove it.

21:24.741 --> 21:31.505
And this is like the tip of the tip of the iceberg in terms of the research I have showing how this narrative

21:32.353 --> 21:59.174
was uh... uh... rolled out it was you know so so the so the whole idea is that we stay uh... uh... what you know the the question they want us to ask is what is the origin of this virus which is all presupposed on the idea that there is some virus spreading around and that we're just supposed to accept that they don't want to talk about if that's actually true

22:01.916 --> 22:09.081
I get so and again, I have a you know, if you said on Facebook, if you said that there was a lab leak for a while, you would have been suspended.

22:09.141 --> 22:11.502
But then they lifted that suspension arbitrarily.

22:12.083 --> 22:20.328
And Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert suddenly, you know, Jon Stewart goes in the Stephen Colbert show a year later and says, actually, I think it is a lab leak.

22:20.368 --> 22:22.309
And it what was once a.

22:23.490 --> 22:40.555
racist and right wing uh... conspiracy theory suddenly became welcome in polite liberal society and then it became kind of like what most people thought uh... but again there was never any definitive proof and we've been just it's just constant

22:41.215 --> 22:41.295
to

22:57.652 --> 23:11.684
There was a new assessment that with low confidence that it maybe came from a lab, which again is just total slop It's meaningless low confidence Some agencies think so some agencies think don't think so.

23:11.804 --> 23:18.589
It's there's never any concrete conclusive Assessment nor is there any evidence provided?

23:18.709 --> 23:23.333
So so this Made me think

23:25.251 --> 23:28.195
I'm really starting to suspect this whole thing is fake.

23:29.898 --> 23:35.465
And I reached out to Denis, like, is this even biologically possible?

23:35.545 --> 23:36.847
Is this just science fiction?

23:37.348 --> 23:39.851
And Denis said, you need to talk to Jay Cooey.

23:40.832 --> 23:46.256
And I think I maybe watched like one or two of your streams or something like that.

23:47.056 --> 23:51.859
And then I called you on the phone and I sat on my porch and explained to you who I am.

23:52.359 --> 23:55.101
And we talked for probably two hours.

23:55.241 --> 24:04.087
And and, you know, you kind of opened my eyes to a whole sort of biological angle that confirmed what I suspected.

24:04.887 --> 24:08.168
And we've been basically in touch, you know, on and off since then.

24:08.828 --> 24:12.530
I've just been so wrapped up with with Gaza and everything happening there.

24:12.630 --> 24:23.433
But so that's why I reached out to Jay, which, you know, when I did redacted the other day and they and they asked me that and I just kind of gave like a really brief version.

24:23.453 --> 24:26.975
But I want to explain that in a bit more detail so people can understand.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.736
You know, I think when you have

24:31.587 --> 24:36.369
A big part of getting the right answer is having the right question.

24:36.409 --> 24:37.289
You're halfway there.

24:37.369 --> 24:44.472
And so once you've figured out, oh, what is it that I'm actually trying to answer, then you know where to go.

24:44.532 --> 24:47.553
But if you don't know what the right question is, you're not going to get anywhere.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.894
So that's how that's what led me to you, Jay.

24:50.794 --> 25:00.038
Yeah, that's I think I want to jump off from there and make a quick point for everybody listening that as you investigated the

25:01.926 --> 25:13.575
the idea of a lab leak or a natural virus and it's spreading to America, you investigated it with the tools and the angles and the ideas and the sources that you're used to using.

25:13.635 --> 25:22.522
And so at the start of the pandemic, that's the interesting position that I found myself in was I was an academic biologist working at a med school.

25:24.003 --> 25:31.146
I just started reading what I considered to be what anybody would read in my position, the primary literature about coronavirus.

25:31.166 --> 25:35.708
So everything on PubMed, all this peer-reviewed stuff, all the barrack papers.

25:36.708 --> 25:42.271
And if you read scientific literature for a living, you understand what is being written there.

25:42.391 --> 25:45.312
And essentially when I write it, when I would write a paper, now,

25:46.055 --> 25:52.200
Maybe your listeners don't know this yet, but I was a neurobiologist and that sounds like a big deal, but it's really not.

25:52.220 --> 25:54.102
I worked almost exclusively on mice.

25:54.822 --> 25:56.864
All of my experiments were on mice neurons.

25:56.924 --> 26:01.067
I looked at how neurons communicate with each other and synaptic connections, yada, yada, yada.

26:02.729 --> 26:15.159
I felt very comfortable reading the literature of coronavirus and RNA viruses and flu viruses and infectious disease because as a biologist, I kind of understood that, you know,

26:16.184 --> 26:19.505
what the limitations of a lot of the methodologies are.

26:19.585 --> 26:25.786
Virology is not like a bunch of magic or very specialized techniques.

26:25.846 --> 26:31.868
Most of the techniques that are in virology are developed somewhere else and then brought to virology or applied to virology.

26:32.528 --> 26:36.569
And I came to figure out very quickly that surprisingly

26:38.271 --> 26:43.358
Let's say surprisingly little progress has been made in the methodologies used in virology.

26:43.398 --> 26:46.903
And so once you understand one paper, you understand a lot of them.

26:47.744 --> 26:53.472
And the one consensus message that I got from the primary literature is that viruses are real.

26:54.073 --> 26:54.954
They're everywhere.

26:55.895 --> 26:58.757
And some of them are more dangerous than others.

26:59.017 --> 27:06.161
And there seemed to be a very general agreement that you could manipulate them, change them, purify them, culture them.

27:06.261 --> 27:08.543
And they did this all around the world all the time.

27:08.623 --> 27:10.324
And so this was...

27:11.562 --> 27:17.643
edified in my mind by the fact that I used viruses on my bench and I transfected animals.

27:17.683 --> 27:18.804
We can talk about that later.

27:18.864 --> 27:25.405
So I had this sort of opposite conclusion in the mystery solving exercise.

27:25.445 --> 27:39.548
Instead of coming to the conclusion that this must be fake, I came to the conclusion that this happens all the time and that they're just talking about something that is always going on in a way to make it seem like it's a crisis when it's not.

27:40.348 --> 27:43.589
And I understood virology as understanding this.

27:43.890 --> 27:54.354
And so at first, I approached it very naively to my faculty and my friends at work, you know, just kind of like, but yeah, but dude, they've been talking about lab leaks for for 20 years.

27:54.394 --> 27:56.215
I mean, it's not wouldn't be unusual.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.115
And if it did, why would we worry about it?

27:58.175 --> 28:01.257
We've had exposure to these things before, like,

28:02.237 --> 28:13.168
I was thinking I was understanding it from the exact sort of, you know, almost the flip of the coin of you in the sense of not only is a lab leak possible, but that's also not dangerous and also could be exaggerated.

28:13.809 --> 28:14.810
And that message

28:16.095 --> 28:21.760
was met with a lot of resistance from the people that I was solving the mystery with.

28:22.241 --> 28:29.667
Maybe this is a good time to drop in that I got involved with this group named Drastic, most of whom I still don't know who they are.

28:30.608 --> 28:37.134
And at some point we parted ways simply because they were absolutely sure that the origin of the virus was the most important answer.

28:38.015 --> 28:39.056
to get to.

28:54.435 --> 29:21.072
Supposedly you're tasked with solving the lab leak proving that it did come from a lab and it and it you guys got written up in you guys got written up prominently in You said Vanity Fair right and then and Tucker Tucker did a segment about it wrong yeah, definitely he he attributed the founding of the group to the wrong person on Twitter it can only be one person because that's how Twitter works and

29:22.001 --> 29:30.149
And then he also said that one of the primary members was this guy, Jamie Metzl, who was never in the group, which was really a bizarre thing for him to say.

29:30.329 --> 29:33.572
For a while, I was, you know, like really mad about that.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.633
Like Tucker Carlson didn't give us credit.

29:36.874 --> 29:37.115
Right.

29:37.175 --> 29:44.001
And Jamie Metzl is one of the kind of maybe the most prominent liberal proponent of the

29:44.950 --> 29:49.433
a lab leak theory or op, we might say.

29:49.594 --> 29:51.755
And he's a longtime government official, U.S.

29:51.795 --> 29:57.079
government official, who is super hawkish on China, extremely hawkish on China.

29:57.139 --> 30:05.825
So so, you know, his or his I don't know, the fact that he was said to be involved or some the whole thing.

30:07.961 --> 30:09.041
I mean, I know, you know, I don't know.

30:10.042 --> 30:19.725
You can say how you how you see it now, but I mean, it sounds like you were in a way unwittingly recruited to promote this narrative.

30:20.566 --> 30:28.188
I mean, I think to a large extent, everyone should see themselves as unwittingly recruited to promote this narrative on social media.

30:28.348 --> 30:31.770
And if you were really good at it, you might have been even promoted by other people.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.151
And so a lot of this, I think,

30:36.235 --> 30:48.000
in retrospect, really feels like a lot of unwitting participants, you know, that are just, I don't know, trying to make ends meet, trying to figure it out and believing people and, and the trick is, you know,

30:49.724 --> 31:06.369
Just the vast majority of people don't get entangled as much as I did, and maybe, you know, to a certain extent with regard to Gaza, you are a person who gets more entangled than a lot of people ever have, and so you tend to rub elbows with more of these people who are tasked with

31:07.760 --> 31:14.083
What I say on my stream is sort of curating this limited spectrum of debate where nobody really answers any important questions.

31:14.163 --> 31:20.646
And so I just grossly underestimated how the pandemic would have that aspect.

31:20.706 --> 31:25.649
I didn't understand, even after having read the Spars pandemic document, for example, where they

31:26.309 --> 31:45.836
explicitly talk about controlling the opinion of the populace on social media had never dawned on me that what I was experiencing with the group Drastic or on Twitter or at the University of Pittsburgh might all be some aspect of a national security theater.

31:47.077 --> 31:53.219
Now I tend to see most things through that lens, unfortunately maybe.

31:54.460 --> 31:54.660
Right.

31:54.900 --> 31:58.363
Well, no, I think it's, you know, learned by experience.

31:58.423 --> 32:02.247
And I OK, so I interrupted you.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.349
You were you were basically you got involved with drastic.

32:05.569 --> 32:06.831
And then where were you?

32:06.931 --> 32:07.651
Where were we going?

32:08.572 --> 32:11.595
Well, I mean, at some point we should just tell everybody.

32:11.615 --> 32:12.135
I really

32:15.816 --> 32:21.140
have a pretty unblemished record of integrity in the sense of exactly what you said at the beginning of the stream.

32:21.240 --> 32:30.148
You know, you and I change our opinions and we alter our message when necessary and presented with facts that are contradictory to what we thought.

32:31.589 --> 32:36.913
And through that process, I went from being a full-blown lab leak

32:37.876 --> 32:40.037
let me help Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:40.077 --> 32:46.559
write a book about the lab leak to being somebody who understood the biology well enough to know that that also was a myth.

32:48.259 --> 33:03.424
And the circumstances as they are, this guy is now Health and Human Services Secretary, and it stands that there are things that apparently he's not going to tell everybody and not going to say.

33:06.713 --> 33:17.081
I don't know what to do necessarily about how to move forward with this knowledge, but I am for sure and confident that I could explain it to anybody in great detail.

33:18.122 --> 33:23.546
The biological concepts that edify this, you know, you can just forget that there is an RNA pandemic.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.569
And I understand that that's hard to explain.

33:27.429 --> 33:34.175
But if you can see it from a bigger political perspective where, you know,

33:35.905 --> 33:38.687
I mean, let's just do the do a thought exercise.

33:38.707 --> 33:44.630
Do you know this story of the bear in Central Park and the bike of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

33:45.931 --> 33:46.831
You never heard that story?

33:46.851 --> 33:47.211
I don't.

33:47.852 --> 33:49.513
I think it sounds familiar.

33:49.533 --> 33:53.735
There was a there was a little story where apparently when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:53.775 --> 34:02.900
was like 50 years old, he was riding around in a car with some friends in New York and they found a dead bear on the road.

34:03.757 --> 34:23.813
and then they took the dead bear and a bicycle that they had in their car and they put it in the park and thought it would be a funny joke, I guess, that the bear and the bi- I don't know the whole story, but it appears, you know, like, as an- it's an anecdotal example of

34:25.267 --> 34:35.812
You know, if you knew, for example, that this book was not written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but was written by, like, a group of, like, 15 people that included me, would you think the same thing?

34:35.872 --> 34:47.238
And if you knew that the Fauci book was written that way, if you knew that... that... I just think we have to be aware of the fact that a lot of the opinions, a lot of the things that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:47.298 --> 34:50.600
says are very much influenced by people behind him.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.561
And so... I just...

34:54.988 --> 35:06.377
I thought at some point when I joined his team that I was joining the winning team and that I had finally, you know, we were going to win and that this was really a moment in American history in my mind.

35:06.517 --> 35:07.918
I know it sounds stupid now.

35:09.419 --> 35:15.403
And in reality, I think what I did was I got really close to how the

35:18.140 --> 35:27.285
to seeing how the nation is governed and learning, at least in this little aspect, how the nation is governed.

35:27.345 --> 35:32.028
And so, yeah, I'm not sure really.

35:33.433 --> 35:34.994
how to say it any better than that.

35:35.054 --> 35:38.697
I mean, I think there are things that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:38.777 --> 35:41.179
won't tell you because he's advised not to.

35:41.239 --> 35:42.219
He's told not to.

35:42.279 --> 35:44.821
Maybe he's been convinced that what I said is wrong.

35:44.881 --> 35:45.342
I don't know.

35:46.743 --> 35:54.548
But I do think that I have not been given the chance that I thought I would get to represent these ideas.

35:54.588 --> 35:57.070
And in fact, all of the people that

35:58.328 --> 36:03.170
that at one point in time said that they understood these ideas and thought they were great are now ignoring me.

36:03.210 --> 36:11.934
And it's really, it's quite terrifying from the perspective of being a father and a biologist and somebody who really just, just wants the truth out.

36:14.094 --> 36:18.236
It's really a weird and disturbing place to be right now, but also good.

36:18.456 --> 36:24.919
I have a lot of hope because I think we do know the truth, or at least we are much closer to it.

36:26.198 --> 36:28.581
than we were a few years ago.

36:30.423 --> 36:43.617
So if we go back a little bit, so you basically were part of this group of sleuths, lab leak sleuths that were going to show, prove that it was a lab leak.

36:45.039 --> 36:47.041
And, you know, when we talked before, you told me

36:47.850 --> 36:50.773
you get a call from Robert Kennedy Jr.

36:51.453 --> 37:01.322
and instantly recognized his voice and basically he wanted to hire you to write his book, the Wuhan cover-up, right?

37:03.524 --> 37:10.730
Really, he spoke in very wide terms at first, that he just wanted to support my work and he wanted to find a way to

37:12.915 --> 37:22.017
to help me, and in the end, in about a month, that turned into working as a part of the editorial team of that book, and that meant working for Children's Health Defense.

37:23.057 --> 37:24.958
I mean, that's who paid me.

37:25.058 --> 37:31.159
I mean, I was talking to Bobby all the time and getting, sorry, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and I hate when I call him Bobby.

37:31.219 --> 37:35.501
I got into that habit, and I don't think it's very respectful.

37:37.782 --> 37:40.166
I was in a lot of Zoom meetings with Mr. Kennedy.

37:40.206 --> 37:46.074
I was in text and email conversations with him about scientific stuff.

37:46.114 --> 37:49.178
He would ping me if I needed to check a citation, that kind of thing.

37:49.219 --> 37:51.822
It felt real, and it was real in my mind.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.922
I mean, uh, people responded to my emails in minutes.

37:56.323 --> 38:02.708
Um, I really felt important, uh, and I felt well used in the sense of as a resource I was, I was put to work.

38:03.088 --> 38:10.134
Um, and, and that made me also, you know, relearn and, and better learn a lot of the things that I thought I did on my own before meeting him.

38:10.214 --> 38:15.298
And so in a lot of ways, I'm very happy that that obviously I'm very happy that that happened.

38:15.318 --> 38:19.521
It also provided a year and a half of, of, of solid income for my family.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.744
Um, but yeah, it's, uh,

38:24.022 --> 38:32.785
We're in a remarkable place right now because I can, I think, very succinctly explain why there was no pandemic.

38:32.905 --> 38:41.008
And more importantly, I can explain a number of possible ways that the biosecurity state could have set it up.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.002
Those questions are all not being asked.

38:48.082 --> 38:54.847
I mean, one of the maybe the thing that let me let me go into the like, no, I don't I don't want to go into that at all.

38:54.908 --> 38:55.848
I didn't want to go into that.

38:55.888 --> 38:57.069
I just keep getting stuck there.

38:57.189 --> 38:57.550
OK.

38:57.610 --> 38:58.570
Yeah.

38:58.631 --> 38:58.991
No, no.

38:59.031 --> 39:05.036
I mean, this is the I think it's an important you know, it's an important it's the essential question.

39:05.116 --> 39:14.824
But I just want to I want the audience to understand that in the middle of research, writing for

39:15.784 --> 39:18.025
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

39:17.985 --> 39:26.590
's book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, which sought to prove or make a very strong case that

39:28.700 --> 39:37.802
COVID-19 came from a lab, the Wuhan lab, you realize that the entire premise of the book was false.

39:38.582 --> 39:45.384
And you went to him or you, I don't know, called email, wrote in some capacity, communicated that to him.

39:45.944 --> 39:48.225
And he told you this is not the book for that.

39:50.105 --> 39:53.986
Yeah, I mean, he see he explained to me that he sees this as a historical document.

39:54.026 --> 39:58.207
He wants to wanted to record what people said when they said it.

39:59.637 --> 40:23.254
Um, and so he suggested to me, I feel like that, that that left it open for me to put a quote in there, you know, and, and so ever after that conversation, I was trying very hard to get my side of the story in there that these, that these signals could be exaggerated, that, you know, the, the danger could be exaggerated and that, that they wouldn't even need a virus to pull this off.

40:23.294 --> 40:28.077
And that's all in the book, but it's in the book in such a way that you're, you're not.

40:29.653 --> 40:31.854
you're not gonna really see it as the conclusion.

40:31.874 --> 40:42.800
The overwhelming conclusion of the book is that all these people around the world agree that not only is it a leak, but obviously it was a leak and that the sequence shows it to you and that the diffuse proposal shows it to you.

40:42.820 --> 40:55.948
And a lot of these things that I came to understand as part of a biosecurity state theater, once I understood the biology was impossible, but it just, this wasn't the book for it.

40:56.008 --> 40:57.128
And so in a lot of ways,

40:58.889 --> 41:21.779
I even when the book was published and I started working for Children's Health Defense, I still had the idea that I was going to be able to get across the finish line, that maybe I would do it as the staff scientist of CHD working with Brian Hooker and and Mary Holland, that I would be able to work under them and teach this biology in the right way and help them accomplish something that they hadn't accomplished yet.

41:22.360 --> 41:25.341
And that that also turned out to be something that wasn't meant to be.

41:27.156 --> 41:28.457
I don't know how I got there either.

41:28.497 --> 41:35.540
I mean, it's just, it's a difficult thing because again, we're talking about the biology, we're talking about very short timescales.

41:35.580 --> 41:45.104
And what I should be saying to you to try and get this message out there is that this isn't about viruses and virology.

41:45.144 --> 41:54.487
That's the convenient myth that our children learn as they participate or passively or actively in this theater on social media.

41:54.627 --> 41:55.148
Instead,

41:55.928 --> 42:12.251
What your viewers should think about is that this is a much longer timescale operation that has to do with the FDA, has to do with medicine and public health and the regulation of supplements and the regulation of IP, like intellectual property in medicine and pharmaceuticals.

42:13.071 --> 42:21.013
And the fact of the matter is, is that the FDA plays a central role in the regulation of safe and effective things.

42:21.733 --> 42:26.306
And so it's not for nothing that at the start of the pandemic, they were throwing those words around.

42:26.366 --> 42:27.349
It's not for nothing that

42:27.836 --> 42:32.579
that the FDA was actually started by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

42:32.559 --> 42:33.180
's father.

42:33.320 --> 42:37.663
It's not for nothing that this legacy is there and that this guy is now there.

42:37.723 --> 42:54.774
That's my best feeling on this, that from the perspective of what this is about, if this was about health, then when he announced his presidency or presidential candidacy and running on making America healthy again, he would have mentioned the opioid epidemic and he didn't.

42:55.394 --> 43:08.444
And so there's lots of little pieces of the puzzle that started to fall into place as I imagined him going to lead us somewhere that he never led us to and would take on my knowledge in a way that he never took it on.

43:08.484 --> 43:16.411
And I don't have an explanation for it, but I know for sure that he and people around him know what I know.

43:17.031 --> 43:19.513
And probably, I think they know it's right.

43:19.573 --> 43:20.434
That's the worst part.

43:21.977 --> 43:34.844
I mean, I just, you know, when you're kind of trying to characterize or understand his behavior of when you told him this is biologically impossible.

43:35.144 --> 43:39.166
In other words, the thesis of your entire book is false.

43:39.266 --> 43:40.067
Like you are

43:40.627 --> 43:44.089
You know, you're putting out a book that basically says the earth is flat.

43:44.329 --> 43:46.351
And I've realized that the earth is not flat.

43:46.431 --> 43:49.352
And he says, well, that's not the place for that, for this.

43:50.113 --> 43:55.676
Well, if you want to know what the real reaction was, the real reaction was after that email.

43:56.117 --> 44:01.660
About a week later, I was on the Defender podcast and I was supposed to be on for an hour.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.641
This is this is Children Health Defense.

44:03.721 --> 44:04.301
Right.

44:04.362 --> 44:06.463
But it's it's it's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

44:06.443 --> 44:08.084
's podcast hosted by.

44:08.244 --> 44:08.964
So he's the host.

44:10.465 --> 44:32.321
I was supposed to be on for an hour with him, but two days before the podcast was recorded He decided that I only got seven minutes and that Robert Malone Meryl Nass Jessica Rose and Tess Laurie would also be there to comment and in fact Robert Malone spoke for about 45 minutes after I spoke for seven minutes and so it felt very

44:33.641 --> 44:34.662
I was very upset.

44:35.163 --> 44:41.509
I can say it no other way because it's, you know, it's not pretty hard for me to do something in seven minutes.

44:41.910 --> 44:48.356
And I tried, but even the email I sent him would have taken me longer than seven minutes to read.

44:48.456 --> 44:51.339
So for me, it was very frustrating.

44:51.379 --> 44:54.903
But what I see in retrospect now,

44:56.344 --> 45:18.264
Given that Mary Holland fired me for speaking about Robert Malone on my on my podcast I have the feeling that Robert Malone might be somebody who's very much in the background of Robert F Kennedy jr In terms of advising him in terms of keeping him off of certain topics or keeping certain topics in a safe realm I don't know but

45:19.986 --> 45:22.648
You know, Children's Health Defense has published several books of his.

45:23.409 --> 45:26.511
Robert Malone was a reader on the Wuhan book.

45:26.591 --> 45:32.775
I mean, he has, you know, he's best friends with Merrill Nass, his, you know, scientific advisor for a long time.

45:33.576 --> 45:45.665
So it's hard for me to forget that Robert Malone has been so important in this and is probably one of the people that is behind this, I don't know what I would call it.

45:46.727 --> 45:47.447
Let me say this.

45:47.648 --> 46:08.079
I mean, if you you know, you're listed in the Wuhan cover up is the first person in the acknowledgments as the first person with with without your expertise and your labor, the book would not have been possible.

46:08.460 --> 46:14.463
I don't know why, you know, if I don't know if he chose to put you there for a reason or not.

46:14.563 --> 46:15.584
But I mean, if I'm

46:16.676 --> 46:32.343
If I've hired someone, a scientist, biologist, to write a book and I don't have the scientific expertise to evaluate a lot of the claims being made, which is why I've hired that person, and they come to me and tell me we got it all wrong.

46:33.004 --> 46:36.046
we need to totally reevaluate the entire premise of the book.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.269
And I say, this isn't the book for that.

46:39.329 --> 46:40.610
Let's have a discussion.

46:40.710 --> 46:50.657
And I put you with seven or eight other people, and I just give you a few minutes to present your case and basically stick you away in the corner.

46:51.057 --> 46:53.079
That's a nice way of saying,

46:55.049 --> 47:00.574
You know, we're not doing it like it's a way to drown you out and try to sort of pacify you is how I see it.

47:00.975 --> 47:08.702
One more anecdotal thing you could add to that is that as far as I know, the only people that were paid in the list of experts is me.

47:08.822 --> 47:10.784
Everybody else was just kind of consulted.

47:11.045 --> 47:15.489
I am the only one that was paid a full time salary for a year and a half as that expert.

47:16.069 --> 47:31.576
all the other paid people are listed as as Working for children's health defense in the paragraph above and he could have put me in that paragraph and it would have been fine, too But he put me in the expert paragraph and I am the only one that he paid for a year and a half To be an expert.

47:31.616 --> 47:34.457
So I find that also a little bit less than anecdotal.

47:34.498 --> 47:44.042
It's more than that Sorry a little more than anecdotal Right, no, that's well, so I mean, you know what you said about

47:45.166 --> 47:47.848
RFK being you know, he's he's a lawyer.

47:47.988 --> 47:48.889
He's a trained lawyer.

47:49.329 --> 47:55.214
He's not dealing with science per se he's dealing with Interests and and he's in politics.

47:55.494 --> 47:56.955
So he's dealing with interests.

47:56.995 --> 48:06.463
He's dealing with advisors so what my my feeling is whatever is the sort of political group

48:07.664 --> 48:30.347
current that he is going with that is going to be the overriding sort of factor in what goes into those decisions and for him to come out in the middle of writing this book when already there are significant resources invested in it you're just one guy and all of these other very very important scientists are

48:30.723 --> 48:36.384
are totally on board is that would take integrity.

48:37.364 --> 48:39.725
And what that shows to me is a lack of integrity.

48:40.165 --> 48:45.786
And I saw the same exact lack of integrity from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:46.526 --> 48:54.528
on Israel-Palestine, where he became, for example, very critical of the Ukraine war and U.S.

48:54.568 --> 48:55.408
involvement there.

48:56.566 --> 49:22.292
When it came to and and actually if you remember the whole episode even with Peter Hotez, I did a piece Okay, Robert F. Kennedy goes on Joe Rogan's podcast to talk about a variety of things including the the kovat shot we can you know get into what that actually is because you you know have a lot to say about that, of course and Peter Hotez this this

49:23.976 --> 49:51.327
this doctor who i researched extensively he was denouncing robert f kennedy junior and joe rogan for promoting anti-science they were dangerous anti-vaxxers joe rogan's podcast rfk challenges him to come on and debate me and peter hotez refused i don't want to legitimize these guys rfk looked very strong and hotez looked very weak you can see what a fraud he is there now when it came

49:51.983 --> 49:54.886
to Israel and Gaza

50:03.544 --> 50:30.376
rfk just did exactly what peter hotez did he said he would debate and then he wouldn't and you could just see that he had no firstly he had no idea what he was talking about and he was just doing politics further his career and to me that just totally discredited him i'd just saw him as a complete political figure had no integrity and was seeking power what week

50:31.196 --> 50:35.077
Who what was he on on whose behalf?

50:35.537 --> 50:36.538
Was he really working?

50:36.818 --> 50:37.278
Who knows?

50:37.398 --> 50:56.043
I didn't know but I could just see this guy is not who he claims to be and just a funny anecdote here, you know, Jeffrey Sachs is one of Robert F. Kennedy jr's best friends and actually one of the the most frequent co-authors of Jeffrey Sachs is the wife of Peter Hotez

50:56.832 --> 50:57.052
Right.

50:57.512 --> 50:59.773
And Jeffrey Sachs is also a big lab lab leak.

50:59.873 --> 51:00.973
He sure is.

51:01.113 --> 51:01.633
Absolutely.

51:02.313 --> 51:04.454
And what I mean, I'm sorry, but you know what?

51:04.974 --> 51:20.257
Jeffrey Sachs is famous for being like one of the architects of shock therapy after the collapse of the Soviet Union, where they basically privatized the former state owned industries in the Soviet Union.

51:21.797 --> 51:26.278
And that killed like millions of Russians and, you know,

51:26.978 --> 51:30.120
Former Soviets, so that is his expertise now.

51:30.160 --> 51:34.003
He apparently has has learned from that He claims to have learned from that.

51:34.383 --> 51:37.865
But why does that make him an expert on?

51:38.526 --> 51:50.173
Lab leak on virology on the you know, it doesn't he just kind of became a face that was out there He was put on I can't remember the name of like the Commission but some kind of Commission to investigate

51:50.253 --> 51:51.893
Yeah, it was the Lancet Commission.

51:51.973 --> 51:57.254
He was the, I mean, that was the, that was the best show ever in 2020, like.

51:57.794 --> 51:58.314
Exactly.

51:58.434 --> 52:18.338
So, so this is, you know, I think people are starting to see this sort of the orchestration of this narrative that what appeared to be these dissident figures coming from kind of different angles and lending their expertise and intellectual weight and prowess to

52:19.538 --> 52:25.521
uh, this narrative that there was no actual scientific basis for it.

52:25.641 --> 52:35.867
And then when Jay Cooey, an unassuming academic biologist who got fired from the University of Pittsburgh for, you know,

52:36.847 --> 52:55.502
for basically maintaining his integrity he's brought into this and he kind of sees uh this like through his experience he saw and experienced firsthand this web of lies and and and unlike most he maintained his integrity so here he is today on this stream with me so um

52:58.231 --> 53:01.193
So now RFK Jr.

53:01.433 --> 53:04.295
is the HHS secretary.

53:05.356 --> 53:18.064
I think, you know, and this is what I said on Redacted, the fact that he basically blew you off, but really tried to pacify you and kind of hand you off, I think in order to avoid

53:19.955 --> 53:48.712
uh... damaging the narrative is what i would suspect damaging the entire thesis of his his book which was very important he tried to pacify you and then you know you eventually fired for as you said criticizing robert malone uh... from children's health defense and uh... and now you know you're doing uh... streams on your channel giga on biological well rfk is this is in the trump administration is a very powerful

53:49.432 --> 53:49.992
position.

53:50.132 --> 54:06.260
And as you said, I mean, that's what I noticed when he, you know, when he didn't say anything about the opioid crisis, which, you know, to not say anything about the public health crisis of our time, of our era, is just incredible.

54:06.401 --> 54:06.721
And then

54:07.557 --> 54:12.141
Think about how much of a checkmate that would have been when somebody threw the measles death at him.

54:12.281 --> 54:18.746
He could have just said, well, I'm concerned about it, but don't forget that 300 kids are going to die of opioids this week.

54:18.986 --> 54:26.432
Like, imagine if he had just dropped that and then continued on with the measles vaccine discussion, how bombastic that would have been.

54:27.105 --> 54:28.026
Right, exactly.

54:28.086 --> 54:36.577
And then he puts out this statement saying that actually anti-Semitism is the public health crisis that's coming from our woke universities.

54:36.617 --> 54:39.701
And I'm just like, this guy is just faker than fake.

54:39.741 --> 54:41.683
There is nothing real about him.

54:43.125 --> 54:45.307
And I hate to say that because, you know, I

54:46.128 --> 54:57.003
I even would go so far as Dennis Kucinich had this exact experience as his campaign manager when he spoke out and Dennis just dropped off like he was done that quick.

54:57.904 --> 54:58.065
Right.

54:59.306 --> 55:13.388
So, yeah, I mean, I I covered in twenty twenty one, I think the defeat the mandates rally here in D.C., which now I see is very much kind of a controlled opposition event.

55:14.169 --> 55:16.809
And but RFK spoke there and.

55:16.829 --> 55:27.731
I actually really loved what he had to say, he said he talked about tyranny and and he said basically

55:30.074 --> 55:36.300
the technology that governments have now to control people's lives.

55:37.320 --> 55:44.126
You know, the Nazis didn't have they would have dreamed of having that totalitarian regimes of the past.

55:44.186 --> 55:45.728
And I actually thought that was pretty good.

55:46.128 --> 55:55.656
I was pretty inspired by that statement because the way that, you know, social media and like so many basically social

55:56.795 --> 56:25.196
control for methods and forms that to control a population exists that didn't exist before whether it's tracking through your cell phones are you know comp they're just so many different ways and it's true that those did not exist you know seventy years ago and so i was like that guy i'd really like to reset i wish he'd run for president and then i see you know later that he he does that it's actually he doesn't have any integrity so i mean when i saw him say that and then i see him come out is like pro-israel

56:27.180 --> 56:28.461
All I could think of was Gaza.

56:28.621 --> 56:45.368
When you're talking about totalitarianism and living in some, where every freedom and liberty has been stripped away from you, and you're living in a dystopia, I mean, the Gaza Strip is the picture of that, where you have millions of people, most of whom are children,

56:45.908 --> 57:02.798
living in a tiny bombed-out ghetto surrounded by a high-tech, a series of high-tech walls and fences with remote-controlled machine guns overlooking them that open fire on people based on their gait, the way that they walk.

57:02.918 --> 57:04.559
If they walk suspicious, they get opened.

57:04.999 --> 57:10.522
And I'm like, so this guy who's talking about tyranny in the biosecurity state is in support of that?

57:12.123 --> 57:26.131
Well, I would challenge the listeners to recall that Israel was the example, in my humble opinion, of what they want to do with the rest of the world and especially the United States.

57:26.211 --> 57:32.695
They want to have a medical system that is completely open and they have all access to all the data.

57:33.195 --> 57:36.639
and they want to be able to mandate whatever they want, and that's what they did in Israel.

57:36.679 --> 57:41.103
Remember, they were the lab of Pfizer, they said that out loud.

57:41.123 --> 57:45.448
A Pfizer executive said that, a sort of laboratory for what Israel is.

57:46.069 --> 57:50.794
And I would argue that in the United States that's essentially what is now happening

57:51.434 --> 58:02.321
over a course of many years, the inversion of our sense of sovereignty in our kids to a sense of duty to the state and what we owe the state.

58:02.882 --> 58:09.006
And that will include the fact that, how can I say it?

58:10.416 --> 58:11.497
without going too deep.

58:12.617 --> 58:16.960
You know, they have wanted this data collection for a very long time.

58:17.000 --> 58:24.745
I think one of the things that really frustrates me about the big narratives that people talk about on the internet is this depopulation idea, because it's not depopulation.

58:24.825 --> 58:30.388
Depopulation, the population of the earth is going to decrease because we aren't replacing ourselves.

58:30.428 --> 58:32.189
That's already guaranteed.

58:32.270 --> 58:33.851
So they don't need to kill us off.

58:33.951 --> 58:36.032
We're going to, the population is going to go down.

58:36.572 --> 58:38.974
The question is, what are they going to do with this data?

58:39.034 --> 58:39.334
And that's,

58:40.200 --> 59:01.072
That's the kind of bigger picture where the FDA is important and the CDC and its perception is important and health and human services and the control of it is very important because during this transition out of traditional FDA regulating safe and effective and regulating the labels of products, they need to transition to

59:02.292 --> 59:29.280
What people have been looking at is personalized medicine and I think in a lot of ways already Israel was probably way ahead on that and is way ahead on that with Cancer treatments and this kind of stuff and they're proud of it, but it is a result of having access to all data in a military fashion and and I think that from a 30,000 foot perspective we need to see this as a

59:30.541 --> 59:34.123
a repositioning of that control in America.

59:34.163 --> 59:40.806
And so I don't know the details of it, but I do know that the play here is not a health freedom movement.

59:40.846 --> 59:46.509
The play is to change or alter the way that we

59:48.479 --> 59:52.940
the way their health care system works, the way the FDA works, what power is there or not there.

59:52.980 --> 59:58.981
And so that's why I think from the very beginning, one of the red threads that runs through this is the FDA was in the way.

59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.241
It's the FDA's fault.

01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:10.784
The FDA stopped us from using repurposed drugs, or the FDA held back this or did that or the other, and they let food dyes in, and the FDA is responsible for that.

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:12.164
It's always the FDA.

01:00:12.224 --> 01:00:16.265
And that more and more starts to be something that

01:00:17.285 --> 01:00:19.366
Every time I hear it, it rings a bell in my head.

01:00:19.426 --> 01:00:24.270
Again, because this history goes all the way back to when the FDA was formed.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:28.652
It was formed around this narrative of thalidomide.

01:00:28.852 --> 01:00:34.916
It was formed around this control of products, the regulation of products.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:40.340
And there's a lot of interesting characters in American history at that time, including Senator Kefauver, who

01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:57.815
If you follow and look at the history of that guy and his ideas and how he was contributing to the formation of what is now the FDA, it is a very curious American history that I think cannot be dismissed as independent from this.

01:00:57.975 --> 01:00:59.276
It's a continual thing.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.419
I mean, if we just think of it as

01:01:03.883 --> 01:01:13.693
I used to be very naive about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but now I understand him differently, or I think I understand him differently, simply because I can now assume

01:01:14.628 --> 01:01:27.355
that from the moment that his father was killed, there were interests that were taking an interest in him and grooming him and positioning him, even if it would be just to make sure he didn't cause any trouble.

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:31.897
But more importantly, I think it would be potentially to use him in the future.

01:01:32.197 --> 01:01:35.399
And I think ultimately, because

01:01:37.188 --> 01:01:49.115
He is the victim of probably one of the greatest Truman shows ever done in American history that, you know, he's even the people that he trusts are probably not all trustworthy.

01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:52.757
And so it's just, it's, I don't have any explanations.

01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:54.439
I don't have any quick fixes.

01:01:54.519 --> 01:02:03.104
I just know that, you know, he's not a guy who writes a lot of books and, and, and, and trains Falcons and, and is fighting for America's health.

01:02:03.164 --> 01:02:04.024
It's not that simple.

01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:05.045
Let's say it like that.

01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:15.787
Yeah, no, I think it's actually a pretty profound way of looking at him as like the ultimate Truman show.

01:02:15.867 --> 01:02:18.190
And yeah, since he was a kid, been

01:02:21.499 --> 01:02:34.345
I don't know if I want to say groomed, but yeah, taken or influenced by all kinds of different people, different powerful figures, this kind of thing.

01:02:34.825 --> 01:02:50.492
I mean, I would even challenge people to look into the fact that, you know, in 2018, when the World Mercury Project changed its name to Children's Health Defense, he has often confessed on camera that he was reluctant to take on that cause.

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:53.314
He was happy with his environmental work.

01:02:53.434 --> 01:02:54.855
He was happy with what he was doing.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:57.317
He was making a lot of progress.

01:02:57.537 --> 01:03:01.541
And this, in the end, is part of the reason why I understand him differently.

01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:10.548
Because one of the awakenings that I've had with regard to working with Children's Health Defense and that is that I started at the beginning of the pandemic

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:23.028
not understanding that what I understand now, which is essentially, I don't, I think that we should be advocating for no intramuscular injection in children.

01:03:23.568 --> 01:03:31.874
And that's a very different position than I was in before when I started the book or when I was talking about LabLeak or when I was riding my bicycle on YouTube.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:38.479
And so I'm very, I want your readers to understand, or your listeners to understand that I'm incredibly humble when I,

01:03:39.676 --> 01:03:42.959
when I say that I think I can make these arguments.

01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:48.384
And I'm not the first person who has successfully tried to make these arguments and then been ignored.

01:03:48.504 --> 01:03:56.491
And that's the part that also makes me feel better about the task at hand, because I do think it is a worthy argument.

01:03:56.891 --> 01:04:04.718
I think that the evidence is more than sufficient to suggest that a lot of this stuff has been smoke and mirrors for a few decades.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.539
And that's frustrating for a lot of people.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.842
But, you know, it's not a message for everyone.

01:04:10.882 --> 01:04:17.906
I say this a lot now, this is actually a friend of mine's phrase, but it's not a message for everyone, but it is a message that anyone can absorb.

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:21.849
And I think your message about Zionism is very much like that.

01:04:21.889 --> 01:04:26.872
It's not a message for everyone, because not everyone's ready to hear it, but it is anyone.

01:04:27.032 --> 01:04:31.995
Anyone can absorb it and then understand that in a different way.

01:04:33.676 --> 01:04:35.397
Um, that's what makes me optimistic.

01:04:35.457 --> 01:04:41.880
I don't, I don't think in the end, it's going to be about the adults that voted for Donald Trump and whether or not they figure it out.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:53.605
It's going to be whether our kids grow up with the, the critical thinking skills and the skepticism and the foundational history that they can move forward without being enslaved by mythologies.

01:04:53.665 --> 01:04:58.927
Like we were, um, you know, we inherited a lot of this from our parents and, uh, they didn't know either.

01:05:00.088 --> 01:05:00.328
Yeah.

01:05:01.389 --> 01:05:02.289
Well, let me, I want to,

01:05:03.376 --> 01:05:14.230
kind of talk about what is the real, and I mean, you touched on this, and I think it's a huge question we could discuss at length for hours and hours.

01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:21.700
But I want to at least try to do some broad strokes on what is the real, well, OK.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.241
There's two things I want to point out.

01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:29.263
So the question is, what is the real purpose for basically staging a pandemic?

01:05:29.623 --> 01:05:47.391
And I want to say that, you know, I mean, my proof that there was no pandemic personally, what I can prove is just looking at the way the narrative was curated both sides all along by the exact same spook

01:05:47.991 --> 01:06:02.807
a regime change outlets and propaganda organs that I've been watching for years and it's the evidence was just so overwhelming that it was like I'm about nine without any of the biology that you that

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:10.651
you present, Jay, I'm like 99.99% sure this is phony, and is a distraction.

01:06:11.192 --> 01:06:27.015
And so then when I came to you, and you're like, well, I can, you know, basically teach you the biology or, you know, you do these, these lessons, basically, what are what are biology lessons on your streams on your site, which I really, you know, recommend, I mean, we're not going to do that here.

01:06:27.055 --> 01:06:28.275
But I recommend people go

01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:37.564
watch Jay lay out the arguments that he's presenting in detail, because, you know, we're doing again, we're doing kind of broad strokes here.

01:06:38.184 --> 01:06:39.464
This is more conversational.

01:06:39.524 --> 01:06:48.247
But Jake, who he is, is his character, his nature, his personality is a teacher and is, I guess, training.

01:06:48.747 --> 01:06:55.349
And so I really encourage people to just go spend time listening to these and then listen to it again and again.

01:06:55.369 --> 01:06:56.610
And it may be the kind of thing that

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:02.434
You know, like for me, there's sometimes when I listen to it and I only catch like 50 percent of what he's saying.

01:07:02.515 --> 01:07:06.738
But then I go to sleep and the next day, certain parts of it crystallize in my brain.

01:07:06.798 --> 01:07:08.099
I go back and watch something else.

01:07:08.219 --> 01:07:09.220
You know, that's the kind of thing.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:18.428
And that's what that's an important part of, I think, being a good student is that you have to go really learn the material for yourself.

01:07:18.548 --> 01:07:20.770
And a teacher is kind of a guide.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:20.830
So

01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:29.910
So so I mean, another another thing that I think is really important to point out is.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:44.078
A lot of people think that the that there was a virus, but it just wasn't very deadly and it was overstated how deadly it was and.

01:07:45.009 --> 01:07:56.392
Those people, I think, often look at you or I or the idea that we present that there actually was no pandemic as like a step too far that we're crazy.

01:07:57.052 --> 01:08:06.695
But if the analogy that I like to use is it's as if someone yelled fire in a crowded theater.

01:08:07.535 --> 01:08:10.616
And we all agree that that happened.

01:08:11.499 --> 01:08:38.380
that it wasn't actually, well, at least all the people who call themselves skeptics, I should say, all agree that that happened, that the danger of what was supposedly there was overstated and that the countermeasures imposed to stop the supposed fire or the supposed virus spreading all over were responsible for the majority of the damage, of the deaths, of the harm.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:51.486
And so, so the only question, if people, you know, say, like, a lot of people would agree that 90%, say, or 95%, you know, people had comorbidities.

01:08:51.566 --> 01:08:53.126
So that's what they actually died from.

01:08:53.186 --> 01:08:54.487
This is like what a lot of people say.

01:08:55.262 --> 01:08:57.244
They are very close to our position.

01:08:57.444 --> 01:09:05.290
Actually, the only real difference is, was there a so most of those people didn't actually die from covid.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:06.391
They died with covid.

01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:07.611
That's what a lot of people think.

01:09:07.631 --> 01:09:08.993
That's what I thought for a long time.

01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:13.956
That was what the death certificate thing showed me, because I saw how they were faking death certificates.

01:09:14.056 --> 01:09:20.842
And I was like, well, if you take these death certificates, we're just if you just stick covid on a death certificate anywhere, then it's a covid death.

01:09:21.922 --> 01:09:33.271
which that's not how you calculate a COVID death, even if you just take the original way, the normal way of counting, of writing a death certificate and apply that,

01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:41.615
to COVID, then like 93 percent of those deaths are not from COVID, just by that standard.

01:09:41.796 --> 01:09:47.579
OK, so the vast majority of the skeptics, we can all agree on that.

01:09:47.839 --> 01:10:02.968
The only real difference is, well, was there someone when they shouted fire, was there someone who flicked a lighter or turned on a little blowtorch or was there literally nothing and they just shouted fire anyway?

01:10:03.857 --> 01:10:07.399
Um, you and I say there actually was no fire.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:12.823
That's versus someone else says there was somebody flicked a lighter.

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:14.844
That's the only real difference.

01:10:15.505 --> 01:10:20.628
And some people will say, well, it doesn't really matter because it wouldn't have justified all of those countermeasures anyway.

01:10:21.209 --> 01:10:21.409
But.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:27.993
You and I and maybe you can, you know, well, I would say, yeah, go ahead.

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:31.556
I would be careful because I think there was a fire.

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:53.689
I think that there was a fire in the sense of the population pyramids predicted that there would be more all-cause mortality in the next five to ten years Than there was in the past and that it was going to almost double This is the same reason why they think Social Security is going to go bankrupt the reason why they don't they can't afford Medicare in the future is because there are a

01:10:54.912 --> 01:11:04.218
The population pyramid has more old people than it's ever had before, and they're living longer than they ever have before, and it costs more money to keep them alive than it ever has before.

01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:08.000
And so this is all a contradictory problem here.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.183
And so they knew that there were going to be more people in hospitals.

01:11:13.174 --> 01:11:16.419
There were new that there were going to be more people dying in the coming years.

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:23.249
Now, the question was, could they murder enough people to make sharp enough peaks so that they could call it a disease?

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:24.451
Because that's what it is.

01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:25.593
So in your theater.

01:11:26.947 --> 01:11:35.129
analogy, they're telling you that the town is burning down, we have to get out of here, it's a natural thing, it's like a forest fire.

01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:50.574
And other people are telling you, no, no, no, it's because they used the wrong light bulb in the projector and so the projector is exploding, when in reality, a couple people in the back row started a few people on fire and then said, oh my gosh, the projector did it.

01:11:51.678 --> 01:11:53.700
And in reality, the projector can't do it.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.662
There's no forest fire outside.

01:11:56.802 --> 01:11:57.563
It's not coming.

01:11:58.904 --> 01:12:02.707
And only forest fires that matter are the ones that are started by people.

01:12:02.787 --> 01:12:10.333
So again, it becomes this issue of the argument, this is why I called it the Scooby-Doo, the argument of

01:12:11.475 --> 01:12:17.801
And the debate about whether it's natural or a lab leak presupposes that an RNA can do this.

01:12:18.141 --> 01:12:21.404
And it presupposes that this phenomenon is always happening.

01:12:22.645 --> 01:12:24.767
And that is a very

01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:38.724
It's a very malevolent trap because even as an academic biologist, you can start with that assumption and read and read and read and read and learn and learn and learn and it'll all be based on that assumption.

01:12:39.165 --> 01:12:40.827
And it'll all confirm that assumption.

01:12:40.887 --> 01:12:43.049
It'll all seem to not challenge that assumption.

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:53.219
And much of virology literature will never allow you to escape because they don't write any clues as to their own known limitations of what they're doing.

01:12:53.259 --> 01:12:58.124
They just go along with that assumption that this phenomenon is real over there.

01:12:58.224 --> 01:13:01.066
And so what we do in the lab kind of recapitulates it.

01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:16.403
You know, I was aware that we do this with with disease models in mice, for example, you know, there's people that talk about autistic models of models of autism in mice, and it's just absurd because they're not autism models, their models where

01:13:18.225 --> 01:13:28.467
some aspect of the disease is recapitulated in the mice, and then they try to cure that aspect of the mouse's behavior and call that a correlate or call that a mouse model.

01:13:28.607 --> 01:13:32.988
And I was aware of how that science is done in the context of the brain.

01:13:33.028 --> 01:13:41.129
I just wasn't aware that they were doing it all over the place, especially in the realm of biosecurity and vaccines and infectious disease.

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:43.790
I didn't know it until I learned it.

01:13:46.716 --> 01:13:52.643
So I guess the million dollar question and this is part of this is I mean, you've been you've been touching on it.

01:13:53.624 --> 01:13:59.710
What is the purpose of I mean, this is what you just talked about with population pyramids and the FDA.

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.933
But like if you could kind of distill down.

01:14:03.536 --> 01:14:04.457
What is the purpose?

01:14:04.557 --> 01:14:10.020
Because I mean, OK, we saw, for example, the greatest upward transfer of wealth in human history.

01:14:11.021 --> 01:14:15.644
We saw the growth of Silicon Valley billionaires.

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:18.626
I think Elon Musk's wealth like doubled, something like that.

01:14:18.686 --> 01:14:33.256
Jeff Bezos had you know, you saw the what's often called the controlled demolition of our economy, which I think is correct, where countless small businesses were forced to close down because they were locked down and

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.532
you know, they could not

01:14:36.077 --> 01:14:43.083
afford to close down for a period of time, whereas Amazon is perfectly happy to, or everyone's just ordering online.

01:14:43.383 --> 01:14:51.709
Or even worse, even worse, those little businesses didn't know that they could apply for pandemic loans and that the loans would have been forgiven.

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.053
I think a lot of those businesses had so much integrity that they didn't borrow.

01:14:57.513 --> 01:14:58.354
They wouldn't borrow.

01:14:58.394 --> 01:14:59.595
They were afraid to borrow.

01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:03.558
But lots of people borrowed millions of dollars and then it got forgiven.

01:15:03.798 --> 01:15:04.839
It's remarkable.

01:15:05.939 --> 01:15:11.880
I mean, you know, like everything is is it was a very antisocial event, everything.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.582
You know, when someone delivers food now, they just come to your door and they and they leave it, you know, and it's a safety thing.

01:15:17.622 --> 01:15:23.743
When I go to get gas, it's you know, these are like somehow sanitized or it's all touch free.

01:15:23.923 --> 01:15:26.064
Everything's more and more done through your phone.

01:15:26.484 --> 01:15:30.245
When you go to a restaurant, you don't have a server come and ask you for your order.

01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:32.705
Now you have a QR code where you order.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.046
So is this like restructuring of

01:15:35.726 --> 01:15:47.057
society in so many ways that I think it's essential for people to understand that, you know, to ask the question, what is the real?

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:53.543
Yeah, well, then we can start right with where you left off with Israel as a model and make no mistake about it.

01:15:53.844 --> 01:15:57.888
One of the first things that Donald Trump announced was a half a billion dollars for A.I.

01:15:57.948 --> 01:15:59.649
that would be applied to medical records.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:04.333
and medical data, and they were all excited about it with the guy from Google.

01:16:04.373 --> 01:16:05.694
That's not an accident.

01:16:06.815 --> 01:16:16.722
What I would challenge your listeners to understand from my perspective is that as far back as a guy by the name of Joshua Lederberg,

01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:24.470
deep thinkers about biology and about humankind in general, and the human species going forward.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:25.431
Like what decade?

01:16:25.771 --> 01:16:26.952
When are we talking about?

01:16:27.152 --> 01:16:29.234
1950's and 60's, all the way up until now.

01:16:29.254 --> 01:16:31.996
I mean, he was a very young Nobel Prize winner.

01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:35.880
He was like a Doogie Howser of his day, if you will.

01:16:37.821 --> 01:16:43.263
Joshua Lederberg is the guy who coined the phrase microbiome and a bunch of other phrases.

01:16:44.504 --> 01:16:48.846
Joshua Lederberg is quoted at the beginning of one of these movies, Contagion or something like that.

01:16:49.566 --> 01:17:04.593
He's a big thinker and he was the first guy to already say that the only way that we would ever solve human biology or start to really make great strides is when we started to use computers to

01:17:05.493 --> 01:17:09.155
interpret the genetic code and understand it.

01:17:09.295 --> 01:17:19.259
And I would again remind your viewers that the way that machine learning, don't call it artificial intelligence, that's just dumb.

01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:21.060
The way that machine learning

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:42.494
Solves these kinds of complex problems like chess or go is through many many reiterations And then finding patterns within that those many many reiterations Which is in reality also how the human brain does it it's just you're not really conscious of that process whereas in a computer it can be programmed and

01:17:42.714 --> 01:17:50.184
And so although you can't open the lid, these kinds of problems can be solved, but they are solved through iteration.

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:58.396
And if people could just step back and realize that in the context of the human genome, an iteration is a person.

01:17:59.537 --> 01:18:06.327
The genome of a human is a single game of chess expressed over the lifetime of a human.

01:18:06.888 --> 01:18:14.359
And so you need as many of those things as possible before you're ever going to be able to solve the big problem of how does the

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.101
How does the genome work?

01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:23.109
And they've understood this from the perspective of mice and rats and all this other stuff and the sequencing of these animals.

01:18:23.549 --> 01:18:30.937
That's one of the reasons why we still work on inbred mouse strains because they are genetically identical and so we remove

01:18:31.909 --> 01:18:38.554
the gigantic variable, which is the wonderful diversity of a normal natural species.

01:18:38.634 --> 01:18:45.219
Now, the diversity of people and genomes available now on the Earth is never going to be this high again.

01:18:45.779 --> 01:18:53.625
If you just look at the population pyramids and project into the future, we are going to go from 10 billion to 2 billion, whether you like it or not.

01:18:53.825 --> 01:18:55.427
If we want to go back to 10 billion,

01:18:56.207 --> 01:18:59.133
And once we get down to 2 billion, we're gonna have to have more babies.

01:18:59.213 --> 01:19:00.255
Like, that's the way it works.

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:03.141
And we're not having those babies right now, and we haven't for a while.

01:19:03.722 --> 01:19:07.008
And so the population is gonna go down, and the people that rule...

01:19:08.302 --> 01:19:14.524
the overclass, the people that really run the show, you know, at insurance companies and hedge funds, they know this.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:17.705
They've known this for decades already, that this was gonna happen.

01:19:18.205 --> 01:19:30.408
And they have used this as a kind of eclipse, you know, to fool the natives into believing that something else happened and that they're in control or that they have powers that the average guy doesn't have.

01:19:30.448 --> 01:19:33.929
You know, like they can make gaiter function viruses and they can go around the world.

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:36.070
This is all part of an illusion

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:56.116
that was created with murder, lies, and an existing biological phenomenon that can't be dismissed, which is this population pyramid where there's going to be a lot of people dying and there's going to be a lot of people in hospitals and a lot of pneumonia in the coming decade.

01:19:56.156 --> 01:19:57.136
That's just the way it is.

01:19:58.857 --> 01:20:04.621
They are taking advantage of it to teach a mythology to our children so that those children can be trapped in it.

01:20:04.681 --> 01:20:05.622
That's the way I see it.

01:20:06.182 --> 01:20:09.744
And I think a lot of these people that are involved are pawns.

01:20:09.824 --> 01:20:15.048
They are surrounded by people who understand this, but many of the people don't understand.

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:32.804
So the ultimate goal is, you've said, to they they claim there's basically they'll be able to understand the human genome, which would do which would allow them to do what?

01:20:33.024 --> 01:20:39.608
Engineer an end to disease, engineer better humans than ever before.

01:20:39.688 --> 01:20:44.291
Take control of evolution of the species is what they've talked about for a long time.

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:48.195
So it's like a eugenicist.

01:20:48.435 --> 01:20:49.435
Oh, it absolutely is.

01:20:49.475 --> 01:20:56.519
And that's why I think, you know, somebody like Jamie Metzl is a very curious person to mention, because Jamie Metzl is considers himself a futurist.

01:20:56.539 --> 01:21:01.441
He believes in all of this, you know, human augmentation and implantation and stuff like that.

01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:02.022
He's very big.

01:21:02.062 --> 01:21:06.984
I mean, is there any aside from the ethical considerations of which are great?

01:21:07.824 --> 01:21:11.987
Is there any truth to this or are they is are they nonsense?

01:21:12.047 --> 01:21:12.747
Is this nonsense?

01:21:13.627 --> 01:21:27.156
I mean, it would be terribly naive of me to claim that I understand the limits of the computer technology available and the limits of the sequencing technology available.

01:21:27.636 --> 01:21:35.100
In fact, my guess is that they do have the technology to sequence everybody and keep sequencing everybody.

01:21:35.361 --> 01:21:38.703
And that's one of the reasons why none of these people will ever

01:21:39.804 --> 01:21:46.347
discuss, I think you were aware of this, we didn't really touch on it, but one of the central pillars of the illusion is a PCR test.

01:21:46.567 --> 01:21:50.189
And the PCR test is effectively just on the table now.

01:21:50.289 --> 01:21:53.591
It's used in every hospital for a wide variety of things.

01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:56.532
They can identify anything they want with PCR.

01:21:56.672 --> 01:22:01.594
And if you think very specifically about that, that is a medical device.

01:22:01.915 --> 01:22:02.535
And each

01:22:04.053 --> 01:22:20.606
Each reiteration of it should be a medical device regulated by the FDA, but somehow or another, PCR testing has now become ubiquitous and they don't, there's no, who's regulating this?

01:22:20.807 --> 01:22:22.708
Who's approving all of these things?

01:22:22.768 --> 01:22:25.310
It's all just, it's just all gone.

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:26.791
It's just all being applied.

01:22:26.911 --> 01:22:33.237
And now what I would, again, I'm gonna try and get as much out there as I can, challenge your listeners to understand

01:22:33.937 --> 01:22:36.039
is that medical remnants are real.

01:22:36.779 --> 01:22:43.704
They sell the foreskin of babies in America still because it's necessary for cell culture and fibroblast cell culture.

01:22:43.744 --> 01:22:55.653
They still sell the placentas from births in our hospitals and they sell the placentas from cesarean section for much higher prices.

01:22:55.873 --> 01:22:58.435
And these are real remnant streams.

01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:01.698
And what I need you to understand is that one thing that was established

01:23:02.498 --> 01:23:11.381
in the course of the pandemic was a remnant stream of PCR swabs, which will have everybody's DNA in it and some DNA from their microbiome.

01:23:11.941 --> 01:23:28.287
And if we think back to 2020 and 2021, when we were all locked down and all on our phones, no adults stood up to protect the college kids from this gross invasion of privacy for two years, where they had to swab whatever the university told them to swab.

01:23:28.747 --> 01:23:32.628
And a lot of these universities were selling those remnants to the highest bidder.

01:23:33.168 --> 01:23:35.129
And this is still going on today.

01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:40.010
It has to be because that's the data that they will feed into the AI.

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:48.992
In other words, and stop me if I'm rambling, but one of the things that I've heard people say is that, well, yeah, but if they don't know,

01:23:49.764 --> 01:24:11.375
what your name is when they swab you, and they don't know your, and the medical records are all de-identified, then how could they ever, well, the whole reason why they're setting up the AI thing is so that they can take a de-identified gene sample and use AI to connect it to the most likely database record, their medical record.

01:24:11.555 --> 01:24:16.178
And once they have that problem figured out, de-identified, records don't matter anymore.

01:24:16.638 --> 01:24:25.627
because they can take your DNA and they can sufficiently read it so that they can predict that you're your race, your relative height, you know, whatever.

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:30.192
And then if they already know that they took it from this university, now they have it down to 3000 men.

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:34.316
And then if they take it on that date, then they have it down to, they will do this.

01:24:35.413 --> 01:24:37.755
in order to break the de-identification.

01:24:37.795 --> 01:24:42.158
Because since the Human Genome Project started, they have been admitting it.

01:24:42.359 --> 01:24:46.101
Every time they announce a new achievement, they say, well, now we need more genomes.

01:24:46.602 --> 01:24:48.443
Now we need more people to volunteer.

01:24:48.523 --> 01:24:49.944
Now we need more volunteers.

01:24:49.985 --> 01:24:53.948
And the reason why they need more volunteers is because they need more games of Go.

01:24:54.448 --> 01:24:55.869
They need more games of chess.

01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:58.851
And they are now going to brute force it.

01:24:59.132 --> 01:25:01.734
They want our children to be all in on this.

01:25:01.814 --> 01:25:04.176
They want them to be in from the very beginning.

01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:18.274
And I think that that's the reason why it's, it's, it's critical to gain control of HHS and, and, and FDA and CDC and make sure that they steer that cruise ship where they want it to go.

01:25:18.334 --> 01:25:29.497
Because if the illusion is broken and the whole vaccine schedule, as I see it in America is exposed as a criminal enterprise, then they have a very big problem on their hands.

01:25:29.938 --> 01:25:31.438
Because that's a, that's a,

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:33.715
That's a, how do you say it?

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.457
It doesn't matter what team you cheer for.

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.518
That's a pretty big message.

01:25:40.317 --> 01:25:47.683
I mean, there's so much I don't know, we could we could we could I think we could go on for for hours and hours.

01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:50.385
Maybe we should maybe we should leave it there.

01:25:50.405 --> 01:25:54.609
I don't know if there are any other key messages, key points you want to get across, but.

01:25:55.289 --> 01:25:55.850
Well, for sure.

01:25:56.050 --> 01:26:04.416
You know, there's a lot of little tricks that everybody I want to emphasize one more time that the pandemic couldn't happen unless people people died.

01:26:05.677 --> 01:26:09.238
And so I am not ever arguing that people didn't die.

01:26:09.359 --> 01:26:24.464
One of the things that, you know, one short anecdote that I would really, not anecdote, but important point to mention for anybody listening is that if any of your relatives or you yourself went to the hospital and experienced hospital COVID,

01:26:25.219 --> 01:26:35.749
The very first thing you need to ask yourself or the very first thing you need to look in your relative's medical records is when or if they applied supplementary oxygen and precisely how they did it.

01:26:36.409 --> 01:26:47.519
Because one of the ground truths of the murder in America is that the willy-nilly application of supplementary oxygen

01:26:49.039 --> 01:26:56.981
can result in precisely the condition that they say is what a SARS virus does, which is acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:12.545
Acute respiratory distress syndrome originally applied to people who were damaged from the oxygen toxicity in the ICU, and then later was applied to the same syndrome that SARS, the first virus, caused.

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:13.305
So,

01:27:14.232 --> 01:27:33.858
It's important for people to understand that there are doctors all around the United States who could have read this in a textbook or could have looked at any of the papers that were published in the 90s and the 2000s about oxygen toxicity and how this can result in extremely acute damage within an hour or two.

01:27:35.358 --> 01:27:42.961
I find it frightening, for example, that they are publicly saying that they are giving high flow supplementary oxygen to the Pope right now.

01:27:43.621 --> 01:27:54.636
Because if you look at the literature, there is no support for that treatment being a good treatment, and yet it's in a headlight right now.

01:27:54.716 --> 01:27:58.581
So I don't really understand what's going on, except that for sure,

01:27:59.898 --> 01:28:15.009
The few ICU doctors that I've talked to that I feel have been honest were absolutely clear that pure oxygen is not something that you can just put on at 60 liters a minute and put somebody in the hallway and come back two hours later or they'll be sick.

01:28:15.989 --> 01:28:23.117
And the pneumonia that gets caused by the application of supplementary oxygen over several days is not viral.

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:24.198
It's bacterial.

01:28:24.718 --> 01:28:28.763
And so if you don't treat those people with antibiotics, you are killing them.

01:28:29.263 --> 01:28:31.405
And this is the kind of murder that I'm talking about.

01:28:31.445 --> 01:28:33.368
The other kind of murder that I'm talking about is

01:28:34.068 --> 01:28:45.578
is the opioid crisis in America that killed 100,000 Americans every year for five years that were all younger than retirement age, or the vast majority of them were.

01:28:45.638 --> 01:28:51.202
And in fact, is the reason why the life expectancy in America has gone down.

01:28:51.262 --> 01:28:57.568
And these people for the last five years have been telling us that life expectancy is going down because of COVID, and that's not true.

01:28:58.522 --> 01:29:04.185
So these are some very basic math that everybody needs to do in their head.

01:29:04.225 --> 01:29:23.076
And then once you do that, the other thing maybe for most people that are still spellbound, you have to realize that if you can't remember another time in your life as an adult when you were this sick, then all that means is that you were hardcore.

01:29:24.045 --> 01:29:27.907
All that means is that when you were sick, you went to work just like every other American did.

01:29:28.167 --> 01:29:32.970
All that means is that when you were sick before, you blew it off or you tried to work through it or push through it.

01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:51.160
And this time, when the TV told you for six months that something deadly and terrible and contagious and awful, and it would be irresponsible for you to not take everything seriously, now even the lightest symptoms could result in you thinking that you're participating in this show.

01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:55.022
And it's hard for people to accept that.

01:29:55.122 --> 01:30:00.605
But I don't remember another flu, except for the flu that I had in 2019.

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:03.566
And I think the reason why is because the TV told me to remember it.

01:30:04.087 --> 01:30:06.288
The TV told me that it was something significant.

01:30:06.328 --> 01:30:12.871
But if I'm really honest, and my wife was always the one who did this for me, but yeah, but you get sick like this every winter.

01:30:13.711 --> 01:30:16.473
Every winter since you've been riding your bike, you would get sick like this.

01:30:16.513 --> 01:30:17.853
And you complain about the same thing.

01:30:17.893 --> 01:30:18.814
It's not any different.

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:21.115
And it's not, except the TV told me it was.

01:30:22.091 --> 01:30:28.955
And I think a lot of people underestimate that if you only have the flu every five years, you aren't keeping track of it.

01:30:29.455 --> 01:30:36.919
And until the TV told you it was significant, your sickness or whatever you had was, it's just an imaginary thing.

01:30:37.019 --> 01:30:40.741
It's horrible, but it's also simply simple.

01:30:41.142 --> 01:30:41.922
It's really simple.

01:30:43.303 --> 01:30:46.445
You can't underestimate how spending all day on a screen

01:30:47.226 --> 01:30:52.057
Listening to these people and their stories could have led you to believe something that is not true.

01:30:56.627 --> 01:31:23.247
even i forget the incredible psychological pressure that we were put under in that period where again they're literal panics uh... you couldn't get toilet paper you couldn't get water you couldn't get bleach you couldn't get lights all it any store you know if you were if your neighbor came within several feet of you people would freak out i mean d we were told that every single person

01:31:24.088 --> 01:31:25.688
is a potential threat.

01:31:26.008 --> 01:31:28.409
It is the most anti-social concept.

01:31:28.489 --> 01:31:30.350
It's the most dystopian thing possible.

01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.590
So.

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.591
So, of course, there is going to be some psychosomatic element.

01:31:35.831 --> 01:31:43.793
I mean, I you know, when I was looking at all the death certificates, I found so many crazy cases where, for example,

01:31:44.813 --> 01:31:47.395
of basically death by fear propaganda.

01:31:47.775 --> 01:31:59.503
For example, there were several medical professionals, especially nurses, who committed suicide thinking after they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:02.886
They thought they got the virus and they killed themselves.

01:32:03.386 --> 01:32:10.291
There was a man in, I believe in the Bronx, he was in New York City, I think the Bronx, who was diabetic.

01:32:11.111 --> 01:32:19.056
And he tested positive for for covid.

01:32:19.736 --> 01:32:31.303
And he called the police late at night and said there is a shooter in the street and the police sent squad cars, guns blazing.

01:32:31.923 --> 01:32:34.264
And he took like a Civil War era

01:32:35.665 --> 01:32:51.053
uh, firearm, like a revolver and some like old samurai sword and went out in the street and charged at the police and they shot him and and wounded him and he and there's video of him laying on the ground begging the cops to finish him off.

01:32:51.893 --> 01:32:54.296
And they didn't kill him right there.

01:32:54.336 --> 01:32:56.238
He went to the hospital and died later.

01:32:56.338 --> 01:33:04.025
But he was so terrified of because he was like an overweight diabetic guy and he got the virus.

01:33:04.085 --> 01:33:05.627
So he wanted to die.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.709
He was so consumed by fear.

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:14.075
And that is the level of propaganda that we were subjected to, which should make people furious.

01:33:14.135 --> 01:33:14.395
Yes.

01:33:15.316 --> 01:33:23.630
the corporate media at the media talking heads who told us who spread that fear to kill Americans, to kill all kinds of people.

01:33:23.811 --> 01:33:27.337
I've come to understand that they put people on social media to do it, too, dude.

01:33:27.915 --> 01:33:53.470
definitely absolutely doesn't there's no doubt i have no doubt about it i mean it's not you know people understand that there is an alternative media so you know we know what operation mockingbird is in all these kinds of things do you think that you know the cia or whatever the deep state would not infiltrate social media which is created by which i really really military programs fundamentally like of course it's so curated the amount of

01:33:54.386 --> 01:34:03.274
like of like Nazi propaganda that's pumped into my for you tab on X and that I press.

01:34:03.354 --> 01:34:04.535
I don't, you know, less of this.

01:34:04.755 --> 01:34:05.476
I don't want to see this.

01:34:05.536 --> 01:34:06.256
I don't want to see this.

01:34:06.276 --> 01:34:10.380
And they constantly put it into my feed in order to stress me out and trigger me.

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.262
And it, and it, and it works sometimes.

01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:15.985
And, you know, it's, it's very much like a curated reality.

01:34:16.245 --> 01:34:18.027
And that's, that's, you know,

01:34:18.888 --> 01:34:21.892
But were you there at some point not understanding that?

01:34:21.932 --> 01:34:22.653
Because I was.

01:34:22.914 --> 01:34:26.859
I really thought that Twitter was a place where people were kind of getting away with something.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.864
I didn't see it this way for a long time.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:31.586
I was fooled so well.

01:34:31.707 --> 01:34:31.947
I mean...

01:34:32.992 --> 01:34:35.234
Man, oh man, I was bamboozled, dude.

01:34:35.354 --> 01:34:36.936
I'm completely bamboozled.

01:34:37.716 --> 01:34:45.883
I think there are there are ways to use it once and you can actually use it against them to a degree once you understand what it is.

01:34:47.305 --> 01:34:51.068
And, you know, there are ways to kind of beat their algorithm and that kind of thing.

01:34:52.749 --> 01:35:02.472
But unless you understand the level of manipulation that is going on, then yeah, you'll get caught up.

01:35:02.532 --> 01:35:11.515
And I think the overwhelming majority of people do not understand how incredibly manipulated it is, let alone the simple fact that

01:35:12.619 --> 01:35:37.425
You know, checking in on this app all the time, what that does to you psychologically, where the first thing you do in the morning when you wake up instead of, you know, looking at your loved one, your husband or your wife or whatever it is and saying good morning and giving them a kiss is you look and see, you know, what notifications you got or if someone said something mean to you or if someone, you know, whatever it is or what's the thing going on.

01:35:39.666 --> 01:35:42.508
I think people underestimate the impact of that.

01:35:43.429 --> 01:35:52.936
And I mean, one more point I want to add about what you were saying about kind of the psychosomatic aspect of people are like, well, this is the sickest I've ever I've ever been.

01:35:53.036 --> 01:35:54.157
One more example of that.

01:35:54.558 --> 01:35:56.979
I have an investigation I never published.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.585
I think you and I, I must have told you about this a while ago, but it was specifically about Pennsylvania, where my whole

01:36:04.929 --> 01:36:07.251
father's side of the family is actually from Pittsburgh.

01:36:07.331 --> 01:36:09.233
So Pittsburgh is kind of a second home to me.

01:36:10.574 --> 01:36:14.578
And my father's mother, my paternal grandmother,

01:36:15.413 --> 01:36:18.535
She was very, very sharp.

01:36:19.296 --> 01:36:28.943
And in the in the covid era, you know, she was in like like an elderly, I guess, like a whatever retirement home, an old folks home in Pittsburgh.

01:36:29.363 --> 01:36:32.025
And she had her friends there and she was pretty vibrant.

01:36:32.065 --> 01:36:40.311
She got a lot of interaction, which, of course, is necessary for any human, but especially elderly people as they're locked away, taken away from their families.

01:36:40.371 --> 01:36:44.294
That's basically what I think kills them or accelerates their decline.

01:36:45.171 --> 01:37:01.742
Um, and when COVID hit, uh, they basically stuck her in a room and she described it as like, um, being in prison and I was not smart enough, which I almost, you know, in some, I'm, I'm, I'll just be forever.

01:37:03.573 --> 01:37:04.874
just angry about.

01:37:05.254 --> 01:37:18.065
I was not smart enough or aware enough or I was too bamboozled to really understand that that I wasn't a threat to her, that actually I was like myself and my newborn daughter at the time and my family going to visit her.

01:37:18.445 --> 01:37:19.266
We were the medicine.

01:37:19.326 --> 01:37:22.849
We you know, that's what keeps people keep would have kept her alive.

01:37:23.469 --> 01:37:26.452
And so when I was finally allowed to go visit her, they kept us.

01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:37.605
behind a see through piece of plastic, put in the room with masks on and we could only stay in that room for 15 minutes.

01:37:38.326 --> 01:37:43.111
And, you know, we could talk to her and wave at her, and I'm with my like infant daughter.

01:37:44.032 --> 01:37:44.913
And and that was it.

01:37:44.953 --> 01:37:47.614
And I could just see how mentally degraded she was.

01:37:48.194 --> 01:37:51.636
And then it wasn't that long after I got to see her one more time.

01:37:51.736 --> 01:37:55.378
And she was she was still alive, but not really there.

01:37:56.138 --> 01:37:58.199
And then soon after she died.

01:37:58.219 --> 01:38:07.684
And I realized they just basically under the pretext of covid-19 just took grandma up to the edge of the cliff and

01:38:08.224 --> 01:38:08.324
it's

01:38:23.184 --> 01:38:47.951
uh... her entire family was killed in the holocaust she was a first-generation uh... american her whole family in europe was wiped out including her grandparents who came to visit and live in the u s stayed here for two years and it wasn't religious enough for them so they went back to lithuania they were all killed so her whole family is killed and then she

01:38:50.390 --> 01:39:03.765
post-world war two has like she and my grandfather have this family and they succeed and have their small business in morgantown west virginia a furniture store that provided for their family and they became like

01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:11.629
upper middle class and and and they ended up having a very, very big family and a lot of descendants.

01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:17.071
And so to go from that horror to kind of like a redemption story in a way.

01:39:17.591 --> 01:39:29.755
And then at the very end for this like eugenicists program to basically take her off to the edge of the cliff and just throw her off is the ultimate just infuriating.

01:39:30.215 --> 01:39:31.616
It just infuriates me so much.

01:39:32.436 --> 01:39:50.783
Um, and when I actually looked at what they did in Pennsylvania specifically to spread that fear, um, it was actually, you know, each state had different, uh, lockdown, um, orders given out by the governor.

01:39:51.644 --> 01:39:55.025
And, uh, in, um,

01:39:55.546 --> 01:40:12.758
Pennsylvania, it was all designed in Carnegie Mellon University in a laboratory, a privately funded laboratory that was done in concert with Facebook and DARPA and Google and Amazon.

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:34.719
So three of the biggest Silicon Valley corporations and DARPA, which is like one of the experimental arms, research arms of the Department of Defense that were basically creating lockdowns and the protocols that would be implemented over the whole state.

01:40:34.739 --> 01:40:36.180
It wasn't even actual, there were no like

01:40:36.883 --> 01:40:52.041
public health officials involved in this date they just dictated and the governor uh... was isn't it was the governor time i can't think of it remember i don't remember of the top and i'm sorry that's right i can think of his name off top my head i mean this information has been sitting in my you know in the

01:40:52.802 --> 01:41:15.070
Archived in my brain for two plus years, but he openly boasted that we're working with these experts from Carnegie Mellon University and this privately funded organization that's basically a think tank inside the university and and they actually created a a Case tracker case counter Tom Wolfe.

01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:16.090
It's a Tom Wolfe.

01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:20.832
It's a really important name because he has a long history with this biosecurity state to

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.585
Oh man, there's so much we can do with this.

01:41:25.885 --> 01:41:31.493
So they created on Facebook a way for people to just report cases themselves.

01:41:31.553 --> 01:41:37.701
So it was like, if you have any symptom, if you have a headache, if you feel woozy, you're tired,

01:41:38.562 --> 01:41:40.223
you can just click that as a COVID case.

01:41:40.283 --> 01:41:44.485
And then anyone on Facebook is just watching these COVID cases just skyrocket.

01:41:44.925 --> 01:41:45.625
It's everywhere.

01:41:46.005 --> 01:41:48.166
I think I I'm short of breath.

01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:49.007
I think I have it.

01:41:49.087 --> 01:41:54.469
So just is just one of the ways they created so much so much fear.

01:41:55.009 --> 01:42:05.514
And there's no doubt that that contributed mightily to how people perceived whatever seasonal respiratory virus or whatever they had.

01:42:06.955 --> 01:42:07.855
And I think they're

01:42:08.427 --> 01:42:10.148
You know, I mean.

01:42:11.449 --> 01:42:29.560
It's not going to happen, but it's like we need some kind of independent commission to establish what actually happened the same way we need it with October 7th to know what exactly happened on October 7th, who was responsible, how many people were killed by Israel rather than, you know, everyone says it was the Hamas massacre.

01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.701
They raped and burned.

01:42:31.656 --> 01:42:32.597
What exactly happened then?

01:42:32.677 --> 01:42:34.138
And what exactly happened?

01:42:34.299 --> 01:42:35.760
Who were the players involved?

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.161
Who were the people at the top?

01:42:37.221 --> 01:42:40.464
Who were the witting agents?

01:42:40.584 --> 01:42:41.826
And this is what we need to know.

01:42:42.486 --> 01:42:46.470
And the constant, even to this day, to talk about lab leak,

01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:54.037
or, you know, spike protein or the origin or this or that are just distractions.

01:42:54.217 --> 01:43:02.205
And it's like our lives, our children's lives, like our society, humanity is at stake.

01:43:02.365 --> 01:43:05.889
And so I really encourage people to

01:43:08.524 --> 01:43:14.548
Go watch what Jonathan J. Cooley has to say on his streams.

01:43:15.288 --> 01:43:22.293
His channel, Gigome Biological, which I will link to, is an incredible resource.

01:43:22.353 --> 01:43:23.073
And challenge him.

01:43:23.113 --> 01:43:26.315
And interview him.

01:43:26.415 --> 01:43:28.216
People should interview you, I think.

01:43:29.797 --> 01:43:31.519
And really examine these things.

01:43:31.559 --> 01:43:35.901
Because these are incredibly important questions.

01:43:37.662 --> 01:43:37.942
I don't know.

01:43:37.982 --> 01:43:38.342
I don't know.

01:43:38.382 --> 01:43:40.163
You know, I mean, dude, you're a king, man.

01:43:40.223 --> 01:43:41.004
I don't know what to tell you.

01:43:41.024 --> 01:43:44.085
I really think we got a we got somewhere today.

01:43:44.145 --> 01:43:45.766
I really thought it was a great conversation.

01:43:45.806 --> 01:43:48.727
And more importantly, I want to come back and keep talking.

01:43:48.767 --> 01:43:57.031
So if you're if your listeners or your followers have a follow up, you know, direction we need to go or topics we need to go to, I'd be happy to do it.

01:43:57.191 --> 01:44:03.854
And yeah, I mean, just please, let's keep going, because this is well, how can I say it?

01:44:03.894 --> 01:44:06.035
There aren't very many independent media

01:44:07.012 --> 01:44:08.073
sources out there.

01:44:08.113 --> 01:44:18.284
I think that you are one of them and I am, you know, you're the first person to ask a lot of these questions and so I'm happy to come and address them again in more detail or just address them again to keep getting the message out.

01:44:19.127 --> 01:44:27.792
Yeah, I mean, we we we touched on so many different subjects that, you know, and I think people are going to have so many questions and there's so many ways to take this.

01:44:27.872 --> 01:44:38.218
It's such an enormous subject with that is so multifaceted that, you know, I really you know, people please ask questions, post comments.

01:44:38.318 --> 01:44:38.658
I'm going to.

01:44:39.759 --> 01:44:43.840
We'll do more of these these streams and again, interview Jay or Jay Cooley yourself.

01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:54.083
But now, Jay, I mean, I thank you immensely for your, you know, your effort over the years and your your integrity and your time today.

01:44:54.683 --> 01:44:56.404
And I really look forward to doing it again.

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:57.724
Thanks very much, Dan.

01:45:04.753 --> 01:45:05.014
Awesome.

01:45:05.775 --> 01:45:08.681
I think, uh, that was better than yesterday at least.

01:45:09.663 --> 01:45:09.944
Yeah.

01:45:10.064 --> 01:45:13.792
I mean, I think part of it is just like, no, I mean like there's a couple of things.

01:45:13.852 --> 01:45:15.536
I think part of it is, um,

01:45:17.617 --> 01:45:24.720
like I need to instead of trying to be like redacted or Tucker or just be like, Jay, what what happened?

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.181
What did Bobby Kennedy tell you?

01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:29.863
I just need to be like who I am and be like, look, here's how I got to you.

01:45:29.923 --> 01:45:32.604
And that just, you know, just pushes gets things going.

01:45:32.624 --> 01:45:39.567
So that's why when you texted me yesterday, I was like, you know, it's on me, too, because like, you know, this is it's it's more honest.

01:45:39.647 --> 01:45:42.268
It's like and OK, maybe it's not.

01:45:44.184 --> 01:45:44.524
I don't know.

01:45:45.085 --> 01:45:47.608
I think it's much more useful.

01:45:48.289 --> 01:45:49.830
It was awesome.

01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.492
Just don't doubt yourself.

01:45:51.532 --> 01:45:57.920
There were lots of my followers that were in the chat watching yesterday that were frustrated, but they weren't frustrated with you.

01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:59.001
They were frustrated with me.

01:45:59.381 --> 01:46:00.462
Because I wasn't listening.

01:46:00.962 --> 01:46:03.884
And they were like, he's asking you for a different talking point.

01:46:05.105 --> 01:46:08.787
So it really was me and you or whatever.

01:46:08.827 --> 01:46:10.168
But I'm glad that we worked it out.

01:46:10.208 --> 01:46:14.111
And again, like I said at the beginning of the stream, it's because no one's ever asked these questions before.

01:46:14.311 --> 01:46:14.631
No one.

01:46:14.931 --> 01:46:15.692
No one cared.

01:46:16.892 --> 01:46:20.775
And so I don't have a good rolled up answer to them.

01:46:20.835 --> 01:46:25.978
So I hope it came off that way, too, so that it'll all come off as honest as it really is.

01:46:25.998 --> 01:46:26.859
Because that's what it is.

01:46:26.979 --> 01:46:28.380
It's two guys that

01:46:29.488 --> 01:46:32.309
are really just internet friends, and we don't have much more than that.

01:46:32.389 --> 01:46:38.192
But we do have the truth, I think, and that's what makes it possible for this friendship to be.

01:46:38.292 --> 01:46:39.272
So thank you again.

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:39.992
I don't know what to say.

01:46:40.032 --> 01:46:41.393
I think it went really well.

01:46:42.099 --> 01:46:42.319
Yeah.

01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:42.559
Yeah.

01:46:42.579 --> 01:46:43.120
I think so, too.

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:46.922
Like I said, it's just like you can't like force a square peg in a round hole.

01:46:47.002 --> 01:46:54.407
Just have a conversation like the same way that like, you know, when we talk on the phone or this kind of thing that like we come at it from kind of very.

01:46:55.568 --> 01:47:05.275
Largely different like places in terms of just expertise and experience, but, you know, we we've arrived in very compatible places, so I think it it it's very

01:47:05.855 --> 01:47:16.146
Think we got that message out really well that you know from my perspective a lab leak was yes totally plausible But also not dangerous, and it could be lied about so it was actually a really nice thesis like that.

01:47:16.206 --> 01:47:19.629
I think yeah Yeah, definitely, so I don't know what's yeah.

01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:20.350
We'll do it again.

01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:24.234
I'll I'll see if Well, let me know when it's out.

01:47:24.274 --> 01:47:26.517
I'll share the link and try to get as many views as I can

01:47:27.557 --> 01:47:27.998
Definitely.

01:47:28.038 --> 01:47:30.260
I'm going to try to figure out how to like clip it out.

01:47:30.701 --> 01:47:32.002
I mean, I'm going to I don't know.

01:47:32.022 --> 01:47:33.343
I've never used these A.I.

01:47:33.484 --> 01:47:38.549
programs that like will be, you know, we'll get like, you know, ten one minute clips.

01:47:38.649 --> 01:47:41.172
I mean, I don't know if that will work with this, but it might.

01:47:41.372 --> 01:47:43.575
It might be like, you know, why did Bobby Kennedy?

01:47:43.973 --> 01:47:47.134
Why did Robert F. Kennedy, you know ignore you or whatever it might work.

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:48.714
So I don't know I'll mess with it.

01:47:49.274 --> 01:47:59.857
Um Redacted, you know, I told redacted that I was like doing a full interview with you and they were like awesome We'll do a follow-up, you know, they so they want to interview me about the interview.

01:47:59.957 --> 01:48:00.237
Oh nice.

01:48:00.257 --> 01:48:04.598
Okay, perfect I mean, I'd rather that they would just interview you.

01:48:04.738 --> 01:48:04.978
Yeah.

01:48:04.998 --> 01:48:05.178
Yeah.

01:48:05.198 --> 01:48:06.719
Yeah increments increments

01:48:07.628 --> 01:48:07.928
Yeah.

01:48:08.088 --> 01:48:08.769
I mean, what else?

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:09.169
I don't know.

01:48:09.269 --> 01:48:15.852
I'm not sure what else I have to, what else I can say to represent your point.

01:48:15.872 --> 01:48:16.392
You know what I mean?

01:48:16.552 --> 01:48:23.375
Why didn't Bobby or RFK interview, or why did RFK, you know, basically blow Jay Cooey off?

01:48:23.576 --> 01:48:24.616
Why didn't you ask Jay Cooey?

01:48:24.656 --> 01:48:26.397
Like he's going to be able to explain it better than I am.

01:48:26.437 --> 01:48:32.140
But, um, I might, I might just suggest that to them that they should just interview you.

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:34.981
Um, but, uh, oh, we didn't.

01:48:35.661 --> 01:48:35.921
Yeah.

01:48:36.202 --> 01:48:36.522
I don't know.

01:48:36.562 --> 01:48:37.042
Maybe in like,

01:48:38.143 --> 01:48:54.773
a week or something like that, we can talk, we can talk like Bhattacharya, because he's... Yeah, I didn't, I didn't, I had it on my page here, but it didn't ever fit in, and I didn't want to, I felt like it could potentially be a very sharp left turn, and I didn't, we were going so well, I didn't want to do that.

01:48:55.053 --> 01:48:59.856
Yeah, yeah, it's, I mean, it's... It's a perfect excuse to bring me back though, so it's fine.

01:49:00.516 --> 01:49:06.261
Exactly, this is the thing, like there's no way, it's like, there's just no way we're going to cover everything.

01:49:06.301 --> 01:49:08.502
We didn't, you know, get into like transfection.

01:49:09.083 --> 01:49:09.603
Right.

01:49:09.763 --> 01:49:11.685
No, but I think that was what, that was good.

01:49:11.805 --> 01:49:17.710
That, again, that you, you said it a couple of times, you know, if you want to know more, you can go to my site or we can come back again.

01:49:17.770 --> 01:49:18.750
So it's perfect, I think.

01:49:18.971 --> 01:49:19.111
Yeah.

01:49:19.884 --> 01:49:29.740
You know, I just I don't know how to win because we haven't ever had the chance, you know, like if this is the chance to win, then we haven't been here before.

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:30.541
It's kind of like the.

01:49:31.634 --> 01:49:33.135
Have you ever seen that movie?

01:49:33.395 --> 01:49:34.975
Is it The Day After Tomorrow?

01:49:35.015 --> 01:49:35.536
What is it called?

01:49:36.056 --> 01:49:37.076
The Day Before Tomorrow?

01:49:37.116 --> 01:49:37.496
What was it?

01:49:37.596 --> 01:49:40.938
I think it's The Day After Tomorrow, but I never saw it.

01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:44.919
If you haven't seen it, dude, it's one of Tom Cruise's coolest movies.

01:49:44.999 --> 01:49:47.380
It's like, you will love it.

01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:54.383
If you don't know anything about it, trust me, it'll be a movie that at the end you're like, I'm so happy that I watched it.

01:49:54.423 --> 01:49:57.664
And you will forget about all your problems for an hour and a half.

01:49:57.824 --> 01:49:58.564
It's really that.

01:49:58.884 --> 01:49:59.725
It's wonderful.

01:50:00.185 --> 01:50:00.705
Cool, cool.

01:50:01.477 --> 01:50:09.480
Yeah, I mean, at some point I got to finish these like multiple written investigations that I have.

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.922
I mean, I think you actually might even have access to the one, like all the Bill Gertz stuff I was telling you about.

01:50:17.442 --> 01:50:21.624
I mean, I have like pages and pages that just lay out the narrative of

01:50:22.324 --> 01:50:26.587
How lab leak was I mean, I have the death certificate thing written out though.

01:50:26.627 --> 01:50:35.352
It's it needs to be revised But like the lab leak thing I have like pages and pages and pages where it's like Overwhelming and you see like all the players.

01:50:35.412 --> 01:50:41.636
I found the earliest instant instances of it on on like Twitter

01:50:42.941 --> 01:50:44.361
of people promoting lab leak.

01:50:44.421 --> 01:50:54.964
And it was and they were the shady X account or like Twitter accounts, one of which is like now, well, I guess I think is rebranded now, but was like a NAFO account.

01:50:54.984 --> 01:50:56.324
You know, NAFO is no.

01:50:57.664 --> 01:51:01.625
It was like this like pro Ukraine war.

01:51:01.685 --> 01:51:07.166
It was like it's pro war, like this whole CIA operation that was like they created.

01:51:08.446 --> 01:51:10.067
It was like they created like

01:51:12.912 --> 01:51:34.899
They basically it was like a social media phenomenon where they just created all these like basically fake accounts or inauthentic troll accounts to artificially generate support for Ukraine war and they would attack anyone who criticized the Ukraine war or like so like me and you know, a lot of my

01:51:35.499 --> 01:51:38.020
friends who were doing stuff on that, we would get attacked by them.

01:51:38.221 --> 01:51:41.122
And my friend Alex did like an expose on them.

01:51:41.202 --> 01:51:49.006
And then I look at when I was doing this investigation on like the origins of lab leak and the origins debate itself.

01:51:49.547 --> 01:51:55.770
And one of the first ones, there were two accounts that promoted this, and one of them at that point had morphed into a NAFO account.

01:51:56.330 --> 01:52:00.012
So they were like seeding this narrative in like December 2019, you know, two.

01:52:00.152 --> 01:52:00.473
And then like,

01:52:03.594 --> 01:52:06.475
Were you at all blown away when Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:52:06.515 --> 01:52:17.960
Just casually threw out there that his son went to Ukraine and was a machine-gun guy Where the hell did that come from dude the first time I heard that I was like wait what who what?

01:52:21.222 --> 01:52:23.363
Great and his and his daughter-in-law is CIA.

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:23.883
Yeah.

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.324
Yeah, that's nobody cares.

01:52:25.384 --> 01:52:25.844
That's fine.

01:52:25.864 --> 01:52:25.904
Oh

01:52:27.102 --> 01:52:27.983
Yeah, that's normal.

01:52:31.187 --> 01:52:32.228
She's ex CIA.

01:52:32.308 --> 01:52:32.609
Come on.

01:52:32.649 --> 01:52:33.369
Quit being so.

01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:33.910
Oh, yeah.

01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.170
Yeah.

01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.791
Once a spook.

01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:37.514
Once you're out, you're not you're definitely not a spook anymore.

01:52:37.755 --> 01:52:38.035
Right.

01:52:38.155 --> 01:52:38.315
So.

01:52:39.554 --> 01:52:40.675
Oh, man, so much to do.

01:52:40.775 --> 01:52:43.476
Well, like that Pennsylvania stuff is crazy.

01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:45.057
I mean, I can send you this research.

01:52:45.077 --> 01:52:46.757
It's just like stuff that I researched.

01:52:46.837 --> 01:52:53.560
And this is my problem is, like I said, I take too much on and then I don't end up like getting enough of it out.

01:52:53.701 --> 01:53:03.665
So like I have like so much research and the crazy stuff that I could probably say the same thing that I've covered things once, you know, and then I never cover them again, even though they're central.

01:53:03.685 --> 01:53:07.207
But even if you're covering them because you see the good thing about streaming,

01:53:08.007 --> 01:53:11.628
is like you can have like 7 or 8 or 20 tabs open and you can just go through them.

01:53:11.988 --> 01:53:23.711
Whereas like writing an article is a much more kind of laborious... And if you are a real writer then you must be very frustrated with these people who have a substack every day or two substacks every day.

01:53:23.771 --> 01:53:25.151
You know that's not real, right?

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:27.732
These people are... Yeah, I mean that's also probably true.

01:53:27.792 --> 01:53:28.432
I mean I'm like...

01:53:29.512 --> 01:53:33.194
I don't even I kind of honestly hate labels.

01:53:33.274 --> 01:53:35.475
I just call myself a journalist because that's what I do.

01:53:35.555 --> 01:53:36.956
People are like, are you a filmmaker?

01:53:37.056 --> 01:53:42.438
I'm like, well, I kind of fell into making films, but I'm not like a trained filmmaker.

01:53:42.478 --> 01:53:44.499
Like I could not teach someone how to do it.

01:53:44.599 --> 01:53:48.781
I just did it because like I needed to do it and I didn't know how else to get my message across.

01:53:49.261 --> 01:53:56.725
But like if someone, you know, a trained filmmaker or film professor would probably sit and watch my documentaries and could pick them apart technically.

01:53:56.765 --> 01:53:57.445
And I would be like,

01:53:58.328 --> 01:53:58.649
Yeah.

01:54:00.091 --> 01:54:04.760
So all that to say, like, okay, I like to do investigative journalism.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:10.611
I like to, you know, explore this whole lab leak thing and show the whole narrative and show how we've been fooled.

01:54:11.252 --> 01:54:13.934
all along and we need to, you know.

01:54:14.754 --> 01:54:22.759
But so, yeah, it's really hard for me to produce, you know, a substack post every day or I mean, it's what I need to do.

01:54:22.939 --> 01:54:27.142
And like I had a job when I moved to D.C., I had a job at RT America.

01:54:27.302 --> 01:54:28.843
That was my my job.

01:54:28.883 --> 01:54:34.267
And before I became a correspondent where I was on TV, I was a I was a writer.

01:54:34.527 --> 01:54:37.449
And so I would have to write like five articles per day.

01:54:38.129 --> 01:54:41.291
which was like, OK, you just have to learn how to be really efficient.

01:54:41.391 --> 01:54:46.475
I wish I could just had that level of like discipline and structure here at home.

01:54:46.555 --> 01:54:50.018
But it's just me in my own world.

01:54:50.098 --> 01:54:54.120
So, yeah, that's why I have so much unpublished.

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:58.103
But well, then that means you got a woodpile.

01:54:59.264 --> 01:54:59.885
Yeah, exactly.

01:54:59.905 --> 01:55:00.285
You're good.

01:55:00.405 --> 01:55:00.905
Exactly.

01:55:01.786 --> 01:55:03.167
All right, my friend.

01:55:03.227 --> 01:55:04.248
Well, thanks again.

01:55:04.368 --> 01:55:05.148
You're welcome.

01:55:05.429 --> 01:55:05.729
Thank you.

01:55:06.542 --> 01:55:15.534
Yeah, we can, you know, and it doesn't, we don't have to, like, if there's something that comes up, you know, what, like, we can do kind of, I don't want to say newsy stuff today.

01:55:15.594 --> 01:55:21.763
But if there's like a headline, they're like, like, I think a couple weeks ago, I sent you, let me see, like a, like a

01:55:26.718 --> 01:55:29.339
Yeah, like that Tucker, there's like the Tucker thing.

01:55:29.719 --> 01:55:30.679
Yeah, no, I get it.

01:55:30.699 --> 01:55:31.479
I like to do that.

01:55:31.779 --> 01:55:32.660
Just a little spot.

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.600
I mean, that would be cool too.

01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.920
We could just, you know, talk for a few minutes.

01:55:36.161 --> 01:55:40.302
And then, oh yeah, that Elon thing where he's like the J&J vaccine.

01:55:41.062 --> 01:55:42.902
You know, I had the OG Wuhan strain.

01:55:42.982 --> 01:55:45.263
J&J hurt my arm, but otherwise nothing.

01:55:45.623 --> 01:55:51.647
But, you know, our MRNA, it hit hard, but has a lot of potential to cure cancer.

01:55:51.707 --> 01:55:52.067
Yeah.

01:55:52.087 --> 01:55:53.288
Like that's fucking crazy.

01:55:53.628 --> 01:55:54.189
What a chump.

01:55:55.089 --> 01:55:55.970
You know, stuff like that.

01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:56.430
We can.

01:55:56.791 --> 01:55:59.112
But he's not any more sophisticated than Bobby.

01:55:59.132 --> 01:56:01.954
You're just supposed to believe that these people are having these thoughts.

01:56:02.114 --> 01:56:03.715
And it's just it's not.

01:56:03.975 --> 01:56:06.577
And I just it takes a long it.

01:56:07.237 --> 01:56:15.423
You actually have to try to convince and get lucky enough to be able to try and convince these people of something before you can see how obviously it is done.

01:56:15.823 --> 01:56:17.165
Right, exactly.

01:56:17.185 --> 01:56:19.027
All right, my friend.

01:56:19.087 --> 01:56:19.668
We'll speak soon.

01:56:19.808 --> 01:56:20.109
Okay.

01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.529
Be well.

01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:29.000
Bye All right, so that was the show for today I don't think I'm gonna be able to put together another one.

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.925
Although Mark and I have been sitting on this C-SPAN

01:56:34.969 --> 01:56:44.675
Jesse Gelsinger's dad and Ingder Verma talking about the whole gene therapy, you know, space and idea.

01:56:44.975 --> 01:56:47.957
And so tomorrow, that's going to be my study hall at 10am.

01:56:47.977 --> 01:56:52.860
I'm just going to watch that and take notes on it and try to contrast the

01:56:53.496 --> 01:57:00.781
the language, the attitude, the discussion in 2000 with the discussion in 2020 and 2025.

01:57:01.702 --> 01:57:08.607
Thank you very much for being here and for tolerating my performance yesterday.

01:57:08.907 --> 01:57:12.470
And hopefully today will be something that'll get us a little farther.

01:57:13.150 --> 01:57:14.311
And I'll see you again soon.
