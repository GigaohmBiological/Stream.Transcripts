WEBVTT

00:53.015 --> 01:00.730
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself, it's like

01:39.361 --> 01:42.064
I let it go back to when we played as kids, but then it changed.

01:42.224 --> 01:43.126
That's the way it is.

01:43.506 --> 01:43.946
Come on.

01:44.047 --> 01:45.408
Come on.

01:45.789 --> 01:49.753
That's just the way it is.

01:50.114 --> 01:51.896
Things will never be the same.

02:07.369 --> 02:11.023
Things will never be the same That's just the way it is

02:17.136 --> 02:19.898
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces.

02:19.938 --> 02:21.839
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to racists.

02:21.979 --> 02:24.961
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this one better place.

02:24.981 --> 02:26.702
Let's erase the wasted.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.703
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.

02:28.743 --> 02:30.845
Cause vote black and white and smoke a crack tonight.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.026
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other.

02:33.066 --> 02:35.347
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other.

02:35.427 --> 02:39.070
And although it seems evanescent, we ain't ready to see a black president.

02:39.170 --> 02:43.853
It ain't a secret or concealed a fact, our penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.254
But some things will never change, try to show another

02:50.026 --> 02:52.608
That's just the way it is Things will never be the same

03:25.137 --> 03:27.617
Things will never be the same.

03:27.657 --> 03:32.598
That's just the way it is.

03:32.758 --> 03:33.659
Oh, yeah.

03:34.539 --> 03:36.759
We gotta make a change.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.380
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.340
Let's change the way we eat.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.100
Let's change the way we live.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.261
And let's change the way we treat each other.

03:46.641 --> 03:51.322
You see, the old way wasn't working, so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive.

03:51.902 --> 03:53.122
And still I see no changes.

04:21.992 --> 04:25.014
That's just the way it is Things will never be the same

04:55.650 --> 04:59.772
That's just the way it is.

05:00.173 --> 05:04.375
Things will never be the same.

05:04.495 --> 05:06.416
That's just the way it is.

05:06.596 --> 05:07.156
Oh yeah.

05:07.176 --> 05:10.418
Some things will never change.

05:32.391 --> 05:34.777
So let me see if I know how to do this.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.963
This should be good.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.390
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.674
It is the 10th of September, 2024.

05:44.754 --> 05:46.715
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

05:46.835 --> 05:48.957
It is 10.51 in the morning here.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.458
I apologize for being late.

05:51.679 --> 05:55.903
I've got a lot of excuses to share with you, and it's an impromptu Biology 101.

05:56.003 --> 05:58.525
I titled it 101-3 Ruby Update and Twib Exercise.

06:03.188 --> 06:06.091
This is my way of just getting back into the groove of things.

06:06.111 --> 06:09.093
We had a little bit of a rough weekend because we had a bit of a scare.

06:10.514 --> 06:17.120
And so I wanted to share a little bit of that with you because it's still a sort of experience that I'm processing.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.903
And it's also kind of a very tiny

06:22.864 --> 06:23.605
I don't know how to say it.

06:23.665 --> 06:31.073
It's kind of a microcosm of where we've been over these last few years trying to, you know, rediscover the truth.

06:32.295 --> 06:38.862
And myself as a still feels like a very inexperienced and young father.

06:41.245 --> 06:42.326
And certainly as a

06:43.869 --> 06:53.773
as a partner, my wife and I, as a partnership, are still, you know, learning all the ropes of being parents together and working together as kids grow.

06:54.613 --> 07:08.319
It's a never-ending thing, you know, and it's not something I don't think anybody's an expert on except for maybe grandparents, and then really they're only experts on their kids and their time, and so it's really something that

07:09.048 --> 07:10.770
is an incredibly humbling experience.

07:10.830 --> 07:18.836
And actually, anybody that's owned a dog or a cat, I guess, I've never owned a cat, but I guess it happens with cats.

07:18.896 --> 07:31.827
I'm sure it must happen with horses and maybe even farmers that really care for their livestock, like cattle and stuff, feel the same way as well, although there's a lot of them then.

07:34.211 --> 07:48.336
I really can't stress enough how crazy it is, what I feel as though I've kind of discovered with regard to veterinary science, and in just one particular question in general.

07:50.476 --> 07:52.637
I don't know if this is out of focus or what's going on.

07:52.657 --> 07:56.438
I haven't really been looking at the screen here to see what it's finding.

07:56.478 --> 07:57.138
I think I look all right.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.425
So let me explain what's going on here, I guess.

08:01.465 --> 08:03.468
Maybe that's the most important thing to do first.

08:03.528 --> 08:04.870
Maybe I'll just blank this out.

08:06.712 --> 08:14.063
So we've got a dog named Ruby, and if Ruby wanted to come in here right now, Ruby could come in here, but I think she's just laying in the garage and feeling really...

08:15.279 --> 08:16.240
She's mama's dog.

08:16.301 --> 08:20.046
So, you know, when mama's gone, the Ruby doesn't really hang out.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.629
But Ruby wanted to come in here.

08:22.689 --> 08:23.911
Ruby could come in here.

08:23.971 --> 08:24.652
Ruby, come!

08:25.673 --> 08:26.614
But I don't think she will.

08:27.195 --> 08:30.940
Because she's sleeping in there and she's pretty hard to get off of that cold floor.

08:31.841 --> 08:34.382
Anyway, the point is that Ruby is nine.

08:35.163 --> 08:41.525
Ruby has not really been, per se, to the vet since 2016 when we got off the plane.

08:42.106 --> 08:51.750
The last reason she went to the vet was to check her titer for her rabies shot before she could fly into America, and so that was when she was one year and three months old.

08:53.010 --> 08:58.213
And since we've been in the United States, we will freely confess that we've never gone to a vet.

08:58.273 --> 09:05.596
Mostly because vets don't, the things that you hear about vets in America are very much true.

09:07.316 --> 09:10.638
They're not a place where you're taking a patient.

09:10.658 --> 09:12.579
You're not gonna get a lot of information.

09:13.599 --> 09:17.061
And there's, you know, this huge like chasm

09:18.501 --> 09:28.908
wide difference between the most informed vet tech and the most ill-informed vet tech, the most informed veterinarian and the most ill-informed veterinarian.

09:29.829 --> 09:44.178
And because this is a business, well there are other factors that are at play here and you can imagine that with pets not being people that there is a great deal more propensity for these kinds of

09:45.163 --> 09:49.707
other reasons and other motivations and other shortcuts to take over.

09:51.548 --> 09:54.791
And not, you know, I hate to say it like this, but patient care.

10:00.015 --> 10:04.178
So I'm just going to tell you the story the way that I was, I experienced it.

10:05.159 --> 10:06.700
And I hope you won't find it too boring.

10:08.105 --> 10:15.349
I don't know if I should switch over to the other camera and try to do something writing, but I just think it's interesting, maybe just fine to sit here and just talk about it.

10:16.129 --> 10:24.233
So Ruby, nine-year-old female, unfixed, unspayed, never had any puppies.

10:25.473 --> 10:26.614
And I'm a biologist.

10:26.654 --> 10:33.737
My wife is a biologist, albeit a plant biologist, plant physiologist, retired, if you will.

10:36.363 --> 10:37.964
You know, I thought I knew a lot about dogs.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.466
I thought I knew a lot about mammals.

10:39.526 --> 10:41.207
You know, I've been reading about them my whole life.

10:41.328 --> 10:43.389
I used to want to be a veterinarian way back when I was 12.

10:44.410 --> 10:49.495
And so it's just this thing, you know, I read James Harriot, all things, all creatures great and small.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.958
I mean, I thought about veterinarians as cool for a long time.

10:52.998 --> 10:54.540
I watched Dr. Pohl, the whole thing.

10:55.501 --> 11:12.254
And so what our primary strategy was here when she was sick was, you know, we wanted to go to a veterinarian that we could count on not to judge us for, you know, since 2016, not taking her anywhere for her eating raw meat, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

11:13.263 --> 11:15.245
So Ruby is pretty skinny.

11:15.346 --> 11:17.007
She's exactly 100 pounds.

11:17.108 --> 11:19.170
For as big as she is, that's pretty skinny.

11:20.131 --> 11:21.272
You know, you can feel her ribs.

11:21.292 --> 11:22.374
You can feel her spine.

11:23.395 --> 11:25.818
She can move around really nice when she gets excited.

11:25.858 --> 11:28.981
She's been a very, very, very healthy dog until this

11:29.722 --> 11:30.843
last estrus.

11:31.083 --> 11:48.915
So she, as most dogs do, if they are not fixed a couple times a year, it depends on the breed, will have this period of time where their behavior changes, they whine a little more, and they can drip from their genitals.

11:49.195 --> 11:56.680
And this dripping is not a large quantity, and it's something that the dog often cleans up after herself.

11:57.941 --> 11:58.801
And it's pretty normal.

12:01.624 --> 12:05.567
I mean, normal in the sense of this is how it works with a dog that you don't fix.

12:05.627 --> 12:08.469
And so some people make their dogs wear diapers.

12:08.509 --> 12:10.291
Some people just keep them in the garage.

12:10.331 --> 12:11.892
You know, there's lots of different solutions.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.456
My wife is pretty much, you know, treats our house like a barn.

12:16.496 --> 12:20.779
And so we just wear our shoes inside and, you know, Ruby comes in and out whatever door she wants.

12:20.819 --> 12:21.640
And so in this case,

12:22.260 --> 12:26.623
We try to keep her on her place and keep her clean and that kind of thing and encourage her to clean it up.

12:26.663 --> 12:35.088
And in general, after nine years, she's gotten very good at understanding that that's her job to clean that up if it's somewhere in the floor or whatever.

12:35.148 --> 12:36.289
But it's not perfect.

12:36.329 --> 12:42.473
And for a lot of people who aren't dogs, I guess, or dog people, people who aren't dogs,

12:42.893 --> 12:47.157
People who aren't dog people, this might sound like, oh my gosh, I can't believe you live like that.

12:47.197 --> 12:57.647
But if you live with a dog that's 100 pounds and has this much hair and everything, it's kind of a fact of life that a lot of what's in our house probably smells like her and we don't realize it anymore.

12:58.551 --> 13:04.136
People that aren't dog people probably come over and immediately know that like, oh my gosh, this dog dominates your life.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.959
But from our perspective, it's just the way it is.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.340
That's the way our house smells.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.861
That's the way the floor is.

13:09.921 --> 13:11.923
That's how often we have to vacuum and clean.

13:12.383 --> 13:19.129
That's why the vacuum needs to be cleaned regularly around the thing that spins too, because there's hair in there and yada, yada, yada.

13:19.990 --> 13:22.232
So we've been living with Ruby and other dogs.

13:22.372 --> 13:23.413
I had a Jack Russell.

13:23.473 --> 13:27.517
My wife had a Liam Berger mixed with a Brown Lab when we got married.

13:27.557 --> 13:37.465
And so then we had two dogs for the whole time that we had our first two boys until we basically lost them in the same six months or the same three months.

13:37.965 --> 13:39.387
They got old and decrepit.

13:40.296 --> 13:45.117
The big one died and then the little one we put down because she was getting blind and starting to walk into cabinets.

13:45.817 --> 13:47.298
And so Ruby is nine.

13:47.438 --> 13:48.198
She's healthy.

13:49.338 --> 13:50.259
She's unfixed.

13:50.599 --> 13:55.220
And I thought I understood most about mammals, but it turns out that I didn't.

13:56.500 --> 14:07.523
It turns out that dogs don't have a typical cycle like we imagine they might if we imagine that their cycle is similar to the females in our lives.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.084
Um, and I didn't know that.

14:10.544 --> 14:31.352
And in fact, what I find the first main point to make, um, that if I was writing something down, which I guess I could, um, is the, uh, the first thing I might write down is, is the idea.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.153
Um, what, uh, do I have here?

14:34.213 --> 14:37.495
Can I do this and then this?

14:38.615 --> 14:40.896
The first thing I might write down, and then this should work.

14:41.277 --> 14:41.457
Yeah.

14:42.037 --> 14:44.959
The first thing I write right down is the biology of female dogs.

14:45.019 --> 14:48.861
Now you might expect that if you were, sorry, I'll get bigger.

14:49.041 --> 14:56.265
If you were to walk into a vet office with a sick dog and you told them that you loved your dog, you took good care of her, you fed her raw meat.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.647
You know that they're very sensitive dogs.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.969
You take great care, you groom her and yada, yada, yada.

15:03.049 --> 15:03.810
And she's sick.

15:05.219 --> 15:15.802
You think one of the first things, if you said that, you know, we think that she has an infection of the uterus that the internet told us was called a pio metra or pio mitra.

15:15.882 --> 15:16.302
I don't know.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.582
They generally, I think it's pio mitra, but they shorten it to pio.

15:20.603 --> 15:22.763
Um, and so we, we want some help.

15:23.623 --> 15:33.706
Um, you would think that the, one of the first things that a vet would do would explain to you the, the whoops, the biology of the dog, but that's actually not what happened.

15:34.686 --> 15:34.786
Um,

15:36.434 --> 15:40.776
In fact, the first couple of vets that we talked to gave us no information about that.

15:40.836 --> 15:48.820
And the one that tried to give us information about that basically gave us the wrong information, or as far as we can tell now, in retrospect, the wrong information.

15:48.880 --> 15:58.645
Now, let me preface the whole long-winded story by saying that, of course, you can imagine that yours truly was reading like a madman once we realized what this was.

15:59.886 --> 16:04.949
I was trying to do my best to use my access to PubMed to figure out if I could teach myself

16:06.110 --> 16:12.679
what a pyometra was and whether it was treatable and what kinds there were and how people did it and yada, yada, yada.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.749
And what you find on the internet is that it's a deadly condition that can only be treated by surgery.

16:21.257 --> 16:25.498
You just have to take your dog in and the uterus has to come out.

16:26.499 --> 16:31.400
And this is an emergency surgery because dogs can die from pyometria.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.381
And I'm not at all arguing with that, of course.

16:34.421 --> 16:37.422
I'm not suggesting that that is not the case indeed.

16:38.783 --> 16:47.766
What I am suggesting, however, is that there is a possibility that the default treatment

16:51.815 --> 17:05.406
strategy that most vet techs and in fact most veterinarians know as the rule is that when a dog is having a pyometra that they need to have, they need to be spayed.

17:06.793 --> 17:20.941
And what's extraordinary about this, of course, is that Ruby is a nine-year-old dog, so if you had insurance for a dog like this, it's even possible, or even likely, that the insurance would reject the whole idea.

17:21.001 --> 17:26.185
Number one, because she might die, and number two, because she's old, and if she's only expected to live to be 11,

17:27.265 --> 17:38.908
then doing a multi-thousand dollar surgery on this dog from the insurance company's perspective might not be risk-benefit rewarding enough to justify it.

17:38.928 --> 17:39.928
They might just deny it.

17:41.009 --> 17:44.349
And so what's interesting though is that this is not what happened to us.

17:44.409 --> 17:50.731
We heard a unanimous from multiple calls, like many calls, that there's only one thing to do.

17:51.843 --> 18:03.628
and that open or closed, which is something that they didn't distinguish between, explain the biology of at all, whether or not the pyometra was open or closed, didn't matter.

18:04.348 --> 18:07.409
She had to have her uterus out and pretty much immediately.

18:08.249 --> 18:09.330
There's nothing else you can do.

18:10.785 --> 18:16.629
And now, of course, after searching the internet, we found out that that's not the case at all, that there are plenty of things you can do.

18:17.129 --> 18:27.536
Of course, the default would not to be, in a similar situation, would not to be remove the uterus of a horse, or remove the uterus of a cow, or remove the uterus of, you see?

18:29.878 --> 18:38.844
And so, it very quickly became obvious that these people weren't really thinking, they were just getting mad at us for suggesting that there might be something else we could do.

18:40.865 --> 18:42.146
besides put your dog to sleep.

18:44.068 --> 18:47.371
And so this is pretty extraordinary already because we were really frustrated.

18:47.431 --> 18:51.074
We went to them with the idea that she can't.

18:52.202 --> 18:55.065
that Lienberger's really don't do well with narcotics.

18:55.165 --> 18:58.248
And so we're really worried about, we don't want to spay her.

18:58.368 --> 19:00.049
Can we just give her antibiotics?

19:00.129 --> 19:04.674
And is there a way to do a uterine lavage or something like this?

19:04.794 --> 19:07.256
Because maybe they do that in horses or in cattle.

19:07.816 --> 19:10.599
Can we give her, is there anything else that we can do?

19:10.659 --> 19:13.662
And the unequivocal answer was, of course not.

19:16.109 --> 19:44.798
And so what else was very interesting about this journey through what is pyrometra and what can be done about it were several lectures on YouTube or papers on PubMed and a general realization that there is no real good reason other than surgery can be quite successful in young dogs to compare a

19:47.302 --> 19:53.984
a spay in old age with a spay in a puppy because that's what's done a lot in America now.

19:54.004 --> 20:12.009
And in fact, if I recall correctly with my dog, Daisy, my little Jack Russell from way back when, when I was still in Chicago, that dog, I think was fixed early enough where essentially she never, never went through, I guess what we would call puberty, the full development with hormones and everything.

20:12.069 --> 20:15.110
I don't think happened in that dog because she was fixed very early.

20:16.127 --> 20:32.246
And the upsides of this, of course, are, in theory, she can never have a pyometra, which can kill her, and she will never have babies, and she will never have an unplanned pregnancy, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

20:32.286 --> 20:32.967
That's the idea.

20:33.007 --> 20:33.848
That's what you're told.

20:34.429 --> 20:35.170
So do it early.

20:37.765 --> 20:46.570
And it's extraordinary now in retrospect to realize how I just went along with it when I was 20, whatever, and got Daisy as a puppy.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.951
And it just made, you know, whatever the vet says, okay, I do it.

20:49.011 --> 20:51.413
You know, I just want to walk the dog.

20:51.673 --> 21:02.119
And so it's an extraordinary journey that I think all of us are on now as the different layers of this illusion of,

21:03.286 --> 21:06.347
of high fidelity understanding is being broken.

21:06.507 --> 21:29.951
And what I find extraordinary is, although I'm sure there are lots of people who already knew this with regard to horses and dogs and veterinarians and whatever, because we just have not been going to the vet and because our dog is just healthy and we just feed her raw meat and worry about grooming her and keeping her clean and healthy.

21:31.854 --> 21:35.298
that we weren't aware of what's going on in America.

21:35.358 --> 21:42.446
But for example, the very first time that we were told what would happen if we spayed Ruby was between two and $6,000.

21:47.082 --> 21:54.929
Within two days of calling people, this number had already risen between 4 and 8K.

21:55.990 --> 22:07.600
And when we finally decided that something really might need to be done, because we went to a veterinarian who was supposed to be holistic and alternative,

22:08.300 --> 22:23.269
And she told us that there was no holistic alternative because she poked a swab inside of the dog and then looked at that under a scope or something and decided that alternative treatments were not appropriate for Ruby.

22:23.809 --> 22:24.909
that it was already too late.

22:25.650 --> 22:34.193
And in fact, our concern about the narcosis and the fact that the dog is very sensitive means that she can't do the surgery.

22:34.273 --> 22:46.597
And instead, we had to go to a specialty doctor that could have all the necessary equipment to cope with a dog that wasn't dealing with anesthesia or something like that.

22:47.018 --> 22:49.278
And so the cost went up to nine to $11,000.

22:51.772 --> 23:06.266
And so on Friday of last week, we were basically told that yes, Ruby could come in and they would evaluate whether they needed to do it right away, which would be more expensive, or where they could wait till Tuesday and it might cost between $9,000 and $11,000 to remove the uterus of a dog.

23:11.431 --> 23:28.886
And so the lucky thing is, is that the vet that we went to before we were told that she couldn't do it anymore, after we told her about whatever, and had this conversation about alternatives that were not appropriate for her, apparently, she gave us antibiotics.

23:31.064 --> 23:53.244
my wife had already started treating Ruby with a internet concoction that was composed of honey and turmeric, vitamin C, and by my request, a couple times she got ivermectin, which I thought would be kind of funny to add into the story because

23:53.823 --> 23:56.525
then everybody would blame her cure on ivermectin.

23:56.865 --> 24:04.790
But I'm not going to tell you that she didn't get it, but she didn't get it as much as she got, of course, she got antibiotics just like Joe Rogan did.

24:06.031 --> 24:09.513
And those antibiotics were two different kinds and she's still on them now.

24:10.053 --> 24:13.716
And so attributing any of her recovery to ivermectin as opposed to

24:14.336 --> 24:24.121
the raw honey, the turmeric, the vitamin C in large dose three times a day, and the antibiotics on two spectrums is kind of ridiculous, right?

24:24.201 --> 24:30.064
But if you wanted to, and if I wanted to, I could tell you that I gave my dog ivermectin and she's fine now.

24:32.765 --> 24:36.007
If I was being really honest, I would also have to tell you that I prayed a lot.

24:36.974 --> 24:39.597
And I prayed a lot for very specific things.

24:39.657 --> 24:47.485
Like if there was any way that they could spare my dog down here for a couple more years, I would really be grateful, even though I know I don't deserve it.

24:49.287 --> 24:57.155
So there's no way for me to sit here and tell you that that wasn't the reason why my dog is in the garage sleeping very soundly right now.

24:59.042 --> 25:08.030
So I just give you the list of things that we did to avoid the nine to $11,000 surgery that I guess they assume we have insurance for or something.

25:09.411 --> 25:21.421
Because you can go on YouTube right now and look this, this pile Mitra up and you can look in the comments from a couple of years ago and you can find quotes, 800, $1,200.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.062
Don't worry.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.305
Those, those surgeries, you can find a vet that will do it for $2,000.

25:29.625 --> 25:42.373
So we are entering a very dark world right now because it took us a very long time despite our best efforts to find anyone who understood the idea that a nine-year-old dog that's as healthy as a horse

25:43.607 --> 25:46.028
might be worthy of alternative treatments.

25:46.248 --> 25:56.012
And the crazy part about it is, is this biology apparently, according to our last vet, and now the one that we trust, you know, she's telling us what we want to hear.

25:56.072 --> 25:59.854
So maybe we're biased, but the biology was not explained correctly.

26:02.715 --> 26:07.297
So I'm just going to put a question mark up here because it's really like, they didn't tell us the biology of the dogs.

26:07.337 --> 26:11.179
They just said, no, it's surgery and surgery will cost,

26:13.462 --> 26:14.282
this much, right?

26:15.203 --> 26:16.564
So what's the real biology?

26:20.986 --> 26:24.188
Of course, the real biology is the open and closed PIOs, right?

26:24.248 --> 26:24.969
That's what that is.

26:25.529 --> 26:31.612
And open and closed PIOs is really interesting because again, the biology of dogs, I didn't understand it.

26:33.533 --> 26:37.376
And so what's cool about this is that I learned something again, and that's what it is.

26:37.556 --> 26:41.118
You just take responsibility for knowing and then you learn things all the time.

26:42.031 --> 26:47.533
And so in taking responsibility for knowing and understanding the biology that, shit, where did that go?

26:50.094 --> 27:05.881
Understanding the biology of my dog before I took her to a veterinarian so that I could protect her from ignorance, I still wasn't able to get where this vet got me, which I find got us, I should say, because it's me and Verla.

27:08.444 --> 27:15.606
Because what's so important to understand and what I think is so cool about this, and I'm wasting time or I'm wasting a lot of people's time, but I don't care.

27:15.626 --> 27:17.026
I'm trying to get back into the groove here.

27:17.767 --> 27:33.271
The idea of informed consent is that this vet felt very comfortable, almost obliged to educate us about what choices we were making, what choices were available to us in the context of us being the people that we were.

27:34.386 --> 27:46.930
So we had a real butting of heads at first because I've got a big mouth and that's a lot of the reasons why I don't make these phone calls because I very quickly can get into this, you know, attack mindset.

27:47.010 --> 27:51.872
I'm just not very good right now from the last four and a half years or so.

27:52.898 --> 28:02.325
And so one of the first things that this wonderful veterinarian said to us is that she hasn't had a rabies shot since she got off the plane.

28:02.345 --> 28:04.927
We're like, no, but we're not here to talk about vaccines.

28:04.947 --> 28:06.649
She's not getting any shots today.

28:07.469 --> 28:10.231
And you could see that at first she was very much

28:11.752 --> 28:12.893
not very happy with that.

28:12.933 --> 28:14.614
We didn't make eye contact at that point.

28:14.654 --> 28:19.657
And she just said, well, I'm just letting you know from a legal perspective that in Pennsylvania it's required.

28:19.717 --> 28:30.484
And so if it's not in her records and you have a problem and somebody, you know, the police come, for example, you just need to know that could be a very big problem, but let's not, we're not going to talk about that now.

28:30.544 --> 28:30.804
Indeed.

28:31.923 --> 28:47.914
Now, I don't remember the exact words, but she said the legal aspects of it, but then didn't say that, so, you know, take your dog out of here, or I'm judging you now or anything like that, but she totally brought it back to baseline again, which I also felt.

28:49.735 --> 28:59.342
And it was magical because I know for a fact, had I gone to any of these other places that Fearla had already been, this would have been an unmitigated disaster.

29:01.001 --> 29:19.377
because this woman never felt under threat by our knowledge, never felt under threat or worried that we were somehow crazy people, but instead respected us from the very beginning, evidence being the incredibly healthy, well-groomed, beautiful nine-year-old dog that's laying calmly on the floor.

29:21.499 --> 29:21.759
Anyway.

29:22.799 --> 29:29.941
What I found very exciting was that the real biology of this is much more complicated than open and closed.

29:30.961 --> 29:39.244
The other vets that we talked to told us that the danger was that she had an open pyometra and that if it closed,

29:39.744 --> 29:45.906
then she would have a very big problem because a closed pyometra is an infection inside of a closed uterus that can't drain.

29:46.326 --> 29:50.967
And so the pus fills the uterus until it eventually explodes or leaks into circulation.

29:51.427 --> 29:52.908
And then you have sepsis and you die.

29:53.408 --> 30:02.350
Not dissimilar to how I could have in theory died from the infection of my skin in my leg a few weeks ago, if I hadn't had antibiotics.

30:03.710 --> 30:04.831
And so this,

30:05.950 --> 30:10.592
pus-filled uterus is what a pyometra is.

30:11.353 --> 30:15.675
And the reason why it occurs in dogs is more complicated than I knew.

30:16.415 --> 30:22.938
And we had been and talked to multiple veterinarians who could not bring us to that understanding.

30:23.018 --> 30:28.221
So what's really interesting is that this understanding is also what underlies

30:31.488 --> 30:36.310
the ethical principle and argument for using alternative treatments to surgery.

30:36.370 --> 30:39.532
So what's the real biology of a pyometra?

30:39.572 --> 30:45.935
So if you, if you just think of a dog and the hind legs, okay.

30:46.275 --> 30:49.937
And then you think of the uterus, the uterus is something that if you could draw it in

30:50.965 --> 31:15.731
in shape it's just kind of like two horns and so if you were looking from above like this from from above from down then the two horns would be i believe something like this you know they're just they but they curve and because the uterus has you know some shape to it um then here's the opening out here and so this is not drawn right because there wouldn't be one on the bottom and one on the top they're like left and right

31:16.925 --> 31:22.206
But if you look from above, it would look like this in the back of the dog, and then here would be the tail, right?

31:22.707 --> 31:25.807
So this is the uterus, not drawn to scale or anything like that.

31:25.847 --> 31:32.429
They're about a centimeter and a half across in a healthy dog in Ruby.

31:32.469 --> 31:34.790
But because she has old dogs, she has some cysts.

31:35.350 --> 31:40.951
And because she's never had a litter, the wall of the uterus is thicker than a younger dog.

31:41.631 --> 31:44.332
And what's really interesting is that unlike your

31:45.032 --> 31:54.298
your females, like we know best, our female humans, that shed their uterine wall every estrous cycle, every menstrual cycle.

31:54.818 --> 31:57.700
The wall of the uterus, the uterine lining is shed.

31:57.740 --> 32:03.844
And that's what the menstrual cycle is that from a man's perspective that we understand, right?

32:03.884 --> 32:06.866
That's the reason why you need to clean up.

32:08.407 --> 32:11.569
And that process doesn't happen in dogs.

32:13.103 --> 32:14.365
It's something that I didn't know.

32:15.908 --> 32:17.691
That process doesn't happen in dogs.

32:17.731 --> 32:19.635
It only happens when they give birth.

32:20.537 --> 32:24.524
And so a dog that has never given birth has had, and I don't know what the right

32:25.476 --> 32:27.396
right layer of the uterus is.

32:27.456 --> 32:35.398
But that uterus and uterine wall has been thickening and thickening every estrous cycle or every whatever cycle you would call it.

32:35.438 --> 32:36.498
Again, I'm not a veterinarian.

32:36.538 --> 32:41.039
I'm just an armchair biologist on the internet with a dog and with kids.

32:41.560 --> 32:47.981
And this infection, okay, it fills the whole uterus with pus.

32:48.081 --> 32:52.402
And if the cervix is closed, which it is closed all the time in a dog,

32:53.575 --> 32:54.336
It's always closed.

32:54.376 --> 32:56.759
The cervix only opens when you need to give birth.

32:58.281 --> 33:03.487
And so, if you get an infection in here, because again, you're, you have

33:05.614 --> 33:10.736
The cycle happens, you become more vulnerable to infection.

33:10.776 --> 33:23.520
And also, apparently, our veterinarian told us that there is something called a uterine milk, which is produced, which is like a highly nutritious substance, which is very favorable to bacterial growth.

33:24.060 --> 33:29.121
and also favorable to the deposition of any fertilized embryos or something like this.

33:29.201 --> 33:44.224
And it was only very cursorily explained, but suffice it to say that during this process, the uterus itself becomes more vulnerable to infection because it's a really warm and juicy and nutritious place.

33:44.904 --> 33:50.245
And usually that infection is actually infection of normal flora,

33:51.645 --> 33:55.726
E. coli that are present in the vaginal canal of the dog.

33:55.766 --> 34:08.490
And so again, I'm not going to draw all kinds of pictures here, but suffice it to say that I didn't know the anatomy of my dog and I didn't know where the cervix was and I didn't know what was on the outside and I didn't know where the urine ureter was and all this other stuff.

34:10.291 --> 34:16.533
But suffice it to say that this infection here, if it happens and it cannot come out,

34:17.568 --> 34:22.294
There's no way for it because there's no process by which this material comes out.

34:23.435 --> 34:29.282
Then the propensity for this to become a very serious infection and go to sepsis is very, it's very high.

34:30.126 --> 34:32.148
And so lots of dogs do die from this.

34:32.208 --> 34:42.237
And a closed pyometra is something where nothing is, you don't see any pus coming out, but the dog just has an incredibly swollen uterus.

34:42.537 --> 34:47.622
And then all these other symptoms, which can be vomiting and lots of drinking and panting and this kind of thing.

34:47.642 --> 34:48.643
And then you just take them to the hospital.

34:49.195 --> 34:50.336
the vet and you find this out.

34:50.736 --> 34:53.537
Ours was that there was pus coming out.

34:53.597 --> 35:00.280
So no more illustration other than that, but it was a quantity and we knew, and then we Googled it and we found out that it's an open pymetra.

35:00.821 --> 35:11.486
What our new vet told us, our latest vet, the one that we trust the most because she seems to also understand the biology, is that for some dogs, the cervix can open.

35:12.987 --> 35:17.931
And if it opens, then it will stay open until she goes through her next estrus.

35:17.971 --> 35:20.073
So this can drain out.

35:21.354 --> 35:31.102
And so the alternative treatment is to essentially use hormone to make her go through a kind of fake birth, if you will.

35:32.136 --> 35:48.804
And so I started this morning injecting her with a hormone that will make her have diarrhea and make her salivate and make her vomit a little bit or, you know, be nauseated and also cause the uterine wall to shed as if she was going to give a birth.

35:48.924 --> 35:54.567
This would be also the same process that you would use to get rid of a pregnancy in a dog that you didn't want.

35:55.868 --> 36:05.194
And so over the next seven days, we're going to try and use this to expel the infection and expel the extra material that can come out.

36:06.095 --> 36:10.658
And at the same time, she's going to be on antibiotics and this vet expects her to make it.

36:10.718 --> 36:18.783
Now, she also expects that there's a fairly high chance that on the following estrous cycle, we could have the exact same problem again.

36:18.803 --> 36:21.645
And so we may have to treat it again.

36:21.685 --> 36:24.287
We may have to make this choice again, but nevertheless,

36:27.249 --> 36:49.979
We are at the stage where somebody who gave us a swab with no ultrasound and no x-rays and no real lab tests told us that we had no alternative but an $11,000 surgery versus somebody who took the time to talk to us for an hour and 15 minutes, did a sonogram or a

36:51.920 --> 36:52.400
Is that what you call it?

36:52.480 --> 36:55.463
Ultrasound, excuse me, not sonogram, I guess it's ultrasound.

36:56.063 --> 37:02.328
Ultrasound and showed us that it was only one side of the uterus, showed us that it wasn't crazy distended yet at all.

37:04.009 --> 37:09.773
And that she expected Ruby to be fine this time around.

37:10.634 --> 37:15.698
And so it's an extraordinary place to be now because of course we have all of these

37:17.588 --> 37:20.129
this new level of understanding of how to care for our dog.

37:20.149 --> 37:36.675
We have a new level of understanding of the biology of our dog, but more importantly, we found this little tiny example of at least 20 professionals that I'm sure are in that job because they love animals.

37:36.775 --> 37:45.479
I'm sure they are in that job because they love biology that actually don't understand the biology of female dogs.

37:46.886 --> 38:04.795
that don't understand the biology of open and closed pyometras, that don't understand the possibility that the idea that I had, which was flush this uterus out, is not something that this vet that we talked to and now trust thought was a good idea.

38:05.015 --> 38:09.818
Even though she could tell us that she had a colleague actually that had done a

38:11.184 --> 38:17.806
a paper about going in through the abdomen and perfusing the uterus by making a hole in it.

38:18.286 --> 38:25.869
So you would, he would essentially go in through the abdomen and then make a hole right here and then perfuse out.

38:26.609 --> 38:28.790
And I guess you had to do it on both horns then.

38:29.330 --> 38:32.072
and then perfuse out with some kind of saline rinse.

38:32.533 --> 38:37.156
And apparently that worked, but that would be almost as invasive as doing the surgery.

38:37.176 --> 38:46.904
Well, not almost, but it would be similarly invasive because you'd still have to put the animal under, there would still be an incision and incisions in the uterus, and that would all have to go without infection.

38:48.525 --> 38:54.610
But nonetheless, this was an alternative treatment because again, you could maybe save the uterus so that this animal could breed again.

38:54.650 --> 38:56.292
And that's why we ended up going to this

38:58.792 --> 39:04.182
this person because I had this crazy idea that why can't we just rinse it out?

39:05.284 --> 39:11.236
Especially because this other vets told us that you can give her antibiotics, but the antibiotics won't go to her uterus anyway.

39:12.318 --> 39:15.700
And so, then my first thing was, well, why can't we get them to the uterus?

39:15.780 --> 39:16.560
I don't understand.

39:16.700 --> 39:23.604
And so, anyway, when we were talking about this, she told me this story about a paper that one of her colleagues had done.

39:24.304 --> 39:31.248
She had been in academia as a vet during COVID, and then that ended during COVID.

39:31.926 --> 39:40.373
And although she didn't give me any details, it did feel like as though one of the reasons why she left is because she was just tired of the students and the lack of thinking.

39:41.454 --> 39:44.116
And so she wasn't surprised with our story.

39:44.637 --> 39:46.278
She was surprised with the 9 to $11,000 quote.

39:49.420 --> 39:54.603
Her explanation of our dog and her biology was absolutely spectacular.

39:55.144 --> 39:59.986
She had a very talented vet tech that was following her around and doing a lot of the work.

40:00.286 --> 40:08.671
And when we left, I said, do yourself a favor and try to apprentice with this woman as long as they will physically allow you to do it.

40:10.232 --> 40:15.034
Because she wasn't a young lady, you know, she was as old, older than me, I would guess.

40:16.824 --> 40:20.148
And very, very, very, very, very knowledgeable.

40:21.590 --> 40:28.959
And what I really liked a lot was when she figured out or when we, you know, kind of let her know that we were doing a lot of the reading and that we weren't complete monkeys.

40:30.060 --> 40:34.746
She took it way farther than she needed to take it, and especially with regard to explaining

40:35.787 --> 40:38.388
the hormone that we're using now and the dangers of it.

40:38.448 --> 40:43.231
Like, you know, don't let your kids or yourself get poked by this needle, that kind of thing.

40:44.551 --> 40:47.252
It's really crazy though, ladies and gentlemen.

40:47.292 --> 40:52.255
It's absolutely crazy for me to humbly realize that, you know, what did I expect?

40:53.675 --> 40:54.636
What did I really expect?

40:54.656 --> 41:01.279
Did I think that I was going to go to a vet and I would get the informed consent that I can't get at my own pediatrician?

41:02.540 --> 41:03.961
course, I shouldn't have expected that.

41:04.001 --> 41:05.621
But that's kind of what I thought I would get.

41:06.602 --> 41:22.229
I kind of thought that my wife would would, upon searching for an alternative vet, that she would find somebody who would understand that not every answer is a knife, not every every nail needs a hammer or whatever the right analogy is.

41:22.309 --> 41:25.190
And wow, I mean, wow.

41:26.291 --> 41:30.112
It just kept going up the quote for what was necessary just kept going up.

41:30.152 --> 41:31.373
That was the only consistent

41:32.412 --> 41:33.132
sort of trend.

41:35.254 --> 41:40.837
And so the trick was here is that this is a hospital that deals with breeders.

41:40.937 --> 41:46.520
So we saw a guy there that had a whole bucket full of Persian cat kittens, which was really hilarious.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.541
Shout out to, what was his name?

41:49.681 --> 41:50.762
Smushed Face.

41:51.742 --> 41:52.703
Smushed Face

41:54.226 --> 41:57.353
Persians I think it's what it is smushed face Persians.

41:57.393 --> 42:04.249
I've never looked it up, but I'm Facebook apparently that's the dude They were really beautiful little cats and then there was also a lady that was bringing her new

42:05.390 --> 42:07.652
new puppy Dobermans in there.

42:08.213 --> 42:16.340
And so the reason why we went there, long story short, is because I had this idea that, you know, why can't we irrigate, you know, and I don't want to do it myself.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.282
Maybe we can find somebody who will do it.

42:18.803 --> 42:24.868
And so this vet was Reproductive Services, and so Phila kind of called and said, hey, we got this

42:25.549 --> 42:52.587
female and you know this is our story this is why we don't want to put her under the knife and we saw that you guys do this would do you have any could you help us and they just made an appointment an hour and a half later with this woman we were leaving feeling like a quadzillion dollars and it was because like the old adage goes you better have a mechanic you better have a lawyer you better have a doctor and if you've got a

42:54.234 --> 43:09.887
giant breed dog you better darn well be sure to have a vet you trust because otherwise on Friday already you know she could have been 50% likely dead on the table or a few days later from infection

43:13.826 --> 43:17.908
And we would have been down, you know, 10 grand or something like that, or in the debt, 10 grand.

43:17.948 --> 43:21.630
I mean, what kind of, what kind of choice is that to offer people?

43:21.690 --> 43:28.054
And, and I don't think it's actually very realistic from the perspective of, you know, what I can tell what I know.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.376
It's just extraordinary, you know, this, this.

43:35.202 --> 43:44.587
this very much is in sync with this idea that you can't expect informed consent from your pediatrician, you can't expect informed consent from your vet anymore.

43:45.208 --> 43:57.374
It is actually imperative that all of us take responsibility for understanding before we seek expert advice, before we seek help.

43:58.995 --> 44:02.197
And that is what I think right now makes books

44:03.513 --> 44:07.275
and primary literature and downloading things and printing things.

44:08.036 --> 44:09.737
Very, very, very important.

44:11.238 --> 44:15.100
Because the best way to educate yourself is to grab a book and read it.

44:16.501 --> 44:18.883
Go outside in the sun and read.

44:19.563 --> 44:23.646
Wake up in the morning, go out on the porch and read.

44:25.127 --> 44:26.488
None of us are doing it anymore.

44:26.628 --> 44:29.790
Well, I am, but none of us are doing it anymore.

44:29.950 --> 44:31.731
I have a very strict regiment of

44:32.668 --> 44:39.417
engaging with X for fun and for prodding to make sure that people have to keep working.

44:42.300 --> 44:51.792
And then after that, I'm really trying very hard to get into a ridiculously good habit of being present regularly here.

44:53.436 --> 45:01.498
But, you know, if you're a dog owner, you know what we were going through this weekend, you know what we were looking at, because everybody was telling us that it was time and it happened to happen right now.

45:01.558 --> 45:05.579
And if the longer you wait, the more likely it was to get very, very, very dangerous.

45:08.000 --> 45:18.623
And she was sick, you know, I mean, before she started taking the antibiotics and honey and turmeric and vitamin C and ivermectin, she was very sick and her nose was hot.

45:18.703 --> 45:22.764
Her ears were hot and she was huffing and, you know, wobbly and the whole thing.

45:23.479 --> 45:33.281
And now when V comes home from her class, Ruby will stand up and run out there and be as waggy as she was a year ago.

45:34.121 --> 45:45.844
So it's really extraordinary the luck that we've had, that my prayers were answered in the form of either a combination of

45:47.327 --> 45:55.651
natural antibiotics, and probiotics, and pharmaceuticals, and whatever, and prayer.

45:56.252 --> 45:57.452
That's all I can really tell you.

45:58.693 --> 46:04.276
So keeping this going, the other thing that I wanted to do was look at this.

46:06.177 --> 46:07.157
Let me see if this works.

46:08.478 --> 46:13.000
Look at this video and the associated paper with this.

46:14.980 --> 46:20.541
switching gears here, I will... this would be this one, right?

46:20.581 --> 46:20.781
Yeah.

46:21.541 --> 46:29.303
I will say that on TWIV a couple days ago, they covered this article, which is an article about norovirus.

46:29.363 --> 46:35.364
If you're not familiar with norovirus, norovirus is a virus that they apparently find in the guts of children.

46:36.264 --> 46:40.465
And if we go down here, we can read that human noroviruses are the leading cause of

46:41.897 --> 46:42.717
I see you over there.

46:43.378 --> 47:00.005
Leading global cause of childhood diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis in all age groups attributed to a remarkable 685 million cases and the deaths of 50 to 200,000 young children each year.

47:00.025 --> 47:10.250
Those are some pretty extraordinary stats from a virus that essentially we don't even talk about before very, very, very recently.

47:11.007 --> 47:16.688
I heard about it a little bit when we were living in Norway, but only in the context of the daycare centers.

47:17.849 --> 47:22.430
There were a couple times they talked about how norovirus was going around the daycare centers.

47:22.450 --> 47:25.491
I have the feeling that this might be... Hey!

47:25.611 --> 47:26.531
Come here, Bebert!

47:27.251 --> 47:28.471
Hey!

47:28.631 --> 47:29.492
Come and say fajir.

47:30.232 --> 47:30.892
Hello, babe.

47:31.612 --> 47:32.052
How are you?

47:32.212 --> 47:33.293
Careful, don't trip on those.

47:33.993 --> 47:34.453
Hello, babe.

47:35.305 --> 47:37.346
This is the big, big happy dog.

47:38.587 --> 47:39.188
Here she is.

47:40.068 --> 47:40.749
Coming in here.

47:40.769 --> 47:41.529
Hutso, babe.

47:42.070 --> 47:43.030
I'm glad you came in here.

47:43.971 --> 47:47.434
Wanted to say hi, but I didn't want to call you in here, because you know you were sleeping and stuff.

47:48.174 --> 47:48.374
Yeah.

47:48.795 --> 47:49.515
Hutka down, babe.

47:53.438 --> 47:54.058
That's her.

47:54.078 --> 47:56.780
Oh, this feels good, huh?

47:58.862 --> 47:59.382
Ja, is he good?

48:08.482 --> 48:10.468
Don't trip over the books.

48:10.488 --> 48:10.829
Sorry, honey

48:17.642 --> 48:19.143
Yes, so what was I saying?

48:19.203 --> 48:19.643
Here we go.

48:21.424 --> 48:22.505
So anyway, norovirus.

48:22.545 --> 48:23.986
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right.

48:24.666 --> 48:28.068
What I want to watch is the idea of what's going on here.

48:28.128 --> 48:29.949
Now remember, we're going to go all the way back.

48:32.170 --> 48:34.852
This is Biology 101, right?

48:34.932 --> 48:45.498
So I want to recall again, if you don't mind, the idea that in Biology 101, which I've been trying to introduce over the last three programs,

48:46.938 --> 48:57.063
They typically introduce biology in terms of different layers of analysis, different levels of analysis.

48:57.583 --> 49:05.647
And they might go from genes, to RNA, to protein, to cells, to tissue, to organs, to organism, to population, ecosystems, biosphere.

49:06.227 --> 49:15.312
And then what I tried to explain over the last couple of days was that reductionist science and the strategy of using reductionist

49:17.071 --> 49:35.340
a strategy of a reductionism has propelled us into a level of false understanding that is based on selecting a few variables from a couple different levels of analysis and then telling a story about them.

49:35.380 --> 49:38.601
And what I tried to say to you is that I'm a PhD.

49:38.681 --> 49:41.863
I did my postdoc and stuff in the mouse and in rats.

49:42.762 --> 49:45.363
in the brain on channels.

49:46.183 --> 49:47.343
And so that was my thing.

49:47.403 --> 49:52.304
I was going to tell stories about the brain of mice and channels.

49:53.105 --> 50:07.028
So in SK channels, glutamate channels, GABA channels, whatever it was that I was going to talk about, that would have been my shtick for the remainder of my career, combining questions in a mouse brain about channels.

50:07.950 --> 50:20.813
and then trying to go all the way back to talk about how organisms work and how disease works and how dysregulation of the brain leads to disease or leads to Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or any of these things, right?

50:20.853 --> 50:21.613
That's the idea.

50:22.033 --> 50:36.396
Maybe even which channels involved in autism could be asked simply by taking a mouse, saying you're studying its brain and looking at a channel that might be involved in autism because its gene has been associated with autism.

50:37.728 --> 50:47.213
And so I tried to use an analogy of the exhaust of an automobile and correlating the heavy metal content or the temperature with the speed of the car.

50:47.734 --> 50:55.038
And you could be a biologist for a long time making those correlations and teach students how to do it and get grants and et cetera.

50:55.058 --> 51:05.584
And the same basic thing is done with the irreducible complexity of our own biology through a reductionist methodology.

51:06.345 --> 51:20.389
where a couple variables from a couple different levels of complexity are chosen and then monitored, and then correlation with outcome is misconstrued as understanding, misconstrued as insight.

51:24.350 --> 51:32.473
And so one of the things that is often missing from these investigations is not only the limitation of this reductionist

51:33.789 --> 51:47.918
strategy, but also the limitation of this one-dimensional description of the layers of complexity, because actually the layers of complexity change in their physical manifestation.

51:47.958 --> 52:02.989
The physics of them change as we move through these different, you know, what are basically arbitrary divisions in complexity or arbitrary divisions in analysis are not

52:03.874 --> 52:09.458
They're not equivalent physics in terms of size and in terms of time and in terms of scale.

52:10.719 --> 52:11.539
Which means what?

52:11.880 --> 52:13.701
You can't just be a biologist.

52:13.741 --> 52:15.602
You must also be a chemist.

52:16.102 --> 52:27.710
You must also be a physicist, at least insofar as understanding the limitations on biology placed on it by physics, the limitations of biology placed on it by chemistry.

52:28.411 --> 52:31.313
One must have these prerequisite understandings

52:32.779 --> 52:41.064
before you can usefully pursue even a rudimentary appreciation of this irreducible complexity.

52:41.164 --> 52:58.735
And the trick of Biology 101 at universities around the world right now is to suggest to the students, to make the students accept the idea that this reductionist selection, this reductionist philosophy has resulted in the progress

53:00.586 --> 53:02.807
of mankind's understanding of himself.

53:05.588 --> 53:06.108
That's wrong.

53:06.748 --> 53:08.869
Ruby, you're starting to do laps around here.

53:08.889 --> 53:10.089
I don't know what's going on.

53:10.129 --> 53:10.889
What's happening here?

53:10.909 --> 53:12.510
Why are you going back and forth all the time?

53:13.210 --> 53:15.511
You're starting to seem like you're very healthy.

53:16.331 --> 53:17.252
I don't know what's going on.

53:17.292 --> 53:18.752
You're sleeping all the time.

53:19.572 --> 53:22.874
Now you're freaking out, coming in here, bothering me.

53:22.894 --> 53:24.694
I'm trying to do some work.

53:25.354 --> 53:30.116
I can't do work if there's going to be some great big huff and puff bat dog coming in here all the time bothering me.

53:30.782 --> 53:31.522
You big troublemaker.

53:32.242 --> 53:32.623
Yeah, you.

53:33.203 --> 53:48.787
One of the very interesting side effects of the drug that I gave her today, the hormone that I gave her today, is apparently when she has puppies, if she were to have had puppies in this life, she would have dug a hole for them.

53:49.608 --> 53:55.049
Because I've never seen her dig like she dug this morning after that first injection.

53:55.109 --> 53:59.171
And I guess it's only going to get worse because the dose is supposed to ramp up over the next few days.

54:00.431 --> 54:00.611
Huh?

54:01.263 --> 54:03.303
Yeah, the third day is supposed to be the worst.

54:04.003 --> 54:12.745
So you have another injection tonight at seven o'clock, and then a little more tomorrow twice, and then a little more on Wednesday twice, and then it goes down again.

54:12.845 --> 54:15.105
So if we have a bad day, it's going to be Wednesday, huh?

54:15.806 --> 54:15.986
Yeah.

54:16.446 --> 54:17.006
Hutzo, babe.

54:17.706 --> 54:18.066
Hutzo.

54:19.326 --> 54:19.566
Yeah?

54:20.066 --> 54:20.386
Hutzo.

54:20.426 --> 54:21.287
Don't trip over the books.

54:22.107 --> 54:28.828
So yes, what I'm trying to express here is the idea that this separation

54:30.083 --> 54:33.135
this compartmentalization of our understanding that I've...

54:33.973 --> 54:48.038
you know, become aware of in myself in biology is compounded by the idea that comparatively few people enter biology with the requisite knowledge to appreciate that this is really an exercise in reverence.

54:48.098 --> 54:54.300
It's not an exercise in dominance or understanding or revelation.

54:54.841 --> 55:01.043
This is really a, it should be a humbling exercise in complexity appreciation.

55:02.233 --> 55:07.958
And if you have the requisite physics and chemistry, I think it's natural for biology to do that.

55:08.138 --> 55:20.068
And then it's natural to see the very necessary limitations on our ability to understand anything here when we can only reasonably hold on to a few handles at a time.

55:22.710 --> 55:24.532
Make sure you're not going in the street, Ruby.

55:26.764 --> 55:27.404
That's the problem.

55:27.464 --> 55:32.527
Now that she's healthy again, I have to pay more attention because she could walk across the street right now just to say hi to somebody.

55:33.668 --> 55:43.093
Okay, so what I want to do as an exercise here in the second part of the stream is to look at a TWiV episode, which, as I said, is discussing this paper.

55:43.153 --> 55:46.235
Now, what this paper tells you is crazy.

55:46.795 --> 55:50.898
What this paper tells you is something about bile acids.

55:51.744 --> 56:05.613
and the fact that bile acids and them being altered by the microbiome can change the relative infectivity of a virus and your ability to fight it or resist its infection.

56:06.193 --> 56:15.639
And so essentially, they're going to describe a relatively new set of gears that we didn't know existed before, as if it has no consequence.

56:18.757 --> 56:27.840
as if it has no consequence to their ever increasing appreciation for the irreducible complexity of immunology.

56:27.940 --> 56:32.841
Instead, before this stream, vaccines worked.

56:33.582 --> 56:35.562
Five years ago, vaccines worked.

56:36.563 --> 56:38.103
50 years ago, vaccines worked.

56:39.603 --> 56:43.785
And that truth remains constant, irrespective of what we learn.

56:44.887 --> 56:53.133
Irrespective of how much more understanding and appreciation we get for this, it doesn't matter.

56:53.834 --> 57:07.624
To them, it doesn't matter because vaccines work, antibodies are a correlate of immunity, and those truths are going to stay true no matter how complex the biology ever gets.

57:09.226 --> 57:11.767
Doesn't matter how many gears they find.

57:11.807 --> 57:17.750
It doesn't matter if they open the watch and out falls a whole army of miniature robots.

57:18.950 --> 57:19.531
Doesn't matter.

57:20.371 --> 57:26.293
They still are convinced that what they knew about the watch before they opened it is still true.

57:28.554 --> 57:33.197
Essentially, they've told you that it doesn't matter how much sand you put in this watch, it'll still run fine.

57:33.637 --> 57:38.739
And if the watch stops after you've put some sand in it, it has nothing to do with the sand that you put in there.

57:42.338 --> 57:54.466
And even if they opened this watch and found out that what they thought was in there is not in there, it's something completely different, they would still tell you that the sand doesn't do anything to how the watch works.

57:56.867 --> 58:08.675
And we are going to witness in real time a video where these virologists that have been unequivocally advocating for the vaccine schedule across the board all the time, every week,

58:09.494 --> 58:25.982
for four and a half years of the existing plandemic, but also in place early enough so that Vincent Racaniello could have and did host Peter Daszak for a discussion about zoonosis before the pandemic.

58:29.963 --> 58:36.626
And so listen carefully, I'm not going to play the whole thing, but I do have it queued up in the right place, where they will

58:38.134 --> 58:44.678
where they will show us this and you will be amazed at what these people are capable of.

58:44.738 --> 58:46.219
It's really very extraordinary.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.861
So this, I think, is where they start.

58:50.282 --> 58:59.528
And there actually is a little comment here where you can see some dismay because they're going to say that somewhere in the world they're rolling out an oral polio vaccine.

59:00.779 --> 59:06.762
from these people perspective, the oral polio vaccine is just dumb and that everybody should be injecting.

59:07.682 --> 59:09.844
And so I won't put that into context.

59:09.904 --> 59:14.066
I won't talk about that biology today, but I just want you to know that I think that's where this is queued up.

59:14.526 --> 59:18.088
There's a brief two minute thing about the polio vaccine.

59:18.148 --> 59:21.389
And this guy down here on the bottom is kind of like, oh no, oral polio.

59:21.469 --> 59:22.990
Why aren't these people smarter?

59:23.450 --> 59:25.351
And then they go on to the norovirus paper.

59:27.472 --> 59:28.413
Oops, that's this one.

59:30.390 --> 59:37.356
So this just in, CNN reports Israel agrees to pause fighting Gaza for polio vaccination.

59:39.137 --> 59:39.477
That's good.

59:39.878 --> 59:41.019
Yeah, this is very good.

59:41.679 --> 59:42.860
Humanitarian reasons.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.101
Maybe.

59:44.121 --> 59:53.409
It would be nice if they had dealt with some of the other issues that we had mentioned with some of the other infectious diseases and everything else.

59:54.149 --> 59:59.634
So 640,000 children are going to be immunized and apparently they're using OPV.

01:00:00.749 --> 01:00:01.650
NOPV2.

01:00:03.531 --> 01:00:08.053
So, you know, it's not ideal, but that's what they're going to do.

01:00:11.595 --> 01:00:11.895
Okay.

01:00:13.336 --> 01:00:17.759
Now, we have a paper that taught me more than I ever knew about bile acids in breast milk.

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:18.459
Here we go.

01:00:18.479 --> 01:00:19.860
I know.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.262
I read this paper, and if I had had a chance, I would have spent some time with Steph Langel.

01:00:24.763 --> 01:00:25.423
Yes.

01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:28.825
I'm sure she could have provided a lot more insight.

01:00:29.412 --> 01:00:38.238
Actually, it's a mammoth study and very well written.

01:00:38.938 --> 01:00:42.801
When I started out, I know nothing about any of this stuff.

01:00:42.821 --> 01:00:44.522
Well, I know a little bit about noroviruses.

01:00:45.022 --> 01:00:51.867
But when I started out, I thought, I looked at the graphical abstract and I thought, this is going to be tough.

01:00:52.407 --> 01:00:54.669
But I got a little ways into it and I kind of got the drift.

01:00:55.545 --> 01:00:55.985
and it was good.

01:00:56.245 --> 01:00:58.586
So this is cell health and microbe.

01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:07.049
Metabolic immaturity and breast milk bile acid metabolites are central determinants of heightened newborn vulnerability to norovirus diarrhea.

01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:22.034
We have three co-first authors, Amy Piper, Joyce Morales-Aparicio, Zhang Zhang Hu, and a senior author, a former colleague of Rich's at the University of Florida Gainesville, Stephanie Karst, and our

01:01:23.007 --> 01:01:23.968
immune co-hosts.

01:01:24.068 --> 01:01:26.009
Steph Langell is on this paper as well.

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:35.474
We have people from UF Gainesville, UNC, Chapel Hill, University of Illinois, Case Western Reserve, the Jesse Brown VA in Chicago, and Emory.

01:01:35.834 --> 01:01:40.637
So it's not really about the biology at all, of course, and that's what this is all about too.

01:01:40.777 --> 01:01:41.777
I was in that system.

01:01:41.837 --> 01:01:44.679
I know exactly what's it about, the position of your authorship

01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:48.261
in that line matters in those circles.

01:01:48.361 --> 01:01:57.408
And so just getting mentioned as a co-author, getting mentioned as a co-first author, these are all important for keeping those people locked in.

01:01:58.809 --> 01:02:00.751
Because that's the game they're currently playing.

01:02:01.611 --> 01:02:04.433
So this is maximum dopamine for all those people.

01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:11.038
Getting mentioned on TWIV, would it be the equivalent, I guess, of getting mentioned on JC on a Bike in neurobiology back in 2020.

01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:13.969
Stop lying!

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:25.546
So I think this is going to be very interesting because again, Vincent Racaniello is about to say that he knows nothing about bile acids, knew nothing about breast milk, apparently knows nothing.

01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:37.453
about a whole interaction between bile and digestion and the microbiome and taurine and creatine.

01:02:38.034 --> 01:02:39.315
And it's like, wait, what?

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:39.995
And who?

01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:43.959
And I guess I just didn't know that all these gears were there.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.721
I guess I just didn't know.

01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:46.862
Isn't that crazy?

01:02:49.278 --> 01:02:57.166
But then he'll go right back to assuming that all the biology, or right back to telling you that all the biology that he has told you up until now is 100% right.

01:02:57.687 --> 01:03:01.211
He's 100% right about everything to do with viruses.

01:03:03.203 --> 01:03:09.965
because he knows nothing about digestion or the microbiome or bile or anything like that.

01:03:10.565 --> 01:03:13.406
And there are all kinds of viruses in the gut.

01:03:13.466 --> 01:03:25.189
I think actually poliovirus is also in the gut, but he knows nothing about bile and knows nothing about lipid absorption and nothing.

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:31.113
Nothing about how bio and its products are altered by the microbiome.

01:03:31.153 --> 01:03:31.753
Knows nothing.

01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:34.855
But he's supposed to be an expert on polio.

01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:40.178
He's the guy who figured out how to make an infectious clone of the polio virus.

01:03:40.198 --> 01:03:44.041
You know, a synthetic construct you could make mass quantities of.

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:49.064
Him and David Baltimore are the people that figured that out.

01:03:53.446 --> 01:03:54.627
That's what we're talking about here.

01:04:00.882 --> 01:04:01.603
Hold on one second.

01:04:05.026 --> 01:04:05.647
Oh, she's home.

01:04:07.429 --> 01:04:08.450
Mom is home.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.552
So the dog is running around.

01:04:10.592 --> 01:04:11.152
Here we go.

01:04:11.172 --> 01:04:12.994
Oops, that's this one.

01:04:14.315 --> 01:04:15.837
School of Medicine.

01:04:16.918 --> 01:04:19.761
So here's the summary, the executive summary.

01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:21.603
Neuroviruses are small

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:34.067
icosahedral plus-strand RNA viruses constructed similar to poliovirus, a nice protein shell with a plus-strand RNA inside.

01:04:34.428 --> 01:04:36.649
Non-envelope, tough as nails.

01:04:36.729 --> 01:04:37.390
Tough as nails.

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:41.053
You just, you know, they pass through your intestinal tract.

01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:46.237
You eat them and they go into your intestine, they cause diarrhea, and then they're shed in copious amounts, and that's how...

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:50.459
Other people get them and they cause vomiting and diarrhea.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:05:00.766
So it sounds like... In newborns, they're more... It would sound like to me that the primary thing that's weird is that the way that you get norovirus is that you get other people's poop in your mouth.

01:05:02.488 --> 01:05:03.608
Isn't that what it sounds like?

01:05:04.009 --> 01:05:06.270
If they replicate in your gut, then how do they get out?

01:05:10.113 --> 01:05:11.534
It sounds a lot like polio.

01:05:13.495 --> 01:05:16.137
You know, you just have to stop getting other people's poop in your mouth.

01:05:18.137 --> 01:05:27.515
which is why sanitation, water treatment were so vital to understanding what happened with polio.

01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:30.741
That's why also DDT is an interesting story.

01:05:34.045 --> 01:05:40.348
And I think we can figure out a lot if we started to think about placebo as being useful in all contexts, all the time.

01:05:40.428 --> 01:05:45.131
If you want to create an illusion of something, placebo would be one of the best ways to do it.

01:05:45.171 --> 01:05:50.454
Let's say, for example, you wanted to argue that malaria was building up a resistance to something.

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:56.037
Maybe you could just, you know, not put that something out there anymore.

01:05:57.264 --> 01:06:08.569
Because one of the things they told us, the reasons why they stopped using DDT was because insects were building up a tolerance, a resistance to it, a resistance to a chemical.

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:16.812
Like if you treated ponds with gasoline, that there would become gasoline resistant mosquito larvae.

01:06:18.993 --> 01:06:20.333
That's the essential argument.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:26.136
The DDT, a poison like DDT, you can actually get resistant mosquitoes to it.

01:06:26.954 --> 01:06:33.237
Well, if you wanted to make an argument that something that was working wasn't working anymore, maybe one of the ways to do it would be to stop using it.

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:39.199
What I'm only suggesting is that this is a narrative that no one has ever considered.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.322
And it's always a narrative that could be used against us from a national security perspective.

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:54.040
If you wanted people to believe that you had made a nuclear weapon and dropped it, would you need to drop a nuclear bomb?

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.901
Really ask yourself, would you need to?

01:06:56.502 --> 01:07:07.409
Independent of whether you actually could make one, would you really need to drop one to convince somebody that you had if you had an illusion of consensus that would lie about it?

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.852
Wittingly or unwittingly, no, you wouldn't need to.

01:07:10.912 --> 01:07:16.776
You could make a gigantic bomb, a regular gigantic bomb, nobody knows,

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:22.229
what 10,000 tons of TNT looks like.

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:27.871
Nobody knows what a great big hydrogen bomb or a great big whatever neutron bomb looks like.

01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:35.753
And so you make a great big fire bomb and you put some radioactive material in it and you claim that it was a nuclear bomb.

01:07:35.993 --> 01:07:38.073
I'm not suggesting that I know.

01:07:39.574 --> 01:07:43.255
What I'm suggesting to you is, is that in almost all cases,

01:07:44.926 --> 01:07:59.031
There is a very parsimonious and easy way where normal physics, normal chemistry, and lying could be used to create something that mankind would have a real hard time creating with physics and chemistry.

01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:13.357
We have a current example right now of gain-of-function research and an RNA pandemic where a biology that I believe is impossible is being

01:08:14.676 --> 01:08:30.064
coercively taught to our children through media and through social media and through our own naivety because these people have agreed to lie about the potential that RNA can have if it is stitched together in the right way by the right people with the right motives.

01:08:31.525 --> 01:08:42.891
Instead of these people explaining to you that the main danger is that we can make kilograms of this stuff using all of the standard equipment that pharmaceuticals use to make biologics.

01:08:45.219 --> 01:08:59.489
And so we could start transfecting and transforming humans all around the world and tell everybody it was virology and even use the wonderful bonus that there's these sequences around and then tell everybody openly what sequences we're tracking.

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:12.059
So we're really in a situation now where this breakthrough threshold of understanding can occur.

01:09:13.055 --> 01:09:16.437
And it can occur because these people are so trapped.

01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:36.028
These people are so trapped by a lifetime in exactly the same way that I was trapped by a lifetime of dedication to these small, focused questions that, as William Briggs would point out in his course, are an assumption based on an assumption based on an assumption.

01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:37.269
And then here's where you're testing.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:43.430
And so these people with the no virus thing, they're not wrong about isolation.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.032
They're not wrong about purification.

01:09:45.072 --> 01:09:47.714
I think they're wrong about transfection and transformation.

01:09:48.174 --> 01:09:49.956
And I think they're ignoring it on purpose.

01:09:50.016 --> 01:09:51.357
And I don't understand why.

01:09:52.218 --> 01:09:58.744
Because transformation and transfection are the way that the illusion of virology is created.

01:09:58.944 --> 01:10:04.909
Yes, the false isolation and the false purification are also part of it.

01:10:06.274 --> 01:10:34.242
But if you don't take that to the necessary conclusion that because RNA can't pandemic, because RNA is only detected as a shadow in nature, and that these people are lying about what they find in bat caves and what they find in their laboratories, but the only real thing they can do is produce quantities of pure DNA and pure RNA that they can then study as a transformation or a transfection product or result,

01:10:37.096 --> 01:10:41.677
And we don't acknowledge that part, we just focus on the no virus part.

01:10:41.717 --> 01:10:44.838
We are playing the same game that these people play.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:54.440
When they talk about how, I didn't know anything about bio, and I didn't know anything about bio acids, and all this stuff is new to me, but that doesn't matter.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:01.702
I still understand immunology well enough to know that vaccines work, and they work as well as airplanes can fly and wheels can roll.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.849
Even though I don't know jack about the microbiome.

01:11:06.869 --> 01:11:07.510
I don't know jack.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:14.897
I haven't even thought about the idea that if there's a microbiome that interacts with us, then what about all the bacteriophages that interact with our microbiome?

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:26.388
And how would we differentiate between the effects of a bacteriophage moving through our microbiome and expressing a protein that our body reacts to versus a viral protein or a bacterial protein?

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:27.249
How do we tell the difference?

01:11:31.127 --> 01:11:36.132
These people just assume that everything that they know, assume, assume, assume, assume, assume, assume, those are all true.

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:42.618
And so now we've got to add this new data that I know to the assumptions that I already are not willing to question.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:12:04.646
And so instead of revising the model of the world that they have with regard to RNA pandemics and RNA viruses and positive stranded viruses and negative stranded viruses, once they found out that there was a RNA dependent RNA polymerase in our own cells and say, well, then maybe we're wrong about these things.

01:12:04.706 --> 01:12:11.208
And maybe these signals, the endogenous, you know, homolog of these signals is more important than we ever imagined.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:14.146
They don't say any of it.

01:12:14.367 --> 01:12:41.479
They can't get there because they are as trapped as I was and as trapped as all the other biologists are who still haven't realized that transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always criminally negligent from the very beginning and that they themselves could have known and spoke out and saved potentially thousands if not millions of lives around the world had the rollout effectively been stopped by any one of us

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:46.655
that spoke up, but it wasn't because there were too few speaking up.

01:12:47.476 --> 01:13:04.233
And more importantly, there are still too few today speaking up with the right words, with the right argument that shows that both sides are guilty, that both sides have people that have been collaborating to make sure we don't get out.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:23.649
And that's why I've been so harsh on Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and CHD and these people who, despite years of interacting with me, have still not come to realize that the most important thing that nobody understands is that we can make kilograms of DNA and kilograms of RNA.

01:13:24.049 --> 01:13:27.912
We can stitch it together and we can put it anywhere we want to and claim to have found it.

01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:53.109
And that if any of those proteins were bioactive, immunogenic, that the symptomology created by that transformation or that transfection could be misconstrued as the presence of a virus simply because we have people that are willing to say that a spike protein is a coronavirus, that an end protein is a coronavirus, or that the PCR detected equivalent is a coronavirus.

01:13:53.809 --> 01:13:56.131
And yes, the no virus people are wrong about that.

01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:58.392
I mean, right about that, that that's a lie.

01:14:00.179 --> 01:14:10.525
The no-virus people also seem to be incapable of saying that all virology that has any reproducibility starts with synthetic DNA and RNA.

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:14.007
Like the SARS Urbani strain.

01:14:15.908 --> 01:14:18.770
That's the real place they need to take the tree down.

01:14:19.951 --> 01:14:20.491
But they don't.

01:14:21.598 --> 01:14:32.406
They take it down with the semantics, with the isolation and the purification, which means they're still essentially playing in the same arena of magic because the whole thing is an enchantment of words.

01:14:34.007 --> 01:14:50.240
And the uniform and universal agreement to use those words and agree that sometimes they don't make sense, but we use those words anyway, like vaccine, like immunize, like disease, like virus,

01:14:54.721 --> 01:14:57.703
Let's keep going because this is really interesting when he actually says it.

01:14:58.324 --> 01:14:58.804
Severe.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:00.466
So people want to know why.

01:15:00.526 --> 01:15:10.534
In this paper, they show that the metabolic immaturity of newborns and the presence of bile acids in breast milk

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:16.634
are some reasons why newborns are more vulnerable.

01:15:16.674 --> 01:15:26.568
Now, we're talking about mice here mainly, but they do try and extend it to humans whenever they can because there are some data in humans that are sort of congruent with what they find in mice.

01:15:27.429 --> 01:15:28.471
So, the idea would be

01:15:30.123 --> 01:15:32.724
Maybe you could, and they do this experimentally.

01:15:32.764 --> 01:15:36.146
They target maternal and neonatal bile acid metabolism.

01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:38.747
They can protect newborns from a norovirus disease.

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:56.276
So you're gonna learn a lot about bile acids and what they do and a little bit about breast milk, which we all say is great and is great, but there's one negative here, as you will see, and it can make, at least in mice, norovirus disease worse.

01:15:56.998 --> 01:16:00.782
Maybe in a community where there is a... In mice!

01:16:00.802 --> 01:16:01.363
Here we go!

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:04.846
So in mice, breast milk can make norovirus infection work.

01:16:05.267 --> 01:16:06.027
Stop lying!

01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:06.648
Here we go.

01:16:07.128 --> 01:16:09.591
Terrible norovirus epidemic.

01:16:10.011 --> 01:16:12.073
You could also use that to help... That's right.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:18.440
And so just to bring this home for those of you

01:16:20.069 --> 01:16:25.472
who are unfamiliar with this, this is the cruise ship virus.

01:16:26.272 --> 01:16:35.297
And even if you've never been on a cruise, if you've stayed up all night throwing up with your kids, you've had this disease.

01:16:35.697 --> 01:16:37.838
Everybody gets this eventually.

01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:41.240
It's the most common now that rotavirus

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:45.583
is basically suppressed with vaccination.

01:16:45.983 --> 01:16:50.307
It is the most common cause of gastroenteritis, right?

01:16:50.467 --> 01:16:57.333
Known among the cognoscenti as the two bucket disease.

01:16:58.334 --> 01:16:59.915
So these are all just nonsense.

01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:05.960
He's regurgitating the introduction of the paper, claiming that it's a common thing known now, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.723
And then he gives credit to Paul Offit for getting rid of rotavirus.

01:17:09.983 --> 01:17:10.283
It is

01:17:11.403 --> 01:17:13.304
Nothing short of extraordinary, of course.

01:17:13.384 --> 01:17:24.790
Remember, the reason why we're doing this is because we want to get back to this idea that these people are kind of picking and choosing a couple layers of analysis.

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.691
In this case, we're going to talk about mice.

01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:31.653
And we're going to talk about the gut microbiome as it relates to bile acids.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.174
And we're going to measure a couple of those.

01:17:33.214 --> 01:17:33.654
That's it.

01:17:34.295 --> 01:17:34.935
Nothing more.

01:17:35.555 --> 01:17:36.816
It's all going to be proxies.

01:17:38.194 --> 01:17:42.762
And we don't know, you know, this is a mouse model of human disease.

01:17:42.782 --> 01:17:45.466
It's really, really extraordinary what's happening here.

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:46.909
Okay.

01:17:50.347 --> 01:18:00.171
I'm thinking of various humorous posters around Stephanie's lab saying, no two-bucket disease here.

01:18:00.671 --> 01:18:01.712
So there's no vaccine.

01:18:01.852 --> 01:18:04.373
There are vaccines being worked on, but we don't have one yet.

01:18:04.393 --> 01:18:05.333
We don't have antivirals.

01:18:05.373 --> 01:18:08.655
So if someone is vomiting with diarrhea, you have to keep them hydrated.

01:18:09.537 --> 01:18:12.539
And you can't just give them water, right, because they're losing electrolytes.

01:18:12.559 --> 01:18:15.060
So you have to do like Pedialyte or something like that.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:20.903
And, you know, in some many countries it's possible, but in many countries it's not.

01:18:21.283 --> 01:18:22.283
So babies die.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.044
There are 685 million cases a year.

01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:24.865
Unbelievable.

01:18:24.885 --> 01:18:26.826
50,000 to 200,000 deaths in young children every year.

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:33.644
So this is a big problem.

01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:42.689
Now, we know that the gut microbiome is important in regulating enteric virus infections of all sorts.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:47.152
And in particular, so it's not just the bacteria, but it's their metabolites that do this.

01:18:48.052 --> 01:18:50.554
And that's what we're going to talk about in part in this paper.

01:18:50.614 --> 01:18:57.298
So neuroviruses bind a specific metabolite called a bile acid.

01:18:58.078 --> 01:18:59.300
Okay, here we go.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.826
I don't know anything about ballast, but I'm going to tell you what the authors say.

01:19:03.047 --> 01:19:11.821
Well, I also think that people should be aware that that's relatively new information.

01:19:13.254 --> 01:19:16.716
You know, I think 2018 is the earliest paper they cite about that.

01:19:17.577 --> 01:19:20.879
For a long time, this was something that was not really known.

01:19:22.119 --> 01:19:28.943
And there are some difficulties working with norovirus in the lab that contribute to that.

01:19:29.023 --> 01:19:36.127
And so, you can also realize that we're just now figuring out what to do about this two-bucket disease.

01:19:36.907 --> 01:19:41.090
Yeah, as a matter of fact, let me elaborate a little bit on this model.

01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:43.292
Brianne triggered this.

01:19:45.193 --> 01:19:47.755
You cannot grow the human virus in the laboratory.

01:19:48.135 --> 01:19:51.458
What we know about the human virus and its infection

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:59.750
was learned by infecting volunteers with the virus.

01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:08.301
So, this mouse model is not, it's cool.

01:20:09.082 --> 01:20:18.305
in that it's not like, ordinarily when we talk about mouse models, we're talking about taking a human virus or a virus from some other animal and sticking it in a mouse.

01:20:18.705 --> 01:20:22.166
No, this is a mouse norovirus.

01:20:22.326 --> 01:20:29.968
So it's what I would call a, well, I don't know what to call it, but it's the host and the virus are

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:35.349
It's a natural virus of this host of mice.

01:20:35.369 --> 01:20:43.532
Okay, and so he's not even really saying it a very Very coyly in the sense of you know, it's a mouse model.

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:49.795
This is a mouse gut virus We don't even they're not even gonna bother to differentiate where the virus replicates.

01:20:49.835 --> 01:20:53.196
They don't care The assumption is it replicates in the mouse?

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:58.258
It could be a bacteriophage for all they know It's very tough

01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:00.799
It's the cruise ship virus.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.542
And this is a mouse model of it.

01:21:03.622 --> 01:21:05.764
So there is a mouse equivalent virus.

01:21:06.465 --> 01:21:09.529
And the idea is that this is specific for mice.

01:21:09.569 --> 01:21:13.053
This is a mouse specific homologue of our own system.

01:21:14.334 --> 01:21:15.596
And they do that a lot.

01:21:16.036 --> 01:21:17.558
You know what else they did it a lot with?

01:21:17.638 --> 01:21:18.039
Yeast.

01:21:19.554 --> 01:21:25.141
Like when they found mechanisms in yeast that caused cell division or reorganization of the DNA.

01:21:25.161 --> 01:21:28.244
And then they looked for homologs of those genes in humans and found them.

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:34.852
Then they portrayed that as, look, see, we understand cell division in yeast and the same mechanisms are used in you.

01:21:35.253 --> 01:21:38.417
And so, you know, it's basically your yeast only stuck together.

01:21:40.486 --> 01:21:42.407
There were Nobel prizes given away for that.

01:21:42.487 --> 01:21:54.176
In fact, the idea of prions is almost exclusively based on yeast biology and this idea that the homologue of what's happening in yeast is prions in humans.

01:21:57.378 --> 01:22:10.087
And so make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, these people are trapped inside of this layer upon layer upon layer of assumption which starts, actually starts here at the genes to proteins

01:22:12.216 --> 01:22:19.139
to cells, to tissues, and this assumption that right down here at the bottom is all you need to know.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:28.463
And that if this can be correlated with something up here, then you understand the something up here because you understand that it's related to this.

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:40.249
These are considered first causes, even though they might just be exhaust or the heavy metal content of the exhaust of the car.

01:22:41.983 --> 01:22:44.385
Now, obviously, I don't think that that's the case.

01:22:44.546 --> 01:23:00.201
But what I'm trying to suggest is that the correlation between observations at this level and observations at this level have been misconstrued as high-fidelity understanding that makes us only about 10 years away from ending disease and being able to upload our consciousness.

01:23:00.261 --> 01:23:01.702
And those are lies.

01:23:02.622 --> 01:23:10.350
that Elon Musk tells, that Kurtzweiler tells, that Fauci tells, that Daisak tells, that Robert Malone tells.

01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:20.160
And Robert Malone has been telling himself lies like that since he trained with these people in the retrovirus age, trained with people like Murray Gardner and

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:43.640
and Gallo and Baltimore, all the same people that are responsible for defining virology as outside of us, hiding exosomal communication, the small packet genetic communication that occurs locally in the brain and probably systemically between the gut and the brain and between the immune system and all healthy and diseased tissues.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:57.667
And that's probably why that dude that was taking like $50,000 a month from the Communist Party in China from Harvard was working on nanosignaling, nanotechnology that could read nanosignals.

01:23:57.827 --> 01:24:11.517
Because the only way to usefully probe what's going on inside of our bodies at this packet level of communication genetically with RNA and DNA would be able to be able to kind of sample it all in real time.

01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:27.398
not very dissimilar to the new technology that's going rampant right now, the nanopore sequencing, where we don't need to use PCR with known amplicons and known primers to amplify a known sequence in order to sequence something anymore.

01:24:27.899 --> 01:24:32.201
In theory, we can just dump all the sequences through and see what comes out the other end in the reader.

01:24:35.834 --> 01:25:03.808
The trouble is these high throughput, high fidelity sequencing technologies have never been applied to virology because if they were, then the infectious cycle and the illusion that gets created when they use transformation and transfection and cell culture to create the illusion of virology, that illusion would be broken if they actually applied with any integrity, these sequencing technologies to probe what's happening.

01:25:03.828 --> 01:25:04.869
Let me give you an example.

01:25:06.178 --> 01:25:20.784
Imagine that these intrepid biologists decided that they really wanted to investigate the fidelity of the infectious cycle in an experiment like that avian flu enriching bullshit in ferrets.

01:25:22.805 --> 01:25:35.210
They did that in the Netherlands, where supposedly a ferret in one cage gave a sickness to the ferret in the next cage, and by the time they got to the 12th ferret, the avian flu was aerosolized and dangerous or some shit.

01:25:36.584 --> 01:25:48.409
Now, the funny thing is, is that they never bothered to characterize the changes that happened in that virus, even though they knew that most likely if it's going to be aerosolized and there are certain expectations, what would change?

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:51.211
What proteins changed?

01:25:52.331 --> 01:26:02.536
What sequence changed that allowed it to go from being not so aerosolized to aerosolized or not so deadly to deadly or not so specific for ferrets for specific for ferrets.

01:26:03.598 --> 01:26:15.650
And why don't we have a sequence from every animal seeing as now we can sequence these things in real time using nanopore sequencing where we don't need primers and we don't need to know what we're looking for.

01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:16.851
We can just throw it all through.

01:26:20.034 --> 01:26:25.337
Why haven't we looked at the spike protein and how it's changed and how the physiology of it would change?

01:26:25.777 --> 01:26:43.326
If Robert Malone is able to make an x-ray crystallography model of any protein that he wants to so that he can screen the entire catalog of FDA pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals against that model, then why can't we make a model of the spike protein so we can see how it's changing and whether or not these HIV inserts are still there or not?

01:26:44.227 --> 01:26:46.228
Whether they're still causing extra damage or not?

01:26:48.390 --> 01:27:01.357
Why don't we use the EpiVax technology that was developed by Robert Malone and the people at EpiVax to look at the spike protein, to look for epitopes that might be dangerous or immunogenic in particular.

01:27:01.918 --> 01:27:13.164
Why is it that all of these technologies exist and they can be on Robert Malone's resume, but they never need to be talked about when he's in front of a camera, when somebody could ask him a useful question, when somebody is going to write a book.

01:27:21.087 --> 01:27:34.874
Sometimes this gets a little pushback because there are some differences between, or some people talk of differences between the disease in mice and the human disease.

01:27:35.035 --> 01:27:35.595
There's no difference.

01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:43.299
There are a number of different strains and they focus on a strain here that I think is very closely mimics the human disease.

01:27:45.379 --> 01:27:48.384
Right, so we're talking about marine norovirus here.

01:27:48.504 --> 01:27:50.107
Yes, mouse norovirus.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:56.338
I mean, when you interview the mice, they have the same complaints that people with norovirus have, so I guess it pretty well mimics the disease.

01:27:57.056 --> 01:27:59.238
All right, so they bind bile acids.

01:27:59.278 --> 01:28:01.960
So let's talk a little bit about bile acids.

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:14.350
They're made in the liver from cholesterol, and then they're joined to either taurine or glycine, and then we call them conjugated primary bile acids.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.532
So he's learning biology for the first time.

01:28:17.612 --> 01:28:23.617
Bile acids are made in the liver, stored in the bile ducts, and secreted when needed.

01:28:24.482 --> 01:28:46.216
They have a lot to do with the absorption or lack of absorption of vitamin A. You can find a nutritionist on X that's Garrett, somebody or other that talks a lot about vitamin A toxicity and the idea that at one point in time, we may have been short vitamin A, but now they put it in so much food, they put it in everywhere that it's become to the point where, you know, you can get toxic from it.

01:28:46.836 --> 01:28:51.459
And in fact, his argument is, is that, you know, vitamin A is in pretty good quantity in your liver.

01:28:51.499 --> 01:28:52.920
So what do we need it more for?

01:28:53.527 --> 01:28:56.909
There's no shortage if it's available in the liver all the time.

01:28:57.909 --> 01:29:02.951
Now, I don't know to what extent he's right about this, but a lot of what I read from him seems very good.

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:05.933
What I find very interesting is what they just said here.

01:29:05.953 --> 01:29:08.454
I'm going to go back so you can hear it one more time and then I'll play it.

01:29:08.534 --> 01:29:13.096
And then they're joined to either taurine or glycine.

01:29:13.256 --> 01:29:15.697
So either joined to taurine or glycine.

01:29:15.737 --> 01:29:16.798
I think I said creatine.

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:17.358
Sorry about that.

01:29:17.838 --> 01:29:19.159
So taurine or glycine.

01:29:19.239 --> 01:29:20.960
Taurine is a very,

01:29:21.984 --> 01:29:23.561
abundant component in

01:29:24.799 --> 01:29:26.860
in Red Bull.

01:29:27.581 --> 01:29:46.953
So I find myself wondering, because in biology and in our own pattern integrity, there are nearly countless examples of feedback mechanisms by which the presence of one component of that mechanism regulates the metabolism of another so that the right concentrations are present all the time.

01:29:47.554 --> 01:29:53.598
And so I find myself wondering if you're drinking a lot of Red Bull and taking in a lot of taurine, if that affects anything about how

01:29:54.398 --> 01:29:58.461
Bile production and nutrient absorption would change.

01:29:59.682 --> 01:30:06.706
And how that would affect bile secretion and the interaction of these bile acids with your microbiome.

01:30:06.726 --> 01:30:12.490
Listen again as, listen as he continues to explain his rudimentary understanding that he learned a couple days ago.

01:30:13.134 --> 01:30:17.460
and then we call them conjugated primary bile acids.

01:30:17.961 --> 01:30:25.672
They're stored in the gallbladder, which many of you have lost years ago, right?

01:30:26.133 --> 01:30:27.014
And then when you eat,

01:30:28.611 --> 01:30:33.913
the bile acids come out of your gallbladder into the duodenum to help with digestion.

01:30:34.874 --> 01:30:37.795
In particular, help with digestion with fatty stuff.

01:30:37.995 --> 01:30:38.555
Fatty stuff.

01:30:38.575 --> 01:30:48.119
Which is why if you lost your gallbladder and you go out and have a Big Mac, you might have trouble shortly down the road.

01:30:48.599 --> 01:30:48.779
Right.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.683
So once, so do you feel like you have informed consent now?

01:30:55.423 --> 01:30:58.505
I kind of feel like I'm at a standard vet office at this stage.

01:30:58.545 --> 01:31:02.468
They didn't explain Jack mostly because they don't get it either.

01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:08.031
They freely admit they're just kind of reading a description.

01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:08.591
They don't know.

01:31:08.752 --> 01:31:11.233
And don't forget, it helps you digest fatty stuff.

01:31:11.273 --> 01:31:14.215
So the next time you eat a big Mac, you better hope you have a gallbladder.

01:31:17.585 --> 01:31:32.676
Once the bile acids, these conjugated primary bile acids, get into the intestinal lumen, the bacteria there, your microbiome, metabolize them into unconjugated primary and secondary bile acids.

01:31:34.485 --> 01:31:44.072
They make what are called microbial conjugated bile acids, and these are reabsorbed, but most of these are reabsorbed across the intestinal epithelium and go back to the liver.

01:31:44.812 --> 01:31:46.033
Something sounds familiar here.

01:31:46.053 --> 01:31:47.154
You're going to recycle them, right?

01:31:47.574 --> 01:31:50.196
And this is called the anterohepatic circulation.

01:31:50.916 --> 01:31:59.262
You go back in the liver, and then, of course, it's going to be reconjugated to taurine or glycine and stored in the- So are taurine and glycine being excreted then?

01:32:01.164 --> 01:32:09.347
gene conjugated to the bile acid, the bile acid goes to the microbiome, the microbiome unconjugates them, and then they're reabsorbed?

01:32:10.687 --> 01:32:13.668
Do they reabsorb and bring something else with them?

01:32:16.329 --> 01:32:17.489
Is it a feedback loop?

01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:20.790
Could extra taurine in your gut change that?

01:32:24.792 --> 01:32:27.953
I wouldn't be surprised if one or more of these people actually drank Red Bull.

01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:29.169
gallbladder.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:30.810
So it's recycled, right?

01:32:31.711 --> 01:32:36.834
And this transport is mediated by a transporter in the intestine.

01:32:36.854 --> 01:32:40.177
It's called the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter.

01:32:40.217 --> 01:32:43.519
That's going to play a role in this story as well.

01:32:44.279 --> 01:32:46.061
The paper is open access.

01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:47.622
It's funny that you mentioned that.

01:32:47.722 --> 01:32:51.424
And it's funny that you mentioned that in the chat, because I've been thinking about this a lot.

01:32:51.464 --> 01:32:54.586
If vitamin A were a mystery scam, what would it be?

01:32:55.467 --> 01:32:57.949
And in the history of measles, that's what I've

01:32:58.909 --> 01:33:08.873
discovered what Yong In-sef, I don't know what your real name is there, but the one in green, he says Gates loves vitamin A, that's all you need to know.

01:33:08.973 --> 01:33:14.995
It would be interesting to think of the idea that vitamin A in detriment

01:33:20.635 --> 01:33:24.177
can cause a rise in disease because of immune weakness or whatever.

01:33:25.018 --> 01:33:30.362
And vitamin A in abundance can be toxic.

01:33:30.562 --> 01:33:39.128
Now, the only question is whether there is any place or any population where you have a deficiency.

01:33:39.288 --> 01:33:41.749
And in history, at least, we were told that we did.

01:33:41.809 --> 01:33:45.332
And one of the things that you needed to add vitamin A for was measles.

01:33:45.372 --> 01:33:46.432
So it's a good chat

01:33:48.018 --> 01:33:54.421
Graphical abstract, once you sort of get a little bit of a grip on this, is quite good.

01:33:55.261 --> 01:33:59.383
I found myself referring back to it all the time to make sure I was still on the right road.

01:33:59.803 --> 01:34:00.003
Yes.

01:34:00.123 --> 01:34:04.665
So the idea is that these bile acids are made by the liver, help us with digestion.

01:34:05.005 --> 01:34:10.927
However, the microbes in our GI tract can change them, but we can recycle them and change them back.

01:34:11.447 --> 01:34:11.627
Right.

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:21.962
It's been shown that interaction with conjugated bio- And she says that we can recycle them and change them back and doesn't understand.

01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:34.564
So she seems to make it feel like that's an antagonistic relationship between the microbiome that unconjugates these bile acids and then we have to take them back in and re-conjugate them.

01:34:34.604 --> 01:34:38.945
And so it's like a push and pull between two antagonists.

01:34:39.045 --> 01:34:41.966
She doesn't even imagine that it could be a symbiotic thing.

01:34:42.987 --> 01:34:54.621
a feedback between our microbiome and our liver to make sure that we continue to safely absorb lipid-based nutrients without absorbing any toxins or something like that.

01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:58.105
I mean, it's weird because you can hear their

01:34:59.969 --> 01:35:06.271
their portrayal of the interaction with the microbiome as non-symbiotic.

01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:07.252
It's separate.

01:35:07.432 --> 01:35:14.895
It's almost always potentially antagonistic, and that's a real fundamental flaw in their basic model.

01:35:16.155 --> 01:35:19.336
Change them, but we can recycle them and change them back.

01:35:19.836 --> 01:35:20.056
Right.

01:35:21.157 --> 01:35:26.799
Now, it's been shown that interaction with conjugated bile acids

01:35:28.314 --> 01:35:29.135
is proviral.

01:35:29.195 --> 01:35:35.059
It helps virus replication for both human and marine noroviruses in vitro in cultured cells.

01:35:35.499 --> 01:35:44.646
And there are a number of mechanisms in vitro viral action with conjugated bile acids is proviral.

01:35:44.706 --> 01:35:47.628
It helps virus replication for both human and marine.

01:35:47.748 --> 01:35:53.893
So conjugated bile acids, which we produce are proviral.

01:35:55.273 --> 01:35:57.374
pro-norovirus infection.

01:35:57.434 --> 01:36:07.076
So what he is actually going to tell you is that our interaction with our microbiome actually protects us from what they call a norovirus infection.

01:36:12.358 --> 01:36:18.880
And so they are now adding a whole nother layer to the enterovirus infection model.

01:36:19.926 --> 01:36:33.272
that has to do with the chemical interaction of bile acids and the microbiome, generalizing across that microbiome as if it's just one bacterial with one enzyme that does this.

01:36:35.153 --> 01:36:44.977
That it's one bacteria with one protein on the outside that we just ignore some very simplistic model, rather than finally acknowledging that, you know, I've been a

01:36:45.549 --> 01:36:57.677
I've been a polio vaccine and polio virus expert since I can remember, and I never thought for even a second about the gut microbiome and the fact that the polio virus might interact with the gut microbiome.

01:36:57.717 --> 01:37:04.142
It's never even, I never even, it never even dawned on me, but instead he's completely arrogant.

01:37:05.323 --> 01:37:09.466
I don't know anything about bile acids, but I'm going to tell you what the authors wrote.

01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:14.963
And even though I don't know anything about bio-acids, I know everything about the watch still.

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:20.145
I'm still the foremost authority on vaccines going back to polio.

01:37:20.305 --> 01:37:29.610
I'm still Earth's virology professor, even so confident in his position as an authority figure on this biology.

01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:47.634
that he is free, absolutely free to admit that he doesn't know jack shit about bile acids or their role in digestion or immunity or the selectivity of the gut.

01:37:48.134 --> 01:37:48.694
Nothing.

01:37:49.235 --> 01:37:50.675
He knows nothing about it.

01:37:52.674 --> 01:37:58.920
But now he's going to tell you that these authors have discovered that it's central to norovirus infection, but that doesn't matter to me.

01:37:59.501 --> 01:38:13.535
I just studied polioviruses and enteroviruses, but I don't care that it's only since 2018 that we've known anything or cared at all about whether or not there are microbiomas involved in this biology at all.

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.061
noroviruses in vitro in cultured cells.

01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:32.807
And there are a number of mechanisms, but one of them, certain bile acids can inhibit infection in an interferon-dependent manner.

01:38:33.347 --> 01:38:36.349
So that's one of the mechanisms.

01:38:36.569 --> 01:38:40.271
Interferon-dependent manner, but interferon is produced by cells.

01:38:42.199 --> 01:38:44.421
He's not gonna tell us where the interferon comes from.

01:38:44.481 --> 01:38:45.902
The authors might not have even looked.

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:58.553
Remember, this is a reductionist analysis where they're gonna take a mouse model, and they're gonna take a couple proxy measurements of the virus being there in the PCR or some bullshit like that.

01:38:59.073 --> 01:39:05.138
And then they're also gonna look at the bile acids and say that they can measure them or not, and they can add them back or not.

01:39:05.859 --> 01:39:10.143
And adding them back causes a change in the other variable, and so then they must be related.

01:39:11.158 --> 01:39:15.582
Just like when the car goes faster, there's more heavy metals in the exhaust, so they must be related.

01:39:16.642 --> 01:39:21.486
The exhaust must be an indicator of how fast the car is going, just like this.

01:39:22.387 --> 01:39:23.748
It's the same nonsense.

01:39:23.968 --> 01:39:26.450
This signal indicates that signal is real.

01:39:28.312 --> 01:39:38.060
And it is the exact same kind of pseudo logic that William Briggs has been talking about in his uncertainty class, but in real terms.

01:39:38.959 --> 01:39:47.265
And the real terms are chosen using a reductionist analogy for analysis, or a reductionist strategy for analysis.

01:39:51.628 --> 01:40:00.134
And this process seems to occur for different viruses, and so it's maybe a general principle.

01:40:01.455 --> 01:40:07.760
It may be a general principle that he doesn't know, didn't know existed before right now.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.223
in this stream, but he's Earth's virology professor.

01:40:14.444 --> 01:40:21.189
Earth's expert on oral polio vaccine versus intramuscular injected polio vaccine.

01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:23.111
He is the expert.

01:40:24.092 --> 01:40:26.874
He calls himself Earth's virology professor.

01:40:27.614 --> 01:40:36.461
The role of bile acids and the microbiome in conjugation and unconjugation, reconjugation of bile acids

01:40:37.108 --> 01:40:47.075
could be critical and generally very important in understanding all enteroviruses, but who gives a shit, because I've been the expert for 40 years already.

01:40:48.256 --> 01:40:54.540
This doesn't change anything for him, even if it's a whole nother layer of complexity, or maybe four.

01:40:57.222 --> 01:41:00.344
Created bile acids promote neurovirus infection,

01:41:01.263 --> 01:41:09.929
And the ones that are generated by microbes, the ones that they deconjugate, they activate an antiviral response and inhibit infection.

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:16.654
One mechanism may be interferon, and this can determine susceptibility.

01:41:18.015 --> 01:41:21.037
Okay, so that's- So it's gotten infinitely more complex than it was.

01:41:22.836 --> 01:41:26.759
It means that rotavirus is not really solved the way that he says it's solved.

01:41:26.819 --> 01:41:29.280
It means that polio is not really solved the way he says it's solved.

01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:32.502
It means that they didn't know jack about enteroviruses.

01:41:33.363 --> 01:41:37.205
If enteroviruses are indeed anything like they claim they are.

01:41:39.707 --> 01:41:47.572
They didn't know about a crucial mechanism of regulation, a crucial mechanism

01:41:49.051 --> 01:41:52.854
of facilitation of their apparent phenomenon that they are an expert in.

01:41:54.275 --> 01:42:04.924
And now they have a new layer of complexity and he shrugs it off as if he's reading a newspaper about what happened in the Cubs game because baseball still exists and all the rules are still the same.

01:42:05.344 --> 01:42:06.705
It's not that way at all.

01:42:06.985 --> 01:42:08.446
It's not just a new champion.

01:42:09.707 --> 01:42:14.211
It's not just that the Cubs have finally won the World Series, but baseball is still baseball.

01:42:16.596 --> 01:42:26.623
It is that they didn't know jack about enteroviruses, had anything to do with bile acids, had anything to do with the microbiome unconjugating bile acids.

01:42:26.643 --> 01:42:35.029
Now they know that it could be one of the general mechanisms by which these entities that they purport to be experts in might operate.

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:37.410
It's no big deal though, it's cool.

01:42:38.131 --> 01:42:43.755
Just have to add a little color over here in the cartoon and then our cartoon is basically still valid.

01:42:44.685 --> 01:42:45.425
Stop lying!

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:57.172
Bile acids, conjugated and unconjugated, right?

01:42:57.893 --> 01:42:58.533
And their effect.

01:42:58.593 --> 01:43:06.778
So conjugated bile acids help neuroviruses, and unconjugated do not.

01:43:08.439 --> 01:43:08.699
OK.

01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:14.162
Now, the other important part here is that bile acids are different in neonates and adults.

01:43:16.863 --> 01:43:18.889
First of all, the genes are regulated.

01:43:19.431 --> 01:43:22.600
They're off or low at birth, and then they go up.

01:43:24.011 --> 01:43:26.692
The bacteria are not all there at the beginning, right?

01:43:26.712 --> 01:43:27.412
They're low at birth.

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:28.552
They steadily increase.

01:43:29.212 --> 01:43:30.733
Enterohepatic cycling, right?

01:43:30.773 --> 01:43:34.154
The cycling of bile acids is diminished in neonates.

01:43:34.354 --> 01:43:49.077
And so what they're going to miss here, and I'm just preparing you for what I'm hearing, what they're going to miss here is that the immune system of a neonate and the immune system of a breastfeeding baby, the immune system of a young toddler, the immune system of a young

01:43:51.278 --> 01:44:20.585
adolescent and a young teenager, the immune system is ever interacting with the gut microbiome, ever building a tolerance to the gut microbiome and the proteins that are produced there, ever building an interaction that includes the exchange of bile acids that are conjugated and unconjugated and the recycling of them to facilitate the absorption of and digestion of lipid-based nutrients and chemicals that the body needs.

01:44:22.577 --> 01:44:47.032
And enteroviruses, according to these people, are a part of that system that heretofore we didn't understand nearly as well as we used to because we didn't understand this key aspect of how they are moving around, how they get where they're going, and how the production of bile acids and the interaction and processing of those by the gut microbiome sort of feed back on this.

01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:56.981
And they still talk as though the rotavirus vaccine works, the polio vaccine works, because we understand it.

01:44:58.363 --> 01:45:09.174
Even though we didn't know about this huge thing, you know, the engine in the beginning, in the front of the car that has all these pistons in it, that's attached to this driveshaft, that's attached to the wheels.

01:45:11.291 --> 01:45:26.328
You've been telling me for 40 years that the exhaust vapor that's coming out the back of the car and the correlation between the metals and the temperature tells me something I know about the speed and power of the car, but that's not true at all.

01:45:28.050 --> 01:45:32.274
It's whether or not this part is connected to that part and this part is running or not.

01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:45.352
They are ignoring the fact that they have been pointing to the tailpipe for 20 years and pointing to their firm understanding about how these viruses replicate when they knew nothing about it.

01:45:47.873 --> 01:45:51.394
They knew nothing about at least three layers of how this works.

01:45:52.294 --> 01:45:55.474
And they're still not being specific enough because they're still in a mouse.

01:45:56.215 --> 01:46:02.956
They're still talking about the microbiome as if it's a thing instead of a flora, a bouquet of things.

01:46:04.645 --> 01:46:06.666
as if the microbiome can just be sequenced.

01:46:09.007 --> 01:46:12.729
Oh wait, Sabine Hazan will tell you that it can just be sequenced.

01:46:13.329 --> 01:46:14.029
Stop lying!

01:46:25.325 --> 01:46:31.228
get maternal bile acids, and the maternal bile acids are conjugated.

01:46:31.908 --> 01:46:37.911
And remember, the conjugated bile acids can potentiate virus infection.

01:46:39.497 --> 01:46:48.123
So you have host bile acids, which potentiate virus replication, and you have microbial that modulate it.

01:46:48.143 --> 01:46:51.666
This is an interesting little push-pull here that's going on, right?

01:46:51.706 --> 01:46:54.948
Except it's a push-pull that involves the symbiotic.

01:46:55.028 --> 01:47:02.113
It's not push-pull at all, because the bacteria have nothing to unconjugate if we don't produce the bile acid.

01:47:04.415 --> 01:47:07.317
And since all that bile acid that we produce is conjugated, you see?

01:47:09.215 --> 01:47:19.319
So the bacteria are actually just doing their job, doing what they do as part of this symbiotic relationship where bile acids are used to absorb things.

01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:25.502
It's an extraordinary thing because they're also used to detoxify.

01:47:27.303 --> 01:47:37.007
And so you can see a very clever thing where they're just kind of hinting at it, but not really telling you that taurine, and what did they say, glycine,

01:47:39.096 --> 01:47:42.879
are conjugated to these and then the unconjugation occurs in the bacteria.

01:47:42.899 --> 01:47:44.480
Where does the taurine and the glycine go?

01:47:48.023 --> 01:47:50.205
What else can be conjugated to bile acids?

01:47:50.245 --> 01:47:52.347
Could we get rid of toxins with bile acids?

01:47:55.309 --> 01:47:56.850
And so where are we here now?

01:47:56.951 --> 01:48:04.617
We are again, firmly inside of the trap because with reductionist biology,

01:48:06.616 --> 01:48:15.821
where you focus on a few variables and the rest is assumptions, then these assumptions are never tested.

01:48:15.901 --> 01:48:21.765
The parts of the model of your understanding of reality that are here, our assumptions are never tested.

01:48:23.366 --> 01:48:34.072
And we have the false sense of security that these limited reductionist investigations are buttressing

01:48:35.478 --> 01:48:39.121
the assumptions upon which the investigation is based.

01:48:39.722 --> 01:49:03.562
In other words, exactly what Matthew Briggs has been trying to explain to us, that we get into the logic over here, and we assume that the realistic and real mathematical logic that we do over here is providing edifying observations for the assumptions that we are making over here, when that is an absolutely false

01:49:05.367 --> 01:49:08.888
but it is the basis for progress in academia.

01:49:10.368 --> 01:49:26.691
It is the basis for progress in academia, where a reductionist model and a reductionist experiment and observations made in that context are falsely used to create an illusion of understanding over here.

01:49:28.291 --> 01:49:33.372
A reductionist model of mouse and the brain and autism can be used

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:49.392
to pretend that the assertion that genes can cause autism at the population level has been supported by a reductionist investigation involving a mouse model of autism and SK channels in the brain.

01:49:50.713 --> 01:49:51.214
Can you see it?

01:49:53.447 --> 01:50:18.844
And the same thing is being done here, where a reductionist model of digestion and a reductionist model of enterovirus is being falsely edified by another observation of complexity instead of going, well, now our understanding of enteroviruses in general is even on shakier ground than it was a couple months ago.

01:50:20.618 --> 01:50:23.739
These people do the same exercise.

01:50:23.939 --> 01:50:32.020
This reductionist experiment provides edifying data for our assumptions about enteroviruses.

01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:42.623
And now you see how much work we have to do, because we could do this every day with every paper in biology in almost every field.

01:50:43.763 --> 01:50:47.984
We could take the reductionist model that they are testing

01:50:48.956 --> 01:51:13.998
with very rigorous logic and very rigorous p-values and demonstrate how these p-values and the very rigorous logic used to apply them does not result in edifying observations which support these assumptions around which the experiment was designed.

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.591
I think that's the clip, Jeff.

01:51:19.452 --> 01:51:21.974
I think that's the thing that we need to say.

01:51:22.034 --> 01:51:23.616
That's the thing we need to understand.

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:28.961
That's the thing that the next years of my work are going to be dedicated to.

01:51:29.628 --> 01:51:43.814
trying to get young people to be able to understand, young biologists to understand that this framework can be as malevolently applied as it can be reverently applied.

01:51:44.474 --> 01:51:48.416
And up until now, Biology 101 has been applied malevolently.

01:51:49.181 --> 01:52:02.263
to give you the false sense of fidelity and a false sense of understanding that almost everything is done, that almost all problems are solved, because one or two of these layers of analysis is paramount.

01:52:03.484 --> 01:52:17.246
And we do not understand any level of analysis, especially the genetic one, in such a way to call it paramount or to understand what it really does with respect to the rest of our understanding of our own pattern integrity.

01:52:18.922 --> 01:52:45.475
Now, I wanna revisit pattern integrities again on Thursday because there's been some confusion because I seem to imply that there's no real division of pattern integrity here, but there absolutely is a division of pattern integrity at organism, at the individual organism that takes in energy, produces waste, repairs itself, grows and develops,

01:52:46.385 --> 01:52:51.448
matures, all of these words and processes can only be found in a pattern integrity.

01:52:52.029 --> 01:52:54.010
So the weather is not a pattern integrity.

01:52:55.271 --> 01:52:57.112
Chemistry is not a pattern integrity.

01:52:57.152 --> 01:52:58.293
Those are something different.

01:52:58.333 --> 01:52:59.714
Those are more fundamental.

01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:12.102
A pattern integrity is something that exists on top of chemistry and physics to sustain itself, to grow, and to replicate itself.

01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:15.084
It's not the same thing as

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:20.963
a chemical reaction or a physical law.

01:53:21.824 --> 01:53:23.445
And so be very, very aware.

01:53:23.505 --> 01:53:30.650
I'm not suggesting that you can't delineate what a pattern integrity is in the context of Earth's biology.

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:38.256
A pattern integrity is an organism, is a living thing, and a living thing does certain things that non-pattern integrities do not.

01:53:40.788 --> 01:53:43.070
And so I hope this wasn't a complete waste of time.

01:53:43.571 --> 01:53:48.516
I know I rambled a lot about the dog and I know I rambled a lot about this stuff with regard to Twiv.

01:53:49.056 --> 01:53:49.797
But I did have...

01:53:50.544 --> 01:53:57.010
In my mind, at least, in my imagination, I thought I had a good message today and I don't know if I hit it out or not, but that's where we are.

01:53:57.571 --> 01:53:58.332
That's what we're doing.

01:53:59.373 --> 01:54:03.036
This has been Giga Ohm Biological.

01:54:03.076 --> 01:54:07.700
This has been Biological 101, Biology 101 underscore three.

01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:11.344
We're talking about understanding life as a pattern integrity.

01:54:12.004 --> 01:54:14.247
And I will be on at...

01:54:15.808 --> 01:54:16.849
Wow, that's really close.

01:54:17.949 --> 01:54:20.191
I'll see how PeerTube is doing.

01:54:20.231 --> 01:54:32.598
I might make it 1414 to do the third installment of the Uncertainty class of William Briggs after I get some lunch and drink some water and that kind of thing.

01:54:33.038 --> 01:54:34.218
Thanks very much for joining me.

01:54:34.299 --> 01:54:35.039
Thanks for being here.

01:54:35.889 --> 01:54:39.870
Thanks for having the patience over the weekend and the faith that I would come back.

01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:43.312
And thanks for praying for my dog if you did indeed do that.

01:54:44.112 --> 01:54:50.114
I think a lot of people must have because the turnaround was nothing short of miraculous.

01:54:50.254 --> 01:54:51.174
That's how I would say it.

01:54:51.294 --> 01:54:52.635
So, thanks very much.

01:54:53.375 --> 01:54:58.477
I appreciate all of you in an unimaginable way.

01:55:01.018 --> 01:55:01.778
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

01:55:02.318 --> 01:55:03.579
I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

01:55:06.035 --> 01:55:08.076
I'm not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow, but I'll have something.

01:55:08.116 --> 01:55:10.898
I got a whole laundry list of things to do.

01:55:11.058 --> 01:55:12.679
Actually, I think I know what I'm going to do tomorrow.

01:55:12.699 --> 01:55:22.264
Tomorrow I'm going to do a Charlie Rose show with Jeffrey Sachs and Peter Hotez.

01:55:23.084 --> 01:55:30.686
and a Nobel Prize winner that Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS, Housatonic Live, posted on all of his channels.

01:55:32.047 --> 01:55:40.229
It's a really interesting show that I dare you to watch before we review it tomorrow in a study hall to see if you find what I found.

01:55:41.249 --> 01:55:42.530
I think it'll be really interesting.

01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:42.990
I know Mark

01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:46.492
Will be very curious as to what I found in that video.

01:55:46.552 --> 01:55:49.113
So anyway Thanks for being here.

01:55:49.293 --> 01:55:54.216
Thanks for supporting the stream If you want to support you go to get home biological comm and find a way to support it.

01:55:54.756 --> 01:56:01.620
Thank you very much Steven C Thank you very much Carrie Girl rocks.

01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:02.961
We got you.

01:56:03.561 --> 01:56:04.301
Thank you very much.

01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:07.383
Thanks Jeff from Earth Thanks, Greg

01:56:09.404 --> 01:56:09.764
I don't know.

01:56:09.804 --> 01:56:14.748
Thank you for the people that support this stream with little donations and small ones.

01:56:15.929 --> 01:56:20.372
My whole family will be eternally grateful and I hope that I'm making you all proud.

01:56:20.713 --> 01:56:23.355
And again, I'll see you later on this afternoon and then again tomorrow.

01:56:24.415 --> 01:56:25.876
Just trying to build up the momentum.

01:56:26.577 --> 01:56:28.358
And thank you very much.

01:56:28.719 --> 01:56:31.881
Stream.GigaOM.Bio if you want to share the videos afterward.

01:56:32.441 --> 01:56:32.982
See you later.

01:56:33.082 --> 01:56:35.604
Vitamin A is an interesting story.

01:56:37.585 --> 01:56:38.606
Anyway, see you guys again.
