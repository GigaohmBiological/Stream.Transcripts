00:30.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm afraid that the light is open, it tells us that we're feeling this essentially because of its knowledge.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm afraid that the light is open, it tells us that we're feeling this essentially, it tells us that we're feeling this essentially because of its knowledge.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're feeling this essentially a worst case scenario.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're feeling this essentially a worst case scenario.

01:29.000 --> 01:48.000
I think the truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
We want everybody to feel good. That's not the way life is.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
This episode is sponsored by Moink. That's Mo plus Moink.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again, I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar, I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:26.000 --> 02:52.000
You may have sound check there, Jeffrey, good to see you.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
What I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain. So what do I do? I go to Des Moines.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen, people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of Sentinel cases in Des Moines. I go to Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there.

03:10.000 --> 03:21.000
I go to North Carolina. I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect Sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
These individuals complain. Again, this is a central nervous system condition. So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the Internet. I take attribution for that. Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent, and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z.

03:47.000 --> 04:01.000
These people are really sick with this. But then I say, others who are also infected will show subdramal, pre-dramal signs of lethality, and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

04:01.000 --> 04:11.000
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal, and I've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
If CDC comes back and says, nonsense, that's not real. I come back and say, that's fake news.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.500
We'll protect yourself at all times.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.000
If we keep it clean.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Tell the girls that you wish.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Let's do it.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, this is so crazy!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
This is so crazy!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
This is so crazy!

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
I feel so nervous.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.680
and welcome to the show this is giga ohm biological it's a high resistance low

05:39.680 --> 05:46.680
noise information brief brought to you by a biologist trying to rescue some

05:46.680 --> 05:52.540
sheep and sometimes in trying to rescue some sheep you can also injure some

05:52.540 --> 05:58.920
sheep you can also scare a few sheep you can also startle a few sheep and so

05:58.920 --> 06:07.800
yesterday's stream seemed to startle a few of you and and so I am I'm happy to

06:07.800 --> 06:11.720
clarify some ideas tonight so if you've been following me for a while you're

06:11.720 --> 06:15.360
here at the top of the wave if not you might be a skilled TV watcher who still

06:15.360 --> 06:19.780
hasn't learned to stay focused on the biology still hasn't stopped taking

06:19.780 --> 06:23.640
your bait on social media and still hasn't learned to love your neighbor

06:23.640 --> 06:28.840
and that that's a very lonely place to be but if you're here for a while now

06:28.840 --> 06:33.280
you already know that this community is growing slowly but surely it is linear

06:33.280 --> 06:39.560
growth but that's better than no growth and you can follow me at giga ohm

06:39.560 --> 06:48.200
biological calm and you can also watch this stream at stream dot giga ohm dot

06:48.200 --> 06:52.760
bio and I would love it if everybody would check that out and notice that I

06:52.760 --> 06:58.320
can get that chat up here and so it would be great the more people we get over to

06:59.040 --> 07:03.960
the soapbox to try and test the server the better because right now it seems

07:03.960 --> 07:09.560
like Ted and I are using what seems to be too much horsepower and if it's too

07:09.560 --> 07:16.720
much horsepower if it's too much horsepower then I'd like to you know pay

07:16.720 --> 07:21.760
less per month because I don't want to waste what little money I'm getting in

07:21.760 --> 07:29.400
on on firepower or on server power we don't need so it's already recording

07:29.400 --> 07:32.560
really well it's already storing really well nobody's having any playback

07:32.560 --> 07:36.760
problems but now it's a question of whether the live thing actually works

07:36.760 --> 07:40.120
so if you wouldn't mind going over there and checking and giving me a

07:40.120 --> 07:43.520
report back in the chat about whether or not you're getting stalling or

07:43.520 --> 07:48.760
screaming and how many viewers you see you can earn some some brownie points

07:48.760 --> 07:55.840
with the with the with the instructor today this is a presentation of the

07:55.840 --> 08:02.080
independent right web independent right web and the illusion is actually

08:02.080 --> 08:06.840
sustained only through your active participation not biological just bio

08:06.840 --> 08:16.360
stream dot giga ohm dot bio and we're trying to get people to understand what

08:16.360 --> 08:21.760
the United non-compliance is nowadays and so you know night at night at

08:21.760 --> 08:24.960
non-compliance is really just not going along with the narrative when you're

08:24.960 --> 08:28.200
around people who are going along with the narrative it's speaking up when you

08:28.200 --> 08:33.400
have the chance and it's reminding people that they are human just like you

08:33.400 --> 08:39.680
and that we've been governed by lies for many decades now that's that's one of

08:39.680 --> 08:44.320
the main messages I think that's open really to everybody but people are

08:44.320 --> 08:48.120
trying to encourage me to get biology get them get back to the biology so we're

08:48.120 --> 08:52.480
going to try and shove a little biology in your head tonight hello to Jeff from

08:52.480 --> 08:58.360
earth I hope the scar looks a little better than that now a little bit

08:58.360 --> 09:04.960
better than that but it's a he's a super fan with that with that that that carving

09:04.960 --> 09:11.400
in his head for me I mean that's that's real loyalty there Jeff real loyalty

09:15.320 --> 09:21.400
so we are currently dealing with a conscious of intelligent manipulation of

09:21.400 --> 09:26.200
the organized habits and opinions of the masses being an important element in

09:26.200 --> 09:30.840
democratic society for many many decades already and the people that have been

09:30.840 --> 09:34.080
in government for many decades already know this they know that we're being

09:34.080 --> 09:42.120
manipulated they know that so it's not surprising that that they are committed

09:42.120 --> 09:47.880
to this removing of our informed consent they are committed to it because in

09:47.880 --> 09:52.320
order to govern us effectively as a nation they need us paying attention to

09:52.320 --> 09:56.480
the NBA which we're not paying attention to anymore they need us paying attention

09:56.480 --> 10:00.080
to sports which we're not really paying attention to anymore and and we're

10:00.080 --> 10:03.400
starting to pay attention to them and what they've said and the fact that

10:03.400 --> 10:10.080
they're not following through with it excuse me for a second good evening

10:10.080 --> 10:13.200
ladies and gentlemen this is Giga Home Biological a high-resistance low noise

10:13.200 --> 10:16.400
information brief brought to you by a biologist my name is Jonathan Cooley I

10:16.400 --> 10:19.840
am that biologist coming to you live from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania this is the

10:19.840 --> 10:24.880
back of my garage the principle of informed consent is kind of a big idea

10:24.880 --> 10:29.400
but it basically means being responsible it means being responsible for what

10:29.400 --> 10:35.720
happens to you it means being an adult and kids can't exercise informed consent

10:35.720 --> 10:39.280
because they're not adults they don't understand the reality of the world which

10:39.280 --> 10:44.400
is that half of the adults out there are liars half of the adults are there

10:44.400 --> 10:48.200
are willing to cheat people they don't know and half of the adults out there

10:48.200 --> 10:51.880
might be desperate enough to cheat people that they don't know so it's it's

10:51.880 --> 10:58.200
a hard world to introduce your children to when the default is is is not that

10:58.200 --> 11:03.320
everybody believes in God and everybody's afraid to hurt other people that nobody

11:03.320 --> 11:07.120
plays really violent video games or nobody watches really violent TV or

11:07.120 --> 11:12.160
movies it's exactly the opposite of that people who have never really engaged

11:12.160 --> 11:17.920
in violence like boys that have never played football are willing to smash

11:17.920 --> 11:22.720
their heads friends into the pavement right now because we haven't really

11:22.720 --> 11:28.320
allowed children to grow up in a way that that I feel like is biologically

11:28.320 --> 11:31.440
relevant for their development that's what football is for that's what

11:31.440 --> 11:36.240
basketball sports wrestling that's what these things are for and they're no

11:36.240 --> 11:41.720
longer there anymore for the most part and and they're under emphasized and and

11:41.720 --> 11:46.680
they are considered a luxury in many cases and so we are in a situation where

11:46.680 --> 11:51.240
our young people are growing up un-unchained by a morality that they've

11:51.240 --> 11:56.880
inherited from their parents or unchained by a a set of principles that

11:56.880 --> 12:01.680
they are modeling from their parents and that's all of our collective adult

12:01.680 --> 12:08.320
fault because many of us have turned over a certain amount of the parenting

12:08.320 --> 12:13.800
to the inevitable social media the inevitable TV or or or video games

12:13.800 --> 12:18.480
because they're all doing it I can't stop it and this is part of the apathy

12:18.480 --> 12:22.680
that we need to change just like we need to change the apathy about well it's

12:22.680 --> 12:27.120
too complicated for me to understand and know all of the biology that is

12:27.160 --> 12:32.960
impingent on our families is is simple enough to understand at least the big

12:32.960 --> 12:39.400
pictures and certainly the the morality underneath it and the the idea of what

12:39.400 --> 12:43.320
we are really objecting to and not objecting to what they are claiming and

12:43.320 --> 12:47.000
not claiming if you understand it well enough that's all you really need to

12:47.000 --> 12:50.520
know the rest of the details tend to become noise and in fact their noise

12:50.520 --> 12:56.400
because they've largely been produced through this this false generation of

12:56.400 --> 13:01.720
knowledge that is preparing repetitive science testing of null hypotheses this

13:01.720 --> 13:08.040
kind of crap which the broken science initiative is keenly organized to try

13:08.040 --> 13:13.520
and dispel as a mythology in our society and I think it's a worthwhile cause part

13:13.520 --> 13:19.440
of which that I feel a very big privilege of being an integral part of so

13:19.440 --> 13:22.800
it's been a while since I've stated this hypothesis I think I should state it

13:22.800 --> 13:27.120
again I think that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus

13:27.120 --> 13:35.440
detectable by a nonspecific PCR tests many nonspecific PCR tests for RNA

13:35.440 --> 13:39.960
viruses applied to a low prevalence population which means a high percentage

13:39.960 --> 13:44.240
of false positives and correlated with poor detrimental health protocols meaning

13:44.240 --> 13:48.960
that when you suspected covid or you got a positive test you treated somebody

13:48.960 --> 13:52.600
completely differently than you would have if you just pulled them out of a

13:52.600 --> 13:57.960
hat and looked at their symptoms and decided what to do that's the real truth

13:57.960 --> 14:01.440
of the matter you took their pulse ox when you might not have ever taken their

14:01.440 --> 14:07.720
pulse ox before and these things were correlated with those with those tests

14:07.720 --> 14:14.640
and with these protocols because of of imperative and financial incentive and

14:15.120 --> 14:19.320
this enabled a larger percentage of all cause mortality number one to be

14:19.320 --> 14:26.320
created and number two to be blamed on something other than PNI and prioritized

14:26.320 --> 14:33.120
as a national security threat composed of a vaccine preventable death and so all

14:33.120 --> 14:37.600
of the wheels go into emotion immediately we've got to get the vaccine guys working

14:37.600 --> 14:42.160
we got to get those repurposed drug guys working we got to get all these guys

14:42.240 --> 14:48.920
working because the the the light went on the bell was wrong and now we have

14:48.920 --> 14:54.800
this plan and the plan involves a national security operation that makes

14:54.800 --> 15:00.120
sure that they get as much compliance as possible that's the objective of the

15:00.120 --> 15:05.280
national security plan because before they know for sure whether it's Kevin

15:05.280 --> 15:10.280
McCarran worst case scenario 1.2 billion people dead in a year and the knock on

15:10.320 --> 15:16.200
consequences of that are simply unimaginable or whether it's a flash in

15:16.200 --> 15:19.960
a pan kind of thing that the SARS original one did or whether it was a

15:19.960 --> 15:24.680
false alarm all entirely and maybe maybe the Chinese were completely putting on

15:24.680 --> 15:29.740
a show of course that that possibility never crossed anybody's mind in North

15:29.740 --> 15:38.920
America we assumed immediately the Chinese must be serious and at least four

15:38.920 --> 15:45.120
years later that should be a little puzzling to you but I would suggest

15:45.120 --> 15:50.920
that an NIAID funded infectious RNA clone could have been used to seed the

15:50.920 --> 15:55.880
molecular story and it could be titrated depending on what you want the story

15:55.880 --> 16:01.680
to be if you want there only to be a few cases as James Giordano always

16:01.680 --> 16:06.280
explains in our repeat of his videos well then you could use a clone to seed

16:06.280 --> 16:09.840
a few of those cases including for example the Sohomishment Countyman and

16:09.840 --> 16:15.680
guarantee yourself a cultural virus guarantee yourself a robust signal

16:15.680 --> 16:20.640
guarantee yourself the things that you want to guarantee by making sure that

16:20.640 --> 16:24.920
the signal that you found is the one you want to find again assuming that this is

16:24.920 --> 16:29.720
a plannedemic as opposed to a pandemic which I don't think can happen as we

16:29.720 --> 16:35.120
say with the yellow line there but RNA virus cannot sustain a pandemic we should

16:35.120 --> 16:40.080
just say an RNA molecule cannot sustain a pandemic because coronaviruses

16:40.080 --> 16:45.560
don't have any other enzymes in them it is essentially an RNA molecule wrapped

16:45.560 --> 16:51.720
in a lipid lipoprotein coat so we could just say an RNA molecule we could just

16:51.720 --> 17:05.520
say that like that but and RNA molecule cannot sustain a pandemic whoops it's

17:05.520 --> 17:12.240
gonna get mad at me now there we go how about that and if we say it as

17:12.240 --> 17:16.120
precisely as we can without having to commit ourselves to any of the details

17:16.120 --> 17:19.000
of the story that's probably the best way to say it an RNA molecule can't

17:19.360 --> 17:24.840
cannot sustain a pandemic so whatever they did it was a man-made process it

17:24.840 --> 17:31.480
was a man-made illusion or a man-made commitment to the story of this any

17:31.480 --> 17:35.240
combination of the above would get us across the finish line the goal is a

17:35.240 --> 17:38.520
total surrender of individual sovereignty and enforcement of a global

17:38.520 --> 17:43.600
fundamental inversion right because right now the whole globe still thinks of us

17:43.600 --> 17:48.200
as kind of we're responsible for this right we're responsible for our kids if

17:48.200 --> 17:54.960
my dog bites your kid it's my fault right so I mean we're responsible for our

17:54.960 --> 18:01.320
stuff and our people and our family and our our our actions and they want to

18:01.320 --> 18:05.520
invert that so that you don't you don't have anything you don't get to do

18:05.520 --> 18:11.320
anything and none of it is yours it's it's it's the state almost like you

18:11.320 --> 18:14.480
lease it your lease your citizenship that's what they would like it to be

18:14.480 --> 18:20.480
based on your compliance that's that's a good way to see it actually is it just

18:20.480 --> 18:24.920
falls out of my head like that that you're leasing your citizenship

18:24.920 --> 18:33.440
dependent on or or yeah dependent on on on your compliance but you can tell if

18:33.440 --> 18:39.400
someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it in people and I have lied I'm

18:39.440 --> 18:43.440
sure I'll lie again I don't want to lie you know I don't think I'm a liar I try

18:43.440 --> 18:47.200
not to be a liar I don't want to be a liar I think it's like really important

18:47.200 --> 18:53.000
not to be a liar there's something very striking about that five sentence

18:53.000 --> 18:59.800
response about lying there's something incredibly striking about it and what's

18:59.800 --> 19:09.360
most striking to me is if I was to try and put together as a group

19:09.360 --> 19:13.240
of sentences like that it would go something like I've tried not to lie as

19:13.240 --> 19:18.360
far as I know I haven't lied sometimes I haven't told the whole story because

19:18.360 --> 19:26.160
it was appropriate not to but I've never lied and certainly certainly I've never

19:26.160 --> 19:32.360
lied into this camera and not into this microphone because that would be putting

19:32.360 --> 19:40.120
my family in front of a train because I don't have a corporate backer or a

19:40.120 --> 19:47.920
weaponized pile of money backing me I don't have the support of a network so

19:47.920 --> 19:55.520
it's a really striking statement to me because that doesn't even get down to my

19:55.520 --> 20:01.120
faith or or or my upbringing or why it is that I find it very important not to

20:01.120 --> 20:12.000
lie and I've got a great story for that it's a long and detailed one but it's

20:12.000 --> 20:16.560
a weird thing for somebody like Tucker Carlson who gets millions of views

20:16.560 --> 20:22.320
influences millions of people directly and indirectly to just flat out admit he's

20:22.320 --> 20:28.080
a liar doesn't want to be but he is partly because of his job partly because

20:28.080 --> 20:33.920
of it's how the world works that's what's so cool about this stream that's what's

20:33.920 --> 20:37.840
so spectacular if you're watching on YouTube you are seeing something that

20:37.840 --> 20:41.520
YouTube doesn't want you to see right now you should come over to stream dot

20:41.520 --> 20:46.760
gig ome dot bio and get off this stupid platform YouTube because it's just

20:46.760 --> 20:55.240
propaganda and now if we listen very carefully to the next guy that I play

20:55.240 --> 20:59.360
understand that I've met so many of these people in the last three years and

20:59.360 --> 21:05.840
I've had so many of them give me the fake smile and the fakes fake selfie and the

21:05.840 --> 21:14.400
fake oh I love what you do I've seen your stream only to stab me in the back only

21:14.400 --> 21:20.560
to pretend they don't know me only to go on talking about things inverted from

21:20.560 --> 21:27.400
what I would have told them in person and without shame or remorse because it's

21:27.400 --> 21:39.680
part of a show and it takes a lot if you realize how much it takes for me to say

21:39.680 --> 21:44.880
that here I'm standing alone not because I think it's gonna be the the quickest

21:44.880 --> 21:51.320
way to eclipse Rogan I'm standing alone because I feel like it's the only thing

21:51.320 --> 21:56.640
I can really offer you because I'm one of the few people who has real personal

21:56.640 --> 22:02.160
face-to-face experience with a lot of these these individuals otherwise what

22:02.160 --> 22:09.320
data points would you have their tweets versus someone else's tweets how many

22:09.320 --> 22:16.040
people can say to you that they've met any of these people in person much

22:16.040 --> 22:21.520
less talk to them ask them questions to their face and watch them kind of squirm

22:21.520 --> 22:28.360
about it watch them try to get away as quick as possible watch them be

22:28.360 --> 22:32.320
surprised when the guy next to you is Mark Coolack and you introduce them to

22:32.320 --> 22:41.240
him I've had lots of experience with these people and so if I bore you or annoy

22:41.240 --> 22:45.680
you with the personal experiences that I have I have to confess it's a lot of

22:45.680 --> 22:48.960
what I have to offer besides the biology which I've already spent three years

22:48.960 --> 22:56.520
teaching because these are data points and so as I as I move forward I think

22:56.520 --> 23:00.200
it's really important for for everyone the political cut I have on the

23:00.200 --> 23:05.440
specialization is always that that if you analyze the politics of science

23:05.440 --> 23:09.400
the specialization should make you suspicious it should because it's gotten

23:09.400 --> 23:13.240
harder to evaluate what's going on and it's presumably gotten easier for people

23:13.240 --> 23:17.160
to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be a little bit suspicious and

23:17.160 --> 23:21.800
that's that's sort of my starting my starting bias so my point is if I go

23:21.800 --> 23:29.160
back one slide is that the lot of these people as Peter Thiel himself said I

23:29.160 --> 23:34.480
believe are engaged in lying or exaggerating about gain of function and

23:34.480 --> 23:39.200
about the potential of coronavirus is to pandemic and about the effectiveness of

23:39.200 --> 23:45.800
vaccines and about the need for public health and about the fights that they are

23:45.800 --> 23:49.680
putting up and about the ideas that they are sharing in order to make sure that

23:49.680 --> 23:56.120
we are not able to save our grandchildren from enslavement and I think a lot of

23:56.160 --> 24:03.320
these people are auditioning for a place in that group of governing elite that's

24:03.320 --> 24:12.360
what I think and if you see it that way then I have been I have been bumping

24:12.360 --> 24:16.200
into people who have misrepresented themselves as who they are because all

24:16.200 --> 24:20.160
of the people in this picture ever miss have represented themselves as fighting

24:20.160 --> 24:27.360
for my grandchildren not for theirs not for their intergenerational wealth or

24:27.360 --> 24:33.440
multi-generational wealth or the potential for it and the preservation of

24:33.440 --> 24:37.960
it they pretend to be fighting for our grandchildren for our grandchildren's

24:37.960 --> 24:43.880
freedom and they're not they're playing along with the people who are running

24:43.880 --> 24:48.600
this show and it's very important and that's my role I think is to bring people

24:48.600 --> 24:52.520
through the biology to see it of course scientists have tried to determine

24:52.520 --> 24:57.960
exactly where and how this novel coronavirus spread to humans did it

24:57.960 --> 25:02.800
emerge naturally from the animal world and get transmitted to people in Wuhan

25:02.800 --> 25:08.680
China or from a security breach at a research lab also in Wuhan that has been

25:08.680 --> 25:13.160
the subject of an ongoing debate William Brangham is back with details about

25:13.160 --> 25:17.880
new studies published yesterday in the journal Science that point to the live

25:17.880 --> 25:24.560
animal market Judy trying to understand COVID's origins okay so I don't I don't

25:24.560 --> 25:29.040
need to play this whole thing but what I'm trying to show you is is that for four

25:29.040 --> 25:34.760
years one of the illusions of the consensus has been this argument about

25:34.760 --> 25:40.500
a lab leak or a novel virus from a bad cave and you can never not start there

25:40.500 --> 25:44.780
because it is one of the easiest ways to open the argument or open the

25:44.780 --> 25:49.220
discussion with anyone on the left or the right who is generally still skillfully

25:49.220 --> 25:53.860
watching television you can first start with have you ever thought about the

25:53.860 --> 25:58.340
possibility that these people who run the show tricked us into arguing about

25:58.340 --> 26:02.300
whether it was a lab leak or a novel virus to get us to accept the premise of a

26:02.300 --> 26:09.380
virus to begin with like if it's a bad cave virus or a lab leak and we argue

26:09.380 --> 26:13.140
about that then we accept the novel virus without even knowing it have you ever

26:13.140 --> 26:18.500
thought about that because that would be a clever way for the biosecurity state

26:18.500 --> 26:23.660
to get what they wanted without risking anything in fact they wouldn't even risk

26:23.660 --> 26:28.740
international relations because they could tell China and the governments

26:28.740 --> 26:33.540
around the world that it was actually okay but we're gonna do this and you're

26:33.540 --> 26:40.700
gonna do it with us and collectively we're gonna be able to get farther down

26:40.700 --> 26:47.260
our plan of 2030 UN 2030 then we would have if we didn't hit so obvious now

26:47.260 --> 26:51.820
and it should be obvious from four years back that this there's there's there's

26:51.820 --> 26:56.900
Rasmussen on the PBS NewsHour I mean think about what they did to us that

26:56.900 --> 27:01.420
they threw her in front of our grandparents on PBS NewsHour has an

27:01.420 --> 27:07.740
authority about the fact that it was a laboratory not a laboratory leak but a

27:07.820 --> 27:18.580
a market zoonosis and coupled with the the overt lying on mainstream media the

27:18.580 --> 27:25.700
overt lying on Fox MSNBC and PBS NewsHour there was the heterodoxy on the

27:25.700 --> 27:31.900
internet that was also lying but in a different way between a inside of a very

27:31.900 --> 27:36.860
limited spectrum of debate which seemed to vigorously challenge that mainstream

27:36.900 --> 27:41.940
narrative but not really it vigorously challenged the mainstream narrative by

27:41.940 --> 27:46.860
suggesting that they were covering up the lab leak so in effect they took one

27:46.860 --> 27:52.140
side but not all of them of course Sam Harris also a prominent member of the

27:52.140 --> 27:58.100
original OG intellectual dark web also took the position that it couldn't have

27:58.100 --> 28:02.940
been a lab leak that's ridiculous mother nature is already mean enough we

28:02.940 --> 28:11.220
don't need to make up stories and so that's why I played this over Nathan's

28:11.220 --> 28:15.220
picture because I do think it's very important that if this was done in

28:15.220 --> 28:20.140
malevolence if this is part of the governing strategy of the people that

28:20.140 --> 28:27.980
run the show then we better wake up now or our children will wake up enslaved and

28:27.980 --> 28:31.100
I don't think all of these people are involved I don't think all of these

28:31.140 --> 28:34.780
people knew better I think a lot of these people are just trying to make ends meet

28:34.780 --> 28:47.140
too but it's four years in now and it's time for the critical thinkers to pull

28:47.140 --> 28:53.540
up their pants and admit that they made a huge mistake like I have admitted it

28:53.540 --> 28:59.260
make sure that they admit that they've made a huge mistake and participated in

28:59.300 --> 29:03.100
something that they could have known better was more than they were told it

29:03.100 --> 29:08.820
was Tommy could figure this out yet except he thinks that this guy's telling

29:08.820 --> 29:16.860
the truth it's funny because you can find pictures of this guy in a bubble suit

29:16.860 --> 29:25.740
too just like sheng she Lee only 20 years ago I think the most more parsimonious

29:25.740 --> 29:30.660
solution for this is that these people have been engaged in this spreading of

29:30.660 --> 29:36.140
bad ideas for much longer than we thought engaged in spreading bad ideas

29:36.140 --> 29:42.060
through event 201 through dark winter through the spars pandemic through all

29:42.060 --> 29:51.060
of these tabletop exercises through popular novels through movies these

29:51.100 --> 29:57.820
ideas have been spread and I believe that there are people in government who

29:57.820 --> 30:02.380
have been involved in making sure that the worst case scenario of bio weapons

30:02.380 --> 30:08.460
all the way back several decades already they were already playing with this of

30:08.460 --> 30:13.380
course they thought it was possible for a while but the more they delved into

30:13.380 --> 30:17.860
this the more they realized that the robustness of the immune system was in

30:17.900 --> 30:23.220
general pretty solid it's only when they went intramuscularly injecting

30:23.220 --> 30:27.740
combinations of substances derived from other animals that they start to have

30:27.740 --> 30:36.620
big problems they had to cover that up it's all one big continuous storyline that

30:36.620 --> 30:42.700
nobody really wants to admit because then you will see that they actually are

30:42.700 --> 30:46.100
probably involved in making sure that you don't see it that everything from

30:46.140 --> 30:52.100
AIDS actually lines up but it's not that AIDS was a huge thing and they they

30:52.100 --> 30:57.820
killed a bunch of people no it was probably a very small thing mostly a

30:57.820 --> 31:04.460
mistake due to vaccination and backs preparation so they had to cover it up

31:04.460 --> 31:11.540
and so they covered it up and if anything if anything right now what we are

31:11.540 --> 31:19.620
dealing with is a continued spinning spiral of people who are essentially not

31:19.620 --> 31:23.500
sick being told that they are sick and then being treated in a way that

31:23.500 --> 31:30.380
otherwise would they would be fine we I mean we are dealing with something very

31:30.380 --> 31:36.380
very malevolent here and that's why when you go through the history of all the

31:36.380 --> 31:40.340
people that were involved from 2020 forward you will see that a vast

31:40.420 --> 31:44.580
majority of them for some reason or another cut their teeth in a few

31:44.580 --> 31:51.100
hospitals and more importantly cut their teeth in a few labs on a few subjects

31:51.100 --> 31:59.780
most of them went through an HIV lab or an HIV ward or an HIV something charity

32:00.380 --> 32:08.660
Deborah Birx has no business having been involved in this but she was intimately

32:08.660 --> 32:14.820
involved the list is huge ladies and gentlemen and you have to you have to

32:14.820 --> 32:19.500
ignore all of the list you have to ignore the entire list of incongruencies

32:19.500 --> 32:23.940
before you can accept the idea that any of these people might be on our side but

32:23.940 --> 32:29.420
just confused that's the part that's unfortunate and frustrating we don't

32:29.420 --> 32:35.460
have much time the bottom line is for me if if we don't make serious progress

32:35.460 --> 32:40.340
and waking people up to the extent to which they have been lying to us by the

32:40.340 --> 32:45.580
time the election comes it will be over I don't know what's gonna happen best

32:45.580 --> 32:48.860
case scenario it's an election with conflicting results that everybody gets

32:48.860 --> 32:53.780
pissed about for months and disrupts everything mentally anyway but I have a

32:53.780 --> 32:59.540
feeling it's gonna be a little more complicated than that and so we need to

32:59.540 --> 33:04.140
bring people to understand these basic truths that intramuscular injection of

33:04.140 --> 33:07.620
any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system

33:07.620 --> 33:11.700
is dumb and we need to say these things to people like Paul Offit so that they

33:11.700 --> 33:16.100
respond to us I actually think he did respond in the last video the reason

33:16.100 --> 33:19.380
why I didn't play it was because I was streaming to all those things and I

33:19.380 --> 33:24.260
didn't think it was playing right but I do think it is playing it would play

33:24.260 --> 33:27.180
okay and when it does you will see there's a couple things in there that are

33:27.180 --> 33:32.500
hilarious including the fact that Paul Offit says that that Brett Weinstein

33:32.500 --> 33:36.420
lost his YouTube channel because he was pushing Ivermectin that was pretty

33:36.420 --> 33:41.100
cool um transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and I say

33:41.100 --> 33:45.700
healthy humans because there are situations somebody asked this in the

33:45.700 --> 33:50.020
chat the other day I say healthy humans because there are situations where

33:50.020 --> 33:54.740
unhealthy humans like people with cancer where transfection seems to be very

33:54.740 --> 33:58.780
appropriate way of augmenting T cell responses so that the immune system can

33:58.780 --> 34:04.060
more adequately recognize the cancer and get rid of it so in unhealthy humans

34:04.060 --> 34:08.660
transfection may be a way of augmenting their immune response so maybe a way of

34:08.660 --> 34:15.860
repairing a physiology that's either in need of it or whatever but in unhealthy

34:15.860 --> 34:18.860
humans you know you got to do what you got to do maybe it's worth the risk maybe

34:18.860 --> 34:23.420
it's not I'm not gonna say it's not but in healthy humans it's criminally

34:23.420 --> 34:27.460
negligent and we they've not even come close to making it okay to use in healthy

34:27.460 --> 34:32.980
humans and that's why I say it that way I got it this more simplified now RNA

34:32.980 --> 34:36.340
cannot pandemic and so viruses are not patterned integrity's might be a more

34:36.340 --> 34:41.820
more nuanced way of saying that in a buckminster fuller sort of of nomenclature

34:41.820 --> 34:47.580
but I think RNA cannot pandemic is a pretty good home run and so I've been

34:47.580 --> 34:52.380
trying to explain the Scooby-Doo in three scenarios a laboratory or bad cave

34:52.380 --> 34:57.140
virus zoonosis right that's those are the TV scenarios one through three and

34:57.140 --> 35:02.420
so there's an ongoing pandemic and there's an illusion of consensus about it I've

35:02.420 --> 35:06.140
been starting to call this a faith in a novel virus because these people don't

35:06.140 --> 35:09.780
need to have much evidence for them to fully believe that seven million people

35:09.780 --> 35:13.060
were killed actually they just need to repeat it to each other and they believe

35:13.060 --> 35:16.940
it they don't need to to know anything about gain a function research to believe

35:16.940 --> 35:20.740
it's totally possible to engineer a virus that could kill a billion people they

35:20.740 --> 35:24.460
have faith that that's definitely possible they have faith that the

35:24.460 --> 35:28.660
variants are all cultural and trackable and evidence of evolution they have

35:28.660 --> 35:33.140
faith that the lockdowns were done successfully or adequately that they

35:33.140 --> 35:37.580
would have worked they have faith that without the strict regulation of these

35:37.580 --> 35:40.780
laboratories the future pandemics will be worth and they have faith that

35:40.780 --> 35:45.900
transmission at least saves some people maybe old people as as as victory said

35:45.900 --> 35:49.140
or maybe it was just for the first variant and then after that it didn't

35:49.140 --> 35:54.060
help so many people but at least it worked in the beginning this faith is

35:54.060 --> 35:59.940
unquestioned by any of these people and you need to to pay attention hard to see

35:59.940 --> 36:03.700
it but when you pay attention you see it as a faith that just clear right in the

36:03.700 --> 36:10.900
middle they don't touch it they don't come anywhere near it and I think that it

36:10.900 --> 36:15.700
doesn't matter because of the faith itself is a lie and there's lots of

36:15.700 --> 36:20.340
different ways that that faith could be a lie the conflated background signals

36:20.340 --> 36:25.020
the best way to explain it because we don't have any data from before that and

36:25.020 --> 36:31.020
so because the faith is a lie staging the pandemic required murder they needed

36:31.020 --> 36:35.740
all cause mortality to go up and it didn't matter how it went up they could

36:35.740 --> 36:40.500
go up by ventilating people to stop spread it could go up by making people

36:40.500 --> 36:45.460
have more illness and and easier to ventilate by giving them too much

36:45.460 --> 36:50.300
supplementary oxygen it could go up by using remdesivir it could go up by

36:50.300 --> 36:54.300
using medazolam it could go up by telling people to stay home until your

36:54.300 --> 36:59.380
pulse ox is 80 it could go up by not using antibiotics or misusing steroids

36:59.380 --> 37:03.620
and all of those things led to an increase in all cause mortality that all

37:03.620 --> 37:08.700
the people participating attributed to the one new cause of death the novel

37:08.700 --> 37:12.540
virus which was never there in the first place but because of the faith of

37:12.540 --> 37:21.540
all the people around them they just assumed it had to be and so this faith

37:21.540 --> 37:26.140
in a novel has become a faith in a novel biology the first part of this novel

37:26.140 --> 37:29.860
biology that that seems to have been accepted by everybody is a trackable

37:29.860 --> 37:35.500
gain of function RNA went endemic meaning it's never gonna go away now we're

37:35.500 --> 37:40.500
gonna be stuck with this forever and it's a gain of function RNA that went

37:40.500 --> 37:45.740
endemic with a fear and cleavage site and HIV inserts this kind of thing and so

37:45.740 --> 37:49.180
let's think about that a little bit let's think about how that could have

37:49.180 --> 37:53.780
happened in another way or think about ways that that that could be disproven

37:53.780 --> 37:58.540
how it could have been fraud the first way to think about it is with PCR first

37:58.540 --> 38:02.820
of all see up there at the top let me get rid of all them the motion and crap

38:02.820 --> 38:08.140
here so if you see up at the top there I have the the earth color differently

38:08.140 --> 38:13.620
and all the viruses are grayed out because we have no data from before 2020

38:13.620 --> 38:19.900
about what these PCR 250 odd PCR test would have given us but the primers can

38:19.900 --> 38:23.820
be insufficiently specific on a homologous background homologous means

38:23.820 --> 38:29.460
related to or or similar to and so if we have a bunch of signals in the

38:29.460 --> 38:34.100
background and we use PCR primers that are not specific for any one of those

38:34.100 --> 38:40.980
then we can use a PCR test to to insinuate spread that is not there the

38:40.980 --> 38:45.620
primers could also be insufficiently specific and then overcycled and so

38:45.620 --> 38:48.540
that might even be different than it being present but they could be a

38:48.540 --> 38:52.820
specific and then overcycled so depending on the hotness of the background

38:52.820 --> 38:56.140
depending on the specificity of the background these things could be

38:56.140 --> 39:00.700
adjusted over time different batches could have different primers different

39:00.700 --> 39:04.420
specificities and so they could have orchestrated this in any way that they

39:04.420 --> 39:07.540
wanted to and all of the infrastructure to do that would have already been

39:07.540 --> 39:13.540
present because manufacturing these things is old hat and if you're willing

39:13.540 --> 39:16.940
to accept the fact that there were different batches of the mRNA that they

39:16.940 --> 39:22.580
just learned to manufacture this year or in 2021 then I assure you you have to

39:22.580 --> 39:27.100
assume that lateral flow tests and PCR tests could have been adjusted and

39:27.100 --> 39:30.300
faked and monitored and varied depending on what they wanted or didn't want to

39:30.300 --> 39:32.580
find

39:33.500 --> 39:38.060
PCR done on a zero prevalence background confounded with release location

39:38.060 --> 39:42.220
positivity what do I mean by that I mean that you could orchestrate it in such a

39:42.220 --> 39:46.780
way so that in most places you didn't have anything so everything was false

39:46.780 --> 39:52.100
positives but in some places you did have things that you did plant in order to

39:52.100 --> 39:56.740
get those positives and so you could create the illusion of a wave or the

39:56.740 --> 40:03.660
illusion of positivity or the illusion of a specific sequence and so PCR done on

40:03.660 --> 40:07.300
those two different backgrounds one where you planted something in one where you

40:07.300 --> 40:11.780
didn't when there's and the PCR is specific enough so that it can be zero

40:11.780 --> 40:17.300
and a hundred percent specificity on that in 99 then you've got a wonderful tool

40:17.300 --> 40:20.900
there you can vary those two things I just want you to see that any of these

40:20.900 --> 40:24.100
things or all of these things are possible ways that this could have been

40:24.100 --> 40:29.140
faked very good questions to ask are where and when on earth were nested

40:29.140 --> 40:35.260
primers used in PCR testing almost nowhere maybe in australian New Zealand to make

40:35.260 --> 40:40.180
sure that they didn't have much testing positive when they wanted it right

40:40.180 --> 40:44.060
nested primers in australian New Zealand wouldn't surprise me at all but I know

40:44.060 --> 40:49.500
for sure they had no nested primers in Canada for example where is the list of

40:49.500 --> 40:53.580
companies and their protocols that were actively engaged in testing in 2020

40:53.580 --> 40:57.180
and 2021 those are gone and that shouldn't be possible if we're gonna

40:57.180 --> 41:02.620
be able to forensically identify and study what happened in 2020 so we

41:02.620 --> 41:08.540
better get on that stuff really quick so sequencing fraud possibilities this

41:08.540 --> 41:12.780
is different than PCR remember because PCR is just amplifying small fragments

41:12.780 --> 41:17.580
of a large genome where a sequencing fraud would be how would they orchestrate a

41:17.980 --> 41:23.500
appearance of spread with sequences if there was a background that they we

41:23.500 --> 41:28.380
weren't told was there and they were using it well the way they would do it is

41:28.380 --> 41:33.740
that the primers would be specific on a pre-existing background and on that

41:33.740 --> 41:38.140
pre-existing background then what they would want to do is adjusting the number

41:38.140 --> 41:44.060
of primer pairs in order to amplify removed specificity so in other words

41:44.140 --> 41:50.940
the number of primer pairs that amplify on a given sequence is kind of a

41:50.940 --> 41:56.620
threshold right if you don't get all 99 amplicons do you still count it if you

41:56.620 --> 42:01.820
get only 80 amplicons do you still count it 75 amplicons do you see what about

42:01.820 --> 42:07.580
15 and so there's lots of games that can be played with oh wow we got a lot of

42:07.580 --> 42:11.740
amplicons just not all the amplicons so we'll just assume this is a sequence

42:11.820 --> 42:15.820
and they could even do that just with the spike because the spike is the most

42:15.820 --> 42:20.540
abundant sub-genomic RNA and most likely to be found in any of these reactions

42:20.540 --> 42:23.580
that didn't have the full sequence or most of the sequence there

42:23.580 --> 42:26.780
well they could have all had the spike and so it would be very easy for them

42:27.420 --> 42:32.060
to tell this story in any number of ways depending on what the actual status of

42:32.060 --> 42:36.620
the background is but if they tweaked the number of

42:36.620 --> 42:40.380
amplicons necessary to call it a sequence then they can tweak the

42:40.380 --> 42:44.140
specificity as they will and remember where did these sequencing

42:44.140 --> 42:47.900
reactions go were they being done on a bench

42:47.900 --> 42:51.020
were they being done on benches all around the United States at all different

42:51.020 --> 42:55.340
universities no they would be done by the CDC

42:55.340 --> 43:00.460
and they were controlled by DARPA all the sequencing was controlled I believe

43:00.460 --> 43:05.660
by the CDC and BARDA or DARPA or something somebody can figure it out

43:05.660 --> 43:11.900
but it wasn't until like 2021 and 22 that we started having everybody send

43:11.900 --> 43:16.060
in sequences because these things were available and they were doing it

43:16.060 --> 43:19.420
was a very highly controlled operation why would that be

43:19.420 --> 43:24.540
well that would be because the primary pairs would be changed to reflect the

43:24.540 --> 43:27.580
desired evolution pulled from the background in other words

43:27.580 --> 43:31.580
if they had already spent a couple years characterizing that background then

43:31.580 --> 43:34.540
it would be very easy for them to pretend that oh we found this one and now

43:34.540 --> 43:37.100
we found this one and now we found this one and look it's a tree

43:39.900 --> 43:42.860
and now there's no arguing with it anymore because there's papers published and

43:42.860 --> 43:45.500
stuff so the only way that you can contribute to this

43:45.500 --> 43:51.820
sequence tree is to add to it it's no going back anymore

43:51.820 --> 43:55.900
so how long did they really have to control the sequence database not that

43:55.900 --> 43:59.020
long really before everybody would fall into place so

43:59.020 --> 44:03.100
where good questions again where and when on earth did independent sequencing

44:03.100 --> 44:05.340
begin because it didn't start from the beginning

44:05.340 --> 44:09.580
that database has populated exclusively by the government for quite some time

44:09.580 --> 44:12.620
where is a list of companies and their protocols that were actively engaged

44:12.620 --> 44:18.220
in sequencing in 2021 i don't know can't find it on the

44:18.220 --> 44:21.900
FDA website i'd say this is something we should work on

44:21.900 --> 44:25.500
so total fraud possibilities then given that we have no data

44:25.500 --> 44:30.700
from before 2020 would include PCR fraud and sequencing on a pre-existing

44:30.700 --> 44:33.500
background it would include sequence data curated

44:33.500 --> 44:37.820
until the phylogeny was established until the tree was built and

44:37.820 --> 44:41.340
and and Trevor Bedford could give a give a talk on it

44:41.340 --> 44:45.580
and say look what's changing the fastest and ooh scary let's pay attention to the

44:45.580 --> 44:48.860
spike and then everybody just followed suit from then on

44:48.860 --> 44:53.420
primer pairs in both can be changed to reflect the desired evolution so we

44:53.420 --> 44:56.700
can change the PCR we can change the sequencing

44:56.700 --> 44:59.820
primers and nobody nobody's aware of that there's not a

44:59.820 --> 45:05.660
there's not an open source chart of all the primer pairs that were used

45:06.060 --> 45:08.860
because these are these are proprietary things

45:08.860 --> 45:12.700
these are trade secrets supplemental oxygen used without working knowledge

45:12.700 --> 45:16.860
by untrained residents that were shitting their pants because they had

45:16.860 --> 45:19.740
national guard people in their hospital and they thought that

45:19.740 --> 45:24.940
the tv wasn't lying to them this is a relatively new unknown

45:24.940 --> 45:31.500
that crazy enough no mds picked up on but every md i talk to is like oh yeah

45:31.500 --> 45:36.300
that's terrible oxygen is toxic well holy crap

45:36.300 --> 45:39.740
when are they going to catch on to that one or did we find something there that's

45:39.740 --> 45:45.900
so big because it's the perfect on ramp into all of this other nonsense

45:45.900 --> 45:51.260
and it starts with this two dollar amazon order

45:51.260 --> 45:58.780
encouraged by FLCCC 94% or lower you better go to the hospital

45:58.780 --> 46:04.300
boy i wonder how they got so many people to go to the hospital and get killed

46:04.300 --> 46:08.380
clone release and quantity do a known quantity

46:08.380 --> 46:12.860
what do i mean by that i mean that i think they already understand that if

46:12.860 --> 46:17.340
they took a bottle of this size with a known quantity of

46:17.340 --> 46:19.900
RNA and it dropped it inside of an apartment

46:19.900 --> 46:23.820
building they know exactly how far it will go around the world

46:23.820 --> 46:27.820
you know what exactly how far how many people can get on a plane

46:27.820 --> 46:31.500
how long that it will be trackable and how far it will go

46:31.500 --> 46:35.580
because they've done it before they did it with sars one they did it with

46:35.580 --> 46:39.900
mares these could have easily been could be seen

46:39.900 --> 46:43.020
as experimental releases of a certain quantity

46:43.020 --> 46:46.860
of a certain transmissibility of an RNA that could replicate

46:46.860 --> 46:49.660
let's see how far it goes if we get this much there

46:49.660 --> 46:53.740
what happens if we put it only on four camels

46:53.740 --> 46:56.620
and so i'm not saying there's a clone unit i'm just

46:56.620 --> 46:59.580
let's say for example right now we think about the fact

46:59.580 --> 47:03.340
that they released a known quantity of a clone in

47:03.340 --> 47:09.100
in china at the first sars release and then they just watched to see where it

47:09.100 --> 47:12.620
go and how far they can track it now if you think about that as one

47:12.620 --> 47:16.780
clone unit how many clone units would they have to release around the world

47:16.780 --> 47:19.660
before everybody would believe a pandemic was going on even though they

47:19.660 --> 47:23.020
knew full well that whatever they released was only

47:23.020 --> 47:26.620
going to go so far they've already measured it a few times

47:26.620 --> 47:30.220
they could release a smaller bottle so it wasn't even as big as sars one but

47:30.220 --> 47:32.940
still trackable for a certain period of time

47:32.940 --> 47:37.820
and still causing people to become annoyed

47:37.820 --> 47:41.100
you see the the point i'm making here i don't know

47:41.100 --> 47:44.860
to what extent this is possible but i know for sure that clones are real

47:44.860 --> 47:48.620
i know for sure that that's the only way that RNA virology is tractable

47:48.620 --> 47:53.020
in the laboratory is to go and make a DNA clone of the RNA you want to study

47:53.020 --> 47:56.460
and i know for sure we're right about that because until

47:56.460 --> 48:00.060
we started to hammer this home everybody was my friend

48:00.060 --> 48:03.340
until we started to hammer this home everybody wanted to talk to me everybody

48:03.340 --> 48:08.460
wanted me to write in their book the moment i figured out that wait

48:08.460 --> 48:11.980
RNA virology is dependent on cloning

48:11.980 --> 48:15.340
that's how they make all of their virology is that they make

48:15.340 --> 48:18.460
RNA clone and then they put it in a cell culture

48:18.460 --> 48:22.220
the the latest AIDS pre-print that's out on

48:22.220 --> 48:31.900
the bio archive is literally HIV cloned RNA put on HEK cells

48:31.900 --> 48:36.860
and then taken up as viral particles HEK cells are cell type that i've

48:36.860 --> 48:40.060
worked on for years so if you're going to tell me

48:40.060 --> 48:43.500
that you can transfect them and they make viruses well then now i know

48:43.500 --> 48:47.900
exactly the the grift that's going on here

48:47.900 --> 48:51.660
it's just transfection and transfection again

48:51.660 --> 48:57.340
and they are assuming that the the the natural version of this is a

48:57.340 --> 49:00.780
spontaneous transfection that can sustain itself and that's just a

49:00.780 --> 49:05.740
mythology that they love to be true but definitely is not

49:06.300 --> 49:10.380
and so the total fraud possibilities really

49:10.380 --> 49:15.340
are pretty obvious now and this limited spectrum of debate that they hold us

49:15.340 --> 49:19.660
within is starting to become pretty obvious as well

49:19.660 --> 49:22.860
when they just simply won't consider the possibility

49:22.860 --> 49:27.340
when Brett needs to say it four different ways in 10 minutes that

49:27.340 --> 49:32.460
i'm i'm i'm i remain convinced i am sure there was a novel pathogen i am

49:32.460 --> 49:36.860
sure mostly because of the excellent doctors that that have treated him

49:36.860 --> 49:43.020
oh i agree i'm sure of it that's their job

49:43.020 --> 49:49.180
their job is to create sustain and reinforce the limited spectrum of

49:49.180 --> 49:55.100
debate as described by noam Chomsky so that we never escape so that we're

49:55.100 --> 49:58.140
always arguing about bad ideas so that we're always asking the

49:58.140 --> 50:03.900
wrong question so that this worst case scenario never goes away

50:03.900 --> 50:09.260
that our children believe this worst case scenario that's their job

50:09.580 --> 50:12.860
and that's way we win is that when our kids don't believe it

50:12.860 --> 50:17.020
when our kids are confident enough to say to their teachers at school that you

50:17.020 --> 50:22.620
know antibodies are bullshit right you know that that that you can't get

50:22.620 --> 50:27.180
antibodies without multiple layers of t-cell activation and also having

50:27.180 --> 50:32.140
antigen in circulation so that b-cells can be activated before

50:32.140 --> 50:39.100
before they are are are stimulated by t-cell interaction

50:39.100 --> 50:42.860
which is what linked recognition is

50:43.180 --> 50:48.060
and so all of this sort of fundamental mechanical knowledge of immunology

50:48.060 --> 50:51.980
needs to be taught to our children so that they can understand why

50:51.980 --> 50:55.980
it's not very likely that all the molecular biology of the pandemic

50:55.980 --> 51:02.380
is a lie it's not all fake and so how could it not be all fake

51:02.380 --> 51:06.620
well they've told us cartoon stories about how virology works

51:06.620 --> 51:11.980
they've told us cartoon stories about viral replication and viral packaging

51:11.980 --> 51:16.140
we've talked about many times on the stream they they can make cartoon

51:16.140 --> 51:19.100
models of how it works and show us the end protein

51:19.100 --> 51:22.540
getting nicely packaged inside of an endosome that's filled with spike

51:22.540 --> 51:27.020
protein but that doesn't mean that that's that's definitely what happens

51:27.020 --> 51:31.660
all the time and in fact we've heard Robert Malone himself

51:31.660 --> 51:35.900
admit that the vast majority of viral particles that are produced don't do

51:35.900 --> 51:39.500
anything they're useless and so these preparations are

51:39.500 --> 51:44.700
immunogenic they're immunostimulating but they're not necessarily all fully

51:44.700 --> 51:47.980
replication competent variants because that's not how

51:47.980 --> 51:55.660
transfection works that's not how this hijacking of a cell culture works

51:55.660 --> 51:58.860
influenza A needs to be packaged perfectly with

51:58.860 --> 52:03.100
other enzymes in order for it to be a successful variant

52:03.100 --> 52:07.260
coronaviruses don't have that coronaviruses are actually were told

52:07.260 --> 52:13.740
our one genome just an RNA and that RNA then gets translated into proteins

52:13.740 --> 52:17.100
that then work on it and not other things

52:17.100 --> 52:21.580
all inside of our cell despite the fact that ourselves are doing lots of other

52:21.580 --> 52:24.860
stuff on their own now this thing can come in and completely

52:24.860 --> 52:28.860
operate on its own and package itself and not make many errors

52:28.860 --> 52:32.460
and do all kinds of things just because it's drawn in a cartoon

52:32.460 --> 52:35.740
and published in nature

52:36.140 --> 52:40.300
and so the idea that it hijacks our machinery is one of these things they

52:40.300 --> 52:44.060
say over and over again that's not possible he can't make a cell do

52:44.060 --> 52:47.580
something that it doesn't already do we're talking about exosomes we're

52:47.580 --> 52:50.460
talking about communications intracellularly

52:50.460 --> 52:54.620
and so maybe it's possible that a foreign RNA can hijack that system it's

52:54.620 --> 52:58.300
possible but it's very different than the

52:58.300 --> 53:03.020
the hijacking of of the cell to make its machinery do what it doesn't already

53:03.020 --> 53:07.020
do which is what they would like RNA copy fidelity is simply the

53:07.020 --> 53:11.420
argument that RNA doesn't copy itself as perfectly as DNA doesn't DNA makes

53:11.420 --> 53:13.740
errors

53:14.060 --> 53:17.420
don't forget that we just heard

53:19.500 --> 53:23.980
was it who was who was the one who said that i think it was craig bentner

53:23.980 --> 53:28.140
that said that the RNA makes all kinds of errors i can't remember who i was

53:28.140 --> 53:32.220
watching anymore so that the aribosomes make all kinds of

53:32.220 --> 53:34.700
errors when they're making proteins and those proteins

53:34.700 --> 53:38.700
misfold and whatever and so there's so much protein degradation all the time

53:38.700 --> 53:44.540
because of how sloppy a ribosome is but somehow or another

53:44.540 --> 53:48.700
the virus is able to hijack the ribosomes and get perfect copies of

53:48.700 --> 53:53.180
itself out of the proteins of itself out and at the same time

53:53.180 --> 53:57.580
get copies of the machinery right it's got to make using our ribosomes it's got

53:57.580 --> 54:00.780
to make its own RNA dependent RNA polymerase and

54:00.780 --> 54:06.460
ribosomes despite their crappy you know error error prone

54:06.460 --> 54:09.900
misfolding prone function

54:09.900 --> 54:13.020
remember the same guy told us if you were going to make cars and you used

54:13.020 --> 54:16.460
ribosomes boy you would you would never be successful you'd go out of business

54:16.460 --> 54:19.900
because they're not that good but somehow or another

54:19.900 --> 54:23.340
we're told that viruses can hijack that stuff in a way they go

54:23.340 --> 54:27.100
trillions of copies of themselves

54:27.260 --> 54:30.140
and of course i've explained it as a mixtape

54:30.140 --> 54:34.220
you've got to think of RNA as a mixtape you can't copy it with high fidelity

54:34.220 --> 54:38.220
over and over and over again and then have a useful copy at the end if you

54:38.220 --> 54:41.500
make a mixtape and you make a copy of it it will be worse than the first one

54:41.500 --> 54:45.020
there will be errors there will be more noise

54:45.020 --> 54:49.180
and that's definitely true of an RNA genome even if you want to argue that

54:49.180 --> 54:53.580
it's higher fidelity than jay kooie says it is

54:53.660 --> 54:57.580
it's not high enough fidelity to explain how in the hell it could go from a puddle

54:57.580 --> 55:01.980
in wuhan to being everywhere and in most species by now

55:01.980 --> 55:05.340
that's simply ridiculous

55:05.740 --> 55:10.140
and now dna could be thought more of like a cd and it's possible to make copies of

55:10.140 --> 55:13.340
dna with relatively high fidelity that's why

55:13.340 --> 55:16.700
it's very interesting that these RNA signals are

55:16.700 --> 55:20.700
very intractable in the nature in in the laboratory i'm going to escape for

55:20.700 --> 55:24.380
just one second and put this back up

55:30.860 --> 55:34.700
and so because the vast majority of these things can't be grown in culture it's

55:34.700 --> 55:37.500
very difficult other than maybe get a sequence

55:37.500 --> 55:41.820
they usually sequence these viruses or these these RNA signals and then

55:41.820 --> 55:45.340
transfer them to a dna signal which they can use

55:45.340 --> 55:50.620
standard molecular biological techniques including E. coli cultures to grow them

55:51.100 --> 55:55.260
and take advantage of the cd like qualities of dna

55:55.260 --> 55:59.580
so they take that dna it's too long for one uh

55:59.580 --> 56:04.060
chromosome in uh in a bacteria so they break it up into four or five pieces

56:04.060 --> 56:08.380
they grow those in separate cultures that's E. coli

56:08.380 --> 56:11.340
making copies of this dna at high fidelity

56:11.340 --> 56:14.700
of course it's going to make errors but in the end you're going to be left with

56:14.700 --> 56:18.620
a large quantity of dna that you can expose to RNA polymerase and have a

56:18.620 --> 56:22.460
lot of DNA or RNA excuse me

56:22.460 --> 56:25.660
that's very closely related to the original sequence that you found in

56:25.660 --> 56:28.380
the wild and very high fidelity you can get

56:28.380 --> 56:34.700
there's going to be errors for sure but the quantity of if if you

56:34.700 --> 56:41.980
if you look at this as um like a book like let's say we'll take this book

56:41.980 --> 56:45.500
this is the Buckminster Fuller book that i did the other day so we take this book

56:45.500 --> 56:49.900
and we make copies of it in and dna style

56:49.900 --> 56:52.700
then yes there will be some errors but for the most part

56:52.700 --> 56:56.860
every one of those books will be the same if we did the RNA version of it then

56:56.860 --> 57:00.380
we would maybe get a few hundred copies and then the rest of them

57:00.380 --> 57:03.340
would be useless some of a lot of them would be missing lots of pages and

57:03.340 --> 57:06.940
stuff like that because you'd have premature stops or

57:06.940 --> 57:09.340
you have frame shift mutations this kind of thing

57:09.340 --> 57:13.820
which are more likely to happen during RNA copying versus dna copying and they

57:13.820 --> 57:16.300
all all the molecular biologists in the world

57:16.300 --> 57:19.020
understand this it's only coronavirus biologists that

57:19.020 --> 57:22.780
insist that coronaviruses can copy RNA better than any

57:22.780 --> 57:26.860
other system can because they have this gene called exon

57:26.860 --> 57:30.380
which apparently is a proofreading gene and makes it much closer to dna but

57:30.380 --> 57:35.180
that's a hand-waving statement that has like two papers that

57:35.180 --> 57:40.780
argue that might be the case but don't really demonstrate it empirically

57:40.780 --> 57:45.260
and yet instantaneously this was one of the few things that was thrown at me

57:45.260 --> 57:50.380
when I explained how RNA virology is done and it's done this way

57:50.380 --> 57:54.940
they said yeah but it's the same it's not the same

57:54.940 --> 57:58.380
it's not the same because you don't have to just make enough for a cell culture

57:58.380 --> 58:00.700
you don't have to just make enough for a mouse

58:00.700 --> 58:03.980
you don't have to just make enough to put in the freezer to alquat and send

58:03.980 --> 58:08.620
to your friends you can make leaders of it

58:08.780 --> 58:12.780
as Vincent Rancin Yellow said so eloquently about the

58:12.780 --> 58:16.780
about the scaling up of the production of the RNA shot we're going from

58:16.780 --> 58:21.980
nanograms to kilograms and the only way to do that would be to do it this way

58:21.980 --> 58:27.180
to make a clone of the RNA a dna clone

58:27.740 --> 58:31.180
and until I really figured this out and could teach people the

58:31.180 --> 58:34.780
significance of this nobody cared who I was everybody just kind of

58:34.780 --> 58:40.220
casually ignored me and it wasn't until then now that these people from the

58:40.220 --> 58:43.420
human genome project and everywhere else started to

58:43.420 --> 58:47.660
actually say that I was crazy that I was nuts that I didn't know what I was

58:47.660 --> 58:51.420
talking about and not without not with a good

58:51.420 --> 58:57.980
scientific rebuttal but with insults and half-witted rebuttals

58:57.980 --> 59:00.940
twice actually to my face where I was able to

59:00.940 --> 59:06.220
respond immediately and then eventually just on twitter after blocking me

59:06.220 --> 59:10.460
and so we've looked at sequencing of these clones and we've noticed

59:10.460 --> 59:13.980
that even when we use sequencing that is supposed to find

59:13.980 --> 59:19.660
a larger quantity of the total RNA that doesn't even need the RNA to be

59:19.660 --> 59:24.460
used reverse transcriptase and PCR it up again just be using the raw RNA

59:24.460 --> 59:29.500
we still we still find a very significant difference between the total

59:29.500 --> 59:32.300
number of genomic RNAs we can identify

59:32.300 --> 59:37.020
and the number of subgenomic RNAs that we record from and see

59:37.020 --> 59:40.380
the reason why that's important is because what Robert Malone said in that

59:40.380 --> 59:43.660
video the vast majority of viral particles are

59:43.660 --> 59:48.220
replication incompetent I think it's because virology knows that these

59:48.220 --> 59:52.220
subgenomic RNAs get packaged in exosomes and excreted

59:52.220 --> 59:56.860
just as quick or quicker than the full genomes that are produced in small

59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.780
quantity and so when they harvest these particles

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.220
when they harvest these RNAs they don't find the signal that you would think

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.020
they found two full genomes in this experiment too

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:15.020
with the human coronavirus 229e done in 2019 right before the start of the

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.420
pandemic basically illustrating the very phenomenon that

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.260
Robert Malone would explain on a podcast about a year later that

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.940
the vast majority of particles are replication incompetent they could

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:30.940
make you they could make your lungs be irritated

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:35.900
they could cause inflammation but unless one of those two genomes there got in

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.220
you and successfully started to replicate even

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:42.140
though it's missing something here the pink one is

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.940
you'd have nothing

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.980
and so of course this was already seen years ago

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.580
and already known years ago because we've been using this kind of cloning

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.700
technology these shortcuts to making large quantities of the

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.900
same RNA in order to study these things because

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.860
there's no other way to do it and when we've done it we've always found the

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.260
same thing here's the subgenomic RNA just a shadow

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.540
and then we go all the way down here to the spike protein that's just a giant

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.860
number

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.660
and so i'm pretty sure that what you have is just a giant quantity of

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.660
incompetent particles with a few competent particles and so they have

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.180
exaggerated the fidelity of this system

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:28.700
they've exaggerated the danger of it and they've exaggerated the potential

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.660
for pandemic and instead what's likely true

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.860
is that these signals are found everywhere and they've confounded a

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.300
background signal for spread

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.100
and so the viral swarm is a very simple idea that

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.020
everybody seems not to not to like they all

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.660
are simultaneously on the idea that a clone can go around the world all at the

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:57.820
same time the smoking gun of the endo-nuclease sites

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:04.620
but none of them want to talk about the aspect of that that that that means that

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:10.460
i was right and so now the only question is whether or not that clone spreads

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.540
like a regular virus does and i don't think it can because a regular virus

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.900
can't and because a clone would necessarily have less

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:24.620
diversity and have less of the natural phenomenon whatever that is

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.220
and the natural phenomenon can't do it then i don't know why the clone would do

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.140
it the clone could actually go farther because its purity is higher at the

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:37.180
beginning it's it's it's competent particle ratio

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:41.580
might be higher at the beginning because of the nature of clone production

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:45.100
and none of these people are interested in that even though they're all

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.780
agree that wow it must have been endo-nuclease sites must mean it came from

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.900
a laboratory they must have used the no-seum technique

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.460
no they made infectious clones and then ceded the narrative with it

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:03.260
and all these people still believe that that RNA can pandemic and so therefore

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:07.980
they've confounded the two ideas no clones are real clones can be used to

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.740
seed the story but clones cannot pandemic because RNA can't do it

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.940
you can make enough to make it look like it but you can't

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.620
so we got to make RNA real again we got to return it to the laws

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:23.100
and we got to make RNA clones real again the potential for what they are

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.820
it's just quantity and so that's just the story of the trackable gain a

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.580
function RNA that went pandemic that that's just the first

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:36.780
aspect of this the transfection of course we've also been on like flies on

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:41.580
on do-do for a very long time nobody wants to give us credit for that

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.900
everybody wants to say it's what are we done now the double-stranded DNA

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.940
shall we break this down again one time for the cheap seats

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.100
transfection is criminally negligent why is that

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.500
well that's because first and foremost transfection is a term all academic

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.820
biologists should know and should have known

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.460
at the start of the pandemic i guess i'll disappear

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.540
when the words get to my hand so transfection has been used for decades on

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.660
the lab bench and there are countless faculty members of

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.060
countless universities in the united states

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.820
who should have known that lipid nanoparticles carrying a modified RNA

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.460
are no different than the crap that they use on their bench

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.460
and they should have never considered this in healthy humans as a reasonable

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.500
response to whatever they call the pandemic

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.700
so all of these people should be ashamed of themselves

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.740
everybody that i worked with at the university of pittsburgh

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.180
should be ashamed of themselves for not knowing that transfection was

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:39.500
stupid in healthy humans never mind healthy children or healthy

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:44.140
college kids that you're teaching you should apologize to every class that

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.740
you teach this year say why was i a dumbass for advocating for you guys to

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.940
transfect yourself and the reason why is because

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.100
transfection in the purest form would have been inappropriate

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.580
if you produced it with the finest PCR and the finest printer

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.940
it would still be inappropriate to use a lipid nanoparticle to carry this

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.980
shit all over anybody's body why because transfection challenges

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.860
the immune system in its best case scenario

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.820
to still have to attack the body without making mistakes

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.300
transfection using chemically altered and codon optimized RNA as many known and

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.020
unknown consequences that cannot contribute to good

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.620
outcomes regardless of purity and those do include

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:33.180
wobbles they do include stop codons and they do include frame shifting

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:38.140
but we already knew that we knew that from the first two visits of kevin

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:45.500
macernan on my stream why aren't we talking about that now

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.780
we also knew that the use of RNA produced with the commonin methods was

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.180
gonna have like bacterial cultures we're gonna have

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.580
additional sources of adulteration we knew that this is not some kind of

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.860
special story why are they selling it to us like

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.900
it's a big discovery they've known this for decades

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:07.740
this is how you make antibodies the reason why is because the RNA was

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:11.900
impure they knew that already they knew that endotoxins would be present

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.020
they knew that the DNA could likely contaminate it they knew that because

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.980
they can't separate it in the traditional way that they do

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.460
when they're making other biologics that are protein-based

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.580
and the use of an untested nanoparticle carrier

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.580
known to travel freely will have countless unknown consequences detectable and

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.980
undetectable in the short and long term we are talking about something that is

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.180
only chemically inert in the preparation itself and not

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.580
when it's in your body if that's not a lie i don't know

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.980
what is

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:48.220
if if peter colas standing in front of a room say well we can't we we wasted

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.100
lots of people's lives on trying to get this to go someplace

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.220
and we're still not there yet and it doesn't understand the

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.500
huge contradiction between that and having a scotch when they told him it

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.020
was 95 percent effective i don't know what to tell you there must be some

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:05.580
pretty dumb people in academia who the repetitive ritual of

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:10.540
paparian falsification has just blanked their mind

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.980
but that seems to be the state of it

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.980
and so the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and dangerous than the spread of

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:25.260
any RNA molecule mostly because RNA molecules can't pandemic

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:29.180
and so now the latest thing is is that the spike was a weaponized pre-on that's

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.700
the worst-case scenario to come it's an interesting worst-case scenario because

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.420
it comes right out of the spars pandemic document

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.620
it's like page 48

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.780
i think it's a known side effect and an expected side effect of mass

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.780
transfection i think it was a known side effect of

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.860
using modified RNA in people i think they knew

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.780
that they would get this because modified RNA goes through the ribosome so

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.980
terribly i mean regular RNA goes through the ribosome so

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.780
terribly that we occasionally have misfolding disorders

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.500
so what the world would modified RNA do they knew that

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.260
and that's why they seeded the narrative with team worst-case scenario clown

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.780
show from the very beginning at the start of the pandemic so that we would

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.900
misconstrue the effects of the spike with the effects of the

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.740
transfection but what aspects of the spike are

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.340
pre-onogenic how long are these sequences that are pre-onogenic

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.260
what kinds of homologies do they have to the pre-on protein that is thought to

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.460
be responsible for the material process of this happening in vivo

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.660
none of these people are talking about this they're just saying pre-on pre-on

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.900
pre-on here's a nature paper

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:45.180
here's a nature uh disease tutorial or something like that

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.020
with a little cartoon so that we can understand how prions work and i'm

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:53.900
just going to read from the caption here

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:59.100
according to the pre-on hypothesis the protein only hypothesis and its

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:04.780
refinements in the base state one this one says pre-on

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:10.860
this one says pr pc so that's the cellular pre-on protein okay

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.420
the cellular pre-on protein isn't they're not going to tell you what that does

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:20.540
but it's there and it's normal and then a pre-on comes along

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.540
and it bumps into the pre-on protein the cellular pre-on protein so that's

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.820
number one in the base state prions comprise

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:31.740
solely or predominantly a misfolded form of cellular

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.900
pre-on protein so this is the misfolded one

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:40.540
propagation of prions is thought to occur by ceded polymerization

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:45.500
whereby the seed compromises a parallel register beta-pleated sheet

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.860
form of the pre-on protein that is stabilized in a

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:56.780
fibrilliar polymer by intermolecular hydrogen bonding so

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.340
you have the pre-on protein and it changes into a configuration that's more of a

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.780
baited pleated sheet and the interaction between the

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:11.020
the amino acids greatly stabilizes the form in the baited pleated sheet form

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:18.780
really stabilizes it in pre-on disease this is number two

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:26.540
new monomers bind and misfold and are thus added to the ends of the fibrill

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:32.780
and new seeds are created by fragmentation so they they bind together

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.060
and then now you see that this blue protein is going to

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.940
unfold and refold into the beta-pleated sheet that is complementary to

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:45.820
the other pre-on that it just touched and then if these fragment then they can go

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.420
on and you know spread out and and do more damage like the ghost

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.380
busters so pre-ons are resist i'll say there are

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:59.260
several other distinct features of the mechanisms of pre-on disease pathogenesis

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.180
pre-ons are resistant to physiochemical destruction meaning that they can

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.780
contaminate the wild or farmed environment leading to episodic

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.380
episodic disease and infect medical products such as

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.980
cadaver derived human growth hormone and part

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.740
manufactured cadaver derived dura matter

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.580
i don't know what that's used for pre-ons adhere to surgical steel and other

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.540
services where they can resist conventional sterilizing methods

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.060
allowing transmission of disease via surgical instruments

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:32.700
pre-ons exist in distinct distinct strains but are encoded by a structure

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.820
rather than a genome so that's a whoops sorry

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.060
that's a pretty bold statement dang it i'm going the wrong way again

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.980
i'm going to keep reading i want to get that thing playing again

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:51.500
here we go pre-ons adhere to surgical steel so pre-ons exist in distinct

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:56.700
strains that's three down here can you see my arrow here

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.460
but are encoded by a structure rather than a genome pre-on strains are thought to

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.140
comprise a quasi species

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:09.100
or distribution of abnormal structures each of which may have different

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.220
kinetic properties and pre-delections for

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:19.180
predilections for different tissue types transmission between animals or

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.780
humans particularly if this involves different primary

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.940
sequences or polymorphisms of i believe that's the pre-on protein

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:31.100
may involve the strains selection of minority confirmations present in the

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.900
quasi species or even provoke strain mutations to

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:37.660
generate new strains in this way pre-ons may

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:42.380
appear to evolve by Darwinian selection i mean there's no citations here this is

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:46.140
just a story they're telling of possibilities keep that in mind

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:50.780
i got clicked again i didn't mean to click shoot

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:56.460
oh i clicked up here sorry um in this way

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.860
pre-ons may appear to evolve so pre-ons are tolerated by the host immune

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.020
system and spread between cells and organs this is for

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:11.260
here several mechanisms of spread have been proposed including direct contact

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.060
between cell services tunneling nanotubes that's pretty much like uh

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:21.260
like how coronavirus was supposed to spread remember

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:26.220
exosomes and other extracellular vesicles and simply after cell damage and

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.380
release into the surrounding interstitial fluids or blood

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.300
pre-ons can cross the blood the gut wall and amplifying the peripheral

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.380
lymphole reticular system they are thought to invade the central nervous

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.060
system by retrograde transport on splanic nerves

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.580
toxicity and pre-on diseases has been intensively studied in several

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.780
complementary mechanisms are being investigated

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.140
that's number five there are some evidence that pre-ons

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.540
themselves are not directly neurotoxic rather i

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.820
hypothesize pre-on related substance may be produced

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:01.180
once pre-on propagation is saturated in a host

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:05.420
so they have another ship in a bottle type variable there could be a toxin

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:09.020
that's produced uh relevant factors may include membrane

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.140
distortions interactions of pre-ons with ion channels

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.700
loss of support or toxic factors secreted by microglia astrocytes abnormal

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:21.260
autophagy activation of the unfolded protein response whatever that is

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:28.620
and loss of pik fy ve i don't know what that is and i'm not

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:33.020
shame to say it um upr then that's the that's the uh

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:38.620
the key there and so for the identification of infectious

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:45.500
protein and they're pre-cluded they don't need to have RNA they just

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.460
they make copies of themselves by for forcing other proteins related to them

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.660
i guess to change to their configuration

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.380
which is an extraordinary mechanism to claim given that we

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:03.420
i've heretofore been told that the structure and tertiary form of a protein

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.060
is primarily dependent on its sequence in composition of that sequence

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.340
so if the propensity to form a pre-on

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:15.180
is completely encoded in its structure

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.340
and structure of a protein is related to its sequence it's still hard to get

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:24.060
out of that loop and yet somehow or another in pre-on biology

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.420
we're supposed to believe that the structure of the protein i guess is

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.460
somewhat secondary into a certain extent that's possible

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:35.420
because there are related um amino acids it's not impossible for that to be

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.900
the case but i just want you to see where you

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.500
not what exercises you need to do what muscles you need to exercise in your

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.940
head to start thinking about this in a useful way

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.140
so start thinking about what is the sequence of a pre-on protein

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.940
and to what extent is that sequence flexible and still able to generate

01:15:52.940 --> 01:16:01.660
the the very hyper stable infectious form and how would that be related to the

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:06.060
attractor state of function that presumably would exist on any of these

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:10.220
proteins that get usurped into being a pre-on

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.500
because it's not going around finding garbage right or is it

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.860
maybe that's what it is maybe that's what vetner vetner was talking about is

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.700
that the garbage that's produced from from ribosomes tends to be the

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.820
possible here but now the base state always requires a

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.860
pre-on protein to be present the base state requires

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:33.180
the the native pre-on protein to then be

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.980
induced to misfold that's already part of the model so don't lose that

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.500
even when you read this and it seems like oh there can be new strains and

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:46.060
stuff like that no no no no no no no the new strains are all based on

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.540
the the native pre-on protein they have to be by definition by the

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.780
by this model and yet somehow or another

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.900
the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1997 when in 1997 they didn't know squat about

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:04.060
this yet it was still hand waving about what

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.780
was going on if you could see it as being

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:12.860
almost a forced Nobel Prize the people that got the Nobel Prize in 2014

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.820
have been working on place cells for 20 years

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:22.140
or longer 30 years and lots of other laboratories were recording place cells

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:25.980
and grid cells for many years before the Nobel Prize was rewarded for

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.260
the discovery of those things there should have been lots of labs all

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.340
around the world confirming his work and showing that pre-ons are real and

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:36.860
describing the mechanism and the whole problem should have been solved

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.900
when they gave the award to him but I don't think it was

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:45.020
and I think if you go through a few like let's say reviews on pre-ons and you

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.540
start to go down the list of their bibliography

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:53.980
I think we're going to find together that that the pre-on biology that exists

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.900
out there is a lot of conjecture and a lot of exaggeration it seems like

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:03.500
primarily to make their field more impactual than it is in nature

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.580
do these things exist in the sheep and stuff like that in goats I think so

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:12.780
but primarily way to study it is to inject this crap right into the brain

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.220
you can't just smear it on their lips and wait

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:21.100
and so there's a lot of hand waving that goes on again primarily with

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:26.300
the laboratory models so we're going to go back to Stanley Prusner's papers from

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:31.820
2000 this one's from 1991 and then another paper

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:37.020
from 1998 and so basically these two papers are

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:42.300
going to provide us with a daily task of walking through a couple papers

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:47.900
about scrappy or about any of these crowdsfeld yachab type variants so that

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.740
we can start to understand to what extent we really get it

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.180
to what extent these are real phenomenon to what extent we understand the

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.540
mechanisms behind it and to what extent we're still spinning our

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.140
wheels assuming that this is something that we need to

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:07.020
fear as a worst-case scenario I think it's really important because

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.500
it is a possibility that transfection has a very big downside and that

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.700
downside is this and it could be that they've already known that

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:18.460
that downside is coming and so seeding this narrative is important for

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.020
them to get ahead of it so that they can also have

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.620
this debunking narrative going already so that that dichotomy

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.900
that limited spectrum of debate is present in the coming years as this

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.100
stuff becomes more and more prevalent in younger and younger people

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:37.740
it's possible it's also just a giant distraction to make sure that we don't

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.700
talk about transfection being a really bad idea in healthy humans or talk

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.300
about how intramuscular injection is just a ridiculous way

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.820
of trying to augment the immune system instead we'll talk about prion so we're

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:52.700
not going to waste weeks and weeks on it and

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:57.740
fortunately the biology of prion disease doesn't require weeks and weeks

01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.300
so I went back four years for this slide or I guess three years for this slide

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.660
three in some change they changed the way we think about all

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.460
cause mortality they changed the way we think about the

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.900
coronavirus swarm and you might even think a little differently you might

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.380
just say they they changed the way we think about

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.780
background signals and they made us believe that there are none

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.140
there are no background signals to be confounded there are no errors to be

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.140
made we can give you a 17 battery PCR test

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.180
and tell you all the viruses that are there and what they're doing

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:32.300
that's what they want you to believe and they've changed the way you think

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.100
about that is being relevant because everybody thinks they're going to get

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.700
tested when they go into the hospital now they've changed the way you think

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.220
about your immune system and how it works and how it gets activated

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.540
how this cells migrate in response to an infection and then migrate back again

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.940
and what that migration signifies also changed the way you think about

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.900
linked recognition and why linked recognition would be so much more

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.220
powerful in an infection versus the linked recognition that occurs

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:03.820
during a a transfection and of course we spent months explaining that in 2020

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:08.380
in 2021 and in 2022 and all of these people

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.580
that I call medlers have basically ignored this

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.860
none of them have even said the word linked recognition even though it's

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.620
probably the most important mechanism of the acquired immune

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.980
branch of the immune response and so we'll go on and we'll teach that again

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.620
because that's important we'll do that in April as well

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.900
they've changed the way we think about the concept of vaccination and they

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.260
have done that for a wide variety of reasons but they really want you to

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.500
believe that intramuscular injection is some way of augmenting it and it's not

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.180
and so we'll go through this list again as well because this list hasn't changed

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.940
we nailed it already three years ago and all of these medlers

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:48.300
all of these members of teamwork case scenario have done their best to tip

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:53.260
toe around it because they have to because they're they signed on the page

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.180
to try and confound the effects of the virus with the expected effects of the

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.260
transfection so that would nobody would figure out the extent of the damage

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:06.300
that had been done and that the past would fade into a mist it could be

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:09.420
erased and the eraser would be forgotten and then the

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:14.700
lie would become the truth we're close to this happening

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.060
we're close to this happening because of the coordinated efforts of so many

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.580
people around the world on social media and are allowing them

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.300
to give them their attention we take our attention away from them we will

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.580
already be a little bit better off if we get out of the car

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:33.820
that we are stuck with them in and we will already be better off

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:38.220
but that won't fix the problem because action is still required

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.660
we still need to act on behalf of our young people so that they start to

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.620
understand this so that they see that they've been

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:50.140
governed by a coordinated group of people who agree to lie about this so that we

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.900
can be governed by it this worst case scenario where

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.260
mystery virus is responsible for excess deaths and where you lie about

01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:00.620
everything you lie about pulse oximeters and

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.620
oxygen levels you lie about do not resuscitate orders and ventilators

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.860
and antibiotic use and steroids and you were at lie about remdesivir

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.380
medazalam and opioid deaths and death certificate fraud you lie about

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.860
financial incentives that led to all of the above

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.460
you lie about tracking traces ever even happening you lie about the year that

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.540
you supported masks you lie about the year that you advocated for closures

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.740
and you lie about the year where you didn't necessarily think mandates were

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:30.380
that bad you lie about PCR fraud by not even acknowledging it you lie

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.820
about lateral flow test fraud by not acknowledging it and you lie about

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:37.740
sequencing fraud by not acknowledging it

01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.980
and by agreeing to do all of this stuff essentially

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.580
a huge wave of medicare costs have been avoided

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.580
essentially they never are going to address the real issue which is that

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:53.020
pharmaceutical products should have strict liability they never are going to

01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:56.220
address the issue that the prep act is a fundamental violation of our

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:00.140
seventh mentor amendment right to sue

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.420
and of course they're not going to talk about zero epidemiological evidence of

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.740
spread the idea that if 24 000 people could be killed in four weeks in

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:11.820
new york you better expect a few more people to die in new jersey than died

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.740
and so as i've said yesterday and i'll say again these people are pretending to

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.620
be part of a phenomenon that they are not a part of

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.420
they are pretending to usefully contribute to something that they

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.780
haven't usedfully contributed to and the way that they've done it is by

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.180
occupying your consciousness with their act

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.060
by occupying your consciousness with their

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:47.660
censorship with their loss of income with their loss of a job

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.980
when in reality they didn't lose a job they traded

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:57.020
they traded up most of the time they went from having to do something to

01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:02.620
just being a tenure track professor on sub-stack

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:06.540
and they continue to tell the same story that they've been telling for years

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.140
already and nobody seems to notice

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:13.580
all the incongruencies that have been identified over the last four years

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:18.540
that are listed here haven't been adequately described by Pierre Corrie or

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:22.300
Robert Malone or any of these people they've never taken a whack at it because

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:26.940
that's not their job their job is to sustain the myth

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:33.020
of the novel virus of gain of function of a rushed response and a lot of

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:37.580
mistakes and a general need for amnesty at this point

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:40.940
because you know we've got to come together because we all want the same

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:43.180
thing

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:48.540
when in reality they are still lying to us they're still governing us by these

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:52.060
stories still we are arguing about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:57.340
yet steven hatville is the guy who's going to release a book about it

01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.300
Pierre Corrie's got the only other book about it

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.580
the guy who said that one of the biggest uh

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:08.540
symptomologies of of the covid pandemic in in new york at the time was

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.580
low pulse ox

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:18.540
and so here we are identifying such a huge piece of the puzzle this

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:25.020
wanton use of of of supplemental oxygen most likely led to the demise of

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:29.580
thousands of people nobody will talk about it

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:33.100
and as i've just delineated on a slider few or earlier

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.620
there's a lot of things besides double-stranded DNA

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.180
for you to object to with regard to transfection in your children

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.380
but they want you to focus on double-stranded DNA so that your brain will

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:48.460
circle back to the all we rushed it and that means there's a potential to

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.060
make this better and that's why all the people

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:56.620
that you know that have invented this or cut their teeth in the human genome

01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:00.220
project they're all working together to do the same thing which is to

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:05.900
try and absolve the transfection for rushing it

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:11.100
the diffuse proposal is a proposal of that was leaked by the people

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.860
that want that story to take hold that want you to believe that there was a

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:18.220
fear and cleavage site and that that was really important

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.700
that a few amino acids could endow an RNA molecule with the potential to

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.940
pandemic whereas before it would not be able to pandemic that's the magic

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:33.100
that's the story they tell you and it's a part of this this

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:36.140
useless narrative

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:41.580
and so the pandemic was created with past papers it was created with tabletop

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.140
exercises it was created with an illusion

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:48.540
generated by mash casualty events that were misconstrued as a

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:53.340
the start of something big and then modelers went off of that

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.660
news programs went off of that and there was a team worst case scenario in

01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:00.620
the backwoods of the internet that was also going off that spreading the

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:03.900
worst case scenario billions of people could die

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:08.700
and the lab leak argument was part of creating that illusion that

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.820
wow I mean if they're covering up a lab leak then this could really be the

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:15.900
worst case scenario and they might really be lying about it

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:18.540
and it's possible that people like Pierre Corey

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.980
were actually sucked up into that potential at very early on

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.260
and if they were sucked up into that potential very early on then some of

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:30.300
the messaging that they did may have been based on that scare

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:33.580
and so a simple confession of saying that well these people brought me in a

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.620
room and told me that there was a gain of function virus that was going

01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:39.900
around the world and we had to have 100 compliance

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.460
and so they needed me to go on and say these things

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.660
and now in retrospect I really regret it because I think if I wouldn't have said

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:48.300
those things a lot more people would be alive right now

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:54.860
that would be a tide turning moment if someone could get the cojones

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:58.620
to actually confess that they didn't know what was going on that somebody

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:01.580
lied to them about the worst case scenario early on and that's why they

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:05.980
bought into it and now it's too late for them to turn around

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:12.940
that's how I felt when I confessed over a year and a half ago now

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:16.700
to having been bamboozled by this idea that gain of function could go around the

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:22.700
world and definitely could go endemic and so now we've all been fooled

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.340
we all still think that it's possible that this

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:28.860
gain of function spike is going to be responsible for all kinds of crazy

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.140
things and that residual idea is still going to

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:36.780
defeat it but we don't actually burn it down

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:43.260
Specialization is always that if you analyze the politics of science

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.020
the specializations should make you suspicious it should because it's gotten

01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.780
harder to evaluate what's going on and it's presumably gotten easier for people

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:53.980
to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be you know a little bit

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:56.860
suspicious and that's that's uh that's sort of my starting

01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.260
my starting bias and that's why I show it because I do

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.500
think it's actually possible that the security state the biosecurity state

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:10.700
the public health state the FDA the CDC the who

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.980
all of these non-governmental organizations all of these weaponized

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.780
piles of money have a vested interest in us

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:20.220
believing in vaccinations they have a vested interest to us

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:24.140
in believing in pandemic potential they have a vested interest in us believing

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:28.380
that false positives are very rare and that these diagnostics are the new

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:33.100
best thing since buttered bread they have a vested interest in us believing

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:38.220
that this is a continued evolution of an endemic virus that started in 2020

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.980
and so that we will continue to think we need to be augmented against it

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.940
they need us to believe that they're spending money on gain-of-function

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.500
viruses so that this potential will exist in perpetuity and that we will

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.980
teach it to our children we can't let it happen

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:58.220
I don't I don't I think you understand that we can't let that happen

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.660
and so the way to prevent that happening is to show our children admit what

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:06.060
happened admit what we allowed to happen we allowed them to get rid of this

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:10.060
exponential Medicare cost by killing our old people we allowed them

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:14.940
to protect against the growing skepticism of vaccines with this lockdown and

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.100
insistence that this thing is working we are allowing them to transition to a

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.140
digital currency in a controlled manner if we don't speak up

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:26.860
we are allowing them to genetically to change to genetic vaccines across

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.340
the elderly population nobody's speaking up

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.620
we are allowing them to confound the toxicity of the virus with

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:36.780
transfection by not speaking up we are allowing them to transition our youth

01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:42.780
into full submission by allowing them to go to these universities unsupervised

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.620
I think one of the best ways to disrupt this system would be to keep all of our

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.380
young people from going to university for the next five years we would ruin

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.660
them I don't know what to do with all those kids

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:58.780
that's the problem we need to have a plan for what to do with them

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.660
once we have a plan for what to do with them I think it's a real plan

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.940
something that we could encourage and try to do in the next couple years

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.700
they have disrupted family formation and that was by design and they don't

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:12.380
they're very happy with it they have shortened a lifespan of billions of

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.140
people it probably has nothing to do with prions or amyloid it probably just

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:20.140
has to do with autoimmunity and the gradual degradation of the immune

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.860
system that was accelerated by transfection and

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:28.140
and the autoimmunity reaction necessary to combat it

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.700
we don't know

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.380
kill billions of people with a gain of function virus

01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:39.580
to destroy the cultural fabric of America and the rest of western society

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:43.500
and to help create chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.380
the world is governed absolutely

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.740
and so if you want us to get out the way out is to advocate for a pause on the

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.100
childhood vaccine schedule in America because of its extreme

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:59.180
and the dosages investigate that's I'm not saying that all vaccines are good

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:03.020
I'm saying that if you want to argue this to people who are still locked in

01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.420
you can't start with vaccines don't work you can start with intramuscular

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:10.220
injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.580
the immune system is dumb and then you can go to

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.500
comparing the vaccine schedule in America to any other vaccine schedule

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:22.300
and then suggest okay now even if you think intramuscular injection is okay

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:25.740
which it's not think about this schedule compared to this schedule

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:29.980
what does it tell you about what they think about our children

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.980
investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause those mass casualty events

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:37.900
that's Jessica Hockett and other investigate the use of mass casualty

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:41.180
events and transfection perhaps to create the illusion of the pandemic

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:44.860
especially the sequencing reactions that were

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.460
said to be the source of the original sequences

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.420
regain sovereignty over your bodies get out of the who in the UN

01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:54.860
entirely would be a great way to do it and if you want to find the people who

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:57.420
are meddling with us you just got to look for the fact that they don't

01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.940
actually talk about the childhood vaccine schedule is being a problem

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.420
they never use the word strict liability even though they might be a lawyer

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:08.540
they never or rarely use the idea that the mass

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.940
protocol that the deadly protocols were

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.260
overwhelmingly responsible for what happened and when they do they still say

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:19.180
but I'm sure there was a novel virus they don't use the word transfection and

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:22.460
if they do they use it very sparingly and not in the way that it could be

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.540
used they they don't use the word clone to explain

01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:30.540
anything about virology they attack people instead of ideas

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.980
and they are unable to summarize across the entire show and now you might say

01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:39.180
J you attack people but I attack people that have lied

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.780
to me I attack people that I've shaken their hand

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:46.220
and then they've stabbed me in the back later

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:50.780
and when I attack them I attack them for what they said

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:54.540
I attack them for what they said and then contradicted

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:59.740
I attack them for what they said and I can't say

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.300
some of the people that I call out regularly are people that

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:08.700
have said things to my face in front of other people that are just so

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:14.380
abhorrent that you can't even repeat them you can't even tell the story

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:17.260
so you're just going to have to accept that for the way it is but I'm not like

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:22.860
Tucker Carlson I don't lie I've never lied

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.900
because I'm not bound by a limited spectrum of debate I'm not trying to

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.820
trap your grandchildren I'm not trying to get rich

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:37.420
I'm just trying to make ends meet while doing what I feel like is the only thing

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.340
left for me to do maybe even the thing that I was kind of

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.300
born to do in a way

01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:51.100
we are at a time point where human diversity is as at a peak for all time

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:56.220
and so they need the go games I've got a great video of of of Kurtzweiler

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.100
that I'm going to watch tomorrow that's going to blow your mind

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.580
he basically explains this very very succinctly about what we need and why

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:08.700
we need it we need a billion genomes we actually don't need all of them

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.620
which is kind of funny the reason why is because artificial general

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.780
intelligence is right around the corner

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:19.580
Kurtzweiler says that we're going to cure all diseases by the end of the 2030s

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:25.420
so all he has to do is bridge living until the 2030s and then

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:29.020
he will make it to the point where technology will make him immortal he says

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:34.620
these words that's the kind of stuff that these people believe

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.540
that they've been telling the heads of these weaponized piles of money as

01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:41.020
possible

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:46.780
and this mythology is what makes the world go around right now makes the lies

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.700
sustainable makes this spectacular commitment to these lies

01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.180
sustainable is the weaponized piles of money and the comfort that they can

01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:59.180
provide they are lying about AI ladies and gentlemen

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.940
AI can be used to control you AI can be used to influence you just like a

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:07.260
newspaper can language is not some big trick

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:11.820
language is a very simple system that we have

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:16.140
tricked ourselves into believing is is somehow magically an evidence of

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.260
intelligence that they can come up with a response

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.660
these large language models are nothing more than an elaborate illusion

01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:26.860
they're not going to wake up tomorrow they're not going to take over like

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:30.780
Skynet but if we don't pay attention to what's

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.300
going on right now the men with those machines the

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:38.220
women with those machines will able we'll be able to control us

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:43.180
just like Edward Bernays said not because AI is a general intelligence

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.420
not because it it takes over but just because there are ways to program a

01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:52.060
computer so that you don't see what you should see on social media so that you

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:55.020
see something that's completely fake and you don't

01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:00.540
know it that's what's coming and so let's be sure

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.700
that we are not afraid let's be sure that we are telling the truth

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.340
let's be sure that we are frank please stop all transfections in humans

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:11.980
because they are whoops that's sorry i'm not going to play that now

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.700
i'll play the regular song i don't know why that one was queued up

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:20.300
uh stop all transfections and help the humans because they are trying to

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.860
eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:26.540
so tomorrow let's do our first journal club on prions we'll look at those first

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:30.620
two papers and see what kind of summary we had in

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:36.460
91 what kind of summary we had in 1998 about the state of the art of prions

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:41.820
when the when the Nobel Prize was awarded and then we'll see what potential for

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:46.540
prionogenesis the spike protein might have or what what experiments have done

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:51.100
which shown show the potential for prionogenesis

01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:54.540
in the spike proteins because i have a feeling there's going to be

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:58.220
there's going to be a lot of gray areas here a lot less certainty than is being

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.500
portrayed by some of these worst case scenario members

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:05.260
and then after we burnt this tree down to the ground we'll get back to working

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:08.460
on immunology and we'll get back to working on

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:14.140
the coming artificial biology and trying to work on on hammering down and

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:19.820
beating back the transhumanist agenda and the idea that they're

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:23.980
almost there they're not almost there we got to make our kids aware of the

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:26.140
sacred biology we got to make our kids aware of the

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.540
irreducible complexity that that is the real beauty of biology

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:35.020
and once they can appreciate that um then all of these mythologies will be

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:39.900
useless against them and will be useless um it will it won't mean anything to

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:43.340
them at all don't forget

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:57.900
thanks a lot for joining me guys i really appreciate it thanks for staying

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:01.100
with me um

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:05.740
tomorrow's our first journal club in a long time i'm looking forward to it

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:21.900
you
