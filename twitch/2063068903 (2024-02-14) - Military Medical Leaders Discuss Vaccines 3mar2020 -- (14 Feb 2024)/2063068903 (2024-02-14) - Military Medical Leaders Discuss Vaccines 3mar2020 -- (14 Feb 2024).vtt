01:00.000 --> 01:29.840
I don't have the sound alerts.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.120
It's on the blank scene here.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.760
I apologize for that for playing that biology chant.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.640
If you play it when I'm on screen or when there are any graphics on, then we'll hear

01:41.640 --> 01:42.640
it.

02:29.840 --> 02:37.320
I think truth is good for kids.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.960
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.160
We want everybody to feel good.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.520
That's not the way life is.

02:49.520 --> 03:13.200
The world's protected stuff at all times, follow my instructions, keep it clean, touch

03:13.200 --> 03:16.000
gloves if you wish, let's do it.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
This is so crazy, like these bumps, this is so crazy, I feel so nervous, like what

03:23.000 --> 03:44.000
in the world, man?

03:44.000 --> 03:49.520
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, welcome to the show, this is GIGO and biological.

03:49.520 --> 03:55.120
We're a little late tonight at 20 in the hour, but that's the way it works.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.200
Sometimes you can get on during the day like I plan to, sometimes I can't.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.800
Welcome very much to the stream.

04:01.800 --> 04:06.120
If you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave, we are staying focused

04:06.120 --> 04:10.720
on the biology here, we don't take the bait on television, we love our neighbor.

04:10.720 --> 04:14.000
We're trying to rescue these skilled TV watchers down here at the bottom, the way

04:14.000 --> 04:19.600
this works is that people are donating, subscribing to the stream, and it's really, there is

04:19.600 --> 04:25.720
a small degree of momentum that's happening, you go to GIGO and biological.com, you can

04:25.720 --> 04:30.440
support the stream there with a one time little thing, you can communicate with us at GIGO

04:30.440 --> 04:41.560
and my confession is there, you can donate there, and then, whoa, hang on, you can see

04:41.560 --> 04:45.880
the schedule, and then down here at the bottom you can subscribe, and we're actually at

04:45.880 --> 04:55.720
about a 132 subscribers right now, and ideally I think if this was going to go on forever,

04:56.200 --> 05:02.600
if we were going to be here forever, we would need between 900 and 1,000 subscribers and

05:02.600 --> 05:07.560
we would be able to do this forever, and that's what we're really shooting for, I know that's

05:07.560 --> 05:15.320
a big goal, but we need to work as hard as we can to share the stream, if you can please support it,

05:16.520 --> 05:21.160
because I do want to keep it going, I do think we're making a difference, I do think that the

05:21.240 --> 05:26.920
message is getting out there, and so if you can share the work, get it out there,

05:27.960 --> 05:34.040
the independent bright web is growing very slowly, and I'm really, really excited how much progress

05:34.040 --> 05:46.920
we've made. So let's see here, I do believe I am prepared to shift over

05:46.920 --> 05:51.480
to the desktop.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.120
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga Ohm Biological, a high resistance low noise

05:58.120 --> 06:04.840
information brief brought to you by a biologist, it is the 14th of February, that's right 2024,

06:05.800 --> 06:12.440
and we are still trying to continuously push back against that big hand in the picture there,

06:13.400 --> 06:19.640
that is consciously manipulating the organized habits and opinions of the masses,

06:20.600 --> 06:26.360
and we really need to start to understand this. More importantly, we need to help our children

06:26.360 --> 06:32.280
understand how vulnerable they are to this and how easily we were misled with just a few TV

06:32.280 --> 06:40.680
channels and a few newspapers, and now it is ever ever ever easier for these kinds of ruling powers

06:40.760 --> 06:46.920
to control everything that matters, and these weaponized piles of money are what we're really

06:46.920 --> 06:56.040
up against. So I've got my empire jacket on today, I used to be a cat and magician, I used to work

06:56.040 --> 07:01.720
at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, so I was knee deep in this, I was neck deep into

07:01.720 --> 07:09.080
this, I fully believed that the vast majority of science being funded in America was a great idea,

07:09.160 --> 07:14.040
I was pretty skeptical of the just sheer amount of money they were throwing at cancer,

07:14.040 --> 07:19.800
but it never really dawned on me that the fundamental idea of how they were trying to cure it was wrong.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.960
Anyway, here we are, the principle of informed consent has been ignored for the duration of the

07:25.960 --> 07:34.440
pandemic, and it's not a lot we can seem to do about it, that's not what I want and I want this one,

07:35.320 --> 07:43.880
and so we're trying to push against this, and I went past that a little fast, because actually

07:43.880 --> 07:52.120
this hidden ruling power in our country, one proxy for it, one way to kind of understand it is how

07:52.120 --> 08:00.760
these intellectual dark web people were put in place between 2017, 18 and 19 and slowly used

08:00.840 --> 08:08.040
the algorithm and artificial means and you know, bros with shows having each other on their shows

08:08.040 --> 08:15.400
and collectively promoting each other through social media, we have an invisible sort of governance

08:15.400 --> 08:21.480
structure that influences us through social media and it shouldn't be underestimated how much of those

08:22.440 --> 08:26.680
avenues and opportunities have been harvested by the people who would like to control us.

08:27.320 --> 08:33.880
I really think we're very close to people starting to really catch on to the big picture that people

08:33.880 --> 08:40.680
like Mark and I have been able to see for quite some time. I think it's really starting to come

08:40.680 --> 08:47.800
into focus for us and we're starting to get better handles on how to share it with you and with others

08:47.800 --> 08:52.600
and so I'm very excited about it. I do think one of the bigger insights that we've had in the last

08:52.680 --> 08:58.280
six or eight months is really honing in on the idea that there was likely a coordinated worst

08:58.280 --> 09:06.440
case scenario team of medlers. People in behind the scenes funded by various sources of money,

09:06.440 --> 09:14.520
including you know, just weaponized piles of money and the idea was to fuel this worst case

09:14.520 --> 09:18.760
scenario so that the fear and uncertainty and doubt that would be necessary for people to go

09:18.760 --> 09:23.560
along with the lockdowns, to go along with the school closures and to go along with the

09:23.560 --> 09:28.040
testing and all this other yada yada that they rolled out in order to make sure that that was

09:28.040 --> 09:34.440
taken very seriously. They needed this to be taken as real and the worst case scenario is being

09:34.440 --> 09:41.480
plausible and in fact we know that this was not only drilled into number one, the publication

09:41.480 --> 09:47.800
record and number two, the upper level bureaucracy with tabletop drills. We also know that it was

09:47.800 --> 09:54.920
most likely done in a way in terms of the preparation for this or any other of such crisis,

09:54.920 --> 09:59.720
it was already drilled into those crisis preparations that when this happens,

10:00.840 --> 10:07.880
before we know how bad it is, we need the citizens of every nation in the world to take it seriously

10:07.880 --> 10:13.400
as though it is the worst case scenario in order to achieve the level of compliance that we're

10:13.480 --> 10:19.400
going to require if any of these non-pharmaceutical interventions are going to have any effect.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.800
In other words, if you don't take everybody doesn't take the masking seriously, the effect

10:23.800 --> 10:29.800
won't be significant. That's exactly what Brett Weinstein argues even now as he pseudo-apologizes

10:29.800 --> 10:33.480
for having allowed our children to be forced masks for a year and a half.

10:35.400 --> 10:41.000
Well, the effect wasn't significant. Was I dumb for advocating for masks? No, because we didn't

10:41.000 --> 10:47.080
know if they wouldn't work. That was his argument. And again, that's about teamwork case scenario.

10:47.080 --> 10:53.560
You don't have to be necessarily on board with the worst case scenario. You have to be on board

10:53.560 --> 11:00.360
with the possibility. And that's what would make the idea of wearing masks. If this was really

11:00.360 --> 11:08.120
a 50% kill rate virus, wearing masks to increase your chances of not getting it from 50% to 55%,

11:08.760 --> 11:15.800
according to Brett Weinstein might be a different difficult thing to measure, but it's definitely

11:15.800 --> 11:21.640
a significant. That's the kind of thinking that's going on in his head. As long as the numbers

11:21.640 --> 11:28.120
are small enough, they're not zero. And so since they're not zero, I wasn't wrong for advocating

11:28.120 --> 11:33.960
for this stuff. But what he doesn't see is that masking children for a year and a half and confusing

11:33.960 --> 11:39.480
adults for a year and a half with the use of lockdowns and the use of masks and goggles,

11:39.480 --> 11:46.840
which he also advocated for, created the illusion of worst case scenario as a legitimate possibility

11:46.840 --> 11:52.360
of a billion people dead, like Kevin McCarran said, a legitimate possibility.

11:55.880 --> 12:01.800
And so as we focus on the team worst case scenario, the other half of this idea of driving you into

12:01.880 --> 12:07.800
this fear, uncertainty and doubt was to get you motivated to solve the mystery of where did this

12:07.800 --> 12:13.480
thing come from? Because once you're considering that maybe I'm going to lose half of my family

12:13.480 --> 12:18.120
to this in a year and a half, you start to become very curious about where this actually came from

12:18.120 --> 12:26.040
and who's telling the truth. And that cleverly enough was also part of the orchestrated plan

12:26.040 --> 12:33.880
to make sure that they got maximum compliance. Because if they convinced the left and the right,

12:34.760 --> 12:42.200
when the mystery was solved, the conclusion is the preponderance of evidence points to a lab leak,

12:43.000 --> 12:49.640
then the worst case scenario has just been accepted. And you've just gone as far away from the truth

12:49.720 --> 12:55.880
as you possibly can if you accept that, wow, we just experienced a lab leak. It might have even been a

12:55.880 --> 13:02.600
lab release. And now you're as far away from understanding that intramuscular injection of

13:02.600 --> 13:07.640
any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb. Here is far

13:07.640 --> 13:13.560
away from understanding that is possible. And maybe you've even bought into the idea that

13:13.560 --> 13:18.520
transfection and healthy humans saved millions of lives rather than being criminally negligent.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.560
Again, as far away from the truth as you possibly could be.

13:26.760 --> 13:31.560
And if you believe that viruses are capable of circulating the globe for five years with high

13:31.560 --> 13:38.040
fidelity, and we have recorded millions of sequences as a result of this, this high fidelity,

13:38.760 --> 13:43.240
then you are as far away from the truth as you possibly can be because viruses are not pattern

13:43.240 --> 13:50.360
integrity. Holy cow, look at this. Whatever these signals are, these viruses, they're not

13:50.360 --> 13:57.960
pattern integrity. So, so we have this all cracked now, we have the broad, broad strokes of biology

13:57.960 --> 14:03.160
here. And if we can bring people to want to understand this, we have answers for this stuff.

14:03.160 --> 14:07.400
We can go as deep as they want to. And this, I think, is the way we're going to fight the spread

14:07.480 --> 14:10.680
of these bad ideas is we're going to spread good ideas.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.680
We don't have to worry about the spread of any RNA molecule right now. I assure you of that.

14:16.680 --> 14:23.320
But the illusion of consensus is still spreading. Brett Weinstein is on the Tucker Carlson show,

14:23.320 --> 14:28.200
and and Alex Jones spreading the illusion of consensus everywhere he goes.

14:28.200 --> 14:36.920
And Joe Rogan, quite around of of of PR for a guy who whose boat is sinking rapidly

14:38.280 --> 14:46.040
as the vast majority of the people on the internet realize that this guy is not the sort of thought

14:46.040 --> 14:53.080
leader that that we want him that he wants us to believe he is, and that his fans want to believe he

14:53.080 --> 15:01.160
was. But unfortunately, the real unfortunate thing is, is that a lot of the people on this

15:01.160 --> 15:06.200
screen back here were not the thought leaders that we they should have been. I was not the

15:06.200 --> 15:14.600
thought leader I should have been in 2020. And at at at some moment, I could have come to the truth

15:14.600 --> 15:21.880
had it not been for so many of these medlers. And yes, I'm very willing to blame it on other

15:21.960 --> 15:30.440
people in this scenario, because I tried my best to bounce the ideas that I'm now feeling are the

15:31.080 --> 15:37.320
closest to the target. I have been bouncing those ideas off of other people for quite some time and

15:37.320 --> 15:44.360
running into quite a lot of resistance to them. And it is with that resistance that creates the

15:44.360 --> 15:49.080
confusion and the doubt, you know, I didn't start out a virologist at the beginning of the pandemic,

15:49.080 --> 15:54.200
believe it or not. In fact, I didn't start out as an immunologist before the pandemic either.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.080
I started out as a broadly trained biologist, and a specifically trained neurobiologist.

16:02.600 --> 16:07.400
But I started with the requisite skills, which are, you know, reading and critical thinking.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.720
And so we have to push back. We're trying to organize a a sort of,

16:16.600 --> 16:20.840
uh, not we're trying to organize, we are noticing the organization

16:22.040 --> 16:25.320
of a group of people that seems to all have the same argument.

16:26.360 --> 16:32.120
And there's not a lot of coordination involved in in getting this group to finally coalesce.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.920
And so the question really is how long and how long is it going to take us to push back on this

16:38.920 --> 16:46.600
before the, the idea starts to become to penetrate just our side of the discussion where

16:46.600 --> 16:51.000
ladies and gentlemen, we need to consider the possibility there there was no significant spread

16:51.000 --> 16:57.240
of a risk pathogen. It's just not there. And that we might not understand the molecular biology

16:57.240 --> 17:01.560
as well as they think we should or they want us to believe we do.

17:01.960 --> 17:10.440
And so I've, I've been very, well, this is why that repeating. Am I pushing the wrong

17:10.440 --> 17:19.480
universal? There we go. So I wanted to do three videos of Ralph Barrick right at the beginning

17:19.480 --> 17:27.240
of the pandemic or right around the start or an hour in, an hour in a year in, because

17:27.560 --> 17:38.040
in a way, the naive betrayal of Ralph Barrick as being just this guy who's just trying to do his best

17:38.040 --> 17:46.760
to do good in the world is part of the Scooby-Doo. It's supposed to be so over the top that you think,

17:46.760 --> 17:51.960
wow, isn't it obvious that he's a bad guy? He's obviously responsible for this.

17:52.760 --> 18:00.760
Or the people who took his recipes are, maybe Alison Totura brought the recipe of this to

18:01.320 --> 18:07.560
US Amered. And that's the reason why, I don't know, in 2019, she wrote a paper with Cina Bavari

18:07.560 --> 18:12.600
about a coronavirus pandemic from China from a bat cave that needed Remdesivir.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.200
So let's watch a couple of these videos and see if we notice any patterns with the story that they

18:20.280 --> 18:27.560
tell about Ralph Barrick. And then after that, what I want to watch is a video from 2020

18:29.960 --> 18:36.600
where members of the US Department of Defense and US military are explaining how they plan to

18:36.600 --> 18:43.000
contribute to the look, the search for effective countermeasures. And this is at the beginning

18:43.000 --> 18:48.200
of March 2020. I think you're going to find this video very, very interesting. And I think I will,

18:49.160 --> 18:53.960
so we'll watch them all together. And these, I actually have only scanned one of them. The

18:53.960 --> 18:59.800
other two I didn't have before. These are both from PBS North Carolina. At least two of the three

18:59.800 --> 19:03.720
of them are from PBS North Carolina. I put them on Twitter before I even watched them.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.760
Universal specialists. That's a strange word. Universal specialists.

19:10.200 --> 19:16.200
People who have a creative toolbox that can rapidly employ that toolbox to whatever happens

19:16.200 --> 19:24.280
to come down the pipe in the future. You could say Ralph Barrick has an infectious passion for

19:24.280 --> 19:32.120
science, discovery, and coronaviruses. It's why he's known as the coronavirus hunter. I've studied

19:32.120 --> 19:41.560
coronaviruses since about 1984. I guess that's... It's hard to do the math. 36, 37 years.

19:41.560 --> 19:50.840
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 took most of the world by surprise, but not Ralph Barrick.

19:50.840 --> 19:56.040
He's been on the front lines investigating coronavirus outbreaks throughout his career.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.880
I was attracted to coronaviruses for a couple of reasons. The first reason is we knew nothing

19:59.880 --> 20:04.760
about this family of viruses. The second thing is that what little we did know suggested that

20:04.760 --> 20:09.480
they had a very unique way to replicate in the cell that had never been described for any other

20:09.560 --> 20:15.960
RNA virus. I was interested in how viruses replicate, how their genomes are organized,

20:15.960 --> 20:22.360
and how they regulate gene expression. So coronavirus, a virus that has dominated our lives,

20:22.360 --> 20:27.640
what's it look like? How does it work? I'm going to do my best here at drawing this. I'm going to

20:27.640 --> 20:36.120
draw it from the inside out. The payload of the virus is called a nucleic acid. It's an RNA

20:36.120 --> 20:41.800
molecule that sort of is wrapped around here in the middle of the virus particle. And that RNA

20:41.800 --> 20:47.880
is coated in a protein that I'm going to call the nucleic acid protein. Now surrounding that

20:47.880 --> 20:54.520
is a little bubble of fat. Projecting out from this particle are these large petalimer spikes,

20:55.160 --> 21:00.120
and it gives the virus its unique appearance in the electron microscope, and it looks like a

21:00.200 --> 21:06.760
corona, or a halo around the sun. Hence the name coronavirus. Have you ever seen the

21:06.760 --> 21:12.200
movie Alien? There's these little plant-shaped things that sort of open up those flaps opening

21:12.200 --> 21:18.600
up right on the top is what happens on the coronavirus spike, and three of them anywhere from one to

21:18.600 --> 21:24.600
three of these can open up. Here's your host cell, and there's a protein here called ACE2. It has

21:25.160 --> 21:31.240
spaces in it that this can stick into that, and once that happens, boom. That was a bad

21:33.000 --> 21:38.120
that was whoops that was oh gosh I forgot that this was this was in PowerPoint. My bad

21:38.120 --> 21:43.480
strength in my mouth. It looks like they showed a picture they weren't supposed to show there.

21:43.480 --> 21:50.440
Those little details, but scenes and antibody, they show up, and it looks like they're showing

21:50.440 --> 21:57.640
antibody picture antibodies neutralizing the virus. Have you ever seen the movie Alien? There's

21:57.640 --> 22:03.880
these little plant-shaped things that sort of open up those flaps opening up. So think of this

22:03.880 --> 22:11.160
as a little bit of worst-case scenario as well, right? You don't need to provoke the alien,

22:11.160 --> 22:16.280
you know, you don't need to provoke alien as a way of explaining this. You could also explain

22:16.360 --> 22:25.560
it like a flower or something beautiful, but they always choose war or disease, right?

22:25.560 --> 22:32.120
And combating or it's always a negative and scary thing. Now they're actually showing a picture of

22:32.120 --> 22:38.520
the alien movie. Right on the top is what happens on the coronavirus spike, and three of them

22:38.520 --> 22:43.640
anywhere from one to three of these can open up. Here's your host cell, and there's a protein here

22:43.640 --> 22:50.680
called ACE2. It has spaces in it that this... Oops, that's not the right picture, right? That's

22:50.680 --> 22:55.800
not the right picture at all. This picture is, looks like antibodies that are neutralizing the

22:55.800 --> 23:01.720
spike and preventing them from binding, which is a bad cut on the part of PBS, but maybe not,

23:01.720 --> 23:07.800
if they're trying to throw this image into your head. Stick into that, and once that happens, boom,

23:08.520 --> 23:13.960
virus goes inside the cell and affects it. Look at his face, he's so excited. Look at that.

23:21.960 --> 23:31.480
Emerge, adapt, and revert with like a virus with like jaws in the middle, looks like.

23:32.280 --> 23:43.000
I mean, I don't know, you know, it's really a little bit like, is this a Scooby-Doo villain here?

23:43.000 --> 23:50.840
Is that what a Scooby-Doo villain would put on his door? Or is it like he is definitely a

23:50.840 --> 23:55.480
bio-weapon scientist, and so they put this there to make sure that nobody actually believes he is,

23:55.480 --> 24:00.920
because nobody who is really a bio-weapon scientist would put a bio-weapons jaws picture on their door,

24:01.720 --> 24:09.960
that says Emerge, adapt, and revert? It's just so comical to me, who are supposed to take this

24:09.960 --> 24:17.000
guy seriously. He's definitely a puppet or a pawn, even if he belongs in jail, because he figured

24:17.000 --> 24:23.080
some of this stuff out. He's not the guy who masterminded any of this. Like, he researchers

24:23.080 --> 24:29.560
worked 15 hour days in secure labs under strict protocols. Everyone united in the

24:29.560 --> 24:36.120
tedious process of analyzing the virus, and then testing drugs to create a vaccine to stop it.

24:37.880 --> 24:42.040
It's been a whirlwind of, you know, just absolute pressure,

24:43.000 --> 24:47.960
enjoyed to at the same time when we figured out that a lot of these projects that we were involved

24:47.960 --> 24:53.080
with was some of the major vaccine players. In fact, two out of the five Operation Warp Speed

24:53.800 --> 24:58.840
vaccines, both Johnson and Johnson and Moderna, so it was really a good day whenever we heard that

24:58.840 --> 25:03.560
the vaccines were incredibly effective in humans and face-free clinical trials.

25:05.480 --> 25:09.000
So there he's talking about the vaccines being very effective and them being very

25:09.000 --> 25:13.320
proud of it, because they were involved in both of them. That's pretty cool. I mean, I'd be pretty

25:13.320 --> 25:20.440
proud too, right? Not only have we been involved in developing vaccines and antibody therapeutics

25:20.440 --> 25:25.560
against the COVID-19 virus, but we're also preparing for treatments and therapeutics for

25:25.560 --> 25:30.760
other cousins of the COVID-19 virus that could potentially emerge into humans later on.

25:35.320 --> 25:40.840
Gentle ability to have a very large and experienced lab, so a lot of people are working pretty

25:40.840 --> 25:45.320
independently, heading up their own projects, forming working groups of like, okay, these people

25:45.320 --> 25:49.800
are really great cloner, so they're going to work on making a molecular clone of the virus.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.960
These people are really good with primary cells, so we're going to start collaborations with the

25:53.960 --> 25:58.600
Mercico Lung Institute and really try and understand what cell types are being infected

25:58.600 --> 26:03.320
and what's happening with them. These are our core mouse users, and so these people are going

26:03.320 --> 26:10.360
to work on developing mouse models of disease. Successful vaccines create a protective immune

26:10.360 --> 26:15.240
response in the body. Let's go back to the book. So all they really need is the sequence off the

26:15.240 --> 26:19.160
internet, and then they've got the cloners over there that can make the virus, and then they got

26:19.160 --> 26:23.400
these people with the cell cultures, and they got people with the animal models,

26:24.120 --> 26:28.600
you know, the humanized mice. I mean, it's all right there for you. It's really easy to see

26:28.600 --> 26:35.560
how easy this arrogant laboratory can go from virus to gain a function disaster in a matter

26:35.560 --> 26:45.160
of weeks. It's just brilliant. I mean, I don't know what questions are left to be answered other

26:45.160 --> 26:49.240
than which one of these people is responsible for. To see just how that happens.

26:50.760 --> 26:57.400
When the virus infects you, you make a protein called an antibody, and the goal of that antibody

26:57.400 --> 27:05.800
is to bind to the virus particle and prevent it from binding into that receptor, and prevent it

27:05.800 --> 27:13.800
from infecting that cell. The Beric Labs research was also central to the creation and clinical trials

27:13.800 --> 27:20.120
of the antiviral drug Remdesivir. Antiviral medicines prevent the development of severe

27:20.120 --> 27:27.960
disease. Similar drugs are in the pipeline. We're scientists, but what drives us really in people

27:27.960 --> 27:33.880
in this field is really public health, right? Yes, we're interested in the minutiae of how does

27:33.880 --> 27:38.280
the virus get in, how does it replicate? We're interested in all those little details, but the

27:38.280 --> 27:44.360
reason we're interested in them is because it translates to public health, to what's happening

27:44.360 --> 27:51.320
in people, and what can we do to help mitigate the disease burden, the suffering among people.

27:52.680 --> 27:58.840
It was an all-hands-on-deck approach, and it turned Chapel Hill into a lab bench to bedside

27:58.840 --> 28:06.600
place of research. Lots of interaction, especially as people moved in from other research areas where

28:07.240 --> 28:12.920
they maybe didn't understand quite how coronaviruses were, but they had some ideas about lung biology,

28:12.920 --> 28:18.040
or clotting, or other aspects of disease processes, and they needed to talk to people like Ralph,

28:18.040 --> 28:24.840
so that they could really make sure that they're thinking about the nature of the disease process

28:24.840 --> 28:30.440
correctly. Is the virus in the brain? Would you expect that to happen? Is the virus targeting

28:30.440 --> 28:34.680
different tissues? A lot of these things were still trying to get the answers to.

28:34.680 --> 28:42.760
And so, really, what he's describing is that a few people are the central hubs for any answers,

28:42.760 --> 28:50.120
in this case. And so, you can basically consider the entire NIH hierarchy to be more or less

28:50.120 --> 28:57.160
briefed based on what Ralph Barrack and Mark Denison and a couple other people say is

28:57.960 --> 29:04.920
the gold standard or the running truth right now. If Ralph Barrack says coronaviruses do this,

29:04.920 --> 29:10.840
and Mark Denison says, yes, Ralph's right, then that's what they're going to tell the bureaucracy.

29:10.840 --> 29:17.800
That's what's going to go all through this machine. And you're hearing that even the pharmaceutical

29:17.800 --> 29:23.240
companies and even these developers are calling Ralph for advice and consulting him.

29:24.120 --> 29:30.360
I doubt that he's taking all those calls for free, but there's where we are.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.960
If he is, he's taking those calls for free because they give him the prestige and the

29:35.960 --> 29:41.560
centrality and the control over the narrative that he's supposed to have. And it also puts him

29:41.560 --> 29:44.600
right at the focus of the Scooby-Doo, which is right where they want him to be.

29:44.600 --> 29:50.600
It's pretty fun stuff.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.480
Barrack's work saved countless lives and gave the world hope at a time it was desperately needed.

30:00.120 --> 30:05.480
Because of that, Barrack was given the OMAX Gardener Award, the highest honor for a faculty

30:05.480 --> 30:12.680
member in the UNC system. And when the pandemic happened, he and his team were able to move into

30:12.680 --> 30:20.440
action right away because they had this knowledge of these viruses. So not only could he understand

30:20.440 --> 30:27.320
the virus and work at the basic science level, but what Ralph does, it's really amazing,

30:27.880 --> 30:34.200
is that he also cares about applying that knowledge to developing vaccines,

30:34.200 --> 30:41.880
developing treatments, helping people avoid these diseases. He cares about individuals

30:41.880 --> 30:48.920
and populations, and that's what's really public health. And what he has done, he and his colleagues

30:48.920 --> 30:57.240
have done, will change the course of human history. Yeah, COVID-19, but that's funny.

30:57.240 --> 31:02.120
Infectious disease. Definitely gonna change the course of his actual questions here.

31:02.120 --> 31:07.800
Boy PBS works well with North Carolina, with the University of North Carolina, don't they,

31:07.800 --> 31:13.640
they work well from now. But we will be better prepared because of Dr. Barrack's work. You don't

31:14.360 --> 31:20.680
achieve these awards on your own, right? It's unfortunate enough to work with

31:21.480 --> 31:28.920
a large number of extraordinarily competent and proficient professionals who care deeply

31:28.920 --> 31:35.880
about human health and have dedicated a tremendous amount of their time and energy

31:38.200 --> 31:41.880
to not only build their credentials, but to make me look smarter than I really am.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.000
Quite frankly.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.760
Thanks y'all for watching this video, and if you want more where that came from.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.440
All right, let's keep going. This is awesome. I didn't realize they were going to be this good.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.800
Well, the last couple of years have been just incredibly intense. You have to understand, though,

31:59.800 --> 32:06.280
that this is what the Human Vaccine Institute is for. Our niche is to respond to the needs of

32:06.280 --> 32:11.240
society on problems that are not immediately attractive to the pharmaceutical industry,

32:11.240 --> 32:12.360
because they're so difficult.

32:14.920 --> 32:20.600
To really understand what researchers at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute are searching for,

32:22.360 --> 32:32.280
you have to go back to a 13th century legend. To this guy, King Arthur, who sent his

32:32.280 --> 32:38.760
nights of the roundtable on a quest for the Holy Grail. That term is now a metaphor for

32:38.760 --> 32:45.160
anything eagerly sought after. Uh oh. And after the COVID-19 pandemic

32:45.160 --> 32:50.520
had killed more than six million people in disrupted life across the entire planet,

32:51.080 --> 32:57.320
the Holy Grail for these scientists is creating a vaccine that protects against all kinds of

32:57.320 --> 33:03.720
coronaviruses. You know, we've had three epidemics now of coronaviruses. We had SARS,

33:04.360 --> 33:10.520
severe acute respiratory syndrome that occurred in 2003. We had Middle Eastern

33:10.520 --> 33:15.640
respiratory syndrome, MERS, that occurred in the Middle East, and then we have SARS-CoV-2 that

33:15.640 --> 33:21.560
arose from a bat virus in China. There's reason to expect there'll be another, and that candidate

33:21.560 --> 33:29.800
will be somewhere on the universe of coronaviruses. A vaccine that addresses a broad array of coronaviruses

33:29.800 --> 33:36.680
could stop a future pandemic. That type of vaccine is called a pan vaccine. I have a picture

33:36.680 --> 33:45.880
here of SARS-CoV-2. The receptors on those spikes are how the virus infects us. So the virus uses

33:45.880 --> 33:53.080
these red spikes on its surface to physically attach to cells of the respiratory system,

33:53.080 --> 34:00.600
either the upper respiratory system in our nose or down in our lungs and uses this molecule

34:00.600 --> 34:06.600
to infect our cells. But those receptors can also be targeted by antibodies and prevented from

34:06.600 --> 34:15.480
binding to human cells. So this is a model of an antibody. Vaccines teach our bodies to make

34:15.480 --> 34:21.800
antibodies, and those antibodies block viruses from attaching to the cells in our bodies

34:21.880 --> 34:28.680
and creating infections. Then I have here a model of this red molecule, the spike protein. So this

34:28.680 --> 34:37.560
is the spike protein that is present on all over a SARS-CoV-2 virus. Within the spike protein,

34:37.560 --> 34:43.880
there are pieces of it that bind to that host protein that it uses to infect ourselves. And

34:43.880 --> 34:52.440
that is called the receptor binding domain or RBD. This is the piece of the spike protein to which

34:52.440 --> 34:58.840
this antibody binds to prevent it from infecting. So by physically binding here, it blocks the

34:58.840 --> 35:09.160
infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The key to creating a pan vaccine is finding a common receptor

35:09.160 --> 35:18.120
between many types of coronaviruses that an antibody can bind onto. That's easy. We have a pathway

35:18.120 --> 35:22.840
forward for how we expect to make the universe of coronavirus vaccine. And so that's what the team

35:22.840 --> 35:28.040
here is working on. We have a path forward. So we're going to go forward. The two vaccine developed

35:28.040 --> 35:35.000
at Duke and now in clinical trials may point the way to creating a pan vaccine. Oh come on. This

35:35.000 --> 35:39.560
vaccine is constructed. So if you've ever looked at a soccer ball, you'll know that it has tiny hexagons

35:39.560 --> 35:43.720
that come together to make the larger sphere. So that's what's shown here. And to the sphere,

35:43.720 --> 35:49.480
we basically use it as a scaffold where we can take a small piece of a virus. There you go. This looks

35:49.480 --> 35:53.640
a lot like what they did in Seattle, except Seattle, I think was a little bit more of this

35:53.640 --> 35:59.720
spherical soccer ball. And that allows us a really potent way of being able to target that specific

35:59.800 --> 36:05.880
piece of the virus. Early studies show the vaccine generates a strong immune response to the virus

36:05.880 --> 36:10.760
that causes some kind of particle. So that's how the vaccine has been designed is to really

36:10.760 --> 36:16.840
activate the immune system to see a specific site. And in this animation, it shows a blue

36:16.840 --> 36:23.320
molecule that's the receptor Biden domain from SARS-CoV-2. And so that blue molecule gets a

36:23.320 --> 36:29.080
rate around the surface of the molecule, the scaffold, and it makes the overall nanoparticle.

36:30.680 --> 36:35.720
But what if you place pieces of other types of coronaviruses on that scaffold?

36:36.440 --> 36:41.400
So what we know right now is that with one receptor Biden domain, you can induce a broad

36:41.400 --> 36:45.560
neutralizing antibody response. So these are the antibodies that block infection.

36:45.560 --> 36:50.280
But that can only get you so far. So that covers a certain number of viruses.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.840
But to really go towards a universal coronavirus vaccine where you really are covering the majority

36:54.840 --> 36:59.640
of coronaviruses, we know that we're going to need more than just one. And so this technology

36:59.640 --> 37:04.760
is amenable to that, meaning that you can then take multiple pieces of viruses from multiple

37:04.760 --> 37:07.960
different coronaviruses and array it and show it to the immune system.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.600
That's totally one of the things that yours are scrambling to find.

37:15.480 --> 37:20.360
Which parts of those of the spike protein are similar among all these viruses?

37:21.480 --> 37:26.360
So I think with the- And so the important thing to understand here is that if you talk about

37:26.920 --> 37:33.000
there being potentially a universal epitope or epitopes that are common across coronaviruses

37:33.000 --> 37:38.760
and you talk about targeting those with an antibody, it doesn't mean either of those things

37:38.760 --> 37:45.000
are possible that you can target an epitope with an antibody reliably and then produce it and get

37:45.000 --> 37:53.880
it to work. And number two, it doesn't mean that you're going to be able to create the immunity to

37:53.880 --> 38:02.120
that target and have it be meaningful. This is a- This is something that again, it kind of frames

38:02.120 --> 38:07.320
the- I almost lost my train of thought there. It frames the spectrum of debate with certain

38:07.320 --> 38:13.000
assumptions that if you're not sophisticated enough to realize that these assumptions aren't

38:13.000 --> 38:17.800
good assumptions, then you go along with their little charade here about what's possible.

38:18.600 --> 38:26.600
And so they- they repeat the- the assumptions that if we make this particle with more things on it-

38:26.600 --> 38:28.360
But to really go towards a universal-

38:28.360 --> 38:30.200
That we'll just create a universal-

38:30.200 --> 38:37.160
We'll cover the majority of coronaviruses by adding other spike proteins or other

38:37.160 --> 38:41.560
proteins to the outside of it and this technology is a minimal to that.

38:41.560 --> 38:46.520
What you need to understand what he's saying is that he can fit grant applications.

38:47.800 --> 38:55.160
He knows that there are upcoming grant calls that are going to ask for vaccine candidates

38:55.160 --> 39:01.560
that can generate immunity to specific targets and show demonstrate correlates of immunity that

39:01.560 --> 39:08.440
are antibodies. Hello. They all know how to play the game of getting money from the-

39:08.440 --> 39:15.080
from the NIH for vaccines. It's about generating an antibody response in a robust one at that.

39:16.520 --> 39:23.240
And that's why they're all telling the same story. We were just here a minute ago. The first video was

39:23.240 --> 39:29.480
Robert- was Ralph Barrack singing at a passion coronavirus for coronaviruses since 1984. That's a

39:29.640 --> 39:35.240
little weird. Why? Because we knew nothing about them and because they had a unique way of replicating.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.960
Is that really why he started to work on them? Because they had a unique

39:40.680 --> 39:49.560
way of replicating, isn't that weirdly on theme for the the exo gene exon gene and the proof

39:49.560 --> 39:52.680
reading of coronaviruses debate that we're in right now.

39:52.680 --> 39:57.480
And he said on what in that video as well that he just told the story of antibodies as being

39:57.480 --> 40:03.560
the primary immunity to coronaviruses. Then we moved on to the Duke Vaccine Institute that

40:04.120 --> 40:08.840
clarified that the pandemic disrupted life across the planet. We've had three pandemics,

40:08.840 --> 40:13.560
therefore another pandemic is coming and they want to make a pan coronavirus vaccine.

40:13.560 --> 40:18.360
They then emphasized that antibodies are primary immunity just like Ralph Barrack's video did.

40:18.360 --> 40:23.480
And then they said they have a nano particle carrier candidate that can augment the immune

40:23.480 --> 40:30.360
system usefully to several different targets. Well, holy crap, that's pretty impressive.

40:34.120 --> 40:41.000
Holy grail researchers are scrambling to find which parts of those of the spike protein

40:41.000 --> 40:47.000
are similar among all these viruses. So I think with the upfront work that we're doing now to

40:47.000 --> 40:51.640
really put in place the technology for manufacturing, we'll be able to move this really quickly once

40:51.720 --> 40:55.240
we decide on what's the right mix of coronaviruses for us to target.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.160
Thanks y'all for watching this video. And if you want more where that came from,

41:03.160 --> 41:08.200
check out our channel, Cy and C. So I had to. I had to.

41:14.200 --> 41:20.520
The opportunity to take fundamental scientific advances. And so I had to stop that one there

41:20.520 --> 41:27.160
because I couldn't believe what I was hearing, but so which parts which parts of the spike

41:27.160 --> 41:31.400
are shared across coronaviruses is what that guy asked at the end of that video.

41:33.400 --> 41:42.520
So there are approximately 29 to 31 proteins encoded in the coronavirus genome. And then you

41:42.520 --> 41:53.160
can also argue because virology talks often about alternative reading frames in a viral genome that

41:53.160 --> 41:58.680
can encode for more variants of proteins. And so you could have even more proteins than 30 or so

41:59.480 --> 42:04.360
in a in a virus genome, depending on how those alternate reading frames are used.

42:05.080 --> 42:11.800
Now secondly, the spike protein is one of the more variable proteins in the coronavirus genome.

42:11.800 --> 42:18.360
And there are lots of other more highly conserved proteins in the genome. The E protein tends to be

42:18.360 --> 42:25.080
more conserved. The N protein tends to be more conserved in the and many of the small proteins

42:25.080 --> 42:33.880
in poly protein one A and one AB are also conserved. I'm not sure if it's one A and one B or if it's

42:33.880 --> 42:40.920
one A and one AB. I think it's one A and one B, but it doesn't matter. There's a large open reading

42:40.920 --> 42:45.240
frame that encodes for a poly protein that needs to be cut into several proteins, then reassemble

42:45.880 --> 42:51.480
into the replication transcription complex or one of them. And those are also very conserved

42:51.480 --> 42:57.800
proteins. So it's very interesting already in that that video from Duke, where they have already honed

42:57.800 --> 43:06.200
in on and decided that all the relevant epitopes are in the spike because primary immunity is

43:06.280 --> 43:12.040
antibodies to the spike. And so what we were talking about last night is actually really

43:12.040 --> 43:19.960
important because that's the bad model, right? Anybody's in your blood for a apparently respiratory

43:19.960 --> 43:29.480
and interior virus is just ridiculous. And all of these people should know this. And if they don't,

43:29.480 --> 43:36.040
it's just shows how incompetent this this Academy edition factory has become.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.920
So this is another Ralph Barrick video, but I think it's a little later or it's by it's not

43:42.920 --> 43:49.320
by PBS. Let's put it that way. The clinic and see it undergo a trial and then see that the data

43:49.320 --> 43:54.920
is spectacular. That's incredibly rewarding. And in 2020, it happened twice.

43:55.080 --> 44:02.680
Our group has participated in the testing and development of the Moderna vaccine.

44:03.400 --> 44:09.240
The other time was remdesivir. Nice. Which we had worked on since about 2014. Twice.

44:11.080 --> 44:17.400
About two to three years before the SARS-2 pandemic, we started testing mRNA-based vaccines

44:18.120 --> 44:24.120
against other coronaviruses about the time that date. I mean, I would go so far as to say that

44:24.200 --> 44:31.880
Ralph Barrick's work and contribution to the use of remdesivir during the coronavirus pandemic

44:31.880 --> 44:39.720
is something that he should he should answer for because he should have come out and so

44:39.720 --> 44:44.200
should have marked Dennis and should have come out and said there's no way that this drug is

44:44.200 --> 44:49.640
appropriate for humans. And it's certainly not appropriate for humans that are already in the

44:49.720 --> 44:54.200
hospital because we already showed that. And both of those guys should have said something about

44:54.200 --> 44:58.760
it. And the fact that they didn't say anything about it means either they are on the take or

44:58.760 --> 45:04.840
they're on the the don't talk list like what I've listed back here behind the movie

45:06.200 --> 45:11.560
or they're they're actively participating in the worst case scenario because they they realize

45:11.560 --> 45:16.760
that it's a national security operation that whose goal is total compliance.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.960
I mean, mentioning remdesivir in multiple promotion videos and taking credit for it.

45:23.960 --> 45:30.520
I mean, that's that's that's as nasty as it gets because remdesivir is one of the things

45:30.520 --> 45:35.240
that's really helped to exacerbate the fear, uncertainty and doubt about what's going on in

45:35.240 --> 45:41.640
our hospitals and what's happening in our health care system. So you want to you want to call

45:41.640 --> 45:47.800
Barrick out for that? That's fine. But don't don't give me this he invented the no-seum technique.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.520
And that's the reason why we're here because that's ridiculous.

45:51.400 --> 45:57.160
Once the no-seum technique was published, once that somebody in virology said, hey, by the way,

45:57.160 --> 46:03.480
these these enzymes that recognize a sequence but cut somewhere else, these are really handy for

46:03.480 --> 46:10.200
making sticky ends and and litigating large pieces of DNA together and doing it usefully and making

46:10.200 --> 46:15.480
very big constructs. Oh, wow, cool. We wanted to do that in coronaviruses. We wanted to do that in

46:15.480 --> 46:18.760
all RNA viruses. We'll start using those enzymes. That's great. Thanks.

46:20.520 --> 46:25.880
And just like that, a technique becomes universal just like when somebody says, hey, you know,

46:25.880 --> 46:30.040
if you use powdered sugar in your angel food cake, you get a better result. Oh, wow, great. Cool. Thanks.

46:31.800 --> 46:35.480
You don't have to give credit to the French chef that came up with that idea.

46:35.480 --> 46:38.760
Oh, I learned that from the guy who learned that from the guy who learned that from the guy

46:38.760 --> 46:42.760
who learned that from that guy. And so it's his fault that we all make our cakes like this.

46:42.760 --> 46:50.200
That's ridiculous. This is a very simple insight into assembly of DNA. And it is the

46:50.200 --> 46:55.320
application of already long standing molecular biological techniques to make large quantities

46:55.320 --> 47:00.840
of it. And then it's already the application of large long standing techniques of converting

47:00.840 --> 47:08.760
that DNA to RNA. Just happens to be that this RNA is viral. And so apparently it does stuff.

47:08.840 --> 47:12.040
And it makes any codes for proteins that make stuff.

47:13.640 --> 47:19.160
And that's what RNA virology is all about. It's what that's what Ralph Berwick is covering up.

47:19.960 --> 47:28.200
And pretending is some kind of special magic potion book or or secret grimoire of recipes that only

47:28.200 --> 47:35.400
he has. But I guarantee you that Alison Totura took all those ideas and all those that knowledge

47:35.400 --> 47:43.800
with her to us amored when she went. And I guarantee you that when they wrote that paper in 2019

47:43.800 --> 47:50.520
Alison Totura and Cina Bavari when they wrote that paper, they were talking about the very

47:50.520 --> 47:56.760
techniques that Alison learned in Ralph Berwick's lab for reverse genetics that were first pioneered

47:56.760 --> 48:06.280
by people like David Baltimore. I was about to call him James Baltimore, David Baltimore.

48:09.720 --> 48:15.960
And so David Baltimore is the first guy who made a clone of RNA virus in DNA and then translated it

48:15.960 --> 48:20.920
RNA and it found out that it worked or did what they wanted it to do and made particles.

48:21.880 --> 48:28.200
Now you want to look at that in those experiments and decide if that's really what happened,

48:28.200 --> 48:35.880
go ahead and shoot and knock yourself out. But the point is is that Ralph Berwick didn't invent it.

48:37.160 --> 48:42.520
He's just one guy in a long list of dudes who's you know clever with molecular biology,

48:42.520 --> 48:48.120
but once it's out there, it's like bacon cakes. Once he figured out how to do it,

48:48.120 --> 48:53.160
yes, the DoD knew how to do it. And there were lots of other scientists in the DoD who are

48:53.160 --> 49:01.880
just as capable at the bench at mini-preps and and maxi-preps as as Ralph Berwick's grad students.

49:01.880 --> 49:02.600
I assure you.

49:02.600 --> 49:10.120
It was rolling out SARS-Coronavirus 2 emerge.

49:16.600 --> 49:22.760
We were charged very early on to develop animal models of human disease so that we could immediately

49:22.760 --> 49:29.960
test these vaccine candidates by April of 2020. We had to have all the data completed by the end

49:29.960 --> 49:34.920
of June of 2020 so it could be included in the FDA packets that went forward for approval,

49:34.920 --> 49:38.840
for phase three testing. So a lot of stress on people in the lab.

49:41.240 --> 49:47.080
We're going from a new virus that we received in late February to having all of that done

49:47.080 --> 49:51.720
by the end of June so that we could begin phase three testing with the Moderna.

49:51.720 --> 49:57.880
Late February, he says, they received the virus in late February as if he needed the virus to,

49:57.880 --> 50:00.600
you know, to make the synthetic clone.

50:04.920 --> 50:08.920
When was this the Hohomish County man? Was that February? Was he February?

50:08.920 --> 50:15.000
Is anybody out there? Talk to me, Goose. Was it February that that's the Hohomish County man?

50:15.000 --> 50:23.320
Was he January? Talk to me, Goose. Vaccine by August. It was non-stop here for for some of

50:23.320 --> 50:29.800
the coronavirus. I volunteered to be part of the trial. I figured if I was involved in the

50:29.800 --> 50:34.600
preclinical development, I should be one of the first ones to see how well it worked in humans

50:34.600 --> 50:39.000
and so I volunteered for the phase three trial and when they jabby in the arm with the vaccine,

50:39.000 --> 50:44.920
it was very real. I could assure you it was very real. There's a protein here called ACE2.

50:44.920 --> 50:51.240
It has spaces in it that this can stick into that and once that happens, boom.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.680
Virus goes inside the cell infection. That's the infection.

50:56.760 --> 51:01.800
This was a collaborative effort. There it is again. Other key players certainly were Moderna

51:01.800 --> 51:08.120
and researchers at the National Institute of Health. The unsung heroes are 15 people in my lab

51:08.120 --> 51:14.760
that work non-stop from February through December. So is this already a hint that they're going to

51:14.760 --> 51:19.320
throw Pfizer under the bus for process two but they're going to say that Moderna didn't cut that

51:19.400 --> 51:25.320
corner or what? I don't understand how that works. Did Moderna cut that corner or not? I don't

51:26.360 --> 51:36.520
understand. I don't remember what was the what Kevin McCurnan's data shows if there's DNA in both

51:36.520 --> 51:43.560
or not. The rapid response in terms of therapeutic antibodies, vaccines and drugs against COVID-19

51:43.560 --> 51:49.000
is sort of an unparalleled scientific achievement in biology and microbiology and medicine.

51:54.520 --> 51:59.080
That entire infrastructure of collaboration and interaction. I think he could have taken it

51:59.080 --> 52:06.520
interface paid off. It paid off for the American people. Having said that, we can do better.

52:06.520 --> 52:12.200
We learned that we need to reinvest in public health. We need to speak with a single voice

52:12.200 --> 52:19.720
in a pandemic. And we need to figure out how to deal with misinformation on social media,

52:19.720 --> 52:25.160
which we have not been able to deal with effectively. It's tough. We're strong. We have a new variant

52:26.120 --> 52:32.760
and the lab is gearing up to respond to that variant to understand its biology, its impact on

52:32.760 --> 52:39.480
therapeutics and vaccines and drugs, how best to counter it if some of the products that are on

52:39.560 --> 52:50.040
a shelf lose their potency. There's no time to celebrate. I mean, there's always another variant

52:50.040 --> 52:56.840
emerging. There's other other products that need to be tested. We just keep grinding on and on and

52:56.840 --> 53:02.520
on. Hey, you got to get up and make the donuts every day, baby. Investing into looking and studying

53:02.520 --> 53:08.920
that basic biology of life will result in modern miracles of medicine. Oh, here we go.

53:10.200 --> 53:15.800
The basic biology of life and the modern miracles of medicine. Okay, check this out. Check this out.

53:15.800 --> 53:24.520
This is the website that I'm on. It is a defense website. I'm going to put the linky link in the

53:24.520 --> 53:31.960
chatty chat because I want you to be able to download this. It's actually downloadable.

53:33.080 --> 53:38.760
So you can scroll down to the video here and you can actually just click download and download it.

53:38.760 --> 53:43.640
And so I already did that. And so I'm not going to use my bandwidth to show you the video. I'm

53:43.640 --> 53:48.920
just going to show it to you back here. Okay. And this is a video that took place on March 5th,

53:49.000 --> 53:58.200
2020. And I can't stress enough. The people are like these guys are like James Giordano. They're

53:58.200 --> 54:03.400
going to throw a lot of lingo at us, but I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to try and

54:03.960 --> 54:09.240
keep up with my notes. And I think you're going to find it quite shocking. I want to give

54:09.240 --> 54:18.040
Sorry, I want to give a shout out to

54:27.080 --> 54:29.480
I want to give a shout out to

54:29.480 --> 54:37.640
where is this sub stack democracy manifest sub stack.

54:39.960 --> 54:45.320
The writer or one of the writers of that sub stack gave me a heads up on this video and I

54:45.320 --> 54:49.160
thought it was just so cool. The first five minutes of it I wanted to watch with you tonight. So

54:49.160 --> 54:54.280
here we are. Hopefully this will go rather quickly and I won't have to interrupt too much, but it's

54:54.280 --> 55:02.120
pretty shocking. Remember, this is March 2nd or March 5th. It's March 5th and it's the Pentagon

55:02.120 --> 55:07.080
and it's a real DoD video. It's the first one on their little private site.

55:10.680 --> 55:19.240
No masks. March 5th. Warp speed and the development of vaccines.

55:19.240 --> 55:25.480
Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for coming to our press briefing on the army support

55:25.480 --> 55:30.440
to vaccine development. My name is Colonel Kathy Turner. I'm the director of the Army

55:30.440 --> 55:35.720
Media Relations Division and I will moderate today's session. The following senior leaders

55:35.720 --> 55:41.000
will be on our on today's panel. We have Brigadier General Mike Talley, commanding general of

55:41.000 --> 55:46.600
U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command and Fort Detrick. We have Colonel Wendy

55:46.600 --> 55:51.480
Sammons Jackson, director of military infectious disease research program,

55:51.480 --> 55:57.400
U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. We have Dr. Nelson Michael, director of the

55:57.400 --> 56:03.320
Center for Infectious Disease Research, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and we have Dr.

56:03.320 --> 56:10.440
Kavan Majerad, director of emerging infectious diseases, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

56:10.440 --> 56:15.320
Today's discussion is on the record. After Brigadier General Talley's opening remarks,

56:15.400 --> 56:20.680
I ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up until we have gotten around

56:20.680 --> 56:25.800
the room and then we'll continue to field questions until we're at a time. We have about 30 minutes

56:25.800 --> 56:32.200
today and with that I'll turn it over to you, sir. Okay. Hey, good afternoon and thank you for

56:32.200 --> 56:38.360
participating in today's briefing. Our hearts go out to those that are affected or know someone

56:38.360 --> 56:45.080
who's affected by this disease. You know, emerging to infectious diseases like this coronavirus

56:45.080 --> 56:51.080
that we're facing now are COVID-19 or why a global network of military infectious disease

56:51.080 --> 56:57.640
surveillance laboratories exist around the world. Military medical research is a force multiplier

56:57.640 --> 57:02.760
designed to support the service member and the public in every conceivable circumstance.

57:03.480 --> 57:09.000
Through both emerging science and technological advances, the United States Army Medical Research

57:09.000 --> 57:13.240
and Development Command is on the forefront of delivering medical capabilities faster

57:13.720 --> 57:19.320
and more efficiently than ever before. We are supporting a whole-of-government approach

57:19.320 --> 57:25.480
to detect, prevent, and treat COVID-19 and when it comes to infectious disease threats,

57:25.480 --> 57:29.560
we have extensive capabilities and an international research infrastructure

57:30.200 --> 57:34.760
already in place that allows our scientists to anticipate and develop countermeasures

57:34.760 --> 57:40.920
against emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 infrastructure development command is on the

57:40.920 --> 57:45.960
forefront of delivering medical capabilities faster and more efficiently than ever before.

57:46.920 --> 57:52.760
We are supporting a whole-of-government approach to detect, prevent, and treat COVID-19

57:53.480 --> 57:58.920
and when it comes to infectious disease threats, we have extensive capabilities and an international

57:58.920 --> 58:04.040
research infrastructure already in place that allows our scientists to anticipate

58:04.040 --> 58:09.400
and develop countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases. Okay, so I hear a global

58:09.400 --> 58:16.040
network of surveillance laboratories already in place. I hear global extensive capability of

58:16.040 --> 58:23.880
existing research infrastructure and I hear him advocating for a whole government approach to

58:23.880 --> 58:29.560
responding to the coronavirus. Let's make sure I got that about right. Wow. The United States Army

58:29.560 --> 58:34.200
Medical Research and Development Command is on the forefront of delivering medical capabilities

58:34.200 --> 58:40.840
faster and more efficiently than ever before. We are supporting a whole-of-government approach

58:40.840 --> 58:47.000
to detect, prevent, and treat COVID-19 and when it comes to infectious disease threats,

58:47.000 --> 58:51.080
we have extensive capabilities and an international research infrastructure

58:51.720 --> 58:56.280
already in place that allows our scientists to anticipate and develop countermeasures

58:56.280 --> 59:04.040
against emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 is the infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus

59:04.520 --> 59:10.280
and this is familiar territory for our team. Our labs have previously studied SARS and MERS,

59:11.080 --> 59:16.600
both of which are coronaviruses. They're in that same family. Our researchers and scientists at

59:16.600 --> 59:23.000
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research conducted the first in-human phase one trials of the MERS

59:23.000 --> 59:30.440
vaccine and that's the only MERS countermeasure and the only and only the third coronavirus vaccine

59:30.440 --> 59:37.320
ever tested in humans. We're building upon the science for COVID-19 solutions as we speak right

59:37.320 --> 59:45.160
now. Just this week we were able to develop new versions of COVID-19 candidate, one of the first

59:45.160 --> 59:50.520
candidates that we've tried, and we initiated research to determine if there is a response to

59:50.520 --> 59:56.520
the vaccine. Again, this is just one piece of the solution. There's other vaccine candidates

59:56.520 --> 01:00:02.120
being developed by other organizations, but we're all working toward a solution and we want to

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.520
get it done as quickly as possible and we're doing this in a whole of government fashion

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:13.160
and certainly a whole of DOD fashion. In addition to vaccine prevention, we are also exploring

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.920
treatments. Efforts are ongoing right now to identify new drug candidates to respond to the

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.320
COVID-19 infection. A cooperative research and development agreement with an industry partner

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.520
is under review for the DOD to gain access to an antiviral drug for treatment use

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.120
in our medical centers, our military treatment facilities. So together with our United States

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:42.840
government partners, we are progressing at very fast rates, revolutionary rates almost,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:49.320
constant effort, and this is in order to deliver effective treatment and prevention products.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.240
Products that will protect the citizens of the world and preserve the readiness

01:00:53.320 --> 01:01:00.600
and lethality of our DOD's service members. I want to thank you in advance, but I'd also like to

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:09.800
tell you a little bit about my teammates here. So Colonel Dr. Wendy Sammons-Jackson is the director

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.040
for our military infectious disease portfolio. She dual hats as the joint program committee

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:23.080
director for the entire DOD. So when you're looking at the capabilities and capacity within

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.920
the medical research and development command, the demand signal is coming from all over the

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:35.960
joint forces. She's managed that portfolio for the last two years, and when you talk about some

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:44.520
of the most recent accomplishments with MERS, with Zika, she has been involved in all those things.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:54.680
Dr. Nelson-Michael, about 37 years of experience. Same thing. We talk about some of our latest

01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:01.320
successes with MERS. Both he and Dr. Kavan Mujarit have been right at the forefront,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.920
and even with Zika, I'm very proud to say that within nine months, this is the team that was able

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:20.360
to start the first inhuman clinical trials. And just last December of 19, the MERS CO-V

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:28.840
correction, the Ebola-Zaire version vaccine was given full FDA approval. These two gentlemen were

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:38.600
played a big part of that. Dr. Kavan Martin, again, having been the scientist behind a patented

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:46.520
adjuvant that's designed for this same family of diseases, it's an adjuvant that's being used

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.920
right now, being shared with our whole of government partners. He just recently returned from

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.520
Switzerland. We were lucky enough to be able to recruit him from the World Health Organization,

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.560
he's been back for about a week from Switzerland. So when you look at certainly the scientists that

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:12.520
that we recruit and train within the DOD, they are well integrated with some of the top scientists

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.080
in the country. And so we're very proud to take part in this effort, and we look forward to your

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:25.400
questions. That is hysterical. I love the help of the Associated Press. They got somebody to come

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:34.760
from the World Health Organization. So they had their own candidate of vaccine. Is that what

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.760
you understood too? Because I couldn't tell whether he was hinting that the DOD was working with NIH,

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.880
or whether the DOD had their own vaccine that was in competition with the NIH vaccine versions.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.240
He established that SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID, and he started this by apologizing and

01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:02.280
expressing condolences for anybody that suffered from this disease. They were supporting a new drug

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:10.520
search. And the team that ran the Zika trials is this same team. And these guys were also involved

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.120
in the Ebola vaccine. And then the last person is somebody that they got from the who. Wow, this is

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.840
just, this is just, this is just, I mean, wow, a proprietary adjuvant also. So handy. What a great,

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:29.880
what a great team. However, this most applies. Just on the vaccine. Can you talk a little bit,

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:35.560
just more detail about the vaccine, your work that's being worked on. Is it different than

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:43.240
NIH's approach and how soon are you to for like a phase one trial? And then I'll just

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:51.160
throw the follow up out just in case that's easier. The rapid diagnostic that is being worked on,

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.040
can you talk a little bit about that and how sort of where you are in the rapid diagnostic

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:02.280
tool and how soon that might also be available for testing?

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.080
Yes, ma'am. Let me just take the first two questions quickly and give you over to Dr.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.600
Majard who can talk about some more granular aspects of this vaccine. First thing,

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:20.200
it's one I want you all to know is that we have been around the Walter Reed Armada Institute of

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:25.800
Research for 127 years. I mean, we are, a lot of people like to ask, well, why is the army

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.800
involved in vaccine development? We've been doing this for an extremely long period of time. Walter

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.600
Reed, I've obviously made his notoriety on figuring out countermeasures to yellow fever. So we've

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.240
been doing this for an extremely long time. It's one, two is that we work very closely in the

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:45.080
interagency space. The, my first raider in the army, I recently retired as Bob Redfield as a

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.640
CDC director. My second raider is Debbie Burks. Now, obviously, the global AIDS coordinator and

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.320
running the COVID response under the vice president and Dr. Fauci is close enough to him that he

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:01.080
retired me about 18 months ago. So we work very, very closely in the interagency space in the

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:07.560
vaccine that I'll let Dr. Majard talk about. We worked with Dr. Fauci's team to find a space

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:13.800
where we could find a vaccine candidate that was scientifically not duplicative but mutually

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:19.640
supportive of what others were doing, but also made sense. And so we ended up moving on two

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:26.600
different vaccine platforms in coordination with Dr. Fauci and his team. Let me let Dr. Majard

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.200
tell you a little bit more about that and what our rough timelines could be. Thanks for your

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:38.600
question, Dr. Fauci and his team. His name is Dr. Nelson Michael and he's the director of the

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:45.720
Center of Infectious Disease Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Dr. Nelson Michael.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.680
Let me let Dr. Majard tell you a little bit more about that and what our rough timelines

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:59.800
could be. Thanks for your question. So from the first day that the sequences of the new virus

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:12.680
were published, this guy is Dr. Kavran, Kavan, Maad Majarad, M-O-D-J-A-R-R-A-D.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:19.240
And I think this is the dude that they got from the World Health Organization. He looks like a

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:25.720
very dark version of beaker from the Muppets. We were working on this vaccine and we were doing

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:32.600
so in coordination with our interagency partners at the NIH, specifically the vaccine research

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.360
center where the president was visiting just a couple of days ago and which is the place that I

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:44.280
came from where I trained under Dr. John Mascol and Dr. Barney Graham there and have been in constant

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:50.200
communication very much like we did for the Zika vaccine where the NIH and Walter Reed Army Institute

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:58.280
of Research had two complementary approaches towards a vaccine candidate for Zika. Here again,

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:05.480
we're taking a platform that actually has been used in clinical trials so far for influenza or

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:14.840
different respiratory virus and focusing on a component of the virus that a lot of groups are

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:21.160
working on but with a unique platform and a unique what's called adjuvant which is a

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:29.800
chemical that is used in combination with vaccines all the time to enhance their immune response

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:38.360
and that adjuvant is actually patented by the Army. So we see this as a unique and complementary

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:44.840
approach that is non duplicative that is being coordinated as part of the whole of government

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.040
response. It's such a weird it's such a weird thing to say it's non duplicative when he started

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.480
four or five sentences earlier saying that we're going to make a vaccine using basically the same

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:01.080
viral component that everybody else is focusing on listen carefully. So it's totally duplicative

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:08.280
especially when you realize there are 30 proteins in the or 31 or 45 depending on what reading

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:14.600
frames are read with a unique platform and a unique what's called adjuvant which is a

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:22.600
a chemical that is used in combination with vaccines all the time to enhance their immune

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:29.480
response and that's not right it's not used in combinations in combination with a vaccine

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:36.600
it is a component of almost every vaccine the adjuvant is the chemical that irritates the

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:45.720
immune system and gets it activated to do something and the big joke among amongst adjuvant chemists

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:51.880
is the toxicity and that more toxic it is the more adjuvant it is the better adjuvant it is

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.040
it's a joke amongst them. Ladies and gentlemen this is already in fifth of December somebody

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:05.880
misleading very important people or misrepresenting the immune system because they don't understand

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:12.600
it in either way screwing a lot of people over starting on March 5th 2020 by emphasizing antibodies

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.800
and saying that adjuvants are something other than separate from a vaccine are you kidding me

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.800
are you kidding me?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:33.160
Under Dr. John Mascol and Dr. Barney Graham there and have been in constant communication

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.440
very much like we did for the Zika vaccine where the NIH and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:46.760
had two complementary approaches towards a vaccine candidate for Zika. Here again we're taking a

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:54.280
platform that actually has been used in clinical trials so far for influenza a different respiratory

01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:03.640
virus and focusing on a component of the virus that a lot of groups are working on but with a

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:13.000
unique platform and a unique what's called adjuvant which is a chemical that is used in

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.240
combination with vaccine. So the army had their own thing and the army was going to do an adjuvanted

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.720
vaccine that's what you're hearing right here. It means all the time to enhance their immune

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.960
response and that adjuvant is actually patented by the army so we see this as a unique and

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:38.840
complementary approach that is non-duplicative that is being coordinated as part of the whole

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.120
of government response. I know you asked a question about the point of care testing.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.600
Unfortunately I think we have the world's leading expert in infectious disease diagnostics. This

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:56.600
happens to be in the army at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Dr. Sheila Peel. Sheila

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.840
like me really isn't has been working on HIV almost her whole professional career and there isn't a

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:09.880
what did I say yesterday every one of these people cut their teeth in the HIV industry in the HIV

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:21.480
space every one of them. It is absolutely extraordinary. It's just absolutely extraordinary. Single HIV

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.800
rapid test that's out in the market that hasn't at some level passed through her hands so

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.960
she's really our lead for looking at the diagnostics that are currently being used a test that would

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.760
allow us to understand whether someone's infected or has been exposed and I can tell you that for

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:42.840
now most of those tests are based on detecting the virus itself so developing the kind of test

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.520
like a pregnancy test that you might be familiar with is requiring a different kind of technology.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:54.360
Sheila's is already having those kinds of discussions. I think what you're going to probably see is

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.440
much more sophisticated and higher throughput tests that initially would be done in more

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.560
sophisticated laboratories and then as time goes on that technology will then roll out

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.560
to establish platforms to allow these tests to be moved more at the point of care.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:16.120
And so what he's describing there are the dissemination of EUA approved testing platforms,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.480
testing supply companies all this stuff needed to happen behind the scenes.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.760
It's not just like you know my wife and I if we would have gotten it in our heads we could have

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.080
started doing a PCR testing company in 2020 and be millionaires now.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.400
Would you have thought to do that? How many of your friends thought to do that?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.280
And yet somehow or another all around the United States there were these private companies that

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:49.080
sprung up out of nowhere and had had the wherewithal to set up a pretty complex molecular biological

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.760
testing laboratory without any know-how about how to do it. And they were able to source all their

01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.760
materials and all the necessary supplies that they needed to do it and then they got contracts

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.880
from state and local governments to do it. It's really extraordinary when you think about how

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.240
quickly it all came out even if they pretended like it wasn't very good and we were really behind

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.560
and we should have had testing in February and we didn't.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.800
We had testing in February we'd have been testing with the the PCR test that had the

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.960
primers that curled up on themselves like Kevin McCurnan was fighting against.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:33.240
Not that we shouldn't test with a PCR test he wouldn't fight against that because Kevin McCurnan

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.400
after working on the Human Genome Project started a company called Agencourt

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.240
who's one of its primary things was was HIV testing.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.680
So he definitely wouldn't say you can't use PCR to test for a virus. He's he's been using PCR

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:56.680
to test for viruses since he was like 30 years old and he started a company with his dad and his brothers.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.400
And so here we are talking about the diagnostic tests coming out and the how long is it going to

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.200
take for the development of the diagnostics and on the 5th of March they already know that they

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.160
need a vaccine. They already know they need a vaccine for the world they're already bragging

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:23.240
about the global research and surveillance infrastructure that was already in place.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.760
Some pretty bold claims already in this first 20 minutes.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:37.000
I mean do you have a sense on when when you'll have it just ready to roll out do you have a sense of

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.040
any timing on that and you have a sense on whether the vaccine when that would be have you

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.600
started testing in animals or have you the phase one time trial. Dibs timing.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:52.440
So so as far as the diagnostics are concerned there are large and very competent commercial

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:58.200
concerns that are looking literally in the next month or two to be able to take to convert the

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:04.520
current assays that are really relatively slow to execute and can you only do a small number of

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.880
samples at a time to being able to do these on very robust machines that could execute up to

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.640
800 tests for eight hours which is a standard work shift. So those are the kinds of approaches

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:21.480
that the the industry has already done. I mean I mean we do HIV testing we do almost a million

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:27.320
HIV tests a year at our laboratory up in Silver Spring and we use those kinds of instruments so

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:33.400
they can be adapted for those kinds of other technologies. Let me let Dr. Majora talk about

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:40.040
the point is though is if you're going to adapt a high throughput sequencing or PCR

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:47.720
machine to doing high throughput PCR testing for sea for coronavirus with only one or two

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:56.200
amplicons it's a very different setup in a 384 well plate than it is if that 384 well plate is

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:03.880
supposed to take all the same DNA and all 3348 wells versus it's supposed to have different DNA

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:11.000
and each one of those wells are every two wells and so converting these commercial platforms to

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.000
being able to use to go from essentially those commercial platforms existed before the pandemic

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.240
specifically to do genome screens for like you know a bunch of genetic markers that we're going

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.400
to talk about tomorrow when we watch an Eric Lander video that was inspired by

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:35.640
Mark Coolack's work today what a great show he did and it I was like 30 seconds away from watching

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:41.400
an Eric Lander video from 2019 when I decided at the last minute to switch to this because I'm

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.840
trying to keep all the people that are monitoring my my text messages and emails on their toes

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.720
but tomorrow we're going to do the Eric Lander video and it's going to be just spectacular it's

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:59.720
just great what he he continues to be so honest it's just really cool so let's keep this going

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.360
sorry about that the where we are in terms of stages of development pre-clinically then into

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:10.600
the clinic for a vaccine so if we think about vaccine development at different stages the first

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:16.280
stage is the design and the discovery to decide what is going to be your candidate we've completed

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:22.840
that and we have gone into small animals mice so we're looking at what the

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:30.280
response is to that vaccine in mice and then as far as a timeline to getting into humans I

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.800
wouldn't want to speculate too much on that I think the important thing to consider also is that

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:44.440
going beyond a phase one study there's the second phase which is oftentimes looking at a larger

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.880
population at the safety and the immune response but also then transitioning to see if it's

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:57.400
effective in populations what I think the field is trying to do is position itself as a whole

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:04.360
so that if there's a second wave during the next season in the winter that those candidates have

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:12.440
made it through phase one studies to be ready to look at the effectiveness during the next now

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.880
that's pretty curious because I know that my friend Mark Koolack has often suggested that

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:25.400
the original plan for covid was two years before the vaccine rollout not one and that for some

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:31.880
reason or another it was accelerated a bit and here he's he seems to be even downplaying the

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.680
possibility of a second wave is even maybe not going to happen which is very different than

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.880
than what a lot of other worst-case scenario people at the time were saying so that's cool season

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.720
okay so let's go to Caitlin and we'll come over to Tara Caitlin it's a question slash request

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:56.040
with describing like the vaccine can you be a little bit more broken down in terms of language

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.560
about what you're talking about because you're talking about candidates which what does that mean

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:05.400
what does it mean for a vaccine it's March 5th March 5th 2020 so that we can communicate best

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.080
about what you're kind of really talking about yeah thank you so think of this as the virus my

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:17.320
fist you know it's a sphere right and it's got little spokes coming off of it that makes it

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.280
the corona when you look at it on cross-section it's got that crown look to it

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.840
so almost all the vaccine candidates out there are focused on that little spoke what we call the

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:37.000
spike the spike protein and there are different parts of the spike that mediate the attachment

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.240
of the virus and the entry of the virus into our cells in our lungs so if you block that

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:48.360
attachment if you give a vaccine that trains and educates your immune response your immune

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:54.920
system to recognize that part of the virus that attaches to your cells and blocks it

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.840
that's going to be a good vaccine so that's why everybody's focused on that so we are looking

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.640
and then so what's a candidate then candidate means that you're looking at options you got

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.560
your different options that's your different candidates and you look in mice or other animals

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.960
other people are looking at other animals as well as as our scientists are doing

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:25.560
within our command to see which of those options looks best in small animals and then

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:33.560
larger animals before you go into humans as far as a platform so you have that little piece of the

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:39.720
virus that is going to be the part that educates your immune response but you need to deliver it

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:44.760
in something to the body you need to get it expressed in your body and there are different ways

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:52.520
to do that you can have it on a nanoparticle basically something another sphere that kind of

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:59.560
looks like the virus you can have it in DNA which is part of you know the same kind of DNA but it

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:05.480
goes into our body and our cells express that the Moderna vaccine that you've probably heard about

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:12.440
in collaboration with the NIH it's mRNA it's a different kind of thing like DNA that's the platform

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.640
parts the part that expresses that candidates that we're trying to find out how good it is in

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:26.360
this so curiously he's already selling it as not a genetic therapy it's not transfection

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:34.200
it's expressing a protein so we already have words for that if you use DNA it's called

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:40.760
transformation if you use RNA it's called transfection we already have names for that

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.640
and yet he says that a small piece of the virus needs delivering then he says it needs expressing

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.240
but he doesn't specifically say what expressing is and that is really changing

01:22:54.200 --> 01:23:00.520
a genetic signal into a protein and the genetic signal if it's DNA that change is

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:08.760
that that operation that methodology to use DNA to create expression of a protein that is called

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:19.640
transformation and that's usually associated with viruses like AAB because AAB will often

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.600
carry DNA and then transfection

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:34.920
is with RNA and so that is less associated with with a virus particle and it's much much more

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:48.520
associated with lipids or electricity and electroporation of course was the way that RNA and DNA was

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:57.240
going to get inside a cell for a company called Inovial which was incorporated and took a lot of

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:03.960
advice from or maybe even was was somehow owned by or whatever by Robert Malone Robert Malone

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:09.880
participated in that that was his big thing was electroporation and the reason why he gave up on

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:17.000
this RNA as a virus as a vaccine was because he knew that it couldn't be made safe

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.320
and that's why he gave up on it and let it go and then years later he tells us that he assumed

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.680
that they made it safe that's why he decided to take it it's a very strange

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:34.840
set of almost contradicting ideas that he claims to hold in his head about RNA and its safety

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.800
now versus when or his his own perception of its safety back then versus

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.120
at the start of the pandemic when he claims to have taken it different animals

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.880
hope that helps thank you for asking that question Kate we are going to go to Tara and then we'll

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.040
head back over to Phil I'll say thank you too it's about to ask something kind of related but

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:04.120
tied to that could you talk a little bit about what your scientists are actually doing in the labs

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.440
are they working with test tubes are they did they actually get samples of coronavirus from

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:19.160
someone who was infected how did they do this happy to so so our scientists are doing a number

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.880
of things right now there comes there has been receipt of the virus in one of our

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:30.360
laboratories and they're currently culturing growing that virus so that we can have stocks

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:37.240
available for a number of things to test products with that's they're also doing characterization

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.000
of the virus to try to understand learn more of what we know about the virus and how the virus

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:50.120
impacts are the host and our immune response to that virus the scientists and our other

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:56.600
subordinate laboratories are yes test tubes pipettes they're dealing with mice they're they're

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.880
running cell cultures and and I can let the scientists here they're doing the hands-on work

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:08.200
talk a little bit about that one description and the laboratory that received the samples

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:13.560
that Colonel Sam and Jackson is talking about is the US Army Medical Research Institute of

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.080
Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick but if you think of the movie outbreak and the suits that

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:24.520
they wore and a highly contagious environment without all of the drama of the movie certainly

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.840
but that capability certainly exists within military medicine and that particular laboratory

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:39.960
is the DOD's only biosafety level four laboratory so that type of work and we're not there yet with

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:46.200
coronavirus where we would actually bring it into containment facilities or laboratory suites to

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.360
test it at higher levels we mentioned small animals that would be an advancement to a larger

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.240
specimen perhaps not there yet but that's what the laboratory work looks like and I think we're

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:06.360
actually conducting that to some degree now in BSL three conditions biosafety level two conditions

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:12.280
but that's to get a picture of what that looks like at low-scale levels in vitro under microscopes

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:18.280
to all the way to where we would actually begin advanced types of testing there that's where

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.960
that's where we're skating through if you will so MRDC is for medical research development

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.400
command is really fortunate because we have a very unique national asset as the general mentioned

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:37.880
in our institute for biosafety level three which is current virus is required to be handled within

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.080
as well as biosafety level four and so those scientists the critical asset and those scientists

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:50.200
are actively working we have biosafety level level crimson and we also actually have some

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:57.240
facilities with biosafety level purple so you can rest assured that that whatever we do in this

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.760
laboratory nothing could possibly go wrong it's almost comical how they talk about it when you look

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:11.000
back on it you can't help but see it it almost like they have it's almost like they want you to think

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:19.960
that to investigate the virus as well in addition we also have the Walter Reed Army Institute of

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.840
Research with our two scientists here over here who are working in biosafety level two

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.120
and doing the discovery the small animal work and have some of the most brilliant minds in the

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:40.120
world working in infectious disease research and so within that we have a very robust science and

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:49.000
technology platform in addition we also have the capabilities to take products from the science

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:57.240
from from the prototype level and move them into advanced development which is required in order

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:04.600
for us to move them into manufacturing and commercialization so within MRDC as a whole we have sort of

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:10.200
entire pipeline for developing products and just super quick follow-up where did the sample come

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:16.680
from uh the coronavirus sample you're working on the CDC okay but it's no that would be so

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:22.360
very identified of where the infection was was it from China you know did it come from China or

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:30.600
it came from a U.S. patient yeah but we yeah we yeah yeah it's a homeless county man baby so let's

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.360
someone get some more questions so just to clarify really quick on the rapid diagnostic

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.480
that Lita asked about what what first of all you said if I was clear you said it'd be about

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.760
a month or two months before you think such a diagnostic would exist you know I was saying that

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:52.840
that that industry right now is taking their very robust platforms they have been using for a

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.680
long time to do high throughput screening for other infectious diseases and are adapting those

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:05.080
for testing for the for the SARS coronavirus too the point of care tests if they're going to be

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.840
actually detecting the virus itself that becomes I mean that's a lot trickier to actually take that

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:15.880
that kind of technology and then make it really small so I will tell you that we ourselves

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:22.680
are not involved directly in those efforts we're becoming aware of those that are because historically

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:32.120
we've made so many kinds of research projects along with industry to advance point of care

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.720
tests largely for infections like HIV because we're heavily involved in the presence of emergency

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:43.160
plan for AIDS relief which obviously the you know the point of care there are places that are

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.200
resource constrained in Africa largely and so you really need those kinds of robust tests that

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:54.040
require very very little skill I could probably teach my cat to one to use one that's the sort

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.440
of test you want to be able to use in the field and the same mindset we use is in the in the

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:04.280
military to be able to have those in rucksacks right so those that technology I don't want to

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:11.960
it really feels like the same kind of kind of bullshit pitch that David Hone gave in that talk

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:19.640
that Mark Koolak has featured on his program a few times where he says that well what I wanted

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:26.520
was the cart from Cuba Gooding Jr. in the movie and then his boss said no I want an arm band on

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:31.560
one arm that detects the pathogen and an arm band on the other arm that makes the vaccine and so

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:38.920
he's talking about carrying point of point of care tests in a backpack and all this other stuff so

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:46.840
again just like the last discussion that we were talking about with Duke University and the person

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:53.160
talking about how their their vaccine platform would be able to be universalized by adding more

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.600
antibody targets to the outside of their platform and was talking hypothetically about how useful

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:06.680
their platform could be what they're thinking is how they get grant money they're saying if their

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:11.560
platform works like they imagine it will then you should give us money to develop it because the

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:18.840
end when this perfect platform is developed it will be able to be a universal vaccine here he is

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.280
again talking about you know little tiny tests that are really really accurate and when we get it

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:30.600
right this is what they will be there are so many hypothetical you know if it works it would be great

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:36.280
if we could have this if it works we greatly could have this and there they haven't managed

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:43.000
to get any of these things to actually work they only work in the in the theoretical version on

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:51.400
paper or in the future and what's crazy about Mark's video from today and the video that we will

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:57.160
watch tomorrow what it will reveal is that when they told us that they had sequenced the human genome

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:01.160
and that they spiked that football they hadn't come even anywhere near

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:10.200
even close into the same stadium or even playing the same sport as sequencing the whole genome and

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:18.520
funny thing is Eric Landers fine with admitting that and so they have so grossly overplayed their

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.960
hand with regards to trying to convince us how much fidelity of understanding they have with

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:30.040
so much of this complexity and they just don't have it and it's interesting because in the

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.320
military space because they have these very specific applications that they're shooting for

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:42.200
you know the superpower suits and the super soldiers and also their crap then the theoretical goal

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:51.160
is revealed in the cartoon and it's it's almost easier in some ways in the military sense to

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:59.320
understand if the if the DARPA grant says we want an armband on one side that detects RNA and the

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:05.160
armband on the other side to make a vaccine for the RNA that's a grant proposal that lots of

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.040
of spin-up technology companies could in theory write a grant to answer

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:17.000
and not only that but you could imagine how one might write a grant to answer that call

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.440
we have the you know the latest spandex and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna cooperate with

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:29.000
apple to get the sensory technology or whatever you can imagine that it's a little harder to imagine

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:36.360
the grant applications that come in when a grant call for a particular gene in relation to a particular

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:40.600
disease describes a animal model and they asks for a grant call

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:48.680
DARPA asks for grant calls like we want to have a point-of-care test that can be carried in a

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.720
backpack and used at all temperatures and doesn't require blood

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.600
DARPA has grants that say that we want a cart that will make a vaccine DARPA has a grant that

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.760
says this kind of stuff so when these guys are talking and when you hear academic scientists

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.680
talking about especially infectious disease and responding to them you can hear the grant calls

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:21.160
in their explanations because if it's explanations about about getting money for funding to respond

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.840
to infectious diseases you're almost always going to hear about antibodies and you're almost always

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.760
going to hear about vaccines it's extraordinary when you listen to them now a few years later

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.400
leave you the impression that that's going to be available anytime soon clearly what we're

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:43.960
focused on is the more complex laboratories so that we don't have state and local departments

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.120
of public health that are simply overwhelmed with individuals that want to get tested so you had

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.680
that so in those situations where the patients are coming to a central so they don't think it's

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:59.000
going to blow over in march 5th they just think that this is just starting there is a whole

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.560
industry of testing that is spinning up now that they expect to be relevant for the foreseeable

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:14.360
future notice this this is not panic this is just state and facts we're about to

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.840
you know roll out a new thing or two or a hundred well place they're having the high

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.720
throughput test makes sense if now you're talking about distributing people that want to go detect

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.200
in less dense populations that's where the rapid or point of care test will be important

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.400
so you know you preparing yourselves for the possibility that the military is going to have

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.880
to test military patients i mean it's large a very large community and when you think about

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.400
all the people around the world you know it's unlikely that the civilian capacity would

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.200
necessarily be there for one as fast as they need it absolutely what does that look like i mean

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.120
like right now my understanding is there's only a small number of kits that have been distributed

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.000
to a very specialized about a dozen or so labs so what does it what does that look like when you're

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.320
talking about getting ready for testing over a million people maybe potentially

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:06.920
in the u.s military so the goal and there's multiple approaches so the goal is just increased

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:13.720
capacity and as dr michael mentioned um one way to do that is to develop these high throughput

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.960
assays and place them in regional critically strategic regional areas so that we can so where

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:25.080
did all these private testing companies come from if the whole thing was a military coordinated

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.440
exercise or private testing companies all around the united states that we're up and operating

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:37.800
by april this is now march what are we talking about here did they just put one ads out in major

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.120
cities in the united states looking for managers for biotech labs

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:54.600
this is extraordinary increase the throughput of the diagnosis another approach as was mentioned

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.400
before with the point of care is actually reaching further out into the environment to

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:06.440
be able to test and rapidly as an initial screen for folks to kind of help understand what the

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:12.600
epidemiology is and so there's multiple approaches within the army across the dvd and in across the

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.880
u.s government as well certainly critical and all each one of those approaches is our industry

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:23.880
partners in this to be able to take a product and develop it and commercialize it so we are

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.320
working with a number of partners and providing the support within the laboratories to help

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.320
develop the escape okay so let's go to lucas and then we'll hit courtney and back and the

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.120
lucas tolinson fox news in your modeling how many u.s military service members do you think

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:47.240
are going to contract the quantifiers that that'd be speculative sir uh not uh i i don't think we

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.600
have done any estimates on that uh it would depend on the spread certainly uh the way it's

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:59.240
progressing now but uh right now unless uh well we uh we're i i think that's the general 100

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.720
percent right we we don't have any data um right now i didn't but where we're beginning to work

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.600
with partners that dr major can get a little bit more into that there are lots of people now that

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:15.160
have gotten pretty sophisticated by trying to model infectious disease outbreaks um you know

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.320
regrettably because one seems to come up you know every year or so we're getting very good at this

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:24.680
um the problem with with the models it's as only as good as as the data that you have that would

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:30.120
build into it right so i would just say that that that we're beginning so i would just say that if

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:38.120
they created a mass casualty event if they created a mass casualty event in new york city and then

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:44.040
extrapolated from that very bad model where the spread would be in a few months you could get a

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:51.960
pretty worst case scenario going in fact if you look at the slope that you see in the first four

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:58.120
weeks or three weeks of the major bomb-like event that jessica hockett has worked so hard at

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:03.880
characterizing you're going to see a slope that if it's projected into the future at that angle

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:11.320
we're talking about billions dead it's really extraordinary and of course that's exactly what

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:18.600
was done in those weeks while we were all told to stay at home and just shelter in place and watch

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:25.640
tv they showed us that curve they showed us that slope and they said holy crap i don't know what's

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:36.120
going on but this looks pretty and serious to set ourselves up with really good modeling groups

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.520
to be able to ask questions in areas of the world where it's the virus is already spreading

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.200
and we have good epidemiology data that would allow us to inform those models that's going to

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.720
give us some prediction but i can tell you during the Ebola outbreak i literally sat in a WHO meeting

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:56.840
and had one modeler talk about when the epidemic in liberia was going to peak and

01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.320
essentially i looked at the numbers i said you're basically saying that it's only going to peak

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.720
when every single human being in liberia is infected and he basically just shrugged so you

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:09.640
just need to be careful that these models sometimes can really look bombastic

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.760
and they're always good as the data that initially goes into them

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:19.320
one thing i can say is that the current assay which is a test i think the throughput is

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:25.960
around 60 patients every eight hours so when we're looking at volumes or what we are trying to

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:33.400
develop in the area of detection our goal is anywhere from 275 to 500 every eight hours

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.960
so if we can increase the throughput for this when you're talking about a large number

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.280
that would be affected take the military for example we're certainly developing things

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.280
in case that were to happen that goes for any any population okay so i want to go

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.760
i i would just add so i think general tally is correct in that

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:02.440
um any kind of numbers specific numbers you throw out there is speculative

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:12.120
however we have epidemiologists at our institute working with others modelers who do this all the

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:19.800
time in the defense threats reduction agency ditra who provide responses to the requests of all

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.600
the different geographic combatant commands and we have been working with them for the past few

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.040
weeks initially based on assumptions but now more importantly on real life data

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:37.640
so we're trying to refine those models better based on the data that we feed into them so this

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:42.760
is something that we're working on but i wouldn't speculate and give you a specific number

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.280
what is the earliest that a vaccine would be ready for a u.s military service member go

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:58.200
go go so again it depends on what you're talking about in terms of ready so as i said there's

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.360
we when we go into phase one clinical trials when that we have done in the past

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.920
we the volunteers who are involved in those trials are a mix of civilian and active duty

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.880
populations and then as you go further on there is in discussions with our partners

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.680
and our military treatment facilities the potential to have them involved in clinical trials

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:30.840
as far as licensure whether you're talking about emergency use authorization or full licensure

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:38.200
if you if you talk about vaccines in general i think dr fauci's remarks that he's

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.680
stated over and over again are really the the benchmark that we should use as the most accurate

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:50.760
as being the earliest earliest earliest probably 12 to 18 months to get something out to the

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.720
populations and that would be whether it be civilian or military population and just recognize that

01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.480
part of that hesitation i mean the science can go very quickly but so that's closer to Mark's

01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:08.520
original estimate right 12 to 18 months 18 months would have put us in the middle of 2021

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:17.320
or or late 2021 and that's so they got it out really fast you at first don't want to do harm

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:22.520
right and you know there's obviously there are you know vaccines can cause harm and they provide

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:28.680
benefit so that mixture is something you always have to look at and so so part of the hesitation

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.160
to say all we can get a vaccine quickly is you need to make sure that it's really safe if you

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.080
test the vaccine in a thousand people but one in ten thousand people is going to have something

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.480
terrible that happens until you get to those numbers you may end up doing mass vaccination

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.800
campaigns with a vaccine that could cause a significant amount of problems so you so that's

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:52.680
pretty funny because also we have video of of tony fauci saying that 12 years ago about an HIV

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:57.720
vaccine and and not rushing it out because you don't want to have it rushed out and then realize

01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:02.040
that thousands of people are going to get hurt by it that's what he's suggesting here too

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.120
and i think most of the people who are watching this show for a while now are pretty much come

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:11.560
to the conclusion that that's what's happened that everybody that we know that has taken a couple

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.920
of these shots is damaged in some way even if they just get sick all the time or their kids have

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:23.800
strep throat four or five times a school year or you're 22 and you have your third bout of of

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.640
pneumonia in the last two years this needs to be a constant reassessment of the risk

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:34.760
and the benefit um the other thing i would tell you and this is so a really good benchmark

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.160
we were the first people that tested the vaccine that eventually got licensed by

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:45.880
murk to to um for for Ebola okay that vaccine was first tested by the Walter Reed Army Institute

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.040
of Research and so that's a that's a great thing i heard that was a pretty nasty vaccine wow

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:58.440
five years later it was approved by they tested the vaccine on veterans then or they tested the

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:05.560
vaccine on on soldiers what the hell the u.s. FDA in the meantime a half a million souls were

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.440
vaccinated that largely in africa during especially during the outbreak in the democratic republic

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:16.200
of Congo so wow you know again that was a risk benefit assessment the the leadership in the drc

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:24.040
said okay we know it's not approved yet by european medicines or by the u.s. FDA but we have a

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.840
terrible outbreak of Ebola which is highly fatal and so decisions were made to use that under

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.840
emergency use authorizations and so you know there's always that kind of debate but just i think

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:40.120
that's a good benchmark i didn't know they could give an EUA to a vaccine and then roll it out in

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:51.160
another country that's wow he just said that they decided to roll it out with an EUA because you

01:46:51.160 --> 01:47:00.520
know i mean it was a real real emergency over there that's a pretty good way it's like i'm just

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.680
trying to think of a better way to roll out a bio weapon attack than that so our CDC approved

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:12.680
this vaccine for your country you better take it for vaccines let me also say that

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.480
we haven't really talked much about this we are beginning to make other countermeasures

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:23.160
one of those are monoclonal antibodies so antibodies are part of our immune response you

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.920
you know it's part of the way the body tries to push infections back but we can actually make

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:35.080
these in test tubes and these are becoming a much more common tool that are being used

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:39.480
especially in the fields of oncology but increasingly in infectious disease so instead of actually

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:45.080
waiting for a vaccine to be made giving you that vaccine and waiting the time it takes for it to

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.640
develop the immune response you can give with these kinds of reagents you can give almost

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:55.560
immediate protection so we're literally in the process now of beginning to take those he keeps

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:01.560
saying literally when he doesn't need to say it and i want to smack him first baby steps as well as

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.000
looking at at we talked about one drug the general talked about that one drug that's

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.560
currently being repurposed and has been looked at for Ebola and now is being looked at for

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.800
it's remdesivir baby there are other small molecules because remdesivir

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:20.120
talked about that one drug that's currently being repurposed that one drug that's currently

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:25.960
be repurposed that was used for Ebola is remdesivir so they're talking about remdesivir on March 5th

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:31.560
they're talking about point of care testing on March 5th they're talking about PCR testing

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:37.240
they're talking about lateral flow testing they're talking about seroprevalence testing and they're

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.080
talking about vaccine candidates on March 5th 2020 they already know they're going to need all

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:47.400
this stuff they're not sure there'll be a second wave next winter maybe and it's been looked at

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.760
for Ebola and now it's been looked at for for CoV-2 but there are other small molecules that could

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:59.720
be discovered and one capability that we have at our institute is every malaria drug that's

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.400
ever been discovered it's at some level gone through the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.520
but we have a really good drug discovery program and so we're looking for other kinds of drugs

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.360
that might be lead candidates in partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry that we could

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:22.680
bring those to bear so vaccines monoclonal antibodies and small molecules drugs that could be brought

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:31.080
to bear so we don't have one one theme in play I'm not I'm not so I'm noticing this that small

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:37.960
molecules are somehow being considered different than drugs and I wonder how or why they did that

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:44.120
I bet it has something to do with IP or it has something to do with regulatory structures and

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:51.560
trying to avoid the regulations of biologics or trying to avoid the regulations of certain kinds

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.760
of pharmaceuticals by calling them small molecules I'm I'm wondering

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:06.600
Hey we have actually a number of things in play and all these are being coordinated very closely

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:12.680
with our partners either in government or in academia or in industry so thank you sir I know

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.040
I want to try to get a little bit more questions out there so Courtney will go to you

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:22.280
I want to ask a couple of clarification so when you're saying that there's testing going on in

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:26.840
my my Dr. Majard you mean you're not saying that they're being injected with the coronavirus and

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:32.120
that right okay I just wanted to be sure of that just just injected with the vaccine candidates

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:40.520
those options they have to see how the immune response yeah to see how antibody responses look

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.920
they're not going to look at anything else they're looking for a robust antibody response that's it

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:48.520
to see how it responds to the vaccine not the virus okay good I just wanted to be sure

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:54.600
about that and then I was a little unclear Dr. Michael when you were talking about you were

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.320
talking about potentially rolling something out the next time that the next season which I would

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.240
assume would be fall winter or maybe it was you Dr. Majard forgive me yeah the next season but I

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.720
don't quite understand what that was okay so you know that's a really important question too um

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.680
was it was our third the third one was just about the production okay yeah I think you kind of answered

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:17.400
the other one so 50 those that'd be great so so this is a respiratory virus and they're they

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.280
always give us trouble you know during cold weather for obvious reasons we're all inside and you know

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:29.000
windows are closed etc so so we typically call that the influenza or the flu season our expectations

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.480
that this virus like every respiratory virus is going to be in less troublesome for us as the

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.760
weather warms up and that's going to be true across the globe but our experience and most of our

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.720
experience comes from influenza like which is sort of the you know the unfortunately the king of

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:50.040
respiratory virus but we know a lot about that and our experience there is that every flu season

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:55.000
equals you know when the weather gets cold again this is when these viruses tend to come back

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.040
so this is why it's really important to understand that a lot of what we're doing now is really

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:05.080
getting ourselves ready for what we're calling the second wave of this we hope that that doesn't

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:13.160
happen if you remember SARS SARS came and went very quickly and you know I really hope that

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:19.240
happens again but we we can't count on that we have to be ready is that that even if this

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:24.760
epidemic begins to wane we have to be ready for the worst case scenario we have to be ready for

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.720
next next winter when it may come back again I'm sorry I'm still don't understand what it was

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:34.200
that you were hoping to roll out with the next wave so so we're saying that as we begin to develop

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:41.480
any of these countermeasures we're talking about monoclonal antibodies drugs vaccines that even

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:47.000
if this disease abates over the next few months we're pretty concerned that it will come back and

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.240
it may come back you know again in the next flu season if that's the case then in the meantime

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.960
we've been working steadily on these countermeasures so that they'll be ready if there's a next time

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:04.280
thank you so let's see it current thank you I also just have a couple clarification so it's like

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:10.120
this will go quick but following up with her just to reiterate so you're testing in small animals

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:16.360
mice now you're testing the candidate and then you had said something about the second phase was

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:21.720
looking at large populations of mice would that be with I mean large populations of mice or would

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.400
that be of something else that you said that I'm thinking about this next phase in the winter

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:33.080
I'm not quite sure what's going on so I'm just going to break it down again in terms of what are

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:41.560
the general phases of vaccine development first you decide down at the end so they did a lot of

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:47.880
messaging about this in March and April they used Fauci to do it and Berks to do it and Redfield to

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:54.360
do it and Bill Gates to do it and they had lots of different little diagrams to show how you know

01:53:54.440 --> 01:54:00.040
phase 1 and phase 2 could overlap in time and then we would accelerate everything and this is what

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:03.000
so he's already starting with that basic mythology right here.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:12.200
Tomic level what your vaccine is going to be and then you get have your best guess and you have

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:17.560
a few different options as to what that will be then you test all those different options in mice

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:25.880
meaning testing give them the vaccine and see what kind of immune response they have then typically

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:35.080
you go into larger animals like monkeys right that's typically the case whether we this is a new

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:43.480
virus we don't know which one of these animals is the most relevant one to humans you know mice

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:51.560
or mice mice are not humans right monkeys may be closer to humans and then you go into humans

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:58.120
and when you go into humans in that first phase you're just again looking at the safety of your

01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:05.640
vaccine and the immune response you're not looking at if it's effective again to protect you from

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:16.920
the virus the next phase is where you look at larger numbers of people for safety and immune

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:22.760
response again because the first phase in humans is just a few dozen people now we're talking hundreds

01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:32.600
to thousands and you start looking at is it protecting against infection and you need to have

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:38.440
large numbers of infections going on to be able to know whether or not it's protecting

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:46.520
against that so that's why we anticipate potentially if there's a second wave we got to be ready

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.560
make it all the way through those first studies in the animals and the safety and the immune

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:57.800
response so actually he reminds me of Raymond we're ready in position and ready to go if this

01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:01.640
comes back and there are a bunch of infections so we can know is it protecting

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:06.600
okay so you're planning to be of that second phase of humans by next winter just that's where

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.280
you are okay just wondering if there's anything I wanted to clarify as you said you've had a

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:17.080
candidate that was complimentary but not duplicative what exactly is the candidate I know you talked

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:23.720
about the spokes are you you two focusing on the spoke of the back of the virus yes but that's

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.280
just what NIH is also working on so everybody's working on the spoke right now just different

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:35.640
different ways different parts of the of the spoke or different versions of it and then different

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:44.360
ways now that's and that is interesting because actually if the messaging had already been sharp

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:52.040
enough he would have corrected her but it's actually not sharp enough yet in this in this video and he

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:58.840
rather than correcting her goes along with it to get the message across which is actually what you

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:03.560
would do if you were trying to communicate to a small group of people rather than the entire

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:14.520
nation but that's fine it's very cool to see I I would bet dollars to donuts that there isn't a

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:22.280
person in the world right now who isn't at least sufficiently brainwashed that if somebody

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.760
made the mistake that that blonde lady made in talking about the coronavirus that they would correct

01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:32.520
them every teacher at my kid's school would correct me if I said yeah but the spokes of the

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:39.400
coronavirus are what they made the vaccine from I think you mean spikes so this is pretty impressive

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:49.560
to express it so different parts of the of the spoke or different versions of it and then

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.840
different ways to express it see so he's already teaching everybody that who this isn't going to

01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:01.320
be a typical vaccine anymore but he's not actually saying that he's almost implying that other

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:08.040
vaccines do the same thing they express it no no no no he's preparing everybody to understand

01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.840
that the methodology is wholly different and he's not calling it a transfection even though

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:22.360
that's really what he means when he says express it's extraordinary so as I said there's different

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:28.040
ways so there's a DNA platform where you can express it there's the mRNA that Moderna is doing

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:35.000
with the NIH there are just using the protein itself there it's using it putting it on a nanoparticle

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:40.760
protein the University of washing different versions of the vaccine and different ways

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:44.680
to present it actually there was a guy at the University of Pittsburgh who was working on

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:51.400
putting the spike protein on the outside of the measles virus I shit you not yes to the immune

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:56.440
system okay so I know we're right 10 after right now so we'll hit Haley we're probably gonna wrap

01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:02.280
it up sir if you get so thank you and thank you all for doing this one question for you general

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:08.600
tally last year in the fall for due trick the research institute had to pause testing for some

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:14.200
safety concerns can you go into what has been done since then to sort of make that a non-issue

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:20.040
and then it's also I know that rare has gone over you said different SARS and the different

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:25.240
strains of this what makes this different from the previous strains that you've been looking at

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:28.680
and how have you kind of noticed the differences and and how that will affect the vaccine that

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:35.880
you're developing yeah absolutely I appreciate the question yes so United States Army Medical

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:42.280
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and that's the the BSL for biosafety level four lab

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:51.240
that I that I mentioned but on the 18th of July of 2019 they were issued a cease and desist order

01:59:51.240 --> 02:00:01.480
by the CDC violations because of improper practices all resulting from a number of structural defects

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:07.960
they develop workarounds that just just were not safe there was never any any danger of risk to

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:16.360
the community or or breaking the containment which is what the labs are for since then proud to say

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:24.120
worked very hard to come back and meet CDC regulatory standards the CDC came back for a

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:32.040
reinspection after a about a 90 day plan of action in milestones very aggressively went after that

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:41.400
and the CDC restored the laboratory to a limited operational capability limited in that the same

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:49.880
volume that the laboratory had been become accustomed to through putting much much smaller levels

02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:56.840
and then certain types of testing as I mentioned BSL for being the highest type biosafety laboratory

02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:04.920
for being the highest level not to that level but probably a a smaller level or a level just shy

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:10.520
of that where the the most dangerous procedures weren't being done this is what this was in it

02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:16.840
yeah I didn't see a Bavari after he left didn't he go like work for for the maker of Remdesivir

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.880
like didn't he go alert for Gulad I don't know he will stand up of capabilities after being down

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:33.000
for so long the CDC came back two weeks ago first two weeks actually three weeks ago now in February

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:39.320
came back for a second inspection this inspection was to allow even more capabilities more capacity

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:45.720
to be performed again proud to say night and day difference according to the CDC and we were

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:53.160
issued a letter to restore even higher level capabilities that letter was issued to us just

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:59.880
this past Friday and so with respect to coronavirus and coronavirus is not considered

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:08.840
a a safety level type of type of virus that that that falls into the same category some of the

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:15.880
other higher types so we have full authorization to perform at the highest levels of scientific

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:24.120
capacity at the laboratory for coronavirus other types of diseases that might meet some

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:31.800
of the CDC's criteria still having a gradual return to full operations but with coronavirus

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:38.440
we're going to be able to conduct laboratory research at the highest levels at the laboratory

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:44.760
and can perform so that's kind of where we are real proud it's been a work in progress

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.640
we took the advantage of the operational pause if you will to to really

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:56.200
refine our standard operating procedures and frankly the complete culture has changed at that

02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:04.840
institution and they're they're back and certainly with coronavirus it's amazing to watch the entire

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:09.640
enterprise mobilize the way they have thank you

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:18.920
regarding your second question about how this virus differs from others and what we've learned

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:28.280
probably everybody's familiar now of some of the that there are seven human coronaviruses that we

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:36.200
know of and that they highly pathogenic ones the ones that tend to kill are SARS-1

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:44.760
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and then the current coronavirus and so we have been

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:53.480
working on those other very more dangerous and deadly viruses like MERS and the first SARS

02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:03.640
what we've learned is really at the very basic atomic level when I mentioned that we first look

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:10.680
at the atomic level of these spokes these spikes that's where we've been focusing on because that's

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:19.400
the kind that's where the differences matter the most in terms of what kind of immune response you

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:28.120
get to it how efficiently it attaches to the cells in your lung and one of our chief scientists

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:34.840
Dr. Gordon Joyce has been doing a lot of the work on that in determining the structures in

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:40.600
collaboration again with our partners at the NIH National Institutes of Health the Vaccine

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.880
Research Center so Dr. Joyce myself we both came from the Vaccine Research Center working with

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:51.080
Dr. Graham and Dr. Kismekia Corbett under Dr. John Mascola and then one of the other

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:56.280
structures that came out is Dr. Jason McLennan at the University of Texas at Austin we've all

02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:01.000
this should give you an idea also how this is a very tight knit family we're kind of spread

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.760
across different centers but we talk to each other all the time because we have that very close

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:15.640
public health and scientific community so there are similarities between this virus and

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.960
some of these other viruses but there are obviously very key differences between

02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:30.920
MERS and this SARS-CoV-2 there's about 50% difference in the sequence with SARS-1 there's

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:37.880
about 20% difference but that that 20% matters obviously quite a bit and so that's the kind of

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:43.960
studying that we've been doing when we first got those sequences and the world got those

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:49.880
sequences back on January 10th we started looking down at the atomic level as to how they differ

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:55.240
and so please in general I know we've been going for a little bit so I want to be able to wrap this

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:59.000
up sir we're going to have folks standing by to do the follow-on questions but sir if you want

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:07.400
to do closing remarks well since there will be a vaccine already in time for this cycle of

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:12.600
coronavirus could you please give your best advice to the the force and the public in general

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.240
about how to kind of ride this out for now

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:24.600
well I you know it's really is I mean we are literally living in influenza season people are

02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:31.400
getting infected and dying of this disease I like to remind people that during the Ebola outbreak

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:35.640
both the one that just happened in the democratic republic of Congo and in west Africa

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:41.640
you know somewhere between 16 to 19 000 people were still dying every week of HIV infection so

02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:49.560
you know the the public the medical community's governments were really gotten very good at

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:55.640
managing how we deal with the scourges of infectious disease so like any respiratory virus

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:59.400
you know we're going to be getting ourselves into the habit of washing our hands much more

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:04.200
frequently if you could if there's one thing that you can do it's wash your hands much more frequently

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:08.280
height so I mean we're we're both clinicians as well we go into the hospital

02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.280
a nurse will wrap you on the on the knuckles if you don't wash your hands coming into the room

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:17.320
or coming out even if you don't touch anything so that's critical the the things that we already

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.840
know how to do we do social distancing you know we're not going to be doing a lot of hugging

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:27.880
and kissing if people are sick they should stay home if they're you know if they really are

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:33.080
are very very ill then they can go into the hospital so um but hospitals now are

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:37.800
getting very good about about you know how they would approach making sure that they can

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:42.200
protect their staff as well as protecting other patients from someone who might be a risk so

02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:46.920
you know I think people should should recognize at the end of the day this still remains on low risk

02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:55.080
infection to not just our service members but to the american public and that we are really good

02:07:55.080 --> 02:08:01.960
as a hospital system as a medical care system from both the EMT up to intensive care units that

02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:06.760
taking care of these I'm not minimizing I'm just saying that even the absence of a vaccine we still

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:11.480
don't have a vaccine for HIV infection but we have very good drugs and we're beginning to develop

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:18.440
monoclonal antibodies so you know we will continue to to campaign against these infectious disease

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:23.800
threats as we would against enemies against the homeland and we're we're good at doing those

02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:28.760
sorts of things but the american public should be reassured that that this is a threat that we're

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:33.960
used to from from the standpoint of influenza we are working on developing measures but

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:41.080
everyone can assist just by washing their hands well I hope uh hopefully you've been able to hear

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:45.720
that uh when you're talking to the different agencies that are out there and you're getting

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:50.520
different responses for what they're doing individually this is truly a whole of government

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:56.520
approach so certainly if if one uh one agency one organization if it's an industry partner if

02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.760
it's academia I think we're well nested and we're sharing information and collaborating so that

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:10.920
we're able to leverage the right resources to bring a vaccination or vaccine candidate as we've

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:16.680
learned about today across the finish line so we're going to continue to collaborate in the fashion

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:23.560
that we that we have and we're going to work as hard as we can to find the right treatments

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.280
the right preventative measures and um it's certainly the right detection capabilities that

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:34.680
are out there those are our three focus areas within within the DoD um we really appreciate your time

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:41.560
today and um uh again thank you very much it's been a it's been a pleasure so everybody thanks

02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.280
for coming today so we have some folks are going to stand by in this room to do follow up questions

02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.800
for you thank you very much for being here tonight um this has been giga ohm biological high

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:55.640
resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist you can support me at

02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:00.920
giga ohm biological.com and you can share this stream from twitch and elsewhere i'm going to be

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:05.320
putting up a couple episodes on sub stack this week yet i apologize for not having up something

02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:10.440
already i've got the subtitles on a couple videos but i haven't actually done the transcript yet so

02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:18.040
i will very soon next couple days um tomorrow i'm going to be interviewed by uh the last american

02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:24.760
vagabond which i believe is the one of the the websites and news sources that has Whitney

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.360
web on it i'm going to be interviewed by ryan christian tomorrow i'm not sure if i'm going to

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:33.000
put that live or if i'm going to let him record it and then make it an episode we'll probably

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.440
talk about that before i start so either it'll be right on there oh that's the old list sorry about

02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:46.360
that um it will either be uh live at around noon or it will i will be live sometime in the

02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:51.800
afternoon after that interview um but that's probably pretty fun um i'm excited about that

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:58.520
uh so anyway um that's been a show sorry it was late i need to go get a midnight snack and then

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.280
go to bed um and i will see you again tomorrow thank you very much for joining me

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:31.240
so

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:47.360
.
