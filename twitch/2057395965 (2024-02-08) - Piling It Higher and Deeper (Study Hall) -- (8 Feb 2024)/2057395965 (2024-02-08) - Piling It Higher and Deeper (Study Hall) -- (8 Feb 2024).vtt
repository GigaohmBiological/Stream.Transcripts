00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
So, I'm going to go ahead and see if I can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Jeffrey, how are ya? Left hand monkey wrench. You are indeed first on my end, too. Hello, Albert.

01:30.000 --> 01:51.000
Hi, Pamela. Hi, Mark.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
V got your card today or yesterday, Pamela. Thank you.

02:00.000 --> 02:17.000
The rules protect yourself at all times, follow my instructions, keep it clean, touch gloves if you wish, and let's do it.

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
20 pounds. This is so crazy. Like, these bumps. This is so crazy. I feel so nervous. Like, what in the world, man?

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, man, I didn't have this up. You don't have that.

02:37.000 --> 02:48.000
That's why I need to run the introduction, so I get all my sound right. As usual, one man pan clouded around here.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
This is Gigo and biological. Welcome to the show. I'm very happy to be here. Trying to dispel the enchantment.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
Probably should have a biggie on that one. Trying to learn biology, and I think we're doing a fairly good job of it.

03:07.000 --> 03:24.000
Trying to stay skeptical as well. Going to adopt every new fan in the business here, because we've got to remember to follow behind that you're here in the sound.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, that makes me Gigo. I'm sorry. That's just wrong. That makes me Gigo.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Sorry, I never give you enough time to read that one, but it's a hard one to read.

03:42.000 --> 03:59.000
They have conned us into teaching this mythology. Sorry. They have conned us into teaching this mythology to our children.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
They really have, though. They have conned us into teaching this mythology to our children.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
We're doing the city of the ages.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Yes, two days ago. What sites did you see?

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Janet Reno, you're a very funny lady. Y'all, that's funny.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Sing your band, and then tell me, Bob.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
God.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You don't understand, Mr. Brown.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Holy weapon.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Don't forget that he's sounding reasonable by design, right? That's the whole thing.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
The idea is to make you ashamed of your own politics.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
The idea was to make him sound like he was much better than the statesmen and states women of America.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
That's the idea. It's the whole idea.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Don't get down about it. See it for what it is.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
This multi-polar world plan of theirs. You've got to kind of see this performance for what it is.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
These are not journalistic endeavors so much as announcements.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
The way that we win is we focus on the biology and we make this touchdown where we actually alert people

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
to what has been done to us with regard to public health and we discredit the public health narrative.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
That's how we're going to win. We don't have to worry about all the other stuff right now.

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
We can, but I think personally, for me, I'm going to stay focused on the biology.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
There are rooms like this, though. There are rooms like this. There are programs like this one.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
And we need to keep swinging because they're not going to stop.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
This is their plan for how to govern us into the foreseeable future.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
This is their plan for how to govern us into the foreseeable future.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And if you can't see it, that's great for them.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
If you forget about your history and let them slowly erase it and replace it, that's great for them.

06:28.000 --> 06:39.000
I really do think that the hope only lies in our young people, our college age kids realizing that even the mythology of HIV and AIDS needs to be revisited,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
the mythology of cancer-causing viruses needs to be revisited,

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
and the people that were involved in encouraging with billions of dollars of research funding

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
and special programs in the government need to be revisited

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
because they have been telling this story about the coming singularity that solves all of humanity's problems.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
And it's not anywhere near it happening, but this is what motivates these people.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
This is the charlatan-like power that they have over the entire world.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
And we need to dispel this mythology by pursuing what is the...

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
I guess best described as the irreducible complexity of the sacred biology.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
The most beautiful stuff in biology is this sacred biology.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And this is the biology that's easier to ignore.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
It's easier to pretend that we have almost all the problems solved, all the questions answered.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
And if you just breathe hard enough, that mist disappears.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
You just breathe hard enough, that mist disappears.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
This information brief is brought to you by a biologist, a patchclamp physiologist.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Gigome is an actual real value of resistance.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
And so it's kind of a corny pun or play on words there.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
Gigome, biological, high-resistance, low-noise, information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And if you've been following me for a while, you're up here at the top of the wave

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
and we stay focused on the biology up here.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
We don't take the bait on TV, and we love our neighbors.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
And I can't thank enough everybody who has subscribed in the last couple weeks.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
This is an old list. It's stuttering along right now.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I apologize for that.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
So Simon, Fabrizio, Catherine, Carolyn, Lori, Michelle, Leo, Jeffrey,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
you've all had your names read once, and it's not to say that that's some kind of reward.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
It just means that there probably should be other names up here, but I haven't put them up yet.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And also there's probably a few extra subscribers on here.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
And so those people will be up on there tomorrow.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I wasn't planning on doing there. It stopped stuttering.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I wasn't planning on doing the whole beginning.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I was just going to do all my sound checks offline.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
And then I ran out of time, so this is the way that I normally do it.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It's probably the best way to do it anyway.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
It's probably the best way to do it anyway.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And this, I believe, is copyright.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
So I'm going to just play some games here and pretend like I can just do this.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Master DJ that I am, just push a couple buttons and set it back a few minutes.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
And so yes, we are still reviewing this narrative of a novel virus that appeared in 2020

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and has been circulating going on five years now.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
I think this is part of the biological mythology that you can use to start to open people's mind.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
It's very easy for them to hear three or two or three years ago, two or three years ago.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And people start to shorten the time period.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
They almost want you to forget about the whole year of 2020, maybe even 2021.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
And that's a very, very dangerous mistake because in 2020 and 2021

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
were when many of the people that were ahead of the curve were burnt to the hardest.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And this is the part of the story that most people want to ignore.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
The faith in the novel virus was established then.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
And the people that had the courage to question it back then are the people that are suffered the most, I think,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
and are still suffering now because other people have stepped in front of them

11:05.000 --> 11:17.000
because of apparent credentials or inventions or patterns rather than for their principles that they had in 2020.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
And in fact, even people that have had principles in 2020 are being misconstrued as people who are just cynical.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
And if you were cynical, you got it right.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
But, you know, cynical doesn't mean you have a good idea of what's going on.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And this is just ridiculous.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
And so we're going to revisit a little bit of that tonight because they're making the noise.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
So we might as well, you know, acknowledge that we hear that noise.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
They're definitely not making any noise about those statements though.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Definitely not making any noise about those statements.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Mike Vandenberg, next date.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And that's what's kind of disappointing about all of this stuff.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
They're not making any noise at all.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
They're not questioning any of the pillars of this faith.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
And instead ignoring the lack of spread in New York City,

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
ignoring what virology is or isn't in all of the excellent work that has been done by people before this on AIDS

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
and on all viruses in general, the idea that placebo batches could have been used,

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
the idea that transfection is a known thing, an idea that was there before the pandemic

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
and people that have been using it should have known that using this in healthy humans was ridiculous.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
I mean, it was harder to see that the protocols were murder because the TV wasn't telling us

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
because the TV people were lying about it because the doctors in the hospitals didn't know any better.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But the protocols were definitely murder.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
It's tough to know that gain of function was a mythology because again,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
most of us were just watching this as casual observers for years.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
And when you're told these things are possible, then you know, you just kind of shrug your shoulders,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
especially if it's somebody like James Giordano and you just say, yeah, okay, whatever.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
But we've been fooled into solving this mystery and by solving this mystery,

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
we've accepted the monsters and the spectacular commitment to lies that all the players have exhibited

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
is all that's really necessary for this Scooby-Doo to go on into the future.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
But at Game of Go and Biological, we are over the target.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
That's why so many people are angry, so many people are calling us gatekeepers

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
or controlled opposition or massage agents or CIA or whatever it is this week.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
It's pretty hilarious.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
I think my wife at this point wishes I was one of those things

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
because any one of those jobs would pay better than shaking a can on the Internet right now.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
This was my long intro deck.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Wow, holy cats, sorry about that.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
But we're almost done. I can see it now. I can see the end of the tunnel here.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
That one needs to be fixed too.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
This was the paradigm shift one.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Uh-huh.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And... there we go.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
We are going to make gentle the life of this world.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I really like that statement.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I got a couple of bronze coins that say it.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh, this is repeating.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That one, that repeated.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I didn't fix that either.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
That was what we were doing this morning.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
There we go.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Please tell me this is the end of this story.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.320
there we go please tell me this is the end of this where are we yes there she

14:25.320 --> 14:31.640
is the one that makes this work and happened the the second half of giga

14:31.640 --> 14:35.940
home biological there my best friend thank you very much thank her very much

14:35.940 --> 14:42.700
for making this possible along with Greg and and and Stephen call Stephen

14:42.700 --> 14:50.620
see excuse me and other people almost said people's names there this is February

14:50.620 --> 14:57.820
8th 2024 we are in the fifth year of this fiasco it does really feel like we're

14:57.820 --> 15:02.700
trapped at a never-ending little drama on a starship unable to get out of this

15:02.700 --> 15:06.580
loop in time where everybody just keeps complaining about what just happened

15:06.580 --> 15:11.220
and complaining about the mistakes that were made and fighting about them but

15:11.220 --> 15:15.660
never really moving on to say what did we really really learn and I think that's

15:15.660 --> 15:21.940
kind of where I want to go tonight where what did we really really learn let me

15:21.940 --> 15:27.180
see if this cameras in focus I don't know that we're really having learned

15:27.180 --> 15:33.060
very much it's actually kind of frightening I think I'm gonna pop out of

15:33.060 --> 15:39.420
this I'm gonna pop out of this little thing here we are the independent bright

15:39.420 --> 15:45.500
web there's a few there's a few candidate independent bright web people

15:45.500 --> 15:50.060
like myself I think there's you know I would put mark he's a tonic live mark

15:50.060 --> 15:56.100
kulek in that independent bright web category I might even put I'm at Mollick

15:56.100 --> 16:03.700
doctor Doc Malick podcast that guy I might even put him in that independent

16:03.700 --> 16:09.300
bright web category I mean I know that that Jessica Hockett is in a bro with

16:09.300 --> 16:15.060
with a show but I might I might put Jessica Hockett in that group of of

16:15.060 --> 16:20.100
independent bright web members anybody that's fighting for our grandkids

16:20.100 --> 16:25.660
anybody that's fighting to figuratively plant trees under whose shade you will

16:25.660 --> 16:30.420
never shelter that that's what we're doing here that's what we're trying to do

16:30.460 --> 16:35.260
here at giga ohm biological and those figurative trees are really knowledge

16:35.260 --> 16:44.180
of where the the the irreducible complexity of biology is and how to see

16:44.180 --> 16:50.740
it how to understand it and how to appreciate it and maybe even how to slowly

16:50.740 --> 16:59.080
probe it and understand it better but to do so with a reverence of do not

16:59.120 --> 17:09.400
disturb a reverence of assuming that however this grand system you know of

17:09.400 --> 17:16.320
pattern integrity is working that should best observe it rather than

17:16.320 --> 17:24.560
perturb it in this sense I just want to play a few interesting ideas go through

17:24.560 --> 17:36.640
a few interesting ideas here I don't think well how can I say this excuse me

17:36.640 --> 17:43.480
that's not what you're supposed to be I think it's really important to start

17:43.480 --> 17:49.160
with a slide like this all the time because it is my goal it is my overarching

17:49.200 --> 17:54.160
idea that we need to start with a foundation of not misleading the young

17:54.160 --> 18:05.160
and in in the biological in the biological space I think it is very very easy to

18:05.160 --> 18:12.680
partake in this worst-case scenario and narrative festival which goes very

18:12.680 --> 18:16.600
hand-in-hand with the climate change thing where the world is going to end in

18:16.640 --> 18:21.800
12 years and that animals are going to go extinct and everything is going to

18:21.800 --> 18:28.440
collapse independent of whether or not that is possible independent of that of

18:28.440 --> 18:34.960
whether or not that's going to happen the idea that we have a firm grasp and

18:34.960 --> 18:39.600
understanding of how that is going to happen and all the the mechanisms that

18:39.600 --> 18:45.000
are at play with regard to how that's happening and that one very crucial clue

18:45.320 --> 18:52.560
about that is carbon dioxide or another clue his surface temperature or or these

18:52.560 --> 18:57.920
kinds of things are rather absurd simply because the whole system has so many

18:57.920 --> 19:03.280
other variables involved in it that are more important than it would it would

19:03.280 --> 19:14.680
be ridiculous to to to say such a thing and so I would really love to at some

19:14.720 --> 19:19.160
point in time have the opportunity to work with people who work with kids like

19:19.160 --> 19:24.160
young kids to get them to think more on a Buckminster Fuller kind of way with

19:24.160 --> 19:30.680
regard to you know raising your kids with a with a healthy respect and

19:30.680 --> 19:35.840
reverence for nature when you look out into nature you should see something to

19:35.840 --> 19:43.120
emulate Buckminster Buckminster Fuller said that you know and he looks at trees

19:43.120 --> 19:49.160
what he sees is how wood is supposed to be worked and and it's probably not

19:49.160 --> 19:53.520
exactly what he said but but that that's the kind of idea that in a lot of ways

19:53.520 --> 20:00.160
what makes AI so cool is that when you use AI to say okay how would you know

20:00.160 --> 20:06.120
to sort out how to how to create a structure for example and you allow it

20:06.120 --> 20:15.360
to use rules or or or I don't know how the right what the right but to use

20:15.360 --> 20:20.800
life as a model to use trees as a model to use to use living things as a model

20:20.800 --> 20:26.320
you get these you get these structures that are very difficult to predict or

20:26.320 --> 20:31.520
impossible to predict but they actually do in many ways mimic the way that

20:31.600 --> 20:36.920
living organisms organize their their structures and that's probably a

20:36.920 --> 20:42.640
terrible example the idea again is to say that we need to put these young

20:42.640 --> 20:50.440
people's curiosity about the natural world into a into proper focus and and

20:50.440 --> 20:56.000
into proper reverence and a frame of reverence not a frame of reference but a

20:56.040 --> 21:02.000
frame of reverence is what I hope Giga on biological could give from the

21:02.000 --> 21:08.600
perspective of a biology news source or whatever we're gonna call this thing I

21:08.600 --> 21:15.720
don't I hate the word teacher because it sounds so but a fellow explorer you

21:15.720 --> 21:19.000
know that's what we're doing and I just happen to have the cameras so I'm on

21:19.000 --> 21:22.840
this side of it but but you know it's just a fellow explorer we're trying to

21:22.880 --> 21:28.520
figure out what who we are as a as a people and as a species and where we

21:28.520 --> 21:34.680
fit in this in the grand scheme of life on earth and and the the way that we

21:34.680 --> 21:40.880
are being governed is to take away that reverence to make that as trivial as

21:40.880 --> 21:48.920
possible and instead turn that reverence toward some kind of materialism some

21:48.960 --> 21:56.680
kind of society oriented or government oriented or or collective oriented

21:56.680 --> 22:03.360
morality instead of a reverence for nature and a reverence for our you know

22:03.360 --> 22:10.000
tiny place in the world our reverence for the perfection of a newborn baby and

22:10.000 --> 22:14.560
these these things have been manipulated on purpose these ideas have been

22:14.600 --> 22:21.520
manipulated in us on purpose and through media and television and movies over

22:21.520 --> 22:28.600
many years I believe but this has ramped up I don't think in the 70s the extent

22:28.600 --> 22:36.160
to which these these these things were under attack cognitively is anywhere

22:36.160 --> 22:41.200
near what they you can compare it to nowadays where really we are under

22:41.200 --> 22:47.080
assault there is no there is no restraint to how many channels and how

22:47.080 --> 22:51.280
many messages and how many possibilities and how many bad ideas are out there

22:51.280 --> 22:55.560
right now that our children and our young people and our young adults are

22:55.560 --> 22:59.520
forced to deal with it in some way or another even if it's just tuning out

22:59.520 --> 23:05.000
but that's also limiting in that sense then right if you can't watch the news

23:05.000 --> 23:09.560
and find something useful without going through an incredible amount of stress

23:09.560 --> 23:14.480
and making an incredible number of mistakes then it it has the same

23:14.480 --> 23:19.880
chilling effect on your you know your your desire to participate as a

23:19.880 --> 23:26.320
citizen and that's the whole idea they don't they want everybody to go limp and

23:26.320 --> 23:30.600
I think there's been people that throughout the pandemic have explained

23:30.600 --> 23:35.040
that that if you can't have you don't have any control over the stress that

23:35.080 --> 23:40.000
you experience then you tend to become helpless and and this is the psychological

23:40.000 --> 23:44.200
effect of the pandemic this is what they have been doing to us since we've been

23:44.200 --> 23:52.880
sitting on our couches and that's really that's really what the worst case scenario

23:52.880 --> 23:57.600
was all about get you on your couch and then repeat over and over again and

23:57.600 --> 24:04.800
plant it over and over again either way you can plant it in in discussions

24:04.800 --> 24:11.000
where the lab leak idea is ridiculous you can plant it in discussions where

24:11.000 --> 24:16.280
people are arguing for the plausibility of the lab leak on some weird podcast

24:16.280 --> 24:23.160
like Brett Weinstein and together those two things combined to create this

24:23.160 --> 24:27.920
limited spectrum of debate where when you meet some people at work it doesn't

24:27.920 --> 24:31.920
matter who you talk to or what side of the debate they saw before they ran into

24:31.960 --> 24:38.520
you you're all ready to ready to interact in this pre puppeteered manner with

24:38.520 --> 24:44.720
these pre puppeteered questions because they were pre puppeteered on that little

24:44.720 --> 24:53.160
tiny device right there and it didn't matter whether you were a Democrat or

24:53.160 --> 24:57.240
a Republican or an independent you were gonna be puppeteered because we were

24:57.240 --> 25:04.320
forced to stay home and everybody that was an authority figure they had an

25:04.320 --> 25:12.800
illusion of consensus about the rationale the rationality of lockdowns and the

25:12.800 --> 25:21.400
moral acceptability of lockdowns no one was allowed to credibly question it and

25:21.440 --> 25:28.120
therefore no one questioned it no one felt the possibility of questioning and I

25:28.120 --> 25:33.400
wanted to question it when I was sitting in a gymnasium full of adults that

25:33.400 --> 25:40.240
were masked watching a concert band fully masked I wanted to stand up and

25:40.240 --> 25:48.120
scream but the illusion of consensus on every phone and every television in the

25:48.200 --> 25:53.520
township every kid and every adult in that room made it really hard and what

25:53.520 --> 26:00.120
would have happened if I would have done it I don't look back and think that I

26:00.120 --> 26:05.600
I do kind of look back and think I wish I would have but what would have happened

26:05.600 --> 26:11.120
I would have humiliated my son I would have humiliated my wife and

26:11.120 --> 26:15.840
humiliated my other son and my daughter that was sitting next to me watching and

26:16.320 --> 26:22.240
would I've achieved anything maybe if I would have said exactly the right words

26:22.240 --> 26:26.640
but that's every time you push the button of the stream you think maybe this is

26:26.640 --> 26:31.240
gonna be the stream that changes things it may finally wakes people up to

26:31.240 --> 26:35.000
realize they don't just lie about some stuff they're lying about everything and

26:35.000 --> 26:40.600
it's not just been the pandemic it's been before that and I've had the same

26:40.600 --> 26:44.520
problem where I thought yeah of course they're lying about Iraq of course they're

26:44.520 --> 26:48.800
lying about 9-11 of course they lie about terrorism but they would never lie

26:48.800 --> 26:57.840
about biology they would never lie about medicine why would they lie about public

26:57.840 --> 27:02.280
health and disease that's just crazy of course they lie about people of course

27:02.280 --> 27:06.960
that people lie about people of course their spies of course politicians lie of

27:06.960 --> 27:12.600
course the the press secretary lies but why would they ever lie about biology

27:12.600 --> 27:19.600
that was me that was me I mean that that that's why I went into science because

27:19.600 --> 27:24.240
you can't lie about science I mean come on science science I mean obviously it's

27:24.240 --> 27:31.080
science it's how can you lie about it and it takes a very sophisticated

27:31.080 --> 27:35.000
understanding not to say that I'm sophisticated but to say that you've got

27:35.000 --> 27:41.720
to put a lot of time into it in order to reach the brick wall that is that

27:41.720 --> 27:47.560
mythology that is that illusion that the that the irreducible complexity is

27:47.560 --> 27:54.200
gone that we've solved the problem because we we we sequence the human genome and

27:54.200 --> 27:58.320
that was a long time ago and we're on to bigger and brighter things and we're

27:58.320 --> 28:04.160
about to solve every problem in the book when the reality is is we have more

28:04.160 --> 28:09.520
problems than ever it more diseases than ever it's not that we just found names

28:09.560 --> 28:16.480
for them it's not that we're just getting better at finding them it's

28:16.480 --> 28:27.040
because there are more than ever more disease conditions in the human

28:27.040 --> 28:32.160
condition than there ever have been most likely and you can say oh yeah but

28:32.160 --> 28:35.720
everybody was dirtier and they didn't have any food back then but they weren't

28:35.720 --> 28:43.480
having the chronic diseases that we have now that are involved with process

28:43.480 --> 28:52.200
foods or no exercise or or bad air or bad water I mean yeah they had bad water

28:52.200 --> 28:58.200
but not this kind of bad water not the bad water with chemicals in it not bad

28:58.240 --> 29:05.880
water with with flame retardants in it not the bad water with lead in it bad

29:05.880 --> 29:11.080
water with Giardia in it you know bad water with animal excrement and other

29:11.080 --> 29:19.160
diseases in it yes that's true yeah that's a different kind of bad water and so

29:19.160 --> 29:25.360
I'm still wondering if it's possible that at some point there's gonna be this

29:25.360 --> 29:30.680
breaking moment where I was because I had this breaking moment I'm one of

29:30.680 --> 29:35.600
these idiots that right up until 2022 I didn't understand that the vaccine

29:35.600 --> 29:41.000
schedule was a criminal enterprise a holy criminal enterprise I didn't

29:41.000 --> 29:46.880
understand it I'm I'm very very sorry that I didn't understand it I had a

29:46.880 --> 29:52.280
really good chance and I didn't snap out of it when I could have snapped out of

29:52.320 --> 29:56.840
it when my my daughter was born I wasn't I didn't see it I didn't get it I got

29:56.840 --> 30:01.880
it but I didn't get it and the reason why I didn't get it was because I didn't

30:01.880 --> 30:06.840
push far enough I didn't keep asking I said I got these doubts I know it's

30:06.840 --> 30:17.000
wrong but I'm not gonna I'm just just gonna kind of you know ignore it and this

30:17.000 --> 30:20.120
is where we are with the COVID thing right now this is where we are with the

30:20.120 --> 30:24.960
transfection thing right now this is where we are with 2020 and the lockdowns

30:24.960 --> 30:30.560
and masks and protocols right now we are we don't want to ask any more

30:30.560 --> 30:34.520
questions we don't want to work harder we don't want to add we don't want to

30:34.520 --> 30:38.840
address Jessica Hockett we just want to ignore we don't want to talk about that

30:38.840 --> 30:42.320
what happened in Italy anymore we don't want to debate about it anymore it's

30:42.320 --> 30:57.400
just enough we want to move on but we can't because it is in 2020 in 2021 that

30:57.400 --> 31:03.880
the truth can be found it is in those numbers it is in those bodies it is in

31:03.880 --> 31:10.320
those stories that can or cannot be verified it is in those death certificates

31:10.320 --> 31:15.760
it is in all of those testimonies it is in all of those people that were

31:15.760 --> 31:23.680
there it's in those hospital records we need all of this and we need it now we

31:23.680 --> 31:28.560
need to work on this now because it needs to be verified that something

31:28.560 --> 31:35.600
happened and how it happened and when it happened and to who it happened or we

31:35.600 --> 31:39.400
aren't gonna understand it and we will never understand it and the gatekeepers

31:39.440 --> 31:44.320
of this narrative will remain the same people that they are right now who are

31:44.320 --> 31:47.920
insistent that there was a novel virus that killed millions of people around

31:47.920 --> 31:52.680
the world but millions more were saved from it came from gain a function and

31:52.680 --> 32:01.680
will come again that's how they plan to completely eliminate your ability to

32:01.680 --> 32:07.640
exercise informed consent there's no saying no and it's emergency you heard

32:07.640 --> 32:10.960
Sam Harris say it right at the beginning of the pandemic and you heard Brett

32:10.960 --> 32:19.480
Weinstein agree with him and these bad ideas are not going away they're still

32:19.480 --> 32:23.560
spreading around people are still denying that they had these bad ideas

32:23.560 --> 32:29.720
that they perpetuated these are bad that they championed them and worse yet

32:29.720 --> 32:33.800
they're still arguing about the minutia of them as if as if they're not just

32:33.880 --> 32:36.520
holy dismissible in the same way that you know

32:36.520 --> 32:41.040
transfection might be okay if we could get the DNA out well lockdowns might be

32:41.040 --> 32:45.560
alright if we didn't do it quite as soft as we did but we did it hard and we

32:45.560 --> 32:49.840
did it for real and it would be over

32:56.720 --> 33:01.400
and so this illusion of consensus is still going on and I'm still working in

33:01.400 --> 33:05.560
the background to try and put together a response that everybody can can be

33:05.560 --> 33:10.560
happy about and it's gonna come in the next I don't know five days or

33:10.560 --> 33:15.200
something like that maybe less I don't think everybody's gonna stand up and

33:15.200 --> 33:22.560
cheer anymore than I think anybody I hoped that they would in 2021 when I did

33:22.560 --> 33:27.480
my first immunology four-hour lecture I'd hope they do it in 2022 and I did it

33:27.480 --> 33:31.920
again I hope they would do it in 2023 when I did it again and then in May of

33:31.920 --> 33:38.960
2023 when I did it again but nobody ever sees the big picture because most of the

33:38.960 --> 33:44.640
people that are involved in this are still interested in extending the worst

33:44.640 --> 33:51.640
case scenario confusion and blending it in with the transfection somehow blending

33:51.640 --> 33:56.040
it in and and confusing it with the spike of the transfection the spike of

33:56.040 --> 34:02.920
the virus and everybody's working for that still so I some part of me is

34:02.920 --> 34:09.440
resigned to say maybe I'm wrong maybe there was a a toxic spike protein that

34:09.440 --> 34:14.520
was traveling around the world on the back of a coronavirus that was created

34:14.520 --> 34:19.720
in a laboratory cloned in a laboratory and released and it ran all around the

34:19.720 --> 34:23.160
world like wildfire I don't know how it happened I don't know what I don't know

34:23.200 --> 34:29.240
anything about it but I do know that there were a number of people at the

34:29.240 --> 34:34.200
beginning of the pandemic that had no business knowing what they knew knowing

34:34.200 --> 34:38.760
about the fear and cleavage site knowing about amyloidosis and prion disease

34:38.760 --> 34:46.440
and looking at the little tiny inserts in the in the in the receptor binding

34:46.440 --> 34:50.400
domain between s1 and s2 and describing these things as though they were

34:50.400 --> 34:55.840
virologists but actually before that they were anti-vax

34:55.840 --> 35:03.280
anti-vax biologists before that they were working on longevity solutions and

35:03.280 --> 35:08.080
then suddenly they were became virologists and could have instantly

35:08.080 --> 35:11.360
identified the fear and cleavage site and make some argument how this is

35:11.360 --> 35:15.600
definitive evidence for a lab leak

35:16.480 --> 35:23.280
and so these extraordinary claims require you know extraordinary evidence and

35:23.280 --> 35:27.280
they don't have it they don't have any evidence for how they just happen to

35:27.280 --> 35:31.440
say you know I just happened to hear that this pandemic was well

35:31.440 --> 35:35.520
there this there was this virus and I just happened to have some spare time so I

35:35.520 --> 35:39.520
thought I'd blast the sequence and lo and behold I noticed that a couple of

35:39.520 --> 35:45.280
this this motif was very strange it was a poly basic cleavage site and I thought

35:45.280 --> 35:52.560
it was very curious so I decided to write a blog about it in January of 2020

35:52.800 --> 35:58.000
nobody can claim that unless you already have a few papers on coronavirus

35:58.000 --> 36:02.560
and you have a few papers on the fusion protein and you have a so maybe

36:02.560 --> 36:06.400
maybe there are a couple people in the world who wrote a blog post about it

36:06.400 --> 36:13.360
that were legitimately from a from a professional perspective okay or

36:13.360 --> 36:16.560
or an experienced perspective it makes sense that you're writing about this

36:16.560 --> 36:20.560
molecule and about this particular cleavage site

36:20.560 --> 36:25.280
but everybody else is an instant red flag absolutely instant red flag and

36:25.280 --> 36:28.480
anyone should have seen it they were worst case scenarios

36:28.480 --> 36:33.520
now the reason why I'm showing this reviewed the reason why I'm showing this

36:33.520 --> 36:38.160
is because this is a video from the swine flu in 2009

36:38.160 --> 36:42.960
and everybody that was invested that was fighting for the worst case scenario

36:42.960 --> 36:51.920
was ignoring Wolfgang Wodach in 2020 I felt very much like I had seen a ghost

36:51.920 --> 36:59.040
because I saw Wolfgang Wodach's testimony a couple times about what he thought

36:59.040 --> 37:04.160
was going on here and every time I shared his name or his video with somebody

37:04.240 --> 37:10.320
in one of these streams or or group discussions that I was involved in

37:10.320 --> 37:14.320
every nobody wanted to talk about Wolfgang nobody wanted to hear about

37:14.320 --> 37:18.080
him oh that was you know he was involved in 2009 that was a

37:18.080 --> 37:22.400
little weird but they had some excuse but in reality

37:22.400 --> 37:27.360
2009 was a very small-scale version of what this was it was a test run

37:27.360 --> 37:33.120
it was absolutely a test run and it was a test run specifically in Europe

37:33.200 --> 37:37.200
and there's no other way to see it I don't think Wolfgang would argue with me

37:37.200 --> 37:41.760
if I would say it that way they definitely orchestrated a

37:41.760 --> 37:50.560
a by vaccine treaty agreement where if the who declares a pandemic then you

37:50.560 --> 37:53.840
agree to buy a certain number of vaccines and these

37:53.840 --> 37:58.080
vaccine manufacturers had gone from country to country

37:58.080 --> 38:02.160
showing other countries what other countries had ordered

38:02.160 --> 38:06.080
and claiming that you know our production level is

38:06.080 --> 38:10.080
is 20 million doses and so all these countries have ordered enough so

38:10.080 --> 38:14.000
there's not very much left and if you don't order enough before we go to

38:14.000 --> 38:16.960
Spain and these other countries there might not be a left for you

38:16.960 --> 38:20.480
and the agreement is is that when you buy these doses when the who says

38:20.480 --> 38:23.680
there's a pandemic it was really like they were they were

38:23.680 --> 38:28.240
kind of sort of coercing governments into

38:28.240 --> 38:32.080
committing to these orders under the pretense that if you don't

38:32.080 --> 38:36.480
then there won't be any vaccine for you when it's time

38:36.480 --> 38:39.840
and so listen to this reporter talking about how this was all

38:39.840 --> 38:46.480
orchestrated and how dirty the the dealings were with regards to it

38:46.960 --> 38:52.240
is that these vaccines have got a performance which is not very good

38:52.240 --> 38:57.280
and they work best in healthy adults i.e. those have got good immune systems in

38:57.280 --> 39:00.880
the first place and for which they usually are not recommended

39:00.880 --> 39:04.400
but you give one picture here of this flu not being so

39:04.400 --> 39:09.520
serious but the WHO gives another picture and they call it a pandemic

39:09.520 --> 39:13.760
what do you say about the calling this flu a pandemic

39:13.760 --> 39:17.280
well it's a good it's a good point i don't understand what a pandemic is

39:17.280 --> 39:20.960
anymore and the reason for that is as follows

39:20.960 --> 39:27.280
in w in 2003 WHO described a pandemic and influence a pandemic as follows

39:27.280 --> 39:31.520
an influence a pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus appears

39:31.520 --> 39:34.960
against which the human population has no immunity

39:34.960 --> 39:38.320
resulting in several simultaneous epidemics worldwide

39:38.320 --> 39:41.920
with enormous numbers of deaths and illness

39:41.920 --> 39:46.880
sometime in may 2009 this definition changed as follows

39:46.880 --> 39:51.040
an influenza pandemic may occur when any new influenza virus appears

39:51.040 --> 39:55.120
against which the human population has no immunity

39:55.120 --> 39:58.080
in other words what they've done is they've taken out

39:58.080 --> 40:01.840
the part that referred to simultaneous outbreaks

40:01.840 --> 40:05.600
high morbidity that's a very high number of

40:05.600 --> 40:10.800
severe cases and mortality so now this definition

40:10.800 --> 40:14.880
this 2009 definition could very well fit

40:14.880 --> 40:18.800
seasonal influenza so i don't understand what the difference is

40:18.800 --> 40:21.920
anymore but who is gaining this from this altered

40:21.920 --> 40:26.000
definition of the pandemic or the new definition

40:26.000 --> 40:29.840
lowers the threshold it makes a pandemic now

40:29.840 --> 40:33.280
and possibly pandemic going on for some time

40:33.280 --> 40:37.440
and it obviously favors those who have to sell products

40:37.440 --> 40:41.120
including research of course let's not forget

40:41.120 --> 40:47.920
and the media as well as the pharmaceutical industry

40:48.640 --> 40:52.800
so that's a long time ago and that's dead on ball

40:52.800 --> 40:58.080
accurate for what's happened this year or this last four years

40:58.080 --> 41:04.000
and we are in the fifth years and don't forget that four complete years of this

41:04.000 --> 41:08.560
and i'm still going to i'm going to rest on this

41:08.560 --> 41:14.400
until i figure it otherwise but i really do feel there are two primary

41:14.400 --> 41:19.680
kinds of actors now with regard to what's happening with t-morse case scenario

41:19.680 --> 41:24.640
the first are people like me who are unwittingly

41:24.640 --> 41:29.280
duped into believing that a gain of function virus likely leaked

41:29.280 --> 41:36.000
and therefore actively advocating for this narrative and and

41:36.000 --> 41:39.840
screaming from the rooftops about people covering it up

41:39.840 --> 41:43.360
and then there was another group of people

41:43.360 --> 41:48.960
uh who were kind of set in place to take particular stands on particular

41:48.960 --> 41:51.920
things and this has much more to do with where you're standing on the train and

41:51.920 --> 41:55.600
pretending to stop and start it these are people who are arguing about

41:55.600 --> 42:01.440
ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine these were people who were arguing about

42:01.440 --> 42:07.120
how AstraZeneca might be bad because of some reason that

42:07.120 --> 42:11.680
that mRNA might not be bad these are people who were arguing that mRNA

42:11.680 --> 42:15.600
from Moderna might be better than the mRNA from Pfizer and

42:15.600 --> 42:19.680
arguing about funny things that had really nothing to do with the fundamental

42:19.680 --> 42:25.760
narrative of the novel virus and these groups of of actors have moved

42:25.760 --> 42:29.840
through the pandemic slowly titrating along

42:29.840 --> 42:32.560
with where the scooby-doo should go first

42:32.560 --> 42:36.480
you know going along completely with the narrative for the first three or four

42:36.480 --> 42:39.920
weeks assuming that the worst case scenario could really be

42:39.920 --> 42:43.520
really really really bad and so

42:43.520 --> 42:48.480
Brett Weinstein of course was was completely sure that it was bushmeat

42:48.480 --> 42:53.440
and already referring to aids how aids came from bushmeat and this is probably

42:53.440 --> 42:57.440
from bushmeat and either way even if it's not from bushmeat we should

42:57.440 --> 43:02.480
end bushmeat anyway and of course we've been making fun of them for like

43:02.480 --> 43:06.000
three months now all on the internet and on twitter about

43:06.000 --> 43:10.880
his mask stance um and it's very curious because he did

43:10.880 --> 43:15.520
of course respond to more of this ridicule on his podcast a few days ago

43:15.520 --> 43:21.040
and his response was i i don't even know

43:21.040 --> 43:24.800
what words can you use to describe it when somebody says they're sorry but

43:24.800 --> 43:28.640
they're not sorry i mean that that's what he does

43:28.640 --> 43:33.520
all the time there is no i'm sorry i did it wrong there's no

43:33.520 --> 43:38.320
sorry i got it wrong there's no sorry i blew it

43:38.320 --> 43:43.440
and i can't stress enough how for at least

43:43.440 --> 43:47.360
i don't know at least a few months now and probably for more than a year i've

43:47.360 --> 43:54.720
been trying to come out and say i'm sorry i got it wrong

43:54.720 --> 43:58.240
and that doesn't make i don't want i'm not i don't know how

43:58.240 --> 44:02.560
who i am who can i be a gatekeeper with three thousand followers on twitch i'm

44:02.560 --> 44:08.240
happy for every one of the people that support and subscribe to my work

44:08.240 --> 44:13.040
but they are the people that know that at one point i was convinced that there

44:13.040 --> 44:17.680
was a lab leak virus that it that something happened

44:17.680 --> 44:23.120
but very very early on i became convinced that whatever happened

44:23.120 --> 44:29.280
it couldn't be this self-sustaining spontaneous danger

44:29.280 --> 44:34.480
that was just going to keep sweeping the globe and sneaking around forever

44:34.480 --> 44:39.200
and so i've been fighting this that to understand this to to to

44:39.200 --> 44:42.160
to figure it out and i think we're really close

44:42.160 --> 44:46.720
i think we're really close to making a very big leap forward that

44:46.720 --> 44:52.720
everybody who's legitimately fighting for our grandchildren can be proud of

44:52.880 --> 44:58.480
and that means sam and and and mark bailey

44:58.480 --> 45:02.960
it's possible that at one point we will be friends

45:02.960 --> 45:06.800
because i don't have any

45:06.880 --> 45:11.360
i don't have any critiques for the the farewell to virology document i'm

45:11.360 --> 45:15.040
i'm planning very much to incorporate

45:15.040 --> 45:20.960
that work into whatever i can try to add on to the work of those previous

45:20.960 --> 45:23.840
people and it's not mark bailey can take a lot of

45:23.840 --> 45:27.040
credit for that work but not all of it because there is

45:27.040 --> 45:32.720
decades of viral skeptics out there that have been putting their reputation

45:32.720 --> 45:38.560
in their family's life livelihoods on the line to speak out against HIV

45:38.560 --> 45:42.960
and that model of disease and all of the billions of dollars that have followed

45:42.960 --> 45:44.880
through there have been people that have been

45:44.880 --> 45:48.720
speaking out about cancer for just as long

45:48.720 --> 45:53.280
and so there is a lot of work to be done here that doesn't stop here with

45:53.280 --> 45:56.640
deciding who's on the dream team and then shifting to

45:56.640 --> 46:01.680
the invasion and talking about DNA and the shots

46:01.680 --> 46:06.640
we can't stop there we have a childhood vaccine schedule that needs to be

46:06.640 --> 46:13.280
completely demolished we have an opioid epidemic that's out of

46:13.280 --> 46:16.160
control we have schools that have been completely

46:16.160 --> 46:18.800
destroyed

46:19.280 --> 46:24.080
and we have a at least a few years of college

46:24.080 --> 46:29.360
age adults that really need an apology and a reorientation

46:29.360 --> 46:37.680
and a reorientation back into society because they have just been

46:37.680 --> 46:43.040
completely disoriented and removed from whatever

46:43.040 --> 46:48.080
they have no chance of contributing to this society under the current spell

46:48.080 --> 46:52.560
that they're under where they really believe what happened happened

46:52.560 --> 46:56.320
they can't possibly fight it and they can't possibly

46:56.320 --> 47:00.720
succeed in keeping their children out of that slavery so we've got it we've got

47:00.720 --> 47:04.000
to make some moves here this is the kind of stuff that

47:04.000 --> 47:08.960
passes for an apology or I guess I got it wrong but on the

47:08.960 --> 47:13.440
whole I didn't get it wrong that wrong or I don't know what he's saying here

47:13.440 --> 47:17.680
but I'll try and break it down a little bit as a start it's very very sloppy

47:17.680 --> 47:21.440
and I don't mean to take the last word here

47:21.440 --> 47:26.000
David Ike responded to me that what I said

47:26.000 --> 47:31.760
revealed that I'm a dummy you want to put that up he says mr. Weinstein

47:31.760 --> 47:36.000
so keep in mind already that here we have David Ike

47:36.000 --> 47:41.200
who actually also talks a little bit on twitter with

47:42.560 --> 47:47.440
the amazing poly is now having a conversation with

47:47.840 --> 47:52.480
Brett Weinstein and he's taken a pretty harsh stance on

47:52.480 --> 47:58.240
Brett's you know mealy-mouthed attempt to say that you know he got it pretty

47:58.240 --> 48:01.360
right I mean he was pretty good guy and overall

48:01.360 --> 48:06.880
is he's done pretty well and here's David Ike slapping him down

48:06.880 --> 48:12.880
and this is the response then that Brett and and Heather give and I don't

48:12.880 --> 48:16.160
I don't want to waste too much time with it but I need you to see that

48:16.160 --> 48:19.840
this is not directed toward me this is a giant number of

48:19.840 --> 48:24.320
of people on the internet who have who are just tired of

48:24.320 --> 48:30.400
of half measures and tired of this pseudo intellectual behavior that has

48:30.400 --> 48:34.560
nothing to do with intellectualism has nothing to do with teaching his

48:34.560 --> 48:38.480
his viewers anything and although I haven't

48:38.480 --> 48:42.960
necessarily gone out of my way to teach something in a in a few weeks

48:43.040 --> 48:47.200
um that that's going to change and nobody's

48:47.200 --> 48:51.360
nobody's going to be able to say very much about that in a few days so

48:51.360 --> 48:54.560
I'm not worried about that what I want you to see here right now

48:54.560 --> 48:58.320
and what I think is very important to notice here right now

48:58.320 --> 49:03.120
are the words that are used in how they do not contain an apology they do not

49:03.120 --> 49:07.520
contain an admission and they do not contain anything that remotely

49:07.520 --> 49:12.000
approaches the questioning of public health as a whole

49:12.000 --> 49:15.360
and public health as a whole if you're going to question it is the vaccine

49:15.360 --> 49:19.680
schedule let's just say it right out flat

49:19.680 --> 49:24.960
it is the vaccine schedule and one of the few places right now that's really

49:24.960 --> 49:27.600
questioning the vaccine schedule or few people is

49:27.600 --> 49:33.520
del big tree and I can and if you watch the right show and listen to the right

49:33.520 --> 49:37.280
person like like Brian Hooker then you're going to see

49:37.280 --> 49:40.800
that that that children's health defense is as well

49:40.800 --> 49:44.800
and Brett Weinstein's never going to get there so for all of the

49:44.800 --> 49:46.960
and here is where I'm finally getting to my point

49:46.960 --> 49:50.240
for all the revelation that he's had over the course of these three years to

49:50.240 --> 49:54.000
really come to understand how these things can be

49:54.000 --> 49:58.800
elusive or or you know this this complex systems work

49:58.800 --> 50:02.000
he hasn't gotten very far in his understanding at all

50:02.000 --> 50:04.880
he's only gotten as far as to understand that there are gain of

50:04.880 --> 50:10.720
function viruses and that pandemics are real and that lockdowns might work

50:11.200 --> 50:14.800
he hasn't gotten to the stage where they could lie about biology you know he's

50:14.800 --> 50:19.920
he's really not there yet and that's by design it's not possible

50:19.920 --> 50:24.160
for anyone it's not possible for anyone at this stage not to be

50:24.160 --> 50:27.840
to actually be awake you have to understand that the vaccine schedule

50:27.840 --> 50:34.240
is looney tunes that giving two shots to a newborn baby in the

50:34.240 --> 50:37.680
first few minutes that they've come out of their mama

50:37.680 --> 50:41.680
is looney tunes for them to have more than

50:41.680 --> 50:44.880
10 immunizations before they're six months old

50:44.880 --> 50:53.120
rather than having a number of some real resources involved in

50:53.120 --> 50:56.880
in raising the kid with proper nutrition and breastfeeding it's just

50:56.880 --> 51:01.840
ridiculous so listen carefully this is the

51:01.840 --> 51:05.360
apology i think if i've ever read confirmation that you have

51:05.360 --> 51:09.520
no idea how it all works then this is it so thanks for that

51:09.520 --> 51:13.360
i have been researching this full climb for 34 years and i don't need to be

51:13.360 --> 51:16.160
told how things operate by someone who bought

51:16.160 --> 51:21.760
covid lockstock and the other thing and the other thing

51:21.760 --> 51:26.160
and explained during the fake pandemic how he wore a scarf around his neck at

51:26.160 --> 51:31.120
home so he could pull it over his face when he answered the door i

51:31.440 --> 51:35.280
called covid for what it was a hoax from the start

51:35.280 --> 51:38.880
of 2020 because i had spent 30 years researching the cabal

51:38.880 --> 51:42.400
and its methods for operation you bought it because you hadn't

51:42.400 --> 51:48.080
that clearly still applies now i would point out a couple things here

51:48.080 --> 51:52.800
this mask thing yep i was wrong masks were not useful against covid

51:52.800 --> 51:56.320
not significantly was i a fool to think they might be

51:56.320 --> 51:59.920
no until we knew that there was no fomite transmission

51:59.920 --> 52:02.880
then there was a decent chance that masks would

52:02.880 --> 52:06.240
at least have some value because they would keep droplets that contain the

52:06.240 --> 52:09.200
virus from hitting a surface from getting to that surface in some

52:09.200 --> 52:12.080
percentage of the instances and that would result in a

52:12.080 --> 52:15.600
somewhat fewer instances of infection so do i feel

52:15.600 --> 52:18.640
like a terrible person

52:22.400 --> 52:26.240
i want you to see how significant that is

52:26.240 --> 52:30.880
he's actually saying that masks do work but it's not significant in the

52:30.880 --> 52:36.240
measurement of it they do prevent infection

52:36.240 --> 52:40.080
he actually used the word fomite

52:41.120 --> 52:46.560
which is a which is a term that was being thrown around in 2020 to make it

52:46.560 --> 52:52.080
seem as though the discussion of aerosolized droplets or droplets or

52:52.080 --> 52:58.480
fomites or a word for things on a surface

52:58.480 --> 53:04.240
made this discussion seem more real it made the enchantment more real

53:04.240 --> 53:07.520
because there were term and not there's terminology to learn what's a fomite

53:07.520 --> 53:10.720
whoa you sound smart

53:11.520 --> 53:18.240
masks can't work on something the size of what they say a virus is sized

53:19.040 --> 53:22.800
we know that we know that we knew that from the

53:22.800 --> 53:25.680
beginning the people that understood it were using this

53:25.680 --> 53:33.200
tennis ball and and and uh or chain link fence and sand thing

53:34.160 --> 53:38.000
and so it's really crazy right because what's he missing here what's he

53:38.000 --> 53:41.920
missing here what are you missing Brett

53:42.880 --> 53:48.640
it's not about the transmission of a virus masks were not about the

53:48.640 --> 53:54.480
transmission of a virus in the end because you you had to really be

53:54.480 --> 54:00.720
really really naive to think that a mask made of a bandana was going to

54:00.720 --> 54:05.360
usefully stop a highly transmissible the most

54:05.360 --> 54:11.520
transmissible virus in the history of mankind as some people described it

54:11.520 --> 54:15.600
because of its fear and cleavage site

54:15.840 --> 54:20.880
was going to be stopped by a bandana but more importantly this evolutionary

54:20.880 --> 54:27.440
biologist this super genius with this unique insight into everything because

54:27.440 --> 54:33.760
he sees it from an evolutionary angle didn't think about masking children

54:33.760 --> 54:40.240
for a couple years didn't think about the impression that it would make

54:40.240 --> 54:44.720
for adults to not really be able to rationalize and explain why we were

54:44.720 --> 54:50.480
taking all these drastic measures but just trusting authority

54:50.480 --> 54:55.040
he didn't think about what the effect it would have on high school kids

54:55.040 --> 54:59.360
and their psychology with one another with their teachers with their parents

54:59.360 --> 55:03.920
all of whom can't explain why everybody's lost their mind

55:03.920 --> 55:09.440
there's not one inkling of understanding here of the bigger picture

55:09.440 --> 55:14.880
from the granddaddy evolutionary biologist man

55:14.880 --> 55:19.120
who's been so curious about so many things his whole life

55:19.120 --> 55:23.280
can barely stand how smart he is

55:23.360 --> 55:26.560
and yet for him right now masks are only about well

55:26.560 --> 55:30.720
they weren't significant the p-values weren't as quite as high

55:30.720 --> 55:33.360
as they should have been otherwise i would have been right

55:33.360 --> 55:37.280
so was i dumb for thinking that the p-values might be high enough for

55:37.280 --> 55:42.480
masks to be considered working no i wasn't dumb

55:42.480 --> 55:48.720
because the p-values weren't out there yet as soon as the p-values came out

55:48.720 --> 55:52.160
then i changed my mind

55:52.640 --> 55:57.600
and so this super genius didn't think about children didn't think about

55:57.600 --> 56:01.440
communication didn't think about socializing didn't think about

56:01.440 --> 56:04.480
submission didn't think about depression didn't think about

56:04.480 --> 56:11.360
contact didn't think about fear didn't think about the psychology of it at all

56:16.000 --> 56:20.640
and he's still not right now this is from a day ago

56:20.640 --> 56:26.240
and so after all this time to conceive about why it is he might want to apologize

56:26.240 --> 56:30.480
for some of the things he did which is also advocate for hard lockdowns

56:30.480 --> 56:34.240
which he's not even going to admit here

56:35.840 --> 56:40.320
but he doesn't even understand the damage that we are talking about when we said

56:40.320 --> 56:45.120
don't mask children don't mask people

56:46.880 --> 56:50.960
you want to scare some people into masking themselves that's fine but once you

56:50.960 --> 56:53.680
start going down to the children or telling

56:53.680 --> 56:56.720
healthy people that they need to cover their faces

56:56.720 --> 56:59.760
we were doing something wrong and he didn't understand it

57:01.360 --> 57:05.200
he did not understand it

57:06.400 --> 57:10.640
and apparently if you listen carefully he still doesn't understand it because he

57:10.640 --> 57:14.640
doesn't understand the teenagers were damaged because

57:14.640 --> 57:20.640
adults didn't understand he doesn't he doesn't get it

57:20.640 --> 57:25.360
that children look to their parents for explanations for what's going on

57:27.040 --> 57:31.040
and by design this system didn't give those parents any explanation

57:32.320 --> 57:36.480
didn't give those teachers any explanation didn't give those school boards any

57:36.480 --> 57:38.240
explanation other than a legal one

57:40.400 --> 57:41.600
do it because you're told

57:42.080 --> 57:52.880
and rather than help us make hard choices rather than exhibiting

57:52.880 --> 57:58.880
principles during an emergency this guy demonstrated how to put a mask on

57:58.880 --> 58:01.040
and use use his goggles

58:04.560 --> 58:07.840
i would show that video but it's just not worth it this one is much better

58:07.840 --> 58:11.200
because this one is from right now and he's making the same fool of himself

58:11.680 --> 58:16.400
right now right here right now he does the same thing it's extraordinary

58:16.400 --> 58:20.800
and its methods for operation you bought it because you hadn't that clearly still

58:20.800 --> 58:23.840
applies now i would point out a couple things here

58:25.600 --> 58:30.480
this mask thing yep i was wrong masks were not useful against covid not

58:30.480 --> 58:33.840
significantly was i a fool to think they might be

58:33.840 --> 58:37.440
no until we knew that there was no fomite transmission

58:37.520 --> 58:40.480
then there was a decent chance that masks would

58:40.480 --> 58:43.760
at least have some value because they would keep droplets that contain the

58:43.760 --> 58:46.800
virus from hitting a surface from getting to that surface in some

58:46.800 --> 58:49.600
percentage of the instances and that would result in a

58:49.600 --> 58:53.200
somewhat fewer instances of infection so do i feel

58:53.200 --> 58:59.040
like a terrible person for advocating for masks no was i wrong yes

58:59.040 --> 59:04.080
um what are we to think about this as an indication of the quality of my

59:04.160 --> 59:07.600
thinking i don't know that i'm a fallible person who

59:07.600 --> 59:11.920
worked from a data set that was heavily polluted and became smarter over time

59:11.920 --> 59:15.600
and i'm comfortable with that final thing i will say about it

59:15.600 --> 59:21.920
is i am perfectly happy with you evaluating my record on covid

59:21.920 --> 59:27.040
warts and all but the way you'd wrong yes that was really amazing listen

59:27.040 --> 59:30.400
what are we to think about this as an indication of the quality of my

59:30.400 --> 59:33.840
thinking i don't know that i'm a fallible person who

59:33.840 --> 59:38.160
worked from a data set that was heavily polluted and became smarter over time

59:38.160 --> 59:41.920
and i'm comfortable with that final thing i will say about it

59:41.920 --> 59:45.600
is i am perfectly happy that's great

59:45.600 --> 59:50.640
evaluating my record on covid warts and all but the way you do that

59:50.640 --> 59:54.160
the rigorous way to do that is to think of it as a question of

59:54.160 --> 59:58.160
area under the curve so my advocacy of masks and my

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.480
advocacy of masks i don't know what i said about

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.480
about mandating masks i know that i advocated for masks because

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.480
it seemed a low cost and likely to do some good

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.360
and that i at the point the evidence that it didn't stop digging

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.680
i handed it i was always uh stop digging appalled by the idea of

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.280
using them outdoors etc so he was always appalled by the

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.480
idea of using them outdoors sorry i missed that

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.600
i didn't mean that i wanted to pause it i didn't think it would do that way

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:34.080
sorry one and you know this is our bias but we think it is the right one

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.640
right the point is the net effect that we had on covid

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.280
was distinctly positive and if you want to do that net analysis great if you

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.160
want to pick one thing and harp on it endlessly

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.920
then that's your sloppy thinking and it's not our response

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.240
okay so i'm going to explain my sloppy thinking for brat

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.560
just so he gets it and i'm gonna do it once i know that lots of other people

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.800
have decided not to talk about brat anymore and i think that's a

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.320
valiant uh effort but i had a lot of interaction with brat

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.520
over a year or so on signal and at one point i thought we were going to be

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.320
friends and so i'm still a little hurt and so i'm

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.800
gonna still talk about brat anyway the point is is that what he's

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:30.080
missing is excruciatingly painful it really is

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.920
because in 2020 let me say it very clearly

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.200
in 2020 we had the chance to save everyone from

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.320
transfection we could have saved everyone brat

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.480
not just a few people but everyone every college student

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.320
was untranspected in 2020 we could have saved them all brat

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.520
we could have saved them all we could have stopped all the colleges from

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.560
doing any testing at all we could have saved them all we could have

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.480
advocated for everybody to just stay home

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.560
i couldn't have done it but you could have

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.080
we definitely could have stopped them from taking the shots we definitely

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.720
could have stopped every young adult from taking the

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.680
shots but we didn't

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:32.880
i tried you didn't you didn't do anything to stop people

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:39.920
from taking the shot in 2020 nothing in fact your

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:45.280
advocation for masks fueled the narrative that something was circulating

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.480
that everybody needed to protect themselves from

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.800
don't you understand that and that extended fear

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.640
uncertainty and doubt is what led thousands of americans to rush

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.920
to get transfected

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.040
so the net positive you're talking about i don't i don't get the math that you're

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.160
doing unless you're really ignoring a certain

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.360
time period where apparently nobody's guilty

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.200
doesn't matter if you were looking for novel

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.600
uh drug combinations using a ai program or whether you were working on

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.440
doing novel treatment funding or whether you are advocating for masks

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.880
you were always you all of those people would be extending the narrative of

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.760
worst-case scenario because there's a novel virus we've got a panic we've got

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.880
a search for new solutions we need new we need new

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.400
understandings we need to have new immunology we need to find out what this

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.800
new biology is you because of your masks uh Steve Kirsch because of his

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.680
funding novel treatments and Robert Malone because he's running around

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.000
in the backyard in the back background getting volunteers to help him make a

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.880
computer model of the three cl protease so that he can interface it with

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.400
all known drugs and pharmaceuticals to find

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:24.160
uh computer predicted inhibitors of that that enzyme

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.400
and every one of those narratives every one of those stories involves a person

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.960
that running around excited motivating other people and getting other people

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.720
excited about a novel virus that's killing millions of people but

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.240
millions more could be saved from if we just find out the way

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.760
and that's not a story that i was telling my story was that natural immunity was

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.760
going to be much better that natural immunity would be the way to go

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.760
and that transfection was going to be no way to help people that wanted to live

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.480
a long healthy life i was afraid i admit to say that it might not might be

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.080
okay for old people and they've already taken it so whatever but don't give it

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.440
to young people natural immunity would be better we've

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.000
been exposed to this stuff before that's what i was saying

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.640
while he was saying masks while he was saying lockdowns

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:27.680
people like me people like Ryan Cole people like like Peter McCullough

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.320
people like

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:37.440
Wolfgang Wodach and Michael Yeden were all saying whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:44.000
and not him not him he was saying whoa whoa give me my mask where is it

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.280
hold on a minute i got that's a very different thing

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.560
that is gigantically different and only only only if you allow people

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.600
to erase and forget what they did in 2020 or did not do

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:05.440
in 2020 said or did not say in 2020 and 2021

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.880
will we have this problem

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.400
and these people that stepped in front and are now at the front or insisting

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:23.600
that they should be at the front because they invented something

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:31.760
or because they were ahead of something and they didn't do it in 2020 i'm sorry

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.960
but no no because then you've got to defer to

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.080
Wolfgang Wodach, Michael Yeden, Thomas Binder,

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:49.520
Sucred Bakti, you've got to defer to the people like Knutwitskowski

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.560
you got to defer to the people like Peter McCullough

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.120
because if you were running around in 2020 looking for novel treatments for

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.480
the disease if you were running around writing books about

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.680
about how to survive the covid virus

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.920
then you were perpetuating the worst case scenario narrative

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.880
and you weren't trying to save people from going limp and surrendering to the

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.960
public health narrative that's what i was trying to stop

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.240
i was marching around in the woods saying that ladies and gentlemen this

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.960
public health narrative is only the beginning

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.640
these weaponized piles of money are going to use this narrative to put us in a

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.520
jail that's what i was saying while he was talking about masks

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.040
and lockdowns and bush meat and ivermectin being well i don't know it

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.280
might be very surprising to some people but ivermectin is apparently 100%

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.360
effective prophylactically against covid

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.240
oh there's a tea here it's probably not even warm anymore

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:05.520
ships i blew that one darn it that's why my voice is breaking down i didn't

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.240
start my tea

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.200
i'm not getting done with this video darn it i thought i would be off this

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.440
already this is gonna get a lot worse don't i

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.040
well i think um i mean i hadn't seen this interchange before

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.400
here we go and i don't i i recognize the name but i don't i don't really know

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.280
who he is um but going from what he claims about what his

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.600
work has been um i'm reminded of this gonna sound like a

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.240
total month's accurate first but i'm reminded of myself as a young person

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.600
uh going into college i wanted to be a writer that's what i wanted to do

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.600
and i'm very quickly realized in my literature and writing

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.640
courses and i was also taking science because i specifically wanted to be a

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.680
science fiction writer but i wanted to be a writer i

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.800
quickly realized especially in the creative writing classes that

01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.960
um all the turns of phrase and grammatical skill in the world

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.680
doesn't give you anything to write about and so you know writing is a tool and

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.040
it's can be an art form um but it's not sufficient you need to

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.360
actually know something and so i think i feel the same way and again i don't i

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.040
don't know what it is that he claims to have exactly you know how it is that he

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.520
frames what he is what he does but people who

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:27.840
um she's not sure who david aik is so she's not aware of his 30 years of

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.440
writing books about how the lizard people are taking over

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.000
he's not aware of the freemasons and the

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.080
illuminati and all the other stuff that david aik talks about it's it's almost

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.800
comical can you imagine can you imagine

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.920
how ridiculous it is that they're making a podcast right now and pretending

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.880
that they're kind of shooting off the cuff

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.120
the david aik i'm just responding to david aik right now off the cuff i don't know

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.320
who he is or what he talks about what a joke

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.880
this is

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.720
how stupid do they think we are

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.840
i don't even know what to say i i'm but i'm gonna watch because i'm sure i'm

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.560
gonna come up with something to say

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.040
wow just wow i don't know what to say but wow

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.360
you know whose whose job they understand themselves to be to you know figure

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.240
out where everyone else is getting it wrong

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.480
feels a little bit like that like you know what that's not actually

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.640
either a particularly honorable but more to the point um truth seeking

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.000
position and uh and here is where you and i landed on one

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.600
and you know this is our bias but we think it is the right one

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.320
that evolutionary biologists here we go train

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:05.520
uh in the complexity of the world where uh the things that seem totally

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.400
an obvious and turn out to be true there's

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.160
just no question it's a social phenomenon you're going to have to reconcile

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.200
well like she said this and he said that's like no

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.800
it's in front of you the forest is what the forest is the reef is what the reef

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.360
is the bats the front whatever it is and

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.040
the seams impossible i cannot reconcile this

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.480
so it's really funny because what the argument i think she's trying to say is

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.360
that evolutionary biologists have some kind of special skill or superpower

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.760
that allows them to see connections and explanations

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.520
that nobody else can see and i think this reveals again

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.360
what i've been trying to explain over the last

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.040
many many years and more importantly over the last few months

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.680
is what academic biology does to people who don't successfully

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.120
extricate themselves from their system and i think what you just said in the

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.120
chat is absolutely true they still talk like classroom professors

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.840
because they haven't actually extricated from themselves from that system

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.440
they are still thinking of themselves has completely worthy of and actually

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.840
still performing the role of college professor

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.920
just doing it from an independent role from an independent podcast

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.920
but they still think of themselves as college professors

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.480
they still think of themselves as people who are lecturing

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.160
who are standing in front of a classroom and therefore need to conduct

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.760
themselves with a certain level of decorum and in a certain level of

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.800
sophistication with a certain level of code words

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.040
and proper combinations of them and so that is the difference between me

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.000
and them i am a father of three i i am lucky enough to be married to my

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.960
best friend and i am somebody who struggled very

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.640
hard to get on that ladder of tenure track professor

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.400
in an academic setting and in the course of doing that

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.760
saw a lot of the shortcomings of academics from the inside

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.960
and the people that are still in academia will definitely tell you that

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.800
what that is is me making excuses for my failure

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:25.200
but i see it from my perspective as i deal with it as a way of understanding

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.760
how i never fit in how my way of seeing the world

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.880
was not compatible with the way that you needed to see

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:39.200
and question the world in academia and her portrayal

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.440
of evolutionary biologists of having a superpower or having some kind of

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.680
secret that other people don't have is exactly the kind of bullshit

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.480
that every academic professor biologist engages in and they say

01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.320
and they start with the words my lab studies the question of

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.560
or my lab looks apt or the specialty of my lab is

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.240
the question that i ask for which no one else has an answer because no one else

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.520
is asking it is evolutionary biology

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.840
and so you can't argue with me because i bring to the table this very unique

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.400
perspective that is very different from yours

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.960
and the conclusions that i come to are superior obviously that's a bias but

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.720
that's what we think those are the exact words she used

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.080
and so rather than becoming a well-rounded biologist that can also

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.440
wax intellectual about the pattern integrity of the

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.280
immune system or the pattern integrity of the digestive tract

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.440
or the pattern integrity of protein expression around the body

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.040
she keeps herself an evolutionary biologist everything

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.600
that she thinks of has to be from the angle of evolutionary biology and

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.840
therefore she can't tell you the whole story she can't tell you the whole

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.880
show she's never going to jump out of that and say wow

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.200
how does evolutionary biology explain the fact we didn't have vaccines before

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.880
like 1950

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:37.600
how does evolutionary biology explain the the role of sewer and water

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.280
treatment and water purification in disease

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.960
you see this is where their whole stick just kind of falls apart

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.440
because as they try to masquerade as evolutionary

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.080
biologists that are also ecologists and all this other stuff

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.800
they fail miserably at applying the very basic principles of

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.480
biological and scientific investigation to any of the questions that they ask

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.760
because they make these gigantic assumptions about their toolbox

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.960
and about how their toolbox is so appropriate and so unique

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.160
that it doesn't matter what the the problem is they bring their

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.360
evolutionary toolbox and lo and behold look

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.560
Brett's got the answer because he's an evolutionary dude

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.080
listen the the argument's going to get better

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.680
what am i not seeing like it at the end of the day when you have one of those

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.800
and it's nature and you're an evolutionary biologist

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.800
you have to keep digging what don't i know what did i get wrong which of my

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.320
assumptions is flawed where like where is the error

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.360
in my understanding of the universe because the fact is the universe is

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.640
doing this thing it doesn't make sense according to the model i've got

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.440
therefore and so at that this this iterative process is unique to

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.720
evolutionary biologists what a weird claim that is to make

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.800
what a what an absolutely ridiculous claim it is to make but of course it's

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.040
coming from someone who has a publication record that's

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.560
is it a paper long is it two papers long how many

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:20.640
how many actual biological studies that have come from a hypothesis

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.520
to an experiment to analysis and conclusion has she done

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.640
i don't know my guess is less than me

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.640
my guess is the same for Brett it's much less than me

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.160
and although all of mine are in one basic field

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.200
all of mine have a hypothesis a set of experiments

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.200
that are repeatable and involve measurements in a control group and an

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.440
experimental group and a hypothesis that made predictions

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.480
based on what those measurements might be or not be

01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.720
a null hypothesis the whole thing a couple of those papers even involved

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.840
quantitative pcr some of those other papers even

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.240
involved transfection of live animals and the expression of foreign proteins

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.400
in their brain and they got published in in in

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.240
papers like nature neuroscience

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.960
and actually i'm a co-author on a science article i mean

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.080
what have they done to talk so arrogantly about how the iterative

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.680
process of scientific questioning and and investigation is done what have they

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.160
done yet listen to the arrogance with which they talk about their

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.680
purported net positive if you just look the area under the curve the net positive

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.400
contribution to covid are you kidding me

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.680
it's extraordinary because these are these are the people that are getting

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.600
that that we need to get over that people need to get over and need to see

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.800
through that's why that we need to do this you don't like it

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.720
it's not a legitimate way of investigating listen to why it's a

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.240
legitimate way of investigating are you ready

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.960
are you ready

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.160
Robert Malone and everyone who's involved in this has been telling us

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.400
for years that this is fifth generation warfare

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.040
they have been telling us for years that we are being attacked

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.480
well i hate to break it to you but if we are being attacked we are being

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.840
attacked by liars we are being attacked by being misled

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.360
we are being attacked by misinformation and so we need to find the people who

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.760
are doing

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.640
we need to find the people who are doing it wittingly and unwittingly

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.200
and i don't need any allies i don't need any friends

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.320
giga ohm biological can remain a hundred percent

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:02.320
independent on the intellectual intellectual

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:09.680
indecipherable infotigable bright web we don't need any allies in this fight

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.200
all we need to do is be fighting for the same thing

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.640
and if Brett was fighting for our grandchildren he would be fighting in a

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:22.000
very different way than he is he's fighting for his grandchildren

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:28.320
in fact i feel like he's fighting for his family right now

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.920
not our families not all of our collective families and not

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.200
our grandchildren he's not looking to plant trees under whose shade he will

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.000
never shelter

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.800
he's looking to upgrade his backyard right now

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.000
and i'd love to do it too

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.120
but we have a problem to solve we need to figure out this this problem of

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.960
vaccines we need to figure out this problem of viruses

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.640
we need to figure out this problem of

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.560
transfection and gene transfection and and

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.760
we need to figure out all of this stuff and we need to understand it now

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.440
this work is not done it has just begun we have just

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.360
accepted the fact that this work needs to be done and they are not accepting

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.000
these people are actually making sure that we never actually accept the

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.240
challenge of looking at the vaccine schedule

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.520
these people are making sure that we never accept the challenge

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.520
of looking at what Mark Bailey and Sam Bailey wrote in

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.840
in in farewell to virology they are making sure that we never look at

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.920
Stefan Lanka's work we never look at at at do'sburg again

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.240
we never think about the illusion of viruses that was started back

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.600
with the AIDS epidemic we're not going to ever get there

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.640
with these people

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.560
Robert Malone will never take us back to question what really happened with

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.360
HIV Robert Malone will never take us there

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.600
Brett Weinstein will never take us there

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.960
a lot of these people in the intellectual know all of these people

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.480
will not take us there that's what you need to see

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.280
they will not take us there

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.160
beef is what the reef is the bats the frog whatever it is

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.760
and the seams impossible I cannot reconcile this

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.360
what am I not seeing like it at the end of the day when you have one of those

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.560
and it's nature and you're an evolutionary biologist

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.480
you have to keep digging what don't I know what did I get wrong which of my

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.560
assumptions is flawed where like where is the error in my

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.520
understanding of the universe because the fact is the universe is doing this

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.400
thing it doesn't make sense according to the model I've got

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.880
therefore I know that I need to keep looking

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.120
I need to keep digging that is the training that you had

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.960
and that I have had and that is how we approach everything even when it seems

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.600
to most people like what you know what's evolutionary biology got to do with it

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.200
well everything almost always you know that's it's unless it's rocks or

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.640
quasars it's evolutionary and it is that training that you know

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.360
you know you were thinking about and so now think about how handicapping

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:17.760
that is if you think that the idea of evolution

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.880
and their idea of evolution is not as sophisticated as it needs to be I

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.680
assure you of that it is not for example

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:37.120
it is not for example sophisticated enough to have any of this book in it

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.480
bio communication and natural genome editing

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.680
is not going to have anything to do with viruses essential agents of life

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.600
which basically are huge collection of scientific papers

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:57.760
in bound form that show that viruses are actually

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:06.320
integral to the evolutionary process because it is endogenous and exogenous

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.080
viruses that are responsible for the sorting and reassorting and movement

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:16.640
of this genetic material that Darwin attributed to random mutation

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.760
it's not random mutation it's endogenous viruses and exogenous

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.560
viruses and it's it's genetic signals whatever they are I don't know if

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.320
they're viruses this book calls them viruses

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.720
but there are there are genetic signals which are packaged inside of

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.320
exosomes extracellular vesicles whatever you want to call them

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.720
and these signals these these things are are

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.440
integral in the in the assortment of our genetic

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:56.160
information during gamete selection etc and they know this they know this from

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.240
other animals they know it from other organisms they know it from studying

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.920
protozoan and and and zooplankton in in the ocean they know all this stuff

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.840
already but apparently these evolutionary biologists are

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.880
relatively naive to these mechanisms by which

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.200
the very foundation of their biology

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.640
works there is no evolution without these

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.120
endogenous retroviruses there's no evolution at all

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.960
there's no crossing over of genes like so what are what are they

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.640
what are they really talking about here then

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:39.920
it's extraordinary it's an act it's a it's a pantomime

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.160
it's just it's it's just frustrating because

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.680
and i'm going to be here forever i'm going to be here all by myself forever

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.000
because i'm not going to i'm not going to play this game of

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.640
of allowing this to go on i'm never going to be on breath show it's never

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.960
going we're never going to be buddies because

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.040
he he talked to me for a year in a signal chat

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.880
where we talked about this biology for a year and this is where they are

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.640
in complete denial that if they wanted to they could have known

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.600
all of this in 2021 all of it

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.120
and they could be saying it all right now they could have been using

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.480
transfection as a word every day and they could have saved

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.720
hundreds of thousands of people from taking a vaccine that should have been

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.640
called a transfection from the very beginning

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.080
but instead just one time on tucker's show

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.000
he kind of waxed intellectual about how wouldn't have been interesting if we

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.360
would have just called it a transfection from the very beginning

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:53.440
like that guy jay cooey wanted me to do since 2021

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.600
no there's there's not this is not a game anymore

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.600
some mistakes are unless they are apologize for and admitted they are

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.200
they're inexcusable and this mealy mouth attempt to try and make it

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.400
about masks when it was also about lockdowns it was also

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.040
about natural immunity and it was also about

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.280
the immune response in general not being about antibodies it was also about

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.120
a hundred other things that they got wrong and perpetuated the questioning

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:31.360
of the wrong questioning of instead of clarifying what the real biological

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.920
facts were before the pandemic and how they still were relevant now

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.440
they perpetuated the novelty and the mystery of it all

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:49.760
rather than the likely non mystery and non novelty of it all

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.480
they did very very very very big damage

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.080
and they did it because they were given a platform

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.960
it's not because on his eighth podcast with Sam Harris that three hours was

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:09.120
just so compelling that his his viewership skyrocketed

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.680
go look at that at what happened with his patreon support over the course of

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.760
the pandemic and you'll see exactly what's going on

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.600
he was elevated to a certain level and then boom came Robert Malone

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.560
and his income quadrupled and that lasted for a little while

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.960
and that's slowly been going right back down to baseline ever since and that's

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.320
why they're in panic mode right now they're trying to

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.000
get back to what they imagined they would be able to sustain

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.040
those few months after Robert Malone I was on

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:47.840
and they were able to get lots of of spontaneous support and everybody was

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.760
feeling bad because we lost our youtube channel

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.280
and they demonetized our youtube channel we need your help

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.480
this is all by design ladies and gentlemen he might not know it he might

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.480
be an unwitting participant it's possible but given who his father is

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:15.360
it's highly unlikely highly unlikely given who his brother is

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:22.320
it's highly unlikely given that when we were in that signal

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.960
chat together he said that he was basically the biological advisor of

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:33.200
of Joe Rogan I would say it's highly unlikely

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.120
that he's an unwitting participant I'm gonna play the rest of this because I'm

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.400
pretty sure I didn't record it for nothing it's only I have left

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:47.760
conclusion and conspiracy a lot for decades before before covid

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:55.200
but you were also thinking about rainforests and the you know the

01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:00.240
patterns of biodiversity on the planet and the evolution of morality

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.640
and the evolution of senescence and cancer and all of these other

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:09.440
extraordinarily complex systems which you know every single one of those

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.720
you had to apply a similar toolkit in its you know in its generality

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.560
but the precise things were very different and so when you start applying

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.680
that to an understanding of political systems and you know how

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:30.000
I can definitely see why Brett married Heather because I have never heard a

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.360
wife blow so much sunshine that's really extraordinary

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.480
sloppy holy and the evolution of morality and the

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.560
evolution of senescence and cancer and all of these other

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.200
extraordinarily complex systems which you know every single one my husband

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.200
can understand so many extraordinarily complex systems

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.080
he's like a cue from from the next generation of Star Trek

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:03.840
he is the smartest guy I know holy cow I mean that that's impressive

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.840
I that's it's like a valentine's day video here holy cow

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:15.600
with those you had to apply a similar toolkit in its you know in its

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.800
generality but the precise things were very different

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.800
and so when you start applying that to an understanding of political systems

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:29.680
and you know how how an NIH might be in collusion

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:36.160
with the CCP okay didn't do that one but here are all the tools that we

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.000
bring to bear on this let's the NIH is in conclusion

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.040
collusion with the CCP well that's interesting I didn't know that that

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.720
was their running hypothesis that that's an interesting thing to drop there

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.760
wow let's go so you know we're we're you and I

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.040
later to be thinking about Wuhan and the CCP then those who were focused on the

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.240
CCP for years in advance sure and like you're always going to be

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.120
later than someone there's one person who's first

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.400
and this it feels you know what it feels like this feels like an

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.960
analogous argument to cultural appropriation

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.960
you know if you if you weren't the person who invented it then you have

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.040
no business here well come on guys like enough already this is

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.520
ridiculous it is ridiculous and I would exactly

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.880
along the lines that you are arguing it's called it's it's a parallel to

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.520
cultural appropriation to say that you didn't have

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:46.080
principles for a year and a half and we're just calling you out on it

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.560
that you damaged college kids because you didn't know better

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:54.560
because you terrified college kids into going back to campus and taking

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:58.640
tests until they could get the vaccine and then taking the vaccine so they

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:03.280
didn't have to take tests anymore you are part of the reason why they

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.240
didn't have the courage to resist you are part of the reason they didn't

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:12.560
read my review you are the part of the reason why

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.840
the college kids are still damaged and still

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.640
lost because you won't admit

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.000
therefore their college professors don't have to admit they don't have to

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.360
admit none of them have to admit that they were taken because Brett Weinstein

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.360
wasn't taken we were all confused the information

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:38.320
data space was contaminated or it was very dirty or it was cloudy

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:45.520
boy what a wife she is I mean really that was spectacular

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.200
you almost have to believe that she's unwittingly doing that because that

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:56.000
there's no way I mean wow wow

01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.320
maybe they were fooled by Eric you know maybe the whole intellectual dark web

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.480
was just taken by Eric and Rogan or something maybe

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.120
maybe Jordan Peterson hypnotized all of them I don't know

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.280
I just I can't believe it I can't believe it because it's just so easy

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.520
it's just so easy to say wow we were taken

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.040
wow we were taken it's not about getting it it's about getting taken

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.320
and about not being where you were supposed to be because you claimed to be

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.920
a biologist you claimed that you were going to do an immunology lecture

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.200
soon and never did it you said that in March of 2020

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.240
and never did it why didn't you do it because part of the narrative was

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.960
antibodies are the the the primary indication of immunity and that

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.120
couldn't be questioned because that was also part of the narrative that needed

01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:01.840
protecting so you argued about other stuff like the lab leak like I did

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.880
you argued about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.040
even more so which is a very curious one to have chosen

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.200
you helped bring Pierre Cori on to the scene and make him

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.240
widely known you brought Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone on to the scene

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.680
which is also very curious

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.000
and you gained a lot of a lot of financial support during that time as

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.400
well your your patreon support quadrupled or tripled during that time

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.560
and somehow or another you haven't been able to parlay that into a

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.520
consistent following and i think that's because

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.640
this is an illusion

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.880
it has become obvious that you're playing some role

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:55.680
other than other than out of work biologist and crusader for the sacred

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.960
which is definitely not what either of these people are

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.360
and they will mimic that sometimes they will mind that sometimes but

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.840
they are not the biologist you're looking for they're really not

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.080
and they're not even the storytellers you're looking for

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.560
and unfortunately we are having them shoved down our throat right now by the

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:22.640
people that are handling this because they're using tucker Carlson to do it

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.640
and that's not a small spoon that's force feeding

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.480
hundreds of thousands if not millions of people Brett Weinstein

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:36.160
as a legitimate dissident and so it is worth complaining about

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.080
because he's not a legitimate dissident

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.880
and and i'm i am absolutely sure that he's not a legitimate dissident i don't

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.200
know how much he's on the take or not on the take

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.400
but whatever he's doing he's doing it to be invited back to barbecues that you

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.440
and i are never going to be invited to

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:04.000
he's doing whatever he's doing to get himself farther in the social

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.400
economic hierarchy that he believes he's climbing within

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.480
the joe rogan is in that these other people are in

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.280
he would love to have a two hundred and fifty million dollar

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.200
contract with spotify but of course he doesn't but he would love to have that

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.160
and i believe that that might even be their goal

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.080
and that maybe the system will give it to them

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.080
and i wouldn't be very surprised if it did

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.120
is this over no wow what am i doing here this is like

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.600
an hour and 35 minutes is supposed to be 10 minutes of the tool kit

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.840
right is actually the strength and it may be if you want to just say hey

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.320
i was the first person to spot that they were lying because i knew where they

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.360
were lying for years before they started lying you know if you want to do

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.960
that then well okay how operationalizable is that

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.280
right how much good did you actually do right all you've done is

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.040
preserve your ability to claim and you're killing us like you can do that thing

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.640
forever right along that but did you did you have a mechanism whereby

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:16.080
uh mrna shots cause myocarditis did you spot that that is actually going to be

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.440
true for anything you load into that platform has nothing to do with spike

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.960
oh but that what he said right there what he said right there

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.240
that that did you have a mechanism by which that would

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.680
load that anything you loaded into that platform could cause that that's me

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.600
i taught him that i argued with him about that for like four months on

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.680
signal before he finally admitted that it was real and that it was possible

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.800
and then he went on podcast after podcast saying

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.280
that peter makala jay kui and i think i came up with it myself

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.800
and now he's doing it here he's still doing the same recycling of the same

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.720
bullshit and it's on the same dumb points

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.480
the same dumb points that he definitely could not have come up with on his own

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.280
i know he didn't because i was in the signal chat where i taught it to him

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.040
and where other people in the signal chat were also having trouble grasping

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.120
it

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:18.160
and the people that were in that signal chat are not nobody

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.760
there are people that are still running around masquerading as people that

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.640
aren't trying to get us out of this as patriots

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:33.280
and i find myself very very want to not believe them because i don't trust

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.840
any of them because of the way that they treated me

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.920
the only thing that i have to give to the world is

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.400
my little story what i know from my experience

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.800
i can't give the our world anything else

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.080
and my own little private hell is that i've been contacted by a lot of these

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.760
people i've had private phone calls with a lot of these people sometimes in the

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.760
middle of the night and when i say a lot of these people

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.640
i'm not talking about some random you know oh i got to talk to uh

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.560
Brett Weinstein once at one of these gatherings or something like that

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.680
no i'm talking about getting phone calls having their names in my phone

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.480
having special ringtones so that i know that they are calling

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.960
and i've had several instances of people that i've had special ringtones on

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.840
my phone because i thought i finally made a connection with somebody that

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.800
matters and it's always turned out to be bull

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:43.360
it's always been a disappointment think about that

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.240
think about the fact that i actually got a job at children's health defense that

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:55.680
only lasted for six months that's how hard i'm working on this

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.040
and some people want you to believe that i'm burning bridges everywhere and

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.520
that's why i am where i am and it's not the case

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:09.280
it's because i'm telling the truth all the time 100 percent of the time

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.680
i am spitting the truth and people don't like it

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.240
even when it's in private meetings in private zooms they don't like it

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.640
even when the truth is very very much just the truth they don't like it

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:31.840
and that's the problem here there isn't a person in this game who isn't playing

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.400
this fake it until you make it bullshit

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.160
isn't playing this you know i'll tell the truth about certain things and lie

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.920
about other things and i'll get away with it

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.200
no one else there is no one else in this game

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.640
that's playing it straight except for maybe mark kulak and a few others

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.080
there's these people that have risen there none of them are playing it straight

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.120
none of them are real people

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.640
none of them are legitimately struggling they are clinging to their comfort

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:07.760
that has been provided to them by a system that has been recruited them in order to sustain itself

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.360
because they are propelling this mythology they are propelling this mythology that is

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.560
trapping our children and they are they are in complete denial of it

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.920
winning or on winning i don't know i i tend to air on winning

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.920
brat for sure brat for sure

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.720
the only person during the entire history of my career as a as a biologist

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.400
listen to this very carefully the only person in my entire career as a biologist to tell me

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.200
that i was a shitty teacher is brat winesley

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:52.240
the only person to tell me that i'm not really sure that talking to you for a half

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.600
an hour is going to do any good is brat winesley

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.920
and that guy is now telling the world that he more or less his name is a net positive

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:14.240
for covid a net positive net positive is how he works on on rating himself

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.200
as a thought leader and as a member of his dream team

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.480
it's annoying to me i'll be really honest with you whoops

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.960
it's annoying to me i'll be really honest with you because i spent a lot of time and a lot of

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.040
effort and a lot of energy trying to share my knowledge and the work that i was doing with them

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:45.920
in private and i trusted them i trusted that they were working for my kids best interest i

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.480
trusted them and that they were working with me um with my family's best interest in mind and i

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:59.760
trusted them not to use me and i definitely was used and when i was no longer useful they

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:06.800
tossed me out some of those people that are in that that little uh that little group are still

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.400
every once in a while pinging me somewhere and in a negative way

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.400
and it's just sad because this this has really solidified my belief unfortunately that the

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:25.600
clone story is the story you want to be distracted by the swarm you want to be distracted by

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.760
RNA fidelity or whatever else that's fine but clones are the thing

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.880
and synthetic viruses are the thing and it's what everybody doesn't want to talk about

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:42.160
and it's the only thing that there are patents for there's only thing that there are is a definite

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:49.360
traceable pattern in the literature for the pursuit of self-replicating RNA and and

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.320
and virus-like particles and packaging of virus-like particles using transfection that's that's what

01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:03.920
it is and so as we move forward you can continue to expect these people to be gatekeepers you can

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.960
expect them to be gatekeepers you can expect them not to talk about this and and what's really

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:14.320
extraordinary is just to give you an example of how bad it is that they won't talk about these

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:22.480
points at all that we're never going to get there with these people and that that's the way you see

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:28.480
where we are we are a hundred percent controlled we have not won anything at all it at some point

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:35.040
during covid it felt like everybody was going to wake up that everybody was going to question

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.200
the vaccine schedule that nobody was going to give their kid a vaccine again that holy cow this is

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:47.680
really going to happen and then is over that whole momentum vanished I mean it vanished

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:54.400
and it's it's you can almost not feel it anymore it's vanished so quickly and maybe that's just me

01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:01.360
after the gut punch of january 4th but boy I don't feel this I don't feel the momentum right now

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:08.080
even though I believe wholeheartedly in this being the thing they're ignoring I don't feel

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:15.520
the momentum anymore I feel it's been taken away from us and you can hear it here listen to

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:24.560
erin rogers and and and joe rogan speak and not question the childhood vaccine schedule not

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:31.200
question the childhood vaccine schedule listen to them not question anything except for kind of

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:38.240
transfection but not really and certainly not the childhood vaccine schedule because I just thought

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:47.680
it was a flu shot meaning flu shots are fine meaning flu shots are fine the message right now

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.120
out of the joe rogan podcast is flu shots are well if you know peter mccaula peter mccaula is like

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.400
that guy has standards and morals and ethics I mean he is a rock solid and he actually treated

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:05.200
patients too actually treated patients he's also the most published doctor in history yeah in his

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:10.720
particular field of study like what's what do you what is the the conspiracy on that about

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.280
motivation like what do I get out of that well do you get out at a share what you share well I

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.280
didn't think anything was going to happen when when then it happened with me I knew that people

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.120
were upset at me because I was hesitant to take the vaccine but that was because two people I

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.320
knew got strokes yeah I wasn't initially hesitant at all I was set up to take it I was set up to

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.640
take it by the UFC yeah I was ready to do it I was like okay shoot me up I was going to have them

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.600
do it to me I thought of it like a flu shot like if I was about to do the UFC and they said oh

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.440
you have to take a flu shot before you say it might all right just take me I didn't think it was

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:47.360
going to be a big deal and then they said well in two weeks when you're back just come early and

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360
you come to the clinic I said okay we'll do that and then within that two weeks it got pulled yeah

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:57.600
luckily you know but it's not just those two guys I know a lot of people now it's pretty severe

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.840
vaccine injuries so I don't and so many people have reached out to me because of what happened to

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.800
me celebrities that wanted to be quiet about it you know people that are like really hesitant

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.680
about talking about it openly and publicly but they were really scared like people that have

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.720
like real serious problem I have two friends that have pacemakers now yeah I'm gonna talk about that

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.760
they're like one of them under 30s right yeah it was a dentist that's not fucking normal no it's

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.680
not normal it's not normal it's not normal for your heart to stop for nine seconds at a time he's a

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.720
thin healthy young guy and all of a sudden his heart starts fucking up why does nobody care about

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.040
that well everyone's scared there's people that are scared because they took it and they're worried

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.640
that they have a ticking time mom and they want any information any information that refutes that

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:46.240
and that confirms that they made the right choice also they did make the right choice morally and

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.800
ethically when they did it they did it because they thought they were doing the right thing everybody

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.640
has to do it we're going to protect everyone if we all do this this is going to get us out of

01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.720
the pandemic because the news media was being used by these pharmaceutical drug companies to

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.280
push a very specific narrative and they didn't do any critical thinking they didn't step outside

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:11.680
the box they didn't talk to any scientist that differed they all just stuck with whatever Fauci

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.040
said whatever the NIH said and they also demonize people who are saying things that have been proven

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.520
to be absolutely correct like the fucking lab leak theory if you brought up the lab leak theory

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.000
used to get banned from youtube now it's widely accepted by everyone everyone so was all the

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.840
all the conspiracies that that got people censored and kicked off so many of them have been proven

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:40.720
yeah true yeah so many of them have proven to be true what about that conspiracy theory about

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:50.320
vaccines causing autism what about that that theory about vaccines causing chronic disease and

01:49:51.920 --> 01:50:02.800
allergies because those conspiracies are also on the table on Joe Rogan's table every once in a while

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:09.040
on on RFK's lips every once in a while on other people's lips like Peter McCullough

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.800
they were just they were just shouting about Peter McCullough Peter McCullough said it more than once

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.160
that the childhood vaccine schedule he doesn't think he would use it anymore

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:27.120
so where are where is it why are we plugging Peter McCullough we're not going to plug that statement

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:32.800
that's like plugging Denny Rancor and then saying that he says 17 million people were killed by

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:39.680
the shot but not saying that he also doesn't have any excuse me too much water evidence for spread

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:48.800
think about that that's exactly the exact way that the limited spectrum of debate is done

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:56.240
and I suspect that an unwitting participant here is is Aaron Rodgers and a winning participant is

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.680
is Joe Rogan

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:09.200
and so we we accept the virus we accept that it's going around we accept that people were hurt

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.400
by the shot we accept that people were rushed into doing it because people were told that it was safe

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.320
but for some reason or another these super geniuses can't really get to the question of

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:27.920
well I wonder if they were lying about any of this stuff before the pandemic I wonder if any

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:36.640
of these moms that have been crying on the doorstep of Congress for years about and these dads

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:46.000
these autism parents that have been ridiculed as conspiracy theorists and lambasted on TV for decades

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.240
maybe that's real too are these guys actually not smart enough to come that far

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.160
or are they just kind of pretending to be awake because that's where we are

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:08.480
where people are too afraid to wake all the way up so they just really hold on tight to these

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:15.280
few revelations that are safe now lab leak and transfection was probably bad if you took a lot

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.240
of them you know maybe no more boosters or something like that

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:27.760
it's really it's really really annoying it's really annoying because this Scooby-Doo is going

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:34.400
on it's not stopping the the because of what you just saw there because of Joe Rogan

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:40.800
because of of Brett Weinstein we're still in the middle of this and we're still going to be

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.200
arguing about the exact definition of a lab leak for a couple more years I assure you

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:50.880
people are still going to ignore that in Bobby's book the the

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:58.000
the coronavirus paper from 2019 of Cina Bavaria and Allison Tatura is right there in the book

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:04.800
to show you that in 2019 the director of the US Amrit science group or whatever the hell it's

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:11.680
called the science director of US Amrit wrote a paper with the last postdoc of of Ralph Barrick

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:16.160
about a coronavirus pandemic that would need Remdesivir as a cure

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:24.320
and then a few short months later here comes the pandemic and here comes Tony Fauci on the couch

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:29.280
of the White House recommending Remdesivir after it was just recently used for Sohomish

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.160
County man who provided the perfect viral sample that cultured and provided a perfect

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:39.360
sequence that perfectly matched the sequence that was reported in Wuhan and voila you have a

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:49.600
spreading pandemic then we had emails and arguments and redactions and and publications

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:57.920
that said crazy things and now everybody figured it out it's a lab leak it's a lab leak the worst

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:05.760
case scenario happened early but I want his high morbidity I want we can keep playing this guy

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:11.680
over and over again and you know Sasha can put it on her website and on her sub stack and claim

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:17.280
that oh look what I found but we've been using this video for the almost three years now

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.960
nobody wants to admit it that's fine nobody wants to go back to my May videos in my June

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.400
videos in my July videos from 2020 but that's fine

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:38.960
where I was trying very hard to explain how a PCR test that's not specific but but not specific

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.880
for any particular background virus but just for SARS viruses or these RNA viruses in general

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:51.520
would be enough to cause a pandemic that the testing alone is enough to do it and weird enough

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.760
the people that are involved in controlling this narrative have been involved in the testing

01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:03.200
business their whole lives the people that are involved in telling us for sure that there is a

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:08.320
DNA in the in the shots and that we can test for it they were both involved in testing

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:12.960
one of them was involved in testing for HIV back in the day

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.160
the other one was involved in PCR testing for SARS at the beginning of the pandemic like come on

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.320
a conflict of interest to anyone are there not enough people without conflicts of interest that we

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:34.080
could talk to why do we have to talk to somebody who not only worked for the human genome project

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.560
which was really the US Department of Energy because that's the high security version of

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.080
of the executive branch that the Department of Energy where the nuclear weapons are that's

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:50.000
where they put the human genome project after you get out of the human genome project if you

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:58.400
then go into producing DNA for micro rays and you go into producing tests for HIV I'm not really

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.440
sure that you're the best person to speak out against the public health narrative of a pandemic

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.680
but okay

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.760
we have to wake up to the fact that some of these people that put themselves in front of us and

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:21.440
are claiming martyrdom I'm not martyrs they're actors they're part of a national security narrative

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.760
we're just going to have to admit it they've been telling us right to our face that this is

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:39.120
fifth generation warfare fifth generation warfare is lying I don't know how to explain it any other

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:46.240
way it's not that complicated you get really pretty girls and really attractive men

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:53.840
and really well-spoken men and really boring people and really convincing people and you get

01:56:53.840 --> 01:57:01.360
them all to lie about the same thing and you put them on social media and you put them on TV and

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:07.840
you give them a podcast and you use the algorithms to artificially elevate them so that more people

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:15.040
than normal would see them and other people that you don't want to be seen do not get those

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.080
kinds of boosts and actually get demoted on social media and the algorithms demote them

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:29.200
and over a very short period of time certain people will have been seen by many more people

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.360
than they would have been seen had these systems not been in place and more importantly the

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:43.840
information and ideas that they were sent out into this world with will be heard and seen by

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:52.000
more people than would have been seen if these mechanisms weren't there and in so doing the

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.800
protocols were not available for us to blame for a significant portion of the deaths when those

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:05.200
deaths were occurring we can see them now we can look back with Jessica Hawkins introspective data

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.560
and see that what we thought was happening didn't happen

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:16.720
but when we asked somebody like Pierre Corey he's got some kind of answers which say yeah but it did

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:24.160
happen even though the numbers don't show that it happened these people insist that it happened

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:32.480
they treated people it was a novel virus very new but nobody could see it nobody was isolating

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.320
it not one of these people ever sequenced it the only reason why they know it's a new virus is

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:44.320
because they told there was a new virus and they were told that this diagnostic right here can

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:52.080
show you the new virus that's it that's just diagnostic oh there's a red line does that mean

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:57.600
that the virus is there or there's a red line mean that it's not there red line is virus okay great

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:04.720
that's the level of sophistication that this argument is taking place at oh i'm sure there

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:12.720
was something new because i treated it i'm sure there was something new because i was told there

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:18.880
was something new i'm there was 50 people on a ventilator but you were told to put them on a

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:30.240
ventilator right or not right and this is going to go on and on and on why because people won't

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:40.800
stop lying so that's why because these people are never going to stop lying they're never going

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:46.880
to do it because that's what fifth generation warfare is it's not any more complicated than that

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:55.040
it's not it's the algorithms help the algorithms are important but it's not AI it's not fake videos

01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:01.200
it's not people making videos with an AI version of my voice and then ruining my life

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.800
it's very simple things like credit rating and ability to get alone

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:15.760
and it's it's promoting people who are committed to lying

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:23.760
and if you promote people that are committed to lying about the exact same thing in the exact same way

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:30.800
you can control a society that's fifth generation warfare in a nutshell

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:39.200
and that's how we are being governed right now and many of these people are

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:44.080
unwitting participants but many more of them are winning participants they're happy to be part

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:50.080
of the governing group they're happy to be a thought leader they're happy to be invited to

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.880
those barbecues they're happy to be invited to those meetings they're happy to carry the card

02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:00.480
they're happy to get the laminate they're very proud of themselves being part of this elite group

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.840
of people that's not a mouth breather that just doesn't go to the gas station like everybody else

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:13.200
but goes to the gas station with that knowledge that they're part of the inside group the cool kids

02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.880
and you can see them because they stick to this

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:32.160
and lately it feels like even if I actually say this over and over and over again i'm still

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:38.160
getting attacked by some of these people and that's very strange but we just keep going we keep

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:43.600
our arms straight we keep our flashlights forward and we get out of this cave by looking at the

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.040
mystery virus and knowing that it doesn't equal excess deaths by trying to do the math and by

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:55.360
trying to sort through these people who they are what role they're playing what they're supposed

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.960
to be doing or not doing or if they're just people fighting for our grandkids

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.960
i hope they're people fighting for our grandkids i really do i hope they are i'm not very convinced

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.280
skip a few slides there and i'm going to go right to the end

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.480
um i just want to make sure that everybody knows that this is far from over and that we're just

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:30.240
getting started um remember that we are advocating now for a pause on the vaccine schedule in america

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:36.720
it needs to be reevaluated um the the contents of the vaccine schedule need to be reevaluated

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:42.160
but also it's it's very existence it's construction it's justification it's scheduling everything

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.880
needs to be questioned and that means we need a pause because it is probably damaging

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:53.040
lots and lots of children um advocate for strict liability on all pharmaceutical products and that's

02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:58.640
really something that lawyers understand everybody understands it's a really simple way to fix this

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:03.680
problem it gets rid of almost like 90 percent of the problem from the very beginning just say

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:10.800
strict liability thank you very much um and actually if you restored the vaccine act from 1986 to its

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:17.680
original writing it would be okay and then got rid of the prep act we would be all right

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.800
you got to be very careful if somebody tries to tell you to get rid of the 1986 vaccine act

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.080
because the 1986 vaccine act is the only legislation on the books that acknowledges

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:32.640
that vaccines cause damage that vaccines are dangerous so we don't want to get rid of that

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:37.600
law we want to put it back to the way it was when it was first envisioned and first

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:45.280
accepted first written and first legislated and then improve it from there rather than all the

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.080
amendments that watered it down over the years after it was originally written we need to investigate

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:57.680
the use of deadly protocols and and and numerical chicanery to create the mass casualty events

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:08.400
um and I just want to do a shout out here really quick um Jessica Hawket got a reply from uh

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.960
the response from Pierre Corey on the questions about the New York experience and I do think

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.720
it's worthwhile I might even do a whole show on this tomorrow um on some of his responses it's

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:26.800
very curious one of the things that she highlights is that she's that he says I'm what I'm really

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.800
worried about is that you guys will never admit that there was that this was a novel

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:38.640
pathogen even though it was and so what you see right here is Pierre Corey being very very

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:43.280
adamant about the idea that there was a novel virus and it killed millions of people

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:50.080
and so this is the faith that I think we need to dispel but I don't want to

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:59.040
to automatically or or or offhand discount Pierre Corey and so uh giving him the benefit of the

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:04.160
doubt I think it's going to be necessary to read a couple of these sub stacks again and then watch

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:09.120
these videos and listen carefully but I just want you to listen to this last video down here because

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:14.480
I did watch it and it's only two minutes long and it makes an interesting observation that I think is

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:22.640
crucial to the illusion which is that long covid has something to do with with what recently

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:29.280
happened with the novel virus and I'm exceedingly frustrated by this because it especially coming

02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:35.520
from a doctor because it somehow ignores and you'll hear that that he spits it out very

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:40.960
contradictory he contradicts himself in two sentences directly in the sense of saying it's

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:46.640
definitely a novel virus and the evidence for it is that it creates a disease that was here

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:54.960
before the pandemic called chronic fatigue syndrome and this has always bothered me from the very

02:05:54.960 --> 02:06:02.080
beginning because again once the the pandemic had kicked off it wasn't very long before the

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:08.400
rumors of extended covid or long covid were already out there in the background not dissimilar to the

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:13.760
worst case scenarios of a billion people dying and we need to lockdown longer than 15 days we need

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:21.440
60 or whatever it was also was out there was this idea of long covid and that frustrated me a lot

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:27.680
because chronic fatigue syndrome was something that before the pandemic was often often written off

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:37.520
as as being non-existent or being psychosomatic or whatever and like so many of these things that

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:46.160
I think in retrospect will be tied to vaccine damage will be tied to flu vaccine damage or HPV

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:54.000
vaccine damage that this chronic fatigue syndrome that a lot of college age kids were getting

02:06:54.800 --> 02:07:00.640
that was likely vaccine injury is being confounded and right away at the beginning of the pandemic

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:10.480
with the spreading of this virus and so it's extremely telling to hear this man say that that

02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:16.240
chronic fatigue syndrome is evidence for the spread of a novel virus listen very carefully

02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:19.760
because that's exactly what he says

02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:31.200
and you guys are also ignoring this but the novelty of this pathogen is I think also equally

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:38.080
best evidence in terms of the huge rates of long covid which is although it's a new name it's an

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:43.200
old disease it's called me CFS for myologic encephalitis chronic fatigue syndrome the three pillars of

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:49.040
that diagnosis it's fatigue post-exertum lays and brain fiber cognitive deficits I literally left

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.560
medicine I have a practice which treats nothing but long covid and long vax actually long vax is

02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:00.000
far more common than long covid but the long covid I mean they're still equally or almost

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.720
equally the vaccine injured are much sicker generally on average sicker than long covid so

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:12.080
so what I find most curious about this and I'm going to let you go is that the the proposal that I

02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:20.560
made on Bobby Kennedy's defender podcast when Robert Malone and Meryl Nasse and Tess Lorry

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:27.360
and Jessica Rose were listening and were commenting afterward was a transfection not

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:37.840
not of an infectious clone but it was a transfection of the spike protein alone as an immunogenic protein

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:46.960
and a transfection of the spike protein alone could result in a lot of the things that we see

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:53.440
and would have a lot of parallels with a transfection intramuscularly to a spike

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:59.440
an inhaled transfection to the spike would have a very similar outcome

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:09.200
and it struck me as kind of odd that what everybody got really excited about and really got

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:16.720
mad about was the clones everybody kind of ignored what I said on that podcast with Bobby which was

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:24.160
actually a transfection of the spike protein alone would be enough and that they could use the

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:29.680
DNA of the spike and the DNA of the whole clone whenever to plant the PCR positivity

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.560
and that the PCR positivity to the spike would be there in a spike transfection the best part

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.920
about the spike transfection is it's a smaller RNA molecule to package it's a smaller

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:48.400
it's a it's a proven technology you can definitely express a protein

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:56.400
and it would result perhaps in the exact thing that Giorgio talks about what's

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:02.720
seed a few cases there seed a few cases there listen to what he keeps saying now listen carefully

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:08.640
but more in covens are wicked I mean I have a literally a practice full of them and although

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.840
ME CFS used to occur you know it's typically associated with mononucleosis the rates at which

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:20.160
you saw that come it does not even compare to covid and so the rates that you saw it does not

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:26.880
even compare to covid but what he said earlier was that that there aren't that many people who have

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:34.240
long covid from covid most of them are long vax so again we're talking about exposure to

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:42.000
transfection we're talking about being transfected is it transfected to the spike that matters that's

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:50.400
possible but what I would like you to see is that a a transfection in certain places could cause

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.680
people to complain cause people to have the molecular signal cause people to have the immunological

02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:06.880
signal cause people to even develop antibodies to the spike and so the one funny thing that people

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:13.840
had supposedly when they had normal the circulating version of whatever this is is that they had

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:21.200
N protein antibodies that was the one story that they told us that had some sort of connection

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:28.960
between natural infection and transfection was that antibodies to the N protein were evident

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.040
after infection but not after transfection and so that's curious

02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.800
and we could probably figure that out if we looked at some of these people to see whether or not they

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:45.360
had transfection or infection whether they had these N proteins if we believe that's a real thing

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:55.360
but what I'm trying to get at here is very very simple the disease already existed there's

02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:00.480
already a mechanism by which it could have been generated and that is vaccination

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:08.400
vaccination in college kids in particular for HPV and for whatever else they decided to give them

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:16.000
and the idea that it's mostly associated with mononucleosis another disease that happens in

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.960
college not saying don't go to college I'm saying that this is something that is being distorted

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.200
and misrepresented as something that wasn't very prevalent it's not very prevalent

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:33.280
because people won't diagnose it it was much more prevalent than than the numbers say because

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:40.640
most doctors denied its existence and then when long covid came out everybody had long covid

02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:50.000
and it was totally accepted that's the difference and he seems to be completely ignorant of that

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.200
he seems to think that it was really really rare before the pandemic and now it's everybody

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.360
this thing is wicked I have so many disabled patients I have an entire practice I have a partner

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:06.720
we work full-time I have an employee an NP and we have an entire practice with the same syndrome

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:12.080
and that's all I do for a living now and it's wickedly complex to treat and it's not a syndrome from

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.800
the virus it's not a syndrome from the virus it's a syndrome from transfection

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:22.400
and he is being very dishonest if he won't say that

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:29.760
if he was going to be honest I would argue I'm sorry Pierre but I would argue if you were going

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:38.960
to be really honest what you should say is that what I see in these patients that are being

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.840
transfected is eerily similar to some small number of people

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.160
who were affected from the beginning before they got transfected

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.800
and that's the only evidence that I have that there might be a novel pathogen that has some

02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:02.000
connection to what we transfected people to because those two are connected and then maybe those

02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.480
gears would start to turn in his head and he would start to realize well maybe that's because

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.360
they were kind of the same thing because they were kind of exposure to the same

02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:13.760
immunogen both times

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.240
and it doesn't have to be an infectious clone ladies and gentlemen it can just be a lipid

02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:28.400
nanoparticle aerosolized with RNA for a spike protein and immunogen that would cause your immune

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:36.560
system to go haywire you know like a like a staph and tirotoxin B

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:48.800
so the concept of it being a incapacitating agent is not crazy the concept of it being a self

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:52.640
replicating self-perpetuating endlessly circulating

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:59.760
incapacitating agent is absurd the idea that an incapacitating agent might kill a

02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:07.120
billion people is absurd the idea that an incapacitating agent of this nature could be protected from

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:15.040
by a surgical mask is ridiculous but it's all part of the worst case scenario cartoon narrative

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:21.520
that these people were involved in laying and involved in preserving so that the fundamental

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:29.760
principle of what happened gets passed on to our children so that this mythology is passed on

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:36.720
to our children of long covid of a pandemic of a novel pathogen it must be passed on to our

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:42.640
children so that they accept the changes in the vaccine schedule so that they accept the changes

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:47.120
in the way that we think about public health in our lives so that they accept the changes in the

02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:52.080
way that we think about our sovereignty going forward forever that's what this is about

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.560
they cannot question the vaccine schedule and they will not otherwise they would be doing it all

02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:05.040
the time every time they were given a microphone trying to find different therapies to work in

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:11.680
patients is oftentimes really challenging a lot of times it's not so challenging but it's literally

02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:18.640
it shows you just how toxic this pathogen was i mean i mean look at the disability roles

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:23.120
uh i mean probably that's mostly driven by the vaccines but i mean we've okay so it's mostly

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.400
driven by the vaccine but look how deadly the virus is it's not right you can't say this

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:35.280
you've got to stop we've got to start admitting that there wasn't a virus that whatever it was

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:38.720
it's not explainable by a virus because it didn't spread around

02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:50.640
at very best at the very best at the very best the the no virus people will hate me for saying this

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.720
but at the very best this signal was always there that's the best case scenario for these people

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:06.800
it's the best case scenario for any of them at this stage for Brett for Kevin for Pierre for any

02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:12.480
of them is that this signal was always there because there isn't something that was released

02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:19.200
in July or October or if you go back a little farther it makes sense no no no that's not how

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:24.960
RNA works that's not how coronavirus is whatever they are that's not how they work nothing in the

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:31.920
literature has shown that they have that robust characteristic list of attributes no no no no no

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.200
at best the literature shows that there's something at that size scale and something in this range

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:46.000
that might resemble it but that's it that's all they've got and that's why the no virus stance is

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:54.720
so strong and deserves the utmost attention from AIDS onward all of those people deserve a

02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:02.800
revisiting and I would not preclude to be the I'm not the person to say that I knew this first

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:09.520
those people were way ahead of me and so I am in the process of revisiting all of their work to make

02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:19.520
sure that I give it the due credit it deserves as I try my best to contribute whatever I can to

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:27.760
pushing this ball forward of the no virus or or no pathogenic viruses or no need for for public

02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:33.920
health to save us from pandemic viruses I don't know what the actual stance is going to be at the

02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:41.200
end of this but I do know that this isn't right this insistence that there was something novel

02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:47.760
that went around and devastated the world that insistence is just founded in baseless accusations

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:54.160
and TV watching at best and it is founded in commitment to lies at worst

02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:05.520
and because I as a godfearing man I'm very afraid of liars and I'm very afraid of the power of lying

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:12.400
I feel it's really my it's my it's my only job at this stage to use

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:21.520
my common sense my critical thinking and my knowledge my broad understanding of biology as best I can

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:30.160
to help children understand biology well enough so that they can tell whether people are lying to

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:37.360
them or not about it that this mythology can't be passed on to them again like it was to me and you

02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:47.120
we've got to stop this cycle right now it's got to end right now and if

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:54.640
Pierre is going to be stuck on this in this way it's okay because he is helping a lot of people

02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:59.920
and a lot of people need help because a lot of people were transfected and if it takes Pierre

02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.720
two more years to realize that the that the virus narrative was an illusion to make everybody

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:12.080
accept transfection as a wonder drug maybe that's the price we're going to have to pay

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:17.760
but at a certain moment we're just going to have to stop fighting for that portion of Pierre's

02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:23.040
consciousness and just rest on our on the fact that at least he's helping the people who are

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:31.040
transfected now or trying but if we are going to free ourselves as a society is we're going to

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:35.040
free our children from this we need to get better than that we need to be clearer than that and

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:41.120
that means we need to be really speaking out against the childhood vaccine schedule and really

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:48.320
really speaking out in a way that matters and we also have to get out of the who in the UN

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.400
entirely which I think there are people who are fighting for that I think Meryl Nas has started

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:58.080
a new nonprofit she's fighting for that I think there's a couple other people who have been fighting

02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:02.800
to get out of the who for a while I think it's a worthy cause we have to do it we have to elect

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:13.040
people to Congress who want to do it and I think you can find the meddlers by looking at what they

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:18.080
talk about and what they don't talk about and I won't belabor this point much more I just hope

02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:22.240
that you realize that they've been telling these stories to one another for a long time and so

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:28.800
this mythology lives in their head the mythology lives in their head and so we are

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.440
we're not going to be able to get it out of all of their heads you know it's just not going to

02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:39.680
happen because they believe in this AI like like like Sam Harris believes in the AI so we've got

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:45.520
to stop transfection healthy humans I heard a story from a mom today about how our kids getting

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:51.280
sick every week and it's because of the transfection we talked to her about it we know she knows

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.920
that or she has a gut feeling it's that and now the question is what does she do for her son

02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.200
what do you do for your son if your son's getting sick every week with strep throat

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:09.120
do you get given him antibiotics that's all she's been been able to do and her son never got

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:14.720
strep throat he's had it like seven times this school year stop all transfections ladies and

02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:21.600
gentlemen especially in healthy children for the love of god wake people up share this stream with

02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:27.280
people share these words with people intrascular injection of any combination of substances with

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:33.920
the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb I am preparing I'll show you what I've got here

02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:45.440
open on my desktop right now is the is the Sam Bailey thesis or the the what is this what are you

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:55.280
doing here what's happening shit oh no I got it stuck in between screens I apologize yeah there

02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:01.280
so I'm working on it I don't feel like I should replicate any of their work I should just

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:07.600
acknowledge it so I'm starting with I'm starting with farewell to virology I'm going to take their

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:14.480
SARS-CoV-2 work and make that a first presentation then I'm going to look at some of the other stuff

02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.480
but they look at with measles and with AIDS and of course a lot of that's older people's work

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:25.600
Lanka and other people so we've got a lot of work looking at what these people did I don't think any

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:31.440
of it's wrong I think some of it is misdirecting and some of it is probably not as important as

02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:35.920
others and so I just want to distill it down a little bit give them credit where credits do and

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:41.520
then try to add the clones to it and I know they're not gonna like that I know they're gonna they're

02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:45.840
gonna get pissed off and say that clones don't exist or something like that but I think that's where

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:55.440
this whole this whole cake actually bakes and becomes angel food is when you realize that

02:23:55.440 --> 02:24:04.560
the no virus people are right and the way that virology has been extended into 2024 is

02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:12.720
with infectious clones and synthetic RNA and DNA that that's the way that they've overcome

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:22.000
the virology illusion and and been able to successfully extend it into 2024 and beyond it will be a

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.160
it's a DNA RNA synthetic illusion and without understanding the role of clones you're not going

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.360
to be able to fully break through and so I believe that this just needs an extra chapter and then

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:38.800
we're there so you know call me a gatekeeper call you call me what you will I think I'm gonna have

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.120
Mark Bailey on my show at some point if he's willing to come on and we're gonna be able to work this

02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:49.600
out in a way that that actually moves the ball forward I'm I'm I'm hopeful if not we're just

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.440
gonna keep doing the solo thing I'll see you tomorrow I'll be on again tomorrow

02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.440
sorry I was so late again see you

02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.480
you
