WEBVTT

00:03.439 --> 00:05.980
Thanks for watching!

00:53.686 --> 01:07.758
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America.

01:07.918 --> 01:08.338
I don't know.

01:08.999 --> 01:09.860
Crash the dollar.

01:10.060 --> 01:10.500
I don't know.

01:11.041 --> 01:14.984
Steal the rest of our our what limited treasury value we have left.

01:15.184 --> 01:15.705
I don't know.

01:17.266 --> 01:18.247
But I know for sure

01:18.632 --> 01:36.074
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

01:38.830 --> 01:44.994
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:45.394 --> 01:48.457
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:48.517 --> 01:57.984
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:58.004 --> 02:04.589
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:54.028 --> 03:20.127
I don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too Thursday, I don't care about you It's Friday, I'm in love Monday you can fall apart Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart Oh, Thursday doesn't even start It's Friday, I'm in love

03:25.700 --> 03:31.423
Monday always comes to bed, and Friday never hesitated.

03:31.543 --> 03:38.526
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, hard to tell.

03:39.346 --> 03:42.108
Thursday, never looking back.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.829
It's Friday, I'm in love.

04:00.499 --> 04:03.320
Monday, you can hold your head.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.081
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed on Thursday.

04:08.421 --> 04:10.401
Watch the walls instead.

04:10.521 --> 04:13.042
It's Friday, I'm in love.

04:14.582 --> 04:16.503
Saturday, wait.

04:18.123 --> 04:21.024
Sunday, always come to me.

04:21.404 --> 04:23.564
But Friday, never hesitate.

04:23.644 --> 04:26.625
Just look to the eyes.

04:27.045 --> 04:29.986
It's a wonderful surprise to see your

04:36.917 --> 04:37.278
It's

04:54.611 --> 05:19.923
I don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too Thursday, I don't care about you It's Friday, I'm in love Monday you can fall apart Tuesday and Wednesday break my heart Thursday doesn't even start It's Friday, I'm in love

06:16.479 --> 06:18.480
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.223
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.644
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

06:28.986 --> 06:29.747
It's embarrassing.

06:53.394 --> 06:58.337
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, good evening, good night, wherever you are.

06:58.397 --> 07:03.540
This is high noon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the 13th of September 2024.

07:03.580 --> 07:06.001
It is Friday the 13th and I am in love.

07:09.083 --> 07:13.984
Um, yes, your consciousness is still the prime real estate that all these people are competing for.

07:14.524 --> 07:31.028
Do you remember how absurd it was that they showed us these cartoons of RNA molecules and little injectable bubbles that went into the dendritic cell and the dendritic cell then expressed a protein and then presented it to T-cells?

07:31.468 --> 07:33.748
Do you remember when they showed us all that stuff?

07:33.788 --> 07:36.869
These same charlatans that had power over our parents?

07:37.509 --> 07:43.972
Do you remember that these charlatans, as I told you, are not only the ones on TV, but also the ones on social media?

07:44.552 --> 07:46.933
Many of whom have been cooperating for decades.

07:47.454 --> 07:49.835
It's really quite creepy when you see it.

07:50.715 --> 07:55.417
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, the escape key on the internet.

07:55.517 --> 08:00.540
One of the only ones available, but I did advertise for a few more at the beginning of this show.

08:01.320 --> 08:08.447
I'd like to remind you first off that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:08.927 --> 08:16.595
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

08:17.175 --> 08:24.623
And I'm going to spend the next I don't know how long trying to make sure that every high school kid grows up and leaves his house or her house

08:25.283 --> 08:30.385
knowing these things to be true and understanding the biology that underpins them.

08:31.465 --> 08:42.848
Over the last five years, they've tried desperately with this orchestrated theater on the internet to convince you that a mystery virus is responsible for most of the excess deaths in America, around the world.

08:42.868 --> 08:45.289
You shouldn't care about anything else, quite frankly.

08:47.128 --> 09:00.428
and this illusion has been created with a series of misdirections that has involved a lot of murder and a lot of lies and that misdirection and that murder and lies has resulted in a

09:02.330 --> 09:10.411
an illusion being created where there is zero epidemiological evidence of spread and almost no one on the internet pointing that out.

09:11.092 --> 09:23.774
No one talking about strict liability or the many violations of our basic 7th Amendment right to sue for damages that are currently codified in legislative law in America.

09:24.694 --> 09:25.554
It's crazy.

09:27.134 --> 09:27.995
And why?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.495
Why would they do this?

09:29.655 --> 09:29.835
Well,

09:30.755 --> 09:43.083
They needed this murder and lies in order to conceal the truth about the vaccine schedule, the truth about transfection, the truth about virology.

09:44.103 --> 09:48.126
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and in fact even before

09:49.201 --> 09:54.627
The pandemic, the vaccine schedule in the USA was a criminal enterprise and RNA cannot pandemic.

09:54.647 --> 09:56.309
We've known that for a long time.

09:57.130 --> 10:03.577
And it has been the goal of the national security state to make sure that our children never learn that truth.

10:05.475 --> 10:14.360
And unfortunately, these people are wittingly or unwittingly cooperating in the misleading of the young, the passing along of this mythology.

10:15.161 --> 10:17.883
And I don't know if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:17.963 --> 10:20.064
is a witting or unwitting participant.

10:20.204 --> 10:24.507
I suspect a lot of the others are witting participants.

10:24.547 --> 10:34.073
I think it's very hard to believe that somebody that didn't complete a degree in college and instead became a productive member of the Human Genome Project is on our team.

10:35.373 --> 10:46.898
But instead, part of this creating of an illusion of consensus, a limited spectrum of debate that has been enforced by these people, wittingly or unwittingly, and us on the internet.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.219
That's us there in the chair.

10:49.159 --> 10:54.161
We are trying to save the universe by putting on goggles and grabbing a joystick and pushing pedals.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.942
And the simulation is really cool.

10:57.002 --> 11:01.024
And the Empire and all the Star Wars stuff seems really real in our goggles.

11:02.864 --> 11:18.879
What you're really doing, essentially, when you start to think that Steve Kirsch is coming to your rescue, or that Brett Weinstein is coming to your rescue, or that Kevin McKernan is somehow risking anything to come to your rescue, or that Sasha Latapova and her daughter are patriots,

11:19.560 --> 11:28.895
You're really just falling, you're just getting into the chair and willingly engaging in this highly, highly entertaining narrative, but it's a complete illusion.

11:28.975 --> 11:30.818
You're not fighting anyone when you do that.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.763
You are engaging in the new kind of totalitarianism.

11:34.682 --> 11:55.740
where it'll feel really cool and it'll look really cool and the images will be really sharp but uh they will just be quietly running the show as they see fit and who's really responsible for this are these acolytes on social media these people who have masqueraded as saviors have masqueraded as people coming to our rescue

11:56.937 --> 12:01.220
And at times tried to make me feel like I was one of them coming to the rescue.

12:01.560 --> 12:06.623
And I know now the truth that I'm definitely not coming to the rescue.

12:06.683 --> 12:10.025
That something much larger than me is the only thing that can rescue us.

12:11.241 --> 12:17.644
And these weaponized piles of money have used their acolytes on social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

12:17.724 --> 12:21.365
Participating in the argument accepts the premise of their narrative by default.

12:22.145 --> 12:29.148
And we are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms, including all sides of their mythologies.

12:29.188 --> 12:30.209
Who are you talking to?

12:30.809 --> 12:38.132
You're talking to a recovering Academy magician, somebody who used to want tenure and has a long track record to prove it.

12:39.713 --> 12:44.916
I've come out and lost my career as a result of trying to figure this out.

12:45.016 --> 12:52.941
And many of these meddlers have misled me into believing that I was helping or doing the right thing.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.504
And this long list that I covered yesterday actually shows you why.

12:58.894 --> 13:00.656
I probably have seen the real alien.

13:02.077 --> 13:07.043
So this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

13:07.063 --> 13:08.604
This is the 13th of September, 2024.

13:10.086 --> 13:15.171
Let me get over here and see if I can make this work.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.334
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

13:17.354 --> 13:18.435
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

13:18.475 --> 13:20.217
I'm the biologist that brings you this show.

13:21.198 --> 13:23.220
I've got a quite a good one for you today.

13:23.740 --> 13:32.370
It's mostly a shout out, but I just really always have to give this summary, always have to kind of bring us onto the same page.

13:32.971 --> 13:36.595
I think it's really important for anybody joining for the first time that I always do this.

13:37.035 --> 13:39.598
I think there's a concerted effort by these

13:42.049 --> 14:04.228
these non grassroots heroes that have come to our rescue on white horses and spoke in front of Senator Ron Johnson's adjacent Senate room a couple times and have been at these international COVID summits, want us to believe that indeed they are saving us from the bad COVID shot, but they just don't want you to think about 2020 and 2021 very much.

14:04.788 --> 14:08.491
Because if you do, you might find out that a lot of these people made very sure

14:09.312 --> 14:13.957
that none of us would usefully question the national security narrative before 2021.

14:15.679 --> 14:25.750
And the essential effect of that is that the uptake of transfection in our oldest members of our society was as successful as they could have hoped it to be.

14:26.949 --> 14:39.231
And that has resulted in exactly what they needed to occur, this just general acquiescence to the idea that something needed to be done, something was done, and although it was rushed, a lot of people were saved.

14:40.629 --> 14:49.053
And I think that's why somebody like Robert Malone is pretending to come to our rescue and only pretending to come to our rescue in 2021.

14:49.133 --> 14:59.717
That's the reason why, if I can switch down here to the bottom, that's the reason why they created this illusion of consensus in the first place, and why many of these people are essentially equivalent now.

14:59.797 --> 15:01.098
These two authors of the

15:01.898 --> 15:07.443
of the fake objection to the WHO PCR test in 2020.

15:08.664 --> 15:19.294
These two authors of substacks and pretend journalists, one on one side and one on the other, one American, one Canadian, Israeli.

15:20.375 --> 15:24.379
This guy, for example, who was working for DITRA at the beginning of the pandemic and has

15:24.819 --> 15:27.420
hovered around the coattails of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:27.460 --> 15:40.905
since the beginning of the pandemic, that Children's Health Defense is selling his third or fourth book by now probably, and this clown that has been on YouTube for no other reason than to be famous, and so that he was obviously just used like

15:41.545 --> 15:44.806
like the little star that he wanted to be.

15:44.966 --> 16:01.033
And so whoever and however they are used for whatever reason, you know, you go back to Claire Craig, she was advocating for widespread genetic testing before the pandemic because she's a clinical pathologist and thinks that genetic testing could be really useful in tracking down the causes of disease.

16:01.713 --> 16:19.182
So he's not that dissimilar to somebody like Kevin McKernan, who for his entire lifetime has been advocating for the, well, for his entire professional career has been working with people who descend from people who have been advocating for turning the entire world population into a genetic test.

16:19.742 --> 16:26.344
factory, a genetic testing giant experiment, because that's what's necessary in order to correct the human genome.

16:26.424 --> 16:28.805
His former supervisor, Mark Lander, said it.

16:28.845 --> 16:41.348
His father was into microarray technologies, one of the crucial pieces of the puzzle as we move through the evolution of sequencing technologies that started in the Human Genome Project.

16:42.534 --> 16:51.201
And so it's not for nothing that someone like Kevin McKernan just happened to come out in 2020 and say, Hey, I'm sequencing the weed because I'm a weed geneticist.

16:53.043 --> 16:54.264
It's not for nothing at all.

16:54.344 --> 16:57.707
In fact, it's actually part of this narrative control.

16:57.787 --> 17:02.331
It's probably because Robert Malone and him are part of the same DITRA team for far as I know.

17:03.780 --> 17:08.282
Department of Energy, you know, this whole really nukes, it's all the same thing.

17:08.503 --> 17:09.623
DITRA was nukes.

17:10.163 --> 17:14.086
It's all very top secret State Department, you know, whatever.

17:14.926 --> 17:16.487
All the same people are involved.

17:16.527 --> 17:19.648
And these are the people that created the illusion of consensus from 2020.

17:19.769 --> 17:29.854
This guy, we've watched three different podcasts from him in 2020, talking about how PCR works and, and why it works and why it needs to be used even on the weed.

17:32.847 --> 17:39.574
And so that's why I get very worked up over the, I'm gonna escape for this just for a second and then come back to the slide.

17:40.975 --> 17:57.191
That's why I get very worked up over what happened on Twitter because I was part of this Twitter group at the beginning of the pandemic that kind of coordinated all this international intrigue about what was happening with regard to the coverup of the lab leak.

17:57.884 --> 17:58.905
And I bought into that.

17:59.005 --> 18:06.934
I really fell for that hook, line, and sinker and thought most of those people were spontaneous collection of heroes and I was just one of them.

18:07.898 --> 18:24.408
And that continued as long as I engaged on Twitter, I was a vulnerable to these people that would come and pose as allies, but the whole time they were kind of interested in getting me to re-engage in this way.

18:25.188 --> 18:37.035
So that I'm essentially sitting in the chair and by retweeting Jessica Hockett or retweeting Jonathan Engler, I think I'm fighting the empire and I'm not because those people work for the empire.

18:37.864 --> 18:45.633
That's why Jonathan Engler wrote the worst virology review ever while trying to get me to help him write it.

18:46.513 --> 18:49.577
And Jessica Hockett was the one who encouraged me to do it in the first place.

18:50.238 --> 18:52.100
So we have a number of Americans.

18:53.308 --> 18:59.433
And you can kind of see their stain best on X, because that's where this stuff was all started.

18:59.493 --> 19:07.218
Even Kevin McKernan said it repeatedly on those podcasts in 2020, that it seems like the debate right now is happening on Twitter.

19:07.599 --> 19:11.281
So that then later on, we could say that Twitter was being censored.

19:11.301 --> 19:14.324
And so that later on, we could say that Elon Musk has rescued us.

19:14.784 --> 19:22.570
And so that later on these exact same people could be advocating for X to replace

19:23.928 --> 19:26.631
Or be the substitute for free speech.

19:28.973 --> 19:34.418
Or the, let's say, accepted equivalent of free speech on the internet.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.181
And that's awful.

19:40.503 --> 19:41.864
But that's what's happening here.

19:41.904 --> 19:46.509
That's why those people are the ones who still have hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter.

19:47.543 --> 19:52.705
and have blocked me after four time interacting with me as an ally.

19:53.305 --> 20:09.350
And it's not because I'm particularly dislikable, it's because the biology that I put forth very simply in three sentences, four if you count the bottom one, that they just can't acknowledge, they can't discuss at any depth.

20:10.401 --> 20:22.504
They have to instead make memes with shotguns in my mouth or claim that I'm working for any number of amorphous weaponized piles of money that they themselves are most likely directly employed by.

20:23.085 --> 20:31.147
The funders of Substack, the money that gets laundered through Substack, the money gets laundered through Locals, the money that gets laundered through Rumble.

20:31.647 --> 20:38.195
Those are the people who are advocating for rumble and for live on X and for X being paid.

20:38.596 --> 20:39.597
They are doing it.

20:39.717 --> 20:46.806
The same people who delayed our acknowledgement that something wasn't right in 2020 and 2021 long enough for us to be

20:49.609 --> 21:01.323
vulnerable in our elderly populations, vulnerable to the separation from our college kids because we weren't usefully prepared for them to go back to university.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.527
It was still an emergency thanks to these people.

21:08.547 --> 21:18.329
And so not to belabor the point, but you know, these are the charlatans that you need to be most concerned about because these are the people that are pretending to come to our rescue from these people.

21:18.449 --> 21:20.250
And it's all one big theater.

21:22.150 --> 21:27.171
I got a very interesting email and concerning email from a viewer the other day.

21:29.272 --> 21:31.852
And I wanted to make a little comment on it now.

21:33.973 --> 21:35.093
She said that she was scared.

21:36.169 --> 21:50.233
You know, she had watched my last few streams and she just was very scared because, quite frankly, we had met in Boston at Bobby's announcement and, you know, she takes my perspective quite seriously.

21:52.264 --> 21:56.947
You know, what I've been saying lately has left her pretty scared.

21:57.627 --> 22:07.272
And what I told her, number one, is that if you're a little nervous about what's to come in the next couple months, I think that's natural because that means you're awake.

22:08.913 --> 22:15.997
If you're riding in a car and things don't sound right, or you're going faster than you think you should, it's normal to be nervous.

22:17.698 --> 22:28.886
And with no, I have no doubt in my mind that it's a normal feeling to feel something is wrong and that something might be imminent.

22:28.946 --> 22:41.995
I don't know if it is, but that's kind of the feeling you get when there's so much contradiction and there's so much incongruency and yet everyone is more and more and more convinced that it's whatever they're seeing is real.

22:43.524 --> 22:49.648
And that becomes very disconcerting if you see how committed, but remember, where are you seeing it?

22:51.389 --> 22:52.530
I can't stress enough.

22:52.630 --> 22:53.850
Where are you seeing it?

22:53.890 --> 22:54.911
You're seeing it here.

22:57.172 --> 22:58.793
You're not seeing it on the street.

22:58.813 --> 23:00.294
You're not seeing it at your church.

23:00.334 --> 23:02.416
You're not seeing it at the basketball game.

23:02.436 --> 23:03.897
You're not seeing it at the gym.

23:04.877 --> 23:05.758
You're seeing it here.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.901
And whatever you see here is an illusion.

23:12.256 --> 23:17.921
It is an illusion that is programmed into the algorithm, maybe for you, but maybe not.

23:19.743 --> 23:26.348
Maybe just because you decided that you were in A group or B group that you now get the B group feed.

23:28.030 --> 23:33.214
I don't think we need to attribute too much magic to the algorithms.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.758
Just know that whatever you see here is meant to be seen.

23:38.615 --> 23:51.062
whatever you see here is meant to occupy one of those 30,000 thoughts that you're capable of having every day and depriving you of those thoughts that could otherwise be used for something useful.

23:53.464 --> 24:04.770
And if we think about the whole system as a theater right now, if we think of it as a theater and we think of that as a stage, then why get stressed out about what's coming next on stage?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.111
That would be kind of silly, right?

24:07.307 --> 24:09.288
Instead, we need to make ourselves ready.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.230
And I think that's a spiritual thing.

24:13.290 --> 24:14.930
I think that's a community thing.

24:14.970 --> 24:16.331
I think that's a family thing.

24:16.371 --> 24:27.436
We need to bond with those around us regularly about this, about where we are and where we're going and why it is that we're gonna make the choices that we make in the near future.

24:27.516 --> 24:31.318
One of those choices might be to not even engage in the election.

24:33.027 --> 24:45.937
One of those choices might be to attribute the election to the same theater as the pandemic, the same theater as all the other things that we know are going on around the world or supposedly because we see it here.

24:47.938 --> 24:52.181
And if the election indeed is another one of those things, then we don't need to be stressed about it.

24:52.221 --> 24:54.383
We know that whatever's going to happen is going to happen.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.466
And chances are pretty good the theater is not dependent on your vote.

25:00.916 --> 25:12.043
And so you might say that by engaging in the vote, you are helping yourself to suspend disbelief and think that maybe one of these people is going to save us.

25:16.045 --> 25:18.907
Only when Americans save America are we done.

25:19.407 --> 25:20.168
Would this happen?

25:21.128 --> 25:23.910
And right now, we're not in that situation.

25:24.090 --> 25:27.332
And I don't know exactly how to imagine it, but I know we're not there yet.

25:29.591 --> 25:35.517
And so again, I think the best thing is to pray for courage to deal with whatever comes in the near future.

25:36.838 --> 25:40.681
Pray for good health for you and your family and friends and for everyone around you.

25:42.383 --> 25:52.853
And pray that you have the opportunity to shed a little light, a little bit of Christ's light somewhere every day, and that you are aware of that opportunity and seize it.

25:54.050 --> 25:55.371
That's about the best you can do.

25:55.471 --> 26:05.303
Pray that you can be a servant to those people around you that you love and find a way to be as selfless as possible today in a way that you weren't yesterday.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.088
Lead by example.

26:10.473 --> 26:11.354
and remain humble.

26:11.474 --> 26:16.418
I mean, that's about all we can do until we get the power back from these charlatans.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.119
And that needs to be a collective thing.

26:18.740 --> 26:28.428
It's gonna be something that none of us are gonna be able to do because of our charisma or because of our fancy wipes or good lighting.

26:29.569 --> 26:36.995
It's only gonna happen when powers larger than us make it happen.

26:38.021 --> 26:40.324
And so we have to surrender to that.

26:40.344 --> 26:42.086
We have to be a leaf in the stream a bit.

26:44.950 --> 26:47.273
The murder and lies are what we have to focus on.

26:47.313 --> 26:49.556
I think we need a new consensus about these things.

26:50.156 --> 26:51.738
I don't need to repeat them too much more.

26:53.159 --> 27:14.930
I do think there are good explanations for a few things, and I think it's important to keep emphasizing that highly intelligent, very sophisticated molecular biologists with decades of experience, like Kevin McKernan, have never bothered to explain how PCR might be highly accurate on an academic bench, but a complete lie for something like a coronavirus.

27:15.410 --> 27:21.673
Instead, he started in 2020 explaining how easily it could be used to detect the virus, even on weed.

27:22.593 --> 27:33.020
I think it's really important to see how the population pyramid being inverted provided an opportunity, which is something that I was quite regularly hammering in 2021.

27:33.660 --> 27:36.142
And at some point I got distracted and stopped it.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.884
So I'm going to come back to that today.

27:39.604 --> 27:46.269
And then finally, again, nobody's talking about, no one on either side is talking about how virology can be a lie.

27:46.989 --> 27:52.773
But the use of transfection and transformation can be misconstrued as virology and in fact often is.

27:53.853 --> 28:03.259
It's actually very, very extraordinary how that last statement is being ignored and how the middle statement has been ignored since I mentioned it.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.902
And so I do want to do that first.

28:07.702 --> 28:11.965
And in order to do that, I just need to draw a couple very quick cartoons.

28:12.185 --> 28:13.446
And so I will do that now.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.227
Hopefully this is going to work.

28:17.304 --> 28:18.885
Oops, like that.

28:19.246 --> 28:20.307
And then this.

28:20.527 --> 28:20.767
Yes.

28:22.108 --> 28:28.574
Okay, so if you're not familiar with a population pyramid, this is just a review for those people who are not familiar with it.

28:28.614 --> 28:31.757
And I just going to make a very quick point about the population pyramid.

28:32.395 --> 28:39.398
that I will point out right now that Denny Rancor doesn't seem to take into account in any of his data.

28:39.838 --> 28:42.159
And it is something that I've talked to him about before.

28:42.219 --> 28:47.281
And since I have a meeting with him on the 16th, it's going to be live on the Jason Levine show.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.122
This is one of the things that I'm going to bring up.

28:49.202 --> 28:51.463
And so I don't want it to be a surprise.

28:51.943 --> 28:57.125
So I'm going to present it here very cursorily and, and, and, uh,

28:57.745 --> 29:05.255
from a broad perspective with a basic cartoon so that people can understand the point that I'm making and the potential opportunity that's there.

29:05.815 --> 29:13.905
So first of all, let's go back to this picture again and remember that the actual excess deaths that we're talking about with murder and lies is actually not that big.

29:15.874 --> 29:21.638
When they showed it to us like this on the PBS News Hour, it looked like, wow, look at all that's thousands.

29:22.179 --> 29:38.451
But then when you put it in the context of between 70 and 55,000 Americans dying every week, because we have a pretty big population and almost 3 million people die every year, then the actual increase is not quite as dramatic.

29:38.491 --> 29:44.816
And so you don't need to explain millions of deaths like the NIH would like you to believe.

29:45.356 --> 29:54.643
You don't need to explain millions of deaths like a lot of these so-called dissidents like even Robert Malone or Meryl Nass would like you to believe.

29:55.123 --> 29:56.845
I think even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:57.345 --> 30:05.291
would probably tell you that more than a million people in America were killed by COVID, and that is wrong.

30:05.431 --> 30:09.034
Those people were almost exclusively murdered and lied about.

30:10.012 --> 30:29.208
And the opportunity that the population pyramid presents in America is the same problem that people were talking about with regard to Medicare and the coming impending bankruptcy of it and that system already a decade ago.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.130
And so where does that fit here?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.247
That fits right here.

30:33.347 --> 30:52.873
So the population pyramid, in case you're unaware, is a graph where you have the total number of people on the x-axis going away from zero, and two big numbers this way, like that.

30:53.633 --> 30:56.574
And this is males and females.

30:57.833 --> 31:01.036
And then going up this way, you have age.

31:01.877 --> 31:03.598
Whoops, I started looking at the camera there.

31:04.539 --> 31:05.860
That's funny.

31:06.461 --> 31:07.221
You have age.

31:07.281 --> 31:12.726
And so you can make a graph, you can make a shape of a pyramid for a population and describe how it is.

31:13.287 --> 31:18.291
Now, typically, you can imagine at the top where people are 100 years old, if this is 100.

31:20.503 --> 31:24.187
then there are very few males and maybe a little more females, right?

31:24.267 --> 31:24.948
Could be like that.

31:25.369 --> 31:28.752
And then the population pyramid might just go down like this.

31:29.613 --> 31:30.895
And so you have a lot of kids.

31:31.496 --> 31:33.238
And then as people get older, they die.

31:34.653 --> 31:34.873
Right?

31:34.953 --> 31:39.915
That's what a population pyramid might look like in a standard country like Mexico.

31:40.595 --> 31:44.916
If we, and if anybody has any trouble with this, there's lots of stuff on the internet.

31:44.936 --> 31:47.377
These are all bars of different ages, right?

31:47.877 --> 31:52.939
And these are men on this, are females on this side and males on this side.

31:54.306 --> 31:58.287
and just imagining what the population pyramid looks like.

31:58.327 --> 32:00.948
And then if you add this all up, it would be all the people in the country.

32:01.629 --> 32:10.632
So we can make this population pyramid to reflect a number of different sort of states of a Western-type country.

32:11.332 --> 32:17.154
And a country like Japan might actually look a bit more like this.

32:24.454 --> 32:30.636
where the population is distributed in such a way so that at the top, they actually have a lot of hundred year olds.

32:31.856 --> 32:34.517
And there's a lot of people after retirement age.

32:35.578 --> 32:38.118
And a lot of these young people really live to be very old.

32:38.179 --> 32:39.919
It's almost like not a pyramid anymore.

32:42.580 --> 32:48.482
And so now I want you to imagine what happens if, for example, through history,

32:49.807 --> 32:55.070
You could watch how Japan changed from this to this.

32:56.511 --> 33:03.736
What you would see is this transition from a pyramid to kind of a bump.

33:04.336 --> 33:15.904
You could even imagine a scenario in a country like America where a period of prosperity, you know, maybe like after World War II or something like that, might result in a

33:18.348 --> 33:34.279
what was a normal pyramid having a little bump in it where the elderly population right here we might call these people I don't know what could we name these people we call them something funny like maybe the the baby boomers

33:36.806 --> 33:39.487
because they had a lot of kids after they came back from World War II.

33:39.547 --> 33:45.310
So there was this little population spike and it never really normalized into the population pyramid.

33:45.770 --> 33:57.036
Now I want you to imagine what would happen if this little bump was kind of timed so that the bump was approaching the sort of natural age of death.

33:59.657 --> 34:01.378
Let's say the natural age of death is 80.

34:03.140 --> 34:25.414
And so when the baby boomer generation gets to around 80, we should expect all-cause mortality in America to kind of spike a little bit, just like births spiked all the way back after World War II, like probably college applications spiked as these kids became college age, as the

34:26.866 --> 34:35.673
Do you see as the car sales spiked when these people, you see, when their kids became six, do you see what happens here?

34:37.854 --> 34:53.946
The population pyramid may have provided the perfect opportunity, the perfect opportunity to cry very, very vigorously about, oh my gosh, there's so many old people dying and it's continuing into the future.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.008
It's still happening now.

34:58.590 --> 35:17.081
But what if it was always expected to happen because the baby boomer generation represents a population spike in a pyramid, in a pyramid that was already destined to become a little bit like Japan, but because of the baby boomer generation actually has an additional little bump here.

35:17.461 --> 35:18.982
And how big does the bump need to be?

35:19.022 --> 35:26.347
It doesn't really need to be that big for the bump to create something like this using murder and lies.

35:28.871 --> 35:31.132
because it doesn't have to be all murder and lies.

35:31.232 --> 35:51.979
It can be a combination of a lot of old people and murder and lies and also opiates and ventilators and remdesivir and midazolam and the lack of use of antibiotics to treat what would normally be treated as pneumonia is always treated with antibiotics because you have people all around the internet saying that there's such thing as a viral pneumonia.

35:54.983 --> 36:10.049
The Population Pyramid provided an inverted opportunity, if you will, to complain about something of excess deaths, when excess deaths don't actually tell you anything if you don't know very much about the Population Pyramid.

36:11.190 --> 36:23.415
And now I would like to hear from Denny Rancourt about how the Population Pyramid of America was expected to impact all-cause mortality in the coming five years, and whether or not this

36:24.352 --> 36:30.456
This could have just been an orchestrated use of an already expected increase over the next four or five years.

36:31.176 --> 36:44.565
But this use doesn't require Medicaid to pay for their last six months of life anymore, which was between half a million and a million dollars each back when they were worried about it in the 90s.

36:48.471 --> 36:54.192
Anyway, that's the reason why Robert Malone didn't come out until 2021.

36:54.732 --> 37:09.876
Before that, he was busy with delaying our revelations and making sure that our old people and that bump in the population pyramid was taken advantage of and made sure that nobody interpreted it any other way than, oh my gosh, what a crisis.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.823
Don't let an opportunity go to waste, they would say.

37:14.203 --> 37:19.086
And I would suggest that this is a pretty big opportunity right here, this little baby boomer bump.

37:20.047 --> 37:21.648
Go do the research for yourself.

37:22.088 --> 37:23.909
The actual data is there.

37:23.969 --> 37:26.971
You can find that that's what was what expected to come.

37:28.292 --> 37:38.639
And you don't think people like Tony Fauci and Francis Collins would have known that was coming if they have been planning for over a generation to eventually invert our sovereignty to test subject status?

37:40.333 --> 37:43.915
Please, ladies and gentlemen, see the huge opportunity that was there.

37:44.315 --> 37:47.917
And the fact of the matter is this guy has been part of this for decades.

37:48.477 --> 37:52.899
And that's why he came out as a fake, a fake hero.

37:53.059 --> 37:56.401
I think that's why a lot of people are probably fake heroes.

37:56.461 --> 38:00.223
Another one that I'm a little concerned about is James Lyons Wyler.

38:02.927 --> 38:07.649
The reason why I'm concerned about him is because he was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the beginning of the pandemic.

38:07.689 --> 38:19.834
And he wrote a blog in February of 2020 as a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh, apparently with some kind of weird appointment about the fear and cleavage site and about how that meant it was a lab leak.

38:22.055 --> 38:29.098
I didn't understand how he would know, but I guess he was a real smart guy, but he wouldn't talk to me until he moved to Michigan a year later.

38:31.553 --> 38:49.393
Now what I find really strange about him is that he wrote a book before the pandemic called The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism, which gets me real fired up because I think the whole idea of genetic causes of autism is

38:52.364 --> 39:01.993
is a semantic enchantment that is designed to bamboozle all of academia into believing there can't really be any environmental causes.

39:02.053 --> 39:06.778
And environmental causes are much more difficult to chase down and much more variable for each kid.

39:07.218 --> 39:09.440
So we might as well focus on the low-hanging fruit.

39:09.861 --> 39:14.325
And since I'm an academic biologist and I need grants, I might as well focus on those genetic fruits.

39:18.203 --> 39:28.491
And so wouldn't it be really curious if we were to roll back in time and go back to 2019 and find James Lyons Weiler advocating for genetic testing of kids to make the vaccine schedule safer?

39:28.911 --> 39:30.132
Wouldn't that be weird?

39:30.192 --> 39:45.203
Because he was on stage three times at the Children's Health Defense conferences that I've been to, on stage alone with the spotlight, plugging his own work and his own organizations and his own nonprofits.

39:46.504 --> 39:47.305
Listen carefully.

39:49.611 --> 39:53.954
Hi, I'm Dr. James Lyons-Weiler from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Institute for Peer and Applied Knowledge.

39:53.994 --> 40:00.959
I came here at the request of people who wanted to help educate the Ways and Means Committee on the epidemiology of measles and infectious diseases.

40:10.585 --> 40:18.893
with respect to the bill being considered to remove personal belief exemptions, medical and religious exemptions.

40:19.814 --> 40:28.341
And, you know, I only had two minutes to speak, and so what I didn't get to tell the committee, and I'm grateful to be able to speak right now, is that

40:29.362 --> 40:34.067
There are some 35 to 40,000 families in Oregon who do not vaccinate.

40:34.587 --> 40:43.375
That population is enriched for risk factors for vaccine injury because many of them do not vaccinate because of prior experience with

40:44.236 --> 40:47.200
bad outcomes from vaccination.

40:47.580 --> 41:02.258
Now, the CDC thinks that a seizure is, says that a seizure is a mild, non-serious adverse reaction, but a parent that sees their child undergo a seizure, develop seizure disorder, and maybe die after multiple seizures.

41:02.919 --> 41:16.542
Really, we have a unique situation in Oregon where these 35,000 to 40,000 families represent a self-selected subtype of the population that may be enriched for biomarkers for vaccine injury.

41:17.042 --> 41:28.425
And so, what I think we should be talking about is how do we canvas the population and do studies to look at their genetics to see if there's an increased risk of vaccine injury

41:29.665 --> 41:35.669
that we can then use as prospective biomarkers to predict who would come out with a bad outcome from vaccinations.

41:36.650 --> 41:38.731
Canvas the population?

41:38.751 --> 41:45.455
This is April of 2019.

41:48.456 --> 41:54.240
Canvas the population so that we can make the vaccine schedule safe.

41:57.037 --> 41:59.702
All about the biology of vaccines right here, right?

42:00.323 --> 42:06.775
Really close to saying intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, right?

42:08.866 --> 42:10.207
it's spectacular.

42:28.439 --> 42:28.919
Some.

42:28.959 --> 42:29.720
Some families.

42:49.975 --> 43:10.636
biomarkers biomarkers years developing biomarkers for the efficacy of treatments in cancer that's rational that's it's weird right because he's doing biomarkers just like claire craig was doing biomarkers before she started and she was also a pathologist and it's weird right because this all plays into this motivation

43:11.116 --> 43:31.930
which is codified in all these books that we are talking about all the time where oh my gosh they have been meaning to test everybody for so long because it's finally time for us to pull our big boy pants on and take control of our own evolution and that's why Brett Weinstein equals James Lyon Weiner

43:32.913 --> 43:41.447
equals Robert Malone, equals Robert F. Kennedy Jr., equals Merrill Nass, equals oh my goodness, where are we going now?

43:45.742 --> 43:48.866
precision medicine, and we really need to start thinking about this.

43:50.267 --> 43:56.815
We have 35,000, that's rational, that's precision medicine, and we really need to start thinking about this.

43:58.217 --> 44:01.661
We have 35,000 ex-vaccinating families.

44:01.681 --> 44:02.822
They're not anti-vaxxers.

44:03.923 --> 44:07.724
former pro-vaxxers who stopped vaccinating due to vaccine injury.

44:08.064 --> 44:12.285
And given that they're enriched for that risk, there's a really good, unique opportunity here.

44:12.625 --> 44:17.326
So I'm happy to say that Dr. Paul Thomas and I are doing vaccinated versus unvaccinated studies.

44:17.366 --> 44:20.247
He's a local pediatrician here who's extremely ethical.

44:20.547 --> 44:24.628
He follows the federal guidelines for informed choice, informed consent.

44:24.708 --> 44:26.969
And as long as this guy represents him,

44:28.322 --> 44:36.950
then there's always gonna be somebody saying that there's a genetic component and we owe it to ourselves and the kids of the future to find those genetic components.

44:38.691 --> 44:53.624
The doctor that he's talking about could be a great guy and could have all the data that shows that vaccines are dumb, that combinations of substances injected intramuscularly to augment the immune system is just dumb, it doesn't work, it hurts a lot of kids.

44:54.568 --> 44:58.411
They could have all that data, but still, who's he publishing it with?

44:59.071 --> 45:02.013
Who will the paper be withdrawn with?

45:02.553 --> 45:04.575
Who will the paper be represented by?

45:06.736 --> 45:18.644
As long as most of the time it's represented by him and he's advocating for this and how he's been working on biomarkers for his whole career, our children are test subjects.

45:19.844 --> 45:28.472
So he has people in his practice that vaccinate, do not vaccinate, and sometimes vaccinate.

45:28.492 --> 45:40.884
And what I hear a lot today from the people that showed up yesterday at the rally is I hear that this- I mean, think about the idea that that guy, Paul Thomas, never really became famous with CHD until only last year, I think.

45:40.984 --> 45:41.464
Look it up.

45:42.265 --> 45:43.746
This is 2019.

45:43.806 --> 45:47.790
You'd think that, you know, within a few months, they're going to have all that data, right?

45:47.830 --> 45:52.593
Because they didn't need the data from the last two years if they're taking it from a practice.

45:56.476 --> 45:59.339
Do you, you can even see the titration in real time.

45:59.379 --> 46:04.803
You can see that he's stepping in front of Paul Thomas, making sure that the, the paper takes long enough.

46:04.843 --> 46:07.005
And then when it came out, it finally got retracted.

46:12.907 --> 46:13.208
Wow.

46:15.393 --> 46:15.934
I'm stunned.

46:15.954 --> 46:17.597
I mean, I never even watched this whole video.

46:17.638 --> 46:19.882
I just knew that from the first minute that it was good.

46:20.263 --> 46:23.410
Oh, I got to go back because I want to finish that video.

46:23.570 --> 46:23.791
Sorry.

46:26.609 --> 46:34.456
What I hear a lot today from the people that showed up yesterday at the rally is I hear that this is a matter of freedom, a matter of choice, a matter of liberty.

46:36.158 --> 46:37.299
And that's absolutely true.

46:37.399 --> 46:40.942
So for those people who want to take a vaccine, they can take a vaccine.

46:41.923 --> 46:45.146
For those people who don't want to take a vaccine, they should have the right to opt.

46:45.446 --> 46:49.610
Imagine if the government was telling you to shoot yourself in the foot.

46:51.946 --> 46:58.111
And you thought that it's fine to tell people, well, you know, if you want to shoot yourself in the foot, go ahead.

47:00.633 --> 47:09.760
Even though the government is telling you, you should shoot yourself in the foot and telling doctors to tell parents to shoot their kids in the foot.

47:12.304 --> 47:17.750
Your way of saying, I don't want this to happen to other kids is to say, you know, it's up to parents.

47:17.810 --> 47:33.868
I just want parents to be able to freely choose whether to follow the bad advice of the government to shoot themselves in the foot or their kids in the foot, or, you know, better yet, the doctors following the advice of the government telling the parents to shoot their kids in the foot.

47:35.987 --> 47:37.910
And that's the best he can do.

47:38.390 --> 47:42.076
Not just simply say, you know what, shooting your kids in the foot's pretty stupid.

47:42.536 --> 47:43.137
Don't do that.

47:44.218 --> 47:50.207
And your doctor should be smart enough, should know enough about gunshot wounds to know not to shoot your kid in the foot.

47:53.976 --> 47:55.717
That's how mealy-mouthed this is.

47:55.777 --> 47:57.359
That's how malevolent this is.

47:57.419 --> 48:07.707
That's how dangerous it is right now, ladies and gentlemen, because the limited spectrum of debate is multidimensional and has been curated before the pandemic.

48:11.853 --> 48:13.495
on the basis of their own personal choice.

48:13.816 --> 48:25.571
The last thing that I want to say is, like pertussis and like the mumps, there is strong science that shows that measles infections, once you get a group of kids with measles in a population,

48:26.472 --> 48:32.135
46 to 70% of the transmissions that occur, occur from people who have no symptoms whatsoever.

48:32.535 --> 48:36.477
Like the mumps, like pertussis, you end up with asymptomatic infections.

48:36.517 --> 48:41.019
These are carriers that bring the measles into the school without any symptoms whatsoever.

48:41.459 --> 48:44.661
And if we think about it for a moment, that means that we need unvaccinated.

48:44.781 --> 48:47.442
I'm sorry, but I did not see this part and I'm shocked.

48:47.542 --> 48:53.325
He's actually talking about asymptomatic transmission of measles and other

48:54.125 --> 49:03.509
viruses by vaccinated people, and he's talking about it months before the pandemic, when again, these issues would become paramount.

49:03.569 --> 49:16.574
When again, in February, somehow or another, he knows that the fear and cleavage site is going to be a key piece of evidence that people are going to debate for a whole year about whether or not it's a laboratory created virus or just unlucky.

49:19.608 --> 49:23.552
I mean, I don't think that this is serendipitous.

49:23.632 --> 49:33.301
I don't think that he just happens to be a clever guy who stumbled upon things, like a Simpsons writer just happened to make the right cartoon about the right escalator.

49:40.185 --> 49:53.195
kids in the schools to identify that there's a school with a transmission chain so that the kids with who are immunocompromised can know that those families can know that they need to take special steps to make sure that their kid doesn't get exposed to measles.

49:53.695 --> 50:00.480
And that is the ultimate irony here is that this legislation would remove these kids from school, schools will

50:00.660 --> 50:04.021
still have, every three to four years, measles will come into the United States.

50:04.341 --> 50:07.183
That's the natural epidemiologic cycle of the measles virus.

50:07.643 --> 50:18.527
It'll come into the United States, we'll have asymptomatic transmission, but nobody's going to be in a school to know that we have a transmission chain putting immunocompromised kids at increased risk.

50:18.947 --> 50:24.690
You can check out my research on these matters and other matters at IPAknowledge.org.

50:25.450 --> 50:26.891
I want to thank you for your time.

50:30.041 --> 50:31.122
It's just spectacular.

50:31.162 --> 50:34.745
We need unvaccinated kids to be canaries in the coal mine.

50:34.886 --> 50:41.752
Otherwise, we will have rampant asymptomatic transmission of all of these diseases regularly going on behind the scenes.

50:41.812 --> 50:54.003
I mean, I can hear the rationale for testing everyone, every other sentence he's talking about, whether it's talking about biomarkers or whether he's talking about asymptomatic transmission of vaccinated diseases.

50:54.563 --> 51:23.320
in order to make sure that the immunocompromised people who can't take vaccines or the people with the special gene background that make them genetically predisposed to vaccine damage can be saved from measles by the... This is one of the people that CHD promotes as an expert because you can go back to the last two conferences they put on and he was one of the headline speakers at both over a couple days.

51:28.055 --> 51:31.876
This is one of the experts that would share the stage with Meryl Nass.

51:33.276 --> 51:40.198
This is one of the experts that they put up there with that Humphreys lady who knows much more about what she's talking about than him.

51:43.079 --> 51:46.560
But he got three times on stage over two conferences and she got one.

51:54.034 --> 51:54.175
you

52:05.748 --> 52:09.290
This was before he helped Paul Thomas do the Unvaxed Vax Study.

52:09.310 --> 52:11.972
He just mentioned it there though, that he was working on that.

52:12.492 --> 52:24.821
And so what I think is happening there, what you see is that he got in front of him, he coordinated that with CHD, and then over a few years, they gradually got to the stage where they could show everybody that data.

52:24.841 --> 52:27.662
But of course they had that data in 2017.

52:30.905 --> 52:31.585
Why did they know?

52:31.605 --> 52:34.387
Well, because they had the movie vaxed out already then.

52:35.512 --> 52:44.496
If you look back and see how long it has taken since the original movie Vaxxed was released to get to where we are now, it's almost laughable.

52:45.896 --> 52:49.758
They were talking about the movie Vaxxed on Good Morning America for shit's sake.

52:51.218 --> 52:53.859
And you're telling me that that opportunity was just blown?

52:56.000 --> 53:01.362
That Mary Holland was able to get on Democracy Now, but that opportunity was just blown?

53:01.843 --> 53:02.683
It wasn't blown.

53:04.724 --> 53:15.572
This has been a decade-long titration of the truth to eventually where, after they're ready, they can tell you, as part of the controlled demolition of America, that, yeah, the vaccine schedule was always pretty shitty.

53:15.952 --> 53:20.996
Too bad we can fix it with precision medicine, like was described in 2019 by James Lyons Weiler.

53:25.748 --> 53:32.072
I want to give a big shout out to Grace's dad because he's one of the few people that actually has a lawsuit and lost a daughter.

53:32.092 --> 53:35.935
I haven't lost a kid to COVID, thank God.

53:40.658 --> 53:52.846
But I definitely haven't lost a kid to protocols like Grace's dad did and many other people like Leslie Batts and some of the other people that Mark Kulak has talked to.

53:54.980 --> 54:07.448
And so I wanna watch this stream because it is about a Tucker Carlson interview with a brother and sister duo that I tried desperately to ignore.

54:07.809 --> 54:11.211
Everybody was like, oh my gosh, look at this man, you have to cover this.

54:12.132 --> 54:15.014
And I watched the video and I just didn't buy it.

54:15.614 --> 54:20.217
I didn't buy it, but I also didn't see what Grace's dad sees.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.920
And I think what I wanna take from Grace's dad's

54:26.550 --> 54:34.614
from Grace's dad's tact, if you will, how he goes about doing this, is he uses the word deception, and he uses it often.

54:34.694 --> 54:35.554
I use lies.

54:36.395 --> 54:43.018
And for whatever reason, lies is a more abrasive term, and deception is what it really is.

54:43.058 --> 54:44.939
It's a very complex illusion.

54:46.013 --> 54:47.534
And so we are being deceived.

54:48.254 --> 54:56.917
It's by highly skilled and coordinated magicians, that's what we are, with the finest technologies at their disposal.

54:57.197 --> 55:06.521
And that includes the informed consent, the lack of, the full consent of us every time we are scrolling like this.

55:06.801 --> 55:10.443
And so I think Grace's dad is really good at,

55:11.815 --> 55:12.776
at deprogramming.

55:13.536 --> 55:17.279
And so I just thought it would be nice to just watch his stream here.

55:17.379 --> 55:18.320
It's like an hour long.

55:19.180 --> 55:27.506
I don't know if we'll make it through the whole thing, but I will try very hard and I will try as often as possible not to interrupt and hopefully just let him speak.

55:27.926 --> 55:28.807
It's very interesting.

55:28.847 --> 55:35.952
Again, it's about this Tucker Carlson interview with these two brother and sisters with a book to sell.

55:39.935 --> 55:40.315
Good morning.

55:40.714 --> 55:42.616
Today is Wednesday, September 4th.

55:42.636 --> 55:43.957
And my name is Scott Sciarra.

55:44.077 --> 55:45.118
I am Grace's dad.

55:45.258 --> 55:49.222
And today we have quite a presentation to go through.

55:49.242 --> 55:52.325
And it came about a couple of weeks ago.

55:52.425 --> 55:54.647
I'll share that after we get to the opening slide.

55:54.707 --> 55:55.228
Go ahead, Dom.

55:55.248 --> 55:56.549
Let's just pull up the opening slide.

55:56.569 --> 55:58.130
It's called The Devil in Disguise.

55:58.191 --> 56:02.094
And you can see all these pictures that I put together for the cover.

56:02.334 --> 56:05.958
And you'll kind of get a sense as to where we're going with this.

56:06.485 --> 56:17.944
But before we get into the slide deck, let's go to the second slide, Don, because the reason I'm here is because my best buddy, Grace, who had Down syndrome, she was murdered in a hospital.

56:19.261 --> 56:19.641
13th of 2021.

56:20.122 --> 56:31.169
And I picked these two pictures because first of all, we have a lawsuit, one of the first wrongful death cases for this type of abuse in a hospital setting.

56:31.930 --> 56:37.614
And I often get asked, what was my hair color like before we hired a legal team?

56:37.754 --> 56:39.135
And that's the picture on the left.

56:39.675 --> 56:45.199
And the picture on the right, we're going to tie it back at the end because Grace was quite an Elvis fan.

56:45.996 --> 56:51.578
And this is her in front of a crowd singing Love Me Tender dressed up as Elvis.

56:52.538 --> 56:55.299
She was, she was pretty, pretty special gal.

56:56.059 --> 56:56.839
Miss her terribly.

56:57.339 --> 56:58.840
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

57:02.801 --> 57:05.422
So we're going to find out how

57:06.525 --> 57:07.425
This all works.

57:07.546 --> 57:08.766
Deception runs deep.

57:08.846 --> 57:11.668
What false prophets look like in real life?

57:11.748 --> 57:13.268
And there's a lot of them running around.

57:14.109 --> 57:16.490
Most of them, I believe, unwittingly.

57:17.210 --> 57:22.253
And I'll explain that as we go to the open slide for this presentation.

57:22.513 --> 57:26.715
Let's go to the next slide to set up the stage from a biblical perspective.

57:27.155 --> 57:34.919
Jesus said in Matthew 24, 24, for false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive

57:35.559 --> 57:37.944
if possible, even the elect.

57:38.384 --> 57:47.480
And if you look at Exodus chapter 7, you will see that Satan can imitate God and perform all kinds of things that we would

57:48.112 --> 57:51.214
look at as miracles, but they're not in the name of God.

57:51.254 --> 57:53.956
They're not in the name of God's Son, Jesus Christ.

57:54.956 --> 57:57.278
They're for the purpose of deceiving.

57:57.338 --> 57:59.099
So it's not surprising this is happening.

57:59.159 --> 58:00.440
It's happening in the Old Testament.

58:00.820 --> 58:02.141
It's on steroids today.

58:02.741 --> 58:08.285
And we're going to drill down an example that most people were duped by.

58:08.365 --> 58:14.709
In fact, several podcast hosts that I have seen comment on the same, Tucker Carlson,

58:15.892 --> 58:17.833
I don't know what it would be called.

58:17.873 --> 58:24.157
It was a two-hour presentation on the medical industrial establishment.

58:24.257 --> 58:29.480
Most of them bought into, in fact, everyone that I saw bought into the narrative that they're selling.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.642
All right, so let's go to the slide five, Don.

58:35.476 --> 58:46.371
And what we're going to do here is we're going to break down this Tucker Carlson interview with these two people claiming that they have the solution to America's health crisis.

58:46.471 --> 58:52.599
And I'm not saying anything bad about the three of these, you know, Tucker or Casey or Callie here.

58:53.583 --> 58:57.765
They're just likely unwitting participants in Satan's long game.

58:57.845 --> 58:59.026
That's the way that I see it.

59:00.107 --> 59:12.373
And what we're gonna do is take this interview and break it down into several segments and then see how deception works and how we can be ultimately prepared so that we're not deceived.

59:12.773 --> 59:17.976
All right, so let's play the clip that goes with this slide, Don, as the introduction.

59:21.809 --> 59:36.081
Sibling team Casey and Callie means joined the Tucker Carlson show a few days ago to discuss the disturbing trend of sick care in North America They discussed everything from the toxic food supply and pharmaceutical industry to the corrupted, right?

59:36.261 --> 59:47.410
So the first thing I'm gonna interrupt and say is that notice this is I believe in Australian news source But it's definitely not American and it has international Meddling with it.

59:47.551 --> 59:47.751
So

59:49.870 --> 59:55.116
Already you have this foreign component, which I don't like.

59:56.277 --> 01:00:03.524
Tucker Carlson is being used around the world in different ways, depending on, again, where your narrative was.

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:08.950
The people in Australia have a very different feeling for what went on than what happened

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:13.115
in America because they believe that the lockdown saved them from the first waves.

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:17.420
And so depending on where this is being broadcast, it has a different tint.

01:00:18.061 --> 01:00:22.606
And see, I want to remind you of that, especially because they're using this Rebel News.

01:00:23.427 --> 01:00:24.809
Oh, it's Canadian, sorry.

01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:35.035
regulators that let them get away with putting profits over real health and wellness, generating lifelong customers instead of incentivizing cures.

01:00:35.575 --> 01:00:44.826
Casey is a former Stanford Medical School trained surgeon and co-founder of Levels, a health technology company aiming to reverse the global metabolic health crisis.

01:00:45.407 --> 01:00:59.670
With a BA in honors and an MD from Stanford, where she also served on the faculty, Casey left a thriving career in conventional medicine to focus on addressing the root causes of America's skyrocketing health issues.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:07.592
Her brother, Callie, is a Harvard Business School grad with firsthand experience in how corrupt the food and pharma industries are.

01:01:07.992 --> 01:01:13.713
He co-founded TruMed, a company dedicated to enabling Americans to purchase healthy food tax-free.

01:01:15.623 --> 01:01:16.704
I'm calling that the setup.

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:21.467
Of course, we have Tucker Carlson, a podcaster in the business worldwide.

01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:24.529
And then we have a Stanford Harvard grad.

01:01:25.009 --> 01:01:27.250
So you'd think, OK, this is going to be great.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.452
They are going to lay out some major truth for us.

01:01:30.712 --> 01:01:32.413
And this is how Satan works.

01:01:32.453 --> 01:01:39.258
Satan isn't standing outside of a church or a building that is satanic.

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:44.140
with a red suit and a pitchfork warning us as to what's going to happen.

01:01:44.761 --> 01:01:46.422
It's through a deception.

01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:56.407
And this sets up the second deception, which will go to the next slide, Don, is that Satan always weaves truth in with lies.

01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:58.969
So some truth is the enemy of the truth.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.370
And let's play the clip that's related to the slide, Don.

01:02:02.509 --> 01:02:02.589
and

01:02:17.927 --> 01:02:18.527
if you had obesity.

01:02:18.587 --> 01:02:20.309
Sideshow fat, yeah, was so unusual.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.410
It was so unusual.

01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:29.039
It is now 74% of our country, 77% of young adults are unfit to serve in the military because of these issues like obesity.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.701
Now let's talk about diabetes. 50%.

01:02:32.703 --> 01:02:46.130
a full 50 percent of American adults have pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes which is a fundamental issue in how ourselves, half the country Tucker, have pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes and 30 percent of teens now have pre-diabetes.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:51.113
This was a condition that no pediatrician would have seen in their lifetime 50 years ago.

01:02:51.473 --> 01:02:52.813
One percent of Americans in 1950s

01:02:54.094 --> 01:02:55.475
in 1950 had type 2 diabetes.

01:02:55.835 --> 01:03:02.017
We have 18% of teens with fatty liver disease, a disease that used to be in late stage alcoholics.

01:03:02.097 --> 01:03:05.418
Cancer rates are skyrocketing in the young and the elderly.

01:03:06.058 --> 01:03:08.279
Young adult cancers are up 79%.

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:13.360
And this is the first year in American history we're estimated to have over 2 million cases of cancer.

01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:17.882
25% of American women are on an antidepressant medication

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:21.824
40% of 18-year-olds have a mental health diagnosis.

01:03:21.884 --> 01:03:31.110
We have the highest infant and maternal mortality rate in the entire developed world, despite sending 2x on infant and maternal care than any other country.

01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:37.875
So you have a higher risk of dying as a woman giving birth in America than any other developed country in the world.

01:03:38.355 --> 01:03:42.697
Autism rates in kids are 1 in 36 nationally.

01:03:42.737 --> 01:03:45.198
This was 1 in 1,500 in the year 2000.

01:03:45.798 --> 01:03:47.799
And the screening has not changed.

01:03:48.019 --> 01:03:59.063
Forces that are creating slow, progressive illness starting now in fetal life that allow patients to be profitable and on the pharma treadmill for their entire lives.

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.624
They make us sick, but they don't kill us.

01:04:00.984 --> 01:04:02.244
And then we are drugged for life.

01:04:04.145 --> 01:04:07.646
So I'm going to assume every one of her facts is true.

01:04:07.726 --> 01:04:09.406
I know, I'm familiar with many of them.

01:04:09.866 --> 01:04:16.968
And this is how we get sucked into things that are deception.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:25.190
Satan did this first in Genesis chapter three, when he deceived Adam and Eve, when he said, did God really say that was the first deception?

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:31.571
And then the first lie, which he combined some truth, but not the truth when he said,

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:38.144
by partaking in this fruit, you can be like God, knowing the difference between good and evil.

01:04:38.665 --> 01:04:44.174
So while that is partially true, it's not all the way true because Satan could never

01:04:47.264 --> 01:04:48.965
can only know evil and less evil.

01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:56.568
All right, so then one particular statistic that I'm going to take issue with her on is the subject of the next slide, Don.

01:04:56.608 --> 01:05:02.130
You can move to that, which is she said 50% of the country has prediabetes.

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:05.811
And that's simply flat out not true, and this clip proves it.

01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:06.331
Go ahead, Don.

01:05:06.692 --> 01:05:06.952
Nice.

01:05:07.472 --> 01:05:08.712
Went to the doctor to get checked out.

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:09.993
He said, everything's really good.

01:05:10.013 --> 01:05:12.734
He goes, I do want to let you know, though, you are prediabetic.

01:05:14.073 --> 01:05:15.234
And I was like, oh, all right.

01:05:16.915 --> 01:05:17.656
Who isn't, right?

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:25.062
Why would you even tell me that?

01:05:27.764 --> 01:05:28.825
Do I have diabetes?

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:29.845
He goes, no.

01:05:32.608 --> 01:05:34.009
But I could get diabetes?

01:05:34.249 --> 01:05:35.210
He goes, yes.

01:05:37.231 --> 01:05:37.772
OK.

01:05:41.995 --> 01:05:43.076
Do you have diabetes?

01:05:46.038 --> 01:05:46.719
He goes, no.

01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:49.281
I go, but could you get diabetes?

01:05:52.503 --> 01:05:53.324
He said, I guess so.

01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:55.286
I go, let me tell you something, you're pre-diabetic.

01:05:58.045 --> 01:06:00.586
You know, laughter is good for the soul.

01:06:01.186 --> 01:06:05.127
And Grace, she had quite a sense of humor.

01:06:05.148 --> 01:06:07.888
And it took me about a year after her death to get mine back.

01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:09.509
And it's back.

01:06:09.909 --> 01:06:13.650
And I'm glad to weave in a few things in a serious podcast now and then.

01:06:15.051 --> 01:06:19.752
Hopefully, I remember the other one that I thought of for this podcast later on.

01:06:19.772 --> 01:06:21.373
All right, let's go to slide eight, Don.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:46.372
So an easy way to get people into the less evil trap and be on your side is to use boogeyman and to use subtle lies and blaming and then throw in the boogeyman and you've got people in the less evil trap and on your side almost exclusively.

01:06:46.432 --> 01:06:47.833
It seems like no one's awake to this.

01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:53.196
So let's play this next clip down and it will show this in a very distinct way.

01:06:54.465 --> 01:07:13.120
You know, we're debating on the margins right now, on the left and the right, about how to change page 300 of Medicare Part D. Unless we're attacking the core incentive that was embedded by Obamacare, which was probably the deadliest law passed in recent history, what Obamacare did is it ingrained the incentive that the medical system makes more money when people get sicker.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:21.766
Where did all these pesticides that have destroyed our life-giving soil and are creating a fragile food system, which is going to create a food crisis at some point, where did they all come from?

01:07:21.946 --> 01:07:22.927
Nazi Germany, right?

01:07:24.228 --> 01:07:30.670
Hitler was developing chemicals of war and trying to create agriculture solutions to create more food yields for Germany.

01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:38.553
And some of these pesticides, these organophosphate chemicals, were turned directly into sprays that were putting on all our food.

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:45.636
The interrelationship between Nazi Germany and what's being sprayed on every piece of food in the United States is deeply linked, and we need to think about that.

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:46.416
Right.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.556
15 percent of that.

01:07:47.676 --> 01:07:51.938
One other thing I just want to say, this is being federally subsidized by the government to the farm bills.

01:07:51.978 --> 01:07:59.159
We haven't spoken about the farm bills, but you think about this funneling of money that's happening and how the government in a way is working against us.

01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:00.820
And I don't think it's nefarious at all.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.240
I think people just don't understand.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.901
We've talked to so many Congress people.

01:08:03.921 --> 01:08:08.522
They just don't understand the health effects of all these things that are happening.

01:08:10.017 --> 01:08:11.759
So Congress doesn't understand.

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:12.880
It's not nefarious.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.121
I mean, that's laughable.

01:08:14.181 --> 01:08:23.609
I'm going to comment on that because I've spent many, many podcasts commenting about where our government fits in this overall psyop that we're living through.

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:26.231
But blaming Obamacare, blaming the Nazis.

01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:27.432
Let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:08:27.472 --> 01:08:28.713
I want to share some facts.

01:08:30.158 --> 01:08:37.223
Relative to Obamacare, I've shared this before, Section 1553 authorized euthanizing our population.

01:08:38.284 --> 01:08:41.846
Eugenics, so we blame the Nazis for eugenics.

01:08:42.066 --> 01:08:49.051
Hitler himself said, there is today one state in which at least weak beginnings toward a better conception are noticeable.

01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:53.494
Of course, it is not our model German Republic, but the American Union.

01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:59.738
This picture below the Hitler quote is from 1929 at the Kansas Fair in Topeka, Kansas.

01:09:00.478 --> 01:09:03.781
and they were having a eugenics contest already in 1920.

01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:05.722
Can you read this bottom thing?

01:09:05.782 --> 01:09:26.777
It says here, it says here, the winners of the fitter family contest, winners of a fitter family contest stand outside the eugenics building at Kansas Free Fair in Topeka, Kansas, where families are registered for the contests, judging which family was most likely to produce good children.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:35.233
This is the same group of people from which all of these vaccinologists descend.

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:38.355
The same group of people that wrote this book.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:44.139
The same group of people that, the same guy that wrote this book.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:46.260
The same guy that wrote this book.

01:09:47.621 --> 01:09:57.607
They're all the same people that think that it's our duty as a species to put our big boy pants on and take control of our evolution.

01:10:00.109 --> 01:10:08.252
At this time, it was still considered normal to talk about it and consider the possibility that some people just should be sterilized for the betterment of the future.

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:17.074
Not at all dissimilar from what is always in history attributed exclusively to Hitler and the Nazis.

01:10:18.095 --> 01:10:27.878
As if there weren't significant numbers of people in the United States, rich people advocating for exactly the same kind of

01:10:30.512 --> 01:10:55.026
behavior you want to read books about it read these two books about it the war against the weak that's this one by edwin black and you want to read another book it's called the oxford handbook of the history of eugenics these two books they're uh pretty hard to sit and read all in one sitting but these two books are exhaustive

01:10:56.849 --> 01:11:04.231
compilations of this history that goes right back to early America.

01:11:06.172 --> 01:11:18.455
Around the same time that, you know, all these other mythologies are instead inserted, like, you know, the Spanish flu of 1918 that killed 100 million people, according to Donald Trump.

01:11:21.128 --> 01:11:30.471
And we know eugenics goes way before 1929, but the United States and the current eugenics movement was the one who started this up again.

01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:40.454
Also, remember that the guy, the Jesuit priest that wrote the book that I just got via eBay, which is actually in my bedroom right now, so I don't have it to show you, called, The Phenomenon of Man.

01:11:41.054 --> 01:11:48.219
That book was written in the 30s, but not published till the 50s, and the guy who wrote the introduction is Julian Huxley.

01:11:48.259 --> 01:11:49.600
These people have a plan.

01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:51.862
They were telling us what they were going to do.

01:11:53.083 --> 01:12:03.090
It was an announcement of a plan, of what these learned men had decided the smartest humans needed to take control of the governance, and that nation-states would get in our way of this.

01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:09.105
and the Nazis adopted our eugenics program.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:15.589
And that's essentially what we're under today yet in the methodology to reduce the population.

01:12:15.609 --> 01:12:25.134
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don, because until you understand that this is a spiritual agenda, you cannot see what they're talking about as false.

01:12:25.194 --> 01:12:29.397
They have you in a dialectic that they believe that this can be fixed.

01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:34.885
When you see it's a spiritual agenda, you see that this has been going on for a long, long time.

01:12:35.505 --> 01:12:40.433
Fortunately, we can be awake to it because Satan is bound by the principle of Genesis 18, 17.

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:41.074
And in Genesis 18, God

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:49.323
said to Abraham, shall I withhold from Abraham what I'm about to do?

01:12:49.343 --> 01:12:51.285
This is before he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:12:51.545 --> 01:12:52.926
Well, that's a biblical principle.

01:12:53.266 --> 01:13:04.335
Since Satan is under God, even though Satan is the prince of this world, he is still bound by the same principles of God, which he's got to let us know what he's going to do before he does it.

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:09.379
And this is at a brazen level today, but this has been going on for a long time.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.481
I traced it back the first

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:18.905
time to the Hippocratic Oath in 400 BC, which most people believe through the programming the Hippocratic Oath is first, do no harm.

01:13:19.425 --> 01:13:21.906
But it is really an oath to satanic gods.

01:13:21.966 --> 01:13:26.669
If you're interested in drilling that down, I did a two-part podcast on it a little over a month ago.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:30.871
The whole virology vaccine scion started in the 1880s.

01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:36.854
Already in the early 1900s, there were doctors speaking out against it because they were seeing

01:13:38.004 --> 01:13:41.129
cancer only in patients who were vaccinated.

01:13:41.429 --> 01:13:43.112
This is already in the early 1900s.

01:13:43.473 --> 01:13:45.716
So this this PSYOP is

01:13:46.835 --> 01:13:48.155
still controlling our country.

01:13:48.195 --> 01:13:55.998
The Jacobson versus Massachusetts Supreme Court decision made sure that the PSYOP can continue legally.

01:13:56.138 --> 01:14:01.660
Satan is a legalist, and Jacobson versus Massachusetts is still the controlling law today.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.240
I'm gonna tell you what it said.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:09.362
So this was a Supreme Court decision decided 7-2 in favor of the state of Massachusetts.

01:14:09.722 --> 01:14:14.584
Jacobson was a pastor who didn't wanna take the smallpox vaccine, and the court said,

01:14:15.168 --> 01:14:34.322
Quote, in every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members, the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subject to such restraint to be enforced by reasonable regulations as the safety of the general public may demand.

01:14:35.243 --> 01:14:37.804
And so what does that break that down?

01:14:38.165 --> 01:14:39.766
In the pressure of great dangers,

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:45.650
So they have convinced the society that viruses are a great danger.

01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:48.572
And so consequently we need vaccines.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:49.872
This is all a psyop.

01:14:50.273 --> 01:14:53.775
We need vaccines because of this great danger of viruses.

01:14:54.055 --> 01:14:58.397
That's how they were able to pull COVID off and where it's gone today.

01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:07.102
I'm going to have some brand new slides that I put together for this presentation because we're helping a lady in a hospital right now to get out and the,

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:22.325
Fact is, hospitals are under military control today in America, and it's under this principle of collectivism, where the stake in the ground was put in there legally with Jacobson versus Massachusetts.

01:15:22.786 --> 01:15:25.429
You know, collectivism as a concept

01:15:26.627 --> 01:15:27.987
is not inherently wrong.

01:15:28.268 --> 01:15:31.949
We've got to take care of the good of society versus the good of the individual.

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:33.989
That's not inherently wrong.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:39.191
But what happens is it becomes wrong when that becomes the goal.

01:15:39.551 --> 01:15:41.012
So right now they've convinced

01:15:41.932 --> 01:15:43.493
us that people are too expensive.

01:15:43.533 --> 01:15:46.836
We have 135 million people on Medicare and Medicaid.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.298
The cost is well over 50% of the annual federal budget.

01:15:50.358 --> 01:15:52.700
People are too expensive, so we've got to hasten their death.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:00.886
And so public health is really public death because the cost is well over 50% of the annual federal budget.

01:16:00.926 --> 01:16:04.609
People are too expensive, so we've got to hasten their death.

01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:08.031
50% of the annual federal budget is Medicaid and Medicare.

01:16:08.071 --> 01:16:09.973
How many times can we say that out loud?

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:16.022
How many times can we say it out loud that what a great way to save costs?

01:16:18.622 --> 01:16:20.082
And they knew this was coming.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:23.723
That's why I reemphasize this population pyramid idea.

01:16:23.763 --> 01:16:25.023
They knew this was coming.

01:16:25.884 --> 01:16:39.446
I assure you, they knew this was coming and they used it as part of this orchestration in addition to the opioid crisis, which took our life expectancy age down a little bit, but the excess deaths,

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:50.008
You know, those are just raw numbers across all age groups and nobody's making a useful attempt at differentiating or even trying to see if we would have expected this bump anyway.

01:16:50.468 --> 01:16:54.331
If we could have just, you know, smooshed them together a little bit to get a bigger bump.

01:16:56.744 --> 01:17:10.230
which is a lot of what somebody like Jessica Hockett could be pointing out, but instead, she's focused very specifically on the fact that there was 25,000 people dead in New York, but actually she didn't see any bodies, so maybe nobody died.

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:13.691
That's a little different than murder now, isn't it?

01:17:16.442 --> 01:17:18.203
They're all traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:18.223 --> 01:17:21.005
They're all traitors and they're all part of the same illusion.

01:17:21.045 --> 01:17:32.412
They're trying to take all of these known phenomenon and contort them into a mystery virus or a lie about a mystery virus, but not murder.

01:17:35.073 --> 01:17:38.956
And so public health is really public death because

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:42.086
Public health means we've got too many people.

01:17:42.146 --> 01:17:47.609
So for the good of the entire country, the good of the world, we've got to reduce the population.

01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:49.030
That's what public health is today.

01:17:49.671 --> 01:17:55.555
The Flexner Report became a major stake in the ground that is the start of allopathic or conventional medicine.

01:17:56.075 --> 01:17:59.397
All other modes were labeled as quackery.

01:17:59.477 --> 01:18:04.701
So with the Flexner Report, we had chiropractic, naturopathic, osteopathic,

01:18:05.161 --> 01:18:08.443
all labeled as quackery in favor of trust the science.

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:11.565
This is where trust the science came from out of the Flexner Report.

01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:16.809
Well, when the government can lie to us about science, you can obviously see where that goes.

01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:22.473
Medicare and Medicaid are already referenced past July 30th, 1965 by design.

01:18:22.893 --> 01:18:30.698
The whole goal was to create a idea that, oh, we can have free healthcare once we're 65 years old.

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:34.561
And we pay into that now through a payroll tax deduction

01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:40.825
Unbelievably, in the Clinton administration, they married Social Security and Medicare.

01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:51.211
So once you choose to take Social Security, you are automatically under Medicare, and the Medicare and Medicaid standards of care apply to the whole country.

01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:59.536
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services writes the standards of care for the entire country, and those standards of care are designed to hasten our death.

01:19:00.177 --> 01:19:03.018
Ultimately, this is what these two

01:19:05.457 --> 01:19:07.559
educated people are completely missing.

01:19:07.619 --> 01:19:10.101
They do not see this as a spiritual battle at all.

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:20.688
And you're going to see the Casey comment about her view of spirituality as we get to the closing slide relative to this presentation.

01:19:21.008 --> 01:19:23.170
Let's go to the next slide then, Don, please.

01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:36.355
All right, so we're going to play a clip next about what they consider the solution to this problem being.

01:19:36.695 --> 01:19:40.358
And ultimately, what they're going to say is King, make rules.

01:19:40.918 --> 01:19:48.984
And that is like the tail wagging the dog, because the government, you're going to see in one of my slides coming up, the government has become a tool of Satan.

01:19:49.425 --> 01:19:53.448
So to say that we're going to have the government fix the problem

01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:58.777
that the government was involved with creating, of course it makes no sense.

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.019
But go ahead and play the clip, Don.

01:20:02.883 --> 01:20:08.647
An executive order tomorrow could make it that USDA panelists cannot take money from food companies.

01:20:09.688 --> 01:20:10.368
What an idea.

01:20:10.769 --> 01:20:16.352
It can sign an executive order tomorrow that NIH grants can't go to conflicted researchers.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:20.655
80% of them currently go to conflicted researchers.

01:20:21.456 --> 01:20:26.739
You could sign an executive order tomorrow that the FDA should stop being funded by pharma.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.921
75% of their funding comes from pharma.

01:20:30.062 --> 01:20:37.407
75% of the FDA's funding doesn't come from taxpayer, it comes from pharma, and there's a revolving door, as we all know, where people go from the FDA to pharma.

01:20:38.228 --> 01:20:40.450
Institutions in the D.C., as we both know, are built to grow.

01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:43.272
The FDA grows when the pharma's influence grows.

01:20:43.992 --> 01:20:46.334
The FDA should be an independent organization.

01:20:46.855 --> 01:20:47.255
It's not.

01:20:47.655 --> 01:20:49.316
That's an executive order tomorrow.

01:20:50.537 --> 01:20:53.920
So you just rob the conflicts of interest out of these things.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:21:17.276
Personnel, assign doctors that we both know onto the USDA nutrition panel and have the president, have the secretary of the treasury, because we're going bankrupt from healthcare costs, have the secretary of defense, because 77% of young adults aren't eligible to join the military, have them say, we are not banning any company, we're not even giving public policy recommendations, but we are saying from a medical perspective,

01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:21.151
that we should reduce all the processed food consumption among children?

01:21:22.052 --> 01:21:33.857
We got to this point in our society because we tacitly approved all of these things because we didn't want to rely on God and ultimately the only way out of this is repentance.

01:21:34.637 --> 01:21:36.878
The idea of having a king

01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:40.775
make executive orders, we already see how that works.

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:46.816
Because the next king obviously reverses the edicts from the king before.

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:50.497
So it just, it is an absolutely crazy solution.

01:21:50.998 --> 01:21:55.799
And I'm shocked that two people with their brain power would even suggest it.

01:21:55.859 --> 01:21:59.900
But this shows you they have no idea that this is a spiritual battle.

01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:08.709
And that is our major way that we can be prepared for the deception that we are getting bombarded with 24 seven.

01:22:08.989 --> 01:22:10.411
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:17.318
This is very interesting when you peel back executive orders and I picked this particular.

01:22:17.338 --> 01:22:21.023
I just want to emphasize what Scott said there.

01:22:23.246 --> 01:22:32.870
And what Scott is saying in that whole diatribe that that guy did, he was talking about how this could be an executive order, and that could be an executive order, and that could be an executive order.

01:22:34.251 --> 01:22:44.916
And so it was really like a little hypnotic spell that he was casting on us to say that, yeah, if we could just get the right guy in there and then he could do executive orders, we could have all this stuff fixed in a few weeks.

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:49.518
I mean, imagine if we could get Donald Trump in there and he would let Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:49.538 --> 01:22:50.178
do that stuff.

01:22:50.658 --> 01:22:55.262
Maybe we could even get lucky enough to have Robert Malone head the CDC or U.S.

01:22:55.382 --> 01:22:57.284
Emirate or maybe even better, the FDA.

01:22:57.744 --> 01:22:59.726
Hell, why don't we just get rid of the FDA?

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:03.149
Because Kevin McKernan says the FDA just gets in the way all the time anyway.

01:23:03.589 --> 01:23:07.032
For goodness sakes, an EUA was almost 10 pages of forms to fill out.

01:23:07.852 --> 01:23:08.573
Bombarded with 24-7.

01:23:08.653 --> 01:23:10.935
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:18.136
This is very interesting when you peel back executive orders, and I picked this particular one.

01:23:18.176 --> 01:23:32.183
This is courtesy of Pete Chambers, Executive Order 13-295, because this is the executive order that got in place well before COVID to be able to pull COVID off and what's going on today.

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:39.066
So you can see in this executive order, April 1st of 2025, SARS was already identified.

01:23:39.847 --> 01:23:42.488
Then they expanded the whole quarantine program

01:23:44.484 --> 01:23:46.527
and included Monkeypox.

01:23:46.867 --> 01:23:54.276
No surprise that Monkeypox now has a World Health Organization public health emergency behind it, I think on August 15th.

01:23:54.356 --> 01:23:56.719
We're going to cover that here in just a little bit.

01:23:57.039 --> 01:24:00.343
So this is how executive orders end up working out.

01:24:00.783 --> 01:24:13.829
You have an executive order that in theory has good intentions, but by the time it trickles down, the Chevron doctrine from 1984 has also been the law of the land up until just over two months ago when it was overturned.

01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:21.893
So what happens once something happens like an executive order, then all these bureaucracies end up getting to implement it.

01:24:22.293 --> 01:24:25.375
And the implementation is always nefarious.

01:24:25.915 --> 01:24:31.859
and it is on steroids, as you're going to see with these new slides that I put together later on in this presentation.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.964
So, Don, before we go to the next slide, let's play the clip that's associated with this slide.

01:24:38.004 --> 01:24:38.284
Go ahead.

01:24:39.571 --> 01:24:44.695
So I'm absolutely certain acute respiratory illnesses are not infectious or contagious.

01:24:45.496 --> 01:24:52.142
There's a hundred years of evidence to say that, and I've not persuaded my wife completely of this, but I am sure of it.

01:24:52.582 --> 01:24:56.486
So when they tell you there's bird flu going around, it's like, no, no, no, there isn't.

01:24:57.286 --> 01:25:03.211
They may well be ill, but they're not, poor little sweetie pie, it's not going to cough up some pathogen and make you sick.

01:25:04.012 --> 01:25:04.633
It's a PSYOP.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.274
It's an absolute psyop.

01:25:06.594 --> 01:25:09.617
You're more likely to catch dolphin influenza.

01:25:11.279 --> 01:25:14.542
I'm certain about that because I've read the bloody literature.

01:25:14.562 --> 01:25:20.788
I've read the hundred years of literature that says that attempts to transmit people who've got colds

01:25:21.368 --> 01:25:29.130
They put them in rooms with people who didn't have colds, and then followed them for several weeks, and did the same experiment by putting two healthy people in a room.

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:33.491
And the question was, how many of the recipients in each case would get sick?

01:25:33.811 --> 01:25:43.414
And you'd be pretty sure, wouldn't you, that if colds were transmissible, that more people would get cold symptoms in the next few weeks if they sat for an hour or two with someone with a cold.

01:25:43.914 --> 01:25:44.334
They don't.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:46.675
It's been published about 40 times.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.375
So, sorry.

01:25:49.276 --> 01:25:50.296
That's your mental model.

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:51.703
It's wrong.

01:25:52.763 --> 01:25:54.184
So you can't catch a cold?

01:25:54.544 --> 01:25:54.704
No.

01:25:56.244 --> 01:26:04.745
And when people think, when people think, oh no, well you say that, Dr. Yeen, but I know that I had a cold, and I definitely caught it from the guy in the office.

01:26:05.386 --> 01:26:05.906
I put it to you.

01:26:05.946 --> 01:26:14.947
I have thought about this, because it is not incumbent on me to come up with an explanation for how they do work, given I've shown you that you're being lied to.

01:26:15.247 --> 01:26:18.228
But I just think it's easier if I give you some suggestions.

01:26:19.108 --> 01:26:31.248
Common colds are sufficiently common that if you have one, it's not that unlikely that someone known to you, family member or friend, will also get a cold in the next short period of time.

01:26:32.193 --> 01:26:35.935
And when that happens, the person who got it second thinks they got it from you.

01:26:37.836 --> 01:26:41.078
It's consistent with contagion, but it isn't.

01:26:42.319 --> 01:26:50.543
The other one is, whatever it is that causes these acute symptoms, I think there will be an environmental contribution.

01:26:50.903 --> 01:26:54.685
Maybe it's too hot, too cold, too dry, too much pollen, or whatever it is.

01:26:55.086 --> 01:26:58.928
Well, you and that person you think you got it from shared some of that environment.

01:26:59.648 --> 01:27:00.469
or some of the food.

01:27:01.611 --> 01:27:04.534
So I think it's coincidence and shared environments.

01:27:04.574 --> 01:27:07.638
That's what explains contagion.

01:27:08.779 --> 01:27:10.141
Wait, what?

01:27:10.421 --> 01:27:12.103
In colds are sufficiently common.

01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:16.168
I had a cold and I definitely... You can't catch a cold?

01:27:16.509 --> 01:27:16.609
No.

01:27:18.215 --> 01:27:38.256
and when people think when people think oh no well you say that dr jean but i know wow good catch jason that was impressive nobody was clapping in the few front rows that was impressive but it sure sounded like they clapped it's wrong so you can't catch a cold no

01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:48.375
And when people think, when people think, oh no, while you say that, I know that I had a cold and I definitely caught it from the guy in the office.

01:27:49.036 --> 01:27:49.536
I put it to you.

01:27:49.596 --> 01:27:54.779
I have thought about this because it's not incumbent on me to come up with an explanation, right?

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.581
For how they do work, given I've shown you that you're being lied to.

01:27:58.882 --> 01:28:01.283
But I just think it's easier if I keep you safe.

01:28:01.303 --> 01:28:02.764
I want to watch that one more time.

01:28:02.784 --> 01:28:04.085
I'm sorry, but that's really striking.

01:28:04.125 --> 01:28:04.945
That's your mental model.

01:28:05.926 --> 01:28:06.306
It's wrong.

01:28:07.367 --> 01:28:08.788
So you can't catch a cold?

01:28:09.148 --> 01:28:09.248
No.

01:28:10.842 --> 01:28:19.347
And when people think, when people think, oh no, well you say that, Dr. Eden, but I know that I had a cold and I definitely caught it from the guy in the office.

01:28:19.987 --> 01:28:20.488
I put it to you.

01:28:20.548 --> 01:28:29.553
I have thought about this because it's not incumbent on me to come up with an explanation, right, for how they do work, given I've shown you that you're being lied to.

01:28:29.853 --> 01:28:32.835
But I just think it's easier if I give you some suggestions.

01:28:33.715 --> 01:28:45.869
Common colds are sufficiently common that if you have one, it's not that unlikely that someone known to you, family member or friend, will also get a cold in the next short period of time.

01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:50.514
And when that happens, the person who got it second thinks they got it from you.

01:28:52.435 --> 01:28:55.676
It's consistent with contagion, but it isn't.

01:28:56.917 --> 01:29:05.139
The other one is, whatever it is that causes these acute symptoms, I think there will be an environmental contribution.

01:29:05.499 --> 01:29:09.280
Maybe it's too hot, too cold, too dry, too much pollen, or whatever it is.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.521
Well, you and that person you think you got it from shared some of that environment.

01:29:14.246 --> 01:29:15.066
or some of the food.

01:29:16.207 --> 01:29:19.128
So I think it's coincidence and shared environments.

01:29:19.168 --> 01:29:22.250
That's what explains contagion.

01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:25.051
So that was Dr. Michael Yeadon.

01:29:25.931 --> 01:29:31.894
He was the chief scientific officer and vice president of Pfizer before he woke up.

01:29:32.674 --> 01:29:37.737
And he is sharing the truth relative to the virology agenda.

01:29:38.257 --> 01:29:42.999
So this executive order that we just got done going through presumes

01:29:43.956 --> 01:29:45.417
virology is true.

01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:48.358
And so then you're in the trap.

01:29:48.418 --> 01:30:00.363
And so if you start arguing against the executive order, you're giving credence to the idea that, well, the whole, we shouldn't control people like this, but then you're giving credence to the virology agenda.

01:30:00.663 --> 01:30:06.966
He's calling a spade a spade and saying, you know, this whole thing is a psyop and he's right.

01:30:06.986 --> 01:30:09.667
You know, so then what I want to do is, is,

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:14.770
give you a tool, and it's a tool all of us knew when we were kids.

01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:17.573
We asked why until we got to the truth.

01:30:17.633 --> 01:30:18.414
Why, why, why?

01:30:18.434 --> 01:30:23.159
You know, it's irritating sometimes as an adult when you have young kids to keep asking why.

01:30:23.179 --> 01:30:26.242
Well, it's because they have that natural inquisitive

01:30:27.364 --> 01:30:35.371
piece of their personality that we wreck as adults because we want them to just be quiet and obey.

01:30:35.771 --> 01:30:40.316
Well, the reality is if we ask, until you know the why, you know nothing.

01:30:40.396 --> 01:30:46.422
If we keep asking enough why questions, so why do we believe that viruses exist?

01:30:46.582 --> 01:30:50.986
Why do we believe that vaccines are the solution to these viruses?

01:30:51.106 --> 01:30:51.747
Why, why, why?

01:30:52.728 --> 01:31:02.082
And an old story that was told to me when I first learned this, you know, when we had our, the first two kids, Travis and Jess, they were asking a lot of why questions.

01:31:02.122 --> 01:31:03.063
It was fun for me.

01:31:03.604 --> 01:31:05.146
They would ask like crazy.

01:31:05.187 --> 01:31:07.911
And I realized, oh my gosh, parents wrecked this.

01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:10.973
And I enjoyed it very much.

01:31:11.013 --> 01:31:20.542
And when kids are ages, you know, five to nine in that range, it is the most fun time because they just keep asking questions over and over and over.

01:31:20.622 --> 01:31:26.987
And at that time I was looking into this and I was told the story about a young man who got married.

01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:35.130
His wife made their first meal, and she made a roast, and she cut off both ends of the roast.

01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:38.272
And so he asked her, what's the deal?

01:31:38.332 --> 01:31:40.214
Why did you cut off both ends of the roast?

01:31:40.554 --> 01:31:42.375
She said, well, that's the way my mom did it.

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:44.316
So he wasn't satisfied.

01:31:44.396 --> 01:31:48.339
So he went to his mother-in-law and said, hey, your daughter made the first meal.

01:31:48.419 --> 01:31:48.940
It was a roast.

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.821
She cut off both ends of the roast.

01:31:51.619 --> 01:31:54.301
And she said, it's because you taught her that.

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.083
So what's the reason you did it?

01:31:56.883 --> 01:31:59.826
And my mom taught me that.

01:32:00.006 --> 01:32:08.152
So, you know, fortunately grandma was still alive and he went to grandma and said, you know, told her the story that I'm telling you.

01:32:08.392 --> 01:32:13.857
And grandma answered him and said, I cut off both ends because it wouldn't fit into the pan.

01:32:14.877 --> 01:32:16.839
And so now we blindly.

01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:21.574
follow these things without asking any questions.

01:32:21.634 --> 01:32:28.802
We just assume viruses exist and they're deadly and that we've got to protect ourselves with vaccines.

01:32:28.903 --> 01:32:31.766
And this PSYOP has been going on for so long.

01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:32.627
And I'm not

01:32:33.741 --> 01:32:43.887
I'm not an expert on viruses, not viruses, but what I do know is that when we let fear control us, we end up doing things that are against God's way.

01:32:43.967 --> 01:32:46.148
God made us fearfully and wonderfully made.

01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:48.350
He made us to inhabit the earth.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:52.852
He knew whatever there was going to be, whatever sickness, our body would handle it.

01:32:53.413 --> 01:32:56.735
And he doesn't want us to rely on men for the solutions.

01:32:56.775 --> 01:32:58.536
And now I see this, the satanic,

01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:13.652
view of things and I see, oh my gosh, they created this whole idea back in the 1880s and now they've got kids taking 80 vaccinations before they can go to the public full system and be indoctrinated.

01:33:14.033 --> 01:33:15.114
That's how bad things are.

01:33:15.134 --> 01:33:17.757
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:33:19.028 --> 01:33:27.891
This slide emphasizes what I just said, that this whole presentation that Tucker Carlson had is out of touch with the historic programming.

01:33:28.431 --> 01:33:33.592
And we know the vaccination agenda, but here's how deep this is.

01:33:33.652 --> 01:33:35.953
This is a lady who's programmed in the system.

01:33:35.973 --> 01:33:36.653
She's a nurse.

01:33:37.254 --> 01:33:42.275
And our daughter, Jessica, found this on Facebook about a month and a half ago, and she's posted it.

01:33:42.315 --> 01:33:48.437
So obviously she really believes in the vaccination agenda to the extent that she would

01:33:49.153 --> 01:33:51.136
violate a law to do it.

01:33:51.196 --> 01:33:55.503
So she wrote, as a labor and delivery nurse, it was up to me to inject the newborn.

01:33:55.948 --> 01:33:59.269
Even back then, over 30 years ago, we had patients that would refuse.

01:33:59.369 --> 01:34:07.872
I know that it was their right as parents to refuse, but as not only a nurse, but also a mother, I just could not send a baby home defenseless.

01:34:08.252 --> 01:34:19.595
I know what I did was not right, but I would inform the parents I was taking the baby to weigh him or her on a more precise scale and then take them to the nursery and inject them.

01:34:19.995 --> 01:34:20.776
Just had to do it.

01:34:21.257 --> 01:34:25.241
No baby was going to bleed out on my watch in spite of the parent's stupidness.

01:34:25.802 --> 01:34:27.764
So that's outside of a hospital.

01:34:27.824 --> 01:34:30.948
Well, inside of a hospital, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid.

01:34:31.468 --> 01:34:34.692
What's going on here is this is a picture

01:34:36.502 --> 01:34:40.924
We, my wife and I are involved helping a lady in a hospital right now.

01:34:41.044 --> 01:34:42.045
She has special needs.

01:34:42.065 --> 01:34:43.425
She's 59 years old.

01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:52.370
And last week on Monday, not Labor Day, but the Monday before we went to visit her and my wife took her a pad and paper.

01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:54.111
Well, we went back.

01:34:55.731 --> 01:34:58.793
Uh, my wife went back on Wednesday and this is what she had written.

01:34:59.582 --> 01:35:01.183
in the notebook.

01:35:01.203 --> 01:35:05.426
So my wife was questioning the nurses and what they're trying to do is medicate her.

01:35:05.986 --> 01:35:08.648
So she wrote in the notebook, no pain meds.

01:35:08.668 --> 01:35:11.689
She can't talk because she's on a ventilator with a trach.

01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.830
So she can't talk.

01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:17.673
So she's writing in this notebook, call 911, call the police, no pain meds.

01:35:18.473 --> 01:35:20.535
She knows they're trying to medicate her.

01:35:21.475 --> 01:35:49.573
uh you know just she points to the pain level on the board and and she points to a pain level four instantly the nurse wants to give her a pain med and she's she's waving them off she waves her hand no no no they just won't listen they want to medicate medicate medicate and the reason is is because she's on she is one of the low-hanging fruit because she has special needs she's been on social security and medic in the medicare system her whole life

01:35:50.162 --> 01:35:55.364
All right, you wanna see how bad the vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate agenda is.

01:35:56.165 --> 01:36:03.308
Israel agreed to a three-day ceasefire so that they could implement the polio vaccine.

01:36:03.848 --> 01:36:04.668
I mean, what?

01:36:05.148 --> 01:36:10.291
I mean, that's how deep this vaccination psyop is worldwide.

01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:11.391
All right, let's go to the next.

01:36:12.622 --> 01:36:13.623
Next slide, Don.

01:36:14.183 --> 01:36:18.845
All right, as you learn to zoom out a little bit, you start seeing satanic symbolism.

01:36:19.766 --> 01:36:34.913
So we have Casey is going to explain her view of spiritualism relative to what's going on and how the sun takes care of us, and it's essentially a form of sun worship.

01:36:35.233 --> 01:36:36.754
You know, God warns against this.

01:36:37.835 --> 01:36:38.295
He says,

01:36:39.175 --> 01:36:46.861
People are going to worship the creation instead of the Creator and exchange the truth about God for that lie.

01:36:47.021 --> 01:36:48.202
And that's happening today.

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.603
We worship Mother Earth.

01:36:50.284 --> 01:36:53.987
Mother Earth doesn't have enough resources, so we've got to control the population.

01:36:54.027 --> 01:36:55.128
That's where all this comes from.

01:36:55.448 --> 01:36:57.470
Go ahead and play the clip that's related, Don.

01:36:58.618 --> 01:37:10.846
And I think, you know, on the biggest macro level, like the kind of the most zoomed out spiritual level, like I think, you know, what we have to realize is that like, we are miracles, like every human is a miracle.

01:37:10.886 --> 01:37:11.967
This life is a miracle.

01:37:12.067 --> 01:37:12.968
Like this is weird.

01:37:13.228 --> 01:37:17.030
I mean, spiritual beings having this insane experience on planet Earth.

01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:22.754
And fundamentally, the thing that we're doing with metabolic health is we're making energy in the body, right?

01:37:23.034 --> 01:37:27.217
The way we're doing that is we're taking food that got its energy from the sun, right?

01:37:27.237 --> 01:37:28.318
Like the sun literally

01:37:29.178 --> 01:37:34.220
photosynthesis happens, it creates starches in plants and then we eat them or animals eat them.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:46.364
And what metabolism is, is taking the starches that are stored energy from the sun through photosynthesis, liberating it in our bodies to create energy to fuel our minds and to fuel our bodies so that we can think and reach our highest purpose.

01:37:46.764 --> 01:38:03.398
And right now, in the vast majority of Americans, our toxic food system is blocking that process, which means it's blocking the miraculous process of essentially taking this beautiful, this is not woo-woo, this is just fact of science, taking this universal sun, light, energy, and liberating it to fuel our lives.

01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:04.419
That is broken.

01:38:04.499 --> 01:38:05.119
This is dark.

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.440
This is very dark.

01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:10.504
Americans are not only sick, but the core process of being able to create

01:38:11.044 --> 01:38:14.268
you know, and transform energy is broken.

01:38:14.469 --> 01:38:19.115
And we need to fix this because we need all hands on deck right now in America to solve these big issues.

01:38:19.155 --> 01:38:21.398
And we need to be thinking properly, feeling good.

01:38:21.418 --> 01:38:24.181
And we can rapidly with some of these simple changes.

01:38:25.526 --> 01:38:26.967
So again, you hear some truth.

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:33.933
We do have toxic foods from not just the air, but the chemicals that have been sprayed on the foods.

01:38:33.973 --> 01:38:35.113
I mean, it's terrible.

01:38:35.153 --> 01:38:46.522
So no doubt that that piece is truth, but wrap it into the idea, the trick here is worship the sun, worship the creation instead of the creator who made the sun.

01:38:46.542 --> 01:38:52.027
You know, the God of the universe made the sun and he's the only one who can get us out of this.

01:38:52.447 --> 01:38:53.728
All right, let's go to the next slide.

01:38:55.206 --> 01:38:56.710
I want to share a story here.

01:38:57.993 --> 01:39:00.178
I'm calling this slide the Boiling Frog.

01:39:00.559 --> 01:39:01.340
In this clip,

01:39:02.023 --> 01:39:10.627
or this interview, I should say, not this clip, but this interview had already 2.2 million views, 113,000 likes and 17,000 comments.

01:39:11.267 --> 01:39:16.670
And these three comments, I'll just read them and I'll share why I'm calling this the boiling frog.

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:21.492
Tucker getting canned by Fox was one of the greatest things to happen to human society.

01:39:21.532 --> 01:39:28.455
The information his platform now provides and his willingness to touch subjects that are untouchable is invaluable.

01:39:28.835 --> 01:39:32.217
especially in this world of lies we have come to discover.

01:39:32.237 --> 01:39:36.400
Of course, the person writing this doesn't realize they were just watching a lie.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:37.481
Next one.

01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:44.305
This interview should be mandatory viewing for everyone in medical school, all current doctors, and anyone who still trusts the U.S.

01:39:44.385 --> 01:39:46.406
food and medicine industries.

01:39:46.786 --> 01:39:47.787
We need to wake up.

01:39:48.207 --> 01:39:54.111
Well, first, I would be against anything that's mandatory, because that isn't how God works.

01:39:54.151 --> 01:39:55.372
But just think this through.

01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:57.751
What is the real problem?

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:04.856
The doctors are programmed into the allopathic medical system, and it was by design.

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:09.680
So watching one lie is certainly not going to wake them up.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.342
President Trump needs to appoint Casey and Kelly in his administration.

01:40:13.462 --> 01:40:14.123
Yeah, that's a

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.462
You know, the whole all of my comments have covered that already.

01:40:17.742 --> 01:40:24.368
So the boiling frog, the boiling frog phenomena says that we cannot sense one degree changes.

01:40:24.388 --> 01:40:25.829
None of us can.

01:40:25.869 --> 01:40:27.891
So we have we slowly boil to death.

01:40:27.971 --> 01:40:30.253
So the frog doesn't is in the pot.

01:40:30.453 --> 01:40:32.215
The pot temperature is 70 degrees.

01:40:32.255 --> 01:40:34.237
You turn up the temperature one degree at a time.

01:40:34.697 --> 01:40:39.219
The frog cannot sense a one degree temperature change, so it ends up boiling to death.

01:40:39.479 --> 01:40:41.280
But we're at that point right now.

01:40:42.081 --> 01:40:44.042
People can't sense what is going on.

01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:46.123
They can't tell the difference between truth and lies.

01:40:46.183 --> 01:40:48.784
The programming is so deep.

01:40:48.844 --> 01:40:51.546
The public fool system has trained out critical thinking.

01:40:52.106 --> 01:40:56.328
And I have a neat story about the boiling frog that I thought of when I put this together.

01:40:56.348 --> 01:40:58.729
And it came from a funeral.

01:40:58.789 --> 01:41:01.310
We went to a funeral two summers ago.

01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:02.311
Or no, it was last summer.

01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:05.072
and it was a high school classmate.

01:41:05.772 --> 01:41:11.714
She had married a man from the class ahead of us, and he died of a heart attack.

01:41:13.754 --> 01:41:20.196
And we went to the funeral, and his son was telling about how his dad was a prankster, and I couldn't get enough of this.

01:41:20.216 --> 01:41:29.579
So his dad worked in an office setting where they had cubicles, and the cubicles were movable, and what he would do

01:41:30.639 --> 01:41:40.141
is he took the cubicle and the three sides of the cubicle, and he moved them a half inch, all three sides, a half inch in every day.

01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:42.622
And I just couldn't get enough of that.

01:41:42.642 --> 01:41:49.123
Can you imagine the guy that he's doing that to, and all of a sudden, you can't sense that half inch a day.

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:53.284
And all of a sudden, your cubicle, you can't get it in anymore.

01:41:54.065 --> 01:41:56.027
Anyway, I just enjoyed that humor.

01:41:56.067 --> 01:41:59.350
I thought it was, I wish I would have thought of it first.

01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:00.591
That's how good it was.

01:42:00.631 --> 01:42:03.654
But anyway, that's the boiling frog phenomena illustrated.

01:42:03.974 --> 01:42:05.496
All right, so why are we so deceived?

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:09.560
Let's go to the next slide.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.182
Why did we fall for this stuff?

01:42:13.323 --> 01:42:20.867
five things, say more, but these are the five that are top of mind as to why we're so easily deceived.

01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:22.368
First of all, we want a king.

01:42:22.388 --> 01:42:25.990
You know, this was exposed by God in 1 Samuel chapter 8.

01:42:26.190 --> 01:42:29.953
God even warned the people, this is what a king is going to do.

01:42:30.053 --> 01:42:31.894
You're going to become a slave to the king.

01:42:32.374 --> 01:42:33.655
And they still wanted the king.

01:42:33.755 --> 01:42:36.636
And God said, okay, He said the same, give them their king.

01:42:36.757 --> 01:42:39.098
But when they realized what the king did,

01:42:39.867 --> 01:42:43.213
I don't have them come crying to me because I'm done with them.

01:42:43.274 --> 01:42:44.155
They wanted a king.

01:42:44.175 --> 01:42:46.720
And we've been under that for a long time.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.906
It isn't just the next king that people are all in favor of.

01:42:50.908 --> 01:42:58.810
But we've been wanting a king for a long, long time instead of taking responsibility and being submissive to the God of the universe.

01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.470
All right.

01:42:59.630 --> 01:43:03.111
Believing one of the big lies, no one would do this.

01:43:03.151 --> 01:43:04.031
We're inherently good.

01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:08.833
Satan has weaved a number of gigantic whoppers into our society.

01:43:09.113 --> 01:43:14.094
And one of the big ones that is against what the Bible says is that we are inherently good.

01:43:14.654 --> 01:43:17.775
In fact, we're inherently bad and in desperate need of a savior.

01:43:18.155 --> 01:43:30.279
So when you start telling people about hospital murders, you start telling people about the vaccine agenda, they just can't, they don't want to accept that because they believe that nobody would do that.

01:43:30.319 --> 01:43:31.679
It can't be that bad, Scott.

01:43:32.299 --> 01:43:35.100
I hear this regularly, heard it again over Labor Day weekend.

01:43:36.541 --> 01:43:37.021
Number three,

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:44.743
they, which is the globalists, get us to unwittingly participate through the illusion of choice.

01:43:45.343 --> 01:43:49.005
And the illusion of choice that is top of mind right now is elections.

01:43:49.465 --> 01:43:54.407
So we will see shortly that governments are in total control

01:43:55.618 --> 01:43:57.179
by the satanic agenda.

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:02.704
And so we get this illusion of choice, and we end up participating in our own demise.

01:44:02.744 --> 01:44:08.148
And then by tacitly approving, we become the boiling frog in this banality of evil.

01:44:08.729 --> 01:44:11.791
And there's an example that I have

01:44:12.532 --> 01:44:16.233
recently come across with CMS when they wrote the procedures for COVID.

01:44:16.613 --> 01:44:20.374
So first, you know, everybody in CMS isn't an evil person.

01:44:20.394 --> 01:44:22.394
They're unwittingly participants.

01:44:22.414 --> 01:44:24.595
So they believe the COVID narrative.

01:44:24.935 --> 01:44:30.456
Now they've got to write rules and regulations, which included not allowing family members in the hospital.

01:44:30.476 --> 01:44:34.917
So they're an unwitting participant in this banality of evil.

01:44:35.533 --> 01:44:43.677
Hannah Arendt coined that phrase, banality of evil, when she saw the same thing happening when she studied the Adolf Eichmann trial for World War II.

01:44:44.017 --> 01:44:46.398
Then she saw, well, they had everybody in on it.

01:44:46.858 --> 01:44:51.540
Everybody was participating in their own demise in this banality of evil.

01:44:52.001 --> 01:44:54.822
Evil became so common, we didn't even recognize it.

01:44:56.203 --> 01:44:59.885
Fourth one, we don't see the matrix of the world as spiritual warfare.

01:45:00.185 --> 01:45:05.109
When Jesus said Satan is the prince of this world, the prince of this world created the matrix.

01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:18.297
He created both the evil side and the less evil side, and God warned us that he would do that when he exposed Satan's nature, his dualistic nature in Revelation 13, the antichrist nature and the false prophet nature.

01:45:18.798 --> 01:45:21.740
And Satan has successfully weaponized public health.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.301
Again, God warned us, Revelation 18, 23,

01:45:26.203 --> 01:45:29.225
Satan would deceive us with pharmakia and sorcery.

01:45:30.366 --> 01:45:33.809
Prior programming has made conventional medicine an idol.

01:45:33.829 --> 01:45:40.475
I mean, hardly anybody has been alive before the Flexner Report.

01:45:40.495 --> 01:45:49.263
So now all of us grew up with the idea of trusting the white coat, the lie of the Hippocratic Oath, first do no harm.

01:45:49.693 --> 01:45:52.017
And so we're just programmed to trust the doctor.

01:45:52.658 --> 01:45:56.444
And so conventional medicine has become an idol, partially because we're lazy.

01:45:56.464 --> 01:45:58.127
We want a pill to fix everything.

01:45:58.667 --> 01:46:00.070
All right, then the last one.

01:46:01.277 --> 01:46:10.203
maybe the most surprising because of what I thought of the church beforehand, and compared to what I think of it now, the church doesn't preach the truth.

01:46:10.663 --> 01:46:19.309
And this example I'm gonna give you is from Ephesians 6, 12, that God is telling us our war on this earth is spiritual.

01:46:20.089 --> 01:46:22.171
He wrote, for we wrestle against

01:46:22.871 --> 01:46:36.656
or we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against worldly governors, the princes of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, which are in ye high places.

01:46:36.676 --> 01:46:45.279
All right, so the question I have, anybody who has a Bible, take out your Bible and see if the underlying piece is in your Bible.

01:46:45.719 --> 01:46:47.180
This is how subtle this is.

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:57.267
I learned that the copyright law, so when a new Bible is copyrighted, they have to change the Bible that they took by at least 10% to get the copyright.

01:46:57.807 --> 01:47:00.649
All right, so why would this be taken out?

01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:03.852
This was from the Geneva Bible in the 1500s.

01:47:04.352 --> 01:47:13.579
Well, it's because what God said in 1 Samuel Chapter 8 were these governments that are put in place and these kings that are put in place,

01:47:14.554 --> 01:47:16.695
They're part of the satanic system.

01:47:16.815 --> 01:47:19.535
And he says this right plainly in Ephesians 6, 12.

01:47:20.476 --> 01:47:25.497
But if your Bible doesn't say this and the church doesn't preach it, it's all gone.

01:47:25.577 --> 01:47:28.218
So we have this whole psyop going on.

01:47:28.298 --> 01:47:29.898
It's our civic duty to vote.

01:47:30.518 --> 01:47:32.399
And the churches are all 501c3.

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:37.260
So they can't get involved with politics and all this crap that has happened.

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.721
And ultimately, we have churches now that

01:47:40.745 --> 01:47:45.629
preach watered-down versions of Romans 13 and 14, so we're completely not prepared.

01:47:46.069 --> 01:47:56.716
Romans 13, briefly, is we've got to obey the government, and they've really watered it down, obey the government at all costs, even when they are doing things like satanic mandates.

01:47:56.797 --> 01:48:00.659
And then the chapter 14, Romans 14, is the get-along chapter.

01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:02.120
We just need to get along with everybody.

01:48:02.441 --> 01:48:03.661
Well, that's simply not true.

01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:08.245
Jesus came to bring a sword, so we can't call sin sin anymore in most churches.

01:48:08.605 --> 01:48:09.946
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:48:10.626 --> 01:48:26.458
This illustration shows... I would like to just throw out there the idea that sits in my head from Catholicism and my understanding of reverence for God.

01:48:27.907 --> 01:48:34.511
and the need of a savior was that no matter how good you were, you weren't going to be pure enough to be in the presence of God.

01:48:34.571 --> 01:48:37.673
Like that's just the idea, right?

01:48:38.234 --> 01:48:43.697
If there is some supreme being that is the creator of everything that we are and everything that we have,

01:48:44.787 --> 01:48:52.992
Then no matter what we do as a follower or as a disciple or as a faithful, we're always going to make mistakes.

01:48:53.053 --> 01:48:54.934
We're always going to falter.

01:48:55.154 --> 01:49:01.058
And so we're never going to be pure enough to be worthy of being in that presence.

01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:07.722
And so then we needed someone to take that burden for us.

01:49:07.862 --> 01:49:13.066
And that's what I understand Jesus as having been, that the Son of God was sent to the earth

01:49:13.806 --> 01:49:27.692
to be that, to pay that price for everybody that by their very nature, they couldn't pay themselves, that they would never be worthy in order to be worthy.

01:49:29.831 --> 01:49:31.932
That's kind of how I understand it.

01:49:32.012 --> 01:49:43.916
And you know, there could be plenty of priests and plenty of other people out there that can tell me that that's ridiculous, but I have a personal relationship with God, like I think is instructed in the Bible.

01:49:43.956 --> 01:49:46.557
And so I keep it off the stream as much as possible.

01:49:47.818 --> 01:49:59.142
I don't work like Scott works, but I'm praying and I'm thinking very much in the context of the irreducible complexity

01:50:01.089 --> 01:50:22.499
being all the evidence that I need that there is a creator worth exalting and that's what that's what motivates me to share Scott's work because we share that in common right this understanding of this great mystery of which we are a part there's no doubt but it uh

01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:28.221
It's becoming a frightening thing when it's so few and far between.

01:50:28.261 --> 01:50:34.643
We have Joe Marshall, we have Scott Shara, Mark Kulak, and Jonathan Cooey.

01:50:36.464 --> 01:50:40.305
And then I kind of have to stop the list because I don't know who else to list.

01:50:43.946 --> 01:50:46.947
All this is put together on a macro basis.

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:52.409
And what I'm saying, the hidden public health emergency is we have too many people.

01:50:53.188 --> 01:50:54.269
That's what's happening.

01:50:54.469 --> 01:51:01.453
Once you come to grips with this is what they're implementing, this is what they call public health policy, is that we've got too many people.

01:51:01.493 --> 01:51:03.114
We can't sustain this on the planet.

01:51:03.494 --> 01:51:09.637
So for the collectivism benefit of public health, we have to reduce the population.

01:51:10.077 --> 01:51:11.498
We don't have enough resources.

01:51:11.818 --> 01:51:13.239
So how have they pulled this off?

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.361
Well, they pulled it off because we have a fiat currency.

01:51:16.441 --> 01:51:19.763
So Satan has control of all the money through the occult,

01:51:20.458 --> 01:51:34.331
Then the church, and this is what I was referencing before, and I have church in quotes because if a church is not preaching the absolute truth of God, they become an accomplice to the problem.

01:51:34.371 --> 01:51:43.320
And ultimately, the money then is used to control big pharma, big corporations, everybody's been bought, and big pharma, big corporations controls the government.

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.701
So our illusion of

01:51:45.305 --> 01:51:48.946
participation in choice is that, oh, we can get the right leaders.

01:51:49.006 --> 01:51:57.808
I mean, our government has been bought for so long, and I'm not even drilling down the scythe of the American dream that we're a corporation, all of that.

01:51:57.928 --> 01:51:59.289
I'm not even going there right now.

01:51:59.709 --> 01:52:04.070
But you can see this, this is in fact where we are at as a society.

01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:05.910
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:08.771
We're gonna have a trilogy here, three brand new slides.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:22.609
And again, I would answer Snowcat 63 with the idea that there can be more beauty and more good.

01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:36.176
The whole idea, maybe, I don't know, I wasn't there, is that the kind of good that was created requires a sort of free will.

01:52:38.104 --> 01:52:45.007
And that means that necessarily some parts of creation, I don't know the answer to that question.

01:52:45.067 --> 01:52:45.868
I honestly don't.

01:52:46.708 --> 01:52:54.492
But I think what I said earlier comes from this reverence for the sacred, this reverence for the irreducible complexity around you.

01:52:54.532 --> 01:53:01.275
It's kind of hard to see that inside of a house with bare walls or silly pictures or even a computer screen in front of you.

01:53:01.915 --> 01:53:04.757
But if you surrounded yourself with a forest for a few days,

01:53:07.165 --> 01:53:20.909
you might find yourself a little bit overwhelmed by the majesty of it all, especially if you chose to go to a national forest or something like that, where more of what would be considered the natural state of nature would be preserved.

01:53:22.369 --> 01:53:31.852
You might find yourself a little bit overwhelmed to realize that this was all, it's all you, it's all us, it's all creation, we're all part of one magical moment.

01:53:32.692 --> 01:53:35.913
Which again, that woman was kind of saying, but not really,

01:53:36.926 --> 01:53:45.176
because she stopped right at the sun shining on a rock for like really long time and then now we're miraculously here.

01:53:45.717 --> 01:53:46.998
That's the illusion.

01:53:48.366 --> 01:53:55.688
of Darwinist evolution applied to the infinite degree like Bret Weinstein does.

01:53:56.509 --> 01:54:12.474
Bret Weinstein thinks that all other modes of thinking are derivative from evolutionary thinking, which is the most arrogant and ridiculous position that anyone has probably ever taken in the history of mankind, and yet that is the fundamental definition of Bret Weinstein.

01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:25.713
He thinks that his line of thinking and his sort of monopoly on it in his imagination is what makes him such a significant figure.

01:54:27.255 --> 01:54:28.297
I have something sorry caught.

01:54:31.178 --> 01:54:51.944
If you think for a second about the first Portal podcast where Eric interviews his brother Brett and pretends to be sick of Brett not saying that he's as smart as he is and that you've got to stop being so humble because you're like one of the smartest people on earth, you can see the illusion that these people are playing on us.

01:54:55.515 --> 01:55:04.968
And it's an irreducible complexity and a reverence for it that they are working together to dispel once and for all in our children.

01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:10.155
And it is diabolical, it is malevolent.

01:55:11.653 --> 01:55:27.867
What's happening with these slides is, this is what I learned since being involved with this lady over the last, we got involved the first week of July, so it's been two months now that we're involved with this special needs lady who's 59 years old in the hospital.

01:55:28.308 --> 01:55:29.609
So she went to the hospital.

01:55:31.042 --> 01:55:32.203
And she got a stint.

01:55:32.303 --> 01:55:33.664
So she had a heart attack, got a stint.

01:55:33.704 --> 01:55:40.729
Well, a stint is not a complicated procedure, but the standard of care today allows a hospital to put her on a ventilator.

01:55:40.749 --> 01:55:42.090
So of course they put her on a ventilator.

01:55:44.512 --> 01:55:50.036
It's so frustrating because, you know, a ventilator with COVID we saw had a 90% kill rate.

01:55:50.056 --> 01:55:51.557
So why are they still using ventilators?

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.458
I mean, a ventilator is a tool.

01:55:54.644 --> 01:55:57.046
But it is it not a go-to tool.

01:55:57.206 --> 01:56:01.490
It is a tool of last resort So they put the lady on the ventilator where she's at right now.

01:56:02.050 --> 01:56:06.533
She's in a Madison, Wisconsin hospital She is in a hospital.

01:56:06.633 --> 01:56:09.095
That is a vent weaning hospital.

01:56:09.175 --> 01:56:18.503
This is a specialty hospital that is there solely for vent weaning and I'm just gonna go on that rabbit trail for a minute because you can't make this stuff up.

01:56:18.623 --> 01:56:20.224
It's a it's a hospital with a

01:56:21.533 --> 01:56:25.396
three floors for patients, the second, third and fourth floor.

01:56:25.456 --> 01:56:29.578
Well, the third and fourth floor are all vent weaning patients.

01:56:29.599 --> 01:56:38.545
So these are people who are on vents in other hospitals and they ran out of their number of days that met the Medicare system would pay for in that hospital.

01:56:38.585 --> 01:56:40.946
So then they get transferred to a vent weaning hospital.

01:56:41.286 --> 01:56:46.370
The vent weaning hospital has to wean them off in 28 days because their benefits expire.

01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:49.851
So, I presume after 2018... I'm going to give you an answer, Snowcat.

01:56:49.931 --> 01:56:57.133
I just want you to do this thought experiment for a second, but can you imagine a scenario, Snowcat, where you found this on the ground?

01:57:03.015 --> 01:57:09.177
If you found this on the ground, would there be any way for you to attribute this to natural origin?

01:57:10.457 --> 01:57:15.779
Would you just say to yourself, well, obviously, this is, I found it in the woods.

01:57:16.658 --> 01:57:19.220
So obviously it just, you know, evolved.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:24.723
It's just a consequence of the sun shining on a rock very consistently for about 3 billion years.

01:57:25.263 --> 01:57:27.184
And then you occasionally get these things.

01:57:31.887 --> 01:57:41.853
So one biological angle to take would be that the more we know about biology, the harder it becomes to dismiss the idea of design.

01:57:43.271 --> 01:57:55.415
Harder to dismiss the idea of creation of some kind or another simply because we can't explain this irreducible complexity from the standpoint of a lightning bolt hitting a mud puddle.

01:57:58.396 --> 01:58:00.157
And we need to come to terms with that.

01:58:00.217 --> 01:58:11.141
Because right now, this whole biology 101 is based on the idea that if a lightning bolt hits a mud puddle with the right combination of chemicals in it, that you could get amino acids.

01:58:11.201 --> 01:58:15.103
And that eventually, if another lightning bolt hits, you might be able to get RNA or DNA.

01:58:15.563 --> 01:58:17.984
And then eventually, they would start copying themselves.

01:58:18.064 --> 01:58:25.867
And a few billion years later, you would have a pattern integrity that was conscious of itself, capable of free will and wars

01:58:26.887 --> 01:58:28.988
and genetically modified organisms.

01:58:34.431 --> 01:58:40.453
And there's just this huge gap there in terms of, you know, really being able to explain how we got here.

01:58:41.994 --> 01:58:48.917
A huge gap that doesn't involve really any of the more interesting biological theories about the origins of life.

01:58:49.378 --> 01:58:50.058
And even so,

01:58:53.638 --> 01:59:08.445
tries wholeheartedly to dismiss the idea of anything divine, anything sacred, even if the irreducible complexity can't possibly be explained by any theory that we have right now.

01:59:08.825 --> 01:59:09.045
None.

01:59:10.006 --> 01:59:15.508
We know so little about our own biology that there is no plausible theory for our origin.

01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:21.171
Other than a lightning bolt hitting a mud puddle with some chemicals in it.

01:59:21.801 --> 01:59:25.403
over and over and over and over again until eventually it started, I guess.

01:59:28.925 --> 01:59:29.985
I don't know why I went over here.

01:59:30.726 --> 01:59:32.447
Days, they will kill the patient.

01:59:32.487 --> 01:59:34.748
I mean, this is my first time even understanding this.

01:59:34.768 --> 01:59:40.551
So I talked with the nurse from the Madison Hospital about the 28 days.

01:59:40.651 --> 01:59:41.892
Just be aware though, right?

01:59:41.912 --> 01:59:45.314
Darwin didn't believe that his theory explained everything.

01:59:46.638 --> 02:00:12.172
Darwin knew and understood well that you couldn't take his idea and then rewind it all the way to Before the finches were on that island Only thing he's suggesting is is that some of the attributes of the finches might have changed over time But he never imagined that you could just okay if I if you add enough time there that I guess we get all the way back to a mud puddle and some molecules

02:00:13.752 --> 02:00:16.735
He would have never imagined that, not in a million years.

02:00:16.795 --> 02:00:25.645
And yet that's exactly where people like Brett Weinstein have taken his theories with what they would call logical deduction and conclusions.

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:27.847
I mean, how other would you explain it?

02:00:29.862 --> 02:00:32.764
And I was asking him the question, well, what about physical therapy?

02:00:32.784 --> 02:00:34.025
I mean, we got to get her out of bed.

02:00:34.045 --> 02:00:36.908
I mean, part of healing, you got to get your lungs working.

02:00:36.928 --> 02:00:38.049
You got to get everything working.

02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:39.651
And so she needs physical therapy.

02:00:40.071 --> 02:00:41.592
And he says, well, we don't do that here.

02:00:41.893 --> 02:00:45.036
After the 28 days, she gets transferred to physical therapy.

02:00:46.036 --> 02:00:47.518
So that's a different facility.

02:00:47.898 --> 02:00:52.863
And what they're doing in this facility is they're completely gutted the second floor so they can

02:00:53.729 --> 02:00:57.793
get the physical therapy component of the Medicare stay.

02:00:57.813 --> 02:01:01.436
So assuming the patient survives the 28 days, then they can transfer them from

02:01:02.163 --> 02:01:07.686
or third and fourth floor to second floor, and then start the X number of days of physical therapy.

02:01:07.706 --> 02:01:12.268
It's like, oh my gosh, it's just, it's absolute insanity.

02:01:12.668 --> 02:01:14.089
So what is going on here?

02:01:15.029 --> 02:01:18.371
This was, this shocked me so much.

02:01:18.431 --> 02:01:21.132
I read this on Labor Day morning.

02:01:21.913 --> 02:01:24.494
I talked with a gentleman who does hospital rescues.

02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:36.030
when Cindy and I were in the Madison Hospital on Sunday, and I spent about 45 minutes with him on the phone, and he got me up to speed on what I'm gonna share with you next.

02:01:36.571 --> 02:01:43.096
So the Department of Defense has ultimate control of hospitals right now.

02:01:43.777 --> 02:01:51.803
And so DOD is Department of Defense, MHS is Military Health System, and then DHA is Defense Health Agency.

02:01:51.944 --> 02:01:54.766
And the Defense Health Agency has a public health division.

02:01:55.416 --> 02:01:59.578
and the public health division is there to satisfy their customer needs.

02:01:59.598 --> 02:02:00.579
Well, who's the customer?

02:02:00.919 --> 02:02:01.999
The Department of Defense.

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:10.064
And you can see their goal is to best accommodate the integration and evolution of future product lines.

02:02:10.584 --> 02:02:14.746
Well, the product line for COVID was the bioweapon.

02:02:15.266 --> 02:02:20.469
And the Brooke Jackson case exposed that the Department of Defense had a contract with Pfizer

02:02:20.984 --> 02:02:22.365
for this product line.

02:02:22.765 --> 02:02:30.411
That's why the- I just, I would caution Scott to be very careful about attributing these motives to the DoD.

02:02:30.472 --> 02:02:33.094
The DoD is a toolbox.

02:02:33.694 --> 02:02:36.016
The DoD are automatons.

02:02:36.536 --> 02:02:40.519
The DoD is an order-taking bureaucracy.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:44.043
that doesn't make very many decisions on its own.

02:02:44.103 --> 02:02:52.273
Now, if you want to say that the decisions that the DoD made during COVID were set in motion before Donald Trump and his people took office, fine.

02:02:52.313 --> 02:02:52.574
I don't know.

02:02:52.594 --> 02:02:53.034
I don't care.

02:02:53.054 --> 02:02:54.596
I don't know how that works.

02:02:55.377 --> 02:02:59.282
But the idea of blaming the DoD really does feel like

02:03:00.566 --> 02:03:15.730
You are blaming the Major League Baseball players for following the rules and playing the game as defined by the baseball commissioners instead of blaming the baseball commissioners for defining the game with shitty rules.

02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:27.613
And then allowing the Major League Baseball players to take the blame for what they were made to do by their contract and by the sport that they are paid to play.

02:03:30.959 --> 02:03:44.211
And this feels very dangerous because this completely absolves the entire executive branch from having any role in what the DOD is doing, even though the executive branch is the baseball commissioners.

02:03:45.382 --> 02:03:58.672
It is the board of commissioners that describes the rules of the contracts, and the rules of the game, and the rules of the season, and how many games they play, and who wears what uniforms, and how many players they can have on each team.

02:03:59.252 --> 02:04:06.118
That's all defined by a separate organization, and you've got to think of the DOD as Major League Baseball.

02:04:06.158 --> 02:04:11.722
You cannot think of the DOD as the commissioners of Major League Baseball.

02:04:12.597 --> 02:04:25.616
or the people that run the NCAA, you gotta think not of the collegiate athletes and the college basketball teams, but you gotta think of the NCAA and the people that define the rules under which they play.

02:04:28.567 --> 02:04:35.532
And so the blaming the DOD here, I think is incomplete and it's dangerous and I don't like it.

02:04:35.592 --> 02:04:53.065
So I hope that you guys will share this part of the stream with Scott and we can at least talk about this because at least above the DOD should be the executive branch here so that everybody understands like he was showing before, this is an ongoing continuation of a plan.

02:04:54.053 --> 02:05:01.195
It's Congress, it's the executive branch, and all the traitors that are involved in this controlled demolition over the last decades.

02:05:02.655 --> 02:05:19.420
And so DOD is a very bad place to stop because it's like blaming Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball players for the fact that the rules in the game suck, or the game is boring, or they go to too many commercials.

02:05:22.301 --> 02:05:22.621
You see?

02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:28.175
The NFL commercial breaks are not the responsibility of the NFL players.

02:05:28.255 --> 02:05:33.459
So to get mad at the NFL players for how many commercials are shown during their games would be crazy.

02:05:33.499 --> 02:05:44.929
To get mad at the DOD for them doing what the executive branch planners have set forth in motion decades ago, as Scott just showed you, is not really the right place to start, or stop, rather.

02:05:45.569 --> 02:05:53.880
I really think this is a mistake, which is still kind of an artifact in his presentation from his interaction with people like Sasha Latupovit.

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:54.942
It frightens me a lot.

02:05:56.704 --> 02:05:58.185
because we've got to be very careful.

02:05:58.245 --> 02:06:09.051
The DoD is composed of an awful lot of God-fearing patriots who are unwittingly, he said it in this talk, unwittingly just doing what they think is right.

02:06:09.531 --> 02:06:26.020
And I guarantee you that the DoD is a place where a lot of people unwittingly do just what they think is right and assume that the people who are giving the orders above them have the requisite reasons for giving an order that might seem questionable on its face.

02:06:27.779 --> 02:06:36.887
like a mandate for a transfection against a gain-of-function virus that the classified cables have suggested are going around.

02:06:39.409 --> 02:06:40.190
Stop lying!

02:06:40.811 --> 02:06:50.039
It's all lies, ladies and gentlemen, layers and layers of lies with people like Robert Malone and Tony Fauci very malevolently coordinating their actions over decades.

02:06:50.891 --> 02:07:00.633
The Brooke Jackson case was just dismissed August 9th because the government convinced the judge that if this case gets out, it would go against public health policy.

02:07:00.653 --> 02:07:02.954
Remember, public health policy is to kill us.

02:07:03.394 --> 02:07:05.094
That's why the case was dismissed.

02:07:05.555 --> 02:07:12.996
So this division, the public health division is in charge of implementing future product lines.

02:07:13.376 --> 02:07:16.357
Of course, this is all things to kill us.

02:07:16.457 --> 02:07:18.318
All right, so then let's dig further.

02:07:18.358 --> 02:07:19.698
Let's go to the next slide, Don.

02:07:25.652 --> 02:07:40.123
Okay, so the Bureau of Justice, they have implemented an emergency preparedness and response program that's consistent with the military being in charge.

02:07:40.163 --> 02:07:45.587
So now when you get it down to the local police and sheriff level, they've gotta have training to implement this.

02:07:46.548 --> 02:07:50.371
Over on the upper left-hand side, this is the belief driving all of this.

02:07:50.431 --> 02:07:55.275
So they write, for most viral diseases, however, there is no,

02:07:55.848 --> 02:07:56.869
cure it to medicines.

02:07:57.029 --> 02:08:00.832
Once the person has caught the disease, it must and will run its course.

02:08:01.152 --> 02:08:07.877
This is why the best approach to viral diseases is to prevent them from occurring by developing a vaccine against them.

02:08:07.897 --> 02:08:09.379
So this mindset.

02:08:09.679 --> 02:08:11.020
Wow, that's amazing.

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:11.460
Involved.

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.021
Remember, they're not challenging the mindset.

02:08:13.061 --> 02:08:13.402
They're just

02:08:14.042 --> 02:08:15.343
implementing the mindset.

02:08:15.483 --> 02:08:15.984
Exactly.

02:08:16.004 --> 02:08:20.227
You see they reference that we have the legal authority from Jacobson versus Massachusetts.

02:08:20.267 --> 02:08:21.348
I referenced that before.

02:08:21.368 --> 02:08:21.908
Wow.

02:08:22.048 --> 02:08:25.571
And they have the legal authority to quarantine.

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:27.372
And this is what's going on.

02:08:28.413 --> 02:08:37.300
Those of you who have been following our substack know that I wrote a substack a couple weeks ago regarding this lady in the hospital because she happened to be at St.

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.961
Elizabeth's Hospital first

02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:41.742
And the family called us and said, well, you go visit her.

02:08:41.863 --> 02:08:43.604
So Cindy and I went to go visit her.

02:08:43.684 --> 02:08:47.366
She happened to be on the same floor that Grace was murdered in.

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:49.507
We get into her room.

02:08:50.107 --> 02:08:54.890
Ten minutes after in the room, two armed guards showed up and physically removed us.

02:08:55.230 --> 02:09:06.177
And they have the legal authority to do this because the hospitals are under military authority through the Department of Defense right now.

02:09:06.676 --> 02:09:12.279
Okay, we're not in COVID anymore, but they're under the authority of the Department of Defense.

02:09:12.339 --> 02:09:12.939
How is that?

02:09:12.979 --> 02:09:14.000
Let's go to the next slide.

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:15.961
Connecting stats all the way.

02:09:17.822 --> 02:09:25.306
So we have to be under a public health emergency for law enforcement to be involved

02:09:26.306 --> 02:09:31.350
in this idea of enforcing whatever the hospital wants.

02:09:31.610 --> 02:09:35.452
Remember, the hospital is under CMS standards of care.

02:09:35.512 --> 02:09:40.456
So whatever the hospital wants, the law enforcement has to obey.

02:09:40.476 --> 02:09:43.878
All right, so now what is the public health emergency?

02:09:43.938 --> 02:09:45.640
I have the clip up on top, August 15th.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.187
The World Health Organization declares monkeypox a public health emergency.

02:09:51.568 --> 02:09:56.215
Okay, well, that's a psyop in and of itself, because we're not under the World Health Organization.

02:09:56.555 --> 02:10:01.863
But they throw this stuff out in the media, and then people who don't know how this works think, well, you know.

02:10:02.401 --> 02:10:06.183
Thank God we live in the United States where we're not under this public health emergency.

02:10:06.564 --> 02:10:15.489
Well, we're not under that one because the health and human services secretary hasn't put us under that yet, but we are under a public health emergency.

02:10:15.810 --> 02:10:19.452
We've been under a continuous public health emergency for decades.

02:10:19.852 --> 02:10:21.873
So this has been going on for a long time.

02:10:22.254 --> 02:10:26.676
And the public health emergency we're under right now, I printed it off this morning for this podcast.

02:10:26.736 --> 02:10:27.657
It was past June 25th of 2024.

02:10:29.498 --> 02:10:37.085
And it's called the Renewal of Determination that a Public Emergency Exists for the Opioid Crisis.

02:10:37.486 --> 02:10:46.354
So the opioid crisis, first public health emergency passed October, not passed, was waived into law on October 26th of 2017.

02:10:47.194 --> 02:10:51.078
Every three months a public health emergency has to be renewed.

02:10:51.414 --> 02:10:57.715
So this one, every three months now since 2017, this public health emergency was renewed.

02:10:57.755 --> 02:10:59.916
It was renewed again on June 25th of 24.

02:11:00.856 --> 02:11:16.839
So you can bet in September 24th or whatever day is 90 days, this will get renewed again because they want the hospital systems, the entire medical industrial complex under

02:11:17.782 --> 02:11:22.905
the Department of Defense so that law enforcement has to implement their agenda.

02:11:23.225 --> 02:11:24.405
This is so sick.

02:11:24.625 --> 02:11:25.546
It is so evil.

02:11:28.667 --> 02:11:33.810
When I read these documents over the weekend, it's like, wow.

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:35.931
I've said many times, Satan is a legalist.

02:11:36.291 --> 02:11:37.752
All right, let's go to the next slide, Don.

02:11:42.739 --> 02:11:44.160
I got to get back to my notes here.

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:45.620
I started rambling a little bit.

02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:45.980
All right.

02:11:46.501 --> 02:11:49.122
So God warned us that this was going to happen ahead of time.

02:11:49.162 --> 02:11:50.782
I already shared Revelation 18, 23.

02:11:52.163 --> 02:11:53.383
So what is sorcery?

02:11:53.483 --> 02:11:58.806
Sorcery is the use of power gained by the assistance or control of evil spirits.

02:11:58.846 --> 02:12:00.266
You can think of it as programming.

02:12:00.766 --> 02:12:01.807
We've been programmed.

02:12:02.307 --> 02:12:05.688
We have, the government can legally program us.

02:12:05.728 --> 02:12:07.129
They can legally lie to us.

02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:08.489
So through the use of, um,

02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:15.572
dialectics and programming, we have been lied to about almost everything.

02:12:15.592 --> 02:12:17.693
In fact, I might even say everything.

02:12:18.674 --> 02:12:23.796
Michael Yeadon is going to come back on and share something that will shock just about everybody.

02:12:24.116 --> 02:12:25.437
And so then what is pharmakia?

02:12:25.857 --> 02:12:28.738
It's poison used to manipulate and control others.

02:12:28.778 --> 02:12:30.379
So what poison am I talking about?

02:12:30.419 --> 02:12:34.660
Well, this would be the whole pharmaceutical industry, vaccines,

02:12:36.946 --> 02:12:50.793
The idea of sorcery would also include the idea of virology using that power of fear that we start buying into the fear and pretty soon we're programmed because we're not asking the

02:12:51.345 --> 02:12:52.626
the why questions anymore.

02:12:52.726 --> 02:12:54.186
So God warned us ahead of time.

02:12:54.706 --> 02:12:56.027
Satan is under God.

02:12:56.447 --> 02:12:59.628
Satan has to let us know what he's going to do before he does it.

02:12:59.668 --> 02:13:05.271
But we have to learn how to discern what is going on if we want to be prepared.

02:13:05.551 --> 02:13:06.611
You don't have to do anything.

02:13:06.671 --> 02:13:11.213
So but if you want to be prepared, you really have to learn how to discern.

02:13:11.273 --> 02:13:13.834
And that's what this particular monocast is about.

02:13:13.854 --> 02:13:14.295
All right.

02:13:14.335 --> 02:13:16.135
Let's go to we're almost done here.

02:13:16.155 --> 02:13:17.656
Let's go to the next slide, Don.

02:13:21.437 --> 02:13:28.242
God said in 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, verse 10, 12, that they perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.

02:13:28.302 --> 02:13:33.205
For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion so they will believe the lie.

02:13:33.686 --> 02:13:38.509
And so that all will be condemned to have not believed the truth, but have delighted in wickedness.

02:13:38.829 --> 02:13:40.210
So what is the powerful delusion?

02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:41.151
There's all kinds of them.

02:13:41.791 --> 02:13:47.255
So I'm not calling one the, it's just, I would say he sends a powerful delusion.

02:13:47.876 --> 02:13:50.698
And if you look in the, Satan is,

02:13:51.696 --> 02:13:53.917
I mean, we can come up with a lot of these, right?

02:13:53.937 --> 02:14:00.060
We can come up with the idea that is it a natural virus or is it a lab-leak gain-of-function virus?

02:14:01.721 --> 02:14:08.884
Should we test vaccines for vulnerability in certain genetic backgrounds so that we can make it safe for everybody?

02:14:10.445 --> 02:14:15.169
I don't know, look for a specific component of the vaccines that some people are vulnerable to.

02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:23.235
These kinds of limited spectrums of debate are essentially dialectic programming, dialectic programs.

02:14:23.295 --> 02:14:32.823
They are limited spectrums of debate, and there are people that are curating them and pretending to participate in them very vigorously, and that is how we are governed.

02:14:33.283 --> 02:14:40.448
That is what scott is talking about here bullet using evil versus less evil dialectics And in fact, he controls both sides.

02:14:40.868 --> 02:15:00.480
I see the great reset as the ultimate setup for the great awakening So we have revelation 13 happening esoterically in this battle for souls We have this evil being exposed So why so the angel of light can solve everything and and we willfully submit to that control structure set up by satan

02:15:00.964 --> 02:15:18.717
All right, so I'm gonna play a clip here, Michael Heaton's gonna come back on, and he is going to do really a great job explaining the evil versus less evil dialectic with the medical industrial complex that we are living through right now.

02:15:18.837 --> 02:15:19.918
Go ahead and play the clip, Don.

02:15:20.518 --> 02:15:29.225
Actually, something I need to mention, I've only learned in the last three weeks, and so you probably won't have heard it, but it all fits when I say it.

02:15:30.239 --> 02:15:37.647
You know that there was a team hero, the alternative media people, not me, people who are a hundred times more famous around the world.

02:15:38.668 --> 02:15:41.891
I won't mention them at this particular point, but you all know who I'm thinking.

02:15:41.931 --> 02:15:43.653
So many doctors who are Americans.

02:15:44.935 --> 02:15:48.118
And as soon as the pandemic... Americans?

02:15:48.398 --> 02:15:49.740
They're not just Americans.

02:15:51.704 --> 02:15:52.704
Isn't that interesting?

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:59.387
There's also a lot of people from the UK, like Claire Craig and Thomas Binder and Michael Yeadon.

02:15:59.447 --> 02:16:03.048
And there's a lot of people from the EU that spoke out too.

02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:18.074
The ones that toured the world, though, were almost all Americans, like Stephen Hadfield and Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole and Pierre Corey.

02:16:20.091 --> 02:16:23.574
Ryan Cole may have gotten cold feet, kind of disappeared from the whole show.

02:16:23.614 --> 02:16:29.698
He had money before the pandemic, so he might've figured it out by watching me, and then just kind of withdrew himself.

02:16:29.798 --> 02:16:33.601
But he's going to the International COVID Summit 6 in Tokyo.

02:16:33.641 --> 02:16:43.509
He's on the funny poster with the ships and with the, it looks like she just got out of bed, Meryl Ness, and in the center, Robert Malone, like it's some kind of movie poster.

02:16:47.519 --> 02:16:52.224
arrived, they came up with early treatment for COVID-19, didn't they?

02:16:52.584 --> 02:16:54.045
And they pushed and pushed and pushed.

02:16:55.327 --> 02:17:07.538
Robert Malone did that with the idea that the domain server was actually using AI to identify those early treatments and then by fighting about those early treatments and whether or not they were being censored by the FDA or Fauci,

02:17:08.911 --> 02:17:11.332
We bought into the illusion of the pandemic.

02:17:11.372 --> 02:17:18.474
We bought into the mystery of the novel virus and went right along with it for almost two years.

02:17:18.514 --> 02:17:19.634
That's what they did.

02:17:19.694 --> 02:17:27.557
That's what Kirsch did, and Weinstein did, and Malone did, and NASS did, and the no virus people did.

02:17:27.717 --> 02:17:28.437
Everybody did it.

02:17:30.194 --> 02:17:34.458
I, at first I thought there was a virus and so it was great that they were coming out with treatments.

02:17:35.238 --> 02:17:39.542
Then later when I realized there wasn't, so I thought they were, I thought, why are they pushing this stuff?

02:17:39.582 --> 02:17:47.228
I thought, they're pushing harmless placebos on the worried well, and they're providing a belief structure that really is a pandemic.

02:17:47.248 --> 02:17:51.912
I thought, that's why would these clever people be going out of their way to sell you this stuff?

02:17:52.052 --> 02:17:55.035
And it's like, unfortunately, it's much worse than that.

02:17:56.155 --> 02:18:07.004
One of the center stage drugs that they want you to take, ivermectin, is one of the most violent fertility toxins I've ever come across.

02:18:08.525 --> 02:18:14.670
And I didn't know this, because like you, you probably didn't think to do the deep research, and I didn't.

02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:24.818
So someone contacted me a few weeks ago with a bloody great dossier of papers that go back from its discovery, and it's unquestionably

02:18:24.898 --> 02:18:26.339
So it shouldn't be that long, right?

02:18:26.419 --> 02:18:27.380
The ant poison.

02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:43.430
Around the doses you're being required, you're being suggested to take in rats and rabbits and in some limited studies in humans, it reduces the ability to conceive and to grow babies to term.

02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:45.151
And doesn't it fit?

02:18:46.131 --> 02:18:46.812
Doesn't it fit?

02:18:47.472 --> 02:18:51.015
Why did this, this is nothing that's major.

02:18:51.915 --> 02:18:54.877
on the world stage that's accidental, I'm afraid.

02:18:55.618 --> 02:18:56.418
That's the problem.

02:18:56.739 --> 02:19:00.942
And so now you know there's nothing major on the world stage that's accidental.

02:19:01.442 --> 02:19:02.743
Who put Ivermectin there?

02:19:03.103 --> 02:19:05.545
Well, the perpetrators did.

02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:07.751
And why did they put it there?

02:19:07.771 --> 02:19:12.176
It's like, if you don't get jabbed and avoid impacts on your facility, a good chance.

02:19:12.216 --> 02:19:28.534
Remember that Brett Weinstein was absolutely adamant in 2021 when Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch were on his podcast that ivermectin, if given to everybody for 30 days, could get us to zero COVID, which is a realistic and moral goal.

02:19:31.488 --> 02:19:33.389
And Robert Malone kind of said, yeah, maybe.

02:19:33.630 --> 02:19:35.951
And Steve Kerr said, well, maybe we need 60 days.

02:19:35.991 --> 02:19:38.153
And we also need to add silicoxib to that.

02:19:38.233 --> 02:19:44.057
But yeah, imagine if we could force drug everybody with ivermectin and silicoxib for 60 days.

02:19:44.077 --> 02:19:45.297
Yeah, we could get to zero COVID.

02:19:45.317 --> 02:19:45.818
That's cool.

02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:58.246
The domain server of DITRA was supposedly from which ivermectin was pulled because of a 3D

02:20:01.169 --> 02:20:20.426
virtual x-ray crystallography model of two enzymes created by a snap volunteer team that Robert Malone spun up in early January because he got a call from his friend, Mike Callahan, who was embedded in China and knew that there was a novel pneumonia coming our way.

02:20:20.847 --> 02:20:26.652
That's why him and his wife wrote a book that was sold on Amazon for a little while about the COVID.

02:20:31.912 --> 02:20:36.055
If you will take ivermectin instead, it gets worse.

02:20:36.655 --> 02:20:41.158
And then I'll stop talking about this because I haven't written about it yet, but it's on my mind.

02:20:41.578 --> 02:20:45.380
There are lots of other supplements that the worried will take.

02:20:46.541 --> 02:20:50.444
And again, I had thought it was mainly a money-making business.

02:20:51.184 --> 02:20:55.249
All right, a money-making business, they'll sell you K2 or whatever it is.

02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:56.971
And there's loads of things I've never heard of.

02:20:56.991 --> 02:20:59.174
You look at them in the so-called health food store.

02:20:59.734 --> 02:21:02.137
My wife will often ask me, what will this be?

02:21:02.237 --> 02:21:08.865
How many long letters are there in the Delling Pod podcast image here?

02:21:08.885 --> 02:21:10.167
How many long letters are there?

02:21:10.247 --> 02:21:11.048
I count three.

02:21:13.317 --> 02:21:14.638
I've said I've never heard of it.

02:21:15.179 --> 02:21:17.220
I was originally a biochemist and toxicologist.

02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:17.981
I've never heard of it.

02:21:18.001 --> 02:21:19.241
I have to look it up.

02:21:19.302 --> 02:21:19.722
It's real.

02:21:19.762 --> 02:21:20.342
It does exist.

02:21:21.103 --> 02:21:27.688
So I thought they were just flogging benign placebos to the worried whale just to steal money off them.

02:21:28.788 --> 02:21:30.269
Unfortunately, it's not so.

02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:40.517
Many of the supplements, including most of the really famous ones, hamper the elimination from your body of ivermectin.

02:21:42.463 --> 02:21:52.829
So if you're a person that thinks, well, I'm going to take care of my health and not have the jabs, I've got this ivermectin that'll protect me, and I've got all these other supplements, and those supplements stop your body eliminating ivermectin.

02:21:52.869 --> 02:21:55.110
It's a drug-drug, a negative drug-drug interaction.

02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:58.232
It's like, this can't be coincidence, folks.

02:22:00.693 --> 02:22:03.395
Okay, so that should rock most people to the core.

02:22:04.589 --> 02:22:09.090
Some I saw this little question in the chat, which I thought was kind of funny So I thought I'd address it.

02:22:09.210 --> 02:22:11.230
Where is God been for the last 2,000 years?

02:22:11.871 --> 02:22:17.572
So let me let me give you my very easy answer to where is God been for the last?

02:22:17.932 --> 02:22:32.395
2,000 years watch That's creation You could think of it as just

02:22:33.294 --> 02:22:40.256
the breath of creation on the earth, and here we are, and now time is going forward.

02:22:41.977 --> 02:22:43.017
I mean, what?

02:22:43.938 --> 02:22:50.820
Does the watchmaker have to show up and regularly do much here, or as long as I wound the watch, it's gonna unwind, right?

02:22:52.861 --> 02:23:02.724
If this was God's plan, and we're getting toward the next phase of God's plan, then the watch is still just ticking.

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:13.221
And what's happening is in His hands, like it always has been, whether you think of that as a time and a plan or whatever, I don't know.

02:23:14.661 --> 02:23:17.262
But I don't need an explanation for where's God been.

02:23:17.282 --> 02:23:18.363
He's everywhere.

02:23:18.483 --> 02:23:21.444
He's everywhere in everything and in everyone.

02:23:21.464 --> 02:23:24.706
He's not gone anywhere I know.

02:23:27.605 --> 02:23:35.409
except for maybe if you put yourself in a concrete box that was 40 feet thick in all directions, then maybe there's not much in the box.

02:23:35.489 --> 02:23:39.150
If you're not in the box and the box was empty, maybe there wouldn't be much in there.

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:39.551
I don't know.

02:23:41.051 --> 02:23:51.796
It's a weird question, really, because I don't know what people expect God to be doing if he created this world and left it to us, and we're supposed to find him

02:23:55.069 --> 02:23:58.074
I don't know really what's hard to understand about where he went.

02:23:58.354 --> 02:24:02.661
How do we know that any solution is not?

02:24:03.992 --> 02:24:10.957
from God, it's because the solutions being proposed, they don't acknowledge how we got here.

02:24:11.378 --> 02:24:14.060
So consequently, there's no repentance.

02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:19.964
What Michael Yeaton is laying out is the idea that Satan controls both sides.

02:24:20.024 --> 02:24:25.728
The evil side, in this case, the jab, the less evil side, Ivermectin, he controls both sides.

02:24:26.148 --> 02:24:29.711
If you're interested in drilling this down and really learning a lot,

02:24:30.591 --> 02:24:34.153
Don and I put together a four-part series called The Matrix Revealed.

02:24:34.853 --> 02:24:41.936
It's on the Rumble channel and all the other channels that we're on, and it breaks down this illusion of choice.

02:24:42.897 --> 02:24:43.897
in a very detailed way.

02:24:43.958 --> 02:24:46.098
It took me about 500 hours to put that together.

02:24:46.318 --> 02:24:50.820
And it's about six hours of listening broken to a four part series.

02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:57.642
And I'd encourage you to do that if you're interested in learning a lot more as to how Satan controls both sides.

02:24:58.143 --> 02:24:58.423
All right.

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:00.403
So then what am I suggesting?

02:25:00.443 --> 02:25:02.444
Let's go to the next slide.

02:25:02.584 --> 02:25:04.945
We always got to end with some hope and

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:07.861
The key is repentance and after repentance.

02:25:07.901 --> 02:25:08.702
So then what do we do?

02:25:08.882 --> 02:25:17.186
Once we've repented for our fear of following the satanic agenda, our rejection of God, what do we do?

02:25:17.706 --> 02:25:29.572
In Ephesians chapter 5, 15 through 17 says, pay careful attention then to how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil.

02:25:30.222 --> 02:25:35.004
Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.

02:25:35.324 --> 02:25:38.785
So redeeming the time, now we can walk without fear.

02:25:39.225 --> 02:25:41.286
And what do we do with that time?

02:25:41.366 --> 02:25:44.147
We're all going to be accountable someday when we meet our maker.

02:25:44.207 --> 02:25:45.327
What do we do with our time?

02:25:46.188 --> 02:25:53.090
And Ephesians 5, 11 says, have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

02:25:53.430 --> 02:25:57.772
So that's one thing we're responsible to do with our time after repentance.

02:25:58.411 --> 02:26:04.273
And what I would challenge everybody to do is to understand that we are performance oriented.

02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:06.794
And this is another one of the big lies of Satan.

02:26:07.394 --> 02:26:09.875
We have to do something to please God.

02:26:09.975 --> 02:26:10.655
That's a lie.

02:26:11.215 --> 02:26:13.096
God accepts us as we are.

02:26:13.636 --> 02:26:19.217
And then once we submit to him, his instructions become very clear.

02:26:19.277 --> 02:26:23.019
And then our responsibility is to implement his instructions.

02:26:23.419 --> 02:26:27.140
We're so used to, if you think about, if you're going to go hunting,

02:26:27.873 --> 02:26:30.294
You don't fire your weapon first.

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:35.057
First you get ready, then you aim, then you fire.

02:26:35.237 --> 02:26:36.537
So it's ready, aim, fire.

02:26:37.218 --> 02:26:40.039
And so repentance gets us ready.

02:26:40.059 --> 02:26:50.264
Aiming, we have the relationship with God, and then firing is our action after we have repented and know what God wants of us.

02:26:50.936 --> 02:26:55.039
All right, so then let's go to a couple of quick closing slides.

02:26:55.079 --> 02:27:04.367
So our website, if you're interested in following the research that I posted, stories about grace, our store is now up and well.

02:27:05.408 --> 02:27:08.230
Subscribing to our newsletter is in the upper right-hand corner.

02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:09.071
Please do so.

02:27:09.991 --> 02:27:16.373
We have our own documentary, Breaking the Oath, that was put out in May of 2023.

02:27:16.793 --> 02:27:22.635
We're gonna be in a film coming up here on September 18th by Children's Health Defense and theaters nationwide.

02:27:23.475 --> 02:27:26.296
So we'd love it if you followed us and spread the word.

02:27:26.736 --> 02:27:32.157
And then the last slide before we close with a tribute to Grace.

02:27:33.238 --> 02:27:36.358
This is a picture outside the courthouse on July 14th of 2023.

02:27:38.739 --> 02:27:47.027
After we had our first victory, the judge dismissed all of the motions to dismiss, and the attorney said I had to wear the suit, so I did.

02:27:48.108 --> 02:27:49.869
Our daughter, Jessica, is on my right.

02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:51.731
My wife, Cindy, is on the left.

02:27:52.832 --> 02:27:54.834
We're here because they messed with the wrong girl.

02:27:56.584 --> 02:27:57.965
God bless you all for watching.

02:27:58.926 --> 02:28:00.087
I'm not going to come back on.

02:28:00.107 --> 02:28:04.111
Don's going to close us out with a tribute to Grace.

02:28:04.171 --> 02:28:08.435
Remember at the beginning, I showed you a picture of Grace in her Elvis costume.

02:28:08.475 --> 02:28:09.436
So go ahead, Don.

02:28:14.561 --> 02:28:18.064
You look like an angel.

02:28:18.804 --> 02:28:20.866
Walk like an angel.

02:28:22.785 --> 02:28:28.668
You talk like an angel, but I got wise.

02:28:29.148 --> 02:28:31.389
You're the devil in disguise.

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:33.390
Oh, yes, you are.

02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:35.311
Devil in disguise.

02:28:39.073 --> 02:28:42.834
You fooled me with your kisses.

02:28:42.894 --> 02:28:45.496
You cheated and you schemed.

02:28:46.256 --> 02:28:49.438
Heaven knows how you lied to me.

02:28:49.798 --> 02:28:52.319
You're not the way you seem.

02:28:53.905 --> 02:29:08.031
You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise.

02:29:08.532 --> 02:29:11.233
You're the devil in disguise.

02:29:19.166 --> 02:29:25.032
I thought that I was in heaven, but I was sure surprised.

02:29:25.652 --> 02:29:31.678
Heaven help me, I didn't see the devil in your eyes.

02:29:33.259 --> 02:29:35.521
You look like an angel.

02:29:35.601 --> 02:29:36.922
Walk like an angel.

02:29:37.283 --> 02:29:39.244
Talk like an angel.

02:29:45.836 --> 02:29:48.298
It's interesting what Jeff says there in the chat.

02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:52.463
The great lie of our time that God accepts us as we are.

02:29:52.503 --> 02:29:58.729
We are only accepted when the father gets us to his son who lived perfectly.

02:30:00.531 --> 02:30:02.372
Interesting point, Jeff.

02:30:03.253 --> 02:30:07.938
I don't think that Grace's dad got it wrong or said it that way to be deceptive.

02:30:09.972 --> 02:30:15.596
but more to make sure that people understand they need to be humble in the presence of God.

02:30:15.657 --> 02:30:22.082
And I don't know what this cartoon's all about, so I guess I'm kinda, I don't know, I'm kinda done with the cartoon.

02:30:22.362 --> 02:30:23.683
I'm gonna fast forward it a little bit.

02:30:23.703 --> 02:30:25.304
Okay, that's probably the end of the show, okay.

02:30:25.824 --> 02:30:34.251
That was just dedicated to Grace, of course, because she likes Elvis, so I'll let that one slide, if you will.

02:30:37.014 --> 02:30:37.776
Let's see here.

02:30:37.816 --> 02:30:40.583
Yeah, that was deprogramming with Grace's dad.

02:30:40.623 --> 02:30:43.791
You can find him on Rumble at the same handle.

02:30:46.257 --> 02:30:50.799
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, and the USA is a criminal enterprise.

02:30:50.839 --> 02:30:59.562
We need a new consensus about transfection and healthy humans always being criminally negligent, and we need a new consensus in our kids that RNA cannot pandemic.

02:30:59.602 --> 02:31:03.224
Thank you very much for joining me and watching Scott's stream with me.

02:31:03.244 --> 02:31:07.725
I hope you will share his work, maybe become a follower of his on Rumble.

02:31:09.386 --> 02:31:16.429
Don't be afraid to share that original link of his stream and I will be here again tomorrow even though it's Saturday.

02:31:16.449 --> 02:31:22.532
I'm going to try and put together a little streak of days in a row here so we'll see how far we get.

02:31:22.572 --> 02:31:24.353
The last streak was 53 so I don't know

02:31:25.143 --> 02:31:34.288
I'll make that or not, but we will get back to Biology 101 next week on Tuesday and Thursday along with the courses of Matt Briggs.

02:31:34.348 --> 02:31:48.215
I apologize for this week being a little bit shoddy, but the reason why is compounded with kids in school and the transition to homeschooling and also a sick dog who needs regular injections that cause her to feel like she's having puppies.

02:31:48.875 --> 02:31:59.179
And so I've been spending a lot of time with my dog in the morning and then a lot of time with my dog in the evening when she has this hour and a half of hormone-induced lameness.

02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:03.041
And so that makes planning a little harder and whatever.

02:32:03.081 --> 02:32:05.062
I'm giving you excuses that don't mean anything.

02:32:05.102 --> 02:32:10.544
But if you liked what you saw, please go to Giga Home Biological and find a way to support the stream.

02:32:10.604 --> 02:32:11.985
Stacy, I got your email.

02:32:12.025 --> 02:32:14.426
I'll fix that as soon as I can today or tomorrow.

02:32:15.106 --> 02:32:18.309
Hopefully you will see the refund and then you can let me know.

02:32:19.210 --> 02:32:33.783
And yeah, if you wanna share this stream after broadcast, maybe consider sharing the website, thepeertubehttps://stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:32:33.803 --> 02:32:35.224
Thank you very much and I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:32:48.226 --> 02:32:49.607
Oh, is it a forward slash?

02:32:49.767 --> 02:32:51.968
Sorry, I... Yeah, I'm an idiot.

02:32:52.088 --> 02:32:52.449
All right.

02:32:52.669 --> 02:32:57.252
Well, you see, I don't read, I don't read slashes out very often.

02:32:58.753 --> 02:32:58.973
Yeah.

02:32:59.873 --> 02:33:02.075
I can just say slash slash, I guess, right?

02:33:05.037 --> 02:33:05.817
Thank you guys.

02:33:05.857 --> 02:33:06.878
Good to see you, Jeffrey.

02:33:09.501 --> 02:33:22.173
The first person in the chat was actually I am Katniss today You have to send me your mail and I can get the cash in the mail And like I said, I'll see you tomorrow.

02:33:22.193 --> 02:33:26.957
I'm not sure what time it'll probably be in the morning before noon I think my boys want to go

02:33:28.677 --> 02:33:32.478
I think they want to go to basketball at like 11 or something.

02:33:32.498 --> 02:33:38.641
So I'll probably try to do an early morning one depending on where my daughter goes or what I can manage to do with her.

02:33:38.901 --> 02:33:41.142
Anyway, we'll see you tomorrow one way or another, I promise.

02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:40.521
Thanks everybody, I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:34:40.762 --> 02:34:41.626
Happy Friday!
