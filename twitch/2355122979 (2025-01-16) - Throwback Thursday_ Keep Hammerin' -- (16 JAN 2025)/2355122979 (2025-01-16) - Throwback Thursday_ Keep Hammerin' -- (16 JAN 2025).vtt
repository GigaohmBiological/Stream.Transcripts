WEBVTT

00:24.502 --> 00:27.704
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:28.324 --> 00:29.085
Stop lying.

00:36.089 --> 00:37.350
Good afternoon.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.431
Good afternoon, Tazik's Cube.

00:39.551 --> 00:43.154
Jeff from Earth in right at the start.

00:43.274 --> 00:43.934
I am Katniss.

00:43.974 --> 00:44.895
Good to see everybody.

00:44.995 --> 00:46.436
Atari Mama, good to see you.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.817
It is the 16th of January, 2025.

00:48.857 --> 00:49.417
My name is Jonathan Cui.

00:52.299 --> 00:56.962
I am a former tenure-seeking academic biologist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:57.002 --> 01:08.928
You can find me on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, under the last name C-O-U-E-Y, with my first initials J and J. Hello, everybody in the chat.

01:08.968 --> 01:09.349
Good to see you.

01:09.369 --> 01:14.832
It goes right back to the origins of modern democracy in the English revolutions of the 17th century.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.614
English Revolution of the 17th century.

01:18.174 --> 01:37.001
At that time, great concern was expressed over popular agitators, itinerant preachers and workers with their little printing presses and their pamphlets and their public speeches, which were removing the cloak of mystery behind which the Parliament and the King

01:37.481 --> 01:42.342
were carrying out their much narrower struggle than when you read about in history books.

01:42.622 --> 02:01.748
Now, these people were, in their words, they were people who wanted to be represented not by lords and gentry, but by men of their own kind, men who know the people's swords, quoting from Leveller pamphlets.

02:02.328 --> 02:06.669
And observing their activities, one contemporary historian warned

02:07.133 --> 02:18.841
that by revealing the workings of power, they will make the people so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a civil rule, which is a big problem.

02:19.522 --> 02:33.572
Well, well after these radical Democrats had been crushed by about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.913
the greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

02:39.854 --> 02:43.017
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.358
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:47.300 --> 02:47.700
Isolation?

02:47.720 --> 02:48.081
What was it?

02:48.221 --> 02:49.362
Isolation and purification.

02:51.163 --> 02:51.883
Of the virus?

02:51.963 --> 02:52.164
Yes.

02:53.425 --> 02:55.206
Well, you isolate a virus by

03:01.989 --> 03:04.471
finding the virus which causes a disease.

03:05.132 --> 03:09.996
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

03:10.777 --> 03:12.818
I don't understand what the issue.

03:12.919 --> 03:18.383
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

03:19.464 --> 03:20.625
No, it depends on how they used it.

03:21.066 --> 03:22.367
Okay.

03:22.507 --> 03:24.909
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

03:27.452 --> 03:29.394
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

03:29.454 --> 03:31.316
I mean, he actually isolated it.

03:31.576 --> 03:35.501
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:35.581 --> 03:37.643
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:43.329 --> 03:48.955
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

03:49.616 --> 04:01.848
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

04:02.149 --> 04:04.091
It's just a big hassle in the end.

04:06.078 --> 04:28.978
know when when we have this new pandemic that is you know got 75 mortality and uh it it's not it's there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be just it it's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

04:28.998 --> 04:32.661
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:32.801 --> 04:33.942
I'm afraid that the latest

04:35.485 --> 04:37.006
But you can tell if someone's lying.

04:37.627 --> 04:39.408
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:41.210 --> 04:41.910
And I have lied.

04:41.931 --> 04:42.971
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:42.991 --> 04:43.932
I don't want to lie.

04:44.413 --> 04:45.774
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:45.874 --> 04:46.895
I try not to be a liar.

04:46.935 --> 04:47.795
I don't want to be a liar.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.118
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.362
I think truth is good for kids.

04:55.782 --> 04:59.625
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

05:00.086 --> 05:01.727
We want everybody to feel good.

05:01.847 --> 05:03.809
That's not the way life is.

05:06.292 --> 05:25.929
the rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it sweaty palms this is so crazy like goosebumps this is so crazy i feel so nervous like what in the world man he introduced

05:26.991 --> 05:45.541
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:45.561 --> 05:55.126
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

05:59.349 --> 06:00.531
I don't care how you get there.

06:00.551 --> 06:03.234
I don't care what you do to get there.

06:03.254 --> 06:05.898
The goal is to win.

06:30.405 --> 06:47.037
what a long strange trip it's been ladies and gentlemen hello welcome to the show this is a giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist we're gonna try and disseminate some knowledge which might help dispel their enchantment today

06:47.637 --> 07:00.610
I think there are a few things that we can need to keep hammering on and so I'm back again today to say a lot of the same stuff I've said over the last few days, maybe with a little more accuracy and frame it in the context of where we are on this timeline.

07:01.150 --> 07:08.898
Try to expand your time horizon so that you understand more than the last three weeks and the coming two weeks has the relevant timeline.

07:08.918 --> 07:10.920
Your consciousness is prime real estate.

07:11.460 --> 07:23.044
And by allowing your consciousness to roam freely on social media, essentially, you have allowed them to kind of replace what is true with what is perceived to be true.

07:23.064 --> 07:24.665
They have complete control there.

07:25.905 --> 07:37.810
And this illusion goes back all the way to the foundation of our money system, of course, and when they just had newspapers and TV, they were already doing it, but now you can

07:38.490 --> 07:47.834
Rest assured that with cable TV and with social media now, our culture is effectively being destroyed by these people.

07:47.894 --> 07:55.917
And it may not even be in their own minds what they're doing, but they are part of a machine that has been doing it for a very, very long time.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.221
Fortunately for us, our history is still available.

07:59.281 --> 08:06.890
It can still be collected and archived and organized and summarized and shown to people who can see, even when they're shown.

08:07.471 --> 08:10.795
And we've got to realize that not everybody's going to see it, but our kids

08:11.576 --> 08:12.816
our kids could be shown.

08:14.037 --> 08:17.958
Children can see anything if shown, even things that aren't there.

08:17.998 --> 08:35.282
And so we have to be sure that we teach them what these people believe, what these people are trying to accomplish, and how to keep our kids out of this slavery, I think, is to make sure that our kids get offline instead of ever, ever more permanently online.

08:36.122 --> 08:42.405
Um, they've known for a long time, ladies and gentlemen, Edward Bernays, Noam Chomsky, they've all been able to enunciate it.

08:42.906 --> 08:44.767
It is a spectacular commitment to lies.

08:44.807 --> 08:46.988
That's all that is required.

08:47.328 --> 08:49.329
Um, that's, that's the reality.

08:49.369 --> 08:55.412
That's all that's required is a spectacular commitment to lies, a story.

08:55.712 --> 08:59.234
If you stay focused and committed to the story, um,

09:00.816 --> 09:01.677
then we're in trouble.

09:01.717 --> 09:10.809
And ladies and gentlemen, I want to suggest that if we stand firm against this, I think actually we can save our children.

09:12.475 --> 09:13.696
because it was our fault.

09:15.497 --> 09:20.000
A message to the kids out there, children can't give informed consent.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.121
That was on your parents.

09:21.181 --> 09:25.684
The illusion is only sustained through your parents' active participation.

09:25.704 --> 09:34.990
If your parents had the guts and the wherewithal to reject this with united noncompliance, none of y'all would have ever had a mask.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.932
None of you college students would have ever gotten given a test.

09:38.472 --> 09:41.895
None of you college students would have ever gotten transfected.

09:42.735 --> 09:48.660
That's the reality of it, and we need, as adults, to cop to that failure.

09:49.240 --> 09:54.564
I tried, a lot of people tried, but in the end, the vast majority of adults were not there.

09:56.185 --> 10:04.431
And it's partly the system's fault, it's partly this military operation's fault, but it's also the lack of principles in an emergency.

10:04.912 --> 10:07.574
And that's on you, every adult.

10:07.974 --> 10:08.534
That's on you.

10:09.856 --> 10:14.100
So what you can do to make up for that is to learn the biology that gets your kids out.

10:15.243 --> 10:24.468
and learn who should have done known better and who knew better and identify them and realize that the only reason why you're just hearing about it now is because of them.

10:25.268 --> 10:34.613
Because all those people know me and probably are responsible for keeping you away from me in this illusion of consensus on social media.

10:35.214 --> 10:37.515
Ladies and gentlemen, I do think there's hope in our history.

10:37.535 --> 10:43.158
You just got to learn it, archive it, and realize what's going on.

10:45.361 --> 10:46.421
It's all there for you.

10:47.162 --> 10:51.644
All the way back to HIV and the origins of cancer theory.

10:52.665 --> 10:55.567
Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.

10:55.607 --> 10:57.988
But I hope that this time it could be different.

10:58.649 --> 11:06.674
Because social media has inevitably exposed them in a way that I don't think that they ever thought that they would be exposed.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.835
And going off script,

11:09.075 --> 11:17.698
Going off script on social media I think is proving a lot more difficult than they thought, given the number of podcasts and the number of places these people have to be.

11:18.439 --> 11:24.041
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

11:24.541 --> 11:28.863
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal, RNA cannot pandemic, and the U.S.

11:29.463 --> 11:32.304
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

11:33.345 --> 11:38.599
Welcome to the show, welcome to the show, welcome to the show, welcome to the show.

11:40.270 --> 11:41.331
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

11:41.391 --> 11:42.491
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

11:42.751 --> 11:47.354
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

11:47.394 --> 11:48.595
January 16th, 2025.

11:48.815 --> 11:51.296
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.657
This is the back of my garage.

11:52.737 --> 11:54.998
The blinds are closed, but it's snowing outside.

11:55.038 --> 12:01.422
We had a remote instruction day at the local high school where Matthew Crooks also graduated.

12:01.482 --> 12:02.823
My son is now a freshman.

12:04.964 --> 12:06.885
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

12:06.966 --> 12:08.807
My family's got it all on the line here.

12:09.848 --> 12:15.171
And this message is about what you have on the line versus what we have on the line.

12:16.052 --> 12:29.161
And I want you to just realize, and when I say you, I mean Jessica Rose and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Pierre Cory and Peter McCullough.

12:29.922 --> 12:32.204
And I mean, the list is long.

12:34.092 --> 12:47.530
Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and Jessica Hockett and Joe Lee and Sasha Latipova and I mean I can keep going it's just all off the top of my head all of these people

12:48.712 --> 12:51.193
are part of an elaborate illusion machine.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.854
I don't really know who pays for them.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.315
I don't have a good idea of who hired them.

12:56.415 --> 12:58.736
I don't know if they were all hired at the same time.

12:59.276 --> 13:01.917
I don't know if it's attached to military or private interests.

13:02.017 --> 13:02.818
I really don't know.

13:02.838 --> 13:16.023
It's a crime scene and quite frankly, I don't think it's my responsibility to come up with an exact explanation for what these people are doing when it's so easy to see that what they've done is incongruent with being a hero.

13:20.543 --> 13:43.031
So I do have a lot of people to thank including all of my subscribers and the people that just give money every once in a while or often we do manage to pay the bills here, which is a rent and and and utilities and and sandwiches and frozen pizzas and a little dog food, so One way or another it's happening and it's gonna keep happening and as long as that's a

13:44.110 --> 13:44.691
That's true.

13:44.751 --> 13:50.295
I feel some obligation to be here and to be working this beat.

13:50.776 --> 13:52.017
I don't know why that's on.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.017
Let's turn that off.

13:53.738 --> 13:55.940
And let's get this up here and that up here.

13:56.841 --> 13:58.222
So healthy people don't get sick.

13:58.282 --> 14:00.283
If you're a college kid who went back to

14:01.084 --> 14:29.330
university during the mandates of 2021 and tested every week or submitted to two weeks of quarantine when you tested positive, or maybe even took a vaccine in order to go back to your school and pay an exorbitant amount of tuition for very little education, I want to apologize on behalf of all the adults in your life and all of the adults in your community for not having saved you from that fiasco, for not having just told you to take a year off.

14:30.356 --> 14:41.502
and instead sending you back into the mouth of a system that was definitely did not have your interest in mind and most likely took those test remnants and sold them to the highest bidder.

14:42.222 --> 14:54.489
And I would suggest that any college kid that went back to one of these schools where they were forced to test every week should start to think about organizing a class action lawsuit against your university with other fellow students

14:55.109 --> 15:00.632
in order to pursue the possibility that your university may have profited very greatly from that system.

15:01.692 --> 15:18.100
And maybe even just a small number of faculty members or a small number of bureaucratic members, you know, or deans or whatever it is, but they may have even had a contract to sell those remnants ready to go before the remnants were even going to be needed.

15:20.481 --> 15:24.183
And all of these things could represent great big gaping

15:25.120 --> 15:51.294
holes where sunlight can shine through on 2020 and 2021 when I believe most of the significant malfeasance was started and the the patterns of malfeasance were established that still are ongoing today and are ignored by this health freedom movement that's despite having decades to fight against this this bullshit

15:52.875 --> 16:06.569
public health narrative have never gotten to the point where they can say it usefully for young people and usefully for new parents and usefully for people who are just trying to figure out, why should I listen to you?

16:06.629 --> 16:15.318
Well, because your feelings about common sense and how the world works should be reinforced by your health and well-being.

16:17.369 --> 16:26.185
The way that you interact with your world, the way that your body interacts with the world, what you do with your life on a daily basis should contribute to your well-being.

16:26.225 --> 16:29.652
And if it doesn't, then something is drastically wrong.

16:31.109 --> 16:48.193
And our system is built in such a way that poisoning is ignored, sedentary behavior is ignored, pollution is ignored, and intramuscular injection of toxins is ignored as sources of distress and sickness and illness and chronic illness and cancer.

16:49.454 --> 17:15.790
And instead, we're supposed to focus on, I guess, specific incarnations of those things, like, I guess, 5G, or LED lights, or dyes that have numbers and colors, or processed foods, without mentioning glyphosate, or GMO plants, or animals, or insects.

17:16.738 --> 17:22.240
without mentioning anything about cosmetics.

17:22.260 --> 17:24.021
The list is endless.

17:24.061 --> 17:39.228
I don't know how to improvise too well over this contradiction in the way that the purported health freedom movement to a great extent hasn't moved us that far forward, hasn't scored any touchdowns in the last 10 years and certainly not during the pandemic.

17:40.199 --> 17:47.743
And we need to start scoring touchdowns before these college kids that we've almost lost as young adults are permanently lost.

17:48.263 --> 17:57.108
Before these children that we have are permanently lost to the teachers who are saying that their parents don't know what they're talking about.

17:58.149 --> 18:01.030
We're in a desperate situation right now in America.

18:02.051 --> 18:05.853
And we are currently being led to believe that somehow we're gonna be saved.

18:08.052 --> 18:15.459
I don't even understand how it is possible that we're going to be saved when nothing significant is changing.

18:15.519 --> 18:20.323
No one is talking about how intramuscular injection of medicine in general is kind of dumb.

18:21.684 --> 18:28.250
We're not even remotely close to questioning the methodology of vaccination in general.

18:30.792 --> 18:33.655
And we're not even remotely close to questioning the

18:35.956 --> 18:45.858
giant assumptions that are made as we spend billions of dollars a year under the pretense that evolution because DNA or DNA therefore evolution.

18:47.031 --> 19:05.480
hunting down causes of disease, even mental illness, by trying to look at animal models and paying the salaries of and the bureaucracy of all of these universities that are investigating these meaningless animal models under this meaningless pretense that everything can be determined by genes.

19:06.340 --> 19:10.502
Physics and chemistry is just life, but we don't know how it works yet.

19:13.922 --> 19:20.804
We've got to be very careful that we do not pass that bad biology 101 to our children like it was passed to us.

19:22.245 --> 19:28.507
We have to start using very precise language for young parents so that they understand that we mean business.

19:28.587 --> 19:38.611
Like, hey, since you're going to have a kid soon, just consider this phrase, intramuscular injection is the single worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

19:41.007 --> 19:45.348
Try to get a young parent to be curious about the truth.

19:46.988 --> 20:05.892
Try to get a young parent to consider the possibility that a baby, when it's born, if the parent is healthy, if the pregnancy is healthy, then the need for augmentation at birth or anytime soon after birth is absurd.

20:08.137 --> 20:14.081
I think we really, really need to have doctors start to understand that that message is lost.

20:14.141 --> 20:14.641
It's gone.

20:14.701 --> 20:17.163
Maybe they've never even heard it or thought of it that way.

20:17.723 --> 20:20.785
But we need to return to the basics, the fundamentals.

20:21.785 --> 20:26.308
It's what I tell my seventh grade B team in basketball every night.

20:27.009 --> 20:30.711
Fundamentals, ladies and gentlemen, cut in front of your man, not behind him.

20:35.700 --> 20:39.243
Like, we've got to go back to the fundamentals.

20:40.845 --> 20:48.272
New Biology 101, for me, the fundamental idea would be that life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

20:48.853 --> 20:58.582
And so the limitation of the Human Genome Project and the whole assumption of evolution because DNA is that nowhere can we

21:00.436 --> 21:11.483
reasonably decode the trajectory across time that would necessarily need to be encoded in DNA if the premise evolution because DNA is true.

21:14.205 --> 21:25.653
And if you presume that there's no need to encode the way that is something built and the way that is maintained and changed and grows over time to maturity

21:27.182 --> 21:39.437
then you're really giving these people way too much with what their assumption edifies, what they can assume about the world based on that idea.

21:41.299 --> 21:44.623
And I think that there is a very good, albeit short,

21:46.584 --> 22:15.195
about how this makes sense and theirs doesn't and how we can start to think about biology in a different way going forward given this idea and and and I can think of a lot of and drawn already a lot of graphical representations to represent what they've done to us with that bad biology and how how it is artificially enticing to think that all has been explained there and it absolutely positively has not because

22:17.313 --> 22:21.755
Life is better characterized in the English language this way.

22:24.036 --> 22:26.178
And so this is a much better starting point.

22:26.218 --> 22:29.699
In fact, it's a much better model for what we're trying to understand.

22:30.300 --> 22:44.047
And a much better model means that we can better explain the coexistence of all of these different pattern integrities and understand them as being interrelated in a much different way than evolution because DNA

22:45.592 --> 22:47.273
makes them interrelated.

22:49.795 --> 22:58.162
Because evolution, because DNA makes them interrelated by a physics and chemistry sort of way.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.741
and a linear programming sort of way.

23:02.141 --> 23:12.069
Whereas if you think of life as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, it becomes even much more difficult to draw the borders from one pattern integrity to another.

23:12.109 --> 23:20.376
And how those pattern integrities interact is a much less obvious physical and chemical interaction

23:21.303 --> 23:25.107
if that interaction can have ramifications across time.

23:25.267 --> 23:33.014
If, you know, like you're paddling over here in your river and they're paddling over there in their river, but then when you put your paddle in the water, it affects them.

23:36.072 --> 23:51.999
And all of that is discounted, it is missing from the evolution because DNA model, because that has to be outside of us, that has to be separate from us, because the unit of change is the species, it's not the individual.

23:54.741 --> 23:58.182
The unit of change is the species makes the individual irrelevant.

24:02.113 --> 24:19.783
And it also means that governing people as inconsequential individuals makes more sense from a longer time horizon and with that bad biological understanding of the irreducible complexity that is our world.

24:22.282 --> 24:27.667
I don't know where I'm going with this, so I'm going to keep going with what I intended to say, just a random introduction there.

24:28.167 --> 24:28.928
It is 2025.

24:29.508 --> 24:41.598
I use this picture to represent what's going on because I'm trying to encourage people to remain on a time horizon that takes into account the fact that much of this narrative started in 2015.

24:44.033 --> 24:57.841
That's when Peter Daszak and Shengxi Li and Ralph Baric published their paper about SARS-CoV-2 viruses from China that everybody pointed to at the beginning of the pandemic as, oh my gosh, they made this.

24:59.302 --> 25:08.487
And in 2016, the movie Vaxxed was out and ICANN and CHD were working hard to get the word out about something already before the pandemic.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.750
And then at the start of the pandemic, those people could have said whatever they wanted to on their platform.

25:13.644 --> 25:19.051
But they, I guess, just said that we've got to have health freedom and censorship is bad.

25:21.654 --> 25:27.480
And so I think it's very, very important to understand that if we don't

25:28.735 --> 25:48.304
take back the health freedom movement, if we don't throw away this astroturf populism health freedom movement and put real doctors and real lawyers in place, it's going to be a ha-ha, not a ma-ha, and the joke is going to be on our grandkids.

25:55.362 --> 26:05.129
So I'm going to go back to October 30, 2022, and I'm going to see what I had to say and how much I got right and what I didn't get right.

26:05.249 --> 26:17.838
And then I'm going to see how I would compare what I said then to if I had a chance to present to this prestigious panel again, what I would actually say again this time.

26:18.914 --> 26:46.008
Okay, everybody, I'm going to start by reading kind of the first paragraph of Jonathan Cooey's thesis, and then I'm going to introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

26:47.108 --> 26:48.269
And then each of us is

26:49.051 --> 26:52.375
incredible preeminent panel that we have.

26:52.476 --> 26:55.600
Each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

26:58.003 --> 27:00.326
Before I move on, I see some of the commenters are ready.

27:00.386 --> 27:06.433
I think it's instructive to watch the participants, given what I have stated.

27:07.301 --> 27:19.346
which is that I pretty much believe that Robert Malone, if you can see my mouse, I don't know if you can see that, Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, and Jessica Rose are on the same team.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.548
I think they've had meetings and discussions in private.

27:24.009 --> 27:33.853
One hypothesis that makes some reasonable sense to me is that they are part of a group of people that has been misleading and manipulating Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.614
for a long, long time about this.

27:36.494 --> 27:53.338
And one of the reasons to say that would be because other people have found that Robert Malone and Meryl Nass were actually in close proximity to one another in the anthrax vaccine debate earlier in recent American history.

27:54.719 --> 27:59.460
It's also very interesting that Jessica Rose cut her teeth in virology and HIV.

28:00.696 --> 28:07.721
Again, you know, modeling, this kind of thing, not dissimilar to what a lot of these other people did before the pandemic.

28:07.761 --> 28:15.085
It's also interesting that some of her postdoc funding before the pandemic came directly from a NATO funding source, which is strange.

28:15.166 --> 28:20.069
I've never met a postdoc in my entire life that got funding

28:20.789 --> 28:21.549
from NATO.

28:22.150 --> 28:43.738
And then so I think that actually, Tess Lorre may be less read in on the American side of things than the rest of these three, who I'm sure are quite read in well, because also Jessica Rose, as long as I've known, has been regularly doing podcasts as a guest host

28:44.338 --> 28:46.359
for CHD just like Meryl Nass does.

28:46.399 --> 28:50.401
Meryl Nass being a longtime scientific advisor of CHD and Bobby.

28:51.702 --> 28:57.525
And Robert Malone, of course, has a book or two that CHD sells and publishes for him.

28:57.965 --> 29:08.030
And so this is a very one-sided group where I don't think Tess Lorre could be as connected to these three as these three are connected to each other.

29:08.991 --> 29:10.892
And so then I'll just leave it from there.

29:11.477 --> 29:18.959
on his thesis, I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

29:18.999 --> 29:24.560
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

29:25.261 --> 29:33.623
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

29:34.303 --> 29:38.444
But if you noticed what clip David White

29:39.264 --> 29:39.884
white side.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.325
I don't know if I could click this.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.346
Particularly at the beginning, the Organization of Independent Science.

29:44.366 --> 29:55.270
See, what he puts in here is not, for example, the picture of DRASTIC, where they had all of the members, and then the picture of my family that was my Twitter handle at the time.

29:55.891 --> 30:00.793
Instead, they chose to take a really crappy sort of website,

30:02.332 --> 30:07.276
you know, website snapshot and then DARPA diffuse documents are available here.

30:09.458 --> 30:16.443
It's laughable now if you see how they cut this and what kinds of things they chose to put in anyway.

30:16.483 --> 30:16.823
Here we go.

30:17.004 --> 30:18.084
This is all over the world.

30:19.589 --> 30:32.480
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

30:33.781 --> 30:43.770
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others

30:45.100 --> 30:53.134
in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

30:53.454 --> 30:58.723
And here's the first paragraph, which is a synopsis of the pandemic.

31:00.399 --> 31:02.480
Now, he's not going to read the most important part.

31:03.121 --> 31:04.662
That's the most unfortunate.

31:04.682 --> 31:09.645
He's going to read the first paragraph, but then he stops just short of starting about anything biological.

31:10.486 --> 31:14.049
And the email that I sent him from which he's reading is actually pretty sharp.

31:15.390 --> 31:16.150
But let's just go.

31:16.511 --> 31:17.571
His latest thoughts about it.

31:18.152 --> 31:27.639
Using a highly coordinated messaging campaign, governments around the world, led by the WHO, changed our minds about all cause mortality.

31:28.837 --> 31:43.125
coronavirus swarm, our immune response to respiratory RNA virus, and the idea of vaccination, the goal seems to be to accomplish a worldwide fundamental inversion for natural human rights

31:44.195 --> 31:53.420
the government granted permissions and ultimately the surrendering of sovereignty over our own bodies in the guise of international public health.

31:53.460 --> 31:55.481
Well, none of that is particularly new.

31:56.782 --> 32:02.665
But I think all of us separately have come to the conclusion that that's what's happened.

32:03.966 --> 32:06.588
And we've all taken our own paths getting there.

32:07.332 --> 32:07.912
What are you doing?

32:07.952 --> 32:15.974
Jonathan, you have some kind of unique take now that I think we all need to talk about and that the public needs to hear.

32:15.994 --> 32:18.034
So why don't you take it away?

32:20.434 --> 32:23.275
It's my honor and privilege to speak to you people today.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.395
Thank you very much to take the time to listen.

32:25.455 --> 32:27.056
Be careful, OK?

32:27.296 --> 32:31.936
I commented to the FDA about the fact that principle of informed consent has been ignored.

32:32.897 --> 32:34.537
And the way they're doing it is that they're

32:35.535 --> 32:42.540
essentially have misinformed us and they've started from the very beginning with misinforming us and that's where we are now.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.243
I'll most of the time have my head out of the way.

32:46.303 --> 32:53.148
The hypothesis that I want to really start with is the idea that the WHO declared a pandemic of a dangerous virus, declared dangerous by them,

32:54.088 --> 33:02.652
And this allowed them to convert a large percentage of all cause mortality into a national security priority of vaccine preventable deaths.

33:03.373 --> 33:06.014
Before the pandemic, this would have been called the flu.

33:06.715 --> 33:12.918
And before the pandemic, not in the sense of this is the flu, but in the sense of the national security priority,

33:13.658 --> 33:18.848
that was a vaccine preventable deaths took the form of the flu and the flu vaccine.

33:19.469 --> 33:25.700
And the important thing to understand is how that was calculated and how they've stopped calculating it in that way.

33:26.776 --> 33:31.098
So if I can just summarize as briefly as possible, I apologize for the animations.

33:31.118 --> 33:32.459
This is for my normal stream.

33:32.979 --> 33:36.501
There's four basic things that we need everybody to understand.

33:36.541 --> 33:40.583
And that's not we in this group, but it's we as we spread the message further.

33:41.483 --> 33:45.725
First one is, is that we need everybody to understand that there is a coronavirus swarm.

33:46.185 --> 33:50.928
So before the pandemic, there used to be hundreds of possible causes for respiratory disease.

33:51.688 --> 33:55.412
And in general, they were lumped into a pneumonia and influenza category.

33:55.892 --> 34:03.319
But from 2020 on, we have reformulated the counting of deaths based on hundreds of EUA products, many of which are no longer on the market.

34:03.920 --> 34:08.184
And all of those were purported to be specific for this novel and deadly virus.

34:08.744 --> 34:10.646
Holy cow.

34:10.706 --> 34:14.970
So in 2022, presenting to this prestigious panel, I already

34:15.811 --> 34:22.834
pretty much could say why the PCR test is a pretty big problem and that it was a background.

34:22.874 --> 34:25.476
Now, I was still calling the background coronavirus.

34:26.756 --> 34:43.204
I still hadn't quite got to the point where I understood what was going on and what clones are and how to use that and understand that as being the limitation of whatever virology is.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.103
But I'm pretty close already.

34:46.123 --> 34:54.989
You know, the other unfortunate thing is that I'm using these graphics that are supposed to represent something that needs much more explanation than this.

34:55.149 --> 35:01.273
And so... You know, it's a function of... How do I say it?

35:03.513 --> 35:09.835
I mean, I'm coming out of 2020 where everything was absolutely as complicated as it could be.

35:09.935 --> 35:16.576
I had to learn all the molecular biology of ACE2 receptors and the Bradykinin signaling cascade.

35:18.677 --> 35:27.319
And I had to learn about spike proteins and fusion proteins and Staphylococcin and Teratoxin B and amyloidosis and prions.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.800
And I had to learn all of this stuff

35:30.640 --> 35:32.643
because that's what everybody was talking about.

35:32.683 --> 35:37.049
That's what everybody was... And the other thing that I had to learn was immunology.

35:37.910 --> 35:43.017
And it's thanks to Mike Eden and maybe even somebody like...

35:44.321 --> 36:01.615
like Ryan Cole that I pursued once and for all just saying, okay, I got to at least know it on a level where I know what these people are talking about and I know what most important is and I know the order of operations and the mechanisms that are thought to be at play and what was said before the pandemic.

36:01.655 --> 36:03.777
And so I dedicated a lot of that time here

36:04.537 --> 36:07.399
also to learning about the immune system.

36:07.459 --> 36:16.466
And if you learn about the immune system from their books, then you learn about it in the context of not only bacterial toxins, but of course, viruses.

36:18.567 --> 36:27.294
And so it was still me trying to climb out of the cave here, being unable to accept that, you know, whole textbooks could be wrong.

36:28.709 --> 36:39.855
But I still didn't understand that evolution because DNA was a cognitive trap that could really, really hamper your ability to see straight.

36:41.256 --> 36:52.783
I was still recovering from being an academic biologist where that was one of the operative presumptions of any question that I would ask or any experiment that I would design.

36:57.119 --> 37:04.688
And this is incidentally really the only hard evidence, quote unquote, that we have of the existence of a novel and deadly virus.

37:05.268 --> 37:08.392
And the cartoon that I'm showing here is trying to portray the idea.

37:08.512 --> 37:10.814
Look at the face of Meryl Nass.

37:11.635 --> 37:16.461
I mean, if anything, it looks like Robert Malone is in a position to type.

37:18.130 --> 37:25.233
And it could be that Meryl Nass or Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose are able to see what he types.

37:26.153 --> 37:27.053
That's my guess.

37:28.234 --> 37:30.535
Meryl Nass may also be typing, that's possible.

37:31.735 --> 37:36.417
That before the pandemic, there were a wide variety of causes for respiratory disease.

37:36.997 --> 37:42.099
Some of them were coronavirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, the flu, et cetera.

37:42.779 --> 37:46.861
And since the start of the pandemic, we've basically summarized that into one cause.

37:48.095 --> 37:53.299
The second thing that they've changed is our idea of how we count all mortality or how we think about it.

37:53.980 --> 38:01.286
They've led us to believe that there's a new cause of death, but the results of having a new cause of death aren't visible in all-cause mortality.

38:01.846 --> 38:16.298
They've convinced the public and governments around the world that a PCR test is evidence of this novel pathogen, and using that PCR test, they have purposefully omitted the all-cause mortality from the discussion in order to convert

38:17.688 --> 38:22.530
regular existing deaths into a new cause of death based on this PCR test.

38:23.531 --> 38:30.675
And so again, I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but I hope I'm summarizing it in a way that will start to bring into the idea.

38:30.875 --> 38:36.417
Incidentally, I am summarizing it and I am saying things that they're not any concerned about anymore.

38:38.819 --> 38:47.303
What I'm saying about the PCR test is nothing that Jessica Rose up until 2022 has given a shit about anymore.

38:48.638 --> 38:52.779
If she cared about it at all in 2020, she doesn't care about it now.

38:52.839 --> 38:57.340
And she's not worried about what damage would have been done with that PCR.

38:57.400 --> 39:03.662
Not worried about the remnants that were generated at all the universities in America and around the world with that PCR.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.863
And neither is Meryl Ness.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.824
She was never worried about the PCR test.

39:09.824 --> 39:16.746
Robert Malone wasn't even out in public yet when the PCR test was creating the illusion of a pandemic.

39:22.099 --> 39:29.123
And so I'm saying something that none of these people have kept in their consciousness for long enough to understand the ramifications of it.

39:29.563 --> 39:36.107
And remember that this is something that I was saying in the backyard that I lost in 2020.

39:38.489 --> 39:50.516
In July of 2020, I was saying the exact same thing that a PCR test not specific for a new virus, but a specific on a background is being used to confound

39:52.039 --> 39:54.460
I'm not saying murder yet here, unfortunately.

39:54.820 --> 40:02.982
And that's another thing missing because of the meddling of people in my life for three years already.

40:03.022 --> 40:04.343
This is October of 2022.

40:04.963 --> 40:08.784
It's three years and like eight months of meddling.

40:11.225 --> 40:12.845
And so I still wasn't there.

40:13.005 --> 40:16.667
I wasn't able to save my friend, Nathan, who probably took the shot in 2022.

40:22.273 --> 40:26.335
that we don't even need a particularly dangerous virus for this to occur.

40:26.876 --> 40:31.418
The next thing they've done is they've confused everyone, including doctors, about our immune system.

40:32.019 --> 40:39.123
They've led us to believe that seroprevalence is really important, and I think they've done this for purposes of national security.

40:40.804 --> 40:46.467
They have also accomplished this by... Meryl is nodding, and I don't think that she is nodding about me.

40:46.487 --> 40:50.269
I think she's nodding about what she's reading on whatever chat they're using.

40:50.660 --> 40:57.684
disingenuously emphasizing antibodies to structural proteins, and these are unproven correlates of immunity.

40:58.244 --> 41:08.449
And finally, just to beat a dead horse, they have simplified the immune response to avoid any loss of countermeasure uptake from informed consent non-participation.

41:08.469 --> 41:14.713
In other words, they don't want you to understand how complicated the immune system is, otherwise you would have a reason not to participate.

41:15.874 --> 41:22.259
And so finally, of course, you are all aware of how many different ways they've changed the way we think about vaccination.

41:23.760 --> 41:28.164
They have done this again in order to make sure that we take the new product up.

41:28.644 --> 41:35.110
I think it's important to point out that this disingenuous emphasizing of antibodies started many years ago.

41:35.170 --> 41:36.411
They've lamented for many.

41:36.651 --> 41:37.832
She's nodding again.

41:37.852 --> 41:40.194
It ain't for this.

41:40.674 --> 41:41.315
Come on.

41:42.409 --> 42:00.033
years that people just don't take the flu vaccine like we'd like them to and have oversimplified it again in order to kind of get us to accept this idea that now that we've vaccinated, excuse me, transfected so many people, it's a safe methodology and it's just simply not true.

42:00.713 --> 42:02.073
And why are they doing this?

42:02.773 --> 42:04.133
He said transfection there.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.054
I didn't do it very well, but I did say it.

42:06.334 --> 42:06.894
I did say it.

42:06.974 --> 42:12.115
Just to make sure I have your full attention here, remember, they didn't tell us anything about purity.

42:12.175 --> 42:17.896
There's data from the EU that says they pretty much put out a wide bouquet of purities.

42:18.596 --> 42:24.637
Again, they're simplifying this to make it, you know, it's just an RNA, it's just a lipid nanoparticle.

42:25.217 --> 42:29.718
And don't forget that they coerced us into believing that by taking this novel.

42:30.918 --> 42:35.179
And so you can see there that actually that slide says,

42:36.608 --> 42:42.910
They have accomplished this by disingenuously describing the simplicity of transfection.

42:43.670 --> 42:53.294
So I'm trying to rush through this because this was a complete slide deck and I thought that I was going to be able to present to Bobby Kennedy, excuse me, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:53.394 --> 42:53.734
alone.

42:54.794 --> 43:00.179
And instead, a few days before, I was told that it would be Robert Malone and somebody else.

43:00.320 --> 43:09.708
And then a day before, I was told that it would be these four, and that I would only have, instead of, you know, an hour or whatever, I had like three minutes.

43:10.669 --> 43:15.634
And so I went into this told that I had like, you know, five minutes at most, and I took 10.

43:17.135 --> 43:19.698
And I'm still flubbing it, really, if you think about it.

43:20.919 --> 43:23.802
methodology we could save our grandparents.

43:23.922 --> 43:27.465
So all this being said, how did they accomplish this?

43:27.485 --> 43:36.773
Well, they accomplished this by getting us to argue about whether this was a lab leak virus or a natural virus for at least two and a half years.

43:37.653 --> 43:41.817
Calling that our common narrative, you see, calling that our common narrative.

43:41.857 --> 43:46.441
We did have a common narrative, but they bifurcated us on the interpretation of it.

43:48.166 --> 43:48.566
That's it.

43:49.307 --> 43:51.288
And then it brings it all together in the end.

43:51.369 --> 43:57.313
After five years, you can know we're in 2025 and most people would accept it if it was a lab leak.

43:57.333 --> 43:57.994
Well, I believe it.

43:58.995 --> 44:00.776
Right and left, center, doesn't matter.

44:01.997 --> 44:03.198
And that was by design.

44:03.919 --> 44:07.641
That's what this multi-year campaign was designed to do.

44:08.678 --> 44:37.903
And part of that requires that none of these people that are in the health freedom movement now ever go back to 2020 and 2021 to consider how many people's DNA and medical data was stolen, how many people were sampled over and over again, how many college kids lost all of their medical data and genetic data to that remnant sales, and how that continues in our corporatized hospitals in America to this day.

44:42.631 --> 44:54.359
how much money was spent during 2020 and 2021 on everything from PCR to track and trace, and then encouraging people using track and trace to take more PCR tests.

44:56.257 --> 45:07.969
And none of these people are worried about that money or that invasion of privacy or that potential violation of sovereignty by selling their genetic information to the highest bidder.

45:08.430 --> 45:17.860
None of them care, even though that's something that the Human Genome Project and people like Mark Lander and Kevin McKernan would have said would be ideal already 15 years ago.

45:22.065 --> 45:26.653
What, we could get everybody in America to swab themselves every couple weeks and send it into the government?

45:26.693 --> 45:28.155
Boy, that would be phenomenal.

45:32.301 --> 45:39.545
And that argument precludes the possibility that gain of function research may not be that dangerous.

45:39.585 --> 45:48.690
And in fact, the only thing that we know for sure is that they've been working on immunogenic proteins and that it's very difficult for them to handle coronavirus in a laboratory.

45:49.450 --> 45:59.115
And so as you're well aware, we don't know whether this came from nature or a marketplace or a laboratory, but I can tell you two years into this commission report,

46:00.011 --> 46:02.033
The US government knows more than it's telling us.

46:02.253 --> 46:03.434
And so, you know, he's he.

46:05.796 --> 46:06.736
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:08.518 --> 46:13.762
Our host, Robert Kennedy, has interviewed Jeffrey Sachs and has talked about this with him.

46:14.263 --> 46:16.024
He is perpetuating the same narrative.

46:16.084 --> 46:20.107
If we look at pneumonia and influenza, this is year on year 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

46:23.610 --> 46:30.418
And we look at the red line being pneumonia and the shaded areas here are influenza deaths.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.140
And of course, this is a CDC graph.

46:32.200 --> 46:33.562
It's designed to confuse you.

46:34.043 --> 46:39.829
You have to use the axes on the right for the shaded area and the axes on the left for the red line.

46:40.510 --> 46:57.538
If we convert this to what they're telling us now, which is pneumonia, influenza, and coronavirus, P-I-C instead of P-N-I, now we see this great drop-off in flu and we see this great increase in coronavirus deaths.

46:57.598 --> 47:04.041
If we look year on year on year, the actual fraction of pneumonia deaths which are tied to flu is quite small.

47:05.441 --> 47:16.173
And so what we are looking at here, in my humble opinion, is an attempt to convert more of the unknown pneumonia and respiratory illness to a vaccinatable target.

47:17.185 --> 47:29.072
If they show this graph on the PBS NewsHour with all the deaths every week, contrasted to the COVID and to the pneumonia deaths, no one would be that worried about this and the emergency would be obvious.

47:29.112 --> 47:35.356
So the way they did that, and I'm almost done, the way they did that is they tricked us about how this swarm is composed.

47:35.996 --> 47:45.682
We know that before the pandemic, there were many hundreds of causes for respiratory disease, and now we're using a PCR test to blame it on a few.

47:46.682 --> 47:50.330
I think this is really the best way I guess I can summarize.

47:50.350 --> 47:51.392
This should be the end here.

47:51.432 --> 47:58.045
Yeah, so here, what I've been talking about for the last two years on my podcast is how Fauci had these emails.

47:58.874 --> 48:14.518
and the fusion inhibitor can block the fusion of many different coronaviruses, and that endosomal entry is a good target for some of these therapeutics, and that they hid the data about all of these molecular signatures.

48:14.558 --> 48:19.360
But then after two years, I start to feel like maybe they didn't hide any of this.

48:20.140 --> 48:27.502
Maybe they just very controlled released this information to keep us fighting about this lab leak or natural virus, when in reality,

48:28.484 --> 48:31.926
It's probably closer to part of an existing swarm.

48:32.887 --> 48:37.270
The PCR was originally aimed at the spike protein, but it is no longer aimed there.

48:37.290 --> 48:45.055
T cell memory from childhood is protective, specifically because we don't focus coronavirus memory on structural proteins.

48:45.875 --> 48:54.401
And these molecular clues are probably clues to how they've tried to modify proteins to become immunogens, so that they can remove the need for an adjuvant.

48:54.961 --> 49:07.952
And at best, I think this is where gain of function has reached in terms of its limits of its technology and coronavirus, simply because coronavirus is so intractable in the laboratory.

49:07.992 --> 49:08.912
So that's my theory.

49:08.932 --> 49:16.819
I think the gain of function of coronavirus is an exaggeration based on a false fidelity that they claim to have.

49:17.899 --> 49:33.962
NIAID-funded designer protein may or may not be involved in the initial biological incident, which would explain why it doesn't really move like a variant of a virus, because in fact, it's probably a protein that contaminated the viral swarm that already exists.

49:34.002 --> 49:36.863
And then we can, obviously I had a lot more slides, so I can.

49:38.203 --> 49:47.065
What I'm thinking there is that if they transfected people to a spike protein that it could incorporate into the background, it might look like

49:48.484 --> 49:57.148
So imagine a scenario where the background is N-protein and E-protein and RNA-dependent polymerase and fusion proteins called spikes.

49:57.748 --> 50:01.350
And then you just said, okay, I'm going to find a new spike.

50:01.410 --> 50:03.311
And then that means we found a new virus.

50:03.351 --> 50:10.214
So then you just make a new spike, or you make the DNA for it, or you make the RNA for it, and you put it out there and say you found it.

50:10.794 --> 50:16.136
because the background already has the N protein and the E protein and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

50:16.657 --> 50:38.366
So when you do metagenomic sequence on an environmental sample, the background has the N, the E, the S, and if you just find the special S, then you can use metagenomic sequencing to assemble a new coronavirus that has a great deal of homology on the N protein, the E protein and other proteins, but is really different with the S protein.

50:39.383 --> 50:45.225
And so again, because of my limited time here, I didn't have the wherewithal to explain it.

50:45.365 --> 51:05.551
I had just sort of started to try and formulate that idea that if you added something to the background, like a spike protein that you said you found, by just producing the DNA and then claiming to find it, you could essentially claim to find anything you want, including an NIH-designed immunogen.

51:06.889 --> 51:20.018
that would then guarantee your transfection countermeasure would be very successful at generating antibodies because you already know your designer immunogen will generate seroprevalence.

51:22.520 --> 51:33.027
I think it's actually a spectacular possibility that is so much better than saying no virus or saying all this other stuff that of course makes no sense.

51:34.164 --> 51:40.346
and also still allows me to be right about the fact that RNA cannot pandemic.

51:40.366 --> 51:42.327
There's RNA back there, there's a background.

51:42.827 --> 51:47.949
And if you said you found something on that background, then you could add that something to the background.

51:50.570 --> 51:53.271
Oh, I found a special new car in your garage.

51:53.651 --> 52:00.414
And the special new car is definitely there because this titanium flashlight is part of that special new car.

52:00.634 --> 52:02.995
The rest of it is pretty much the same as all other cars.

52:03.894 --> 52:12.802
So in the wreckage of your garage, I find wheels and I find a V6 engine and I found this titanium flashlight.

52:12.842 --> 52:18.686
So I guess that means that in your garage was that very special car because that's what this indicates.

52:21.489 --> 52:32.018
Trying to make some analogies off the cuff here, but I mean, I think this was actually a spectacular attempt at a seven minute presentation trying to get somebody here to be

52:33.274 --> 52:36.277
know, held to account or to have to say I'm wrong.

52:36.317 --> 52:38.079
And they never he never said I was wrong.

52:38.119 --> 52:42.303
He talked about about warm base manufacturing of the flu vaccine and stuff.

52:44.445 --> 52:45.626
I can answer any questions.

52:47.648 --> 52:49.310
That would be my my thesis.

52:50.792 --> 52:58.778
Now the reason why... One of the things that interests me about what you say is that we at the CHDA, we've tracked the flu data.

52:58.798 --> 53:13.889
They've tracked the flu data and we talked about that and that's interesting because they have suggested that the flu is manufactured and it has to be because the flu numbers have to get to a certain level before the flu vaccine is funded by the CDC as an epidemic.

53:14.861 --> 53:39.485
And so that's been going on for a very long time, but that's not the same thing as creating from whole cloth a mythology about a novel virus and a whole necessity for a new battery of diagnostics that could have several generations of improvement and a new battery of vaccines on the schedule that could have several generations of improvement because of this novel virus.

53:39.965 --> 53:41.025
That is absurd.

53:41.045 --> 53:41.726
Stop lying.

53:42.426 --> 53:43.706
Stop lying.

53:47.128 --> 53:50.251
And so I really challenge you, we need to wake up.

53:50.311 --> 53:53.313
That was two and a half years into the pandemic.

53:54.975 --> 53:59.919
That was already a half a year into my employment for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:00.860 --> 54:05.103
And they tried very desperately to keep me in and on focus.

54:07.125 --> 54:09.227
It's really remarkable actually.

54:10.188 --> 54:12.249
And I think that right now is,

54:13.368 --> 54:19.331
is an absolutely crucial time in our recent history to realize how bad it is.

54:19.392 --> 54:23.114
So in 2022, I said that there was a background.

54:23.194 --> 54:26.756
I still called it coronavirus, but I'm not calling that anymore.

54:26.816 --> 54:37.202
If I was gonna go back and do it again, I would just say that there's a inordinate amount of a yet to be characterized RNA and DNA noise in the background that spans from our

54:37.802 --> 54:54.621
DNA and RNA to the RNA and DNA of the bacteria and the fungi around us and all the phages and all this other stuff unidentified that firms like Metobiota said that they could use whole samples and algorithms to sort out.

54:55.580 --> 55:13.610
And that background was never usefully differentiated from the new signal with single or double or even triple amplicon PCR tests without any sequencing and without requiring all of those amplicons to be present and yada, I mean, the list is endless.

55:15.210 --> 55:21.214
PCR can't be a diagnostic, not on the background of the endless noise that there is.

55:22.153 --> 55:29.115
And yes, I was not good enough in 2022, but I am now to say it correctly, or at least much more accurately.

55:29.155 --> 55:35.537
But I did say that the PCR, the emergency use authorized diagnostics, defined the pandemic.

55:35.557 --> 55:36.998
And that's true around the world.

55:37.458 --> 55:42.720
That's true around the world about how much money was spent, about the original mandates.

55:44.540 --> 55:52.986
and about the creation of a remnant stream that's still going today that provides DNA samples to anybody that's still doing it and buying them.

55:53.847 --> 56:02.533
Omitting all-cause mortality and the use of the population pyramid to know that there was a predicted rise in all-cause mortality that they were managing with murder.

56:02.953 --> 56:08.057
I did not know that yet, but I did know that they were changing the way we thought about all-cause mortality.

56:10.259 --> 56:38.316
I did say something about immunity and being misled about whether we generalize or not, but I still wasn't able to succinctly say that even if you accept that there is an immune system, the immune system, besides differentiating self from non-self in certain key situations, it is probably building memories to pathogen-associated, not pathogen-associated molecular patterns, but damage-associated molecular patterns.

56:38.356 --> 56:39.397
This is where I should be pointing.

56:40.973 --> 57:03.182
And so this is just one example of how rather than trying to teach us the subtleties and the nuances of what we think the immune system might be for our pattern integrity, they taught us an ultra simple version of immunity that involved novel coronaviruses versus old ones that don't matter and antibodies that block them.

57:04.858 --> 57:08.020
Scooby-Doo and I admitted that I had been taken by that.

57:09.140 --> 57:14.223
I thought at this time, you can hear it, that the old vaccines are okay but not these vaccines.

57:14.283 --> 57:17.745
These vaccines they're lying about and I didn't even really say it very well.

57:18.085 --> 57:23.087
I did call out Jeffrey Sachs as being an example of the Scooby-Doo and how it's working and I did

57:24.908 --> 57:28.129
admit at the end there that I was probably convinced by the Scooby-Doo.

57:28.169 --> 57:36.092
That's why I was talking about fusion protein inhibitors and stuff like that in 2020 instead of telling people not to transfect themselves.

57:37.112 --> 57:47.616
And so viruses don't grow in the lab is something that I knew already there, but I hadn't yet fully understood that it's just synthetic DNA and RNA transfected into cell culture, and that's what they call virology.

57:50.277 --> 58:06.157
Uh, no mention of diffuse and I did that on purpose because at that time already, uh, I think Rixey had already been fired and I had already, you know, really stated to everybody a number of times that I'm pretty sure the diffuse proposal is nonsense and to take it at face value means that any leaked

58:06.738 --> 58:13.265
Grant proposal could, in theory, be the next, you know, gain-of-function mythology that we're enslaved by.

58:13.285 --> 58:21.453
And if they leak something that says they're going to put little things in the school food so that they can control our kids' minds, then we'll believe that it's there.

58:22.394 --> 58:23.655
Because, you know, it's the leak.

58:23.695 --> 58:24.436
They leaked it.

58:24.876 --> 58:28.440
It's a document that somebody leaked to Veritas, so it's got to be right.

58:31.246 --> 58:35.547
And so still missing the supplemental oxygen that leads to ARDS.

58:36.147 --> 58:39.308
I'm still missing the ventilators to stop spread.

58:39.348 --> 58:41.648
I'm still missing the murder by opioids.

58:41.708 --> 58:43.368
I'm still missing the murder part.

58:44.729 --> 58:52.050
I'm just talking about the biology and how they misled us about RNA being able to pandemic and still not able to say it like that.

58:52.090 --> 58:57.431
So I still wasn't there in 2022, but almost, almost.

58:59.212 --> 59:00.772
But I thought all these guys were good guys.

59:05.529 --> 59:13.131
I was kind of convinced Robert Malone wasn't, but I think one of the reasons why we had this meeting was to try and convince me that he was a good guy.

59:17.813 --> 59:18.613
I don't know what to say.

59:18.673 --> 59:21.494
If I had to do it all over again, I would start with this graph.

59:21.554 --> 59:26.876
And I would say that all Western nations had a problem to manage that they've seen for at least 20 years coming.

59:27.836 --> 59:31.117
And in order to manage that problem, they needed an excuse.

59:31.197 --> 59:33.598
And the public health behemoth

59:34.578 --> 59:41.040
that crosses all Western nations' borders, understood that this problem was coming too.

59:41.881 --> 01:00:03.928
And the governments of these nations, in cooperation with this global public health initiative, weaponized piles of money, coordinatedly managed this problem, this problem that anybody worth their salt now knows was always there, and they managed it with murder, and they called it the pandemic.

01:00:04.656 --> 01:00:14.643
And in America in particular, they did it with supplementary oxygen, ventilation, and the lack of antibiotic use when it should have been necessary.

01:00:15.243 --> 01:00:16.945
And so that's really what's happening here.

01:00:17.025 --> 01:00:21.448
Mystery virus equals excess deaths was a way of managing the population pyramid problem.

01:00:21.908 --> 01:00:24.710
They did it with a whole list of different things.

01:00:25.811 --> 01:00:34.137
Fear, uncertainty and doubt, do not resuscitate orders, supplementary oxygen, ventilators, lack of antibiotic use, poor use of steroids, remdesivir, midazolam.

01:00:34.577 --> 01:00:41.642
The opioid deaths were probably treated really well in 2019 to make sure that they didn't get out of control.

01:00:42.002 --> 01:00:47.246
And then they probably reduced the distribution of Narcan during the pandemic.

01:00:47.286 --> 01:00:47.647
I don't know.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:48.427
Nobody cares.

01:00:48.507 --> 01:00:49.688
Nobody would ever look into that.

01:00:50.048 --> 01:00:51.769
There was also death certificate fraud.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:54.592
There were financial incentives across the hospital system.

01:00:55.032 --> 01:00:56.153
There were track and trace.

01:00:56.773 --> 01:01:00.315
that led more people to get tested and to believe that the tests were real.

01:01:00.655 --> 01:01:12.102
There were masks that were creating the pulse ox problems that led people to take the supplementary oxygen in the first place and for doctors not to know it, even though they should have known because it's been known since the 80s.

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:20.547
Closures, mandates, and then of course PCR fraud, lateral flow test fraud, the sequencing fraud, and of course the sale of those remnants.

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:25.010
That's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:35.600
And unfortunately, that's why we don't have any lawyers on our team that are willing to talk about strict liability as a way to fix the vaccine schedule.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:53.755
And more importantly, because sometimes they do say that, we have no lawyers that are saying that these laws can be struck as unconstitutional because they allow the government to suspend fundamental rights while not being held to strict scrutiny.

01:01:54.713 --> 01:02:01.044
And any lawyer that's worth their salt will understand exactly what I said and either go, holy shit, he's right.

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:08.135
Or some other ridiculous reaction that would belie either stupidity or participation in this.

01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:31.509
We need a new consensus about the fact that the vaccine schedule in the USA is a criminal enterprise, and ICANN and CHD could have had this on a flag already in 2016 when they had the movie Vaxxed, or in 2017 or 18 when they had Vaxxed 2, and yet now here we are in 2025 and we still don't have an organization in America

01:02:31.969 --> 01:02:43.336
Besides the one that's headquartered in my garage that's saying that the vaccine schedule in the USA in particular is a criminal enterprise and you can compare it to any other Western nation and get a good clue why.

01:02:44.777 --> 01:02:52.382
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal because that was an old technology already well understood on the academic bench.

01:02:53.182 --> 01:02:56.884
Any academic biologists worth their salt should have figured this out by now.

01:02:57.745 --> 01:02:59.306
And RNA cannot pandemic.

01:03:04.554 --> 01:03:12.357
And so what I've tried to make my main message is, is that the people on social media have not helped us.

01:03:12.437 --> 01:03:29.422
They have trapped us inside of an illusion of consensus, which defined a limited spectrum of debate, which never would have gotten us anywhere near anything on this slide, and certainly didn't get us anywhere near the idea or calling the vaccine schedule criminal.

01:03:31.442 --> 01:03:34.324
They can kind of say, I don't know if I'd ever take one again.

01:03:34.704 --> 01:03:45.691
If you wouldn't take one, but millions of children in the future will take one, then don't you think it would be important to say it a little more strongly than I don't know if I'd take one anymore.

01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:56.779
And this whole no virus thing, this whole, oh, it's just was all awful because it misled everybody.

01:03:59.178 --> 01:04:13.291
That's why I have this slide from before where, you know, you feel like you're on social media and it feels really cool and like you're fighting the empire and one, you're like one live stream or one tweet away, one podcast away from breaking this illusion.

01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:15.593
And that's just absolutely not true.

01:04:15.633 --> 01:04:20.738
If all of these people are more or less working together against you, and they are,

01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:30.058
And the reason why these people in particular are chosen for my slide is because most of these people have had very personal interaction with me.

01:04:31.818 --> 01:04:41.740
Some of them have eaten at my table, given my wife a hug, touched my children, pet my dog.

01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:50.382
Other people I've met with my dog and they've ignored my dog, which is just as revealing as, I mean,

01:04:53.666 --> 01:04:55.348
And so we are in 2025.

01:04:56.510 --> 01:05:02.918
The illusion of a pandemic is ongoing because nobody on either side has usefully objected to it.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:11.770
And I am the only person that anybody that I know that can summarize the pandemic in a single slide where a background signal

01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:24.987
was misconstrued as evidence of spread using nonspecific PCR tests and a countermeasure that was known to be damaging, known to be deadly, known to have almost

01:05:26.934 --> 01:05:47.764
almost an inestimable amount of potential for damage was rolled out on the background of a huge number of placebos so that the signal that would have otherwise been expected by mass transfection rollout would never be detected and whatever signal was detected could be denied.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:52.126
And they would meet all the manufacturing standards, of course, whatever was needed.

01:05:54.403 --> 01:06:07.711
That's why none of these people that met me at some point in the last five years are able to just say, well, Jay's mean, but he sure says it right when he says RNA cannot pandemic or intramuscular injection is dumb or transfecting healthy people is a crime.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.092
But that's my message today.

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:12.914
That's my message today, because what?

01:06:14.094 --> 01:06:15.315
It's a long, strange trip.

01:06:17.535 --> 01:06:21.617
And that guy's nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:06:21.637 --> 01:06:23.038
I worked for him for over a year.

01:06:23.498 --> 01:06:27.400
That guy is nominated for head of NIH, and he knows me very well.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:34.364
We've met several times over the last three years, and he's told me often that he's learned a lot of biology from me during the pandemic.

01:06:39.226 --> 01:06:45.829
Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone, I met at the inaugural CHD conference in Knoxville in 2022.

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:49.699
It's also where this picture is taken.

01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:52.400
It's also where this picture was taken.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.780
He did not want to be in that photograph with me.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:59.042
That's also where this photograph is taken, but he did want to be in a photograph with me.

01:06:59.062 --> 01:07:02.083
He gave me a note that said that we needed more people like me.

01:07:03.931 --> 01:07:04.872
doing what I'm doing.

01:07:05.953 --> 01:07:07.975
This photograph was taken at the same place.

01:07:08.035 --> 01:07:16.222
This photograph, because you can see I'm wearing the same shirt, this photograph was taken in Georgia at the CHD conference.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:19.105
I actually have that very banner right there on my door over there.

01:07:20.888 --> 01:07:30.914
This picture over here of Brett Weinstein is from his third podcast during the pandemic where he's wearing a bandana and woodshop gobbles to protect him from the aerosolized virus.

01:07:31.454 --> 01:07:35.197
And the title of it is Bats, Bioweapons, and Societal Response.

01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:48.977
That's Jay Bhattacharya up there with Zuby, who I'm pretty sure is just the worst kind of fake dissident.

01:07:48.997 --> 01:07:55.622
He did a nice stream with Debunk the Funk, and he also was on Jay Bhattacharya's podcast.

01:07:59.324 --> 01:08:03.988
Jay Bhattacharya started some kind of substack called Illusion of Consensus.

01:08:05.327 --> 01:08:10.029
in May of 2023, stealing the term from me right out of my slide deck.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:21.575
And he started it with a Canadian kid that was first introduced to us by Brett Weinstein, a guy who was in a signal chat with me from late 2020 until middle or late 2021, where basically all of

01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:32.362
The idea is that transfection would cause the expression of a protein and therefore the destruction of that cell.

01:08:32.402 --> 01:08:40.147
But worse yet, it would challenge the immune system to present the debris and not create autoimmunity.

01:08:40.267 --> 01:08:46.492
Every time that happens, the body is challenged not to accidentally create autoimmunity.

01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:58.743
And that portion of this discussion is still not really being adequately explained because that is the reason why it's a near combinatorial ridiculous number of things that are possible.

01:08:58.783 --> 01:09:16.534
Because if it goes to this cell type and that cell type and that cell type, and then your immune system makes autoimmunity to that component or that protein or that protein, the manifestation of your vaccine damage could be incredibly different in every person that's exposed to a transfection.

01:09:17.597 --> 01:09:34.440
And it could, because we are pattern integrities on a trajectory through time, it could manifest itself on different time scales with different time horizons for maladaptive metabolism and then death.

01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:44.082
And that's why it's so significant that none of these people, despite my contact with them and begging them to call it a transfection,

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:58.375
Because then the biology of transfection can be explained that, you know, you're just driving your cells to do something that will get your immune system to necessarily have to process them without making a mistake, or you're done.

01:10:00.016 --> 01:10:11.125
And I was saying that very, very well, at the beginning of 2021, at the end of 2020, when I had basically gotten to the stage where I think I got this immunology, and I think they're in trouble.

01:10:12.734 --> 01:10:16.557
I think transfecting people to a particular protein might be a bad idea.

01:10:22.322 --> 01:10:24.803
Behind me over here is my friend Nathan.

01:10:26.705 --> 01:10:30.148
The guy who died last year in December from an aneurysm.

01:10:31.028 --> 01:10:34.131
His whole family took the shot because he didn't believe.

01:10:35.337 --> 01:10:36.158
Thought I was crazy.

01:10:36.178 --> 01:10:40.362
I've always been a conspiracy theorist to my friends and even in 9-11.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:59.140
They thought I was nuts and so They didn't take me very seriously at the beginning of the pandemic because I was going all lab leak on them And at the beginning in the beginning of the pandemic I was saying it's not such a bad idea maybe not to get this yet Maybe the nasty one will get less nasty and maybe you should get it in the spring.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:10:59.180
I

01:11:00.578 --> 01:11:05.103
That is actually the kinds of things that I was saying in 2020 to my friends and family.

01:11:05.964 --> 01:11:07.046
How confused I was.

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:22.021
And so these pictures, a lot of them, like, for example, that one of me and Jane Goodall, she just happened to be on a plane when I was coming back from one of the Broken Science Initiative meetings where I met Jay Bhattacharya.

01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:24.163
And I just had to take a picture with her.

01:11:24.223 --> 01:11:27.266
And, you know, I told her that I liked her books and I thought she was a hero.

01:11:27.306 --> 01:11:28.827
I needed to take a photograph with her.

01:11:29.307 --> 01:11:30.308
And that's the photograph.

01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:35.892
Jimmy Dore was in Pittsburgh last year.

01:11:35.952 --> 01:11:38.953
I just went to his show and gave him a book and that's pictures from that.

01:11:39.453 --> 01:11:47.396
Vera Sharov was asking me to write a biology chapter for her book, Never Again is Now.

01:11:50.516 --> 01:11:52.097
I don't think she's ever even donated $10.

01:11:52.257 --> 01:11:57.421
And I just didn't see it happening.

01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:09.630
And then she fired my friend, Uwe, because he did a substack about me when I was critiquing Naomi Wolf.

01:12:11.271 --> 01:12:13.852
I mean, that's why these pictures are here.

01:12:13.993 --> 01:12:18.316
These pictures aren't here to brag that these people know who I am.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.743
And they pretend not to.

01:12:21.163 --> 01:12:32.028
When Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone saw me in November last year at the Brownstone event, they didn't even look me in the eye, even though I was the tallest guy there by a foot and a half.

01:12:33.529 --> 01:12:39.852
Certainly the funniest looking one, because I was dressed in all black with a basketball uniform on, and I'm 6'6".

01:12:43.368 --> 01:12:49.171
And yet somehow or another they walked right past me several times and didn't even make eye contact, just looked past me.

01:12:51.093 --> 01:12:54.815
Not to be a shit or anything like that, but that never happens to me.

01:12:56.016 --> 01:13:03.420
I could go to a heavy metal concert and 90% of the people that would walk past me that were facing me would make eye contact with me.

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.132
It's just, there's a, that's who you see.

01:13:07.932 --> 01:13:09.373
It's like a tall Indian guy.

01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:10.814
It's a holy cow.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:13.736
Is that the dude from one who flew over the cuckoo's nest?

01:13:13.776 --> 01:13:14.657
Like what is that guy?

01:13:17.611 --> 01:13:22.976
And so I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you, it is visible right now.

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:42.334
We have one chance to show our kids that this illusion of consensus is created by coordinated lying and how it was done during the pandemic, who did it, and why that means that this biology that this guy from Pittsburgh is pushing is worth considering.

01:13:44.093 --> 01:13:49.456
His short, succinct, challenging statements are definitely worth considering.

01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:59.522
No matter how abrasive he is, no matter how personal he talks about these people, I think we better consider the possibility because Noam Chomsky told us this is how it happens.

01:14:00.342 --> 01:14:06.106
It goes right back to the origins of modern democracy in the English revolutions of the 17th century.

01:14:07.307 --> 01:14:08.928
English Revolution of the 17th century.

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:32.784
At that time, great concern was expressed over popular agitators, itinerant preachers and workers with their little printing presses and their pamphlets and their public speeches, which were removing the cloak of mystery behind which the Parliament and the King were carrying out their much narrower struggle than when you read about in history books.

01:14:33.945 --> 01:14:55.156
Now, these people were, in their words, they were people who wanted to be represented not by lords and gentry, but by men of their own kind, men who know the people's swords, quoting from Leveller pamphlets, and observing their activities.

01:14:56.086 --> 01:15:10.177
One contemporary historian warned that by revealing the workings of power, they will make the people so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a civil rule, which is a big problem.

01:15:10.837 --> 01:15:24.948
Well, well after these radical Democrats had been crushed by about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:29.230
the greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

01:15:33.592 --> 01:15:49.683
And so I'm suggesting to you that the military-industrial complex that governs us already understood this a long, long time ago and social media has made it possible for private interests to compete in this governance, to collaborate in this governance.

01:15:50.953 --> 01:16:08.338
to become pawns in this government or even in this governance structure or even powers in this governance structure outside of the governance structure that the military industrial complex has already created.

01:16:08.418 --> 01:16:19.902
In other words, imagine that MI6 and the US government and the Australian government and the Israeli government all been playing these games together and separately for a very long time.

01:16:20.402 --> 01:16:35.254
And now you have these private social media platforms, or these pseudo-private military social media platforms, being able to control the opinion of X number of people in all these different countries under all these different languages.

01:16:36.363 --> 01:16:39.846
Then the playing board has shifted a little bit.

01:16:39.886 --> 01:16:41.887
The power structure has shifted a little bit.

01:16:41.927 --> 01:16:52.495
If Steve Bannon, for example, is coordinating a loosely organized group of liars that is slowly infiltrating the

01:16:54.296 --> 01:17:08.925
astroturf version of Christian nationalism in America and creating a astroturf version of Christian nationalism in order to wrangle cats and control a lot of people in America because social media enables that.

01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:18.110
We need to understand the warning that's here in the context of where we are now, not when it was given, but where we are now.

01:17:19.246 --> 01:17:33.055
where our children are at the behest of social media, where adults are at the control of social media, where they still think that they're seeing some reasonable version of reality by scrolling through social media.

01:17:33.455 --> 01:17:38.318
And that is how these people have

01:17:39.707 --> 01:17:47.631
created a situation where we inherited a version of charlatanism from our parents that they inherited from their parents.

01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:57.476
It's a multi-generational myth that goes all the way back to people like Joshua Lederberg.

01:17:57.536 --> 01:18:00.758
I found this book of Joshua Lederberg.

01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:03.279
There's two things I want to put under the camera here before I go.

01:18:06.018 --> 01:18:11.564
The first one is, there's this book called, can I do this?

01:18:11.644 --> 01:18:14.968
I think I can do this, no, this, and then this.

01:18:18.372 --> 01:18:19.573
First of all, I wanted to show you this.

01:18:19.633 --> 01:18:20.254
This is cute.

01:18:21.134 --> 01:18:26.680
Somebody picked this up in December of 2024 at the Florida Children's Health Defense thing.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.883
And they used this photograph that you've seen me in.

01:18:30.824 --> 01:18:32.566
I'm up there, right there in the photograph.

01:18:32.606 --> 01:18:35.509
But interestingly, they've taken the photograph and they've cut out

01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:40.150
Brian Hooker, and they cut out who's standing right here.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:46.572
Laura Bono, the actual founder of CHD, who's no longer a part of the organization.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:19:04.357
It's a very interesting photograph to have because this person right here is also the person who organized the conference and actually all the people that spoke at our conference at the CHD conference actually raised money for themselves, not CHD, but promoted their own thing.

01:19:04.817 --> 01:19:16.780
And almost all of those people actually sit on this person's personally organized non-profit that's also kind of anti-vaccine and alternative medicine.

01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:21.382
I shit you not, that person was hired by Mary.

01:19:22.402 --> 01:19:26.703
She organized a conference in Georgia where this thing was photographed.

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:33.825
And all the people that spoke at that conference are people that sit on the executive committee of her own non-profit.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:36.566
Like Sabine Hazan.

01:19:38.767 --> 01:19:40.828
And this is the photograph they chose to use.

01:19:40.928 --> 01:19:41.168
Why?

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:48.451
Because this is the last photograph that they have with these two people together, because when he was running for president, he couldn't be a part of that organization anymore.

01:19:49.532 --> 01:19:54.774
And so it was kind of a sketch house photo to get in the first place, because he's not really supposed to be with them anymore.

01:19:56.263 --> 01:20:02.967
And it's very, very curious that they used it with that guy still in the photograph already a year after they fired him.

01:20:05.369 --> 01:20:07.870
So I wanted to just, I wanted to see if I can find this.

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:14.234
This is a book entitled Germs, Genes, and Medicine, The Life of Joshua Lederberger by Jan Saab.

01:20:14.654 --> 01:20:23.059
And it's a very, very expensive book, but I found a book, a copy of it on eBay that was cheap because the cover's on upside down, which is pretty funny.

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:24.100
So I have to turn it over here.

01:20:25.352 --> 01:20:29.696
And I'm only on chapter 6, but I want to find this one part that I thought was really cool.

01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:32.278
Because I just think it's funny.

01:20:33.019 --> 01:20:36.122
I'm not saying anything about what it means.

01:20:37.003 --> 01:20:38.284
It's very early in the book.

01:20:38.504 --> 01:20:39.745
I think I can still find it.

01:20:42.748 --> 01:20:42.908
Yes.

01:20:44.878 --> 01:20:49.342
So this is talking about Joshua's parents return to Israel in the early 1960s.

01:20:49.382 --> 01:20:56.989
The walls of their Tel Aviv apartment were festooned with copies of the degrees, diplomas, certificates, and awards received by their American sons.

01:20:57.149 --> 01:21:04.156
And in 1967, this mother recalled with enthusiastic pride a moment from seven years earlier, she was chairing a

01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:09.859
meeting for a Zionist women's organization in New York when Senator Jack Kennedy gave a lecture.

01:21:10.319 --> 01:21:14.421
Kennedy knew about Josh, who had recently been awarded the Nobel Prize at the young age of 33.

01:21:16.102 --> 01:21:23.545
When he saw me wearing a pin with the name Lederberg, he came straight over, shook my hand, and asked, are you perhaps a relative of Professor Lederberg?

01:21:24.105 --> 01:21:25.426
I replied, that's my son.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:31.149
And if he wasn't too young to receive the Nobel Prize, you are not too young to be president.

01:21:31.889 --> 01:21:43.278
Kennedy laughed and I added and I guess this is the mom adding if you were elected president Please send me an invitation to the inauguration and what do you think that he didn't send he sent?

01:21:43.939 --> 01:21:57.269
And at the time there was a heavy snowfall and I couldn't get to Washington, but Joshua participated in the ceremony But Joshua participated in the ceremony now, I think that's pretty funny

01:21:59.062 --> 01:22:00.482
I think this is really curious.

01:22:01.223 --> 01:22:02.103
It's a really cool book.

01:22:02.683 --> 01:22:05.124
I'll report more as I read it.

01:22:05.484 --> 01:22:11.805
It's actually a really easy read and I've got a good bookmark now.

01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:18.227
So let me get back to this and finish this presentation because I do think it's actually really important to dunk on these people right now.

01:22:19.362 --> 01:22:25.066
The Health Freedom Movement, the Maha Movement is going to be a ha-ha joke on our grandkids if we don't wake up right now.

01:22:25.647 --> 01:22:35.133
And we can see it very easily because the people who were in place at the beginning of the pandemic had a very strict narrative that they stuck to.

01:22:35.173 --> 01:22:42.658
And one of the guys that had a very strict narrative that was very early in place was Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project.

01:22:43.462 --> 01:22:56.471
The project that very lately I've been trying to say is largely an illusion that required our sovereignty to be inverted into experimental animals so that they could sample us and start the project in earnest.

01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:02.455
The Human Genome Project was essentially the restriction mapping of one or two people.

01:23:04.536 --> 01:23:10.280
And the sort of test, proof of principle of that, that it could even be done.

01:23:11.929 --> 01:23:22.617
And then the next 20 years were spent developing the technology that would allow it to be done cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, supposedly at higher and higher resolution.

01:23:22.677 --> 01:23:26.860
And that's where I start to think that some of this stuff is all exaggeration.

01:23:29.482 --> 01:23:31.203
And we're in big trouble.

01:23:32.384 --> 01:23:35.426
And that guy is the one who said that PCR works, just not theirs.

01:23:35.466 --> 01:23:38.748
Just not the who's PCR, but my PCR works.

01:23:38.808 --> 01:23:39.729
I'm testing the weed.

01:23:41.035 --> 01:23:52.346
And now the reason why it's so important to see this is because this guy had podcast appointments in 2020 repeatedly and often to say that the PCR test works.

01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:55.669
That maybe not, it's not as quite as novel as they say it is.

01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:57.230
Maybe it was around in October.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:02.635
That guy with a very specific script in 2020 is now in front of us

01:24:07.114 --> 01:24:19.076
saying verifiably incorrect information about the future, very soon to be Health and Human Services Secretary's book about Wuhan.

01:24:20.692 --> 01:24:34.379
saying very incorrect things about the contents and the writing of this book, written by the very soon to be Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States.

01:24:34.399 --> 01:24:46.645
Why would a, the Research and Development Coordinator Director of the Human Genome Project, Apprentice of Mark Lander, bother going on podcasts like, like,

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:50.901
Bret Weinstein or Danny Jones to say these things?

01:24:54.083 --> 01:25:06.830
And that question becomes even more significant when you put it in the timeline and realize that when he came on my podcast in December of 2021, a full year and a half after writing the Cormen Jorsten report,

01:25:08.444 --> 01:25:11.845
He said that the RNA wasn't pure in the shot, so that might be a problem.

01:25:12.206 --> 01:25:19.548
He said that they have live dead technology that could solve the overcycling and whether or not you're contagious with a virus problem.

01:25:19.889 --> 01:25:23.010
And he said that the strains were real because he sequences stuff.

01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:34.574
And literally three Decembers later, he's still saying the same thing on Brett Weinstein's podcast and on Danny Jones's podcast.

01:25:35.115 --> 01:25:35.595
Plus,

01:25:38.607 --> 01:25:46.674
Remember that in 2020, he was already on many podcasts saying PCR works, just not theirs, not the who's PCR, but our PCR.

01:25:49.997 --> 01:25:55.279
And so now think about this very carefully in the context of my timeline, okay?

01:25:55.499 --> 01:25:56.900
In 2020, I'm lighting it up right here.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.961
In 2020, I was saying nonspecific PCR tests on a loud background.

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:04.103
They're gonna try and transfect kids and that would be a crime.

01:26:04.503 --> 01:26:08.904
And I'm an original gangster drastic member at this time.

01:26:09.785 --> 01:26:18.028
And it is about this time when drastic decides to throw me out because they're concerned about the origin of the virus and I shouldn't want to talk about transfection.

01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:29.099
In 2020, we go to 2021, we have the Corman-Drossman report came out in November the year before.

01:26:29.219 --> 01:26:36.467
And in 2021, in May, we have me writing my review where I say transfection has to be stopped.

01:26:37.765 --> 01:26:50.312
And in the end of 2021, we have Kevin McKernan coming on my stream to tell me that the RNA isn't pure, that they have live dead technology to solve this PCR problem and the strains are real and evolution is cool.

01:26:52.774 --> 01:27:03.039
But then in 2024, in December, he says all the same things, but now tells real, verifiably incorrect, I don't know what else to call them.

01:27:03.079 --> 01:27:03.740
Are they lies?

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:05.641
Can he read?

01:27:06.837 --> 01:27:10.719
He's got to know because he was on my stream in 2021.

01:27:11.099 --> 01:27:21.325
He was on a stream with me in 2023 with John Bodwin and Jessica Rose and Stephanie Seneff of MIT, where I explained how.

01:27:22.325 --> 01:27:27.647
synthetic biology is used and misconstrued as, as virology.

01:27:27.688 --> 01:27:31.829
I explained what infectious clones and how they could, how it could explain the pandemic.

01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:37.492
And it was only after this, several months after this, that he called me chemtrail retarded.

01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:50.738
And then the book came out, the book that says that I'm the expert, the glossary that says I'm the, I'm in the cast of characters, the index that, that says I'm kind of an expert for that book.

01:27:51.977 --> 01:27:54.639
I got paid for almost two years for that book.

01:27:56.119 --> 01:28:19.393
And then the former apprentice of Mark Lander and Francis Collins, since the beginning of the pandemic, talking about how PCR works, but just not theirs, is now saying incorrectly that somebody that came to my house in 2021, that's lied about me for almost three years with a guy in Tokyo or Japan named Kevin McCairn,

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:44.990
He went on a big podcast to say that not me, who's written in the book, who's got selfies with Bobby and with the soon-to-be NIH director, not me, but Charles Rixey, a former Marine and releaser or leaker of the diffuse proposal.

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:49.225
helped Bobby write the book.

01:28:49.565 --> 01:28:56.388
We are at a serious crossroads here because we're supposed to believe that this guy's a hero, buddy.

01:28:56.508 --> 01:28:58.449
What kind of error is he making?

01:28:59.469 --> 01:29:00.430
Listen carefully.

01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:06.513
Because in 2022, in 2022 is when Rixey came to my house.

01:29:10.919 --> 01:29:23.824
In 2023 is when I was on Bobby's podcast, sorry, on that podcast with John Bodwin and talked to Kevin McKernan about these ideas when he could not refute them.

01:29:24.725 --> 01:29:38.090
And it is in 2024, late 2024, that this guy is on a podcast saying that I didn't have anything to do with the book, that it was Charles Rixey who got all the answers with the diffuse proposal.

01:29:39.943 --> 01:29:53.839
that Charles Rixey came to my house three years ago to convince me to not say was fake and to join drastic again to say that the defuse proposal was partly my discovery.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.345
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

01:30:00.906 --> 01:30:01.307
Who?

01:30:01.407 --> 01:30:03.269
Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:11.300
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

01:30:12.101 --> 01:30:12.741
Obama did that, right?

01:30:12.761 --> 01:30:13.322
Obama did that.

01:30:13.382 --> 01:30:24.507
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:30:24.547 --> 01:30:26.648
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

01:30:26.688 --> 01:30:27.988
It's going through some intermediary.

01:30:28.889 --> 01:30:40.714
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seam technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:42.851
And so all of that is smoke and mirrors.

01:30:42.911 --> 01:30:45.333
I've explained that yesterday, but I'll mention it here again.

01:30:46.033 --> 01:30:51.596
Ligation of one DNA molecule to another is a very standard molecular biology technique.

01:30:52.357 --> 01:30:54.358
They have lots of restriction enzymes to do it.

01:30:54.398 --> 01:30:55.739
It's a very standard thing.

01:30:56.199 --> 01:31:00.342
Anybody that's done bench work on molecular biology and made mini preps or assembled a

01:31:00.942 --> 01:31:12.018
Any kind of construct knows this, and so he's just bullshitting somebody who doesn't have the requisite knowledge to know that they're being bullshitted, and calling a no-see-um is just crap.

01:31:12.819 --> 01:31:14.021
It's absolutely crap.

01:31:16.592 --> 01:31:20.694
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

01:31:21.354 --> 01:31:26.576
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it necessarily from a laboratory.

01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:29.298
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints.

01:31:29.498 --> 01:31:38.902
So either you can't tell because they used Ralph Baric's techniques or you can tell and then it's not really no-see-um anymore, right?

01:31:38.942 --> 01:31:41.823
But that doesn't matter with Kevin McKernan because he's lying.

01:31:43.723 --> 01:31:47.946
that make us, that got them caught, basically.

01:31:48.566 --> 01:31:52.028
And you should, if you wanna hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

01:31:52.108 --> 01:31:55.650
Charles Rixey has helped, you know, RFK write his book about this.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:00.894
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been like a dog.

01:32:01.114 --> 01:32:03.976
Understand that this is a person who worked with Mark Lander.

01:32:04.156 --> 01:32:11.100
This is a person who took intellectual property from the Human Genome Project and made multi-generational wealth with it.

01:32:12.605 --> 01:32:17.167
This is a person who at the beginning of the pandemic was saying that PCR works, just not the WHO.

01:32:17.627 --> 01:32:27.371
And he was on podcasts with people who used to work for the WHO and used to work for the World Bank, who just decided to do podcasts at the start of the pandemic.

01:32:28.791 --> 01:32:38.075
And repeatedly, he didn't lose a faculty position at a university, you know, in the United States medical school.

01:32:39.616 --> 01:32:42.257
He got to promote his own, his own business.

01:32:46.078 --> 01:33:03.690
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no way to explain this man's five-year behavior and interference with my ability to provide for my family other than malfeasance and participation in this national security narrative.

01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:04.791
This guy for sure.

01:33:06.874 --> 01:33:29.863
And once you realize that this guy has been promoted by CHD instead of me, that this guy's being promoted on Tucker and Brett and anywhere that can be promoted as an expert on the adulteration of the transfection, when transfection in its purest form would be terribly inappropriate for healthy people, I don't know how to help you.

01:33:31.423 --> 01:33:32.704
But if you can see it,

01:33:34.744 --> 01:33:39.825
then you are really, really close to being able to rip yourself right out of this cave.

01:33:42.566 --> 01:33:45.747
Because he is connected to all of them.

01:33:48.348 --> 01:33:50.969
His timeline reveals all of them.

01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:58.771
Where he was asked to testify, when he testified, and what he said reveals all of it.

01:34:01.377 --> 01:34:29.293
even when he finally decided to say the words transfection on X, reveals all of it as one contiguous uninterrupted pattern of meddling in our history in order to make sure our children would be bamboozled by this national security operation that was simply put in place to take a problem in the population pyramid and manage it with murder hidden by lies.

01:34:30.672 --> 01:34:36.043
and wonderfully enough the infrastructure of the NIH got a new

01:34:37.433 --> 01:34:53.518
never-ending stream of remnants from testing that neither he or any of these other people in the health freedom movement have ever bothered to question since like years and years and years and years ago when it is the foundation of the entire narrative.

01:34:53.858 --> 01:35:01.981
It is the foundation of all of the biology, all of the models, all of the projections, and all of the estimations of the damage done

01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:11.853
are based on this false pretense that PCR was and can be used as an accurate diagnostic on this molecular background.

01:35:13.155 --> 01:35:14.076
It's just not true.

01:35:14.096 --> 01:35:17.741
I'm gonna bone with this problem.

01:35:18.772 --> 01:35:21.413
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

01:35:21.433 --> 01:35:23.194
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

01:35:23.214 --> 01:35:23.815
No, what is that?

01:35:23.955 --> 01:35:31.899
So there was a grant that was... Somebody by the name of Murphy released the defuse proposal and supposedly released it to Veritas.

01:35:31.999 --> 01:35:34.120
That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:39.883
has a picture of him and that O'Keefe guy on top of a mountain with his dogs.

01:35:40.223 --> 01:35:43.985
Because that's when they went hiking and talked about the defuse proposal.

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:47.547
And Veritas doesn't mention Rixey.

01:35:50.168 --> 01:35:53.171
What's going on here other than lying?

01:35:53.551 --> 01:35:55.333
He's said his name twice now.

01:35:56.675 --> 01:36:07.325
Proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of we need to build a vaccine against this because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

01:36:07.826 --> 01:36:10.669
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:12.871
You'll have something to leak from this.

01:36:14.612 --> 01:36:18.435
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

01:36:18.675 --> 01:36:21.317
We've got like $30 million in grants.

01:36:21.477 --> 01:36:23.939
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:26.881
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

01:36:27.061 --> 01:36:35.567
Now what he's saying right there, I would argue is what they got me to say for this book and what they would have liked me to keep saying about the diffuse proposal.

01:36:36.688 --> 01:36:39.790
And in fact, they don't quote me as an employee.

01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:42.732
They quote me from the podcast that I did

01:36:44.855 --> 01:36:49.179
and the private conversations that I had with Bobby before I figured it all out.

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.961
And you can find that in the index.

01:36:52.021 --> 01:37:00.628
You can find it absolutely positively in the index by looking up my last name and going, I think it's page 310, but I'm just going to look.

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:03.811
Yeah.

01:37:04.711 --> 01:37:08.755
And so what he just said is exactly what I'm quoted as saying in the book.

01:37:10.522 --> 01:37:13.904
And so let's just put this up here so you can see it.

01:37:13.984 --> 01:37:19.929
Jonathan Cui similarly observes, the fact that Fauci and NIH turned down Drastic's proposal is irrelevant.

01:37:19.969 --> 01:37:27.635
The proposal itself is evidence that the work may already have been done as that's how modern research is conducted and funded.

01:37:27.715 --> 01:37:34.981
So what I'm suggesting to you again is that these people really desperately wanted to get me to play that role.

01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:50.066
that Alex Washburn and Rixie are now being ushered onto stage to play that role by a former Human Genome Project Research and Development Director on a podcast called Danny Jones.

01:37:52.387 --> 01:38:03.691
And this book, written by the perhaps future Health and Human Services Secretary, suggests that all of what he's saying is verifiably a lie.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:12.703
And so this whole narrative of RNA can pandemic and vaccines work, but they're kind of screwed up.

01:38:13.303 --> 01:38:31.690
This can all be broken and the criminal vaccine schedule can be exposed right now in the next few months because of the existence of this book and because of the existence of that podcast and who that guy is.

01:38:33.891 --> 01:38:35.912
There is no other way to do the math here.

01:38:41.037 --> 01:38:42.457
Because you just can't.

01:38:42.718 --> 01:38:50.583
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows we can get Xed on, we've demonstrated this.

01:38:50.843 --> 01:38:52.384
That's not how DARPA works!

01:38:55.887 --> 01:38:58.349
Unfortunately, that's not how DARPA works!

01:39:02.171 --> 01:39:04.433
And he probably knows that, because I know that.

01:39:05.959 --> 01:39:14.927
I actually applied for a couple of DARPA grants while I was still working at the University of Pittsburgh because I worked for somebody who was a captain, sub-captain in the U.S.

01:39:15.007 --> 01:39:20.792
Navy, and whose Chinese wife went from post-doc to working for McKinsey.

01:39:22.353 --> 01:39:26.176
And that guy is part of the crew that fired me at the University of Pittsburgh.

01:39:27.117 --> 01:39:28.178
That guy was a freak.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.281
And he thought I was nuts.

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.042
and his Chinese wife works for McKinsey.

01:39:37.283 --> 01:39:42.307
Yeah, I'm definitely in on this because I'm burning every bridge I've got.

01:39:42.508 --> 01:39:50.995
I'm calling out every person that I know because I can't explain it any other way than these people are a combination of dumb and malevolent.

01:39:53.188 --> 01:40:10.279
Because before the pandemic, I was respected at the University of Pittsburgh as somebody who could solve almost any problem on an electrophysiological rig and could slice any animal's brain better than anybody else and made the best microscope DIC images that anyone had ever seen.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.902
So I was always getting phone calls, can you come and help me troubleshoot my image?

01:40:16.363 --> 01:40:19.905
I can't seem to quite get the, you know, I can't get the DIC to work.

01:40:21.192 --> 01:40:26.233
And at the start of the pandemic, when I said, ho, ho, ho, wait a minute guys, let's be, let's be careful here.

01:40:26.674 --> 01:40:29.374
Everybody started to think that I was just some kind of clown.

01:40:29.855 --> 01:40:31.995
And it started with the guy that was working for me.

01:40:33.175 --> 01:40:34.776
Or that, sorry, that I was working for.

01:40:38.517 --> 01:40:40.238
So I'm, I'm afraid right now.

01:40:40.378 --> 01:40:43.418
I'm absolutely afraid right now because what is happening here?

01:40:43.799 --> 01:40:48.620
How is it possible that the current set of circumstances could be bad for my family?

01:40:52.332 --> 01:40:57.533
How is it possible that after all this time and all this sacrifice, this could possibly end up bad for my family?

01:40:57.553 --> 01:40:58.794
Yes, we've demonstrated this piece.

01:40:59.194 --> 01:41:00.614
Now we just need to do this last piece.

01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:07.896
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

01:41:08.036 --> 01:41:10.557
These are enzymes that cut a particular sequence.

01:41:10.777 --> 01:41:15.398
They used, because again, he said, well, all grand proposals are already done.

01:41:15.458 --> 01:41:17.959
So this grand proposal means that it was done and that's.

01:41:19.378 --> 01:41:20.098
Stop lying!

01:41:20.839 --> 01:41:25.600
Even if this is a real grant proposal, because it was submitted to DARPA means that that's not true.

01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:26.741
...is in DNA.

01:41:27.261 --> 01:41:27.561
Okay.

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:31.583
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

01:41:32.183 --> 01:41:41.986
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain, like, letters.

01:41:42.627 --> 01:41:43.887
Those are what restrictions on them are.

01:41:43.907 --> 01:41:45.708
So imagine you can only cut and paste where there's a the.

01:41:46.628 --> 01:41:52.852
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

01:41:53.372 --> 01:42:01.576
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with there, which is a couple more letters onto the, right?

01:42:01.636 --> 01:42:03.297
And we're going to use those enzymes to cut here.

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.918
And by doing that, we can assemble this genome.

01:42:04.938 --> 01:42:07.480
Well, they had certain restriction enzymes in that diffuse.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.421
Think about how terrible that was.

01:42:09.501 --> 01:42:15.124
For a guy who's like an expert on this since he was a teenager, that was like the shittiest analogy ever.

01:42:16.104 --> 01:42:19.746
proposal that are present in coronavirus that's currently circulating.

01:42:20.127 --> 01:42:23.989
And that was kind of the smoking gun that showed that, okay, this was in fact assembled.

01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:25.910
It was a product of the diffuse proposal.

01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:30.413
Someone eventually carried out that, that grant application to its final conclusion.

01:42:31.014 --> 01:42:32.695
And that's what's actually circulating.

01:42:33.475 --> 01:42:36.177
Um, and Rixie has the whole story on this.

01:42:36.217 --> 01:42:38.158
You want to talk to him and Alex Washburn.

01:42:38.458 --> 01:42:40.540
Um, Alex Washburn did some really interesting work.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:40.980
Um,

01:42:41.576 --> 01:42:51.763
Of course, I was called at like one in the morning and asked to work on an article which promoted Alex Washburn's paper, which purported to kind of, you know, solve this mystery.

01:42:52.163 --> 01:42:56.626
And actually Rixey at the time was supposed to help us write that article, but he fell asleep.

01:42:58.568 --> 01:42:59.408
I can't make it up.

01:42:59.789 --> 01:43:05.452
There are people that are listed in this, in the acknowledgements page that know all these stories because they were there.

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:08.695
They were in the Zoom meetings when we were writing those articles.

01:43:09.815 --> 01:43:11.096
Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:11.116 --> 01:43:13.237
knows that story because he was like, where's Rixey?

01:43:13.257 --> 01:43:16.279
Why isn't he on the phone?

01:43:17.419 --> 01:43:24.003
It's laughable to me how easy it is without even having notes or anything that I can just have to remember what happened.

01:43:24.543 --> 01:43:32.928
And the ludicrous nature of this timeline reveals itself like the finely painted lines on a highway.

01:43:32.968 --> 01:43:33.909
It's perfect.

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:42.580
mapping out the frequencies of these cut sites in all other coronaviruses.

01:43:43.601 --> 01:43:53.104
And only in SARS-CoV-2 do they exist in a manner where they are almost perfectly spaced into, they build a thing back together in six pieces.

01:43:53.184 --> 01:43:55.345
So the Humpty Dumpty comes back together.

01:43:55.745 --> 01:44:06.609
And so with this no-see-um technique that Breric said that he gave to, that he said that they gave to the Wuhan lab, and it makes it so you can't see that anybody did anything,

01:44:07.069 --> 01:44:10.635
They used it, but they left all their sequences, their signature behind.

01:44:10.655 --> 01:44:14.500
Do you see how ridiculously contradictory this story is?

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.365
Stupid complicated too.

01:44:19.099 --> 01:44:23.604
in a sort of an engineering way through only in SARS-CoV-2.

01:44:23.704 --> 01:44:29.309
If you look at where those restriction sites exist in all the other coronaviruses we know about, they're kind of randomly scattered.

01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:31.572
They don't look like someone designed them in.

01:44:31.592 --> 01:44:38.238
When you look in SARS-CoV-2, they're very perfectly spaced such that an engineer put it together.

01:44:39.119 --> 01:44:52.829
and there's a particular set of them near the fear and cleavage site that looks like it's designed to take that fear and cleavage site in and out and mutate it and swap it around so that you can optimize this to actually hit ACE2 receptors.

01:44:53.590 --> 01:45:00.395
And what's remarkable about the zoonosis thesis is that this thing came out pre-optimized.

01:45:00.655 --> 01:45:07.460
Now remember, this thing came out pre-optimized is something that me as an OG drastic member was saying in

01:45:11.056 --> 01:45:12.276
We were saying this in 2020.

01:45:12.416 --> 01:45:20.519
We were saying this in 2020 because that was already the limited spectrum of debate in 2020.

01:45:21.479 --> 01:45:23.260
The affinity for ACE2.

01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:25.740
Remember, that's why Dr. Quay got involved.

01:45:27.061 --> 01:45:30.522
That's why that other character in Australia got involved.

01:45:30.622 --> 01:45:32.142
I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

01:45:32.202 --> 01:45:34.723
Darn it, it's making me mad because he also had a vaccine candidate.

01:45:34.743 --> 01:45:35.183
Darn it.

01:45:38.723 --> 01:45:40.604
It's just endless, ladies and gentlemen.

01:45:40.684 --> 01:45:42.585
I'm sorry, but I've seen the alien.

01:45:43.105 --> 01:45:44.346
It's driving me bananas.

01:45:44.846 --> 01:45:50.549
Like when we first found SARS coronavirus, the binding affinity to ACE2 was already optimized.

01:45:50.669 --> 01:45:51.889
That's not normal.

01:45:52.009 --> 01:45:55.111
The binding affinity was already reported right away, right?

01:45:55.151 --> 01:45:58.772
As evidence of a lab leak and enrichment.

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:05.796
Like if this were a zoonotic event, the leap would mean it was unoptimized and would take maybe five or 10 years to become more optimized in the population.

01:46:06.596 --> 01:46:25.915
That's another signature that someone had to have a piece inside the design of this virus that they could swap in and out to put a library in there, to combinatorially screen for fear and cleavage sites in receptor binding domains that would effectively allow them to reach for optimization out of the gate.

01:46:26.918 --> 01:46:37.184
And so Charles and Alex have a good story around this about how they use serial passaging and the engineering design that they have in this implicate this as being, in fact, a weapon that was built.

01:46:37.605 --> 01:46:40.466
And it's not something that hopped over from pangolins and bats and all that stuff.

01:46:40.807 --> 01:46:42.328
A weapon that was built.

01:46:42.468 --> 01:46:47.651
Not that dissimilar to what Brett Weinstein said on his third podcast with his wife, right?

01:46:48.091 --> 01:46:50.552
Bats, bioweapons, and societal response.

01:46:51.973 --> 01:46:54.315
And in 2024, it's a bioweapon that was built.

01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.770
That's what drastic was saying in 2020 already that it was a bioweapon.

01:47:03.789 --> 01:47:10.112
Ladies and gentlemen, they have revealed themselves because of their arrogance, because they think we're farther behind or something.

01:47:10.172 --> 01:47:11.253
I don't know what's going on.

01:47:11.733 --> 01:47:16.215
But this is a huge kink in the armor because Rixie is not listed in the book.

01:47:16.635 --> 01:47:17.876
Diffuse is fake.

01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:21.338
And this guy's saying all the things that he's saying.

01:47:21.458 --> 01:47:28.301
I would have predicted this two and a half years ago when that silly Defender article was written at the middle of the night.

01:47:30.285 --> 01:47:31.565
that this is where we were going.

01:47:31.885 --> 01:47:32.866
And I probably did.

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:35.487
If you could look back at my streams, you'd probably find that.

01:47:38.748 --> 01:47:39.808
Jesus Christ.

01:47:40.088 --> 01:47:40.268
Yeah.

01:47:40.388 --> 01:47:45.590
Harvey Rich, I think has another interesting like window on this, like the Harvey Reich.

01:47:47.170 --> 01:47:51.411
I have a recording of Harvey Reich that I can't use because I recorded it without his permission.

01:47:51.491 --> 01:47:56.353
But, uh, uh, before I deleted it, there was a recording of,

01:47:57.097 --> 01:48:06.692
of him saying all kinds of ridiculous things about how he was on hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic and he took the shots, but he still got COVID and it was worse and terrible and whatever.

01:48:07.192 --> 01:48:08.074
And I laughed at him.

01:48:11.277 --> 01:48:34.374
Harvey Reich was on stage in the fourth COVID summit in Romania with Nick Hudson and Denny Rancourt and Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone and Jessica Rose and Jason Kristoff and Ryan Cole and Byron Bridle in Romania in November of 2023.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.403
It's worth a view on the Ron Johnson thing that I was at.

01:48:47.384 --> 01:48:50.627
Harvey gave his pitch on like, all right, where the hell did this all come from?

01:48:51.127 --> 01:48:52.749
And how do we avoid doing this again?

01:48:52.769 --> 01:48:58.914
And he had the most compelling synopsis, I think, because everyone's been like, can they be this evil?

01:48:58.974 --> 01:48:59.735
What the hell happened?

01:49:01.696 --> 01:49:12.983
I think his story makes the most sense, which is that the biodefense industry, if you will, has always kind of justified itself on that we need to be doing gain-of-function research to protect against a particular weapon.

01:49:13.183 --> 01:49:14.744
And so we're going to preemptively do all this.

01:49:15.865 --> 01:49:20.908
Fast forward to 2020, they've never come up with something they've saved us from.

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.350
And then the first thing that leaks

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:25.811
is potentially from their own making, right?

01:49:26.812 --> 01:49:34.919
So that puts the biodefense industry on their heels and that we have to be in control of the solution to this, otherwise we're non-existent when this is done.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:44.568
So the biodefense industry leaked something they didn't intend to leak and now they're overplaying their hand because if they're not in control at the end of this, then they won't exist.

01:49:49.739 --> 01:49:50.179
Lion!

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.361
Boy, that is some really terrible shit right there.

01:49:54.481 --> 01:49:57.042
Let's get Fauci involved, because they had him on payroll.

01:49:57.642 --> 01:50:04.265
And of course, Fauci, I think you've probably seen some of those emails and conversations that- Oh, yeah.

01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:05.226
You'll have orders.

01:50:05.366 --> 01:50:06.266
You have things to do.

01:50:06.306 --> 01:50:10.268
He's so arrogantly talking about, you won't, you'll get a vaccine or you'll lose your job.

01:50:10.848 --> 01:50:12.769
The kids will get kicked out of school.

01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:29.168
his his emails internally that leaked out of the NIH were were like you'll have things to do tomorrow you must read this paper this is a paper about you know potential leak right early on this like February and the pandemic where it it first hit on him

01:50:29.788 --> 01:50:45.605
That this could have come from money from his pocket like it could have come from the whiff and the Wuhan Institute of Virology and so suddenly Tony's now implicated and maybe have funding the virus that leaked and It's only he's in panic mode sending emails to everyone that night like read all so the scooby-doo mystery.

01:50:45.665 --> 01:50:48.608
He's unmasking Fauci right now See they covered it up

01:50:49.830 --> 01:51:12.672
It's the Scooby-Doo Mystery at the end of 2024 provided by the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, apprentice of Mark Lander and Tony Fauci and Francis Collins, who was at the start of the pandemic telling us that PCR works, just not theirs, who was part of the Corman-Jorston report, which was a fake

01:51:13.447 --> 01:51:30.575
fake objection to the who's PCR test while still promoting PCR as a diagnostic who came on my stream in 2021 to say nothing useful less than a couple weeks before Rixie would come to my house to beg me to accept the defuse proposal as real

01:51:31.155 --> 01:51:54.034
and a year later i would be on a stream with kevin again where he would try to debunk the the the synthetic dna and rna is transfected into cell culture and that's virology nonsense that eventually called me chemtrail retarded is now a year later after that on a very big podcast saying that ricksy is a hero and that he has the the

01:51:55.155 --> 01:52:01.220
the goods on this, you know, cause he has been keeping an Excel file since the beginning of the pandemic.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:09.487
I mean, nevermind Mark Housatonic's website or whatever, just Rixey's Excel file is just amazing.

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:29.371
The stuff you'll have you'll have assignments tomorrow like we got to get on this and Francis Collins is in there talking about how We have to have a swift takedown of all these conspiracy theories that say it comes it could be engineered And so they're in high gear right now trying to cover the can you feel how it's a hamster wheel?

01:52:30.491 --> 01:52:34.054
And when I say hamster wheel, I mean that rungs and the wheel come back

01:52:35.165 --> 01:52:39.708
You know, if you shit on this part of the wheel, it's going to come back and you're going to run through your own shit.

01:52:40.188 --> 01:52:47.452
And in this case, what happens during the hamster wheel is these parts of the narrative come back as if they were always confirmed.

01:52:47.492 --> 01:53:04.322
You know, like, yeah, they funded Peter Daszak and yada, yada, yada, but nobody ever makes the jump that maybe Shang-Chi Lee was working for the American government too and reported a sequence that the American government or whatever, you know, military industrial complex is pulling this off.

01:53:04.742 --> 01:53:07.784
and managing our population pyramid wanted her to find?

01:53:09.144 --> 01:53:10.065
Isn't that weird?

01:53:10.385 --> 01:53:14.507
How they're fine with saying that the virus was created, but then it's gotta be a leak.

01:53:14.847 --> 01:53:19.890
It couldn't be that the agent that they were paying also just reported whatever frickin' sequence they wanted.

01:53:21.010 --> 01:53:22.391
And then they just went ahead with it.

01:53:24.437 --> 01:53:31.000
It's just amazing how many permutations and interpretations of the recent history are completely ignored.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:48.609
And instead, this ridiculously simple Scooby-Doo mystery narrative is repeated over and over and over again by these people to the point where they even wrote a book about it that they now have to lie about in order to make sure that I am not associated with it.

01:53:49.690 --> 01:53:52.411
That what I have to say about this book is never heard

01:53:54.847 --> 01:54:08.882
If this is not evidence of the current situation we're in and how close we are to breaking this narrative, I don't know how many times we're gonna get this close again for it to be so obvious.

01:54:10.704 --> 01:54:15.329
This guy, this guy is being nominated for HHS secretary.

01:54:17.199 --> 01:54:20.808
Jay Bhattacharya is being nominated for NIH director.

01:54:21.369 --> 01:54:24.698
This should not be bad for my family.

01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:34.029
But his take is that the biodefense program then went to high gear trying to get the vaccine as the only solution to fix this.

01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:37.392
That way, they would have a justification for, yes, something leaked.

01:54:37.472 --> 01:54:38.893
Sorry, we don't really know who made it.

01:54:39.074 --> 01:54:42.677
But we happened to save the day with a biodefense program having this vaccine ready.

01:54:42.777 --> 01:54:44.799
See, this scan and function stuff really needs to happen.

01:54:44.819 --> 01:54:47.942
Otherwise, we would have been millions of people would have died without this.

01:54:49.025 --> 01:54:51.669
which is a narrative you hear people try to propagate in the news, right?

01:54:52.230 --> 01:54:55.214
That without this vaccine, it saves 20 million people.

01:54:55.254 --> 01:55:02.385
They conjure up all of these weird epidemiological studies that try to make that case in their own modeling studies that are easily dismantled.

01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:20.472
I think that that is a lesson for us going forward that this gain-of-function work is more dangerous than it can ever help and it is something they need to put a real tight lid on because This you know, I'm involved in a separate side of this which is okay.

01:55:20.512 --> 01:55:23.953
You found a contaminant in these machines and that could implicate fraud.

01:55:24.093 --> 01:55:26.173
Fraud might unwind the PREP Act.

01:55:27.293 --> 01:55:34.675
Therefore lawyers can now go after the FDA and the first trial that tried to do that was with Brooke Jackson and Brooke Jackson had evidence of

01:55:34.775 --> 01:55:36.636
So now they can go after the FDA.

01:55:36.676 --> 01:55:37.257
Do you hear it?

01:55:37.857 --> 01:55:39.378
Cause that's where this is going.

01:55:39.938 --> 01:55:40.719
I'm sure of it.

01:55:40.999 --> 01:55:42.340
Of the trials being fabricated.

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:53.006
Like she was in that, she was at Ventavia being asked to like, you know, shift around the PCR numbers or, or shift around the data on unblind this site and then blind that site.

01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:55.768
That way they could, they could play games with the clinical trial data.

01:55:55.828 --> 01:55:56.108
Right.

01:55:56.168 --> 01:55:58.649
Doesn't sound like he's being very accurate here.

01:56:01.511 --> 01:56:02.652
I bet that's by design.

01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:04.630
And she blew the whistle on that.

01:56:04.971 --> 01:56:05.792
They brought that to court.

01:56:06.092 --> 01:56:12.420
The judge ruled that this was not – yes, Pfizer lied, but they were told to lie by the DoD.

01:56:12.621 --> 01:56:15.865
This is not a typical manufacturing arrangement.

01:56:15.925 --> 01:56:18.749
This is actually a biological countermeasure.

01:56:18.809 --> 01:56:19.750
The DoD is running this.

01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.372
You have the wrong defendants.

01:56:22.253 --> 01:56:25.476
So they have to like re-steer their case maybe toward the DOD.

01:56:25.516 --> 01:56:26.116
I mean, they don't know.

01:56:26.156 --> 01:56:27.697
This is how do you sue the DOD?

01:56:28.738 --> 01:56:33.262
The judge said that they were told to lie about the SV40 because... No, not SV40.

01:56:33.282 --> 01:56:36.765
This is just fraud, a different form of fraud.

01:56:37.285 --> 01:56:40.868
But we expect if we approach them with the SV40 thing, they'll probably use the same excuse.

01:56:40.908 --> 01:56:42.169
Like it's a precedent that they said.

01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:44.791
I can't believe this SV40 story isn't everywhere.

01:56:45.356 --> 01:56:50.218
Yeah, they have a lot of fact checkers talking about it, which is a sign that they're worried about it.

01:56:50.558 --> 01:57:02.623
They don't assign, all the fact checkers you see, if you dig into them, there's some connection of money either back to the Gates Foundation or to a pharmaceutical company one way or another.

01:57:03.003 --> 01:57:11.566
They are pumping out, I mean, even the government came out saying they had a billion dollars to spend on reducing vaccine hesitancy for basically marketing their narrative.

01:57:13.467 --> 01:57:34.496
I wonder how many billions of dollars they had to make sure that the existence of a novel virus was never questioned, that the use of PCR as a diagnostic to create a remnant stream that could create a database that could be used to interface with Epic database or any other database of a corporate hospital or corporate health

01:57:36.457 --> 01:57:56.708
insurance database and look at those genomes from those college kids and get their medical records and put them all together and create the dream database that anybody that worked for the Human Genome Project would know would be the invaluable resource that they would need to make any progress in the future using, I don't know, AI to try and decode the human genome.

01:57:57.389 --> 01:58:03.532
You know, like Claire Craig, his co-author on the Corman Drosten Review was doing before the pandemic.

01:58:07.893 --> 01:58:13.641
If you will, so when you can tell which topics worry them by how many fact checkers are sick on it.

01:58:14.382 --> 01:58:20.690
And I think you can tell which which dissident voices worry them by how many of these people came to their house.

01:58:22.688 --> 01:58:37.075
How many of these people have just gone on the attack and just called me a liar, shithead, pedophile like Sasha Latupova or called me chemtrail retarded like the Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project did?

01:58:37.515 --> 01:58:39.216
What a badge of honor that is!

01:58:41.428 --> 01:59:06.561
That's one step away from having Tony Fauci call me chemtrail retarded or Francis Collins to write a folk song and sing about me being chemtrail retarded is the only thing that could be better than having a substack article written by the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project calling my idea

01:59:08.393 --> 01:59:25.496
not even my idea, just my semantic choice of how to describe virology as the use of synthetic DNA and RNA to transfect cell culture and animals and call that virology.

01:59:25.616 --> 01:59:31.917
That's Chemtrail retarded to the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project.

01:59:32.077 --> 01:59:37.218
And I believe with my whole heart and mind that his statement

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.199
is an admission.

01:59:41.302 --> 01:59:50.838
And that in my lifetime, if not in the next few years, that will result in his public humiliation.

01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:57.152
It has to, because Rixey didn't help him write this book.

01:59:57.613 --> 01:59:59.874
Rixey didn't release the diffuse proposal.

01:59:59.914 --> 02:00:01.615
The diffuse proposal is a lie.

02:00:02.055 --> 02:00:04.637
Any proposal that's given to DARPA is not done.

02:00:05.177 --> 02:00:06.618
It is a literal proposal.

02:00:06.658 --> 02:00:07.738
That's what DARPA does.

02:00:07.818 --> 02:00:11.320
It's very different than an NIH R01 grant.

02:00:13.341 --> 02:00:15.923
And when I was quoted in this book, I didn't even understand that.

02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:24.132
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at one of the most crucial points in human history right now.

02:00:24.332 --> 02:00:33.836
And it is absolutely imperative that we try to wake as many people up as we can because they have gone over their skis.

02:00:35.217 --> 02:00:40.639
And there's no way to explain this timeline with good intentions.

02:00:44.068 --> 02:00:45.649
We're probably right up there at the top.

02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:50.350
If you look up the SV40 stuff, they have gotten every one of the fact-checkers to write something about it.

02:00:51.931 --> 02:00:53.952
There is no way to explain it.

02:00:55.132 --> 02:00:58.853
This should never be bad for my family.

02:01:00.874 --> 02:01:05.115
Having participated in the writing of this book should never have been bad for my family.

02:01:05.556 --> 02:01:09.297
Becoming friends with Jay Bhattacharya should never be bad for my family.

02:01:11.277 --> 02:01:23.824
Having had Jessica Rose and Mary Bowden and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey on my stream should not have ended up bad for my family.

02:01:23.864 --> 02:01:37.952
But somehow or another, despite having a friend nominated for the NIH director and having a former employer and friend nominated for HHS secretary, my family's in trouble.

02:01:38.932 --> 02:01:40.153
We don't have rent for next month.

02:01:41.966 --> 02:01:49.948
And we won't have rent for the month after that, and we won't have rent for the month after that, unless something is changed about what we're doing here.

02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.710
Unless this starts to get out in a way that it's not getting out right now.

02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:58.731
Otherwise, my work will still depend on like four people.

02:02:00.451 --> 02:02:05.553
Greg, and Jeff, and Kara, and Simon, and Steven, that's it.

02:02:05.793 --> 02:02:06.893
And William.

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:09.134
That's it.

02:02:10.478 --> 02:02:17.484
Everybody else that's subscribing, yes, they are helping and it is amazing that I have subscribers that give me $10 a month.

02:02:19.506 --> 02:02:21.407
But I'm not gaining any of those people.

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:37.560
That should go up steadily if what I'm saying is true and the message that I am saying is fact-checked or challenged and comes out ahead, then there's no explanation for why my family and I still only have 130 people subscribed.

02:02:41.607 --> 02:02:46.589
Still only have 3,100 people on Twitch that even follow me.

02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:51.232
Still have less than 14,000 followers on Twitch.

02:02:51.652 --> 02:02:53.833
Still nobody really finding the soapbox.

02:02:54.213 --> 02:02:57.194
Still not really getting a thousand views on my peer tube.

02:02:57.655 --> 02:03:00.516
Something is extremely wrong.

02:03:02.457 --> 02:03:08.460
And it is because the military programs of social media have absolutely and totally X'd me out.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.501
You think that other people see me.

02:03:12.721 --> 02:03:15.462
I think other people see me, but other people don't.

02:03:16.742 --> 02:03:18.143
Even when you retweet me.

02:03:21.564 --> 02:03:23.065
And there's no way for you to check.

02:03:24.825 --> 02:03:25.705
You just assume.

02:03:27.126 --> 02:03:28.546
Those numbers are all fake.

02:03:30.047 --> 02:03:32.688
And they probably have been since the beginning of the pandemic.

02:03:35.949 --> 02:03:37.930
I hope my friends don't leave me in the lurch.

02:03:39.241 --> 02:03:46.587
I hope my relationship with these people doesn't end up to be something that costs my family into the future.

02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:54.954
It definitely shouldn't, but I can tell you for sure that nobody is in this narrative by chance.

02:03:54.994 --> 02:04:00.639
If you look at Pierre Khoury's record and what he said and when he said it, you will find that he's not there by accident.

02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:15.021
If you look at this guy who is an author of the Corman-Jorston Review with Claire Craig and what he's saying then versus what he's saying now, you can see that there's nobody in this narrative by chance.

02:04:15.141 --> 02:04:22.387
The research and development director of the Human Genome Project is not just doing this because he really believes in health freedom.

02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:30.211
And so I'm just gonna say it plainly.

02:04:30.292 --> 02:04:57.158
I think that ICANN and CHD and FLCCC and Pandata or Panda and Heart and the Doctors for COVID Ethics group run by Michael Palmer are all probably sabotaged from the inside because members of team worst case scenario that include but are not limited to George Webb and his associates, Robert Malone and his associates, Steve Bannon and his associates and the intellectual Dark Web and adjacent bros with shows.

02:04:59.642 --> 02:05:11.260
And these people have been responsible for infiltrating and polluting this message of these groups, even coordinating the sabotage of these groups to make sure that they never usefully have a message.

02:05:11.701 --> 02:05:12.943
And it's found everywhere.

02:05:15.708 --> 02:05:16.809
You want some history?

02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:24.955
Maybe you can go get your copies of the AAPS News, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.

02:05:25.516 --> 02:05:39.087
I have a follower by the name of Juan who was disappointed in one of my last streams because he didn't realize that the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wasn't as good as he thought they were, even though he's a subscriber to them.

02:05:39.881 --> 02:05:48.423
because he went through all these journals and he finds like article after article by Stephen Hadfield and Robert Malone.

02:05:49.523 --> 02:05:54.224
And all of them are saying stuff that doesn't get our kids out.

02:05:57.884 --> 02:06:07.726
And so I wasn't publishing every quarter in the AAPS News, but they were, and they were publishing things that

02:06:08.804 --> 02:06:16.171
that supported the idea of a novel virus that needed novel solutions that might have been from gain of function that would come again.

02:06:17.904 --> 02:06:27.349
I don't know where these people got their money, but I could make a reasonable guess that a lot of it comes from the diagnostics and the industry and companies and stocks associated with that.

02:06:27.809 --> 02:06:30.991
Those are medical devices also regulated by the FDA.

02:06:31.051 --> 02:06:39.495
And if this was gonna be crushed, if this was gonna be exposed as the fraud that it was just to create remnants for the military version of the,

02:06:40.899 --> 02:06:49.584
of the Human Genome Project, then the way that it would be exposed would be to use the FDA to destroy diagnostics as medical devices that don't work.

02:06:51.297 --> 02:06:53.398
and specifically PCR diagnostics.

02:06:53.899 --> 02:07:07.808
Another thing that a lot of these people are into, because if you go to their streams, to these guys' streams, you will see that they're all selling supplements, and those are supplements whose labels are necessarily regulated by the FDA.

02:07:07.848 --> 02:07:15.053
The FDA doesn't allow them to say shit on their labels that isn't true unless they say that none of this has been verified by the FDA.

02:07:15.093 --> 02:07:20.817
They can't say safe and effective or what it does without also admitting that it hasn't been evaluated

02:07:21.697 --> 02:07:22.938
And that's the FDA's fault.

02:07:23.298 --> 02:07:32.381
So all these people, the wellness company, all these fitness supplements, all these things really don't like the FDA that much because their label is governed by them.

02:07:33.501 --> 02:07:37.042
The claims that they can make in their commercials are governed by the FDA.

02:07:37.482 --> 02:07:42.644
The same people that govern the diagnostic stream and old and new social media.

02:07:44.673 --> 02:07:50.038
because of course the demonstrating their power also gets them a seat at the table.

02:07:50.118 --> 02:07:57.724
So private interests are starting to get a seat at the table in the military industrial complex governance of us, even playing roles in us.

02:07:58.285 --> 02:08:00.386
And that's another place where this money comes from.

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:02.648
You know, Locals has got money in it.

02:08:02.728 --> 02:08:08.693
Rumbles got contracts and all those people are taking contracts from those new and old social media.

02:08:08.733 --> 02:08:10.035
I guarantee it, including X.

02:08:14.696 --> 02:08:42.267
And so the associated stocks of course are the reason why maybe Steve Bannon and somebody like Paul Cottrell who worked for Catholic charities and trading for them would be involved in this because they could take advantage of the diagnostics and warp speed and the supplements and make sure that there was money always flowing that could support this huge network of meddlers that was going to muddy the water around anything useful and never, ever, ever

02:08:42.907 --> 02:08:45.028
make any progress into getting our kids out.

02:08:47.568 --> 02:08:51.670
And most of them can be seen very clearly as being anti-FDA.

02:08:52.110 --> 02:09:09.235
Incidentally, the director, the research and development director for the Human Genome Project, Kevin McKernan, in 2020 is three times on a podcast of Vance Crowe, who used to work for the World Bank, saying that the FDA is in the way because an EUA is like 10 pages of paperwork.

02:09:09.555 --> 02:09:12.736
And if we didn't have the FDA, we'd probably already be out of this pandemic.

02:09:13.823 --> 02:09:31.964
And in 2025, not very dissimilarly from that, the only organization really regularly under attack is the FDA, but not because of the PCR and the illusion of the pandemic, but because the FDA is bad and they let the shots through.

02:09:40.936 --> 02:09:54.768
And I believe that the FDA could be one of the ways that we could save our children from being co-opted into this medical sampling experimental paradigm that they are inverting our sovereignty to.

02:09:56.249 --> 02:10:00.352
I think the FDA and its mandate might be something that our kids might wanna have.

02:10:02.174 --> 02:10:07.098
And I think that a lot of these people might actually be interested in getting rid of it because it also would enable this.

02:10:08.479 --> 02:10:13.169
the endless generation of remnants on diagnostics that don't need to be tested anymore.

02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:16.557
Maybe because the diagnostics are personal for you.

02:10:17.579 --> 02:10:18.281
Stop lying!

02:10:21.809 --> 02:10:29.452
So PCR is a diagnostic, is an illusion because of the way that it's used on the academic bench versus the way that it was used at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:10:29.892 --> 02:10:42.676
None of these people will reasonably talk about how it was used at the beginning of the pandemic, both with single amplicon, without nested primers, but also with multiple amplicons, but not requiring all the amplicons to be present.

02:10:43.016 --> 02:10:47.521
and then changing and ratcheting that up back and forth in over 200 permutations.

02:10:47.962 --> 02:10:49.203
Nobody's ever going to say that.

02:10:49.243 --> 02:11:01.117
They don't want to talk about that at all because there's still money being made and still remnants being generated because PCR has become accepted as a diagnostic as a result of the plandemic exercise.

02:11:02.858 --> 02:11:09.285
They don't want to talk about synthetic recombinant genetics because what that would reveal is that they've always known this would be a problem.

02:11:09.365 --> 02:11:23.839
All these things, these are not shortcomings that any of these people who worked in pharmaceutical companies didn't already know about, including Mike Yeadon and Sasha Latupova and Jonathan Engler and anybody else that worked in pharmaceutical for years before this.

02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:36.792
Because pharmaceutical companies make biologics, and the way they make biologics is to make DNA in large quantities using bacterial cultures and then convert that DNA to the biologic, which is a protein, like an antibody.

02:11:37.994 --> 02:11:44.080
And so all of these pharmaceutical companies had the ability to make DNA, therefore they had all the ability to make RNA too.

02:11:45.424 --> 02:11:56.508
And so this idea that they had to ramp up manufacturing or convert a bunch of factories or make new factories is kind of a limited hangout because all of the equipment existed, all the techniques existed.

02:11:56.988 --> 02:12:08.613
And somebody who's doing that kind of work wouldn't even know what they were growing because all of the basics of growing the recombinant DNA in the bacteria vat, that's all the same mix.

02:12:11.311 --> 02:12:17.975
And so they don't want you to know that this is not new, that this is one of the only things they can do, which is what?

02:12:18.555 --> 02:12:23.578
They can make an absolute megaton of pure DNA or pure RNA if they want to.

02:12:25.099 --> 02:12:26.580
That's what PCR finds.

02:12:28.701 --> 02:12:30.062
And so on a background,

02:12:31.144 --> 02:12:33.725
If they wanted to find something, it would be very easy to find.

02:12:33.785 --> 02:12:42.408
If they had an agent that they had already been paying through EcoHealth Alliance, then that agent would report and find exactly what she was told to find.

02:12:42.808 --> 02:12:53.532
And the way that they would do it is just make it using standard techniques that were developed during the Human Genome Project under the direction of Kevin McKernan.

02:12:56.226 --> 02:13:03.950
And so transfection is a crime and it always was because we've been using synthetic DNA and RNA to transfect things for a long time.

02:13:04.330 --> 02:13:09.112
We tried it on Jesse Gelsinger and Robert Malone was involved in that coverup as well.

02:13:09.532 --> 02:13:13.634
We are there now, ladies and gentlemen, this is over, this needs to end.

02:13:14.074 --> 02:13:21.458
Transfection was always a crime and that's why they had to interfere with my family from 2020 onward, because I was saying it in 2020.

02:13:24.690 --> 02:13:39.736
The other thing they're not saying is how easily these manufacturing quotas could be met and how easily the safety signal otherwise definitely expected from a transfection mass rollout would be avoided is placebo.

02:13:40.476 --> 02:13:51.221
And that's why they had people like Sasha Latupova fooling people like Mike Eden into talking about different batches instead of just saying how easy it would be to do this with placebo.

02:13:53.001 --> 02:13:54.062
And they're still not saying it.

02:13:54.758 --> 02:14:03.906
And they never will, even though they're manufacturing experts and know that this is the way, even though Mike Eden in 2021 in January almost said it.

02:14:05.627 --> 02:14:09.931
When he was presenting Sasha's data, he said, you know, you could get the same results with saline.

02:14:13.534 --> 02:14:15.475
And then for four years, he never said it again.

02:14:16.436 --> 02:14:17.237
Interesting, isn't it?

02:14:18.959 --> 02:14:28.064
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just one possibility that they made a sequence that they wanted to find and they released it or even better, they had their agent in Wuhan say that she found it.

02:14:28.604 --> 02:14:35.607
That sequence was an immunogen that was designed by the NIH so that when they used it in their transfection, it would work.

02:14:35.687 --> 02:14:41.931
And then they rolled out that transfection on a placebo background so that there would be no useful signal that anybody would see.

02:14:42.331 --> 02:14:48.554
And they use non-specific PCR tests to convert a background to that signal or pretend that they did.

02:14:53.601 --> 02:15:00.058
and instead we have a health freedom movement in America that won't talk about 2020 and health freedom rocks and that's about all they've got to say.

02:15:02.509 --> 02:15:12.877
And that health freedom movement descends from a health freedom movement that is even before 2015, but in 2015, when Mary Holland herself was on Democracy Now!

02:15:12.937 --> 02:15:16.219
to say that some component of the MMR vaccine injured her son.

02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:30.570
A year later, there would be a vaxxed movie, and five years later, the pandemic would start, and all those people who knew all about the vaccine schedule and its dangers before the pandemic would, rather than telling us to not comply,

02:15:32.298 --> 02:15:40.164
would have stories about a fear and cleavage site and a toxic spike protein and flying AIDS or no virus or the PCR works just not theirs.

02:15:42.266 --> 02:15:55.697
And six years later, this health freedom movement has a track record lacking the principles that they purported to have already back before the pandemic.

02:15:56.498 --> 02:15:59.020
And instead has littered with evidence

02:16:00.353 --> 02:16:20.087
patterns of malfeasance, patterns of lies and obfuscation, patterns of not being dissident, outspoken, risking everything, but instead being participants in a limited spectrum of debates set up by a military operation probably to manage the population pyramid in the West.

02:16:25.501 --> 02:16:29.603
That's why I think social media is this, but it requires these people.

02:16:30.183 --> 02:16:40.968
Without these participants, social media is not the fine, sharp, military, psychological katana that it has become.

02:16:41.048 --> 02:16:42.689
Without these performers,

02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:44.310
It's not possible.

02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:58.220
Charles Rixey and Andrew Huff were running around together behind the scenes at Bobby's announcement in Boston, the same place where I saw Robert Malone hug Meryl Nass like they were high school sweethearts.

02:16:59.821 --> 02:17:11.370
Brett Weinstein has been in a Signal chat with me since 2020 when I was telling him that transfection would cause autoimmunity and it would be impossible to describe how many ways.

02:17:12.659 --> 02:17:24.027
And Kevin McKernan is central to this narrative because of his history all the way back to the Human Genome Project that I'm arguing has needed this remnant stream all along.

02:17:29.770 --> 02:17:31.872
And they had the perfect cover.

02:17:32.792 --> 02:17:38.016
A predicted rise in all-cause mortality that they could tell whatever story they wanted to about, and they did.

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:42.099
They used murder and lies, perpetuated by traitors,

02:17:42.918 --> 02:17:43.758
to hide the murder.

02:17:44.999 --> 02:17:45.319
Myths.

02:17:47.479 --> 02:17:52.281
Myths that go all the way back to DNA, therefore evolution.

02:17:52.781 --> 02:17:53.721
The bad biology 101.

02:17:55.162 --> 02:17:58.423
They murdered people, ladies and gentlemen, and called it a mystery virus.

02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:04.714
It's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

02:18:04.734 --> 02:18:22.607
That's why we don't have lawyers that will discuss the legal ramifications of these laws, the legal framework that is violated by these laws, the legal norms that are violated by these laws, which essentially qualify them to be struck on their face as unconstitutional

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:25.649
We don't have a lawyer that can say that.

02:18:25.749 --> 02:18:40.078
We only have a biologist in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh who can say that if a law allows the government to suspend fundamental rights, then there better be some strict scrutiny in the law, otherwise the law is unconstitutional.

02:18:44.898 --> 02:18:47.282
This can't be bad for my family, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:47.322 --> 02:18:50.728
It's just impossible for me to believe that this can be bad for my family.

02:18:50.808 --> 02:18:59.202
Instead, I am optimistic that this means that we are very close to this dam breaking open, the truth coming out, and our children being free.

02:19:00.638 --> 02:19:05.061
I think the truth is available and I think it can be placed on one slide and this is the slide.

02:19:05.101 --> 02:19:07.343
Ladies and gentlemen, I love you very much.

02:19:07.403 --> 02:19:08.343
Thank you for being here.

02:19:08.884 --> 02:19:11.986
Don't let the health freedom movement be a joke on our grandkids.

02:19:12.066 --> 02:19:14.628
Please don't let it be a joke on our grandkids.

02:19:14.748 --> 02:19:16.189
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:19:16.229 --> 02:19:19.291
Transfection was a crime and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:19:19.311 --> 02:19:19.631
The U.S.

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.493
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

02:19:24.674 --> 02:19:24.894
Thank you.

02:19:24.914 --> 02:19:26.856
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:19:26.916 --> 02:19:28.437
I'll see you again probably tomorrow.
