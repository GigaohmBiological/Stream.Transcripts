WEBVTT

00:42.817 --> 00:42.878
you

01:35.143 --> 01:42.285
This is so crazy I feel so nervous like what in the world man

02:07.386 --> 02:10.592
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:10.872 --> 02:11.653
Stop lying!

02:34.238 --> 02:41.283
the masks or behind, you know, proper testing or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right?

02:41.323 --> 02:43.344
This technology that has never been used widely.

02:43.865 --> 02:45.706
None of that is over.

02:45.806 --> 02:49.108
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were

02:50.149 --> 02:54.130
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

02:54.390 --> 02:57.031
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.672
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

03:01.732 --> 03:04.792
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

03:06.153 --> 03:13.814
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

03:14.275 --> 03:15.715
All of that was on a global basis.

03:20.058 --> 03:21.559
But you can tell if someone's lying.

03:22.199 --> 03:23.981
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:25.782 --> 03:26.462
And I have lied.

03:26.482 --> 03:27.543
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:27.563 --> 03:28.503
I don't want to lie.

03:28.984 --> 03:30.325
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:30.445 --> 03:31.485
I try not to be a liar.

03:31.505 --> 03:32.346
I don't want to be a liar.

03:32.906 --> 03:35.628
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

03:49.031 --> 03:50.112
I think truth is good for kids.

03:51.013 --> 03:54.676
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth of morning exercise.

03:55.337 --> 03:56.878
We want everybody to feel good.

03:56.898 --> 03:59.160
That's not the way life is.

04:50.385 --> 05:10.558
introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:10.578 --> 05:14.821
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

05:16.198 --> 05:21.782
that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

05:22.023 --> 05:28.167
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

05:28.207 --> 05:33.771
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

05:34.472 --> 05:42.758
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

05:44.279 --> 05:57.167
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

05:58.468 --> 06:08.455
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others

06:09.773 --> 06:17.815
in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain of function science.

06:28.657 --> 06:32.798
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

06:34.118 --> 06:38.239
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

06:43.302 --> 06:56.208
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

06:56.308 --> 07:01.830
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.071
It's just a big hassle in the end.

07:06.101 --> 07:20.426
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

07:20.486 --> 07:22.307
It'll be a moral emergency.

07:22.327 --> 07:34.471
Stop lying!

07:40.199 --> 07:43.341
Just it's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

07:44.382 --> 07:47.924
Just it's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

07:49.125 --> 07:53.247
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:53.267 --> 07:57.950
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:00.732 --> 08:04.715
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

08:04.935 --> 08:06.497
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

08:06.517 --> 08:07.197
Thank you very much.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.458
Can you hear me better now or not?

08:08.819 --> 08:09.679
Yes, much better.

08:10.420 --> 08:18.887
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

08:19.167 --> 08:22.730
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.430
Stop lying!

08:23.450 --> 08:27.934
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

08:29.244 --> 08:33.367
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

08:38.029 --> 08:44.433
Of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic.

08:44.534 --> 08:47.355
There was no pandemic and there will be no pandemic.

08:51.212 --> 08:54.515
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.215
It can't.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.579
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

08:59.599 --> 09:04.683
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

09:10.707 --> 09:13.850
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

09:13.870 --> 09:16.152
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

09:18.133 --> 09:18.554
Isolation?

09:18.574 --> 09:18.934
What was that?

09:19.054 --> 09:20.295
Isolation and purification.

09:22.003 --> 09:22.703
of the virus?

09:24.264 --> 09:35.306
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

09:35.966 --> 09:40.847
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

09:41.628 --> 09:43.128
I don't understand what the issue.

09:43.148 --> 09:43.288
I see.

09:43.308 --> 09:44.428
No, it depends on how they use it.

09:51.917 --> 09:52.117
Okay.

09:52.977 --> 09:55.799
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

09:58.300 --> 10:00.261
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

10:00.321 --> 10:06.343
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

10:06.423 --> 10:08.444
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

10:21.505 --> 10:24.266
He is the life of parties he has never attended.

10:26.466 --> 10:30.547
If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.428
When in Rome, they do as he does.

10:36.089 --> 10:38.949
He is the most interesting man in the world.

10:41.590 --> 10:47.351
I don't always ruin things, but when I do, I prefer the great reset.

10:48.392 --> 10:49.932
Stay awake, my friends.

11:11.189 --> 11:20.032
the specializations should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

11:20.452 --> 11:22.412
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

11:22.452 --> 11:25.573
And that's, that's a, that's sort of my starting, my starting bias.

11:57.557 --> 11:58.818
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

11:58.858 --> 12:04.342
Welcome to Giga Home Biological, the high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

12:04.402 --> 12:12.928
I'm happy to be here talking about the truth of the Scooby-Doo and how we were fooled into solving their mystery and accepting all of their monsters.

12:13.888 --> 12:19.753
This is something that I've been trying to get across for the last five years as it's become more and more clear to me what happened.

12:20.733 --> 12:23.116
I have a website, gigaohmbiological.com.

12:23.196 --> 12:26.739
I have a PeerTube instance, stream.gigaohm.bio.

12:27.219 --> 12:30.663
And I have a Soapbox instance, which is gigaohm.bio.

12:31.063 --> 12:33.105
And you can connect with us on all of those places.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.928
Facebook sucks, but you can also call a number.

12:36.648 --> 12:38.789
and leave a voicemail if you so desire.

12:38.809 --> 12:40.410
I don't know what just happened there.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.971
It's almost like that went on a little quick.

12:43.431 --> 12:46.213
But we also watch Giga Home Biological.

12:46.613 --> 12:50.314
I was really watching Housatonic ITS, Housatonic Live a lot.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.375
His work is spectacular.

12:52.876 --> 12:55.617
His website is spectacular.

12:55.977 --> 12:57.538
There's another guy that I like a lot.

12:58.418 --> 12:59.939
His artistry is pretty

13:00.599 --> 13:28.498
funny He does things to support our work and our message and I can't thank Ned enough So I got to recommend his sub stack to you Gain of function is a mythology that they still need us to teach our kids and very specifically the clowns on X need us to Yes, you do you need to call and you need to leave a voicemail that I can play at the beginning of the

13:29.298 --> 13:30.199
the show.

13:30.859 --> 13:32.981
They need us to teach this to our kids yet.

13:33.121 --> 13:33.802
It's not over.

13:34.402 --> 13:35.263
It's not over.

13:35.343 --> 13:44.771
They need us to be teaching this fear to our kids and it is actually knowledge that will dispel this enchantment.

13:45.431 --> 13:47.273
Knowledge about how social media works.

13:47.353 --> 13:49.735
Knowledge about biology.

13:50.776 --> 13:52.117
And that's what we're trying to do.

13:52.217 --> 13:55.800
Trying to be like Galileo here and just call him like we see him.

13:56.801 --> 13:58.022
I'm not using a telescope.

13:58.102 --> 14:00.384
I used a microscope for a very long time.

14:00.824 --> 14:05.108
And we definitely live in interesting times where your consciousness is prime real estate.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.991
And it doesn't really matter what is true.

14:08.651 --> 14:11.073
It matters what is perceived to be true.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.116
And that's the magic of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:14.176 --> 14:20.161
and Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker, these traders that have been masquerading as

14:21.422 --> 14:29.748
As heroes for so long, your consciousness is the prime real estate that they've been occupying for a long, long time with their bullshit story.

14:30.669 --> 14:45.479
And as they've been running you to the exits, none of these people seem to be able to say that the protocols were manslaughter, that gain of function is a mythology, that the Scooby-Doo mystery that was laid down before us is real.

14:46.465 --> 14:53.429
They don't seem to be able to say it because they have a spectacular commitment to the lies, to the script that they have been provided.

14:54.089 --> 14:58.032
And that is all that's required is that spectacular commitment to the lies.

14:59.052 --> 15:12.400
Um, and the lies include not talking about the fact that supplementary oxygen causes ARDS, not talking about the fact that virology is essentially just synthetic DNA and RNA applied to cell culture and animals.

15:13.726 --> 15:32.827
It's never saying, despite being really impressive former pharmaceutical executives, they don't seem to be able to realize that placebo batches being distributed would be the easiest way both to greatly decrease what would have been very much expected

15:34.549 --> 15:40.351
sort of damage done by transfection, you just fix that by distributing placebos.

15:40.391 --> 15:48.314
But more importantly, you can get everybody in on the gag because the vast majority of people will have taken a shot and not felt anything.

15:49.135 --> 16:00.079
This is the reality, and the reality is that all of this theater is designed to make you not understand what I mean by intramuscular injection is just plain dumb.

16:00.839 --> 16:06.262
For a very long time, people have been trying to tell me that that's just too mean, that's too ugly, that doesn't make any sense.

16:06.322 --> 16:07.302
Why say it like that?

16:07.943 --> 16:10.504
When in reality, that is the heart of the narrative.

16:10.544 --> 16:12.665
Intramuscular injection's just plain dumb.

16:13.246 --> 16:19.709
And so they've used weaponized piles of money to pay people to go on social media to convince us to argue about the origins of the virus.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.690
That's the Scooby-Doo.

16:21.450 --> 16:25.552
And participating in that argument accepts the premise of the novel virus by default.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.374
And we are governed by the same theater.

16:29.445 --> 16:34.109
But it spans from mainstream media to social media platforms to all sides of the mythology.

16:34.669 --> 16:46.920
And it may be that many of the people that participated on any given side of these mythologies are actually unwitting participants because they have convinced themselves or other people have convinced them that they're smart and they've figured it out.

16:46.980 --> 16:47.881
That's where I was.

16:47.921 --> 16:49.282
You can tell if someone's lying.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.423
That's where they were trying to get me.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.684
You can sort of feel it in people.

16:53.466 --> 16:54.506
All these liars.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.247
I'll lie again.

16:55.267 --> 16:56.168
I don't want to lie.

16:57.979 --> 16:58.800
All these liars.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.662
Can you hear that air conditioner in the background?

17:00.722 --> 17:01.683
I apologize for that.

17:02.324 --> 17:02.965
All these liars.

17:03.025 --> 17:11.655
Mary Holland, Robert Malone, Jayantabadacharya, Brian Hooker, Kevin McKernan, Nick Hudson, Jessica Rose, Mike Eden.

17:12.256 --> 17:14.678
And Mike Eden is a really interesting fella.

17:15.779 --> 17:17.740
I find him very, very interesting.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.922
He's one of those guys, I don't think my slideshow is cooperating with me.

17:22.962 --> 17:27.684
Let me read that list just one more time about the illusion of consensus.

17:28.144 --> 17:32.106
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

17:32.646 --> 17:35.227
You can't hear the glory, you can't hear the music.

17:35.307 --> 17:38.428
I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar.

17:38.568 --> 17:40.389
I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar.

17:40.549 --> 17:46.033
The provided script was stuck to, they all had faith in the provided script.

17:46.173 --> 17:58.982
Even Mary Holland, and Robert Malone, and Jayanta Bhattacharya, and Brian Hooker, they all had trust in the script that was gonna get RFK into the White House, that was gonna, I don't know, change the world somehow.

18:00.063 --> 18:05.607
And Nick Hudson, and Jessica Rose, and Mike Yeadon, oh my gosh, Mike Yeadon.

18:06.147 --> 18:08.629
He's one of these guys that's very hard to detect.

18:09.329 --> 18:15.481
It's taken me five years to figure out what exactly his script was and why his script is essentially useless.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.210
And it really took his, his unwavering commitment.

18:20.956 --> 18:23.858
to Sasha Latapova, the mother of Soph.

18:24.178 --> 18:45.230
Soph being this obnoxious, underage girl before the pandemic who was promoted by none other than Alex Jones three times in 2019 as some kind of dissident who was unfairly blamed for threatening to kill the YouTube CEO or something like that.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.472
A million subscribers on YouTube before the pandemic lost.

18:49.452 --> 19:03.933
um somehow or another we're supposed to believe that Sasha Latapova is the as the mother of Soph is some kind of good guy um even though her daughter's activity on the internet before that was absurd and now Mike Eden like

19:04.614 --> 19:18.406
like CHD, and like Epoch Times, and like Mary Holland, and Meryl Nass, and Pauly Tommy, who've all done long podcasts with Sasha Latupova and promoted her on stage, even been on stage with her.

19:18.866 --> 19:29.796
The first time that I ever saw her on stage with anybody was in January of 2023 with Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and this clown, Asim Malhotra.

19:30.743 --> 19:38.654
And now Mike Eden is insistent that this woman is one of the few heroes worth mentioning if he's going to make a five-minute video.

19:38.974 --> 19:45.162
And I just think it's hilarious, because he has revealed himself as the meddler

19:45.763 --> 20:04.327
the the scripted fool on Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's script and so like like everybody else he is the bait on social media that's why a lot of the videos of of Mike Eden aka Mr. Sparkle oh that that was missing a video um you got to understand why

20:05.796 --> 20:07.958
The cheese is free on social media.

20:09.539 --> 20:12.522
If you don't understand why the cheese... Come on now.

20:13.343 --> 20:19.768
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, then you're not gonna get... Look at how it does that to me.

20:20.289 --> 20:20.649
Darn it.

20:21.110 --> 20:21.430
There we go.

20:22.519 --> 20:24.540
And that's the only non-compliance that matters.

20:24.920 --> 20:32.244
They imagine that there's only one chance in history to collect this data, and so they're willing and ready to invert your sovereignty.

20:33.244 --> 20:44.489
And if you don't understand that they're using social media to do it, and you think a Democrat and Republicans and, you know, conservative and liberal, this is all something that matters, then you are a stooge.

20:44.569 --> 20:45.670
You are already caught.

20:48.327 --> 20:49.990
And so yes, please understand.

20:50.010 --> 20:55.138
This is a viewer supported stream If you want to leave a voicemail, there's the number

20:57.082 --> 20:58.423
And yeah, it's July 15th.

20:59.123 --> 21:00.324
It's remarkable.

21:00.364 --> 21:12.669
If you want a bumper sticker for your car or a tactical patch with Velcro backing that says Giga Ohm Biological and Biology is the way, please send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Dr. J at P.O.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.830
Box 802, Bethel Park, PA 15102.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.113
I am very, very excited.

21:20.133 --> 21:21.193
Did I already plug him?

21:21.253 --> 21:22.254
I'm gonna plug him again.

21:22.274 --> 21:28.837
Housatonicits.com is that home site where you can find all the research that he's done.

21:28.937 --> 21:34.199
And yes, biophenomenon at substack.com is also a dude that I want to promote.

21:34.239 --> 21:39.822
This is the one place where you can put some goggles on that will dispel all the myths.

21:40.923 --> 21:41.543
All the myths.

21:44.454 --> 21:46.234
All the myths will be dispelled here.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.475
We're not playing anymore.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.595
Again, that P.O.

21:49.635 --> 21:51.615
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102.

21:52.996 --> 21:59.457
You can also send, you know, support there if you want to, or fresh honey from your garden, or other stuff.

22:00.337 --> 22:02.697
Anyway, this is Giga Home Biological.

22:02.737 --> 22:04.518
This is where we stay focused on the biology.

22:04.558 --> 22:07.618
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

22:07.638 --> 22:10.259
Staying focused looks a lot like what this eagle does right there.

22:11.019 --> 22:12.960
Staying focused on the biology.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.321
Yes, that is it.

22:14.361 --> 22:15.441
Staying focused.

22:15.541 --> 22:17.963
I'm staying focused on biology.

22:18.143 --> 22:20.724
I'm staying focused on not taking the bait on social media.

22:20.764 --> 22:26.367
Trying to subvert social media with satire and bullshit because that's what it is.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.268
Those people are performing.

22:28.288 --> 22:30.509
There's no way for me to go viral on the internet.

22:30.549 --> 22:31.129
It doesn't matter.

22:31.209 --> 22:32.030
Stay focused!

22:32.890 --> 22:37.192
It doesn't matter what I do or what kind of stream I put together.

22:37.632 --> 22:39.393
Stay focused on the biology.

22:39.433 --> 22:40.094
It doesn't matter.

22:40.868 --> 22:46.869
Because I'm never gonna spontaneously rise with inside of this narrative because it's all fake.

22:47.770 --> 22:48.770
It's all fake.

22:48.830 --> 22:57.972
If I sit on this beach and wait for this wave to come, it still requires them to turn it on, otherwise there won't be a wave here for me to surf.

22:58.712 --> 23:02.573
And so as we teach our kids how to use social media,

23:04.793 --> 23:12.495
First and foremost, we need to teach them that it's an illusion, that it's an artificial wave that we're surfing, and that wave is carefully controlled.

23:12.515 --> 23:16.336
And if they want it to be too much for us, they can make it too much for us.

23:16.396 --> 23:20.697
If they want it to be that we can't keep our head above water, they can make it that way.

23:20.917 --> 23:26.038
And that's because if you go on social media as a skilled user, you can't stay focused.

23:26.698 --> 23:33.624
You can't not take their bait on social media and you can't love your neighbor if you're skillfully watching social media.

23:33.664 --> 23:34.604
That's really it.

23:36.086 --> 23:38.648
And so that's what Giga Home Biological is trying to change.

23:39.829 --> 23:41.750
Always trying to change that direction.

23:42.451 --> 23:43.312
Welcome to the show.

23:44.593 --> 23:45.253
Good to be here.

23:49.147 --> 23:52.768
Somebody said they can't hear the blower, so that's really great.

23:53.148 --> 23:54.709
I'm very happy to be here this morning.

23:54.769 --> 23:56.950
Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, wherever you are.

23:56.990 --> 24:01.231
It is 125 in the afternoon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

24:01.311 --> 24:02.852
Coming to you live from my garage again.

24:03.012 --> 24:07.913
As usual, as it says on my arm, I'm part of the Team USA.

24:07.993 --> 24:12.555
The goal is to wake America up to the illusion that we are, the spell that we are under.

24:13.115 --> 24:18.918
It is not as simple as saying it's a spell of red and blue or Democrat and Republican or a uniparty.

24:19.278 --> 24:34.205
It's more complicated than that because the spell that we're under is essentially a spell akin to a sci-fi movie where our understanding of physics and biology and chemistry is so distorted that we can't really process reality in a useful way.

24:34.545 --> 24:34.986
Plus,

24:35.882 --> 24:43.889
We're using social media as if it's some kind of, you know, spontaneous representation of our social reality, which it most certainly is not.

24:45.770 --> 24:54.577
So, any who... In addition, we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

24:54.818 --> 25:00.903
So the idea is, is that of course we're trying to dispel some fundamental myths that

25:01.991 --> 25:09.496
you know, come from Western culture have been codified essentially in the teachings of Western culture.

25:09.516 --> 25:10.556
And we need to get over that.

25:10.696 --> 25:12.157
I don't know why that went on its own.

25:12.217 --> 25:13.498
I guess it's got a timer there.

25:14.599 --> 25:25.865
But the point is that autism spectrum disorder is a myth and it's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, even though it's a dumb idea from the 1800s.

25:26.466 --> 25:31.289
It's make sure that virology is never questioned as a science, even though it can be simply debunked

25:31.829 --> 25:38.970
has transfection and transformation using DNA and RNA in cell culture in animals, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

25:39.491 --> 25:45.552
That's the same reason why they use pandemics and gain-of-function, to make sure that these things can never be questioned.

25:45.592 --> 25:46.572
It's coercion.

25:47.272 --> 25:55.614
It's coercion by coordinated liars on social media and in the mainstream media for more than a couple generations now.

25:56.499 --> 25:57.960
Fourth turning my ass.

25:58.461 --> 26:06.067
For the last four turnings, intramuscular injection as medicine has been considered some kind of good idea, even though it's not.

26:07.548 --> 26:23.582
And for about four turnings, autism spectrum disorder and pandemics have been stories that they've not told us were myths, but told us are the foundations of public health and the reason why national governments are kind of, you know, I don't know, they're a little bit obsolete.

26:26.152 --> 26:44.425
We are in a very dangerous place, ladies and gentlemen, because this illusion of a health freedom movement is there very specifically to protect this, to make sure to coerce us into teaching this to our kids and not teaching our kids that this is actually evidence of manslaughter.

26:48.223 --> 26:50.184
And that's how they maintain it.

26:50.284 --> 27:03.771
And they will continue to maintain this illusion on a provided script, maintaining this illusion for the old people with too much time on their hands, the old people who need to be convinced that some skepticism of the vaccine is warranted.

27:06.286 --> 27:22.653
for the vulnerable middle-aged people who, for whatever reason, find themselves feeling conservative but can't find a home in a church or in a community or in some kind of organization around their hometown.

27:23.334 --> 27:32.758
And so find themselves inevitably using social media as skillfully as possible to try and find that conservative movement in America and have stumbled into this bullshit show.

27:35.350 --> 27:37.770
That's really what happened at the beginning of the pandemic.

27:37.810 --> 27:47.072
And these coordinated lies told by coordinated liars who all trust in the script, they're the trap that we fell into.

27:47.212 --> 27:51.553
And we fell into the trap very specifically because we thought we could argue with them.

27:52.213 --> 27:58.594
I thought I could argue with them and I could convince them that their script wasn't quite right, that their idea wasn't quite right.

27:58.614 --> 28:02.115
You know, where you hear Jessica Rose says, I really think that's what happened.

28:02.395 --> 28:03.095
Stop lying.

28:05.472 --> 28:06.915
And so that's the issue here.

28:07.296 --> 28:13.530
These actors were put in place to curate that narrative to make sure that nobody asked any useful questions.

28:15.026 --> 28:19.209
that nobody ever realized that these could have been called transfection from the very beginning.

28:19.229 --> 28:31.178
And that would have been much closer to implying some kind of effort toward informed consent, but it would have also revealed his resume as just having been about transfection for 20 years.

28:31.658 --> 28:36.302
And it could be instead blamed effectively on the spike protein of the novel virus.

28:36.362 --> 28:41.726
And that's why so many of these clown shows were revolving around the spike protein

28:42.246 --> 28:53.011
and its gain-of-function, you know, additions, its specific sequence, and its homologies with all kinds of scary things that meant that the spike protein should never be inside of the shot.

28:54.452 --> 29:09.599
And now, of course, we've added an extra layer with some of the worst actors here, including Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose, where they're trying to say that the shots might have been okay if they wouldn't have been so doggone, uh, so doggone contaminated with SV40.

29:13.168 --> 29:23.583
And so they maintain this illusion of consensus by sticking to the provided script, and more importantly, sticking to the, maybe as importantly, provided cast list.

29:24.324 --> 29:27.228
Jessica Rose is never going to say my name again.

29:28.710 --> 29:34.812
None of them will ever say it again, even though they got together, sometimes in groups of five, to discuss who I was.

29:35.372 --> 29:36.813
They will never say it again.

29:36.973 --> 29:46.115
Just because they organized a Steve Courage steering committee and then pretended that I was being added to it doesn't mean that these people are done.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.196
It just means that they'll never do it again.

29:50.100 --> 30:00.126
Just because I've been in a signal chat with like five of these people at a time over the course of five years, and it's always the same show, doesn't mean they're gonna do it anymore, but they definitely all did it.

30:01.647 --> 30:13.955
And that's what makes Mike Eden such a particularly lame player in this, because as he sticks to this provided script, the question is, will we be able to see the provided script?

30:14.015 --> 30:17.177
Because the lioness of Judah ministry

30:18.391 --> 30:25.701
On Substack, you know, Substack, that place where the truth is getting out with anonymous Substacks, right?

30:25.801 --> 30:30.007
Like the one we looked at the other day with Sasha or the one before that we looked at with Sasha.

30:30.627 --> 30:31.228
This is now

30:32.409 --> 30:36.211
An anonymous substack who's been exposing the darkness.

30:36.851 --> 30:37.531
Stop lying!

30:38.272 --> 30:47.096
And now this is a promotion of a one-time recording for Mike Yeadon.

30:47.116 --> 30:52.779
And let's see, let's just take notes and try to understand what it is that Mike Yeadon says.

30:53.579 --> 31:01.387
And let's decide on our own whether he's full of shit, or whether he's a scripted fool, or what his deal is.

31:01.467 --> 31:05.451
And first of all, keep in mind that there's lots of people he could name.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.115
He could say Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:09.175 --> 31:10.917
He could say Jayantabadacharya.

31:10.957 --> 31:14.140
He could say Thomas Binder, who he was on a paper with.

31:15.689 --> 31:17.670
in 2020 about the PCR test.

31:17.690 --> 31:25.852
He could say Kevin McKernan or Claire Craig because he was also on the paper with Claire Craig and Kevin McKernan at the beginning of the pandemic.

31:25.892 --> 31:28.853
He could say those names, but he's not gonna.

31:29.453 --> 31:30.253
And that's strange.

31:31.273 --> 31:32.354
Hey, who are you?

31:33.034 --> 31:34.194
Who is this guy over here?

31:34.674 --> 31:35.894
Who is this dude down here?

31:36.435 --> 31:37.135
My little Mikey.

31:38.455 --> 31:40.136
You coming in here to check on me again, bud?

31:40.976 --> 31:41.376
That's good.

31:42.073 --> 31:43.314
It's better when the doors open, huh?

31:43.354 --> 31:44.675
Then you can come in whenever you want to.

31:44.695 --> 31:45.756
You don't have to be so worried.

31:46.436 --> 31:46.616
Yeah.

31:47.337 --> 31:47.557
Okay.

31:47.937 --> 31:48.678
I got to keep working.

31:49.298 --> 31:49.899
You're a good boy.

31:52.601 --> 31:54.262
So let's get on with this.

31:57.064 --> 31:57.905
I'm worried about it.

31:57.945 --> 32:00.427
I got to tell you because I think this is the illusion.

32:01.307 --> 32:04.250
I think the illusion is that's how they're hiding the murder.

32:05.250 --> 32:09.892
you know, root for him, 5-D chess, Donald Trump played the same role.

32:10.332 --> 32:18.835
And unfortunately, the ghost of health freedom is also manifest in Mike Eden's really shitty performance over the last five years.

32:18.896 --> 32:29.640
Essentially, Mike Eden has shown no progress, you know, just like we have now, this video I showed you the other day of... The head will not be easy.

32:30.996 --> 32:35.559
I can attest personally that in my work as the Director of National Intelligence.

32:35.579 --> 32:41.343
There's no way that Tulsi Gabbard is the Director of National Intelligence of America and America is not collapsing.

32:42.023 --> 32:48.928
There's no way that this is not being burnt down from the inside of that chick who was on the Joe Rogan podcast.

32:48.968 --> 32:59.715
That Hindu is our Director of National Intelligence and is communicating with America directly, with the American public directly, with a YouTube channel.

33:00.580 --> 33:02.686
She's a surfer like Jessica Rose.

33:07.614 --> 33:16.499
So Suzanne is another one of these really shitty players who's clearly on a script because for the last 15 years she hasn't learned anything and hasn't been able to progress.

33:16.539 --> 33:30.788
And in fact, this fraud used to say it very clearly back when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were alive, just like, apparently, Del Bigtree used to say it very clearly back when Tony Bark

33:31.408 --> 33:37.894
and Brandy Vaughn were alive because he said that, you know, we just kill kids with the vaccine schedule and that's okay.

33:37.914 --> 33:40.857
We just paralyze kids with the vaccine schedule and that's okay.

33:41.197 --> 33:50.346
And this chick said that she didn't think a safe vaccine was possible because it was antithetical to, or it goes against everything we know about our biology.

33:50.406 --> 33:51.667
So if that's the case in 2017,

33:53.869 --> 34:12.584
Before Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark die in 2020, and now after they're dead, Brian Hooker and Suzanne Humphries and Mary Holland and all these other shitheads can't say it anymore, Dell Bigtree, then what do we have here other than traitors who are spectacularly committed to a lie?

34:12.985 --> 34:15.547
And I don't know, do they have a gun to their head?

34:15.947 --> 34:16.728
It doesn't matter.

34:17.829 --> 34:21.772
If they have a gun to their head, then they should have stepped out of the spotlight already by now.

34:21.832 --> 34:23.133
They should have done known better.

34:26.243 --> 34:27.524
The same with these people.

34:27.945 --> 34:30.027
Jessica Rose belongs in jail.

34:30.547 --> 34:35.252
Jessica Rose is one of the worst young adults alive under 50.

34:37.134 --> 34:47.104
And this scripted bullshit about contamination and genetic integration that both of these jackasses are selling on Substack is traitorous to our grandchildren.

34:48.593 --> 35:00.404
and really misrepresenting the fact that transfection in all of its forms, even the best one, the theoretically best one, would have been treacherous and terrible for healthy people.

35:02.026 --> 35:04.308
Seriously, these people belong in jail.

35:08.203 --> 35:24.936
This guy is also a scripted fraud with a foreign passport who was my friend for three years and tried to get me to stop talking about the traitorous Robert Malone, the one providing these people with the script that is going to destroy the FDA from within, going to undermine the U.S.

35:24.996 --> 35:35.844
government as swiftly as possible, in the worst way possible, using the biggest budgets available to suck the U.S.

35:35.884 --> 35:36.725
government dry.

35:38.032 --> 35:42.493
Think about that, HHS, FDA, NHS.

35:43.813 --> 35:45.394
They can shift a lot of money around.

35:47.494 --> 35:50.935
It's scripted bullshit about publishing fees and open science.

35:51.035 --> 35:56.676
This guy's a clown and they've taken him out of the Sunday circuit because he's a clown.

35:57.317 --> 35:59.077
And because I have those selfies.

36:01.089 --> 36:04.191
I put one of them at the top of my Twitter feed because it's just bullshit.

36:04.231 --> 36:08.494
These people are liars, scripted liars.

36:08.634 --> 36:22.783
This clown show, Peter McCullough here, who one time in 2022 said that he didn't think he would ever use the vaccine schedule if he could do it all over again, and then he never said it again.

36:23.464 --> 36:26.526
Then he never said it again.

36:28.988 --> 36:31.569
And that's because he is scripted bullshit, okay?

36:31.989 --> 36:36.612
He is scripted frickin' bullshit about the gain of function spike protein.

36:38.472 --> 36:39.513
So here's Mike Eden.

36:40.734 --> 36:41.694
And it ain't gonna be pretty.

36:41.714 --> 36:42.735
You're not gonna be happy.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.556
And I'm gonna have to stop it a lot to point out what...

36:46.795 --> 36:49.317
how ridiculous it is, okay?

36:49.497 --> 36:52.078
It's absurd how awful it is.

36:52.518 --> 36:57.341
And it's unfortunate, but Mike Yeaton probably belongs in some jail.

36:57.401 --> 36:58.202
I don't know which one.

36:59.183 --> 37:09.048
I will credit the terrific work of two Americans, Sasha Latipova, L-A-T-Y-P-O-V-A.

37:09.369 --> 37:12.911
So imagine that he's actually spelling her last name.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.515
Think about how much of a bitch that makes him.

37:19.417 --> 37:20.978
He's just Robert Malone's bitch.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.542
Here, read this name and spell it out.

37:25.762 --> 37:28.064
Sasha Latipova.

37:30.466 --> 37:33.348
The abusive mother of Sof?

37:34.704 --> 37:39.067
Because when Soph was underage, she was making shitty videos.

37:39.207 --> 37:48.474
And the worst part is, it seems like Sasha Latupova took advantage of the fact that her daughter looked like a little baby girl, like a toddler when she was a teenager.

37:49.654 --> 37:53.917
You know, like a really well-spoken little 10-year-old when she was 14.

37:55.098 --> 38:00.482
And so her family, apparently Sasha Latupova, took advantage of that.

38:03.058 --> 38:14.884
And a few years later, Soph had a million followers on YouTube and then was threatening to shoot the YouTube CEO and was telling UK people to go get guns and go shoot their cops.

38:16.264 --> 38:30.051
And later, during the pandemic, made a video with her mom at a gun range talking about shooting Joe Biden and recruiting somebody to shoot Donald Trump about a half a year before Donald Trump was indeed shot by somebody from my son's high school.

38:31.311 --> 38:32.612
Fuck off, Mike Eden.

38:33.902 --> 38:35.062
You're a piece of shit.

38:36.503 --> 38:38.004
And you know you're on a script.

38:38.564 --> 38:59.953
You know because you've communicated with me over these last four years, and gone farther and farther away from saying anything meaningful, and gone further and further to promoting these shitheads, from the no-virus people like Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan, and the Baileys in New Zealand, now to Sasha Latipova, the mother of Soph.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.056
And you start by spelling her name.

39:06.061 --> 39:07.304
Grab your ankles, Mike.

39:08.006 --> 39:09.028
I hope you got lube.

39:09.645 --> 39:13.669
Asha Latipova, like me, a retired pharma executive.

39:13.709 --> 39:14.890
She worked in development.

39:14.990 --> 39:18.192
I was in... Like him, a retired pharma exec.

39:18.252 --> 39:21.595
Like Jonathan Engler, a retired pharma exec.

39:21.635 --> 39:24.057
Like Robert Malone, a pharma exec.

39:24.498 --> 39:31.364
Just like all of these people who knew at the beginning of the pandemic that this was called transformation or transfection.

39:33.567 --> 39:39.410
And they knew that it could never be made pure using the manufacturing techniques that involved recombinant DNA.

39:39.950 --> 39:44.673
And they know that because that's how protein biologics have been made for the last 20 years.

39:45.093 --> 40:00.781
And so McKernan, and Claire Craig, and Jessica Rose, and Jonathan Engler, and all these people like Mike Eden, and Sasha Latupova, and Robert Malone, who all have ties directly to a career in pharmaceuticals, cannot have known.

40:03.103 --> 40:07.369
that this would maybe be okay, that maybe, they had to know.

40:07.969 --> 40:14.057
They had to know that this was gonna be shit, and they knew it from the very beginning, but Mike Eden spent 2020.

40:17.034 --> 40:34.061
Mike Yeadon spent 2020 telling us about natural immunity, telling us about previous immunity, and overlapping immunity with overlapping epitopes from previous respiratory viruses because he's a respiratory physiologist who used to work for Pfizer.

40:34.501 --> 40:35.241
Stop lying!

40:36.101 --> 40:37.442
Stop lying!

40:37.722 --> 40:39.903
Mike Yeadon is a scripted fraud.

40:40.854 --> 40:47.639
And he has stuck to the script, and Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Claire Craig, and whoever else is on this script.

40:48.319 --> 40:54.103
And you can see it because he was on the very first paper that they also put Thomas Binder on, one of the only good guys on Earth.

40:55.578 --> 41:03.224
And I think that Mike Eden and Claire Craig and Kevin McKernan were all put on that paper with Thomas Binder.

41:03.324 --> 41:12.652
One of the main reasons was to rope Thomas Binder into this pseudo-intellectual group to make sure that they could always step in front of him on social media if they needed to.

41:13.939 --> 41:29.410
That's what Mike Eden is doing right now, but he's trying really desperately to get out of the spotlight by saying, I gotta credit Sasha LaTupova and Catherine Watt, because these two Americans are frickin' geniuses, and they pretty much summarize it better than I even could.

41:30.526 --> 41:45.116
He is a scripted fraud who's taking it for the team right now and trying desperately to finally take his curtain call and get out of the spotlight by passing it to these two shitheads who have no answer.

41:47.358 --> 41:48.959
Who have no answer.

41:48.999 --> 41:52.241
It's just that the militaries around the world are doing it.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.262
Right, Mary Holland?

41:53.662 --> 41:57.005
It was a global military operation like Satchelatopoulos said.

41:57.924 --> 42:00.725
Even Mary Holland of CHD.

42:01.225 --> 42:03.106
Even Meryl Nass of CHD.

42:03.286 --> 42:06.507
Even the Defender podcast hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:06.587 --> 42:11.269
featured, for an hour, Sasha the Fraud Latipova.

42:15.230 --> 42:18.311
Even Epoch Times featured her as a thought leader.

42:18.351 --> 42:23.753
You know, the equivalent of, like, Robert Malone and Steve Bannon and all these other thought leaders.

42:26.443 --> 42:34.361
America is under attack and it is by a globally distributed group of scripted liars.

42:35.481 --> 42:41.063
And one of the shittiest ones is this guy because he's a great sympathy getter.

42:41.603 --> 42:48.264
He was really good at it, being like, I'm the one who gave up the most because I had to move to Cyprus to my third house.

42:48.324 --> 42:57.407
And I've been living in Cyprus because I'm so... I have to walk on the street to make talks into microphones with CHD on them.

42:58.382 --> 43:00.144
What a piece of shit you are, Mike.

43:00.344 --> 43:04.229
I mean, really, you are one of the biggest pieces of shit on earth.

43:04.609 --> 43:04.949
Research.

43:05.890 --> 43:11.156
And a legal scholar called Catherine, with a K, Watts.

43:11.477 --> 43:13.699
Catherine Watts, W-A-T-T.

43:14.440 --> 43:18.645
They write on the sub stack, they have uncovered the fact that

43:19.325 --> 43:20.125
The facts!

43:20.245 --> 43:25.987
And they write on Substack because again, remember, he is a whore.

43:26.608 --> 43:33.290
And so he is whoring for Substack and he is whoring for X. Because that's what they do.

43:33.930 --> 43:45.094
They sell themselves, they sell their name, they allow their name to be used on social media, they allow their name and their image to be used on Substack and elsewhere because they are whores.

43:45.654 --> 43:46.735
Whores on a script.

43:47.395 --> 43:51.357
Mike Eden, you are a tragic, tragic man.

43:52.117 --> 44:05.323
And I hope you live the rest of your life knowing that most earthlings, most humans, and any dog that will listen to my stream is gonna know how much of a piece of shit liar you are.

44:06.511 --> 44:13.455
Vaccines have never been intended to reduce diseases or to help you.

44:13.495 --> 44:22.540
They have always been what I have determined the Covid shots to be, which is materials that harm you and do you no good.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.262
So think about how shitty that is!

44:26.701 --> 44:29.242
How shitty of a statement that is.

44:29.282 --> 44:35.244
He warmed this up, he got the camera ready, he decided what he was gonna do, and then he cut this, and this is the one.

44:35.724 --> 44:38.165
Sasha Latupova, spell her name.

44:38.505 --> 44:40.845
Catherine Watt, spell her name.

44:40.885 --> 44:46.267
And now I think that, you know, all vaccines are what I determined the COVID shots to be.

44:46.787 --> 44:49.108
Stuff that's not intended to save you.

44:50.896 --> 45:02.319
Think about how ridiculous it is that right over there, right just over the edge of this screen, is a slide that says intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the 1800s.

45:02.399 --> 45:04.720
And this guy can't say it.

45:05.060 --> 45:07.000
He specifically will not say it.

45:07.140 --> 45:10.261
Instead, he uses the word vaccine repeatedly.

45:10.761 --> 45:13.642
And he says that the stuff in vaccines isn't that good.

45:16.994 --> 45:21.017
Think about how much of a fuckwit this guy is for going along with this script.

45:26.142 --> 45:30.346
And of course that's so horrifying that you think, oh my word, all of them?

45:30.486 --> 45:30.666
Yep.

45:31.126 --> 45:35.530
So all of them, all the way back to the 1800s when we were so stupid.

45:36.391 --> 45:37.392
You see the problem here?

45:38.345 --> 45:47.032
He's trying to make it seem like the government had this great big smart idea, and they were gonna control the population by injecting people with shit.

45:49.073 --> 45:49.894
That's wrong.

45:50.875 --> 45:51.736
That's wrong.

45:52.776 --> 46:00.442
Intramuscular injection started as a dumb idea, and at the time, that dumb idea stuck.

46:02.404 --> 46:03.665
And it's stuck to this day.

46:04.850 --> 46:09.652
And there may be very, very, very, very many people who are in place to make sure that it sticks.

46:10.252 --> 46:12.153
But I'm afraid that this is one of them.

46:13.193 --> 46:15.874
I'm afraid there's no other conclusion to come to.

46:16.354 --> 46:20.015
Because I've already told him that intramuscular injection is dumb.

46:20.075 --> 46:21.156
That's the way to say it.

46:22.896 --> 46:23.697
A couple years ago.

46:25.537 --> 46:26.278
You see the problem?

46:27.878 --> 46:29.339
It's not that I want credit.

46:29.519 --> 46:32.840
It's that I want somebody to actually score the touchdown.

46:33.831 --> 46:34.692
But they won't do it.

46:36.753 --> 46:40.776
They won't score the touchdown because he is a scripted player.

46:42.357 --> 46:48.581
And he's trying desperately to get out of the spotlight and hand it off to these two frauds who I've been on to since the very beginning.

46:48.621 --> 46:54.466
It could be that Catherine Watt is a well-intended legal scholar, but Sasha Latupov is a piece of shit.

46:55.322 --> 47:06.154
And she's an abusive mom, and the evidence of her being an abusive mom, in my humble opinion, is found all over the internet in the shitty videos that she made with her little girl.

47:07.435 --> 47:15.383
Sasha Latapova is such a piece of shit, that to think that this guy repeatedly, REPEATEDLY has promoted her.

47:16.212 --> 47:18.473
that makes him one of the worst people on the internet.

47:18.993 --> 47:32.259
And specifically a very anti-American person on the internet, which you can start to see a lot of these people actually are when they promote Sasha Latupova as like one of the best people with the real facts.

47:33.299 --> 47:33.960
Stop lying!

47:38.278 --> 47:42.981
I'm not saying they're all as dangerous as COVID jabs, but none of them were good.

47:43.721 --> 47:47.983
And rather than trusting me going... They're not as dangerous as the COVID jabs.

47:48.063 --> 47:49.144
Well, that's interesting.

47:49.164 --> 47:50.365
Can you explain why?

47:52.972 --> 47:56.614
I might tend to agree with that statement, but could you explain why, Mike?

47:56.674 --> 48:01.597
Could you use any depth of understanding at all, or not really?

48:01.897 --> 48:07.480
Read the work of Sasha Latipova and Catherine Watt, and then it's up to you to decide.

48:07.820 --> 48:19.666
Oh, just read, let me say their names again, and then you just read their work, and then you decide what a fuck, what an absolute piece of shit you are, Mike.

48:23.078 --> 48:46.947
like really don't don't even show your face in public i mean really you're just you're just the worst kind of man and a fraud because you're pretending to be telling everybody about digital id and about about whatever this and digital currency when you know you're just making an announcement you know that those two things are inevitable you know that

48:48.306 --> 48:56.373
that digital ID to travel and digital ID to use the internet, at least on certain platforms, is inevitable.

48:56.433 --> 48:57.014
You know that.

48:57.074 --> 49:02.078
That's why it's a very safe bullshit whine for you to make for the last five years.

49:02.218 --> 49:10.646
Start with natural immunity, talk about overlapping epitopes, and then pivot right away to, you know, it's going to cause the virus to be enriched.

49:10.686 --> 49:12.027
And by the way, I want freedom.

49:13.317 --> 49:15.958
I don't like digital currencies and digital IDs.

49:16.378 --> 49:18.199
He's a scripted traitor.

49:19.759 --> 49:21.620
It's just, it's just awful.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.841
It's pathetic when you see it now.

49:23.881 --> 49:24.521
We're in the middle of 2025.

49:24.781 --> 49:29.663
There's no excuse for this bullshit other than him being their whore.

49:31.324 --> 49:33.304
Okay, if you think that's wrong, that's fine.

49:33.885 --> 49:40.707
But one thing Sasha and others discovered and they shared it with me before they even published it.

49:41.147 --> 49:42.928
And as soon as they told me, I knew it was right.

49:43.891 --> 49:53.219
Can you remember a time, those of you who are over 60, I'm nearly 65, can you remember a time when you were young, when very few people were allergic to peanuts?

49:53.459 --> 50:08.291
Now, interesting that he brings up the peanut allergy, because again, remember, there was a book by Heather Fraser called The History of the Peanut Allergy, and this book was released originally in 2010, and then again in, wait, is it even earlier?

50:14.284 --> 50:15.084
Maybe it's even earlier.

50:15.845 --> 50:17.985
I have them all in the row here.

50:20.466 --> 50:22.167
And then it got released in 2010.

50:22.587 --> 50:32.330
And then seven years later, Skyhorse Publishing, the publishing arm of CHD, put out another one with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:32.370 --> 50:33.131
in the forward.

50:33.871 --> 50:42.254
And so it's funny because, again, we're going to make this reference to a Nobel Prize winning

50:43.916 --> 50:57.105
I'm gonna make this reference to a Nobel Prize winning finding which was actually not discovered by Sasha and Catherine Watt, but was discovered and put forward by somebody else that Sasha Latupova stepped in front of.

50:57.606 --> 50:59.367
And that person is in contact with me.

50:59.407 --> 51:02.529
I won't say their name right now, but if they want me to, I definitely will.

51:03.490 --> 51:05.071
And so this is one of those things.

51:05.151 --> 51:08.133
And again, what we're looking for is precision.

51:10.146 --> 51:15.548
And what's coming now is a spectacular lack of precision.

51:16.528 --> 51:25.091
Because remember, he said just a minute ago that the old shots might not be as bad as the new shots, but it's all the same.

51:26.071 --> 51:27.231
And why is it all the same?

51:27.291 --> 51:29.372
It's the same because of this.

51:29.532 --> 51:30.332
Listen carefully.

51:31.693 --> 51:31.913
Oops.

51:34.394 --> 51:36.294
And very few people were allergic to anything.

51:36.434 --> 51:37.695
You probably can, can't you?

51:37.895 --> 51:38.695
Older folk like me.

51:40.219 --> 51:59.304
What we discovered is that if you inject a person with a foreign protein like peanut oil, if you inject a person with tiny doses of that, especially if you do it two or three times, that person becomes fiercely allergic for life to peanuts.

52:00.165 --> 52:08.847
Now, unfortunately for Mike, he's been given a shitty script and this shitty script doesn't have the history of that research.

52:10.609 --> 52:16.931
But the interesting thing, as far as I can tell, the research that he's talking about was subcutaneous injections.

52:20.293 --> 52:34.498
So once again, because his script is so shitty and because it's provided to him and he's required to trust it, he didn't do the requisite research to find out how this stuff was done that he's referring to, that he didn't even say the name of the guy yet.

52:36.079 --> 52:38.880
But they were all injections in the skin.

52:40.014 --> 52:44.576
which would sensitize these people to, and define what allergies were.

52:45.337 --> 52:47.718
They weren't injections into the muscle, dumbass.

52:49.059 --> 53:02.085
So once again, your script is shit, you're cooperating with anti-American traitors, and probably, essentially, you are a traitor to all the grandchildren of the West, all the grandchildren of Earth.

53:03.146 --> 53:04.506
That's who you are, Mike Eden.

53:04.727 --> 53:05.627
Congratulations.

53:06.327 --> 53:07.308
I hope it's paying well.

53:08.581 --> 53:18.343
Imagine if you were to inject a whey protein from milk in a tiny dose, so small that you probably wouldn't even notice it on the ingredients list.

53:19.083 --> 53:25.065
And if you injected that into your child a couple of times, when they grew up... Can you hear the imprecision?

53:25.845 --> 53:34.767
If you just inject, inject, inject, he's not talking with precision because he's trying to bamboozle you into believing that injection is injection is injection, but it's not.

53:35.697 --> 53:41.346
There are cutaneous injections, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections, and intramuscular injections.

53:41.867 --> 53:44.171
And intramuscular injections are the dumb idea.

53:44.291 --> 53:49.960
Intramuscular injections are the ones that they are using to get away with murder.

53:52.628 --> 53:57.953
And all the other ones, I don't know what they do, but they don't have the potential that intramuscular injection has.

53:58.093 --> 54:00.135
And that's the sad part.

54:00.255 --> 54:08.543
And now, what he's trying to do is convince you that actually the mechanism by which, and this is the most egregious error,

54:09.494 --> 54:18.837
in his script, the mechanism by which we are reacting to injection is the same across the board, whether it's the old stuff or the new stuff.

54:19.277 --> 54:22.518
And again, this lack of precision is scripted bullshit.

54:23.219 --> 54:26.160
And Mike Eden, you should really, you should really

54:27.390 --> 54:40.010
Suffer the rest of your life public shame because of you sticking to this script America and American kids are never going to forget your treachery I can assure you of that because you will be in my high school curriculum

54:40.640 --> 54:48.023
they might end up, not all of them, but many of them will grow up allergic to milk and milk products and anything that's got whey protein in it.

54:48.483 --> 54:54.165
Imagine if they injected you with a beef protein that came from plasma, for example.

54:54.265 --> 54:55.545
You often see that in products.

54:56.145 --> 55:05.069
A tiny dose, a really tiny dose, so small it'll be off the bottom of the ingredients list, and you injected that person twice with it, they'll become intolerant to meat.

55:06.209 --> 55:07.650
Unfortunately that is all true.

55:08.231 --> 55:17.720
All of those ingredients have been found in at least one of the vaccines on the vaccine schedule in America and they're pretty much global products.

55:19.141 --> 55:20.963
These diabolical people

55:21.331 --> 55:31.556
Now remember, one of the things that this diabolical asshole has never said for five years is that he's aware that the vaccine schedule in America is very much different than the rest of the West.

55:31.696 --> 55:41.140
In fact, so many of these mother effers have not said that, that it's got to be evidence for you by now, even if I'm just pointing it out for you occasionally.

55:41.980 --> 55:57.712
How is it possible that Mary Holland never makes that comparison between, for example, the way a vaccine schedule expresses itself in Norway or Sweden or the Netherlands versus how it expresses itself in American hospitals and HMOs.

55:57.812 --> 56:04.818
This kind of thing is such a low-hanging fruit for any of these people to pick off the tree and hit people in the heads with.

56:05.178 --> 56:09.922
It's just remarkable that for literally a decade and a half, nobody's able to do it.

56:10.842 --> 56:11.583
Stop lying!

56:15.025 --> 56:28.394
Have included components in the jabs that your children have been given and you may have received that were designed to sensitize you to every single basic food item.

56:28.734 --> 56:37.100
See, so now he's trying to say that they've had a plan where they've been trying to sensitize you to every single food item so that they don't have to... What?

56:38.100 --> 56:38.401
What?

56:39.469 --> 56:45.833
Now it's a diabolical plan where they've got a very carefully laid out objective where they're going to make everybody sensitive.

56:45.933 --> 56:49.755
What in the nine hells is this person talking about?

56:49.795 --> 56:52.637
Is this what Sasha Latipova and Catherine Watt taught him?

56:53.597 --> 56:54.638
Holy shit.

56:56.570 --> 57:01.513
you know, to wheat, to corn, to beef, to chicken, to milk.

57:02.294 --> 57:07.097
That's why the number of people, I think like one in three people has some kind of allergy.

57:07.117 --> 57:10.099
It's like, they didn't, when I was young, they didn't.

57:10.559 --> 57:20.786
Sasha Latipova was born in USSR, and as she said in her fruity Russian, did they just say her name again and say she was born in Russia?

57:21.627 --> 57:23.588
My God, what a joke.

57:24.853 --> 57:25.774
What a joke.

57:25.834 --> 57:27.056
I bet she was bored in Ukraine.

57:27.557 --> 57:29.900
She said, when I was young, no one had allergies.

57:30.721 --> 57:33.464
When she came to America, I think in the 80s, it was like, what again?

57:33.605 --> 57:37.370
When she came to America, I think it was in the 80s.

57:37.410 --> 57:38.491
Where did she come from?

57:38.511 --> 57:39.192
Ukraine?

57:39.813 --> 57:40.253
I don't know.

57:40.654 --> 57:41.575
Where did she come from?

57:41.735 --> 57:42.156
Ukraine?

57:42.376 --> 57:42.777
I don't know.

57:44.768 --> 57:49.630
And so she was probably perfectly poised to spot this, and so she discovered this.

57:49.950 --> 57:58.233
Perfectly poised to spot this while she was running her daughter for Alex Jones and whatever bullshit show he's a part of.

58:00.054 --> 58:00.774
Way to go, Mike.

58:01.674 --> 58:02.154
Way to go.

58:02.995 --> 58:04.095
You sold your soul.

58:05.035 --> 58:06.936
You slimy piece of shit.

58:08.110 --> 58:14.036
And she noticed that a scientist called, I think it was Charles Richet, something like that.

58:14.136 --> 58:14.336
Ha!

58:15.057 --> 58:16.018
She noticed!

58:16.698 --> 58:18.600
Wow, what a fraud she is.

58:18.840 --> 58:20.922
What a fraud she is.

58:21.022 --> 58:22.604
We could expose this if we wanted to.

58:22.644 --> 58:31.693
If you do research into when she started talking about Charles Richet, you will find a very, very big joke here because she's not the one who started talking about it.

58:31.753 --> 58:32.493
It's somebody else.

58:33.174 --> 58:39.357
who also has a substack, who's also trying to make a living, and who's also trying to say this, but it's not right.

58:40.658 --> 58:46.401
It's not right, because Charles Ruscha's work was largely subcutaneous and cutaneous injections.

58:46.441 --> 58:48.783
It wasn't intramuscular injections.

58:48.843 --> 58:50.784
It was not intramuscular injections.

58:51.224 --> 58:53.165
It was not intramuscular injections.

58:53.205 --> 58:58.348
And so they are, they are obfuscating and confounding something that they don't need to do.

58:58.428 --> 59:00.349
That's because they're scripted shitheads.

59:03.146 --> 59:12.517
1902-1905, given a Nobel Prize for discovery of this mechanism, if you give tiny... I said Charles Richet, not Charles Rixey.

59:12.617 --> 59:13.018
Careful.

59:13.038 --> 59:18.324
... doses of foreign protein into a person, separated by two weeks,

59:18.965 --> 59:22.127
they become violently and permanently allergic to that substance.

59:22.147 --> 59:26.170
You know, even if you touch it on the skin or put it just in your mouth on your tongue.

59:27.050 --> 59:32.454
See, the skin became sensitized because those were injections done in the skin.

59:32.474 --> 59:34.615
Do you see, ladies and gentlemen, that's the problem.

59:34.655 --> 59:37.497
That's the reason why they had to go to intramuscular injection.

59:39.212 --> 59:41.933
because injections into the skin are painful.

59:41.993 --> 59:45.694
Injections into the skin cause all kinds of reactions that don't go away.

59:46.114 --> 59:49.495
And people aren't stupid when you inject them into the skin and they feel pain.

59:49.535 --> 59:56.397
But if you inject them into the muscle and they don't feel anything until three weeks later, or maybe never, it's a slow onslaught.

59:58.177 --> 01:00:00.098
And he's not saying that there's any difference.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:05.359
He's just saying injection because he is scripted to be this shittily imprecise.

01:00:06.474 --> 01:00:10.718
Mike Yeadon is a traitor to Earth's grandchildren.

01:00:10.758 --> 01:00:12.120
Make no mistake about it.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.965
If you eat it, you've got a worse than evens chance of having an allergic response to it.

01:00:17.726 --> 01:00:22.270
These people have sensitized you, those of you who've been vaccinated, to large

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:25.252
amounts of the natural environment.

01:00:25.272 --> 01:00:26.713
I mean, how diabolical is that?

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:31.655
And it's exactly the same mechanism as I called out in 2020.

01:00:32.315 --> 01:00:35.457
It's the exact same mechanism that I called out in 2020.

01:00:35.877 --> 01:00:45.282
And this is where again, he's going to be extremely imprecise because transfection is much worse than injecting a random combination of shit into your muscle.

01:00:45.762 --> 01:00:47.663
It's actually much worse.

01:00:49.935 --> 01:00:51.556
It's not the same at all.

01:00:52.096 --> 01:01:06.786
It has potential to do much more catastrophic damage, including autoimmunity to your vessels, which can cause things like spontaneous, really ridiculous aneurysms, you know, like my friend Nathan Breen died of.

01:01:10.689 --> 01:01:11.829
Fuck you, Mike Eden.

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.231
Seriously, fuck you, Mike Eden.

01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:17.397
about the COVID jobs.

01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:41.656
Remember I said that if you ask the human body to make a protein that doesn't belong in you, a non-self protein, a so-called spike protein, wherever it came from, I said if you do that, it will make you, your body will cause an autoimmune reaction or your body will then make foreign material, your immune system will say, what the hell is that?

01:01:41.896 --> 01:01:42.617
And will attack it.

01:01:42.977 --> 01:01:46.060
So it's like a failed organ transplant, it's autoimmunity.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.783
That's what has happened through the whole history of vaccination.

01:01:51.003 --> 01:02:04.751
No, that's not what's happened through the whole history of vaccination, because unlike previous iterations of this intramuscular injection nonsense, there was no expression of foreign protein.

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:09.774
There was injection of it, but not expression of it.

01:02:10.942 --> 01:02:20.247
An expression of it causes the immune system not to be able to tell the difference between self-tissue and foreign proteins.

01:02:21.108 --> 01:02:31.694
Self-tissues could start to present on MHC molecules the new protein that they're making from the transfection and that could cause catastrophic autoimmunity.

01:02:33.228 --> 01:02:40.031
injecting a bunch of combination of shit into your arm is not going to cause auto-immunity by definition.

01:02:40.451 --> 01:02:55.057
It could, but it's not going to do it the way that transfection could, and this scripted asshole is equating these two to make sure that everybody has a very imprecise, stupid simple version of this.

01:02:56.718 --> 01:02:57.738
What a monster!

01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:01.680
And back from the late 1700s to the present day,

01:03:03.303 --> 01:03:03.563
No.

01:03:04.444 --> 01:03:04.724
No.

01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:10.647
The intramuscular injection is from the late 1700s or 1800s and it's dumb.

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:23.253
This is a scripted bastard who has been scripted to attempt to step in front of us and then more importantly step out of the spotlight and put Catherine Watt and Sasha Lautapov there in front of him.

01:03:23.353 --> 01:03:28.776
And this is evidence that he is one of the shittiest men on the planet.

01:03:30.543 --> 01:03:37.328
I mean, he's competing with people like Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Nick Hudson, and Jonathan Engler.

01:03:37.368 --> 01:03:38.569
It's a lot of competition.

01:03:38.609 --> 01:03:41.170
He's even competing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:48.736
at this point, because the worst part about it is, is that this guy is definitely capable of understanding the shitty lies that he's spitting.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:51.097
Whereas I don't think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:51.238 --> 01:03:51.398
is.

01:03:52.659 --> 01:03:53.979
I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:55.701
has been a Truman show his whole life.

01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:57.382
Not this asshole.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.460
What Sasha Latupova got to say, I wonder.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:14.262
You know, we're gonna watch just a brief clip, and then I'm gonna take a break, and we're gonna start with this again, which I promised we would watch yesterday, but we didn't get to watching it yet.

01:04:19.283 --> 01:04:20.323
So let's just watch.

01:04:20.343 --> 01:04:22.144
Let's see what Sasha Latupova's saying.

01:04:24.844 --> 01:04:28.845
In the US law and in the internal presentations that I've disclosed from FDA,

01:04:30.487 --> 01:04:33.228
FDA lawyers have written up the FDA.

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.530
Oh, it's it's the presentations from the FDA.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.691
It's the FDA that's shitty.

01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:39.431
That's weird.

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:43.153
I've heard that somewhere before that the FDA was in the way.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:43.773
I've heard it.

01:04:44.434 --> 01:04:44.974
I've heard it.

01:04:45.814 --> 01:04:48.415
Um, where did I hear that opinions?

01:04:48.836 --> 01:04:49.996
It's very, very clear.

01:04:50.396 --> 01:04:55.799
Clinical trials have never had any impact on FDA's decision to deploy these products.

01:04:56.494 --> 01:05:02.638
And also, to date, all the courts have adjudicated this statement that I just made.

01:05:02.959 --> 01:05:12.865
All the courts have agreed with me that clinical trials have never had any material impact on FDA's decision to deploy these products or government's decision to deploy these products.

01:05:13.006 --> 01:05:15.327
Because as I said, they're irrelevant.

01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:18.670
And the pharma companies can do whatever studies they want to do.

01:05:21.171 --> 01:05:24.974
Technically, what Pfizer and Moderna did were illegal human experiments.

01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:31.693
But, you know, they had no impact on the decision to deploy these things.

01:05:31.793 --> 01:05:33.634
They were going on the market no matter what.

01:05:34.615 --> 01:05:39.799
Does it mean that the current mRNA COVID shots are still under EUA?

01:05:39.879 --> 01:05:42.161
Yes, absolutely.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.462
Why is that such a big deal?

01:05:45.924 --> 01:05:46.184
Why?

01:05:47.873 --> 01:05:50.015
Why is that some kind of revelation?

01:05:50.055 --> 01:05:50.735
We know that.

01:05:50.855 --> 01:05:53.317
We've been saying that for a very, very long time.

01:05:53.758 --> 01:06:03.005
But what's really impressive is, of course, that the use of PCR as a diagnostic is not under any scrutiny here.

01:06:04.787 --> 01:06:10.791
The use of sequencing as a high-fidelity measurement is not under any scrutiny here.

01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:16.396
The use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce the RNA is not under scrutiny here.

01:06:17.987 --> 01:06:27.271
We are trying to make it seem as though that you have no hope that the entire vaccine schedule since the early 1700s was designed to depopulate the earth.

01:06:29.011 --> 01:06:32.753
That now they're invoking some kind of kill box, right?

01:06:33.433 --> 01:06:36.154
And it's a military operation that you can't escape.

01:06:36.234 --> 01:06:38.095
That's what, because it's a kill box.

01:06:41.056 --> 01:06:45.118
Does that make all of the DOD and all of our military members complicit in this?

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.741
What kind of bullshit are they saying here?

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.923
They're saying scripted bullshit.

01:06:55.003 --> 01:06:57.104
It's bullshit that's scripted by Robert Malone.

01:06:57.964 --> 01:07:00.925
Sasha Latupova is one of the worst women on the planet.

01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:07.508
She ranks up there with Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Pauly Tommy.

01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:11.069
It's gross.

01:07:11.649 --> 01:07:13.110
It's absolutely gross.

01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:13.727
Yeah.

01:07:14.308 --> 01:07:33.863
As I said, until the PRAP Act declaration is revoked by HHS Secretary or by President or by Congress, these things remain EUA because you cannot switch from a non-investigational to investigational without going back and now doing the

01:07:34.827 --> 01:07:38.390
proper clinical trials for investigational product collection.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:38.790
Exactly.

01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:41.512
Which would take years in all likelihood, right?

01:07:41.552 --> 01:07:43.314
They would take a long time.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:54.683
And so she can't explain that the use of placebo allows the FDA to say that millions of doses were given and we don't have a signal?

01:07:57.222 --> 01:08:09.534
She's not able to explain that that would have been done if this was a government, military, organized coup, designed to get everybody on board, to get maximum compliance.

01:08:09.554 --> 01:08:11.836
Do you see how shitty this show is?

01:08:12.717 --> 01:08:14.718
How much of a loser this person is?

01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:17.466
A scripted fraud.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:26.331
First of all, it would take years if you were going to do it, but actually you can't even do it anymore because there's extensive evidence that these are poisons and killing people.

01:08:26.411 --> 01:08:30.433
And you can't classically involve people in testing poison.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.693
These are poisons.

01:08:31.813 --> 01:08:38.897
So she too is unable to say that they're transfection, an old technology renamed as a vaccine.

01:08:39.477 --> 01:08:44.260
Mike Yeadon can't say that these are old technologies that we were using when I was a pharma exec.

01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:46.683
and that they're being renamed.

01:08:47.024 --> 01:08:54.177
Kevin McKernan can't say the transfection is being renamed, even though the first time he used transfection in the lab was in 1998 in Sabatini's lab.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:12.075
Huh, it's so strange that none of these people seem to be able to say that this is old technology being recycled, even when they're trying to speak out now, six years later.

01:09:12.675 --> 01:09:15.137
That's how much of a piece of shit fraud this woman is.

01:09:15.897 --> 01:09:16.738
It's gross.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:17.999
Non-poison.

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:23.483
Okay, so that's why you can't actually do it anymore.

01:09:25.387 --> 01:09:26.148
Can't do what?

01:09:27.008 --> 01:09:28.229
Can't do the trials?

01:09:28.389 --> 01:09:29.290
I mean, come on.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:34.775
Are we really seriously talking about whether Marty and Vinay can do anything to help us?

01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:37.677
This is a piece of shit, scripted fraud.

01:09:38.658 --> 01:09:41.640
I really, really dislike Sasha Latupova.

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:42.801
My God.

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:50.688
She's gotta be, if she has an American passport, she is very close to being one of the shittiest Americans alive.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:51.288
Wow.

01:09:51.408 --> 01:09:52.449
I mean, really, wow.

01:09:53.049 --> 01:09:53.930
Just remarkable.

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:54.831
Remarkable.

01:10:04.218 --> 01:10:04.581
you

01:13:42.654 --> 01:13:43.360
Peace.

01:15:06.596 --> 01:15:16.004
I still feel obligated to tell you this story of the first year or so of my friendship with Nathan.

01:15:17.185 --> 01:15:18.245
Nathan is down here.

01:15:20.527 --> 01:15:27.693
He is a friend of mine from college who I met at DePaul University in Chicago in 92, I think.

01:15:29.614 --> 01:15:33.277
And I was his calculus

01:15:34.369 --> 01:15:37.791
like TA and also his wife's calculus TA.

01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:40.153
He met his wife in that calculus class.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:47.178
And I was privileged to that whole courting and everything.

01:15:47.398 --> 01:15:48.879
And certainly I was at their wedding.

01:15:49.219 --> 01:15:58.225
And I love his wife very much as a friend who goes all the way back to know me better than anyone could know me, really.

01:15:59.006 --> 01:16:02.948
Because she knew me when I was a kid in college, when I met him.

01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:15.102
And in the first year of knowing Nathan, we were going to a lot of live music because I had just discovered music as an 18-year-old kid.

01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:22.710
I was in marching band in high school, but the extent to which I appreciated music really

01:16:23.331 --> 01:16:29.595
was like U2 because I worked with a lifeguard during high school that liked, excuse me, that liked U2.

01:16:30.395 --> 01:16:39.000
And so I listened to the radio and I had a U2 album and I had 1984, the Van Halen album, and that was really it.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.701
I just didn't listen to a lot of music.

01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:50.206
And Nathan is a guitar player and he, you know, I went out, I listened to music with him and it changed me.

01:16:52.902 --> 01:17:12.619
And one of the things that I can tell you about that song is that the Freddie Jones band is a Chicago band, and they used to play at a bar called the Cubby Bear, which is on the corner of Addison and... I want to say it's Clark and Addison, but I'm not absolutely sure it's Clark and Addison.

01:17:12.659 --> 01:17:13.139
I think it is.

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:16.982
But it's across the street from Wrigley Field, where the Cubs play, and...

01:17:19.611 --> 01:17:26.376
We used to take the L up there and they used to have this thing on Thursday nights, which was called B cubed.

01:17:27.597 --> 01:17:31.160
And that meant beer, band and burgers.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:35.323
That's unlimited beer, unlimited burgers.

01:17:35.403 --> 01:17:46.432
I mean, it's not like they were like Wagyu burgers, but unlimited burgers and unlimited beer and a band for five US dollars.

01:17:48.393 --> 01:17:49.354
Chicago, Illinois.

01:17:50.532 --> 01:18:08.818
And so I think you can imagine if you could see the Freddie Jones band play in a daydream for $5 holding a pitcher of your own beer, you would be pretty close to perfect.

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:17.621
And that's the kind of memories that I have with that guy who was taken from me because these assholes

01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:23.592
misled me and confused me long enough that I could not save my friend.

01:18:24.732 --> 01:18:30.473
That I was making a fool of myself for a couple years about a lab leak.

01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:37.355
And that's why I couldn't save him or his family from being transfected.

01:18:37.415 --> 01:18:41.475
I don't know how healthy his daughters and wife will remain behind.

01:18:43.796 --> 01:18:48.497
I don't know enough anymore because I've lost so much contact with so many people.

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.342
But I do know that these people are scripted liars.

01:18:54.804 --> 01:18:59.007
And I do know that there are very few people on the internet that you're gonna hear this truth from.

01:18:59.688 --> 01:19:00.689
And that's by design.

01:19:01.309 --> 01:19:03.091
It's been a long, strange trip getting here.

01:19:04.431 --> 01:19:10.335
I want to play a little more of this video that I was watching the other day with you.

01:19:11.195 --> 01:19:13.697
And then I think we're going to give it up.

01:19:14.237 --> 01:19:17.479
But I'm going to play it separately so that I can put it a little bit faster.

01:19:17.979 --> 01:19:21.281
And I'm going to start by listening to the Dell BigTree opening.

01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:26.023
And remember that Dell BigTree says things like, we kill kids every year with the vaccine schedule.

01:19:26.504 --> 01:19:28.525
And he doesn't say that anymore because this is 2017.

01:19:30.706 --> 01:19:34.429
And this is when Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn are still alive.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:37.831
And this is standing in front of Tony Bark in 2017.

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:44.575
So let me just move this over there.

01:19:44.595 --> 01:19:48.678
I don't know why my mouse is so like... The resolution is so low all of a sudden.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:49.779
I don't... What I did there...

01:19:54.155 --> 01:19:57.138
Oh yeah, sorry, I gotta move this speed up a little bit because this is brutal.

01:19:57.758 --> 01:20:01.741
We might not speed up Brandy, I mean Tony, but we'll speed up everybody else.

01:20:03.622 --> 01:20:07.605
And then I'm gonna go full screen and then I'm gonna put myself low.

01:20:08.946 --> 01:20:11.068
And then I'm gonna speed this up a little bit.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:21.862
You can see Brandy, I mean, sorry, Tony is sitting right here in the front and right next to her is Judy Mikovits.

01:20:22.482 --> 01:20:25.643
Here is Thomas, Paul Thomas.

01:20:26.163 --> 01:20:33.205
That's the doctor that had the alternative vaccine schedule and indeed was stumping for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:33.325 --> 01:20:35.826
before the first Trump administration.

01:20:35.866 --> 01:20:36.866
So don't forget that.

01:20:38.087 --> 01:20:38.587
Here we go.

01:20:38.607 --> 01:20:40.428
I think it's gonna start soon.

01:20:40.448 --> 01:20:41.868
Let me just scan a bit.

01:20:48.151 --> 01:20:48.851
Good morning, everyone.

01:20:49.432 --> 01:20:52.294
Thank you for joining us today for Doctors for Accountability.

01:20:52.574 --> 01:21:02.640
Now remember that this guy, if you play it at regular speed like we did yesterday in the second half, this guy sounds like he got some really good indica right before he came up on stage.

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:08.824
He speaks slower, and maybe I should do it again, and then I'll speed it up with the other ones.

01:21:09.024 --> 01:21:13.567
Maybe I should just do it again to make that impression so you can really see it for what it is.

01:21:14.527 --> 01:21:16.889
Maybe I double click on this, it becomes number one again.

01:21:19.403 --> 01:21:22.003
And then video full screen.

01:21:22.023 --> 01:21:23.244
Medicine and media.

01:21:24.204 --> 01:21:25.824
My name is Del Bigtree.

01:21:27.664 --> 01:21:33.565
My background, I was a producer on the Emmy Award winning television show, The Doctors.

01:21:34.606 --> 01:21:44.567
For six years, I spent my career celebrating the best that medicine has to offer, the best science, the best doctors, cutting edge techniques, new surgeries.

01:21:45.287 --> 01:21:48.208
I'm a fan of great doctors and great medicine.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:22:03.432
While working on that show, I stumbled upon the story of Dr. William Thompson, the whistleblower from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that came forward in the fall of 2014 to let us know that the CDC had been corrupted.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:16.306
and that they were committing scientific fraud on their vaccine studies, specifically the MMR vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and its causal relationship to autism.

01:22:16.986 --> 01:22:21.028
I made a movie about that, produced it, called Vaxxed.

01:22:21.869 --> 01:22:26.811
Actually, tomorrow will be the one-year anniversary of the first premiere of Vaxxed.

01:22:32.771 --> 01:22:46.315
That began a journey for me, as I think many of the people you're about to hear from today, that takes you out of what you believe was the foundation and truth in science and specifically to vaccine research and testing.

01:22:47.836 --> 01:23:02.000
Once you start asking the appropriate questions about the vaccine program in this nation and the one that really is promoted all around the world, you begin a journey that takes you to some very scary realities.

01:23:03.959 --> 01:23:13.066
These people here today represent some of the people that I've studied and investigated and interviewed for some of my research and the work that I'm doing.

01:23:13.626 --> 01:23:20.411
They only represent a handful of the many, many doctors across this nation and the world that are standing up now

01:23:21.368 --> 01:23:30.850
and asking for real accountability in vaccine safety, research, testing, and the promotion of future vaccines and those we're using on our children.

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:35.451
Sorry, when I'm using it, I try to stop it a different way.

01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:40.772
Keep in mind that he is not saying we need to stop the vaccine schedule.

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:42.633
He's not saying anything remotely like that.

01:23:42.653 --> 01:23:44.253
He wants accountability, right?

01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:46.153
That's the important thing to hear here.

01:23:46.953 --> 01:23:48.934
Let them do the talking today.

01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:55.197
Because we live in a nation right now that wants to say the science is settled around vaccines.

01:23:56.058 --> 01:23:57.721
What that means is we're done.

01:23:58.562 --> 01:24:04.110
We're saying that we accept a vaccine program that this year will murder children.

01:24:04.793 --> 01:24:05.553
That's a fact.

01:24:05.733 --> 01:24:09.255
There will be children who will lose their lives this year to the vaccine program.

01:24:09.735 --> 01:24:14.818
They would have had an otherwise totally normal life, could have gone on to become president of the United States.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:26.664
If you want to defend him, if you want to defend Dell, you got to find video of him after 2021 saying something like this, because they won't find it.

01:24:26.744 --> 01:24:28.325
There is no video of Dell.

01:24:29.005 --> 01:24:35.209
saying that kids are killed and paralyzed and injured every year by a vaccine schedule because we accept it.

01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:46.897
He said it now because he's in the same room as the hero, Tony Bark, who they ended up killing in 2020, just like Brandy Vaughn, in order to stand in front of her.

01:24:48.998 --> 01:24:51.820
They will not be here because of this vaccine program.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.903
Other children will suffer paralysis,

01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.412
Some will have their brains damaged permanently for life.

01:25:00.593 --> 01:25:04.897
And recently, I've been asking this question of some fairly high up officials.

01:25:05.637 --> 01:25:07.179
And what I say is, how is that?

01:25:07.979 --> 01:25:09.500
Why didn't Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:12.583
open with that at some point in Congress, right?

01:25:13.904 --> 01:25:16.626
Because they're on a shitty script.

01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:17.947
And so is he.

01:25:18.528 --> 01:25:20.829
That's where we're settled.

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:25.253
And they say, well, science has determined that that's an acceptable casualty.

01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:31.194
We have an accepted casualty in order to reach herd immunity in the United States of America.

01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:33.696
Herd immunity, herd immunity.

01:25:33.816 --> 01:25:37.318
See, the enchantment and the script goes back to 2017.

01:25:37.658 --> 01:25:43.381
And I'm afraid that this guy, in his slow motion way at the time, knows

01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:45.785
that what he's doing.

01:25:45.865 --> 01:25:51.128
He knows that the Vaxxed movie was made to step in front of Brandy and Tony.

01:25:51.488 --> 01:26:05.698
He knows that that movie was made because it was setting up a movement that would be a health freedom movement that would build a big top tent of health freedom and that would use Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield as a slow motion titration to a goal

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.503
which was the inversion of our sovereignty to experimental animal status.

01:26:12.023 --> 01:26:15.105
This man is a traitor to all of Earth's grandchildren.

01:26:15.405 --> 01:26:27.531
And so I follow that question with my, or that statement with my own question, which is, please tell me how many children exactly are going to die this year from our vaccine program.

01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:35.276
Could you please tell me exactly how many children's minds will be ruined for their lives or be paralyzed?

01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:42.053
And the answer you get from the mainstream medical community is we don't have the data on that.

01:26:43.794 --> 01:26:48.856
So how do we have an acceptable casualty if we don't know what number we're accepting?

01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:54.018
I think that's the beginning of the first question anybody should be asking right now.

01:26:54.758 --> 01:27:04.982
So when we live in a nation that says that vaccines are safe and effective, which actually flies in the face of the highest court in the land, right here in this town, the Supreme Court,

01:27:05.523 --> 01:27:12.546
which ruled in 2011 made the official statement vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

01:27:13.446 --> 01:27:24.070
I would like to know how the medical community stands in direct opposition to that statement made by the highest court in the land and repeats constantly vaccines are safe and effective.

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:27.671
That duality inside this nation

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:39.015
between our medical establishment and the highest court in the land should be the beginning of a question that allows us to have true conversation, open conversation.

01:27:39.095 --> 01:27:45.398
So the conversation should be between the highest court in the land and what again?

01:27:46.499 --> 01:27:48.380
It has something to do with what again?

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:55.924
It's not to do with the fundamental biology of injection, being dumb, like Brandy Vaughn says.

01:27:56.926 --> 01:28:04.988
Like even at some point, Suzanne Humphries could say, but not really because she just said that she doesn't think there can be a safe vaccine.

01:28:05.588 --> 01:28:17.851
She is also not sophisticated enough or so thoroughly scripted that she cannot make enough progress to get to the goal line, which is intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:28:19.099 --> 01:28:26.065
And instead, they carefully and very scriptedly use the word vaccine over and over and over again.

01:28:26.786 --> 01:28:31.670
Del Bigtree is a scripted fraud and a traitor to our grandchildren.

01:28:32.131 --> 01:28:34.173
...about the science of vaccines.

01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:40.538
If we cannot question science, then it is no longer science.

01:28:41.519 --> 01:28:42.480
It has become a religion.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:51.242
And much of the way this situation is addressed, this medicine is addressed, this vaccine program is addressed, is like a religion.

01:28:51.982 --> 01:28:54.543
If you question it, you are a heretic.

01:28:56.023 --> 01:29:02.684
If you question why there's a duality between the Supreme Court and the medical establishment, you're a heretic.

01:29:06.043 --> 01:29:13.449
The Supreme Court and the medical establishment, if you question that, if you ask that stupid question, you're a heretic.

01:29:13.469 --> 01:29:15.951
You see, this is just bullshit.

01:29:15.971 --> 01:29:18.033
There's no possible way this is real.

01:29:18.073 --> 01:29:19.714
This is a scripted traitor.

01:29:19.774 --> 01:29:20.955
Greatest nation in the world.

01:29:21.575 --> 01:29:23.477
We have the greatest scientists in the world.

01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:29.582
And I don't believe we should say the science is settled when lives will be destroyed by a program.

01:29:29.882 --> 01:29:31.423
We can do better.

01:29:32.144 --> 01:29:33.725
We must do better.

01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:52.218
And for any scientist that wants to say they have settled at a place where innocent children's lives will be destroyed, I say please step out of the way and let the future scientists come in and figure out a way to create immunity in our children, health in our children.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:57.936
that is safe and effective for every single child in this nation.

01:29:59.116 --> 01:29:59.236
Aha!

01:29:59.356 --> 01:30:08.699
So, Del Bigtree seems to believe that there is a reason and a necessity to have a public health system which creates immunity in our kids.

01:30:09.119 --> 01:30:10.680
He just wants it to be safe.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.480
Stop lying!

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.641
Stop lying!

01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:17.522
Wow.

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.102
I mean, there you go, right there.

01:30:19.182 --> 01:30:21.623
He's an absolute scripted piece of shit.

01:30:23.479 --> 01:30:25.841
He's absolutely a traitor to our grandkids.

01:30:25.941 --> 01:30:26.761
And around the world.

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:29.643
And until we have achieved that.

01:30:30.644 --> 01:30:31.204
Achieved what?

01:30:31.224 --> 01:30:32.685
We must never, ever say.

01:30:32.725 --> 01:30:33.345
Achieved what?

01:30:33.766 --> 01:30:39.589
Scientists say they have settled at a place where innocent children's lives will be destroyed.

01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:50.236
I say, please step out of the way and let the future scientists come in and figure out a way to create immunity in our children, health in our children,

01:30:50.558 --> 01:30:57.041
that is safe and effective for every single child in this nation and around the world.

01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:13.949
And until we have achieved that, we must never, ever say we have settled, or we are no longer the greatest nation in the world, we are no longer the greatest scientists in the world, and we no longer have the greatest medical practice.

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.102
I think what you need to hear here is that the script is very shitty right now.

01:31:18.202 --> 01:31:19.843
The script is still being developed.

01:31:19.883 --> 01:31:20.923
This is a setup.

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:23.465
This is part of the long con.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:34.631
And the establishment, the establishing rather, of this very shitty health freedom movement that's very amorphous and all about mandates and freedom of speech

01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:47.956
This is the same year that Bret Weinstein is gonna come out and get a half a million dollar settlement and then be able to go on to the Senate and cry about it the year later.

01:31:48.896 --> 01:31:52.577
It's all the same frickin' theater.

01:31:53.658 --> 01:32:02.201
Steve Bannon, RFK, Tony Lyons, same bullshit, fake conservative health freedom movement.

01:32:03.525 --> 01:32:04.566
Mother Sucker!

01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:18.531
are going to move us into the direction.

01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:21.291
Can you hear the votes being tallied?

01:32:21.371 --> 01:32:22.392
Can you hear the votes?

01:32:22.452 --> 01:32:30.414
It's just like Pauly Tommy on billboards getting six million votes for prime minister to make autism more aware of some shit.

01:32:30.874 --> 01:32:31.614
It's the same thing.

01:32:31.654 --> 01:32:32.495
You can hear the votes.

01:32:32.555 --> 01:32:33.475
You can hear them coming in.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:44.678
That we need to go, which is open dialogue, scientific research, and getting back to the principles of true safety medical testing.

01:32:45.717 --> 01:32:47.678
So it's an honor to be up here with these folks.

01:32:48.198 --> 01:32:51.500
We'll have a question and answer period after every one of them speaks.

01:32:52.081 --> 01:33:10.751
And I also want to let you know, if you're with the press, beyond the people that you'll hear speak, we also have available to us today Catherine and Patrick Layton, who have gone through the issue of dealing with injured children themselves, and Mary Jo de Guzman and Jose Ramirez.

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:15.838
child within the last year or two of vaccine injury.

01:33:18.338 --> 01:33:18.878
Let us commence.

01:33:19.558 --> 01:33:23.499
To start out with today, I would like to introduce really a pioneer in pediatrics in many ways.

01:33:24.059 --> 01:33:29.200
Dr. Paul Thomas received his MD from Dartmouth Medical School and completed his pediatric residency at the University of California, San Diego.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:35.721
He is a board-certified fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, board-certified in integrative and holistic medicine, and a diplomat of the American Board of Addiction Medicine.

01:33:35.982 --> 01:33:37.322
He taught residents and medical students from 1988 to

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:58.153
is a diplomat of the board of addiction medicine is I think what he just said there I'm gonna go back a little bit but that would also be a very damning place for this asshole to be given the opioid crisis holy shit really a pioneer in pediatrics in many ways

01:33:58.713 --> 01:34:03.817
Dr. Paul Thomas received his MD from Dartmouth Medical School and completed his pediatric residency at the University of California, San Diego.

01:34:04.117 --> 01:34:10.342
He is a board-certified fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, board-certified in integrative and holistic medicine, and a diplomat of the American Board of Addiction Medicine.

01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:24.513
He taught residents and medical students from 1988 to 1993, practiced at Westside Pediatrics from 1993 to 2008, and opened his own practice in 2008, Integrative Pediatrics, where he currently... I'm sorry, but I guess we gotta really listen to it at regular speed in order to catch it.

01:34:24.613 --> 01:34:26.054
So I'm gonna get it off of this.

01:34:26.254 --> 01:34:26.554
Ooh, it's 1-7.

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:31.509
And I just want to hear it again, because I really want to know if that's what he said.

01:34:31.929 --> 01:34:36.170
...serves over 13,000 at the University of California, San Diego.

01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:47.273
He is a board-certified fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, board-certified in integrative and holistic medicine, and a diplomat of the American Board of Addiction Medicine.

01:34:47.773 --> 01:34:49.934
He taught residents... Holy shit!

01:34:50.354 --> 01:34:51.334
He really said it!

01:34:51.774 --> 01:34:52.495
Holy shit!

01:34:57.731 --> 01:35:08.679
He's on the board that should have known that the opioid crisis was happening, that it was causing a decrease in life expectancy and that it was being ignored for the last six years.

01:35:08.819 --> 01:35:16.364
Paul Thomas should have been saying that it was being ignored because he was on the fricking board.

01:35:18.541 --> 01:35:20.743
Pediatrics and addiction medicine.

01:35:20.823 --> 01:35:22.905
What kind of bullshitter is he?

01:35:23.606 --> 01:35:30.733
He's got the alternative vaccine schedule too, you know, the, the alternative vaccine schedule, the holy shit.

01:35:31.814 --> 01:35:32.055
Sorry.

01:35:32.095 --> 01:35:32.855
I got to speed it up.

01:35:32.956 --> 01:35:35.238
I I'm never going to get done if we'd go at normal speed.

01:35:36.314 --> 01:35:37.435
Try not to be so bad.

01:35:37.515 --> 01:35:40.077
Mike's getting a little bit uneasy here.

01:35:41.979 --> 01:35:53.709
From 1988 to 1993, practiced at Westside Pediatrics from 1993 to 2008, and opened his own practice in 2008, Integrative Pediatrics, where he currently serves over 13,000 patients in the Portland, Oregon metro area.

01:35:53.989 --> 01:35:59.494
He's a founding director of PIC, which is Physicians for Informed Consent, a fantastic new group that's just come forward in the last several months.

01:35:59.634 --> 01:36:01.876
And he's co-chair for the Oregonians for Medical Freedom.

01:36:02.116 --> 01:36:10.842
He's the co-author with Jennifer Margulis of the vaccine-friendly plan, Dr. Paul's Safe and Effective Approach to Immunity and Health, from Pregnancy through Your Child's Teen Years, which is forthcoming from Valentine.

01:36:11.202 --> 01:36:16.165
More than 260,000 people are subscribed to Dr. Paul's YouTube channel and or follow him on Facebook.

01:36:16.586 --> 01:36:17.887
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Paul Thomas.

01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:23.070
Thank you, Del.

01:36:24.691 --> 01:36:28.474
I went to Dartmouth back in the early 80s, and all I recall being taught about vaccines was

01:36:29.269 --> 01:36:30.650
They were miraculous.

01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:35.011
We eradicated smallpox, polio, and followed the CDC schedule.

01:36:35.252 --> 01:36:43.455
And for most of my career, the CDC and the Academy of Pediatrics seemed to be in the same closed-door room making the schedule that was then released each year, and we just simply followed it.

01:36:44.906 --> 01:36:49.068
What I found was, after I got into practice, well, let me take you back to residency, because this is important.

01:36:49.568 --> 01:36:52.949
Doctors are trained to really believe that vaccines are one of the most important things we can do.

01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:55.150
And so we are really indoctrinated with that belief.

01:36:55.210 --> 01:36:58.211
And when I was in residency, I actually witnessed the introduction of the Hib vaccine.

01:36:58.471 --> 01:37:02.073
And at that time, we used to put needles into babies' spines to rule out meningitis several times a night.

01:37:02.553 --> 01:37:03.553
And I could do it with my eyes closed.

01:37:03.573 --> 01:37:04.473
There was so much meningitis.

01:37:05.014 --> 01:37:10.056
And literally, after that vaccine was introduced in the mid, it was about 1987, I experienced a drop in meningitis.

01:37:10.096 --> 01:37:10.856
And the data did show that.

01:37:10.916 --> 01:37:11.696
So I'm a believer.

01:37:11.856 --> 01:37:12.677
I mean, I go into the world.

01:37:12.717 --> 01:37:13.577
I'm going to make a difference.

01:37:13.897 --> 01:37:15.198
and vaccines was the way I was going to do it.

01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:30.031
Sadly... So interesting he's already arguing that some vaccines work and he's seen the evidence for it in his practice which is an extraordinary thing to say and definitely not, sorry, not definitely not anti-vax.

01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:35.355
Children are not doing very well today and I think the bloated vaccine schedule is part of the problem.

01:37:35.595 --> 01:37:36.756
I want to fast forward to November of 2007

01:37:38.226 --> 01:37:43.470
The bloated vaccine schedule is part of the problem.

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:44.530
Stop lying!

01:37:45.371 --> 01:37:46.712
Stop lying!

01:37:47.092 --> 01:37:48.533
Wow, that's impressive already.

01:37:57.659 --> 01:37:59.640
I'm not really sure why that froze for a second.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.200
I'm going to try it again.

01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:00.500
There we go.

01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:12.250
you would think that was a coincidence.

01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:17.353
But this- He's, again, remember, listen to this, the enchantment very carefully.

01:38:17.413 --> 01:38:20.955
He just threw out there that he couldn't make contact with him.

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.576
This kid was totally autistic.

01:38:22.616 --> 01:38:31.161
So without any specifics, even though it's a spectrum disorder, without any specifics about what happened, you know, was there any head banging?

01:38:31.221 --> 01:38:36.245
Was he having, you know, a turbo diarrhea?

01:38:36.345 --> 01:38:37.285
Any of these things, like so,

01:38:39.062 --> 01:38:43.603
unclear exactly what's happening because, again, it's an enchantment.

01:38:43.683 --> 01:38:45.524
It is a scripted enchantment.

01:38:45.584 --> 01:38:49.105
You've just been told to accept that some vaccines work.

01:38:49.805 --> 01:38:53.386
You've just been told that an overload of vaccines might be the problem.

01:38:53.806 --> 01:38:55.087
And you've just been told, what?

01:38:57.694 --> 01:39:01.535
that some kid is autistic because, you know, he couldn't make contact with him.

01:39:02.315 --> 01:39:02.815
Wow.

01:39:03.415 --> 01:39:05.936
This was the fourth case in four years in my practice alone.

01:39:06.356 --> 01:39:07.496
I didn't have a huge practice back then.

01:39:07.516 --> 01:39:08.537
I had probably a couple thousand kids.

01:39:08.937 --> 01:39:12.978
I was a very busy pediatrician getting about 100 newborns per year, way more than most pediatricians got.

01:39:13.218 --> 01:39:15.678
So I was seeing severe autism in one out of 100 at that time.

01:39:16.218 --> 01:39:17.119
I already knew too much.

01:39:17.459 --> 01:39:17.899
It was not

01:39:19.028 --> 01:39:22.732
logical to be injecting a huge dose of aluminum with the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns who don't need it.

01:39:23.052 --> 01:39:25.374
Oh, it's a huge dose of aluminum now.

01:39:25.815 --> 01:39:32.942
And he was seeing it in lots of people in his, in his practice, but he doesn't, he's not very precise.

01:39:34.454 --> 01:39:36.015
Is it the hep B vaccine?

01:39:36.495 --> 01:39:43.038
Because the guy that was up here before you said that there's some guy from the CDC who's whistleblowing on the MMR shot.

01:39:43.078 --> 01:39:47.400
You know, like Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy were whistleblowing on the MMR shot.

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.360
What's going on here?

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:53.322
In fact, to this day, I haven't had a single mom in my practice, 30 years of practicing pediatrics who needed that vaccine.

01:39:53.783 --> 01:39:57.444
So that routine vaccine is just totally illogical.

01:39:57.484 --> 01:39:58.525
It doesn't make any scientific sense.

01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:01.210
What does that mean?

01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:03.655
What does it mean that it doesn't make any scientific sense?

01:40:03.735 --> 01:40:05.680
Because the moms don't have Hep B?

01:40:06.261 --> 01:40:08.306
Do you see how much of a piece of shit this is?

01:40:10.716 --> 01:40:12.136
43% have chronic diseases now.

01:40:12.156 --> 01:40:15.717
And the biggest things are autism, ADD, ADHD, anxiety, asthma, the allergies, autoimmune things are exploding.

01:40:16.417 --> 01:40:18.378
I left my group practice and started integrative pediatrics.

01:40:18.598 --> 01:40:21.538
And I decided to implement what we should all be doing, and that's informed consent.

01:40:22.098 --> 01:40:25.439
Now, the problem is when you go see a doctor today, you're only being formed to the knowledge of that doctor.

01:40:25.739 --> 01:40:29.139
And sadly, most of our doctors, as Del pointed out, feel that vaccines are safe and effective, end of story.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.460
So that's the amount of information you're going to get.

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:36.761
And so those of you who are parents who are watching this, you need to inform yourselves, because chances are you may not get adequate information from your doctors.

01:40:37.509 --> 01:40:41.033
So what do we need to inform ourselves about, you see?

01:40:41.053 --> 01:40:44.657
How intramuscular injection is just dumb?

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:46.138
Nope, not at all.

01:40:46.158 --> 01:40:46.659
The vaccine-friendly plan!

01:40:57.478 --> 01:40:58.118
There he is.

01:40:58.278 --> 01:40:59.098
Thank you very much.

01:40:59.298 --> 01:41:00.219
He is a fraud.

01:41:00.659 --> 01:41:03.980
To outline that experience and to give parents a guide that was different than the CDC guidelines.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.040
But basically this was no vaccines during pregnancy.

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:06.960
No hep B at birth.

01:41:07.181 --> 01:41:08.241
You don't need the rotavirus vaccine.

01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:10.801
It's a live virus vaccine that is making kids sicker than not.

01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:16.423
I have the data from my practice that unvaccinated for rotavirus have much less vomiting, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, the whole thing you're trying to prevent with that vaccine.

01:41:16.903 --> 01:41:17.643
No Hep A vaccines.

01:41:17.663 --> 01:41:19.724
You know, I have not seen a single case of Hepatitis A in my career.

01:41:19.904 --> 01:41:21.205
A busy pediatrician for 30 years.

01:41:21.505 --> 01:41:21.885
Why is that?

01:41:21.965 --> 01:41:25.607
I live on the West Coast where there's supposed to be a ton of Hep A. Well, for children, it's a mild illness.

01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:26.868
We probably write it off as a cold or the flu.

01:41:27.008 --> 01:41:27.708
It's no big deal.

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:32.490
And we wait on the MMR till... So again, we're asking people to wait.

01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:38.033
We're telling people not to take as many shots or not take shots that they're in no danger of.

01:41:38.533 --> 01:41:40.434
It's all dumb questions.

01:41:40.754 --> 01:41:45.516
All dumb questions that assume that there are sometimes right answers and sometimes wrong answers.

01:41:45.976 --> 01:41:50.258
instead of just saying that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:41:51.378 --> 01:41:53.399
After age three, that was a fortuitous choice I happened to make.

01:41:53.439 --> 01:41:55.740
Just got feeling that that vaccine was problematic being given early.

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.280
Wait on the chicken pox till school age.

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:03.002
And if you have any family history of autism, autoimmune disorders, severe neurological disorders, seizures, developmental delays, don't do any vaccines.

01:42:03.362 --> 01:42:06.804
The other thing I should clarify is that if you start to see any of those things, stop.

01:42:07.284 --> 01:42:09.545
That child is giving you an indication that this isn't going well.

01:42:09.745 --> 01:42:10.665
And that's something that's overlooked.

01:42:11.351 --> 01:42:18.114
And so this is part of the narrative that James Lyons Wyler also says that some kids might not be affected by the vaccine.

01:42:18.615 --> 01:42:21.216
So if you see an effect, you should stop.

01:42:21.336 --> 01:42:22.977
Otherwise you can keep going.

01:42:24.237 --> 01:42:28.659
If you see an effect, you should stop because that kid might have a genetic vulnerability.

01:42:28.699 --> 01:42:31.681
But if you don't see an effect, you can keep going.

01:42:32.181 --> 01:42:33.502
Stop lying.

01:42:37.466 --> 01:42:38.086
So what did we find?

01:42:38.366 --> 01:42:40.868
I got an IRB and we closed the data set in February of 2015.

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:45.910
And we found that in over a thousand kids vaccinated with the vaccine friendly approach, there were no new cases of autism or autism spectrum.

01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:48.051
We had 238 kids who did no vaccines.

01:42:48.071 --> 01:42:49.192
They were the healthiest by far.

01:42:49.532 --> 01:42:51.433
The data sets, I hope to get published in the near future.

01:42:52.574 --> 01:42:54.755
In so many parameters, the unvaccinated kids were by far the healthiest.

01:42:54.795 --> 01:43:01.999
And in the- And so why not just jump to that crazy conclusion that vaccines hurt kids and make them less safe?

01:43:02.805 --> 01:43:03.486
less healthy.

01:43:03.926 --> 01:43:09.913
Why not jump to that conclusion and then start to do research on it and try to figure out why it is that this is happening.

01:43:10.474 --> 01:43:16.301
Why it is that we think this instead of just saying the bullshit that he's saying and still says today.

01:43:24.079 --> 01:43:27.181
Toby Rogers is from the Brownstone Institute.

01:43:27.321 --> 01:43:28.542
Fuck Toby Rogers.

01:43:28.582 --> 01:43:35.586
I've been trying to communicate with him for six months and now he totally lost his mind and blocked me on X. Fuck Toby Rogers.

01:43:36.447 --> 01:43:41.150
The statistical significance of this, for those of you who are scientists, I know I'm not supposed to get scientific here, but it was a p-value of .00001.

01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:44.792
I mean, I haven't read a study in the scientific journals with that kind of significance.

01:43:45.012 --> 01:43:47.033
The chance of these findings being by coincidence is 1 in 100,000.

01:43:48.254 --> 01:43:49.135
It's just not going to happen.

01:43:49.555 --> 01:43:50.856
So I want to talk about a couple pet peeves of mine.

01:43:50.916 --> 01:43:51.456
One is pregnancy.

01:43:51.816 --> 01:43:55.459
I meet moms and dads and couples for prenatal visits and usually it's too late.

01:43:55.819 --> 01:43:58.921
They have already been to their OBGYN and they've already been vaccinated with a flu shot and a Tdap.

01:43:59.401 --> 01:44:00.362
They're trying to prevent pertussis.

01:44:00.562 --> 01:44:01.262
I get the idea.

01:44:01.422 --> 01:44:02.703
It's a good idea to try to prevent pertussis.

01:44:02.923 --> 01:44:12.069
Do you know that Toby Rogers actually worked for CHD and claims that he was fired by Mary Holland for trying to organize a political action committee behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? ?

01:44:13.052 --> 01:44:13.573
That's him.

01:44:14.033 --> 01:44:20.219
He thinks that Laura Bono and that other lady, Lynn Redwood, are crazy people.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.705
But Mary Holland just fired him for some... He's a brownstone piece of shit liar.

01:44:28.706 --> 01:44:53.578
really toby is a fraud he's been on brett weinstein like a month ago toby rogers was on brett weinstein's show toby rogers is a scripted piece of shit fraud but we lose about five babies a year in the united states to pertussis in the infant period out of four million births so we are injecting a toxic dose of aluminum every pregnancy in america to prevent five cases of death in neonates now

01:44:54.358 --> 01:44:57.681
We don't even know if giving it at birth, I mean while you're pregnant, is making it... It's weird, right?

01:44:57.721 --> 01:45:06.970
Because the flip side of this is that Mike Yeadon is saying that it's the foreign proteins that we're being sensitized to.

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:10.133
It's the food that we're being sensitized to by these injections.

01:45:10.573 --> 01:45:14.757
And they've been doing it from the very beginning, whereas this guy is telling us it's not that way at all.

01:45:14.797 --> 01:45:15.658
It's something different.

01:45:16.771 --> 01:45:18.372
It's the aluminum, not the protein.

01:45:18.392 --> 01:45:20.293
So it's aluminum, it's mercury, but I'm not anti-fish if I'm anti-mercury.

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:23.015
It's the aluminum, it's the MMR, it's the black kids, it's the lion, it's the frickin bullshit show.

01:45:42.512 --> 01:45:44.654
None of them look at long-term developmental consequences.

01:45:44.674 --> 01:45:46.795
None of them are looking at anything that matters as far as brain development.

01:45:47.516 --> 01:45:47.996
The flu shot.

01:45:48.056 --> 01:45:49.518
We have studies showing that it's causing problems.

01:45:49.738 --> 01:45:50.919
Gestational diabetes, eclampsia.

01:45:51.119 --> 01:45:54.201
And the study just published in JAMA this January, Journal of the American Medical Association.

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:56.383
If you read the news quotes, it says, flu shot safe.

01:45:56.943 --> 01:45:57.704
But go read the article.

01:45:58.004 --> 01:46:00.987
If you get the flu shot in the first trimester, you have an increased risk of autism in your infant.

01:46:01.127 --> 01:46:02.168
And we know the mechanisms of this.

01:46:02.208 --> 01:46:03.008
It's maternal activation.

01:46:03.028 --> 01:46:08.272
You cannot activate mom's immune system while that brain is developing and not cause problems, whether it's through natural infection or vaccination.

01:46:10.134 --> 01:46:17.157
So what an remarkable thing to say that you can't activate the mom's immune system without inflaming the baby's brain.

01:46:19.258 --> 01:46:25.080
So he doesn't really say that vaccination of pregnant people is hurting kids.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.522
He just says that he's seen it sometimes, but I'm not smart enough to know and draw any conclusions.

01:46:33.188 --> 01:46:41.073
I mean, it has been really bad for pregnancy to hit somebody in the stomach with a baseball bat in the ninth month, but you know, I'm not sure that it's bad.

01:46:41.253 --> 01:46:45.916
I just know that sometimes when you do it, those babies are sometimes born shitty.

01:46:47.657 --> 01:46:54.521
So I don't know how to draw any conclusions about this, but I know we need to do the studies and I know we need to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:54.581 --> 01:46:59.925
in as close to the White House as possible so that we can do this research and figure this out.

01:47:02.386 --> 01:47:10.425
We have plenty of studies now that explain the mechanism of maternal... Remember that one of the things that Dell said about this guy is that this guy's got a really influential YouTube channel.

01:47:14.679 --> 01:47:15.539
activation of the immune system.

01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:18.040
My next pet peeve is hepatitis B for newborns.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:25.282
Every day in America, moms are signing in to have their babies in the hospital, not realizing that that signature is giving the hospital permission to do routine care.

01:47:25.782 --> 01:47:30.984
And routine care in America is the moment that baby's born, and you have just a few minutes of skin time, hopefully, with mom and baby.

01:47:31.224 --> 01:47:39.066
The nurses take that baby over, dry him off, and stab him with hepatitis B. And less than 1 1,000 of the moms have hepatitis B in this country.

01:47:39.146 --> 01:47:43.207
So that means 999 of 1,000 babies are getting this toxic dose of aluminum for no good reason.

01:47:43.684 --> 01:47:46.606
Again, he repeats toxic dose of aluminum.

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:49.509
You see, they're all on a separate stupid script.

01:47:50.009 --> 01:47:51.150
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:53.992
says he's against mercury because that's what the ladies were in.

01:47:54.433 --> 01:47:58.556
And since the ladies said there was mercury in the shots, that's why he got involved in the first place.

01:47:59.597 --> 01:48:00.918
This guy says it's aluminum.

01:48:02.438 --> 01:48:09.401
Peter McCullough says it's neither aluminum nor mercury because he knows the neurological signs of those, and that's not autism.

01:48:10.061 --> 01:48:18.645
This bullshit show will never stop until every one of these people is publicly shamed for the rest of their frickin' fraudulent lives.

01:48:19.451 --> 01:48:21.613
Those of you who aren't aware, hepatitis B is a sexually transmitted disease.

01:48:21.693 --> 01:48:22.853
You catch it from sex and IV drug use.

01:48:23.114 --> 01:48:25.535
I kid around the hospitals that I round in, you know, how many of your babies are having sex?

01:48:25.555 --> 01:48:26.856
Because the ones in my practice, they're not doing that.

01:48:26.876 --> 01:48:28.037
They're not even sharing dirty needles yet.

01:48:28.277 --> 01:48:30.639
I mean, the risk is zero, absolutely zero.

01:48:30.659 --> 01:48:34.001
I sleep like a baby every night making the recommendation not to give the hepatitis B to newborns who don't need it.

01:48:34.242 --> 01:48:35.923
And almost every newborn in this country does not need that.

01:48:36.183 --> 01:48:39.525
Make matters worse, the hepatitis B series being given as infants is not giving lasting protection.

01:48:40.006 --> 01:48:42.427
So when they do need the protection when they're teenagers, they won't have it.

01:48:43.348 --> 01:48:45.209
Every single hepatitis B on the market has a ton of aluminum.

01:48:46.009 --> 01:48:48.510
I'm going to get slightly technical for you on the aluminum issue because this is important.

01:48:48.891 --> 01:48:53.853
We know that neurological problems, developmental delays, autism, all the horrible things we're seeing in our kids is due to toxins.

01:48:54.133 --> 01:48:55.153
It's toxins, toxins, toxins.

01:48:55.173 --> 01:48:56.354
The first chapter in my book deals with this.

01:48:56.854 --> 01:48:59.095
But the aluminum issue is especially problematic.

01:48:59.695 --> 01:49:01.636
The toxins, toxins, toxins.

01:49:02.757 --> 01:49:06.198
I would like to point it out and Mark Kulak is pointing it out too.

01:49:06.258 --> 01:49:07.999
I think it's very legit to point it out.

01:49:08.439 --> 01:49:12.481
As far as I know, when I was growing up, there was a guy who ate a bicycle piece by piece.

01:49:15.322 --> 01:49:20.464
I've also heard the story of a guy who, over the course of his lifetime, basically consumed an entire airplane.

01:49:20.504 --> 01:49:24.606
Although, one of those might be misconstrued as the other.

01:49:24.626 --> 01:49:24.986
I don't know.

01:49:25.046 --> 01:49:27.788
Ripley's Believe It or Not told me one of those things, but it's true.

01:49:28.548 --> 01:49:33.250
It's in the Guinness Book of World Records that you can still check out from your local library.

01:49:35.971 --> 01:49:37.532
You can eat a lot of aluminum.

01:49:38.512 --> 01:49:39.413
I mean, like, a lot.

01:49:40.734 --> 01:49:42.834
but they're talking about injecting it.

01:49:43.055 --> 01:49:54.757
And so right away in 2017, in the presence of Tony Bark, these frauds are on a fraudulent script that probably is very confusing for Tony.

01:49:55.637 --> 01:50:01.319
Probably extremely confusing for Tony because she's like, why in the hell are these people talking like this?

01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:02.459
Why don't they just say it?

01:50:05.714 --> 01:50:07.576
And it makes it harder for her to say it.

01:50:07.636 --> 01:50:17.184
It makes it harder for Brandy to say it, even though at some point in 2016, Brandy was already saying, the big thing you need to think about is the difference between ingestion and injection.

01:50:18.705 --> 01:50:22.529
Which this MD dipshit has still not been able to say.

01:50:23.436 --> 01:50:28.598
I mean, now, all the way in 2025, six years after they murdered Brandy and Tony.

01:50:28.758 --> 01:50:30.899
The FDA has said not to exceed five micrograms per kilogram per day.

01:50:31.179 --> 01:50:32.239
That's dissolved aluminum.

01:50:32.259 --> 01:50:34.320
We learned this from the studies from preemies who were getting hyperal.

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:41.543
They would inject the feeding right into their veins because they couldn't eat and figured out that, oh my goodness, when they were getting more than five micrograms per kilogram per day, they were losing developmental milestones.

01:50:41.563 --> 01:50:42.543
I mean, it was quite significant.

01:50:42.563 --> 01:50:45.024
So the FDA had this guideline, don't exceed five micrograms per kilogram per day.

01:50:45.584 --> 01:50:48.445
The Hepatitis B has 250 micrograms, but that's not all dissolved.

01:50:49.045 --> 01:50:49.766
So the vaccine,

01:50:50.626 --> 01:50:52.248
proponents who want to say that aluminum is safe.

01:50:52.708 --> 01:51:00.076
See, so the whole point is is that he's giving you a whole list of questions that don't matter at all if intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:51:01.357 --> 01:51:10.404
None of these questions matter, none of these nuances, none of these details give- it matters at all if intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:51:10.904 --> 01:51:12.025
Fuck Paul Thomas.

01:51:12.886 --> 01:51:14.627
Seriously, that's where we're at.

01:51:15.048 --> 01:51:16.229
Fuck Paul Thomas.

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:20.452
He has a book with Skyhorse Publishing.

01:51:21.713 --> 01:51:22.654
Fuck Brian Hooker.

01:51:22.694 --> 01:51:25.556
You are a liar, Brian, and you are a piece of shit.

01:51:27.176 --> 01:51:28.658
I'm going to briefly get technical for you on this chart.

01:51:28.818 --> 01:51:30.039
It's the only one I think I'll go over in detail.

01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.843
On this axis is the body burden of aluminum accumulating in the body.

01:51:32.883 --> 01:51:34.324
And this is the child's age for the first year of life.

01:51:34.805 --> 01:51:39.871
And based on one study that showed it was safe to give 26 milligrams per kilogram per day of dissolved aluminum, they made these curves.

01:51:40.051 --> 01:51:41.693
So they're saying you can have that much aluminum in your body.

01:51:41.713 --> 01:51:43.616
If you exceed that, you're going to have problems with development.

01:51:44.136 --> 01:51:48.998
But the issue is they ignored studies that show that you have problems with as low as 3.4 milligrams per kilogram per day.

01:51:49.178 --> 01:51:52.680
So when you redraw those lines, this is what happens every time you do aluminum vaccines.

01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.260
You can see that you are now exceeding.

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:59.843
This is just the dissolved component of aluminum from what you get from your mother, what you get from your food, and what you get from your vaccines, these little blips.

01:52:00.083 --> 01:52:02.024
The entire first year of life, our infants in this country,

01:52:02.475 --> 01:52:19.462
Remember that, of course, Sasha Latupova and Mike Yeadon are supposedly telling us that it's not the aluminum and the mercury, it's all the different, you know, proteins for food and stuff that the, for years and years and years, they've made us allergic to everything.

01:52:20.142 --> 01:52:30.846
That's actually what Mike frickin' Yeadon just said, and cited Sasha Latupova three times, including one time, spelling her traitorous piece of shit name.

01:52:32.762 --> 01:52:40.186
He even was scripted to say that she was born in Russia, even though she frickin' emigrated from you fuckin' crane.

01:52:42.347 --> 01:53:01.577
And took money from Democrats, voted for Hillary Clinton, started a company using data from American University in Rochester, New York, and then sold that piece-of-shit testing company to fucking Pfizer, just like frickin' Mike Yeadon did.

01:53:04.949 --> 01:53:06.930
Gosh, they belong in jail.

01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:13.793
Gosh, they deserve the hardest fruit to be thrown at them while they are in public.

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:16.114
They deserve rotten vegetables.

01:53:16.874 --> 01:53:22.516
They deserve rotten roadkill thrown at them and dog shit and paper bags.

01:53:28.519 --> 01:53:31.080
Are in a level of toxic exposure for aluminum.

01:53:32.145 --> 01:53:35.068
The biological half-life of the injected aluminum is seven years.

01:53:35.429 --> 01:53:38.732
And we give 10 vaccines that have aluminum in the first year of life, infants.

01:53:38.752 --> 01:53:39.393
10 different vaccines.

01:53:39.994 --> 01:53:41.676
Now here's what people don't understand, and this is critical.

01:53:42.056 --> 01:53:44.819
The aluminum in vaccines is little tiny pieces of metal.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:45.660
They don't dissolve.

01:53:45.961 --> 01:53:46.782
They're called nanoparticles.

01:53:46.802 --> 01:53:49.244
They're small enough to be in solution, but they're too big to dissolve.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:51.607
So very little of the aluminum actually dissolves into solution.

01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.910
It goes into the muscle.

01:53:52.930 --> 01:53:54.631
And those of us who give vaccines, we see this every day.

01:53:54.871 --> 01:53:56.172
Redness, swelling, big reactions.

01:53:56.472 --> 01:53:57.012
What is going on?

01:53:57.252 --> 01:54:00.994
The body's immune system is saying, whoa, there's this foreign metal that has no biological function in the body.

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:02.054
Aluminum is not used for anything.

01:54:02.514 --> 01:54:04.455
So our white blood cells, like Pac-Man, gobble up the aluminum.

01:54:04.515 --> 01:54:05.335
And white blood cells can do what?

01:54:05.435 --> 01:54:07.056
They can move through the body.

01:54:07.076 --> 01:54:09.417
So this is the way we transport aluminum to the bone, kidneys, and what?

01:54:09.757 --> 01:54:09.977
Brain.

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:11.758
White blood cells only live two, three months.

01:54:12.118 --> 01:54:13.679
So they die, and they release what?

01:54:13.759 --> 01:54:14.699
Those nanoparticles of aluminum.

01:54:14.719 --> 01:54:16.380
It's a Trojan horse that takes the aluminum right to the brain.

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.680
And that's what that graph over there.

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.341
Macrophage is transporting aluminum to the brain.

01:54:20.297 --> 01:54:22.760
And I think that that's absolutely wrong.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.702
I think that that's so wrong.

01:54:25.882 --> 01:54:27.564
I think that's a scripted lie.

01:54:27.704 --> 01:54:35.071
I will tell you why, because I don't think immunological cells are allowed to cross the blood-brain barrier.

01:54:35.814 --> 01:54:39.096
Could be wrong, but I think that this is scripted bullshit.

01:54:39.137 --> 01:54:43.340
Macrophages are not taking the aluminum up to the brain.

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:44.701
That's bullshit.

01:54:44.741 --> 01:54:53.848
But what might be happening is that some form of leaky endothelium is being created by the aluminum.

01:54:54.528 --> 01:54:59.312
being created by the immune reaction from the other things that are being put in there.

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:07.758
I don't know exactly, but this idea that the aluminum is being transported to the brain by macrophages, I'm not buying that one.

01:55:08.299 --> 01:55:09.560
I'm not buying that one at all.

01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:16.203
And I think that this is a way for them to tell a limited spectrum of debate story about how they know the mechanism.

01:55:16.723 --> 01:55:22.225
And so all they need to do is get the fucking aluminum out and then these things would be fine.

01:55:22.665 --> 01:55:28.128
Doesn't it sound like that's what dipshit Paul Thomas has been saying for the last 15 minutes?

01:55:28.188 --> 01:55:37.612
That the aluminum, the aluminum, the aluminum, just kind of like the way that Mike Eden said Sasha, Sasha, Sasha, scripted pieces of shit.

01:55:39.881 --> 01:55:42.204
of 13,000 patients, 300 kids with autism.

01:55:42.724 --> 01:55:48.090
Just this last week, I had a new family join my practice, 11-year-old twins, and they were severely autistic, barely verbal.

01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:49.231
And I said, well, tell me the story.

01:55:49.652 --> 01:55:53.816
Perfectly healthy, happy, interactive, starting to talk, 15-month-olds, got the MMR, regressed into autism.

01:55:53.976 --> 01:55:55.458
I have heard that story at least 200 times.

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.441
I think this is also a lie.

01:56:00.103 --> 01:56:00.603
Twins

01:56:01.741 --> 01:56:07.463
Getting the MMR and regressing into autism is actually probably a lie.

01:56:07.483 --> 01:56:08.623
And you know why it's a lie?

01:56:09.103 --> 01:56:13.945
Because that's a lie that leads right to the envenomental and genetic causes of autism.

01:56:14.005 --> 01:56:17.026
And since they're twins, it must be fucking genetic!

01:56:17.246 --> 01:56:18.646
Fuck you, Paul Thomas!

01:56:19.126 --> 01:56:20.647
You lying piece of shit!

01:56:22.745 --> 01:56:34.277
Contrast that to the Vaxxed movie where a mom has two kids, one that's an exceptional girl and one that's an autistic son, a black kid.

01:56:36.179 --> 01:56:37.641
What a monster this guy is.

01:56:38.114 --> 01:56:39.315
You know, once or twice you can say it's a coincidence.

01:56:39.435 --> 01:56:40.895
A hundred times, come on, something's going on.

01:56:40.935 --> 01:56:42.416
Well, aluminum is not in the MMR.

01:56:42.436 --> 01:56:43.417
So you're saying what's going on there?

01:56:43.717 --> 01:56:48.359
Well, the MMR vaccine activates a protein, the MCP1 protein, and it basically moves aluminum around.

01:56:48.379 --> 01:56:49.700
And it's like pouring gasoline on the fire.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.041
So remember, we've transported the aluminum to the brain and then you get that MMR shot.

01:56:53.242 --> 01:56:54.542
And I think this is a big explanation.

01:56:55.443 --> 01:56:56.903
Oh my shit.

01:56:57.364 --> 01:57:06.028
He's telling you that the MMR activates some protein that we're never going to talk about again and moves the fricking aluminum around.

01:57:13.089 --> 01:57:14.691
I did not expect this to happen.

01:57:15.752 --> 01:57:16.812
But I'm enraged.

01:57:18.274 --> 01:57:21.297
Because this is absolutely scripted bullshit.

01:57:21.457 --> 01:57:24.780
It is scripted, scripted, scripted frickin' bullshit.

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:38.232
And if I could sit down and talk to this guy, I could make him look like such a scripted liar by asking him very simple questions that would reveal his incredible lack of understanding of the script he's on.

01:57:39.173 --> 01:57:48.615
He has no idea the kind of thin ice that they have put him on, and he's been on this thin ice until right now, when we break it.

01:57:50.136 --> 01:57:56.797
Paul Thomas is a frickin' traitor to America's grandkids and to grandkids all around the frickin' world.

01:57:58.038 --> 01:58:05.919
He's as bad as Mary Holland, he's as bad as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., except he should have professionally fuckin' known better.

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.740
And in fact, he probably does.

01:58:09.363 --> 01:58:11.604
for why we see so many kids regressing after that particular vaccine.

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:14.365
We're sort of loading the gun with all the aluminum, and then we're pulling the trigger with the MMR.

01:58:15.605 --> 01:58:22.108
It's really important to understand that brain development, I've got a little graph up there on synaptogenesis, it is exploding from birth through the entire early childhood.

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:28.370
The synapses are forming, the connections are being made, there's synaptic pruning, and the myelination, the covering of those nerves, is happening as the child grows.

01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:32.711
So it is a critical time not to be messing around with our immune system and adding a boatload of toxins.

01:58:33.132 --> 01:58:34.292
Now one of the most important...

01:58:35.029 --> 01:58:36.931
interesting, imprecise thing to say.

01:58:36.992 --> 01:58:41.958
There's all this synapse formation and then he casually throws in pruning.

01:58:46.641 --> 01:58:55.329
I mean, I can't even begin to say how frustrating it is to hear somebody bullshit script their way through any level of neurobiology at all.

01:58:55.829 --> 01:59:02.215
Anytime anybody brings up the brain and I realize they are reading a script, I get vomitous, like really nauseated.

01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:07.219
And this is a guy who just read something and he has no fucking idea what he just said.

01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.001
Paul Thomas, you are a fraud.

01:59:11.075 --> 01:59:17.241
And I will spend the rest of my life exposing you as I will spend the rest of my life exposing the rest of the frauds.

01:59:30.234 --> 01:59:34.996
Anyway, what they did was surveyed kids and looked at the various health reasons between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

01:59:35.276 --> 01:59:41.518
And what they found was for all the neurodevelopmental issues, allergies, autoimmune asthma, significant increase in these disorders in the vaccinated group.

01:59:41.898 --> 01:59:42.858
We need more such studies.

01:59:43.218 --> 01:59:45.619
I mean, it's just so vital that this happened.

01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.960
So, this is a lot of information.

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:55.483
Why do we need more of those studies if his studies already show it to a p-value of 0001, whatever?

01:59:57.958 --> 02:00:02.443
Why do we need more studies if kids are being killed every year?

02:00:02.944 --> 02:00:06.547
Why do we need more studies if kids are being paralyzed every year?

02:00:07.008 --> 02:00:11.313
Why do we need more studies, Paul fucking traitor Thomas piece of shit?

02:00:12.894 --> 02:00:13.315
What should we do?

02:00:14.591 --> 02:00:15.872
First, we need to let parents be parents.

02:00:16.332 --> 02:00:17.692
We need to let parents protect their children.

02:00:18.252 --> 02:00:20.713
You cannot protect your children if you're not given informed consent.

02:00:21.194 --> 02:00:25.255
Informed consent means you need to be told the risks, the benefits, and the alternatives.

02:00:25.275 --> 02:00:31.678
The risks, the benefits, and the alternatives to intramuscular injection is all a mythology.

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:35.359
And this is a scripted traitor on a traitorous script.

02:00:35.859 --> 02:00:39.501
And he deserves the worst life for the rest of his life.

02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:40.861
That's really the truth.

02:00:41.101 --> 02:00:43.022
That's what I believe with all of my heart.

02:00:44.850 --> 02:00:49.777
I hope these people suffer greatly in the next 20 years, and I hope it's mostly shame.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.602
public shame for them and their families.

02:00:54.903 --> 02:00:57.445
Alternatives when it comes to vaccines has to be not doing it.

02:00:57.725 --> 02:00:58.826
Otherwise you're not getting consent at all.

02:00:58.946 --> 02:00:59.386
It's mandated.

02:00:59.586 --> 02:01:02.949
So we cannot have vaccine mandates as what we are seeing in this country and it's rolling out across.

02:01:03.369 --> 02:01:04.170
So here it is.

02:01:04.410 --> 02:01:07.012
The vaccine mandates are the fucking problem.

02:01:07.492 --> 02:01:08.593
This is the joke.

02:01:08.693 --> 02:01:09.714
This is the narrative.

02:01:09.754 --> 02:01:18.881
This is what leads to the big top tent of health freedom where we are fighting for rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies and courage over fricking fear.

02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:20.202
Stop lying.

02:01:21.783 --> 02:01:23.744
Maybe we should have a platform like CHD.

02:01:43.015 --> 02:01:46.177
That's what he's advocating for right now, CHD and the Defender.

02:01:46.337 --> 02:01:48.118
That's what he's setting up right now.

02:01:48.539 --> 02:01:50.640
Because it's one year before it happens, right?

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.001
Whistleblower at the CDC.

02:01:52.021 --> 02:01:54.423
He was sitting on a stack of data, and he couldn't get it published.

02:01:54.443 --> 02:01:58.886
In fact, not only that, but his team had a trashcan party to get rid of this data, and he decided no.

02:01:58.926 --> 02:01:59.646
And they changed the study design.

02:01:59.666 --> 02:02:00.487
We're going to hear more about that.

02:02:01.207 --> 02:02:05.550
Heroes like Brian Hooker, who's going to follow me here today, who pursued this with a vengeance and actually published that data.

02:02:05.891 --> 02:02:09.113
I remember when that came out in 2014 and I'm so excited and I thought, I wonder if this will stick.

02:02:09.353 --> 02:02:10.554
Sure enough, it's retracted.

02:02:10.814 --> 02:02:11.775
Okay, this is what's happening.

02:02:11.795 --> 02:02:12.936
We do not have freedom in our press.

02:02:13.176 --> 02:02:18.280
It was retracted because the statistics that were used were pathetic and sad.

02:02:19.901 --> 02:02:22.143
Because Brian Hooker is a scripted failure.

02:02:23.683 --> 02:02:26.004
Brian Hooker presented to the Congress today.

02:02:26.044 --> 02:02:26.685
Did you know that?

02:02:26.885 --> 02:02:31.327
Brian Hooker and Polly Tommy, who are in front of Congress today.

02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:40.233
And finally, in the 1950s, we rejected the junk science of the tobacco industry, and we implemented massive studies comparing smokers and non-smokers.

02:02:40.573 --> 02:02:42.074
That decision saved millions of lives.

02:02:42.674 --> 02:02:46.016
We must do the same, comparing health outcomes of vaccinated and non-vaccinated children.

02:02:46.516 --> 02:02:52.039
We, the doctors, the scientists, legislators, researchers, and journalists, we had the courage to do this before.

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:52.940
We must do it again.

02:02:54.855 --> 02:02:55.055
Thank you.

02:03:17.398 --> 02:03:19.820
You're going to hear more science because that's what this is about.

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:21.021
Science gets published.

02:03:21.561 --> 02:03:22.442
Science can be discussed.

02:03:23.023 --> 02:03:23.663
Science can be read.

02:03:23.883 --> 02:03:24.724
Science can be understood.

02:03:25.365 --> 02:03:27.586
It does not fit on bumper stickers into simple little slogans.

02:03:28.047 --> 02:03:29.148
And I think that's part of the problem.

02:03:29.628 --> 02:03:30.549
It actually does.

02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:36.434
It fits on very little tiny bumper stickers and it's going to look great on a fricking billboard.

02:03:36.954 --> 02:03:38.856
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:03:39.216 --> 02:03:40.637
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:03:40.757 --> 02:03:43.419
It was always transfection and that made it a crime.

02:03:43.959 --> 02:03:47.661
They frickin' renamed old shitty technology.

02:03:48.982 --> 02:03:50.603
I can fit all of that on a billboard.

02:03:51.043 --> 02:03:59.128
And I can definitely fit those individual phrases on a nice bumper sticker that's readable from a few car lengths away, you frickin' cowardly fraud.

02:03:59.768 --> 02:04:02.050
You piece of shit Dell Big Tree.

02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:03.851
I'm suffering from here in America.

02:04:04.331 --> 02:04:06.032
Next speaker, Dr. Brian Hooker.

02:04:06.772 --> 02:04:11.836
is an associate professor of biology at Simpson University in Redding, California, where he specializes in microbiology and biotechnology.

02:04:12.136 --> 02:04:14.017
He also teaches chemistry at Shasta College.

02:04:14.558 --> 02:04:25.326
Brian spent over 15 years as a bioengineer and the team leader for the high-throughput biology team and operations manager of the DOE Genomes to Life Center for Molecular and Cellular Systems at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

02:04:26.536 --> 02:04:30.901
He worked for the National Genome Initiative.

02:04:30.961 --> 02:04:42.294
He worked for the National Genome Initiative at the Department of Fucking Energy, exactly where Mark Lander and Francis Collins and

02:04:42.654 --> 02:04:45.655
Kevin McKernan worked under the Human Genome Project.

02:04:45.695 --> 02:04:49.756
The Department of Energy is the highest security in America.

02:04:50.276 --> 02:04:53.117
This guy worked there for 16 fucking years.

02:04:53.517 --> 02:04:58.259
There's no way you can convince me that Brian Hooker is not a placed liar.

02:04:58.699 --> 02:05:10.327
that he is a placed performer just like Pauly, just like Andrew Wakefield, just like Mary Holland, just like the dipshit Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and just like this asshole.

02:05:10.887 --> 02:05:16.691
If you can't see it now, then America is definitely going to be ruined by this theater.

02:05:17.284 --> 02:05:22.427
Dr. Hooker also managed applied plant and fungal molecular biology research projects at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

02:05:22.788 --> 02:05:25.809
He served as research director for the plant biotechnology company Phytogenics.

02:05:28.331 --> 02:05:33.795
He has done plant genetics just like Kevin McKernan is doing.

02:05:33.935 --> 02:05:36.376
Plant genetics to make fucking medicine.

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:38.037
Fuck Kevin McKernan.

02:05:38.578 --> 02:05:38.798
Fuck

02:05:39.795 --> 02:05:40.497
Brian Hooker.

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.567
They are traitors to our grandchildren.

02:05:43.607 --> 02:05:45.151
They are part of a long con.

02:05:45.192 --> 02:05:47.258
They've been lying to us for more than a decade.

02:05:48.385 --> 02:05:56.733
co-inventor of five patents, recipient of the Battelle Entrepreneurial Award in 2001, and a Federal Laboratory Consortium Recognition Award in 1999 for his work on reactive transport in three dimensions.

02:05:56.973 --> 02:06:01.697
The breadth of Hooker's over 60 science and engineering papers have been published in internationally recognized peer-reviewed journals.

02:06:02.157 --> 02:06:04.940
Dr. Hooker also has a 19-year-old son with autism.

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:10.245
And Dr. Hooker cannot say autism in 2013, but this is 2017, so he's their bitch now.

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:25.423
And it's my honor to bring you up here, Dr. Hooker, because your work has inspired and changed my life forever.

02:06:25.943 --> 02:06:26.284
It's an honor.

02:06:26.304 --> 02:06:26.544
Thank you.

02:06:31.326 --> 02:06:35.508
I mean, seriously, can we blow any more sunshine up this guy's fraudulent ass?

02:06:38.783 --> 02:06:39.243
Thank you very much.

02:06:39.283 --> 02:06:40.064
Thank you for being here today.

02:06:41.185 --> 02:06:52.252
As Del said, I have a 19-year-old son who was injured by his infant vaccines, primarily his 15-month vaccines, where he received three vaccines, one with a live active virus, all while he had an ear infection.

02:06:52.953 --> 02:06:55.695
And very, very quickly, he declined into the world of autism.

02:06:56.135 --> 02:07:02.219
Now don't forget that one of the stories that Suzanne Humphreys tells is that you should never give a vaccine when somebody is sick.

02:07:02.719 --> 02:07:10.723
And this is also what he said on that podcast when he also said, hey, you know, I don't use, I don't do that because autism is not the right word.

02:07:11.124 --> 02:07:12.124
Now he's not doing that.

02:07:12.204 --> 02:07:13.605
Now his son has autism.

02:07:18.488 --> 02:07:23.596
and was initially diagnosed with autism and then toxic encephalopathy by the time he was two years old.

02:07:24.177 --> 02:07:32.609
To this day, he is nonverbal, has very, very severe issues medically, and also has very, very difficult time in terms of understanding communication.

02:07:33.810 --> 02:07:34.910
I have studied the CDC since 2001.

02:07:35.070 --> 02:07:37.651
The CDC is responsible for vaccine safety.

02:07:37.671 --> 02:07:47.434
They are responsible for post-market surveillance of the vaccinations that are on the recommended schedule, which, by the way, the CDC, through the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, is responsible for putting together.

02:07:47.974 --> 02:07:57.137
That schedule, at this point, includes over 60 vaccines given to infants all the way through 18 years of age, and that comprises 15 different vaccine formulations.

02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.602
When I started to study the CDC, I was alarmed.

02:08:00.042 --> 02:08:07.170
I saw instances of fraud, malfeasance, data cherry-picking, and I contacted the CDC directly starting in 2001, 2002.

02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:11.515
One of the scientists that I was directed to was Dr. William Thompson.

02:08:12.016 --> 02:08:15.059
At that point in time, Dr. William Thompson was very, very dismissive of my concerns.

02:08:15.079 --> 02:08:17.261
And in fact, at one point... Did he say diagnose?

02:08:17.281 --> 02:08:18.443
I'll go back and listen to that.

02:08:18.803 --> 02:08:19.324
and she's fine.

02:08:19.524 --> 02:08:20.044
What's your problem?

02:08:20.324 --> 02:08:28.872
He's responsible for vaccines, very, very severe issues medically and then toxic encephalopathy by the time he was two years old.

02:08:29.433 --> 02:08:30.634
To this day, he is non-verbal.

02:08:30.654 --> 02:08:32.495
He has 15-month vaccines where he received.

02:08:32.916 --> 02:08:33.676
Thank you for being here today.

02:08:34.817 --> 02:08:45.812
As Del said, I have a 19-year-old son who was injured by his infant vaccines, primarily his 15-month vaccines, where he received three vaccines, one with a live active virus, all while he had an ear infection.

02:08:46.513 --> 02:08:51.260
And very, very quickly, he declined into the world of autism and was initially diagnosed with autism.

02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:54.772
and then toxic encephalopathy by the time he was two years old.

02:08:55.613 --> 02:09:00.536
I think that's pretty extraordinary that in 2013 he did not use the word autism.

02:09:00.977 --> 02:09:02.798
He doesn't like the word autism.

02:09:03.378 --> 02:09:04.779
He was vaccine damaged.

02:09:04.839 --> 02:09:08.162
He was neurologically damaged and he doesn't like the word autism.

02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:19.445
And now his son regressed into autism, was diagnosed with autism, and then he says some other complicated shit about his brain being toxified.

02:09:19.786 --> 02:09:28.531
To this day, he is nonverbal, has very, very severe issues medically, and also has very, very difficult time in terms of understanding communication.

02:09:29.751 --> 02:09:30.852
I have studied the CDC since 2001.

02:09:30.892 --> 02:09:33.594
The CDC is responsible for vaccine safety.

02:09:33.614 --> 02:09:43.379
They are responsible for post-market surveillance of the vaccinations that are on the recommended schedule, which, by the way, the CDC, through the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, is responsible for putting together.

02:09:43.919 --> 02:09:53.104
That schedule, at this point, includes over 60 vaccines given to infants all the way through 18 years of age, and that comprises 15 different vaccine formulations.

02:09:54.042 --> 02:09:55.543
When I started to study the CDC, I was alarmed.

02:09:55.983 --> 02:10:00.226
I saw instances of fraud, um, malfeasance, uh, data cherry picking.

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:03.128
And, uh, I contacted the CDC directly starting in 2001, 2002.

02:10:03.288 --> 02:10:07.450
One of the scientists that I was directed to, uh, was Dr. William Thompson.

02:10:07.951 --> 02:10:10.993
At that point in time, Dr. William Thompson was very, very dismissive of my concerns.

02:10:11.013 --> 02:10:15.275
And in fact, at one point said, look, my daughter received all the same vaccines as your son and she's fine.

02:10:15.475 --> 02:10:16.016
What's your problem?

02:10:16.835 --> 02:10:19.656
And to which I proceeded to take him apart scientifically.

02:10:19.696 --> 02:10:21.237
I couldn't let an opportunity like that go to waste.

02:10:22.237 --> 02:10:29.040
But in 2004, CDC suspended any conversations that I had with scientists because of my son's status in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.841
They said, in effect, I was suing the CDC.

02:10:31.181 --> 02:10:34.523
And so therefore, I was no longer able to contact CDC scientists.

02:10:34.783 --> 02:10:38.084
As my attorney said at the time, I can contact any federal employee I want to at any point in time.

02:10:38.484 --> 02:10:39.945
However, the CDC said, yes, that was correct.

02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:42.446
But the CDC would no longer answer my emails or my phone calls.

02:10:42.826 --> 02:10:44.507
So my only recourse was the Freedom of Information Act.

02:10:45.087 --> 02:10:59.093
And from 2004 to the present, I've submitted over 100 Freedom of Information Act requests and I've received over half a million pages worth of documents from the CDC, all showing a pattern in specifically in the vaccine safety division to deny vaccine injury at all costs.

02:11:00.914 --> 02:11:10.178
I would say one of the reasons why you shouldn't be so happy to hear encephalopathy and autism in the same sentence is because then it confounds the two when really it's just encephalopathy.

02:11:11.179 --> 02:11:11.919
That's the problem.

02:11:12.614 --> 02:11:14.895
It's just brain inflammation.

02:11:14.976 --> 02:11:16.356
It's just toxic.

02:11:16.416 --> 02:11:17.357
It's just shit.

02:11:17.457 --> 02:11:21.520
It's just, there's a million explanations for it that are not autism.

02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:28.864
It's just using the word autism creates this sort of amorphous bullshit fog.

02:11:30.685 --> 02:11:31.346
Nothing to see here.

02:11:32.574 --> 02:11:33.635
Vaccines are safe and effective.

02:11:33.995 --> 02:11:40.960
And if a vaccine adverse event comes up, then dubious statistical methods are made to obviate that particularly strong statistically significant effect.

02:11:42.321 --> 02:11:47.225
In November of 2013, I again met or actually received a phone call out of the blue from Dr. William Thompson.

02:11:48.266 --> 02:11:50.567
We initiated conversations very soon after.

02:11:50.587 --> 02:11:55.791
We traded voicemail messages, emails, and then finally got on the phone in late November 2013.

02:11:57.555 --> 02:12:03.225
What I heard from Dr. Thompson in 2013 was completely different than the initial conversations that I had with Dr. Thompson.

02:12:03.746 --> 02:12:08.774
Dr. Thompson presented the CDC's Vaccine Safety Division as a conflicted agency that had no business

02:12:09.929 --> 02:12:16.512
researching or protecting the children, the infants, and the youth of the United States against vaccine adverse events.

02:12:17.072 --> 02:12:27.137
The CDC buys $4.1 billion of childhood vaccines every year, redistributes them from the state public health departments, and relies on reimbursement of those vaccines directly from the state's public health departments.

02:12:27.157 --> 02:12:28.037
They are a vaccine business.

02:12:28.317 --> 02:12:32.759
The CDC also holds 56 patents on childhood, infant, and adult vaccinations.

02:12:33.019 --> 02:12:34.300
They are a vaccine business.

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.320
They are a vaccine company.

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.241
They have no business.

02:12:36.969 --> 02:13:01.723
It's interesting to note that the CDC is currently headed by somebody who helped develop ARPA-H, and that our Health and Human Services Secretary, who has some jurisdiction over that, has done absolutely jack shit with regard to the CDC, is doing nothing about the CDC, and has put Robert frickin' Malone on the ACIP committee.

02:13:03.143 --> 02:13:09.091
Robert Malone, the scripted and scripting traitor behind all of these shitheads.

02:13:11.213 --> 02:13:16.380
Think about this very carefully and behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:18.042
is this fat fraud.

02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:43.484
And I'm trying to be mean to you, Brian, because you're a piece of shit, because you were part of the firing of me from the fraudulent CHD, because you tried to lead me on for six months with a high salary and tried to get me to shut up, because you're part of this piece of shit, fake health freedom movement, Brian Hooker, and you deserve the rest of your life to be basically shame.

02:13:43.984 --> 02:13:46.386
...extorting the safety of vaccines in the United States.

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:49.507
This is a captured agency.

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:53.909
The agency is in bed with the pharmaceutical industry.

02:13:54.629 --> 02:14:06.574
Many of the representatives from the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices hold joint appointments or receive money directly from the vaccine industry, and they have no business voting vaccines onto the schedule or evaluating the safety of such vaccines.

02:14:07.995 --> 02:14:15.818
One of the things that Dr. Thompson revealed to me very, very quickly was a specific instance of fraud concerning the MMR vaccine, and that is primarily the subject of the movie Vaxxed.

02:14:17.077 --> 02:14:20.738
And essentially what happened is Dr. Thompson was the lead statistician on that particular study.

02:14:21.238 --> 02:14:27.279
When he initially ran the numbers, he saw a strong statistically significant effect in African-Americans who received the MMR vaccine on time.

02:14:27.299 --> 02:14:31.860
That was anywhere between 12 and 18 months of age versus those African-Americans who received the MMR vaccine after.

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:43.602
I'm pretty sure that he and Pauly Tommy were in the Congress today, retelling this story 10 years later, because this is a hamster wheel from hell.

02:14:45.592 --> 02:14:51.818
and the hamster wheel from hell is composed of coordinated liars on a very shitty script.

02:14:54.881 --> 02:14:57.604
Brian Hooker is a traitor to American grandkids.

02:14:57.824 --> 02:14:58.525
Three years of age.

02:14:59.704 --> 02:15:03.428
The effect was so strong and so statistically significant that it could not be obviated.

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:15.942
And Dr. Thompson himself said to me, he said, you've got to understand when CDC scientists see an effect that they don't like or see an effect that would point an adverse event towards a specific vaccine, they get the scientists in the room and they work in the room until they can make that effect go away.

02:15:16.943 --> 02:15:19.226
In this case, they worked very, very hard to make the effect go away.

02:15:20.467 --> 02:15:23.228
Doesn't it almost seem like there isn't an effect everywhere?

02:15:23.328 --> 02:15:25.168
Just certain effects are made to go away.

02:15:25.248 --> 02:15:27.969
When they find an effect, they make it go away.

02:15:28.369 --> 02:15:36.512
So he's actually obfuscating the truth, which is that there are expected side effects from every dumb intramuscular injection.

02:15:37.625 --> 02:15:57.144
Remember, this is the same asshole who wasn't able to say transfection in 2020, wasn't able to say it in 21, or 22, or 23, or 24, or 25, even after employing me as a staff scientist under him in his own department and having me do a whole fucking podcast about it, he still can't say it.

02:15:57.565 --> 02:16:00.147
Yes, I did a whole fucking podcast with

02:16:00.828 --> 02:16:14.912
Brian frickin' Hooker about the fact that they should have called it transfection from the very beginning, not really understanding that he worked for the Department of Energy for 16 years using transformation and transfection to try and make plants make medicine.

02:16:16.773 --> 02:16:19.414
This is a fraudulent piece of shit cunt.

02:16:20.494 --> 02:16:24.135
And if I ever see this guy in person again, I'll have a hard time knocking him out.

02:16:24.535 --> 02:16:29.837
The only reason why I wouldn't take a swing is because I know his son is also actually a real person.

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:35.121
with a real piece of shit dad, could not make the effect go away.

02:16:35.881 --> 02:16:47.005
And decisions were made by higher ups, primarily Dr. Colleen Boyle, Dr. Frank DiStefano, and Dr. Marshall and you're in Alsop that they would take the offending data and they would in September 2002 put this offending data in a trash can.

02:16:47.085 --> 02:16:52.967
They met on a Saturday in the afternoon and they took all the information that showed the African American effect with the MMR vaccine and they threw it away.

02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:56.772
Fortunately for us, Dr. Thompson retained an electronic copy of those records.

02:16:56.792 --> 02:17:01.356
Those records were then shared with me between November 2013 and September 2014.

02:17:01.517 --> 02:17:07.462
He shared tens of thousands of pages of documents that showed not only a strong statistically significant effect for the MMR vaccine.

02:17:08.223 --> 02:17:09.244
And what does it do?

02:17:10.064 --> 02:17:11.044
What does it do?

02:17:11.124 --> 02:17:19.067
What it allows him to do is get in front of Tony Bark and get in front of Brandy Vaughn because those people just have biology and stuff.

02:17:19.427 --> 02:17:21.908
They just have their experience and stuff.

02:17:21.948 --> 02:17:25.189
But I've got the leaked document, the leaked shit.

02:17:25.529 --> 02:17:26.970
I got the numbers, man.

02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:28.890
I got the numbers, man.

02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:30.771
Stop lying!

02:17:31.371 --> 02:17:39.134
It's like when Charles Rixey came to my house in January of 2022 to tell me that he's got the diffuse proposal, man.

02:17:43.692 --> 02:17:44.833
It's a fucking joke.

02:17:45.114 --> 02:17:51.540
And Kevin McKernan goes on a podcast in November of 2024 to say Rixey's got the diffuse proposal, man.

02:17:52.040 --> 02:18:01.069
And just recently now, I bet they're going to go in front of the Senate and say that Brian Hooker's got the leaked documents from William Thompson, man.

02:18:01.957 --> 02:18:02.357
It's isolated autism.

02:18:02.377 --> 02:18:03.177
In 2025, it became profound autism.

02:18:03.237 --> 02:18:04.258
You profound fraud, Brian Hooker.

02:18:04.278 --> 02:18:06.658
Brian Hooker is one of the most profound fraud men in America.

02:18:28.038 --> 02:18:29.419
And I know him personally.

02:18:29.539 --> 02:18:30.600
He's on my phone.

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:37.846
And if I saw him in person, only my pity for his son would prevent me from knocking him the fuck out with my bare hands.

02:18:39.667 --> 02:18:43.370
And who do not have any type of prior comorbidity, any type of prior diagnosis.

02:18:43.390 --> 02:18:44.331
They haven't had any seizures.

02:18:44.491 --> 02:18:49.915
They don't have mental retardation, but instead it very, very specifically and very, very quickly declined into the world of autism.

02:18:49.935 --> 02:18:51.356
What we would expect to see is regressive autism.

02:18:51.869 --> 02:18:53.269
The world of autism.

02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:55.370
What we would expect to see is regressive.

02:18:55.790 --> 02:19:05.793
The world of autism coming from a jackass liar who didn't use the word autism, didn't like to use the word autism because his son was vaccine injured.

02:19:05.833 --> 02:19:07.333
He was vaccine damaged.

02:19:07.373 --> 02:19:11.575
He was neurologically injured and we don't use the word autism.

02:19:11.615 --> 02:19:12.895
We don't like that word.

02:19:13.395 --> 02:19:16.196
Now they can descend into the world of autism.

02:19:16.576 --> 02:19:17.096
Fuck me.

02:19:17.637 --> 02:19:29.144
And so there was a very, very strong statistically significant effect for the MMR vaccine for those children that received it between 12 and 18 months of age versus those children who opted to delay the MMR vaccine until 36 months of age.

02:19:29.624 --> 02:19:34.967
In order to get rid of this effect, they enacted a protocol which violated their original analysis plan.

02:19:35.888 --> 02:19:42.532
And in this protocol, they got rid of anybody within the cohort, within the study sample that didn't have a valid state of Georgia birth certificate.

02:19:42.892 --> 02:19:43.672
So in other words, they cheated.

02:19:43.833 --> 02:19:45.554
They took the sample size of the

02:19:46.374 --> 02:19:48.355
original study, and they reduced it by 40 percent.

02:19:48.575 --> 02:19:53.337
And that's interesting because that's not actually the story he tells in other interviews.

02:19:53.397 --> 02:20:03.842
In other interviews, he tells the story that what they did was they took away the data from the schools that provided the racial component of it.

02:20:04.343 --> 02:20:12.647
Because he, of course, did the analysis that found out that the MMR shot was hurting black kids, even though I don't think Pauly Tommy

02:20:13.755 --> 02:20:15.136
I don't think her kid is black.

02:20:15.836 --> 02:20:18.177
And I don't think that Paula Aitken's kid is.

02:20:18.297 --> 02:20:24.319
I don't think any of the kids in the original Lancet study from Andrew Wakefield are black kids.

02:20:24.399 --> 02:20:33.542
But in America, the CDC is giving autism to black kids, and this guy's got all the numbers to show you that it's black kids.

02:20:34.963 --> 02:20:36.303
Stop lying!

02:20:40.367 --> 02:20:50.593
Those of us that do statistics for a livelihood and do epidemiology for a livelihood know that when you take your sample size and you- Those of us that do statistics for a livelihood, what a fucking fraud.

02:20:51.374 --> 02:20:55.536
You reduced statistical power, and that's exactly what they did, okay?

02:20:55.676 --> 02:20:56.737
They did it intentionally.

02:20:56.877 --> 02:21:00.539
The reason why they did it was not for the best protection of children in the United States.

02:21:00.559 --> 02:21:01.480
It was essentially to hide an effect.

02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:12.784
Dr. Thompson went on to describe a culture in which he could not publish research showing that thimerosal, the mercury-containing preservative that is still in the flu shot that is administered to pregnant women, causes tics in boys.

02:21:13.464 --> 02:21:16.466
That effect has been affirmed by four studies done by the CDC.

02:21:16.706 --> 02:21:21.547
The Verstratten study in 2003 shows a strong statistically significant effect of tics in boys from thimerosal exposure.

02:21:22.108 --> 02:21:27.530
The Andrews study, which was funded through a funding decision made by CDC, showed the same effect in boys exposed to thimerosal in the UK.

02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:39.799
The Thompson study, which specifically looked at tics diagnosed by diagnosticians who were experts who had been specifically trained in recognizing tics over a three-hour interview period with children, also showed a strong statistically significant effect.

02:21:40.079 --> 02:21:45.424
And then finally, in 2012, the Be Real study showed a strong statistically significant effect for thimerosal in boys.

02:21:45.444 --> 02:21:45.604
Yeah?

02:21:46.584 --> 02:21:55.592
So interesting that Del Bigtree opened by saying that we kill kids every year, that we paralyze kids every year, but Brian Hooker's all about the descent into autism and tics.

02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:01.469
Holy shit, these people are really, they deserve drawn and quartered.

02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:07.219
If this was the early 17 or 1800s, I think we would probably punish them capitally.

02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:13.915
If you go to CDC's website, specific to thimerosal, specific to either thimerosal exposure in general, or thimerosal exposure through the flu shot.

02:22:14.355 --> 02:22:15.976
Thimerosal!

02:22:16.356 --> 02:22:17.077
Here we go!

02:22:17.417 --> 02:22:20.799
We just had Paul Thomas saying that it was aluminum, you shithead!

02:22:21.219 --> 02:22:26.643
And the frickin' protein in the MMR causes the aluminum to move around, you fuckwit!

02:22:27.083 --> 02:22:29.445
Didn't you listen to the previous speaker?

02:22:30.026 --> 02:22:31.487
Now it's thimerosal.

02:22:31.507 --> 02:22:35.031
You know, that thing that Bret Weinstein's dad went over to Denmark to talk about.

02:22:35.411 --> 02:22:38.954
You know, that thing that they reorganized the FDA in the 60s about.

02:22:38.974 --> 02:22:41.056
You know, Hestes-Kieffer and shit.

02:22:41.537 --> 02:22:43.318
What a freaking fraud!

02:22:44.279 --> 02:22:50.703
It today says that the only type of reaction that you would get from thimerosal exposure would be swelling or redness at the injection site.

02:22:50.903 --> 02:22:52.304
It is a big, dirty lie.

02:22:52.825 --> 02:23:05.032
And the fact that CDC has only looked at the MMR vaccine and only looked at thimerosal exposure rather than the totality of the vaccination schedule, rather than other exposures, including aluminum, formaldehyde, and squalene, which are all additives into vaccines, which are poisoned.

02:23:05.352 --> 02:23:08.514
I'm not saying that black kids are not more vulnerable.

02:23:08.554 --> 02:23:12.097
They very well could be more vulnerable from a genetic perspective.

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:29.481
to heavy metals, they could be more vulnerable from the perspective of blood-brain barrier passage, from permeability of the gut, from any number of things, and that would fit right into the wheelhouse of the frickin' Human Genome Project.

02:23:30.042 --> 02:23:35.203
Because if it's black kids, then we gotta look at the genetic predispositions for it.

02:23:37.423 --> 02:23:45.161
And so they're walking you right into the human genome trap, the actual mouth of the beast, by telling you that it's black kids.

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:47.626
Holy shit!

02:23:49.059 --> 02:23:51.381
which are poisoning our children, is an indictment in itself.

02:23:51.741 --> 02:23:57.345
The only reason that the CDC looked at the MMR vaccine was because there was a downturn in the MMR vaccine due to the Wakefield paper in 1998.

02:23:57.766 --> 02:24:08.514
The only reason that CDC looked at thimerosal in vaccines is because Congress ordered them to in an act in the late 1990s regarding adding up the amount of mercury exposure in medicines, including vaccines.

02:24:08.754 --> 02:24:11.216
If they had not been forced to do this, we would not have this information today.

02:24:11.696 --> 02:24:13.518
We need robust vaccine safety.

02:24:13.878 --> 02:24:17.502
We need vaccine safety to be taken completely out of the CDC's hands.

02:24:17.522 --> 02:24:25.089
It's a conflicted agency and it needs to be moved into an independent agency so logical, safe vaccine decisions can be made.

02:24:25.689 --> 02:24:27.591
A separate agency.

02:24:27.651 --> 02:24:30.374
That sounds kind of like undermining the FDA.

02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:36.623
It sounds like another regulatory agency that, you know, will save the day.

02:24:37.064 --> 02:24:40.426
Sounds like a good plan for somebody that might want to run for office.

02:24:40.626 --> 02:24:42.687
Oh my gosh, what a fraud he is.

02:24:42.948 --> 02:24:49.712
The best information, the best and brightest information, which is being censored in the scientific literature, as Dr. Thomas pointed out, can move forward.

02:24:49.893 --> 02:24:50.773
I've experienced this myself.

02:24:50.793 --> 02:24:51.634
I had a paper retracted.

02:24:51.714 --> 02:24:52.654
I stand by my results.

02:24:52.935 --> 02:24:57.778
The actual results will be republished in a book this fall called Controversies in Vaccine Safety by Elsevier Publishers.

02:24:58.038 --> 02:24:59.019
So hopefully that will go out.

02:24:59.359 --> 02:25:00.340
And despite my...

02:25:01.058 --> 02:25:02.419
I bet there wasn't that book.

02:25:02.479 --> 02:25:03.900
I bet that book didn't get published.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:04.740
You see how it works?

02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:13.805
That book is probably the green book that they picked up when Sky Horse Publishing was combined with CHD the year after this.

02:25:16.526 --> 02:25:17.346
Don't worry, Brian.

02:25:17.366 --> 02:25:18.227
We'll publish your book.

02:25:20.475 --> 02:25:23.817
Brian Hooker sold out.

02:25:24.158 --> 02:25:28.981
As efforts to make that particular paper retraction proof, I'm sure there will be rumblings to try to get that paper retracted, too.

02:25:29.081 --> 02:25:35.246
Anything that goes out into the scientific literature that is against CDC dogma that vaccines are safe and effective is subject to retraction.

02:25:36.006 --> 02:25:37.708
And I call out to the press, please

02:25:38.348 --> 02:25:39.189
cover this information.

02:25:39.689 --> 02:25:41.031
Please expose this information.

02:25:41.291 --> 02:25:42.953
We need Dr William Thompson to step forward.

02:25:42.973 --> 02:25:44.534
We need him to testify before Congress.

02:25:44.735 --> 02:25:50.660
We need him to testify before federal courts and vaccine safety scientists and officials in the CDC need to be held.

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:57.487
You know, you know that we don't need him to testify in front of anybody if intramuscular injection is just dumb.

02:25:58.308 --> 02:26:08.711
If intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s, we don't need William Thompson to testify about the black kids that were hurt by the MMR shot.

02:26:09.111 --> 02:26:16.753
We don't need Paul Thomas to explain to us how some component of the MMR vaccine makes the aluminum move around because it's all fucking dumb.

02:26:19.294 --> 02:26:26.576
For the vaccine injuries, for the autism epidemic, for the epidemic of other neurodevelopmental disorders that have been caused by vaccines.

02:26:27.116 --> 02:26:27.556
Thank you very much.

02:26:36.961 --> 02:26:48.064
Okay, now I guess we'll get Rush Medical Presbyterian, former head of the pediatric ER and one of the busiest ERs in America in Chicago, Illinois.

02:26:48.484 --> 02:26:55.346
We'll probably get her up here next because Paul Thomas is kind of a clown and Brian Hooker is just a guy who used to work for the government.

02:26:55.766 --> 02:27:02.148
So finally, we're going to get somebody who threw her career away and spoke out about this and is really pioneering it.

02:27:02.188 --> 02:27:02.828
I'm sure of it.

02:27:03.849 --> 02:27:09.234
Dr. Thompson was the first whistleblower at the CDC, exposed by Brian Hooker, and then represented in my film.

02:27:09.534 --> 02:27:23.849
But since then, we have 12 more scientists in different departments in the CDC that came forward with a letter to all of media in this nation, calling themselves Spider, dealing with the ethics of science, and making the claim that they are being forced to manipulate their data, change their data tables, and do whatever is necessary to protect the industries they're supposed to be investigating.

02:27:24.895 --> 02:27:25.895
That's an incredible claim.

02:27:25.975 --> 02:27:28.796
So now we no longer have just one whistleblower inside the CDC.

02:27:28.816 --> 02:27:40.078
We have 13 top scientists at the most important health agency in this nation and the world crying for help, crying for someone to come in and allow them to do the job that they believe in, that they want to do in protecting the American public.

02:27:40.098 --> 02:27:44.319
And what they're telling us instead, they are protecting the industries they are supposed to be investigating.

02:27:44.679 --> 02:27:46.299
So a real issue with the CDC.

02:27:46.759 --> 02:27:49.300
And I thank you for all of your work, Brian, in helping us bring that forward.

02:27:53.141 --> 02:27:53.861
Next up, Lori.

02:27:55.729 --> 02:28:09.541
They are actually stepping in front of Tony Bark right now because Tony Bark is right there next to the podium watching all these other jackasses waste brain energy and ask dumb questions and cry about themselves.

02:28:11.277 --> 02:28:20.343
Martin Gregory is an independent, hold on a second, my phone just, an independent journalist who writes about natural health and medical freedom for the Wall Street Journal and Health Impact News.

02:28:20.623 --> 02:28:24.926
She's a former investor relations consultant for Wall Street and was graduated with an MBA from Boston University.

02:28:25.486 --> 02:28:32.811
I'd also like to say that she's a third generation journalist, fourth, fourth, with some very esteemed, powerful, wonderful journalists in her family.

02:28:33.632 --> 02:28:34.252
Lori, thank you.

02:28:37.523 --> 02:28:40.325
She descends from a long line of journalists.

02:28:40.405 --> 02:28:44.287
How could that possibly be something that you would brag about at this stage?

02:28:47.548 --> 02:28:51.150
Thank you so much, Del, and thank you to Physicians for Informed Consent for just being.

02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:54.492
Physicians for Informed Consent.

02:28:54.572 --> 02:29:02.036
So that's one of the many grassroots dumbass organizations before CHD and ICANN already exists at this time, but not CHD.

02:29:02.056 --> 02:29:03.417
CHD will come the next year.

02:29:04.224 --> 02:29:06.426
When I was a child, I always wanted to know why.

02:29:07.227 --> 02:29:14.473
Luckily for me, my mother was very used to this line of questioning because my father was a newspaper man back when newspapers actually mattered.

02:29:15.814 --> 02:29:18.317
At the time, they were the only credible source of investigative work.

02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:23.711
That need to know followed me, and today I'm here to tell you that the search for truth is in danger.

02:29:24.612 --> 02:29:29.655
Not because we have less access, but because life is so full and we haven't got time to filter.

02:29:30.475 --> 02:29:36.038
Moreover, these little devices, while empowering in many ways, are constantly competing for our attention.

02:29:36.939 --> 02:29:42.102
Studies show on average you have 24 seconds to capture someone's attention before they click off of your website.

02:29:42.822 --> 02:29:55.466
Maybe that's why, despite the reputation that social media sites like Facebook have, even though they claim to be algorithming out fake news, still feature ads in their sidebar that are known as clickbait, that espouse breaking news that is untrue.

02:29:55.486 --> 02:30:06.529
A perfect example is a well-known post that you will often see on Facebook that will espouse that celebrities like Meryl Streep have been gone too soon, even though we know Meryl Streep's alive and well because she was at the Oscars this year.

02:30:07.650 --> 02:30:09.590
Fake news is the bait that often pulls us off track.

02:30:10.791 --> 02:30:11.231
Hear this well.

02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:16.382
Vaccine injury is not clickbait, nor is it a rainbow unicorn.

02:30:17.383 --> 02:30:17.983
It is very real.

02:30:18.884 --> 02:30:22.526
It's not just autism, and it's hiding in plain sight.

02:30:23.747 --> 02:30:29.931
This binder that I have with me today represents the cases of vaccine injury that were paid out in settlements through the U.S.

02:30:29.951 --> 02:30:31.271
Special Claims Court for 2016.

02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:39.812
It's released every year to the President of Congress, who's also known as the Vice President of the United States.

02:30:40.753 --> 02:30:45.135
This most recent report was issued, as it has been for the past eight years, to former Vice President Joseph Biden.

02:30:46.355 --> 02:30:53.018
What's interesting to me is that none of the mainstream media are even paying attention to this report, much less reporting about it.

02:30:53.759 --> 02:31:00.942
I know this because this year, the report, which historically is released in the second week of January on the US Special Claims Court website, was late.

02:31:02.048 --> 02:31:03.151
It was only when I called the U.S.

02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:08.526
Special Claims Court in mid-February to inquire about the delay that the information was released on the website the next day.

02:31:09.795 --> 02:31:21.223
Granted, the report, which reveals for 2016, actually, that there's an 11% increase in vaccine injuries across the board from 2015, it went from 114 million in payouts to 127 million in payouts.

02:31:21.243 --> 02:31:21.824
That's for one year.

02:31:22.564 --> 02:31:24.466
It's cumbersome, and it's labor intensive.

02:31:25.226 --> 02:31:29.650
That's because the report is issued on a scanned PDF instead of a sortable spreadsheet.

02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:32.212
So me, being foolish and stubborn,

02:31:33.212 --> 02:31:41.280
has to sit and go through and highlight all the cases in the 277 pages, and there's about 10, 11 cases per page, and then hand enter it into a spreadsheet.

02:31:42.962 --> 02:31:43.642
It's working.

02:31:43.662 --> 02:31:47.706
She sounds like Charles Rixey again, you know, just working so hard on her spreadsheet.

02:31:48.945 --> 02:31:56.147
I don't know, I don't think she's a bad guy, but I think she's part of this scripted illusion because she's surrounded by scripted liars.

02:31:56.247 --> 02:32:03.868
And so she thinks she's doing good journalism here by covering Paul Thomas and covering Brian Hooker, but she's not.

02:32:04.388 --> 02:32:09.269
She's doing their job and making it possible for them to succeed in their job.

02:32:09.329 --> 02:32:16.251
Worth it, because buried in these seemingly endless pages is gold.

02:32:17.253 --> 02:32:29.246
In 2015, there was a 400% increase in vaccine injury payouts to Americans, including a 1,188% increase in flu shot payouts alone.

02:32:30.127 --> 02:32:30.627
That's 1,188%.

02:32:30.948 --> 02:32:35.953
I'm certain you'll agree with me that information like this is statistically relevant in the realm of public health.

02:32:37.321 --> 02:32:41.643
I think that's where Aaron Seery and all of his like make all of their money.

02:32:41.703 --> 02:32:47.525
Remember those people are paid before the court case wins and even if it's not winning, they get paid.

02:32:47.925 --> 02:32:49.466
She doesn't have any problem with that.

02:32:49.546 --> 02:32:54.308
She just wants you to know that that the numbers of people getting paid are rising all the time.

02:32:54.408 --> 02:32:59.330
So Aaron Seery is making more and more money because the vaccine schedule is so bad.

02:33:00.407 --> 02:33:10.150
To date, no one has reported this information because, sadly, it contradicts the messaging found in 70% of the advertising that is generated in mainstream media today, which is pharmaceutical companies.

02:33:11.314 --> 02:33:12.654
It's time for the fourth estate to rise up.

02:33:13.475 --> 02:33:14.955
We are an important component of democracy.

02:33:15.715 --> 02:33:17.596
Thomas Jefferson prophetically was aware of this fact.

02:33:18.356 --> 02:33:28.639
As a mom, as a journalist, as a wife, as an American, I implore you, members of the press, do not fall prey to the erosion of the boundary between truth and revenue.

02:33:29.419 --> 02:33:33.220
In an era where false news and truth are swirling in the same river, take a stand.

02:33:34.501 --> 02:33:34.941
Be brave.

02:33:36.221 --> 02:33:40.984
Challenge your editors and your assignment desk to go beyond the hijacked narrative of identity politics.

02:33:41.865 --> 02:33:50.150
Healthcare and industry don't always make for the best bedfellows, but it's up to you, the media, to inform the public about issues like vaccine injury.

02:33:50.870 --> 02:34:01.617
Despite whatever social propaganda or indoctrination narrative may have swayed the public from truth, it's up to you, the gatekeepers, to save and serve democracy from being a footnote in the annals of history.

02:34:08.317 --> 02:34:11.143
I'm just gonna send a text to my son, hold on a second.

02:34:13.464 --> 02:34:14.845
Dr. Judy Mykovitz earned a B.A.

02:34:14.865 --> 02:34:19.408
in chemistry with a specialization in biology from the University of Virginia in 1980 and a Ph.D.

02:34:19.488 --> 02:34:22.050
in biochemistry and molecular biology from George Washington University in 1992.

02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:29.635
Upon graduation from UVA, she went directly to the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland, where she developed purification methods for interferon alpha.

02:34:29.935 --> 02:34:33.057
It was this interferon which was used in first immune therapy treatment for leukemia.

02:34:33.437 --> 02:34:33.998
Her Ph.D.

02:34:34.038 --> 02:34:40.282
thesis defense entitled Negative Regulation of HIV Expression in Monocytes changed the paradigm for therapeutic treatment of HIV.

02:34:40.602 --> 02:34:42.603
For this work, she was awarded the Graduate Student of the Year in 1991.

02:34:43.824 --> 02:34:59.815
In her 35-year career dedicated to developing therapies for cancer and AIDS, she has co-authored more than 55 peer-reviewed scientific papers and five book chapters, including seminal papers culminating at least a decade of research in each of four fields, immunology, natural products chemistry, epigenetics, and HIV-AIDS drug development.

02:35:00.035 --> 02:35:12.123
In 2006, Dr. Mike Biss became attracted to the plight of families with neuroimmune disease, including ME, CFS, and autism, and was primarily responsible for demonstrating the relationship between environmentally acquired immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation in these diseases.

02:35:12.643 --> 02:35:13.404
Judy, thanks.

02:35:16.746 --> 02:35:23.110
Remember also that Judy Mikovits was reintroduced to the world from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:25.352
's house when he told her story in 2020.

02:35:28.123 --> 02:35:29.323
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:35:29.684 --> 02:35:35.765
recounted the story of Judy Mikovits from his frickin' house with her in his house in 2020.

02:35:36.145 --> 02:35:40.687
They were at the same church in California in 2020.

02:35:40.987 --> 02:35:47.029
You know, the church where, oh yeah, that's right, Peggy Hall and her husband are?

02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:53.711
These are all scripted pieces of shit.

02:36:00.081 --> 02:36:00.821
So how did I end up here?

02:36:04.043 --> 02:36:11.306
Well, 37 years ago today, the cover of Time magazine was Interferon, the big if, cure for cancer.

02:36:11.786 --> 02:36:17.629
So it was a drop out of a needle, and this was, and I know it to the day because tomorrow's my birthday.

02:36:17.969 --> 02:36:22.011
So I was sitting at University of Virginia trying to figure out if I wanted to go work in oil with a chemistry degree.

02:36:23.177 --> 02:36:25.939
Her birthday is April Fool's Day.

02:36:26.479 --> 02:36:35.545
Her and her twin sister were born on April Fool's Day, the same day that ICANN was incorporated and the same day that they released the Vax movie.

02:36:39.595 --> 02:36:40.376
That's hilarious.

02:36:40.757 --> 02:36:43.019
Or do something else.

02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:45.462
I saw that magazine and I said, that's what I'm going to do.

02:36:45.482 --> 02:36:48.966
I read an advertisement in the Washington Post to go to Frederick, Maryland and purify Interferon.

02:36:49.046 --> 02:36:50.928
I got the job June 10th, 1980.

02:36:51.629 --> 02:36:55.233
And that started this journey, which is a wild one, but it's been fun.

02:36:56.174 --> 02:36:59.958
And so April 4th, 2016, this is the cover of Time Magazine.

02:37:00.458 --> 02:37:01.059
And I'm going to read it.

02:37:01.099 --> 02:37:09.446
It says, what if your immune system could be taught to kill cancer inside the brutally selective, hugely expensive, life-saving trials of immune therapy?

02:37:09.987 --> 02:37:13.050
So 36 years of research in immune therapy.

02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:15.412
We know vaccines are immune therapy.

02:37:15.712 --> 02:37:21.497
They're designed to teach your immune system to respond to a microorganism, to a pathogen, according to its virulence.

02:37:21.797 --> 02:37:22.558
What is virulence?

02:37:22.938 --> 02:37:25.960
It's the damage to the host, the damage to the immune system.

02:37:26.601 --> 02:37:40.072
So when we think of HIV, when I did my PhD thesis, HIV was incredibly toxic at the time because it destroyed the T cells, the cell-mediated part of the immune system.

02:37:40.432 --> 02:37:43.355
Not the PAC-MAN, the primary immune response, the macrophage that Dr.

02:37:44.161 --> 02:37:50.107
that Paul Thomas told us about, but the adaptive immune response, how we produce memory, how we remember we saw an invader.

02:37:50.327 --> 02:37:52.149
This is what a vaccine is supposed to do.

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:55.472
Teach your immune system how to respond with memory.

02:37:56.133 --> 02:38:00.397
And in fact, my PhD thesis was heretical at the time.

02:38:01.192 --> 02:38:04.233
10 years, thank you, 10, you know, it was 11 years.

02:38:04.834 --> 02:38:13.918
And when we saw perfectly healthy young men at UCLA, around the world at medical centers, come in with a strange chronic infections that people don't usually see in the Western world.

02:38:14.158 --> 02:38:18.500
Have to see sarcoma, a rare cancer usually only seen in old men in the southern tip of Italy.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.684
It's like, why are their immune systems failing when they're 20-some years old and perfectly healthy?

02:38:23.964 --> 02:38:26.526
At the time, we called it gay-related immune dysfunction.

02:38:26.866 --> 02:38:36.432
And I'm really ashamed of that because, you know, I'm there and I'm 22, and we're going to AIDS meetings, and they're protesting the AIDS meetings, and the patients are saying scientists are murderers.

02:38:36.793 --> 02:38:38.954
And I'm thinking, well, your behavior caused this.

02:38:39.194 --> 02:38:40.115
You know, you caused this.

02:38:40.235 --> 02:38:43.838
And, you know, I've grown up a lot since then, but I saw a lot at that time.

02:38:44.738 --> 02:39:02.669
Now, so in 2006, when we spin ahead, we now know that, or even in 1983, we knew this, the etiologic agent, what caused this disease and this destruction of the cell-mediated immune response was a virus, was actually a pathogen that was transmitted through blood and body fluids, at least theoretically.

02:39:03.309 --> 02:39:11.774
And so when we changed, when my PhD thesis was a week after Magic Johnson had been declared to have acquired the retrovirus HIV.

02:39:14.605 --> 02:39:14.925
Dang!

02:39:15.025 --> 02:39:17.368
In her book she mentions Magic Johnson.

02:39:17.488 --> 02:39:32.885
I showed you on July 4th the movie about the Dream Team and one of the things that featured very big in the Dream Team was the idea that retired HIV positive Magic Johnson was going to be allowed to play.

02:39:33.772 --> 02:39:48.675
And so the discussion of an HIV positive man playing basketball, is it dangerous, is it not, is very similar to the lab leak hypothesis being debunked on media and the lab leak being covered up in Congress.

02:39:48.815 --> 02:39:49.875
It's very similar.

02:39:50.375 --> 02:39:54.116
Let's get people to talk about AIDS so that they accept that it exists.

02:39:54.556 --> 02:39:56.616
And how can we get them to accept that it exists?

02:39:56.696 --> 02:39:58.937
Well, if there's a controversy about this,

02:39:59.577 --> 02:40:21.357
Newly retired superstar being able to play one last time on the dream team we might be able to get the whole fucking earth to talk about AIDS and Look what they did They scripted this shithead to say it too because it was all one script

02:40:23.004 --> 02:40:31.529
All my thesis committee cared about on November 14th, 1991 was, based on your thesis, will he or will he not die of AIDS?

02:40:32.089 --> 02:40:41.634
Do you see how much of a badass I am for having already started wearing Dream Team clothes about four months ago?

02:40:43.875 --> 02:40:46.317
Already showing you what I was gonna do.

02:40:46.517 --> 02:40:48.598
Already showing you what I was gonna say.

02:40:49.696 --> 02:40:55.937
And then on July 4th, playing the Dream Team video and never really saying it, just letting you know that it's there.

02:40:56.397 --> 02:41:05.159
And then now, do you see how methodically I am wiping the floor with these traders?

02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:12.441
I'm wiping the floor with them using eBay purchased secondhand clothing.

02:41:12.481 --> 02:41:14.421
That's how much of a badass I am.

02:41:15.319 --> 02:41:30.955
pieces here at George Washington University with taking blood from primarily black men with the virus and understanding how it stayed silent, how it could evade the immune response, because the most virulent organisms do the most damage by hiding from the immune system.

02:41:31.455 --> 02:41:37.802
And so to activate that, to activate the immune system, is an extremely toxic thing, which would spread the virus through the reservoir.

02:41:37.862 --> 02:41:42.667
So the answer was, based on my thesis, don't activate the immune system and silence the virus.

02:41:42.827 --> 02:41:43.848
You have to have both arms.

02:41:44.109 --> 02:41:48.213
Keep the immune system healthy and strong, and essentially you'll cure the disease.

02:41:48.493 --> 02:41:56.515
So now, 25 years later, we don't hear about HIV and AIDS anymore because the AIDS patients are healthier than we are.

02:41:56.815 --> 02:42:07.377
Yes, they're immune-compromised, and so yes, we vaccinate them differently, and we keep them from dying, basically, and turned it into a disease they can live with, just like diabetes, and that was our goal that I didn't think we'd ever achieve.

02:42:07.758 --> 02:42:09.438
So what happened in 2006?

02:42:10.098 --> 02:42:17.180
Well, we began to see children getting infections, getting diseases like shingles, and I called Dr. Rossetti, my mentor,

02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:22.903
long-time adversary, and he said, you know, don't waste my time.

02:42:23.083 --> 02:42:23.723
Don't be ridiculous.

02:42:23.743 --> 02:42:41.773
He was back at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, and by this time I was in California, and he said... Wait, so her boss worked at the National Cancer Institute where Lee Min Yan's, like, where Lee Min Yan in-laws worked, and where Vinay Prasad worked?

02:42:41.873 --> 02:42:42.854
What are we, what?

02:42:43.454 --> 02:42:44.434
Holy shit!

02:42:44.474 --> 02:42:45.275
They're the AIDS patients.

02:42:46.243 --> 02:42:47.764
And I said, yeah, exactly what I was thinking.

02:42:48.564 --> 02:42:50.145
And I don't mean HIV-AIDS.

02:42:50.565 --> 02:42:58.669
What we've got is a generation, or perhaps two now, because it's been almost 40 years, of acquired immune deficiencies from environmental toxins.

02:42:58.969 --> 02:43:08.314
And the single biggest threat to our public health is the vaccines that went from eight shots in 1983 and to almost 83 before a child is 18 or an adult at 21 now.

02:43:12.336 --> 02:43:14.439
So, you know, science is never settled.

02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:15.621
And so what happened?

02:43:15.781 --> 02:43:19.866
Well, in 1986, Ronald Reagan signed the National Vaccine Injury Protection Act.

02:43:20.327 --> 02:43:27.697
And what that did was shut down scientific research, as we heard from Brian Hooker and others, any paper that is

02:43:28.798 --> 02:43:34.022
is published that comes anywhere close to saying we might have a problem with vaccines, the data are destroyed.

02:43:34.582 --> 02:43:38.746
And I beg to differ with you, Del, as far as those scientists that are cowards.

02:43:39.366 --> 02:43:40.267
Dr. Thompson is a coward.

02:43:40.447 --> 02:43:43.809
We have an ethical responsibility to show all the data, whether we understand it or not.

02:43:43.849 --> 02:43:45.751
That's what I signed when I went into research.

02:43:46.011 --> 02:43:47.192
We don't hide any data.

02:43:47.272 --> 02:43:48.713
We publish it, whether we understand it or not.

02:43:49.273 --> 02:43:56.782
And when those data are retracted for political reasons, and not because the science has been disproven, that's a serious problem with all of our institutions.

02:43:56.982 --> 02:43:58.344
And that's where we are in science today.

02:43:58.564 --> 02:44:00.025
Major journals retracting papers.

02:44:00.186 --> 02:44:01.467
Retraction implies fraud.

02:44:01.807 --> 02:44:04.851
The fraud that's being done are the papers that are being published to cover up the truth.

02:44:06.312 --> 02:44:10.393
Knowledge and technology drives discovery.

02:44:10.694 --> 02:44:13.375
Discovery is how we change the practice of medicine.

02:44:13.675 --> 02:44:14.915
The difference between a Ph.D.

02:44:15.376 --> 02:44:16.196
and an M.D.

02:44:16.536 --> 02:44:21.058
is we're supposed to change the paradigms, which is why I made him read about those ten years of study.

02:44:21.198 --> 02:44:24.540
Because each time along the way, we encountered science that was wrong.

02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:30.382
So we learned with people like Stephen Bailyn at Johns Hopkins that one of the ways the virus stays silent is methylation.

02:44:30.662 --> 02:44:36.785
Well, when components of the vaccine inhibit your ability to silence other pathogens, that's why you're activating the virus in HIV.

02:44:37.025 --> 02:44:46.689
So we learn, and yet we can't look at a generation of kids with acquired immune deficiencies and even implement the same drugs, the same things which cured Jimmy Carter's cancer.

02:44:46.729 --> 02:44:49.970
We can't use the same mechanism, brain tumor, in a 90-year-old man.

02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:51.811
And obviously, as you age, your immune system gets tired.

02:44:52.011 --> 02:44:52.952
We have the tools.

02:44:53.112 --> 02:44:53.912
We have the drugs.

02:44:53.952 --> 02:44:55.954
We could treat these kids now and prevent their death.

02:44:56.154 --> 02:44:56.674
Do we do that?

02:44:56.794 --> 02:44:57.194
No, we don't.

02:44:57.234 --> 02:45:00.937
Because of a law that stopped solid research 30 years ago in 1986.

02:45:01.137 --> 02:45:03.398
So we haven't taken advantage of anything we've learned.

02:45:03.458 --> 02:45:04.619
It removed all liability.

02:45:04.639 --> 02:45:05.400
Wow.

02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:12.764
So they stopped all research on health because of the vaccine safety act signed by Ronald Reagan.

02:45:12.844 --> 02:45:13.144
What?

02:45:13.925 --> 02:45:14.265
What?

02:45:14.565 --> 02:45:15.446
From, from,

02:45:16.664 --> 02:45:22.767
investigators who publish fraud, and from the manufacturers, they could put anything they wanted in one of these vaccines.

02:45:23.047 --> 02:45:29.631
So I think it's in your packet, but I ask, you can go to the CDC website, and you can publish this table, too, and it's the excipient list.

02:45:29.911 --> 02:45:36.175
That means everything else that is in that needle other than the antigens that are supposed to be stimulating the immune system.

02:45:36.915 --> 02:45:39.596
I'll just read from the Pediarix, which we give two-month-olds.

02:45:39.776 --> 02:45:45.059
Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, lactalbumin, hydros- I can't even read that one.

02:45:45.079 --> 02:45:46.120
If you can't read it, don't put it in the milk.

02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:49.401
polysorbate 80, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, antibiotics.

02:45:49.581 --> 02:45:51.182
We wonder why we're developing antibiotic resistance.

02:45:51.342 --> 02:45:51.882
Yeast protein.

02:45:51.902 --> 02:45:54.203
But, but, but, but, but it's the aluminum.

02:45:55.124 --> 02:45:58.185
And it's the MMR shot that makes the aluminum move around.

02:45:58.245 --> 02:46:02.827
Wait, I thought it was the mercury and the accumulation of mercury.

02:46:03.707 --> 02:46:04.608
Now it's not.

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:08.510
Now it's all these other things that Brandy Vaughn used to put on her billboards.

02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:11.631
The excipients.

02:46:14.428 --> 02:46:16.751
It's not intramuscular injection, guys.

02:46:17.371 --> 02:46:21.356
Intramuscular injection is fine, it's just that they keep choosing stupid shit.

02:46:24.061 --> 02:46:25.342
Think of any allergies, anyone?

02:46:26.022 --> 02:46:27.843
Fenton median containing bovine extract.

02:46:28.283 --> 02:46:33.204
Vero monkey kidney cells, which contain animal retroviruses, just like HIV, in our children.

02:46:33.364 --> 02:46:38.186
And then we continue for the next 18 years to activate those and hope they catch hold in immune cell with a long time memory.

02:46:38.366 --> 02:46:39.607
We are creating AIDS patients.

02:46:40.027 --> 02:46:44.989
So today I want to focus on my latest pet peeve, and that's the HPV vaccine.

02:46:45.329 --> 02:46:48.510
Human papillomavirus does not cause cancer.

02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:49.870
You know, hear this well.

02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:51.951
There are 100 strains of human papillomavirus.

02:46:52.165 --> 02:47:01.910
been saying this here this well because there was a campaign around the vaccine schedule or the vaxxed movie that was here this well and they're repeating that because it's a fucking enchantment.

02:47:02.170 --> 02:47:04.092
Papillomavirus.

02:47:04.172 --> 02:47:07.233
Four of them are associated with cancers because they carry oncogenes.

02:47:07.653 --> 02:47:10.235
When we inoculate using those four strains,

02:47:11.101 --> 02:47:18.625
Don't forget that SV40 is an oncogene that was supposedly part of the plasmid that has contaminated the mRNA.

02:47:18.645 --> 02:47:30.070
And so she's laying down the same bullshit that Kevin McKernan has picked up and ran with Jessica Rose the last three years because it's one continuous, malevolent, piece of shit, long con script.

02:47:31.184 --> 02:47:40.551
And with a potent and never safety-tested adjuvant, the new form of aluminum sulfate, aluminum hydroxy sulfate, and a lipid called MPL.

02:47:40.891 --> 02:47:50.278
Those two adjuvants drive the immune response as powerful as you can get to take an infection that is normally cleared 99% from the keratinocytes it infects at the level of the skin cell in two weeks.

02:47:50.599 --> 02:47:52.580
So the immune system, it's not a virulent pathogen.

02:47:53.341 --> 02:47:54.321
It causes warts.

02:47:55.502 --> 02:47:58.304
It's not an issue for 99% of the people who are infected.

02:48:00.666 --> 02:48:07.277
when you bypass the natural immunity and inject directly into the muscles something with that aluminum which carries it right to the macrophages.

02:48:07.297 --> 02:48:08.158
She just said it.

02:48:08.499 --> 02:48:13.167
She just said it when you bypass the immune system and inject it directly into the muscle.

02:48:13.748 --> 02:48:14.970
So she understands it.

02:48:16.727 --> 02:48:22.649
And she will need to be better scripted after this day and make sure that she never says that again.

02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:29.331
But she can say it now because that's the message of Brandi Vaughn and Tony Bark and they're still alive in 2017.

02:48:29.831 --> 02:48:33.892
And Tony Bark is sitting right next to the fucking podium here.

02:48:35.027 --> 02:48:39.411
of the liver macrophages, the lung macrophages, and it stays there for more than a year, that aluminum.

02:48:39.691 --> 02:48:42.314
We give three doses of that in three months.

02:48:42.554 --> 02:48:43.374
One month, two months, three months.

02:48:43.535 --> 02:48:50.541
They did the research to show after the second month, you were getting as much immunity as you would get, which is four years of memory, four years of protection.

02:48:51.001 --> 02:48:53.403
This vaccine was approved in nine-year-olds.

02:48:53.843 --> 02:49:01.328
It was never tested in anybody under 25, and yet the FDA, against everything we know about every cancer drug that's approved, took a multi-component vaccine.

02:49:01.508 --> 02:49:03.550
In cancer, we test them one at a time.

02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:07.872
Everything that goes into a patient for AIDS drug has to be tested alone and in combination.

02:49:08.153 --> 02:49:08.633
That's all gone.

02:49:08.893 --> 02:49:09.974
There's no safety testing.

02:49:11.235 --> 02:49:16.999
The vaccine is tested against the aluminum, or against the hepatitis A vaccine, which we heard was one of the most dangerous vaccines we give today.

02:49:17.299 --> 02:49:20.121
And so you're looking, there's no placebo, there's no saline, so you're asking,

02:49:20.998 --> 02:49:22.939
There's no placebo.

02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:24.499
Another part of the narrative.

02:49:24.559 --> 02:49:26.260
Again, this is 2017.

02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:28.100
They're still trying to test it out.

02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:29.261
She's still riffing.

02:49:29.761 --> 02:49:32.902
And after this, they can review it and say, you don't need to say that again.

02:49:32.942 --> 02:49:34.062
You don't need to say this again.

02:49:34.102 --> 02:49:35.423
You can say that more often.

02:49:35.843 --> 02:49:43.245
And that's why we are where we are right now with the same traitorous assholes in front of us with an even shittier script than they had in 2017.

02:49:45.006 --> 02:49:57.222
Because in 2017, Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive, and so if they were gonna step in front of them after they murdered them, they had to say something very similar to them, so that nobody would frickin' notice.

02:49:58.787 --> 02:50:10.653
You know if there's any more damage to the host and you can't see the damage above the noise of the damage created By the very components of the vaccine that I just read off and yet it just it just flies and most scientists like myself Don't even read the papers.

02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:22.779
I didn't until until Brian hooker's paper came out in 2014 when we started Wait, wait, she didn't read the papers until Brian hooker's paper came out What in the fuck does that mean?

02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:25.321
Holy shit, what a liar

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:29.790
This is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever listened to.

02:50:30.310 --> 02:50:33.191
Now we're starting to understand those AIDS patients.

02:50:33.451 --> 02:50:37.433
Um, you know, so science, the journals, the journals are censoring the science.

02:50:38.013 --> 02:50:39.053
The journals are censoring the science.

02:50:39.073 --> 02:50:39.894
The journals are retracting.

02:50:40.034 --> 02:50:42.715
The journals are forcing those retractions based on politics, not on science.

02:50:42.915 --> 02:50:44.155
The papers are not being disproven.

02:50:44.295 --> 02:50:45.675
They're just pulled so nobody can read them.

02:50:45.996 --> 02:50:47.056
Fortunately, we have the internet.

02:50:47.316 --> 02:50:53.177
and I'll send you a copy of our papers anytime you want them, because the data are right and true, and unless scientists like myself can read it, we can't advance science.

02:50:53.677 --> 02:50:57.138
We're not even allowed to look at vaccine injury because of this law.

02:50:57.458 --> 02:51:09.821
So did you know that Dr. Diane Harper, the lead scientist at Merck, who developed the Gardasil HPV vaccine, warned vaccines causing permanent injury, even death, stating that the HPV vaccination leads to no benefit, only harm from injuries.

02:51:10.841 --> 02:51:13.542
No, it's interesting to mention somebody from Merck

02:51:14.483 --> 02:51:27.329
when Brandy Vaughn used to work at Merck and is a former Merck employee who is calling them out on Vioxx and on their presence in the vaccine schedule, but she mentions somebody else from Merck.

02:51:28.290 --> 02:51:30.611
That's also scripted bullshit.

02:51:30.953 --> 02:51:32.373
Cancer is not a public health threat.

02:51:32.593 --> 02:51:33.634
It's not an infectious disease.

02:51:34.354 --> 02:51:36.335
Why is it in the Department of Public Health?

02:51:36.375 --> 02:51:41.536
Why are we mandating every child over nine years old, and I heard soon to be pregnant women, to get this vaccine?

02:51:42.036 --> 02:51:42.656
It makes no sense.

02:51:42.676 --> 02:51:45.037
They'll tell you, oh, we're going to be spread rampant with all these infectious disease.

02:51:45.217 --> 02:51:47.018
Well, that's not an infectious communicable disease.

02:51:47.058 --> 02:51:47.858
It's not a public health threat.

02:51:48.098 --> 02:52:13.294
it should be there and yet that you know that only on investigators at the scene is that they are ahead of the ncaa national cancer institute and and and cdc and if the a whole patents and they're mandating something they're making uh... billions of dollars and when we ask about that extra shot of our sale it's so they can't make more money it so they can get insurance coverage when we know that we don't need three shots to develop the same immunity worse now we won't we don't need three shots we only need to you freaking idiot

02:52:14.355 --> 02:52:17.719
We're fighting for less shots because we don't need so many.

02:52:17.759 --> 02:52:21.684
I mean, if you were following the science, you would know that you were fine after two shots.

02:52:21.764 --> 02:52:22.726
Listen to this shit.

02:52:23.833 --> 02:52:29.197
parents will think their daughters, if they escape the devastation of the vaccine, their daughters are protected from cervical cancer.

02:52:29.457 --> 02:52:31.779
And so no pap smears, no preventative measures, no testing.

02:52:32.139 --> 02:52:35.201
And it only lasts four years, and it was never developed to prevent cancer.

02:52:35.401 --> 02:52:37.382
It was developed and approved to prevent warts.

02:52:37.582 --> 02:52:38.723
Warts are not a public health threat.

02:52:39.564 --> 02:52:48.670
It's just, it's beyond, when scientists like myself, and I work in cancer and AIDS, hear this, we're just, I mean, Frank Ricetti just said, you know, no, nobody gives a day-old infant hepatitis B vaccine.

02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:53.053
We were 30 years old, and we worked with Ebola, HIV, and everything you can imagine, and we were given a choice.

02:52:53.833 --> 02:52:56.134
And it's mandated and I and his wife even went upstairs and got this.

02:52:56.374 --> 02:53:00.996
Oh, it's about mandates and choice again Even risk Eddie agrees that it's about mandates and choice.

02:53:01.077 --> 02:53:02.937
Listen to this bullshit script.

02:53:03.298 --> 02:53:04.038
It's sad.

02:53:04.098 --> 02:53:10.761
Really if you hear it now son's records, unfortunately He was born in 1986, you know, so what about the children who the luck of their birth were born after that?

02:53:11.161 --> 02:53:16.068
I recommended to my sisters that their children get Gardasil.

02:53:16.088 --> 02:53:20.114
My twins, three boys, and my younger sister's daughter, who is in medical school, unfortunately didn't take my advice.

02:53:20.354 --> 02:53:21.035
That was a decade ago.

02:53:21.075 --> 02:53:21.476
I didn't know.

02:53:21.976 --> 02:53:24.319
I know now, but that one of the sons has migraines.

02:53:25.141 --> 02:53:26.342
We have to call for accountability.

02:53:27.148 --> 02:53:29.851
So one of the sons has migraines from the Hep B shot?

02:53:31.192 --> 02:53:32.694
Or from HPV?

02:53:32.794 --> 02:53:34.015
That's just crazy talk.

02:53:34.095 --> 02:53:34.395
Wow.

02:53:34.415 --> 02:53:40.682
I have to call from all our public health agencies, the FDA involved as well, because they're the ones who are approving these things that haven't been tested.

02:53:40.882 --> 02:53:41.422
These are drugs.

02:53:41.743 --> 02:53:43.004
They're not magic pez dispensers.

02:53:43.124 --> 02:53:44.545
They need to be considered drugs now.

02:53:45.286 --> 02:53:49.951
And I think we need to ban, as Japan and India have, all HPV vaccinations now.

02:53:50.211 --> 02:53:52.652
until the appropriate studies are done, until the patients are tested.

02:53:52.812 --> 02:53:53.652
We can get IRB approval.

02:53:53.672 --> 02:53:57.733
It takes a few years, and it takes a long time to do these multi-component studies, but they can do it if it's safe and effective.

02:53:57.753 --> 02:53:59.193
We can develop safe and effective vaccines.

02:53:59.373 --> 02:53:59.853
These aren't safe.

02:54:00.134 --> 02:54:02.694
More than 40,000 serious injuries last year alone.

02:54:02.714 --> 02:54:04.375
That's more than the cases of cervical cancer.

02:54:05.015 --> 02:54:06.655
We can develop safer vaccines.

02:54:06.695 --> 02:54:09.216
We definitely can, and Judy will know how to do it.

02:54:09.296 --> 02:54:10.856
Robert Malone will know how to do it.

02:54:10.916 --> 02:54:12.377
Kevin McKernan will know how to do it.

02:54:12.437 --> 02:54:13.837
Retsif Levy knows how to do it.

02:54:13.857 --> 02:54:15.177
Fuck these liars.

02:54:15.657 --> 02:54:17.618
In the United States, in any given year.

02:54:18.198 --> 02:54:43.822
um call all that until any of these uh immune therapies any of these vaccinations are tested alone and in combination in everything that's added to the schedule we need to call for a moratorium on all vaccination stop today not one there is not one thing on the schedule that is a public health threat in the united states of america today in fact that public health threat is the vaccines we know the pertussis vaccine is driving the evolution of pathogenic species driving the pertussis outbreaks we're seeing the same things true

02:54:44.302 --> 02:54:52.469
It's driving the evolution of the virus just like Kurt VondenBosch said was happening with the transfection that he never called a transfection.

02:54:52.969 --> 02:54:56.512
It's the same shitty script and you can hear it right here.

02:54:57.033 --> 02:54:59.255
She is a scripted freaking fraud.

02:54:59.915 --> 02:55:04.177
And the only reason why she says anything useful is because Tony Bark is in the frickin' room.

02:55:04.197 --> 02:55:05.258
They haven't killed her yet.

02:55:05.558 --> 02:55:09.140
Measles, the same thing's true of a cancer-associated virus.

02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:15.944
So HPV vaccination is driving the development of oncogenic strain, and we're not allowed to research any of those things.

02:55:16.144 --> 02:55:17.164
Scientists are simply not allowed.

02:55:17.565 --> 02:55:18.865
If you do, you don't have a career.

02:55:19.906 --> 02:55:22.487
Some people choose their career over their higher calling.

02:55:22.687 --> 02:55:22.927
I don't.

02:55:23.188 --> 02:55:23.748
We don't do that.

02:55:23.868 --> 02:55:25.189
We publish all the data, and we will.

02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:29.351
And I think we need to hold the scientists who are committing these crimes criminally liable.

02:55:29.631 --> 02:55:33.034
It's a crime to commit an ethical fraud and publish a piece of data you know not to be true.

02:55:33.794 --> 02:55:36.276
So, and until there's a full investigation, I'll talk to Congress anytime.

02:55:36.476 --> 02:55:48.445
I'll give them every piece of data that shows every bit of the head of the NIAID saying if you do that, if you do that study, if you show up and you show what you showed before, and you're not a coward and we haven't scared you enough, you will be arrested.

02:55:49.105 --> 02:55:49.706
You will be arrested.

02:55:49.886 --> 02:56:03.056
So that's the head of our National Institute of Allergy Infectious Diseases that is protecting an institution that pays out more than $6.25 billion every year in research for the one million people who in 1995 were infected with HIV and had AIDS.

02:56:03.456 --> 02:56:15.326
That translated into what we found with regard to the new family of retroviruses contaminating not only the HPV vaccine, but many of the vaccines because they're recombinant and they occur in the lab and they're in the biological materials, in the cell materials, the DNA, the cellular DNA that's in the virus.

02:56:15.947 --> 02:56:21.334
That's 25 million Americans with solid evidence of that infection, walking time bombs of chronic disease.

02:56:21.714 --> 02:56:24.818
We have to end this now and I think the only way to do it is to stop right now.

02:56:25.159 --> 02:56:29.524
All moratoriums, when it hits the pocket, we're going to see the healthy people and we're going to see something happen in research.

02:56:29.584 --> 02:56:30.125
Thank you.

02:56:35.319 --> 02:56:37.221
did not say that during COVID.

02:56:37.761 --> 02:56:43.607
She did not say that I've been advocating for the vaccine schedule to be ended since 2015.

02:56:44.368 --> 02:56:45.809
She never said any of that.

02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:48.352
Just like Brian Hooker never said any of it.

02:56:48.392 --> 02:56:50.194
Just like Dell never said any of it.

02:56:50.234 --> 02:56:57.061
Just like Suzanne Humphries has never said any of it because they are all traitorous, scripted frauds.

02:57:03.587 --> 02:57:04.828
I just feel so much better after that.

02:57:05.048 --> 02:57:06.348
Thank you for being a beacon of light and hope.

02:57:07.969 --> 02:57:09.049
Really shocking and powerful stuff.

02:57:09.069 --> 02:57:09.470
Thank you, Judy.

02:57:10.770 --> 02:57:16.213
Jennifer Margulis, PhD, is an award-winning science journalist, Fulbright grantee, and the author, editor of seven non-fiction books.

02:57:16.593 --> 02:57:20.334
A sought-after speaker, she's been researching and writing about issues related to children's health for over 15 years.

02:57:20.555 --> 02:57:23.976
Her articles have appeared in New York Times, The Washington Post, and on the cover of Smithsonian Magazine.

02:57:24.096 --> 02:57:30.559
She produces audio features for Jefferson Public Radio, an affiliate of National Public Radio, and regularly writes cover stories for JPR's magazine, The Jefferson Journal.

02:57:30.919 --> 02:57:36.121
She's taught literature in inner-city Atlanta, appeared live on primetime TV in Paris, and worked on a child survival campaign in Niger.

02:57:36.421 --> 02:57:45.685
Her most recent book, The Vaccine-Friendly Plan with Dr. Paul's Safe and Effective Approach to Immunity and Health from Pregnancies through Your Child's Teen Years, is co-written with integrative pediatrician Paul Thomas.

02:57:46.125 --> 02:57:50.266
So she wrote the book with Paul Thomas and now she's gonna speak.

02:57:51.047 --> 02:57:53.868
So Paul Thomas, then Brian Hooker, then

02:57:55.120 --> 02:58:04.423
then Judy Mikovits, I mean, oh, then a blonde journalist, then Judy Mikovits, now another blonde journalist or another journalist with eight books.

02:58:05.324 --> 02:58:06.344
Holy fuck.

02:58:14.047 --> 02:58:15.147
Thank you for being with us.

02:58:15.549 --> 02:58:19.512
And this is a lady who was on stage with Mary Holland a few times.

02:58:19.572 --> 02:58:25.097
I've seen her in a few things that we've watched with James Lyons Wyler on stage as well.

02:58:26.738 --> 02:58:29.040
So I guess this is a scripted fraud as well.

02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:32.843
She might just not be smart enough to understand that she's a scripted fraud.

02:58:33.683 --> 02:58:34.923
But she's a scripted fraud.

02:58:35.223 --> 02:58:36.184
I'm going through this one.

02:58:36.264 --> 02:58:36.884
I'm not doing it.

02:58:58.868 --> 02:59:01.770
We can officially call every- Dr. Tony Barker.

02:59:02.171 --> 02:59:04.813
We can officially call everybody up here the Suicide Squad.

02:59:04.833 --> 02:59:08.716
Okay, okay, alright.

02:59:09.496 --> 02:59:11.058
The Suicide Squad?

02:59:11.118 --> 02:59:12.339
Is that fucking funny?

02:59:12.419 --> 02:59:16.042
That actually a couple years later, Brandy and Tony would be dead?

02:59:17.783 --> 02:59:19.144
The Suicide Squad.

02:59:19.364 --> 02:59:21.946
He's actually telling you that people are gonna get killed.

02:59:22.587 --> 02:59:23.287
It's not funny.

02:59:23.748 --> 02:59:25.289
Because he knows that's what's gonna happen.

02:59:27.682 --> 02:59:30.287
Dr. Toni Bark received her MD from Rush Medical College.

02:59:30.347 --> 02:59:37.260
Following residency, she was director of the Pediatric Emergency Room at Michael Reese Hospital for three years prior to returning to studies in naturopathic modalities and starting

02:59:38.166 --> 02:59:39.327
Michael Reese!

02:59:39.968 --> 02:59:41.769
I didn't know she was at Michael Reese.

02:59:41.989 --> 02:59:44.771
I thought she was at freaking Rush Medical Center.

02:59:44.791 --> 02:59:46.032
She was at Michael Reese.

02:59:46.533 --> 02:59:51.637
I actually worked at Michael Reese Hospital as a pharmacy technician after college.

02:59:52.077 --> 02:59:55.880
Holy shit, I worked there for almost a year and a half in the OR.

02:59:56.580 --> 03:00:01.664
Oh my gosh, I could have seen her in the freaking cafeteria.

03:00:01.985 --> 03:00:02.945
Holy shit!

03:00:03.746 --> 03:00:05.607
That, I bet you she's gonna correct that.

03:00:05.668 --> 03:00:08.570
I've never heard her say Michael Reese Hospital.

03:00:09.270 --> 03:00:11.252
That's a hospital that doesn't exist anymore.

03:00:12.192 --> 03:00:14.434
I can't believe that, wow, that's interesting.

03:00:14.814 --> 03:00:15.955
Private holistic medical practice.

03:00:16.275 --> 03:00:22.880
She completed her leadership in environmental and energy design in 2003, and a master's in medical science with a focus on medical disaster preparedness and response.

03:00:23.261 --> 03:00:33.068
Dr. Bark discovered serious conflicts of interest in regulatory agencies and federal advisory committees, which propelled her to research, write, and eventually co-produce a documentary, I believe that's called Bot, on the subject of corruption in big food and big pharma.

03:00:33.886 --> 03:00:39.409
Oh, so the movie producer of Vax can't remember the movie that she made.

03:00:39.449 --> 03:00:40.629
Was it called Bot?

03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:42.470
I can't remember exactly.

03:00:42.490 --> 03:00:44.731
I wouldn't want to plug your previous work.

03:00:46.492 --> 03:00:47.212
Stop lying!

03:00:48.693 --> 03:00:50.154
What a fraud this guy is.

03:00:50.214 --> 03:00:51.454
I mean, he's shameless.

03:00:52.295 --> 03:00:54.556
Dr. Bark has testified in front of Senate health committees in Minnesota.

03:00:54.864 --> 03:00:55.485
Texas and Vermont.

03:00:55.705 --> 03:00:57.807
She's an expert witness in a current case in the federal vaccine court.

03:00:58.108 --> 03:01:00.730
She's a contributing author to the second edition of Vaccine Epidemic.

03:01:01.111 --> 03:01:06.797
Dr. Bark has a private practice in the Chicago area and is co-founder of American Renewable Energy with her husband, Dr. Tony Bark.

03:01:13.228 --> 03:01:20.930
So I want to talk about the disconnect, because we've heard here from scientists and journalists about issues in vaccine program and in vaccines themselves.

03:01:21.250 --> 03:01:22.430
Why aren't we hearing about that from doctors?

03:01:23.250 --> 03:01:24.971
I hear all the time, I really like my pediatrician.

03:01:25.031 --> 03:01:26.271
I really like my general practitioner.

03:01:26.491 --> 03:01:27.231
I love my internist.

03:01:27.491 --> 03:01:28.411
They're recommending Gardasil.

03:01:28.431 --> 03:01:29.372
They're recommending the schedule.

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:30.252
They're good people.

03:01:30.292 --> 03:01:31.752
They wouldn't do anything to hurt me or my children.

03:01:31.772 --> 03:01:32.412
Why is this happening?

03:01:33.192 --> 03:01:35.233
That's such a good question, and that really is the heart of the problem.

03:01:36.033 --> 03:01:38.355
I went to medical school, I started in 82, and I graduated in 86.

03:01:38.415 --> 03:01:41.257
I did it in four years.

03:01:41.277 --> 03:01:44.240
86 was the year that Congress enacted the National Vaccine Compensation Program.

03:01:45.781 --> 03:01:47.682
There was also a program to report vaccine injury.

03:01:47.722 --> 03:01:50.785
It's called VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

03:01:51.806 --> 03:01:58.431
I embarked upon a pediatric internship, 86, 87, and then I trained for a year in rehab medicine, and then I finished a pediatric residency.

03:01:59.011 --> 03:02:03.335
I never, never heard about the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which were mandated to report.

03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:06.952
Do you understand why they need to replace her?

03:02:07.212 --> 03:02:09.274
You don't need to hear another goddamn thing.

03:02:10.094 --> 03:02:21.343
They need to replace her because her professional experience as a pediatrician is exactly, exactly, is exactly the problem.

03:02:22.584 --> 03:02:26.267
That intramuscular injection is not even discussed.

03:02:27.329 --> 03:02:31.713
that the whole biology and the ridiculousness of it is not even addressed.

03:02:31.813 --> 03:02:37.318
They avoid it completely on purpose and the idea of injury or reporting it is not taught.

03:02:38.039 --> 03:02:43.184
And it was not taught a year after the law was passed.

03:02:43.284 --> 03:02:44.765
That makes her especially

03:02:45.606 --> 03:02:47.146
troublesome for them now, doesn't it?

03:02:47.186 --> 03:02:55.269
Because if you're going to pass a law like that, but then not really teach or enforce or put it in effect, then it's pretty lame, right?

03:02:55.309 --> 03:03:05.391
Remember, don't forget, EpiGirl in the SPARS pandemic document comes out and says that there's some vaccine schedule, some vaccine signal on social media.

03:03:06.092 --> 03:03:07.012
And don't forget that

03:03:07.512 --> 03:03:15.296
The epigirl character named Jessica Rose did that exclusively for like five years besides saying spike protein, spike protein, spike protein.

03:03:15.756 --> 03:03:17.417
She said VAERS, VAERS, VAERS.

03:03:19.137 --> 03:03:27.621
The system that this woman watched not be deployed when it was passed as a law.

03:03:28.162 --> 03:03:31.783
So she understood it as a fraud from its inception.

03:03:31.803 --> 03:03:33.084
Yeah?

03:03:34.289 --> 03:03:48.195
Understand why she would be such a pain in the ass and need, need like Belle Del Bigtree and some fat-ass fraud like, like Brian Hooker and some fake like Paul Thomas and some scripted stooge like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:03:48.235 --> 03:03:49.196
to be put in front of her?

03:03:49.818 --> 03:03:50.939
if our patients have an adverse event.

03:03:51.559 --> 03:03:54.221
I never heard about the vaccine compensation program.

03:03:55.042 --> 03:04:06.910
I never heard that the head of the YF vaccine program in 1983 wrote a memo going out saying we need to let training pediatricians know that the DPT can be dangerous for immature newborns and immature infants and infants with neurological issues.

03:04:06.970 --> 03:04:08.011
This is a memo we need to get out.

03:04:08.531 --> 03:04:09.031
Never got to me.

03:04:10.272 --> 03:04:13.734
I was director of a very busy urban pediatric emergency room.

03:04:13.915 --> 03:04:17.277
I was recommended by the physician who was running it before me who went to the University of Chicago.

03:04:18.755 --> 03:04:19.556
I didn't know about these things.

03:04:20.357 --> 03:04:20.857
Never heard about it.

03:04:21.037 --> 03:04:21.778
I saw a vaccine injury.

03:04:22.058 --> 03:04:22.639
I never reported it.

03:04:23.179 --> 03:04:23.760
I didn't know I could.

03:04:25.061 --> 03:04:36.751
We saw kids in the vaccine clinic that would come in by ambulance in the evening, either in status asthmaticus, severe asthma, seizure, not just febrile seizures, sometimes complex seizures, and also respiratory distress or arrest.

03:04:37.372 --> 03:04:39.674
And we noted that it was likely vaccine-induced.

03:04:41.035 --> 03:04:43.918
Do you understand why this woman needed to be killed?

03:04:44.659 --> 03:04:49.162
because she's not selling a book about an alternative vaccine schedule.

03:04:49.202 --> 03:04:51.944
She's not arguing for placebo control trials.

03:04:52.525 --> 03:05:00.830
She is witness to the lack of notation, the lack of report, the lack of awareness that this happens.

03:05:03.372 --> 03:05:09.857
She is part of the last line of defense that needed to get rid of before everybody else just kind of didn't care.

03:05:11.906 --> 03:05:15.849
That's why Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark had to be killed.

03:05:17.130 --> 03:05:20.853
In those days we did not give anywhere near the amount of vaccine to be given today.

03:05:20.913 --> 03:05:21.553
It was about one tenth.

03:05:22.474 --> 03:05:23.835
We didn't give a vaccine at birth.

03:05:24.396 --> 03:05:25.897
Do you understand what she's saying?

03:05:26.417 --> 03:05:32.362
That even back then they knew vaccine injury was occurring, back before they gave all these shots.

03:05:34.144 --> 03:05:36.045
Back when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:05:36.085 --> 03:05:41.086
says, we didn't have any autism when I was a kid, so I guess it's so many more shots now.

03:05:41.566 --> 03:05:47.468
I guess it's this awful vaccine schedule that they don't have any ability to compare to any other vaccine schedule.

03:05:47.528 --> 03:05:53.290
No, Toni Barke does, because she worked there and she saw a vaccine injury before

03:05:54.286 --> 03:05:57.030
the escalation of the schedule.

03:05:57.070 --> 03:06:00.714
You see the problem they have with Tony Bark?

03:06:00.755 --> 03:06:01.676
Do you see the problem?

03:06:01.816 --> 03:06:03.378
We adjusted for preemie age.

03:06:03.999 --> 03:06:07.203
We didn't vaccinate women who thought they could be pregnant within six months, or were trying.

03:06:08.965 --> 03:06:09.766
This has all changed.

03:06:10.805 --> 03:06:12.426
Training doctors now don't even hear these warnings.

03:06:12.967 --> 03:06:16.329
I didn't get anywhere near the amount of warning and information I should have gotten, but I got something.

03:06:16.929 --> 03:06:32.821
I was told, when I had chicken pox as a pediatric intern at the age of 26, and we had to vaccinate the whole ward with an experimental vaccine, because I'd exposed everybody, because I was forced to work with fever, because in those days you worked every day and through the night, every third night, there were no limits on hours, and fever was no reason to stop working as a pediatric or a resident.

03:06:33.081 --> 03:06:33.661
No, I'm serious.

03:06:33.842 --> 03:06:34.442
And this is important.

03:06:34.542 --> 03:06:35.082
I'll come back to this.

03:06:35.563 --> 03:06:39.526
Sickness, even communicable sickness, was zero reason to miss a day of work.

03:06:40.106 --> 03:06:40.686
That was very clear.

03:06:40.987 --> 03:06:42.047
I had 102 fever, I was working.

03:06:42.247 --> 03:06:52.373
And the day my titers came back, I said... Another big problem with her honesty and her experience as a pediatrician during this crucial transition.

03:06:53.394 --> 03:06:57.216
This crucial transition from liability to no liability.

03:06:57.975 --> 03:07:01.996
from infinite shot potential to minimal shot potential.

03:07:02.536 --> 03:07:16.721
She was living the transition in the teaching, living the transition in the doctrine, and professionally experiencing the cognitive dissonance that had to have occurred when this transition occurred.

03:07:17.081 --> 03:07:18.021
And so here we go.

03:07:18.521 --> 03:07:20.942
We got to kill this woman.

03:07:21.822 --> 03:07:22.282
And they did.

03:07:22.302 --> 03:07:23.983
I don't think I ever ate chicken pox.

03:07:25.263 --> 03:07:27.504
I was working the ER and I was covered in rash.

03:07:28.601 --> 03:07:31.264
And I was told by the head of pediatrics, we have an experimental vaccine.

03:07:31.284 --> 03:07:33.927
We're going to have to give the cancer ward and the neonates, because you had been on call working with them.

03:07:34.227 --> 03:07:37.811
But we would never recommend this vaccine to all children, because all vaccines come with real risk.

03:07:38.251 --> 03:07:42.255
And chickenpox is a benign illness, unless you're immune suppressed on steroids on chemo.

03:07:42.515 --> 03:07:44.077
So this vaccine will never be recommended.

03:07:44.117 --> 03:07:45.098
I remember that so clearly.

03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:47.080
And that changed.

03:07:47.521 --> 03:07:48.802
And I can tell you how that changed, but I'm coming there.

03:07:49.878 --> 03:07:51.278
Okay, so that's my background.

03:07:52.079 --> 03:07:54.780
So she knows professionally how this is done.

03:07:54.880 --> 03:07:56.780
She knows how it gets slipped by.

03:07:57.281 --> 03:08:00.802
She knows how this happens and she is a very articulate person.

03:08:01.702 --> 03:08:04.583
It's disturbing that she's also pretty attractive, isn't it?

03:08:05.163 --> 03:08:06.984
It's actually really a big problem.

03:08:09.037 --> 03:08:10.838
I'm walking around doing the vaccine clinic, vaccinating kids.

03:08:10.859 --> 03:08:11.819
I know there's a risk for some kids.

03:08:12.159 --> 03:08:14.141
It's kind of a Russian roulette, but this is what we do.

03:08:14.181 --> 03:08:14.721
This is what we accept.

03:08:14.741 --> 03:08:15.342
They didn't think about it.

03:08:15.542 --> 03:08:19.165
We were not taught anything about vaccines other than this is the schedule, and this is how you give them, and this is when you give them.

03:08:19.565 --> 03:08:22.007
That's the amount of information you get on vaccination.

03:08:22.327 --> 03:08:24.669
You don't learn anything about innate immunity in medical school.

03:08:24.769 --> 03:08:26.850
You learn about acquired immunity because you're taught to push the vaccines.

03:08:27.170 --> 03:08:27.691
That's what you're taught.

03:08:28.672 --> 03:08:31.694
Tylenol was given to every kid with fever that came into the ER before I could even see them.

03:08:32.254 --> 03:08:32.915
It's just a matter of fact.

03:08:33.175 --> 03:08:33.955
It reduces glutathione.

03:08:33.975 --> 03:08:34.436
We know that now.

03:08:34.776 --> 03:08:37.198
Glutathione is infinitely important in detoxification.

03:08:38.826 --> 03:08:41.107
So fast forward, I'm running the ER.

03:08:41.147 --> 03:08:44.789
I always wanted to do something alternative, but I love the emergency room.

03:08:45.010 --> 03:08:48.051
I thrive on epinephrine.

03:08:48.712 --> 03:08:55.836
I'm sorry, but anybody, if you don't understand how much of an intellectual, professional,

03:08:56.796 --> 03:08:58.036
Skilled badass.

03:08:58.116 --> 03:09:00.517
Somebody has to be, to be the head of any ER.

03:09:00.557 --> 03:09:10.019
I don't give a shit what ER it is, but an ER in Chicago, an ER on the south side of Chicago, if it was really Michael Reese Hospital, holy shit.

03:09:14.361 --> 03:09:15.401
I can't say enough.

03:09:16.394 --> 03:09:17.795
how this person is a problem.

03:09:17.835 --> 03:09:20.638
It doesn't matter if you were on ABC Doctors.

03:09:20.758 --> 03:09:24.923
It doesn't matter if you're descended from four generations of fucking journalists.

03:09:25.363 --> 03:09:31.049
It doesn't matter if you worked for the Department of Energy for 16 years transforming and transfecting plants.

03:09:31.529 --> 03:09:34.012
You can't hold a freaking candle to this woman.

03:09:35.199 --> 03:09:40.602
Doesn't matter if you have the whistleblower documents from William Thompson.

03:09:41.062 --> 03:09:43.243
You can't hold a candle to this woman.

03:09:43.804 --> 03:09:46.045
You fraud, Brian Hooker.

03:09:46.105 --> 03:09:48.026
You fraud, Paul Thomas.

03:09:48.066 --> 03:09:49.987
You fraud, Del Bigtree.

03:09:50.708 --> 03:09:54.069
You fraud, Mary Holland, Pauly Tommy.

03:09:55.330 --> 03:09:58.332
Frickin' Meryl Nass, pieces of shit.

03:09:59.124 --> 03:10:00.084
Like, I love emergency room.

03:10:00.104 --> 03:10:01.005
I love intensive care units.

03:10:01.045 --> 03:10:01.505
I'm Moonlit.

03:10:01.545 --> 03:10:05.467
I was the only resident to Moonlight as a NICU, neonatal intensive care physician, before I even graduated residency.

03:10:05.567 --> 03:10:06.087
I loved it.

03:10:06.387 --> 03:10:07.167
I like procedures.

03:10:07.227 --> 03:10:08.088
You know, I loved all that.

03:10:08.128 --> 03:10:12.409
But I knew going into medical school that I didn't like the idea of prescribing drugs when we can change lifestyle and diet.

03:10:12.429 --> 03:10:13.570
And that's how I was raised.

03:10:13.810 --> 03:10:16.111
My parents, thank God, in their 90s, amazingly healthy.

03:10:16.251 --> 03:10:16.831
They lived by that.

03:10:17.351 --> 03:10:17.932
I was raised by that.

03:10:18.152 --> 03:10:19.072
And that's how I wanted to be.

03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:35.357
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I believe with all of my heart and soul, I believe with all of my heart and soul that if I would have been allowed to meet Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark, I could have convinced them, they would have believed that these guys are on a script.

03:10:35.777 --> 03:10:36.757
They would have believed it.

03:10:37.358 --> 03:10:38.598
Not only would they have believed it,

03:10:39.939 --> 03:10:46.722
insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:10:47.062 --> 03:10:52.005
But Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark would have both understood this biology that I'm teaching.

03:10:52.045 --> 03:11:06.491
They would have both understood how an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals largely composed of bacteriophages could be easily misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen with simple use of shitty PCR tests.

03:11:06.531 --> 03:11:08.252
More importantly, I think Brandy Vaughn

03:11:08.732 --> 03:11:16.680
And Tony Bark would have embraced the idea that these people would not have done it if they didn't have a biological phenomenon behind which to hide.

03:11:17.181 --> 03:11:24.088
A predictable biological signal that they could misconstrue as spread with the use of some manslaughter and lies.

03:11:24.428 --> 03:11:31.355
And I can guarantee you that Tony Bark would have definitely understood that using supplementary oxygen in the O.R.

03:11:31.375 --> 03:11:31.635
or using

03:11:32.656 --> 03:11:39.879
using supplementary oxygen in the ER and putting people who can talk on ventilators would have been manslaughter.

03:11:39.959 --> 03:11:56.827
Toni Barke would have been able to say that very consistently, and if I would have shown her that there was a population pyramid problem in need of managing, she would have known exactly what I meant when I said that they could have sculpted it using manslaughter and lies, because it was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

03:11:56.847 --> 03:11:58.628
You wouldn't have to kill very many people.

03:11:59.128 --> 03:12:00.530
you could just let them die.

03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:08.762
And she would have definitely understood that making a list of all the ways that people died that didn't include the virus would have been important to debunking the myth.

03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:19.434
I think Tony Bark would have understood that endemicity is a myth and why that's such a biologically important thing to teach.

03:12:19.834 --> 03:12:23.656
I think she would have understood that placebo would have been the easiest way to pull this off.

03:12:24.016 --> 03:12:30.859
And I think she would have loved the statement that using their test to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

03:12:31.259 --> 03:12:36.142
I think Tony Bark and I would have broken this like you can't even believe.

03:12:37.591 --> 03:12:39.152
And I think that's why she's dead.

03:12:39.212 --> 03:12:42.174
And I think that's why I'm being censored and ignored.

03:12:42.214 --> 03:12:44.376
I think that's why nobody talks to Mark Kulak.

03:12:44.936 --> 03:12:49.680
And I think that's why there's a fake anti-vax health freedom movement in America.

03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:53.042
And if we don't wake up now, America will be lost.

03:12:53.242 --> 03:12:54.583
The West will be destroyed.

03:12:54.623 --> 03:13:01.408
And our kids will be enslaved by the next iteration of social media and digital ID.

03:13:02.809 --> 03:13:03.710
These are the traitors.

03:13:04.310 --> 03:13:04.971
Not all of them.

03:13:05.526 --> 03:13:06.247
But a lot of them.

03:13:06.507 --> 03:13:12.631
And they were all in Romania together because it's one scripted, traitorous show.

03:13:13.332 --> 03:13:16.354
Mike Yeadon, you have been exposed.

03:13:16.574 --> 03:13:20.057
You are one of the worst humans on the planet.

03:13:20.117 --> 03:13:21.438
You should have been in this shot.

03:13:21.598 --> 03:13:22.459
You really should have been.

03:14:23.939 --> 03:14:25.861
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooey.

03:14:25.881 --> 03:14:27.802
I'm chief biologist at Gigome Biological.

03:14:27.842 --> 03:14:34.268
You can find the stain of my academic work on the PubMed website, National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

03:14:34.768 --> 03:14:39.172
And you can use my last name, Cooey, and first name, first initials, JJ.

03:14:39.192 --> 03:14:40.933
You can also see my work on the Woodhouse 76.

03:14:43.375 --> 03:14:52.422
Sub stack and you can also find my work in the Wuhan cover-up book published by Children's Health Defense Skyhorse publishing and written by Robert F. Kennedy jr.

03:14:52.482 --> 03:14:57.766
Kinda I used to be barbecue buddies with Jay Bhattacharya, but now I kind of understand him as a

03:14:58.306 --> 03:14:59.667
one of these scripted traders.

03:14:59.707 --> 03:15:00.908
Thanks very much for being here.

03:15:00.948 --> 03:15:02.169
I do have a YouTube channel.

03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:03.730
I may even be streaming to it now.

03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:04.350
I'm not sure.

03:15:05.251 --> 03:15:06.372
Anyway, thanks for being here.

03:15:06.412 --> 03:15:11.135
If you're unaware of how this works, it's sharing the work that gets this around.

03:15:11.235 --> 03:15:13.777
And I have a few supporters that support me each week.

03:15:14.557 --> 03:15:18.640
And they are supporting me through one of the links at GigaOMBiological.com.

03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:22.562
Thank you very much for considering the possibility of supporting this work and my family.

03:15:23.183 --> 03:15:24.464
See you tomorrow!
