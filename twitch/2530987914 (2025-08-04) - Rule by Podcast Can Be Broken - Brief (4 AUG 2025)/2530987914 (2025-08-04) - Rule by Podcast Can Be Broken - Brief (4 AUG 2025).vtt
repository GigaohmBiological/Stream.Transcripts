00:23.162 --> 00:23.902
if if

00:35.645 --> 00:44.672
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

00:44.692 --> 00:53.700
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

00:53.720 --> 01:02.206
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:02.927 --> 01:11.229
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:31.485 --> 01:34.766
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

01:35.006 --> 01:35.467
It can't.

01:36.087 --> 01:39.848
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:40.749 --> 01:44.870
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

01:44.890 --> 01:50.312
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

01:50.592 --> 01:51.052
It can't.

01:51.673 --> 01:55.414
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:55.434 --> 02:00.416
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:01.087 --> 02:05.929
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:06.149 --> 02:18.374
Transfections rather than vaccines.

02:27.449 --> 02:32.655
That doesn't look fake and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:33.576 --> 02:38.901
That doesn't look fake and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:39.662 --> 02:44.968
That doesn't look fake and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:46.752 --> 02:53.875
And I think there was just something about that doesn't look fake, and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:53.895 --> 02:54.335
Right.

02:54.355 --> 03:13.483
Just like all of you are, and we bring a particular evolutionary toolkit that most people don't have, but we'd love for everyone to have it, and we bring particular experiences that, you know, that happen to mean that we know stuff about science funding and bats and, you know, and such that, like, and public health that, you know, the so-called experts probably didn't see coming.

03:13.772 --> 03:13.932
Yep.

03:14.513 --> 03:15.794
Um, so, okay.

03:15.994 --> 03:16.614
So I think.

03:34.892 --> 03:49.098
So the reason I came to this understanding and even like approach this topic is because I saw a video in, I want to say March or April of 2020, and it was Dr. Tom Cowan speaking.

03:49.819 --> 03:52.840
And in that video, Dr. Cowan was addressing

03:53.280 --> 04:07.673
You know, if you were following a pot of dolphins off of the coast of Florida or somewhere, I don't remember the exact example you used, but if you're following a pot of dolphins and you notice a lot of the dolphins began dying, what would be your first reaction?

04:08.094 --> 04:11.357
And then someone in the audience answered, who put some shit in the water?

04:11.917 --> 04:13.097
And he was like, exactly.

04:13.317 --> 04:18.759
Our reaction isn't to say, oh, what virus is causing these dolphins to die?

04:19.339 --> 04:20.820
It's who put something in the water.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.240
How are these dolphins poisoned?

04:22.320 --> 04:29.562
Or maybe their food source was cut off because the food source was poisoned or they're in an area that was lacking on the food that they needed.

04:29.623 --> 04:29.803
Right.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.664
And that was such a shocking paradigm shift for me.

04:33.684 --> 04:36.064
But it made intuitive sense because I was already living in that way.

04:36.084 --> 04:37.145
I was like, oh, my goodness.

04:38.185 --> 04:59.325
So like it's not that the virus is but then like the more that I explored it because he didn't outright say like, look, my understanding now that for people who are not familiar with this, if I say viruses as pathogenic disease causing agents don't don't exist or haven't been proven to exist, that like that statement without the context is shocking.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.606
And that's not what I heard.

05:01.047 --> 05:02.488
I hadn't heard that statement until.

05:03.769 --> 05:08.511
eight to nine months ago and I already had a foundational understanding of like some of this stuff.

05:08.531 --> 05:17.876
So I was like, huh, like that sounds so outlandish and crazy, but I'm going to explore it because I'd heard that video from Dr. Cowan and have obsessively explored this basically throughout the entirety of COVID.

05:18.516 --> 05:23.319
Yes, these products are poisonous and we'll get into all that during this episode.

05:24.019 --> 05:36.629
But the point that I'm getting at is I try to educate people on the brilliance, the innate intelligence, the ability to adapt, the ability to self-regenerate, self-heal of the human body.

05:37.209 --> 05:48.999
Because if you educate people on that while also giving facts related to vaccines, but not doing it from like a fear position like, hey, you need to be deathly afraid because we know that fear itself is a great

05:49.719 --> 06:09.282
impact or has a great impact on disease outcomes the placebo nocebo effects psychosomatic etc etc but if you educate people on the brilliance of the human body it takes out the need to ever receive one of these products in the first place because if you truly understand how miraculous this is this is the best technology ever created created by the creator

06:10.083 --> 06:15.385
Man can only create in the image of that and will always be inferior to that which was created by God.

06:15.465 --> 06:18.286
And because of that, this thing is so miraculous.

06:18.306 --> 06:26.188
And if you can get people to truly understand it and embody that, their need to ever get one of those products goes out the window in the first place.

06:26.228 --> 06:27.829
And of course, it's always helpful to have

06:28.309 --> 06:32.150
additional information like, okay, what actually happened with the 1986 NVCIA?

06:32.190 --> 06:35.731
What happened with, what are aluminum adjuvants actually about?

06:35.771 --> 06:36.791
Is there any safety studies on that?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.471
Double blind, randomized control trials.

06:38.491 --> 06:41.492
We're gonna get into all the information here, but that's sort of the position that I've taken.

06:42.112 --> 06:49.234
And you can see even the people who have been injured, they have now hope that like, oh wow, my body is incredible.

06:49.394 --> 06:50.414
I can heal from this now.

06:50.454 --> 06:52.934
It's a long road ahead for a lot of those people.

06:53.475 --> 06:54.655
Don't get me wrong, but,

06:55.595 --> 07:11.911
The point is, I think if we can focus on helping people understand that in addition to sharing the information on vaccines, I think it then drops the fear and makes it so, wait, fear is the paradigm that has conditioned me to think I need these things in the first place.

07:12.592 --> 07:15.693
Now I don't have any fear because I know how brilliant this thing is.

07:16.293 --> 07:17.293
Why would I need to get one of those?

07:17.353 --> 07:18.213
I don't need to get any of those.

07:18.233 --> 07:18.934
That's ridiculous.

07:19.494 --> 07:21.474
And so that's sort of the position that I've taken.

07:21.494 --> 07:22.875
I think it's been somewhat effective.

07:22.895 --> 07:26.115
And to your other point, this is really cool, full circle.

07:26.135 --> 07:27.536
It's actually because of you.

07:27.556 --> 07:31.477
So in late 2016, early 2017, I think you had made a post at that time

07:37.955 --> 07:40.177
about vaccine ingredients.

07:40.938 --> 07:54.052
And I shared it on my Facebook, just vaccine ingredients, like listed the excipient list and listed either by the CDC or the who, I don't remember at the time, but may have been the FDA, but nonetheless, vaccine excipient list.

07:54.878 --> 08:12.695
And I just shared on my Facebook, and this was like my first entry into vaccines, West Point classmate of mine who is going through medical school at the time, a few graduates from West Point are able to go to medical school as part of the Army, comments on it publicly and basically shaming me for even questioning vaccines.

08:13.296 --> 08:16.079
Full circle moment, and I shared this on my Facebook a few months ago.

08:17.395 --> 08:24.057
He has now come around, he's a practicing physician, come around to saying, hey, dude, I gotta give you credit.

08:24.777 --> 08:37.081
Your work that you've done over the past few years, I've been silently watching, this is paraphrasing, but I have now fully understood exactly what you were trying to get at back then, and I have to say you were right.

08:37.481 --> 08:41.183
And it's weird for me to say this as a physician, but you were 100% right.

08:41.603 --> 08:45.044
So the point of planting seeds, I had no clue

08:46.348 --> 08:49.030
I had no clue who was going to listen to what I was saying at that time.

08:50.391 --> 08:54.134
But coming full circle, here's a physician saying like, oh, no, I now see.

08:54.675 --> 08:55.535
I see what's going on.

08:55.575 --> 08:57.517
I see the truth of this whole vaccine paradigm.

08:57.557 --> 09:06.804
And I applaud you and appreciate you for just continuing to plant seeds and just trusting that they will fall on ripe soil where they need to and then proliferate.

09:06.844 --> 09:08.165
And then those people will spread seeds.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.207
And that's all we can continue to do on this topic.

09:14.609 --> 09:23.764
Et omnes iniquitatis mea estelle.

09:29.304 --> 09:46.774
such an obsession of mine that I would be in the office from nine to six and I'd come home and I'd fix a little stir fry for dinner and I'd run upstairs to my upstairs office and I would be looking going through as much as I could find about each one of the vaccines till two or three o'clock in the morning, seven days a week.

09:47.634 --> 09:48.735
There were times when I took

09:49.255 --> 10:03.268
two to three weeks off from my clinic practice, I found a little place on the beach in California, in Encinitas, and I'd go out there for three weeks and do nothing for 18 hours a day but research and write about this.

10:03.288 --> 10:07.732
I had to rent out studios and all those recording things and stuff like that.

10:08.132 --> 10:12.696
So that's kind of how more and more and more information started to get out there.

10:13.256 --> 10:17.420
And now 25 years in September, it'll be 25 years since I've been doing this.

10:17.640 --> 10:17.980
Wow.

10:18.140 --> 10:29.650
And I still that's my whole life, you know, because it started, you know, it's like if I'm not sleeping, I'm generally eating, writing, talking, investigating, researching something about vaccines.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.313
And I really have stuck with it because it's what God told me to do.

10:34.394 --> 10:35.935
I just sat there, just froze.

10:36.716 --> 10:41.860
And I just started sobbing because I realized that that's truly what they teach physicians.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.703
It's not about all the garbage that's being injected into these little human beings.

10:47.204 --> 10:52.928
It's about the defective child that can't stand up from the assault of all this poison.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.850
And I was just sobbing.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.412
And I just said, Lord, why'd you give me this to do?

10:58.472 --> 11:01.115
Why didn't you give me Tony Robbins go team rah-rah?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.456
I mean, why did you give me this to do?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.756
And I'm just crying and crying.

11:05.237 --> 11:12.780
And I heard him say, I heard a voice out loud, and I was the only person in the house, out loud say, because you're willing to do the work.

11:13.580 --> 11:20.303
And it's like, I sat there for a second and I kind of looked around and I thought, well, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.084
So I've never really stopped.

11:23.384 --> 11:27.126
And, and for the first three years, I was really angry.

11:35.522 --> 11:47.215
Othello, Ibigo spia sumus, et in fia scegol per tecum.

11:54.501 --> 11:59.667
I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked.

11:59.968 --> 12:06.956
And I should point out that actually we are, in an interesting sense, a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar.

12:07.699 --> 12:11.040
So if I'm correct, you, Robert, have had COVID.

12:11.260 --> 12:14.121
I've had COVID, and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna.

12:14.362 --> 12:14.682
All right.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.743
Steve, you have been vaccinated.

12:18.703 --> 12:20.024
Fully vaccinated with Moderna.

12:20.324 --> 12:20.624
All right.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.985
I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin.

12:24.325 --> 12:36.090
And the data actually, shocking as this will be to some people, the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting COVID when taken properly.

12:36.650 --> 12:58.676
So aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't real, and I have every reason to think it was, it certainly appears to be the genuine article, I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity, where through three different routes, COVID, vaccine, and ivermectin, we are protected.

12:58.716 --> 12:59.016
And you are.

12:59.036 --> 13:01.097
That's one thing I forgot to say on the stream.

13:05.040 --> 13:12.424
There are a lot of people analyzing what's going on with Trump, the Trump administration, MAGA, etc.

13:13.164 --> 13:13.745
in a vacuum.

13:14.965 --> 13:18.267
And, you know, somebody asked me the other day, well, do you do you regret your vote yet?

13:20.069 --> 13:21.530
I don't regret my vote at all.

13:22.831 --> 13:24.112
Do you see who was running?

13:24.272 --> 13:25.493
Did you see what the other side did?

13:26.434 --> 13:33.158
They tried to run Biden in his decrepit state and then they substituted somebody else who was decrepit in a totally different way.

13:34.099 --> 13:35.300
No, this was the right thing to do.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.762
That doesn't mean I'm not troubled by

13:39.079 --> 13:44.488
all kinds of features of this, divide and conquer is obviously going to be their strategy.

13:44.688 --> 13:53.042
On the other hand, we have to, you know, in my opinion, you can't let the Epstein issue go just as you can't let the COVID issue go.

14:25.803 --> 14:39.248
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like JJ Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as by some people as sort of this kind of

14:40.908 --> 14:47.891
savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt.

14:47.951 --> 14:49.592
And in many ways, they are.

14:50.272 --> 14:53.214
But that's throwing baby out of bathwater.

14:53.274 --> 15:03.899
I mean, the best thinkers in the world all trawl through and suffer through the consequences of ten bad ideas for every good one, you know, the best creative thinkers.

15:04.899 --> 15:18.934
And so if you're going to jump on every one of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with, that you don't agree with, and use that as tar to smear the person, I think that's just, you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself.

15:19.455 --> 15:22.738
You won't find the muses, the creative inspiration.

15:23.539 --> 15:25.420
So I certainly think that J.J.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.241
Cooley's overall take is very good.

15:28.441 --> 15:37.706
Over the course of a couple of years I've come around to a lot of the thinking of Mike Eden, who I initially regarded as being several shades too dark.

15:38.945 --> 15:52.533
in terms of his review, but I've realised that there are my ways, and I used to err on some of my thinking when it came to points of disagreement.

15:53.293 --> 15:58.156
Fortunately, despite those points of disagreement, we always maintained a cordial engagement.

16:00.723 --> 16:07.987
You know, we have like an 80 year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection, and this has never been a problem for any other vaccine.

16:08.027 --> 16:10.709
And I just don't see why it would be for for these vaccines.

16:11.950 --> 16:19.214
You know, we have like an 80 year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection, and this has never been a problem for any other vaccine.

16:19.254 --> 16:21.916
And I just don't see why it would be for for these vaccines.

16:26.079 --> 16:32.143
Hey guys, it's ZDoggMD, VPMD, Vinay Prasad, Marty McCary.

16:32.403 --> 16:32.884
Three M's.

16:33.264 --> 16:34.285
Three M's.

16:34.325 --> 16:35.385
Good to see you guys.

16:35.405 --> 16:40.108
Dude, we're the three horsemen of the COVID apocalypse according to pretty much everybody.

16:40.148 --> 16:41.409
We're doing a show, we're gonna talk about all things.

16:41.429 --> 16:45.872
We're gonna talk about therapeutics, boosters, we're gonna talk about Omicron.

16:46.232 --> 16:51.113
I like to say I put the accent on the wrong syllable because it sounds more like a Decepticon than ever.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.814
And we're going to talk about why we're sitting so close together.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.254
Why don't you start?

16:55.354 --> 16:56.674
He doesn't have a third microphone.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.055
Yeah, third microphone.

16:58.075 --> 17:00.655
You know, my supporters fund the show and they're cheap.

17:00.755 --> 17:02.056
They're so cheap.

17:02.136 --> 17:02.876
All these resources.

17:02.916 --> 17:03.456
Yeah, yeah.

17:03.496 --> 17:05.316
You guys boosted being that close.

17:05.336 --> 17:07.457
Is this an unboosted contact?

17:07.557 --> 17:11.158
We're unmasked, unboosted, and unrepentant, Marty.

17:13.769 --> 17:14.950
Well, I'm an unboosted male.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.411
That's my preferred pronoun, by the way.

17:16.471 --> 17:17.232
Oh, is that your pronoun?

17:17.292 --> 17:17.872
Unboosted male?

17:17.912 --> 17:18.092
Yeah.

17:19.613 --> 17:32.963
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape, and they just don't have the latitude to act unilaterally.

17:34.909 --> 17:36.071
Big financial ties.

17:36.591 --> 17:41.798
Probably the worst historically was Paul Offit, University of Pennsylvania professor.

17:41.858 --> 17:42.399
Listen to this.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.482
Big financial ties.

17:45.002 --> 17:50.209
Probably the worst historically was Paul Offit, University of Pennsylvania professor.

17:50.269 --> 17:50.770
Listen to this.

18:41.158 --> 18:44.919
Amongst the people who we now know well, the people who

18:46.520 --> 19:00.149
figured out how to think their way through COVID and found each other and became the movement of COVID dissidents, there is a high degree of religious faith.

19:00.790 --> 19:01.130
There is.

19:01.650 --> 19:05.493
It's interesting, and I always took that to imply that

19:07.691 --> 19:18.174
There's something about the courage that one gets from thinking, you know, well, there's only so much they can do to me down here on earth, but this matters in some context they can't do anything about.

19:18.534 --> 19:29.817
If you have that faith, it probably emboldens you to face down what's frankly otherwise very frightening forms of coercion.

19:30.557 --> 19:35.779
My father wrote a note, a quote from Emerson, where he said, if a single man

19:36.806 --> 19:43.689
plant himself firmly on his own ideal and there abide, a whole wide world will come around to him.

19:44.669 --> 19:57.895
For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country.

19:57.915 --> 20:05.898
On August 23rd of last year, God sent me President Trump, all right, and he gave me

20:15.339 --> 20:18.502
And then the worst president in the history of our country took over.

20:19.042 --> 20:21.284
And look what happened to our country.

20:22.205 --> 20:23.806
Probably 20 million people.

20:24.747 --> 20:28.490
If you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.

20:37.617 --> 20:39.158
Friends said, turn on your television.

20:39.379 --> 20:40.359
Trump has been shot.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.021
The thought was, oh my God, what's happened?

20:43.622 --> 20:44.663
He's on top of the roof.

20:45.768 --> 20:48.031
Do we need a medic here?

21:15.283 --> 21:27.676
It seems that history has pivoted in this profound way.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.061
It caused

21:34.122 --> 21:36.043
my mind to go into overdrive.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.663
What can I bring to bear?

21:37.904 --> 21:44.086
Do I have anything that applies here that might steer us in the right direction?

21:44.106 --> 21:45.046
I have an audience.

21:46.767 --> 21:50.488
My son, Zach, who was the producer of our podcast, and I went out.

21:51.029 --> 21:54.490
I sat down on a piece of driftwood and we started recording.

21:55.951 --> 21:59.632
After the attempt on President Trump's life on Saturday, I did a fair amount of thinking.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.773
A number of things had become apparent.

22:02.768 --> 22:10.342
First, if President Trump had not turned his head at the exact moment he did, we would likely be living in a very different world today.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.008
President Trump dodged a bullet, and so did the Republic.

22:15.430 --> 22:35.264
Irrespective of the ultimate explanation for the attempt on President Trump's life, it is quite clear that denying adequate Secret Service protection to President Trump, and denying any protection at all to Bobby Kennedy, is tantamount to the inhabitants of the executive branch inviting the murder of their political opponents.

22:36.965 --> 22:42.870
That would be a shocking assertion if we had also not seen the ruthless weaponization of the courts,

22:43.826 --> 22:48.730
and the abridgment of First Amendment rights, all in an effort to avoid a free and fair election.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.992
Our institutions have been weaponized against the public.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.714
Our universities peddle radical nonsense.

22:55.154 --> 22:58.497
Our newspapers bend over backwards to avoid reporting the news.

22:59.217 --> 23:03.740
Our tax dollars are poured into holes carved in the universe for reasons that are never explained.

23:04.861 --> 23:06.283
These problems are dire.

23:06.923 --> 23:11.488
They are going to require solutions that are beyond what any one man can deliver.

23:11.969 --> 23:16.594
What we need to do is unrig our system and refound the republic.

23:17.815 --> 23:25.183
President Trump, the country needs you to join forces with Bobby Kennedy and name him as your vice presidential running mate.

23:26.024 --> 23:26.424
And Bobby,

23:27.403 --> 23:28.804
The country needs you to accept.

23:29.484 --> 23:34.726
If you run independently and they take you out, they solve a problem from their perspective.

23:35.506 --> 23:38.347
If you run together, they only make their problems worse.

23:40.008 --> 23:44.189
Our nation suffered a great trauma in 1963 and another in 1968.

23:44.869 --> 23:49.071
That pattern threatened to repeat itself this last Saturday.

23:50.253 --> 24:09.305
President Trump, by selecting Bobby Kennedy as your vice presidential running mate, you would take a great stride to ending that pattern once and for all and restoring the democratic republic that was the vision of our founders by enabling Bobby Kennedy to carry the torch when you leave office at the end of your second four-year term.

24:12.196 --> 24:20.885
Now, that video did not have the effect that I had hoped, but the response to it was so powerful that I knew I had hit on something.

24:21.605 --> 24:24.708
People were hungry for that style of thinking.

24:27.591 --> 24:34.038
It wasn't the format that I had hoped and expected, but in some ways, what happened was even better.

24:35.663 --> 24:55.728
Last summer, it looked like no candidate was willing to negotiate a quick end to the Ukraine war, to tackle chronic disease epidemic, to protect free speech, our constitutional freedoms, to clean corporate influence out of our government, or to defy the neocons and their agenda of endless military adventurism.

24:56.729 --> 25:01.250
But now one of the two candidates has adopted these issues as his own.

25:02.315 --> 25:06.876
to the point where he has asked to enlist me in his administration.

25:08.117 --> 25:09.957
I'm speaking, of course, of Donald Trump.

25:11.737 --> 25:19.520
In a series of long, intense discussions, I was surprised to discover that we are aligned on many key issues.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.701
In those meetings, he suggested that we join forces as a unity party.

25:25.821 --> 25:28.562
We talked about Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals.

25:29.983 --> 25:45.749
That arrangement would allow us to disagree publicly and privately and fiercely if need be on issues over which we differ while working together on the existential issues upon which we are in concordance.

25:47.210 --> 25:54.593
If I'm given the chance to fix the chronic disease crisis and reform our food production, I promise that within two years,

25:55.649 --> 25:58.391
We will watch chronic disease burden lift dramatically.

25:59.512 --> 26:01.193
We will make Americans healthy again.

26:01.973 --> 26:05.536
President Trump has told me that he wants this to be his legacy.

26:06.617 --> 26:09.319
I'm choosing to believe that this time he will follow through.

26:11.440 --> 26:22.268
Tonight, I'm very pleased to welcome a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share and we've shared them for a long time.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.034
I don't think too many of you people have heard of him.

26:27.795 --> 26:28.796
He's very low-key.

26:28.816 --> 26:34.724
He's a very low-key person, but he's highly respected.

26:35.505 --> 26:36.806
He is a great person.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.388
I've known him for so long.

26:38.468 --> 26:42.073
For the past 16 months, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

26:44.890 --> 26:56.897
Watching the electricity in that room as Bobby Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, stepped on stage next to Donald Trump and the crowd went wild for it.

26:56.917 --> 27:01.480
That told anybody who knew anything about American politics that something brand new was afoot.

27:02.040 --> 27:14.070
And watching Donald Trump willing to share the stage with this charismatic character, part of some iconic American story, also said that maybe Donald Trump was in a new place.

27:14.631 --> 27:18.034
So the idea of unity was clearly in the air.

27:18.414 --> 27:19.375
It was energized.

27:19.495 --> 27:21.076
It was ready to be activated.

27:21.277 --> 27:28.623
But what wasn't there was something that could take the concept of unity and broaden it beyond MAGA, even beyond

27:29.103 --> 27:30.544
make America healthy again.

27:30.804 --> 27:36.849
There are many more issues that are part of that coalition and they all needed to be joined into one thing.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.389
It's been a while since we've done a podcast.

28:00.809 --> 28:01.489
I've been busy.

28:01.509 --> 28:08.490
But my guest today is one of my great old friends, Brad Weinstein.

28:08.710 --> 28:14.572
And we're going to talk about our big rally coming up in Washington, the Rescue the Republic rally.

28:14.592 --> 28:17.853
This rally is a call to the barricades.

28:18.853 --> 28:23.074
This is a new American movement.

28:23.434 --> 28:24.494
This is not MAGA.

28:24.554 --> 28:25.774
It contains MAGA.

28:25.794 --> 28:27.555
But this is much bigger than MAGA.

28:50.792 --> 28:57.223
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people And I have lied.

28:57.243 --> 28:58.285
I'm sure I'll lie again.

28:58.305 --> 28:59.246
I don't want to lie.

28:59.727 --> 29:02.211
You know, I don't think I'm a liar I try not to be a liar.

29:02.231 --> 29:03.032
I don't want to be a liar

29:11.673 --> 29:13.254
I think truth is good for kids.

29:13.675 --> 29:17.498
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

29:17.959 --> 29:20.221
We want everybody to feel good.

29:20.541 --> 29:21.702
That's not the way life is.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.422
Good morning and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

29:52.502 --> 30:02.469
My throat is not in operational condition today, so I am sort of taking the day off, but I'm still streaming and I'm still here.

30:05.513 --> 30:29.234
I just want to play this video and let it fall into the context of what we're dealing with here I think this should be pretty obvious just to remind you it's 2025 I want you to stay focused on the biology I don't want you to take their bait on social media I don't even want you on social media anymore and I want you to try and meet and love your real neighbors again

30:30.345 --> 30:36.350
Biology is definitely the way and I will be around don't worry This is not the end or something like that.

30:36.390 --> 30:37.450
I just need a break.

30:37.510 --> 30:53.662
I guess this is Remember that in 2024 a C Mahaltra was a guest of Steve Kirsch He's now the advisor for Maha and he's been on lots and lots of podcasts, but the very first time I

30:54.537 --> 31:09.490
that he ever appeared was actually on stage in Stockholm, Sweden in January of 2023 with Meryl Ness, Sasha Latupova, Mike Palmer, Asim Malhotra, and Robert Malone.

31:09.510 --> 31:14.995
And I would really like to focus your attention on the talk that Robert Malone gave

31:15.934 --> 31:25.147
as an emu farmer and horse breeder and vaccine expert and multiple Skyhorse publishing CHD author.

31:26.309 --> 31:30.595
Let's recall what he focused on in January of 2023.

31:39.719 --> 31:41.401
So thanks, that's a hard act to follow.

31:42.121 --> 31:49.928
I want to just thank Asim for covering almost everything that I now no longer have to cover.

31:51.370 --> 31:58.116
And what Asim has kind of told you a lot about is what has been done to you.

31:59.904 --> 32:04.326
And what I want to talk about is some sensitive stuff, some strong language.

32:04.886 --> 32:15.270
And I understand that here in Sweden, these words might seem very strong to some, but this is the name of this technology.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.111
I didn't invent this name.

32:18.271 --> 32:24.113
This is the technology that's been deployed on you over the last three years, and all of us.

32:24.273 --> 32:28.275
And at the start, I also want to give a shout out for your nation.

32:29.564 --> 32:31.245
and for your public health leadership.

32:33.847 --> 32:47.755
So now the most important thing to understand here is that what the main enchantment that Robert Malone is gonna engage in here is he's gonna describe to you that people are doing something to you.

32:48.595 --> 32:54.879
He's gonna tell you you have no chance to figure out who it is and that's because it's him.

32:55.905 --> 33:04.790
That's because it's everybody on stage purporting to tell you that you're in trouble, that we're going to rally, that we are going to beat this.

33:05.991 --> 33:18.918
Meryl Ness, Robert Malone, Sasha Latupova, Asim Malhotra, Mike Palmer are all scripted international actors working for I don't know who and I don't claim to know who.

33:19.909 --> 33:22.831
but they are scripted traitors to our grandchildren.

33:22.891 --> 33:46.150
And it's very difficult to explain it to people until you can really step back far enough and understand that everyone who rises in social media to the point of being in clear view is an already screened, approved, program to rise, scripted actor.

33:47.259 --> 34:02.164
saying scripted traitor turns a lot of people off because quite frankly it's very easy to imagine why lots of people who've rallied around these people think they're doing the right thing and i do actually understand that the better

34:03.064 --> 34:06.945
that illusion is, the more easy it is to sustain.

34:07.005 --> 34:16.328
So if it's only Meryl Nass and Robert Malone that know the full extent of the deception, that's actually better for the team.

34:17.068 --> 34:25.110
And so they are scripted actors, but they are scripted actors on an extremely rigid

34:26.483 --> 34:27.704
need-to-know basis.

34:28.425 --> 34:36.871
And only people like Robert Malone or Kevin McKernan or a few others know all or most of the script.

34:37.632 --> 34:48.160
The rest have been purposefully left in the dark about most things and purposely given talking points to focus on during the course of the pandemic.

34:48.561 --> 34:55.326
It's a script that gets dealt out, and it is dealt out very meticulously and with intention.

34:57.307 --> 35:11.796
And it is very interesting to think that one of the only times that he gave a presentation like this was in Stockholm, Sweden in January of 2023, exactly when all the murder in America was going to come to a complete stop.

35:15.479 --> 35:21.603
It really, to the rest of the world, what happened here was unique.

35:22.856 --> 35:38.888
Though there was more of a willingness, even though nothing's perfect, to stay grounded in public health policy, sound public health policy, avoid a lot of the extreme measures that have been propagated throughout the Western world.

35:39.608 --> 35:48.315
And it's so easy for us to focus on the bad, but I just want to give a moment and acknowledge the good that's happened here.

35:49.724 --> 36:00.887
The rest of the world has benefited from the courage of those that have stood up and advocated for public health policies that did not include a lot of these harsh measures for our children.

36:02.107 --> 36:15.331
And I think because of that courage, the world has had a comparator to show that we really didn't have to have a lot of these egregiously harsh policies that have been deployed on all of us.

36:17.503 --> 36:24.607
The COVID crisis has revealed a modern battleground in which molding, controlling, and capturing your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs are the objective.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.769
I'm gonna speak about fifth-generation warfare.

36:29.249 --> 36:31.390
As I said, this is not a term that I invented.

36:32.451 --> 36:45.898
Fifth-generation warfare is the new battleground, and it has been deployed by military, largely, and intelligence communities on the entire Western world in an amazingly harmonized fashion.

36:46.317 --> 36:48.558
in an amazingly harmonized fashion.

36:48.618 --> 36:59.522
Now what you're supposed to think in this fifth generation warfare is that build back better was the, the amazingly harmonized fashion.

36:59.582 --> 37:04.104
The killing of African presidents was the amazingly harmonized thing.

37:04.624 --> 37:10.426
The messaging about lockdowns was the amazingly harmonized thing, but no, it wasn't.

37:12.552 --> 37:34.379
It was the amazing coordination of the skeptical parts of the narrative, the neuro component of the novel virus, the fear and cleavage site, the clockwork like construction of the genome that included HIV inserts leaked exclusively from an Indian scientist.

37:36.678 --> 38:05.194
So what he is doing, did to all of us, including me in January of 2023, is bamboozle you into believing that he is a whistleblower, he's on our team, and he is at the cutting edge of understanding how it is that these people have orchestrated the messaging of the pandemic without ever admitting that every person on the stage actually works, most likely,

38:05.934 --> 38:09.015
indirectly or directly for NATO and the DoD.

38:09.696 --> 38:25.643
That's what makes it also so comical that somebody who works for DITRA and DoD is on stage with someone like Sasha Latupova, who now, three years later, is pretending to be the one whistleblower on the DoD, that the DoD did COVID with kill boxes.

38:26.563 --> 38:29.845
The DoD had nothing to do with putting a whole

38:32.335 --> 38:46.378
clown car full of a motley crew of shitheads on the internet that included her daughter before the pandemic and Laura Loomer before the pandemic and Alex Jones before the pandemic.

38:48.179 --> 38:57.661
This is all one contiguous show from Alex Jones all the way to the ACIP member, 2025 Robert Malone,

39:00.305 --> 39:11.171
the hero, the controversial vaccine expert, and also, interestingly enough, author and world touring lecturer on Fifth Generation Warfare.

39:12.832 --> 39:13.953
During the COVID crisis.

39:15.053 --> 39:18.535
Fifth Generation Warfare is a war of information and perception.

39:19.896 --> 39:20.736
A strange game.

39:21.637 --> 39:23.358
The only winning move is not to play.

39:24.899 --> 39:26.119
But what does that mean?

39:26.159 --> 39:28.521
The only winning move is not to play means?

39:29.397 --> 39:33.121
He's not going to say it, but what it means is you've got to get off of social media.

39:34.062 --> 39:42.070
You've got to stop following people that social media is trying to convince you with lots of other posts and reposts that these people are heroes.

39:42.090 --> 39:46.495
You've got to start evaluating what people say and the actions that they take.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.839
And if they can't explain their stance simply,

39:51.144 --> 39:57.087
and score touchdowns with a few sentences, then these people are just full of it, because it's really very simple.

39:57.888 --> 40:02.830
Social media has been weaponized against us, and it's not the programming, it's not the algorithm.

40:03.590 --> 40:11.054
It is very specifically actors on a coordinated, need-to-know basis script.

40:13.075 --> 40:19.879
Basic idea is that in the modern era, wars are not fought by armies or guerrillas, but in the minds of common citizens.

40:22.611 --> 40:24.952
Your mind is the new battleground.

40:26.272 --> 40:29.073
Your mind is the new battleground is not a lie.

40:29.133 --> 40:30.353
It's exactly true.

40:31.173 --> 40:41.937
And how they're getting there is with your acquiescence to using social media, to scrolling and waiting for what social media is going to serve you.

40:41.977 --> 40:46.498
And the only real discernment we have is that we don't watch shorts and we don't read the ads.

40:47.038 --> 40:47.558
That's it.

40:48.879 --> 40:49.979
And that's not good enough.

40:52.216 --> 41:04.540
You have to use social media with absolute focus and intention on following people that you trust, people that have only earned your trust through a long track record of integrity.

41:04.660 --> 41:08.441
Making mistakes is part of being and having integrity.

41:10.142 --> 41:12.883
And this person is the absolute opposite of it.

41:16.063 --> 41:17.204
This is not hyperbole.

41:17.944 --> 41:20.645
This is standard military strategy.

41:21.829 --> 41:28.381
And unfortunately, the United States has led in the West in our response.

41:29.724 --> 41:32.730
The European Union has largely followed American leadership.

41:34.266 --> 41:59.199
And so I would argue that in Dutch media and on English media and in French media and in German media, there are planted, scripted actors that are probably coordinated through Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and a few other lieutenants that can keep this on the rails for five good years, even though I don't think they ever intended to have to work this long.

42:00.054 --> 42:02.615
I think they already thought they were done here in January of 2023.

42:02.655 --> 42:10.339
They were going to now pivot from the COVID narrative to the fifth generation warfare that we've all got to fight here.

42:10.399 --> 42:13.660
Cause he's not going to say a damn thing about MRNA in this talk.

42:16.521 --> 42:17.102
Quote unquote.

42:18.442 --> 42:20.123
And in America,

42:21.594 --> 42:25.618
He is absolutely channeling James Giordano.

42:25.638 --> 42:30.643
Although he's much slower, he is exactly the same kind of actor.

42:30.763 --> 42:32.685
And indeed, I would say they're equivalent.

42:34.647 --> 42:36.649
They are exactly the same role.

42:39.241 --> 42:47.823
Management of this crisis was not primarily driven, the data now show, the documents show, was not driven by Health and Human Services.

42:47.903 --> 42:49.263
It was driven by the U.S.

42:49.303 --> 42:52.323
Department of Defense and basically the national security state.

42:52.543 --> 43:06.646
And so now the careful line they're trying to walk here with Catherine Watt and Sasha Latupova is the DoD is killing people and the DoD orchestrated all of this and the DoD owns all of this and none of that makes any sense.

43:08.120 --> 43:11.422
Because he's telling you right now that that's not the battlefield.

43:11.482 --> 43:12.602
We don't do that anymore.

43:13.603 --> 43:17.845
The battlefield is getting people to accept a kill box and not even know what it is.

43:18.625 --> 43:23.507
To accept their role as experimental animal without even knowing why or what they're accepting.

43:24.688 --> 43:32.592
And the people that would be involved in it, if this was a real fifth generation warfare operation, would very specifically tell you they weren't.

43:36.417 --> 43:54.549
And in fact, one of the easiest ways to insert a scripted, but improvising national security state actor would be to allow them to, to script them to come out as Epi Girl in the Spars pandemic document or Robert Malone as the inventor of MRNA.

43:58.752 --> 44:06.237
Homeland security, domestically, our intelligence community, department of defense, um, the national security administration.

44:07.372 --> 44:09.212
That's how it came into the white house.

44:09.913 --> 44:12.053
And that's how it got delegated and managed.

44:14.333 --> 44:20.055
And as often happens, I like to say, when you give a three-year-old a hammer, everything becomes a nail.

44:20.275 --> 44:26.376
And we have this new powerful technology that's been, that's not the saying, it's not about a three-year-old.

44:26.436 --> 44:33.017
It's about when you only have, it's such a dumb thing, but that's, that's fifth generation warfare.

44:33.057 --> 44:35.338
That's neuro-linguistic programming.

44:38.001 --> 44:43.183
And very specifically what that is, is to get your mind to say that, you know, wow, that's not quite how I heard it.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.024
That's interesting.

44:44.064 --> 44:49.346
Cause now you're listening and you're paying attention to his words as he says the next words.

44:51.947 --> 44:59.231
Developed and deployed offshore for resisting fourth generation warfare, which is the insurgencies.

44:59.751 --> 45:06.774
The United States has lost very essentially every single insurgent war since Vietnam that it's engaged in.

45:08.143 --> 45:14.848
It really is important for me to just interject anything that I remember because I don't know when I'm gonna remember them again.

45:15.949 --> 45:32.562
But I was told by Mary Holland and, sorry, by Merrill Nass that Robert Malone did not know what the WEF was when they went to his farm to vet him in 2020.

45:32.702 --> 45:34.383
Let me repeat that.

45:35.103 --> 45:36.505
Merrill Nass told me

45:38.180 --> 45:53.836
In person, the night before Bobby announced his candidacy in Boston at a dinner, she told me in person that she and Mary Holland had spent two days on Robert Malone's farm to vet him in 2020.

45:54.457 --> 45:58.361
And when they did, he did not know what the WEF was.

45:58.421 --> 45:59.762
And I can't make that story up.

45:59.802 --> 46:01.404
That's exactly what she told me.

46:03.288 --> 46:11.030
And I guess three years later, he's touring the world giving TED talks about fifth generation warfare that he had no idea.

46:11.050 --> 46:16.431
Well, he worked on the Arab Spring stuff before that, but he didn't know who the WEF was.

46:16.931 --> 46:24.613
And it has now tried to transform that battlefield metaphor into what we now call fifth generation warfare.

46:26.036 --> 46:45.229
And as they've developed those tools for offshore in information management and PsyOps, for whatever reason, they determined that it was appropriate to deploy it on their own citizens in the context of what they determined was a national health emergency.

46:46.309 --> 46:47.070
What is he saying?

46:47.130 --> 46:54.335
He's saying that they deployed fifth generation warfare, which I'm telling you should be best defined as scripted,

46:55.501 --> 47:06.550
on a need-to-know basis, actors on social media that are designed to herd cats and waste people's time to make sure nobody asks useful questions.

47:08.332 --> 47:23.585
And if this was a real thing, it would look exactly like him, exactly like Sasha Latupova, exactly like Brett Weinstein, exactly like Joe Rogan, exactly like Steve Kirsch,

47:24.892 --> 47:35.561
exactly like CHD and exactly like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which they responded to as if it was a national security emergency.

47:38.003 --> 47:52.214
So my goal here is to help you to understand this new environment, the technology that was deployed, and eventually to get to the point that I want to make, which is that

47:53.274 --> 48:14.781
Those of us that are awake, and I hope that this lecture will help awaken you even more, those of us that are awake can become empowered by understanding this technology and employing it for our side, for the sake of truth, honesty, for spreading the type of information that Asim just shared with you.

48:15.781 --> 48:21.063
We're in a new information ecosystem.

48:23.729 --> 48:26.490
Enchantment that he's casting is that this is AI.

48:26.550 --> 48:27.690
This is programming.

48:27.730 --> 48:52.576
This is censorship and it isn't entirely the main feature that makes this possible is that anybody that rises into clear view is a scripted actor It's that simple and I know that that's also sucks because that means that there's nobody on the internet with a million followers that you can trust but that's the reality and

48:53.584 --> 49:03.912
The reality is if you really want to hear it straight from my mouth, I don't know for sure that anyone else on the internet is real.

49:05.613 --> 49:07.214
I only know for sure that I am.

49:08.255 --> 49:15.921
And I'm pretty sure that most or all of the people that have risen into clear view are not real.

49:16.877 --> 49:29.048
They are fully controlled, fully scripted, and any censorship that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic was designed to make those people feel like they were real themselves.

49:30.189 --> 49:34.593
If Brett Weinstein doesn't understand how he's been used, that's better for them.

49:35.894 --> 49:39.897
If Shannon Joy doesn't care about how she's being used, that's better for them.

49:40.358 --> 49:44.001
If Doc Malek just wants to get paid, that's better for them.

49:49.138 --> 50:02.145
There's only one answer that fits all the questions, and that is that it's a coordinated group, and they're all on the same script.

50:03.506 --> 50:18.014
It's a new technology space, and for protest movements, the methods that were employed during the 20th century, centralized leadership, protest movements, is now completely obsolete.

50:20.428 --> 50:21.669
So what is he talking about there?

50:21.689 --> 50:36.594
He's talking about putting people in protest movements that are controlled, you know, like, I don't know, the, the, those, those dudes with the, with the, that march around with the, with what looks like a blockbuster video outfit on and carrying the flag.

50:36.634 --> 50:48.178
I mean, the Patriot Front or whatever, those kinds of things, you know, like Tim Pool and all these planted sort of operatives that, that pretend that they're those that's done now.

50:49.332 --> 50:57.441
And instead, what we have now are multiple people, podcasters with podcasting and podcast guests.

50:57.541 --> 51:00.464
And they're kind of, I don't know what they are.

51:00.524 --> 51:03.187
They don't call themselves journalists.

51:03.207 --> 51:04.689
They don't call themselves analysts.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.711
They just call themselves podcasters.

51:07.742 --> 51:13.146
And that's how you can know in a lot of ways that these people are all just frauds.

51:13.206 --> 51:14.066
They're all frauds.

51:14.166 --> 51:19.790
Most podcasts on YouTube are actually staffed businesses.

51:21.391 --> 51:25.473
And yes, this is a sole proprietorship LLC here that last year made $38,000.

51:26.134 --> 51:35.300
And I'm managing to raise a family of five on that and do this stream a couple of three, four, five days a week.

51:36.889 --> 51:39.671
Because I really think that America is under a spell.

51:40.071 --> 51:41.132
We have been attacked.

51:41.952 --> 51:43.413
We have been usurped.

51:43.493 --> 51:46.115
We have had a silent coup of sorts.

51:47.036 --> 51:55.742
And every puppet that has Robert Malone behind them should be in jail, except they're part of the show.

51:56.573 --> 52:07.816
It's the same as the Democratic Party or the Republican Party and the agreement about talking about Epstein or not Epstein or how many shooters were there in Butler, Pennsylvania.

52:10.256 --> 52:11.457
Once you're in, you're in.

52:12.417 --> 52:18.818
Once you understand that it's governance by theater, you don't care what the script says.

52:22.219 --> 52:25.820
One part of the script isn't worse than the other if it's all fake.

52:26.673 --> 52:27.913
if it's all false.

52:29.954 --> 52:39.497
And so it's very easy for these people to just trust the script as it comes and not worry about if they improvise off a little bit or not.

52:39.537 --> 52:42.577
They know what to stick to and they've known for years.

52:42.637 --> 52:43.838
That's how we got here.

52:44.358 --> 52:46.718
America has been bamboozled.

52:47.139 --> 52:49.379
We have to come if we're going to win this.

52:50.299 --> 52:55.761
And I'm sure most of this audience appreciates that the COVID crisis is just a skirmish.

52:57.261 --> 53:04.105
The battle is much, much larger than what we're just talking about here.

53:04.465 --> 53:06.086
Again, what are they clapping about?

53:06.946 --> 53:08.147
He's telling them the truth.

53:08.247 --> 53:11.729
It is much larger because they are still going.

53:14.311 --> 53:20.074
He, three years later is now at the ACIP in America.

53:21.955 --> 53:23.876
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you can see it.

53:25.990 --> 53:28.811
You can see it, it's all one show.

53:29.012 --> 53:29.912
I need your help.

53:30.092 --> 53:32.333
If you're outside of America, I need your help.

53:32.974 --> 53:36.175
Share this stream with your American friends.

53:36.275 --> 53:39.957
Point it out on social media that Americans need to wake up.

53:40.037 --> 53:41.298
Their media is gone.

53:42.538 --> 53:46.320
Fifth Generation Warfare Rule by Podcast has been deployed.

53:46.861 --> 53:53.224
Rule by Coordinated Scripted Need to Know Basis Liars has been successful.

53:55.296 --> 53:58.438
And you can think of Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:58.798 --> 54:01.900
as need-to-know basis scripted liars.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.501
That's the best way to think of them.

54:04.401 --> 54:08.624
And if we're gonna win this battle, we have to understand the battleground.

54:09.064 --> 54:11.265
We have to understand their playing field.

54:11.726 --> 54:16.749
We have to understand their technology, their strategies, their tactics.

54:17.209 --> 54:23.573
We need to assimilate them, and we need to respond to them, not by assimilating their ethics,

54:24.912 --> 54:29.856
but by deploying technology that's appropriate for this new battle space.

54:30.456 --> 54:31.697
Okay, that's where I'm coming from.

54:33.179 --> 54:35.100
Precursors to fifth generation warfare.

54:35.140 --> 54:38.102
The first accidental fifth generation conflict was Arab Spring.

54:38.963 --> 54:44.407
Many people may not appreciate that Arab Spring was employed by the U.S.

54:44.467 --> 54:53.875
government to test, deploy some of their new technologies for manipulating thought, behavior, and action.

54:55.049 --> 54:59.171
Those key technologies we call social media.

55:01.592 --> 55:05.194
Interesting that he actually just says it out loud again, social media.

55:06.014 --> 55:07.395
So what is he gonna argue?

55:08.155 --> 55:15.779
Of course he's gonna argue that it's the alternative social media, the free speech space of X we should fight for.

55:15.819 --> 55:24.503
The free speech space platform of Substack is where he's earning all of his money, where he feels like he's free because LinkedIn

55:25.163 --> 55:27.364
Didn't work for him and getters too gay.

55:27.724 --> 55:48.111
And so, you know, that's the where he is right now Malone dot news dot substack dot-com This is the fifth generation warfare it is social media and more specifically it is the scripted actors on social media and

55:49.505 --> 56:05.693
And if you think for a second that, and this is where it really burns me, if you think for a second that the red and blue show is one party, then you have to take that assumption all the way to its logical end.

56:06.173 --> 56:07.934
There is no election then.

56:08.815 --> 56:10.296
Everybody that wins, wins.

56:10.396 --> 56:11.076
That's it.

56:11.476 --> 56:13.457
They've already closed that off.

56:13.477 --> 56:14.518
You have to accept that.

56:15.518 --> 56:16.919
And yet none of these people do.

56:20.219 --> 56:35.048
You have to accept the fact that all of these dramas and trials and victories in court or failure in court or arguments about constitutionality are also just scripted bullshit.

56:37.229 --> 56:41.912
It can't possibly be serious that the PBS NewsHour did a whole week

56:42.904 --> 56:48.986
of discussing the implications of what was going on with the Black Book of Epstein or not.

56:49.066 --> 57:02.731
It's just impossible that that's not scripted if you believe that the red and blue, that it's a high enough national priority that we can't have free elections anymore, and that that might go back quite some time.

57:05.973 --> 57:09.374
If you actually believe that, then please take

57:10.205 --> 57:16.027
that assumption to its logical conclusion and try to work out why this is right then.

57:16.807 --> 57:19.048
That it's just plain in front of you.

57:19.708 --> 57:31.012
Robert Malone, Meryl Nash, CHD, Andrew Wakefield, Pauly Tommy, Mary Holland, Robert Malone, Sasha Latupova, Alex Jones.

57:32.553 --> 57:37.755
They're all one national security scripted acting show.

57:39.932 --> 57:40.913
Tucker Carlson.

57:45.377 --> 57:45.717
You know?

57:46.758 --> 57:47.698
Frickin' Massey.

57:48.839 --> 57:51.582
Performing with all these Indian representatives.

57:51.622 --> 57:54.204
This is all part of the theater.

57:55.745 --> 57:58.828
And it is a theater in which other countries participate.

57:59.028 --> 58:00.029
Absolutely it is.

58:01.970 --> 58:05.913
But it is a theater where Americans lose because we are the audience.

58:05.953 --> 58:08.936
We have no, no control.

58:10.908 --> 58:20.092
The only way we will ever have control is if we storm the stage, get off of social media, leave the theater, and actually start building things for ourselves.

58:20.352 --> 58:26.294
Actually start sharing videos by sending them, by hosting your own website.

58:27.755 --> 58:29.376
MySpace actually wasn't that bad.

58:30.996 --> 58:34.518
Twitter was intentionally deployed during Arab Spring.

58:36.519 --> 58:38.059
Twitter is a weapon.

58:38.599 --> 58:39.620
It is not a business.

58:40.981 --> 58:56.458
Facebook it is a weapon that again, you can see it's we trained it We are now allowing our children to fall in a trap that we helped optimize Holy shit Used as a weapon

58:58.061 --> 59:00.002
It has intrinsic capability.

59:00.282 --> 59:08.327
But the thing about it is, is when he says it this angry and he pretends that it didn't help him, that's the fifth generation warfare.

59:08.647 --> 59:23.136
When he pretends that it didn't help Jessica Rose, when he pretends that it didn't help keep Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey and Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson on the top of your feed, then you see what fifth generation warfare is.

59:24.912 --> 59:31.541
When you think to yourself, I've been shadow banned, okay?

59:32.342 --> 59:34.284
That language is kind of irrelevant.

59:35.666 --> 59:36.828
You're personalizing it.

59:38.100 --> 59:55.191
These tools are used to shape the information landscape, the cloud of information, your contacts, who's talking to who, what they're allowed to say, how they're allowed to say it, with specific intentions to shape the direction of thought and emotion.

59:57.152 --> 01:00:04.237
There are tools embedded within that in the analytics that extract emotional content out of every single thing you tweet.

01:00:05.532 --> 01:00:17.302
and derive from that understandings of what your emotional, personal emotional landscape is, and allows that to be manipulated by what you are then exposed to, what your eyes see.

01:00:18.103 --> 01:00:32.374
And the idea is, of course, that they're selecting from all the random content on the internet and choosing the stuff that gets them the farthest, you know, with screwing with you or something, or keeps you engaged in their platform.

01:00:33.115 --> 01:00:34.376
It's real conniving.

01:00:34.996 --> 01:00:50.665
It could never be that the national security state or something like NATO or whatever global pile of money is doing it would put people on the internet in a coordinated fashion to govern people with scripted actors.

01:00:51.286 --> 01:00:52.386
But that's what they did.

01:00:52.446 --> 01:00:54.087
That's who Geert van den Bolsch is.

01:00:54.207 --> 01:00:56.589
That's who Matthias Desmet is.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.791
That's who that Dowd guy is.

01:00:59.832 --> 01:01:01.575
That's who Nick Hudson is.

01:01:01.635 --> 01:01:02.818
That's who Claire Craig is.

01:01:02.878 --> 01:01:06.085
That's who Kevin McKernan is, but it's also the clowns.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:08.791
Like Richard Fleming.

01:01:10.618 --> 01:01:21.563
and and kevin mccairn and charles ricksey and and george webb the shithead and And his his his uh, I don't know hero of the pandemic paul cutrell.

01:01:21.983 --> 01:01:34.509
These are all people that were auditioning And yes, if they caught on in social media, they would be farther And they would have gotten amplified even more than they have already

01:01:35.336 --> 01:01:43.322
But the ones that were already fine-tuned, already well-trained, or passed the early auditions, those people rose quick and fast.

01:01:44.103 --> 01:01:48.406
And they have book deals, and they have thousands of subscribers on Substack.

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:52.650
And that is fifth-generation warfare.

01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:58.935
Now, one thing to realize is that I'm not suggesting that they're all D.O.D.

01:01:58.975 --> 01:01:59.875
because the D.O.D.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:05.640
could have also outsourced this to some form of a Palantir third-party kind of thing.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.305
So they could work for Teal, they could work for Musk, and they could be contracted to the U.S.

01:02:11.345 --> 01:02:11.725
government.

01:02:11.745 --> 01:02:13.567
They could be contracted to the D.O.D.

01:02:13.607 --> 01:02:15.588
I don't know how this works.

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:23.495
I just know for sure that this is an elaborate joke on the very audience he's speaking to.

01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:27.409
And that's what fifth generation warfare is.

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:29.150
It's people lying to your face.

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:33.913
Okay, these are weapons.

01:02:35.435 --> 01:02:36.155
Understand that.

01:02:37.396 --> 01:02:47.484
Sasha Latupova, Alex Jones, potentially her daughter, you know, Laura Loomer, CHD.

01:02:47.824 --> 01:02:49.845
These are weapons, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:50.146 --> 01:02:51.186
ICANN is a weapon.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.068
Brownstone is a weapon.

01:02:55.234 --> 01:03:00.996
And the Dark Horse podcast is a weapon, even if they don't understand, because they're dumb as a hammer.

01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:16.002
In the case of Arab Spring, it was almost fifth generation warfare, except it lacked a couple of the key elements.

01:03:16.142 --> 01:03:18.443
We actually knew who the antagonists were.

01:03:20.684 --> 01:03:24.646
In true fifth generation warfare, you do not know who your opponent is.

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:35.650
Example, who is responsible for, who's the puppet master behind the COVID crisis as we've experienced it?

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:36.071
Who is it?

01:03:37.486 --> 01:03:52.658
Right now it's the human genome project and all of their wings in different parts of the country of the of the world that's why Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Robert Malone and and and Meryl Nass and CHD they're all recruited on purpose.

01:03:52.698 --> 01:04:03.967
They're all part of it, but at the heart of it is Claire Craig and Kevin McKernan Robert Malone Mike Eden all the people on that original paper and

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:09.978
And most likely they added Thomas Binder because Thomas Binder needed controlling.

01:04:10.578 --> 01:04:16.961
But Mike Eden is on their team 100% because he's only been promoting Sasha Latupova for the last year and a half.

01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:21.563
You know, the one that was on stage just before Asim Malhotra saying it's the DoD.

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:26.827
They're so imprecise, they made admissions.

01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:37.070
They hoped that this video would never show up again, but the entire conference from January 2023 is one gigantic joke now if you watch it.

01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:46.152
We are under attack, ladies and gentlemen, and we can still free ourselves from this if we really want to.

01:04:46.272 --> 01:04:47.853
More importantly, we can free our kids.

01:04:48.453 --> 01:04:49.073
Anybody here know?

01:04:49.913 --> 01:04:50.614
Was it Klaus?

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:51.094
No.

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:53.278
There's something above Klaus.

01:04:54.295 --> 01:04:55.075
Was it Biden?

01:04:56.295 --> 01:04:57.576
Was it Tony Fauci?

01:04:58.116 --> 01:05:00.156
These are all surrogates, okay?

01:05:00.616 --> 01:05:06.458
You don't really know who is managing the message that has been propagated on you.

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:09.498
So how useful is he really then?

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:13.019
He knows all about it, but he doesn't know who's doing it.

01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:17.880
He participated in its deployment during the Arab Spring, but he doesn't know who's doing it now.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.681
Or he purports to be the one guy who can tell you who's doing it, but he hasn't said it yet.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.261
That's fifth generation warfare.

01:05:30.783 --> 01:05:48.656
Over the last three years, Western governments, non-governmental organizations, transnational organizations, pharmaceutical industry corporations, media and financial corporations have cooperated via public-private partnerships, which I assert is a euphemism for fascism.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:58.302
Private-public partnerships could also be, for example, the security firm of Gavin DeBecker covering Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:58.402 --> 01:06:00.744
during his tenure at CHD.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:13.255
When you heard Brett Weinstein say that it wasn't cool, that the administration wasn't giving security to Donald Trump or to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that was kind of bullshit because he's always had

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:19.982
the finest of private security provided for him by Gavin De Becker and Associates, I guess his best friend from childhood.

01:06:20.482 --> 01:06:34.937
He has been treated to presidential candidate level security by highly trained military professionals since he took over or started CHD, changed the name of the World Mercury Project.

01:06:36.471 --> 01:06:38.253
It's all one elaborate hoax.

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:47.140
It's a national security theater that hides how we are being governed by an elaborate hoax on social media.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:51.263
And COVID was a huge part of the transition to this.

01:06:56.047 --> 01:07:01.952
To deploy the most massive globally harmonized psychological and propaganda operation in the history of the world.

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:04.452
But he's not a part of it.

01:07:05.153 --> 01:07:06.694
Bret Weinstein's not a part of it.

01:07:07.095 --> 01:07:13.320
You know, the mother of Soph and her daughter Soph, who was on Alex Jones, is not a part of it.

01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:15.222
Alex Jones is fighting against it.

01:07:16.383 --> 01:07:19.386
He's been fighting against it since he went to the Bohemian Grove.

01:07:20.227 --> 01:07:20.888
Stop lying!

01:07:23.966 --> 01:07:35.314
Over the last three years, you have been subjected to the most massive, harmonized, globally coordinated propaganda campaign in the history of the Western world, full stop.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:36.935
But he's not involved in it.

01:07:36.975 --> 01:07:38.276
He has nothing to do with it.

01:07:38.336 --> 01:07:39.837
He's fighting against it.

01:07:40.537 --> 01:07:49.643
It's the biggest, most invisible, destructive force ever unleashed on our own societies, by ourselves, ever.

01:07:50.224 --> 01:07:53.506
And he's giving you a TED Talk, but you're never going to really know who did it.

01:07:59.349 --> 01:08:01.390
And like a bunch of seals, they clapped.

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.692
That's how effective the anger is.

01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:08.553
The anger is part of the neurolinguistic programming.

01:08:08.873 --> 01:08:11.915
He's pissed because he saw it just like you.

01:08:11.935 --> 01:08:19.678
My mouth is getting dry talking about these things.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.820
His mouth is getting dry because he's lying.

01:08:23.737 --> 01:08:30.021
And he's nervous because this is one of the first times that he's actually gone to the next step.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:35.624
Before this, it was MR and AMR and AMR and A and stuff.

01:08:37.365 --> 01:08:38.465
I do feel a little passionate.

01:08:40.205 --> 01:08:56.610
With this campaign, the governments of many Western nation states have turned, okay, this is key, military grade psychological operations, strategies, tactics, technologies, and capabilities developed for modern military combat against their own citizens.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:58.731
He's showing you that his book is part of it.

01:09:00.271 --> 01:09:04.452
The truth is right there on your fricking screen and he's showing them.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:06.933
He's just not saying it.

01:09:08.945 --> 01:09:14.329
And by not saying it, the implication for everybody in the room is that this is a good guy, not part of it.

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:26.298
Just like Robert Malone and, and, and Meryl Nass and, and Jessica Rose and Pierre Corey were touring the world for the COVID summits because they were fighting against this Goliath.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.302
These are inconvenient facts.

01:09:32.503 --> 01:09:38.007
The world that many of us believed existed no longer exists if it ever did.

01:09:40.049 --> 01:09:43.531
For me, that's a statement of I want it to be.

01:09:43.771 --> 01:09:44.872
That's an announcement.

01:09:46.773 --> 01:09:50.295
The world that you thought exists doesn't exist and maybe it never did.

01:09:50.976 --> 01:09:52.957
That's an enchantment.

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:55.899
That's fifth generation warfare.

01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:57.580
That's neuro-linguistic programming.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:08.247
And think about how deep you are if you believe he's a good guy who came all the way from America and left his horse farm and all of his baby emus alone with some caretakers so that he could bring us the truth in person.

01:10:09.682 --> 01:10:27.327
The stunning bookend is this recent revelation on Tucker Carlson that the first thing that I remember as a young person born in 1959, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, was probably propagated in significant part by the United States intelligence community.

01:10:27.347 --> 01:10:28.907
Okay?

01:10:29.128 --> 01:10:37.430
And we have been- So a guy in 2020 who didn't know about WEF is now pretty convinced that the United States government actually killed JFK and RFK.

01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:39.560
Interesting.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:40.720
Hmm.

01:10:42.802 --> 01:10:43.022
Hmm.

01:10:44.363 --> 01:10:45.564
I think that's a little off.

01:10:45.644 --> 01:11:02.078
I think, I think whoever killed JFK and RFK already controlled the country when they were elected and saw no other solution to uncontrollable president and, and, and brother than to kill them.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.583
Probably the same people who killed Senator Kefauver, who they couldn't control.

01:11:13.772 --> 01:11:17.074
lied about that my whole life.

01:11:19.696 --> 01:11:21.477
Welcome to Fifth Generation Warfare.

01:11:21.497 --> 01:11:23.118
The battlefield is your mind.

01:11:23.459 --> 01:11:27.842
See, so now he's saying that, you know, the battlefield's been your mind ever since JFK.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:33.866
How about Fifth Generation Warfare is using the mythology of JFK to mess with us?

01:11:35.307 --> 01:11:42.652
To pretend that some truth is gonna come out, that maybe some, the son of RFK is gonna come to our rescue on a white horse.

01:11:44.414 --> 01:11:47.435
This is 2023, ladies and gentlemen, he hasn't announced yet.

01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:53.076
There are weapons.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.138
This has been anticipated.

01:11:58.218 --> 01:12:05.320
We've had a... Yes, the anticipated rise in all cause mortality is what this was scheduled around.

01:12:06.482 --> 01:12:14.944
the rise in all-cause mortality that suddenly Kevin McKernan is acknowledging with his extremely well-trimmed goatee of a beard.

01:12:15.824 --> 01:12:20.306
And maybe they wanted to protect, they didn't want to pay out Social Security, so they killed some old people.

01:12:23.046 --> 01:12:24.627
We are winning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:24.667 --> 01:12:26.447
They are scrambling for the exits.

01:12:26.507 --> 01:12:27.988
They really want to stop.

01:12:28.588 --> 01:12:30.448
They really want to get off stage.

01:12:30.548 --> 01:12:33.409
And as long as we exist, they will never be able to stop.

01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:40.489
This is who Robert Malone and Sasha Latupova and Kevin McKernan will have to be for the rest of their lives.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.751
This is who Mary Holland and Pauly Tommy are gonna be for the rest of their lives.

01:12:45.831 --> 01:12:51.893
Brian Hooker is going to live as a public fraud for the rest of his life.

01:12:51.933 --> 01:12:55.755
And it's only gonna get worse as my notoriety rises.

01:12:57.210 --> 01:13:03.719
Series of writings, and I hesitate to include our own book at the end.

01:13:03.739 --> 01:13:11.529
I in no way imply that it is of equal to 1984 and Brave New World or the work of Hannah Arendt.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:14.874
It's a continuation in that theme is my point.

01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:34.451
Before fourth and fifth generation warfare, modern warfare between states was a duel on larger scale, a continuation of politics by other means with core elements of rationality of the state, probability in military command, and rage of the population, Klauswitz.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.914
The only thing that remains there is the rage of the population.

01:13:41.575 --> 01:13:43.117
Rational state actors,

01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:48.359
We're in an environment in which the nation state is treated as an obsolete entity.

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:54.464
We have a new vague cloud of globalist leadership that we can't even put our fingers on.

01:13:55.044 --> 01:14:07.335
What a weird statement to make from a guy who in 2020, three years earlier, didn't know who the WEF was, according to Merrill Nass and Mary Holland, when they visited him at his farm to vet him for, for CHD.

01:14:10.778 --> 01:14:12.439
These people are just scripted liars.

01:14:13.339 --> 01:14:14.680
And they've lied a lot to me.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:25.285
That's the reason why I'm so passionate about it, because they've tried to absorb me and to trick me with so many different groups of shitheads.

01:14:25.705 --> 01:14:26.745
It's pretty remarkable.

01:14:28.186 --> 01:14:35.649
And I feel some obligation to make sure that my kids and my kids' generation understand that that's what happened during the Trump administration.

01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:37.030
That's what happened during COVID.

01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:43.614
It will be the reason why they are wherever they are in the next five years.

01:14:43.694 --> 01:14:47.157
And whatever happens happens will be facilitated by this theater.

01:14:47.277 --> 01:14:54.963
And it will be a continuous operation with this theater because this guy is at the FDA.

01:14:55.643 --> 01:14:58.485
Those shithead podcasters were at the FDA.

01:14:58.986 --> 01:15:02.889
That scripted actor named Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:02.929 --> 01:15:03.669
is at the head of HHS.

01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:10.735
We don't really know who's driving it.

01:15:11.936 --> 01:15:22.645
Probability in military command, we have an environment in which the military command is confused, it's diffuse, and the battleground is constantly shifting.

01:15:23.846 --> 01:15:27.849
And today, the very nature of fifth generation warfare is that it's difficult to define.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.243
As Clark says, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

01:15:33.643 --> 01:15:42.149
See, that's what they want you to believe, that it's AI, that it's so hard to tell that we're never going to be able to figure it out.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:43.590
But what if it wasn't?

01:15:44.631 --> 01:15:52.837
What if it was really simple, that everybody in this conference was put there on purpose, they are scripted, and they are actors?

01:15:54.554 --> 01:15:56.716
And now he's telling you that it's the algorithm.

01:15:56.756 --> 01:15:57.757
It's the programming.

01:15:57.817 --> 01:16:02.180
It's the, it's the emotionality and the selection of emotional things.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.422
And then they, they use them all against you.

01:16:04.722 --> 01:16:11.708
It couldn't possibly be scripted people traveling around the world, lying to you in person.

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:20.055
It couldn't possibly be people traveling the world, scripted actors.

01:16:21.596 --> 01:16:22.937
It couldn't possibly be that.

01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:27.973
And that is the fifth gen warfare battlefield.

01:16:28.434 --> 01:16:29.895
Now here's the flow of the talk.

01:16:30.755 --> 01:16:37.521
The thesis is that Western nations have globally deployed military grade PSYOPs on their citizens during the COVID crisis.

01:16:37.561 --> 01:16:42.524
And my intention is to convince you of that and to help you to comprehend the inner meaning of that.

01:16:43.245 --> 01:16:46.668
And then to help you to see how that can be turned to your advantage.

01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:48.989
We're gonna have evidence.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:58.488
A definition of common terms, this is such a bizarre psychological landscape that it's difficult to even process.

01:16:59.653 --> 01:17:06.556
We have to have language, we have to have common language and understanding to even be able to comprehend what's been done to us.

01:17:07.237 --> 01:17:12.319
What you need to hear there is that without common language, you can't understand.

01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:23.004
And then his job is to make sure that you don't have common language between you and your fellow citizen, between you and the other side of the narrative, between you and people that doubt him.

01:17:23.464 --> 01:17:28.587
So he's telling you the truth, sorta, kinda, but he doesn't tell you what he's gonna do about it.

01:17:29.261 --> 01:17:32.322
because that's all part of the neuro-linguistic programming show.

01:17:34.743 --> 01:17:38.084
What is meant by military-grade PSYOPs or fifth-generation warfare?

01:17:38.104 --> 01:17:40.085
I'm going to give you a video example from the U.S.

01:17:40.165 --> 01:17:45.207
military PSYOPs so that you have a comprehension of what is being deployed globally.

01:17:47.523 --> 01:17:51.644
What are fifth-generation warfare strategies and tactics that are relevant to the COVID crisis?

01:17:52.104 --> 01:17:57.826
This, like the, somebody made a joke about our book, The Lies My Government Told Me, is nowhere near long enough.

01:17:57.886 --> 01:17:59.886
It needs to be the size of an encyclopedia.

01:18:01.266 --> 01:18:05.568
Likewise, strategies and tactics for fifth-gen warfare, I'm just gonna give you some examples.

01:18:07.348 --> 01:18:14.990
Observations regarding organization and leadership in this new battleground and choosing between being a victim and a warrior.

01:18:16.588 --> 01:18:18.250
We do not have to be victims.

01:18:20.011 --> 01:18:22.513
What are these gradients or generations of warfare?

01:18:22.874 --> 01:18:25.316
The concept of generation is really not accurate.

01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:26.937
This is a blend of gradients.

01:18:27.498 --> 01:18:34.224
In first generation warfare, we have the ancient battles of Europe, historically, bows and arrows and swords.

01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:36.426
That was made obsolete by muskets.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.689
Then we had organized battle, battle lines.

01:18:41.169 --> 01:19:06.476
Remember that this is supposed to be a multi-year DOD guy who also worked for DITRA at the beginning of the pandemic screening all of the known nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog using AI and a combination of or sorry a combination of AI and computer-aided virtual crystallography of the interesting proteins of the virus.

01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:12.381
and identified four drugs that could be repurposed to fight COVID.

01:19:12.401 --> 01:19:24.250
That guy in 2023 at the end of the murder in America is now telling everybody about the fifth generation warfare that they decided to deploy on us because it was a global crisis.

01:19:25.972 --> 01:19:26.472
Warfare.

01:19:28.133 --> 01:19:31.776
That is a mixture of kinetic and psyops.

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:36.737
of information warfare and kinetic warfare.

01:19:36.957 --> 01:19:41.440
And it is still fighting over territory, control of territory in fourth gen.

01:19:42.581 --> 01:19:44.082
The internet has changed everything.

01:19:45.123 --> 01:19:51.928
The internet and more importantly, social media and the perceived relevance of it have changed everything.

01:19:52.468 --> 01:19:59.754
The entire narrative in COVID supposedly occurred and developed and evolved on social media.

01:20:00.234 --> 01:20:06.437
And everybody agrees that it was Twitter, and it was X, and it was Elon Musk, and it was Substack.

01:20:06.517 --> 01:20:11.440
And even the PBS NewsHour plugs people's Substacks now.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.021
That's not by accident.

01:20:13.421 --> 01:20:26.908
That's because these new social medias are exactly the same as the old, only more advanced, with more features and more machine learning algorithms that are designed to extract useful information from the shit that you put there.

01:20:27.409 --> 01:20:27.829
That's it!

01:20:31.158 --> 01:20:47.771
But the main trick is still the deployment of people like Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, the recruitment of people like Brian Hooker, where you know you convince them to build a big top tent of health freedom thinking that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:47.811 --> 01:20:49.993
will probably maybe get a chance to be president.

01:20:50.393 --> 01:20:57.539
And so it's better to get to that goal than to save any American kids from a ridiculous vaccine schedule.

01:21:04.002 --> 01:21:04.642
as we all know.

01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:12.224
Now we're in a battle space where the battleground is literally your mind.

01:21:12.244 --> 01:21:13.664
It is what you think.

01:21:13.784 --> 01:21:14.864
It is what you feel.

01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:17.024
It is what motivates you.

01:21:17.725 --> 01:21:22.365
That can all be manipulated and is manipulated on a daily basis.

01:21:22.605 --> 01:21:25.106
You experience it, of course, historically.

01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:27.386
And I'm not playing that game anymore.

01:21:27.406 --> 01:21:29.287
I don't want to play that game anymore.

01:21:29.307 --> 01:21:30.367
I want you to see

01:21:31.127 --> 01:21:37.231
that there are facts and there are levels of understanding that preclude participating in any of that bullshit.

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:57.605
Number one, if you believe that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are on the same team as I do, then you must take that to the logical conclusion that there's never been a meaningful election in the last, probably 12 years at least, if not many more decades where they have been manipulated to the point of being controlled.

01:21:59.363 --> 01:22:04.505
There probably have been some candidates that have not been under their direct control, but they did not win.

01:22:05.285 --> 01:22:18.871
And as we've moved into the era of social media, where the internet has changed everything, you know, that thing that Al Gore invented, we are at a stage now where they are insisting that the internet has already done this.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:23.253
The internet has already made the nation state irrelevant.

01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:27.715
And that is part of the fifth generation warfare enchantment.

01:22:28.612 --> 01:22:32.055
They don't want you to think that you should have any control anymore.

01:22:32.095 --> 01:22:36.900
You don't want you to think that your participation in your own system is worthwhile anymore.

01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:41.885
You might as well just tweet and post on Facebook and hope it goes viral.

01:22:43.168 --> 01:22:46.449
because the internet is actually more important than voting.

01:22:46.809 --> 01:22:48.669
It's more important than running for office.

01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:52.990
It's more important than being a county commissioner or the county sheriff.

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:56.551
It's much more important that you participate in social media.

01:22:57.071 --> 01:23:09.033
Even though 10 minutes ago, he told you that that was the military weapon and that the only way of surviving was to not participate.

01:23:10.754 --> 01:23:11.494
Can you hear it?

01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:20.341
It's so contradictory that the only thing you could really call it is fifth generation warfare right there in front of you.

01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:27.366
We, through what we call in the States, Madison Avenue advertising technology, a scene was talking about processed foods.

01:23:28.366 --> 01:23:32.089
This is taking the psychological basis

01:23:32.987 --> 01:23:39.893
for advertising and manipulation of behavior and thought and weaponizing it against all of us.

01:23:40.173 --> 01:23:42.816
And if you were to be honest, what would he be most talking about?

01:23:42.836 --> 01:23:54.106
The weaponization of podcasts like Joe Rogan and putting the ideas and the questions and the wow moments that they want.

01:23:57.335 --> 01:24:14.225
And once you realize that all of these people central to the narrative were touring podcast after podcast after podcast in 2020 and 2021, repeating themselves over and over and over again, it's very specifically because that is fifth generation warfare.

01:24:15.266 --> 01:24:19.609
It is deployed on a need to know basis, scripted actors.

01:24:21.693 --> 01:24:32.476
and it is Mary Holland, and it is Paul Offit, and it is Rasmussen and Vincent Racaniello, and they don't all have to understand the role they're playing.

01:24:32.496 --> 01:24:36.197
They can all ideally believe that they are doing the right thing.

01:24:39.198 --> 01:24:40.519
Then this works the best.

01:24:42.859 --> 01:24:47.561
In an industrial way, using this amazing information distribution platform.

01:24:48.663 --> 01:24:50.184
What's gonna displace this?

01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:50.724
Who knows?

01:24:51.185 --> 01:24:52.406
But right now, that's what we're in.

01:24:53.226 --> 01:24:54.887
The composition of warfare is changing.

01:24:54.907 --> 01:24:57.289
The traditional methods of waging war are evolving.

01:24:58.050 --> 01:24:59.931
Conventional techniques are in decline.

01:25:00.111 --> 01:25:03.253
Opportunities to use kinetic weapons have become highly restricted.

01:25:03.293 --> 01:25:04.614
This is why this has to happen.

01:25:05.255 --> 01:25:12.720
We're seeing it in Ukraine, but for the rest of the world, people are not at liberty to go ahead and engage in armed warfare in the traditional way.

01:25:13.121 --> 01:25:14.902
They can't do wet work anymore.

01:25:15.939 --> 01:25:21.883
It's really hard to kill people like they killed Brandy Vaughn and like they killed, like they killed Tony Bark.

01:25:24.165 --> 01:25:31.029
It might be the only reason why I survived my little throat injury and whatever's going on now is because I'm lucky.

01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.570
I don't know.

01:25:33.271 --> 01:25:35.472
But they can't do wet work anymore.

01:25:35.733 --> 01:25:38.274
Not like they used to be able to because of social media.

01:25:39.055 --> 01:25:44.959
Because of the potential that my kid might videotape it or there might be a USB camera they're not aware of.

01:25:48.069 --> 01:25:50.151
That's the transition that we've made.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:57.377
Is that my neighbor could have a camera that films the car that stops in front of my house for five minutes in the middle of the night.

01:26:00.299 --> 01:26:10.768
And so we have transferred and passed already into this next stage of things where we might force their hand and the only thing they can do is unplug the internet.

01:26:10.788 --> 01:26:12.890
And when it comes back on, everybody needs an ID.

01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:18.723
in order to use the social media platforms you think of as free.

01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:33.772
And that's where PeerTube and Soapbox and my maintenance of my own website, my own servers, my own copies of my videos that allow you to download them and put them wherever you want to, including just an audio file.

01:26:34.252 --> 01:26:36.714
That's where they're in trouble.

01:26:38.612 --> 01:26:53.699
because none of these people are advocating for a federated free internet where everybody is minding their own store and we all promote the people that we trust that have built up a track record of integrity and the rest of this be damned.

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.161
He's promoting

01:26:58.189 --> 01:27:02.850
social media as the thing that you can only survive by not participating in.

01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:05.071
And then he's telling you about how it was rolled out.

01:27:05.651 --> 01:27:18.274
And he's telling you that he can save you from it, even though he is a integral, if not one of the most important parts of the international COVID narrative, him and Kevin McKernan for all countries in the world.

01:27:20.774 --> 01:27:21.995
I don't care where you live.

01:27:22.035 --> 01:27:26.836
Those two Americans should be at the top of your list of traitors against your kids.

01:27:28.271 --> 01:27:38.496
they've had to seek newer tactics and tools such as information warfare, asymmetric warfare, media propaganda warfare, hybrid warfare, that's the new environment we're in.

01:27:39.216 --> 01:27:46.900
And the traditional clear divisions between combatant and non-combatant and between wartime and peacetime have become gradients.

01:27:48.281 --> 01:27:54.164
We are all... There is no peacetime, there is no wartime, everything is controlled.

01:27:54.994 --> 01:27:56.675
The internet is the weapon.

01:27:56.715 --> 01:28:09.144
He's saying it, but then he doesn't follow it to the logical conclusion that nobody that rises to clear view is there by chance, that virality on the internet is an illusion.

01:28:09.184 --> 01:28:13.407
He's not going to the logical conclusion of the thing he said 10 minutes ago.

01:28:13.887 --> 01:28:16.689
And that's how you can see that he is a scripted actor.

01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:22.914
Both combatants and non-combatants.

01:28:24.497 --> 01:28:28.663
Everything, the entire landscape has become a battleground.

01:28:29.263 --> 01:28:31.026
All nation states, everything.

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:40.952
When seeking to understand what this means, you're forced to enter this bizarre, shifting, surreal psychological terrain.

01:28:41.752 --> 01:28:53.575
To understand it, you must temporarily suspend and restructure what you thought you knew about truth, ethics, media, information, social organization, business, government, and the military.

01:28:54.876 --> 01:28:59.017
In this total warfare landscape, there are no ethics.

01:29:00.131 --> 01:29:06.793
When a seam talks about there are no ethics that includes people traveling the world to lie to your face.

01:29:07.953 --> 01:29:13.715
And if that's all it took, then for sure they would do it because it's for all the marbles.

01:29:13.855 --> 01:29:26.979
It's for the grandchildren of earth and whether or not they can successfully inherit a mythology of bullshit that will allow them to effectively be converted to experimental animals as a generation.

01:29:28.564 --> 01:29:31.645
There are no morals, and he's telling you that right now.

01:29:32.205 --> 01:29:33.606
Have you ever watched a movie?

01:29:33.986 --> 01:29:37.627
When characters say that, they're usually the asshole, remember?

01:29:39.488 --> 01:29:44.009
What we've been subjected to, all of us have been subjected to, Ryan Cole has been subjected to.

01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:48.591
Ryan Cole was there, holy shit.

01:29:49.211 --> 01:29:50.471
I did not know that.

01:29:50.571 --> 01:29:54.993
So Ryan Cole, Sasha Latupova, Meryl Ness,

01:29:57.378 --> 01:30:02.842
Asim Malhotra and Robert Malone, and they're all in the same room here.

01:30:03.743 --> 01:30:04.704
Holy shit.

01:30:06.925 --> 01:30:07.886
There are no ethics.

01:30:07.926 --> 01:30:10.648
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

01:30:11.969 --> 01:30:17.674
They will launder money with fake followers on Substack.

01:30:17.734 --> 01:30:21.276
They will launder money by selling fake books on Amazon.

01:30:22.077 --> 01:30:23.258
There's no ethics here.

01:30:24.764 --> 01:30:29.169
all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:41.484
They will start CHD and ICANN and make videos and promote Polly, Tommy and Andrew Wakefield for literally a decade because there's no ethics.

01:30:41.985 --> 01:30:43.727
This is for all the marbles.

01:30:47.995 --> 01:30:52.261
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:57.889
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

01:30:59.812 --> 01:31:03.897
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

01:31:05.342 --> 01:31:06.002
And what is it?

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:10.223
Where there are no guardrails, it means that people will just lie to your face.

01:31:10.764 --> 01:31:12.444
That's the worst case scenario.

01:31:12.484 --> 01:31:14.405
The worst case scenario is not nukes.

01:31:15.145 --> 01:31:18.526
The worst case scenario is not deployment of gain of function viruses.

01:31:20.126 --> 01:31:23.867
The worst case scenario is not algorithms programmed really mean.

01:31:25.008 --> 01:31:29.009
The worst case scenario is not Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.

01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:39.732
The worst case scenario is people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel flooding the internet with employees.

01:31:46.974 --> 01:31:51.435
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement, but that's what we're in right now.

01:31:52.255 --> 01:31:54.736
You have to completely park any idea.

01:31:55.236 --> 01:31:56.637
You mean where you can have Mr. Beast?

01:31:58.988 --> 01:32:08.355
connected to pedophilia, running a multi-million dollar operation where people from his hometown pretend like they win big games?

01:32:10.237 --> 01:32:13.579
And it's okay that he's also selling candy to kids?

01:32:17.562 --> 01:32:27.150
In a place where Sasha Latupova's daughter can make underage content before the pandemic, get promoted by Alex Jones,

01:32:28.137 --> 01:32:33.678
And then Sasha Latupova can be used by these clowns and nobody makes that connection at all?

01:32:36.539 --> 01:32:42.660
These people have been training and auditioning and fine-tuning their schticks for years now.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:49.161
And many of them started before the pandemic because they were scripted actors before the pandemic.

01:32:50.442 --> 01:32:56.883
Knowing, or their handlers knowing, that their role in the pandemic would be

01:32:58.175 --> 01:32:59.116
absolutely vital.

01:33:00.376 --> 01:33:03.839
The idea of justice right and wrong.

01:33:04.239 --> 01:33:07.541
I mean they work for the same people that Peter Daszak works for.

01:33:08.001 --> 01:33:18.268
They work for the same people that Fauci works for, the same people that Hotez works for, the same people that Topol works for, the same people that Rack and Yellow work for.

01:33:18.668 --> 01:33:20.109
It's all the same

01:33:21.297 --> 01:33:42.987
group of piles of weaponized piles of money it's not it's not some are big pharma and some are the dod and some are the brownstone institute and some is the chd boy chd is really punching above their weight no all that is obsolete in this battlefield environment as you step into this hellscape

01:33:44.181 --> 01:33:47.142
set aside obsolete notions of fairness and rules.

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.482
This is total.

01:33:48.762 --> 01:33:53.063
It is totally an enchantment set aside fairness and rules.

01:33:53.163 --> 01:34:09.387
Don't think that if you tweet the right thing that it's going to rise because people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Assi Mahaltra are being programmed to rise, being put in front of thousands of people with a script they already signed at the line and accepted a long time ago.

01:34:12.054 --> 01:34:16.076
unrestricted information warfare, and you've been subjected to it for the last three years.

01:34:18.857 --> 01:34:26.661
20th century organizational norms and social activism methods based on centralized leadership have become outdated and obsolete.

01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:27.541
Get rid of them.

01:34:30.002 --> 01:34:30.903
That's how we lose.

01:34:33.479 --> 01:34:44.083
We are in a war of information and perception, which targets your cognitive biases, the cognitive biases of individuals and organizations.

01:34:44.483 --> 01:34:52.125
But his posing as a homesteading, you know, most interesting man in the world, that's not fifth generation warfare.

01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:54.486
Mickey Willis, no, he's real.

01:34:55.026 --> 01:34:57.167
But there is fifth generation warfare.

01:34:57.187 --> 01:35:00.228
He's gonna get around to telling you which ones it is in a minute.

01:35:00.768 --> 01:35:01.809
That is the target.

01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:14.958
to transform those cognitive biases in ways that are in the interest of the opponent, who in ideal fifth-generation warfare, you never even know who they are.

01:35:16.959 --> 01:35:27.205
And ideal fifth-generation warfare, where you never even know who your opponent is, includes CHD, ICANN, Vaxxed, Polytomy, Andrew Wakefield,

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:33.970
RFK Jr., Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, Robert Malone, Brian Hooker.

01:35:34.691 --> 01:35:35.351
That's the truth.

01:35:36.672 --> 01:35:45.519
Once you understand that, once you see how malevolently we have been played, then you can put the Biden administration in perfect context.

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:48.701
You can put the Obama administration in perfect context.

01:35:48.741 --> 01:35:50.903
We've been played for a long time, ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:52.584 --> 01:35:57.308
And it's been one continuous joke on the most conservative and Christian Americans.

01:35:59.275 --> 01:36:03.261
Because we are the problematic Americans.

01:36:05.886 --> 01:36:13.318
To create new cognitive biases and propagate it out into the population without their being aware that it's being done to them.

01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:18.382
This is completely different from classical warfare.

01:36:18.782 --> 01:36:22.003
It focuses on the individual observer and decision makers.

01:36:22.523 --> 01:36:25.304
It's difficult or impossible to attribute.

01:36:26.084 --> 01:36:32.666
It is truly leaderless and decentralized, which makes it incredibly powerful because no one can be taken out.

01:36:35.367 --> 01:36:37.468
The nature of the attack is completely concealed.

01:36:37.508 --> 01:36:38.688
You never see it coming.

01:36:42.264 --> 01:36:43.304
What are the characteristics?

01:36:43.505 --> 01:36:45.005
Ambiguity of the opposing force.

01:36:45.045 --> 01:36:45.565
I've said this.

01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:47.266
Ambiguity of the attack vector.

01:36:47.286 --> 01:36:49.867
You don't know what's being done to you and how it's being done.

01:36:50.107 --> 01:36:50.928
Dopamine loops.

01:36:51.008 --> 01:36:53.109
These are the hits that you get on social media.

01:36:53.509 --> 01:36:54.289
Click, click, click.

01:36:54.409 --> 01:36:55.270
Oh, they like that.

01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:56.490
Oh, they didn't like that.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.991
Oh, look how popular I am.

01:36:58.411 --> 01:36:59.171
Dopamine loops.

01:37:00.172 --> 01:37:02.453
And they wouldn't be scripted actors doing it.

01:37:02.613 --> 01:37:07.515
It wouldn't be like Brent Weinstein in a signal chat for a year telling you that, oh, wow, you make a lot of sense.

01:37:08.194 --> 01:37:12.276
No, it's just the algorithms and the clicky clickies.

01:37:14.236 --> 01:37:27.061
Triggering existing cognitive biases and the targets by choosing words that trigger you in a positive and negative way is how you are manipulated and influenced, how your thinking is shaped.

01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:36.865
So it would be really important not to say the word transfection if in fact these were old transfection technologies being renamed to reset the IP clock.

01:37:37.225 --> 01:37:50.617
It would be really important not to talk very precisely about the ridiculousness of intramuscular injection versus ingestion or even subcutaneous injection relative to the immune system and how it's organized and functioned.

01:37:50.937 --> 01:37:52.419
That would be all crazy talk.

01:37:56.178 --> 01:37:57.539
I mentioned Arab Spring before.

01:37:57.559 --> 01:37:59.581
This was solidified.

01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:06.487
It was the power of this technology and this approach was clearly demonstrated during the 2016 US election.

01:38:06.867 --> 01:38:10.110
And now the lessons from that have been deployed worldwide.

01:38:13.903 --> 01:38:16.026
The 2021 Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

01:38:16.046 --> 01:38:21.133
So why did they deploy it worldwide and what did they accomplish by applying it worldwide?

01:38:21.173 --> 01:38:30.946
What I would argue is they accomplished is the illusion of a pandemic that was most likely from a lab leak that transfection worked for, but not really because we rushed it.

01:38:32.967 --> 01:38:42.992
He's never bothered to tell anybody in the audience what was accomplished with this never before seen level of fifth generation warfare deployment on the West.

01:38:43.112 --> 01:38:50.536
Not one end point or touchdown has been delineated here because he is a scripted actor.

01:38:52.039 --> 01:38:55.440
Conflict was the first example of 5GW in kinetic battle.

01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:01.561
Don't get the idea that information fifth-generation warfare exists in isolation.

01:39:01.761 --> 01:39:03.461
It is a continuance, a spectrum.

01:39:03.921 --> 01:39:06.442
You can still have kinetic activities.

01:39:07.902 --> 01:39:16.744
You still have all the other... Oh, you mean like killing Brandy Vaughn and giving some kind of transfected cancer to Tony Bark in 2020?

01:39:16.924 --> 01:39:18.184
Is that what you mean?

01:39:19.971 --> 01:39:20.692
portfolio.

01:39:21.112 --> 01:39:39.588
Maybe the killing of some of these AIDS people, maybe the unfortunate, you know, sidewalk injuries that people have, the disappearing, you know, Canadian Chinese people, all that stuff, that's all just, you know, we have kinetic stuff too, absolutely we do.

01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:47.175
But this is a different battlefield landscape in the extreme.

01:39:49.656 --> 01:39:53.178
An example of pure fifth-generation warfare is Havana syndrome.

01:39:53.198 --> 01:40:02.722
Do you remember the people in the embassy in the United States suddenly had these psychological effects, these headaches?

01:40:02.822 --> 01:40:04.123
Nobody knew where they came from.

01:40:04.183 --> 01:40:05.644
Nobody knew how it was happening.

01:40:06.004 --> 01:40:08.265
The State Department denies that it even happens.

01:40:10.206 --> 01:40:11.427
Nobody knows who did it.

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:15.929
This is an example of a perfect fifth-generation warfare weapon.

01:40:19.534 --> 01:40:23.196
Now I'm gonna talk just a moment about sovereignty and what this means.

01:40:24.497 --> 01:40:25.317
What is sovereignty?

01:40:26.738 --> 01:40:28.999
Supreme power over a body politic.

01:40:29.239 --> 01:40:36.703
Sovereignty is what the African states invoked to resist the international health regulations that were being propagated on them last year.

01:40:37.624 --> 01:40:39.105
Thank God for Africa and Brazil.

01:40:45.121 --> 01:40:50.685
Sovereignty is freedom from existing control, from external control, freedom from controlling influence.

01:40:51.886 --> 01:40:54.568
Okay, now let's think about sovereignty.

01:40:54.588 --> 01:40:59.191
You know, we talk about sovereign autonomous nation states.

01:40:59.692 --> 01:41:01.153
Those are treated as obsolete now.

01:41:02.033 --> 01:41:03.414
He was repeating that again.

01:41:05.255 --> 01:41:10.079
The World Economic Forum does not recognize that as the future of human organization.

01:41:11.104 --> 01:41:17.788
Don't forget, he just learned about the World Economic Forum from Mary Holland and Meryl Nass when they went to visit him on his farm in 2020.

01:41:18.088 --> 01:41:27.694
They want a globalist, unelected, centralized command economy, fourth industrial revolution, transhumanism world.

01:41:28.574 --> 01:41:29.635
And we've all seen that movie.

01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:46.146
If the unlimited warfare battleground is for control of your mind, thoughts, and emotions, and all rules of engagement or ethical boundaries are obsolete, then what does sovereignty even mean?

01:41:49.287 --> 01:41:58.011
What is world health when public health policy and pharmaceutical interventions are transformed into just another fifth-generation warfare weapon?

01:41:59.371 --> 01:42:00.852
I'm blowing it with my timing.

01:42:03.803 --> 01:42:04.523
Here's the evidence.

01:42:05.984 --> 01:42:09.527
Militaries all over the Western world have been deployed against us.

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:15.430
They're the ones that have been managing all this propaganda we've been subjected to.

01:42:17.452 --> 01:42:19.012
But it couldn't be these guys.

01:42:19.773 --> 01:42:22.715
That's the whole thing you have to hear over and over and over again.

01:42:22.735 --> 01:42:26.017
He says he's telling you who it is, but he's not really.

01:42:27.068 --> 01:42:36.571
It's the most extensive, wide ranging propaganda effort ever deployed, but it's just kind of military.

01:42:36.811 --> 01:42:39.132
It's a lot of militaries.

01:42:39.352 --> 01:42:40.553
And what did they accomplish?

01:42:40.633 --> 01:42:41.453
You don't really know.

01:42:43.874 --> 01:42:44.854
What does this look like?

01:42:49.536 --> 01:42:49.936
Here we go.

01:43:05.655 --> 01:43:13.728
As the world watches and listens in horror, the peaceful pro-democracy demonstration in China comes to a violent and bloody end.

01:43:13.908 --> 01:43:17.674
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

01:43:26.448 --> 01:43:27.989
course you've seen this video before.

01:43:28.049 --> 01:43:32.532
We've watched it before, but he is pretending to be a messenger.

01:43:32.552 --> 01:43:36.235
That's outing the psi war is outing there.

01:43:36.535 --> 01:43:38.657
He's a messenger bringing you the truth.

01:43:39.257 --> 01:43:50.345
Despite this larger than earth deployment ever before the largest propaganda campaign ever deployed on humankind, but he's exposing it.

01:43:50.746 --> 01:43:53.668
It's just the military, the tip of the spear, baby.

01:43:56.937 --> 01:43:57.737
But it's China!

01:44:00.218 --> 01:44:00.858
It's China?

01:44:02.978 --> 01:44:03.518
I don't get it.

01:44:04.419 --> 01:44:05.239
Is China doing it?

01:44:06.339 --> 01:44:07.599
Or it's these dudes on horses.

01:44:07.859 --> 01:44:10.120
Oh no, it's... They're... Oh, those guys, right.

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:10.840
Yeah, I see.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:12.220
Wow.

01:44:16.981 --> 01:44:18.522
All the world's a stage.

01:44:19.922 --> 01:44:24.803
But... There is another very important phase of warfare.

01:44:26.178 --> 01:44:31.020
It has as its target, not the body, but the mind of the enemy.

01:44:31.681 --> 01:44:33.182
But it's not podcasts.

01:44:34.742 --> 01:44:36.603
They've overlooked podcasts.

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.824
And in fact, podcasts are going to save us.

01:44:39.705 --> 01:44:42.486
There's a dad podcast that's going to save us.

01:44:42.666 --> 01:44:45.528
Dad podcasts save world some shit.

01:44:46.476 --> 01:44:48.877
There's a CEO podcast that's gonna save us.

01:44:49.057 --> 01:44:51.878
The Dark Horse podcast is gonna save us.

01:44:51.938 --> 01:44:56.960
I mean, Eric Weinstein was doing the portal with, and he was gonna save us.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.021
So Fifth Generation Warfare is everywhere.

01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:06.903
It is the biggest propaganda campaign ever released, but the podcasters are gonna save us.

01:45:07.323 --> 01:45:09.104
The sub-stack authors.

01:45:10.185 --> 01:45:16.309
Homesteading, emu breeding, horse selling, substackers are going to save us.

01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:22.732
The target of psychological warfare is against the enemy's mind.

01:45:23.373 --> 01:45:24.694
It is words and ideas.

01:45:25.074 --> 01:45:27.295
Ammunition used by Psi-War.

01:45:34.339 --> 01:45:37.061
Its mission is to influence the thoughts of the enemy soldiers.

01:45:37.566 --> 01:45:46.071
and at the same time is expected and encouraged to study foreign languages and the social sciences such as history, economics and sociology.

01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:54.655
He must have a broad and sympathetic understanding of all phases of human experience.

01:45:57.296 --> 01:46:02.419
I do think it's possible that Ian Carroll is actually going to save us.

01:46:02.539 --> 01:46:05.801
If anybody's going to save us, it's definitely him because of his mustache.

01:46:07.366 --> 01:46:12.311
But the use of this force as an integral part of combat has now taken on new form.

01:46:18.458 --> 01:46:20.040
Where is everywhere?

01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:23.804
Everywhere is the internet, as Robert Malone said.

01:46:23.984 --> 01:46:26.207
Everywhere is social media.

01:46:39.994 --> 01:46:55.301
You know, the burning television is also, it's the old media being replaced by the new media and governments around the world are being, are being coerced into believing and accepting this, the new way that the narrative is controlled.

01:46:55.781 --> 01:47:03.825
Back in the day of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the narrative was controlled by newspapers and magazines and TV channels and that kind of shit.

01:47:04.992 --> 01:47:11.435
And that control mechanism rebelled against John F. Kennedy and killed him and later killed his brother.

01:47:12.315 --> 01:47:24.200
But that was a control mechanism that was already in power, already controlling organized crime in America, already controlling the schools, already controlling a lot of big business.

01:47:26.441 --> 01:47:29.582
And so if anything, what you saw from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:29.622 --> 01:47:32.203
wasn't a takeover, it was just a brief correction.

01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:40.594
of something that was already on course since the Manhattan Project, already on course since the dropping of the bombs, you see?

01:47:41.935 --> 01:47:45.538
Already on course since way before.

01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:55.485
And so once you don't accept the narrative, once you don't wanna play along anymore, you are eliminated.

01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:12.850
And you can hear the sales pitch, right?

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:25.418
If they can claim that Arab Spring and Egypt only happened because of them, then they can also go to the national governments around the world and say, look dudes, you guys are really close to being irrelevant.

01:48:26.819 --> 01:48:31.302
And so now you're going to have to join in on this little engagement.

01:48:31.322 --> 01:48:39.948
You're going to have to participate in global governance by social media, or you will be left behind and you will have no actors in the theater.

01:48:41.187 --> 01:48:48.870
Either you give us a few actors that we can script and go along with this, or we'll do it for you.

01:48:49.450 --> 01:48:51.611
And you'll have no control and no say.

01:48:53.191 --> 01:49:05.115
And so they are actually blackmailing governments all around the world and probably started at the beginning of the pandemic and use the pandemic to convince them that that was indeed the new landscape.

01:49:06.736 --> 01:49:09.717
That national governments and the national show

01:49:11.314 --> 01:49:21.057
is effectively being taken over by international social media, run by different oligarchs than ran the other old media.

01:49:22.137 --> 01:49:23.738
And so have we seen a transition?

01:49:23.778 --> 01:49:25.238
Have we seen a little wrestling match?

01:49:25.318 --> 01:49:25.758
Perhaps.

01:49:28.919 --> 01:49:31.880
But it's a fighting over 40, 60, you know, it's fighting over 55, 45.

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.341
It's not fighting over win or lose.

01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:37.442
They're all on the same team.

01:49:58.396 --> 01:49:58.796
It's him.

01:50:01.298 --> 01:50:01.558
It's him.

01:50:01.578 --> 01:50:02.319
Do you understand?

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.541
That is what we're dealing with.

01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:07.002
Okay?

01:50:07.342 --> 01:50:09.564
Think about how perfect this disguise is.

01:50:10.464 --> 01:50:11.825
Censored on LinkedIn.

01:50:12.826 --> 01:50:24.874
Risking his career to speak out against MRNA and now he's risking his life speaking out against this is the perfect, the absolute quintessential wolf in sheep's clothing.

01:50:25.815 --> 01:50:27.436
And he's even got the sheep face.

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:34.362
with the sheep fur, the nice, you just want to put your hands in that wooly beard.

01:50:36.303 --> 01:50:45.887
It's a wolf in sheep's clothing with no morals that traveled the world and lied to people's faces and was amplified artificially on social media.

01:50:45.948 --> 01:50:50.489
The only way you can survive is to get off and not play.

01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:53.591
That is what is being deployed globally.

01:50:56.874 --> 01:50:57.995
There's some core terms.

01:50:58.035 --> 01:51:00.095
You have to understand what an OODA loop is.

01:51:00.115 --> 01:51:02.577
How many of you saw the new Tom Hanks?

01:51:02.617 --> 01:51:05.258
You don't need to understand what an OODA loop is.

01:51:05.338 --> 01:51:07.459
That is the most retarded shit ever.

01:51:07.479 --> 01:51:13.922
It's a movie with the Jets where they're talking about you have to feel emotionally and act immediately.

01:51:14.442 --> 01:51:16.223
That's OODA loop strategy.

01:51:17.159 --> 01:51:21.441
Okay, learn what this term means, deploy it in social media.

01:51:21.822 --> 01:51:24.723
Oh, so you have to use social media in order to win.

01:51:24.763 --> 01:51:27.685
You have to fight them in their little arena.

01:51:27.725 --> 01:51:29.046
That's just bullshit.

01:51:29.746 --> 01:51:31.827
It's patently bullshit.

01:51:32.748 --> 01:51:39.552
And in January of 2023, more of us should have seen it and exposed it for what it was, but it was just me all by myself.

01:51:42.352 --> 01:52:00.344
Just me all by myself saying, how in the hell is it possible that Sasha Latupova and Hennessey Malhotra and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mike Palmer are all on the stage together and Ryan Cole's in the audience and nobody sees it for what it is, which is the real fifth generation warfare.

01:52:01.005 --> 01:52:05.428
Coordinated groups of people on social media and in person lie into your face.

01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:12.010
Understand the Milgram experiment and the Ash experiment.

01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:14.190
These have clearly- That's true.

01:52:15.151 --> 01:52:32.915
If you understand what they are, then see why it is that Meryl Ness, Sasha Latupova, Robert Malone, and Asim Malhotra all on stage together could easily be exactly these, you know, experiments enacted on an audience.

01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:37.756
That podcasts are exactly that.

01:52:38.843 --> 01:52:40.285
enacted on their audience.

01:52:41.006 --> 01:52:49.437
They are podcasts and social media podcasts and podcasting and discussions are all weaponizations of these two principles.

01:52:53.723 --> 01:52:55.145
Especially the Ash experiment.

01:52:56.854 --> 01:53:09.206
demonstrated the ability to manipulate the human mind and human behavior in ways that are far beyond what we assimilate within our own souls as what we would do, and yet we will.

01:53:11.788 --> 01:53:13.110
Understand lockstep.

01:53:15.151 --> 01:53:26.841
Discussed in a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report lockstep was the idea of using a pandemic to impose Tighter top-down control modeled after this Chinese social credit system.

01:53:27.061 --> 01:53:39.632
This is not a conspiracy theory people folks This has been planned discussed and deployed He just doesn't want you to know that him and Kevin McKernan have been at the table for years already.

01:53:39.652 --> 01:53:39.672
I

01:53:40.663 --> 01:53:48.032
The former research and development director of the Human Genome Project and ultra shithead in my own timeline, Kevin McKernan.

01:53:49.014 --> 01:53:52.398
They just won't tell you, but it's absolutely positively true.

01:53:52.939 --> 01:53:54.541
And I'm betting my family on it.

01:53:57.307 --> 01:53:59.589
Understand what the Five Eyes Alliance are.

01:53:59.629 --> 01:54:00.670
This is fascinating.

01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:03.212
When you think about the landscape right now.

01:54:03.832 --> 01:54:05.754
All the countries that he traveled to, you mean?

01:54:06.334 --> 01:54:09.577
All the countries where all these shitheads on social media are from?

01:54:10.217 --> 01:54:11.038
Those Five Eyes?

01:54:12.079 --> 01:54:12.359
I see.

01:54:14.133 --> 01:54:23.241
and think about what has been the most egregious deployment of totalitarian measures in response to the corona crisis.

01:54:24.042 --> 01:54:25.463
What are the nations that come to mind?

01:54:26.263 --> 01:54:28.926
Australia, Canada, New Zealand.

01:54:29.511 --> 01:54:34.113
I argue that all three of those are now captured client states of the world economic forum.

01:54:34.894 --> 01:54:36.975
You're no longer functioning as autonomous.

01:54:37.315 --> 01:54:38.896
He's so smart.

01:54:39.296 --> 01:54:41.157
He says they're not even working anymore.

01:54:41.197 --> 01:54:42.017
They're just puppets.

01:54:42.137 --> 01:54:42.657
Wow.

01:54:43.018 --> 01:54:44.798
That's some controversial shit, man.

01:54:45.099 --> 01:54:48.900
National entities, the United Kingdom and the United States.

01:54:48.981 --> 01:54:50.001
What ties them together?

01:54:50.521 --> 01:54:54.503
The five eyes alliance, this security consortium.

01:54:54.523 --> 01:54:55.624
Okay.

01:54:56.947 --> 01:55:04.770
Don't forget that Robert Malone's wife is Jill Glasspool Malone and her dad was actually UK intelligence.

01:55:11.392 --> 01:55:12.193
Hey, Mikey Meikster.

01:55:12.984 --> 01:55:29.349
share data among each other, and when they are prohibited from acting against their own citizens, they have reciprocal arrangements so that, for instance, MI5 acts against United States citizens, CIA, NSA, and other US agencies act against UK citizens.

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:32.650
This is this reciprocal five eyes alliance.

01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:35.030
It is the most powerful intelligence.

01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:36.310
So he's telling you what?

01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:39.691
Campbell does and what doc malik does and what?

01:55:40.131 --> 01:55:56.235
Jonathan engler did and what nick hudson does and what claire craig does and why it's really nice to Have claire craig have her accent or why it's really nice for these english guys to do podcasts in america and vice versa that's why some of these people were on australian news and not american news because

01:55:57.426 --> 01:56:00.668
It's all one coordinated show and he's at the head of it.

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:05.370
Organization in the world and it's largely dominating global.

01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:11.313
Quite frankly, I think when he was told to spin his team up at the beginning of the pandemic, that's what he did.

01:56:11.813 --> 01:56:19.017
He spun up a team of narrative control coordinators that could script people on social media.

01:56:21.378 --> 01:56:25.760
Politics through exactly the type of strategies and tactics you just saw with that film.

01:56:26.817 --> 01:56:30.678
Okay, these people are trained to manipulate your mind.

01:56:32.279 --> 01:56:34.780
Now I'm gonna skip this one.

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.982
This is a clip that just shows how actively my Wikipedia page was manipulated.

01:56:41.242 --> 01:56:47.444
But what's fascinating about that is if you track back and look at who did the manipulation, it's a sock puppet.

01:56:48.745 --> 01:56:51.746
And the sock puppet appears to be closely allied with MI5.

01:56:53.575 --> 01:56:53.815
Okay.

01:56:54.195 --> 01:57:02.018
The same sock puppet manipulated Pierre Cory's virtually every page having to do with the use of ivermectin on Wikipedia.

01:57:02.298 --> 01:57:04.119
Can you see the disguise here?

01:57:04.779 --> 01:57:11.822
He's supposedly giving away that MI5 was, was manipulating Wikipedia, both his and Pierre Cory's.

01:57:12.222 --> 01:57:21.566
And so that means that him and Pierre Cory must be good guys, just like Sasha Latupova and Meryl Nass, Hennessey Malhotra and Mike Palmer, who he shared his hotel breakfast with.

01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:24.453
Holy shit.

01:57:24.894 --> 01:57:25.616
Same people did it.

01:57:25.816 --> 01:57:26.819
Same organization.

01:57:30.288 --> 01:57:31.171
The Overton window.

01:57:32.227 --> 01:57:32.487
Okay.

01:57:32.927 --> 01:57:38.851
The range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time is known as the window of discourse.

01:57:39.291 --> 01:57:46.975
Fifth generation information warfare methods seek to actively manipulate the Overton window to constrain what we are allowed to talk about.

01:57:47.255 --> 01:57:47.916
Oh, interesting.

01:57:47.936 --> 01:57:55.300
You mean like talking about whether it's a national natural virus or whether it was a lab leak, but accepting the premise that it's novel.

01:57:57.406 --> 01:57:58.307
Shall I repeat that?

01:57:58.367 --> 01:58:04.934
You mean arguing about whether it's a natural virus or a lab leak virus while accepting the premise that it's novel in either case?

01:58:05.415 --> 01:58:06.276
Is that what you mean?

01:58:11.206 --> 01:58:19.936
That's when you talk about gaslighting and these various techniques, the manipulation in the media, the redefinition of language that's used, right?

01:58:20.056 --> 01:58:22.259
Vaccination is no longer vaccination.

01:58:22.539 --> 01:58:26.604
An anti-vaxxer is anybody who is against Band-Aids, okay?

01:58:26.905 --> 01:58:27.846
This is active.

01:58:30.137 --> 01:58:32.799
An anti-vaxxer is somebody who's against mandates.

01:58:32.859 --> 01:58:38.102
That's exactly the grift of the big top tent of health freedom that CHD is.

01:58:38.662 --> 01:58:41.944
He's actually reciting the bullshit.

01:58:44.646 --> 01:58:45.467
Do you see it now?

01:58:47.068 --> 01:58:55.613
How thorough this was done, how well it was planned, how nicely orchestrated it was, and how he's not actually telling you it, but he is.

01:58:57.085 --> 01:59:03.306
It's him, it's CHD, it's ICANN, it's the Brownstone, it's FLCCC, now IMA.

01:59:03.846 --> 01:59:07.887
It's the American doctors, it's all of them.

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:12.328
Manipulation of the Overton window, that's how it's done.

01:59:13.128 --> 01:59:15.109
What is acceptable political discourse?

01:59:15.509 --> 01:59:19.930
The Dunning-Kruger effect is employed on a daily basis.

01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:25.511
People have a tendency to think they're smarter than they are, that they're more competent than they are.

01:59:26.636 --> 01:59:31.221
That is a tool, a weapon, an opportunity.

01:59:31.621 --> 01:59:43.193
And every once in a while you get somebody who's not, like me, who screws it up for all these people, who doesn't buy in, who doesn't go along.

01:59:45.415 --> 01:59:47.297
And they made a mistake, ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:47.317 --> 01:59:49.999
I'm not supposed to be in that book, so you gotta buy it.

01:59:50.796 --> 01:59:51.817
You gotta scare them.

01:59:52.438 --> 01:59:56.404
I think that CHD would be terrified if that book started to sell.

01:59:57.568 --> 02:00:12.059
They would be terrified because that book is actually evidence that for a time, this show, this national security actor governed show was trying to absorb Jonathan Cooley from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:00:12.099 --> 02:00:19.385
They started with Piper Stover, then they moved to Brett Weinstein and Alexandros Marinos and Chris Martinson and Heather Haying.

02:00:19.425 --> 02:00:24.549
Then they moved on to Matt Crawford and to Steve Kirsch and to Robert, sorry,

02:00:25.089 --> 02:00:27.811
Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose.

02:00:27.931 --> 02:00:33.976
Then they moved on to Panda and Nick Hudson and Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler.

02:00:34.016 --> 02:00:38.079
Then they moved on to CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:00:38.219 --> 02:00:40.101
on and off for another year and a half.

02:00:40.982 --> 02:00:42.363
And then finally they gave up.

02:00:43.844 --> 02:00:46.466
But it was already too late because I shouldn't be in that book.

02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:52.731
It should be Charles Rixey, like Kevin McKernan said on the Danny Jones podcast in November of 2024.

02:00:54.508 --> 02:00:56.409
as an attempt to correct the narrative.

02:00:57.009 --> 02:01:00.231
You know, make up for the fact that they shouldn't have printed my frickin' name in the book.

02:01:02.472 --> 02:01:04.813
It'll be very curious when that name disappears.

02:01:06.333 --> 02:01:17.718
The Wuhan coverup is one of the biggest pieces of evidence that says that this is all one malevolent fifth-generation warfare show that scripted Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:17.818 --> 02:01:23.241
and Mary Holland, that scripted ICANN and Del Bigtree.

02:01:24.158 --> 02:01:29.820
that probably scripted Barbara Lowe Fisher and that whole group of people.

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.281
Definitely that killed Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:46.104
Frankly, if you want to operate effectively in this space, I argue you have no other alternative other than humility.

02:01:47.236 --> 02:01:49.217
You have to acknowledge your ignorance.

02:01:49.457 --> 02:01:53.238
I am profoundly ignorant about what is going on here.

02:01:53.298 --> 02:01:54.979
I have been ignorant all the way through.

02:01:55.339 --> 02:02:03.362
It's been a journey to discovery, and every day I learn something new, and every day I find out about my own cognitive biases.

02:02:05.663 --> 02:02:06.683
Remember this slide.

02:02:07.504 --> 02:02:08.564
Remember this slide.

02:02:09.204 --> 02:02:11.045
Remember this slide.

02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:18.235
That doesn't look fake, and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:02:18.996 --> 02:02:24.322
That doesn't look fake, and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:02:25.082 --> 02:02:30.388
That doesn't look fake, and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

02:02:31.021 --> 02:02:33.443
That's fifth generation warfare, ladies and gentlemen.

02:02:34.043 --> 02:02:37.706
I'm sorry to really say it so bluntly, but that's fifth generation warfare.

02:02:38.427 --> 02:02:45.853
Tomorrow, I wanna cover this a little further by delving into, I was gonna play music, but I don't have the voice to do it.

02:02:46.493 --> 02:02:47.874
I wanna delve into this.

02:02:48.595 --> 02:02:57.081
So let me just play this video without Mike barking in the background, and then let you know that I wanna use Brett Weinstein to break this.

02:02:57.922 --> 02:03:07.995
I think Bret Weinstein and Robert Malone can be used to break this rule by podcast illusion for Americans and maybe for a lot of people in the West.

02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:20.099
And I really think it's possible because they are over their skis and they are not following their assumptions to the logical conclusions that they lead to.

02:03:20.859 --> 02:03:24.702
That's why they still haven't figured out that intramuscular injection is just dumb.

02:03:24.742 --> 02:03:27.544
That's why they still haven't figured out that RNA can't pandemic.

02:03:28.225 --> 02:03:36.051
That's why they still haven't figured out that this is old transfection technology being recycled and renamed to reset the intellectual property.

02:03:37.349 --> 02:03:39.350
because they are scripted not to.

02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:44.952
And Bret Weinstein is one of the worst, and it can be seen in his last podcast.

02:03:44.992 --> 02:03:47.373
Download it, watch it, study it.

02:03:48.213 --> 02:03:49.814
The illusion is about to be broken.

02:03:52.855 --> 02:03:57.456
The implications of those two versions of history are radically different.

02:03:58.197 --> 02:03:58.857
In one of them,

02:04:00.171 --> 02:04:04.254
the country got a new president and moved on and healed.

02:04:04.374 --> 02:04:09.537
And it doesn't mean that we are restored to what we were, but at least we know what world we live in.

02:04:09.577 --> 02:04:15.381
We live in a democracy and things ebb and flow between our two parties, et cetera, et cetera.

02:04:15.761 --> 02:04:22.886
On the other hand, if 1963 was a coup, if somebody took out President Kennedy and

02:04:23.985 --> 02:04:29.407
thereby installed their own power structure, you don't know what world you live in.

02:04:29.947 --> 02:04:38.030
Do you live in a democracy or do you live in a, you know, a country that has experienced a coup and pretends to have a democracy by having elections?

02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:42.611
I want you to just think about something for just one second because it bothers me very much.

02:04:43.552 --> 02:04:47.913
But his father worked in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:04:47.873 --> 02:04:48.333
's dad.

02:04:52.455 --> 02:04:53.495
So suggesting

02:04:54.775 --> 02:04:56.777
See, he survived the killings.

02:04:56.817 --> 02:04:59.159
He didn't die like Hestus Kefauver.

02:04:59.179 --> 02:05:01.181
He didn't die like John F. Kennedy.

02:05:01.201 --> 02:05:02.903
He didn't die like Robert F. Kennedy.

02:05:03.844 --> 02:05:16.496
Les Weinstein served in the Department of Justice during the modernization of the FDA and lived through it, unlike John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Hestus Kefauver.

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:26.045
And yet somehow or another, this guy is claiming to shed light on some organization that decided to off the Kennedys.

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:32.810
Doesn't mention Kefauver and doesn't mention that his dad was actually in the fricking government when that happened.

02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:34.311
That's no big deal.

02:05:35.942 --> 02:05:37.984
that do not actually shift power.

02:05:38.064 --> 02:05:43.409
Those are such fundamentally different versions of America.

02:05:44.410 --> 02:05:51.597
So in one version, some scary black op killed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:05:51.657 --> 02:05:54.240
and from that moment on took over the United States.

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:57.023
Wasn't something that existed beforehand.

02:05:57.603 --> 02:06:00.325
and was briefly having problems with the Kennedy family.

02:06:00.365 --> 02:06:00.685
No, no.

02:06:01.346 --> 02:06:04.628
It was something that before that, everything was fine.

02:06:05.108 --> 02:06:08.871
And then it took over by killing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:09.532 --> 02:06:16.797
and John F. Kennedy, sorry, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy while his dad was in the Department of Justice as an IP lawyer.

02:06:18.798 --> 02:06:19.659
I'm not making it up.

02:06:19.979 --> 02:06:20.880
It's just the way it is.

02:06:22.293 --> 02:06:25.958
being able to resolve between them is paralyzing.

02:06:26.258 --> 02:06:26.679
Yeah, right.

02:06:28.141 --> 02:06:30.684
Okay, but that's only two universes, right?

02:06:30.744 --> 02:06:37.413
That's two universes where you don't know what kind of country you live in a democracy or a cryptic

02:06:38.931 --> 02:06:55.864
Are you hearing a very, you're about to hear, if you haven't heard it already and felt it, a very similar description to fifth generation warfare that Robert Malone told us three years ago on a stage in Stockholm, Sweden with Sasha Latupova, Meryl Ness, Robert Malone, Nassim Malhotra, and Mike Palmer.

02:06:56.745 --> 02:07:00.408
Authoritarian structure over which you have no democratic influence.

02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:05.352
What I suspect is about to happen is that

02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:18.987
The Cartesian crisis, which I've described many times, Cartesian crisis is the state in which your certainty over what's taking place is low quality, right?

02:07:19.808 --> 02:07:22.271
Does, did COVID come from the wild?

02:07:22.311 --> 02:07:22.952
Did it come from

02:07:23.613 --> 02:07:23.993
a lab.

02:07:24.374 --> 02:07:47.192
It's exactly what again right was the whole idea of social media was to create the world where nobody could be certain of anything exactly what Robert Malone said and then the problem is is that you can't we are so uncertain you don't realize that it is Brett Weinstein who is a scripted national security actor that Alexandros Marinos is a scripted national security actor that

02:07:47.712 --> 02:07:54.316
Chris Martinson is a national security actor that Robert Malone, Meryl Ness, Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:07:54.336 --> 02:07:56.717
and all of them are national security actors.

02:07:58.658 --> 02:07:59.878
Podcasts are going to save us.

02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:07.022
You know, is are the vaccines safe and effective?

02:08:07.302 --> 02:08:13.245
Are they highly dangerous gene therapies that have been disguised as vaccines to get you to take them?

02:08:13.605 --> 02:08:16.147
You don't know what to believe across many different topics.

02:08:17.247 --> 02:08:27.831
And this is largely downstream of the fact that much of what we come to understand about the world is now intermediated by screens and authority.

02:08:28.151 --> 02:08:30.652
Some authority comes up with some conclusion.

02:08:31.052 --> 02:08:33.933
You are fed that conclusion through some screen.

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.193
You don't necessarily know what you're seeing.

02:08:36.594 --> 02:08:40.755
Are we a planet that is regularly being visited by aliens?

02:08:41.455 --> 02:08:43.616
Or are we a planet in which some

02:08:45.353 --> 02:08:49.017
powerful group or groups would like us to think that that's what's going on.

02:08:49.377 --> 02:08:49.818
We don't know.

02:08:50.058 --> 02:08:52.781
So we have to hold both possibilities open.

02:08:53.782 --> 02:09:07.556
And the problem is that you don't, though, you don't have you don't have to hold all stupid possibilities open, but you do if you have acquiesced to using social media to figure shit out.

02:09:08.496 --> 02:09:16.023
If you haven't followed Robert Malone's advice and just not play the game, then yeah, you're kind of screwed if you use social media to figure it out.

02:09:16.063 --> 02:09:21.067
And the worst part is, is that this guy is part of the reason why you will never figure it out.

02:09:21.107 --> 02:09:22.328
He is an employee.

02:09:22.789 --> 02:09:26.812
He is a national security scripted actor on a strictly need to know basis.

02:09:27.413 --> 02:09:30.636
Just like Robert Malone, although Robert Malone knows a hell of a lot more.

02:09:32.276 --> 02:09:40.203
For each one of these things, you are effectively defining, you are doubling the number of universes you live in, right?

02:09:40.323 --> 02:09:48.431
So you've got a, you know, the Kennedy assassination was a coup versus the Kennedy assassination was a tragedy that left democracy intact.

02:09:48.691 --> 02:09:50.012
That describes two universes.

02:09:50.432 --> 02:09:58.420
In both of those universes, you have a question about whether or not aliens regularly visit the earth or somebody wants you to think so, but it's a psyop.

02:09:59.377 --> 02:10:01.919
Okay, so that's four universes.

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:13.250
Each time you have one of these unresolved questions of major import, it doubles the number of universes that you have to keep alive so that you can plot your course.

02:10:13.410 --> 02:10:18.735
You know, if it turns out that it was a coup, but the aliens are real, then what do I do, right?

02:10:19.555 --> 02:10:19.716
Now,

02:10:20.649 --> 02:10:31.283
The punchline here is that AI is about, within the next year or so, going to be capable of producing

02:10:32.827 --> 02:10:35.129
compelling video evidence that will not be detectable.

02:10:35.550 --> 02:10:36.731
It's getting better all the time.

02:10:36.911 --> 02:10:43.698
It's already deficient that, you know, even an animal behaviorist like you or me will sometimes see.

02:10:43.898 --> 02:10:46.041
They are animal behaviorists now.

02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:52.908
Not only are they evolutionary systems, something complex systems people, but they're also animal behaviorists.

02:10:52.968 --> 02:10:53.528
That's awesome.

02:10:53.929 --> 02:10:54.469
The video

02:10:55.610 --> 02:10:57.832
of a creature that we don't know.

02:10:58.112 --> 02:11:00.875
And it's a little hard to know whether or not that's a real creature.

02:11:01.095 --> 02:11:03.777
You know, I would say I'm at about four in five.

02:11:03.957 --> 02:11:06.139
I'm still not convinced that A.I.

02:11:06.219 --> 02:11:07.820
is making any of these videos.

02:11:08.741 --> 02:11:21.772
I'm still just not convinced that it's not that it's not a machine learning algorithm that has been manually trained by thousands of Indians that are all using Photoshop and Illustrator.

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:40.786
That to me is the most logical conclusion, that they took AI and a language learning, you know, whatever, a large learning algorithm, some kind of language learning model, and trained it with thousands of talented Indian artists.

02:11:41.633 --> 02:11:43.835
that said, you know, this is what this looks like.

02:11:43.855 --> 02:11:44.916
This is what that looks like.

02:11:44.936 --> 02:11:46.017
And they did it for years.

02:11:46.878 --> 02:11:49.240
And now they have something that can produce some shit.

02:11:49.741 --> 02:11:51.743
And now we're supposed to start training it again.

02:11:51.803 --> 02:11:56.267
But this is all an elaborate hoax because it doesn't matter.

02:11:56.287 --> 02:12:05.036
And it would be so less, much less effective than just putting coordinated liars on social media and pretending it was AI.

02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:28.821
pretending the danger is AI, pretending the impending doom is AI, and the impending trapdoor that's closing is AI, rather than the trapdoor already being closed because you've accepted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Robert Malone, Peter Daszak, Tony Fauci, you know, Massey, and Johnson, and frickin' The Weinstein Show.

02:12:30.063 --> 02:12:30.503
examples.

02:12:30.563 --> 02:12:39.490
I can usually spot it but at four and five is not as good as I would like it and within a year, maybe it'll be one in five that I'll be able to be sure.

02:12:40.911 --> 02:12:54.561
At some point two years down the road, I won't be able to be sure at all because the AI will be refined enough to know what a plausible creature looks like and it will be able to therefore create creatures that if you don't actually have experience with them, you wouldn't know one way or the other.

02:13:00.083 --> 02:13:08.969
First, a radical increase in the rate of proliferation of cognitive universes that we are forced to keep alive.

02:13:10.427 --> 02:13:18.294
And I suspect that the immediate consequence of that is going to be paralysis.

02:13:19.395 --> 02:13:32.986
That the number of different combinations of possibilities where you cannot resolve, you cannot get closure and say, I think I live in this world and so I'm going to ignore all of those possibilities over there and go forward as if this is true.

02:13:33.527 --> 02:13:37.770
You're basically going to become agnostic about just about everything.

02:13:39.321 --> 02:13:51.709
So in this mental multiverse, you will maybe be able to avoid embarrassment by not putting your weight on any of the ice, but you can't accomplish anything in that state.

02:13:52.110 --> 02:13:53.210
And that's what I'm concerned about.

02:13:53.651 --> 02:13:55.572
He's not, he's not concerned about it.

02:13:55.612 --> 02:13:57.113
He's employed to make that happen.

02:13:57.955 --> 02:14:02.018
He and the intellectual dark web have been deployed to make that happen.

02:14:02.058 --> 02:14:15.829
Robert Malone, CHD, the Brownstone Institute, Independent Medical Alliance, these have all been deployed to make sure that the number of social media multiverses is ever expanding.

02:14:16.349 --> 02:14:26.158
Instead of simplifying it down to, you know, old technology lied about, about shitty ideas like intramuscular injection being really just dumb ideas from the 1800s.

02:14:26.219 --> 02:14:27.360
It's not that complicated.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.645
People got it wrong and went with it for a long, long, long time.

02:14:36.248 --> 02:14:40.172
We're going to break this illusion like a rock with a great big hammer.

02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:47.074
And this was just the very, very start of the hammering that I'm going to do in the month of August.

02:14:48.855 --> 02:15:03.965
We are going to be collectively put into a circumstance where everybody will be afraid to assume enough about the world to actually be capable of acting rationally towards it.

02:15:04.966 --> 02:15:07.127
And that's a very frightening prospect.

02:15:08.148 --> 02:15:08.888
Yeah, it is.

02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:28.369
It's terrifying, and it does point to the need for actual physical interactions with the world and with people, and to work hard to decrease the percentage of the interactions that you have that are mitigated by screens, that could be mitigated by AI whether or not you know it.

02:15:29.099 --> 02:15:50.868
that when you are in the physical presence of another organism, be it human or otherwise, that is doing something, at least now, that is not... and your sensory biases exist, and you and I could be watching the same thing and see something different, but what we saw was real if it was, you know, a fox on the ground doing something.

02:15:51.528 --> 02:15:57.592
and it is not mitigated by AI, whereas nothing coming through the screens at this point.

02:15:59.353 --> 02:16:16.283
You and I are having this conversation, Jen's in the next room, the three of us know that we're here doing this, our dogs on the floor behind us, but none of the tens of thousands of people who will listen to or watch this can know with 100% assurance that you and I are actually here doing the thing that we're doing.

02:16:16.638 --> 02:16:28.629
She wants you to believe is that you don't know for sure because AI is so good, you don't have to worry about her husband or her being on a national security prioritized script.

02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:30.650
You don't have to worry about that at all.

02:16:30.690 --> 02:16:37.216
What you have to worry about is making sure that you can still tell the difference between a real video and one that would be faked.

02:16:39.518 --> 02:16:40.759
Stop lying!

02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:16.171
Think but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:17:17.981 --> 02:17:18.682
And I have lied.

02:17:18.702 --> 02:17:19.722
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:17:19.742 --> 02:17:21.444
I don't want to lie, you know?

02:17:21.464 --> 02:17:22.544
I don't think I'm a liar.

02:17:22.644 --> 02:17:23.665
I try not to be a liar.

02:17:23.685 --> 02:17:25.106
I don't want to be a liar.

02:17:25.126 --> 02:17:28.809
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

02:17:28.829 --> 02:17:31.291
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know?

02:17:31.311 --> 02:17:32.812
You can sort of feel it in people.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.421
I'm gonna try and say this.

02:17:46.693 --> 02:17:49.414
without crying, but my family's coming home tomorrow.

02:17:50.835 --> 02:17:51.576
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:17:54.817 --> 02:17:55.658
God, I miss them.
