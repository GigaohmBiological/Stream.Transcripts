WEBVTT

00:01.431 --> 00:04.593
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:21.704 --> 00:25.666
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

00:25.926 --> 00:28.567
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

00:29.067 --> 00:33.229
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

00:33.289 --> 00:36.350
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

00:37.691 --> 00:45.354
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

00:45.814 --> 00:47.255
All of that was on a global basis.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.769
in condition that we will not call autism.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.470
I don't like the word autism.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.411
He was vaccine damaged.

01:18.791 --> 01:20.211
He was neurologically damaged.

01:21.092 --> 01:23.473
In condition that we will not call autism.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.334
I don't like the word autism.

01:26.234 --> 01:27.174
He was vaccine damaged.

01:28.995 --> 01:30.516
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:31.136 --> 01:32.897
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:34.705 --> 01:35.405
And I have lied.

01:35.425 --> 01:36.466
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:36.486 --> 01:38.247
I don't want to lie, you know?

01:38.327 --> 01:39.287
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:39.387 --> 01:40.408
I try not to be a liar.

01:40.428 --> 01:41.228
I don't want to be a liar.

01:41.829 --> 01:44.510
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

02:31.601 --> 02:32.801
I don't care how you get there.

02:32.821 --> 02:35.522
I don't care what you do to get there.

02:35.542 --> 02:43.385
The goal is to win.

02:43.445 --> 02:57.030
It's like I can't make the mouse click over there.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.311
It's getting harder and harder.

03:00.543 --> 03:20.321
harder and harder to stay focused on the biology not to take the bait on social media just watching a video like this and realizing how many of these images almost instantaneously your brain can recognize and the reason why is because we've been training ourselves for the last five years on social media to think in these

03:21.062 --> 03:39.757
Simple things these simple terms these simple Memes more or less right and so it is extraordinary what they can do with with a little computer program Of course, it's not a lot of hard work here to create something that can do this more importantly what you should see is how your

03:40.418 --> 03:51.665
The fervent use of social media has sort of created this ability for you to see certain memes and certain ideas instantaneously.

03:52.125 --> 04:00.690
That's a pretty hardcore processor you've got between your ears there that can see faces and put them into context almost in an instant.

04:01.631 --> 04:06.374
That's really what should frighten you because that's exactly how quickly

04:06.954 --> 04:09.798
People on social media can manipulate you.

04:09.878 --> 04:23.676
They can occupy your mind, and how they occupy your mind is by convincing you that certain questions are interesting, certain conclusions are inevitable, and anybody that needs to be paid off will be paid off.

04:24.497 --> 04:31.042
Anybody else that needs to be just ignored will be ignored because that's what they can do with simple programming on social media.

04:31.082 --> 04:34.385
They want you to believe that all this stuff is out of their control.

04:34.405 --> 04:46.734
But actually, autism disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.877
And you can say exactly the same for pandemics and gain of function.

04:50.897 --> 04:51.718
These are also myths.

04:52.458 --> 04:58.459
used to make sure these things are never questioned, and that these answers are never questioned.

04:59.239 --> 05:11.722
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, if you don't understand why that sound in the background is an air conditioner, you might be confused, but certainly it won't be a trap that your grandchildren will wake up in.

05:12.362 --> 05:13.002
And this is.

05:13.223 --> 05:14.903
This biology is a trap

05:15.603 --> 05:20.450
that actually we have a chance to prevent our grandchildren from inheriting.

05:21.071 --> 05:29.343
This is a big opportunity that we have, and it's an opportunity that will only present itself one in many generations, I think.

05:31.109 --> 05:37.110
to learn this biology and pass this real biology on to our children is an opportunity that we have.

05:38.390 --> 05:42.391
I don't think that this opportunity is indefinitely available to us.

05:43.951 --> 05:52.113
And in fact, I think, you know, the human race is vulnerable to slavery and it is invulnerable to enslavement.

05:52.333 --> 05:58.174
And it really comes down to whether or not we take responsibility for teaching our children or not.

05:59.214 --> 06:02.877
Ladies and gentlemen, shout out to Mark Hucytonic in Boston.

06:02.937 --> 06:06.801
Shout out to biologyphenomenon.substack.com.

06:06.841 --> 06:09.543
It's a substack about the murder in Scotland.

06:11.024 --> 06:14.027
And may you know the truth, and I hope you can find it.

06:14.047 --> 06:15.248
I hope you find a little bit here.

06:26.933 --> 06:29.094
I still really enjoy this mix.

06:30.795 --> 06:32.736
Coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

06:32.756 --> 06:35.437
This is a stream from an American out of America.

06:36.418 --> 06:39.039
But I am calling CQDX.

06:39.139 --> 06:41.240
I am looking for long-range contacts.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.723
I'm looking to alert the world that America has been infiltrated.

06:46.502 --> 06:50.845
We are being undermined from within, and maybe that's the case for quite a long time.

06:51.925 --> 07:01.551
With regard to the biology, if you're here for a while, you're at the top of the wave where you stay focused on the biology, not take the bait on TV and on social media and love your neighbor.

07:01.591 --> 07:05.774
If not, you might be a skilled TV watcher, a skilled social media user in need of saving.

07:06.594 --> 07:13.696
And we are training lifeguards here every day in the basic biology and we need more trainers.

07:14.136 --> 07:16.077
It doesn't have to just be me.

07:17.437 --> 07:28.380
But I am a long-time academic struggling to get tenure in the field of neuroscience working on the brains of mice and monkeys and humans actually in Rotterdam.

07:29.870 --> 07:31.794
So I'm not without fault here.

07:32.174 --> 07:34.278
I fell for the academic trap a long time ago.

07:34.339 --> 07:35.921
I fell for the p-value trap.

07:36.402 --> 07:42.133
And you can find the evidence of my work as an academy magician on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

07:43.035 --> 07:53.021
You can find my more recent work garbled up in the Wuhan cover-up book written by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of the United States of America, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

07:54.002 --> 08:00.907
You can't find very much of me by Children's Health Defense, although I was employed by them as a staff scientist for a time.

08:01.987 --> 08:05.708
And you wouldn't know it, but Jay Bhattacharya and I are actually pretty good friends.

08:05.748 --> 08:08.850
We've been friends for what would amount to a few years now.

08:10.070 --> 08:14.892
But he's been very busy since he's been appointed and confirmed as the

08:15.825 --> 08:18.448
NIH director, so I haven't heard from him since.

08:18.989 --> 08:21.071
Hopefully I'll see him at a barbecue this summer, maybe.

08:22.072 --> 08:23.754
Anyway, this is Giggo and Biological.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.656
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooey.

08:25.776 --> 08:27.117
I am the chief biologist here.

08:27.137 --> 08:31.822
I am in the back of my garage, and that noise you hear is the air conditioner on the wall.

08:32.843 --> 08:33.183
It's hot.

08:33.483 --> 08:33.984
It's hot.

08:34.404 --> 08:35.924
Hot in Pittsburgh, I tell you what.

08:35.964 --> 08:36.425
It's hot.

08:36.505 --> 08:37.445
Like jungle hot.

08:38.345 --> 08:41.106
I used to have a YouTube channel called JC on a Bike.

08:41.126 --> 08:41.607
Still do.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.807
Don't use it.

08:42.907 --> 08:44.048
Great videos there.

08:44.928 --> 08:47.809
A great, you know, kind of evidence of what I was up to.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.390
How I was fooled.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.533
JC in the Woods is where I'm currently streaming on YouTube.

08:52.553 --> 08:56.478
It's not necessarily the best place, but I know that some people like an archive there, so I do it.

08:57.659 --> 09:00.182
Welcome, welcome, welcome Howard the Duck.

09:00.202 --> 09:03.927
Christy was first in the chat, unfortunately, but good to see you there, Howard.

09:04.447 --> 09:06.349
How it works is that people are sharing my work.

09:06.389 --> 09:07.951
That's the most important thing because

09:08.632 --> 09:14.578
People that just find my work for the first time, a lot of them are actually inspired to donate in some way or another, and so that helps a lot.

09:14.658 --> 09:18.462
Sharing the work actually does more to push the ball than you might think.

09:18.482 --> 09:21.685
You can share the work by pointing people to GigaOMBiological.com.

09:22.246 --> 09:23.948
I don't think it's that bad of a website.

09:23.968 --> 09:26.110
If you're clicking around on there, you'll find some things.

09:26.691 --> 09:31.455
The one trouble is we're not really good at collecting people's email addresses, so we have a couple different

09:32.196 --> 09:37.760
places where that could happen, where I don't necessarily know all the ways that we can access that list.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.582
I think probably our web host has more access to it than we do.

09:41.642 --> 09:42.883
So I'm still working on that.

09:43.223 --> 09:44.384
Phila's still working on that.

09:44.444 --> 09:47.086
Phila's not an IT expert.

09:47.566 --> 09:51.709
She is an actual plant physiologist, heavy metal plant physiologist.

09:51.789 --> 09:56.192
Used to work on eridopsis, one of the model plants in genetic biology.

09:57.312 --> 09:59.694
Anyway, welcome to the show Skigo and Biological.

09:59.714 --> 10:04.697
I'm going to transition over to the Star Trek set in just a second here.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.860
Yes, this will work.

10:13.564 --> 10:14.524
That should do it.

10:16.065 --> 10:24.892
This mouse is not always clicking somewhere useful.

10:26.596 --> 10:27.437
So strange.

10:29.118 --> 10:31.300
My computer is still doing goofy things.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.061
I think I might even shut it off.

10:36.023 --> 10:39.566
What I think happened was my laptop stayed on all night.

10:39.866 --> 10:41.067
It's very hot in here.

10:43.470 --> 10:46.191
And it ran its battery dead, but it was on, you know?

10:46.291 --> 10:49.713
So, like, something... When I got up this morning, it was pissed.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.554
And when I started it up, it was really mad.

10:53.114 --> 10:57.236
And also hot, which, generally speaking, if it's been off all night, it shouldn't be.

10:57.296 --> 10:58.937
So I'm hoping that's the problem.

10:59.697 --> 11:02.339
I'm hoping we're just still coping with that issue.

11:02.359 --> 11:05.500
Let me just see if this is still goofy here.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.041
Can I play it again now?

11:09.645 --> 11:10.186
and pause it.

11:10.366 --> 11:11.067
Yes, I can.

11:11.207 --> 11:12.848
Okay, so it seems to be working again.

11:12.868 --> 11:13.489
I don't know.

11:14.350 --> 11:22.899
The DJ software seems to take up an extraordinary amount of space and CPU just to represent the sounds, I think, or something.

11:22.939 --> 11:23.700
It's really weird.

11:24.901 --> 11:38.784
It can overheat if you're just playing music with the DJ thing, which I find extraordinary for a computer that can do, like, you can have Photoshop and Adobe Premiere open and work that thing all day long and, you know, it'll be fine.

11:38.824 --> 11:41.945
And so when you put this DJ thing on, something else is going on there.

11:41.985 --> 11:42.785
It's taking too much.

11:42.926 --> 11:43.166
Anyway.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.735
Yeah, that was the pickup line I used on my wife.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.137
She did work on heavy metals though.

11:49.157 --> 11:54.243
Cadmium and Zinc in Aerodopsis and their compartmentalization.

11:54.263 --> 11:55.905
You know, like where does the plant put them?

11:56.406 --> 11:58.509
When it sucks them up in the roots, how does it get rid of them?

11:58.549 --> 11:59.130
Where does it go?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.812
Does it go in all places or whatever?

12:01.773 --> 12:11.037
And then seeing if there was a possibility to genetically modify a plant maybe to make it go somewhere else because the ultimate idea or maybe breed plants was probably obviously the better way to do it.

12:11.077 --> 12:12.057
That's what the EU wanted.

12:13.938 --> 12:19.300
So that you could use a remedial plant that might also have a secondary use like rapeseed oil.

12:20.421 --> 12:26.843
So you could use rapeseed for example to clean up soil in the south of Belgium where it's all got a bunch of heavy metals in it.

12:26.883 --> 12:28.624
Maybe that would be something that in theory

12:29.364 --> 12:30.765
would be useful in Pittsburgh.

12:30.825 --> 12:37.930
And so I'm not, you know, I'm not going to evaluate it live on on stream here, but that's the kind of thing that they fund.

12:38.350 --> 12:48.958
And so it's a combination of genetic modification, breeding and also, you know, soil, environmental cleanup.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.180
So you get all these boxes ticked.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.861
And I think that probably in plant

12:54.782 --> 13:04.208
science in general has really got to grab as many of those as possible and juggle them because there's so little funding for plant science.

13:04.248 --> 13:21.639
So the more things that you can check, you know, approved by Greta Thunberg and also by Bill Gates and also by, you know, anything that Alzheimer's, you know, whatever you could possibly imagine would need to be put into a plant grant in order to get it funded.

13:22.279 --> 13:37.466
And so this kind of thing where, you know, you're using a model plant, you're looking at sequestration, I can't say it quite right, I'm sure, of heavy metals, and then under the

13:38.366 --> 13:47.114
under the intention of, I would maybe use the word guise of environmental remediation, while not evaluating anything else, right?

13:47.134 --> 13:54.821
They didn't like first have my wife go out into the field and find out which plants take up the most heavy metals.

13:55.322 --> 13:56.423
They started with a couple

13:58.404 --> 13:59.204
you know, ideas.

13:59.264 --> 14:19.608
The rapeseed part didn't even last very long, but the rapeseed part was the idea, because if you could get rapeseed to put the heavy metals in the leaves and the stems, but not in the seeds, then you could grow rapeseed on that soil, get the rapeseed to pull the metals out, and still have a semi-useful crop.

14:19.668 --> 14:21.788
Rapeseed oil, I guess, is used for some things.

14:21.848 --> 14:23.009
I don't know if you eat it or not.

14:24.249 --> 14:24.829
Anyway,

14:25.949 --> 14:27.250
You can see how far this goes.

14:27.290 --> 14:35.753
You can see how far academic science goes where you're this incredibly narrow sort of expertise.

14:36.394 --> 14:52.281
And Firla was trained in a bunch of other stuff and then became kind of a biologist when she started doing her PhD, but it fit right in because her background was all this environmental stuff and this, you know, thinking about water and she had some kind of like

14:54.611 --> 14:58.513
almost like a degree where you might go into a bachelor's degree and work for the UN.

14:58.573 --> 15:02.355
And they have a lot of that in the Netherlands, of course, you know how that is.

15:03.775 --> 15:18.522
So both Phila and I really have some crazy kind of, you know, conversations where we'll be sitting on the porch and out of nowhere we'll veer off into this idea of how money is spent in the tropics for nothing and how they

15:19.102 --> 15:27.604
you know, interfere with the way those countries, you know, operate and are governed and can extract natural resources under the pretense of these other things.

15:28.284 --> 15:38.747
And she actually knows a lot more about that than I do, because I think in the Netherlands, there's a lot more activism associated with that, a lot more kind of brass tacks talking about it too, because it's a smaller country.

15:39.887 --> 15:46.609
And at least at the, you know, in general, there's a lot of very well read and active people thinking there.

15:46.669 --> 15:47.089
And so it's,

15:48.225 --> 15:54.917
The Netherlands is one of those places where you could have a lot of hope and at the same time be very scared because you know, they're not waking up yet.

15:54.977 --> 15:59.265
They don't seem to have realized that they're like at the center of this

16:00.663 --> 16:09.534
this whole mess in the EU, and that they have one of the populations that still could pull their heads out, but don't seem to be likely to do it.

16:09.594 --> 16:18.045
This whole idea that Mark Rutte, their former prime minister, is now the head of NATO, it's this remarkable place where we are.

16:19.447 --> 16:44.850
And so it is it is sometimes, you know, maybe almost a little refreshing to come back to the biology and try to think about How we can still if we stay focused We can still try to rescue our friends and family from this trap And the trap is that there's something real happening in America right now that there's something that we've got to go protest There's something that we've got to organize around and all of this

16:46.195 --> 16:57.893
this illusion is sustained because of what we do with our phones and because sometimes some of us are doing it on a computer too but the vast majority of Americans are doing it on their phone which is an extraordinary

17:01.246 --> 17:05.229
It's an extraordinary situation where only that sound really makes any sense.

17:05.349 --> 17:08.771
And so there is, we are in a red alert situation.

17:08.791 --> 17:13.855
There is a fake anti-vax movement, a fake health freedom movement in America.

17:14.595 --> 17:20.039
And in actuality, probably in many other countries around the world, like the UK or even the Netherlands.

17:22.842 --> 17:33.837
And so the question is, how many countries in the Western world were already essentially providing remnants, a remnant stream, and how many of them are also now, in a new way,

17:35.202 --> 17:45.175
producing a remnant stream that they never did before the pandemic under the pretense that again, PCR is a reliable gold standard diagnostic.

17:45.296 --> 17:52.725
I'm not really sure that there's any country in the world that has made any useful resistance to that proposition.

17:53.946 --> 18:01.751
And one might even predict that it's going to be said that the FDA of America is the whole reason why everybody has approved it.

18:01.811 --> 18:07.234
Everybody just kind of assumes that if the FDA says it's okay or isn't going to step in, then why would we?

18:09.059 --> 18:11.780
I think there's something in the EU called the EMA.

18:11.860 --> 18:24.604
I don't think they're thinking at all about reconsidering the possibility that PCR as a diagnostic in general might be assumed to be a lot more accurate than it is.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.345
And that, you know, maybe we should be careful with that.

18:29.865 --> 18:32.406
We're not even gonna approach that at all.

18:32.426 --> 18:36.067
And the reason why is because that testing regime

18:37.011 --> 19:02.549
that Mary Talley Bowden was fully supportive of when she came on my show in 2022, that Kevin McKernan was fully supportive of when he wrote the review with Claire Craig and Mike Yeadon and who else is on that, and Thomas Binder, where they all speak out about the PCR test as being inappropriately designed and inappropriately peer reviewed and maybe producing primer dimers.

19:02.589 --> 19:04.470
So it's not the perfect methodology.

19:06.309 --> 19:13.034
But in no way, shape, or form are they objecting to the existence of the virus, the tracking of the virus, or the sequencing of the virus.

19:16.597 --> 19:32.690
And now we are still at a point where, again, there are tests all over the world and every hospital in the world, as far as I know, but certainly in America, that are used to test for more than 10 virus signals at a time.

19:34.155 --> 19:42.660
This is unprecedented, and it is only possible because, essentially, a shell game has been played where this occurred.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.761
We didn't do this before 2020.

19:44.901 --> 19:47.223
We didn't do this before 2020.

19:48.463 --> 19:50.104
We didn't do this before 2020.

19:55.888 --> 20:03.012
And the electronic medical records of our young people, of people on insurance, of people on Obamacare,

20:03.888 --> 20:09.377
The electronic medical records are available for the first time.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.782
I mean, 20 years ago, electronic medical records, what?

20:13.544 --> 20:14.886
Maybe the military had them.

20:16.949 --> 20:17.730
But not us.

20:19.946 --> 20:37.527
And so now that there is a preponderance of average citizens on electronic medical record databases like Epic, now that the vast majority of college age kids have been forced in one way or another because of the requirement to have insurance when you go to college,

20:38.971 --> 20:53.396
that they're also on an electronic medical record, that this whole process of trying to figure out if it's possible that we can read a phenotype, see a phenotype, see the signal in genetics, how much of an interface can we do there?

20:53.436 --> 20:57.077
How much of a, you know, matching these with those can we do?

20:57.157 --> 21:01.939
Now remember, this is a different task than solving the game of Go.

21:02.019 --> 21:04.560
It's a different task than solving the game of chess.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.381
And so there had to be iterations of this.

21:08.325 --> 21:11.027
There had to be simpler iterations of this.

21:11.627 --> 21:15.030
And those simpler iterations are probably hidden, way hidden.

21:16.687 --> 21:17.927
And we don't know when they did it.

21:17.967 --> 21:26.370
Did they do it with AIDS and homosexuality as a possibility of trying to look for gay genes without telling you?

21:26.870 --> 21:30.671
Did they do it in Nevada with this baby doctor?

21:30.731 --> 21:34.932
Because that of course creates a very interesting situation.

21:34.952 --> 21:37.153
I don't know if we should maybe just do it here.

21:37.173 --> 21:39.594
I don't know why I feel like doing it here, but I feel like doing it here.

21:40.054 --> 21:41.474
It's a dude, right?

21:41.554 --> 21:43.735
Who apparently through his fertility clinic

21:45.255 --> 21:52.257
inseminated a bunch of women by putting his sperm in also as a chaser to help the dad's sperm go.

21:52.317 --> 22:03.880
And so maybe sometimes there was a successful fertilization, but I think if they looked into all these people and found out that it was always his Y chromosome, you couldn't really say that he was putting a chaser in there.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.461
He was just putting his own sperm in.

22:05.981 --> 22:06.821
So what does that do?

22:09.203 --> 22:18.767
Maybe I'm just going to let the chat do a little bit here, or I don't know if you want to, but so we have a certain number of chromosomes, right?

22:23.869 --> 22:30.112
So we have a certain number of chromosomes, and maybe I should use a pen so you can see it better.

22:32.020 --> 22:36.124
I like to use pencil, to be honest, but I don't mind.

22:36.144 --> 22:39.587
I mean, it's just can't fix it, right?

22:40.087 --> 22:41.869
So we have a number of chromosomes.

22:45.552 --> 22:48.515
And we don't need to really think about how many, how many there are.

22:48.575 --> 22:57.263
What you need to think about it is, is that you always get, you always get one from your mom and you get one from your dad.

23:04.679 --> 23:08.862
And with regard to the sex chromosomes, so we have pairs of chromosomes, right?

23:08.882 --> 23:12.344
Because our gametes are supposedly haploid.

23:13.144 --> 23:15.146
They have half the number of chromosomes.

23:16.126 --> 23:21.350
And the gametes then fuse and become a diploid organism.

23:21.390 --> 23:25.933
And that diploid is the two chromosomes, the copies of each.

23:26.758 --> 23:45.238
And so one of the things that is very perplexing to understand from the perspective of genetics is that they know for sure that in any given organism it is very likely that most of the cells are mosaically expressing these chromosomes, but one chromosome is always dormant.

23:46.155 --> 23:51.218
And now these are all things that I'm still regurgitating that I've been taught.

23:51.498 --> 23:59.762
And so some of these things I'm still in the process of checking myself and trying to understand what they know and what they don't know about chromosomes.

23:59.802 --> 24:06.465
And so I apologize ahead of time if some of this stuff is a little off base in a few weeks and I come back and correct it.

24:06.505 --> 24:11.548
But for now, I just want to work through the idea that chromosomes are this because

24:12.509 --> 24:17.511
In the context of the 50s and the 60s and the 70s, that is the working assumption.

24:17.571 --> 24:18.912
That is what people think.

24:19.372 --> 24:25.275
That is how people are dissecting the challenge of looking at genetics.

24:26.303 --> 24:32.968
And so if we just do it with letters, okay, and I'm just going to make up chromosome letters so that we just make a model here.

24:33.408 --> 24:38.352
This is how you either become, right, a woman or a man, for example.

24:38.412 --> 24:46.518
And that's why they have this whole debate right now is going to try and get you to argue that sex is determined by chromosomes.

24:46.979 --> 24:52.943
And it's just whether you get a Y or an X from your dad, because you're always going to get an X from your mom.

24:52.983 --> 24:55.065
And I'm not arguing with this preposition.

24:56.637 --> 25:01.181
It seems to be, as far as I can tell, there's a lot of biology to support this idea.

25:01.261 --> 25:13.731
But then, let's go to the logical conclusion here, and that is that for each of the chromosomes that dad and mom have, it is an assortment thing where you get one or the other.

25:13.791 --> 25:20.797
And so, mom and dad might have a chromosome, let's use letters, okay, and I'm going to start in the

25:21.497 --> 25:43.286
in the middle with M and then we're just going to have five chromosomes so you have an M and an M and an N and an N and an O and an O and a P and a P and a Q and a Q. Okay and so then every person would have five chromosomes and then plus the you're either a man or a woman in this case he's a man

25:43.886 --> 25:56.776
Now, the problem with this is, of course, is how do you start thinking about, you know, what what's carried and where are the genes and how do we how do we do a genetic experiment in humans?

25:57.897 --> 26:09.926
Well, the way, in my humble opinion, one of the lowest hanging fruits to do an experiment in humans, especially because of the size of the chromosome, would be to look at the Y chromosome.

26:11.465 --> 26:15.410
And so what's interesting is it doesn't matter what all these other chromosomes are.

26:15.891 --> 26:18.454
You can just leave those as blanks because you know what?

26:19.416 --> 26:25.564
All of these kids that that guy fathered have this genotype.

26:26.926 --> 26:27.166
That Y.

26:28.496 --> 26:34.399
Their X is all going to be different because they all had different moms and the moms can give two different X chromosomes.

26:34.999 --> 26:37.960
But they're all going to have this Y chromosome.

26:37.980 --> 26:53.087
That's a very, very, very, very, very interesting phenomenon because the sisters will also have specifically one X chromosome that will be the same because he can only give one.

26:53.147 --> 26:55.128
He's only got one X chromosome.

26:55.148 --> 26:56.489
You see, that's how males work.

26:57.580 --> 27:06.705
And so now you have perhaps the only low-hanging genetic experimental fruit available in terms of breeding humans.

27:07.305 --> 27:23.174
If you could do a breeding experiment, you wouldn't gain very much by having a woman be the mom of the same kids, because the X chromosome that those kids will still be one or the other, which means you're still creating two groups, but not as many.

27:23.214 --> 27:25.495
It's not as homogenous of an experiment.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.322
Not only that, but that woman's got to give birth to a bunch of babies.

27:29.362 --> 27:38.549
Whereas this guy, you know, it could be thousands of babies that are either sharing a Y chromosome or sharing an X chromosome.

27:38.969 --> 27:39.950
That's pretty handy.

27:40.430 --> 27:44.213
As far as I can tell, that's a pretty interesting experiment.

27:45.293 --> 27:55.921
Because any patterns that emerge in the boys or patterns that emerge in the girls could potentially be connected to this shared genotype.

27:57.233 --> 28:00.075
As far as we know, what else are you going to do?

28:00.095 --> 28:03.118
Are you going to have a Mormon family submit all their genetic data?

28:03.138 --> 28:06.100
Are you going to have a bunch of Arab families submit their genetic data?

28:06.120 --> 28:09.603
What, are you going to go to Israel and study the Bedouins or something like that?

28:09.663 --> 28:10.564
Or these other people?

28:11.905 --> 28:12.305
I don't know.

28:14.106 --> 28:15.888
Anyway, is there a third possibility?

28:15.948 --> 28:16.428
Type it out.

28:18.749 --> 28:20.991
I mean, I'm not saying that that's what they did it for.

28:21.031 --> 28:23.993
I'm saying that that's kind of the possibility here.

28:24.053 --> 28:27.176
That's one of the lowest hanging fruits.

28:27.236 --> 28:37.324
Remember, again, thinking about how they thought about biology in the 50s and the 60s, this would have been within their grasp.

28:37.965 --> 28:38.845
Let's say it like that.

28:39.786 --> 28:44.170
Go ahead and type it in, SolarFire, if you, or maybe you're not talking about this.

28:44.230 --> 28:45.431
Maybe you're talking about something else.

28:47.046 --> 29:01.535
So yes, they are going to, they are intentionally intending to try and take genetic data and interface it with electronic medical records to try and use machine learning

29:02.415 --> 29:04.917
to get farther with our understanding of the genome.

29:05.037 --> 29:09.760
I don't think they can predict what their potential results will be.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.181
They just hope it'll be something useful.

29:12.982 --> 29:23.128
And it's incredible because in this BBC article from two days ago, it comes after a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies.

29:23.148 --> 29:23.648
That sounds a lot

29:27.142 --> 29:32.983
like what Claire Craig was working on when she was working on the 100,000 Genomes Project before the pandemic.

29:33.043 --> 29:37.804
It would be very curious to see if she's on that paper.

29:38.264 --> 29:40.565
I couldn't find it yet, so I'm still working on that.

29:41.445 --> 29:50.707
And so we also see this paper, which is just crazy because it has Steve Hatfill, Tess Laurie, Robert Malone, Jessica Rose,

29:53.049 --> 29:58.913
Harvey Reich, it's Norman Fenton, it's nuts.

29:58.993 --> 30:04.656
And this paper says the entire narrative, including, of course, that endemicity has occurred.

30:04.696 --> 30:06.297
Essentially, it's there forever now.

30:06.778 --> 30:07.698
And this is the myth.

30:07.778 --> 30:15.023
This is the foundational myth of virology that just doesn't really make any biological sense.

30:16.743 --> 30:21.845
As far as this group of people goes, I think the most incriminating, again, picture is here.

30:22.385 --> 30:28.107
Probably the reason why they did this whole thing in Romania is something to do with NATO.

30:29.307 --> 30:39.651
I don't know exactly, but it's also maybe so that they could talk to Denny Rancourt and make him feel really important in a place where it didn't matter, and make sure that they kept him on narrative, make sure that they could brief him about me.

30:40.692 --> 30:45.197
and that he could effectively not talk about the fact that there is a population pyramid.

30:46.358 --> 30:50.783
And it takes their commitment, their commitment to these lies.

30:50.823 --> 30:52.205
That's all that's really required.

30:52.325 --> 30:53.987
I don't know why this is doing that right now.

30:54.007 --> 30:54.928
Am I supposed to be here?

30:56.370 --> 30:57.191
Oh yeah, great.

31:08.760 --> 31:23.490
So you may not be aware, but Scott Shar's case ended and the jury sided with Ascension Medical, whatever it is, the hospital corporation in Wisconsin.

31:24.591 --> 31:31.976
And so after the trial, his lawyer, Mendenhall, has been on some social media saying, yeah, I know it sucks.

31:32.836 --> 31:36.939
And now he's going to be interviewed or was interviewed very recently by Mary Holland.

31:36.959 --> 31:37.980
So I'm going to play that now.

31:38.960 --> 31:45.825
And try to give an objective analysis of what's going on and try to not be as emotional as I was earlier.

31:47.166 --> 31:51.169
It's hard because I'm not optimistic right now.

31:52.170 --> 31:57.434
Other than if people can finally accept that something is wrong.

31:58.054 --> 31:59.795
Something feels crazy about this.

32:02.597 --> 32:05.940
And I will turn down my mic so that you don't hear that blower in the background.

32:21.547 --> 32:23.529
Good morning, Children's Health Defense.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.672
Today is Monday, June 23rd, 2025.

32:26.712 --> 32:36.081
And I'm delighted to have as our first guest, Scott Shara, father of Grace Shara, who died in a hospital.

32:36.181 --> 32:40.505
And we're here to talk about the jury's decision in the trial that concluded last week.

32:44.195 --> 32:44.675
So there you go.

32:44.696 --> 32:49.100
You're going to start out right away the interview with not using the word murder.

32:50.201 --> 32:56.246
Died in a hospital is what she said, which is an extraordinary thing to say now that the case is over with.

32:56.286 --> 32:57.267
What do they got to lose?

32:57.347 --> 33:03.213
I mean, finding in favor of the defendants, the doctors, nurses and hospitals across the board.

33:04.308 --> 33:14.294
We're also going to be followed by my interview with Dr. Rainer Fulmich's lawyer Katja Vermer and interpreter Masha Orel.

33:15.694 --> 33:23.599
Rainer Fulmich has been an advocate about COVID, a very important one in Germany and is currently in prison.

33:25.341 --> 33:33.811
So again, I just want to emphasize that the lack of specificity of message, of content, of knowledge, there's none.

33:34.810 --> 33:38.531
He was an outspoken advocate during COVID or something like that, she said.

33:39.932 --> 33:42.552
So we're looking for specifics here.

33:42.752 --> 33:57.457
After 15 odd years of being the head of this movement, at the head of the health freedom movement in America, this woman has made an extraordinary lack of progress seem like success.

33:57.697 --> 33:59.998
And I think that illusion needs to be broken.

34:00.518 --> 34:05.781
Otherwise, America's children will be enslaved by these people.

34:05.861 --> 34:11.884
These people are a useless bunch, and they're a useless bunch because they don't accomplish anything.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.185
They don't have a message.

34:13.705 --> 34:19.728
Their message remains as ambiguous as it was in Georgia two years ago.

34:19.828 --> 34:24.110
Rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.303
followed by a segment of Mothers to Be.

34:32.764 --> 34:39.071
So I'm excited about the program and really delighted to welcome Scott Shara back to CHG TV.

34:39.192 --> 34:40.713
Scott, thank you for coming.

34:41.655 --> 34:42.656
Glad to be here.

34:54.855 --> 34:57.257
Tell us what happened, Scott, briefly.

34:57.958 --> 34:59.859
We all were watching the trial.

34:59.939 --> 35:02.201
We covered it here on CHD TV.

35:02.261 --> 35:22.318
There were some extraordinary segments showing your experts and showing comments from your lead attorney, Warner Mendenhall, that suggested to many of us that, in fact, the jury would find that there had been medical battery, wrongful death, lack of informed consent and illegal do not resuscitate order.

35:22.799 --> 35:26.529
And yet we understand that the jury found in favor of defendants.

35:26.549 --> 35:28.414
So tell us how that happened.

35:28.495 --> 35:29.136
What happened?

35:30.694 --> 35:34.856
Well, how, that's, I can say what, and then I'll attempt to cover how.

35:34.916 --> 35:38.858
So what happened is we had four claims.

35:39.058 --> 35:41.659
We started with five claims, four ended up going to the jury.

35:41.699 --> 35:51.923
We started with wrongful death, medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, medical battery, and a declaratory judgment for the illegal do not resuscitate order.

35:51.984 --> 35:56.946
The battery was dismissed before the case went to the jury.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.667
The illegal do not resuscitate order

36:00.188 --> 36:03.900
And yet we understand that the jury found in favor of defendants.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.806
So tell us how that happened.

36:05.866 --> 36:06.528
What happened?

36:08.066 --> 36:12.248
Well, how, that's, I can say what, and then I'll attempt to cover how.

36:12.308 --> 36:16.251
So what happened is we had four claims.

36:16.451 --> 36:19.052
We started with five claims, four ended up going to the jury.

36:19.092 --> 36:29.318
We started with wrongful death, medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, medical battery, and a declaratory judgment for the illegal do not resuscitate order.

36:29.378 --> 36:34.321
The battery was dismissed before the case went to the jury.

36:35.061 --> 36:40.748
The judge held the battery open through the entire trial because he wanted to wait for all the evidence.

36:40.908 --> 36:46.634
Ultimately, he dismissed the battery because an element of battery is consent.

36:47.175 --> 36:54.063
And he said, just by the fact that we were in the hospital, we were giving consent.

36:54.723 --> 37:10.059
And we showed on the last day, my last testimony, we showed that the consent document was even a fraud because they claim that Grace, my daughter Grace with Down syndrome, orally approved the general consent document.

37:10.439 --> 37:11.400
Think about that, Mary.

37:11.440 --> 37:18.523
That was, you know, roughly 20 minutes we're in the emergency room and they said that Grace orally approved the general consent.

37:18.563 --> 37:23.426
So obviously a fraudulent document submitted as part of the medical records after the fact.

37:23.466 --> 37:32.231
We thought that would be enough to convince the judge to keep the battery claim alive, but he said that we consented simply because of being in the hospital.

37:32.791 --> 37:34.672
big picture relative to the battery.

37:34.772 --> 37:36.714
We invested a lot of time on that.

37:36.754 --> 37:45.539
There's a number of public filings now that other attorneys can see how we pled the battery and it can be used as a model going forward.

37:46.179 --> 37:51.103
So I'm not sure how it can be used as a model going forward if they lost

37:52.759 --> 37:54.761
And the medical battery lost.

37:54.861 --> 37:58.944
I don't know how that is a a Model going forward now.

37:59.244 --> 38:20.579
I'm not a lawyer so I can't make the argument that they should have argued it was murder Because I guess murder has a number of things that you have to prove And if you the lawyer didn't think that he could prove all of those things I don't know if it's motive opportunity, you know, I watch TV shows that's how I know my law, but it's very very curious that

38:22.512 --> 38:27.455
wrongful death, medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, medical battery.

38:33.379 --> 38:40.064
I'm not sure really what the assumption is about going into the hospital other than you are going to come out alive.

38:40.204 --> 38:41.945
I don't know how you would argue that.

38:42.065 --> 38:44.007
I don't know if they argue that at all.

38:44.027 --> 38:45.568
I don't know if that's, you know, dumb.

38:46.488 --> 38:51.112
But it seems to me that the way that this has happened is that

38:52.409 --> 39:02.735
It's you by going to the hospital consented to us not resuscitating you, which is a strange contradiction in my humble opinion.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.637
We didn't come to the hospital for you to let us die.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.399
We came to the hospital for you to do everything you can to save our daughter from this.

39:10.420 --> 39:14.762
So I'm still a little confused about what really happened in the trial.

39:17.644 --> 39:20.746
And I'm a little confused by

39:22.861 --> 39:24.342
Yeah, I'm just a little confused.

39:24.943 --> 39:25.744
I'm going to keep going.

39:25.804 --> 39:28.306
It seems just as something just seems crazy to me.

39:28.446 --> 39:29.387
It feels crazy.

39:29.708 --> 39:32.911
Then the four claims that went to the jury.

39:34.387 --> 39:38.829
they sided with Ascension Hospital across the board, less one juror.

39:39.490 --> 39:44.212
So there's 12 jurors, one of them dissented, which represents 8%.

39:45.052 --> 39:48.254
And as I look at it, you said, well, how did this even happen?

39:48.294 --> 39:53.457
I mean, I thought we had a better case, certainly a better team, we're way better prepared.

39:54.277 --> 40:01.561
And so it's hard for me to grasp, sitting there in the courtroom for three weeks, working with these four attorneys for,

40:03.002 --> 40:10.710
What's strange about it is is that if it was a real jury trial, then there is some, you know, I mean, people know how to do that.

40:12.532 --> 40:22.022
People have a strategy for what they're going to try and convince the jury of they, you know, working with your lawyers, you usually have a strategy here.

40:22.863 --> 40:24.305
And it's strange to me that

40:28.652 --> 40:32.621
Yeah, this is just all coming off very, very odd to me.

40:37.291 --> 40:38.433
It's not very defeated.

40:39.739 --> 40:44.863
literally two years and intensely for a couple of months prior to the trial.

40:45.223 --> 40:45.644
So it's hard.

40:45.804 --> 40:51.148
So for two years, he's been working on it, but then a couple months intensely before the trial.

40:51.168 --> 40:54.931
So maybe it's not very much of a strategy for me to grasp losing.

40:55.071 --> 41:00.195
But, you know, in this system, this system is not designed for the plaintiff.

41:00.676 --> 41:03.318
And I'll give you a specific example of that in a moment.

41:03.398 --> 41:06.520
But, you know, what I believe is the case is that

41:07.521 --> 41:13.546
There's, if the average age of the juror, for example, is 50 years, they've got 50 years of programming.

41:13.946 --> 41:16.908
So they're programmed to trust the system.

41:16.928 --> 41:20.011
And so 8%, one juror cited for us.

41:20.211 --> 41:23.493
So you're, he's trying to say that they trusted the system.

41:23.533 --> 41:26.856
That's why he lost because the jurors trusted the system.

41:27.676 --> 41:28.457
That's weird.

41:33.041 --> 41:38.225
So it wasn't medical malpractice for doctors to use supplementary oxygen.

41:38.245 --> 41:45.511
It wasn't medical malpractice for them to use oxygen in a way that should have been general knowledge not to be used that way.

41:46.191 --> 41:53.477
It wouldn't have been medical malpractice for them to use ventilators in a way that in textbooks, it's not supposed to be used.

41:54.357 --> 41:58.580
See, this is weird because I don't think they made that argument in the trial and so that it,

41:59.488 --> 42:01.589
I don't know what the medical malpractice was then.

42:01.629 --> 42:04.310
Was the medical malpractice putting a DNR order on her?

42:04.370 --> 42:06.091
Cause that's not medical malpractice.

42:06.111 --> 42:07.912
DNR orders are a real thing.

42:08.832 --> 42:09.772
It's strange.

42:11.173 --> 42:25.079
And this is the same case that, that we had a chance to get publicity on Rogan because Mary Talley Bowden was on Rogan and she talked about it and she called it intentional euthanasia.

42:28.544 --> 42:30.466
I mean, that's not even a real term.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.688
That doesn't make any sense.

42:35.533 --> 42:36.314
And so it's weird.

42:36.334 --> 42:42.662
I don't know what law is being violated when you don't, when, what is informed consent?

42:42.762 --> 42:43.683
Is that a charge?

42:45.445 --> 42:47.288
I don't know, cause I'm not a lawyer, but it's.

42:49.011 --> 42:56.458
And medical battery, I'm not really sure what medical battery is, and I'm guessing it would have to be a specific part of the protocol that was medical battery.

42:56.959 --> 43:02.144
And I bet it didn't have anything to do with supplementary oxygen or the vent, which is weird.

43:03.365 --> 43:04.006
It's weird.

43:04.046 --> 43:12.093
It's almost like it's all about the DNR, which in the end, it might be the way that they intentionally sort of pulled the football away.

43:12.907 --> 43:13.527
lucidum.

43:14.007 --> 43:23.110
That makes sense to me logically in that is that represents the population that is awake to what is going on.

43:26.591 --> 43:37.535
I was just going to ask you have there been any interviews after the completion of the trial with any of the jurors in many cases like this one which are high profile

43:37.995 --> 43:46.279
Some of the jurors will talk to the press, the judges usually advise them not to, but they talk to the press and they say kind of what happened in the deliberations.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.821
Are you aware if that's happened at all in this case?

43:49.943 --> 43:51.004
That would be fantastic.

43:51.044 --> 43:52.405
I haven't seen that yet.

43:53.085 --> 43:55.887
I would really enjoy that type of thing to hear.

43:55.907 --> 44:03.072
I'd like to ask them questions, just objective questions to get a pulse on what was the reason.

44:05.134 --> 44:07.615
Praise God that this trial was live streamed.

44:08.276 --> 44:11.718
With the new American and CHD parents,

44:13.476 --> 44:16.358
pairing with each other to live stream this trial.

44:16.418 --> 44:21.202
It was fantastic because we accomplished the goal.

44:21.282 --> 44:28.387
At the beginning of the press conference that we had on Saturday, I started with what Grace would say.

44:28.447 --> 44:31.990
If Grace was here right now, what would she have said

44:32.590 --> 44:58.682
That morning Friday morning with the press conference and she would have said God did it dad and boy did he ever I mean to have a trial like this live stream to the nation millions of people saw it millions of people's lives will be saved if they have ears to hear because People's lives be saved if they see the trial What is that Wow I'm trying to think

45:02.588 --> 45:04.889
How would lives be saved when they see the trial?

45:04.949 --> 45:05.969
I don't get it.

45:06.029 --> 45:10.111
Are they not gonna go to a hospital anymore?

45:11.212 --> 45:12.592
They're not gonna believe in COVID.

45:12.612 --> 45:14.153
They're not gonna take a PCR test.

45:14.213 --> 45:23.577
How would lives be saved because of this trial being televised by a collaboration between the New American and CHDTV?

45:26.258 --> 45:28.179
What in the Sam hell is going on here?

45:29.451 --> 45:32.753
They saw for the first time what's going on behind the curtain.

45:33.153 --> 45:37.955
Think through this fact, and I'm putting fact in quotes.

45:37.975 --> 45:41.317
I mean, they hired experts from Johns Hopkins.

45:42.958 --> 45:48.701
These people are cutting edge in where our society is going with AI,

45:49.361 --> 45:52.904
and turning everything over to the medical industrial complex.

45:52.944 --> 46:07.096
So these experts said specifically that a doctor in a hospital setting can put a DNR on a patient without a witness and without a signature unilaterally.

46:07.837 --> 46:11.220
And so the jury accepted that, Mary.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.883
So that becomes, oh, it's hard to grasp.

46:14.943 --> 46:16.905
It's hard for those of us who followed this to

46:18.052 --> 46:19.033
You're going to cut it off.

46:19.073 --> 46:24.775
You're not going to actually say that that sets a precedence in American court.

46:28.237 --> 46:31.599
So this has nothing to do with what the protocol was.

46:31.839 --> 46:34.100
It has nothing to do with how they got there.

46:34.120 --> 46:38.522
It has to do with the DNR order and the fact that that's okay.

46:39.508 --> 46:50.456
And so it makes it seem as though anybody that would go back and look for something to find with their old family, their whatever, oh my gosh, this is crazy.

46:52.558 --> 46:54.239
The DNR was legal.

46:56.681 --> 46:56.981
Wow.

46:58.182 --> 46:58.543
Wow.

46:59.723 --> 47:00.124
Wow.

47:00.684 --> 47:02.746
I don't know what, wow, I don't know what to say.

47:05.307 --> 47:11.073
It was never even questioned about, even the medical malpractice then I guess is about the DNR.

47:11.093 --> 47:22.746
It's not about the use of supplementary oxygen when you didn't need it or not using it with good prudence and understanding of the dangers of it.

47:24.261 --> 47:36.765
I noticed that Mark Kulak posted a YouTube video or a video that he found somewhere else about the application of pure oxygen in the ICU.

47:37.265 --> 47:43.387
It's a really interesting video that certainly doesn't say that 60 liters a minute of pure oxygen is a great idea.

47:43.407 --> 47:45.588
I mean,

47:47.657 --> 47:51.621
This is a very, very important, crucial time right now to see.

47:52.261 --> 47:54.383
Something doesn't make sense.

47:54.483 --> 47:56.946
Something feels crazy about this because

48:00.802 --> 48:13.090
grasp how the jury could have come to the conclusion that it is acceptable for a doctor to put a DNR on a patient when the parents and the sister are immediately available.

48:13.870 --> 48:16.332
Honestly, Scott, it shocks my conscience.

48:16.392 --> 48:17.032
It really does.

48:17.112 --> 48:28.740
It's shocking to me how the jury reached this conclusion based on this really outstanding set of facts that were presented in front of them and really competent counsel.

48:29.560 --> 48:32.023
I can't quite grasp it to be honest with you.

48:36.388 --> 48:41.373
Amazing set of facts presented by an extremely competent counsel.

48:41.413 --> 48:41.654
I mean,

48:47.583 --> 48:54.568
But you're right that maybe the bigger win is in terms of public opinion and having live streamed it.

48:54.628 --> 48:59.492
You're right that millions of people will see sections of this through social media.

48:59.632 --> 49:05.136
Millions of people, really millions of people are seeing it on the New American and CHD.

49:06.457 --> 49:07.698
Millions of people.

49:10.399 --> 49:13.302
I mean, are they just bamboozling him?

49:15.603 --> 49:16.444
Is that just a hope?

49:17.585 --> 49:19.707
What are they talking about, millions of people?

49:21.389 --> 49:31.059
The most visibility he got was Mary Talley Bowden on Joe Rogan and she blew it by calling it intentional euthanasia.

49:32.660 --> 49:35.103
They have not used the word murder yet.

49:40.268 --> 49:40.989
It's remarkable.

49:42.088 --> 49:42.950
It's remarkable.

49:43.090 --> 49:53.207
Social media will come to New America and our children's health defense TV and see the whole thing and understand that the system is just extraordinarily broken.

49:55.219 --> 50:00.961
The clip that's up right now is Dr. Burdine and he really laid it out.

50:00.981 --> 50:05.422
I mean, Dr. Burdine, this was the first plaintiff's case he ever testified in.

50:06.063 --> 50:08.023
He had always worked for the defendant in the past.

50:08.503 --> 50:10.644
He did not take a nickel personally.

50:10.984 --> 50:17.046
He bills through Texas Tech University where he works.

50:17.086 --> 50:21.368
So the invoices that I received were through that organization.

50:21.428 --> 50:22.808
He doesn't take anything personally.

50:23.228 --> 50:24.369
And he also chose

50:24.989 --> 50:32.053
that his $350 an hour billing rate when he would be working on the case full days, he would just charge $350 a day.

50:32.093 --> 50:36.296
So he would only charge for one hour even though he's working a whole day on the case.

50:36.916 --> 50:43.040
And he said bluntly at the trial, it was the most powerful piece of the trial in my opinion, he said that

50:43.720 --> 50:58.128
When Dr. Shokar gave Grace morphine, when she didn't have a pulse or a blood pressure, was the single most egregious act that he's ever seen in 46 years of experience.

50:59.168 --> 51:00.749
Scott, I saw that.

51:00.829 --> 51:05.291
When she didn't have a pulse and she wasn't breathing, he gave her morphine.

51:05.331 --> 51:08.393
That sounds like euthanasia, like in the sense of

51:11.415 --> 51:12.335
She's gonna die.

51:12.435 --> 51:13.216
She's dying.

51:13.336 --> 51:40.005
So I might as well make sure that she doesn't die in pain Why are we starting there at the more that's the single worst thing that that guy found was the morphine but he didn't that's not Explanatory for how she got to the point where she wasn't breathing and someone could give her morphine It's really crazy, I don't I don't know what to say I

51:41.488 --> 51:44.270
Something feels so concocted here.

51:47.152 --> 52:08.765
And I don't know if... It doesn't feel like... It doesn't feel like the prayers were answered here.

52:11.252 --> 52:12.433
I don't know what's going on.

52:12.453 --> 52:13.654
This is strange.

52:14.355 --> 52:17.217
I posted that to my social media account.

52:17.277 --> 52:28.086
It's extraordinary that that doctor had never testified on behalf of a plaintiff against the medical system ever and did so and basically said what occurred.

52:28.516 --> 52:31.778
was egregious beyond anything he'd ever seen.

52:32.259 --> 52:42.265
So it's so hard for me to get my head around how the jury really didn't heed that, that this was absolutely egregious practice.

52:58.716 --> 53:14.422
of claims that they made, the ones that went to trial, and why or why not you couldn't have approached this from the perspective of murder because you don't bring your kid to the hospital except for them to live.

53:14.682 --> 53:19.864
And so if you go into the hospital and they started right away doing things that are

53:22.708 --> 53:39.075
easily demonstratable as toxic, as dangerous, as incongruent with standards in a hospital or an intensive care unit or an emergency care, then I think that would have been the angle to go on.

53:39.115 --> 53:41.055
That's the angle I thought they were going on.

53:41.095 --> 53:43.236
That's the whole thing, right?

53:43.356 --> 53:47.498
I mean, we didn't hear anything about anything except for a DNR order.

53:49.619 --> 53:52.420
And now we're hearing about morphine when she wasn't breathing.

53:53.380 --> 53:54.441
this was not medicine.

53:55.442 --> 54:00.206
I'm hopeful you will get to hear from some of the jurors after the fact.

54:00.226 --> 54:06.030
I mean, oxygen is not medicine is a perfect thing for them to have started with.

54:06.291 --> 54:07.872
Oxygen is not medicine.

54:10.598 --> 54:19.105
And so they were actually bamboozled by the FLCCC protocol that said at 96% oxygen you better go seek help.

54:19.625 --> 54:21.066
He said it in this interview.

54:21.106 --> 54:23.768
That's the reason why he found himself at the hospital.

54:24.389 --> 54:26.731
Because the FLCC told him to go there.

54:28.552 --> 54:39.281
Maybe he should have been suing the FLCCC for recommending to go there because the dumbass hospital was going to give them supplementary oxygen in an inappropriate way, but they didn't address any of this.

54:41.391 --> 54:44.854
It's almost like it was a murder that isn't investigated.

54:46.275 --> 54:48.456
It's a death being investigated, right?

54:48.616 --> 54:54.000
It's a died in the hospital being investigated, not a murder being investigated, right?

54:56.022 --> 54:57.383
That's the whole crazy part.

54:58.323 --> 55:02.326
If somebody dies at a, this is just coming to my head right now.

55:02.406 --> 55:04.288
If somebody dies at an amusement park,

55:05.939 --> 55:11.406
And you find out that they collapsed at the concession stand, and they had just finished eating a hot dog.

55:11.806 --> 55:13.549
You might investigate the hot dog.

55:14.129 --> 55:16.152
You might investigate what they had for breakfast.

55:16.192 --> 55:23.221
You might investigate who they slept with the night before, or what they drank at the hospital, or sorry, at the hotel breakfast.

55:27.042 --> 55:35.049
Like there's lots of things to look at and you wouldn't start with the, well, yeah, but you know, he died at the hot dog stand.

55:35.109 --> 55:39.412
So I guess the hot dog killed him and the hot dog was legal because he paid for it.

55:39.492 --> 55:40.433
So that's it, right?

55:40.473 --> 55:40.854
That's it.

55:42.815 --> 55:43.436
That's the end of it.

55:43.996 --> 55:44.677
I don't know what to say.

55:44.917 --> 55:49.481
No more can be thought about here because nobody's at fault, you know?

55:50.322 --> 55:51.823
Nobody's at fault.

55:51.884 --> 55:59.571
No doctor should be responsible to know that you can't just give oxygen to somebody because their pulse ox is low.

55:59.691 --> 56:01.273
No doctor should need to know that.

56:01.753 --> 56:05.377
No nurses should have had the requisite knowledge to question that.

56:05.857 --> 56:07.439
It's just in a few textbooks.

56:07.519 --> 56:09.020
It's just in a few papers.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.622
It's just in a few videos.

56:12.335 --> 56:18.938
And yet we haven't talked about anything to do with anything to do with the protocol, which would have been what malpractice might've been.

56:19.018 --> 56:25.681
Like, you know, a shithead doctor that was injecting people with his own sperm, you know, he knows what's gonna happen.

56:27.062 --> 56:40.849
A doctor worth their license, a doctor worth their training should have known that you don't just give somebody pure oxygen through a face mask, that you don't just ventilate somebody who can talk.

56:42.912 --> 56:45.373
You gotta start with the basic bullshit.

56:45.413 --> 57:05.119
You can't start with her on a vent and say that the do not resuscitate order was not fair, that that's not informed consent, that that's not, that's exactly how they avoid saying murder and accusing the hospital of murder or manslaughter.

57:06.616 --> 57:08.758
How come manslaughter's not on here?

57:08.818 --> 57:10.260
What does wrongful death mean?

57:10.300 --> 57:11.721
I need to know all this stuff.

57:12.142 --> 57:17.928
But I'm frustrated because I think there's something crazy going on here.

57:18.208 --> 57:18.609
Dang it.

57:18.929 --> 57:23.814
Because I think it is important to understand what was going through their heads.

57:24.795 --> 57:25.456
Well, I agree.

57:26.747 --> 57:29.109
I mean, I'd love to have them on my podcast.

57:29.149 --> 57:30.770
We could get them on CHD.

57:30.890 --> 57:32.731
I mean, it would be fantastic.

57:32.771 --> 57:38.674
I'd love to have that happen in a public forum so that we could just- Okay, so that's good.

57:38.714 --> 57:39.175
That's good.

57:39.215 --> 57:44.698
There's some help there in the chat that you don't accuse people of murder and go to a civil trial.

57:44.738 --> 57:47.900
If this was a civil trial, then okay, that's a total different thing.

57:47.960 --> 57:53.504
Again, I need to figure this out, but I'm frustrated because something doesn't feel right.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.225
One of the things that happened

57:56.305 --> 57:59.289
I thought the judge, I really thought he did a great job.

57:59.329 --> 58:02.694
His sense of humor was really neat to the trial.

58:03.996 --> 58:10.746
But the one thing that he did, which you asked me, how could the jury have come to this conclusion?

58:12.654 --> 58:19.136
As you are well aware, there's a lot of pre-trial motions, and I'll call them pre-trial shenanigans.

58:19.796 --> 58:22.596
And one of those pre-trial motions are motions in limine.

58:23.096 --> 58:33.979
And in motions in limine, what you're doing is you're narrowing the case so that evidence that's not related to the case doesn't come into the trial.

58:34.799 --> 58:42.565
And in our case, we only filed motions in limine relative to the things that I've been researching post-trial.

58:43.226 --> 58:47.669
So when I walked into that hospital with Grace, obviously, I was not awake.

58:47.729 --> 58:51.753
If I was, I would have never taken Grace to the hospital because she was not short of breath.

58:52.333 --> 58:56.877
We were fixated on the pulse oximeter, and that's why I took her to the hospital.

58:57.297 --> 58:59.839
But if I would have been awake, Grace would be alive today.

59:00.259 --> 59:02.521
So the things that I have researched, I mean, I...

59:03.502 --> 59:28.631
think you could go so far as to say that if you went to the hospital and you said that my pulse oximeter says my pulse ox is 94 with a with a mask on and a doctor and you said to the doctor can you put me on oxygen can you help me I need something and the doctor didn't say dumbass take the mask off go out in the fresh air relax we're not gonna give you oxygen

59:31.172 --> 59:32.313
Then we have a problem.

59:32.493 --> 59:46.905
You see, then we have a real problem with the people that were in the hospitals at that time, because according to everything that I can find, according to everything that I can find to read, this was in textbooks.

59:49.027 --> 59:50.548
Pure oxygen is toxic.

59:51.809 --> 59:56.493
Up to 80% pure oxygen is pretty close to the same level of toxic.

59:57.474 --> 59:58.474
And so its use,

59:59.443 --> 01:00:09.825
must be very short in duration and very carefully monitored for the potential toxicity that is generated by pure oxygen and its administration.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:20.587
It is absurd because the partial pressures of oxygen in the blood are important to maintain for proper travel of all the other things.

01:00:20.627 --> 01:00:24.068
This is not a simple little thing.

01:00:25.882 --> 01:00:27.786
Pulse ox low, give him oxygen.

01:00:28.186 --> 01:00:29.569
That's not how that works.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:35.820
And they have decades of experience with this because at first that's what people thought.

01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:46.288
I've become a full-time researcher and advocate in public speaking since Grace's death.

01:00:46.348 --> 01:00:47.909
I have 4,000 hours of research.

01:00:48.429 --> 01:00:53.211
So what we wanted to do... 4,000 hours of research.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:58.394
He's catching up to people like Matt Crawford and Charles Rixey and Matt Erett.

01:01:01.155 --> 01:01:04.797
Is he also building an archive on his website of all the materials?

01:01:06.197 --> 01:01:07.038
Because if he is,

01:01:14.145 --> 01:01:16.887
is to not have that research come into the trial.

01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:26.893
During my depositions, of course, they pounded those, they attempted to pound me with me sharing the research, which I did.

01:01:26.953 --> 01:01:29.635
I just openly shared it with them during depositions.

01:01:31.276 --> 01:01:36.879
And so the, during depositions, he shared his research about what?

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.441
About oxygen toxicity?

01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:47.070
about over ventilation, about ARDS correlating with those two things, about research, about what?

01:01:51.953 --> 01:02:00.178
And unfortunately, the judge did not entertain our motions in limine to not have that stuff come into trial.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.318
So it did come into trial.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:03.740
And did that influence the jury?

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:10.044
It probably did because the jury, to the extent that they're not awake, they're not going to understand

01:02:10.652 --> 01:02:18.981
that we only have 4.2% of the world's population, but consume 45% of the world's pharmaceuticals, 5 billion prescriptions a year.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:22.364
We're a country that's hooked on big pharma.

01:02:23.245 --> 01:02:27.069
They do not understand that hospitals have become state actors.

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:29.251
All this stuff came into the trial.

01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.233
It came into the trial about the incentives

01:02:31.954 --> 01:02:38.136
that the government had during COVID for ventilators, toxalizumab, remdesivir, all that came into the trial.

01:02:38.656 --> 01:02:46.678
And even though I presented it objectively, this was the first time I believe many of those jurors had heard any of this.

01:02:47.098 --> 01:02:49.518
I think that was part of it.

01:02:49.538 --> 01:02:55.960
Oh, so all of his research came in and essentially he discredited himself.

01:02:57.591 --> 01:03:04.395
He discredited himself by talking about New World Order, and they want to kill you, and maybe whatever else he said.

01:03:04.455 --> 01:03:08.658
I mean, that sounds kind of like what happened here.

01:03:10.139 --> 01:03:16.943
When he came to my live, live event, and I invited him, I said he could speak.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:19.405
He spoke for a long time.

01:03:19.485 --> 01:03:25.589
And at the end of his talk, he showed a video about a cartoon that looked a lot like South Park.

01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:27.297
about Satan.

01:03:28.718 --> 01:03:30.839
And I was pretty surprised by that.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:40.604
Also at that thing, there were a whole camera crew of people showed up to record the event, and I didn't know who they were.

01:03:40.824 --> 01:03:51.229
And in fact, when we ended the live stream event, and we got all the food out, which my wife had worked on multiple days over the weekend, and it was

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:52.890
Amazing.

01:03:54.351 --> 01:04:06.518
Those guys packed up and left so quickly that they left a whole bag of camera equipment that included like $1,000 super zoom lens, autofocus lens for Nikon cameras.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.362
I don't know what to say other than that's what happened.

01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:33.731
There was no room for Joe Marshall to come up on stage and speak, no real time for Mark Kulak to come up on stage because by the time the whole presentation was done and the movie was shown and then the questions were asked, we had run out of time in the community center.

01:04:33.771 --> 01:04:35.914
We didn't have time to eat, we still had to clean it up.

01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:45.696
And so I had to make like a managerial decision and just say, I'm sorry, Mark, but we're not even going to be, I'm not even going to do anything like we don't have time.

01:04:46.637 --> 01:04:53.424
And so I think that Mark and Joe were even a little disappointed that, you know, they traveled all that way and, and, and.

01:04:54.407 --> 01:05:18.958
Came all the way here and and then you know, they didn't even get to get on stage So I still feel strange about the the live live event I still feel very bizarre about it, and I'm still considering the possibility of doing another live live event After July of this year, maybe in August or September and have it be a live live event where everybody just brings their lawn chair and

01:05:19.859 --> 01:05:31.003
And we do it in the backyard and I'll have like a screen outside or something so that live stream can be seen And heard and then we just like have a spontaneous barbecue or something like that.

01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:44.507
I don't know I Know that that big Mike won't like that, but you know, we'll have to listen to him bark the whole time That's because that's what he does He's he's a little nutcase Scott.

01:05:44.547 --> 01:05:45.308
What's next?

01:05:45.668 --> 01:05:49.169
What's next for you and the legal team on Grace's case?

01:05:49.189 --> 01:05:49.209
I

01:05:49.685 --> 01:05:52.206
or just in general, not necessarily the legal team.

01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:52.806
What's next?

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:58.247
Because you've been so devoted to grace and to her memory and to educating the public.

01:05:58.627 --> 01:05:59.287
What's next?

01:06:00.507 --> 01:06:04.248
Well, that's the million dollar question that I get asked that all the time.

01:06:04.308 --> 01:06:08.309
I mean, I already know what's next unless God opens a different door.

01:06:08.609 --> 01:06:10.010
We're not going to be appealing.

01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:16.091
Well, this is awkward, Mary.

01:06:25.758 --> 01:06:27.400
Sure, I'm so sorry.

01:06:27.501 --> 01:06:40.957
We seem to have I might say that I might say that Pyrenees always are seeing something Lost the transmission for Scott Shara RC back What did you oh great?

01:06:41.578 --> 01:06:45.002
Yes, so we we lost you, but what's next Scott?

01:06:45.022 --> 01:06:45.262
Oh

01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:46.610
Okay, so what's next?

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:49.151
You know, that question gets asked regularly.

01:06:49.191 --> 01:06:52.593
I mean, and to be blunt, you know, there's no reason to appeal.

01:06:53.074 --> 01:06:56.476
We accomplished the goal that was set out with the trial.

01:06:57.076 --> 01:07:01.959
And that was, you know, we publicly, I've said many times, the goal of the trial was repentance.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.102
It was to rebuke evil and, you know, get this trial live stream.

01:07:07.142 --> 01:07:10.665
So, I mean, those with ears to hear, we did what God called us to do.

01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.886
So what's next is I'm going to pick back up.

01:07:13.326 --> 01:07:21.493
I took about three months off the last three months, not literally off, but I've been working approximately 15 hours a day with the legal team for the last three months.

01:07:21.513 --> 01:07:25.436
So I haven't done many interviews and I put all of my research on hold.

01:07:25.456 --> 01:07:31.941
So what I was working on when I took the three months off was how to escape Babylon.

01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:39.843
You know, we are in a Babylonian system, and I had just recorded the physical escape, and now I'm working on the spiritual escape.

01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:41.143
That's what I stopped working on.

01:07:41.203 --> 01:07:42.963
So that's what I'll pick up on.

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:50.685
I see, you know, my research is much bigger than what people connect the dots.

01:07:50.725 --> 01:07:53.085
They're looking, unfortunately, just at the lawsuit.

01:07:53.485 --> 01:07:55.586
But if you zoom out, you know,

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.187
the hospitals have become state actors.

01:07:59.768 --> 01:08:01.368
Okay, so now zoom out from that.

01:08:02.049 --> 01:08:02.849
How did that happen?

01:08:02.889 --> 01:08:05.851
Well, it happened through CMS controlling standards of care.

01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:06.991
Well, how did that happen?

01:08:07.432 --> 01:08:07.652
Well,

01:08:09.474 --> 01:08:17.942
When Medicaid and Medicare was passed in 1965, the idea was we are going to give free healthcare to the disabled and the elderly.

01:08:18.002 --> 01:08:19.443
Well, nothing could be further from the truth.

01:08:19.483 --> 01:08:22.807
That was all by design to set up the ration care model.

01:08:23.908 --> 01:08:31.535
And the elderly and the disabled are the first to go in this ration care model under the lie of the need for a balanced budget.

01:08:31.855 --> 01:08:33.176
So we've got a rationed care.

01:08:34.137 --> 01:08:37.461
These non-contributing members of society don't deserve medical care.

01:08:37.501 --> 01:08:42.566
That's all embedded in the culture of collectivism that is going on literally right now.

01:08:43.026 --> 01:08:47.631
And what the jury doesn't understand is every single one of the people on the jury is either.

01:08:47.651 --> 01:08:53.957
This is super strange because to say collectivism to somebody like Mary Holland who is for her whole

01:08:54.818 --> 01:09:11.616
public career basically advocated for global human rights, which is, as Joe Marshall has shown you in his book, is code for this collective idea, this global idea of one human race that needs to be governed by one technocratic government.

01:09:11.696 --> 01:09:13.318
It's, it's bizarre.

01:09:13.698 --> 01:09:14.659
It's bizarre.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:17.041
It doesn't, this something is crazy here.

01:09:17.662 --> 01:09:19.943
they're going to be disabled or elderly someday.

01:09:20.343 --> 01:09:24.706
And that's what I'm fighting for, is to expose this evil to the population.

01:09:25.706 --> 01:09:26.867
Scott, thank you so much.

01:09:27.187 --> 01:09:29.849
Our hearts go out to Grace and to you.

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:37.273
And we are so grateful for all that you've done and for bringing this trial to public attention and allowing CHD to cover it.

01:09:37.333 --> 01:09:38.653
So thank you so much.

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:39.834
Thank you, Mary.

01:09:39.874 --> 01:09:40.374
God bless you.

01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:41.215
God bless.

01:09:42.082 --> 01:09:48.290
So now we'll go on to the interview with Reiner Fulmix attorney Katja Vermeer and interpreter Masha Oral.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.751
Thank you.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.182
There's a bigger agenda driving this.

01:09:57.042 --> 01:10:02.066
OK, so if you don't know who Rainer Fulmich is, I think he's a German and an American citizen.

01:10:02.106 --> 01:10:03.367
He's got both passports.

01:10:03.407 --> 01:10:05.429
He's a lawyer in both countries, apparently.

01:10:05.449 --> 01:10:07.270
At least that's how he was represented to me.

01:10:08.131 --> 01:10:16.337
And he was one of these guys who sat on the Coronavirus Investigative Committee based in Germany with the blonde lady with the barrettes in her hair.

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:20.081
And oftentimes actually Wolfgang Wodach as well.

01:10:21.102 --> 01:10:36.180
It is even possible that these people were tasked specifically with being the front for Wolfgang Wodach, you know, to keep him in line and make sure that, you know, it never really manifested in anything useful that he would lead anything.

01:10:37.141 --> 01:11:02.858
And so I that's how I got to meet Wolfgang And I'm very grateful that I got to meet Wolfgang Wodach and in contact with him or at least was But this guy is a lawyer who apparently Would have had control over the money that was donated to the coronavirus investigative committee And may or may not have used that money to put a down payment on a house take out a loan or build a building

01:11:03.897 --> 01:11:24.190
or put a down payment on a loan to get a house or buy a house and then sold that house for a big profit and then maybe was planning on giving the money back to coronavirus investigative committee when they needed it, you know, because it's just sitting over there and I could put it to use and then I'll give it back.

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:37.254
And so right now there's apparently some reason why he was arrested in Mexico while on vacation and brought forcibly back to Germany where he spent time in jail because of this money.

01:11:38.155 --> 01:11:48.018
And so here, this is him being interviewed actually in 2022 right after and on stage with Mary Holland in Nuremberg, Germany.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:56.763
And this person is actually the head of CHD Africa, and I'm not sure what her ethnic background is.

01:11:57.424 --> 01:11:59.165
But I'm pretty sure she's not Chinese.

01:11:59.846 --> 01:12:01.947
This agenda is about life and death.

01:12:02.468 --> 01:12:05.450
Only if people understand how serious it is.

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.593
These people are trying to literally kill us.

01:12:09.468 --> 01:12:14.835
So we've just heard Mary Holland, President of Children's Health Defense, speak a powerful, rousing speech.

01:12:14.895 --> 01:12:26.751
The crowd here in Nuremberg responding to her and of course her perspective as a lawyer on the human rights aspect of Nuremberg Code and what it means for us during this episode and what we're experiencing right now during COVID-19.

01:12:27.472 --> 01:12:30.555
She closed with very powerful words, we can do it.

01:12:30.595 --> 01:12:32.336
And of course, the crowd all responding.

01:12:32.656 --> 01:12:40.863
And one of those people to whom the crowds also respond is lawyer Raina Feulmik, certainly no stranger to the health freedom movement around the world.

01:12:40.903 --> 01:12:41.504
Raina, thank you.

01:12:42.398 --> 01:13:01.042
Again, casting the spell of a health freedom movement around the world because they say it exists, it exists, it doesn't exist anywhere except for in the imagination of people that follow these not grassroots organizations, these ridiculously sabotaged organizations like CHD, ICAN, etc.

01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:02.122
You were joining us today.

01:13:02.142 --> 01:13:04.503
Hey, thank you for giving me the opportunity.

01:13:04.543 --> 01:13:05.143
It's a pleasure.

01:13:05.603 --> 01:13:10.204
So tell us Rainer, why are you here today and what is the significance of Nuremberg 75?

01:13:11.192 --> 01:13:13.374
Well, that's actually the reason why I'm here.

01:13:13.474 --> 01:13:17.356
It's the 75th anniversary of the Nuremberg Code, not the trials.

01:13:18.197 --> 01:13:27.303
And that is exactly the platform on which we need to fight this fight, on which we need to win this battle and the war.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.684
And I think this is what's happening.

01:13:28.844 --> 01:13:38.831
So maybe one of the issues here to realize now is that Reiner Fulmik is arguing that we need to use the Nuremberg Code

01:13:43.056 --> 01:13:46.760
as the legal basis for resisting the pandemic.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.764
And I don't know if that's right or wrong, but I think that's what I just heard him say.

01:13:50.844 --> 01:14:01.776
I think we should be trying to boil down what these people are saying, as long as you're not talking about Mary Holland, who's always going to be abstract, rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

01:14:02.918 --> 01:14:07.779
But this guy seems to now say that the Nuremberg Code is the basis for his objections.

01:14:08.099 --> 01:14:09.499
Mary said we are winning.

01:14:09.559 --> 01:14:11.420
We have been winning for the last two and a half years.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.720
But this is what everyone needs to understand.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.521
There are two really important outcomes.

01:14:17.761 --> 01:14:20.002
So winning looks different for different people.

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:26.123
You know, when I start the stream out with winning isn't for everyone, sometimes winning just isn't what people say it is.

01:14:27.103 --> 01:14:28.243
of the Nuremberg trials.

01:14:28.443 --> 01:14:38.226
One is informed consent, because no one must be forced to get these injections, which we don't even know what it is.

01:14:38.446 --> 01:14:39.726
They're not really vaccines.

01:14:40.286 --> 01:14:49.068
And the other very important outcome is that the defense of, I was just following orders, is not a valid one.

01:14:49.668 --> 01:14:57.371
So based on these two aspects or major outcomes, in my view, of the Nuremberg trials, we will go into battle.

01:14:58.291 --> 01:14:58.831
Absolutely.

01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:04.213
And so one of the principles you spoke about of informed consent is the law in all of our countries.

01:15:04.253 --> 01:15:05.414
We learn it as lawyers.

01:15:05.854 --> 01:15:07.435
Doctors learn it as doctors.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:13.257
And despite that, there's been this violation of informed consent by both doctors and both lawyers.

01:15:13.517 --> 01:15:16.418
How can we help them find their way back to living?

01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:21.122
So she said that she was a lawyer there, just to make sure you caught that.

01:15:21.602 --> 01:15:23.963
And yes, he said they're not really vaccines.

01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:27.184
So that's good, but it's not saying transfection.

01:15:27.244 --> 01:15:29.145
And he interviewed me, so I don't know.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:36.628
Not only did he interview me, but they interviewed me again with Wolfgang Modach and the lady with the barrettes.

01:15:38.148 --> 01:15:39.609
Being what informed consent is.

01:15:40.447 --> 01:15:44.829
I think the only way is to get all of the really relevant information out.

01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:50.492
They must understand that this is not just about the proportionality of the measures.

01:15:50.552 --> 01:15:54.794
This is not just about is it constitutional or unconstitutional.

01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:56.075
Quite obviously it's not.

01:15:56.475 --> 01:16:00.457
But they must understand that there's a bigger agenda driving this.

01:16:00.577 --> 01:16:02.718
And this agenda is about life and death.

01:16:03.298 --> 01:16:08.382
Only if people understand how serious it is, it is about their lives and deaths.

01:16:09.062 --> 01:16:12.084
Only if they understand that will they make the right choices.

01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:18.448
Up until then they'll talk about fringe issues, they will not ever address the core issue.

01:16:18.488 --> 01:16:29.035
And the core issue that there are a few people out there who are using millions of other people who they bribe or who they put under pressure or they promise them a career or something.

01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:32.698
These people are trying to literally kill us.

01:16:33.939 --> 01:16:37.221
Good morning, Children's Health Defense, wherever you are.

01:16:37.241 --> 01:16:41.143
So literally trying to kill us.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:51.550
I mean, if you're talking about managing the population pyramid, if you're talking about, you know, managing this inconvenient, imbalanced population pyramid, then I agree.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:52.771
I totally agree.

01:16:52.791 --> 01:17:00.616
I don't think they're just going to slaughter people and put them in ovens, though, because they really, really need genetic data.

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.497
They really need it.

01:17:01.577 --> 01:17:02.438
That's not a joke.

01:17:03.158 --> 01:17:13.007
And they need to transition our kids into accepting that their genetic data is just another part of their medical data, and that belongs to their insurance provider.

01:17:14.608 --> 01:17:18.811
I am so happy to have two very important guests with us today.

01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:33.381
Katja Vermeer, an attorney based in Germany, who is representing Rainer Fünnmich, who has been a friend to Children's Health Defense and an important figure in the battle against COVID and all that happened with it.

01:17:33.922 --> 01:17:41.307
And Masha Aurel, who will be interpreting for us today, and she is representing We for Humanity.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.227
Welcome, ladies.

01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.028
How are you today?

01:17:44.966 --> 01:17:46.107
I hope well.

01:17:46.947 --> 01:17:58.895
So we want to talk particularly about Rainer Völmich who is now serving a criminal sentence in a German prison.

01:17:59.455 --> 01:18:12.243
Katja, perhaps you would start and tell us what were the charges against Rainer Völmich and what was the sentence for him to be in prison?

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:17.312
In the first proceedings, it was about two credits, which amount to 700,000 euros.

01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:30.888
Okay, and how long has he been sentenced to jail for?

01:18:31.528 --> 01:18:35.230
It was, he sentenced to three years and nine months.

01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:36.430
Okay.

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:44.454
And five months of the time he so far spent in the prison are not accounted for.

01:18:45.114 --> 01:18:59.371
Okay, so he spent, correct me if I'm wrong, that he was arrested when he was traveling back from Mexico to Germany and he was put in prison and he was there for over a year, considerably over a year.

01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.791
and that's not counting towards his sentence.

01:19:02.231 --> 01:19:13.293
And he was this stealing $700,000 from his group Corona, the name of the committee, the Coronavirus Investigation Committee.

01:19:13.394 --> 01:19:17.495
Is that correct?

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:23.996
I translate quite brief.

01:19:24.036 --> 01:19:26.497
So he was not on his way to Germany.

01:19:27.884 --> 01:19:32.769
He was just kind of abducted under wrong pretext.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:39.295
And they don't blame him of theft, but rather of embezzlement.

01:19:41.437 --> 01:19:46.042
And Katya is not sure if there is something like this in the US.

01:19:46.462 --> 01:19:49.325
Yes, embezzlement is a crime in the United States.

01:19:52.535 --> 01:20:11.769
Again, I'm not a lawyer, but I think embezzlement means improper use of money from an organization that you are in control of so if you if if Mary Holland was to use money from a CHD account to buy a car

01:20:12.529 --> 01:20:17.031
for herself or to put a down payment on a house, that would be embezzlement.

01:20:18.131 --> 01:20:29.675
To, I don't know, buy stuff for other people or to lobby, I don't know if that's the same, but when you buy shit for, you just use it inappropriately, I think it's embezzlement, but again, I'm not a lawyer.

01:20:29.915 --> 01:20:35.861
He's been sentenced to, am I correct, Masha, that he was already in jail for about a year and a half?

01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:36.642
Is that right?

01:20:37.383 --> 01:20:43.509
By today, these are exactly 20 months that he's been in imprisonment.

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.350
Okay.

01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:48.475
And tell us about his conditions in prison.

01:20:48.495 --> 01:20:52.359
What have been the conditions for his imprisonment so far?

01:20:54.153 --> 01:21:19.841
Of all sudden, Rainer was moved from the prison where he's been so far to a different one and now he's enjoying in much better conditions, meaning he's allowed to talk to the other people in the prison and he is more free to call his wife, for example.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:22.862
All of this was not given in their

01:21:23.482 --> 01:21:27.446
prison where he was kept prior to indictment.

01:21:28.107 --> 01:21:32.091
So he was not allowed to talk to other people in prison.

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:35.735
He's saying indictment as indictment.

01:21:35.755 --> 01:21:42.382
He had really limited possibilities to at least communicate with his wife.

01:21:45.287 --> 01:22:05.368
Is this sentence of three years plus, is this characteristic of sentences for... So just to address Reginald Perrin in the chat, he had a bank land charge placed against his property, he got zero out of his house sale, took the money and bought gold with it.

01:22:06.949 --> 01:22:09.511
Okay, I don't know how to verify all that stuff.

01:22:09.531 --> 01:22:13.613
But later in this video, this lady is going to translate that.

01:22:14.813 --> 01:22:23.218
Let me see, I wrote it over down, down over here, that he made $1.3 million from his house sale of which he got 125,000.

01:22:23.258 --> 01:22:26.300
And the rest of that money sits in the account of one of the complainants.

01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:33.335
one of the people that brought the charges against him.

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.918
That's what she's gonna say later.

01:22:34.998 --> 01:22:38.804
So just see how that interfaces with what you're thinking there in the chat.

01:22:39.145 --> 01:22:43.131
Embezzlement, is this a typical kind of a sentence from the court?

01:22:44.765 --> 01:22:56.488
No, it is not rather typical, at least not for the first offender, which Rainer is.

01:22:57.008 --> 01:23:10.912
For the first offender it should have been much less and usually in the case like this, they would actually suspend on probation, which has not happened this time.

01:23:10.932 --> 01:23:13.353
It's rather harsh.

01:23:14.013 --> 01:23:14.974
Yes.

01:23:15.034 --> 01:23:18.655
He should have embezzled many millions.

01:23:19.616 --> 01:23:24.018
And even then, the sentences are not that harsh.

01:23:24.558 --> 01:23:24.798
Okay.

01:23:25.298 --> 01:23:35.523
So Katya, as his attorney, why do you believe he was held in such harsh conditions pre-trial?

01:23:36.124 --> 01:23:38.325
And why is his sentence so long?

01:23:39.241 --> 01:23:42.546
It is clear from inside and to the altogether 13 folders.

01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:57.642
the court has got, that it's about corona.

01:23:57.722 --> 01:24:00.283
So they refer to the corona as matter.

01:24:01.063 --> 01:24:07.125
And it is also not typical, in this case, it's just an economic offense.

01:24:07.905 --> 01:24:12.826
So it's not really typical that state security was involved.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:15.307
It's not really typical for a

01:24:16.047 --> 01:24:26.611
pure economic offense that the defender is being led to and from the court handcuffed at hands and feet.

01:24:26.992 --> 01:24:33.354
So it is obvious that political motivation is behind these proceedings.

01:24:35.715 --> 01:24:39.437
So it's interesting because she's sure it's politically motivated.

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:48.341
But it couldn't be to make him a sort of ineffective, useless victim for the resistance to discredit it.

01:24:48.361 --> 01:24:55.305
Because I haven't heard anything about the conclusions of the Coronavirus Investigative Committee.

01:24:55.345 --> 01:25:04.371
I haven't heard any elevator pitch about what he thinks other than, I guess, that it wasn't real or that this is about killing all of us.

01:25:05.872 --> 01:25:09.754
So again, you know, the Nuremberg Code and this kind of, there's a lot of,

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:25.347
lack of specificity, lack of, you know, at this point, after five years of interviewing all those people and recording all those videos, don't we have, haven't we whittled it down to something that we can, we can smack people with?

01:25:25.547 --> 01:25:27.189
It seems like we should have by now.

01:25:27.309 --> 01:25:33.355
Pachi, do you consider Rainer Funmich to be a political prisoner in Germany today?

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:35.561
Yes, absolutely.

01:25:35.581 --> 01:25:37.024
He is a political prisoner.

01:25:46.361 --> 01:26:04.935
Think about where this puts you if you were to try and talk to somebody from the perspective of the health freedom movement and say there's this guy in Germany, he's a political prisoner, while they're worried about Gaza, and they're worried about Iran, and they're worried about China, and they're worried about immigration, and they're worried about trans rights.

01:26:04.975 --> 01:26:05.976
Can you imagine

01:26:06.656 --> 01:26:14.582
how separated, how much more separated people who watch this shit could be from the rest of the United States.

01:26:15.043 --> 01:26:20.888
And those people were roped in, hook, line, and sinker, and they're still there now.

01:26:21.248 --> 01:26:21.888
It's crazy.

01:26:22.949 --> 01:26:27.973
There are, for example, doctors, medical doctors, who are still persecuted for

01:26:29.687 --> 01:26:33.228
for exemption, max exemption or vaccination exemption.

01:26:34.008 --> 01:26:39.930
Today still, some of dissidents are in prison, the same as Raina is.

01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:58.054
And the time which Raina spent in the prison so far and the conditions were absolutely disproportionate measured at what

01:26:59.216 --> 01:27:04.457
are the crimes he committed or not committed.

01:27:05.858 --> 01:27:17.500
So do you imagine, Katja, that the German government is trying to send a message with this harsh treatment of Rainer Fulmisch?

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.261
And if it is trying to send a message, what is that message?

01:27:27.418 --> 01:27:28.599
Yes, absolutely.

01:27:29.039 --> 01:27:31.820
They are trying to send a message.

01:27:32.561 --> 01:27:37.023
And the message is basically, punish one to educate thousands.

01:27:38.303 --> 01:27:47.308
And the people who were criticized on all of these corona measures, they were denigrated, they were called idiots and other names.

01:27:48.558 --> 01:28:00.851
Technically, that's not a very good translation, because, ja, natuurlijk, in Nederlands, that would mean something more like, of course, absolutely, in Nederlands would be absolute.

01:28:01.592 --> 01:28:03.053
So, it's interesting.

01:28:03.213 --> 01:28:03.494
Anyway.

01:28:04.294 --> 01:28:06.036
Right now, on his end,

01:28:06.957 --> 01:28:10.941
He showed the unlawful activities by the government.

01:28:11.742 --> 01:28:22.472
And this is, of course, another purpose behind these proceedings, to stifle him and to show others that they should not expose government.

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:43.734
One thing that I see here quite frankly is is that this puts Reiner Fulmich in terms of the CHD You know mouth breathers and and people following this at all We're not hearing about Sukhrat Bhakti at all anymore and Sukhrat Bhakti has the credibility to speak against the biological narrative much more so than

01:28:43.874 --> 01:28:53.078
than this clown does, but somehow or another CHD is so concerned about him that they're promoting a video from him from back then when they were on stage together.

01:28:53.098 --> 01:28:53.478
You see?

01:28:53.978 --> 01:28:59.980
That's where you can start to see this malevolent Lollapalooza of liars for what it is.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.701
And I'm not afraid to say it.

01:29:02.481 --> 01:29:10.165
I think the promotion of Reiner Vollmich by CHD virtually guarantees that that guy is a stuntman.

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:11.586
That's all he is.

01:29:12.386 --> 01:29:16.189
A stuntman just like Asim Malhotra is a stuntman.

01:29:16.409 --> 01:29:20.711
A stuntman just like Jessica Rose was a stuntman.

01:29:20.811 --> 01:29:25.714
Just like Peter McCullough and Pierre Kory and all of these people have become stuntmen.

01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:31.876
And they're gonna be stuntmen for the rest of their lives until they admit the whole thing was a hoax.

01:29:32.577 --> 01:29:33.917
That they participated in.

01:29:35.758 --> 01:29:37.419
As a criminal.

01:29:38.618 --> 01:29:50.543
It is easy to set people into panic by creating a virus or by creating the illusion of there being a dangerous virus out there, because everyone is concerned about their health, obviously.

01:29:50.703 --> 01:30:01.928
So the problem is that there's a specific way or a specific means by which the illusion could be created, a specific set of circumstances that exist that would allow the illusion to be created.

01:30:01.968 --> 01:30:03.629
And that illusion has details.

01:30:04.269 --> 01:30:12.673
It's like a magic trick, saying that you cut somebody in half, but then saying, oh, it's just a magic trick, but you don't show anybody how it's done.

01:30:13.393 --> 01:30:15.354
You haven't proven that it's a magic trick.

01:30:16.734 --> 01:30:20.916
And these people talking in these generalized terms saying, oh, it's a magician on stage.

01:30:20.936 --> 01:30:22.097
You don't have to worry about him.

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:25.078
But if the illusion is so freaking good,

01:30:26.383 --> 01:30:37.128
It's going to require more than this guy just saying in general terms that, you know, they could release a virus or it could be a make a virus or see, it was already a specific enough to lay that down.

01:30:37.248 --> 01:30:38.608
And he did it perfectly.

01:30:39.228 --> 01:30:40.349
He just probably missed it.

01:30:41.764 --> 01:30:46.605
So they're using this as their major crowbar, the World Health Organization.

01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:58.829
And right now it looks as though through the World Health Organization's international health regulations, they're trying to overrule our national constitutions and our national laws.

01:30:59.349 --> 01:31:12.695
Just like Merrill Nass, he believes that the World Health Organization and Bill Gates and the United Nations are trying to take over our nation states using this narrative.

01:31:12.735 --> 01:31:15.456
Well, sounds more like an announcement to me.

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:25.801
Sounds more like you want everybody to accept that, that it's a situation that you can't control, you could never change, you might as well acquiesce to it, it's already over.

01:31:27.133 --> 01:31:32.161
It sounds like that's what he's saying, very much like a lot of these other people say, which I just find absurd.

01:31:33.062 --> 01:31:34.744
We're not all in the same bucket.

01:31:34.765 --> 01:31:38.610
We're not all have the same problem because we don't have the same constitution.

01:31:39.492 --> 01:31:40.974
We aren't in the same countries.

01:31:41.334 --> 01:31:42.877
This is bullshit.

01:31:44.722 --> 01:31:56.671
All 194, I believe, member states of the World Health Organization will then be ruled by the World Health Organization or by the World Economic Forum or rather by the people who are pulling their strings.

01:31:57.192 --> 01:31:59.193
If this is not about health, what is their goal?

01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:02.636
Well, the ultimate goal is it's all out there in the open.

01:32:02.676 --> 01:32:05.778
You can read up on this in The Great Reset, which...

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:12.242
Seriously, this is as far as we've gotten in the last five years to replace something from 2022?

01:32:13.082 --> 01:32:16.924
Really, this is as far as we've gotten at CHD and Mary Holland?

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:17.924
This is the news?

01:32:18.804 --> 01:32:20.505
Holy shit, are we in trouble.

01:32:20.525 --> 01:32:22.586
It was written by Klaus Schwab.

01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:28.909
Or you can listen to the interviews that this aforementioned Harari did.

01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:33.331
What they really want is complete control of the world.

01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:36.926
not just of animals and plants, but also of humans.

01:32:37.286 --> 01:32:44.049
This may sound like it's, I've watched too many James Bond movies, but unfortunately it's the truth.

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:46.151
And, you know, it's all out there in the open.

01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:55.516
What they really want is they want to have us agree to two things, to a one world government under the UN,

01:32:56.474 --> 01:33:08.918
which they own, the World Economic Forum, and they want us to agree to a one world digital currency along the lines of the Chinese social credit system, which they own.

01:33:09.698 --> 01:33:11.759
One bank, one digital currency.

01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:13.880
If you don't behave, you're not going to get any money.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.161
You're not going to get any access to anything.

01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:18.561
Those are the goals.

01:33:18.981 --> 01:33:21.102
Ultimately, they want to control the world.

01:33:23.783 --> 01:33:27.948
Again, who is they, has never been answered by any of these people.

01:33:28.008 --> 01:33:28.728
Who is they?

01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:31.551
Who wants to get control of the world?

01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:37.458
Who is, is, got control of so many countries that in Germany this guy could be in jail?

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:45.658
And in America, I guess, I don't know, Robert Malone would have been in jail if we had a justice system, but he's a good guy now and he's on the ACIP or something.

01:33:45.678 --> 01:33:46.839
I don't know what's going on.

01:33:47.279 --> 01:33:54.283
I don't know what he's talking about, but this is not the narrative that will escape, that will lead our grandchildren out.

01:33:54.343 --> 01:33:55.644
This is bullshit.

01:33:56.285 --> 01:33:58.886
They're all powerful.

01:34:00.127 --> 01:34:01.148
They have all the money.

01:34:01.188 --> 01:34:02.489
They have all the resources.

01:34:02.549 --> 01:34:03.289
We can't win.

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.232
He's not saying social media is the way they accomplished it.

01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:11.113
He's not saying that we have to get our kids off of social media.

01:34:11.153 --> 01:34:19.319
He's not saying we have to, you know, that's how you avoid the digital ID is you get your kids off of social media.

01:34:20.319 --> 01:34:32.288
You make social media irrelevant so that, you know, fake accounts and AI accounts and fake videos and AI generated videos don't mean anything because you're not on social media and neither are your kids.

01:34:33.945 --> 01:34:43.462
In order to get there, they need to create as much chaos as possible and they need to keep us in a constant mode of fear and panic.

01:34:44.702 --> 01:34:46.883
Number one, the Corona crisis.

01:34:46.983 --> 01:34:51.105
Number two, and it's still, the Corona crisis is not over.

01:34:51.366 --> 01:34:52.046
It's not over.

01:34:52.126 --> 01:34:58.229
And even though in some parts of the world, it seems like it's over, but they're still working on this behind the scenes.

01:34:58.649 --> 01:35:02.371
They may come up with something new, another virus.

01:35:02.471 --> 01:35:03.112
I don't think so.

01:35:03.172 --> 01:35:08.975
I think the next thing they're gonna do is they're gonna say, oh, we just realized that HIV is back.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.041
Why?

01:35:11.321 --> 01:35:20.735
Well, because one of the side effects, one of the adverse effects of most of the vaccines, in particular the mRNA vaccines, is that they destroy your immune system.

01:35:21.276 --> 01:35:26.103
And all of a sudden, you have an autoimmune deficiency problem.

01:35:27.484 --> 01:35:29.925
your immune system turns against your own body.

01:35:30.545 --> 01:35:35.407
And this is what happened with AIDS, or at least they claim that this is what happened with AIDS back then.

01:35:35.727 --> 01:35:42.029
There's a big, there's still a discussion about whether or not AIDS was caused by HIV.

01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:46.271
Judy Mikovits says no.

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:49.492
She... Bang!

01:35:49.552 --> 01:35:52.953
He says Judy Mikovits says no AIDS!

01:35:53.153 --> 01:35:53.874
Wow!

01:35:54.174 --> 01:35:54.474
Stop lying!

01:35:55.634 --> 01:35:58.817
Oh, that's awesome.

01:35:59.197 --> 01:36:01.739
That is fantastic.

01:36:01.819 --> 01:36:03.760
That is fantabulous.

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.761
That is brilliant.

01:36:06.382 --> 01:36:12.386
Because that means, like we've said for a few years now, this is all one malevolent show.

01:36:12.446 --> 01:36:15.107
These guys are all backstage together.

01:36:15.568 --> 01:36:19.370
And we can move from stage to stage on the Lollapalooza of liars.

01:36:19.871 --> 01:36:22.933
And you can think that they're all different bands, but they are not.

01:36:23.533 --> 01:36:25.355
They are not, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:25.595 --> 01:36:32.383
He sees the parallels between what's happening now with Fauci et al and what happened then with Fauci et al.

01:36:32.843 --> 01:36:42.674
So we believe that the next big thing they're going to pull out of the hat is a new crisis, a new what they claim viral crisis, HIV.

01:36:43.835 --> 01:37:02.466
in order to distract our attention from the adverse effects of the vaccine because that's what the mRNA vaccines cause they destroy your immune system after the third shot or so you have probably less than 30 percent of your immune system how and so you can debunk that really easily because you can say i know a bunch of people who got in their immune system is fine

01:37:03.166 --> 01:37:13.993
And so the problem again is that the only way these manufacturing quotas were made is because they rolled out placebo in the vast majority of shots in the vast majority of countries.

01:37:14.033 --> 01:37:17.595
And where they didn't do it, they had something else going on.

01:37:17.635 --> 01:37:20.937
I don't know what it was, but they didn't just transfect everybody.

01:37:20.977 --> 01:37:22.318
There's no way they did it.

01:37:23.819 --> 01:37:25.160
Look at these pictures.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.061
What is going on here?

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:33.954
in prison?

01:37:34.094 --> 01:37:35.195
How is his health?

01:37:35.275 --> 01:37:36.655
How is his physical health?

01:37:36.735 --> 01:37:37.956
How is his mental health?

01:37:40.297 --> 01:37:47.279
Rainer is combative, strong.

01:37:47.539 --> 01:37:48.519
He's a fighter.

01:37:48.539 --> 01:37:51.020
He's got a very strong character.

01:37:51.641 --> 01:37:57.963
And now that he is allowed to communicate with the co-prisoners, he can also engage

01:37:59.272 --> 01:38:03.535
and help people, which is of course good for him.

01:38:05.196 --> 01:38:08.538
But nevertheless, he's surely traumatized.

01:38:08.558 --> 01:38:18.063
20 months in prison, it's not nothing, sure.

01:38:18.423 --> 01:38:25.748
That doesn't sound fun at all, 20 months in prison, but she's talking about the fact that he can now talk to other prisoners, which means he can help people in prison.

01:38:26.715 --> 01:38:27.475
It's interesting.

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:29.796
It's just an observation she made.

01:38:30.116 --> 01:38:31.257
They take the attribute.

01:38:32.197 --> 01:38:38.459
Does he have support of a health freedom movement in Germany or in Europe?

01:38:39.099 --> 01:38:50.463
Are people concerned about his imprisonment and about what this means for criminalizing information and exposing the government?

01:38:52.184 --> 01:38:54.565
Is Mary wearing costume jewelry there?

01:38:54.625 --> 01:38:58.187
Would she be wearing costume jewelry or would those really be real diamonds?

01:38:58.267 --> 01:38:58.668
I wonder.

01:38:59.408 --> 01:39:04.892
Is it cool to wear costume jewelry as a health freedom activist?

01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:08.894
Yes, Ryan is enjoying support.

01:39:08.934 --> 01:39:10.896
He receives up to 100 letters per day.

01:39:19.477 --> 01:39:23.940
And he is trying to answer all of these messages.

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.863
This kind of support is what keeps him going.

01:39:28.823 --> 01:39:33.026
People write, people inform him about what is going on in the world.

01:39:33.887 --> 01:39:36.889
And he is interested in knowing this.

01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:40.251
And there are various actions.

01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:49.057
For example, an organization named Translated Lawyers for Enlightenment sent an open letter

01:39:50.338 --> 01:39:55.462
Alternative press is there to report.

01:39:56.283 --> 01:40:06.050
Bittel TV reports weekly about what's going on in the proceedings against Rainer Földmerich.

01:40:06.771 --> 01:40:15.058
So yes, he does have support in alternative media, in opposition, but the mainstream, of course,

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:23.214
either does not report or report in a specific way to belittle him.

01:40:24.735 --> 01:40:31.519
Is it possible for Reiner to get out of prison before the end of this sentence?

01:40:31.579 --> 01:40:44.326
In the United States, often sentences are commuted for good behavior and people can be released sometimes in as little as a half of the prescribed sentence.

01:40:44.406 --> 01:40:45.847
Is that possible for Reiner?

01:40:48.949 --> 01:40:56.175
In principle, this is also possible in Germany.

01:40:57.276 --> 01:41:01.300
But in this case, many things are just different than usually.

01:41:05.523 --> 01:41:11.088
Five months of investigative detention were not taken into account.

01:41:11.508 --> 01:41:12.449
This is unusual.

01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:20.814
he spent so far in prison prior to the sentencing should be taken into account.

01:41:20.954 --> 01:41:22.775
This would be a normal procedure.

01:41:22.935 --> 01:41:24.856
This didn't happen.

01:41:26.617 --> 01:41:36.023
And they explained it by saying he did not show any remorse, no regrets, no excuses.

01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:38.965
And he also insulted

01:41:40.646 --> 01:41:53.777
It was very harsh towards the judge, towards the state prosecutor, because he felt that it was unjust what was done to him.

01:41:54.778 --> 01:41:59.502
And they said this is the reason for this harsh treatment.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.949
sentenced for not taking into account the time he spent in prison so far.

01:42:08.969 --> 01:42:18.582
He says he is not guilty, he is innocent and Katya says in her eyes, in her opinion, he is innocent.

01:42:19.995 --> 01:42:40.963
Again, this, of course, is even more true if the German intelligence service uses agents to make them, the agents, commit crimes in order to blame these crimes on others, or use these crimes to file criminal complaints against others.

01:42:41.844 --> 01:42:46.465
So this investigative crimes investigative committee,

01:42:49.016 --> 01:42:58.258
International Crimes Investigative Committee, ICIC.law, is the organization from which he supposedly embezzled.

01:42:58.578 --> 01:42:59.278
Is that the right word?

01:42:59.339 --> 01:42:59.539
Yeah.

01:43:00.359 --> 01:43:03.920
And now CHD is playing his statement from June 8th.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.480
This is precisely what happened here in my case.

01:43:08.301 --> 01:43:17.863
The government's agents, having been granted full immunity by the government, stole my money,

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:29.278
in order to be able to file a criminal complaint against me in which they accused me of having taken out a loan, which I never paid back.

01:43:29.978 --> 01:43:33.999
Well, obviously I never paid it back because they stole my money.

01:43:35.499 --> 01:43:38.220
At any rate, um, Schindler.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.561
So I think that's the part about the house.

01:43:40.621 --> 01:43:45.182
He took money from his organization, put it as a down payment on a loan to the house.

01:43:46.578 --> 01:43:50.140
paid it off or something like that, and then sold the house for profit.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:59.266
So there's some money here that moved around because people shuffled money around and then somebody of the organization filed suit against him.

01:44:01.487 --> 01:44:05.229
Downplay the measures, the white torture stuff.

01:44:08.579 --> 01:44:11.201
White torture is now what he's going to define.

01:44:11.301 --> 01:44:18.788
White torture is, I guess, when they do stuff to people that's not like waterboarding.

01:44:18.848 --> 01:44:34.221
It's called white torture now, which I think when you start to redefine terms or define terms and do it as stupidly as he's doing right now, it can only serve as an incredible discreditment bomb.

01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:34.702
It's like

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:40.323
You just shit all over yourself in front of everyone on stage.

01:44:40.383 --> 01:44:47.845
Like what are you doing when you say something so dumb as white torture to describe what you're experiencing?

01:44:49.225 --> 01:44:55.387
Solitary confinement stating that this was normal procedure for pretrial detention.

01:44:55.787 --> 01:44:59.368
He doesn't even mention the story about my mother.

01:45:01.167 --> 01:45:28.142
And, of course, he says that the defense lawyers lied about being threatened and attacked by the government's agents, completely disregards the evidence we showed in court proving that it was the government's agents, you know, the guys who filed the criminal complaint, who are behind the threats, including death threats, hiding behind fake identities.

01:45:28.726 --> 01:45:45.039
What would you like, are there any websites first where we could learn more about the trial, find out how Reiner is doing, but also what would you like our viewers to know or to do about this situation?

01:45:45.059 --> 01:45:51.984
We are nowhere near saying anything about what happened in Germany.

01:45:52.745 --> 01:45:56.909
We're nowhere near saying that they killed people in Germany and lied about it.

01:45:56.949 --> 01:46:01.574
We're nowhere near saying that they killed people in specific places and lied about it.

01:46:01.594 --> 01:46:02.736
You know, like Scotland.

01:46:03.196 --> 01:46:04.658
There's a whole substack about it.

01:46:04.698 --> 01:46:05.659
Or like America.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:07.801
Nowhere.

01:46:10.495 --> 01:46:13.437
We haven't said anything specific about anything.

01:46:13.717 --> 01:46:18.340
For all I know, he was fighting for Whole Foods to be present in Germany.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.061
I don't know what he was fighting about.

01:46:20.101 --> 01:46:21.382
I don't know what he was fighting for.

01:46:21.882 --> 01:46:25.984
I don't know what the organization from whom he embezzled was fighting for.

01:46:26.605 --> 01:46:30.427
Because this seems to be all about Reiner being a political prisoner.

01:46:30.447 --> 01:46:31.608
Stop lying!

01:46:34.932 --> 01:46:38.237
Since in Germany, the jurisdiction of the courts

01:46:47.714 --> 01:46:57.746
In the jurisdiction of the courts, if it comes to the corona investigators, educators, then there are little chances of being treated fairly.

01:46:58.207 --> 01:47:05.496
And for this reason, what can really help is international public attention, pressure, this could

01:47:07.282 --> 01:47:28.256
maybe even help to get it will be a waste it will be a waste of anybody's time in america to spend any time on reiner fulmik it's absolutely absurd that mary holland is pretending to be some kind of journalist activist host of a show it's absolutely atrocious what these people have done

01:47:29.036 --> 01:47:47.599
for the governments of the world against the people of the world is they've conjured a new gold standard in PCR and in transfection and they are going forward with it with a pseudo-resistance which will never stop the progression of this narrative, only explain to you what's happening.

01:47:48.564 --> 01:47:49.946
And that's what these people are.

01:47:50.006 --> 01:47:51.127
They are fraudulent.

01:47:51.227 --> 01:47:52.589
They are saboteurs.

01:47:53.049 --> 01:47:54.911
They are traitors to our grandkids.

01:47:55.071 --> 01:47:57.955
Please, please see them for what they are.

01:47:58.255 --> 01:47:58.876
Oh my goodness.

01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:20.135
Sorry about that.

01:48:20.195 --> 01:48:21.136
Drop that ball there.

01:48:21.176 --> 01:48:21.557
Here we go.

01:48:21.577 --> 01:48:22.277
This was the right one.

01:48:56.288 --> 01:48:57.574
I think you can tell us the most.

01:52:07.715 --> 01:52:08.443
dreams.

01:53:25.307 --> 01:53:29.893
We play that song for this guy down here in the corner standing with me right there.

01:53:30.614 --> 01:53:31.896
That guy right there is a...

01:53:33.513 --> 01:53:35.354
was my best friend from college.

01:53:36.475 --> 01:53:42.839
I've known Nathan since I was his class's calculus tutor.

01:53:43.919 --> 01:53:50.283
I wasn't that good at calculus, but I was really good friends with the teacher, and I got to be a tutor.

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.605
And I learned a lot of calculus by being his tutor.

01:53:53.866 --> 01:54:01.751
In that class, he actually met and courted his wife, who he left behind a couple years ago.

01:54:02.651 --> 01:54:22.146
with a freak aneurysm and I'm never gonna forget Nathan and I probably won't stop doing this stream ever because some part of me hopes that at some point his family will find this work and understand that

01:54:23.692 --> 01:54:34.845
Although I haven't been the best friend since Nathan left this world, um, I'm trying to do what I can to make sure that his memory, uh, that some justice happens.

01:54:35.305 --> 01:54:38.409
Um, ladies and gentlemen, these people are posers.

01:54:38.849 --> 01:54:40.491
Um, they're really awful people.

01:54:40.832 --> 01:54:43.094
Um, and some of them I've had interactions with.

01:54:44.093 --> 01:54:45.194
And others I haven't.

01:54:45.754 --> 01:54:48.395
I'm sure that this is one of the worst ones.

01:54:48.956 --> 01:54:52.397
I'm sure that this guy here is awful.

01:54:52.517 --> 01:54:56.319
I'm sure that that dude over there for Brownstone is awful.

01:54:56.519 --> 01:55:02.563
I've had the unfortunate experience of sharing a room with that guy and actually also shaking his hand.

01:55:04.784 --> 01:55:10.587
Some of these people are just, they're just revolting because of the role that they are playing, their commitment to the lie.

01:55:10.607 --> 01:55:12.808
For MicroTV, this is beyond the noise.

01:55:13.484 --> 01:55:14.085
Episode number 70.

01:55:14.926 --> 01:55:17.810
Don't forget that Paul Offit's been on stage for a long time.

01:55:17.851 --> 01:55:18.652
He still is.

01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:20.054
Watch how it's evolved.

01:55:22.818 --> 01:55:23.619
Surprise!

01:55:23.639 --> 01:55:28.086
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

01:55:28.466 --> 01:55:28.967
Hi, Vincent.

01:55:29.994 --> 01:55:38.058
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack called Beyond the Noise, cutting to the chase on important health topics.

01:55:38.698 --> 01:55:41.140
Today, we'll talk about Paul's column.

01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:57.268
So for 15 years, this guy has been at the extraordinary forefront of opposing the fake anti-vax movement, the now called health freedom movement, that's, I guess, global, headed by, in America, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:58.624 --> 01:56:07.358
Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, Brian Hooker, Del Bigtree, Tony Lyons, and their political strategist...

01:56:09.657 --> 01:56:29.553
Steve Bannon as far as I can tell and their scientific crew basically consists of Robert Malone and and Kevin McKernan and So this is the flip side of that whole, you know limited spectrum of debate This guy's just on another motorcycle riding inside of the same flaming spear Sphere all I'm cold.

01:56:29.673 --> 01:56:36.219
Don't trust the old FDA trust us It was like a bad car dealer commercial.

01:56:36.379 --> 01:56:36.419
Oh

01:56:37.779 --> 01:56:38.920
Okay, let's go.

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:57.700
So Marty Makary, the head of the FDA, and Vinay Prasad, the head of CBER, which is the division that regulates vaccines, wrote a New England Journal of Medicine opinion where they claimed that there's been a loss of trust in vaccines.

01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.402
And what's their reason for this?

01:57:00.745 --> 01:57:11.928
Well, they believe there's been a loss of trust in vaccines because we haven't done placebo-controlled trials when we have every new COVID vaccine each year, which updates it to the circulating strands.

01:57:12.448 --> 01:57:22.710
And that they believe that by doing a prospective placebo-controlled trial in otherwise healthy 50 to 64-year-olds with each new update, that that will restore trust.

01:57:24.042 --> 01:57:26.163
Is that not extraordinary?

01:57:26.263 --> 01:57:30.324
Can you not see what we've been set up to listen to?

01:57:30.444 --> 01:57:48.030
What stupid questions they're asking based on the fact that the Egyptian UK citizen guy at the head of the FDA, the Indian at the head of CBER, these people have been put in place to set us up for this bullshit argument.

01:57:48.888 --> 01:57:50.370
this bullshit discussion.

01:57:51.051 --> 01:57:57.158
And we're supposed to defend Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad against this guy?

01:57:57.178 --> 01:58:01.604
The same guy that we were supposed to defend Mary Holland against?

01:58:02.144 --> 01:58:06.790
That we're supposed to feel bad because he's not being honest when he talks about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? ?

01:58:10.847 --> 01:58:14.928
This is all the worst possible show you can imagine.

01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:18.149
And they are all on the same team.

01:58:18.269 --> 01:58:21.110
They go backstage and it's the same location.

01:58:21.710 --> 01:58:23.051
It's just different stages.

01:58:24.011 --> 01:58:27.212
And Vincent Racaniello and Microbe TV are one stage.

01:58:27.292 --> 01:58:29.172
CHD TV is another stage.

01:58:29.952 --> 01:58:35.074
The only thing that's not happening is you're not seeing them behind the scenes pulling bongs together.

01:58:35.814 --> 01:58:39.475
Otherwise this Lollapalooza of liars would be absolutely complete.

01:58:40.914 --> 01:58:47.238
while they're right that I think there has been a loss of trust in vaccines, I think that has nothing to do with why there's been a loss of trust.

01:58:48.399 --> 01:58:53.903
They also claim that limiting the vaccine to 65 and under will restore that trust as well.

01:58:55.624 --> 01:58:57.065
But first, we'll cover that.

01:58:58.186 --> 01:59:02.909
First of all, are they correct that public trust in vaccines has declined?

01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:06.031
I think it has to some extent declined, yes.

01:59:06.711 --> 01:59:10.554
If you look at national polls, the sense is that it has declined, that there are

01:59:11.363 --> 01:59:19.625
States now that are considering eliminating non-medical exemptions like philosophical or religious exemptions I think there's a pushback clearly on vaccine mandates.

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:40.429
I think the word mandates has become A dirty word and I think it I think mandates has become a dirty word I think mandates is what everybody is supposed to fight about I think mandates has been the script since already when mary holland was on democracy now opposite at pal offit in 2015 where she said one component or another of the untested mmr vaccine

01:59:40.949 --> 01:59:41.910
injured her son.

01:59:44.431 --> 01:59:47.333
These people are the most malevolent liars in America.

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:50.114
It was a consequence in some ways of the first couple years.

01:59:50.254 --> 02:00:09.045
In reality, it is possible for me to easily conceive a scenario where professionally, biologically, and in a real sense, Paul Offit actually believes everything he says and therefore is not actually lying about very much.

02:00:10.327 --> 02:00:14.308
Whereas the flip side cannot be said about Mary Holland.

02:00:15.128 --> 02:00:17.049
It cannot be said about Brian Hooker.

02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:19.370
It cannot be said about Pauly Tommy.

02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:32.514
It cannot be said about Andrew Wakefield because they have been making inept, non-progressing, non-evolving arguments about a limited spectrum of questions for more than 15 years.

02:00:33.354 --> 02:00:34.694
And it's bullshit.

02:00:36.555 --> 02:00:37.275
It's the pandemic.

02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:46.432
I think in 2020, when we didn't have anything, we didn't have monoclonals or antivirals or vaccines until the end of 2020, what did we do?

02:00:46.532 --> 02:01:00.415
We shuttered schools, we restricted travel, we closed businesses, we isolated, quarantined, masked, social distanced, and I think there were... Do I have to play Mary Holland's recording from being on stage a year ago where she's in the mask and everything?

02:01:00.936 --> 02:01:06.477
I had COVID for two days and I took hypermedicine and I was fine, but I could travel because I had natural immunity.

02:01:07.722 --> 02:01:08.802
Holy shit.

02:01:09.422 --> 02:01:12.303
For some that really felt that was government overreach.

02:01:13.043 --> 02:01:19.265
And in 2021, when we had a vaccine and you couldn't go places like your favorite bar or restaurant.

02:01:19.485 --> 02:01:26.207
So both sides of the coin are not going to ever talk about the fact that people were murdered in America.

02:01:26.247 --> 02:01:33.589
When is Scott Shara going to say that Grace is just one of a million people in America that may have been murdered?

02:01:34.423 --> 02:01:36.484
And there's all different ways they did it.

02:01:36.584 --> 02:01:41.126
When is he going to say that his kid isn't the only kid that died?

02:01:41.526 --> 02:01:46.008
When is he going to say that his family member isn't the only person who had loved ones?

02:01:46.768 --> 02:01:59.134
When is he going to talk about the other 999,000 Americans that are supposedly have killed by COVID when in reality they probably died in some way related to his daughter?

02:01:59.194 --> 02:02:00.635
When, when are we going to hear that?

02:02:00.675 --> 02:02:01.895
We're never going to hear it.

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:03.896
Never.

02:02:06.718 --> 02:02:11.667
or you were fired from your job, replace of worship, you couldn't go.

02:02:11.787 --> 02:02:15.293
There was again this sense of massive government overreach.

02:02:16.331 --> 02:02:19.933
that we're feeling the result of that.

02:02:19.993 --> 02:02:21.594
I think we're feeling the result of that in many ways.

02:02:21.674 --> 02:02:26.017
I think that it became easier to vilify vaccines when we did that.

02:02:27.077 --> 02:02:27.738
And I think we did.

02:02:27.818 --> 02:02:33.721
So we're already past the possibility of even addressing the murder that took place in 2021 and 22.

02:02:34.241 --> 02:02:36.643
And we're already on to debating the COVID shot.

02:02:37.103 --> 02:02:40.645
Exactly like what arguing about a DNR order

02:02:41.966 --> 02:02:48.731
And whether a DNR order can or can't be given by a hospital, whether you're giving informed consent or not, you're giving consent.

02:02:49.531 --> 02:02:50.832
Not informed consent.

02:02:51.092 --> 02:02:51.693
Consent.

02:02:53.154 --> 02:02:54.495
You see the problem here?

02:02:56.596 --> 02:03:00.199
That's another game that they're playing with Grace Shara's dad.

02:03:00.259 --> 02:03:02.540
Is this informed consent or consent?

02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:09.305
If you sign a form and it's a consent form, that's different than informed consent.

02:03:15.342 --> 02:03:16.223
Holy shit.

02:03:16.364 --> 02:03:18.807
I mean really this is a problem ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:18.827 --> 02:03:20.149
We need somebody on this.

02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:21.491
We need to get this done

02:03:22.574 --> 02:03:23.394
This is bad.

02:03:23.515 --> 02:03:25.576
Right now, it is red alert bad.

02:03:26.036 --> 02:03:28.897
And we need to get this done while it's still hot.

02:03:29.598 --> 02:03:33.940
The Grace Shara case, there's something that feels crazy.

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.041
And this is part of it.

02:03:36.121 --> 02:03:46.887
This whole bullshit show at the FDA about the COVID vaccines is also extremely pertinent to understand the bullshit that's here.

02:03:48.198 --> 02:03:52.419
we're about to say that it would be unethical to do, I don't know, what study.

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:54.560
Did lose some trust.

02:03:56.321 --> 02:03:56.621
All right.

02:03:56.661 --> 02:04:05.343
So, how will requiring placebo-controlled studies for yearly COVID vaccines, how is that going to restore that lost trust?

02:04:06.164 --> 02:04:07.424
I don't think it will restore it at all.

02:04:07.504 --> 02:04:12.666
First of all, we do know from the last, say, three years, we have done

02:04:14.019 --> 02:04:21.028
retrospective trials looking at people who did or didn't get the updated COVID vaccine to see whether or not it was a value.

02:04:21.128 --> 02:04:22.050
And of course it was.

02:04:22.210 --> 02:04:25.854
I mean, at least for a few months, you were protected against mild to moderate disease.

02:04:27.056 --> 02:04:29.259
And it was really independent of age and risk factor.

02:04:29.319 --> 02:04:30.861
So you have that information.

02:04:30.881 --> 02:04:32.183
And also in terms of safety,

02:04:32.703 --> 02:04:36.007
There's probably been 2 billion doses of this vaccine that have been administered.

02:04:36.087 --> 02:04:44.075
I would argue we know more about this vaccine than any vaccines we've ever had before, so I think we have that information.

02:04:44.415 --> 02:04:49.721
The other thing about doing a prospective placebo-controlled trial on otherwise healthy 50- to 64-year-olds,

02:04:51.343 --> 02:04:53.004
Sorry, I had to send a text to my son.

02:04:54.385 --> 02:04:56.245
Look, he's saying it right now.

02:04:56.305 --> 02:05:00.448
We have more data from this vaccine than any vaccine before.

02:05:00.968 --> 02:05:11.093
This is again what makes it so malevolent that the fake anti-vax movement, the fake health freedom movement never considered the possibility

02:05:11.673 --> 02:05:17.895
that the vast majority of the rollout would be placebo, and that's why the vast majority of people never saw any side effects.

02:05:18.395 --> 02:05:25.537
Instead, we had a person like Jessica Rose saying that, oh, there's a signal in VAERS that's never been there before.

02:05:28.998 --> 02:05:33.400
And she's still doing that right now, five and a half years, six years later.

02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:35.480
Six and a half years later.

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:36.361
Think about that.

02:05:39.382 --> 02:05:40.462
Because he just said it.

02:05:41.687 --> 02:06:00.045
And it's not by accident, it's because this is the stupid script that we've been on for like 15 years, ever since Mary Holland broke away from Columbia University to work with Brian Hooker to create Children's Health Defense with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:00.605 --> 02:06:04.109
and absorb people like Laura Bono into the illusion.

02:06:07.176 --> 02:06:09.897
is that I don't think you can ethically do that study.

02:06:11.197 --> 02:06:12.697
You know that the virus is circulating.

02:06:12.857 --> 02:06:14.918
You know that this vaccine will be of some value.

02:06:15.518 --> 02:06:21.940
You know that a 50- to 64-year-old, although not at high risk, is at some risk.

02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:28.581
And could you really conscience, say, a few people in the placebo group having serious or even fatal disease?

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:31.942
I don't think you can conscience that, given what you know about the

02:06:32.162 --> 02:06:34.184
That is spectacular.

02:06:34.224 --> 02:06:40.468
And again, this is the same bullshit argument that they've been making, that Aaron Siri's been repeating.

02:06:40.908 --> 02:06:50.015
And even though Pierre Cory seems to realize that SIDS might have to do something with vaccines, these malevolent lying assholes

02:06:50.635 --> 02:07:03.270
have still not been able to explain to you that if sudden infant death syndrome is from vaccinations, then we could just give placebo vaccinations to kids and then 30 days later, give them the hot doses.

02:07:03.711 --> 02:07:09.297
And then if they just mix that up, you would have a pretty good study done already right now.

02:07:09.798 --> 02:07:10.679
And it would be over.

02:07:12.216 --> 02:07:20.866
And they could have made this argument 15 years ago, or 10 years ago, or 5 years ago, hypothetically, or for real, this could have been done by doctors.

02:07:21.346 --> 02:07:28.975
For shit's sake, CHD could have organized doctors to do it, because any doctor worth their salt would see that that's a pretty easy experiment.

02:07:29.415 --> 02:07:34.758
You're gonna come in, we're gonna do a baby wellness check, and in 30 days we're gonna do another wellness check.

02:07:35.138 --> 02:07:41.301
And I'm gonna have my nurses blind me to whether it's a flu shot or whether it's a placebo.

02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:42.962
And I'm gonna do it for all my patients.

02:07:43.082 --> 02:07:47.024
Shit, I'm gonna find out once and for all if this vaccine stuff is nonsense or not.

02:07:48.977 --> 02:08:07.237
for some reason after all these years nobody's ever come up with that movement nobody's ever come up with that experiment this guy's never put his money where his mouth is and said it to say that these people could just be shut up with a simple experiment if they think that vaccines are hurting people and that my son transformed and

02:08:07.697 --> 02:08:24.706
started screaming and banging his head on the wall and shitting all over the place, well then we should be able to do a short-term placebo-controlled trial that won't risk anybody getting a disease, but will still test the short-term effects of these... medical... interventions.

02:08:26.367 --> 02:08:33.810
And the only reason why both Paul Offit and the other side have never been able to get there is because they are... They are liars.

02:08:37.475 --> 02:08:38.416
this vaccine already.

02:08:40.057 --> 02:08:51.566
Well, they have no conscience, Paul, and so they will just rewrite the rules saying you can withhold standard of care, which is what we're saying would have to be done, right?

02:08:52.246 --> 02:08:52.486
Right.

02:08:54.888 --> 02:08:58.871
In terms of safety, they make a big deal about this.

02:08:59.371 --> 02:09:03.955
And you say in your piece that no vaccines have been better studied, right?

02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:12.808
Right, and they've made a very big deal, and Marty Makary's made a very big deal about, you know, myocarditis and, you know, was it hidden from us?

02:09:13.068 --> 02:09:20.355
They decided to wait on this data because they were worried that it might result in some families choosing not to vaccinate their kids.

02:09:20.715 --> 02:09:26.781
I mean, did we not tell people quickly enough that this was a rare cause of myocarditis?

02:09:26.841 --> 02:09:27.482
And we did.

02:09:27.562 --> 02:09:29.664
I mean, I was part of, I am part of the vaccine

02:09:30.419 --> 02:09:33.422
related biologic products advisory committee at the FDA.

02:09:33.482 --> 02:09:47.137
And very quickly, as soon as it became clear through things like the vaccine safety data link that this was a rare cause of myocarditis, primarily within four days of dose two of the 16 to 29-year-old, we knew that very early in the first few months.

02:09:47.717 --> 02:09:51.478
What's interesting now, though, is although Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:09:51.498 --> 02:10:04.083
has insisted on putting an enhanced warning label about myocarditis on these mRNA vaccines, there was a presentation in April at the CDC showing that myocarditis has essentially disappeared.

02:10:04.923 --> 02:10:08.365
First of all, it was always much milder than was the natural infection.

02:10:09.497 --> 02:10:15.679
It was always much milder than, I'm sorry, always much milder than the national and rat, the natural infection.

02:10:15.719 --> 02:10:28.762
So again, here's Paul Offit reinforcing the original narrative that the original virus, which may or may not have come from a laboratory was much more severe than the spike protein in the vaccine.

02:10:30.458 --> 02:10:34.399
And this is the same narrative that Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey are selling you.

02:10:34.439 --> 02:10:38.080
The same narrative that somebody like Richard Fleming is selling you.

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:49.264
The same narrative that all of these people sold you at the beginning of the pandemic, including Jessica Rose, including Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch.

02:10:50.844 --> 02:10:52.325
And they're still selling it to you now.

02:10:54.949 --> 02:11:05.930
that the original virus, whether it came from a bat cave or from the diffuse proposal spray bottle or from a, you know, somebody's shoe.

02:11:09.429 --> 02:11:14.672
It had all kinds of consequences, all kinds of biological oddities.

02:11:14.732 --> 02:11:15.392
It was weird.

02:11:15.412 --> 02:11:16.112
It was strange.

02:11:16.212 --> 02:11:17.553
I had it, you know, it was strange.

02:11:18.273 --> 02:11:25.457
It's funny that Mary Holland in that video, in that, that audio that I'm playing says that she had COVID, but it was only two days long.

02:11:25.497 --> 02:11:31.840
She took ivermectin and she was fine because I have another interview where she says she had COVID and it was very strange.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:36.942
It's not the same thing as, you know, I had COVID, but I took ivermectin and I was fine.

02:11:39.272 --> 02:11:44.836
These people are malevolent liars on a shitty script, and if you've paid attention long enough, you can see it.

02:11:44.897 --> 02:11:57.186
And if not, if you've been skillfully using social media and reading whatever it puts in front of you without much wherewithal for realizing how it could be weaponized against you, you don't know what's been done.

02:11:57.246 --> 02:12:00.429
You don't know how it's being done, and you can't see through it.

02:12:02.585 --> 02:12:10.328
because such a large percentage of the population has now been naturally infected or vaccinated multiple times, you really don't see much myocarditis anymore.

02:12:12.489 --> 02:12:15.951
But yet it was seen in the original trial, so you probably need something on the label, right?

02:12:16.371 --> 02:12:16.631
Sure.

02:12:16.871 --> 02:12:17.532
I think that's true.

02:12:17.552 --> 02:12:24.575
But to sort of enhance the label now, to make it more frightening now, makes little sense given the current epidemiology of myocarditis.

02:12:25.683 --> 02:12:29.526
So the Macari claim that myocarditis was covered up is just a lie.

02:12:30.146 --> 02:12:30.987
It's just a lie.

02:12:31.347 --> 02:12:33.088
And he goes on Fox News and says that.

02:12:33.348 --> 02:12:33.608
Why?

02:12:33.829 --> 02:12:34.489
What's the point?

02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:35.450
To scare people?

02:12:35.590 --> 02:12:36.490
Why would you want to do that?

02:12:38.732 --> 02:12:42.594
Prasad also says that COVID vaccines are useless for kids.

02:12:42.655 --> 02:12:43.255
Is that true?

02:12:45.136 --> 02:12:45.396
No.

02:12:45.817 --> 02:12:48.098
And that's been upsetting to me.

02:12:48.158 --> 02:12:51.981
We talked about that on a previous episode, but you have,

02:12:52.705 --> 02:12:59.627
You know that last year that there were roughly 6,700 or so hospitalizations in children less than 18.

02:13:00.247 --> 02:13:02.187
You know most were in children less than four.

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:08.169
You know that one in five of those children were in the intensive care unit among those hospitalized.

02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:10.890
You know that about 152 children died.

02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:13.770
You know that virtually all were unvaccinated.

02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:15.771
You know at least half were previously healthy.

02:13:15.891 --> 02:13:16.031
So,

02:13:16.671 --> 02:13:29.279
So it's the way that he says it, I keep looking at the wrong camera, it's the way that he says it, that he's so, you know, we know, you know, we know, it's, this is certain, we're certain about this, we're certain about this, we're certain about this.

02:13:29.819 --> 02:13:45.589
And just like our side, just like Robert Malone and Steve Hatfill and Jessica Rose and Tess Laurie and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass will all say that the PCR worked, that the sequences are evolution of the virus, that the new variant is a new variant,

02:13:46.289 --> 02:13:47.830
This guy would say the same thing.

02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:51.891
This guy would just, would say exactly the same thing.

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:56.713
Because they're on the exact same shitty script.

02:13:56.793 --> 02:13:58.814
It's Tony Fauci's script.

02:13:58.954 --> 02:14:00.555
It's Robert Malone's script.

02:14:00.615 --> 02:14:03.616
It's Kevin McKernan's script.

02:14:03.756 --> 02:14:05.337
It's Mark Lander's script.

02:14:05.437 --> 02:14:07.938
It's Francis Collins' script.

02:14:08.018 --> 02:14:10.299
It's the script of the Human Genome Project.

02:14:10.979 --> 02:14:12.860
The Human Genome Project isn't over.

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:22.386
It keeps going on to a next stage, a bigger stage, a more risky stage, a more invested stage, a more all-in stage.

02:14:22.526 --> 02:14:26.669
Please understand, these people are a joke.

02:14:27.614 --> 02:14:31.258
Healthy children benefit from a primary series, of course they do.

02:14:31.518 --> 02:14:32.799
I mean, I have two grandchildren.

02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:38.906
When they're six months of age, the maternal antibody that's transferred to them transplacentally will have worn off.

02:14:39.266 --> 02:14:49.536
And now they are fully... Now he just says that the antibody, the antibody that was transferred transplacentally will have worn off by six months old.

02:14:50.379 --> 02:14:54.402
So we're not talking at all about breastfeeding his grandchildren.

02:14:54.422 --> 02:15:05.349
We're not talking about the benefits of breastfeeding and what might also happen during breastfeeding, but we're actually talking about the fact that once you're born, you're on your own.

02:15:07.285 --> 02:15:09.328
Once you're born, you're on your own.

02:15:09.368 --> 02:15:12.031
And what about vaccinating the mom during pregnancy?

02:15:12.071 --> 02:15:13.232
Are we going to talk about that?

02:15:13.592 --> 02:15:19.199
Were your grandchildren exposed to the transfection during pregnancy?

02:15:19.219 --> 02:15:21.421
He doesn't seem to give a shit about that.

02:15:28.567 --> 02:15:31.473
we're going to the intensive care unit, or worse, is very small.

02:15:31.533 --> 02:15:32.375
It's not zero.

02:15:32.575 --> 02:15:39.089
And the safety of the vaccine and the efficacy of the vaccine clearly shows that its benefits outweigh its small risks.

02:15:40.663 --> 02:15:47.905
Well, also over five years old, I suppose there's also the higher risk of long COVID, which is partially ameliorated by vaccination, right?

02:15:47.925 --> 02:15:48.926
They never talk about that.

02:15:49.526 --> 02:15:50.006
Exactly.

02:15:50.126 --> 02:15:53.887
So if you've not been vaccinated or you've not been nationally infected, you're at risk.

02:15:54.087 --> 02:16:08.172
And so that risk can be... It's strange because Robert Malone on the ACIP told the story in 2021 that he took the vaccine because he heard on the internet that it would help with his long COVID that he got from SARS-CoV-2.

02:16:09.690 --> 02:16:12.011
being one of the old early COVID survivors.

02:16:12.091 --> 02:16:20.036
You can go to earlycovidsurvivors.com and see that Robert Malone was probably the super spreader at the Boston Amgen event.

02:16:20.496 --> 02:16:31.263
This is such an absurd narrative with such absurd, jackass, traitor liars doing the narrative only possible on social media.

02:16:32.643 --> 02:16:34.825
America must wake up.

02:16:35.914 --> 02:16:38.455
Only if America wakes up can the rest of the world wake up.

02:16:38.595 --> 02:16:41.537
Otherwise, the whole shit show is just going to keep rolling on.

02:16:42.237 --> 02:16:44.218
So you got to pull your big boy pants on.

02:16:44.238 --> 02:16:45.919
You got to pull your big girl pants on.

02:16:46.379 --> 02:16:48.260
We got to wake up America right now.

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.421
The children of America need to awaken.

02:16:53.911 --> 02:16:59.734
The head of CBER, the Centers for Biologics Evaluation and Research, says that, you know, that children don't need a vaccine.

02:16:59.995 --> 02:17:12.342
And RFK Jr., actually, when he stood up there with Marty McCary to his right and Jay Bhattachary to his left and said, we are not going to offer this vaccine for healthy young children, it's just awful.

02:17:12.762 --> 02:17:22.948
As of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.

02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:39.699
How can anybody explain that I have been to barbecues with Jay Bhattacharya, that I've been in many, many Zoom meetings with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that I used to work for Brian Hooker and Mary Holland, and yet now they are

02:17:42.031 --> 02:17:45.895
drawing down millions of dollars a year in donations.

02:17:46.615 --> 02:17:47.797
Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

02:17:47.857 --> 02:18:00.989
paid his security off from his campaigns for president, and he's now at HHS overseeing an HHS populated by directors that are with other passports.

02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:04.353
What in the Sam hell is going on in America?

02:18:05.431 --> 02:18:07.132
And it's the opposite of what he said he would do.

02:18:07.232 --> 02:18:10.435
He said he would, you know, go along with the ACIP recommendations.

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:17.520
He had said that when he first was brought up before the Senate confirmation hearing, that he wouldn't change those recommendations.

02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:18.640
That's exactly what he's doing.

02:18:19.841 --> 02:18:24.865
Well, of course, what he didn't say was that he was going to read appoint the ACIP to do what he wants.

02:18:25.025 --> 02:18:25.225
Right.

02:18:26.566 --> 02:18:26.626
So

02:18:31.778 --> 02:18:39.362
What's going to be the effect of limiting COVID vaccines to people over 65 unless you have some issue?

02:18:40.646 --> 02:18:46.150
Well, so the vaccine would be licensed for those over 65.

02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:51.895
It would be licensed for those under 65 who were in one of what were 23 listed high-risk conditions.

02:18:52.275 --> 02:19:01.503
The question is, how about people who can reasonably choose to get that vaccine, one, for the issue of long COVID, which you mentioned, or because they're taking care of an elderly parent, or they're taking care of a

02:19:02.283 --> 02:19:05.685
a child who has cancer, will they be able to get the vaccine?

02:19:06.666 --> 02:19:08.267
Will insurance companies pay for it?

02:19:08.667 --> 02:19:13.370
And if insurance companies can't, don't pay for it, and they can't afford it, what's going to be the result of this?

02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:13.990
Yeah.

02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:19.934
Of course, they also removed pregnancy from the high-risk category, and that's even worse.

02:19:19.954 --> 02:19:21.174
Look at those eyes.

02:19:21.274 --> 02:19:22.615
Look at that eye roll.

02:19:22.715 --> 02:19:23.836
That's amazing.

02:19:23.916 --> 02:19:25.357
Look at that eye roll.

02:19:25.377 --> 02:19:25.437
Wow.

02:19:25.717 --> 02:19:26.257
Worse.

02:19:28.004 --> 02:19:32.748
We're the only country in the world that doesn't consider pregnancy to be a high-risk condition for severe COVID.

02:19:33.409 --> 02:19:42.396
What I don't understand, Paul, is... We're the only country in the world that doesn't consider pregnancy a high-risk condition for long COVID.

02:19:43.137 --> 02:19:43.837
Stop lying!

02:19:44.318 --> 02:19:48.241
I mean, that's such a specifically certain statement.

02:19:48.281 --> 02:19:49.322
It's got to be bullshit.

02:19:50.233 --> 02:19:52.094
We're not talking about mandates, okay?

02:19:52.134 --> 02:19:54.554
That's their theme that we overreached.

02:19:54.814 --> 02:19:55.694
Okay, fine.

02:19:56.235 --> 02:20:01.316
But when the ACIP makes a decision, it's a recommendation.

02:20:01.416 --> 02:20:02.496
It is not a mandate.

02:20:02.736 --> 02:20:05.337
So why not let people still have a choice?

02:20:05.437 --> 02:20:06.417
I don't understand that.

02:20:06.697 --> 02:20:08.198
I think what happens is that

02:20:09.358 --> 02:20:14.301
For school entry requirements, you can't require a vaccine for school entry that's not recommended.

02:20:14.682 --> 02:20:15.042
You can't.

02:20:15.382 --> 02:20:20.585
And so if you don't recommend it, if you say shared clinical decision-making, then that eliminates mandates.

02:20:20.625 --> 02:20:29.851
And I really think where they want to go on this is the Project 2025 thing for the CDC, which is the CDC is no longer a recommending body, that we just throw it back

02:20:30.311 --> 02:20:32.832
to the parent-doctor interaction and let them decide.

02:20:32.852 --> 02:20:39.153
But the minute you do that, you're saying that vaccines just aren't necessarily important, that you could reasonably choose not to get any of them.

02:20:39.193 --> 02:20:40.734
And I think that's really where they're headed.

02:20:42.614 --> 02:20:42.814
Wow.

02:20:43.594 --> 02:20:45.055
None of this can have a good outcome.

02:20:46.435 --> 02:20:53.997
It could be a great outcome if your goal is to kind of destroy the FDA and the CDC insofar as they regulate shit.

02:20:54.815 --> 02:21:05.240
so that you can roll out, you know, basically anything you want, include just the idea that, you know, this is a personalized therapy made just for you based on your genetic and medical background.

02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.862
And so there's no place for the FDA to evaluate this.

02:21:08.902 --> 02:21:10.022
We made this for Jay.

02:21:10.523 --> 02:21:14.264
And so since we're not going to give it to anybody else, why do we need the FDA to be involved?

02:21:14.725 --> 02:21:15.485
This pivot

02:21:16.795 --> 02:21:21.241
also to an unregulated supplement market is gonna be one of the consequences.

02:21:21.281 --> 02:21:26.448
And we're gonna be fighting about whether vaccines are good or not, or what's a vaccine or whatever.

02:21:26.948 --> 02:21:28.470
That's the whole point of this.

02:21:29.431 --> 02:21:39.233
Because in order to just have a discussion on this side of the field, you're assuming that most or all vaccines are not only good, but they're very, very good.

02:21:39.793 --> 02:21:44.094
And so then you can have this whole discussion that these people are having on our side.

02:21:44.614 --> 02:21:48.334
We're assuming that nothing should be mandated and everything should be free choice.

02:21:48.394 --> 02:21:50.495
And some of this stuff is untested.

02:21:50.555 --> 02:21:56.996
And if we tested it, we would figure out which of those components, you know, the adjuvants or whatever are responsible for autism.

02:21:58.672 --> 02:22:02.895
It's just a stupid, malevolent show, a Lollapalooza of liars.

02:22:03.595 --> 02:22:15.522
No, I think what may save us, and I'm an optimist, but I think what may save us is that there are groups now like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which always make recommendations about vaccines.

02:22:16.143 --> 02:22:24.128
Those groups are now working with insurance companies to make sure that if they make a recommendation, that that also has the same strength as if the ACIP made the recommendation.

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.549
So it's not really shadowy.

02:22:26.169 --> 02:22:26.829
There we go.

02:22:26.869 --> 02:22:28.570
We'll just make it all private.

02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:35.174
We'll just make private, private recommendations that, oh my gosh, can't you see it now?

02:22:35.254 --> 02:22:36.595
This is just so dumb.

02:22:37.075 --> 02:22:42.778
So the Malone Foundation says no, but the American Academy for Pediatrics says yes.

02:22:43.239 --> 02:22:47.581
I wonder what the Brownstone Institute recommends for a vaccine schedule.

02:22:48.221 --> 02:22:51.043
Because the AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics,

02:22:51.343 --> 02:22:52.103
does that anyway.

02:22:52.364 --> 02:22:57.526
But there are other groups like American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology or American College of Physicians.

02:22:57.866 --> 02:23:14.694
Those groups then can have recommendations that have the strength of an ACIP recommendation because the ACIP has just been blown up and now has people on it that are like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anti-vaccine activists and science denialists and conspiracy theorists.

02:23:15.214 --> 02:23:15.635
Wow.

02:23:16.115 --> 02:23:24.344
As you wrote, I saw an interview with you, the ACIP has now lost the confidence of the medical establishment.

02:23:25.225 --> 02:23:28.609
For certain, they've lost the confidence of the medical and scientific establishment.

02:23:28.629 --> 02:23:32.573
If you look at the people who are now giving advice, these are not people who you would trust.

02:23:32.633 --> 02:23:36.177
And I think people at the CDC have called me recently and said, you know, I just don't know

02:23:36.954 --> 02:23:40.796
If I can continue to work here, I feel like we've lost the trust of the American public.

02:23:40.896 --> 02:23:42.117
And I think that's sad.

02:23:42.237 --> 02:23:43.958
And hopefully this won't last long.

02:23:44.078 --> 02:23:46.099
Hopefully we'll get past this phase of our lives.

02:23:46.379 --> 02:23:49.901
Ladies and gentlemen, if you didn't see yesterday's show, please check it out.

02:23:49.961 --> 02:23:51.601
I'm going to drop this one right now.

02:23:51.642 --> 02:23:52.802
I think I'm pretty much done.

02:23:52.842 --> 02:23:53.863
My knees hurt.

02:23:54.123 --> 02:23:56.224
That's why I was starting to do those squats back there.

02:23:56.744 --> 02:23:57.965
I need to move around a little bit.

02:23:58.405 --> 02:23:59.826
My back is still killing me.

02:24:00.246 --> 02:24:01.587
That's why I'm standing today.

02:24:02.007 --> 02:24:03.868
Maybe I've been sitting way too much lately.

02:24:05.428 --> 02:24:07.709
I just want to say thank you for being here.

02:24:08.209 --> 02:24:09.409
Thank you for making it possible.

02:24:09.449 --> 02:24:11.830
It's hot, hot in Pittsburgh.

02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:15.051
And I will definitely be on again tomorrow.

02:24:15.611 --> 02:24:16.912
Thank you very much for being here.

02:24:17.472 --> 02:24:21.193
Don't forget that Maha is a joke on America.

02:24:21.213 --> 02:24:23.113
Don't let it be a joke on your grandkids.

02:24:24.494 --> 02:24:28.215
Even if these people are unwitting participants, it's not acceptable anymore.

02:24:29.295 --> 02:24:35.056
This has been Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:24:35.096 --> 02:24:36.336
Thank you very much for being here.

02:24:36.356 --> 02:24:38.117
Whoops, that wasn't what I wanted to do.

02:24:39.517 --> 02:24:42.617
And I will see you again tomorrow, because that's what I do.

02:24:44.438 --> 02:24:45.238
This is what I do.

02:24:46.318 --> 02:24:48.618
This is me, and this is my message.

02:24:48.698 --> 02:24:50.599
Thanks for being here, and I'll see you again soon.

02:24:51.259 --> 02:24:52.259
Where's my music?

02:24:52.839 --> 02:24:54.439
Where's my music?

02:24:54.559 --> 02:24:57.860
Oh, I don't have it queued up even, because I had the other thing up.

02:25:00.811 --> 02:25:09.249
um come on come on where is it there it is i'm sorry about that i got it now here we go thanks for being here

02:27:01.439 --> 02:27:01.930
Autism.

02:27:02.869 --> 02:27:03.909
He was vaccine damaged.

02:27:04.270 --> 02:27:05.710
He was neurologically damaged.

02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:09.151
In condition that we will not call autism.

02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:10.832
I don't like the word autism.

02:27:11.732 --> 02:27:12.792
He was vaccine damaged.

02:27:13.132 --> 02:27:14.573
He was neurologically damaged.

02:27:15.453 --> 02:27:18.014
In condition that we will not call autism.

02:27:18.154 --> 02:27:19.714
I don't like the word autism.

02:27:20.614 --> 02:27:21.655
He was vaccine damaged.

02:27:22.015 --> 02:27:23.455
He was neurologically damaged.

02:27:24.316 --> 02:27:26.876
In condition that we will not call autism.

02:27:27.016 --> 02:27:28.577
I don't like the word autism.

02:27:29.477 --> 02:27:30.517
He was vaccine damaged.

02:27:30.878 --> 02:27:32.258
He was neurologically damaged.

02:27:33.041 --> 02:27:35.748
a condition that we will not call autism.

02:27:35.908 --> 02:27:37.432
I don't like the word autism.

02:27:38.354 --> 02:27:39.337
He was vaccine damaged.
