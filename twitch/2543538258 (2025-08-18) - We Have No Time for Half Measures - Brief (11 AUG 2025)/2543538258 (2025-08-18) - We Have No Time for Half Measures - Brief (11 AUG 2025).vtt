00:42.232 --> 00:46.117
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

00:47.930 --> 00:48.650
And I have lied.

00:48.670 --> 00:49.691
I'm sure I'll lie again.

00:49.711 --> 00:50.651
I don't want to lie.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.492
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

00:52.592 --> 00:53.633
I try not to be a liar.

00:53.653 --> 00:54.513
I don't want to be a liar.

00:55.074 --> 00:57.735
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:18.360 --> 01:24.545
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

01:24.906 --> 01:26.327
He was neurologically damaged.

01:27.227 --> 01:33.292
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.315
He was neurologically damaged.

01:36.395 --> 01:42.240
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

01:46.475 --> 01:57.020
Over the last three years, you have been subjected to the most massive, harmonized, globally coordinated propaganda campaign in the history of the Western world.

01:57.320 --> 01:57.941
Full stop.

02:11.727 --> 02:12.687
There are no ethics.

02:12.747 --> 02:15.389
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

02:16.727 --> 02:21.729
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

02:28.552 --> 02:32.793
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

02:32.833 --> 02:38.456
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

02:40.376 --> 02:44.438
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

02:45.851 --> 02:50.313
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement, but that's what we're in right now.

02:55.996 --> 03:05.601
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong, all that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.853
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.461
All that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

03:41.242 --> 03:47.847

04:46.314 --> 04:50.177
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

04:50.637 --> 04:52.838
We want everybody to feel good.

04:53.179 --> 04:54.600
That's not the way life is.

05:35.469 --> 05:39.332
If you eat like a dog, I'll let you live like a dog.

05:39.372 --> 05:43.776
If you're like a human, I'll let you grow.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.694
What time is it?

06:46.754 --> 06:47.475
Game time!

06:56.084 --> 06:56.904
Good afternoon.

06:58.025 --> 07:00.266
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

07:00.346 --> 07:01.526
Good afternoon, everybody.

07:01.566 --> 07:02.507
Welcome to the show.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.447
This is Gigome Biological.

07:04.467 --> 07:08.029
I'm just having a little trouble with my voice there, but it'll come back.

07:09.102 --> 07:17.724
Always I forget to clear my voice in my throat right before I click the mute button and instead I come on with frogs.

07:18.484 --> 07:21.385
Ladies and gentlemen, my message is get off social media.

07:21.405 --> 07:33.968
I don't have a great alternative for you right now other than PeerTube and Soapbox and just the idea that saying get off social media implies something that no one else is willing to say.

07:34.548 --> 07:37.249
We need to get off of social media.

07:37.609 --> 07:39.850
And more importantly, we need to get our kids off of it.

07:40.611 --> 07:44.732
And nobody seems to care that our kids aren't even on the same social media that we are.

07:45.713 --> 07:56.057
These are all incongruencies that need to be addressed with firm language that makes people think, like yelling at them, get the heck off of social media.

07:56.137 --> 08:00.019
Even if there aren't alternatives right now, we need to encourage people to build them.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.740
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

08:03.464 --> 08:14.313
that was used to make sure that intramuscular injection would never be questioned as a methodology, that virology would never be questioned as a science, and public health would be never questioned as a reason.

08:15.173 --> 08:17.655
They've done the same thing with pandemics and gain-of-function.

08:18.156 --> 08:23.180
It's been much more of a militant and all-encompassing operation, but nonetheless,

08:23.860 --> 08:31.878
We have been slapped in the head by social media and specifically if you want to escape, you need to understand why the cheese is free there.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.682
I think that is the best way.

08:34.793 --> 08:54.480
to also show your kids why is it possible how is it possible that that snapchat allows you to use it completely for free it seems like well you know because they get something out of it no what they get out of it is worth the free cheese that's the reality of it ladies and gentlemen we do have we do have biology to learn

08:55.661 --> 08:58.844
And we do have biology to teach, but we're going to need to go back in time.

08:59.344 --> 09:05.570
We're going to need to reconsider everything that we thought we knew as we've come out of this pandemic.

09:06.771 --> 09:09.473
And we need to seek the truth together.

09:10.715 --> 09:20.303
That's the most important thing I think right now is everybody that's really seeking the truth and in earnest needs to get together.

09:21.484 --> 09:24.667
And I would like to contribute my part with regard to the biology.

09:24.727 --> 09:26.068
I can't contribute my part.

09:26.568 --> 09:28.210
Are we going to be talking about excrement today?

09:28.390 --> 09:28.570
No.

09:28.850 --> 09:33.955
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours who are rolling the excrement off stage.

09:34.759 --> 09:48.688
Ladies and gentlemen, I really think we're finally able to kind of say it as succinctly as possible, and that is that social media has been used against us, and it is the military weapon that everybody isn't talking about.

09:49.289 --> 10:03.238
The control of the narrative on social media, not the public censorship, not the public, you know, outcry about what Facebook did or what X did, but the very complicated theater about that.

10:03.778 --> 10:11.920
and how it convinced the right and the left to essentially fragment, convinced us to fragment very violently.

10:12.901 --> 10:16.882
And we need to show our children the truth that actually our neighbors have been fooled.

10:17.362 --> 10:23.503
And it doesn't really matter if you're blue looking over at a red house or whether you're living in a red house looking over at a blue house.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.384
The reality is the same.

10:26.404 --> 10:27.826
Both sides have been fooled.

10:27.886 --> 10:46.621
It may seem like right now, the potential energy for a face plant is much farther on the red side, but I assure you at any moment in time, the same mechanisms of control could be used to create the situation where the face plant would be on the left.

10:46.721 --> 10:52.566
I think right now we've been set up as is typical in history for the face plant, the really severe one.

10:53.626 --> 11:02.669
to be for the conservative side in an effort to move toward what has been in history termed kind of a communist or socialist regime.

11:03.589 --> 11:05.070
I think it is very possible.

11:06.330 --> 11:13.473
Somebody was pretty pissed off at me yesterday about, I guess, my inability to see that the left was about to rise and

11:14.233 --> 11:19.217
and that maybe in a few years, people who had bent on Joe Rogan would be put in prison.

11:20.038 --> 11:34.870
I don't know if that's how far this is gonna go, but I do know that the one way that I think we could save ourselves from this is to show our children that it's all an illusion and that they don't need to pick up guns and fight for one side or the other.

11:34.890 --> 11:36.651
What they need to do is break out of this.

11:36.731 --> 11:41.115
They need to save their family and friends, their family and friends, including their parents,

11:41.875 --> 11:46.962
including their aunts and uncles from this elaborate fifth generation warfare on the right.

11:48.055 --> 11:56.902
which included a lot of these very fake skeptical groups that of course are, they're full of people with genuinely good interests.

11:57.383 --> 12:02.046
And it's very easy to condescendingly look at anyone that fell for these people as being dumb.

12:03.087 --> 12:13.195
But in reality, because of the way that we are governed, because we don't need to actually have a majority, we just need to project the illusion of a majority.

12:13.936 --> 12:17.339
It is possible that for this fifth generation warfare to haven't had

12:17.959 --> 12:24.850
a significant role to play in a carefully gamed script.

12:26.309 --> 12:44.816
And I know I've got a few friends who are all about gaming scripts and making sure that all bases are covered and all scenarios are covered as they move through their law case or the way that they script an interview with a witness or this kind of thing.

12:44.856 --> 12:49.078
But this is also, these military tactics are also employed

12:50.263 --> 12:52.824
were employed during the pandemic on both sides.

12:53.284 --> 13:04.367
And it is just now the part in the narrative where this side of the equation, the side that is defending Trump and defending, I don't know, maybe Elon Musk is good or not.

13:04.407 --> 13:05.848
Maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.128
is good, but not good enough.

13:07.268 --> 13:10.369
Or, you know, Donald Trump isn't really covering up Epstein.

13:10.429 --> 13:11.710
Epstein's a real guy though.

13:12.190 --> 13:15.871
And Steve Bannon needs all three of those pens because he works so hard.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.472
and Bitcoin and COVID.

13:19.432 --> 13:27.935
This occupation of our consciousness on the right and the left is a sort of wicked harmony.

13:27.955 --> 13:29.835
You can't have one without the other.

13:30.475 --> 13:38.438
In other words, Trump's existence on the right would not be as powerful if it wasn't for the Trump derangement syndrome

13:38.858 --> 13:40.139
that exists on the left.

13:40.260 --> 13:49.228
Without the effect that a lot of these people have had on their followers, Trump would not be able to have the effect that he has on his followers.

13:49.368 --> 13:58.636
And that is a very simple explanation, but I hope you can start to understand how this two sides of the coin thing has really been applied to us.

13:59.236 --> 14:00.478
And if Mark or I

14:01.138 --> 14:15.979
right now i think mark is on a plane returning from vacation but if mark was to come back and start to show you a history and show business of two sides of a coin that seem to be intimately involved in again seeding this narrative of either a

14:16.740 --> 14:27.729
a heroic patriot in the form of a playboy named Donald Trump or a democracy destroying psychopath in the form of Donald Trump.

14:28.289 --> 14:31.451
So I really, I think this message is new.

14:31.531 --> 14:32.632
I think it's really unique.

14:32.672 --> 14:37.176
Fifth generation warfare is both sides of this equation.

14:37.256 --> 14:43.841
It is Donald Trump and defending him and thinking that he's a hero and playing, you know, five D chess along with

14:44.421 --> 15:01.388
health and human services secretary robert f kennedy jr who who i happen to write a dumb book with um or or the view and and their sort of you know worship of fauci and nih and and francis collins and his guitar this is all part of one

15:02.188 --> 15:02.648
theater.

15:02.768 --> 15:07.271
It is, as best as I can describe it, a Lollapalooza of liars.

15:07.331 --> 15:19.058
And most of these people are actors with just a little better script than what Alex Jones has been provided with, a little better role than the role that Alex Jones has been provided with.

15:19.118 --> 15:30.986
But suffice it to say that 10 years ago, no one who follows Alex Jones would have ever predicted that they themselves would be following Alex Jones behind

15:31.966 --> 15:37.448
I don't know, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:38.308 --> 15:39.268
and Steve Bannon.

15:39.368 --> 15:48.891
It is an absurdity that now that we are here and we can see out the windows of the car that we're in, we must demand that the drivers stop and we get out.

15:48.931 --> 15:53.753
We must demand that the drivers stop and we get out because we are victims.

15:53.913 --> 15:57.054
We did not realize we didn't get into a car of good people.

15:57.754 --> 16:00.815
We weren't being told stories full of truth.

16:02.267 --> 16:17.303
but we got abducted onto a very sketchy sci-fi movie and several of these people have been posing as science officers and the like for quite some time and it's bad it's very

16:18.064 --> 16:18.985
Very, very bad.

16:20.266 --> 16:21.747
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

16:21.787 --> 16:26.070
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.011
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

16:27.031 --> 16:29.893
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

16:31.214 --> 16:39.580
I have recently added some technology to my room, and it is some of the best and most important technology I have added.

16:40.141 --> 16:46.466
Oftentimes in the summer, I find myself with bare ankles, if not bare legs, in my basketball shorts underneath the desk.

16:47.206 --> 16:56.809
And because the back door is often open, inevitably this becomes a feast for any stray mosquito or gnat or whatever other biting bug might be in here.

16:57.449 --> 17:00.850
And I have installed a bug light which has changed my life.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.671
So, you know, little things, ladies and gentlemen, little things.

17:03.711 --> 17:04.491
Welcome to the show.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.051
Again, I'm very happy to be here.

17:07.091 --> 17:08.132
I took a few days off.

17:08.192 --> 17:09.772
It's been a very turbulent weekend.

17:11.173 --> 17:15.174
Not to say that, you know, anything is wrong with the family or anything like that.

17:15.234 --> 17:15.934
I'm blessed with

17:16.534 --> 17:20.237
Very, very happy kids getting ready to go back to school this week.

17:21.679 --> 17:31.867
And just a very harmonious little house full of dogs that love everybody and kids that get along pretty well and tend to not, you know,

17:32.668 --> 17:37.369
get too violent and a happy friend and wife.

17:37.590 --> 17:41.271
And so I wish that all for everyone.

17:42.071 --> 17:43.911
I wish that all for everyone.

17:43.972 --> 17:49.193
I can't believe it has been six years since we started this little mess and how far we've come.

17:51.134 --> 17:56.135
The sound that you hear in the background is actually that set, which I can switch to now.

17:57.396 --> 18:01.657
It is the set of the Star Trek Enterprise from the original television show.

18:02.404 --> 18:09.713
And this is just kind of the background sound because I want you to start, if you haven't seen my latest broadcasts, I'd really like you to go back and watch them.

18:10.894 --> 18:17.822
I haven't sworn very much in those broadcasts and I know that swearing is hard for a lot of people to deal with.

18:21.898 --> 18:30.385
I guess if you pay 14 bucks a seat and, you know, like $12 for a box of popcorn, blood and swearing is totally okay.

18:30.785 --> 18:42.035
But if you're watching a free stream on, I don't know, a free app or you're watching a free stream on YouTube or a free stream on Twitch, I guess swearing is a really big problem.

18:42.835 --> 18:49.018
But I'm gonna try and cut back on it as much as possible and try to stick to the biology that nobody seems to want to talk about.

18:49.038 --> 18:57.261
That intramuscular injection seems to be a rather archaic leftover from the late 1800s when people weren't that clever.

18:58.377 --> 19:01.802
and our understanding of our biology was pretty limited.

19:03.344 --> 19:14.018
And the technology of a hypodermic needle seemed like a miracle, not that dissimilar to how Brett Weinstein describes the, I don't know, concept of vaccination in 2023.

19:16.701 --> 19:36.508
So we are at a current and crucial crossroads right now because the temptation is to still believe that the red hat or the blue hat is the hat to have, to choose a team to root for, to assume that somewhere somebody is planning to save the republic.

19:37.529 --> 19:45.612
I can guarantee you that the best way to think about it is is that everybody that's in office right now is not saving the republic and then

19:46.192 --> 19:47.473
work backward from there.

19:47.513 --> 19:49.055
There might be like five people.

19:49.115 --> 19:50.336
We should identify them.

19:50.476 --> 19:53.079
I think for sure we should identify them.

19:53.139 --> 19:56.061
But none of them have been on PBS NewsHour.

19:56.122 --> 20:02.968
None of them get promoted on X. None of them are on CBS News or on Sunday morning.

20:04.609 --> 20:06.992
That is the absolute best way to look at it.

20:08.233 --> 20:08.773
How do I look?

20:08.813 --> 20:09.114
This way?

20:09.134 --> 20:09.234
Yeah.

20:10.735 --> 20:11.756
Hi, Captain, how are you?

20:12.196 --> 20:13.437
I have everything under control.

20:14.038 --> 20:18.161
The Romulans will be back in a... We'll be back in the... Sorry, so... Oh.

20:19.442 --> 20:20.402
Couldn't get my lines out.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.644
So that's the point.

20:22.704 --> 20:24.966
These guys have been on a set of their own.

20:25.986 --> 20:30.390
Not just a podcast set, but a whole reality set where they play a role.

20:31.390 --> 20:38.596
And because they've been so prominently strategically and military... Militarily... Precisely...

20:40.560 --> 20:54.492
with military precision promoted on social media, especially on the right, but also on the left, people are controlled by a limited set of discussions with a limited set of voices.

20:55.313 --> 21:04.781
And the illusion is created that those voices are rational because they agree with each other or they disagree with each other in a very coordinated way.

21:06.844 --> 21:22.611
And the best way to understand it is both the right and the left are watching a Star Trek episode or series that conforms to their best understanding of geopolitics and biology.

21:24.707 --> 21:41.139
And if they watch that, that show and they watch the blue version of this show, then, you know, viruses cause pandemics and dumb people cause pandemics to go much farther and misinformation causes more people to die.

21:41.199 --> 21:45.762
And if everybody would have just taken the vaccine, you know, nobody would have died.

21:47.987 --> 21:49.308
or maybe a very few people.

21:49.348 --> 21:52.189
And if you watch the red version of it, it's the exact opposite.

21:52.209 --> 21:58.232
The spike shot was a bioweapon, and Donald Trump is a patriot, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:58.652 --> 22:02.434
has been praying for 20 years, and the answer to his prayers is Donald Trump.

22:04.154 --> 22:11.598
And as long as all the people that are sitting in these chairs agree to read the script, then the show goes on.

22:12.078 --> 22:14.559
It doesn't even matter if the show doesn't make that much sense.

22:18.308 --> 22:32.894
And the same thing happens, of course, on a Star Trek set, but the Star Trek set is less consequential to our lives than the theaters that are being enacted, facilitated on social media.

22:34.095 --> 22:36.476
And mainstream media, that's the wickedness of this.

22:36.716 --> 22:38.317
It's everywhere, it's ubiquitous.

22:38.477 --> 22:43.639
It's even in the heads of state and in people in government.

22:43.679 --> 22:45.840
That's the malevolent part of this.

22:47.014 --> 22:52.313
It's not just rule by podcast, it's rule by coordinating with podcasts.

22:55.478 --> 23:00.420
And so might I encourage you gently to download the PeerTube app.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.561
You can get that right off of its own GitHub.

23:03.461 --> 23:07.402
You could download it from the Google Store or from the App Store.

23:07.923 --> 23:13.945
Although I do not know if either of those two providers add code to the things that they put on your phone.

23:13.965 --> 23:19.187
So if that's true, then you should seek it out in a different way, maybe from GitHub or somewhere else like that.

23:20.327 --> 23:22.768
You know, buyer beware or whatever it is.

23:22.828 --> 23:24.669
Be careful of your phone, obviously, but

23:25.903 --> 23:35.693
As far as I can tell, and as far as most people would agree, because these codes are open, simple, small, whatever, lots of people are having good luck with it.

23:35.733 --> 23:40.198
I think the only danger here is that you're using a very old phone for

23:42.054 --> 23:43.876
a wide variety of very good reasons.

23:43.896 --> 23:47.178
And then you may be limited in terms of being able to use this app or not.

23:47.218 --> 23:51.782
But if you have a relatively modern phone, I think you should have no problem with it.

23:51.842 --> 23:54.144
And I do think it works exceptionally well.

23:54.784 --> 23:58.847
So much better than if you go to this website here on its own.

23:58.907 --> 24:05.272
So you got to download the PeerTube app and then you put in a little garbley gook when you're looking for PeerTube platforms.

24:06.133 --> 24:12.746
And then when it doesn't find what you're starting to put into the search bar, it will offer you a button which says enter the URL.

24:13.307 --> 24:16.954
And that's where you put stream.gigaohm.bio and then Bob's your uncle.

24:17.566 --> 24:25.470
You have Gigo and Biological and Housatonic ITS on your phone when it happens, which is pretty cool.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.331
It's pretty dang cool.

24:27.952 --> 24:30.013
And no one else is offering that for free.

24:30.833 --> 24:31.794
Am I getting rich from it?

24:31.854 --> 24:34.535
No, I'm actually losing a lot of money every month right now.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.937
And so I'm gonna ask a few times.

24:37.717 --> 24:58.342
But if you have the ability to and find this useful information, especially maybe to help some of your friends on the left understand what happened to you, or maybe help some of your family and friends who are still fully caught up in the MAGA movement, in the MAHA movement, to free themselves from the trap.

24:59.622 --> 25:04.023
Ladies and gentlemen, go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to share it, find a way to support it.

25:04.063 --> 25:06.524
There was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

25:06.664 --> 25:08.824
They can be seen in many graphs if you look for it.

25:09.504 --> 25:18.307
And that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was visible in the population pyramid decades ago because there were really big families after World War II.

25:18.367 --> 25:23.928
And then they spent about a decade and a half or two trying to discourage those big families.

25:24.708 --> 25:28.710
or the trend of big families, and they succeeded.

25:28.750 --> 25:35.733
And that's why now when you go to an elementary school, you're not going to see a kid, a van drop off four kids.

25:36.113 --> 25:38.774
It just doesn't barely happen anymore.

25:39.995 --> 25:43.737
And your parents may have been from a family of six or eight

25:45.005 --> 25:55.969
And I know in Wisconsin, people that were families of 12 and had, you know, when they were babies, they had kids that were leaving for their own adult lives.

25:57.070 --> 26:00.491
So this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was timed.

26:01.468 --> 26:13.581
The whole narrative was timed with it so that a minimal amount of manslaughter and lies would be necessary to create the illusion of a novel spreading pathogen.

26:13.601 --> 26:21.569
The illusion of a novel spreading pathogen was created very specifically by just agreeing not to try and assess what was really going on.

26:22.470 --> 26:41.178
agreeing not to really try to assess what mistakes we were making in 2020 and how that might lead to a respiratory outbreak in places that would not be contagious, it would not be explainable by a correlation or non-correlation with a PCR test, but instead would be just

26:41.758 --> 26:55.051
the use of supplementary oxygen, the misuse of ventilators, the lack of antibiotic use, because anything that was even remotely considered on the list of possibles for COVID was assumed to be COVID and therefore viral.

26:56.272 --> 27:01.417
And that adjustment resulted in a tripling of the deaths by pneumonia.

27:05.475 --> 27:08.878
for about a two-year period and then a return right back to normal.

27:08.938 --> 27:19.448
And this statistical anomaly cannot be explained by a spontaneous spreading RNA-based pathogen for a nearly endless list of reasons.

27:21.029 --> 27:23.631
But a simple place to start is this list of reasons.

27:25.213 --> 27:31.759
The more parsimonious explanation for this is a combination of stupidity and malevolence, manslaughter and lies.

27:35.768 --> 27:43.835
And so we have this biology that we've all come to accept that racism and viruses can be endemic or go endemic.

27:45.036 --> 27:47.919
We have this idea that ideas can go viral.

27:49.700 --> 27:56.026
And these are all concepts which have no basis in reality, especially with regard to RNA.

27:56.947 --> 28:02.512
And so this ridiculously, irreducibly complex background of genetic signals

28:03.547 --> 28:08.992
was reduced to a very simple yes or no, non-specific PCR test.

28:09.032 --> 28:13.597
And the only question is, how much work did they put into creating the illusion?

28:13.657 --> 28:15.799
How much work did they put into it?

28:15.939 --> 28:21.144
Is it a, it is a pretty high fidelity illusion or is it a pretty low fidelity illusion?

28:21.184 --> 28:27.550
And quite frankly, we've never asked the right questions to even differentiate between those two different cons.

28:30.342 --> 28:42.345
I'm pretty sure that with placebo, they could compartmentalize any number of iterations of the transfection, any number of different versions of the transfection.

28:42.385 --> 28:58.309
They could geographically isolate them from one another with a vast background of placebo so that they could very carefully monitor in private, behind the scenes, those people that maybe happened to get this batch or another batch and get a great deal of data

28:58.869 --> 29:05.015
that would allow optimization of the final mass rollout that would have occurred maybe six months or eight months into the pandemic.

29:05.736 --> 29:11.321
And in the meantime, we were using their tests to find their ghosts, making ourselves feel like ghostbusters.

29:12.101 --> 29:15.144
And this is terrible because their ghosts were probably never real.

29:15.845 --> 29:24.373
It was probably just an irreducibly complex background on which these PCR tests could have never been high-fidelity diagnostics.

29:25.683 --> 29:38.733
And a lot of the people that are in front of your family and friends right now are still using in their own medical practices, you know, diagnostics that purport to differentiate between up to 16 or 17 different viral pathogens.

29:39.254 --> 29:40.815
And that is simply absurd.

29:41.576 --> 29:43.097
We cannot allow this to go on.

29:43.157 --> 29:48.321
We can't take our children to doctors who use those kinds of stupid diagnostics.

29:48.361 --> 29:49.362
We just simply can't.

29:52.560 --> 30:03.688
And so I do think that we have to be very precise in the language because the way that we can see that people are not making progress is through our own progress.

30:03.828 --> 30:08.732
Our own sharpening of our language shows us how dull their knives remain.

30:10.133 --> 30:16.558
At some point in time, we're cutting paper into shreds and they're still hardly even able to get the knife to cut through anything.

30:18.561 --> 30:21.162
because they haven't been sharpening their ideas.

30:21.222 --> 30:22.843
They haven't been learning.

30:23.543 --> 30:24.844
They've been reading a script.

30:27.045 --> 30:30.867
And so intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

30:30.947 --> 30:33.588
It's something that we need to force people to refute.

30:34.188 --> 30:38.450
Because if it is, then all this other discussion is surplus.

30:39.951 --> 30:42.512
Sorry, my cord is tangled up in my stool, my bad.

30:44.890 --> 30:58.287
If transfection of healthy humans was a crime, if we had actually told people what it was, then all the discussion of the impure RNA, DNA contaminants, all secondary to that then.

31:00.990 --> 31:14.683
And if RNA cannot pandemic, then all of this discussion of Ralph Baric and Peter Daszak and the diffuse proposal, which many of these DNA contamination people are engaging in, is also silly talk.

31:15.844 --> 31:20.209
And finally, if autism is a meaningless word by design,

31:21.311 --> 31:35.682
which has an ever-expanding umbrella of symptomologies that it can encompass and an ever-increasing depth of how it can be diagnosed, then vaccines can't cause autism.

31:37.684 --> 31:40.686
And so your family and friends were lured into a trap.

31:40.847 --> 31:43.008
We were all lured into a trap.

31:43.629 --> 31:46.251
And you have to have pity.

31:47.697 --> 31:57.891
for the people that were lured into this trap or were never going to come together as a society and as a nation and maybe as a world of the greater West.

31:58.558 --> 32:03.503
We're never going to be able to have that back again if we don't realize that both sides were fooled.

32:03.964 --> 32:14.054
Maybe one side was offered an easier narrative or a simpler narrative or a less challenging one.

32:14.414 --> 32:19.760
It doesn't matter what you want to add to it with regard to flavors to explain the fact that we were all fooled.

32:20.706 --> 32:31.153
And even my Scooby-Doo link at GigaOMBiological.com is not really a sufficient level of confession because I got fooled by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:31.193 --> 32:34.175
and the people at CHD and the people at ICANN as well.

32:35.216 --> 32:44.362
That Health Freedom Movement was a fine-tuned military operation that's going to have another live event in Austin in September.

32:46.052 --> 32:47.993
This is no joke, ladies and gentlemen.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.934
America is still under attack.

32:50.394 --> 32:52.756
It's still being ripped apart by these frauds.

32:53.276 --> 33:05.203
And the worst part is, is that the face plant that we are being set up for, or our family and friends are being set up for, the Trump voters, the health freedom people are being set up for, the face plant hasn't even begun.

33:11.394 --> 33:13.455
because this is for the grandchildren of earth.

33:13.495 --> 33:14.555
They are not playing.

33:14.595 --> 33:18.037
When this hammer comes down, it's gonna come down hard.

33:18.097 --> 33:37.065
And so we need as many of us as possible to be succinctly saying that both sides were fooled and that maybe the nastier version of the theater was aimed at the conservative side, but that's really, it's just, it's splitting hairs at this point because we were all attacked.

33:38.785 --> 33:40.206
Because this is for all the marbles.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.242
Infection fatality rate.

34:01.482 --> 34:03.263
Totalitarian protocols, right?

34:03.584 --> 34:05.145
I mean, narcissists, essentially.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.667
Anti-vaxxers have any grounds in this topic.

34:08.188 --> 34:09.589
Your parents or your job.

34:09.869 --> 34:11.411
Because the Amish aren't vaccinated.

34:11.891 --> 34:13.793
They're not trained doctors, right?

34:16.957 --> 34:17.457
What are we doing?

34:18.298 --> 34:20.840
That the hospitals are being paid to give, right?

34:20.880 --> 34:22.001
They're getting bonuses.

34:22.021 --> 34:25.204
You can't find an autistic kid who is unvaccinated.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.324
Very, very rare.

34:26.585 --> 34:28.346
In the Amish community, very, very rare.

34:28.586 --> 34:32.489
People really fall for it, especially if it has that anti-establishment fight to it.

34:32.810 --> 34:33.530
Well, here we are.

34:33.790 --> 34:35.872
It's 2025 and it still needs to be said.

34:36.352 --> 34:38.054
Vaccines do not cause autism.

34:40.732 --> 34:48.555
And so I hope you can see how much of a trap that is because if Debunk the Funk, who I briefly was

34:49.645 --> 34:57.051
talking to me and trying to, I streamed with him once back when I was still big time lab leak and big time lost in this thing.

34:58.032 --> 35:14.705
And Professor Dave, who I just happened to get fed by YouTube's algorithm and think, wow, how is it that this guy has been doing such devastating content on these same people that I've been trying to convince like, what's going on here?

35:15.649 --> 35:23.956
And now you see that in September, they're actually making a show on stage together, which is, I don't know, it's pretty remarkable.

35:24.977 --> 35:26.157
I'm just kind of shocked.

35:27.138 --> 35:34.564
And somehow or another, the last layers of this are peeling back.

35:34.644 --> 35:40.369
I mean, the last sort of people that were encouraging me to, I don't know, keep

35:41.621 --> 35:47.565
doing what I thought was right are now absolutely freaking out and disavowing me.

35:49.167 --> 35:56.812
And it wouldn't surprise me, for example, if some of them would be in the chat today, right now, because over the weekend, a few people really flipped out.

35:58.413 --> 36:08.881
And I don't know what they're flipping out about because I have 3,000 followers and I have like 98 subscribers and I'm not a danger to anybody.

36:09.802 --> 36:21.672
Um, I don't, I don't really know why, uh, other than I, they don't want this stuff said they don't want the Steve Bannon, Joe Rogan, Joy Behar.

36:22.412 --> 36:22.873
I don't know.

36:22.913 --> 36:24.274
They don't want that exposed.

36:24.314 --> 36:30.679
They don't want the, the idea that, you know, American government could be, you could just elect all good people.

36:31.981 --> 36:45.090
Um, we could just try really hard to repair our government over the next 10 years and try to find and identify patriots outside of these networks and see if we can change something locally.

36:45.150 --> 36:56.958
But the idea that we have to burn this thing all down and that, and, and, and I don't understand why somebody wouldn't want to save their family and friends that were fooled like I was.

36:57.018 --> 37:01.421
And that's why I feel like I've got a little tiny job, even if it's only a few people.

37:03.566 --> 37:06.487
I want to help people see through Robert F. Kennedy jr.

37:06.547 --> 37:15.610
In this this show while the show is still on Because once the show is over and it's exposed for the the fraud that it is.

37:15.670 --> 37:18.551
I think a lot of these people I Don't know.

37:18.591 --> 37:19.652
I don't know what's gonna happen.

37:19.692 --> 37:20.712
It could be very ugly.

37:20.792 --> 37:25.794
I don't know maybe maybe but Somehow or another I don't know.

37:25.814 --> 37:30.416
I don't think they need ugly anymore most people will just stay in their house as long as the Internet's on and

37:31.455 --> 37:55.978
So I don't know what's happening in the real world, but I do know that the last few people That needed to call me Stalin or or or something like that have done so and here we are Steve Kirsch is gonna be on stage with professor Dave and and Pierre Corey and and debunk the funk Dan Wilson and Jonathan Cooley and

37:57.001 --> 38:06.330
Um, I don't know, I guess it's from some, from one of his three, a few of his 3000 followers is still not quite doing it right.

38:06.370 --> 38:10.394
You know, he's just still a loser who swears too much or something like that.

38:10.434 --> 38:10.774
I don't know.

38:10.874 --> 38:18.342
I don't know what's going on, but I do know that the people behind this have gotten us to believe, thank God for Donald Trump.

38:18.382 --> 38:21.304
They've gotten us to believe the DOD is deploying a kill box.

38:22.145 --> 38:27.213
that the spike shot was a bioweapon and that pandemics did not occur naturally.

38:27.273 --> 38:32.000
That's where the crazy right in America is being taken.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.724
And that's the bubble that they're in on Rumble.

38:34.764 --> 38:36.607
That's the bubble they're in on Joe Rogan.

38:36.647 --> 38:37.308
And they're happy there.

38:38.942 --> 38:44.746
And in the meantime, on the far, far, far left, you have people thinking something very different.

39:09.322 --> 39:13.824
Stephanie Sy has more on her mission to shape the Trump administration in her vision.

39:14.925 --> 39:17.326
The state of Minnesota is a Somali a**hole.

39:17.386 --> 39:37.174
I don't have any sympathy for self-aiding... So one of the things that you can help yourself see if you're still fooled by Donald Trump and you're still fooled by Tucker Carlson, you're still fooled by all of these performers, you can see that this woman was collaborating with Sasha Latupova's daughter, Soph,

39:38.066 --> 39:43.029
who had a million followers on YouTube in 2019 and threatened to kill the YouTube CEO.

39:44.090 --> 39:49.313
Did videos where she was wearing a hijab telling people to go kill the cops in the UK.

39:51.388 --> 40:05.075
And that woman's mom is now very intimately associated with all of these people behind RFK and behind Trump and promoted by Steve Bannon and CHD and all the people that have fooled the far right in America.

40:05.496 --> 40:17.482
So if you wanna save your family and friends, your grandma and grandpa, your aunt and uncle who were fooled into this movement and really believe that there's some 5D chess going, this is the place to send them.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.008
Because I too was pretty fooled by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:22.068 --> 40:24.254
and his elaborate staff and his high salary.

40:25.097 --> 40:26.838
and I feel like a jackass for it.

40:27.299 --> 40:36.266
But this woman is very easy to see through, but it's not the seeing through it that the PBS NewsHour wants you to see through.

40:36.306 --> 40:50.778
What you need to see through is how she connects this to a much longer time horizon operation, many more years deep with a much longer and much more, a plan with much more foresight.

40:52.455 --> 41:00.901
And that's what I think is important for us to show our kids so that they understand that the pandemic wasn't just doing the right thing.

41:01.041 --> 41:07.205
It was something that was thrown at us, aimed at us, and it was pretty malevolent.

41:07.285 --> 41:09.587
And it's still ongoing.

41:09.627 --> 41:11.148
We're still getting hit by that hose.

41:12.885 --> 41:30.552
liberal jews we need to be focused on america first not black people first she regularly utters disgusting garbage that's how republican senator tom tillis once described the self-styled journalist laura loomer all of the like meritless dei shiniquas talk the same way it's very obnoxious

41:30.652 --> 41:36.598
But despite her detractors, the online influencer seems to wield real influence, and she knows it.

41:36.738 --> 41:38.760
I got multiple people fired this week.

41:39.361 --> 41:48.930
Observers say it's not a coincidence that more than a dozen high-ranking officials in the Trump administration have either lost their jobs or had their nominations revoked.

41:49.110 --> 42:00.605
Now one of the things that I'm trying to make the argument of here is that what this could be is an orchestrated theater which is designed to make it seem like people like her on social media do have influence.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.901
that they can change things.

42:03.461 --> 42:16.210
And so that this could be used as evidence to influence other people to do things they're told, because there's a threat that social media could be used against them, not that dissimilar to how Laura Loomer runs the Trump administration.

42:16.250 --> 42:26.316
And every one of these things, from the toilet paper in February of 2020, to the, oh my gosh, Elon Musk saved free speech by buying Twitter.

42:26.376 --> 42:29.018
It's all the same kind of theater.

42:30.031 --> 42:32.293
where what you think is happening is not happening.

42:32.333 --> 42:37.697
And it's taken me, it's just coffee, taken me a long time to see through this.

42:38.417 --> 42:40.479
And I'm still very confident.

42:40.519 --> 42:50.326
I don't see it clearly yet, but I am able to step back far enough to see that, for example, Brett Weinstein didn't even need to be in the signal chat with me.

42:51.907 --> 42:56.430
It could have been someone using his phone or a phone claiming to be Brett Weinstein.

42:57.469 --> 43:00.830
And so maybe I thought I was in a signal chat with Brett Weinstein.

43:00.870 --> 43:05.631
Maybe 10,000 people thought they were in a signal chat with Brett Weinstein.

43:05.912 --> 43:09.233
How many signal chats do you think Ryan Cole was in?

43:10.553 --> 43:14.294
If he was in your signal chat, does that mean he wasn't in anyone else's signal chat?

43:14.674 --> 43:19.656
Is it possible that signal could be used to make it seem like Ryan Cole was in 10,000 signal chats?

43:23.618 --> 43:40.369
Is it possible that it could seem like Ryan Cole is direct messaging thousands or hundreds of thousands of people on Instagram, but each one of those people on Instagram thinks they're special because Ryan Cole couldn't possibly answer everybody's direct message?

43:43.151 --> 44:04.056
This is where this illusion starts to become very dark, because everybody has presumed that, you know, their secret signal group, or their, you know, got permission for that private telegram group, resulted in them having access to something, when in reality, the same clown show could have been performed in hundreds of signal chats.

44:04.736 --> 44:15.366
The same set of circumstances and acting circumstances and backstories could be used in tens or even hundreds of signal chats.

44:18.249 --> 44:24.235
Never mind what might be potentially done with chatbots if they are good enough or honed enough or trained well enough.

44:25.942 --> 44:37.631
So here we are again, being told by the other side, PBS NewsHour, that Laura Loomer is effectively a powerful force on social media.

44:37.671 --> 44:46.317
You could roll your eyes and say that conservative social media is so gay, but they are telling you that on social media, she has power.

44:48.419 --> 44:53.623
And so the enchantment is absolutely seamless from PBS NewsHour all the way to Rumble.

44:56.517 --> 45:18.937
And once you start to see that it only takes a certain percentage of the actors to be a part of that seamless theater, then you can see how easy it is that Trump derangement syndrome was orchestrated by the same coordinated effort that the ridiculous ideas of Trump genius and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:18.997 --> 45:22.280
genius was orchestrated on the right.

45:24.660 --> 45:27.501
after Loomer questioned their loyalty to the president.

45:28.162 --> 45:31.903
You know, you think he's all these terrible things that all of his detractors call him.

45:32.464 --> 45:33.744
Why do you want to work for him?

45:34.945 --> 45:36.225
Aren't I doing you a favor?

45:36.245 --> 45:41.007
She doesn't like things going on that she thinks are bad for the country.

45:41.508 --> 45:41.908
I like her.

45:42.348 --> 45:46.790
The woman Trump calls a patriot got her start in media with Project Veritas.

45:48.211 --> 45:56.184
known for using deceptive tactics, including undercover videotaping, often to make false or exaggerated claims about its target.

45:56.204 --> 45:58.668
So, of course, remember what you just Veritas.

45:58.728 --> 46:02.575
That's the place, of course, where supposedly the defuse proposal was released.

46:03.686 --> 46:06.568
where O'Keefe media is now broken off from.

46:06.628 --> 46:16.976
I mean, this, it's all a very obvious set of admissions, but from the left, it just, it looks like, wow, my neighbors are dumb.

46:17.196 --> 46:20.118
Wow, it's unbelievable how dumb my neighbors are.

46:20.158 --> 46:24.641
And we need to change that as Americans or we are gonna be in trouble.

46:25.061 --> 46:26.582
They need to see that this is a,

46:27.423 --> 46:29.364
This was a military operation.

46:29.404 --> 46:34.868
Those people aren't spontaneously popular on any of those platforms.

46:37.289 --> 46:37.570
Forgets.

46:37.590 --> 46:38.490
How can I help you, Laura?

46:39.111 --> 46:45.875
I just have some questions about... To get to where she is today is... It's truly mind-boggling.

46:46.243 --> 46:49.164
David Gilbert has covered Loomer's rise for Wired.

46:49.544 --> 46:58.888
I don't think anyone would ever have guessed 10 years ago, starting out with kind of gotcha clips for Project Veritas, that she would end up being where she is today.

46:58.908 --> 47:02.950
In 2017, she stormed the stage of a controversial Shakespeare performance in New York.

47:10.783 --> 47:16.025
In the production, Julius Caesar, who's assassinated, bore President Trump's likeness.

47:16.285 --> 47:18.546
Now, isn't that an interesting little thing there?

47:18.627 --> 47:23.509
She went on stage when Julius Caesar was dressed like Donald Trump.

47:24.029 --> 47:31.832
And of course, you know, Julius Caesar gets stabbed by all of his Senate members or whatever, which is not, it's strange, right?

47:31.872 --> 47:32.993
Because there was also this

47:33.813 --> 48:03.091
uh thing with Kathy Griffin and there was also this thing with Snoop Dogg's video and so it's all kind of sort of similar in a way in sort of a can't you see it yet kind of way um that's that's pretty nuts and that's in 2017 the same year that Bret Weinstein had his his big burndown at Evergreen so this is this is her interrupting interrupting the trump dressed trumped

48:03.471 --> 48:06.433
themed Caesar stabbing on stage.

48:06.853 --> 48:08.074
And of course, there's video.

48:09.014 --> 48:16.758
That got her arrested, but it also more importantly got her on the radar of figures like Donald Trump and the wider MAGA movement.

48:17.739 --> 48:21.601
Her ambush interviews put Trump's political opponents on the spot.

48:21.921 --> 48:23.642
What happened to your 33,000 emails?

48:23.742 --> 48:27.344
You're going to get prosecuted, Comey.

48:27.444 --> 48:32.747
Rashida, are you willing to admit as a congresswoman that Hamas is a terrorist organization?

48:33.047 --> 48:43.836
In 2018, after unleashing a tirade of Islamophobic tweets about then-Congresswoman-elect Ilhan Omar, she was banned from the platform for hateful conduct.

48:44.436 --> 48:46.858
Loomer handcuffed herself to Twitter's headquarters.

48:46.918 --> 49:02.511
Remember, again, I'm suggesting that banning people and then publicly bitching about it, banning people and then reporting it on PBS NewsHour, banning people and then allowing them to whine about it for two hours on Tucker Carlson's new platform is not really censorship.

49:04.781 --> 49:07.603
And so they're just telling you right here, again, what are they saying?

49:07.903 --> 49:09.144
The censorship happened?

49:09.624 --> 49:10.505
Where did it happen?

49:10.605 --> 49:11.145
On Twitter?

49:11.485 --> 49:14.467
Well, does that mean that we should fight for Twitter and make it free?

49:19.610 --> 49:25.013
She was also banned from Lyft, Uber, Instagram, and several online banking platforms.

49:25.474 --> 49:27.055
My life is ruined!

49:27.375 --> 49:30.897
Does anybody understand how ruined my life is?

49:31.537 --> 49:32.078
I'm sick of it!

49:32.884 --> 49:36.225
What she really wanted to do was get you.

49:36.285 --> 49:37.926
But see, that's not a real person.

49:39.327 --> 49:42.828
You can't look at that image and think that's a real person anymore.

49:42.988 --> 49:44.909
I get it, how we were fooled.

49:45.809 --> 50:01.256
But now as a savvy user of social media and understanding that almost all of the content that served to you is programmed to be served to you because they think it will get you here or get you to the other side of this.

50:02.532 --> 50:08.079
then you don't see somebody just doing crazy stuff for views anymore.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.183
You see a very scripted actor here.

50:14.360 --> 50:34.093
attention of Trump and his base by basically going one step further than anyone else in terms of making extreme claims, making up conspiracies and posting openly racist and Islamophobic content online simply in order to get clicks, likes and follow.

50:34.113 --> 50:43.700
And so if we start to say that, you know, racism and Islamophobia and transphobia are things that we can't tolerate anymore in the public square,

50:44.980 --> 50:48.001
then social media will be patrolled.

50:48.121 --> 50:59.565
They can institute some form of ID so that they can enforce that and ban people just like they did before, but now under the pretense that these things are not to be tolerated.

50:59.645 --> 51:02.666
Now that's very small, but

51:03.206 --> 51:07.409
PeerTube and Soapbox may actually be outside of that.

51:07.549 --> 51:15.155
PeerTube, if it's just my videos and just my servers and just my website, could, I think, be argued to be free speech.

51:16.388 --> 51:25.571
and my own free speech, whereas using YouTube or using some big platform with all kinds of extra features like Twitch has, maybe that's different.

51:26.411 --> 51:36.215
But when everybody can set up a server and everybody can get a web page or set up a web page, then it's hard for me to imagine that you're

51:36.895 --> 51:40.337
I guess your internet provider could require you to log in.

51:40.377 --> 51:45.079
And in that case, Verizon might not serve up my website.

51:45.119 --> 51:55.024
All of those possibilities are there, but the bottom line is that what we are doing with PeerTube and Soapbox is as cutting edge as whatever else is out there.

51:55.044 --> 51:56.145
Nobody else is doing it.

51:57.264 --> 52:04.406
Providing PeerTube without login with an app is unlike anything that anyone else is doing.

52:04.446 --> 52:08.768
And our soapbox is essentially just TruthSocial or BlueSky.

52:09.448 --> 52:19.191
And so the existence of TruthSocial and BlueSky are both admissions that these kinds of federated, decentralized platforms are probably pretty viable.

52:20.902 --> 52:36.157
It's just that right now, of course, there is a concerted effort, a militarily concerted effort to not allow that to happen, to make sure that the hypothetical public square that people fight for is social media, and it's not the right to have their own.

52:37.768 --> 52:42.231
And I think that this is something that's a message that no one else has right now.

52:42.271 --> 52:56.479
And the only reason why we're here is because of six years of struggling to figure it out, hoping that one of these people would listen to us and never realizing that you can text the cast of Star Trek all you want, you're never gonna change their lines.

52:57.199 --> 53:05.224
You can text the Star Trek cast all you want that something is incongruent because the Romulans wouldn't do that and it's not gonna change anything.

53:06.766 --> 53:13.269
But social media has allowed us to be fooled into believing that we were watching a soap opera that we could affect.

53:15.050 --> 53:16.971
And this is not a soap opera we can affect.

53:17.011 --> 53:23.534
This is a soap opera that is militarily honed to drive us apart as a nation.

53:24.314 --> 53:25.835
And we need to break that.

53:27.731 --> 53:28.391
on social media.

53:28.912 --> 53:33.733
A fighter is running for Congress, and her name is Laura Loomer.

53:33.933 --> 53:46.898
Two runs for Congress followed, with a million dollars in financial support from the likes of Alex Jones, Roger Stone and Matt Gaetz, fellow bombastic personalities and conspiracists on the radical right.

53:47.679 --> 53:51.360
She refused to accept her 2022 primary loss.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.081
I'm not conceding, because if I'm a winner,

53:54.696 --> 53:55.757
election denial.

53:55.817 --> 54:03.945
It's funny that some people in the chat think that if you weren't fooled by Laura Loomer, you're some kind of really smart, insightful people person.

54:05.266 --> 54:13.454
Instead of, you know, not being able to see that social media fooled a lot of people and Laura Loomer doesn't have to have fooled anybody really.

54:15.347 --> 54:18.089
Tim Pool doesn't have to fool anybody, really.

54:18.609 --> 54:22.812
What they have to do is say things that are provocative and stick in people's minds.

54:22.953 --> 54:27.796
That's like, Tim, is Nick Fuentes influencing a lot of people that really matter?

54:28.196 --> 54:31.038
Has anybody having trouble seeing through Nick Fuentes?

54:31.499 --> 54:36.903
But the point of it is, is to understand that social media has its layers and there are obvious

54:37.423 --> 54:48.912
frauds, and then there are all kinds of people under and above those people that are just as fraudulent that because of extreme training and professionalism are much better than her.

54:50.573 --> 55:06.665
I wonder if Janet Reno in the audience has ever considered the possibility that it's only on the background of people like these that these other people have the legit ring that they do, where somebody might say that, I don't know, Hunter Biden, if he wouldn't swear, might sound a little bit like Churchill.

55:07.864 --> 55:16.487
That's the kind of dumb shit that happens when you use social media as some kind of a tool for intelligent learning.

55:16.667 --> 55:23.010
...inspired by Donald Trump, who Loomer redoubled her support for in the wake of her electoral losses.

55:23.750 --> 55:30.593
During the 2024 campaign, Loomer posted, if Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry.

55:33.317 --> 55:35.899
Now the NIH smells like curry.

55:36.219 --> 55:37.760
Holy shit, that's funny.

55:37.780 --> 55:38.521
Wow.

55:38.561 --> 55:38.661
Wow.

55:44.699 --> 55:47.901
A fantastic woman, a true patriot, Laura Loomer.

55:48.222 --> 55:54.406
Trump mentioned her in fond terms on the stump, and she was spotted getting on his campaign plane last fall.

55:54.867 --> 55:56.508
But he's never given her a job.

55:57.088 --> 55:58.849
Still, she fights for him.

55:59.210 --> 56:04.414
I'm starting to have some serious doubts about who is in control in the Oval Office, because

56:05.094 --> 56:12.717
I have just seen so many instances of Donald Trump giving orders and then his orders not being respected by his.

56:12.857 --> 56:26.301
What you should be seeing and marveling at is that PBS NewsHour is showing Laura Loomer to the left as a legitimate representation of the conservative right, whatever that is in America.

56:26.921 --> 56:28.162
That's what's screwed up here.

56:29.620 --> 56:32.842
Not that somebody could always see through Laura Loomer.

56:33.443 --> 56:37.946
What a kind of weird and childish thing to post in the chat in 2025.

56:38.286 --> 56:40.308
Of course we can see through Laura Loomer.

56:41.048 --> 56:45.071
The more stunning thing is, is that PBS NewsHour can't seem to see through it.

56:45.131 --> 56:48.594
That apparently they're telling us that Donald Trump can't see through it.

56:48.914 --> 56:52.417
And we're taking that seriously instead of reporting that as stupid?

56:56.007 --> 57:10.178
We need Americans to wake up to the fact that PBS NewsHour is just as dumb as Alex Jones right now for the simple fact that they're reporting an Alex Jones level influencer as having some real effect on human history.

57:10.218 --> 57:14.061
And it's absurd, except for they're all part of the same theater.

57:18.236 --> 57:24.643
After an Oval Office meeting with Loomer in April, the president fired six National Security Council officials.

57:28.679 --> 57:32.520
And, sometimes, I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody.

57:33.340 --> 57:35.221
I listen to everybody that I make a decision.

57:35.241 --> 57:52.185
STEPHANIE SY Even when the president doesn't give it, Loomer has taken credit for the firings or resignations of more than a dozen people, including his nominee for surgeon general, the top lawyer at the National Security Agency, and the vaccine chief at the FDA.

57:52.725 --> 57:57.306
I thought the Surgeon General was that other chick that Callie means or Casey means.

57:57.346 --> 57:58.587
I thought they got rid of this one.

57:58.627 --> 57:59.607
So isn't that funny?

58:00.187 --> 58:06.329
All this shell games that they're playing, they don't even know anyone and Maha's even paying attention anymore because it's such a joke.

58:07.529 --> 58:14.071
And that is very easy for the PBS NewsHour to portray as incompetence to the left.

58:15.014 --> 58:17.655
And so the right in America is being set up.

58:18.475 --> 58:41.063
And while you're over there waiting for Steve Kirsch to debate, you know, Professor Dave, or while you're over there, I don't know, watching Kim Iverson solve the puzzle or trying to follow Whitney Webb, they are setting you up for some serious face planting and crow eating feasts.

58:42.037 --> 58:46.240
At the very, very bare minimum, there's going to be crow eating here.

58:48.241 --> 58:50.102
Was rehired last weekend.

58:50.383 --> 58:51.964
I'm not working for President Trump.

58:52.044 --> 58:53.805
I'm not getting paid by President Trump.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.526
I'm not in the Trump White House.

58:55.726 --> 58:57.327
I wasn't even on the Trump campaign.

58:57.888 --> 59:06.673
And yet I feel like every single day it's a full time job just to make sure the president is protected and that he's receiving the information that he needs to receive.

59:07.114 --> 59:08.094
A full time job.

59:08.415 --> 59:09.075
No one hired.

59:09.155 --> 59:13.879
It's a full-time job to keep the president protected, right, because he was shot at a few times.

59:13.899 --> 59:22.046
This is really remarkable how the barbecued chicken just has a few simple ingredients, and they keep hitting it every time.

59:22.086 --> 59:23.967
And that's why it turns out so damn good.

59:24.147 --> 59:27.010
For the PBS NewsHour, I'm Stephanie Sy.

59:41.019 --> 59:42.200
I find it quite remarkable.

59:42.360 --> 59:42.680
I don't know.

59:42.800 --> 59:51.243
I think it's pretty cool because those people actually believe that the Trump administration is destroying our democracy and is about to gut our Constitution.

59:54.105 --> 59:59.407
I think that opening the Constitution to amendment and revision is a dumb idea because

01:00:00.652 --> 01:00:04.914
You have one plan, and the people that actually do it will have another plan, so it'll never go well.

01:00:05.815 --> 01:00:08.216
COVID was a public health disaster of dumb people.

01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:11.477
That's what the people on the left think.

01:00:12.298 --> 01:00:14.999
And pandemics happen, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:15.019 --> 01:00:15.779
is killing kids.

01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:17.780
That's what they think.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.023
That's what the PBS NewsHour, that's what these left people on the view are saying and thinking.

01:00:25.124 --> 01:00:27.485
And there are shorts and TikTok videos to back it up.

01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:31.019
So you need to be aware of where we are.

01:00:31.039 --> 01:00:37.283
You need to be acutely aware of where we are and where we're about to land because

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:41.727
I don't think a lot of people on the Trump voting side are aware.

01:00:42.268 --> 01:00:49.610
I don't think a lot of rural America is aware of where New York City is or where Washington DC is or California is.

01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:59.054
And that's one of the things that somebody got in a very big argument with me about over the weekend is that apparently I don't understand how bad it is in the cities.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:02.516
I don't understand how bad it is with the left.

01:01:02.616 --> 01:01:06.237
They're about ready to, I guess, start shooting people.

01:01:08.223 --> 01:01:12.445
And that kind of, I don't have any space for that.

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:14.726
I don't have any solution for that.

01:01:14.786 --> 01:01:22.830
If that's really where this is going, then I think the best way out is to discourage both sides from assuming that they are certainly right.

01:01:23.629 --> 01:01:31.312
Which is what I think I've been doing for a very long time and yet somehow or another I still manage to lose subscribers one at a time.

01:01:31.332 --> 01:01:33.553
I guess for swearing too much.

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:36.494
I think we should swear about this.

01:01:36.714 --> 01:01:38.175
I think we should swear about this.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.216
This is nasty.

01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:56.668
I think we should swear about the background that has been misconstrued as spread but most importantly I think we should be swearing about this because this is a biological signal that is so big and so obvious and the fact that nobody will talk about it

01:01:57.793 --> 01:02:15.665
that nobody can explain it but me, that this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, if it was timed appropriately, would be very, very easy to use to create the illusion of a pandemic, and very little sculpting with manslaughter and lies would be necessary.

01:02:17.318 --> 01:02:26.987
I've created a cartoon above my head to show you a very simple diagram of a background of genetic information composed of green signals and purple signals.

01:02:27.627 --> 01:02:38.517
And you could use a relatively nonspecific PCR test to misconstrue the green signal, for which we have no data before the pandemic, as something that just showed up.

01:02:39.438 --> 01:02:43.261
And then anybody using this test would report that they found the red

01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:49.527
DNA signal, the red RNA signal, when in reality they were finding the green signal that was always there.

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:59.538
And then at the start of the Omicron, they could say that, well, the PCR test stopped working because the Omicron has had so many mutations in its spike protein.

01:03:00.018 --> 01:03:02.902
So the new tests now find Omicron.

01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:19.326
And so with a very simple orchestration with two reliable background signals previously characterized before the pandemic, it would be relatively simple for somebody like Kevin McKernan to design a set of diagnostics that would pick up first

01:03:19.986 --> 01:03:34.117
background signal green, and then later, whenever he was cued, his company could roll out an advanced test, a modified test to find the new phylogenetic ancestor, the purple one.

01:03:34.137 --> 01:03:41.343
When in reality, the green one and the purple one were always there, and all they needed to do was trick you for a little while and tell you the green one was the red one.

01:03:42.183 --> 01:03:43.705
You know, the new one, the novel one.

01:03:46.427 --> 01:03:48.829
And time that little theater with this

01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:52.783
anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:04:00.087
It is shocking how annoying it is that repeating this is considered a car wreck.

01:04:01.108 --> 01:04:05.011
Apparently my last two or three weeks of streams have been nothing but car wrecks.

01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:08.293
And all I'm really doing is repeating this over and over again.

01:04:08.373 --> 01:04:13.536
This signal explains 90% of whatever they've called the pandemic.

01:04:13.576 --> 01:04:17.439
Essentially just gave them balls on T's that they could hit.

01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:27.584
And so this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is really the problem.

01:04:30.646 --> 01:04:43.716
This is the problem that they solved with Denny Rancor, because Denny Rancor made graphs where you could see the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, but Denny Rancor couldn't see anything in those graphs.

01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:54.378
Instead, he said it was poverty level or household income or serious mental illness and tried to say that there's no evidence of spread.

01:04:54.778 --> 01:04:57.421
If there's no evidence of spread, then what's killing people?

01:04:58.202 --> 01:05:00.585
And he didn't explicitly explain it.

01:05:00.665 --> 01:05:03.208
He explicitly said he does not know.

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:05.851
That's not his job to figure things out.

01:05:05.871 --> 01:05:07.052
He's not an investigator.

01:05:07.433 --> 01:05:09.135
He just works on numbers and stuff.

01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:14.855
And so he wasn't aware of the all anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:23.602
He's not really able to explain how he calculates baseline here in light of the fact that there's an anticipated, there's a rise here, you can see it.

01:05:25.023 --> 01:05:28.646
But he's not able to explain how he calculated his baseline here.

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:34.131
He just says, yeah, it's in my figures, you know, 105 figures in a paper.

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:38.415
105 figures in a paper that's supposed to explain something to do with this.

01:05:40.754 --> 01:05:42.074
And we thought he was legitimate.

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:57.539
I thought he was legitimate until he showed up in Romania on stage with somebody like Steve Hatfill and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and holy crap, Brett Weinstein and Nick Hudson and fricking Jessica Rose for goodness sakes.

01:05:57.919 --> 01:05:59.499
And, and Ryan Cole.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.400
Look at this picture.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.380
It's just a rubbish.

01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:05.221
It's junk.

01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:21.442
community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap, trying to screen their employees and their nursing homes for something that's not gonna turn positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:27.566
I said, dude, you need these capture antigen things.

01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:30.828
Now remember what I'm trying to explain here is that these people

01:06:32.011 --> 01:06:36.554
were put on podcasts that were put in front of people that needed to see these people.

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:42.859
Your family and friends maybe didn't need to see these people because Tony Fauci told them all they needed to know.

01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:46.081
Rochelle Walensky told them all they needed to know.

01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:50.684
And because they're pretty trusting people, that's all the farther they investigated.

01:06:50.764 --> 01:06:57.129
But people that went farther, critically thinking citizens that put in the right search terms were shown these people.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:04.602
And these people were either put in place beforehand or recruited during and accepted the script.

01:07:04.682 --> 01:07:13.205
This guy was in Rhodesia running anthrax vaccines or Ebola vaccines at the same time that Meryl Nass was in Africa.

01:07:14.606 --> 01:07:20.868
In the same congressional hearings as Robert Malone and Veer Sharab and Meryl Nass.

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:22.769
This is not by accident.

01:07:22.809 --> 01:07:24.529
It's because it's a long con.

01:07:24.649 --> 01:07:26.030
It's a very long con.

01:07:28.283 --> 01:07:37.362
it is the most advanced psychological operation on earth and it doesn't just have social media but a lot of it has to do with social media and the

01:07:39.907 --> 01:07:54.031
The motivation to make social media the sort of superior medium of control, apart from newspapers and TV and governments and government propaganda.

01:07:54.491 --> 01:08:00.352
Now they're using social media in a way that was never possible with TV and with magazines and such.

01:08:00.832 --> 01:08:03.013
And in that interview, of course, he says that

01:08:03.573 --> 01:08:14.036
him and Robert Malone went to Rome in 2021 and they didn't have vaccine passports even though in 2021 Robert Malone said he was fully vaccinated with two shots of Moderna so I guess he forgot his card.

01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:25.159
And they were on stage in 2023 with all of these other people that have fooled a lot of people on the right in America and a lot of people on the right in other countries and that

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:36.744
organized malevolence needs to be exposed so that we can save as many of those people as possible from the set up and scripted humiliation to come.

01:08:39.106 --> 01:08:42.288
Because there is a scripted humiliation to come.

01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:43.589
This guy's not real.

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:48.892
And at some point in time, anybody that's defending him on social media may very well be on a list.

01:08:48.952 --> 01:08:50.073
Maybe they already are.

01:08:52.274 --> 01:08:53.915
Maybe that's part of the operation.

01:08:55.316 --> 01:09:05.883
But you need to see that your family and friends could forgive you, could understand if you could succinctly explain how malevolent the trap was.

01:09:07.424 --> 01:09:12.687
This guy's been operating behind the scenes since David Hohn was sleeping on his couch.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:17.670
This guy's operating behind the scenes since Ebola and Zika.

01:09:20.154 --> 01:09:22.196
This guy was vetted for U.S.

01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:28.000
Emirate, according to his interview with Stephen Hadfield and Tommy.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:48.935
This guy's been around the world with the same people for six consecutive COVID international summits, where they convinced a lot of dissident people in a lot of different countries to go along with this narrative that the mRNA is a bad idea, that they made mistakes with the lockdown, but there was a virus.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.720
And it's probably a lab leak.

01:09:52.661 --> 01:09:56.922
And that is the narrative that's still putting shots in people's arms.

01:09:57.422 --> 01:10:02.223
That's the narrative that's still getting parents to be bullied into taking the measles shot.

01:10:02.263 --> 01:10:08.605
That's the narrative that was still being used on my kids last week when we went to the doctor and I told you the story.

01:10:09.845 --> 01:10:16.626
They took my 13 year old in a separate room and asked him once again, do you know, do you need to hear something about vaccines?

01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:18.487
Cause your parents don't really know.

01:10:19.742 --> 01:10:21.343
And are you a boy or a girl?

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:42.782
And so this shit is very, very real, but it's real in a very malevolent way that again, because we only went to the doctor in the last two years, last week, we only saw it again for the first time, but we lost our doctor because we're not going back to a guy who does that.

01:10:43.402 --> 01:10:44.763
and asks those questions.

01:10:45.244 --> 01:11:00.697
Not just because he told my son he was only going to be 5'10 so give up on the MBA, but because he took him in a private room and said, you know, do you want to change your mind about vaccines because you're very behind and your parents don't seem to understand how important that is.

01:11:01.177 --> 01:11:03.559
Asked him whether he was sure he was a boy or a girl.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.664
Asked him whether this is not good, ladies and gentlemen, and part of it is this guy.

01:11:09.304 --> 01:11:11.006
Part of it is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.828
Part of it is the fake anti-vax movement.

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.089
Part of it is Paul Offit.

01:11:14.489 --> 01:11:25.921
Part of it is Steve Bannon and Aaron Seery and Goldman Sachs lawyers that like to make a lot of money off of movies or a lot of movie money off of vaccine injury.

01:11:36.465 --> 01:11:40.108
And so the premise is that America is run by a false two-party theater.

01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:50.858
And if you accept this premise, which I think a lot of people do in America right now, then you have to see that the only way that would work is if the national security state was actually running it.

01:11:51.926 --> 01:11:55.887
The only way it would work is that if anybody gets into office, they already passed the test.

01:11:56.267 --> 01:12:00.009
And that means election fraud is a lot of hamster wheeling.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:05.950
It gets people to waste a lot of time and energy when in reality, there's no election fraud.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.031
It's always fraud.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:13.933
It's a national security imperative that elections are never spontaneous and always controlled.

01:12:16.277 --> 01:12:19.779
If you can't accept that, then this message is not for you, and that's totally fine.

01:12:19.819 --> 01:12:26.243
This message isn't for everyone, but it is for anyone, because I believe that Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:26.283 --> 01:12:33.628
and anyone that rises into clear view on social media is put there on purpose, and they are need-to-know, basis-scripted actors.

01:12:33.668 --> 01:12:36.790
They accept that they don't know everything, and they don't care.

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:39.038
Cause that's what actors do.

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:47.741
If you take a job as a Klingon and they make you kill people in the next Star Trek movie, you're not going to say, well, I didn't sign up for that.

01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:58.884
And if you signed up for this to be in clear view and they tell you to talk about the aspects of the COVID shot that have venom, then you do it.

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:08.843
If you signed up to be one of these people in Clearview and you're a need-to-know scripted actor and they tell you to talk about gut bacteria, then you do it.

01:13:09.904 --> 01:13:20.489
If they tell you to tell you that the spike protein is amyloidogenic, you do it because you're a scripted actor who's agreed that if you do it right and your audition is successful, you will rise into Clearview.

01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:25.972
And you'll be part of this show that Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:26.012 --> 01:13:28.313
and all these lower-level players are a part of.

01:13:29.486 --> 01:13:33.289
governing America and the world by social media.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:42.336
And maybe American social media will dominate the world because America provides that, America has that, and that's our tech.

01:13:42.797 --> 01:13:45.779
I don't know how this is going to work, but I know for sure it was used on us.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.242
Robert Malone told us when he was on stage in Stockholm.

01:13:52.549 --> 01:14:00.253
Hi, I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., your HHS secretary, and I'm here with Dr. Susan Menares, who is our new CDC director.

01:14:00.273 --> 01:14:05.196
She's the first director in American history who has been confirmed by the Senate.

01:14:05.836 --> 01:14:09.498
Dr. Susan Menares, would you put your left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand.

01:14:10.689 --> 01:14:13.130
I'm very happy to have Dr. Minari as a board.

01:14:13.831 --> 01:14:15.512
She comes to us from ARPA-H.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:22.195
She's a tech genius, and she's going to drive AI and modernize CDC's data systems.

01:14:22.255 --> 01:14:27.398
And we're going to be able to provide first-class information, gold standard science to the American people.

01:14:27.998 --> 01:14:29.380
I take this obligation freely.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:41.773
Susan is a expert in public health and I'm confident that she will do everything that she can to restore the integrity of this agency.

01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:43.275
The duties of the office.

01:14:43.715 --> 01:14:44.435
Thank you, sir.

01:14:44.695 --> 01:14:46.656
I am truly honored and humbled.

01:14:46.976 --> 01:14:49.877
Thank you so much for your support over the past several months.

01:14:50.638 --> 01:14:54.019
I am so honored with the privilege of heading up CDC.

01:14:54.059 --> 01:14:57.881
It's such an important institution and I look forward to supporting you.

01:14:57.921 --> 01:15:04.583
I mean, just imagine if, you know, he was there shirtless because that's essentially the kind of comedy that we're dealing with right now.

01:15:04.623 --> 01:15:05.884
This is a well-chosen

01:15:07.084 --> 01:15:17.667
Insider here who's got all the inside knowledge to know what's real and what's not, and certainly knows more than he probably does at this point.

01:15:17.727 --> 01:15:27.190
It's not like when they hired him, they took him away to a quick, you know, three-week briefing where they read him all the classified stuff so that he could know everything that was going on from the pandemic.

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.911
This guy is a dude in a suit.

01:15:32.918 --> 01:15:36.962
His audition included swinging from chains at the beach.

01:15:38.763 --> 01:15:41.446
Like, I fell for it.

01:15:41.686 --> 01:15:47.031
I did, until a certain moment when I realized that nobody's listening to me, nobody's learning what I have to teach.

01:15:47.451 --> 01:15:55.859
And while I'm progressing to understand that, wow, they could say it better, these people are trying to build a big top tent for health freedom and sell books.

01:15:56.059 --> 01:15:57.200
What the hell's going on?

01:15:58.911 --> 01:16:01.074
And lots of people have fallen for this.

01:16:01.214 --> 01:16:07.721
Lots of people have fallen for it because there are all these little nuggets of truth in the, in the nutrition movement, in the new age movement.

01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:14.029
It's all sounds really good, but anybody that's really good, like Brandy Vaughn or Tony Bark gets killed.

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:18.975
At least they used to.

01:16:19.015 --> 01:16:20.436
I don't know if you can do wet work anymore.

01:16:20.737 --> 01:16:24.221
Over the next several years as we continue to make America healthier again.

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:25.602
So help me God.

01:16:25.622 --> 01:16:26.503
So help me God.

01:16:26.543 --> 01:16:28.665
Thank you very much and welcome aboard.

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:29.246
Thank you, sir.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.088
Produced by the U.S.

01:16:32.108 --> 01:16:33.949
Department of Health and Human Services.

01:16:34.029 --> 01:16:34.709
It's remarkable.

01:16:34.769 --> 01:16:35.570
I mean, it really is.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:36.711
It's quite remarkable.

01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:44.496
I want to go back in time before the pandemic, because I think there's a lot we need to revisit and relearn.

01:16:44.776 --> 01:16:49.379
And this is a lecture by Ralph Baric about coronaviruses.

01:16:49.419 --> 01:16:52.702
And I want to see if I can pull a little piece of

01:16:53.702 --> 01:17:12.071
of history out of this in the sense of kind of clue you in on how we're going to talk about virology going forward and what to listen for in any virology lecture that you would hear from an academic like this because the

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:32.531
The terminology that they use and the way that they say it doesn't explicitly say what they're doing, when in fact what they are doing is making large quantities of pure DNA using synthetic methodologies, and those pure quantities of DNA are applied to cell culture.

01:17:36.253 --> 01:17:48.286
It is remarkable how somebody can give a talk like this and walk around the idea that they are just finding genetic ghosts and then making pure quantities of them.

01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:51.550
It's like, you know, you draw a picture of a ghost on a

01:17:52.691 --> 01:17:55.232
on a piece of paper and you say, this is what I saw.

01:17:55.652 --> 01:17:59.793
And then somebody at a Hollywood set makes 400 of them and puts them in your backyard.

01:18:00.314 --> 01:18:02.094
It's like, well, yeah, okay.

01:18:02.134 --> 01:18:05.655
But the one I saw walked through a wall and then it was gone.

01:18:05.756 --> 01:18:06.596
Well, these are ghosts.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:23.882
You know, and it's a very similar thing to that if you say that, well, I can detect this genetic signal and some parts are missing, but I'll fill in the blanks and then I'll make a bunch of it and then use it and say that I'm recapitulating what I think that signal did in the wild.

01:18:23.962 --> 01:18:25.183
Very similar to the ghost.

01:18:26.264 --> 01:18:31.606
And when the ghost doesn't pass through walls, they have some reason why it doesn't.

01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:33.606
Maybe it's the limitations of the experiment.

01:18:33.646 --> 01:18:35.667
But in reality, that's what they're doing.

01:18:36.187 --> 01:18:47.691
And so this lecture, I think, is really nice because he says a couple of key aspects of it, which I think I have a bibliographic sort of

01:18:49.019 --> 01:18:59.004
reference list that if we go through it step by step you will see that actually what he reveals in this talk is that the transfection of cell culture to create

01:19:00.091 --> 01:19:11.562
virology requires a couple key steps, which is transfection of certain particular proteins, which I presume causes the formation of exosomes.

01:19:11.662 --> 01:19:15.706
And so if you just have these three proteins, you will get exosomes.

01:19:15.746 --> 01:19:23.954
And then if there's RNA in the cell, and N protein in the cell, then that might very well get packaged inside of the exosomes.

01:19:24.114 --> 01:19:24.174
And

01:19:24.995 --> 01:19:39.720
this might be nothing more than them trying to study the machinery of exosomes without actually explicitly saying that they're studying potentially zoonotic

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:42.758
exosome signaling.

01:19:43.159 --> 01:19:53.588
So it's not viruses that are all by themselves trying to take over the world, but it's signaling from the immune system, from the cells of animals that can occasionally interact with our own.

01:19:54.049 --> 01:20:01.996
It could be signaling from the microbiome of these animals that we are seeing interact with our own microbiome, but none of these possibilities are entertained.

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:05.739
And instead, what we're talking about is RNA signals

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.342
that are attacking us.

01:20:08.482 --> 01:20:11.864
And so there's no real complicated biology in there at all.

01:20:12.385 --> 01:20:27.077
Most importantly, because there's no microbiome, no phage communication, and no exosomal communication, which all comprise this irreducibly complex genetic background from which they purport to be pulling these particular signals.

01:20:27.978 --> 01:20:32.261
So I think it's a cool video because he's going to tell you how they make the donuts.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.724
And I think very few people have seen this video.

01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:40.412
Is it going to start?

01:20:41.212 --> 01:20:48.838
We're going to hear from Ralph Beck from the University of North Carolina, who's going to tell us about synthetic genomics of SARS.

01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:55.123
So I also would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to talk.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:21:02.108
It's been a wonderful venue and a real pleasure to be here and capture some new ideas that can be tried out on viruses.

01:21:03.049 --> 01:21:09.254
So the general themes that I'm going to talk about today are a basic short introduction into SARS biology.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:15.482
talk about the synthetic resurrection and reconstruction of a variety of zoonotic SARS viruses and their applications.

01:21:16.643 --> 01:21:18.844
So already it's kind of sketchy words, right?

01:21:18.944 --> 01:21:19.804
Resurrection?

01:21:20.705 --> 01:21:25.167
I don't know if I was a scientist, I would ever use the word resurrection.

01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:36.212
I also found it really weird that when you kill an animal after experiment, they call it a sacrifice, calling it sacrificing the animal.

01:21:37.566 --> 01:21:38.387
Is that what we're doing?

01:21:38.447 --> 01:21:39.928
I just say kill, put them down.

01:21:39.948 --> 01:21:40.489
I don't know.

01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:43.611
But that language of resurrect is really goofy to me.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:46.033
Therapeutics and vaccine design.

01:21:46.674 --> 01:21:55.602
I'll also touch on CODOM deoptimization as a way to attenuate SARS pathogenesis, but I certainly haven't gone to the depth of studies that Eckerd's group has done.

01:21:56.222 --> 01:22:04.069
And then I'll talk about rewiring SARS coronavirus transcription circuits as a way, universal strategy to attenuate viral pathogenesis.

01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:09.188
So this is a schematic diagram of the SARS coronavirus particle.

01:22:10.249 --> 01:22:12.350
It's about 100 nanometers in diameter.

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.592
It contains a helical nucleocapsid inside.

01:22:16.172 --> 01:22:18.913
It contains a single-stranded plus polarity RNA genome.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:23.236
This nucleocapsid structure is surrounded by a lipid bilayer.

01:22:24.016 --> 01:22:26.598
It contains several viral glycoprotein spikes.

01:22:26.658 --> 01:22:32.281
The important ones for today's talk include the M-glycoprotein and the E-protein, which are shown right here.

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:39.336
These proteins are absolutely essential for maturation and release and the production of virus particles.

01:22:39.356 --> 01:22:47.298
So the N-protein, the M-protein and the E-protein are absolutely essential for the formation of virus particles, the maturation of them.

01:22:48.138 --> 01:22:54.160
So from a biotechnology perspective, you can imagine actually that these proteins are the

01:22:55.180 --> 01:23:06.594
most important ones to understand and find in your signal because these are indicative of the surrounding spike protein and other things being part of it.

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:11.981
Think about the fact that he's saying you can get viral proteins with just these three

01:23:13.032 --> 01:23:14.733
proteins plus the RNA.

01:23:14.754 --> 01:23:22.841
So already, you can see the possibility that maybe we're talking about using those three proteins to package up any RNA that we make.

01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:29.747
Don't forget that we have fine tuned E. coli to do almost exactly what we want it to do.

01:23:29.867 --> 01:23:35.872
And so it would be pretty easy to make E. coli assemble these three proteins and start packaging stuff in it.

01:23:37.563 --> 01:23:51.722
And so if this is kind of a ubiquitous mechanism, if it's kind of a rather common mechanism among animals or among their microbiomes, among phage, bacteriophage communication for this kind of an assembly to occur,

01:23:53.114 --> 01:23:57.978
They're not making any attempt to differentiate from phages which share the same characteristics.

01:23:58.019 --> 01:24:02.603
They're not making any attempt to differentiate from them and where they might replicate.

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:13.152
Instead, they create cell culture models where these entities purport to replicate in cells of the mythological type.

01:24:13.232 --> 01:24:18.657
In other words, if you wanted to tell a story about bacteriophages replicating in our

01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:47.311
ovaries, then what you would need to do in the context of Ralph Baric and the NIH and DARPA or whatever is hire somebody to make a culture of ovarian cells and find an RNA transcript and a spike protein or whatever you assemble that would cause it to replicate in ovarian cells and then back claim that this is evidence that this virus replicates in the ovaries.

01:24:49.534 --> 01:24:57.380
That's exactly what's happening here and what happened with the original SARS and what's happening with the SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:11.350
People are telling us that they understand the natural biology of this RNA molecule by creating elaborate artificial conditions wherein that RNA molecule appears to replicate and package itself.

01:25:13.874 --> 01:25:20.598
And Ralph Baric holds a monopoly on that intellectual property with regard to coronaviruses by design.

01:25:21.819 --> 01:25:40.150
It's not to say that the molecular biology isn't real, but it's being misrepresented as molecular biology that isn't synthetic, that isn't trying to mimic some endogenous mechanism, but is instead purported to be our best effort of recapitulating what is a dangerous viral pathogen.

01:25:42.119 --> 01:25:55.102
instead of, again, this irreducibly complex background and an irreducibly complex signaling background about which we're trying to learn something and maybe even learn to use.

01:26:00.203 --> 01:26:01.103
So keep that in mind.

01:26:02.183 --> 01:26:10.165
The second viral protein of interest for today's talk is the S-glycoprotein gene, as shown right here, which gives the virus its unique appearance in the electron microscope.

01:26:11.681 --> 01:26:17.065
It's the viral attachment protein that binds to the receptor to mediate docking and entry into the cells.

01:26:18.226 --> 01:26:21.869
It regulates tissue tropism, species specificity.

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:27.574
It contains a large number of important neutralizing epitopes, and it's the principal component of protective immunity.

01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:39.393
Now, if you tear this virus particle apart and look at... And of course, that's an incredibly wonderful story that the spike protein is the primary focus of immunity.

01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:43.635
And to tell that story all the way back then is, of course, ridiculous.

01:26:43.695 --> 01:26:54.519
This guy just got through telling you that the N-protein, the M-protein, and the E-protein are absolutely essential for the maturation and formation of viral particles.

01:26:54.579 --> 01:26:56.080
But they are virtually

01:26:57.210 --> 01:27:05.453
they're virtually non-existent with regard to the immune response to this process, which is remarkable.

01:27:05.493 --> 01:27:08.174
It's not an immune response to viruses.

01:27:08.254 --> 01:27:14.237
It should be thought of as an immune response to this aberrant process, which is transfection.

01:27:15.552 --> 01:27:33.483
If a foreign RNA from a rat or a bat could get inside of your body and start using your cellular machinery to replicate itself, then the immune response would be to that process, not to that clump of shit.

01:27:34.989 --> 01:27:40.812
not to that lipid nanoparticle, not to that whatever you call it, virus, exosome.

01:27:41.232 --> 01:27:47.896
No, it is biologically, by definition, it's not gonna be a response to that little clump of crap.

01:27:47.956 --> 01:28:01.103
It's gonna be a response to the process that gets initiated and all of the aberrant signaling that would occur if an RNA were doing something that wasn't supposed to be happening in that cell.

01:28:02.785 --> 01:28:06.867
And yet here is Ralph Baric telling you that coronaviruses work very simply.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:12.771
They have three proteins for assembly and one of the proteins on the outside is the focus of immunity.

01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:14.472
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

01:28:14.952 --> 01:28:16.233
You understand everything.

01:28:16.353 --> 01:28:17.293
I can get on with it.

01:28:19.654 --> 01:28:23.797
The viral genomic positive stranded RNA is about 30,000 base pairs in length.

01:28:23.837 --> 01:28:27.619
They're the largest plus polarity RNA genomes in nature.

01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:31.461
The first 20,000 base pairs are so encode the replicase proteins.

01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:40.653
whose job it is to replicate the genome and express subgenomic messenger RNA that encode these downstream open reading frames.

01:28:41.513 --> 01:28:46.214
So the genome organization of coronas are quite different than polioviruses, which you've just heard about.

01:28:47.715 --> 01:28:56.717
Now, these downstream ORFs encode the structural genes like the S, E, M, and nucleocapsid protein that I just mentioned that were present in the virion, and a variety of accessory ORFs,

01:28:57.247 --> 01:29:01.949
To get these expressed in cells, you find a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNA.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:09.693
They're arranged from the three prime end of the genome so that all the sequences in the smallest message are in the next largest message and so on and so forth.

01:29:10.254 --> 01:29:16.797
This organization allows different open reading frames to be placed at the five prime ends of different messenger RNAs.

01:29:17.363 --> 01:29:20.085
so they can be efficiently translated and expressed in cells.

01:29:20.245 --> 01:29:28.131
Now, this could easily be a complicated molecular signaling mechanism that's present in a wide variety of mammals.

01:29:28.211 --> 01:29:36.837
It could be a signaling mechanism that is present in a wide variety of bacteria, especially in the microflora of our guts or in our lungs.

01:29:36.917 --> 01:29:42.181
It's possible any number of those things could be true, and they are portraying them as

01:29:42.842 --> 01:29:47.928
independent biological entities so that they can be studied in a very different way.

01:29:51.873 --> 01:29:56.699
And where any potential use or application or deployment

01:29:58.371 --> 01:30:12.140
of these synthetic technologies could again be misconstrued as a natural phenomenon, which does not exist as this guy is explaining it, where your immune system makes a response to the S protein.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:13.962
There are 31 other proteins.

01:30:14.362 --> 01:30:18.124
A lot of them are very complicated enzymes that copy RNA.

01:30:19.786 --> 01:30:28.609
and RNAs that we don't even have naturally in our cells, but our immune system ignores all those things and focuses on this spike protein.

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:33.971
That's how malevolent this is.

01:30:34.091 --> 01:30:35.591
That's how nasty this is.

01:30:35.651 --> 01:30:41.213
That's how long the con was because this guy's job was to con academia.

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:57.877
to make sure that any academics, including people like myself, if we went looking, we would find exactly the guy that could explain it just with the right cartoons and just with the right amount of jargon to make us feel like we just learned a lot from that hour.

01:30:57.917 --> 01:31:01.180
And it was just hard enough to pay attention to feel like we earned it.

01:31:03.445 --> 01:31:14.253
Not that dissimilar to James Giordano, although this guy's a little level or two lower because his audience isn't like sharp West Point graduates or a whole set of law students.

01:31:14.694 --> 01:31:22.159
His audience is a very diverse, very highly specialized and humbled, you know, academia.

01:31:24.461 --> 01:31:27.303
Now, the transcription strategy of these viruses are unique.

01:31:28.308 --> 01:31:38.637
And in fact, each messenger RNA contains a leader sequence of about 70 nucleotides shown here, these little blue boxes, that is derived from the five prime end of the genome.

01:31:39.097 --> 01:31:42.760
So these are discontinuous stretches of RNA that are joined during transcription.

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:49.906
And these little red box elements right here are absolutely essential for mediating the joining of these two sequences.

01:31:50.987 --> 01:31:53.569
This will become very important later on in the talk.

01:31:53.609 --> 01:31:57.432
So keep the concept of TRS elements, the little red box elements,

01:31:57.987 --> 01:32:01.088
as being essential for regulation of messenger RNA synthesis.

01:32:02.508 --> 01:32:10.991
Now, I'm going to talk about synthetic genomics in the context of a platform to control emerging infectious diseases.

01:32:11.571 --> 01:32:17.813
If you think about emerging viruses, they have tremendous potential to cause high morbidity and mortality and severe economic hardship.

01:32:17.913 --> 01:32:22.095
Good examples are HIV, the 1918 flu, SARS coronavirus, H5N1,

01:32:23.348 --> 01:32:25.549
Chikungunya virus probably most recently.

01:32:26.069 --> 01:32:29.990
We shouldn't forget the lab leak of polio virus in New York City in the early 1900s.

01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:38.193
Sorry about that volume.

01:32:39.133 --> 01:32:48.976
Now clearly genetic introductions are increasing and a large number of these viruses have large reservoir pools of animal strains like SARS and H5.

01:32:50.029 --> 01:32:53.987
that are maintained as sort of heterogeneous swarms of pools of viruses.

01:32:54.423 --> 01:32:56.705
of which someone may actually emerge.

01:32:56.785 --> 01:33:03.130
See, so he's kind of admitting it's a maintained swarm of heterogeneous viruses in the background.

01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:13.678
So we're not talking about a wiped clean chalkboard on which a relatively rudimentary PCR test is still pretty much the gold standard diagnostic.

01:33:13.778 --> 01:33:22.064
No, we're talking about an irreducibly complex background that somebody like Nathan Wolf was making a living grifting about for years before the pandemic.

01:33:23.123 --> 01:33:29.247
And again, metagenomic sequencing is the way that one can grift on that irreducibly complex background.

01:33:29.808 --> 01:33:40.195
And metagenomic sequencing was actually invented by someone who was trying to understand bacteriophages, because they are 70% of all the genetic signals in the background anyway.

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.458
The future to cause epidemic disease in humans.

01:33:45.139 --> 01:33:52.684
This raises a conundrum in terms of how do you protect the public health against a future occurrence that is hard to predict,

01:33:53.459 --> 01:34:02.384
How do you develop drugs and therapeutics against an unknown from this heterogeneous swarm of variant strains that will actually work against the unknown that will emerge in the future?

01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:04.626
And how do you target your scarce resources?

01:34:04.686 --> 01:34:12.871
And so we think platform technologies like synthetic biology, phylogenomics, structural modeling, high-throughput sequencing really will provide a platform

01:34:13.706 --> 01:34:18.770
So phylogenomics is just like, okay, we're going to, you know, see what we find when we go fishing.

01:34:19.371 --> 01:34:23.194
Structural modeling is what Robert Malone did at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:34:23.234 --> 01:34:35.185
He did like all kinds of computer modeled x-ray crystallography of all the known pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog to find ivermectin and famotidine and remdesivir and silicoxib.

01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:43.666
High throughput sequencing, you know, that's the stuff that the Human Genome Project, the only thing that the Human Genome Project has provided.

01:34:43.706 --> 01:34:47.929
The only technology that has improved as a result of the Human Genome Project.

01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:53.192
But our ability to copy Chinese books hasn't made it any easier for us to read Chinese literature.

01:34:56.655 --> 01:35:00.838
And we still can't proofread what we copy very well because we don't read Chinese.

01:35:00.878 --> 01:35:04.040
You see, that's the problem with this synthetic biology bullshit.

01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:08.642
We can make a lot of DNA and put it places, but that doesn't mean we're learning much.

01:35:12.524 --> 01:35:23.008
And our goal is to use SARS coronavirus and its large pool of zoonotic viruses as a model to develop rapid response platforms to protect against this broader heterogeneous pool of variants.

01:35:24.428 --> 01:35:32.831
Uh, we also would like to develop strategies that would attenuate all family members so that you could rapidly develop vaccines for the public, overall public health.

01:35:33.632 --> 01:35:34.172
Now, uh,

01:35:35.027 --> 01:35:38.328
A lot of beautiful work in Malik's lab, as well as other labs here in China.

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:42.129
Worked out the basic molecular epidemiology.

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.410
He just mentioned Malik.

01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:49.272
I should mention that the speaker that comes after this guy is Malik Pereira, or whatever his name is.

01:35:49.332 --> 01:35:53.573
He's like the mother, the father-in-law of Li Min Yan.

01:35:53.613 --> 01:35:55.194
He speaks right after this guy.

01:35:55.234 --> 01:35:57.975
The guy that isolated SARS, I think that's his name.

01:35:58.715 --> 01:36:00.195
Biology of the SARS coronavirus.

01:36:00.295 --> 01:36:02.056
The virus originated most likely in bats.

01:36:02.768 --> 01:36:04.708
It probably jumped into civets or humans.

01:36:05.529 --> 01:36:14.291
And in that context, set up a transmission cycle between civets and raccoon dogs in marketplaces and humans who frequented those marketplaces.

01:36:14.831 --> 01:36:24.273
Over time, it selected for strains that were more efficient at infecting human cells and recognizing the human ACE2 receptor for docking and entry, leading to the 2002-2003 epidemic, which caused about 8,000 cases and 800 deaths.

01:36:30.205 --> 01:36:40.451
Now, if you do phylogenetic analysis of the isolates that were sequenced, you find they fall into two broad categories.

01:36:40.691 --> 01:36:52.839
This line indicates the strains underneath that line were identified during the epidemic, and you have early-phase isolates, primarily of January 2003, after a variety of super-spreading events.

01:36:53.439 --> 01:36:56.441
You had middle-phase isolates, shown here by this group of isolates.

01:36:57.081 --> 01:36:59.903
And then, following infected physician

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:07.168
who came to Hong Kong and resulted in a super-spreading event that transmitted the virus to the rest of the world.

01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:08.870
These were considered late-phase isolates.

01:37:09.772 --> 01:37:13.657
A vast pool of heterogeneous zoonotic strains, however, reside up here.

01:37:14.403 --> 01:37:17.585
Most of these were, in fact, none of these were ever actually successfully cultured.

01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:21.008
They actually exist as sequence signatures in silico.

01:37:21.608 --> 01:37:23.750
Sequence signatures in silico.

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:30.074
So whole fields, whole phylogenetic trees have been created from metagenomic sequencing alone.

01:37:30.114 --> 01:37:36.899
And again, this is one of those facts that was very conveniently delegated on the script of the no-virus people.

01:37:37.299 --> 01:37:39.401
The no-virus people are very good at pointing this out.

01:37:40.356 --> 01:37:47.439
But they can't take it to the logical conclusion that virology is possible if you take those same sequences and just transfect things with them.

01:37:47.939 --> 01:37:53.901
And if you transfect things with them, with the M and the E protein, you're going to get little exosomes.

01:37:54.162 --> 01:37:55.862
That's what happens.

01:37:55.902 --> 01:37:58.943
That's what Ralph Baric just told you.

01:37:58.983 --> 01:38:04.906
The N protein, the M protein, and the E protein are absolutely essential for the maturation and formation of virions.

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:13.272
So in other words, if you want to get those, you want to get those, you just have to transfect those proteins into your cell culture.

01:38:14.753 --> 01:38:24.820
Now, if you can set that up with a receptor binding pair of some kind, then that makes a really nice little, very highly specific tissue exosomy thing.

01:38:26.471 --> 01:38:47.778
And it makes a very nice story to study this stuff with not ever actually telling anybody what you're studying and never revealing that if we want to, we could make a crap ton of this because we can make pure DNA for the E protein, the M protein and the N protein and transfect cell cultures with it and then probably put a bunch of RNA in with it and they'll package it.

01:38:50.379 --> 01:38:52.300
He's all but telling you that.

01:38:53.519 --> 01:39:12.112
And under the guise of virology and trying to resurrect these trapped in silico variants, he's just using synthetic biology to explore how exosome signaling works and whether they can use it as a tool.

01:39:13.212 --> 01:39:21.458
So one of the immediate goals that we became interested in during the outbreak was to develop a platform of viruses

01:39:22.076 --> 01:39:25.998
that captured the heterogeneity that exists within the family of viruses.

01:39:26.859 --> 01:39:30.141
And to do that, we identified sort of representative strains.

01:39:30.181 --> 01:39:33.523
For example, middle phase, early phase isolate Irvani we had in the lab.

01:39:34.043 --> 01:39:37.606
Middle phase isolates were CHKW1, GZO2.

01:39:37.626 --> 01:39:43.569
It was an early phase isolate, animal isolates, like from civets, SC16 and HCSC6103.

01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:46.131
A raccoon dog isolate, which is shown down here.

01:39:46.772 --> 01:39:58.199
The spradic 2004 human case, GD03, and a couple of other viruses, sequences were identified as good candidates that would capture all the diversity that had been identified.

01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:06.145
The most important thing to try and get into your head, and I really want to, I'm going to read a little bit out of this book because I think it's so cool.

01:40:06.505 --> 01:40:07.786
Because he says it right.

01:40:09.607 --> 01:40:10.528
And I think it's right.

01:40:12.309 --> 01:40:15.071
I wonder if I have to read the whole introduction.

01:40:15.111 --> 01:40:15.651
Maybe I don't.

01:40:16.687 --> 01:40:20.288
I'm going to read the last paragraph of this introduction because I think it's really cool.

01:40:20.308 --> 01:40:25.791
The book is Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge and it's by Niels Bohr.

01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:31.953
And the part that I want to show is this last bit down here at the bottom.

01:40:33.112 --> 01:40:37.575
He's talking about the contents of the book, so he's told you what the whole book is going to be about here.

01:40:37.595 --> 01:40:49.302
And then the last group of articles is closely related to the first, but it is hoped that the improved terminology used to present the situation in quantum physics has made the general argument more easily accessible.

01:40:50.083 --> 01:41:01.290
In its application to the problems of broader scope, emphasis is laid especially on the presuppositions for unambiguous use of the concepts employed in the account of the experience.

01:41:02.563 --> 01:41:03.984
Sounds really complicated, right?

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:08.046
It's almost like you didn't understand what he said, but this last sentence is bombastic.

01:41:08.546 --> 01:41:25.056
The gist of the argument is that for objective description and harmonious comprehension, it is necessary in almost every field of knowledge to pay attention to the circumstances under which the evidence is obtained.

01:41:29.164 --> 01:41:39.413
The gist of the argument is that for the objective description and harmonious comprehension of nature, of our biology,

01:41:41.044 --> 01:41:50.894
of who we are as a species, it is necessary in almost every field of knowledge relative to this to pay attention to the circumstances under which the evidence is obtained.

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:59.282
If the evidence that we have obtained about biology is obtained under circumstances and presuppositions,

01:42:00.168 --> 01:42:05.852
that are false, then how we see that knowledge will necessarily be false.

01:42:06.612 --> 01:42:10.575
And I think that's what's so cool about this.

01:42:12.782 --> 01:42:40.921
this concept of virology and how all of us in academia, because we were taught a certain set of presumptions, and we collected a little bit of data under those presumptions and performed some, you know, experiments under those presumptions and assumed that because our experiments worked, they confirmed those presumptions, that we were put under a spell that has lasted a very long time, that intramuscular injection isn't that dangerous.

01:42:43.783 --> 01:42:49.705
that it can be used as medicine, that a combination of substances can be injected intramuscularly without any real worry.

01:42:52.205 --> 01:42:57.367
You can use heavy metals to attract the attention of the immune system in that context and all these other things.

01:42:58.387 --> 01:43:05.349
And yet we have a specialist here who's telling us about signals that he purports to find in nature, but only stores them in silico.

01:43:05.729 --> 01:43:09.590
And now he's using synthetic means to resurrect them and study their biology.

01:43:10.748 --> 01:43:19.551
And he purports to be unaware that this is just transfection of cell cultures with, you know, tweaking and trying to understand the machinery behind it.

01:43:22.312 --> 01:43:26.514
Or pretending not to.

01:43:26.554 --> 01:43:30.435
This shows the sequence variation within the spike glycoprotein.

01:43:30.475 --> 01:43:35.197
If it's a blue box amino acid, that's an animal associated residue.

01:43:35.737 --> 01:43:37.838
Early phase changes are shown here in yellow.

01:43:38.396 --> 01:43:42.038
Middle phase changes shown in orange and late phase changes shown in red.

01:43:42.878 --> 01:43:49.882
In addition, in 2004, there were a variety of other animal strains, as sporadic human cases were identified, that had additional variations.

01:43:49.902 --> 01:43:54.824
I mean, this is, again, all PCR, all metagenomic sequencing, and then targeting.

01:43:54.844 --> 01:43:57.185
Look at this tiny little sequence in 30,000 bases.

01:43:59.574 --> 01:44:05.118
and trying to show you that this is some kind of evidence of diversity.

01:44:05.158 --> 01:44:22.070
But what he's not telling you is that means that all of these viruses have conserved the E protein and the M protein and the N protein because they're functionally very important to the maturation and formation of pure virions or real virions, active ones, I don't know, real ones, good ones, whatever.

01:44:23.211 --> 01:44:28.733
And so the narrative is being laid down years before that the spike protein is relevant.

01:44:28.753 --> 01:44:34.376
Those other proteins don't do anything except for extremely important things like form the fricking particles.

01:44:38.183 --> 01:45:01.050
And if you can see it now in the context of the pandemic and how absurd it is to talk just about the furin cleavage site or the HIV insert or whatever else that it is without the other 31 proteins mattering at all, especially when some of those 31 proteins are functional enzymes that are highly conserved, that are structural proteins that are highly conserved.

01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:07.772
But somehow or another, we've been convinced by all sides of the narrative that antibodies to the spike protein is important.

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:12.076
And that they can avoid those antibodies by just changing a few of these bases.

01:45:13.837 --> 01:45:18.558
And Tony Fauci and Francis Collins and Robert Malone and Tucker Carlson all agree.

01:45:20.619 --> 01:45:24.260
That Brett Weinstein is the evolutionary biology master of this stuff.

01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:28.122
And that if you need the molecular biology, you should go to Kevin McKernan.

01:45:30.543 --> 01:45:34.124
That's the trap that the conservative right in America has fallen into.

01:45:35.382 --> 01:45:41.007
And you can pretend that you don't follow Alex Jones or you don't follow Laura Loomer because you always saw through her.

01:45:41.307 --> 01:45:48.253
But the bottom line is, is that if you're on that side of the equation, that's who represents you on social media.

01:45:48.293 --> 01:45:49.754
That's the team you're cheering for.

01:45:50.174 --> 01:45:57.320
So when that team goes and gets burnt and gets discredited, you will go down with them.

01:45:57.421 --> 01:46:00.843
Just like if you are on the wrong side of, or maybe,

01:46:01.684 --> 01:46:08.671
Donald Trump and everybody on the visible right in America is on the wrong side of the Israel thing.

01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:11.353
Those people will be permanently discredited.

01:46:11.413 --> 01:46:13.655
Maybe they will even be accused of war crimes.

01:46:14.136 --> 01:46:14.756
And then what?

01:46:16.118 --> 01:46:19.060
Oh, well, I didn't follow Laura Loomer from the very beginning.

01:46:20.282 --> 01:46:21.843
I knew Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:21.883 --> 01:46:22.584
was a fraud.

01:46:24.966 --> 01:46:26.007
Creation shown here in white.

01:46:27.259 --> 01:46:34.927
And it's interesting, as much of the variation actually falls within residues or regions that neutralizing epitopes were – had been identified.

01:46:35.528 --> 01:46:44.918
And, in fact, although the number of residues that are changed aren't that great, you can actually reduce neutralization titers by about 20-fold with some of these variants.

01:46:45.839 --> 01:46:46.620
Now, importantly,

01:46:48.291 --> 01:46:49.994
Farzan's group shows.

01:46:50.054 --> 01:46:57.384
I mean, this is the opposite of George James Giordano, but it's it's still it's still warfare.

01:46:57.445 --> 01:46:58.987
This is definitely an actor.

01:47:00.259 --> 01:47:04.980
that the two key changes during the epidemic were this lysine to asparagine change at 47.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:14.903
But it's got to be an actor that's doing real molecular biology and that's one of the reasons why I'm showing you this because I want you to understand that it can't be as simple as there's no viruses.

01:47:14.963 --> 01:47:17.064
It can't be as simple as they don't do anything.

01:47:17.524 --> 01:47:27.267
It has to be, to a certain extent, a very high fidelity signal that they can both lie about on the right, bullshit about on the right, and

01:47:28.343 --> 01:47:48.911
lie about on the left and it's got to be the gears have to mesh well enough so that they are sure they're right and we were sure we were right and this is how they did it 79 and a serine threonine change at 487 that drove animal adaptation to human strength

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:50.561
And so keep that in mind.

01:47:50.961 --> 01:48:16.760
So without access to this pool of strains, we decided to synthesize, basically, a portfolio of spiked glycoprotein genes of about 4kB each, and then use a molecular clone for the Urbani epidemic strain that we had built in the lab, basically replacing the Urbani spike one at a time with these various spiked glycoproteins from different phases of the epidemic.

01:48:17.677 --> 01:48:21.158
Now, all of these viruses were viable except for the SC16 variant.

01:48:21.938 --> 01:48:30.139
This actually can't recognize the human ACE receptor, so it didn't grow until we made mouse cells that constitutively expressed the civet ACE2 receptor.

01:48:30.179 --> 01:48:32.100
And once we did that, this virus could grow well.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:43.662
Before we had those cells, since Farzan had identified this 479 change as the key residue change, we actually built a recombinant virus with that change, and that virus could be cultured.

01:48:44.249 --> 01:49:01.816
Now, the trick to remember here is that when they produce virions, they have to start with that clone up there and one of these inserts, and then they make lots of that DNA and they throw it on a cell culture, and then that cell culture does the packaging, and then they take the supernatant off that culture, and that's the viruses.

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:15.172
But that's already transfecting a cell culture with a very pure DNA, which will express the M protein, the E protein, and the N protein, so cause the formation of exosomes.

01:49:15.973 --> 01:49:23.358
And then they swap out the spike protein to see if they can change the cellular specificity or the receptor specificity.

01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:42.770
And so, yeah, they could be playing with viruses that they could barely find in a bat, or they could be playing with general cellular signaling mechanisms, general cellular genetic signaling mechanisms that are ubiquitous across nature and across microbiomes and trying to find common themes in them.

01:49:44.565 --> 01:49:49.808
which probably makes a little bit more sense than gain-of-function viruses and stuff like that.

01:49:54.211 --> 01:50:01.736
Interestingly enough, two of these, the GZO2 and the HCSC6103 viruses, actually caused lethal infection in aged animals.

01:50:01.776 --> 01:50:03.357
They produced an ARDS-like disease.

01:50:03.818 --> 01:50:08.080
SARS caused ARDS in humans, predominantly in aged populations.

01:50:08.701 --> 01:50:10.782
That's acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:50:10.802 --> 01:50:13.324
It's a clinically devastating end-stage lung disease

01:50:13.766 --> 01:50:15.487
with about a 50% mortality rate.

01:50:15.947 --> 01:50:20.109
So these are actually some of the first real good animal models for SARS infection.

01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:29.633
Now, these viruses replicate, the human epidemic strains replicate efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures.

01:50:30.133 --> 01:50:33.975
These are cultures that are derived from cells lining the trachea of transplant patients.

01:50:34.515 --> 01:50:39.498
You can actually culture them on liquid air interfaces and they take on the architecture of the human airway.

01:50:41.622 --> 01:51:03.947
The architecture would be the mucosal membrane where again it is well known that phages are able to pass very freely while bacteria get trapped in mucuses and that actually was discovered on coral reefs but actually the mucus on coral reefs serves a very simple similar purpose as the mucus inside of your GI tract and lungs.

01:51:05.007 --> 01:51:08.168
All the epidemic strains actually like to infect ciliated cells

01:51:08.663 --> 01:51:11.084
And these epidemic strains replicate very efficiently.

01:51:11.544 --> 01:51:13.165
The animal strains, however, do not.

01:51:15.166 --> 01:51:26.711
And this is just some fluorescent microscope images showing the cilia of the ciliated cells with an expression of the SARS nucleocapsid protein from an epidemic strain on the ciliated cells.

01:51:27.211 --> 01:51:32.853
And the zoonotic strains, SC16 and the HCSC6103, can't replicate.

01:51:33.113 --> 01:51:37.295
However, if you passage these viruses on human airway cells and culture,

01:51:38.015 --> 01:51:42.619
you can actually rapidly select out variants that can replicate efficiently in human airways.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:52:03.235
Those viruses actually do not contain the mutations that- Again, see, he's showing you that when they transfect cells, the transcript that they can detect changes, but then they focus on such a narrow portion of the 30,000 bases that could have changed and focus only on what, 12?

01:52:04.875 --> 01:52:06.196
That seems crazy, right?

01:52:06.216 --> 01:52:13.381
It would be like focusing on the fourth word in the fourth chapter of a book as the only relevant word of changing anything.

01:52:15.322 --> 01:52:24.128
And yet this is how this kind of biology was presented all the way back then, because this is already a scripted fraud.

01:52:25.269 --> 01:52:29.532
And there's nobody in the room that's prepared to challenge him because none of them work on this.

01:52:32.571 --> 01:52:37.997
that had been predicted by Mike Farzan, which were clearly responsible for the 2002-2003 epidemic.

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:43.323
Rather, we saw changes at positions 442 and 472 and 479 that mediated the cross-species transmission event.

01:52:49.807 --> 01:52:52.230
So in reality, we've done this a couple of times.

01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:56.536
I mean, this is around the same time that the Human Genome Project is declaring its victory.

01:52:56.596 --> 01:53:06.409
And so he is essentially portraying a high fidelity ability to monitor a DNA or RNA molecule in culture.

01:53:07.330 --> 01:53:10.272
and read specific bases and watch them change.

01:53:10.753 --> 01:53:28.166
And that is exactly the same enchantment that the Human Genome Project at the same time is engaged in on the front cover of Time and in front of big press conferences with Francis Collins and Mark Lander, saying that they've sequenced another human and another human.

01:53:28.186 --> 01:53:35.172
And yet this month, this year, a paper came out saying that a deeper human sequence than ever has been done.

01:53:35.752 --> 01:53:36.973
Now we really did it.

01:53:41.192 --> 01:53:42.874
That's the admission you need to see.

01:53:43.074 --> 01:53:54.508
That's the admission that there's no more useful cutting-edge science to be done in animals if we want that cutting-edge science to work in humans and be applicable to humans.

01:53:54.969 --> 01:53:56.791
Humans must be the

01:53:57.819 --> 01:53:59.360
the experimental animal.

01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:12.271
And one of the ways to experiment with human exosomal signaling would be to tell elaborate stories about viruses that circulate the globe and 1.7 million viruses that are waiting to jump into us.

01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:21.199
There's actually several pathways by which the zoonotic SARS could actually adapt and recognize the human ACE receptor.

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:36.126
What's interesting is that the epidemic strains actually efficiently use... So Janet Reno says that if I don't tell him to fuck off because he's a fuckwit, then I'm admitting that he's not a bad guy?

01:54:36.247 --> 01:54:39.168
Janet Reno, you are a fuckwit, and all of the...

01:54:39.768 --> 01:54:43.950
The chat that you've done over the last hour shows how much of a fuckwit you are.

01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:46.872
If you were my friend, you would have encouraged me.

01:54:46.912 --> 01:54:51.074
If you were my friend, you would have said, why don't you take off a month and start your non-profit?

01:54:51.094 --> 01:54:53.395
Why don't you take off a month and try to work on your book?

01:54:53.415 --> 01:54:56.036
Why don't you take off a month and spend some time with your family?

01:54:56.457 --> 01:55:02.440
Instead, you told me to take off a month and try to sue a lawyer who's trying to help a cop in California.

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.321
Janet Reno, adios amigo.

01:55:06.402 --> 01:55:09.203
Both the human ACE receptor and the civet ACE receptor.

01:55:19.266 --> 01:55:29.769
When we in vitro select for human adapted strains on human airway cultures, they actually lose the ability to recognize the civet receptor.

01:55:30.949 --> 01:55:46.594
What this data suggests to us actually is that SARS had existed in a transmission cycle between humans and civets actually probably for several years prior to the 2002-2003 epidemic, allowing the virus to gain the capacity to recognize both receptors.

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.440
Okay, so those are the easy ones to do.

01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:52.381
Oh, an application.

01:55:52.541 --> 01:56:09.724
As most of my regular viewers are aware, I have been trying to greatly reduce my swearing and certainly greatly increase the amount of control I have during a live stream when being provoked by people in the chat or being provoked by a video that I didn't screen before I watched.

01:56:10.204 --> 01:56:18.066
And for this last outbreak, again, I will apologize, but Janet Reno is somebody that I've known for a long time, and I believe

01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:47.217
for a long time had my good intentions in mind but the recent developments have come to play where obviously his performance in the chat is just a giant admission that he's a clown because if he was really my friend and he really thinks something bad was happening while we were texting there were lots of other ways to solve that problem besides texting fuck you or texting me that he can't watch my stream anymore because I swear and he

01:56:47.977 --> 01:56:58.230
Works in the government where nobody swears and I just don't understand what's going on I don't understand who Janet Reno is if Janet Reno really wanted to be my friend

01:56:58.737 --> 01:57:17.933
then in the end he would realize that the biology I'm trying to teach and these little phrases, you know, are really easy for him to share with anybody he wants to, like intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the 1800s, or just that RNA can't pandemic, or autism spectrum disorder is an elaborate mythology that allows both sides to be fooled.

01:57:18.453 --> 01:57:23.196
Instead, he says that I can't share any of your streams with anybody because you swear too much.

01:57:23.576 --> 01:57:29.039
And now he's tried to disrupt my stream for about an hour and a half as a reaction to that.

01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:32.561
And all I did was tell him, please stop contacting me.

01:57:33.022 --> 01:57:35.283
I think we would better be a better off.

01:57:35.323 --> 01:57:36.624
You know, I have my life to live.

01:57:36.644 --> 01:57:37.724
You have your life to live.

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:38.465
Hopefully we'll

01:57:38.945 --> 01:57:40.166
will score the touchdowns.

01:57:40.246 --> 01:57:43.387
But now suddenly it's a friend who's hurt.

01:57:43.848 --> 01:57:50.371
It feels a lot like what Piper Stover did to me when I told Piper Stover to stop contacting me.

01:57:50.431 --> 01:57:54.873
She started crying on the phone telling me that I can't believe you don't believe me anymore.

01:57:55.273 --> 01:58:08.400
Instead of thinking about other ways that you could fight for your kids and use the stuff that I figured out and go build something on your own, you wasted an hour in the chat trying to discredit me to my followers that you seem to,

01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:11.742
love to ridicule as being hardly any.

01:58:13.263 --> 01:58:31.155
Janet Reno unfortunately ladies and gentlemen was probably just somebody who was put in place a long time ago to try and monitor me or influence me and the last few things that he tweeted me over the last message me over the last couple days have resulted in this disruption right here.

01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.220
And I don't know what to tell you.

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:43.544
He tried to interrupt the life of Mark Kulak, and he also tried to interrupt the life of some other followers that he met when he came to my house for the third or fourth time.

01:58:43.884 --> 01:58:46.585
The first time he came to my house was with Piper Stover.

01:58:49.365 --> 01:58:55.207
So now that we had a large panel of variant viruses, we could use those for therapeutic testing or for vaccines.

01:58:55.968 --> 01:59:00.429
In this case, I'm going to show you an example of about 30 human monoclonal antibodies that were derived by

01:59:01.098 --> 01:59:02.179
Antonio Lansovecchia.

01:59:02.819 --> 01:59:09.323
If you take those 30 monoclonals and test their ability to neutralize all the strains that we've made in the laboratory, you find some that only neutralize.

01:59:09.363 --> 01:59:16.007
So you're going to hear a lot of stuff in the next few weeks about monoclonals and whether antibodies are just bullshit or not.

01:59:16.047 --> 01:59:25.212
I've seen some of these fakes on the right now starting to talk about how maybe antibodies are just something that doesn't really work the way they say it works.

01:59:25.372 --> 01:59:26.073
And that would be

01:59:26.713 --> 01:59:36.139
pretty absurd because antibodies have been used for a wide variety of very nicely done applications in manufacturing and protein biologics.

01:59:36.219 --> 01:59:39.721
It's just that there's a lot of flaws and that they're not foolproof.

01:59:40.201 --> 01:59:44.544
And they are not uniform unless synthetically made that way.

01:59:44.584 --> 01:59:51.969
And so there's a lot about polyclonal antibodies and a lot about the production of polyclonal antibodies that has been exaggerated for years.

01:59:52.449 --> 02:00:04.563
And in fact, that intellectual property collapsing during the pandemic is one of the things that was brought to our attention or clarified, or we got a lot of help with from this person in the chat, Janet Reno.

02:00:04.603 --> 02:00:06.906
And thanks to Janet Reno for helping us with that.

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:32.712
that the antibody patent paradox that was published in the Yale Law School Review ends up to be a very big clue about some of the underlying motivations behind the theater of the pandemic and why they had to work the way they did to kind of have these stumbling points like monoclonal antibodies and adenovirus transfections that they ended up pulling off the market for cardiac effects and clotting and then now they're

02:00:33.212 --> 02:00:40.621
Six years later, the dissident movement is saying that they always knew that the mRNA was going to cause clotting because the spike protein is nasty.

02:00:41.002 --> 02:00:47.109
And so this is a national security narrative that is absolutely continuous.

02:00:47.987 --> 02:00:52.289
with the stuff that they were doing with SARS and MERS in the early 2000s.

02:00:52.690 --> 02:01:05.917
And if you can see it that way, then the whole thing isn't very surprising because in order to pull this off, you would need to have people that were skeptical and under control and scripted

02:01:06.517 --> 02:01:29.414
like epi girl in the spars pandemic document like jessica rose and meryl nass and robert malone behind somebody who's much more public facing like robert f kennedy jr and then the opposite side to discredit him visor bonnie some that neutralize all human strains some that neutralize some civets but not all the animal strains

02:01:29.926 --> 02:01:34.970
but you do end up with four antibodies that neutralize all strains that we have in our portfolio.

02:01:35.130 --> 02:01:36.591
Four antibodies.

02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:42.376
And so presumably when he says that, I even imagine that he's already gone monoclonal.

02:01:42.436 --> 02:01:54.585
So if he's already gone monoclonal, then he's using full synthetic methodologies and he is making a pure antibody, which would have relatively high specificity for the same, you know, the same sequence and all those molecules.

02:01:54.625 --> 02:01:55.306
That's possible.

02:01:56.161 --> 02:01:57.442
including the ones that were in vitro.

02:01:57.522 --> 02:02:02.927
And the reason why he would do that is because he already knew that that's the way you get intellectual property.

02:02:02.987 --> 02:02:09.653
The polyclonal antibodies, which can be produced to these epitopes, are no longer intellectual

02:02:11.821 --> 02:02:13.343
valid as intellectual property.

02:02:13.403 --> 02:02:28.117
That's what that antibody patent paradox was all about, was that the biology underlying these patents was now understood to not be as high fidelity.

02:02:28.157 --> 02:02:31.840
And so what they were claiming in their patents was not what they could claim.

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.483
They couldn't claim the uniqueness.

02:02:34.683 --> 02:02:37.005
...adapted on human airway cultures.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:47.951
Importantly, if you select for escape mutants, these antibodies select for changes in different locations of the receptor binding domain.

02:02:48.452 --> 02:02:50.674
And in fact, three of them actually don't overlap.

02:02:50.694 --> 02:02:51.295
The S109, the 230, and the 227.

02:02:54.076 --> 02:02:54.756
don't overlap.

02:02:54.796 --> 02:03:17.829
And so the- Well, one thing I would like to say about antibodies is, is that again, like a lot of these molecular biological concepts, if you use them on the bench and you know, you have two proteins in your container and you want an antibody that will separate one protein from the other or, or bind to and fluoresce on one protein or the other, that's pretty easy.

02:03:18.683 --> 02:03:26.270
Because the difference between, you know, the background and the target is so great that you don't need a very special antibody.

02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:39.922
But once you start, you know, doing what they're doing, which is saying that antibodies are special for these epitopes and one base difference or another is difference, then I think they're really implying a specificity that doesn't exist.

02:03:39.942 --> 02:03:42.625
These represent good therapeutic cocktails.

02:03:43.151 --> 02:03:45.192
that would capture most of the diversity.

02:03:45.332 --> 02:03:59.841
And a therapeutic cocktail is what that lady from the plumber lab in Canada was evaluating against or versus remdesivir when she disappeared or was killed in 2020.

02:04:00.261 --> 02:04:02.443
Again, a cocktail of three antibodies.

02:04:02.723 --> 02:04:04.064
I can't remember the name of it, but.

02:04:04.804 --> 02:04:11.348
It exists in SARS and probably work in potential patients that would be infected during future epidemics.

02:04:12.048 --> 02:04:15.510
And these also actually protect young and aged animals from lethal infection.

02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:17.551
That was a paper published by Barry Rock.

02:04:17.591 --> 02:04:28.176
So from his perspective, he might have a monoclonal antibody already in his freezer that could potentially be the pandemic lifesaver and therefore, you know, his, his multi-generational wealth.

02:04:28.276 --> 02:04:32.378
That's, that's what he has been shown as far as his limited script.

02:04:33.498 --> 02:04:34.239
A couple of papers.

02:04:35.679 --> 02:04:39.101
Now, uh, the civet and the raccoon dog strains are the easy ones.

02:04:40.021 --> 02:04:43.063
The true reservoir for SARS is within bat population.

02:04:44.224 --> 02:04:54.271
So if you look at a phylogenetic tree, the human strains are shown here in red, the civet strains, raccoon dog strains are shown in purple, but the real variation is within the bat strains.

02:04:56.013 --> 02:05:00.876
The reservoir, it's thought that these were probably the reservoir for the emergence of the virus.

02:05:02.028 --> 02:05:04.709
Now, these are about 80 to 90% identical to SARS.

02:05:05.389 --> 02:05:09.311
They can't be cultured, and they exist as sequence signatures in silico.

02:05:09.771 --> 02:05:13.673
There's also extensive variation through the replicase and elsewhere in the genome.

02:05:14.213 --> 02:05:17.554
So we decided we were going to synthetically resurrect the entire virus.

02:05:18.815 --> 02:05:25.978
Now, before we started, it's important to note, this is a synthetically resurrect.

02:05:26.038 --> 02:05:27.538
I mean, he said that twice now.

02:05:27.558 --> 02:05:28.679
He didn't have to say that.

02:05:28.699 --> 02:05:30.900
He could say synthetically reconstruct.

02:05:31.837 --> 02:05:35.378
but they use the word resurrect on purpose because this is an enchantment.

02:05:36.338 --> 02:05:40.480
Cryo-EM reconstruction of the SARS glycoprotein spike.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:48.082
Notice that there are three receptor binding domains shown here with bubbles that actually engage the ACE2 receptor.

02:05:48.102 --> 02:06:00.406
If you look at the sequence, the receptor binding domain shown here in yellow, there's a large amount of sequence variation, especially within the contact interface residues that engage the human ACE receptor.

02:06:00.956 --> 02:06:06.038
And in fact, there's only four of 13 contact interface residues that are retained in these bat strains.

02:06:06.738 --> 02:06:10.419
So we don't actually think it's going to use the human ACE receptor to get into cells.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:13.881
In fact, we think we're going to have a tough time culturing this virus.

02:06:14.921 --> 02:06:28.646
Now, it's important to note that the SARS RBD that was identified has been proposed by a couple of groups that it may have been introduced by recombination processes from unknown strains that haven't yet been identified.

02:06:29.144 --> 02:06:33.107
and that that led to the initial cross-species transmission events.

02:06:33.827 --> 02:06:38.851
Now, to get back to the issue of in silico sequences, they actually represent hypothetical viruses.

02:06:39.431 --> 02:06:45.715
Most synthetic viruses that have been resurrected to this point, actually we knew that the sequence was infectious.

02:06:46.896 --> 02:06:50.719
In this case, we actually don't know which of the sequences in GenBank were infectious.

02:06:51.419 --> 02:06:52.700
Ralph Baric is a BS.

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:54.261
Reservoir is fantastic.

02:06:54.301 --> 02:06:55.622
Thank you very much for that laugh.

02:06:56.274 --> 02:07:09.017
So to do that, with an error rate in GenBank ranging from about 1 to 500 to 1 to 10,000, depending on who did the sequence, we had to do extensive bioinformatic analysis to identify what we thought was the likely consensus sequence.

02:07:09.677 --> 02:07:12.597
None of the strains that we actually saw we thought were completely correct.

02:07:13.057 --> 02:07:19.959
Some of them had deletions in the sequence at the five prime end, so we had to make some educated guesses.

02:07:21.199 --> 02:07:25.400
The basic approach that we build coronaviruses using our molecular clone, as shown here,

02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:27.671
with the SARS clone shown in blue.

02:07:28.671 --> 02:07:32.753
The clone is broken into six, five KB, about five KB pieces.

02:07:33.613 --> 02:07:38.535
Each piece is flanked by bagel one restriction endonuclease sites.

02:07:39.096 --> 02:07:45.298
These are class two S restriction enzymes that recognize a palindromic sequence, but cut and leave asymmetric ends.

02:07:45.678 --> 02:07:51.481
It doesn't sound like he's using the restriction enzymes described in the diffuse proposal at all.

02:07:53.542 --> 02:07:53.862
Does it?

02:07:55.327 --> 02:07:59.969
In fact, he's explicitly saying he's not using that technique.

02:07:59.989 --> 02:08:01.089
He has something better.

02:08:02.869 --> 02:08:03.450
Did you hear it?

02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:14.673
This allows, uh, since these ends are asymmetric, basic approach that we build coronaviruses using our molecular clone is shown here with the SARS clone shown in blue.

02:08:15.494 --> 02:08:19.715
It's the clone is broken into a six, five KB, about five KB pieces.

02:08:20.603 --> 02:08:25.486
Each piece is flanked by bagel one restriction endonuclease sites.

02:08:26.106 --> 02:08:29.688
These are class two S restriction enzymes that recognize a palindromic sequence.

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:39.794
So each one of them is the same site, and it's not the enzymes that CHD and Veritas and the diffuse proposal used.

02:08:40.675 --> 02:08:41.435
It's just not.

02:08:42.776 --> 02:08:47.979
And yet here he is showing you exactly how they do the no-see-um technique, the reconstruction of coronaviruses.

02:08:48.019 --> 02:08:49.160
This is how they do it.

02:08:53.393 --> 02:09:03.340
But Kevin McKernan went on a bunch of podcasts saying that, you know, Ralph Baric does it like, well, like the restriction enzymes that, that Alex Washburn and Charles Rixey found.

02:09:05.002 --> 02:09:07.063
That they reported in a diffuse proposal.

02:09:07.083 --> 02:09:08.464
They said they were going to do it.

02:09:11.346 --> 02:09:11.687
Oops.

02:09:14.228 --> 02:09:14.509
Oops.

02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:17.491
But cut and leave asymmetric ends.

02:09:18.493 --> 02:09:29.022
This allows, since these ends are asymmetric, they actually will not concatemerize like classic sticky ends left by restriction enzymes, but rather they become directional.

02:09:29.682 --> 02:09:35.327
So if you end clone A. He can't use regular restriction enzymes to do no-see-um.

02:09:35.927 --> 02:09:38.749
Holy cow, it sounds like I've been right all along, doesn't it?

02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:48.137
With a bagel site that leaves one three-nucleotide overhag and the five prime end of the B fragment with the complementary three-nucleotide overhag, they go together directly.

02:09:48.703 --> 02:09:50.664
You change different bagel sites at each piece.

02:09:51.204 --> 02:09:57.807
And this allows them to assemble up into 30 KB chromosomes like Tinker Toys.

02:09:58.927 --> 02:10:06.290
Now the synthetic bat genome that we made using Blue Heron and BioBasic basically is interchangeable with the Urbani clone.

02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:10.932
Now the point is, is that if they wanted Shengxi Li to find it, they could just make it.

02:10:11.877 --> 02:10:14.998
If they wanted to find it in the wet market, they could just dump it there.

02:10:15.678 --> 02:10:19.900
If they wanted somebody to get sick from it, they could just spray it on them and hope.

02:10:21.521 --> 02:10:24.061
They could spray it on them plus something else.

02:10:25.582 --> 02:10:30.784
If they wanted to find the spike protein, they could spray a smaller DNA molecule.

02:10:31.464 --> 02:10:33.865
If they're going to use PCR to find it, it's foolproof.

02:10:36.144 --> 02:10:45.046
And this is the simple reality that both the no-virus people and the amyloidosis people don't seem to be able to enunciate for six years.

02:10:45.767 --> 02:10:50.328
That's how you can see them as being two sides or three sides of the same scripted fraud.

02:10:52.328 --> 02:11:01.271
The only real difference was that we broke the F-fragment into two pieces so that we could play with the receptor binding domain easily if this thing didn't turn out to be infectious.

02:11:02.352 --> 02:11:07.177
And in fact, we made this clone, we built the full-on cDNA, we drove transcripts, electrocuted that.

02:11:07.538 --> 02:11:19.010
Also, Reginald, think about the idea that if you spent an enormous amount of energy, you know, like with somebody like Nathan Wolfe and his apparatus, characterizing the background that was available,

02:11:19.711 --> 02:11:25.395
then you would have the added benefit of whatever you released could be based on that background.

02:11:25.455 --> 02:11:34.381
And therefore you don't even need to release a lot if, you know, a particular kind of blue paint is already found all around the world, but you want to claim it's spreading.

02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:40.766
You could just dump a little bit here and then claim you found it everywhere else, especially if it's a molecule, right?

02:11:40.846 --> 02:11:42.407
Or a signal in the background.

02:11:42.447 --> 02:11:47.891
And so that's really the level of malevolence that could easily have gone on here.

02:11:48.391 --> 02:11:54.008
where for 20 years the narrative was seated so that everybody would all would never be in a position to question it.

02:11:54.895 --> 02:12:03.500
and that the experts that defined it would be right in the position to maintain it when it would be under question during the pandemic.

02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:06.342
And that's what a national security operation looks like.

02:12:06.823 --> 02:12:13.787
That's why none of these people that are in front of us right now will ever be able to tell you that endemicity is a myth.

02:12:13.867 --> 02:12:19.951
Instead, we have people like Ralph Baric in front of us telling that endemicity is what is the worst case scenario.

02:12:20.411 --> 02:12:22.853
That's also why they can't explain this background

02:12:23.473 --> 02:12:29.575
And why Ralph Baric exists is to make sure that this background is always a limited understanding.

02:12:30.435 --> 02:12:32.955
This is for all the children of Earth, ladies and gentlemen.

02:12:32.995 --> 02:12:34.036
It's for all the marbles.

02:12:34.116 --> 02:12:35.456
So people are going to freak out.

02:12:36.376 --> 02:12:38.997
And it doesn't matter because the truth is the truth.

02:12:39.097 --> 02:12:41.377
You don't need me to learn the truth.

02:12:41.798 --> 02:12:44.998
You just need to know that God didn't send Donald Trump.

02:12:45.038 --> 02:12:47.019
The DOD isn't deploying a kill box.

02:12:47.659 --> 02:13:08.463
The spike shot was not a bioweapon deployed by the DOD, and pandemics, you know, do not occur naturally, is not a very useful way to talk to your family and friends, just like the Trump administration is not destroying our democracy any more than Obama or Clinton or Biden did.

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.936
or George W. Bush.

02:13:12.936 --> 02:13:15.417
COVID is not a disaster of dumb people.

02:13:15.457 --> 02:13:19.579
It was an orchestrated national security theater.

02:13:20.119 --> 02:13:21.680
And pandemics do not happen.

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:23.320
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.621
is not killing a bunch of kids.

02:13:24.661 --> 02:13:27.822
But this is dangerous that that's what the blue and the red think.

02:13:28.322 --> 02:13:29.863
This is very easy, ladies and gentlemen.

02:13:29.903 --> 02:13:32.184
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea for the late 1800s.

02:13:33.684 --> 02:13:36.485
Transfection was always dumb because it's an old technology.

02:13:36.605 --> 02:13:37.805
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:13:38.486 --> 02:13:41.527
And autism is a meaningless word by design.

02:13:42.287 --> 02:13:43.687
Thank you very much for being here.

02:13:43.748 --> 02:13:45.868
Sorry about the disruption in the chat.

02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:56.152
Hopefully they'll tire out like the other ones have or they'll try to sort it out offline because I don't really understand how this is

02:13:56.972 --> 02:13:59.974
the behavior of a normal American man.

02:14:00.594 --> 02:14:09.858
Whatever's going on over the last couple days in my signal chat and now in the chat of my show is some, it feels like a performance.

02:14:09.918 --> 02:14:11.519
I don't know what to tell you, ladies and gentlemen.

02:14:11.539 --> 02:14:16.461
I thought I had a friend and now I have somebody freaking out like a 13-year-old child.

02:14:16.481 --> 02:14:23.785
And so not very dissimilar to how Kevin McCarron flipped out, how Kevin McKernan flipped out.

02:14:24.218 --> 02:14:26.699
When you stop trusting people, they flip out.

02:14:27.739 --> 02:14:29.900
And I don't think friends do that.

02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:36.403
I think actors do that, because they realize they're losing their role on stage.

02:14:36.483 --> 02:14:48.108
So if we don't see Jan Arino again, and if regular guy on YouTube doesn't make any more YouTube videos, or makes one that's anti gigaohm biological, I say watch it.

02:14:48.428 --> 02:14:49.168
Evaluate it.

02:14:49.568 --> 02:14:50.248
I'm not afraid.

02:14:51.989 --> 02:14:52.790
That's who that is.

02:14:53.510 --> 02:15:00.477
I don't know why he's lost his mind, but I guess it's because I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do, and instead I'm doing this.

02:15:00.877 --> 02:15:08.924
So, whatever this car wreck is, I hope it's okay for you, and if you like it, find a way to support it at GigaHomeBiological.com, because I'm not going away.

02:15:09.385 --> 02:15:17.873
Our children are trapped in a national security theater, and Janarito doesn't want me to tell you to get off social media because I'm not providing an alternative.

02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:20.060
That's actually true.

02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:25.702
Janet Reno doesn't want me to tell people to get off social media because I don't have an alternative.

02:15:26.502 --> 02:15:31.423
See you later, Janet.

02:15:31.943 --> 02:15:33.044
It's been nice knowing you.

02:15:33.064 --> 02:15:35.384
Here's the alternative to social media.

02:15:35.444 --> 02:15:37.765
It starts with producing your own peer tube.

02:15:38.625 --> 02:15:39.625
Thanks a lot for being here.

02:15:39.665 --> 02:15:40.626
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:15:42.246 --> 02:15:43.486
What a terrible day.

02:15:45.347 --> 02:15:45.667
Yikes.
