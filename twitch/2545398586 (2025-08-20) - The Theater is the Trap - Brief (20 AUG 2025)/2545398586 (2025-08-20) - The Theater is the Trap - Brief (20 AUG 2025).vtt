He's quick.

He's quick.

He's blowing.

Alright, race him.

Welcome.

01:29.638 --> 01:31.679
Thanks so much for being here.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:35.541 --> 01:36.221
Good to see you guys.

01:41.633 --> 01:42.574
The End

02:03.934 --> 02:08.202
It's smooth sailing all summer long with clever solutions that are here when you need them.

02:18.383 --> 02:18.843
Hello!

02:20.004 --> 02:22.684
So, yesterday, welcome back.

02:22.724 --> 02:23.445
Yesterday, U.S.

02:23.485 --> 02:25.405
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

02:25.445 --> 02:30.206
announced he's firing all the members of the CDC's Vaccine Advisory Committee.

02:30.566 --> 02:33.567
He says he's doing it to restore public trust in vaccines.

02:34.367 --> 02:37.428
But I kind of feel like he might have been one of the loudest voices.

02:38.088 --> 02:39.769
They're calling him vaccine skeptics.

02:40.589 --> 02:44.051
Okay, uh, what what what is what's going on here?

02:44.091 --> 02:48.813
I mean these these folks can't They can make better money elsewhere.

02:48.873 --> 02:49.513
They're doing this.

02:49.613 --> 02:52.714
My question is why does this guy love measles so much?

02:52.774 --> 02:55.876
Yeah, most guys his age starts with me.

02:55.896 --> 02:57.076
He's probably vaccinated.

02:57.156 --> 03:00.938
So he's also All of his children have been vaccinated.

03:00.978 --> 03:01.258
He said

03:01.687 --> 03:02.788
He has vaccinated his children.

03:03.388 --> 03:05.270
But your children, too bad about them.

03:05.630 --> 03:07.191
That's the hypocrisy of it.

03:07.451 --> 03:12.475
And if you think about it, he's saying it's not going to degrade the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines.

03:12.495 --> 03:13.316
That's simply not true.

03:13.336 --> 03:15.998
But I think people need to, again, look at the big picture here.

03:16.018 --> 03:17.239
What is going to happen is,

03:17.739 --> 03:25.104
People are going to, um, millions of people can lose access to vaccines now because you will have to pay for them if they're not recommended.

03:25.665 --> 03:29.548
Um, and, and children will be at greater risk of diseases we haven't faced in decades.

03:29.748 --> 03:37.053
As of last year, mostly unvaccinated children, 241 have died of flu related illnesses, the most for a non-pandemic.

03:37.173 --> 03:41.376
This highlights why the Senate confirmation hearing is so important.

03:42.016 --> 03:56.086
Senator Cassidy, who's a medical doctor, was skeptical of RFK and then eventually ended up voting for him, but said Kennedy promised him, quote, he would maintain the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices without changes.

03:56.166 --> 03:56.766
So he lied.

03:56.866 --> 03:57.647
So that was a lie.

03:57.987 --> 04:02.629
And what Sonny is saying is so important, because some people say, as long as he's not taking away my vaccines.

04:02.709 --> 04:07.552
The problem is, if this is not the recommendation, the insurance companies won't pay for them.

04:07.872 --> 04:14.875
So it becomes a problem where you're going to see a lot of these breakouts that aren't just by people choosing to be unvaccinated.

04:14.935 --> 04:16.736
An average person is not a doctor.

04:16.776 --> 04:17.676
We're not doctors.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.738
We need help in making these decisions from experts.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.478
But my frustration with RFP8, well, is manyfold.

04:23.579 --> 04:33.220
But it's what his supporters told me, because if you care about additives in your food and all these processed things, you have to support him, as if there's no medical doctor who is better equipped to be able to make those recommendations.

04:33.541 --> 04:38.241
And then on the issue of vaccines, the issue on the right was always, well, I want to be able to make my own choice.

04:38.321 --> 04:45.703
But by removing this panel and potential research and development to other vaccines, you're taking the choice away from those of us who do want to get vaccinated.

04:45.723 --> 04:49.184
You're potentially taking research and science away from us that we want access to.

04:49.444 --> 04:50.884
So it's completely contradictory.

04:50.984 --> 04:55.147
Well, it's all about taking your choices away.

04:55.287 --> 04:59.030
It's about, we're going to tell you what you can do with you and your family.

04:59.631 --> 05:02.873
We want to be in charge, except, of course, when we don't want to be.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.576
And we're going to leave it up to the states, except when we don't like it.

05:07.837 --> 05:09.619
Well, you know what they don't like right now?

05:09.659 --> 05:11.360
You see how they're rolling their eyes at me?

05:12.741 --> 05:13.842
They want me to go to break.

05:14.082 --> 05:16.424
Well, we'll be right back.

05:25.399 --> 05:26.900
But you can tell if someone's lying.

05:27.541 --> 05:29.322
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:31.123 --> 05:31.824
And I have lied.

05:31.844 --> 05:32.885
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:32.905 --> 05:34.586
I don't want to lie, you know?

05:34.846 --> 05:35.667
I don't think I'm a liar.

05:35.787 --> 05:36.827
I try not to be a liar.

05:36.847 --> 05:37.688
I don't want to be a liar.

05:38.248 --> 05:40.970
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.281
There are no ethics.

06:15.321 --> 06:18.044
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

06:19.325 --> 06:24.270
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

06:41.367 --> 06:45.628
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

06:45.668 --> 06:51.270
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

06:53.190 --> 06:57.291
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

06:58.672 --> 07:01.392
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

07:01.432 --> 07:03.093
But that's what we're in right now.

07:05.816 --> 07:15.426
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong, all that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

07:16.688 --> 07:26.318
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong, all that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

07:38.830 --> 07:43.092
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

07:43.112 --> 07:48.714
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

07:50.634 --> 07:54.896
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.997
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.678
But that's what we're in right now.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.323
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

09:36.884 --> 09:38.865
We want everybody to feel good.

09:39.426 --> 09:40.567
That's not the way life is.

09:51.238 --> 09:52.239
It's entirely possible.

09:52.259 --> 09:52.760
What time is it?

09:52.860 --> 09:53.200
Game time!

10:13.817 --> 10:16.918
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen from Pittsburgh.

10:16.978 --> 10:22.040
Somebody who's buried deep in the internet, giga home biological, high resistance, low noise.

10:24.061 --> 10:28.323
Information stream brought to you by a biologist with some stuff in his throat.

10:29.183 --> 10:31.764
A social media is a military weapon.

10:31.824 --> 10:33.705
It is the national security theater.

10:33.745 --> 10:35.306
You can't change the script.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.467
You just gotta stop watching.

10:38.728 --> 10:43.471
I know that sounds kind of dark, but that's the way it is because Autism Spectrum Disorder is a myth.

10:44.031 --> 10:53.177
Used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

10:53.977 --> 11:00.980
Ladies and gentlemen, they've done the same thing with pandemics and gain-of-function, flipping us from red to blue and red to blue about all of these things.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.581
They're not talking about you.

11:03.621 --> 11:10.565
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, you are already enslaved by it.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.025
I was.

11:12.245 --> 11:13.906
I know definitely that I was.

11:13.966 --> 11:20.029
I thought I was part of a mystery-solving team on Twitter that was going to save the world once we figured out that it was a lab leak.

11:20.849 --> 11:30.737
And yeah, along the way, I met somebody by the name of Mark Kulak out of Boston, Massachusetts, Usatonic Live, great archive, very nice live streamer.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.158
Welcome back from vacation.

11:32.218 --> 11:35.160
I hope you start producing regularly again.

11:35.240 --> 11:39.103
Ladies and gentlemen, again, this is GigaOM Biological, the biology they ignore.

11:39.644 --> 11:47.129
If you want to follow this live, go to stream.gigaom.bio and use that URL on the PeerTube app and you will be

11:47.850 --> 11:49.151
You will be rocking.

11:49.231 --> 11:51.673
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Joe Marshall.

11:51.713 --> 11:54.515
Why do I keep saying ladies and gentlemen over and over again?

11:54.575 --> 11:55.736
How often do I do that?

11:56.337 --> 11:58.278
Maybe I should pay a little more attention.

11:58.338 --> 12:01.701
Yes, Howard the Duck, you made it to a live stream.

12:02.362 --> 12:04.183
Interesting name, Howard the Duck.

12:04.203 --> 12:08.607
You know, there used to be a tune that I danced to when I was a kid called Disco Duck.

12:09.127 --> 12:11.229
I wonder how many people remember that song.

12:11.289 --> 12:15.993
That 45 got a lot of playing time when I was a kid, as far as I remember.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.480
Um, anyway, uh, good to be here.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.004
Very, very good to be here.

12:21.044 --> 12:21.946
Good to see everybody.

12:21.986 --> 12:23.570
Good to see you in the chat, Jeffrey.

12:23.591 --> 12:23.631
Um,

12:26.069 --> 12:27.250
Yeah, biology is the way.

12:27.310 --> 12:30.193
I don't really know how to say it any better than that.

12:31.294 --> 12:32.795
I am really excited to be here.

12:32.895 --> 12:36.018
I do know that we need to show our children the truth.

12:36.598 --> 12:39.120
It's going to be hard because, you know, they like social media.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.001
They like being there.

12:40.041 --> 12:41.042
They like being seen.

12:41.542 --> 12:45.125
But it's not the right way to go about our business.

12:45.246 --> 12:46.367
And so we need to teach that.

12:46.507 --> 12:48.909
Oh, we need to teach that to our kids.

12:52.321 --> 12:59.290
We need to definitely show our children the truth that the social media that they're using is actually a military weapon.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.934
And we need to stay focused on the biology like this eagle.

13:01.974 --> 13:02.415
See him there?

13:02.575 --> 13:03.396
Focus.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.421
I want you to keep very close eyes on that focus.

13:07.441 --> 13:08.463
Do you see the focus?

13:09.485 --> 13:12.568
Yes, staying focused on the biology is tough.

13:13.189 --> 13:19.335
And you might say that I'm not staying focused on the biology, but actually, I'm always focused on it.

13:19.355 --> 13:24.921
You know that I start my stream staying focused on the biology.

13:27.229 --> 13:32.092
But, you know, there's a lot of stuff... Don't forget to stay focused!

13:33.252 --> 13:38.915
There's a lot of stuff there to pay attention to and a lot of obfuscating going on.

13:39.156 --> 13:42.477
And the trouble is... Wow, that was too quick.

13:42.597 --> 13:43.878
I couldn't stay focused for that one.

13:43.898 --> 13:44.558
Yeah.

13:47.003 --> 13:48.824
We've been had.

13:49.325 --> 13:51.547
It's an elaborate con, ladies and gentlemen.

13:51.587 --> 13:53.248
That's the craziest part about it.

13:53.888 --> 14:00.533
I do really think I've nailed it with regard to starting to speak about this as a sort of sitcom.

14:01.674 --> 14:06.678
If you've been watching some kind of sci-fi show, maybe you like Star Trek.

14:06.998 --> 14:08.600
Maybe you like The Expanse.

14:08.700 --> 14:12.222
The Expanse was a more recent sci-fi outing.

14:13.783 --> 14:14.304
Dabbling.

14:14.364 --> 14:15.785
I don't know who actually made that.

14:15.925 --> 14:17.106
I don't need that guy.

14:17.146 --> 14:20.869
They're just me Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

14:20.929 --> 14:32.499
It's 557 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Coming to you live from the back of my garage If there is a sunset gonna happen back there I'm not sure I have the blinds open right for you to be able to see it.

14:32.559 --> 14:34.160
But welcome to the show.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.922
Thanks for being here unlike

14:37.711 --> 14:47.721
what it might be if you tried to tweet at the set or tweet at the cast of Star Trek to try and change something or to try and save someone.

14:48.282 --> 15:00.214
We have been engaged in a very elaborate long con where we thought by tweeting the right thing or posting the right thing on Facebook or sharing the right video we would be part of a

15:01.235 --> 15:09.623
what everybody told us was a health freedom movement that was really getting the word out about the COVID shots or about the lockdowns or about the silliness of masks.

15:10.124 --> 15:16.930
This was repeated over and over again, much like a hamster wheel repeats over and over again.

15:17.010 --> 15:23.297
And after a very many years of trying to figure out how to get the wheel to roll in a different direction, I

15:25.038 --> 15:28.921
very reluctantly became aware of the fact that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:28.961 --> 15:45.975
and Jayanta Bhattacharya and Marty Makary and all these other people that I thought were legitimate alternatives to the mainstream terrible idea that pandemics are real and lockdowns work and masks are appropriate sometimes and this kind of thing, that

15:47.396 --> 15:54.377
other absurd side of things made it possible for people to consider another absurd side.

15:54.957 --> 16:03.319
And the other absurd side was this anti-vax movement headed by ICAN and Children's Health Defense with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.200
as kind of a front man, but lots of people behind the scenes.

16:07.020 --> 16:11.861
Some people with, you know, really card-carrying autistic kids, you know.

16:12.461 --> 16:13.261
I got a real one.

16:14.082 --> 16:27.514
And they would play that trump card quite regularly, excuse the current pun, on anybody that was coming at them with regard to information or for maybe a counterpoint or something like that.

16:28.155 --> 16:37.263
And a combination of playing the victim and not actually saying what needs to be said, the anti-vax movement has essentially been set up as a trap.

16:37.984 --> 16:52.154
And conservative America and a lot of conservatives around the world that are actively using social media, especially with regard to the pandemic, find themselves, wittingly or unwittingly, trapped by these people and these ideas.

16:52.874 --> 16:55.496
And some of them are as simple as, we don't want mandates.

16:56.156 --> 17:02.461
And you can see already in the video that I shared at the beginning of the stream, that it's very easy to turn that around.

17:03.541 --> 17:07.102
And indeed they are already doing in that and have been doing it for a long time.

17:07.182 --> 17:27.987
So this this Trap that you're in is really actually more terrifying than I thought it was maybe even a year ago because The extent to which the two sides are unaware of what the other side thinks is actually kind of extraordinary Especially in my humble opinion from the perspective of the conservatives in America I

17:29.787 --> 17:33.071
Could I just get somebody to tell me that I'm in sync here?

17:33.131 --> 17:38.696
Because yesterday, somehow, I was incredibly out of sync for the first 45 minutes of the show.

17:39.197 --> 17:42.821
And so, if I am really out of sync right now, I'll probably start again.

17:42.861 --> 17:47.445
But if not, or it's only a little bit, I'm gonna... A 5x5 says, Howard the Duck, thank you very much.

17:48.548 --> 17:59.194
So, again, I'm sorry I'm sitting here kind of in a weird outfit because I've got my shorts on from the gym, so it kind of feels strange if I move my legs around.

17:59.234 --> 18:01.995
I'm going to kind of show you my legs there, I apologize.

18:03.236 --> 18:15.142
We are at a crucial moment in our collective history, I think, and the reason why is because we can explain why social media is dangerous, because what they can do

18:16.135 --> 18:36.657
like a set of a Star Trek bridge, you know the Star Trek Enterprises bridge here, they can put a bunch of people in those chairs, get a bunch of those people to enact a very impressive and very engaging script and unlike Star Trek where you'd have to be a pretty committed fan to start trying to text the cast

18:37.137 --> 18:38.599
and try and change the story.

18:39.059 --> 18:56.458
But if what you're actually looking at on social media is what you think is an accurate representation of a mystery-solving exercise on social media about whether or not masks are necessary or whether or not the Omicron variant is real or not, those kinds of things

18:57.239 --> 19:07.546
on social media are exactly like watching a Star Trek episode and trying to text, tweet, or post something that will change the script.

19:10.088 --> 19:22.636
And that is the danger of social media because they can use that same illusion on heads of state, on people in the bureaucracy, on working men and women, and they can use it on children.

19:24.457 --> 19:25.838
And it's not just to sell stuff.

19:27.523 --> 19:43.643
This is to change the fundamental way that people think of themselves, the responsibilities they have to themselves, the responsibilities they have to their children, and the responsibilities that they may or may not have to their community and their society and their country and their globe.

19:45.990 --> 19:54.916
And this magic trick that's happening on social media is being obfuscated by the idea that it's algorithms or it's AI or it's fake videos.

19:55.397 --> 19:57.778
No, it's fake people on scripts.

19:58.699 --> 20:02.081
Those are the most dangerous things on the internet right now.

20:02.522 --> 20:04.703
It has nothing to do with AI videos.

20:04.763 --> 20:07.065
It has nothing to do with even AI anything.

20:08.146 --> 20:15.431
It has to do with specifically programming certain people to appear to have spontaneously risen.

20:16.744 --> 20:29.618
And yes, they honed this before the pandemic with mundane subjects and mundane creators and mundane examples of artificially making someone popular.

20:30.139 --> 20:37.848
And once they had it working on Etsy, once they had it working with knitting or machining or, you know, crazy videos,

20:39.269 --> 20:57.106
Now they have the basic tool set to make the Rubin Report rise, or make a certain number of people watch Bret Weinstein and his wife, or make a certain number of people who watch the PBS NewsHour also happen to catch Sam Seder on the backside, or catch, I don't know, Luke Beasley or something like that.

20:58.314 --> 21:04.718
And these programming tricks are real and they're not AI and they're not shoulder shrugging.

21:04.738 --> 21:05.959
I don't know how that happened.

21:06.399 --> 21:10.682
This is very carefully done because none of these things are left to chance.

21:10.762 --> 21:13.103
This is a national security operation.

21:14.925 --> 21:19.347
Potentially the entire public health of the globe was at stake.

21:19.407 --> 21:24.851
So I assure you, whatever censorship that you saw was part of a theater.

21:26.983 --> 21:33.666
whatever correction of the censorship is still part of the theater, the real censorship will never be acknowledged.

21:34.206 --> 21:49.393
Because the real censorship is the kind of censorship that they did to me for five years, where no matter how often I made a stream, no matter how good I got at it, even if it's the best show on the entire internet, I've never gotten above 3,200 followers on Twitch.

21:53.516 --> 21:59.141
And on Twitch there are people getting thousands of live views a day.

21:59.842 --> 22:05.548
And so we know the viewers are there, we know the algorithm could serve me, but they don't.

22:05.748 --> 22:07.329
And they don't on purpose.

22:09.471 --> 22:10.732
And that's as easy as that.

22:11.753 --> 22:16.098
If you look at my, or Mark's, or Joe's sort of

22:17.116 --> 22:23.580
performance on YouTube, you will see that at the beginning of our channels, there's kind of what looks like an organic growth.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.801
And then suddenly it's just noise.

22:28.062 --> 22:36.988
Add two subscribers, subtract six, add four, subtract two, add four, subtract six, you know, and it's all day long, up and down, up and down, up and down for years.

22:37.908 --> 22:40.350
But the first two or three months, I just grew.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.191
And then after that, nothing.

22:43.280 --> 22:56.864
And that's the real programming that's going on here that also leads to this, you know, thousands of followers on Substack, thousands of YouTube subscribers, thousands of locals, thousands of Patreons.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.145
How many of those accounts are real?

23:00.265 --> 23:01.645
How many of those are redundant?

23:01.685 --> 23:03.986
How many of those are just straight up money laundering?

23:04.026 --> 23:05.206
We don't really even know.

23:07.168 --> 23:15.631
And these same people can be militarized, represented in hundreds of signal chats, potentially hundreds of telegram groups.

23:16.071 --> 23:20.012
And you think you're in this very special group called the Mystery Solvers.

23:20.072 --> 23:23.854
And in that group is, you know, Paul Merrick and Pierre Kory.

23:23.874 --> 23:24.954
And so it's really special.

23:25.434 --> 23:27.938
And just the other day, you know who joined?

23:28.278 --> 23:29.660
It was Ryan Cole.

23:29.680 --> 23:36.429
And so now I'm in a group with like a hundred other people, and it's Ryan Cole, Pierre, Corey, and they respond every once in a while.

23:36.469 --> 23:38.993
Sometimes they even address my questions.

23:39.073 --> 23:39.694
It's so cool.

23:42.455 --> 24:06.586
And so just let your imagination run wild as to if they put a room full of crafty teenagers in a room with Ryan Cole's accounts, what they could do, how many places he could be at once, and how many people could be fooled into thinking that, wow, I'm one of the lucky ones that gets private messages on Instagram from Peter McCullough.

24:06.886 --> 24:08.006
That's pretty kick-ass.

24:08.306 --> 24:09.347
He gave it a thumbs up.

24:13.578 --> 24:17.620
You got to stop trying to change the script on the Star Trek set.

24:17.660 --> 24:26.645
You got to stop trying to change what the science officer says, because science officer McCullough is always going to say what the script says.

24:26.745 --> 24:30.327
Science officer Corey is always going to say what the script says.

24:30.827 --> 24:35.830
And, you know, Captain Robert Malone is just going to come in that door, and he's going to go back out the door.

24:36.190 --> 24:38.852
And that's just the way it is, because that's how this script goes.

24:43.601 --> 24:51.184
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you have already tried to download the PeerTube app and I hope you've already found out how wonderful it is.

24:51.244 --> 24:52.624
Maybe you're already watching.

24:53.464 --> 25:03.148
And the only reason, I mean the only reason not to watch on PeerTube is because maybe you really feel good about being in this chat, which I can

25:03.948 --> 25:10.091
bring in like this, I can bring the chat in, you know, so, you know, TaxiCube, Fletch, you know, I see you guys there.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.512
Sync is super good.

25:11.572 --> 25:12.273
That's really great.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.274
But, you know, I read the chat.

25:15.434 --> 25:15.975
It's fine.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.576
And we are going to get there eventually.

25:18.656 --> 25:21.698
I do think that the PeerTube app is eventually going to have

25:22.478 --> 25:23.398
the chat in it.

25:23.498 --> 25:25.319
Whoops, lost my mouse there for a second.

25:25.740 --> 25:26.920
So I'm very excited about it.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.601
I'm very happy that it works so well.

25:28.681 --> 25:30.502
And I do really think this is the way forward.

25:30.542 --> 25:35.244
This is how you don't have to look up on YouTube, Rumble, Twitch, anywhere.

25:35.844 --> 25:39.726
It'll be on your phone with no ads, no logins, nothing.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.807
It's really, it's really magnificent.

25:42.407 --> 25:48.390
Anybody that's tried it has said that it's just heads and shoulders above the

25:49.500 --> 25:50.441
above the website.

25:50.481 --> 25:54.726
The website for me was always, you know, hit and miss and it would stall out, you have to reload it.

25:55.206 --> 26:02.994
The only thing that the website has that the, you know, maybe you might like is that it does kind of put a cookie in and remember where you were.

26:03.034 --> 26:08.660
So if you come back to a video, it remembers that, you know, where you were when you last watched it.

26:08.740 --> 26:10.883
But with regard to the

26:11.932 --> 26:13.273
The app not doing that.

26:13.453 --> 26:15.194
I don't know that that's that big of a deal.

26:15.254 --> 26:18.355
I mean, you know, you can kind of scroll forward pretty easy.

26:18.415 --> 26:20.916
So ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

26:20.956 --> 26:27.119
This last six years of nonsense has obfuscated the fact that it's basically manslaughter and lies.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.782
Um, that might say murder there, but maybe manslaughter manslaughter.

26:31.962 --> 26:34.783
Um, yeah, maybe manslaughter is a better word, but you know,

26:35.263 --> 26:36.604
Let's get the point across here.

26:37.644 --> 26:39.744
People were killed and they lied to us about it.

26:39.824 --> 26:44.506
And more importantly, people that were already kind of expected to die anyway, died.

26:44.566 --> 26:51.388
And so a lot of these national security people don't really give a shit because they see themselves governing a pretty big farm.

26:51.768 --> 26:54.329
And so if some animals die, that's just an average year.

26:55.148 --> 26:57.229
You know, three million Americans die every year.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.170
That's the average year.

26:58.510 --> 27:18.162
And if this year they pushed a few numbers higher, nobody at the controls, nobody in the control tower thinks that's that big of a deal, especially with regard to, you know, governing what's happening with America right now, because I don't want to be one of those people, but there is a debt.

27:20.253 --> 27:22.855
And that debt is mathematically increasing.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.258
And it has been doing that for quite some time.

27:25.318 --> 27:27.900
And people have been telling us about that for quite some time.

27:27.940 --> 27:32.885
And so my guess is that this math can't go on into infinity.

27:32.985 --> 27:38.931
And my guess is, is that they have some plan for some kind of financial reset that maybe the Amaro

27:39.891 --> 27:42.934
maybe a North American currency, you know, because Canada sucks too.

27:43.575 --> 27:47.679
I don't really know what their plan is, but I do know for sure it's for all the marbles.

27:47.739 --> 27:55.185
And I do know for sure that they're going to try and make the ground under us so unstable that we won't be able to keep up with the biology anymore.

27:55.225 --> 27:58.368
We won't help it, but take their bait on social media.

27:58.729 --> 28:01.051
And we won't be able to keep our children out of it.

28:03.567 --> 28:05.728
And so it's very serious right now.

28:05.808 --> 28:17.135
We need to get very serious about number one, first and foremost, I don't know how to say it any other way, you need to share this stream or anything that you know that's better.

28:18.255 --> 28:20.116
And you need to share it with young people.

28:20.777 --> 28:24.659
Young people who are mature enough to hear the word shithead and not cringe.

28:25.735 --> 28:32.678
and old enough and mature enough to understand that they are about to be adults and they're going to be surrounded by other adults.

28:33.339 --> 28:38.021
And if they have their wits about them, they could actually turn this situation to their advantage.

28:39.521 --> 28:43.843
You could be one of the people that can see in a world full of blind people.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.845
And your kids could be that too.

28:48.251 --> 28:49.692
It's not just the biology.

28:50.212 --> 28:58.035
It is very, very much important to see that it's actually seeing through social media, how it's used against you and then disengaging.

28:58.436 --> 29:11.541
And if we could get a generation of high school kids to start building peer tubes and start building soapbox instances for their high schools or for their class or for, I mean, that is the way forward.

29:14.043 --> 29:14.723
I'm sure of it.

29:15.609 --> 29:23.852
The way forward is not to fight for more free speech somewhere inside of their corporal social media because that's ridiculous.

29:26.953 --> 29:33.355
That's like arguing that some prisoners inside of a maximum security prison are free and others are not.

29:38.151 --> 29:47.084
There is a very succinct way to explain it to anyone you love, to challenge anyone you love, to really start to think about what's going on here.

29:47.485 --> 29:50.209
We are not saying that vaccines are bad.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.293
We are not saying that vaccines cause autism.

29:53.894 --> 29:56.376
We are not saying anything remotely close to that.

29:56.416 --> 30:05.442
What we are saying is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances originates, that idea originates in the late 1800s.

30:05.502 --> 30:09.165
And that might be a very good reason to reconsider its value.

30:10.446 --> 30:15.450
It might be a very dumb idea that nobody ever really questioned.

30:16.190 --> 30:16.951
And now we're here.

30:17.331 --> 30:18.472
That is possible.

30:20.666 --> 30:39.375
And if that's true, then many of the subcutaneous and cutaneous vaccinations, the oral vaccinations may have in fact changed the biology of their recipients in a less toxic, maybe even semi-useful way with regard to some environmental signal.

30:41.696 --> 30:45.838
Imagine the possibility that the measles vaccine actually works.

30:47.585 --> 30:56.321
that subcutaneous injection almost cannot cause immune dysregulation, but intramuscular injection can.

30:58.055 --> 31:03.999
Now imagine a scenario where you wanted to make sure that a huge population of people never figured that out.

31:04.039 --> 31:09.683
Well, how about set up an anti-vax movement that said that we don't want any mandates?

31:09.983 --> 31:14.886
How about setting up an anti-vax movement that says that we want to build a big top tent of health freedom?

31:15.247 --> 31:27.695
How about we set up an anti-vax movement that focuses on individual untested adjuvants or claims that vaccines haven't been tested against placebos instead of talking about the biological ridiculousness

31:28.135 --> 31:31.396
of injecting intramuscularly and then being nuanced about it.

31:35.398 --> 31:40.681
Transfection is an old technology that they renamed during the pandemic.

31:43.862 --> 31:45.543
And that's the best way to say it.

31:46.431 --> 31:50.312
hat tip to regular guy on YouTube for that because that's really the way it is.

31:50.372 --> 32:01.475
They've taken a bunch of old technologies and renamed them and, and been very sort of ambiguous about it with regard to, you know, their gene therapies or gene technologies or something like that.

32:01.515 --> 32:07.396
These are, you know, and then arguing about whether or not if they called it gene technology, that FDA would regulate it differently.

32:07.456 --> 32:08.216
No, no, no.

32:09.417 --> 32:15.458
The most important thing to understand is that the FDA would treat it very differently if they admitted that it was old technology.

32:18.149 --> 32:43.195
Once you see how much importance, how much at the center of this is the intellectual property, talking about profits and talking about pharmaceutical companies and saying that they want to make money without admitting that they're making money and money in the future off of the profits.

32:43.215 --> 32:46.276
I mean, sorry, the patents that they have.

32:48.397 --> 33:00.020
never talking about the fact that the value of the antibody patents that all of these companies had greatly dropped after the antibody patent paradox and the decision that happened in 2021 or 22.

33:04.141 --> 33:12.243
And so there was a lot of shuffling around and behind the scenes, and it's very dumb simple to say that pharmaceutical companies want to make a lot of money.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.704
Pharmaceutical companies want IP.

33:17.833 --> 33:38.093
And so it's interesting that none of these people in the background, none of these people on either side, none of them ever really talk with very much precision about the intellectual property and how it grew or didn't grow or how it became real or not, or how it skipped evaluation or not, or how it just became accepted as a gold standard without ever being evaluated.

33:38.133 --> 33:41.456
For example, like, I don't know, the PCR testing that we're using.

33:43.015 --> 33:51.282
that all of these dissident doctors on the right that pretended to be part of this, you know, health freedom movement have never questioned.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.345
Extraordinarily never questioned.

33:55.366 --> 34:01.652
Pierre Corey, you know, Mary Talley Bowden, Peter McCullough,

34:02.777 --> 34:16.604
None of these people are able to explain to you that using PCR as a diagnostic on an infinitesimally, irreducibly complex background of bacteriophage signals and bacteria and noise is ridiculous.

34:18.184 --> 34:20.426
After six years, they still can't say it.

34:20.866 --> 34:25.608
And the only thing we can really say is that, you know, Carey Mullis told us.

34:26.869 --> 34:28.169
But think about how sad that is.

34:32.659 --> 34:42.146
We have thousands of highly trained biologists in America alone and somehow or another I haven't found one?

34:43.576 --> 34:48.419
Not one has been able to get far enough to say that, oh yeah, it's just transfection, they renamed it.

34:48.859 --> 34:52.181
Oh yeah, I never, yeah, RNA cannot pandemic.

34:52.621 --> 34:53.902
That makes perfect sense.

34:54.262 --> 35:03.247
You can hear Sukrit Bhakti say it out loud, and then you can drop your mouth to the floor when Sukrit Bhakti says, well, now that we understand that, why would we keep talking about it?

35:04.647 --> 35:09.430
You know, as long as we all know that that's true, why would we talk about it anymore?

35:09.450 --> 35:11.191
We might as well stop talking about it.

35:13.134 --> 35:15.655
These people are malevolent players.

35:15.715 --> 35:16.876
They are scripted players.

35:16.956 --> 35:23.659
I think Sukrit Bhakti could have been warned that this is what he needed to do, or we're going to put you back in jail.

35:29.062 --> 35:36.526
The most beautiful thing that I've been managed to say in the last few weeks is that autism is a meaningless word by design.

35:38.334 --> 35:45.437
I think that saying this right now is what 2013 Brian Hooker would have said.

35:47.858 --> 35:58.603
And instead now, Brian Hooker has a book, is doing well as part of CHD, behind Bobby Kennedy.

35:59.381 --> 36:03.502
lured all these people into the health freedom movement and kept them there.

36:04.282 --> 36:06.623
I guess to get Bobby close to the White House.

36:06.723 --> 36:10.824
I guess to get Bobby where he is now, where we have a universal flu vaccine in the works.

36:11.264 --> 36:17.705
I guess to get, I don't know, Jayanta Bhattacharya at the head of NIH so he could get a good podcast every week.

36:20.626 --> 36:27.828
Brian Hooker is a scripted failure because in 2013, he was exactly where I am now.

36:30.401 --> 36:34.802
Where he didn't use the word autism, he didn't like the word autism, his son was vaccine damaged.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.663
He was neurologically damaged.

36:39.984 --> 36:46.026
And so saying that vaccines cause autism is exactly the trap.

36:47.746 --> 36:50.007
And I know for sure because I was in it.

36:50.707 --> 36:56.789
I got the scars, the handshakes, and the selfies to show you that these people are frauds.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.910
Because I tried to give them this.

37:02.671 --> 37:11.014
I thought that joining them, I would help them to finally get where they didn't quite ever get before.

37:11.414 --> 37:28.821
And then it slowly and painfully became obvious that there was a reason why Sherry Tenpenny and James Lyons Weiler and Suzanne Humphreys, they all didn't progress.

37:30.322 --> 37:31.242
Not even a little bit.

37:32.472 --> 37:41.759
In all the decades, you know, all the thousands of hours, all the papers, you know, obsession for 25 years because God told them to do it.

37:42.920 --> 37:43.780
They never got here.

37:46.302 --> 37:48.304
They never got here because they were on a script.

37:53.148 --> 38:01.614
And that's why none of these people have been able to take a little, you know, some pictures like this and explain to you how, if there was a background of green and purple,

38:03.160 --> 38:10.629
And they knew did not have any reason to care about it because doctors didn't test for the green and the purple.

38:11.129 --> 38:15.514
Doctors didn't even have a PCR test to test for the green and the purple before the pandemic.

38:15.934 --> 38:20.860
And then at the start of the pandemic, they said, hey, there's a red thing and we've got this test for it.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.422
But the test was for the green thing.

38:23.683 --> 38:31.566
So they turned the green thing into the red thing with a test and you and me and everybody used the test to find the green thing and called it the red thing.

38:31.906 --> 38:38.409
This is how you would use a background and misconstrue it as spread with a stupid PCR test.

38:38.789 --> 38:48.133
Now the beauty of it is, is if you worked hard enough before the pandemic, you might've also found a purple and a red and a blue and a yellow in the background that was pretty stable.

38:48.593 --> 38:53.997
so that as the pandemic moved on, you could just kind of claim that you were finding new shit, you know?

38:54.277 --> 38:56.919
Like, oh my gosh, Omicron, now it's purple.

38:59.781 --> 39:14.150
And the whole time it's really just a background, an infinitesimally, irreducibly complex background of signals from all the life on Earth, but mostly from bacteria and their bacteriophages, you know, like 70% of it.

39:15.993 --> 39:39.848
In fact, metagenomic sequencing, the technique, was invented by somebody trying to explore the panorama of bacteriophages that coral reefs have to deal with, and that coral reef bacteria deal with, and that coral reef algae deal with, and that they deal with using mucus, just like the mucus in your gut.

39:43.052 --> 40:03.141
And so this story will be told, ladies and gentlemen, it will be told to our kids, and our kids will learn that the pandemic was a complete hoax, but not a complete hoax like, you know, I don't know, somebody as imprecise as Alec Zek could tell you, or Andrew Kaufman.

40:05.502 --> 40:10.784
These frauds will never tell you that there was a expected rise in all cause mortality.

40:10.844 --> 40:12.445
I think I have to restart this slide.

40:13.592 --> 40:20.355
They will never tell you that there was an expected rise in all-cause mortality that they've seen coming since I graduated from high school in 1990.

40:22.176 --> 40:32.961
And that expected rise in all-cause mortality, as it rose up to the top, people were complaining about the fact that, you know, Social Security's gonna go under when all these old people get old.

40:33.401 --> 40:36.943
Medicare's gonna crash when all these old people stop paying taxes.

40:37.864 --> 40:46.272
And they yelled about it and yelled about it and yelled about it until 2017, when Tony Fauci said, hey, hey, hey, relax guys.

40:46.712 --> 40:51.657
You know, it's certain that in this administration, there's gonna be something to deal with, a pandemic.

40:52.438 --> 40:53.679
And so, you know, it's fine.

40:53.739 --> 40:54.820
We got this under control.

40:57.165 --> 41:01.688
And then in 2017, 18, 19, they put people on the internet, you know?

41:02.529 --> 41:10.334
Joe Rogan has already been on sci-fi and then he transitioned into podcasting and they figured out these conversations work great for convincing people of dumb shit.

41:10.754 --> 41:13.636
So why don't we put a bunch of people on the internet before

41:14.036 --> 41:34.920
the pandemic before this big bump actually comes, you know, the anticipated rise in all cause mortality, before it comes, we need to get these people on the internet so that in 2019, in December, we can really have, you know, people like Sam Harris say that, you know, when the next pandemic comes and it's killing 70% of the people on earth, we're not going to have any, any room for anti-vaxxers anymore.

41:36.121 --> 41:42.922
And then when the pandemic started, of course, they recruited a bunch of doctors and other people to make fools of themselves and make fools of us.

41:45.796 --> 41:50.499
And that's where we are in 2025, where anybody that believed in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:50.519 --> 42:12.113
or even thought that maybe it's possible that Donald Trump is not a stooge, you guys, we got, but we got fooled big time, but we got fooled by the biggest and most ubiquitous, you know, so most expansive internet-based psychological operation in the history of humankind.

42:12.958 --> 42:19.562
So, you know, yeah, we fell for something pretty bad, but everybody's falling for it.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.945
As I showed you in the introduction, everybody's falling for it.

42:22.965 --> 42:29.489
The people who fell for lockdowns, masks, shots, you know, iPads aren't that bad for my kid.

42:29.829 --> 42:33.952
You know, playing an instrument with this shit on your face makes perfect sense.

42:35.939 --> 42:42.442
Those parents are just as dumb as we were when we fell for Donald Trump.

42:42.482 --> 42:46.103
The trick is, is that right now we're the ones that are looking like fools.

42:46.143 --> 42:48.144
We're the ones that are being made fools of.

42:48.604 --> 42:51.525
And we are the ones who can't see it on social media.

42:51.565 --> 42:53.106
These people think we killed people.

42:55.612 --> 43:02.853
So this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, of course, as you know, I've told you many times, was sculpted by murder and lies.

43:03.334 --> 43:11.455
And so if you think this man is a hero, if someone you know, someone you love was fooled by him, you go on biologicals where you need to send them.

43:12.455 --> 43:24.958
I think that we can get America out of this by showing our kids that this two-party theater is indeed a theater and that it's elections as they stand right now are irrelevant because it's a national security priority.

43:25.908 --> 43:28.451
And both sides, you know, they're in on it.

43:28.571 --> 43:34.598
So maybe there's election rigging, but they're never going to actually admit that they rig it all the time.

43:34.658 --> 43:39.463
They just want you to believe, you know, that this time it was them or that time it was them or, you know, whatever.

43:40.874 --> 43:41.935
It's always rigged.

43:41.995 --> 43:43.216
That's the way you should see it.

43:43.617 --> 43:58.132
And so Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anybody that rises into clear view are what I like to call need-to-know basis scripted actors, meaning that they just say what they're said because they aren't even Star Trek fans and they are Star Trek actors.

43:58.212 --> 44:03.457
And so they're not even smart enough to know that the Romulans don't

44:04.638 --> 44:14.806
uh i don't know the Romulans and the Ferengi are not friends i don't even know if those two races are on the same brand of Star Trek but anyway my point is is that it

44:16.129 --> 44:29.132
A person can be on a Star Trek series and be an actor on the series and be a science officer on the series, and if they read and memorize their lines very well, they can say some pretty impressive shit.

44:29.412 --> 44:31.653
But that doesn't mean they know what's going on.

44:31.733 --> 44:41.615
And even if they were a sci-fi fan and could argue about the history of the statement or the background information that motivates them to say it in the way that they say it,

44:41.915 --> 44:45.257
They're still committed to the script and they are still actors.

44:45.757 --> 44:49.939
And they don't care if in the next episode they have to say different stuff.

44:50.239 --> 44:55.041
They'll just practice it, learn the line perfectly, look in the mirror and say it, and then do it on command.

44:57.843 --> 45:00.284
And that's what social media is doing to us.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.825
It is cable TV.

45:02.065 --> 45:03.345
It's not social media.

45:03.726 --> 45:05.446
Podcasts are cable TV.

45:06.607 --> 45:08.688
Scripted bullshit.

45:11.226 --> 45:16.807
Trump might've not even known that he was gonna be fake shot until he was fake shot.

45:18.887 --> 45:22.088
And that's why he's so happy to show you that stupid painting.

45:22.548 --> 45:29.749
Nobody who actually got shot at and lived would make a painting like that and be so lackadaisical about it.

45:29.829 --> 45:30.889
It's ridiculous.

45:32.270 --> 45:36.150
But it's a national security theater for dummies.

45:36.190 --> 45:37.671
That's why it's so ridiculous.

45:38.031 --> 45:39.151
And it's super simple.

45:40.179 --> 45:41.600
It was manslaughter and lies.

45:41.660 --> 45:44.882
And they put a bunch of jackasses on social media to lie about it.

45:46.383 --> 45:47.724
And we're there right now.

45:47.804 --> 45:48.745
That's where we are.

45:49.345 --> 46:01.693
And if we, as the conservative right, whatever that is, I'm on the conservative right, if there is a conservative something or other, we need to wake up and apologize for being here right now.

46:02.113 --> 46:08.978
And the problem is, is that you don't really have to apologize for much because the alternative was Harris, of course.

46:12.014 --> 46:13.195
And so it was a trap.

46:14.897 --> 46:15.879
There was no winning.

46:17.921 --> 46:22.446
You just have to help them see that the trap was for you and me.

46:23.567 --> 46:28.413
You have to help them see that the Harris was part of the trap for you and me.

46:28.834 --> 46:30.576
Otherwise they'd have picked somebody else.

46:33.763 --> 46:37.805
And then maybe your family and friends will start to come around to your side.

46:37.866 --> 46:42.208
Remember, the whole time you need to be eating crow because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:42.288 --> 46:46.611
is just a Truman show and Donald Trump is not playing 5-D chess.

46:47.011 --> 46:49.973
People are using him to play 5-D chess on us.

46:53.595 --> 46:55.596
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

46:55.956 --> 47:05.898
What is your message to CDC employees who are concerned that there's a culture that's been created around vaccine skepticism and disinformation?

47:05.918 --> 47:11.520
Well, I mean, my message coming here was to offer condolence to

47:13.143 --> 47:15.264
a family of police officers.

47:15.304 --> 47:24.569
So we're supposed to believe that, that, you know, somebody, I'm not saying that they weren't shot at the CDC, but now he spent a significant amount of time going down there.

47:24.969 --> 47:32.232
We're supposed to believe that the health and human services secretary is doing his job by being on Scripps News Exclusive.

47:32.593 --> 47:37.295
We're supposed to believe that these podcasts are real.

47:39.261 --> 47:43.802
But our family and friends on the left don't see any of this bullshit.

47:46.103 --> 47:47.564
They're not paying attention to it.

47:47.644 --> 47:51.385
This is not the truth getting out, like they say in CHD.

47:51.745 --> 47:54.886
This is not the truth getting out, like they say on the high wire.

47:55.346 --> 48:02.128
This is the truth being permanently hidden and fed to the gullible.

48:05.569 --> 48:08.890
And keep them safe and allow them to do their critical work.

48:10.032 --> 48:17.137
So what is the plan to sort of quell disinformation, misinformation so that something like this doesn't happen again?

48:17.157 --> 48:24.781
Well, you know, I would say that we don't know enough about what the motive was of this individual.

48:26.022 --> 48:28.564
But people can ask questions.

48:29.104 --> 48:33.887
And so now we're trying to figure out why this guy was shot at the CDC and he's on the case.

48:34.027 --> 48:34.888
Come on.

48:35.648 --> 48:36.048
Really?

48:38.180 --> 48:39.361
without being penalized.

48:39.721 --> 48:49.794
And you know, there was attacks on the NFL the other day by a shooter who was concerned that he got a brain injury from playing football.

48:51.115 --> 48:57.061
And nobody blamed the New York Times for spreading that disinformation that football can cause injuries.

48:58.202 --> 49:07.570
What we need to do at our agency is to make sure the public believes in the things that we're saying.

49:10.854 --> 49:15.478
We have to make sure the public believes in the things we are saying.

49:16.939 --> 49:18.820
I think actually he told the truth there.

49:18.860 --> 49:19.861
That's that's pretty good.

49:20.301 --> 49:21.422
Wow.

49:22.563 --> 49:22.843
Wow.

49:24.364 --> 49:26.145
That we do that is by telling the truth.

49:27.446 --> 49:39.055
And what I'm trying to do with the agency is return it to gold standard science to make sure that anything that we tell the public, we tell the public what we know and what we don't know.

49:40.456 --> 49:46.460
And one of the things that we saw during COVID is that the government was overreaching.

49:47.841 --> 49:51.243
And I hope I am making myself very clear.

49:51.283 --> 49:52.964
It's a need-to-know basis actor.

49:52.984 --> 49:54.165
This is not a genius.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.686
This is not a smart guy.

49:55.706 --> 49:57.026
This is an actor.

49:58.007 --> 49:59.468
And he's allowed to improvise.

49:59.508 --> 50:02.470
So he's a certain kind of skilled actor.

50:03.456 --> 50:06.837
And that's why they had to audition for so long or train for so long.

50:06.877 --> 50:16.401
A lot of these people are very skilled improvisational actors, but they're skilled because they're able to stay on their need-to-know basis script.

50:16.842 --> 50:22.444
That's what makes them qualified to be a national security state actor and work in this theater.

50:23.359 --> 50:28.363
And so he was groomed, he was coached, and he was Truman showed for almost his whole life.

50:28.443 --> 50:37.271
But the people behind him are pretty nasty people because I do believe they're very aware of the lying they're engaged in as part of their job.

50:37.812 --> 50:40.394
And so those people I have very little sympathy for.

50:40.814 --> 50:47.360
And if I name their names and say their names badly, that's because they are in my humble opinion, traitors to my grandkids.

50:53.047 --> 51:03.777
He's effectively now has some random person deciding what is appropriate for the Smithsonian to teach in terms of American history, things that don't offend parts of the MAGA base, right?

51:03.837 --> 51:09.322
So we're now literally reviewing parts of American history and parts of American culture to make sure it comports

51:10.043 --> 51:11.924
with Dear Leader and what the MAGA organization wants.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.645
Can we address some of those things that are in there?

51:13.886 --> 51:16.708
Because have you looked at some of the things that have been reviewed?

51:16.768 --> 51:18.669
Yeah, slavery was a bad thing that was to talk about.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.750
He forgave me for saying that.

51:19.770 --> 51:20.970
He's not whitewashing slavery.

51:21.070 --> 51:24.513
I believe that Julian believes everything that she's doing.

51:24.593 --> 51:27.375
She's very excited to be doing what she's doing.

51:27.435 --> 51:32.118
She loves her job and she probably has some coaches behind her.

51:32.998 --> 51:37.802
And those coaches are the same coaches that if you look at her YouTube channel,

51:38.888 --> 51:46.199
and you go back in its history, you will find random videos made by Jillian and very little change.

51:46.219 --> 51:47.901
She's just working like a YouTuber.

51:47.941 --> 51:51.407
And then suddenly, Vincent Rackin' Yellow.

51:52.729 --> 51:58.291
And I don't know if that podcast didn't work out or it didn't feel right, but that audition didn't get her anywhere.

51:58.311 --> 52:07.715
And then a year later, bing, here comes this Steffenberger clown from California that's been on, you know, Bret Weinstein a lot.

52:07.775 --> 52:12.237
And all those people that have been in that circle started going on her podcast.

52:12.297 --> 52:20.920
And a year and a half later, here she is on CNN and on Piers Morgan and on all these other shows, because that's how this works.

52:22.566 --> 52:30.711
If you pass your audition, they give you a little more complicated script, give you a little more leeway, get you on bigger places, and she's doing great.

52:31.371 --> 52:33.892
And I don't think that she's a bad person.

52:34.833 --> 52:40.716
She's a very, very eager actor.

52:45.232 --> 52:46.133
So he's not?

52:46.153 --> 52:46.833
He's not, no.

52:46.893 --> 52:47.233
Okay.

52:47.293 --> 52:47.714
He's not.

52:48.314 --> 52:56.798
And you cannot tie imperialism and racism and slavery to just one race, which is pretty much what every single exhibit does.

52:57.159 --> 52:59.100
Well, let's talk about the fact that when you... You mean anti-slavery?

52:59.140 --> 53:05.343
Let's talk about the fact... I mean, slavery in America was... Do you realize that only less than 2% of white Americans owned slaves?

53:05.503 --> 53:06.584
It was a system of white supremacy.

53:06.604 --> 53:09.546
Do you realize that slavery is thousands of years old?

53:09.586 --> 53:14.830
Do you know who was the first racist to try to end slavery?

53:14.870 --> 53:18.412
I'm very surprised that you're trying to litigate.

53:18.552 --> 53:19.793
I'm really surprised.

53:19.873 --> 53:22.355
Jillian, I'm surprised that you're trying to litigate

53:24.637 --> 53:29.521
Now, this is again, remember, a national security theater.

53:29.561 --> 53:33.744
You're supposed to feel like they're about to gang up on her.

53:33.764 --> 53:36.946
You're supposed to feel like, but you're not listening to her.

53:37.046 --> 53:39.928
She's just saying that there was slavery before America.

53:39.968 --> 53:44.492
She's just saying that there's a lot of human history before American history started.

53:44.892 --> 53:47.494
She's just trying to point out that it's not our idea.

53:48.815 --> 54:14.699
and this is supposed to feel like that because it's a national security theater with need-to-know bases scripted actors and they think they're dunking on her and she thinks that she's being ganged up on and that is real but this exists because of a military operation because this is for all the marbles this is for the grandchildren of earth

54:16.451 --> 54:18.591
And they need you to surrender your sovereignty.

54:18.611 --> 54:23.933
They need your grandkids to surrender their sovereignty, to wake up without it, to be born without it.

54:25.513 --> 54:29.994
And so, yes, this is a full court press with this nonsense.

54:30.354 --> 54:34.955
Absolutely full court press with people that were elevated, scripted actors.

54:35.235 --> 54:36.215
That's why she's there.

54:37.136 --> 54:37.896
She's bad.

54:38.736 --> 54:40.436
She's not like a Jessica Rose.

54:41.937 --> 54:43.377
She's not like a Meryl Nass.

54:44.704 --> 54:46.906
but she's also not like a Mary Talley Bowden.

54:47.026 --> 54:50.849
This is like a person who really just wants a part.

54:50.889 --> 54:52.791
This is like a Shannon Joy.

54:52.831 --> 55:03.160
What I'm trying to tell you is that in the context of American history, what are you saying is incorrect by saying that it was white people oppressing black people?

55:05.262 --> 55:08.143
is like, oh, no, no, no, this is all because white people bad.

55:08.623 --> 55:11.243
And that's just not the truth.

55:11.323 --> 55:15.904
Like, for example, every single exhibit, I have a list of every single one.

55:16.264 --> 55:20.465
Like, people migrated from Cuba because white people bad.

55:20.905 --> 55:22.725
Not because of Castro.

55:22.765 --> 55:23.665
Yes, no, it's in there.

55:23.685 --> 55:24.345
That's what I'm saying.

55:24.365 --> 55:25.505
You don't actually know what's in there.

55:25.705 --> 55:29.126
Do you know that when you walk in the front door, the first thing you see is a gay flag?

55:29.146 --> 55:31.326
Jillian, you have a lot of stuff in front of you.

55:31.366 --> 55:33.467
What exactly are you talking about?

55:33.487 --> 55:34.327
OK, I'll give you an example.

55:34.687 --> 55:37.388
There's one called Change Your Game, right?

55:37.508 --> 55:39.909
This has been an installation there.

55:40.389 --> 55:42.450
Is gender testing fair in sports?

55:43.091 --> 55:48.373
Does that... And then it goes on to talk about how it's complex to do gender testing in sports.

55:48.993 --> 55:49.854
It's not complex.

55:49.894 --> 55:51.114
It's basic science.

55:51.154 --> 55:51.975
That's untrue.

55:52.055 --> 55:54.696
It's XX chromosome, XY chromosome.

55:55.156 --> 55:56.436
That's sports.

55:56.857 --> 55:57.457
Is it fair?

55:57.757 --> 56:00.118
So you see, we've talked about this before.

56:00.218 --> 56:01.598
It is being set up.

56:01.658 --> 56:05.499
You are being walked into a trap and she's leading you into it.

56:06.859 --> 56:09.920
You're supposed to feel that, but it's a trap.

56:11.581 --> 56:14.522
And we need to make sure that our kids don't fall into this.

56:14.562 --> 56:18.383
We need to make sure that our communities don't fall victim to this.

56:18.883 --> 56:19.703
It is a trap.

56:22.808 --> 56:27.370
to have biological men competing against biological women in sports, no.

56:27.530 --> 56:29.271
But why is this in the Smithsonian?

56:29.831 --> 56:33.133
So it's been completely captured.

56:33.193 --> 56:37.034
First of all, we don't have time to litigate all of this.

56:37.054 --> 56:39.535
Of course we don't, because then you're going to lose the argument.

56:39.856 --> 56:42.817
Everything is racialized, just like you're trying to do to me now.

56:44.011 --> 56:44.571
Excuse me.

56:44.692 --> 56:46.513
I can't believe you're trying to suggest.

56:46.573 --> 56:49.515
Just to be clear, you brought up race.

56:49.695 --> 56:49.835
No.

56:49.855 --> 56:52.758
This was a conversation about the arts, and you brought up race.

56:52.798 --> 56:53.438
It isn't, though.

56:53.458 --> 56:57.161
You brought up... But the whole point of this is that the... You see how this works, right?

56:58.696 --> 57:03.259
It is really bad, ladies and gentlemen, because it doesn't matter if we could argue that better.

57:03.299 --> 57:10.784
It doesn't matter if all of us could hold that ground better, or could have worded it better, or could have just kept our mouths shut.

57:11.604 --> 57:16.607
This is what's happening in the imagination of most Americans.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.850
This is what America is experiencing right now.

57:20.870 --> 57:26.394
I'm not saying everybody in America has seen this, but everyone in America has seen a version of this.

57:27.651 --> 57:34.192
and is seeing versions of this all over their internet because that's how social media works.

57:34.672 --> 57:37.833
And very specifically is being used against the American public.

57:37.853 --> 57:42.414
So if you're outside of America, please understand that, that we're in trouble.

57:43.974 --> 57:44.754
We need help.

57:45.895 --> 57:48.195
We need to be told that we have been fooled.

57:48.215 --> 57:53.096
We need to be shown that we have been fooled because nobody seems to care.

57:55.598 --> 57:58.659
I feel like I'm a cricket inside of a gymnasium.

58:02.301 --> 58:12.304
You brought up, you brought up slavery and you brought up the question of whether, hold on, you brought up the question of whether or not slavery in the United States.

58:12.324 --> 58:15.666
And so now with this, now keep this in context, right?

58:15.706 --> 58:18.047
Because we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:18.087 --> 58:24.089
going on no name, invisible podcasts, wasting his time and salary doing nothing.

58:25.458 --> 58:26.558
changing nothing.

58:27.579 --> 58:33.521
Doing nothing that anybody that had any knowledge in the health freedom movement thought he was going to do.

58:33.982 --> 58:36.023
And so we must awaken.

58:36.503 --> 58:37.843
This was a con.

58:39.324 --> 58:46.867
And it was a con because none of these people have ever progressed in learning and in understanding and in being able to win.

58:48.108 --> 58:52.990
The anti-vax movement was fake and there's a real reason to be anti-vax.

58:54.599 --> 58:56.400
There's a real reason to be skeptical.

58:56.440 --> 58:59.381
And that's the reason why there was a fake anti-vax movement.

58:59.701 --> 59:02.203
That's why there was a fake health freedom movement.

59:02.563 --> 59:06.785
And that's why these people are now going to be scripted to face plant.

59:23.103 --> 59:32.830
Hello and welcome to The Director's Desk, the podcast where we spotlight the groundbreaking work of the National Institutes of Health and the extraordinary individuals advancing innovation in biomedical research and public health.

59:33.270 --> 59:35.411
Okay, just let me rant for a second here.

59:35.892 --> 59:48.160
Holy sh... What you see and hear in this podcast, please pay a little bit of attention to it.

59:48.180 --> 59:50.542
And I don't mean my podcast, I mean this podcast.

59:51.394 --> 59:53.935
because there are microphones and stands.

59:54.895 --> 59:58.036
And in the reflection, you can see a guy behind the cameras.

59:59.636 --> 01:00:03.777
And for some reason they have fricking reverb or some kind of echo.

01:00:05.798 --> 01:00:14.500
So they're spending taxpayer money to hire people to make a podcast with Jayantabadacharya.

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:25.015
They hired people to produce a podcast for the FDA director and his little sidekick, Vinayak.

01:00:26.796 --> 01:00:29.917
This is not governance by professionals.

01:00:30.337 --> 01:00:34.458
This is not governance by skilled people with a vision.

01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:36.959
This is governance by podcast.

01:00:36.999 --> 01:00:39.220
This is governance by scripted frauds.

01:00:41.786 --> 01:00:45.688
And we need to get angry about this because the other side can see it.

01:00:48.929 --> 01:01:04.535
And we are gonna get it hung around our neck, just like they're gonna hang Israel and Gaza and those war crimes around the right in America and around the Republicans in America and around Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:05.536
and all these people.

01:01:06.502 --> 01:01:07.082
It's coming.

01:01:07.482 --> 01:01:09.463
They're gonna hang it on America.

01:01:09.863 --> 01:01:20.448
And America, the system, and America, the idea, is essentially going to be attempted to drown in the deepest ocean they can find by tying that around our neck like a millstone.

01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:24.750
I believe that with all of my heart.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:32.393
And so if you wanna get out of this trap, the first thing you're gonna have to do is admit that these fools, somehow or another fooled us.

01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:41.986
I have a little bit of an excuse because this guy met me at three different barbecues during COVID and had tacos with me and stuff.

01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:43.707
Told me I was great, took selfies.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:47.810
So I got fooled because they came to my freaking house over and over again.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.231
What's your excuse?

01:01:51.687 --> 01:02:02.438
I'm Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Director of the NIH, and today I'm honored to be joined by Dr. Jeffrey Tabenberger, Acting Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, also known as NIAID.

01:02:02.878 --> 01:02:04.320
Jeff, thank you for coming on the podcast.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.121
Really glad to have you.

01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:06.002
Jeffrey Tabenberger Thanks so much.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:06.362
It's an honor.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:10.615
Okay, so we should just start with the elephant in the room.

01:02:11.035 --> 01:02:16.439
You are sitting as the acting director of NIAID, a position that was once held.

01:02:16.479 --> 01:02:24.746
You could do some homework and you could go to the, you know, websites where they show you grants and you could look up this guy's name and you could find out what he does.

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:30.090
But he's about to tell us that, you know, he just does gain of function stuff and in all kinds of things.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:31.851
And he explains it very badly.

01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:35.671
and I don't know how long I'm gonna make it, but I'm gonna watch this for a little while.

01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:37.672
By Tony Fauci.

01:02:38.473 --> 01:02:40.073
Yes, for about 40 years.

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:49.459
So you were there as a researcher for 20 years, not focused on coronaviruses, but on flu viruses, right?

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.200
Right.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.442
I mean, my lab's main interest for about 30 years has been influenza.

01:02:54.162 --> 01:02:54.863
And, uh, sorry.

01:02:55.263 --> 01:03:01.147
And, uh, you know, but during COVID, uh, you know, like, like most other people, we, we, yeah.

01:03:01.287 --> 01:03:11.333
And we, we became kind of a full-time coronavirus lab for a while, but it could actually be because the sound guy just has two rather cheap microphones and they're both on and they're both not very good.

01:03:11.453 --> 01:03:13.674
So they pick up the other guy all the time.

01:03:13.714 --> 01:03:15.395
And that might be where the reverb comes from.

01:03:16.215 --> 01:03:17.697
Well, we still have coronavirus interests.

01:03:17.737 --> 01:03:19.679
We're still mainly flu lab and we've done other things.

01:03:19.779 --> 01:03:23.584
I'm not sure if this is the suit number one or suit number two.

01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:26.327
I guess he only had two suits when he moved to D.C.

01:03:26.948 --> 01:03:30.032
We've done some Ebola work and mostly high containment virology.

01:03:30.052 --> 01:03:33.036
It looks like Taubenberger only has a couple suits too.

01:03:36.306 --> 01:03:36.766
Right.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.268
And what was that like, let's say up until the pandemic?

01:03:40.288 --> 01:03:42.009
Yeah, well, that was really fantastic.

01:03:42.129 --> 01:03:51.693
I mean, I was recruited to set up a new lab division in the intramural program to focus on pandemic flu and influenza

01:03:52.594 --> 01:04:00.441
pathogenesis using state-of-the-art high containment facilities here in a new building on the NIH campus, and it was just really fantastic.

01:04:00.762 --> 01:04:11.412
I was first in the Cancer Institute for about six years, and then I was at Walter Reed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for 13 years, and then I have been here now for 20 years.

01:04:12.273 --> 01:04:25.558
It's just been interesting because Walter Reed Pathology would have sent its cancer data via a high-speed internet connection to one Wimber Institute set up by Robert Malone, but that's okay.

01:04:25.598 --> 01:04:26.539
Great career.

01:04:26.619 --> 01:04:29.960
I believe strongly in public service and wanted to give back.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:39.163
And this was an opportunity to do really unique things using high containment virology that had great labs and great support and great facilities.

01:04:39.183 --> 01:04:40.804
So this has been a fabulous place.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:46.012
So you were free to, like, you had this interesting project on the 1918 flu.

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:55.661
You're working now on a universal flu vaccine with a technology that's, in some sense, old, but also, in some sense, quite innovative.

01:04:57.403 --> 01:04:57.543
Yeah.

01:04:57.603 --> 01:05:03.168
So, you know, our work on influenza, I didn't start out thinking that we were going to make a vaccine.

01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:09.772
Does it sound like Jayanta Bhattacharya is gonna break the pandemic narrative?

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:13.173
Does it sound like Jayanta Bhattacharya is like bucking the system?

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:23.595
Does it sound like Jayanta Bhattacharya is gonna ask any piercing, intelligent questions of this longtime insider and acolyte of Tony Fauci?

01:05:23.915 --> 01:05:27.356
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:28.276
I don't think so.

01:05:29.436 --> 01:05:30.916
I don't think he's going to at all.

01:05:31.016 --> 01:05:31.417
Why?

01:05:31.497 --> 01:05:33.457
Because he's a scripted actor!

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:39.414
Jayantabadacharya couldn't ask any intelligent questions on my show.

01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:42.916
How's he going to ask any intelligent questions to this guy?

01:05:43.217 --> 01:05:46.679
He was deferring to me as the biologist when I interviewed him.

01:05:46.739 --> 01:05:51.082
So how's he going to ask any smart questions about this flu virologist?

01:05:51.602 --> 01:05:52.063
Wow.

01:05:52.563 --> 01:05:54.125
Working on influenza was kind of an accident.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:56.988
It was a fluke.

01:05:57.508 --> 01:06:00.992
I picked it up as a hobby project when I was at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.

01:06:01.092 --> 01:06:07.179
At that point, I was leading a department of what was called molecular genetic pathology, starting in the 90s when... See?

01:06:07.279 --> 01:06:08.480
It's almost for sure!

01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:32.049
that he was doing genetic stuff on cancer and then sending that data to the frickin winbur institute come on guys this is crazy basically that area of clinical pathology was being invented in which we could instead of just looking at something under the microscope to make a diagnosis of cancer or an infectious disease you know you could actually do genetic tests at pcr southern blot and other things and so

01:06:32.649 --> 01:06:41.895
So, we applied that to the kind of way that tissues are always processed standardly, still now, where you have formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, where the sections are cut for a pathologist to look at them under the microscope.

01:06:42.615 --> 01:06:43.435
Okay, well, hold on.

01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:46.197
This is a family-friendly podcast.

01:06:46.237 --> 01:06:46.957
Let's break that down.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.439
What a terrible joke.

01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:51.100
This is a family-friendly podcast.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.821
Can you break that down a little bit boy?

01:06:52.901 --> 01:07:07.511
I tell you that's the NIH director They hired him for his funniness and that's not actually so silly right because the last guy played music on a freaking guitar at lots and lots of college graduations and stuff so like

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:11.511
It's actually pretty good what he's doing here.

01:07:11.572 --> 01:07:15.073
Maybe he's a much better NIH director than I thought.

01:07:15.133 --> 01:07:16.234
I'm sorry, Jayanta.

01:07:16.794 --> 01:07:18.035
Paraffin embedded.

01:07:18.215 --> 01:07:18.635
Embedded.

01:07:18.755 --> 01:07:20.236
Paraffin is like candle wax.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:20.756
Okay.

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:26.039
So what happens in pathology- This guy's name- If you want to look at it- This guy's name is Taubenberger.

01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:30.581
It's over there on the far side, but you can't see the T because I put it up there badly.

01:07:30.601 --> 01:07:32.002
A piece of tissue under the microscope.

01:07:32.907 --> 01:07:38.231
You have to slice it very thinly, about the thickness of a red blood cell, so very, very thin.

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:47.238
And you have to get it on a glass slide, and you have to stain it with dyes to pick up different colors, so that then you can look at it under the microscope.

01:07:47.698 --> 01:07:55.784
So this process has been invented, you know, since the mid-19th century, and it's been basically was completely refined by the late 19th century.

01:07:56.825 --> 01:07:59.206
And they use something that they call fixatives.

01:07:59.226 --> 01:08:01.868
They started with alcohols, and now they use aldehydes.

01:08:02.168 --> 01:08:03.369
Be careful there, Misha.

01:08:03.389 --> 01:08:06.431
You're going to start sounding like Stu Peters if you're not careful.

01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:07.832
Aldehyde or other things.

01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:09.694
And it just preserves the tissue.

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:10.895
It kind of stiffens it.

01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:16.519
And so you take a little piece of tissue, and you actually embed it in molten wax.

01:08:16.919 --> 01:08:18.980
And then you put it on a little kind of bologna slicer.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:23.844
And you can slice these little sections, and you put those on glass slides, and you stain them with what you want.

01:08:24.364 --> 01:08:26.226
And so you can see what happens.

01:08:26.266 --> 01:08:30.911
I've done that with brains of mice and rats and monkeys.

01:08:30.991 --> 01:08:32.793
I helped somebody with it, but I didn't actually do it.

01:08:34.134 --> 01:08:36.797
And you can't make a whole prep of a whole monkey brain.

01:08:36.817 --> 01:08:37.618
You do it with a cube.

01:08:38.527 --> 01:08:40.088
But with a whole mouse brain, you can do that.

01:08:40.288 --> 01:08:45.951
So I've done that microtome work, nice cryotome, that kind of thing.

01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:48.833
There's like an infection, for instance, how the cells respond to infection.

01:08:48.853 --> 01:08:49.353
Exactly.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:57.097
So, you know, there are times where, you know, you can make a diagnosis, say, of a certain kind of tumor, a sarcoma or a lymphoma.

01:08:59.318 --> 01:09:04.222
you might not be able to understand all the molecular details as we get more toward personalized medicine.

01:09:04.262 --> 01:09:12.388
So we can find that there are very specific oncogene mutations or very specific translocations that actually would dictate the kind of therapy that you would want to get.

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:16.531
So it was really useful and very cool, you know, cutting edge stuff.

01:09:16.632 --> 01:09:18.953
And I guess it still is cutting edge as advanced.

01:09:19.013 --> 01:09:21.695
So, you know, I became a molecular genetic pathologist.

01:09:22.236 --> 01:09:25.338
But so in the mid 90s... Molecular genetic pathologist.

01:09:25.378 --> 01:09:26.839
He sounds almost like,

01:09:27.714 --> 01:09:29.215
Jessica Rose, but real.

01:09:32.258 --> 01:09:36.841
We were sitting at an institution that was started by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.

01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:40.744
It had the largest collection of pathology in the world, samples going back to the Civil War.

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:48.010
And I was trying to think, we have these new fantastic tools that allow us to look at things in a new way that have never been done before.

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:51.451
What could we do to show how cool this technology is?

01:09:51.491 --> 01:10:07.419
And so the idea they had, the crazy idea, was that we could find tissues of people who died of the Spanish flu in 1918 that had been preserved for, at that point, 85 years or so, and see if we could use these new molecular techniques to fish out tiny fragments of the virus's genetic material.

01:10:07.439 --> 01:10:07.939
Hey, it works.

01:10:08.779 --> 01:10:14.920
But they're formalin-fixed, and there's paraffin things, so basically the viruses are dead.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.560
Oh, the viruses are completely dead.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.081
They're blown up into a million pieces.

01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:23.802
So there was not any risk of any lab leak or anything like that?

01:10:23.902 --> 01:10:25.162
Oh, no.

01:10:25.602 --> 01:10:32.903
There was no infectious material at all, and the virus is blown up into teeny tiny, the RNA, into teeny tiny fragments.

01:10:33.143 --> 01:10:37.164
But it is really cool to be able to see what was the biological

01:10:37.964 --> 01:10:40.347
entity that caused such devastation in 1918?

01:10:40.607 --> 01:10:41.047
Yeah.

01:10:41.228 --> 01:10:47.735
So the reason we picked that is that I remember just one line in med school, you know, the Spanish flu was really bad, but that's about it.

01:10:47.835 --> 01:10:49.056
And I didn't know that much about it.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:54.142
But as I started reading about it, you become really hooked because it was really devastating.

01:10:55.423 --> 01:11:06.592
The scholarship on how many people died around the world keeps going up because the prior accounts starting from the 1920s usually just included the first world and didn't really include the developing world.

01:11:06.652 --> 01:11:13.517
And now as we add more, I think a reasonable number of people who died in less than a year's time is about 50 million, maybe 100 million.

01:11:14.498 --> 01:11:17.219
out of a population of about 1.8 billion people on the planet.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.742
So there are some... Mark Kulak has a lot to say about, you know, flu numbers.

01:11:22.802 --> 01:11:25.463
He's looked into it a little more than this guy apparently has.

01:11:26.344 --> 01:11:28.385
And this is pretty extraordinary.

01:11:28.505 --> 01:11:28.745
Wow.

01:11:28.765 --> 01:11:32.867
Estimates that as many as 17 million people died on the Indian subcontinent.

01:11:34.047 --> 01:11:35.127
Really horrible.

01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:37.548
More than 40% of U.S.

01:11:37.568 --> 01:11:43.370
soldiers that died in World War I of all causes, more than 40% died of Spanish flu.

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:48.011
These are healthy 18 to 25 year old men, most of them in training camps here still in the U.S.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.091
We were just really gearing up to go to the Western Front.

01:11:51.152 --> 01:11:52.932
And so it was devastating.

01:11:54.372 --> 01:11:56.193
The funny thing was that, or the sad thing,

01:11:56.753 --> 01:11:59.294
So they didn't inject anybody in those training camps?

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:03.355
There was no, like, intramuscular injection of stuff in those training camps?

01:12:03.415 --> 01:12:04.476
It was just training camps?

01:12:04.676 --> 01:12:12.779
That because of the advances of microbiology by 1918, with the germ theory, the advances in even some vaccinations... I just wanted to test it.

01:12:12.799 --> 01:12:13.039
This is hot.

01:12:13.059 --> 01:12:16.240
This would be the first war where infectious diseases would not be the major killer.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.021
And then nature proved us wrong again.

01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:25.323
Now, fast forward today, actually, you're working on a universal flu vaccine.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:26.125
Right.

01:12:26.445 --> 01:12:30.168
So this comes from my strong interest in the Spanish flu.

01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:33.451
You know, where did the virus come from and why did it, why was it so bad?

01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:43.438
And that led ultimately to sequencing the whole genome using methods then that took us a decade in the lab that I can now replicate in my lab now in about a week and a half.

01:12:44.139 --> 01:12:46.681
So 10 years of effort into a week and a half, thanks to technology.

01:12:47.141 --> 01:12:50.183
But then we rebuilt the virus to actually make an infectious clone.

01:12:50.223 --> 01:12:52.605
And that's where you get into the infectious part where we have to do that.

01:12:52.745 --> 01:12:56.667
He said infectious clone very, very, very badly there.

01:12:56.727 --> 01:13:00.449
That's actually incredibly interesting to me.

01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:03.390
I don't know why he wouldn't pronounce that well.

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.191
As a select agent.

01:13:04.691 --> 01:13:06.091
Wow, that was interesting.

01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:06.792
Select agent means what?

01:13:07.192 --> 01:13:08.933
It's a pathogen.

01:13:09.413 --> 01:13:12.475
But then we rebuilt the virus to actually make an infectious clone.

01:13:12.515 --> 01:13:14.115
And that's where you get into the infectious part.

01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:14.756
Did you hear it?

01:13:14.776 --> 01:13:16.576
He didn't even say infectious clone.

01:13:16.596 --> 01:13:17.337
He said infectious clone.

01:13:18.737 --> 01:13:21.498
And then what does Jayanta the scripted actor ask?

01:13:21.558 --> 01:13:23.498
Does he say, what's an infectious clone?

01:13:23.898 --> 01:13:27.679
He wouldn't want to say that because he heard about that on my stream.

01:13:28.459 --> 01:13:31.980
He heard about that at the fricking barbecues, didn't you Jayanta?

01:13:36.021 --> 01:13:37.661
Thanks for those invitations, Greg.

01:13:37.701 --> 01:13:47.863
It was really nice to meet everybody and meet Jayanta those times and try to explain this stuff to him, including infectious clones that Talbenberger just mentioned kind of

01:13:48.817 --> 01:13:49.518
But not really.

01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:12.278
then that took us a decade in the lab that I can now replicate in my lab now in about a week and a half.

01:14:12.978 --> 01:14:15.520
So 10 years of effort into a week and a half thanks to technology.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:24.147
But then we rebuilt the virus to actually make an infectious clone and that's where you get into the infectious part where we have to do that as a select agent with a lot of oversight.

01:14:24.187 --> 01:14:25.248
Select agent means what?

01:14:25.948 --> 01:14:30.192
It's a pathogen identified either as a very significant

01:14:32.296 --> 01:14:34.679
A select agent means what?

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.563
But he doesn't know what an infectious clone means.

01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:46.654
He doesn't know that that could be an industrial size quantity of a relatively pure DNA molecule that would otherwise never be able to exist.

01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:55.528
risk pathogen for humans or for animals or plants.

01:14:55.608 --> 01:15:04.272
And so the USDA has a list of agents for animals and plants, and the CDC has a list of agents for humans, and then there's some overlap agents.

01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:06.332
Ebola, for instance.

01:15:06.392 --> 01:15:08.993
Ebola, yes, exactly.

01:15:09.694 --> 01:15:12.595
Typically a bird flu in the past, the 1918 flu once it's reconstructed.

01:15:13.215 --> 01:15:18.778
Um, you know, and they can only be worked with under very great scrutiny and with a lot of permissions and oversight.

01:15:18.938 --> 01:15:21.559
I visited one of the labs that NIH runs.

01:15:21.839 --> 01:15:26.801
Uh, it's called a BSL four lab in the Rocky mountain, uh, the Rocky mountain lab in Montana.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:36.186
And, uh, they, when you wait, look, there's a foreigner at the head of that lab, just like there's a foreigner at the head of us Amer and just like there's a foreigner at the head of DITRA.

01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:37.566
That's right.

01:15:38.827 --> 01:15:40.668
Nobody talks about that, but Mark Kulak,

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:44.042
work in one of these labs, you're working in a spacesuit, basically.

01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:44.463
Right.

01:15:44.943 --> 01:15:45.103
Right.

01:15:45.163 --> 01:15:48.587
So, you know, there are different levels of biocontainment that the U.S.

01:15:48.607 --> 01:15:49.908
government helps design.

01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:52.271
This is not helping America.

01:15:52.831 --> 01:15:58.798
This is not getting justice for any of the Americans that were killed by opioids over the last five years.

01:15:59.298 --> 01:16:02.822
It's not getting justice for any of the Americans that were killed in our hospitals.

01:16:03.203 --> 01:16:07.388
It's not getting justice for the Americans that never got born.

01:16:07.768 --> 01:16:12.094
It's not getting justice for the grandparents that died alone.

01:16:12.154 --> 01:16:18.161
It's not getting justice for the grandparents that died alone from their own spouses.

01:16:19.002 --> 01:16:28.108
There's no care in the world about that at all for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for Donald Trump, for Marty McCary, or for this scripted fraud.

01:16:28.568 --> 01:16:44.939
And that's how you know that America is in trouble, because a half a million people were killed by opioids, and about 500,000 Americans were murdered in hospitals by supplementary oxygen, lack of antibiotics, remdesivir, midazolam, and overventilation.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.762
So wake up and apologize to those dead people first.

01:16:49.403 --> 01:16:56.131
Then maybe we can get on to talking about how some more people had some other things from getting transfected.

01:16:57.092 --> 01:17:03.039
Because none of those people would have taken the transfection in the first place if it wasn't for the two years of murder and lies.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.545
That these people still will just say, yeah, it's COVID.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:10.571
This was the highest, right?

01:17:10.591 --> 01:17:11.412
This is the highest level.

01:17:11.492 --> 01:17:18.038
And so for influenza, because there are antivirals, because there are vaccines, it doesn't meet the BSL-4 level.

01:17:18.078 --> 01:17:20.401
So it's what we call BSL-3 enhanced.

01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:32.032
So we don't have to wear the spacesuit, but we wear a full sort of disposable outer Tyvek suit with kind of like a bicycle helmet with a shield, which has a positive.

01:17:32.112 --> 01:17:32.773
Okay, I'm stopping.

01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:36.697
I'm just gonna show you something and then I'm gonna take the evening Off I'm sorry that I got on so late today.

01:17:36.757 --> 01:17:39.240
It's really it was really a failure on my part I had everything ready to go

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:55.152
before basketball and then I didn't.

01:17:55.852 --> 01:18:01.135
So I'm getting closer to the 420 all the time or at some point I don't know.

01:18:01.896 --> 01:18:16.084
I just wanted to show you this because I thought it was interesting and I think Mark will find it interesting as well although I hope everybody here will find it interesting because again I can't help but feel like we are in one hell of a hamster wheel and

01:18:16.744 --> 01:18:27.331
And once you see it as a hamster wheel, then when you look at history, you start to find things and see things as, wait a minute, we've already done this?

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:34.055
And so today I have an example of something that appears to be an indication that we've already done this.

01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:48.372
And it is quite pertinent to the little rant that I just went on about what these scripted jackasses aren't saying and will not say, just like Marty McCary and Vinay Prasad won't say, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:48.412 --> 01:18:50.894
and his whole staff of HHS will never say.

01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:56.077
His very prestigious ARPA-H CDC director will never say.

01:18:56.537 --> 01:19:00.100
That is that murder and lies occurred in America, and that was the pandemic.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.842
Murder and lies in Scotland was the pandemic.

01:19:02.902 --> 01:19:04.923
Murder and lies in the UK was the pandemic.

01:19:07.684 --> 01:19:11.446
There wasn't as much murder in Africa and that's why there was no pandemic there.

01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:19.630
There wasn't as much murder in Australia or in New Zealand or in Japan.

01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:22.371
There was murder in America.

01:19:24.712 --> 01:19:25.973
So let's just go over here.

01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:27.854
This is me.

01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:33.983
And I have a Green Arrow from 1971.

01:19:35.585 --> 01:19:41.850
And on the cover, it says an important message from the Honorable John V. Lindsay, Mayor of New York.

01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:45.253
But the cover is Green Arrow and Green Lantern.

01:19:45.533 --> 01:19:51.177
And they are devastated because it's more deadly than the atomic bomb.

01:19:51.217 --> 01:19:55.241
And it's got a hypodermic needle on the front, which is really interesting.

01:19:55.301 --> 01:19:57.903
Now, don't be disappointed.

01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:17.004
I am not going to read this comic right now because it would take a long time and I haven't even read it all yet, but I do know that it's about injected narcotics and about how overdoses can occur if you use the wrong drug.

01:20:17.084 --> 01:20:17.825
So here it is.

01:20:18.425 --> 01:20:22.628
You're a lousy junkie no better than the rest of those sniveling punks, you see?

01:20:23.088 --> 01:20:24.289
So this whole

01:20:25.109 --> 01:20:45.875
book 1971 is about injectable narcotics that people are overdosing on now i'm not sure if that's morphine or if that's heroin or what that is they're not very clear about it yet um but it's very very um i just got it in the mail so that's why i haven't read it yet relax there misha i will read

01:20:47.481 --> 01:20:56.686
The letter from the message from the mayor of New York, an important message for you, June 21st, 1971.

01:20:57.766 --> 01:21:03.309
Mr. Mark Iglesias of the NPP Communications Group, Incorporated, 909 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, 10022.

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:15.175
Dear Iggy, please forgive me for the delayed response to your letter, but many people involved in our efforts to combat drug addiction made circulation of your promotional material a slow process.

01:21:16.969 --> 01:21:23.699
As I remarked in my previous letter, your undertaking to impart the horrors of narcotics to our youngsters deserves applause.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:29.587
So he's complimenting the guy who made this comic, right?

01:21:30.416 --> 01:21:36.718
With this excellent opportunity to reach countless numbers of young people through the comic book media, I would like to convey the following message.

01:21:36.778 --> 01:21:41.579
The war against drug addiction has become the most important one within our country.

01:21:41.619 --> 01:21:45.380
Drugs have risen to the number one spot as the killer of our youngsters in New York City.

01:21:45.941 --> 01:21:50.182
We have made this combat our top priority, one that will continue and expand.

01:21:50.842 --> 01:21:56.787
horrors of withdrawal, the violence, and the degradation of buying drugs go hand-in-hand with addiction.

01:21:57.228 --> 01:22:03.493
We must use every means to alert young people to those horrors, and they must do their part to protect themselves and their friends.

01:22:03.513 --> 01:22:05.295
We must all hang together in this fight.

01:22:05.735 --> 01:22:07.617
Again, Iggy, I commend you for your project.

01:22:07.657 --> 01:22:09.899
Please keep me informed of its progress.

01:22:12.201 --> 01:22:13.042
Is it possible

01:22:14.358 --> 01:22:20.441
that we've had a health problem of this nature for decades and no one's ever really done anything about it.

01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:31.566
Is it possible that this health problem was actually exacerbated as part of the population pyramid managing project known as COVID-19?

01:22:32.586 --> 01:22:33.427
Is it possible?

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:36.808
I think it's very possible, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:42.551
I think it's almost impossible that this comic book could exist unless that was true.

01:22:45.697 --> 01:22:51.660
And it's probably a very good explanation for why this podcast exists.

01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:54.202
This awful joke.

01:22:55.642 --> 01:22:57.003
This awful joke.

01:23:04.207 --> 01:23:07.649
Ladies and gentlemen, this endemicity is a myth.

01:23:10.822 --> 01:23:16.565
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR was never specific for any particular part of the background.

01:23:17.945 --> 01:23:19.266
And placebos made it safe.

01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:24.368
Don't use their tests to find their ghosts like Mary Talley Bowden wants you to do.

01:23:24.388 --> 01:23:30.411
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen, for the children of Earth, the grandchildren of Earth.

01:23:30.732 --> 01:23:33.573
They want the grandchildren to wake up without their sovereignty.

01:23:34.333 --> 01:23:38.855
And we need to make it our life's work to make sure that they have it.

01:23:40.902 --> 01:23:42.023
Thank you very much for being here.

01:23:42.103 --> 01:23:42.703
Sorry I'm late.

01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:44.144
I will be here tomorrow again.

01:23:44.164 --> 01:23:47.566
I will do five days a week until in the foreseeable future.

01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:51.268
Tomorrow's the first day of school for my king sophomore.

01:23:51.288 --> 01:23:54.650
He's stressing a lot and I feel bad about that.

01:23:54.690 --> 01:24:02.835
So I'm gonna take off a little early today and see if I can help him out by giving him some shit and teasing him and stuff like that about going back to school.

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:03.715
So I'll see you later guys.

01:24:03.735 --> 01:24:04.396
Thanks for being here.

01:24:04.796 --> 01:24:05.496
Love you very much.

01:24:05.997 --> 01:24:06.897
Don't buy the red.

01:24:07.537 --> 01:24:08.578
Don't buy the blue hat.

01:24:08.698 --> 01:24:09.679
Don't buy the red hat.

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:11.680
Don't buy the blue hat.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.900
Don't buy the red hat, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.402
I don't have a hat to sell you, but you should buy this hat.

01:24:19.182 --> 01:24:22.163
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:24:22.304 --> 01:24:24.404
Transfection when healthy humans was a crime.

01:24:24.424 --> 01:24:30.927
RNA cannot pandemic and autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:24:54.517 --> 01:24:58.784
Make sure you download the app and follow me on PeerTube.

01:24:59.245 --> 01:25:00.808
Stream.gigome.bio.

01:25:00.848 --> 01:25:01.910
Thanks very much for being here.
