03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm not sure exactly who he is. His name is J. J. Cooley, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

04:23.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm not a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar.

04:53.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, have I got a good one for you today? Uhm, it is, it is throw back Thursday. I didn't actually title it throw back Thursday. But that's what I'm gonna try to do, uh thursday is because I think part of the way that we get-

05:22.000 --> 05:30.880
and to smell the enchantment is to look at what happened in 2020 in retrospect.

05:30.880 --> 05:36.720
Look back with a clearer mind and see what we find.

05:36.720 --> 05:43.800
And I think PBS News is one of those places that really puts out the propaganda.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.960
And so when you see the propaganda from a little bit farther back,

05:47.960 --> 05:53.120
I think you're going to find that your consciousness has been their prime real estate

05:53.120 --> 05:54.920
for a very, very long time.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.920
And in fact, they made sure to own it at the start of the pandemic,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.600
which is pretty incredible.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.320
Do they really own it?

06:05.320 --> 06:06.760
Mike Vandenberg, next date.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.000
And that's where we are.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.920
We are attributing bad motives to the people who disagree with this narrative.

06:15.920 --> 06:21.520
And it doesn't matter on what side you are, they're going to attribute bad motives.

06:21.520 --> 06:26.440
I get bad motives attributed to me in the comment sections of substacks

06:26.440 --> 06:30.440
that just mentioned that JJ has some ideas.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.320
I get called a liar and that I'm spreading lies.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.080
And all I'm really saying is that we're being acted upon.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.480
Fifth generation warfare is lying.

06:42.560 --> 06:49.280
And so instead of addressing the top three biological points of this stream,

06:49.280 --> 06:57.560
they say I'm a liar and I'm spreading rumors about people's daughters or other nonsense like that.

06:57.560 --> 07:02.960
These charlatans and these fakers and these liars are going to be exposed,

07:02.960 --> 07:09.800
just like the scam of fractional reserve banking is going to be exposed,

07:09.800 --> 07:16.400
just like the scam of public health and viruses is going to be exposed.

07:20.320 --> 07:25.440
And there is really only one chance in history for them to collect this much data and they know it.

07:25.440 --> 07:32.240
So they've decided to lie about it in order to collect that data.

07:32.240 --> 07:40.280
And if we let this history be raised or forgotten or talked over,

07:40.280 --> 07:44.280
it will be lost to our children and will be lost to our college kids.

07:44.280 --> 07:48.920
We should be challenging some college kids to do a project on this,

07:48.920 --> 07:55.800
to archive this history as a PhD or as a master's study in public health.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.160
But we're not doing that, but we could.

08:00.160 --> 08:06.200
We're not doing that because we gave control over to these charlatans a long time ago.

08:10.120 --> 08:15.080
The city of the apes has existed for a lot longer than you might imagine.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.960
We grew up in the city of the apes and we didn't even know it.

08:18.960 --> 08:24.320
Our parents apparently didn't even know it because they taught us this mythology as well.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.760
That's what we're really trying to do, we're trying to break it.

08:27.760 --> 08:36.880
And we're trying to break a real illusion, multi-generational illusion.

08:36.880 --> 08:42.400
And while we break that illusion, we've got to be very careful to make sure that we make gentle the life of this world.

08:42.400 --> 08:48.720
That we don't allow the chaos that they want to create to occur.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.000
The waves of strife.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.640
We can avoid those if we love our neighbor, if we stay focused on the biology

08:56.640 --> 09:01.440
and we don't take the bait on TV and social media, I really do think it's possible.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.440
And essentially, we're doing this to our kids, right?

09:13.440 --> 09:17.600
We're teaching them to surf this wave of nonsense and lies.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.840
We're teaching them to navigate a world of mythology.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.000
And it's a dangerous world, it's a dangerous wave.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.680
It'll pound you into the coral.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.880
And yet our kids, if we let them do it, they can be the ones that change this.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.400
That's really my plan.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.080
My plan is not to do it myself.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.880
My plan is to leave the door open so that my boys and my girl can do it

09:42.880 --> 09:52.320
and their friends can do it before they have kids, before the world is permanently ruined for their generation.

09:56.480 --> 10:03.520
We're not going to give up on them, we're going to use them, we're going to teach them.

10:04.800 --> 10:09.040
And the best way to do the helping is to spread the word of this stream.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.240
So thank you very much for all the people that do and thank you very much for the people

10:12.240 --> 10:16.960
over the last couple of days that have subscribed, gone out of their way to click on those links

10:17.600 --> 10:22.560
at GigaHomeBiological.com or elsewhere and I could not be more grateful.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.440
This stream is really brought to you only by people like you and no one else.

10:28.240 --> 10:35.760
And so we are essentially, I am a little bit of a manifestation of all that courage,

10:35.760 --> 10:42.160
all those people's courage to give five bucks a month or 10 bucks a month or more.

10:42.160 --> 10:49.520
Some people even give more and it's with very humble gratitude that I am here every day at 10

10:50.000 --> 10:53.920
and we'll be here every day at 10-10 during the week and on the weekends I don't know what we're

10:53.920 --> 11:04.640
going to do. It's yeah, this is an illusion that's sustained only through your active participation

11:04.640 --> 11:10.080
and your active sustained belief in people who have been lying to us.

11:10.960 --> 11:17.440
And I am as guilty as you as falling for their trap, falling for their theater.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.840
When two people agree to lie to you, it's really, really very dangerous. They can convince

11:23.840 --> 11:29.120
you of one being good and the other one being bad. They can convince you of both of them being

11:29.120 --> 11:36.320
good, anything that they want to. With coordinated lying, it's something very magic happens and

11:36.320 --> 11:45.840
it's not good magic, it's bad magic. Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaHomeBiological.

11:47.440 --> 12:17.360
Good morning ladies and gentlemen. This is GigaHomeBiological, a high resistance low noise

12:17.360 --> 12:23.120
information brief brought to you by a biologist. It is May 2nd, 2024. My name is Jonathan Cooley.

12:23.120 --> 12:28.800
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and today is throwback

12:28.800 --> 12:35.760
Thursday. On Thursdays, I really like to do a show which reflects on either biology and the

12:35.760 --> 12:42.000
stories that were told about biology before the pandemic or right at the start of the pandemic.

12:42.000 --> 12:51.840
Today, out of my archived list of hilarity, I have pulled a real ringer. It is the frontline

12:51.840 --> 13:04.880
documentary from 2020, April 21st, 2020. It's a real doozy, but I always like to start my stream

13:04.880 --> 13:10.160
with the points that nobody will ever address with regard to GigaHomeBiological. They're happy

13:10.240 --> 13:16.640
to call me a liar or phooey or scooby-doo or whatever other things they want to do. They call

13:16.640 --> 13:24.880
me shaggy sometimes, whatever. I don't care because they by doing that, by taking cheap shots and by

13:26.000 --> 13:32.480
saying things that are just plain incorrect, they ignore these statements and that's really

13:32.480 --> 13:37.920
where you can see them. Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent

13:37.920 --> 13:43.520
of augmenting the immune system is dumb. And if any MD that's telling you not to listen to me

13:43.520 --> 13:49.440
won't at least say that at least he's got that right. At least he said that better than I've ever

13:49.440 --> 13:56.640
heard it said by anybody else. And instead, they call me phooey or a liar or a divider or

13:57.600 --> 14:04.560
they let you go from an organization that hired you as a staff scientist and never use this phrase

14:04.560 --> 14:10.560
once while they were paying you. Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and

14:10.560 --> 14:15.280
they never explain why. I'm the only one who will tell you the reason why it's criminally

14:15.280 --> 14:23.520
negligent is because everyone at a university with an advanced biology degree including postdocs,

14:23.520 --> 14:31.840
everyone at a university or a medical school with an advanced degree doing research on the bench

14:32.720 --> 14:38.800
most likely should have known the definition of transfection before the pandemic and therefore

14:39.360 --> 14:46.400
when transfection was presented as an investigational vaccine methodology, all of them should have known

14:48.160 --> 14:53.920
without having to rub the hair off of their face or scratch their head for too long that that was a lie

14:55.680 --> 15:00.720
and that there's no way that transfection in the context of the biology that they should have

15:00.720 --> 15:08.400
understood could be useful in augmenting the immune system of a healthy child or a healthy

15:08.400 --> 15:19.120
elderly person and the potential bouquet of downsides was almost unlistable and yet because of their

15:21.040 --> 15:27.440
criminal negligence I would say that all of these pseudo professional academic biologists are

15:27.520 --> 15:36.160
essentially guilty of manslaughter. They are essentially guilty in taking part in this

15:37.440 --> 15:48.480
incredible incredible crime and I put myself in that list for 2020 and 2021 because I was running

15:48.480 --> 15:54.080
around with my head cut off trying to convince people that we didn't need to worry even if it

15:54.080 --> 16:04.560
was a lab leak and I was sufficiently distracted from this argument and sufficiently distracted

16:04.560 --> 16:11.360
by the people that I thought were important to convince that I didn't make connections with

16:11.360 --> 16:15.680
other people that would have maybe brought me to the finish line earlier. I didn't make

16:15.680 --> 16:20.560
connections with people who were on to a different part of the lie than I was and could have

16:20.560 --> 16:27.040
connected dots for me that I wasn't connecting because I was being actively manipulated and

16:27.040 --> 16:32.880
actively influenced and actively lied to by people who were pretending to be rivals or

16:32.880 --> 16:40.480
pissed off at somebody or arguing with somebody and that theater unfortunately ladies and gentlemen

16:40.480 --> 16:45.920
for the people who still cling to these these various heroes a lot of those people

16:46.560 --> 16:52.160
are not good guys and they all were involved twisted around in my life

16:54.640 --> 17:00.560
were there when I was losing my job when I was losing my house when my family didn't have enough

17:03.760 --> 17:07.440
pretending that they were going through the same thing saying that they were having the same

17:07.440 --> 17:12.560
problems arguing with the same people in that signal chat or pretending to storm out of a

17:12.640 --> 17:15.680
meeting because they didn't agree with something or nobody would listen to them

17:16.560 --> 17:20.480
so that I would be sympathetic so that I would follow them so that I would think oh yeah I

17:20.480 --> 17:25.440
agree with that too and then that person would now be trustworthy according to me because they

17:25.440 --> 17:29.440
had taken a stance against someone else that I also disagreed with

17:31.840 --> 17:33.840
and that's the magic that's the trick

17:34.400 --> 17:42.400
and so if Pierre Corey and and I am just saying this hypothetically I'm not saying

17:42.400 --> 17:50.400
that this is what happened but if Pierre Corey and a couple other people at FC FLCCC have decided

17:50.400 --> 17:59.360
to kind of lie to the rest of the people in FLCCC about what they know happened in 2020 and kind

17:59.360 --> 18:04.320
of lie about what they know about the significance or insignificance of early treatment

18:05.040 --> 18:12.080
and just go along with the story that the national security state has obliged them to go along with

18:13.600 --> 18:19.040
then Dr. Merrick is not a bad guy then all the people that that go to those seminars aren't

18:19.040 --> 18:24.480
bad guys because on stage is an illusion of consensus that this is the best way forward

18:25.200 --> 18:30.640
thank you very much I just want to protect that book because it's very expensive

18:31.520 --> 18:36.000
and it's not like yeah anyway I paid way more than I should have for it sorry thank you

18:38.240 --> 18:43.200
so yes that's where we are and I really think it's extremely important to see it that way that

18:43.200 --> 18:49.680
we are still really filtering out all of the riffraff and the filter is catching a lot like I'm sorry

18:49.760 --> 18:55.520
and it's it's not that I wanted to catch a lot but it's catching a lot and the more we we see their

18:55.520 --> 19:01.200
behavior as we ignore them the more you see that the only thing they have left to do is call names

19:02.880 --> 19:09.600
make fun or create stories that that are irrelevant like is it wrong for me to say that

19:09.600 --> 19:16.240
Sashalata Pova's daughter was on Alex Jones multiple times in 2019 is it wrong for me to say that

19:17.120 --> 19:22.560
is that is it wrong for me to suggest that that might be a significant data point because I for

19:22.560 --> 19:29.120
one think Alex Jones is full of shit and has been for very very long time then at some point a

19:29.120 --> 19:38.720
long time ago Alex Jones was essentially co-opted by the same exact mythology machine that is

19:39.280 --> 19:48.880
responsible for where we are now and if you it's just sometimes hard for young people like college

19:48.880 --> 19:55.280
kids it's hard for young adults who are focused on raising young children it's hard for old people

19:55.280 --> 20:00.880
who've been tuned out for a long time to really understand that they have planned this out there

20:00.880 --> 20:07.840
are trillions and trillions if not another order of magnitude of of wealth at stake here

20:07.840 --> 20:14.880
multi-generational plan is being executed at a climax here a little mini climax a little mini

20:14.880 --> 20:25.280
reveal and it's not for nothing that this in retrospect looks like a slow role of a story

20:25.280 --> 20:31.680
and an admission we could have been here where we are right now complaining about a lab leak in

20:31.680 --> 20:37.600
2020 may or June we could have already been here the whole narrative could have progressed

20:39.520 --> 20:43.600
and we could have just said wow it's a lab leak wow it's a gain of function virus holy crap we

20:43.600 --> 20:50.560
should take the vaccine but it was executed a little bit more subtly than that a little bit

20:50.560 --> 20:56.240
more deceptively than that so that people like me who are riding our bikes around and making

20:56.240 --> 21:05.200
streams convinced there was a lab leak it was magic ladies and gentlemen what they did to us it was

21:05.200 --> 21:12.080
absolutely magic what they did and the whole concept that the light blue the light blue all

21:12.160 --> 21:20.960
caused mortality where between 70 000 and 50 000 people die every week in america as we move

21:20.960 --> 21:32.240
from 2014 to 2020 and yet somehow this manufactured blip was misconstrued as the spread of a novel

21:32.240 --> 21:41.520
virus with strange disease that doctors like maryll nass could make a a judgment call even

21:41.520 --> 21:48.080
without testing that this symptomology set is definitely a novel disease that they could make

21:48.080 --> 21:54.720
a call and say that three times during the pandemic maryll nass claims to have and had a novel sickness

21:56.240 --> 22:01.520
strange one with a strange set of symptoms that she won't bother to list but they're definitely

22:01.520 --> 22:07.440
were strange she didn't test for covid but she sure she had it and she's a doctor so you can't

22:07.440 --> 22:14.240
argue with her apparently one of her sons was a cardiologist in new york city and got there just

22:14.240 --> 22:22.720
in time to help out i i've been sent one of his papers um he's a cardiologist it does modeling

22:22.720 --> 22:27.760
papers with uh on clinical trials and stuff it sounds like he could have collaborated with

22:27.760 --> 22:33.040
sasha latipova at ro rojchester with regard to some of her technology and and algorithms

22:36.400 --> 22:41.760
it's calm it's actually comical to me at this stage that we're even considering the possibility that

22:41.760 --> 22:50.240
that that this isn't a two or three-sided theater affair where we've been lied to by all these people

22:51.920 --> 22:57.360
but that's really where we are we are absolutely positively there and it is a national security

22:57.360 --> 23:02.560
operation that's why you can know we have been lied to by a lot of people that's why you can

23:02.560 --> 23:12.000
imagine if there are 17 spoken word and you know like outspoken public facing intelligence agencies

23:14.080 --> 23:20.880
right 17 that the director of national intelligence supposedly oversees some or all of them

23:22.320 --> 23:27.280
we have a state department that nobody ever talks about that's connected to ditra that nobody

23:27.280 --> 23:35.440
ever talks about nobody ever talks about getting rid of the prep act or or or strict liability for

23:35.440 --> 23:40.640
all pharmaceutical products they talk about opposing the who that we can't vote about we can't vote

23:40.640 --> 23:51.120
on but we could just leave and so what i see here is a global operation to make us

23:51.600 --> 23:53.120
just

23:53.120 --> 23:57.840
discapableized is that what the right what is that the word that dr. G or don't use yesterday

23:57.840 --> 24:05.040
discapableized or or or yeah i think discapableized they wanted to discapableize us from exercising

24:05.040 --> 24:11.040
informed consent if you don't know reality if you don't know anything about anything then you can't

24:11.040 --> 24:17.280
exercise informed consent you're living in a storybook and i believe that we are living in a storybook

24:17.280 --> 24:23.520
right now a storybook that includes everything from propped up imaginary politician types

24:23.520 --> 24:27.680
to propped up imaginary musician types to propped up imaginary

24:29.760 --> 24:39.440
doctor types propped up imaginary successful podcast types all of the successful podcasts

24:39.440 --> 24:43.120
that are about anything relevant are basically controlled or co-opted

24:43.520 --> 24:51.120
there is no way to organically rise to a million subscribers on the internet anymore unless you're

24:51.120 --> 25:00.880
doing something like motorcycle videos or or videos about doll collecting but if you're doing

25:00.880 --> 25:08.720
videos about reality or videos about questioning the reality on on social media or on television

25:08.720 --> 25:16.000
you will never rise to any kind of prominence and and self-sustainability with it with unless

25:16.000 --> 25:21.760
they you do it despite them unless really it's a you know email chain grassroots kind of thing

25:21.760 --> 25:29.040
which is really what giga-ohm biological is we're just one subscriber at a time one one thank you

25:29.040 --> 25:36.400
email at a time trying to get enough subscribers donating every month so that i can we can do this

25:36.400 --> 25:41.760
with some level of stability and comfort for our family that's all i'm trying to do here

25:42.880 --> 25:49.520
and that might seem a little bit uh arrogant if you're here for the first time but we've had this

25:49.520 --> 25:58.800
hypothesis since around december of 2020 more or less nailed and we helped i helped and i will

25:58.800 --> 26:06.880
say we because it's me and my wife and my kids that all have have endured the stress frustration

26:06.880 --> 26:15.360
and and isolation and pain of having giga-ohm biological in our family of having this truth

26:16.080 --> 26:25.680
and and and wanting to get it out as a it's our our patriotic and and and sacred uh mission i

26:25.760 --> 26:29.760
don't think i'm gonna be doing anything else for the rest of my life except for teaching biology

26:29.760 --> 26:37.520
online and coaching basketball offline and this teaching biology online has a lot to do with the

26:37.520 --> 26:44.800
fact that i've come to understand that most adults in the world are completely misled in terms of

26:44.800 --> 26:51.520
what they think the truth of of biological reality is and they're misled because they have been

26:51.600 --> 27:00.720
bamboozled into believing that the world is full of pathogenic obligate parasites that take the

27:00.720 --> 27:11.680
form of molecules that's a pretty spectacular place to live pretty spectacular world in which

27:11.680 --> 27:17.680
to live where you're supposed to be concerned about things you can't see instead of the people

27:17.760 --> 27:23.440
in your life or the the relationships in your community or the the changes that are being made

27:23.440 --> 27:31.280
around you and it's because they have had this plan for decades to invert the sovereignty of our

27:31.280 --> 27:38.400
children into permission so that all of their medical medical data could be collected so that

27:38.400 --> 27:45.360
all of their medical treatments could be obligated or at least regimented

27:45.760 --> 27:53.760
so that they can collect the data that they need before it's gone and if the population isn't

27:53.760 --> 28:01.040
going to get any bigger then this is the largest sample set of human genomes and human medical

28:01.040 --> 28:06.240
lifetimes that will ever be available on the planet again you need to really see this from

28:06.800 --> 28:13.120
the hundred thousand foot or the orbit level these people have been thinking about this for

28:13.120 --> 28:19.840
generations with their dads and with their dads dads and the plan has always been why are we

28:19.840 --> 28:25.200
going to bring this population down in a peaceful way where there's no revolt and there's no there's

28:25.200 --> 28:33.440
not as as little strife as possible and then that's the public facing brochure of the club of Rome

28:34.720 --> 28:39.920
in the background in the in the meetings in the wine cellars in the meetings after the

28:40.480 --> 28:43.440
after the public meetings they talk about what are they going to do

28:44.480 --> 28:52.240
with all these useless eaters that urine you know that that that bald gay guy with glasses that

28:52.240 --> 28:58.560
talks about about useless eaters all the time constantly is is irritating with that statement

29:01.600 --> 29:06.400
they need to collect our data we are not one generation from the end of the world

29:07.120 --> 29:12.640
but we are a couple generations away from there not being 10 billion people on the planet anymore

29:12.640 --> 29:19.440
and that means there is an opportunity there the babies to come are not going to be as

29:19.440 --> 29:25.600
numerous as the babies that are here now and have arrived in the last 10 years and so there is a

29:25.600 --> 29:33.760
window of time for them to collect the amount of data that's available in America all these

29:33.840 --> 29:40.000
multi-racial genomes and all these multi-racial babies being born going to waste

29:42.080 --> 29:48.240
medical experiments going to waste missing opportunities that may never come again for generations

29:51.920 --> 29:58.560
and they're mirrored on the other side of the world with real homogenous populations in China

29:58.640 --> 30:05.600
and some of these islands in the Pacific and in India and so the genetic opportunity

30:05.600 --> 30:11.440
that the earth's population represents right now and for the next 10 to 20 years

30:11.440 --> 30:18.080
is a genetic opportunity for the collection of data that will in their own plan never exist

30:18.080 --> 30:24.080
again they don't want to have 10 billion people on the planet forever that's now and for the next

30:24.080 --> 30:30.080
generation or two when they go down to like two billion or less what are the Georgia

30:30.080 --> 30:37.040
guides don't say five hundred thousand if that's the plan ladies and gentlemen there are some

30:37.040 --> 30:44.240
go games that need to be recorded there are some chess matches that need recording

30:44.240 --> 30:49.920
or they're never going to be there again that's what we're dealing with here ladies and gentlemen

30:49.920 --> 30:54.960
that's why they had to tell us this fantastic tale and they had to tell us this fantastic

30:54.960 --> 31:02.320
tale over several decades because they were taking biology that is essentially part of all of us

31:02.320 --> 31:09.200
and all mammals and all life on earth and trying to compartmentalize it into this molecular

31:09.200 --> 31:14.320
malevolence outside of us that all other life on earth has to deal with

31:14.320 --> 31:21.840
us so that they could govern us by that mythology and the pandemic was supposed to

31:21.840 --> 31:28.480
be like the chokehold that knocked us out where we just wake up and it's a KO we never questioned

31:28.480 --> 31:35.200
it again because our parents passed it on to us and now we were about to pass it on to our kids

31:35.760 --> 31:41.760
and the pandemic was supposed to really drive it home make sure that bam not only did we drive

31:41.840 --> 31:48.400
it home but that they could that they could essentially wreck America and the western and western

31:50.560 --> 31:53.360
national sovereignty sovereignty with the same blow

31:56.240 --> 32:01.840
and that's why you see the Netherlands democracy just spinning its wheels why you see

32:01.840 --> 32:08.880
the UK democracy spinning its wheels why you see the Canadian democracy just it's it's sad really how

32:09.440 --> 32:12.800
how Australia it's all the same

32:15.920 --> 32:22.160
and in America and in our own special way despite all of the the protections that we still haven't

32:22.160 --> 32:28.400
totally screwed up in our legislation and in our in our constitution we are also spinning our wheels

32:28.400 --> 32:35.360
because the people who are driving the jeep that we are in the muds all over the windows the mud

32:35.440 --> 32:40.640
has passed the wheels and their only thing is to say no no no don't worry about what's outside

32:40.640 --> 32:45.360
we're moving it's just fine and they're just slamming the the brake uh the the pedal to the metal

32:47.760 --> 32:53.600
and we're sinking deeper into the mud and they don't care that's what they were paid to do

32:54.560 --> 33:00.960
they were paid to keep us in this mud arguing about lab leak or natural virus arguing about

33:00.960 --> 33:07.360
ibermectin hard-viewing about hydroxychloroquine and her early treatment and long covid

33:10.480 --> 33:19.440
and it is a collective agreement to lie about the novel virus to lie about the strange disease

33:20.000 --> 33:23.120
and there are many liars

33:23.280 --> 33:32.880
there's no way in 2024 for anyone to be so super certain that there was a covid to be so super

33:32.880 --> 33:38.000
certain that they were sick three times to be so super certain that something devastated happening

33:38.000 --> 33:42.640
in new york city when there is no evidence for anything devastating happening in new york city

33:42.640 --> 33:51.520
there is evidence for a train wreck of human misery malevolence and probably deception

33:52.480 --> 33:56.240
i don't know it's a crime scene i don't have the details can you please just send somebody to

33:56.240 --> 34:02.720
figure this out

34:03.680 --> 34:11.120
so

34:14.560 --> 34:22.000
so today i want to watch front line coronavirus pandemic released on april premiered on april 21st

34:22.000 --> 34:27.600
2020 so what that means is that this is going to be propaganda at its at its best

34:28.320 --> 34:38.960
come but it's also something very important to see april 21st 2020 the world has been shut down

34:38.960 --> 34:47.040
we have been locked down for about a month 15 days has now become 30 my kids are still not in school

34:47.120 --> 34:58.640
and so the bomb has gone off in new york city the fraud that jessica hockett is trying to call

34:58.640 --> 35:06.800
attention to has happened nurse erin has already been on journeyman pictures

35:07.520 --> 35:10.320
peer cori has already been in front of the senate

35:13.120 --> 35:14.400
or will be in a week

35:17.200 --> 35:21.440
and peer cori has already been on youtube to say that all these people are having

35:22.400 --> 35:26.320
pulse ox below 88 wonder what my pulse ox is right now

35:28.320 --> 35:30.160
i'm a little bit worked up you know from the

35:30.160 --> 35:41.360
uh let's see oh 99 oh that's um i'm really uh i'm a strong beast here this is uh crazy

35:42.480 --> 35:48.320
hold on a second i don't know if i can do that i think i can with my left hand there 98

35:49.040 --> 35:54.560
funny let's see i got another one over here we'll see if there's any variation between pulse oximeters

35:55.200 --> 36:01.200
this one you have to turn on with a button and this one reads the right way i think you can

36:01.200 --> 36:07.360
flip the other one but i'm not very i'm not gonna go into the oh 97 wow i'm only three digits away

36:07.360 --> 36:13.200
from having to go to the hospital i mean because the 94 is where you should probably go to the

36:13.200 --> 36:22.400
hospital 90 oh no what's happening i better oxygenate my blood or i'm gonna be i'm gonna

36:22.400 --> 36:25.680
somebody's gonna say i got covid i i don't know that's pretty nuts

36:28.320 --> 36:33.040
94 is what i should no no oh my gosh what's happening

36:34.560 --> 36:38.000
i'm i'm not gonna hold my breath but i and why would i hold my breath

36:42.480 --> 36:46.560
take deep breath stop talking so much you're always talking my wife would love it if i would

36:46.560 --> 36:50.800
stop talking so much okay there it comes all right i thought i had covid for a second holy

36:50.800 --> 37:00.320
shit that really scared me so um hmm anyway uh yeah so what were we doing oh yeah we had this

37:00.320 --> 37:06.320
screen up where's the screen um oh no i'm supposed to be over here and then over here that's what i

37:06.320 --> 37:11.840
wanted to do ha ha sorry too many buttons um so let's watch this thing right let's let's see what

37:11.840 --> 37:22.800
we got here i i did turn it to 1.5 speed um because when the guy is narrating it's just

37:22.800 --> 37:27.920
brutal um when some people are talking it's a little fast so we may adjust but we'll see

37:28.480 --> 37:31.120
i guess i could use the space bar but the space bar does double

37:32.720 --> 37:35.600
when somebody's the president the authority is total he's not doing everything he can do

37:35.600 --> 37:37.520
mating against one another tell you how frustrating it is

37:37.520 --> 37:40.000
amid the escalating crisis between the president and the states over the

37:40.160 --> 37:43.600
oh no we're gonna have to go a little slower here because that's you're missing too much

37:43.600 --> 37:47.920
story of how the outbreak began i'm gonna go back i'm gonna go back the reason washing in state

37:50.800 --> 37:55.920
so remember this is pbs news hour so just get the feeling april 21st

37:55.920 --> 38:00.880
did they want to keep people calm did they want to keep people from panicking

38:01.920 --> 38:08.000
did they want to reassure people that everything was under control that everything was going to be

38:08.000 --> 38:14.320
fine despite some of the the rhetoric and and some of the disagreements between leaders of states

38:14.320 --> 38:19.920
and the federal government what's the vibe that you get from this this um this video

38:20.800 --> 38:24.960
when somebody's the president the authority is total he's not doing everything he can do

38:24.960 --> 38:27.840
mating against one another tell you how frustrating it is

38:27.840 --> 38:32.960
amid the escalating crisis between the president and the states over the coronavirus pandemic

38:32.960 --> 38:38.400
has nothing to do with the president or federal policy or the inside story of how the outbreak

38:38.400 --> 38:47.040
began in the united states yeah seriously this is the equivalent of a uh uh i won't say it but i

38:47.040 --> 38:54.160
agree with i agree with uh yeah they're really just ramping it up here it's impressive but you can

38:54.160 --> 39:02.720
already see it right this is definitely um wow the reason washing in state found that first case

39:02.960 --> 39:10.800
as we were ready for it correspondent miles o'brien on the ground with those who detected it first

39:10.800 --> 39:17.920
within the first five days we had 32 positives we then knew that this was a much bigger outbreak

39:17.920 --> 39:24.000
than you could have imagined and the tale of two washingtons does that governor is a snake okay

39:24.880 --> 39:30.560
insley we are not going to be distracted by any rhetoric that the president or anyone else uses

39:30.560 --> 39:34.800
facts and science that's the only thing that's going to get us through this now on front line

39:36.240 --> 39:41.680
coronavirus they had that graphic ready in january of 2020 just so you know that graphic was ready and

39:41.680 --> 39:46.080
they've been using it for four and a half years straight it's impressive iris pandemic

39:52.480 --> 39:54.640
it was one of the most vibrant cities in america

39:55.520 --> 40:02.320
our economy was strong the port that was one of the leading ports in the country

40:03.440 --> 40:08.720
we had one of the most vibrant restaurant scenes small businesses flourishing

40:10.080 --> 40:13.680
and we went from that to almost zero overnight

40:13.680 --> 40:27.120
I arrived in seattle in mid march a city and state in the process of shutting down before

40:27.120 --> 40:33.760
that was the norm in the rest of the country i've covered science stories for nearly 30 years

40:33.760 --> 40:41.440
see that's the that's the whole point though um this is now saying 96 and 98 um i just thought

40:41.440 --> 40:47.280
i'd check and see they're they're two digits off um that's that's the point this is 2020

40:47.280 --> 40:53.280
hindsight is 2020 we can look back and say wow were we fooled or not and i think looking back now i

40:53.280 --> 40:59.520
think it's safe to say that we were fooled that as we have been trying to characterize accurately

40:59.520 --> 41:08.800
on giga ohm biological for quite some time the illusion of consensus about the worst case scenario

41:08.800 --> 41:18.080
happening was on mainstream media and on social media and in the dark corners of the internet

41:18.080 --> 41:22.720
where people were debating the worst case scenario about a lab leak which is not going to be talked

41:22.720 --> 41:30.800
about here and so understand how incredible of an illusion where you have this thing where

41:30.800 --> 41:35.840
donald trump and the governors of states are fighting about what should be done and those

41:35.840 --> 41:40.960
are all the wrong questions and if you went somewhere on the internet to find the right

41:40.960 --> 41:45.200
questions you would find people arguing about whether it was a lab leak or just a natural thing

41:46.400 --> 41:54.880
also the wrong question and so this limited spectrum of debate which we including myself

41:54.880 --> 42:03.920
have assumed his exclusively the domain of the mainstream media was actually also the domain of

42:03.920 --> 42:13.200
social media and artificially created groups entities and individuals like epigirl in the

42:13.200 --> 42:22.160
spars pandemic document if they revealed in the forward-facing brochure called the spars pandemic

42:22.160 --> 42:30.320
document whatever it's called the scenario that there might be a social media influencer called

42:30.320 --> 42:35.760
epigirl that would be responsible for spreading the misinformation on the internet about the

42:35.760 --> 42:44.160
vaccine injuries is it not very hard to imagine that the actual plan would include fake epigirls

42:46.320 --> 42:51.600
is it actually that hard to imagine that not only would they have decided okay if we're going

42:51.600 --> 42:56.640
to do this i mean if we're really going to do this then we're going to have to control this

42:56.720 --> 43:04.960
media and this narrative but also the opposition to it and the only way to do that is to have a

43:04.960 --> 43:13.360
lot of epigirls please get that document for yourself the spars pandemic document and read it

43:13.920 --> 43:20.080
and understand that it's a public facing brochure that there is a classified version of that that

43:20.080 --> 43:27.040
has the details of where the lies fit in and the epigirl chapter is a fantastic example

43:29.360 --> 43:33.760
of where on its face it seems like oh yeah we're opposing misinformation what it is and is an

43:33.760 --> 43:39.680
admission that they understand that social media influencers can do that therefore they are obviously

43:39.680 --> 43:45.040
going to use social media influencers that is the definition of fifth generation warfare it is

43:45.040 --> 43:52.960
coordinated lying across across opinions that appear to be opposing opinions and those

43:52.960 --> 43:57.040
opposing opinions are actually the walls of the cage that we're in

43:58.960 --> 44:06.080
and when we look back at PBS NewsHour we see one aspect right that's looking at the north wall of

44:06.080 --> 44:12.080
the cage and the north wall of the cage is composed of people who are pretending that it's something

44:12.080 --> 44:20.640
like a botched response and that Trump doesn't believe and that these people believe and that's

44:20.640 --> 44:26.000
that wall but if you turn around and try to go the other way there's another wall over there and that

44:26.000 --> 44:31.680
wall is people who are saying that they're covering up a lab leak and that's why they won't talk about

44:31.680 --> 44:38.240
it on PBS NewsHour right now and that wall ladies and gentlemen listen carefully was composed of

44:38.240 --> 44:47.920
people like me the entire group of drastic people like Dan Saratkin and his father they all were

44:47.920 --> 44:52.480
part I was part of the debate about whether it was a lab leak and whether they were covering up and

44:52.480 --> 44:59.040
we were all sure so some people were were engaged in the forward-facing argument which is on the PBS

44:59.040 --> 45:06.560
NewsHour which is it's Trump versus the smart people or some subtle nuanced version of that

45:08.000 --> 45:14.080
or they were back there at this wall or they were over there on that wall where the American

45:14.080 --> 45:18.240
frontline doctors were saying it was early treatment or they were on this wall where the

45:18.240 --> 45:23.600
where the FLCCC dot people were saying that it's early treatment you know that's how it is

45:23.680 --> 45:33.600
and that's the message that Giga on biological can clarify with the truth of the biology as best we

45:33.600 --> 45:41.920
can distill it and trying to outline where the fidelity ends in our understanding so that we can

45:41.920 --> 45:46.160
acknowledge once again that we should have some reverence for the sacred biology that exists

45:46.160 --> 45:50.880
beyond our understanding that we should have some reverence for the irreducible complexity that

45:50.880 --> 45:55.360
exists beyond our understanding and and respect that as a an unknown

45:57.360 --> 46:04.000
rather than to either deny it on the on the news or to distort it on the internet

46:07.520 --> 46:15.120
so as usual I have a real hard time getting a a video started mostly because somebody is a

46:15.120 --> 46:21.600
wonderful commenter and then I get started on a rant but that epigirl thing and understanding

46:21.600 --> 46:30.320
if epigirl is the brochure then what is the epigirl chapter look like in the classified version of it

46:31.840 --> 46:34.320
but this felt more like science fiction

46:34.320 --> 46:43.200
the deadly disease covid-19 was about to bring the country and the world to its knees

46:45.040 --> 46:51.440
it's like watching a slow-moving landslide move towards you how did it i think they would

46:51.440 --> 46:55.200
scrap the vents in Canada so that the evidence of how many were purchased

46:56.800 --> 47:02.720
would be lost um there that's why they would scrap the vents and you don't want

47:02.800 --> 47:07.040
to remind people that wow did we really do that how much damage would that have done

47:07.680 --> 47:12.880
and they might also reveal exactly what vents were used and whether those vents had the

47:13.360 --> 47:18.080
you know capability of being oh you know there are lots of evidence i think so yeah

47:18.080 --> 47:26.800
debate our warning systems our best science a lot of people died because we weren't ready

47:27.680 --> 47:36.240
why was our government so slow to act because we weren't ready a lot of people died because

47:36.240 --> 47:47.360
we weren't ready why was our government so slow to act so unprepared i haven't cried ever as much

47:47.360 --> 47:54.560
as i had in the last week and what lies ahead i haven't cried ever as much as i've cried

47:55.200 --> 48:01.440
this past week it sounds very similar to that guy that was on tucker very early on saying it's

48:01.440 --> 48:08.480
it's hell it's hell in New York City it's a war zone or something like that

48:10.000 --> 48:14.400
but the numbers weren't there the numbers aren't there the numbers still aren't there yet some

48:14.400 --> 48:18.480
people are still arguing that they were there that they know because their son and their daughter

48:18.480 --> 48:23.680
in law sought or they treated them from Maine

48:27.360 --> 48:32.800
it's the insistence ladies and gentlemen the absolute insistence of these people

48:32.800 --> 48:44.000
that really gets me because it's all that's needed they just have to agree on that one thing

48:44.000 --> 48:48.640
okay i won't i won't question the virus i won't question the existence of a novel pathogen i

48:48.640 --> 48:58.000
won't question the existence of a novel set of symptoms um okay i understand it's a national

48:58.000 --> 49:04.720
security priority i get it okay and then they signed or then they said yes or then the guys left

49:05.040 --> 49:10.720
and that's it that might be all they know

49:13.440 --> 49:20.480
but there are people who know that i guarantee you at this stage there are people who have known

49:20.480 --> 49:27.520
that from the very beginning because that's how we are governed we are governed via mythologies

49:27.680 --> 49:35.920
and it is not just mythologies about people's marital affairs or mythologies about people's

49:35.920 --> 49:42.480
financial affairs it is mythologies about foreign affairs it is mythologies about foreign relationships

49:42.480 --> 49:50.800
it is about it is mythologies about economy and economics and how that works it is mythologies

49:50.800 --> 49:58.400
about banking mythologies about stock markets and mythologies about biosecurity

50:00.800 --> 50:07.600
priorities and these mythologies are most aptly

50:10.400 --> 50:15.760
in plain sight in other words you can get closest to the brick wall by watching old pbs

50:15.840 --> 50:26.480
news hour especially from the start of the pandemic welcome to the show

50:34.560 --> 50:39.200
so sahomish county man was in washington mark has done an extraordinary

50:39.200 --> 50:46.880
came to yack looking for answers my first stop it's horrible it's horrible it's horrible

50:46.880 --> 50:54.000
it's horrible in nearby Everett it's horrible but i'm so pessimistic about this my first thought

50:54.000 --> 51:01.200
when i saw that picture back there was to reach out my left looking for answers

51:03.200 --> 51:08.640
i'm sorry that's not nice and i do not make fun of anything that i'm mad about in nearby

51:08.640 --> 51:20.400
Everett and he's pbs news okay this is the hospital that treated the first known case of

51:20.400 --> 51:29.760
covid 19 in the country how does a one-hour man put on a mask i met dr george dias an expert

51:29.760 --> 51:36.640
in infectious diseases who treated patient one a 35 year old local man so apparently he's got

51:36.640 --> 51:41.920
to wear a mask because he's been out of the country in the last 30 days and he hasn't so he

51:41.920 --> 51:46.880
doesn't need to wear a mask i assume that's what we're seeing here because otherwise that doctor

51:46.880 --> 51:52.720
should also have a mask on it's interesting already to start who'd flown into seattle on january 15th

51:54.000 --> 51:58.320
he was having cough he had been having fevers at home he hadn't been eating well

51:59.040 --> 52:04.400
his he generally felt poorly and he had been complaining of diary at home he is the sahomish

52:04.400 --> 52:08.320
county man we're not going to give him a name there's no photograph there's nothing

52:08.320 --> 52:15.200
this guy's telling us in april 21st what happened he's 35 years old and otherwise healthy totally

52:15.200 --> 52:21.840
healthy person he began developing symptoms the day after he arrived he went to this walk-in clinic

52:21.840 --> 52:25.520
and this is not real footage of him going to the walk-in clinic even though

52:26.400 --> 52:31.520
scribed his symptoms and told them where he had been for about six weeks

52:32.640 --> 52:33.760
Wuhan china

52:38.960 --> 52:46.560
that was a crucial detail for weeks Wuhan had been the center of a growing storm

52:47.280 --> 52:52.400
signed this in china trying to determine if a new virus news trickled out about cases of a strange

52:52.400 --> 53:03.600
new pneumonia strange it's very strange so very strange oh yeah i could do that how do i do that

53:03.600 --> 53:07.040
so very strange a very strange pneumonia

53:07.920 --> 53:15.520
in seattle a city known for cutting edge medicine and technology as well as ties to

53:15.520 --> 53:23.200
asia officials told me they had been on alert it clearly had the global cities folks and they

53:23.200 --> 53:29.840
in turn were starting to line up the other department starting with human services about how we're

53:29.840 --> 53:35.360
going to respond when and if it arrived on our shores at the clinic where the man returning from

53:35.360 --> 53:42.240
Wuhan was seeking treatment they took no chances that point the clinic appropriately isolated him

53:42.240 --> 53:47.360
the health district contacted cdc who advised testing uh unfortunately that clinic had the

53:47.360 --> 53:52.560
appropriate gear to be able to safely test the patient he was in advice to go home and quarantine

53:53.120 --> 53:58.320
the clinic sent a nasal swab they taken from the man to the centers for disease control and

53:58.320 --> 54:02.560
perfect lucky they had the equipment necessary to take a nasal swab right

54:03.440 --> 54:10.480
the hell did that mean he said that why did they why did he say that that point the clinic

54:10.480 --> 54:16.240
appropriately isolated him the health district contacted cdc who advised testing uh unfortunately

54:16.240 --> 54:21.360
that clinic had the appropriate gear to be able to safely test the patient he was in advice to go

54:21.360 --> 54:28.160
home and quarantine the appropriate gear being like a one foot long q-tip i don't i i'm still

54:28.160 --> 54:34.000
confused like because ditra did all the sequencing ditra did all the sampling

54:34.000 --> 54:40.080
for the beginning of the pandemic i don't know how long into 2020 or 21 but for a long time

54:40.640 --> 54:45.600
all of the sampling was centralized at the cdc and ditra actually controlled the sequencing we

54:45.600 --> 54:51.920
know that from mark's excellent work team the clinic sent a nasal swab they taken from the man

54:51.920 --> 54:57.760
to the centers for disease control and prevention they also had to have uh those tubes so you know

54:57.760 --> 55:03.760
lucky they had that shit netlanta and then within 25 hours we had a call from the cdc saying that

55:03.760 --> 55:10.640
the test was positive uh and that they wanted us to admit him for observation the first covid 19

55:10.640 --> 55:18.720
patient had been confirmed in the united states around 10 p.m on january 20th patient one was brought

55:18.720 --> 55:24.640
to the province there's a lot of crosses they're showing providence crosses a lot interesting uh

55:25.440 --> 55:31.360
choice for the black cross here um at least it's not inverted it's regional medical center

55:33.360 --> 55:41.680
this is a photograph of his arrival so they sent him home and then the cdc said hey wait it was

55:41.680 --> 55:46.480
positive so you better go get him back into the hospital and then they brought him in on this

55:46.800 --> 55:54.640
look at all those those places to put your hands in in case you want to touch him or something

55:56.640 --> 56:03.200
in case in what's called an isopod isopod an isopod which is not to be confused with those things

56:03.200 --> 56:08.880
they sell at reptiles shows to feed your animals patient quarantined patient number one arrived

56:08.880 --> 56:13.920
here in this he did when we were going through the transportation plan with there's not a guy in

56:13.920 --> 56:18.720
there is there a guy trying to keep it paid oh there that looks blurred out i see oh he was

56:18.720 --> 56:23.120
wearing black scrubs he must have been a giga home biological fan that's interesting

56:24.560 --> 56:29.360
there he is he's he's black he's definitely a chinese guy you can see clearly patient quarantined

56:29.920 --> 56:34.960
patient number one arrived here in this he did when we were going through the transportation plan

56:34.960 --> 56:40.240
with uh the the ambulance company they wanted to keep their staff safe completely contained

56:40.240 --> 56:46.400
doesn't allow any possibility of infection so our patient was placed in this by EMS and

56:46.400 --> 56:50.880
brought to our hospital and unloaded in his room so it took us about two hours from the time that

56:50.880 --> 56:57.040
cdc called for us to get all our staff personnel supplies and the facilities on place to be able to

56:57.680 --> 57:02.640
give the EMS folks a green light to come in you did that in two hours two hours we were ready for it

57:03.120 --> 57:09.760
one of the reasons they were so ready less than three weeks earlier dia's and his colleagues

57:09.760 --> 57:16.720
this is a mask so that i can uh i can play a horn you know like a trumpet with this mask on that's

57:16.720 --> 57:22.880
that's one of the nice things that we did to our kids um all all around the same time and actually

57:22.880 --> 57:28.560
not yet these masks didn't come out until we went back to school right remember scared we scared

57:28.640 --> 57:33.600
we scared him first in front of screens at home and then when we brought him back to school we

57:33.600 --> 57:41.040
we had the the music companies make um really thick shitty masks with multi-layered holes in

57:41.040 --> 57:46.080
them so that people could play horns in addition to those you know playing flute in a box kind of

57:46.080 --> 57:53.840
nonsense as well um extraordinary times ladies and gentlemen we cannot forget how much we lost

57:53.840 --> 58:00.640
our minds or we won't be able to to pull our heads out head conducted an elaborate simulation

58:01.680 --> 58:08.000
pandemic training we were aware of what was going on in Wuhan at that point but it was it was part

58:08.000 --> 58:13.680
of our routine structure already to prepare really had a go-to plan we had a game plan in place

58:14.400 --> 58:19.840
already we had everyone involved including the local EMS so those people that bring the

58:19.840 --> 58:25.680
patients from point A to point B public health hospitals and other partners we have the community

58:25.680 --> 58:34.720
to drill and so we had a variety of scenarios went through by the time patient one was hospitalized

58:34.720 --> 58:41.040
local public health officials were going into high gear the reason Washington state found that

58:41.040 --> 58:47.040
first case as we were ready for it the ambulance service was ready they knew the right personal

58:47.120 --> 58:53.200
protective equipment to where it was one of those uh absolute coordination between health care

58:53.200 --> 58:58.160
local health state health and the CDC it went perfectly that's how we were able to find the

58:58.160 --> 59:05.440
first case in the country it was a critical early warning sign that the highly contagious

59:05.440 --> 59:13.280
coronavirus could be spreading in the US but in his first public comments president trump

59:13.280 --> 59:18.720
dismissed any threat to the rest of the country have you been briefed by the no no why are they

59:18.720 --> 59:23.120
saying highly contagious i have the feeling that they're saying that because of what has

59:23.120 --> 59:30.720
already happened in New York City that's what i think and we're not really saying it right now

59:30.720 --> 59:36.480
because they don't want to call too much attention to the number of people who have died in New York

59:36.480 --> 59:43.040
City they don't want too much scrutiny right now and they want focus on the future of what's

59:43.040 --> 59:46.640
going to happen in the future they don't want you to look back yet they don't want you to look

59:46.640 --> 59:50.880
out the windows of the car they don't they want you to keep your eyes right through the front

59:50.880 --> 59:55.120
of the windshield don't look back out the back window don't look at the rear view mirror about

59:55.120 --> 01:00:02.720
what just happened keep your eyes focused forward where trump is and where these governors are making

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:10.080
big stories and and statements do not look back to see what happened in New York City that's one

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.440
of the main messages i hear here see the words about a pandemic at this point no we're not at all

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:22.240
and we're we have it totally under control it's one person coming in from china and we have it

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.400
under control it's china gonna be just fine fear law always says it like that safe travels

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:37.520
china in seattle doctors and scientists weren't so sure they didn't have a way to test for coronavirus

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.840
on their own oh and while the cdc had been able to test the sample from patient one but that's weird

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:50.320
because testing is just pcr that anyone in academia could do you could order the primers online you

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:57.760
could run the test and test it they had no way of doing it but lucky enough they had the equipment

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:04.480
to sample his nasal passages right lucky enough they had the equipment and they had done drills already

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:12.560
I mean why wouldn't you do drills for a pandemic at a hospital i'm sure all the hospitals in america

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:21.680
were doing pandemic drills in january 2020 it didn't yet have a test it could deploy on a massive scale

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.720
around the country the ways to really know the burden of disease in your community is to be able to

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.720
test so the testing piece was a huge piece of the puzzle that we didn't really fully

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.800
now keep in mind the illusion that they want to create here is that the lack of testing

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.440
allowed the virus to escape our control the lack of testing is part of the reason why

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.240
Brett Weinstein was so amplified about zero covid all the time because zero covid was a concept

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.080
zero covid was a mythology that got you to believe that there was a virus but we could get back to zero

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:10.160
that that whole idea of eliminating a virus was possible we've done it before with vaccines

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:16.720
why can't we do it now with lockdowns and masks and again you are now participating in a limited

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.280
spectrum of debate where all the biology is actually just immunomythology a national security

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.640
narrative being told to you so that you accept a certain set of circumstances as being reality

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:36.000
and that you pass that set of circumstances or rather you pass that understanding of your

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.760
circumstances to your children we weren't fully able to address by early february with the virus

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.120
spreading around the globe the world health organization was recommending test kits that

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.640
had been developed in germany but us officials made a fateful decision to go their own way

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.000
if you look at a moment when the united states may have lost

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:09.440
right its ability to control what's happening it begins with the decision early on in 2020

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.200
by the cdc not to utilize the test kits and the capabilities that were being shared by the

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.000
world health organization and other nations now that's very interesting of course because

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.480
one of the most striking examples of the attempt to control the narrative is the example of the

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.160
corman drossin report which was a paper that was published by a number of interesting names

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.520
including claire craig michael eden uh kevin mccernan um thomas binder

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:49.840
and um a seam uh not no no there is another uh person um um

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.440
pere peter borger from the netherlands there's a few others that have all played kind of a

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:06.160
pretty central role in in speaking out about the the narrative being wrong very early in the

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:15.120
pandemic and interestingly kevin mccernan of course has risen through the ranks of these

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:25.920
these medlers um as a as a humble cannabis geneticist um to the state to where uh after being on my

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:33.200
show twice after being on a live stream um with me and stephanie sineff and Jessica rose and

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:44.400
john bodewin on on st patrick's day in 2022 or 2023 i guess it's 2022 um no i think it was 2023

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.800
um he decided that he had to block i think it was 2022 he had to block me on twitter

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.000
and started making fun of me started saying i was an idiot started saying that i didn't know

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.280
what i was talking about and i have reason to believe that he may have been involved in

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:11.600
in contacting chd while i was working there and complaining about me um and that had some

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:19.920
consequences for my employment there um i don't know what else went on behind the scenes but i do

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:27.200
know that that people contacted people at chd to complain about what i was saying about

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.120
certain people and that's what ultimately led to me being let go and those certain people

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:42.960
have to be maryll nass robert malone robert f Kennedy jr um and and kevin mccernan

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.720
uh because and mary mary holland because those are the people that i was talking about on my

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:54.480
stream in december and at the end of december over the christmas break talking about how mary

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.240
holland and maryll nass claimed to have vetted robert malone at his farm for two days before they

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:08.560
decided to have chd publish his book and maryll nass insists that he was just some guy and didn't

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.000
know all this stuff about the wef and all that before she told him while they were visiting him

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:22.000
and i just i just think that was incredible and in fact in a personal conversation that i had with

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:30.880
maryll nass sitting in the same restaurant at the same table she told me this story and then insisted

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:38.080
that robert malone took the shot and my response was but that's just ridiculous then he's either

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.440
an idiot or a liar and she basically said that not i don't know the exact words but she said

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:52.080
not everybody's as smart as uj and she stood up and walked away that's that's what happens when you

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:58.480
when you confront people who are either part of something and insist that you accept it

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.720
or are completely caught up in something that they themselves cannot see

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:11.200
and either way that was really the last cordial conversation that i've ever had with maryll nass

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:21.840
she's been on my show we've we've we've met in person um and and i got to say i don't think that

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:30.400
she's a very nice person she also insulted mark in a way um via email that that quite frankly if i

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.280
had any doubt or or or wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt all benefit of the doubt

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:45.120
went away after that email um and it's not it's not my place to divulge what she said but um she did

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:53.280
say it to me in an email about mark um and it was just absolutely atrocious what she said and so

01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:00.240
the the bottom line is is that i think we need to identify some of these people for who they

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.480
are and i'm afraid that some of these people are not going to be um who we all expected them to be

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:14.400
at the beginning of the pandemic i wish it was as easy as ralph barrack and and uh and peter daysack

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.680
i really do i wish it was as easy as saying that that tony fauci and ralph barrack and and

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.360
eco-health alliance are responsible for where we are and that if we just put these guys in jail

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:34.320
and a few of the dudes in in the d o d who are also responsible in jail or on trial or or take away

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:43.600
their jobs and pension um that will be right back on track and it's a much more complicated situation

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.240
than that because people are lying about people coordinatedly with other people who are lying about

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.040
people and they've been doing it for a long time the theater that we are trapped in has existed

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:59.600
before the pandemic and that's why it was so effective when they turned it on us and turned

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.440
the knob from four to eleven that's why it was so effective that's why when they turned the knob

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.880
to eleven also everybody was like wow isn't it weird before the trans before the pandemic i don't

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:19.760
remember them talking about the transgender issue so hard is now that's why you felt that because

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:25.360
the knob got turned to eleven but the whole amplifier and guitar and drums and everything

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.760
was already plugged in you already had the headphones on you were already carrying your

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.800
cell phone you already had subscribed to spotify you were already listening to the podcast

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.560
and so when they kicked off the pandemic and turned the knob to eleven everybody just wow

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:49.120
it's happening or yesterday you know you have your head in the box you got to pull your head out

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.960
or you're never going to escape that cacophony and this is how they started it

01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:00.080
the cdc wouldn't talk to me on camera but told me they took the swiftest path and using another

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:07.760
nation's tests would have caused worse delays former cdc director tom freden said the decision

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.760
made sense there's never been a kind previously when there was a need to use a test from outside

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:20.800
because the cdc system has not failed in the past the cdc began shipping its own test kits

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:28.480
to public health labs around the country but in seattle and elsewhere it was quickly obvious

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:36.640
that something was wrong one of the three chemical probes was faulty generating inconclusive results

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:47.040
so a technology that was perfected and has been used for at least 10 years on the academic bench

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:56.000
to great success was somehow rolled out by the us cdc with a faulty amplicon

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.560
and at the same time the who apparently issued a set of primers that could do primer dimers and

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:11.520
all kinds of other things that warranted a paper to be written by uh kevin mccurnan

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:23.200
mike eden claire kreg thomas binder uh peter borger and um and uh it was all organized by you

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.960
know i really got to find that because it was all organized by one of those dudes and i know

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:36.560
which one it is if i could see the list corpsman drawers and report review downloads adenum

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.160
corpsman drawsterreview.com is probably no longer online ha so the corpsman drawston review

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.680
which was supposed to be a a thing here well let's go i'll just show you what i'm doing

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.600
the corpsman drawston report a review report by an international consortium of sciences and

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:02.560
the life sciences in silicon uh meadow analysis blah blah blah blah after submitting our review on

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:10.480
corpsman et al it's it's supposed to be here that's just uh that's just uh a website with a casino so

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:17.840
all these people who thought it was really important for him to be objecting to the pandemic coronavirus

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.800
test that was put out by drawston they thought that that was such an important objection that they

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:30.720
got rid of their their dot com kevin mccurnan you know the guy who like sold companies already

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.400
in the eighties while i was still trying to figure out how to win at cyber ball at the mall um that guy

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.720
couldn't afford the couldn't afford the twelve dollars a year for corpsman drawston review dot

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:50.480
com or peter mcculler couldn't afford it or any of these other people that were that not one of

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.320
them decided hey maybe that work was important enough we should leave it online so that people

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.840
can find it in perpetuity they actually let that go away really

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.920
i got to find out where this uh if i can find i go go back one maybe maybe that's how i do it um

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:16.400
hold on one second

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.920
seriously come on okay here's the authors because we can see it but that the actual report doesn't

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:38.560
seem to be visible here are the authors so peter borger bobby rahesh mahaltra is actually who

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.000
who thomas binder said organize this

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:51.360
and that guy is definitely a medler at some point he promoted my review and said it was great thank

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.600
dr cooley for this great thing and then at some point he just blocked me he was going around all

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:04.880
around the internet calling people gloese as being uh intelligence agents or operations

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.520
um super medler so this is the guy who supposedly organized this list of of people that include

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:22.080
people like thomas binder and mike eden clair kreg um i think mike eden clair kreg and thomas binder

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:31.040
are all very very very good hearted well meaning honest people who were probably roped into this

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:40.800
paper as part of why do i have to keep clear all over calmer oh my gosh do you know who that is

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:53.440
that's the person who oh my gosh that's the person who supplied the transfected cell cultures from

01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:01.280
germany that buck halter claims to have or or kevin mccernan i don't know which one did it

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:07.120
claims to have sequenced in order to show that there seems to be integration of the double

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.280
stranded dna contamination into the genome of cancer cell lines that's the lady

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:23.280
unless i'm absolutely nuts that's her exact name

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:31.680
and so is she a good guy that was was roped in is she what exactly is happening here could

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.680
also be that at that time this is what they understood is the best thing to do so don't

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.600
don't misunderstand me that the likelihood that the mass majority of these people are not

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:48.400
knowing their unwitting participants is is very likely the question is who are the who are the

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.640
wedding participants who were the who were the real gloese here and i think i know who the real

01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:02.480
gloese were one of them was the guy who calling everybody else gloese and one of them is the guy

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:10.080
who more or less did his first major adult work in the context of the whitehead institute the

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.120
human genome project and the department of energy

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.280
make sure that we get these people under our control that we have influence in that they have

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:31.200
our trust we have their trust i should say that's what they would do that's what this paper

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.120
represents the first shot across the bow i thought that um actually peter mccullow is on

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.080
this paper too i'm surprised not to see him in the list

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.880
i wonder if this is because peter mccullow is not on the original one

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:58.960
hmm i i gotta see again here if i'm searching for the right thing or what because i still

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.760
want to see the original does anyone have the original oh yeah here

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.040
the original

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.280
i don't see i can't do anything with this what is this

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:29.040
i can't really see it um okay here yeah that one

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:39.120
um no so he's not that's fine i didn't i'm not saying anything other than i thought he was so

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.520
he wasn't i think i've said it out loud before on my stream that peter mccullow was on this paper

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:50.080
so i apologize for getting that wrong i thought he was um okay so anyway we know

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:58.320
peter borger has been a pretty good um outspoken at dutch guy who was talking very early about a

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:04.080
lab leak and talking about molecular evidence for a lab leak um basically molecular evidence for a

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.000
for a cv in a clone clone which i'm totally down with um shut up

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.000
bobby rahesh mahaltra i've told you already it was on twitter and he was definitely a

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.520
medler of some kind i don't know what his story is where is he from

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:27.680
to is it say at the bottom to where the authors are from

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.160
references to is

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:38.480
oh no

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:47.680
sorry i'm a little bit being a little bit of a dork here uh i don't see where this is listed

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.560
i don't see how you figure out what that means um but they all have separate listings i guess

01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:00.880
it doesn't really matter um yeah so you know michael eden is you know claire craggis she's part

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:09.120
of the heart group um you know kevin mccurnan is uh you know who thomas binder is um and i know

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.880
who all rica calmer is which i find very interesting um very very interesting

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.760
very interesting indeed okay thank you very much for that link in the chat you guys are awesome

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.480
there were his checks and balances within the test and when we validated can it detect the

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:35.600
virus and can it not over detect it that balance was not correct research and implementation

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:41.680
laboratories said you know this doesn't work you've given us a bogus kit and we're not going to use

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:50.240
it uh fix it fast remember laurie garret was also the uh person featured in that cnn documentary

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:57.440
called um ah shite what was it called we just covered it a couple weeks ago though it was a

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:04.480
cnn documentary and it was from 2018 and she was there in that documentary and one of the key

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.560
statements that she said into the camera which i laughed out loud and screamed about was the idea

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.000
that a worst case scenario listen carefully according to laurie garret a worst case scenario in one

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:24.240
of these situations is that the pandemic virus becomes endemic and of course the whole debate

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.240
about whether it would become endemic was also framed on the other side of the cage by people

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.040
like brent weinstein who said that zero covid was definitely a goal that we should go for

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.400
and that it would be possible if we could get everybody to take ivermectin and fluvoxamine

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:48.800
for 30 days and so the illusion of consensus about one a novel pathogen and about two

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:55.840
the potential danger for it of going endemic and being a permanent weight on society's shoulders and

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:04.320
three the the laudable and very realistic biological goal that a novel virus that was released at a

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:10.960
point but spreading very rapidly because of its unique molecular uh attributes could be stopped

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:20.400
with sufficient measures that included lockdowns masks and vaccines and in that giant cluster f

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.280
of nonsense there's not one useful question being asked not one useful argument occurring

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.440
because all all of the arguments assume that the novel virus is there and that the fear and

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.880
cleavage psychosis it to fly around the world faster than any other virus in history just like

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:48.320
charles rixie said from 2020 onward just like like all these people who knew that it was a

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.840
lab leak already in february 2020 knew that the fear and cleavage site was definitely an

01:21:53.840 --> 01:22:02.240
indicator maybe also those pesky hiv homologies but you know that paper was retracted so obviously

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.960
that was nothing and we're spinning our wheels deeper into the mud going nowhere but feeling

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.360
like we're really driving because the muds flying up on the window and the engines getting warm and

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.240
it's making a lot of noise and vibrating and half of the car half of the people in the jeep are

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.280
pretending to enjoy it pretending that this is how it's supposed to go that this is what it feels like

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:31.440
when you're driving four by four when really no we're sinking into the mud dudes this is wrong

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.840
we you know or give us the right to muse our own kits

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:46.160
at the university of washington i met virologist alex greninger who'd been trying to do just that

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.920
you've got to have the supply of testing absolutely do we need to be able to detect where the virus

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:57.280
is and then try and snuff it out i mean right prevent it's transmission there you go that's the

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:03.920
whole thing you got to question it you got to believe it question why we don't have tests question

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.840
why people haven't made it a priority get mad about it oh my gosh where the window is closing says

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:21.360
Brett it's just a it's just a shit show because Donald trump doesn't believe or he's a racist

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.520
that's what they did to us ladies and gentlemen that's what they did

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:34.160
and yes they got a few people to go on pbs news hour and say their lines this guy's fine

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.240
with saying his lines he has been watching the tv he has been watching his social media and he

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:49.440
believes that that illusion of consensus is not an illusion it is undeniable evidence of an ongoing

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.880
worst case scenario that's what they so adeptly let us all to believe

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.840
with an illusion of consensus that span from the most propagandist pbs news hour in in america to the

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:14.080
most uh wide open news in australia that was saying it was a lab leak that america was covering up

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:20.320
before anybody else did scooby doo ladies and gentlemen scooby doo that's the name of the game

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.960
in the coming months but he ran into a bureaucratic brick wall the food and drug administration had

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:34.320
instituted emergency procedures to make sure any new tests were accurate you can make your own

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:39.840
test but you have to send it to the fda and get it reviewed and then authorized and i'll admit i'm

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.400
my first couple of years here in this particular job i had not been through this process before

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.640
the fda application was 28 pages long and required him to run tests that would take at least two weeks

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.560
and that wasn't all one of the things is they needed a document fedex across the country

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.840
before they would could look at the document you couldn't electronically transfer i could

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.880
electronically transmit it but they couldn't look at it until it's fedex and then they changed that

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.600
regulation and so from a couple days after february 4th all the way to february 26th

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.000
they didn't have a test they were completely blind too this had to be incredibly frustrating

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.960
it was frustrating it was what's really weird is that they didn't have a test

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:25.120
but it didn't start killing people either that's one of the things that jessica and i

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:33.440
and her friend um whose name escapes me um when we were talking to the staff of senator ron johnson

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:39.120
last week um one of the things that really got me up out of my chair figuratively was

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.160
that at some point the staffers said that uh yeah but we didn't have any testing then

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:51.600
and so it was probably spreading in the background um before march of 2020 and we just didn't know it

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.480
well how the hell would that happen if a virus that could cause what happened in new york city

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:03.040
as documented by jessica rose or sorry jessica hockett as ignored by jessica rose

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.600
documented by jessica hockett some kind of weird bomb went off over four weeks

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.440
if there was a virus underlying that

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:22.400
then why didn't the virus do that anywhere else before that time if it started in a mud puddle

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.760
then the diversity of the virus as we go backwards in time should have decreased the

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:34.000
phylogenetic tree gets narrower and narrower which means it's far less likely for the virus

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.840
to be particularly deadly in new york city where it hadn't been deadly in chicago a month before

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.280
but some reason or another somebody like maryll nast thinks she needs to write a

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.160
sub stack about about people taking pop shots and we shouldn't argue among the dissidents

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.760
and and just dismisses the observations that jessica is trying to get answers for

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.480
just dismisses the idea that an rna cannot pandemic but an infectious clone could be used to make it

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.960
look like it was an rna cannot pandemic but a background signal could be adequately characterized

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.800
and then misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen if a national security operation required it

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:24.160
and instead she goes on to insist that there was a disease that she experienced it three times

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.680
that she's treated it and now suddenly her son and daughter-in-law were involved in it in new york

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:40.240
city how come those heroes were never lauded by their mom already four years ago why didn't she

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.960
do a blog post about it why did is this the first time that that she's revealed that she had real

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.320
firsthand data about the tragedy that happened in new york city because her son was there as a

01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:00.320
cardiologist but instead writes a sub stack where she just kind of says that they were

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:07.920
health care providers and they treated other doctors kind of sorta and then ignores the fact

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.040
that there is no data to show that the hospitals were flooded just insists that they were

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.960
and her main evidence for covid being real is that she's had it three times although she didn't bother

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.240
to test she's just a doctor and can tell the difference between a strange disease and one that

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:33.600
she's had before or isn't strange apparently this woman who is recorded in a transcript in a

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.360
congressional hearing about the anthrax vaccine following up comments made by Robert Malone

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:47.280
yeah okay the woman who's been an advisor to chd since they were formed more or less and an

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:54.960
advisor on a scientific level to robert f Kennedy jr for years but they haven't been able to win

01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.240
a case they haven't been able to succinctly say that intramuscular injection of any combination

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.960
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb they just keep saying health

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.840
freedom and now she's seen necessary after all the the the gratitude that she has for chd she's

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.760
decided to start a new nonprofit so that donors can give her money to fight the who

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:26.480
because that's so patriotic and that's so you know uh so such an organization that there are so

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.400
many so many levers you know of power that we can pull with regard to the who we better focus on them

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:39.440
instead of trying to elect people that would change the prep act or elect or support uh legal

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:44.320
cases that would attack the prep act on a seventh amendment basis or at least draw attention to the

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.280
fact that that's the real way out for america and once america is out the whole thing might fall

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:57.760
apart like a big house of cards instead we want to fight the house of cards and treat the house

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.920
of cards as the real castle that needs storming you know the who

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.120
it is four and a half years later ladies and gentlemen and none of these people have helped us

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.840
that's the real bottom line none of these people have helped us i'm not i haven't been able to do

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:24.800
much either but what i've accomplished is actually in spite of all the interference

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:32.400
all the meddling and all the lying that people have done behind the scenes to confuse me to

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:39.600
distract me to get me to be worried about my reputation or my ego instead of worried about

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.680
teaching this biology as with a high fidelity and integrity as possible

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.800
and it's taken me four years to figure that out it's taken me four years to pull my head out of

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:57.840
that box and now it's i i really feel like my duty my i owe all of my supporters and i owe

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:06.880
all of my followers and i owe um my grandchildren um that i devote the rest of my life to fighting

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:15.840
this illusion that they started a long long long time ago and then turned up to 11 in 2020 and this

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.800
is this is with the amplifier set at 11 right now and your headphones at full blast

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:27.040
the prioritizing is the top the FDA told me it did review grenadiers application but it was incomplete

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.040
they also said they were balancing the need for tests with concerns about accuracy

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.000
major developments of global health emergency as the coronavirus reaches its 20th country in

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.880
seattle and around the world the clock was ticking coronavirus is now considered a global

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:50.640
health emergency and the u.s is warning people not to travel to China the WHO had declared a global

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.120
emergency and the cdc was beginning to screen passengers at u.s. airports including seattle

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.840
we are coordinating with the chinese government and working closely together i mean the university

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.600
of pittsburgh school of medicine told most people to stay home and only only essential people doing

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.520
essential experiments or essential essential work should come in and yet they still found the need

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.480
in that context where people actually work at a hospital or people have advanced degrees

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.600
in biomedical sciences they still felt they had the need to test people's forehead for their

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:32.560
temperature with a red light and put a sticker on their frickin badge every morning part of the

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.600
reason why i got asked not to come in anymore is because i told people that was stupid and i'm

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:42.880
riding a bike and i'm not going to come in the front door every day and use the shitty elevator

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.360
and walk through all those patients with my frickin bicycle i'm going through the garage

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.440
and the cargo elevator like i always do and i'll come downstairs and get my sticker after that

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.320
and sometimes they didn't come down and get my sticker and so then they were pissed

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:04.640
at least that was part of the reason they gave for the ignoring of the basic covid measures is

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:14.880
not tolerable oh great amazing times ladies and gentlemen amazing times 2020 was amazing

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:23.280
amazing times because they also activated a lot of people in 2020 a lot of people were

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:28.720
activated in 2020 people who knew too much in 2020 like the fear and cleavage site meant

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:36.400
labley should not have been first published by a guy whose dad works at Los Alamos or first

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:44.320
published by a guy who wrote a book called the genetic and environmental causes of autism with

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.960
children's health defense it should not be that person and and and those people rather had no

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.720
business knowing or thinking that a fear and cleavage site was an indication of something

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.400
like a lab leak none of their expertise belies that i had no idea what a fear and cleavage site was

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:09.600
nevermind a poly basic fear and cleavage site on a fusion protein in 2020 and i had been a

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.680
biologist my whole life in an academic biologist in the setting of a medical school for nearly 20

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.960
years because every university that i worked at was in the context of a medical school before that

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:28.000
more or less and at every university that i was at at some point i taught medical students

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:38.080
neurobiology so it's really interesting it's really interesting that uh in 2020 to think about

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:45.120
how many people were activated then and activated in a way that gave them a jumpstart and a special

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.560
place in the in the hierarchy of knowing or the hierarchy of dissidents

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:58.080
of course that's the reason why Robert Malone was elevated to the point and authority that he was

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:03.520
early on by Brett Weinstein because he claimed to have developed the technology that they were

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:12.080
now calling vaccines but somehow didn't have the the the semantic accuracy to call transfection

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:20.640
in June of 2021 when he finally decided to go public or rather they decided that it was time for him to

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:27.600
go public he didn't have the wherewithal to explain it and in fact he had the wherewithal instead to

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.000
lie about taking it and what did he say he said that he took it because he was going to travel

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.280
and because he heard rumors that it might help with his long covid which he had developed after

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.560
the super spreader event in boston where he also caught the covid for the first time

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:53.280
and so of course we know that on a tommy podcast um we find out how either forgetful

01:35:53.920 --> 01:36:01.920
Robert Malone is um or um how much of a liar he is because according to his travel buddy

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.640
Dave uh sorry uh Stephen Hatfield when they went to Rome together they were asked by Italian

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.760
authorities if they had their vaccine card and he and Robert Malone both laughed and did not have

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:20.000
a vaccine card so it seems unfortunate that if he was um taking the vaccine to travel that he

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
didn't bring a card with him to show that he had the vaccine and that that they had to joke about it

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.960
or that that they make fun of it um it doesn't sound like Hatfield said and you can go watch

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.880
that video for yourself it's Hatfield did not say that Robert Malone forgot his card and that

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.400
caused a great deal of stress when the Italian authorities asked him for it but rather he just

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:51.680
joked that wouldn't either of us had a card and so of course that doesn't jive with Robert Malone's

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.400
story and the only reason why stories don't jive is because it's very hard to keep lies straight

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.520
it is that's why that's why the truth of of Mark Twain's statement that you know I never tell a

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.880
lie because then I don't have to remember anything is exactly where we are these people are in the

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:16.400
mud themselves now we have gotten out of the Jeep and we are watching them in the Jeep grinding

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:23.200
the wheels and smoking the engine insisting that they are making progress and there are lots of

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:30.000
people that are still in the Jeep yelling at us saying yeah we're doing just fine don't divide us

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:39.440
few dividers there wasn't there were we are mud this is just fine it's going to be fine we're

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:47.120
going to get out of it in a minute don't divide us don't argue and they're still stuck in the

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.520
novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from that the main problem

01:37:51.520 --> 01:38:00.160
was that we rushed transfection it got it got contaminated and that's the lie and they're all

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:06.320
sticking to it and they have stuck to it since the very beginning remember it's a multifaceted cage

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.160
a multifaceted cognitive prison in the front his PBS NewsHour arguing about whether Trump

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:19.920
or Fauci are right and whether ventilators or shutdown or whatever and did we shut the borders

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:26.400
right or our masks required or should we shut down schools that stuff and another part of the

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.080
walls behind you where people are complaining already that it's a lab leak people like James

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.120
Wyler are writing blogs about the fear and cleavage site that they have no business knowing about

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:43.440
that Dan Saratkin whose dad works at Los Alamos is writing articles about gain of function viruses

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:50.160
and de attenuating vaccines that he has no business knowing anything about that Yuri Dagan somebody

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.480
who works on on longevity and stuff in Canada as a Russian also knows suddenly that the fear and

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:02.480
cleavage site is definitely indication of a lab leak and that all of these people spontaneously

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.360
assembled into a group called drastic on the internet that started to discover all kinds of

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:16.400
shit and then Tucker Carlson covered covered drastic a year later and said that Jamie Metzel

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:22.400
a known futurist and transhumanist who's spoken for the WEF are the people that started drastic

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.720
when it was me and Dan Saratkin and actually can only be one real person or fake person which

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:36.080
is Billy Bo Stickson the guy who started the Twitter group that became drastic all part of

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:44.160
an elaborate international globalist scheme to entrap us in a mythology about a gain of function

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:53.600
virus for which we were all vulnerable on the coronavirus outbreak in China relentless

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:59.200
president Trump was still not raising alarms though he banned foreign travelers from China

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.520
my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:11.920
but by that time flights from the outbreak zone had been landing at us airports for weeks flights

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:18.320
have been landing for weeks but nobody's dying isn't that so weird

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:27.520
the travel band may have bought us some time but in all actuality you know people were leaving

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.640
Wuhan going to Beijing traveling to western Europe and ultimately to the United States

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:39.440
in late 2019 and early 2020 anyway Chinese health officials said today another 46 people have

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.560
died from the coronavirus in those critical first weeks after the arrival of the virus in the US

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.960
administration officials and the president himself continued to insist that the risk was

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.240
small i want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in china but i want to emphasize

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.560
that the risk to the american public currently is low how concerned are you well we pretty much

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.760
shut it down coming in from China we've offered China help but we can't have

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:17.280
thousands of people coming in who may have this problem the coronavirus so we're going to see

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.280
what happens but we did shut it down yes that attitude didn't sit well with washington's senior

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:29.440
democratic senator patty murray she spoke to me from her home i felt like at the time i lived in

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.920
two different worlds i lived here in washington state where people were going oh my gosh

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.960
we have a problem and in washington d where they'd say oh you guys worry too much out the west coast

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:46.640
a tale of two washington's yeah we should have pulled out all the stops and checked everything

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:53.120
but it was more like oh you guys quit worrying out there there was a lot there it is again

01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:00.080
black cross isolation at providence hospital patient one was deteriorating he began developing

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:05.520
more shortness of breath is it wrong for me to say i don't find that an inspiring symbol if you're

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.600
going to take the christian cross and make it black and light it from the back i don't

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:17.040
it doesn't feel like the optimum i don't know i don't like that at all it's weird

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.840
and because of that we got an x-ray which looked like he had a developing pneumonia

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:29.200
his oxygen levels and his blood were also decreasing that worry dr dia that was an oxygen levels and

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:36.800
decreasing that worry dr dia's oxygen levels were decreasing reports out of wuhan

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.880
it appeared based on their data that once patients began developing pneumonia that many of them

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:50.480
end up in the icu one event later and die patient one was slipping fast and there was no known

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:57.520
treatment dr dia's told me he heard about an antiviral drug called remdesivir they are telling

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:03.760
a story actually that this guy wow that he was slipping away and that remdesivir actually

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:09.520
saved him which i don't remember this i just know that they used it on him i didn't know

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:16.640
that we were also told by pbs news hour that he was slipping away wow some experts thought

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.320
could potentially help it would be an experiment he said but the patient was willing

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.160
with that point i contacted the fda and gilly had the manufacturer to see if they would approve

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:34.320
it so the fda gave us an approval to try it on a compassionate use basis knowing that it had not

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:39.280
been approved yet and that there were no trials available to base that decision on we infused

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:45.120
but the domain server had already identified it as a as a main candidate so they did have

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.760
some good evidence because robert malone had created a a computer generated

01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:00.640
x-ray crystallography model of the three cl protease and then interfaced all known

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:08.320
pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals on the fda list with that x-ray crystallography model and

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:16.720
identified remdesivir flubox are silicoxib fomotidine and ivermectin

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:24.080
as things that could potentially help question and make sure you correct me if i'm wrong on any

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:30.960
of those four mark the next day he was still having very high fevers and still was requiring

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:37.040
oxygen the day that we gave it to him by the next day his fevers resolved and they stayed gone

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.960
he felt much better he felt like he had started beating the virus

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:49.280
no one knew if the drug had an impact or if the virus was taking its natural course here's the

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:55.360
thing you you have one data point here one person right in the world yeah in the world it is an

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.280
anecdote and so we were happy that the patient got better and and was ultimately continued

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.720
better able to go home so that part was fantastic for the patient

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.800
we knew that we needed to study this in a formal clinical trial

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:14.160
although patient one was well enough to be sent home

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.080
for public health officials in washington state there were many more questions to answer

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.840
they needed to find out who patient one might have come in contact with after returning from china

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:34.160
tracking trace warning warning tracking trace warning warning

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:42.160
and send samples from them to the cdc as well so we find contacts i'm not used to them

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:49.840
at least ten minutes of time talking face-to-face with we identified 60 plus contacts we swab

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:55.920
them multiple times to see was their transmission of this virus and we found absolutely no transfer

01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:14.960
amongst those contacts at this first case and washington's governor j

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.520
with the all of the contacts that the person had who was the first patient

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.360
and did everything epidemiologically that you could ask a public health system to do

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:35.040
but soon more signs of trouble began to appear across lake washington in the city of kirkland

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:42.320
at the life care skilled nursing and rehab center scott sada check had brought his 86-year-old father

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:49.520
there to recover from a bad fall he had his head hard enough that he had some brain trauma

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.920
and bleeding on the brain and he broke his right ankle and the bed that opened up was at life care

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:03.360
and so on february 20th we moved my dad to life care and then we started seeing some of the staff

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.960
wearing respiratory gear wearing face masks wearing gloves it's kind of like what's going on

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.120
inside life care residents had been getting sick with an unknown respiratory infection

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.760
the sickest were brought to the nearby evergreen health medical center

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.600
dr frances redo is the medical director of infection control here

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:34.640
remember this was flu season and we'd already had a peak of influenza b in december and now we

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:42.080
were going through the peak of influenza a and so the unit was full of individuals with severe

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:48.160
respiratory infections interesting statement background we're watching this these events

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.280
interesting statement there wasn't a lot of effort to differentiate where he was going through

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.480
influenza a and then influenza wow i want to play that one again just so you hear it right this was

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:05.200
flu season and we'd already had a peak of influenza b in december and now we were going

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:12.160
through the peak of influenza a and so the unit was full of individuals with severe

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:18.080
respiratory infections and in the meantime in the background we're watching this these events

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.880
unfold the flu disappeared that's incredible this is a really wonderful little piece with

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:32.000
increasing alarm uh not only in Wuhan and now spreading across the globe and wondering when

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.720
our turn was coming until that point federal guidelines for testing potential cases were very

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:45.200
narrow patients had to have been in a hot spot like china or in contact with someone infected

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:51.440
see so even the illusion of you know we don't have so many tests so we have to be very careful

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.040
about who we use them on created this illusion in these people's heads that well we might be

01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.400
missing stuff then and then people were talking about missing stuff and talking about asymptomatic

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:10.960
spread exactly as James Giordano explained in 2017 would be anybody wanting to destroy a country

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.360
by undermining its trust in its government would do it this way they would see the few cases

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.520
of people complaining or maybe even tell a story about a case and then rely on the internet to

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.560
spread the idea and then people would panic doctors would panic of course if there was a

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:35.760
coordinated messaging going on around the world between governments and coordinated control of

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:43.920
people like epigirl on social media or Brett Weinstein you could easily have doctors no matter

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.000
where they looked healthcare workers no matter where they look parents no matter where they

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.520
look teachers no matter where they looked and members of this bureaucracy no matter where they

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:59.920
looked they would see convincing evidence of a consensus that there definitely is a global crisis

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.760
unfolding and that New York City was the first page in a very terrible story to come

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:17.440
then the rules changed Dr. Rita wasted no time we settled on two individuals and we tested

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.600
them the following morning I had a regular day saw patients in clinic saw patients in the hospital

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:29.440
was sitting there as I usually do trying to complete my notes and received a call at 7 40 p.m.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:40.000
and both of the tests were positive what goes through your mind my initial honest response was

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.680
skepticism I thought the odds of both tests and two randomly selected individuals being positive

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:56.480
with no history of travel no history of exposure to anybody was fairly astronomical unless it was

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.920
a pre-existing background that your dumb ass never imagined

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.640
and I'm saying it with the utmost respect dumb ass because I was also a dumb ass I didn't get

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:12.320
there until May of 2020 it's still about 40 days out from saying it out loud in my head

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.320
it took me a long time because people were talking to me behind the scenes about how important it was

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:24.240
to oppose the no virus people and people like Andy Kaufman how important it was to oppose

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:29.040
people who thought it was 5g

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:38.160
this was a huge shift incident command was activated and we made a quick decision to test

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:42.400
nine additional people that night eight of those nine were positive

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.400
why I want to make sure everybody in the chat understands that in order to see through Robert

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:53.920
Malone you have to be pretty sophisticated it is very possible that there are lots of people who

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.120
can't see through Robert Malone like we can but you that have been here for a long time and have

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:03.680
been following me for more than a year or two years or some even following me for many years

01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:09.360
whether you like it or not the truth is is that together we've learned a lot of biology

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:15.280
clarified a lot of biological ideas to make it very easy for us to regularly put our heads back

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.320
in the box and then pull it out and have no ill effects but the people who don't pull their

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:24.960
head out have never pulled their head out of that box before it's hard to see

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:32.160
Robert Malone for who he is because he is a masterful orator because his wife and his

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:40.160
relationship that's schtick is well developed and because he is his schtick is coordinated

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:48.640
with other people many of the people that he says are in opposition to him are actually not

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.040
George Webb is not real opposition

01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:05.040
George Webb is as real as as as I don't know who else to tie in with him because I'm just

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.080
absolutely convinced that everybody that's been associated with him has been bamboozled by him

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:16.160
absorbed by him and he has taken what they do in their legitimate efforts to find the truth

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:23.280
and obfuscated it in his own work under the the hidden uh you know I'm promoting you kind of

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:29.520
thing oh yeah you're real smart but then he gets everything that you said wrong or he doesn't even

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:35.040
really say the name of your website or that's how he works and that's how a lot of these people work

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.800
and so my best estimation is is that a lot of these people are essentially connected through

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:48.800
Robert Malone and one of the best ways or lists to start with is the lists that Robert Malone

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.640
himself is made lists on his own subject that say these are the people that are the medlers that

01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:01.200
are messing with me that are trying to divide the resistance and are calling me a controlled up

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:06.320
and then who does he list there well I am on that list but I don't have any links

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:13.360
Mary Holland has links Katherine Watts or Katherine Austin Fitz has links

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.440
George Webb has multiple links including links to his 60 minutes episode

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.480
Sasha Latipova has links

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.960
all the people that are listed there basically have links to something that they're doing

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:29.680
except for me

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:41.200
and that's because he would rather have you work on George Webb or or decide whether Sasha Latipova

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:46.160
is good or bad because as long as you're worried about those people you're worried about people on

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:54.560
his team and running in wheels that he essentially directly or indirectly coordinates maybe even

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:59.440
funds because he has a wonderful wonderfully financially successful sub stack

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:08.960
I assure you that I'd be on almost every day for eight hours a day straight if I had 55,000 people

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:20.000
giving me five dollars a month and I would be celebrating the the fantastic opportunity I would

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.320
have to like fund other people like Mark Koolack or Jessica Hockett or or or start a new

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.240
news website where we where we promoted other people on this independent bright web

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.920
I mean that's what I would do with any extra money I had

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:46.960
I would create a day camp for kids and biology or or a summer camp for high schoolers or a

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:50.320
summer camp for college kids in the middle of Pennsylvania

01:55:52.160 --> 01:56:01.040
with archery and fire building and camping and immuno and immuno 101

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:10.080
what are these people doing with their extra money with their foundations what are they creating

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:15.120
what are they giving to the next generation not a whole hell of a lot it doesn't seem

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:22.560
Robert Malone is building more buildings on his on his plot of land at the foot of the Shenandoah

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:32.000
National Forest. Meryl Nash has decided after 10 years of of taking support from CHD has decided

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.520
to start her own non-profit because I guess the money is so good or something

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:46.960
to oppose the who not the vaccine schedule in America not to bring awareness to vaccine

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.920
injured kids not to do anything but oppose the who

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.240
because you know the main frontline warrior against the who should be an old lady who lives in Maine

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:13.040
Wow right kind of stunning actually isn't it it was and within the first five days we had 32

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:21.760
positives many were from life care but crucially some had no connection to the nursing home

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:28.560
we then knew that this was a much bigger outbreak than you could have imagined

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.960
at least 41 life care residents and two visitors would eventually die with more than a hundred

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.640
others linked to the home testing positive including Scott's son the check's father Chuck

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.720
he has never shown symptoms so how worried are you that symptoms might appear

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:56.800
extraordinarily because we don't know this is new it's uncharted waters the southern check story

01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:05.520
hit home for me my 84 year old father is in assisted living in Florida hello there you tilt down a

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:11.520
little bit i'm sorry what tilt down tilt down a little more down there you go that's good how

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:18.320
you feeling well i'm fine how are you no coronavirus so far there's the there's the coronavirus map in

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:24.880
the background that uh is hilarious apparently John Cullen invented the code that underlies that

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.040
claim the fame are but he's pretty much an isolation no visitors allowed

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.520
it's the same in life care but the southern checks have found a way around that my sister's here and

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:44.080
we'll go up and we'll say hi through the window we've got a big white board today so we can actually

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:50.640
write notes for them because they're dumb that is absolutely vomitous and it was part of the illusion

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:56.560
that they had to separate old people from their lifelong mates their love they had to die alone

01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:03.120
and it started with this bullshit right here make no mistake about it double pain windows to

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:09.920
seal the noise can you hear us you idiots

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.280
okay well not your finish yeah keep getting better keep listening to the nursing staff

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:27.120
they're looking out for he has to get the love from the family to get better without it he will

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:34.080
become not just physically but mentally yeah it's the worst thing you can do to an older person right

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:40.320
yeah the worst thing you can do so we'll do it anyway so we'll do it and laugh about it

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:47.600
somebody slapped this guy upside the head at this time we might have not had been where we are now

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:53.440
Scott himself also got the virus unlike his dad he got sick

01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:03.200
I was hospitalized through the emergency room with the full-blown list of symptoms extraordinary

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:10.800
difficulty breathing lightheaded dizziness you name the symptom I had it what was it like being

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:16.800
in isolation sick with this disease were you scared hell yes I was scared it's an unknown

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:24.480
I was hooked up to an IV and they started an albuterol nebulizer which they had to give two full

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:30.400
rounds of it which was something that they made fun of trump by saying that they were inhaling bleach

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.560
but after those two full rounds I was breathing normally and after six hours they had all my

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:43.360
symptoms under control within 12 hours they moved me to a full isolation unit and 10 hours later

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:52.960
they released me with zero symptoms so no remdesivir interesting I guess he just got albuterol

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.800
or whatever it's called but the number of coronavirus cases at home and abroad continue to climb the

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:03.680
financial markets rocked and more aggressive steps to fight by this time in early march

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:11.760
covid 19 cases were multiplying here and around the country here we go here comes new york governor

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.040
insley had put washington under a state of emergency state has declared a state of the first governor

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:24.880
to do so but like many here he was increasingly concerned that president trump was continuing

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.840
to downplay the threat it's gonna all work out everybody has to be calm it's all going to work

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:35.920
insley a democrat and former presidential candidate tweeted that the administration should stick to

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:44.240
science and tell the truth it would ignite an escalating war of words during a visit to the

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:51.200
cdc trump fired back because that governor is a snake okay uh insley let me just tell you we

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.560
have a lot of problems with the governor and the governor of washington that's we have many of

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.960
your problems i said no matter how nice you are he's no good that's the way i feel uh at that point

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:08.720
did you get the sense that you as governor and the state of washington were sort of on their

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:18.000
own and the the federal cavalry was not coming uh yes but but we did never depend on that leadership

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.720
coming out of the white house so it's not something that we were surprised by uh we always knew that

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:29.120
we would have to lead the charge given the the president's reluctance to uh to really exercise

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.680
leadership on this and we sort of knew that he had an intent that uh of downplaying what was

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:42.640
an emerging problem that uh you know could only be explained by someone who had their eye on the

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:49.440
on the doubt jones rather than eye on the epidemiological curves seattle's mayor jenny dirken

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:55.440
shared those sentiments we are not going to be distracted by any rhetoric that the president or

02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:01.040
anyone else uses we've got to act we got to act to protect the people and i think those actions

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.600
are what matters facts and science got to rely on them that's the only thing that's going to get

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.600
us through this uh and fortunately we've got a really vibrant health and science community here

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:18.000
in the state of washington in seattle and we listen to them she and other political leaders here

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.040
had some hard decisions to make after hearing grim predictions we had researchers here telling

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:31.040
us that within six weeks we would have over 70,000 positive cases and hundreds of deaths

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:37.040
if we didn't act and so we heard a choice to make the choice was know that you're going to have

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.880
enormous pain in shutting down parts of your economy and this is actually right right this is

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:50.320
generated by the illusion that was created in new york make no mistake about it this idea of

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:56.880
projecting 80,000 people that that projection only works if they believe what's occurring in

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.480
new york city at this time make no mistake about it that's the reason why they want you to ignore

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.480
jessica hocket why they want you to ignore the very simple observations that she's made and her

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:13.920
friend is made that these these things are not natural these curves are not natural these numbers

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:19.600
are not natural and they need to be substantiated because these very unnatural numbers were used

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.680
to create the illusion of impending doom the worst case scenario being a novel virus going

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:36.160
endemic or have those same impacts later and overrun your health system as we move forward

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:43.440
it will be increasingly necessary and important that we are unified in our efforts seattle was

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:49.760
starting on a trajectory that the rest of the country would soon follow there is no magic

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:56.480
silver bullet at the moment medically but there is a very successful uh effort that we can take

02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:02.320
to slow the spread of this disease and that's to reduce the social interactions that are

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:09.040
not necessary in our lives you the county executive and the governor uh were early out of the box on

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:15.920
taking these actions pretty proactive uh did you feel at the time um a little nervous about all

02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:23.600
that i think it was all of us felt a great deal of sense of obligation and concern because we were

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:30.960
the first to go mayor dirken actually had a pandemic response plan on the shelf which she and her

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.240
cabinet had updated in early february we pulled out the pandemic planning and knew that one of the

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.720
first things we had to do to separate people from another's have them telecommute those that could

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:47.200
so our largest employers acted immediately that included seattle icon microsoft

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:52.960
with a workforce of more than 50 000 one of the largest private sector employers in the region

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.640
so we had a call on sunday afternoon march first we had the business leaders from the

02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:04.720
microsoft president brad smith spoke to me from his home so we went from monday telling people

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:11.520
they should work from home if they were more comfortable tuesday telling people you know feel

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:16.960
free to work from home it might be better to wednesday work from home unless it's essential

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:22.800
you come to work the decision you made was a big one did you hesitate no it was interesting

02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:29.680
once we decided at microsoft that we would be decisive and base our decisions on public health

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:36.320
advice then we knew what to do it's the hardest decision i've ever had to make

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:42.640
because all of our instincts are to grow the whole economy for your city to make a stronger

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:47.680
community for everyone and what we're saying is we got to stop that kind of community and we have

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:59.520
to stop doing work almost overnight the vibrant city shut down businesses closed

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:08.080
storefronts boarded up did you have my chair did it have chain mail on it because this is a real

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:13.280
chain mail hood right here if i put this on i can go into battle yeah that's what that's for

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.360
the famous hight place market nearly deserted

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:27.360
at a local soccer field usually filled with kids and families preparations for a surge of

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.560
covid patients yeah we got to build those tips we knew already then one of the biggest challenges

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:39.680
would be having the hospital system overwhelmed by way we knew already we were trying to figure

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:47.920
out how we could get testing or trying to figure out how we could get testing we're trying to figure

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:53.360
out it's not silly though because what they want you to do is to subtly see that the divide about

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:58.800
the understanding and the acceptance of the science and the acceptance of the inevitability

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:05.520
the divide actually occurs right there it's right there on the on the the red blue line in

02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:13.200
america it's pretty impressive and they're going over the house all the time now i think i'm

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:20.160
being watched whether we would receive material help in the form of field hospitals or or

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:29.760
large facilities encampments for people who were unhoused and there wasn't a lot of concrete offers

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.280
of help coming from the federal government so we were left with the reality that we're going

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:40.720
to have to take on a lot of this ourselves more than 140 people lost their lives yesterday

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:47.760
bringing the desk toll to over 590 in this country nice red nice red america there boy that's pretty

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:55.200
shitty can't get much worse than that can it huh lost their lives yesterday bringing the desk toll

02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:00.720
to over 590 in this country that he's not doing everything he can do as coronavirus was sweeping

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:05.920
the country throughout march and i can't tell you how frustrating it is so was the frustration

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.760
among governors scrambling for resources they needed to respond we're bidding against one another

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:20.720
it's really not a great bidding against one another for tests and response stuff like this was all

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:27.680
manufactured all manufactured shortage all manufactured drama

02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:36.320
unbelievable unbelievable the states are are taking action to try to find these things on our own

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:43.680
the president was now feuding with multiple governors 400 ventilators i need 30 000 ventilators

02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:49.920
and like he'd done with the virus in the beginning i don't believe you need 40 000 or 30 000 ventilators

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:55.360
he disputed there was a scarcity of crucial medical equipment like masks and ventilators

02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.000
many of the states are stocked up that's impressive some of them don't admit it but they

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.200
have 30 000 ventilators things that would have been a ventilator for everybody they killed in those

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.640
five weeks the feuding doctors and nurses have struggled to get the personal protective equipment

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:17.280
ppe they need good morning and welcome everyone in seattle that's been the top issue for dr

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:24.240
ame Compton phillips the chief clinical officer of the providence hospital network last year across

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:31.120
all of providence we used 250 000 masks in the first three months of this at Everett they've used

02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:37.600
250 000 masks we cannot have our own caregivers going down from covid while they're trying to take

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:41.600
care of the community because you know the supply chain is just not keeping up with our needs

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:49.440
and ame i have to say if i can't assure them that they're safe then i don't think the rest of this

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:58.320
is worth anything inside providence's emergency department tensions around ppe have been high

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:06.000
dr ryan k is the department's medical director it's exhausting to constantly think about the

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.200
sequence that you put things on and take things off and where you're sanitizing during that sequence

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.840
see that's all that's all part of the i don't know if you can yeah you can still hear me i wasn't monitoring

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:24.320
that that's all part of the the illusion right that's they they are told that they have to pay

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.520
attention to all these details and they have to pay attention to all these protocols and and

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.960
question whether they're doing things right and so they focus their attention right their attention

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.840
is focused on something that doesn't doesn't help them solve the problems in front of them

02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:45.120
every nurse except the problem in front of me has said i've been working for years and i've

02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:50.720
never been so exhausted and it leaves people just on edge all the time

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.600
we have enough at 95 masks that people should not have to be able

02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.000
and should not have to bring in their own masks at this point in time

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:04.800
is this is a recommendation still one and 95 for five patients are we using these all shift now

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.040
we're using them with a face shield for as long as you need to use them you just store them in

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.680
a paper bag until they become moist or soiled okay so forever well not forever

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.680
reusing masks and storing them in paper bags wasn't the only diy work around i saw

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.600
i caught up with dr. Compton Phillips at the otherwise vacant providence headquarters

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:34.000
inside a large meeting room she and a handful of her team were spread out a safe distance

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.760
cranking out face shields our caregivers would know you know who else was making

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:46.800
protective goggles on i think kevin mccarron had his uh his wife making face masks and actually

02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:51.200
encouraged people in march of 2020 to make face masks because at least it's doing something

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:59.680
um bret Weinstein was saying that he was wearing goggles and a bandana when he went out because you

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:08.160
know bush meat and a surgical mask underneath this and then this goes in front and basically

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:14.560
protects against droplets they had rated a half dozen craft stores to scrounge up supplies

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.480
we're at 288 now we're going to get to a thousand by tomorrow wow good for them resources going

02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:26.640
into war against covid i feel like rosy the riveter 499 500

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:35.600
and what does this exercise do it creates an illusion of consensus inside of their own head

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:40.320
that's agreed with by all the people in the room that we're doing what needs to be done we're doing

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:47.040
it right we're trying our best we're helping out it's also what happens when people protest

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:52.000
together they think well obviously i'm not wrong then look at all these people around me who agree

02:13:54.160 --> 02:14:01.360
this enchantment is amazing and we have to pull our kids out of it on the one hand this is really

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.480
it's kind of heartwarming but it's also really sad desperation yeah i can't i can't decide which

02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.600
way to go in this what are your thoughts i would rather offer our caregivers something than nothing

02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.960
and at the moment you know if the choice is not having ppe or having homemade people

02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:28.000
we're gonna offer them homemade ppe that's what motivated jeff cause his small family business

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:35.200
builds and sows furniture for aviation and retail customers he decided to pitch in and start making

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:41.840
masks it's not a shortage of the raw materials at least that would be well not yet there will be

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.360
yeah there will be yeah so i think we have enough to make two million masks but how long would that

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:50.240
take you to do well depends on how fast we want to go how fast do you want to solve the problem

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:58.080
my assumption is that we'll be ramping up for several weeks and then drop off a cliff nobody will

02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.320
meet me in the health care business anymore and then survival becomes a question for my company

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:07.360
so that's probably the next so he's really doing it all for the for the good cause he's

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:13.360
gonna throw it all at it and when when it's over it's over right wow what a that's amazing again

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:18.080
this is an unwitting participant i'm not saying he's a winning participant he sees that it's only

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:23.200
going to be for a little while because that makes sense to his common sensical mind this pet couldn't

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:30.880
possibly last until 2024 where there would be college kids still wearing masks that would be

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:36.880
impossible that would be crazy scary thing which is less scary than what our health care

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:43.440
friends are going to right now that's a bigger issue for me holy shit we knew in january what we

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:50.160
would need we knew we would need gloves and masks and respirators and ventilators two and a half

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:58.480
months later we're dependent on sewing circles to supply our front line heroes with what they need

02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:06.560
it may be a nice american story i find it pathetic i do too watch let's go back to the desk for a

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:13.600
second here um let me just show you okay this mask which is branded

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:21.280
which is branded conselmer right that's the company that makes instruments and shit

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:29.120
and and music books and music stands it's got little rubber thingies it's double layered

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:37.120
it's got this little mouth hole in it it's got a little separate you know tag for the person that

02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:48.960
made it here united sound so how long did it go on it wasn't just homemade masks for a few weeks

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.000
it wasn't just some guy starting a company because he knew the world needed it and

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.920
knew it wouldn't be for very long but what are you going to do we got to save the world right

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.400
that guy certainly didn't sound like it was an opportunity that was going to be there for

02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:15.520
2024 where he could be selling masks with that say uh hail pit on him but those masks exist now

02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:23.120
you can still buy them now it's it's really wonderful it's really wonderful what they did

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:30.960
to us and when you see it in in clear clarity um it is it is really frightening actually um

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:39.360
actually frightening uschington state officials like others in the country say this was an avoidable

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:46.720
crisis because we've lacked the federal leadership we needed it's been mayor versus mayor city versus

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:52.800
city state versus state trying to get access to the limited resources to protect our communities

02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:58.560
whether it's ventilators or masks for our health care workers all of that has become this hunger

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:03.920
games process where everyone's trying to figure out a way to outfit each other washington state had

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:09.760
a line on masks that were coming to the country you can look in the spars pandemic document to

02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:18.080
find similar tales of shortage and response to it and all of the nefarious things that would happen

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.800
when such a shortage was created you know what's really crazy is that at the University of

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:28.640
Pittsburgh there was this guy who was like one of the head engineers at the at the hospital or at

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:35.680
the university medical center and he decided to steal like fifteen thousand dollars worth of

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:42.320
masks and sell them on ebay and got caught I mean that's the kind of shit that was going on in

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:48.320
america that's the kind of people they the kind of human behavior they were motivating with this

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:57.840
kind of rhetoric entry in at the port in california suddenly multiple states were bidding on them

02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:03.200
that shouldn't be the way that it happens we're searching the world for every potential

02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:09.040
warehouse that of any of this personal protective equipment that has been a constant struggle and

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:14.000
we are bidding against each other and i'm sure that the suppliers are having a field day

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.440
bidding the price up while states are bidding against one another would be much more efficient

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:24.000
economically and otherwise if the federal government was playing a more vigorous role

02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:31.280
in that regard the tensions between states and the federal government have been escalating

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:36.480
another five million americans filed for unemployment benefits last week and that would

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.680
not just over the response to the outbreak down ten percent in relatively short order and there's

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:46.640
a lot of bad news but now over what it will take to get the country up and running again

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:53.440
meltdown on a national war jobs lost in a matter of two weeks and in the entire 18 months

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:59.920
our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war

02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:08.080
which we're calling opening up america again the president has been pushing governors to reopen

02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:14.800
soon even as soon as may first country has to get opened and so of course the magic trick here is

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:20.240
they know they've already created this psychological trap where half of the country can't listen to

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:28.400
this guy without going and so would no matter what he said here no matter how realistic or how

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:34.240
obvious it was no matter how common sensical it was because they had him saying it half the

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:42.960
country was just going to go and they've pulled similar tricks with similar people like uh

02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:50.560
tucker Carlson has that effect on some people like uh Glenn Beck has that effect on some people

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:56.720
Alex Jones has that effect Tim Poole has that effect Sam Cedar has that effect Brett Weinstein

02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:05.520
has that effect it's either you love him or and that makes them the perfect tool for creating this

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:15.120
multifaceted fifth generation controlled demolition of all that freedom represents and sovereignty

02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:24.000
is defined as in the west that's why somebody like me who's got a multiracial background who's a

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:30.880
Christian recovering catholic somebody who who was in academia long enough to know what's broken

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:37.280
with it somebody who has been right from the very beginning basically not even knowing why at first

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:45.360
is still lounging around uh langling around or whatever the right word is languishing is the

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:53.280
word i was looking for languishing around on twitch with less than 4 000 followers after four years

02:21:53.280 --> 02:22:02.160
and anybody that's been following me for more than a little while knows that our message is

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:08.720
good enough for it to be farther than that by now our message has been succinct enough to have gone

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:14.720
farther than that by now our message has been heard by enough of the people that are in this

02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:20.640
narrative to know that it should have been gone gone a lot farther by now but it hasn't it's been

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:27.280
lost in the cacophony of repeatedly amplifying robert malone for three or four podcasts a day

02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:31.360
at one point he was doing up to nine podcasts a day

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:42.240
nobody's asking for jonathan cooey to come on their show everybody wants sashila tepova everybody

02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:47.600
wants robert malone everybody wants piare cori everybody wants these people who've already done

02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:53.360
the circuit have already sold their book and haven't evolved or moved on in their message at

02:22:53.360 --> 02:23:01.520
all other than health freedom and stuff only peter mcculler has really progressed in his message to

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:06.800
the point where he's able to succinctly say that i think the vaccine schedule is frickin criminal

02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:11.200
and you if i was a parent i wouldn't use it i wouldn't engage in it

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:17.840
think about that for a second because that's real

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:26.720
and it will get open and it'll get open safely and hopefully quickly but some of them have been

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:32.720
pushing back we cannot be guided by emotion we need to be guided by where the facts on the ground

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:39.040
science and public health take us what's best for the people of illinois their safety and health

02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:45.120
and listening to the scientists and the doctors because if you do it wrong it can backfire and many

02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:52.240
like insley say it will come down to one thing mass testing this is the number one challenge for

02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:58.880
the united states right now is we need a huge ramp up of our testing capacity even greater than

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:06.000
was needed early in the outbreak to increase testing insley says trump needs to order us industry to

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.960
help using the defense production act which the president has only just begun to do

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.480
we need the president to help ignite a national mobilization of the manufacturing base

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:21.200
of the united states that is absolutely imperative so that we can restart our economy

02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.760
but president trump has also thrown this back on the states the governor is responsible they

02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:35.040
have to take charge they have to do a great job there are limits to what a state can do though

02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:41.280
as i saw at washington's health department laboratory they can only complete about 300

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:48.480
tests a day and that requires a mad scramble the raw materials for test kits are hard to come by

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:54.800
we have a lot of testing lab capability but we don't have the equipment to swab everybody's nose

02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:00.400
i think the current status in washington state wow it's weird because i'm working on

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:06.800
helping someone with a case on the west coast with a testing facility that opened up in april

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:19.840
and they had four machines called quant studio 12 which is a what essentially could be a core

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:26.400
facility machine at a university that can do all kinds of sort of preconceived program

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:36.400
preconceived experiments on full genome sequencing disease land disease marker screens all this

02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:44.080
kind of stuff and do you know 486 well experiments and this company on the west coast was able to

02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:55.040
source materials that worked in this machine from a company called bgi in in china and get that

02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:02.320
protocol approved in april of 2020 and presumably with these four machines they were able to sequence

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:08.240
hundreds and hundreds of people per day to test hundreds and hundreds of people per day

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:15.040
using a protocol provided by a chinese company one of the largest foreign collaborators in the

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:21.840
human genome project bgi beijing genetics something something i don't know maybe whatever it is you

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:31.120
can look it up why is a chinese company providing the testing materials for a testing facility on

02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:39.200
the west coast that was testing a major metropolitan areas municipal employees including their police

02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:47.840
weekly why was that company able to source four gigantic machines and the

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:56.160
materials to use them as a coronavirus testing methodology get that approved by the fda and

02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:02.640
presumably be able to test all the employees of this city every week where these people in

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:08.320
in seattle that were supposed in a all prepared so they they could test the first

02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:15.120
lucky enough they had already run a drill but these people only had the facility to test 300

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:25.760
people a day that's amazing actually is limited by the supplies to actually run the test

02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:32.880
they also don't have enough ppe for the health care worker 40 000 tests in new york city but they

02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:40.080
could only do 300 a day there jess come on now i mean don't get excited if there's too much

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.640
in congruency it can't possibly be a crime it's administering the tests if we don't have enough

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:53.920
gowns gloves masks to treat patients how are we going to prioritize a gown a glove and a mask to

02:27:53.920 --> 02:28:00.080
swap somebody because that is the requirement the state health department is actually got to have

02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.880
a gown on to do that shit so you need you know that's a problem we can't test everybody if we

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:09.840
don't have the ppe to test them i mean that is such an amazing story

02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:14.480
and alone and struggling to meet the demand we can't have that level across contamination

02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:18.560
after getting approval for his test from the fda

02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:24.560
alex screninger has dramatically ramped up testing at the university of washington school of medicine

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:29.760
virology so they're doing covid testing in there from patient samples and they're trusting the

02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:34.560
hoods alone to protect them because they're not wearing masks even though there's potentially

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:40.160
more virus in this room than there is anywhere else in america for in-patients health care workers

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:46.960
to test these people you have to wear all the ppe but you know if we're working on the samples

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.360
in masks well we don't need to do anything we can just breathe all we want and nothing's coming

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:59.680
out of me holy shit is this incredible can you believe this usually with populations but mostly

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:03.600
in-patients people who need supportive care we got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:08.640
the use of protective yes on this day they completed about three thousand tests

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.360
to get three thousand four thousand five thousand specimens a day you know it takes

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:18.400
it takes a lot of five thousand specimens a day are going through that room but he can stand

02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.120
there without ppe on and without a mask and it's all fine because you know negative flowhoods are

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:29.600
really good and they prevent all possible transmission and we couldn't contaminate it any samples

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:37.200
because remember how a negative flowhood works if they're doing it that way holy shit if they're

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:42.880
doing it that way then the person sits in front of the hood and the hood is like this and it's got

02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:51.440
this window drawn down and they're reaching in here to work on stuff and so if this is a negative

02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:59.360
flowhood then it would be flowing out right and if it's a positive flowhood it's gonna flow in

02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:03.360
and I might have those wrong but the one that you work on when you're working on a virus is

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:07.520
you work on the flow in because you don't want any of the virus that you're working on to get out

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:15.600
and if you're using a flow in hood without a mask on what are you doing in the world of

02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:20.480
coronaviruses and respiratory diseases that are aerosolized holy shit

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:26.960
and if you're working on a negative flowhood where it's going out like this

02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:35.440
because what you don't want to contaminate these samples with unclean air then that means you're

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.320
opening and testing all these samples while you breathe everything that blows out of the hood so

02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:50.320
either way this doesn't make any sense and in fact when I used to work at an operating room and load

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:58.480
IVs as a pharmacy technician using a negative flowhood and it was flowing in we had to wear

02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:06.800
a mask and there was no coronavirus back in the 90s we just wore a mask because this stuff was

02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:13.840
going to be sent into the operating room and we were working in the operating room and you wear

02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:20.240
masks in the operating room so you don't cough on shit and breathe on shit and when you talk you

02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:31.840
don't spit on shit and you use a negative flowhood so you can't do it either so it's one or the other

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:38.560
right you see the problem here and neither of those these possibilities is being respected in this

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:45.280
video it's like a joke to me either these things are full of samples and they're blowing out into

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:50.800
the room and so you're relying on everybody to keep it very freaking clean in there and open those

02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:57.920
things with very very high precision or the deadliest virus in recent human memory is going to get out

02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:06.720
or it's a flowing in and then what are all these people doing to these these samples aren't they

02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:13.440
contaminating them and of course they're going to be molecular biologists on here who are going

02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:17.600
to say oh yeah but you know that or this or that you got that wrong no i'm just pointing out the

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:23.200
incongruency here i'm pointing out the incongruency of the people walking around in this room none of

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:30.880
them having masks on yet sir it's supposedly doing tests in here and supposedly it's asymptomatically

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:36.880
spreading do they test themselves every day before they get in here with the potential of

02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:44.320
contaminating a sample or a hundred are they even thinking about that possibility seeing as they

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:49.040
don't really understand how this RNA works and how it could be so infectious you think they would

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:56.160
err on the side of caution they were making glam for inpatients health care workers

02:32:56.800 --> 02:33:00.800
it's usually a population but mostly inpatients people who need supportive care we got to get

02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:05.200
that fast turnaround time that reduces the use i'm sure i have the negative and positive mixed up i

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:11.600
don't care i'm not a i'm not a technician with regard to with regard to material safety in a

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:17.680
laboratory i just took the course and and passed the web exam but when you're using a hood like this

02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:23.920
and and that hood is there there are two strategies and whatever strategy they're using it doesn't

02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:28.880
make sense with regard to how these people are dressed and how they're behaving if indeed we

02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:33.760
believe the first half hour which said that this is a deadly pandemic that's going around the earth

02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:40.000
that we have to do everything to stop and now we're getting three thousand samples a day into this

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.960
room but all these people don't treat it like they are in the heart of the beast they treat it

02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:50.560
like they're just any other molecular biology experiment virology lab for inpatients health

02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:55.680
care workers is usually a population but mostly inpatients people who need supportive care we

02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:01.200
got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces the use of protective yes on this day they completed

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:06.960
about three thousand tests to get three thousand four thousand five thousand specimens a day

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:12.640
you know it takes it takes a lot of focus just like in the state lab greneter says it is difficult

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:18.720
to get the raw materials he needs one of the hardest things to find the single what do i miss

02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:22.960
will use plastic tips that contain the chemicals and the specimens

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:31.520
some automated pipetteers use four tips a test and others use three and some can use 400 and some

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:37.440
you know or 10 or 20 i mean they can have many wells and so where are these things coming from

02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:47.440
who's producing them who's checking their their quality you see you see um and so just getting

02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:55.280
the tips into your facility so we can run that many tests this is what we're looking for basically

02:34:55.280 --> 02:35:01.120
we tweeted at rosh and the world to get these things in yeah like you would tweet like deltid

02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:07.200
lost your bag or something like that right i mean we have two people whose entire job right now is

02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:13.040
to manage our FedEx shipments basically we blow up our hallway and it goes down to a single so the

02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:18.560
problem they're solving is a shortage that was a illusion of consensus that a shortage existed

02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.600
a illusion of consensus that they needed more like 30,000 ventilators was a shortage that they were

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:29.680
a shortfall number and so they're asking the wrong questions and they're fighting the wrong

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:34.880
battles and they're solving the wrong problems because all of the questions they ask all the

02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:41.200
problems that they solve and all the arguments that they have all accept the novel virus that has

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:47.680
the potential to be a worst-case scenario a file and then it takes over the next six to eight hours

02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:52.320
we're able to actually move those boxes into our local warehouses we've bought other space here

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:58.400
in the building it's a supply chain has been really the number one thing we do despite the

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:06.000
problems they're still managing to return results the same day in many cases this is crucial to keep

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:12.000
up with a fascinating virus and help health care workers on the front lines reduce their

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.920
i'm going to leave the last uh some minutes for you guys to find and i might watch the rest of

02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:24.480
it i think we've made a lot of points here already i'll watch it um and figure it out uh i need to

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:32.960
skedaddle um because oh i forgot to cut um that's how we do that uh i need to skedaddle

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:40.880
because um i'm gonna help my wife live stream her class now um and uh if necessary i think i

02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:45.920
will be on later to cover the last little bit of this if something incredible is in the back you

02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:51.920
know like if rubber balloon shows up in the last uh 20 minutes of this then i'll let you know um i

02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:56.640
think we see already what we thought we would see i think we've made a really good point about it

02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:02.400
um i do really think that this pandemic was created um by seeding a gain of function

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:07.760
narrative before the pandemic seeding the potential before the pandemic and then during the pandemic

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:14.800
cashing in on that already accepted potential and accepted um existence in these in these groups

02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:20.960
in these peoples in these in these selected hospitals and locations and then that story was

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.880
misconstrued for national security reasons to make sure that everybody

02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:31.920
conformed um with the mythology and so teamwork's case scenario was very important in convincing us

02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:38.240
that there was a dangerous novel virus a strange new um thing but there i don't believe that there

02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:44.720
actually was um and if there was it was likely deployed was it a a toxin in some places and a

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.200
clone in other places i don't know because it's a crime and i'm just calling the cops i know for

02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:52.880
sure that they're trying to invert the sovereignty of our children so that they can use them as

02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:58.480
test animals ladies and gentlemen this has been giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise

02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:03.840
information brief brought to you by a biologist thank you very much for joining me um and you can

02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:09.360
see me again tomorrow at 10 10 i'll try to be early thanks uh guys um i love you very much

02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:33.120
thank you

02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200
See you!
