00:58.860 --> 01:02.024
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:02.504 --> 01:04.286
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:06.308 --> 01:07.069
Isolation, what was it?

01:07.230 --> 01:08.411
Isolation and purification.

01:10.153 --> 01:10.874
Of the virus?

01:10.974 --> 01:11.174
Yes.

01:12.435 --> 01:14.197
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:20.982 --> 01:23.464
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:24.125 --> 01:28.989
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.511
I don't understand what the issue.

01:31.531 --> 01:31.711
I see.

01:31.731 --> 01:33.293
No, it depends on how they use it.

01:46.445 --> 01:48.387
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:48.467 --> 01:50.308
I mean, he actually isolated it.

01:50.568 --> 01:54.512
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:54.572 --> 01:56.633
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:02.378 --> 02:07.983
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:08.643 --> 02:20.891
you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

02:21.171 --> 02:25.294
It's just a big hassle in the end, but no one,

02:26.274 --> 02:39.484
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

02:39.544 --> 02:42.046
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

02:49.468 --> 02:51.989
just it's literally turning into a worst-case scenario.

02:52.009 --> 02:54.950
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

02:54.970 --> 02:57.791
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.391
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:00.411 --> 03:02.892
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:02.912 --> 03:04.953
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.533
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.894
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:09.914 --> 03:12.495
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:12.535 --> 03:15.756
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:16.653 --> 03:35.165
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

03:35.185 --> 03:44.751
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

03:46.969 --> 03:48.510
I think truth is good for kids.

03:48.950 --> 03:52.791
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

03:53.231 --> 03:54.892
We want everybody to feel good.

03:55.012 --> 03:57.252
That's not, that's not the way life is.

03:59.753 --> 04:03.674
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:05.475 --> 04:06.195
And I have lied.

04:06.215 --> 04:07.255
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:07.275 --> 04:08.196
I don't want to lie.

04:08.676 --> 04:10.036
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:10.136 --> 04:11.157
I try not to be a liar.

04:11.197 --> 04:12.057
I don't want to be a liar.

04:12.617 --> 04:15.338
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:17.638 --> 04:19.138
I don't care how you get there.

04:19.158 --> 04:22.039
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:22.379 --> 04:23.279
The goal is to win.

04:48.625 --> 04:49.386
Yeah.

05:17.244 --> 05:17.544
Yeah.

06:25.456 --> 06:25.937
Yeah.

07:34.801 --> 07:41.605
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

07:42.186 --> 07:48.730
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal, and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

07:49.430 --> 07:50.811
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:50.831 --> 07:55.754
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:56.334 --> 07:57.315
My name is Jonathan Couey.

07:57.355 --> 07:59.536
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage.

07:59.616 --> 08:03.239
This is, again, one of the only places where you can find

08:04.219 --> 08:09.664
someone scrambling for the opening of the trap, trying to help everyone get out.

08:10.685 --> 08:17.231
This stream is made possible by the people on the left there and a few who are not on that list.

08:17.891 --> 08:20.914
Thank you very much to all of those people who make this possible.

08:22.796 --> 08:29.802
We are again trying to pass on a new interpretation of our biology, a new interpretation of

08:30.731 --> 08:35.256
the irreducible complexity that is the natural world around us.

08:36.117 --> 08:49.553
We're trying to take back the mystery of life and trying to extricate ourselves as adults from what I have come to understand as a very, very large mythology.

08:50.854 --> 09:00.766
that actually edifies all of modern academic biology, and that mythology can essentially be distilled to three words, evolution because DNA.

09:01.827 --> 09:03.509
I think that there is a way out.

09:03.589 --> 09:07.693
I think that there is a way out by using very succinct language to challenge people's

09:08.274 --> 09:09.815
presuppositions about things.

09:10.615 --> 09:16.019
An example of that might be intramuscular injection is the single worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

09:16.539 --> 09:26.205
That might get biologists as well as, you know, parents and doctors and even gas station attendants to think differently about what they know about intramuscular injection.

09:26.605 --> 09:33.009
And that is my goal with this stream every day to try and find new ways to snap people out of the enchantment that we've been placed in.

09:33.850 --> 09:40.868
And it is important for me now at the beginning of the stream to try and articulate what we're really trying to do here.

09:43.601 --> 10:10.541
We are trying to present a new model of how to understand the world so that people can re-evaluate their experiences, their observations, and what they think they understand about themselves and their health, as well as the history of the United States in a different context, in the idea of them using biology and medicine and

10:12.435 --> 10:28.080
and how we understand ourselves to be as a way of undermining our spirituality, as a way of undermining our connection to God and creation, as a way of undermining our idea of the sovereignty of the individual.

10:28.920 --> 10:38.423
All of these things are being collectively accomplished by bamboozling us about our biology and making us believe that evolution is real because we found DNA.

10:39.909 --> 10:51.721
And I think that we can save our children from this mythology and save our children from being enslaved by it by teaching them a new way of seeing themselves and their place in nature.

10:52.402 --> 11:01.652
And that is by seeing life on earth and life anywhere else in the universe as a pattern integrity that has a trajectory across time.

11:02.910 --> 11:19.046
And understanding how that pattern integrity comes into being and is maintained is the mystery of life that we have not even begun to scratch, even though old bad biology would tell us that we're a decade away from having answered all the meaningful questions.

11:22.197 --> 11:35.276
It's important to understand also that yesterday I also took a swing at this, that our imagination is equipped with certain tools and a lot of times that those tools are basically words.

11:36.860 --> 11:41.503
Words are concepts and words can be enchantments if they are used correctly.

11:41.543 --> 11:44.585
This is just a quick plug for JC on the hardwood, my newest project.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.647
I'm going to go film another one after lunch today.

11:47.667 --> 11:53.771
I'm really excited about it because I really think it's going to be something that they're just going to have to ignore and we can say whatever we want to.

11:53.831 --> 11:57.074
And more importantly, we can say it on YouTube very shortly.

11:59.455 --> 12:09.562
So on a way back Wednesday, my idea is to point out to you how I think this enchantment is cast and how it is maintained.

12:09.602 --> 12:18.368
And the way it is cast and maintained is that they bamboozle us, they trick us, they coerce us, they scare us into using their words.

12:19.869 --> 12:27.695
And if we use their words, constrained by their definitions, then we are already trapped in their

12:29.099 --> 12:30.439
limited spectrum of debate.

12:30.559 --> 12:46.884
If we only use the weapons that we're given, only the weapons that we find hanging on the wall, and those weapons are gain-of-function research, RNA virology, DNA is genes, evolution is real, then it doesn't matter what weapons we choose, we're gonna lose.

12:49.986 --> 13:01.320
And that, I believe, is a way to understand the contributions of someone like Joshua Lederberg, who, for example, gave us a lot of these concepts and the words to describe them.

13:01.360 --> 13:07.607
And so when we go to the wall to choose a weapon to fight somebody and argue about this stuff, we're choosing weapons like

13:08.348 --> 13:13.932
the microbiome and plasmid because he made those words up and designated what they mean.

13:14.312 --> 13:22.698
And so even the very cartoon images that are evoked in our mind when certain words are used are enchantments.

13:24.179 --> 13:36.308
And now what I would like you to see as the confession of a recovering academic biologist is that that's what happens in academic biology, but in a much more rapid and thorough sense.

13:37.270 --> 13:58.408
We meet people each day and colleagues each day, as well as people on the internet or people at conferences who tell us stories about concepts that have names and sophisticated names and subnames and subcategories, and then they explain to us what they mean, and then we go away with that new tool set.

13:59.127 --> 14:01.928
that we think that we can apply to other questions that we have.

14:02.328 --> 14:13.614
And so once you accept the idea that these are useful concepts and that we can find more useful concepts by talking to other people that follow these concepts, then you realize that the

14:14.824 --> 14:25.247
near exponential growth of false or at least inadequately tested models of reality are just everywhere.

14:26.368 --> 14:30.029
We're just covered in them now, we're lost in them, and in fact, we're being governed by them.

14:30.609 --> 14:36.731
And it is a result of our language being so powerful in our mind and us not understanding it.

14:37.622 --> 14:41.446
They want us to think that, oh, AI is getting so smart because it's figured out language.

14:41.566 --> 14:44.269
No, language isn't that complicated.

14:44.409 --> 14:48.213
And they have understood how to use language against us for generations.

14:48.994 --> 14:53.558
That's why the slide in the beginning with Edward Bernays is so important.

14:53.718 --> 14:58.163
In 1924, they already understood that manipulating people was important to governing them.

14:59.554 --> 15:19.344
And now I and many others have been making the argument for a while and I think it should be at the foremost of every argument that allowing social media to be the substitute for free speech and communication is going to result in our enslavement because it is an illusion and they can create whatever illusion they want with that social media.

15:19.524 --> 15:21.285
They can create whatever illusion they want.

15:24.778 --> 15:35.846
And so with the way back Wednesday today, I just thought I would hit a gong that I haven't hit in a while, and... That would be the bell.

15:35.906 --> 15:38.087
I'm gonna ring the bell of the Scooby-Doo.

15:39.028 --> 15:42.830
I'm gonna switch over here to the bottom side here.

15:43.051 --> 15:43.931
Hold on one second.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.413
Oops, that should be cut there.

15:49.595 --> 15:51.977
So, yeah, we are here.

15:53.462 --> 15:56.944
And actually the Scooby-Doo mystery was solved in 2023.

15:57.265 --> 16:01.067
Now, in case you're a new viewer, you might not know what the Scooby-Doo mystery is.

16:01.147 --> 16:06.111
If you're a viewer from another country, you might not know what the Scooby-Doo mystery is.

16:06.311 --> 16:08.913
The Scooby-Doo is actually a dog.

16:08.973 --> 16:09.653
It's a Great Dane.

16:09.693 --> 16:11.995
Oops, talking to the wrong camera.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.036
The Scooby-Doo is a dog.

16:14.336 --> 16:20.481
It's a Great Dane that can talk and has three teenage friends or four teenage friends.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.642
and they ride around in a green van called the Mystery Machine.

16:25.482 --> 16:47.710
And the cartoon that was on the Saturday mornings when I was a kid, these intrepid teenagers would be just driving around through different random towns in America and always run into some weird monster that was haunting a town or harassing a football team or something like this, or protecting a mine.

16:48.670 --> 16:59.835
it would always turn out to be that they would unmask the the monster and find out that it just was glow-in-the-dark powder and the mask underneath the mask is some guy from earlier in the show.

17:01.295 --> 17:12.359
And so my argument for the last few years has been that the national security state has described to us many different kinds of exercises

17:13.996 --> 17:18.901
Event 201 is the one that everybody points at and says, oh, look at all the people sitting around the table doing this stuff.

17:18.941 --> 17:23.305
But of course, there's a whole long list of them that goes all the way back to Dark Winter.

17:24.786 --> 17:29.731
But there's also things like Crimson Contagion and the SPARS pandemic document.

17:30.452 --> 17:32.634
And all of these documents describe

17:34.264 --> 17:44.869
a hypothetical scenario where it is necessary for the government to control the messaging and to get the messaging out so that people's lives are saved from a potential epidemic.

17:46.070 --> 17:55.895
And interestingly, in none of these stories, in none of these stories is there a detailed way in which the government might control the narrative.

17:56.784 --> 18:17.129
And I'm suggesting that in retrospect, it has become obvious to me that what they did and the script that they played was a script where the highest levels of officials, all the way up to Rand Paul and Tony Fauci, would publicly seed a narrative about the cover-up of a lab leak.

18:18.174 --> 18:22.397
And so they would need people who understood that there was a potential for lab leaks.

18:22.997 --> 18:28.541
They needed people already in place that already argued about lab leaks, that said that they were a danger.

18:29.202 --> 18:36.987
They needed already the danger to be well-described in the form of gain-of-function research, and people already in place complaining about it, and they had that.

18:38.345 --> 18:48.954
And then they orchestrated a theater where on social media, it felt like the actual mystery and the truth was being revealed specifically on Twitter.

18:50.975 --> 18:53.918
And then specifically censored on Twitter.

18:54.058 --> 19:04.346
And that's what drove people off of LinkedIn and Twitter and onto Gab and Telegram during the pandemic, because Twitter was being censored.

19:04.386 --> 19:05.688
Then Twitter got bought.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.374
Then Elon Musk made it free.

19:09.414 --> 19:19.618
And somewhere in 2023, it became obvious that Rand Paul was right, that Tony Fauci had covered it up, that they had given money to EcoHealth Alliance, that EcoHealth Alliance had written a proposal.

19:20.098 --> 19:24.140
And that proposal revealed that they were going to put fear and cleavage sites into bat caves.

19:26.923 --> 19:51.709
And of course, people were available in 2020, already very early people, very dubious people like James Lyons Weiler, not some academic molecular biologist, virologist coming out and saying, whoa, this has got a fear and cleavage site, but some guy who in 2019 was telling us that viruses that we vaccinate for are still circulating asymptomatically in the background.

19:54.577 --> 19:57.540
A guy who wrote a book about the genetic causes of autism.

20:01.205 --> 20:02.146
It's extraordinary.

20:03.584 --> 20:06.325
And so this mystery was seeded by these people.

20:06.385 --> 20:09.785
And over the course of five years, we have come to believe it.

20:10.165 --> 20:25.349
Both sides of the narrative, the red and the blue, the Democrats and the Republicans now have basically come to believe that, well, maybe the Democrats think that it's not likely that it happened, but it could happen and whatever, it doesn't matter.

20:25.749 --> 20:26.669
We need to regulate it.

20:27.970 --> 20:35.432
And the Republicans are just even more convinced than they were in 2020 that there was a lab leak, like me.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.733
I was supposed to be on that team still.

20:38.673 --> 20:40.054
That's why they put me in this book.

20:40.094 --> 20:44.955
They wanted me to be the guy to carry the flag for CHD, that it was a lab leak.

20:45.695 --> 20:48.196
And had I done it, I would have been on Tucker Carlson by now.

20:52.142 --> 20:53.723
Breaking tonight, it's official.

20:53.964 --> 21:05.014
The Wall Street Journal reporting today that the Energy Department, joining the FBI in their assessment, has now concluded that a lab leak is indeed the most likely origin of the global COVID pandemic.

21:05.454 --> 21:13.342
This is based on new intelligence reports and crucially involves the assessment of the national laboratories, which are part of the Department of Energy.

21:14.042 --> 21:14.563
evening, everyone.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.725
Welcome to the next revolution.

21:16.205 --> 21:23.856
You heard it here first as we so we've got to have got to have some, some guy with a foreign accent on the television.

21:24.157 --> 21:29.364
And this is in 2023, where they're announcing the fact that it's no doubt a lab leak.

21:30.125 --> 21:30.526
No doubt.

21:34.138 --> 21:38.380
We were the first on television to lay all this out more than two years ago.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.741
It was dismissed as a conspiracy theory.

21:41.021 --> 21:45.242
But now, thanks to this new assessment, our original reporting has been vindicated.

21:45.782 --> 21:49.144
Remember, this is not just about the leak itself and the cover-up afterwards.

21:49.504 --> 21:51.925
We must hold the Chinese regime accountable for that.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.567
Even more important is this point.

21:55.368 --> 21:58.291
What were they working on in that lab and why?

21:58.971 --> 21:59.472
The answer?

21:59.992 --> 22:06.018
Gain-of-function virus enhancement that was not just funded by Fauci, but commissioned by him.

22:06.599 --> 22:12.184
And as we reported in January 2021, he broke Obama and Trump administration rules to do it.

22:12.785 --> 22:17.208
Fauci, more than any other person or organization, is the one who must be held accountable.

22:17.809 --> 22:28.136
Joining us now, someone who is rightly fired up about this and put out an incredibly strong statement as soon as this news broke today, newly announced 2024 presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy.

22:28.156 --> 22:29.117
Vivek, great to see you.

22:29.437 --> 22:35.101
We'll talk about your presidential message in a moment, but just your reaction to this news today.

22:36.533 --> 22:39.614
So this is out of a dystopian science fiction novel, Steven.

22:39.654 --> 22:42.135
You're right, you were among the very first on this.

22:42.615 --> 22:48.056
The very research that was conducted to supposedly- Speaking of a dystopian science fiction novel.

22:48.076 --> 22:48.996
Actually created one.

22:49.116 --> 22:51.837
And I think there are two prongs of accountability here.

22:52.257 --> 22:57.559
One is accountability for China and for the CCP, which tried to sweep this under the rug.

22:57.679 --> 22:58.979
And this will not go lightly.

22:59.319 --> 23:02.260
The US needs to lead the way in holding China accountable.

23:02.800 --> 23:10.509
But we only have moral standing to hold China accountable if we hold those accountable here at home that purposefully evaded U.S.

23:10.589 --> 23:15.996
constraints on gain-of-function research to anyway go through the back door and do it abroad anyway.

23:16.336 --> 23:18.138
And I think that accountability starts at home.

23:18.499 --> 23:22.704
Then we have the foundation to deliver accountability to the Chinese Communist Party.

23:23.084 --> 23:28.397
And it's also a lesson in free speech and open debate having prevented us from getting to this answer sooner.

23:28.778 --> 23:31.965
If we don't learn from our mistakes, we're just going to keep repeating them.

23:32.226 --> 23:33.047
That's the lesson of today.

23:34.249 --> 23:39.273
It's an incredibly strong message that you put out on this today, and I've just echoed there.

23:39.373 --> 23:52.482
One particular thing I want to highlight from your longer statement today was that you talked about criminal prosecutions for those responsible for that second part, those who broke rules to push forward this research.

23:52.522 --> 23:54.724
Of course, Fauci prominent amongst them.

23:55.004 --> 23:57.246
You could put in there Francis Collins, head of the NIH.

23:57.426 --> 23:58.566
Oh yeah, get Francis in there.

23:58.586 --> 24:00.508
Could you elaborate on that, the criminal aspect here?

24:01.550 --> 24:04.931
Yes, and I think here the facts are going to depend on whether there was intentionality.

24:04.971 --> 24:17.297
But I think there's good reasons for there to be a criminal investigation opened into this matter of whether these federal officials knowingly skirted a federal prohibition on a form of research that they wanted to conduct anyway.

24:17.677 --> 24:21.619
Many of them were on the record, objecting to this restraint on federal research.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.780
But this reveals really what's going on in the United States.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.601
Today, Steve, the people who we elect to run the government are not the ones who actually run the government.

24:29.942 --> 24:33.283
The real people who run the show make their own decisions anyway.

24:33.343 --> 24:41.705
And it appears what happened here is that they then privately used government money and public funds to be able to fund the same sort of research that the U.S.

24:41.785 --> 24:42.646
banned here in the U.S.

24:42.966 --> 24:44.246
to do it through the backdoor abroad.

24:44.266 --> 24:48.148
If that was done intentionally, I think that is grounds for criminal liability.

24:48.468 --> 24:50.868
And I think that there needs to be, this is a global pandemic.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.189
Millions of people have died.

24:52.609 --> 24:58.470
If there's any occasion for really delivering accountability, starting here at home, I think this is the example for it.

24:58.771 --> 25:00.311
I mean, it's spectacular, right?

25:00.351 --> 25:03.012
This is exactly what I mean by a Scooby-Doo.

25:03.092 --> 25:20.716
He is purporting to be a guy who always wanted to unmask the right villain, always knew who the bad guys were, and is now vindicated by this, and has a very specific prescription for how we can go forward with unmasking the bad guys and bringing them to justice.

25:23.300 --> 25:29.383
And what's very cringy about this is that when I was at his place, it was like May, 2020.

25:31.164 --> 25:37.187
When I was streaming with Kevin McCarren and Charles, I mean, and Paul Cottrell and Eddie Edds.

25:39.048 --> 25:44.871
Those were the months of the past five years where I was really interested in the idea of a lab leak.

25:44.991 --> 25:48.093
And then at some point I realized, wait, this is not possible.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.314
This is not how this works.

25:50.134 --> 25:51.555
Something else is at play here.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.813
And I still couldn't articulate it.

25:54.873 --> 26:07.763
I hadn't learned enough, relearned enough biology to adequately understand the objection that my gut was making, that my instinct was making, that this doesn't make sense.

26:08.684 --> 26:17.411
But already by July of 2020, I had realized that the way it would make sense is if there was a background signal on which they released something.

26:18.091 --> 26:21.414
And then it doesn't matter how far it is what they released goes,

26:22.472 --> 26:31.297
because if there's a background signal that overlaps with it, then you can pretend that, oh my gosh, this new car got out and it's called the Toyota and we found a few in Japan.

26:31.838 --> 26:35.340
And then you go look in your garage and you find one, holy shit, they're spread everywhere.

26:37.681 --> 26:42.364
And that's actually was my hypothesis already in 2020.

26:43.244 --> 26:47.147
And I think part of the reason why so many of these people in groups

26:48.226 --> 27:05.333
consecutively came and tried to get me back on DRASTIC's team and get me back on, focused on the lab leak and focused on the biology of the evolution of the virus and the phylogeny of it and Trevor Bedford's work.

27:06.033 --> 27:12.639
Because then that would get me off of the idea of a background signal and off of the idea that they were lying about it with fake PCR tests.

27:12.699 --> 27:19.884
And in fact, these people succeeded in getting me off of that idea for almost a year until 2022.

27:21.646 --> 27:23.548
And you can happily check my record on that.

27:24.949 --> 27:29.993
It's part of the reason why I feel so compelled to keep working on this particular problem.

27:31.388 --> 27:36.350
on bringing light to new people the idea that we were fooled into solving their mystery.

27:36.390 --> 27:39.012
And by solving their mystery, we have accepted their monsters.

27:39.492 --> 27:46.875
I don't think Vivek has been fooled into accepting their monsters, but we have by Vivek.

27:50.617 --> 27:56.379
And I also think we cannot go lightly with respect to China, who similarly has lied about this for a very long time.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.501
But I think accountability on both sides of the Pacific is crucial.

28:00.529 --> 28:03.590
What a perfect way of-of-of setting that out, Vivek.

28:03.650 --> 28:04.671
Hey, Sean Hannity here.

28:04.791 --> 28:11.834
Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News' YouTube page and catch our hottest... So here's just another example of the same thing.

28:13.355 --> 28:22.719
Scientists are still not sure where COVID-19 originated, but the idea that it may have accidentally leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, China, is under increased scrutiny.

28:23.139 --> 28:28.782
Yesterday, my colleagues at CBS This Morning spoke with Dr. Anthony Fauci and asked him about that theory.

28:30.305 --> 28:39.197
Even though you lean towards feeling that this is more likely a natural occurrence, we always felt that you've got to keep an open mind, all of us.

28:39.738 --> 28:45.246
We didn't get up and start announcing it, but we've always said, keep an open mind and continue to look.

28:48.436 --> 28:52.619
media coverage of the lab leak theory is also in the spotlight.

28:52.679 --> 28:55.661
To talk more about this issue, I want to bring in Paul Farhi.

28:55.701 --> 28:59.083
He is a media reporter for The Washington Post.

28:59.123 --> 29:00.884
Paul, thank you so much for joining us.

29:01.384 --> 29:10.710
So, I got to say, when I read the article, the media called the lab leak story a conspiracy theory, which is the beginning of the headline,

29:11.030 --> 29:16.193
I was kind of feeling some type of ways because I thought, well, I mean, we didn't call it that.

29:16.333 --> 29:25.638
The experts we spoke to said, you know, this is unlikely or any sort of iteration of this is probably not the reason why.

29:25.658 --> 29:28.920
Um, so I was like, I'm feeling a little sensitive about this.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.141
I'll get that out of the way right at the top.

29:31.782 --> 29:35.864
Um, you know, there were, you know, some outlets including, sorry, go ahead.

29:37.733 --> 29:41.056
I'm very happy that you said that, because that's exactly the case.

29:41.796 --> 29:43.218
Reporters talk to experts.

29:43.278 --> 29:45.299
Reporters are not scientists themselves.

29:45.620 --> 29:46.881
They rely on the experts.

29:46.961 --> 29:56.549
And the experts told us in the media that it was very much more likely to have been a naturally occurring phenomenon, not a lab leak.

29:56.749 --> 30:00.392
And we reported accurately what we were told by the experts.

30:00.793 --> 30:03.575
Since then, expert opinion has changed quite a bit.

30:04.336 --> 30:09.224
There is some receptivity to the idea that it came out of the lab.

30:09.685 --> 30:14.993
And that's what's changed, more so than the media having gotten it wrong.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.537
So make no mistake about it, this is CBS.

30:18.706 --> 30:23.570
And CBS This Morning, she showed, was interviewing Fauci and said, yeah, we never ruled it out.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.091
It's not very likely, but we never ruled it out.

30:26.892 --> 30:36.739
And what I am suggesting, and I want to be very clear about it, is that this was all part of a script that they knew they were going to do over the course of three years to make sure that the clock had this much time on it.

30:38.881 --> 30:40.982
Now, we're not exactly on script.

30:41.703 --> 30:44.785
The whole script wasn't followed, but the intention was.

30:45.669 --> 30:54.809
to fool the American public and the world into arguing about the possibility of, the biology of,

30:55.495 --> 31:03.039
the likelihood of, what could be a possible mechanistic explanation of, a lab leak caused pandemic.

31:03.599 --> 31:19.287
So that by the end of the multi-year discussion, within that limited spectrum of debate, we would be left with a bunch of experts on both sides of the narrative on social media, which kind of agreed that most likely it came from a gain-of-function lab.

31:19.547 --> 31:23.029
And the point is, is that if it didn't, it still could in the future.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.030
And we all accept that.

31:27.267 --> 31:30.688
And so the enchantment is the word pandemic.

31:32.589 --> 31:42.752
Because when I say the word pandemic right now, sorry, I wanna change this here so that I have some control over that.

31:42.992 --> 31:47.274
Yes, if we, how do I say this?

31:49.334 --> 31:56.257
If every time our kids hear the word pandemic, the entire biology of RNA

31:59.187 --> 32:07.551
and contagion and antibodies and vaccines is confirmed in their head because that's what happens.

32:09.491 --> 32:18.755
That's the magic of words that have definitions that we all understand is that when you say them, those ideas are automatically turned on in your brain.

32:19.235 --> 32:23.777
And so these are very powerful, potentially very, very powerful words.

32:23.917 --> 32:26.178
When you say gender, what comes to your mind?

32:27.213 --> 32:27.814
And it matters.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.077
If you say sex, what comes to your mind?

32:31.197 --> 32:31.797
It matters.

32:32.018 --> 32:43.008
And they can program that with social media and television and media by just governing, by just changing what thoughts go through your head on a daily basis so that habits are formed.

32:44.390 --> 32:50.836
And these habits, if they're formed on ideas that are myths, then you can't logic your way out of that trap.

32:53.194 --> 33:12.280
And if they have, through the course of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and five years of consistent lying, have gotten most people in the world to accept that they need to teach their kids that pandemic means, then we have a problem.

33:13.401 --> 33:17.122
We have a giant problem on our hands because

33:18.181 --> 33:30.824
I think the people that have been watching Giggle and Biological for a long time, following along, been in on this fight for many years, understand that this is complete mythology that even the no virus people have been protecting.

33:31.984 --> 33:35.945
And that's what's extraordinary about where we are, where in 2023, not 24, 24 is almost over.

33:40.652 --> 33:56.215
And already more than a year ago on CBS News and on Fox News, the mystery of the Scooby-Doo novel virus was already solved and already being blamed on EcoHealth Alliance and Tony Fauci covering it up and Francis Collins and boy, they better go to jail.

33:56.795 --> 34:06.057
And so now talking about pardoning them, even on social media is seeding or dropping harmonized

34:08.237 --> 34:15.283
Ideas, ideas that harmonize with this previous history that people can't remember because they have the memory of a goldfish, but it's all in there.

34:17.725 --> 34:25.531
And if you add up these last five years and everyone's exposure to social media, whether they like it or not, they're all inside of the same loop.

34:27.813 --> 34:33.217
And at the bottom of that loop, when you finally settle out the, the attractor state is, well, I guess it was a lab leak.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.099
And if it wasn't the next one could be.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.320
There's almost nobody in the world who doesn't think this right now.

34:43.742 --> 34:44.302
It's amazing.

34:46.803 --> 34:51.225
The media accurately reported what the consensus was at the time.

34:53.527 --> 34:56.609
But I see, you know, words really make a difference.

34:56.669 --> 35:02.153
And so there were words used like debunked or phrases like conspiracy theory.

35:02.654 --> 35:12.301
So how did the reporting on the coronavirus origins in the early days of the pandemic compare to what the scientific community was saying about it then?

35:12.381 --> 35:14.983
And you point out that there were experts saying that it was

35:15.643 --> 35:23.829
And so think again, remember the discipline that we're trying to hold in our head as we watch this weaponized media.

35:26.031 --> 35:29.133
What questions are they telling us are important to ask?

35:30.834 --> 35:32.335
What questions is she asking?

35:32.355 --> 35:34.517
Is she questioning the biology of pandemics?

35:36.598 --> 35:39.420
Is she questioning the biology of RNA?

35:40.761 --> 35:44.444
Is she questioning the biology of transfection or transformation?

35:45.686 --> 35:49.547
Is she questioning the biology of contagion?

35:51.208 --> 35:52.188
She's actually what?

35:52.208 --> 35:56.969
She was questioning... I mean, it's so complicated.

35:57.049 --> 35:59.430
It doesn't even make any sense what she was questioning.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.610
Hold on, I'm just gonna go back a second.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.551
Less likely to be a lab leak.

36:02.771 --> 36:04.771
But was everyone saying that in the scientific community?

36:05.091 --> 36:10.633
And you point out that there were experts saying that it was less likely to be a lab leak.

36:10.853 --> 36:12.853
But was everyone saying that in the scientific community?

36:14.254 --> 36:14.934
Right, that's still...

36:16.747 --> 36:21.531
So was everyone in the scientific community saying it was less likely to be a lab leak?

36:21.971 --> 36:25.254
Imagine how crappy of a question you could come up with.

36:25.574 --> 36:26.775
Could you come up with a worse one?

36:28.236 --> 36:33.661
Was everyone in the scientific community saying that a lab leak was less likely?

36:38.585 --> 36:42.047
And now these two people agree that that's a great question.

36:42.087 --> 36:43.088
Oh, that's a great question.

36:43.188 --> 36:43.509
I don't know.

36:43.529 --> 36:45.090
I've got a pretty long answer for it.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.196
It's amazing.

36:55.026 --> 37:02.032
Well, the general consensus that the likely source was an animal in nature.

37:02.713 --> 37:04.314
But yes, it was wrong.

37:04.454 --> 37:09.499
It was literally flat wrong to have said that this was debunked because it's never been debunked.

37:09.579 --> 37:12.821
We don't really know the source of the coronavirus.

37:12.982 --> 37:17.946
And to say that the theory that it came out of the lab was debunked is just not correct.

37:18.126 --> 37:22.610
And that's the correction that has occurred, I think, in the last year or so.

37:23.151 --> 37:30.282
a greater acceptance of the possibility, because again, nothing has been proven, the possibility that it came out of the lab.

37:30.663 --> 37:33.467
And, you know, again, there is evidence for it.

37:34.429 --> 37:36.431
Scientists are still debating this question.

37:37.312 --> 37:40.574
And, you know, part of this was political in nature, too.

37:41.095 --> 37:44.637
President Trump kept saying that it was definitely out of the lab.

37:44.757 --> 37:47.019
President Trump didn't really know, but he said it.

37:47.300 --> 37:57.087
And I think that made a lot of people shy away from declaring it so, because they didn't want to be associated with the president's bold claim.

37:57.207 --> 38:03.873
And so now think about how much time they've wasted and how many thoughts they've put into people's head that aren't useful to them.

38:05.162 --> 38:09.765
You're not learning anything from listening to these people because they're not asking useful questions.

38:09.805 --> 38:12.287
They're asking, what was the consensus back then?

38:12.407 --> 38:18.932
And now the consensus is, why is the consensus that?

38:22.675 --> 38:26.098
What does that mean for the biology of it?

38:26.458 --> 38:29.160
No useful questions are being asked here.

38:30.091 --> 38:35.553
And it's only in retrospect sometimes that you can see how useless the questions that they asked were.

38:43.176 --> 38:46.757
So the Scooby-Doo mystery was solved in 2023 already.

38:46.777 --> 38:47.437
We're at the end of 2024.

38:48.397 --> 38:49.018
Keep that in mind.

38:49.078 --> 38:50.918
It's been five years since 2020.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.520
I want you to under, this is a lot of time.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.101
My kids have grown up a lot during this crap.

39:02.742 --> 39:06.024
make me almost tear up if I say that again, so I won't.

39:07.245 --> 39:22.073
If we go back to 2021 and we ask ourselves how did we get to the stage where we were debating a natural virus or a lab leak and who was helping us get there, who was answering questions, what were people saying at the end of 2021?

39:22.113 --> 39:22.413
At the end of 2021,

39:26.138 --> 39:31.203
Keep in mind that university students were scared to go back to university in November of 2020.

39:31.383 --> 39:43.615
In November of 2020, Richard Ebright said that if we open universities without any kind of controls, there could be as many as a quarter million people dead by Christmas.

39:43.936 --> 39:44.777
That's what he said.

39:46.939 --> 39:48.040
On Twitter, of course.

39:50.493 --> 40:08.244
And so it was at the end of 2020 that I started talking about Marek's disease because Luigi Warren had sent me a paper about Marek's disease and encouraged me to think about the possibility that the spike protein vaccines were causing the virus to mutate and might make it worse.

40:09.625 --> 40:10.465
Look at this paper.

40:11.326 --> 40:15.588
And at the same time, Geert van den Bosch was coming out saying the same stuff.

40:16.449 --> 40:18.190
And I heard about him and thought he was a hero.

40:19.690 --> 40:25.772
At the same time, I was arguing that natural immunity would be better than getting a spike protein vaccination for the same reason.

40:27.533 --> 40:33.635
And so I was convinced that not only was transfection a bad idea, but transfection to the spike protein was a bad idea.

40:34.075 --> 40:39.897
And so I wrote a review about it that was published in May of 2021, and it's mostly wrong.

40:41.517 --> 40:45.779
But had I published it in December of 2020, it would have been less wrong.

40:46.721 --> 40:56.071
And it would have been more focused on transfection being a dumb idea, because natural immunity is always better, because we don't know what transfection would do.

40:56.131 --> 40:57.512
But I didn't get that review out.

40:57.572 --> 41:07.883
The review that I got out, with the help of somebody by the name of Piper Stover, was almost exactly what the lab leak mystery virus needed me to say.

41:10.222 --> 41:19.425
But I said we have to pause transfection because not only is it hurting people, but it could be causing the virus to become more deadly, especially to the people who are transfected.

41:20.906 --> 41:35.531
So I was lost in 2021, and it wasn't until the end of, remember in July of 2020, I was saying that it was probably a lab leak, but it doesn't matter because the PCR tests are aspecific because there's a background of SARS viruses.

41:36.496 --> 41:38.116
And we've never paid any attention to it.

41:38.156 --> 41:39.117
We haven't given a shit.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.457
And now they released one and are pretending that it's spreading when it's not.

41:42.577 --> 41:44.118
I said that in July of 2020.

41:45.918 --> 41:55.040
And by the middle of 2021, I was already back on the lab leak and the evolution of the virus and completely lost.

41:58.441 --> 42:04.983
And it was at the end of 2021 that I had the privilege, I thought, of interviewing Kevin McKernan.

42:05.851 --> 42:14.075
And so I think it's important to revisit this video and see what he told me and what he didn't tell me and to pay attention to how I processed it.

42:15.276 --> 42:20.478
Was I just rolled over by the details that I didn't understand at the time?

42:20.898 --> 42:23.980
How much of it, if I hear it now, will sound like bullshit?

42:25.120 --> 42:26.761
How much of it will I know is bullshit?

42:28.922 --> 42:30.623
And how much can we really hear the truth?

42:30.723 --> 42:34.305
Remember, this is a guy who cut his teeth at the Human Genome Project.

42:35.566 --> 42:46.850
A guy who purports to have come out very early and be one of the foremost authorities on this is now at the forefront of a lot of these funny podcasts where he's saying that there's double-stranded DNA in it.

42:47.650 --> 42:51.351
And even CHD and ICANN are pushing him as an expert.

42:51.391 --> 42:59.414
So there's a possibility that this guy could be involved in even the Maha thing.

42:59.454 --> 43:02.535
He could even be behind the scenes giving an appointment.

43:02.975 --> 43:04.236
It's not impossible.

43:05.134 --> 43:07.075
He's rolling in the right circles right now.

43:08.116 --> 43:21.804
So I think it's important to check what he was saying, not in 2020 in the beginning in May or in 2020 in August or in 2020 in December, although you can do that with three videos on my website and elsewhere.

43:21.864 --> 43:23.545
You can look for the Vance Crowe podcast.

43:23.585 --> 43:34.632
He was on three times where he told everybody that he was a pod expert and a PCR expert and used PCR to find out if COVID was on any of the weed.

43:36.048 --> 43:40.830
and argued that the WHO wasn't using PCR correctly, but he and others did.

43:40.850 --> 43:58.738
And I am making a very strong accusation that he is part of this illusion that protected the PCR from useful scrutiny and led us down the path of overcycling false positives and this kind of thing.

43:59.775 --> 44:15.748
So I think it's very important to take a look at the first time that I've actually had contact with this guy and what I thought and how I acted and how overwhelmed I was so that you can see and I can show you very humbly how and why it took me until 2023 really to figure it out.

44:17.009 --> 44:18.551
And before that I was still lost.

44:20.342 --> 44:29.047
And that's why I couldn't save my father-in-law, or my sister-in-law, or my best friend from college, or one of my very good friends from my time in Chicago.

44:29.087 --> 44:31.609
I couldn't save any of them because I wasn't saying the right things.

44:32.469 --> 44:36.792
And if anything, in 2021, I was still saying the worst things, which is, you know, it's a lab leak.

44:38.132 --> 44:43.035
And at the same time, the worst people on the internet were saying it was flying AIDS in 2021.

44:44.216 --> 44:47.838
Paul Cuttrell and, you know, lots of people were saying that.

44:49.949 --> 44:53.192
So let's check this out here.

44:56.815 --> 44:57.495
Hold on one second.

44:57.515 --> 45:03.200
Let me just check to see if I got, I thought I got an email that was important, but I guess I did not.

45:03.560 --> 45:04.261
Okay, that's good.

45:05.021 --> 45:05.502
Here we go.

45:10.866 --> 45:13.909
So this was originally recorded on December 12th, 2021.

45:14.709 --> 45:15.410
I think I'll shrink.

45:17.432 --> 45:17.852
And here we go.

45:25.195 --> 45:28.659
So my background, I've been in genomics for about 25 years.

45:29.419 --> 45:37.507
I started at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., with Eric Lander working on the Human Genome Project.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.449
I was the team leader for R&D there.

45:39.509 --> 45:40.530
We built all the robotics.

45:41.611 --> 45:47.016
that's in that nature paper for the floor that does all the purification and sequencing for that project.

45:47.576 --> 45:50.139
In around 2000, I spun some of that stuff out.

45:50.199 --> 45:57.165
There was several patents we filed on magnetic bead isolation of viruses and DNA from

45:57.905 --> 46:00.487
from E. coli and that stuff got spun out to a company called Agincourt.

46:01.367 --> 46:11.594
Agincourt became one of the larger sequencing providers in the country at the time and eventually got acquired by Beckman Coulter for a lot of the viral purification tools we had.

46:11.654 --> 46:15.917
We were building these RNA and DNA purification kits using these magnetic beads and so

46:16.617 --> 46:19.578
They needed that and they needed to bolt that onto some of the automation they had.

46:19.618 --> 46:24.980
So they came and acquired the company and spun out one of our R&D projects that was building the solid sequencer at the time.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.701
That got acquired a year later by Applied Biosystems.

46:28.801 --> 46:30.241
They brought that sequencer to market.

46:31.361 --> 46:37.083
I spent about five years there working on that platform, competing with Illumina, and then also brewing up other ones.

46:37.723 --> 46:39.264
We ultimately acquired Ion Torrent.

46:40.444 --> 46:41.705
which makes these chips right here.

46:41.725 --> 46:45.309
Another one of those little sequencers that runs on a chip.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.752
And that, I didn't invent any of that.

46:48.772 --> 46:58.241
I was just someone who, we saw the technology and pulled it in, and Jonathan Rothberg's team kind of carried a lot of that weight, but our team at Beverly also, about 100 of us jumped on making that platform sing.

46:59.363 --> 47:03.968
And then after that, I kind of just jumped out to start, we need to do something different.

47:03.988 --> 47:11.076
And I had a non-compete and now the company was LifeTech and it pretty much meant I couldn't work anywhere in the biotech space because they had fingers everywhere.

47:11.136 --> 47:18.505
So I started working in the cannabis space doing sequencing cannabis genomes, trying to get more of these compounds public, if you will.

47:20.067 --> 47:32.297
And what I mean by public is there's a lot of a lot of the things that you're seeing COVID right now have been plaguing that industry for decades.

47:32.694 --> 47:38.917
where the science is funded primarily by government and it crafts a certain narrative about harms.

47:39.617 --> 47:45.120
And so I was noticing that that plant was severely underappreciated and we just put its genome public.

47:45.420 --> 47:48.461
And since then we've been building tool picks and shovels.

47:48.501 --> 47:57.546
We sell snip chips and PCR kits to that industry to help them breed and help them track down viruses and track down different microbes that may affect the yield of the plant.

47:58.606 --> 47:59.346
That's my background.

47:59.406 --> 48:02.308
And I did do a little bit of clinical sequencing as well for five years.

48:02.768 --> 48:08.370
So I know some of the CLIA rules and regulations and how you should be doing PCR and not be doing PCR in clinical settings.

48:08.430 --> 48:11.851
And that got me dragged into the Corman-Drawson review.

48:11.951 --> 48:18.634
And then I've been doing some work very recently on just looking at the mRNA structures with Peter McCullough and a few others.

48:20.114 --> 48:33.559
Yeah, it's a really, now that I hear it put that succinctly, I'm kind of, well, I'm thoroughly humbled now and I really feel like I'm definitely interviewing someone who I need to be interviewing and that's really great.

48:34.780 --> 48:36.200
Do you want to expand at all?

48:36.240 --> 48:40.802
Has anything happened with the Corman-Dorstan thing at all?

48:40.922 --> 48:42.223
So that thing we

48:43.283 --> 48:48.825
We put that public, it got, the first one got attacked pretty heavily and we put it public, so we wrote like another 60 pages.

48:49.025 --> 48:51.406
So remember what the Corman-Jorstin report is?

48:51.586 --> 48:55.967
You can probably still find it somewhere on ResearchGate or something like that.

48:57.568 --> 49:10.012
It is an objection that was written by a group of people in 2020 objecting to the Jorstin PCR test

49:11.089 --> 49:25.923
maybe it's the Corman-Jorston PCR test that the WHO used, the objections of the paper included the ridiculous objection that it was peer-reviewed in less than 24 hours and that's not fair or that's not real.

49:26.043 --> 49:35.592
And we all know that if it really was a global emergency and they really needed a paper reviewed in 24 hours, anybody that's reviewed a paper knows that that is possible.

49:35.652 --> 49:36.393
You could do it.

49:39.366 --> 49:41.607
especially something like a PCR test.

49:43.728 --> 49:50.252
So I'm not saying the whole thing was ridiculous, but I'm kind of saying the whole thing was ridiculous.

49:50.392 --> 50:02.839
Now, there's a lot of reasons why, but the main one being the overarching principle was not to object to the use of PCR as a diagnostic to describe a pandemic at all.

50:03.766 --> 50:11.109
Rather, it was an objection to the way that that paper was approved and some of the methodologies that supposedly weren't right.

50:11.709 --> 50:19.012
The primer dimers, the things that could happen that weren't supposed to happen so that the test wasn't checked well enough, something like this.

50:23.253 --> 50:32.197
And this is important to see because it's not just Kevin McKernan and a bunch of guys from his weed factory or his weed laboratory.

50:33.496 --> 50:39.642
It's a very curious, a very curious, I mean, incredibly curious list of characters.

50:40.622 --> 50:57.438
The most enticing of which are Claire Craig of the Heart Group in the UK, who prior to the pandemic was part of a genome sequencing, genome mapping group looking to correlate genomes with disease using AI.

51:00.902 --> 51:02.323
and she wrote a paper with this guy.

51:02.363 --> 51:03.604
How the hell do they know each other?

51:04.645 --> 51:11.171
Why are they writing a paper at the beginning of the pandemic to object to a WHO PCR test?

51:11.271 --> 51:27.805
Why is she, a genome collecting pathologist from the UK, hooking up with a pot screening genome specialist from the Human Genome Project in Boston, and Thomas Binder in,

51:28.835 --> 51:35.317
Switzerland, and Mike Yeadon in the UK, and the list goes on.

51:36.618 --> 51:45.401
Many of the people on that list are still somehow or were entangled in the 2020-2021 fear, uncertainty, and doubt about a lab leak.

51:47.902 --> 51:52.744
There's no way to explain how it is that these people are on that paper together.

51:54.594 --> 52:00.899
except that they either already knew each other or they were put together in place because of an exercise that was ongoing.

52:01.380 --> 52:22.878
An exercise that included scripted, scripted and carefully controlled objections that formed a limited spectrum of debate, which would fool a huge population on earth into thinking that the question of whether this was a lab leak or a natural virus was the foremost question that needed to be answered.

52:27.349 --> 52:33.492
And we're still talking about his mastery of things and what he did and why he did it.

52:33.552 --> 52:35.693
And I don't understand it yet in this video.

52:36.994 --> 52:38.355
And that is a black swan hat.

52:38.495 --> 52:38.995
Absolutely.

52:39.055 --> 52:40.116
I'll go get it on right now.

52:40.656 --> 52:44.158
Trying to explain all the references behind what we have.

52:44.458 --> 52:45.579
That thing barely ever got read.

52:45.639 --> 52:48.580
I don't even think Stephen Buston read it when he reviewed the paper.

52:49.401 --> 52:53.863
So there is, if you go to my Twitter page, go through the story that's on the top of that page.

52:53.923 --> 52:55.984
It's really interesting about what's pinned up there.

52:56.624 --> 53:07.020
is that the people who are trying to attack that paper are on record in court cases before attacking Steven Wakefield for the same damn PCR problems that are in the Drosten paper.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.744
And they got paid half a million pounds to do it.

53:09.844 --> 53:12.508
Steven Buston got paid by Glaxo to take down Wakefield.

53:13.457 --> 53:21.025
Uh, and he was attacking him for not having internal controls in the PCR, uh, for not, which, you know, Drosten had no internal controls.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.628
At least, at least Wakefield tried to have an internal control.

53:23.708 --> 53:25.690
It just wasn't performing appropriately.

53:25.890 --> 53:29.895
I will admit, I still don't really know what he's talking about here at the time in the interview.

53:29.975 --> 53:35.200
And now I still assume that he's talking about Andrew Wakefield and they use PCR in his paper or something.

53:35.240 --> 53:35.621
I don't know.

53:36.923 --> 53:40.887
Or maybe there's another Wakefield that also objected to the PCR test.

53:40.987 --> 53:42.888
I honestly don't know, and I didn't ever check.

53:43.789 --> 53:45.190
But it's strange, again.

53:45.250 --> 53:53.818
It feels to me like testing out how much I know, throwing me another detail to see how I react to it, and seeing whether or not he already has me on my heels.

53:53.858 --> 53:56.220
And if I'm on my heels, then he's going to step trip me.

53:57.762 --> 54:00.083
That's what I feel like is always happening in this video.

54:00.183 --> 54:01.403
But his assay had one.

54:01.803 --> 54:02.763
Drosten doesn't even have one.

54:03.823 --> 54:07.164
And then a lot of the other things that we've, you know, the protocol wasn't very clear.

54:07.184 --> 54:12.266
A lot of the critiques that we put, and they got paid half a million pounds to do it.

54:12.346 --> 54:15.066
Stephen Buston got paid by Glaxo to take down Wakefield.

54:16.326 --> 54:23.548
And he was attacking him for not having internal controls in the PCR, for not, which, you know, Drosten had no internal controls.

54:23.588 --> 54:26.689
At least Wakefield tried to have an internal control, it just wasn't

54:27.011 --> 54:29.372
performing appropriately, but his assay had one.

54:29.772 --> 54:30.733
Drosten doesn't even have one.

54:31.773 --> 54:34.254
And then a lot of the other things that we've, you know, the protocol.

54:34.975 --> 54:37.096
And what would an internal control be for?

54:37.176 --> 54:39.097
Is he, is he assuming that I know it?

54:39.177 --> 54:41.258
Is he assuming that my viewers know it?

54:42.398 --> 54:43.018
Do you know it?

54:43.939 --> 54:50.082
An internal control is an amplicon that is thought to be present in every person in about the same amount.

54:50.990 --> 55:00.018
And it would be an amplicon that you could in theory scale the viral gene signal to, to get a relative idea of how abundant it was.

55:01.579 --> 55:12.348
And interestingly, I have worked on a case in California where we had some details about the PCR test that was used to test all the municipal employees for the whole year of 2020, every week.

55:15.151 --> 55:23.438
And it had a single amplicon for the N protein and a single amplicon for some other endogenous gene that very rarely actually showed up.

55:24.659 --> 55:41.933
And so if you looked at all the raw results of these tests for the client, you would see that the PCR signal that came up for the endogenous signal, the control that he's talking about here, came up at cycle 40 or something crazy.

55:43.319 --> 55:45.062
and sometimes 45, sometimes 24.

55:45.824 --> 55:55.662
And so the change in that signal shows you the incredible variation in the background that they are using as a baseline.

55:57.691 --> 56:00.193
And this is just one example of these tests.

56:00.253 --> 56:06.898
There were hundreds, hundreds, over 200 tests were granted emergency use authorization.

56:06.998 --> 56:09.881
Many or most were produced outside of America.

56:10.361 --> 56:19.148
Many or most were produced in China itself, shipped over here, and used to describe the spread of a novel RNA.

56:21.843 --> 56:24.184
And this guy's not questioning any of that.

56:24.304 --> 56:26.625
Not questioning where the products are made.

56:27.166 --> 56:29.206
Not questioning how the products are made.

56:29.727 --> 56:33.448
Not even telling us that, you know, they could use three Amplicons.

56:33.508 --> 56:35.049
They could use nested primers.

56:35.469 --> 56:38.051
They could have multiple endogenous controls.

56:38.711 --> 56:41.112
And why are the endogenous controls important?

56:41.132 --> 56:41.952
How variable are they?

56:41.972 --> 56:44.133
He could describe this and he's never done it.

56:44.514 --> 56:48.876
He didn't do it on the Vance Crowe podcast and he had three different hours to do it in 2020.

56:52.472 --> 57:15.303
And I've made many attempts over the last five years to try and explain how PCR could be used very, very meticulously in academia to prove the existence or the presence of a molecule or a protein or a gene and be used to very low precision in the real world as a diagnostic.

57:16.963 --> 57:21.986
And that should be one of the foremost messages that any of these polymaths would have for us.

57:23.109 --> 57:28.054
One of the most important things for you young people to understand is how PCR can work and how it doesn't work.

57:28.715 --> 57:34.540
Why it's important that we have these different controls and how many amplicons and whether they use nested primers or not.

57:34.841 --> 57:43.930
We have to be very skeptical of the EUA approved products that haven't adequately been tested in the real world on the background of a hospital population.

57:44.290 --> 57:44.771
Nothing!

57:48.462 --> 58:00.072
And we even had somebody like Matt Crawford in 2020 and 2021 telling us about how false positives can be generated just by sheer will and overcycling.

58:01.914 --> 58:08.540
And at the same time, we have molecular biologists in the universities that understand that if you do your primers right, overcycling doesn't matter.

58:13.324 --> 58:14.265
At least that's what they think.

58:15.319 --> 58:20.463
Because in their situations, in their experiments, in their laboratory conditions, that's the way it works.

58:21.103 --> 58:23.445
Why on earth would public health do it differently?

58:23.826 --> 58:24.586
They do it better.

58:24.646 --> 58:27.388
They do it on an industrial scale, a militarized scale.

58:27.729 --> 58:29.890
Of course they do it better than I do it in my lab.

58:31.732 --> 58:33.293
That's the illusion that we're all under.

58:34.954 --> 58:38.597
And he is a very important part of sustaining that.

58:43.752 --> 58:44.713
Paul wasn't very clear.

58:44.733 --> 58:52.438
A lot of the critiques that we put forward in terms of primary dimers and everything else, those things exist in the Drosten protocol.

58:52.478 --> 58:56.040
He was on record in a legal case attacking Wakefield for those same things.

58:56.180 --> 58:59.463
So, that's the reviewer that Euro Surveillance could pull up.

58:59.643 --> 59:00.944
It's the only one that went public.

59:00.964 --> 59:02.605
They wouldn't put any of the reviews public.

59:03.906 --> 59:13.272
So, we just have to go over the fact that he leaked some of this information on a podcast, that he was a reviewer, and he didn't even look at the primaries during the review, which is what our whole 60-page addendum was attacking.

59:14.378 --> 59:18.661
I don't know, I don't have much hope that like clarifying that's gonna end the pandemic, you know, back then.

59:18.741 --> 59:20.203
No, I agree, I agree.

59:20.243 --> 59:21.664
And so much of that is technical.

59:21.884 --> 59:23.465
So it won't end the pandemic.

59:23.485 --> 59:27.808
There you go, that's the... He already got me.

59:28.529 --> 59:29.910
But that won't end the pandemic.

59:31.971 --> 59:33.613
Yeah, you're right, there is a pandemic.

59:33.753 --> 59:36.054
Oh yeah, there totally was a pandemic.

59:36.515 --> 59:37.355
Oh yeah, you're right.

59:37.816 --> 59:39.977
Well, we'll have to find another way out then, Kevin.

59:40.398 --> 59:41.038
Tell me more.

59:46.984 --> 01:00:08.123
that that that for the vast majority of the people that could in theory be convinced a simple hand wave from the right person and that's gone but you brought up something twice in that in that description that that I really wanted to ask you about which is are there PCR tests that have what you would call a appropriate control

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:14.456
Yeah, there's a, I mean, there are, there are others tests out there that have internal controls.

01:00:14.496 --> 01:00:17.219
They go off the RNase P gene and that helps them tremendously.

01:00:17.579 --> 01:00:22.684
But what we're not seeing the industry do is pull out all the live dead PCR technology, which has existed for.

01:00:22.845 --> 01:00:25.087
So there, how quickly did he go through that?

01:00:25.187 --> 01:00:32.154
So remember, I'm arguing that there are several ways to optimize the specificity of a PCR test.

01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:36.676
Besides optimizing the primers, you can make them nested.

01:00:36.796 --> 01:00:45.079
Besides making them nested primers, you could make primer sets aimed at different viral genes or different signals that you thought were gonna be present.

01:00:45.139 --> 01:00:53.901
I hate to use the word viral genes because again, like I talked about in the beginning of the stream, I don't wanna go over to the wall and choose a weapon that they gave to me.

01:00:54.942 --> 01:01:02.184
And so if I talk about viral genes, I'm accepting that there are viral genes and that we have to worry about them and that our immune system has to make memories of them.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:06.853
Just like if he says, yeah, but I don't think clarifying this is gonna stop the pandemic.

01:01:06.893 --> 01:01:08.454
And I go, yeah, that's right.

01:01:08.494 --> 01:01:09.695
I guess there is a pandemic.

01:01:12.065 --> 01:01:23.570
And so if these people claim that they are using PCR to find a signal that they say is relevant to our health, then there are ways to optimize how they find that signal.

01:01:23.831 --> 01:01:34.916
One of which would be to target multiple parts of the signal with separate nested primer sets and require that a positive signal be characterized as the presence of all three or two of them.

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:52.578
And what did not happen in 2020 and 2021 is a PCR test with that level of fidelity with multiple targets and multiple endogenous genes that were required to be present in a certain quantity in order for the other quantities to be taken seriously.

01:01:52.978 --> 01:01:54.619
There was no test like that.

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.901
None of the tests were deployed like that.

01:01:57.361 --> 01:01:58.802
None, zero, zip.

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:22.781
And yet now, as late as a couple weeks ago, this guy was on the Danny Jones podcast spreading all kinds of nonsense, which also included this elaborate narrative about how the Omicron was defined as a COVID infection without the S protein and the other two proteins were there.

01:02:24.215 --> 01:02:33.976
So the implication is, is that we've always used PCR tests that we're looking for the S-protein, the N-protein, and one other protein like the E-protein, but that's a lie.

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:51.642
And anybody that wanted to figure that out could go on the internet and start downloading random emergency use authorized documents and the description of their protocols and find that there's a single PCR with a single primer set targeting a single amplicon.

01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:57.903
And at best, there is an endogenous control that is not used as a scaler, but just used as a yes or no.

01:02:57.963 --> 01:02:59.764
If that one comes up, then this one counts.

01:02:59.804 --> 01:03:00.164
That's it.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.803
And that's not how it's used on the academic bench ever.

01:03:04.884 --> 01:03:09.909
It's not used in any way, shape or form, except in the diagnostic space.

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:15.616
Again, because it's allowed and because this guy is making sure that we don't ask the useful questions that would reveal that.

01:03:17.678 --> 01:03:21.643
And now he's talking about live dead technologies, which again, what does that do?

01:03:24.053 --> 01:03:28.035
Oh yeah, so there are live viruses and dead viruses.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:33.078
And the live viruses are scary and the dead viruses are just false positives.

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:36.340
And the dead viruses can be there for a long time.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.882
So we can get a false positive for a long time.

01:03:39.362 --> 01:03:40.683
Kevin, tell me more.

01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:44.345
Probably a decade.

01:03:45.123 --> 01:03:46.544
It's been refined for a decade.

01:03:46.584 --> 01:03:52.310
This is the capability to get PCR to tell you what's infectious virus, which is non-infectious virus.

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:57.414
And they're not doing that for a very explicit reason, because that would have cut their revenues by an order of magnitude.

01:03:57.714 --> 01:04:03.119
I mean, if you look at just the how long people are infectious versus non-infectious, it's either five to tenfold.

01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:06.943
And now they tell you don't get PCR tested for 90 days if you've been positive, right?

01:04:06.963 --> 01:04:09.445
Because you might still be positive from the last infection.

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:25.173
you're not how many how many academic molecular biologists in your imagination should actually by their own experience know that these tests are of one one inadequate and two that there's technology that already exists that would have been better anyway what

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:27.292
How many people should really know that?

01:04:27.332 --> 01:04:28.712
Shouldn't there be thousands?

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:29.553
There should be.

01:04:29.573 --> 01:04:33.975
Yeah, I think anyone in the molecular biology space or genomic space knows that there's live dead tools out there.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:38.256
There's even stuff published on SARS with this, that you can do live dead viability PCR.

01:04:38.436 --> 01:04:40.357
There's even stuff published on SARS.

01:04:40.417 --> 01:04:42.418
Why the hell would anybody else know that?

01:04:43.859 --> 01:04:46.360
Why would anybody working in neurobiology know that?

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.301
Why would anybody that was transfecting mice know that?

01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:53.423
Why would anybody that was transforming mice with adenovirus, why would they know that?

01:04:55.782 --> 01:05:00.925
They order live virus from the supplier and they put it in their mouse and the protein shows up.

01:05:00.986 --> 01:05:03.287
Why would they ever think that it's just transformation?

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.030
What is he talking about?

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.012
He just said, yeah, there should be thousands.

01:05:10.412 --> 01:05:10.692
No, no.

01:05:13.427 --> 01:05:26.635
That's the reason why academia was so inept at speaking up, because very few of them have the broad understanding of the irreducible complexity of biology to appreciate how much of what we say is actually hand-waving.

01:05:28.816 --> 01:05:35.060
That's why everybody hated me in the back of seminars, because I always had to point out that, you know, well, it's kind of hand-waving what you're talking about here.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:42.624
It's a nice story, but it's built on that assumption, that assumption, and that assumption, and those labs are still running on those assumptions and haven't proven them.

01:05:45.796 --> 01:05:47.317
You're just using semantics.

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:54.382
That was one of my worst things that I would say because I often said it before I understood how badly I was hurting their feelings.

01:05:55.943 --> 01:06:00.806
There's one guy that's dead right now by the name of Eichenbaum.

01:06:00.866 --> 01:06:05.149
And Eichenbaum was a guy who worked in the hippocampal space that I was in.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:13.755
The hippocampus is a nucleus in the brain that is associated with spatial understanding, spatial navigation, and memory.

01:06:16.447 --> 01:06:32.884
And the Nobel Prize was awarded in 2014 to a number of scientists whom I've studied with and under, and greatly influenced me when I was still chasing tenure, including Edward Moser, Maybritt Moser, and John O'Keefe.

01:06:32.904 --> 01:06:37.129
And from the perspective of, I'm almost losing my train of thought here where I was,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:49.348
from the perspective of thinking about what we do and what we did in that brain, there's nobody in that space that would know anything about live dead technology in viruses.

01:06:50.148 --> 01:06:58.574
And so I don't know the thousands of people that he's talking about, but it's me being naive and saying, well, if you know about this, shouldn't there be other people who know about this?

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:02.217
And he says, yeah, but the truth is no.

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.765
The truth is, no.

01:07:05.925 --> 01:07:11.390
What he's trying to do is make me feel like there's so much you don't know that everybody else already knows.

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:13.231
They're not speaking up about it, so why should you?

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:21.038
It's not a red alarm for any of these people, and they have a professional knowledge of it, and you don't, so why should you be worried about it?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.321
All right, thanks.

01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:28.593
So it's not like, I mean, if you just Google search it, you'd find it.

01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:36.237
But the problem is that there's so many people they sweep up in that tail of PCR positivity when you're no longer infectious.

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:40.140
And then that explodes into a contact map of everyone else you're in contact with.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.683
So they're sweeping in an enormous number of clinically false positive leads.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:51.307
Clinically false positive leads that totally are relevant to defining the biology of the pandemic.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:59.294
They are totally relevant because what he's saying is, is that the paint is there, it's just not wet anymore.

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:08.263
The paint was spilled in China, it's been circulating for a while, and pretty much everybody is blue on the inside now.

01:08:08.723 --> 01:08:12.807
But some of people's paint is dry, and we only need to worry about the wet paint.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:22.505
That is an actually pretty good analogy for what they said happened with an RNA molecule that you can equate to paint.

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:25.209
It's a molecule, it's chemistry, it's chemicals.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:33.305
And they say that they made a very special kind of paint, that when they spilled it on the floor in Wuhan, it got on people's shoes.

01:08:33.746 --> 01:08:36.647
And before you know it, it was in everyone's lungs.

01:08:36.727 --> 01:08:41.729
And now his objection is not to the story that it's in everyone's lungs.

01:08:41.929 --> 01:08:46.030
It's to the objection that the dry paint is as dangerous as the wet paint.

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:52.653
And I'm over there going, wow, now I see so much clearer.

01:08:52.773 --> 01:08:53.593
Thanks, Kevin.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.982
Yes, technically, the RNA is there, but they're not infectious.

01:08:59.282 --> 01:09:01.123
And so I call that a clinical false positive.

01:09:01.523 --> 01:09:04.145
And that's probably the bigger problem than all.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:06.486
He calls that a clinical false positive.

01:09:06.526 --> 01:09:08.327
You go ahead and take that term, Jay.

01:09:08.468 --> 01:09:09.428
Use it on your stream.

01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:13.431
Call it a clinical false positive, because that's the perfect term for it.

01:09:13.471 --> 01:09:14.251
That's what I call it.

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:19.014
Although, the Drosten things are more like analytical false positives, right?

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:25.318
Like your primers hit the wrong shed, or you haven't proven to us that this doesn't hit other viruses like the flu.

01:09:26.035 --> 01:09:28.575
Those are things you can get in the weeds on with molecular biology.

01:09:28.695 --> 01:09:30.416
It doesn't hit other viruses.

01:09:30.496 --> 01:09:47.259
So the possibility that it could hit all of the background of bacteriophages that are there, all of the background of bacteria that was there, all of the background of your own endogenous genome is there, all the background of everything else, that's not important.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:53.040
The only question is, is whether or not these PCR tests overlap with other viruses.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.060
Stop lying!

01:09:57.299 --> 01:10:23.230
lion do you hear how malevolent that is but can you also hear how at the time it was just for me like a this guy's so smart yes but i think the real thing is damaging society is that the way pcr is currently tolerated which is very rarely against vero cells uh and very rarely

01:10:23.729 --> 01:10:24.811
through a viability check.

01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:28.696
Very rarely calibrated in Vero cells.

01:10:28.816 --> 01:10:32.461
Holy man.

01:10:35.425 --> 01:10:36.187
That's hilarious.

01:10:40.198 --> 01:10:43.721
Just seeding that little virology bit in there.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:55.810
Just make sure that he subtly reinforces all the biology of virology by making sure I remember that there's this one specific cell line they use all the time.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:02.334
Even when it's deployed, you have this long tail of people that are positive with RNA that aren't infectious.

01:11:02.414 --> 01:11:05.777
They get sweeped in, they get contact traced, and all their contacts get PCR'd.

01:11:05.897 --> 01:11:07.258
It just creates this huge explosion

01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:13.643
of PCR activity that effectively just shuts down society.

01:11:13.943 --> 01:11:31.430
Oh, the PCR activity shuts down society and it creates a very lucrative source of remnants that could be used after they are de-identified to sequence all the people that came to that testing center and build a database.

01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:38.633
interesting how he would ignore that, seeing as he's from the Human Genome Project and wants to sequence everyone.

01:11:40.374 --> 01:11:56.103
But in your space, in your space for botanicals and whatever, you have to have a pretty... And you can hear already that the nodule that was on my throat for almost the whole year of 2022 is building in this video already.

01:11:56.323 --> 01:11:58.745
I almost Kermit the Frog here, but not quite.

01:12:01.303 --> 01:12:08.865
a pretty specific, I mean, you must have run quite a lot of checks to be sure that what you're testing for is really there and that you're not producing a test.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:12.667
Well, I mean, that's what drives me nuts, is these are clinical tests going on humans.

01:12:12.707 --> 01:12:15.007
We have more controls testing candidates.

01:12:15.668 --> 01:12:18.629
I mean, there's an internal control on every one of our tests.

01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:23.290
You have to have, in order for you to have a viral load, which is what everyone's talking about, you have to have

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.800
two different CTs.

01:12:25.001 --> 01:12:25.921
You can't just have one.

01:12:26.061 --> 01:12:30.863
You need to have the host CT and you need to have the virus CT, so you have a ratio of virus to host.

01:12:31.123 --> 01:12:39.227
So there he's already kind of indirectly admitting it, that you only need two amplicons, one from the host and one from the virus, and that's already a lie.

01:12:39.847 --> 01:12:52.775
that would never be specific enough for anything and you would be relying solely on two primers and their specificity for a viral gene and relying on the idea that they don't pull up anything else in the background.

01:12:52.815 --> 01:12:58.358
It couldn't possibly be any bacteriophage out there with an overlap or any other RNA with an overlap.

01:12:58.818 --> 01:12:59.719
It's just that one.

01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:02.260
And our primers are pretty good for it, you know.

01:13:04.682 --> 01:13:07.884
That's the whole argument that he just made right there in a nutshell.

01:13:08.715 --> 01:13:13.883
You gotta have one that's aimed at the host, a control so you can scale it.

01:13:14.284 --> 01:13:19.112
But I thought he said there's all this technology for live dead that you don't need that scale anymore.

01:13:20.199 --> 01:13:21.900
we just went around the hamster wheel.

01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:30.507
He told us on the other side of the wheel that the PCR is silly anyway, because they have live dead technologies they could be using to compliment the PCR.

01:13:30.987 --> 01:13:49.121
Then we got all the way around on the other side of the wheel and he said, yeah, all you really need is a scalar so that you can tell whether or not the CT, the cycle count, the cycle threshold that is reached in the PCR test of concern is significant relative to the host signal.

01:13:50.529 --> 01:13:51.049
It's a wheel.

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:54.191
You're never going to get out of it as long as you run with him.

01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:55.732
Just skip the host.

01:13:55.772 --> 01:13:57.153
You have no clue what that number means.

01:13:57.613 --> 01:14:04.457
There's a, there's been papers published showing there's about a 10,000 full variants, a thousand, 10,000, it's a paper called DADU, uh, in swabbing your nose.

01:14:04.977 --> 01:14:06.578
That's the variance, the number of cells.

01:14:06.758 --> 01:14:08.779
Can you do that all in the same tube then?

01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:10.500
Or do you have two separate samples?

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.222
You put them in, you put primers in there that have fluorophores that, that go off.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:15.302
So,

01:14:16.767 --> 01:14:20.128
And there are some PCR kits that do this in the coronavirus space.

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:23.130
I don't mean to disparage all of them and call them all drawston.

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:23.330
But.

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:26.571
And so another thing he's pointing out there is that they're fluorophores.

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:28.072
So they do the reaction.

01:14:28.852 --> 01:14:30.412
It changes color or it doesn't.

01:14:30.853 --> 01:14:36.995
And the amount it changed color and the cycle that it changes color in the most rapid is called the cycle threshold.

01:14:37.075 --> 01:14:37.515
That's it.

01:14:37.615 --> 01:14:38.336
Something like that.

01:14:39.116 --> 01:14:41.757
Depending on the equipment you use and the measurement you make.

01:14:43.015 --> 01:14:52.698
but at some point the fluorescence will go to exponential and then they draw some line there, that's the cycle threshold and that's the relative level of the signal they say, and that's it.

01:14:53.138 --> 01:15:02.861
But understand that on the academic bench, you would also be required to sequence the amplicon that amplified and show that it was what you said it was.

01:15:04.402 --> 01:15:11.444
In other words, if you were gonna do PCR on a book and your primers were once upon a time and the end,

01:15:13.447 --> 01:15:16.769
And then you said, okay, so we sequenced it and we found the book, here it is.

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:21.632
Well, did you really predict this book?

01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:25.995
How many other books would come up with those primers?

01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:33.699
And if you're going to make the claim that these primers are so specific that they'll only pull up one book, you're going to have to kind of prove that, right?

01:15:33.759 --> 01:15:34.320
But you don't.

01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:39.412
It just, it turns fluorescent and then they make a decision based on that.

01:15:39.552 --> 01:15:43.713
And you have to take the company's word for it that they produced the primers that they said.

01:15:46.674 --> 01:15:47.654
That company's in China.

01:15:49.655 --> 01:15:55.076
Is a long time collaborator of the Human Genome Project, Beijing BGI.

01:15:56.617 --> 01:16:01.038
The same company that supplied a lot of the lateral flow tests to the UK and to

01:16:02.449 --> 01:16:13.556
Australia, and then you start to realize that if the testing facilities were controlled, you could basically roll out tests and make them read positive and negative wherever and whenever you wanted them to.

01:16:14.697 --> 01:16:22.582
All it would require is a spectacular commitment to lying, not a novel virus that spread around the world like paint.

01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:31.768
I think you can see how clearly it is that this is just a lie.

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:52.568
but it is a very elaborate lie that was sustained by many people, including people that we were fooled for many years were actually on our side, but were in fact sustaining this debate, asking the wrong questions and debating about them so that we would never usefully question the narrative that we accepted the pandemic.

01:16:53.749 --> 01:16:57.010
The idea that even if this is a natural virus, we can make worse ones.

01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:03.953
That might be much worse than a nuke, says kim.com with Charles Rixey and Kevin McCarran on the stream.

01:17:03.973 --> 01:17:12.836
That's why I play Kevin McCarran in the beginning of this stream, where he's saying in 2020 and in 2024, that it looks like it's the worst case scenario.

01:17:12.856 --> 01:17:14.837
It's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

01:17:14.857 --> 01:17:16.898
Those are five years apart.

01:17:18.018 --> 01:17:24.862
The exact same jackass that's been behind me for five years saying that it looks like a worst case scenario.

01:17:26.123 --> 01:17:28.704
In 2020, he said a billion people could die.

01:17:29.385 --> 01:17:34.768
In 2024, he's saying that it's a worst case scenario, something to do with prion and amyloid, I think.

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:46.035
These people all belong in jail because they have sold out our children and sold out our grandchildren's future.

01:17:48.786 --> 01:17:50.327
by playing along with these people.

01:17:52.609 --> 01:17:53.730
Make no mistake about it.

01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:59.235
I am suggesting that this is very likely a player against us.

01:17:59.255 --> 01:18:00.756
He's on Tony Fauci's team.

01:18:02.337 --> 01:18:09.103
He was on stage, met the president with Mark Lander and Francis Collins and all of them.

01:18:09.203 --> 01:18:10.544
They are thick as thieves.

01:18:13.827 --> 01:18:16.990
He was the team leader of research and development.

01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:31.518
Unless you're telling me that he told all these guys to screw off after a bad poker game or broke a bottle of whiskey on their basketball court and walked out, I'm not buying it.

01:18:31.578 --> 01:18:37.022
This guy is in, his dad was in, his brothers are in.

01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:46.729
And that's why it wasn't until the end of 2021 that he came on my stream and then he came on my stream and said this stuff.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:52.753
This isn't the same guy that was on the Vance Crowe podcast smiling and shooting the shit.

01:18:53.654 --> 01:18:54.834
Go watch those videos.

01:18:54.874 --> 01:18:56.155
He's friendly and happy.

01:18:56.556 --> 01:18:58.277
This is serious shit right here.

01:19:00.038 --> 01:19:07.943
He has a very serious objective, and that is to assess and to make sure that I leave here humbled and confused.

01:19:11.825 --> 01:19:16.308
The ones in the human space, they measure RNAse P, which is a gene that's human.

01:19:16.843 --> 01:19:20.306
and they compare that CT value to the CT value you get from the virus.

01:19:20.366 --> 01:19:23.609
Now you have a numerator and a denominator, and you can call a viral load.

01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:29.414
And according to the Mikey guidelines that Buston-Drawson himself authored, he spelled this out very clearly.

01:19:29.434 --> 01:19:30.855
You don't have a viral load without two numbers.

01:19:31.856 --> 01:19:32.316
you need both.

01:19:32.516 --> 01:19:40.480
But there is a lot of PCR out there in the coronavirus space where they're just skipping that, ignoring the internal control, and just saying if we get any signal out to 37, we call it positive.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.722
And they will refuse to sequence anything.

01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:46.884
I think the CDC only sequences stuff below 28, and I see other labs doing it below 32.

01:19:46.924 --> 01:19:50.786
So they don't really have sequence validation on the stuff past 32.

01:19:50.866 --> 01:19:51.906
All that stuff could be noise.

01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:54.628
It could be influenza, it could be other coronavirus.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:20:00.671
But the other thing to realize, Jason, is that marijuana, because of its,

01:20:02.728 --> 01:20:10.092
cannabis because of its bouquet of medically active compounds.

01:20:10.112 --> 01:20:10.913
Let's call them that way.

01:20:10.933 --> 01:20:12.013
They can be psychoactive.

01:20:12.053 --> 01:20:14.995
They can also be physiologically active as well.

01:20:16.796 --> 01:20:18.797
Not that dissimilar from pine trees.

01:20:20.098 --> 01:20:30.144
There are lots of plants that because of the breadth and the depth of their variation are great candidates for personalized medicine.

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:42.031
And one of the ideas that he's put forth before and one of the arguments that he's offered before of sequencing cannabis was specifically for this, to make personalized weed.

01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:48.558
Or maybe just to sequence you so that they could figure out what kind of weed you're predisposed to enjoy.

01:20:48.578 --> 01:20:51.421
You know, you should have a sativa or an indica or something like that.

01:20:51.821 --> 01:21:03.848
And of course, on a pharmaceutical level, on a biopharmaceuticals level, they would be talking about the relative ratios of different compounds and trying to follow that with the genetics of the plant so that they could predict it and manipulate it.

01:21:04.968 --> 01:21:09.291
Once they can predict it and manipulate it, then in theory, they could breed pot plants for different people.

01:21:09.351 --> 01:21:17.255
That's the argument, but it's a wrong argument because you're just getting back to personalized medicine in some weird way to get in it.

01:21:19.005 --> 01:21:28.829
And the more it has to do with things that people find interesting or people are motivated to argue for, like weed or psychedelics, then the more it makes sense.

01:21:28.929 --> 01:21:35.511
And they're going to do the same thing with psychedelics, that psychedelics represent something that happens and helps some people and can make other people crazy.

01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:42.494
And so if we figure out the genetic basis for this, we could find a whole new, a whole new tablet of medicines that could be useful to us.

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:57.750
And like Kevin McKernan said on the Danny Jones podcast that I highlighted on my last JC on the hardwood, we wouldn't just be drugging people willy nilly, but we would sequence their genomes and then drug them specifically for their genomes.

01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:59.533
He's almost said that word for word.

01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:06.551
And so that's the bait and switch illusion shell game that's going on here.

01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:11.153
You know, I'm just, I like weed and I like, you know, cool shirts and I like cats and whatever.

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:16.635
And I like to post pictures of, of plates that were dead a long time ago.

01:22:17.236 --> 01:22:19.076
That's not a useful experiment behind him.

01:22:19.096 --> 01:22:21.097
That's an experimental plate out of the garbage.

01:22:21.157 --> 01:22:28.520
So the whole idea that he puts that behind him already tells you that he's it's garbage.

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:30.497
Something's wrong here.

01:22:30.537 --> 01:22:36.579
You don't proudly post a piece of garbage behind you.

01:22:36.799 --> 01:22:37.339
That's weird.

01:22:37.759 --> 01:22:37.979
I see.

01:22:37.999 --> 01:22:38.519
We don't know.

01:22:38.539 --> 01:22:39.639
They're not sequencing that stuff.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:41.960
I see.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.461
And that 13 number kind of lines up with probably what you've seen from Didier Riel's lab.

01:22:48.121 --> 01:22:50.801
The paper out of, I think it was Jessica.

01:22:51.622 --> 01:22:54.682
Didier Riel, the guy who said that hydroxychloroquine worked.

01:22:54.902 --> 01:22:58.163
But of course, there was a pandemic, but hydroxychloroquine was working.

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:00.221
that guy.

01:23:02.604 --> 01:23:12.936
Jafar, I may have, no Rita Jafar, she did this work where they calibrated PCR on Vero cells to show what CT, they stopped forming PFUs.

01:23:12.956 --> 01:23:14.999
And you should know Vero cells are hyper

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.176
They're very sensitive to this virus.

01:23:17.276 --> 01:23:20.859
If you compare Vero cells to human cells, you don't get the same PFU value.

01:23:20.959 --> 01:23:22.380
So he's saying the same thing again.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.442
Now he's telling me about PFU values and bamboozling me again.

01:23:26.943 --> 01:23:30.685
So of course what's coming is, oh man, what is a PFU?

01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:32.006
That's so crazy.

01:23:32.106 --> 01:23:32.507
Wow.

01:23:32.567 --> 01:23:33.667
I don't know any of this stuff.

01:23:33.687 --> 01:23:34.548
You're so smart.

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:40.512
As you get orders of magnitude lower, PFU values when you use human cell lines.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.938
The Vero cells really make a lot of PFUs.

01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:46.560
And so they found the number around 33 with their assay.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.242
So there's a lot getting called above and beyond 32.

01:23:50.562 --> 01:23:52.443
What is PFU?

01:23:52.483 --> 01:23:53.764
Is that like per?

01:23:54.344 --> 01:23:57.946
Oh, PFU is platforming units, like colony forming units.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.747
These colonies back here, you might see.

01:24:00.027 --> 01:24:00.607
You count those.

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:01.788
Each one of those is a CFU.

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:04.630
With viruses, you make a lot of cells.

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:07.472
And then the plaques form where all the cells are dying.

01:24:08.152 --> 01:24:11.234
And those are each individual virions that seeded that death.

01:24:11.455 --> 01:24:13.496
And so you count the plaque forming units and stuff.

01:24:13.796 --> 01:24:16.758
I don't think that what he pointed at is what he said it was.

01:24:16.898 --> 01:24:18.640
And I think that's part of the test.

01:24:21.662 --> 01:24:24.304
Now, I knew that already in this video, but I didn't say it.

01:24:24.344 --> 01:24:27.226
But I also didn't, I just thought it was a joke that he put that behind him.

01:24:28.612 --> 01:24:36.358
But this question was real, but this answer, I immediately, you can see it in my face, I think I understood already that something was wrong here, but then I let it go.

01:24:37.859 --> 01:24:39.640
Because overwhelming is overwhelming.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.181
And I was overwhelmed in this video.

01:24:42.702 --> 01:24:43.823
Yeah.

01:24:44.043 --> 01:24:47.646
And so you measure a PFU curve and calibrate it to a CT level.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:51.709
And then you have a sense of, okay, this assay is picking up viability.

01:24:52.222 --> 01:24:53.183
out at a certain time.

01:24:53.684 --> 01:24:54.005
I see.

01:24:55.427 --> 01:25:00.233
I understand that so much better now than I've read it probably 50 times and I didn't really fully understand it.

01:25:00.273 --> 01:25:00.714
That's funny.

01:25:01.515 --> 01:25:01.795
Yeah.

01:25:03.057 --> 01:25:04.379
But I don't do viruses, right?

01:25:04.419 --> 01:25:08.304
I mean, just trying to read into this immunology and so much of it just doesn't make

01:25:09.195 --> 01:25:10.136
congruent sense.

01:25:10.196 --> 01:25:12.337
I mean, I can't tell you all the details.

01:25:12.997 --> 01:25:16.099
And that's why it's really interesting to talk to you.

01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:22.303
So the next thing that from a general biologist perspective has been on my mind for a long time is the idea that

01:25:23.098 --> 01:25:38.843
Moderna and Pfizer have told us that they have this sequence and they can make many good copies of it and then put it in our cells and they'll make very many good copies of a protein that will harmlessly provoke an immune response that we can rely on in the future.

01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:48.086
And a lot of that seems odd, but the most odd of it was this calling it vaccination instead of transfection.

01:25:48.146 --> 01:25:52.207
And I always understood transfection as being something that

01:25:53.067 --> 01:25:58.770
I mean, when we did it to our mice, it was an endpoint after five or six weeks of having transfected.

01:25:58.810 --> 01:25:59.570
Look at his face.

01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:02.712
This is why he's here.

01:26:04.853 --> 01:26:07.154
This is the serious point in the conversation.

01:26:07.214 --> 01:26:09.095
This is the part where he can't make a mistake.

01:26:11.936 --> 01:26:16.398
I did a particular, let's say, optogenetic protein in the brain.

01:26:16.479 --> 01:26:19.100
That area of the brain is also going to be a little bit.

01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:21.441
Unhappy.

01:26:21.633 --> 01:26:23.535
Yeah, unhappy, let's say it like that, yes.

01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:27.258
Yeah, if you overdo it with the lipid nanoparticles, they become toxic.

01:26:27.639 --> 01:26:30.982
If you overdo it with the lipid nanoparticles.

01:26:32.563 --> 01:26:38.509
But transfection in a mouse brain is with adenovirus, so non-infectious adenovirus.

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:41.392
If you overdo it,

01:26:42.765 --> 01:26:46.147
Huh, let's hear how he's gonna talk his way out of this one.

01:26:46.727 --> 01:26:52.530
So you can't, usually you have to go in at low MLI, low multiplicity infection in order for you to get.

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:54.851
You gotta go in at a low MLI.

01:26:55.592 --> 01:26:56.332
Stop lying!

01:26:57.092 --> 01:27:02.295
Holy cow, just another term just trying to bury me under stuff I didn't know existed.

01:27:02.755 --> 01:27:05.757
And those terms are supposed to provoke ideas.

01:27:06.277 --> 01:27:10.299
And the idea is, is that if it doesn't provoke an idea, what does that signal to you?

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:11.620
You don't know.

01:27:13.871 --> 01:27:15.992
And that's how these people bamboozle you.

01:27:16.032 --> 01:27:20.194
If you say, I don't know, I'm going to just try to figure out one really quick.

01:27:26.057 --> 01:27:34.061
The calculatory difference between indebted vaccinology and infectious immunology.

01:27:35.933 --> 01:27:50.223
Now, if I could say that three times in a row, like with conviction, even though it doesn't mean anything, you can imagine a scenario where in biology, you can hear a lot of those combinations of words and what's provoked in a tenure seeking.

01:27:51.385 --> 01:27:57.907
graduate student wanting to graduate is, wait, I don't understand those three words.

01:27:57.967 --> 01:27:59.348
Can you define them for me?

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:01.229
He said, P-F-U.

01:28:01.369 --> 01:28:03.029
I said, wait, I don't know what that means.

01:28:03.089 --> 01:28:06.250
Then he put what it means into my head.

01:28:06.731 --> 01:28:16.094
And now for years afterward, anytime I hear P-F-U, I already know what that means because Kevin McKernan told me, and I feel very good about remembering what it means.

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:33.760
And now understand that if you have teachers that don't have your best interest in mind, you can build up a whole bunch of things that you don't know, that you think are part of your toolbox, and then start using them to build things.

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.880
And everything you build will be built out of nothing.

01:28:38.461 --> 01:28:41.782
And that's what I think a lot of biology and medicine is right now.

01:28:41.882 --> 01:28:49.305
It is an elaborate illusion that is based on very, very, very fundamental concepts that are wrong.

01:28:51.107 --> 01:28:54.930
And the best that I can codify them right now is evolution because of DNA.

01:28:54.990 --> 01:29:03.316
That is a foundationally false idea, most of which our understanding of ourselves is based on.

01:29:04.457 --> 01:29:09.200
And ultimately, the reason why we think intramuscular injection isn't a bad way to give each other medicine.

01:29:15.459 --> 01:29:16.819
those transfection systems to behave.

01:29:16.859 --> 01:29:25.421
I've done, I've done some of the valiant transfection in the, I can't say this about the lipid nanoparticles they're using because they've modified them, but the ones that we were typically using were ruined.

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:28.042
They modified the lipid nanoparticles.

01:29:28.122 --> 01:29:38.724
So he actually has also said exactly the same thing that Robert Malone saying in August of 2021, that I never imagined Peter McCullough, what Peter Cullis has done here.

01:29:38.744 --> 01:29:41.785
I never imagined technology that would be so efficient.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.503
And so he can't speak to the nanoparticles here because they've done something different.

01:29:49.883 --> 01:29:50.644
Stop lying!

01:29:51.064 --> 01:29:54.627
Sounds like he's protecting the intellectual property of this bullshit, doesn't it?

01:29:55.228 --> 01:29:59.872
Betragen is surest way to destroy your cell lines is to put too much of it in there.

01:30:01.012 --> 01:30:04.255
So I'm very skeptical of what they've claimed.

01:30:04.295 --> 01:30:10.640
They've claimed they have these mRNAs that get transfected and then that they make this perfect spike protein.

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.521
They've never shown that.

01:30:11.857 --> 01:30:14.918
I mean, unless your audience can find, I really hope someone can prove me wrong.

01:30:15.018 --> 01:30:16.618
So now again, what's the question?

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:17.859
Stay disciplined.

01:30:17.919 --> 01:30:25.301
The question is, do they make the spike protein that they're supposed to make, or do they make that and stuff other than that?

01:30:26.361 --> 01:30:27.821
Because then what's the problem?

01:30:28.202 --> 01:30:32.323
We just have to optimize it so that they do only make the spike protein.

01:30:32.823 --> 01:30:33.563
Stop lying!

01:30:34.163 --> 01:30:40.445
Already in 2021, we are already seeding a narrative, starting to try and get me to think that way.

01:30:41.374 --> 01:30:47.319
that there are problems with it, that it might have been rushed, that there are shortcomings in the manufacturing that still need to be overcome.

01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:59.331
Not that expression of a protein by transfecting a human is a bad idea, but the way that we are doing it might fall short.

01:31:04.535 --> 01:31:05.236
Here, because I've been

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.882
There's now like so many millions of papers of SARS-CoV-2 out there.

01:31:08.902 --> 01:31:11.263
It's very hard to dig through the literature and find exactly.

01:31:11.283 --> 01:31:12.243
Oh, I've been looking.

01:31:13.984 --> 01:31:23.369
I've been looking for if anyone has found like dose, you know, if they have some range of what they expect to go into circulation or what they expect to be produced.

01:31:25.276 --> 01:31:42.252
And the other thing that you've written a paper about recently is the obvious unknown of post-translational modification and then how the protein itself is folded, given the fact that it's not the actual sequence, they've molded the sequence in such a way.

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:49.273
Yeah, so that is, I think that's criminal in that it's technically a prodrug, right?

01:31:49.333 --> 01:32:00.137
Because you're giving a sequence that you're transfecting into cells and you're asking your cells to make the final drug without ever having to declare what the final drug is or prove the fidelity of making that final drug.

01:32:00.437 --> 01:32:06.640
So that's a pretty spectacular argument that I think if he made it in December 2021, he still should be making it now.

01:32:10.987 --> 01:32:13.207
But it's still an argument about purity.

01:32:14.728 --> 01:32:18.769
It's still an argument about whether it does what it says on the label.

01:32:18.789 --> 01:32:20.729
It still sounds like an FDA problem.

01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:29.911
And so maybe the FDA didn't regulate a prodrug like it's supposed to have regulated a prodrug.

01:32:29.931 --> 01:32:33.392
And maybe we should get rid of the FDA because they can't regulate this kind of prodrug.

01:32:37.049 --> 01:32:41.874
I'm still hearing something fishy here, although it does sound much better than the last 10 minutes did.

01:32:42.835 --> 01:32:44.356
They got away with a hall pass on that.

01:32:44.496 --> 01:32:51.303
Like if this were some other drug that was a pro-drug that your liver modified and turned into another drug, you'd have to have all these P450 studies, you've got bad dose rate.

01:32:51.323 --> 01:32:53.605
Oh, that's a really wonderful way to explain it.

01:32:53.645 --> 01:33:01.833
I think a lot of people will, even some nurses and stuff would understand that if you point out that if this was a pro-drug that had to go through the liver first,

01:33:02.941 --> 01:33:10.567
then you would have so many more checks and balances and tests and trials that would have needed to be done on all stages of that before.

01:33:10.587 --> 01:33:12.268
You'd have to prove what the final drug is.

01:33:12.908 --> 01:33:13.849
Right, right, right.

01:33:14.309 --> 01:33:17.812
They have no evidence that they're making a spike protein off of this MR.

01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:21.210
I mean, they have, they have a couple, I shouldn't say no evidence.

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:25.172
There's papers out there where they take these things and they express them in other posts.

01:33:25.593 --> 01:33:25.973
Right.

01:33:26.073 --> 01:33:28.894
And I've seen a couple of 3D, um, you know, crystal structures with them.

01:33:28.954 --> 01:33:30.895
They've all used modifications of it.

01:33:30.915 --> 01:33:34.757
Like they put a twin strap on one end so they can purify these and crystallize them.

01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:38.079
Or they're not, they're not using the pseudo uridine template.

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:41.561
Sometimes they're putting them in DNA vectors and getting them to express, you know, so.

01:33:43.096 --> 01:33:53.701
The actual mRNA getting injected into people and what actual peptide sequences that those mRNAs manufacture in cells, I can't find literature on.

01:33:53.741 --> 01:33:57.983
I can find some people- So why didn't he say any of this in front of the Senate?

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:17.334
Why wouldn't, if you could, if you could spike the football by saying the whole list of reasons why this was dumb, which he hasn't said yet, of course, he's on a specific list of reasons that all falls under a grand category of it sucks now, but we could make it better.

01:34:18.995 --> 01:34:26.321
He's not gonna touch the biology of expressing proteins that aren't supposed to be where they are in healthy people.

01:34:28.117 --> 01:34:37.081
He's only gonna discuss it as a product that doesn't meet what it says on the label, has not been evaluated in the way it should have been evaluated.

01:34:38.262 --> 01:34:44.565
He's not gonna ever object to the methodology of using this technology on healthy people.

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:49.428
He's not even gonna frame it in that context where a question like that would make sense.

01:34:50.028 --> 01:34:51.969
That's his job here.

01:34:53.049 --> 01:34:59.794
By the time you're done talking to this guy, you better make sure that he never asks a useful question about this again, or we're in big trouble.

01:35:05.859 --> 01:35:13.906
Sent me material that were from Pfizer's disclosures, I think to some European government agencies, which I can forward to you if you want to link into this chat.

01:35:14.947 --> 01:35:19.030
But they basically show that they have all types of problems in multiple different bands.

01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:22.713
When they go and try to express these in vitro, they get all types of

01:35:22.964 --> 01:35:29.952
fragmentation that occurs, and they don't know if it's fragmentation of the virus or stall points in translation, and the banding patterns they see on gels are smears.

01:35:30.513 --> 01:35:39.604
So don't you think by now, if all of what he said is true, don't you think by now he should have already said, I think we should stop all of these things in people?

01:35:40.385 --> 01:35:41.246
We should just stop.

01:35:41.306 --> 01:35:42.707
It's just crazy that we're doing it.

01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:46.011
At what point does that become the actual message?

01:35:46.052 --> 01:35:59.860
Like, you know, when you're breaking up with somebody and you talk to them for like four hours about all the fun times you had together and about how bad things are all the time and whatever, but in the end, you can't just say, I wanna break up with you.

01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:12.047
And it's so striking to me how all of these fakers are so good at talking for so long and saying nothing useful, you know, really simple.

01:36:14.522 --> 01:36:15.242
Get to the point.

01:36:16.423 --> 01:36:17.364
But there is no point.

01:36:18.244 --> 01:36:22.307
The point is fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and if necessary, coercion.

01:36:25.969 --> 01:36:31.652
And there's questions on them having to clarify why are those smears not the right size, the anticipated size.

01:36:32.172 --> 01:36:34.754
And that's all we can see from some of the regulatory disclosures.

01:36:34.794 --> 01:36:39.977
So what has me worried about what they did is they took

01:36:40.754 --> 01:36:47.217
a sequence that was already code unoptimized by a virus adapted to its host and decided to make it different.

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:50.738
And that's also a wonderful enchantment.

01:36:50.758 --> 01:36:54.779
Look at it, look at it falling through the little Plinko board of my head.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.301
So the virus has already optimized the spike protein.

01:36:59.501 --> 01:37:01.242
Ooh, I got to play the music.

01:37:02.099 --> 01:37:05.561
Ooh, the virus has already optimized the spike protein.

01:37:05.761 --> 01:37:06.922
The virus evolved.

01:37:07.422 --> 01:37:09.063
Virus is an evolved virus.

01:37:09.603 --> 01:37:11.544
Oh, what if it's not an evolved virus, Kevin?

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:14.526
What if it's a laboratory designed virus, Kevin?

01:37:14.546 --> 01:37:15.967
You forgot all about that, Kevin.

01:37:17.728 --> 01:37:20.910
We know this is now the most toxic protein probably in virus, right?

01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:24.192
So if a virus has evolved a certain codon structure.

01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:24.752
Look at me.

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:25.432
It probably has

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:35.742
got the codon structure right, and that it needs to make sure it's not lethal to the host so it can still survive transmission.

01:37:36.732 --> 01:37:40.314
but they went with the route of supercharging this by codon optimizing it.

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:40.475
So.

01:37:40.995 --> 01:37:41.996
Oh my gosh.

01:37:42.116 --> 01:37:52.103
So then he's actually saying that the spike protein that they make could even be worse than the spike protein that the virus optimized not to kill the host.

01:37:52.543 --> 01:37:53.143
Holy cow.

01:37:53.183 --> 01:37:54.244
I almost missed that.

01:37:54.284 --> 01:37:56.406
That's, that's even more spectacular.

01:37:56.426 --> 01:37:56.966
Do you hear it?

01:37:57.006 --> 01:37:57.967
More inhuman.

01:37:58.207 --> 01:38:02.370
I mean, this is what I'm not as evolved a certain codon structure for a toxic peptide.

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:05.012
It probably has,

01:38:06.007 --> 01:38:12.732
got the codon structure right, and that it needs to make sure it's not lethal to the host so it can still survive transmission.

01:38:13.693 --> 01:38:19.417
But they went with the route of supercharging this by codon optimizing it so it would express even more in human.

01:38:19.637 --> 01:38:24.821
I mean, this is what I'm not, I think I do, whenever you want to hyperexpress a protein, this is just what we do.

01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:31.226
We codon optimize it, we put it behind a really heavy promoter, toss it into some cells that are gonna be sacrificial, and just jack the expression of it up.

01:38:31.826 --> 01:38:33.747
But you're doing this in cells you know you're gonna kill,

01:38:35.441 --> 01:38:38.162
and then purify as much of the damn protein as you can.

01:38:38.202 --> 01:38:40.542
That's not necessarily what you need to do to dose humans.

01:38:41.122 --> 01:38:51.965
You shouldn't be necessarily aiming for maximum expression, because when an RNA gets into a cell and starts making maximum expression, all types of triggers go off on the interferon system, being like, this could be cancerous.

01:38:52.045 --> 01:38:53.145
Like, what the hell's going on here?

01:38:53.605 --> 01:38:56.806
You could get apoptosis, because you're expressing way too much protein in a particular cell.

01:38:57.266 --> 01:38:59.486
So they did a lot of things to jack up the expression.

01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:02.227
They put a beta-globin promoter on there, which is a pretty aggressive promoter.

01:39:02.824 --> 01:39:06.706
They then codon optimized it, which didn't need to be done, in my opinion.

01:39:07.126 --> 01:39:09.307
And that creates all types of other problems.

01:39:09.347 --> 01:39:15.030
When you codon optimize it, you don't know that the translation is going to go at the same speed anymore.

01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:18.952
It may slow down due to all types of knots in the RNA you've created by doing this.

01:39:19.352 --> 01:39:27.056
Like there are quadruplex G structures now that we know in the RNA that are much more frequent in the messenger RNAs than they are in the actual natural virus.

01:39:27.366 --> 01:39:29.627
Does that make error rate go up then too, or?

01:39:29.687 --> 01:39:31.288
It makes translation error go up.

01:39:31.468 --> 01:39:38.152
It also attracts other types of regulatory proteins to the molecules because quadriplex G structures look like telomeres.

01:39:38.493 --> 01:39:40.574
And so telomeres are involved in sensitance.

01:39:41.454 --> 01:39:43.816
If you look at telomeres, they're all quadriplex Gs.

01:39:44.236 --> 01:39:44.997
Sensitance.

01:39:45.337 --> 01:39:46.477
I think it's senescence.

01:39:49.008 --> 01:39:53.351
I think it's very interesting that he mispronounces that word or pronounces it in that funny way.

01:39:54.431 --> 01:39:57.413
Telomeres is Brett Weinstein's little hat.

01:39:58.654 --> 01:40:00.795
Also a very interesting thing to drop there.

01:40:03.477 --> 01:40:04.277
It's not random.

01:40:05.618 --> 01:40:06.959
I assure you it's not random.

01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:07.999
It's really hilarious.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.763
And so those things recruit proteins that are involved in the life cycle of the cell, that are involved in cancer.

01:40:14.943 --> 01:40:15.704
Look at my eyes.

01:40:16.809 --> 01:40:25.851
So there's actually proteins in SARS that are attracted to, there's the NSP13 protein that's attracted to quadriplegics, right?

01:40:25.891 --> 01:40:36.454
So they now have much, I think there's like four in the natural virus that goes to like maybe nine and into the teens on the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine.

01:40:36.474 --> 01:40:43.936
So they're creating a lot more of these stall points and translation and other biological motifs that might alter the biochemistry of the cell.

01:40:44.804 --> 01:40:51.906
Uh, the other thing that they did is they put a, a universal base in there, uh, known as pseudo-uridine.

01:40:52.326 --> 01:40:52.566
All right.

01:40:53.487 --> 01:40:54.787
And many, you've probably heard about this.

01:40:54.827 --> 01:41:00.429
The patents go to UPenn and, uh, I've never held it, heard it called a universal base before though.

01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.969
It's a degenerate base.

01:41:02.009 --> 01:41:02.129
Yes.

01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:08.231
So it binds to, they won't call it that, but I built DNA sequencers on degenerate bases and those things were on a radar for a reason.

01:41:08.911 --> 01:41:09.432
Uh, yeah.

01:41:09.472 --> 01:41:13.753
So it binds to, uh, it has pseudo-uridine being uracil.

01:41:15.232 --> 01:41:17.756
should have, it's like a fine replacement.

01:41:17.816 --> 01:41:18.117
Okay.

01:41:18.177 --> 01:41:20.901
So it should have a, it should have one of these 80 pairs.

01:41:21.422 --> 01:41:21.903
Right.

01:41:22.263 --> 01:41:26.370
And unfortunately this thing also binds to G. It also binds to itself.

01:41:26.892 --> 01:41:30.974
It also has some binding to cytosine.

01:41:31.094 --> 01:41:34.116
So this means that it's a very, very sticky base.

01:41:34.396 --> 01:41:36.477
It can flip around and bind.

01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:38.738
If you actually look at its glycosic bond.

01:41:38.798 --> 01:41:42.340
And I don't want to sound like an idiot, but this is the first time I've ever heard this for me.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.363
I always just assumed it was a chemically different substitute for a single base.

01:41:48.164 --> 01:41:48.484
It does.

01:41:48.564 --> 01:41:49.364
It replaces it.

01:41:49.384 --> 01:41:53.867
They're replacing all of the use with this because it's more RNase resistant.

01:41:54.147 --> 01:41:54.447
Okay.

01:41:54.487 --> 01:41:55.748
So it doesn't degrade as much.

01:41:55.808 --> 01:41:56.348
So that meant,

01:41:56.704 --> 01:42:03.749
So you've now got an RNA, you've codon optimized it, you put a heavy promoter on it, and now you also took away the breaks.

01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:12.455
The breaks are usually RNAs that come in and chew up these messenger RNAs, but they put- I think he's also confusing us here when he says promoter.

01:42:14.317 --> 01:42:22.863
I actually think that this is something that I didn't hear before, but this is confusing because I don't think the RNA in the shot contains a promoter.

01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:27.875
because it's RNA, it would just be translated.

01:42:28.735 --> 01:42:31.536
I think it's gotta have something on it, but it's not a promoter.

01:42:32.557 --> 01:42:43.621
A promoter is a sequence that comes before a gene that causes the gene to be expressed, attracts the translation material or the translation enzyme.

01:42:43.662 --> 01:42:50.184
So a promoter on an RNA molecule, I don't think that's accurate.

01:42:50.424 --> 01:42:54.046
I think they use a promoter on the DNA that they use to produce the RNA.

01:42:56.863 --> 01:42:58.885
I don't think that promoter gets translated.

01:43:00.346 --> 01:43:04.831
I do think that there is some level of confusion here and making, you know, I don't understand.

01:43:04.931 --> 01:43:06.112
Obviously, I don't understand.

01:43:06.973 --> 01:43:09.035
But I understand now better than I did then.

01:43:09.095 --> 01:43:10.877
And I think that this is something wrong.

01:43:10.917 --> 01:43:11.938
There's something wrong here.

01:43:12.498 --> 01:43:18.499
was saying they put a very strong promoter on it, because that still would only be during the production stage.

01:43:18.519 --> 01:43:23.941
The mRNA that's put inside of people doesn't have a beta-actin promoter.

01:43:23.961 --> 01:43:27.982
As far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong, iron sharpens iron, right?

01:43:28.522 --> 01:43:32.083
Let's make sure if I'm wrong about that, but I think this is wrong.

01:43:32.283 --> 01:43:36.644
A long poly-A tail on this, and they put these pseudouridines in there so that the RNases can't touch it.

01:43:37.064 --> 01:43:41.285
Now, there's a consequence to doing that, is when you camouflage these things from RNases,

01:43:41.854 --> 01:43:48.956
You also start triggering a lot of the toll receptors to get malfunctioned, like toll receptor 3, 7, and 8 could all scurry with pseudo-uridine.

01:43:49.036 --> 01:43:51.776
But that's a separate topic we can bench for later.

01:43:51.816 --> 01:43:58.158
The thing I want to get across is that the base that they have in there is not very specific.

01:43:58.398 --> 01:44:02.299
And so when you don't have specific binding, you can get all types of misbinding.

01:44:02.739 --> 01:44:04.720
You can get all types of hairpin formations to form.

01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.160
But more importantly,

01:44:07.561 --> 01:44:13.648
This will create errors in replication and DNA, but the errors that are actually orders of magnitude more frequent are errors in translation.

01:44:14.729 --> 01:44:18.313
There actually has to be quite a bit of

01:44:19.455 --> 01:44:22.336
of cross-promotion in a negative way.

01:44:23.096 --> 01:44:36.380
So what you actually will see also today, this is a message for Jung, Insif, or I don't know how to say your name, because they also have bad guys that they are working together with.

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.801
And so in this case, that Norman guy from

01:44:40.117 --> 01:44:43.419
He's from Poland and he used to work for the CDC.

01:44:43.459 --> 01:44:48.641
That guy has been trashing me since I saw him on the internet.

01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:53.964
And it's trashing me about clones and about the idea that RNA virology is fake.

01:44:54.044 --> 01:44:57.126
He is so evil, so nasty about it.

01:44:58.146 --> 01:44:59.007
And it's ridiculous.

01:44:59.207 --> 01:45:02.788
It's absolutely ridiculous because there's an added little bit that you don't know.

01:45:03.249 --> 01:45:09.212
And that is that you may not be aware, but Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler

01:45:10.072 --> 01:45:19.010
actually did a podcast with that Norman guy and tried to get him to talk to me in private, but he wouldn't.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:29.885
And that was around the same time that Jonathan Engler and they were writing this stupid virology review on Substack that I hated and that I got, it all happened at the same time.

01:45:30.346 --> 01:45:32.247
And Norman was part of this little group.

01:45:32.287 --> 01:45:39.171
They were trying to get me to accept Norman as a good guy, expert, and I should talk to him in private.

01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:46.535
But on X, Norman had already called me a clown many times in cooperation with some of the mouse army.

01:45:46.555 --> 01:45:48.036
And so it was already obvious

01:45:49.588 --> 01:45:59.832
And so that guy is now, I think, pretending to be opposed to Kevin McKernan, because they need to have opposition that they can argue with, because they can't argue with me.

01:46:00.832 --> 01:46:04.993
I know that sounds very egoistic, but that's really what's happening right now.

01:46:05.654 --> 01:46:11.576
These people have to ignore us, because they can't discuss the biology that we are discussing.

01:46:12.386 --> 01:46:20.448
and they can't discuss their history as we are discussing it, or it will reveal that they have run out the clock on our college kids.

01:46:22.628 --> 01:46:24.949
Our days then have to come in and read this thing.

01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:30.210
And when you have universal basis in there, they get all confused, and their translation errors go through the roof.

01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:33.090
And there's a couple of papers I can point you to.

01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:34.370
You're bumping your microphone or something.

01:46:34.831 --> 01:46:35.271
Oh, I am.

01:46:35.291 --> 01:46:35.831
My hands are on it.

01:46:35.851 --> 01:46:37.151
Sorry, there must be a- Oh, it's OK.

01:46:37.611 --> 01:46:38.291
Sorry.

01:46:39.512 --> 01:46:41.432
He's getting a little nervous, huh?

01:46:42.325 --> 01:46:43.326
I'm getting a little nervous.

01:46:43.346 --> 01:46:49.830
When you have this universal base in there, it not only confuses polymerases, but it more readily confuses the tRNAs and the ribosomes.

01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:53.452
They have a much harder job of having to put these triplet codons in there.

01:46:53.873 --> 01:47:02.418
And when one of the bases is mismatching to multiple different bases, the transcription, I'm sorry, translation errors go through the roof.

01:47:02.878 --> 01:47:03.479
Right.

01:47:03.979 --> 01:47:07.241
Now there's a paper on there that tries to measure these translation errors with pseudouridine.

01:47:07.281 --> 01:47:11.564
And they measure like, they can detect it when there's like one pseudouridine in there.

01:47:12.239 --> 01:47:16.321
And what we know from these mRNAs, every uracil is replaced.

01:47:17.122 --> 01:47:20.723
So there, that's a very interesting point that he makes, but never is made again.

01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:29.928
There's a paper out there, he says, that shows something to do with, what did he say?

01:47:29.988 --> 01:47:39.253
That shows that even one pseudouridine, if there's only one pseudouridine in there, they can detect

01:47:41.974 --> 01:47:44.516
they can detect the wobbling base.

01:47:44.877 --> 01:47:47.018
That's a very interesting statement to make, right?

01:47:47.058 --> 01:47:56.467
Because if that's the case, then we're really in big trouble because, I'm just gonna put this in here anyway, I don't care.

01:47:57.488 --> 01:48:05.635
And I'm gonna, let me see where I am on this video.

01:48:05.775 --> 01:48:06.696
Hold on one second.

01:48:06.776 --> 01:48:07.917
Hopefully it will start again.

01:48:07.937 --> 01:48:08.677
Oh no, it won't.

01:48:10.635 --> 01:48:15.478
Um, I, that's it.

01:48:15.938 --> 01:48:17.479
Um, I got to start that a little bit over.

01:48:17.519 --> 01:48:18.320
I apologize.

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:22.402
I really wanted to put this in there, so I'm going to put it, I didn't dare to do it before, but I'm going to do it now.

01:48:22.582 --> 01:48:24.543
Um, I get ahead here.

01:48:24.864 --> 01:48:29.366
Peptide on the other end of that, that could get expressed as a chimeric protein.

01:48:29.386 --> 01:48:30.707
We've got no evidence for this in vivo.

01:48:30.727 --> 01:48:31.928
This is just all in silica.

01:48:31.948 --> 01:48:35.050
There's no way that thing creates high.

01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:40.133
You just said that you just said that they could detect the translation errors when there was only one.

01:48:40.697 --> 01:48:40.997
Yes.

01:48:41.257 --> 01:48:43.299
And these things have replaced all of them.

01:48:44.219 --> 01:48:47.101
So that's a huge statement.

01:48:47.461 --> 01:48:50.283
Again, I'm, I'm not, I'm learning a lot of this for the first time.

01:48:50.343 --> 01:48:52.384
I did not realize that this was this awful.

01:48:52.624 --> 01:48:54.145
Um, wow.

01:48:54.926 --> 01:49:04.832
Now that here's another thing that's really spooky about at least the Pfizer one is there's some papers out there that show when you put pseudo-uridine in the stop codons, the ribosomes read through it.

01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:07.170
and they sometimes frame shift on the way.

01:49:07.851 --> 01:49:08.632
So here we go.

01:49:09.753 --> 01:49:12.075
The ribosomes will read through it.

01:49:12.195 --> 01:49:28.471
And now, especially with Pfizer, this is interesting because Pfizer has other sequences on the end that could get translated into proteins we don't know, which a couple of years from now, from December of 2021, will become the translation of SV40.

01:49:32.529 --> 01:49:33.029
Do you see?

01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:39.012
He's actually suggesting that right now, he couldn't figure out that it was SV40.

01:49:39.432 --> 01:49:46.795
Right now, he wasn't smart enough to drop the sequence into BLAST and have it map the parts of the sequence.

01:49:47.175 --> 01:49:48.236
He didn't do it yet.

01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:55.799
He wasn't insightful enough as a geneticist to say, hey, wait, let's see the sequence that Pfizer published.

01:49:55.819 --> 01:49:56.780
Let's see what it looks like.

01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.200
Let's see.

01:50:00.137 --> 01:50:00.957
Isn't that interesting?

01:50:01.018 --> 01:50:05.680
He knows what's there, but he doesn't know how to figure it out or what it means or something.

01:50:06.541 --> 01:50:10.103
But he knows there's extra there, especially in the Pfizer one, not in the Moderna.

01:50:10.463 --> 01:50:12.104
The Moderna actually worked out great.

01:50:12.124 --> 01:50:15.606
We're going to use the Moderna model to fix the Pfizer model in five years.

01:50:15.986 --> 01:50:18.847
So he's got to seed the narrative in the right way with this character.

01:50:20.628 --> 01:50:20.869
True.

01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:28.913
It means they keep translating the RNA sequence that's past the double stop codon.

01:50:30.009 --> 01:50:35.873
So you have to ask what's on the three prime end of the Pfizer UTR, like what do they have back there?

01:50:36.473 --> 01:50:37.914
And we went and scanned all those things.

01:50:37.934 --> 01:50:43.858
And there's actually a human peptide on the other end of that that could get expressed as a chimeric protein.

01:50:43.878 --> 01:50:45.179
We've got no evidence for this in vivo.

01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:47.941
This is just all in silica stuff that we're looking at.

01:50:47.961 --> 01:50:50.322
Like if it- So what human protein is it?

01:50:50.462 --> 01:50:51.843
I wonder why he won't say that.

01:50:51.903 --> 01:50:52.724
Isn't that strange?

01:50:53.864 --> 01:50:57.166
If pseudouridine ablates that SOP codon, what does it read into?

01:50:57.747 --> 01:50:59.488
And it reads into a fairly long peptide

01:51:00.223 --> 01:51:04.273
that has some homology to GP 130, but we don't know much more about it.

01:51:04.333 --> 01:51:08.402
The data in NCBI is pretty sparse on whatever that thing is, but

01:51:09.225 --> 01:51:16.270
Some of that's in the paper we put together with Peter McCullough as to what human peptide is and what does that mean?

01:51:16.391 --> 01:51:21.615
Because writing papers with Peter McCullough about genomes makes perfect sense in 2021.

01:51:22.335 --> 01:51:34.864
Why wouldn't the cardiologist that spoke out about the usefulness of hydroxy, oh wait, the non-dangerousness of hydroxychloroquine, why would he be the guy that this guy publishes data with?

01:51:35.545 --> 01:51:36.626
Why not Robert Malone?

01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:38.991
Why not Steve Kirsch?

01:51:39.891 --> 01:51:41.873
Why not any other random person?

01:51:42.333 --> 01:51:43.313
Why Peter McCullough?

01:51:45.095 --> 01:51:57.302
That's a very relevant question that Jay in 2021 wasn't able to answer because Jay still thought that all these people were on the same good guy team and the people we needed to worry about were Liana Nguyen and Rochelle Walensky.

01:51:59.664 --> 01:52:01.425
That's who that guy is right there.

01:52:02.205 --> 01:52:06.008
He still thinks that Liana Nguyen and Rochelle Walensky, those are the bad guys.

01:52:07.148 --> 01:52:14.933
This guy is as good as Robert Malone and as good as Peter McCullough and Pierre Coderre, all part of the same fundamental biology team.

01:52:15.874 --> 01:52:19.076
It's Liana Nguyen and Peter Daszak that we have to worry about.

01:52:19.116 --> 01:52:19.956
That's where I was here.

01:52:19.996 --> 01:52:20.857
I still have that.

01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:23.638
Trust me, I remember.

01:52:26.886 --> 01:52:32.028
There's some error rate here, and I'm not suggesting every single spike protein that comes off this mRNA is going to do this.

01:52:32.068 --> 01:52:38.410
These error rates happen at frequencies that are very low, but you have to keep them in context to how many molecules they're injecting into you.

01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:41.731
They're injecting trillions of these things into you, right?

01:52:42.331 --> 01:52:49.574
So those numbers, times an error rate, some I've seen 10 to the minus four, 10 to the minus fifth rate, they matter.

01:52:49.834 --> 01:52:50.194
They matter.

01:52:50.214 --> 01:52:55.756
You're going to get, you could get chimeric proteins that come out of this that have human SARS chimeras,

01:52:56.468 --> 01:52:57.529
And what does it do?

01:52:57.549 --> 01:52:59.090
Does it create autoantibody issues?

01:52:59.110 --> 01:53:00.551
Does that create autoimmune issues?

01:53:01.792 --> 01:53:06.035
I mean, the long story short is these are all hypotheses that haven't been explored.

01:53:06.055 --> 01:53:09.897
They're in silica, but you do have to ask why.

01:53:10.037 --> 01:53:17.102
My hypothesis about McCullough is that he was one of these people who was recruited early because it was an emergency and he believed it.

01:53:18.183 --> 01:53:22.166
He believed in the potential of a lab leak and he was probably told that it was likely.

01:53:23.936 --> 01:53:26.258
He probably believed some of the things that were happening.

01:53:27.499 --> 01:53:37.707
But I do think that Peter McCullough is also crafty enough to know that there was a population pyramid problem approaching and that we might need an excuse to manage it.

01:53:39.608 --> 01:53:45.233
I think he's also smart enough to know at some point in time that he was taken by these people and used by these people.

01:53:45.273 --> 01:53:47.435
And that's why he's no longer in favor with them.

01:53:47.896 --> 01:53:53.081
That's why he was the first one to come out and say, you know, if I did it all over again, I don't think I'd give my kids any vaccines.

01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:57.305
The only person in that whole group who had any guts to say that first was him.

01:53:58.427 --> 01:54:03.931
And it was only months and months and months later that these other people came out and started saying it, maybe even years later.

01:54:04.391 --> 01:54:10.115
Peter McCullough was ahead of that curve by a long ways with regard to the dissident movement of COVID.

01:54:11.135 --> 01:54:15.338
And many of them still haven't even approached the possibility of saying those words out loud.

01:54:17.139 --> 01:54:21.562
I think Peter McCullough regrets participating and is probably not able to pull out of it anymore.

01:54:21.602 --> 01:54:23.103
And I think there are a lot of people like that.

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:24.704
There have to be.

01:54:25.805 --> 01:54:27.066
It's the only way to explain it.

01:54:28.131 --> 01:54:31.734
They've seen behind the curtain and they know what happens to people who tell that story.

01:54:34.537 --> 01:54:35.278
They get canceled.

01:54:35.318 --> 01:54:36.619
They don't have to get eliminated.

01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:37.460
They get canceled.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.944
Their fame, their fortune, their comfort will completely disappear.

01:54:44.206 --> 01:54:54.015
They'll be back to renting a house and begging for donations or hoping that their sub stack doesn't lose subscribers or anything else that's sustaining them right now.

01:54:55.964 --> 01:55:00.726
the stipends that they get from Brownstone or something like that will dry up instantly.

01:55:03.627 --> 01:55:09.129
Maybe your very lucrative job as a staff scientist will be ended because you say the wrong name twice on your stream.

01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.549
Who knows?

01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:11.270
But that's how this works.

01:55:12.574 --> 01:55:28.363
People that you see rising in social media are the people that are approved acolytes that can control the narrative and direct it in the way that it needs to go so that the most adults are coerced into accepting that the reality is you're gonna be experimental animals in a generation.

01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:39.610
What did Pfizer and Moderna, these people, get away with getting the prodrug certified without ever having to show their hand on what the hell these things make in human cells?

01:55:41.461 --> 01:55:52.231
You know, that's, I've dug up a couple of papers in that paper with Peter on, okay, there's a couple other images in papers that look like this could be happening.

01:55:52.271 --> 01:55:58.257
Like when you ever, there's one great paper out there, I think from Bancel that looks at like spikes, spike proteins that are expressed in exosomes, right?

01:55:59.818 --> 01:56:02.540
In the blood, they showed them like four months later, really interesting paper.

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.465
They do have some like SDS page images of what they, of those exosomes and they're smeary.

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:19.588
And then there's another paper we found from Jiang et al that showed these, showing fragments, and the fragments that were getting expressed at the spike protein, they weren't all full length.

01:56:20.088 --> 01:56:23.390
They were different based on the cell fraction they isolated them from, right?

01:56:24.131 --> 01:56:27.813
And I think that was even with the DNA vaccine that didn't have the pseudouridine problems, right?

01:56:27.853 --> 01:56:32.677
So you can imagine that would get even worse if you had all these other complications put in there.

01:56:34.003 --> 01:56:37.786
My concern is we don't really know what these vaccines are producing.

01:56:37.806 --> 01:56:38.787
We don't know the fidelity of it.

01:56:39.308 --> 01:56:46.073
We suspect there's some spike protein because there's motifs that look like spike proteins because antibody studies, but we only have antibodies.

01:56:46.633 --> 01:56:48.475
So it's kind of like the people, you know,

01:56:48.908 --> 01:56:51.370
blindfolded doctors touching the elephant, right?

01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:53.872
You know, you got some similarity, fine.

01:56:54.813 --> 01:56:59.157
But we don't precisely know the diversity of what's getting expressed in humans.

01:56:59.837 --> 01:57:16.591
And we- So the only argument that could be made by CHD and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and John Baldwin, that this guy is not saying all of this now,

01:57:17.452 --> 01:57:28.000
is because they think that the double-stranded DNA contamination is a legal way that they can qualify the countermeasures as being crimes.

01:57:30.282 --> 01:57:35.025
Otherwise, objecting to the methodology on its face is the way to go.

01:57:35.385 --> 01:57:44.472
And there's actually pretense in American law in an Idaho case where they challenged the biology of vaccination on its face, and it is supported.

01:57:45.233 --> 01:57:46.714
The case was won.

01:57:49.790 --> 01:58:03.477
Now, you're gonna have to do your own research to find that case and understand why it's not significant to today, but it kind of is, why it's important to understand that none of these people talk about it, why these people don't say strict scrutiny, and the rational basis test is for the same reason.

01:58:07.859 --> 01:58:18.204
We have an elaborate, an elaborate operation has been run on us by people who have agreed to follow a script that will end with us being

01:58:19.893 --> 01:58:35.005
unwittingly teaching our kids this mythology that includes AIDS and coronaviruses and RNA pandemics and antibodies that are immunity and vaccination that is the best invention in medicine's history.

01:58:35.806 --> 01:58:39.949
You should be concerned about that because these LNPs don't target particular cell lines, they go everywhere.

01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:43.412
So that's a much broader problem.

01:58:43.552 --> 01:58:45.674
If you knew that, okay, we're expressing

01:58:46.334 --> 01:58:59.177
Some fragmented spikes, but we've got them well-characterized, the data's public, and they're going only to cell lines that the virus sees, like ACE2 expressing cell lines or CD147 expressing cell lines.

01:58:59.197 --> 01:59:01.358
Fine, you've got an understood complexity of the problem.

01:59:01.758 --> 01:59:04.559
When you start using these LMPs, they transfect every cell they touch.

01:59:05.159 --> 01:59:14.061
So now you've got to worry about not just what does spike toxicity do in those, what does all the degenerate products of low-fidelity spike expression do to many more cell lines?

01:59:14.972 --> 01:59:20.354
it can really blow up like the complexity of the problem and even perhaps the symptomatology, right?

01:59:20.994 --> 01:59:22.915
So why isn't he saying this anymore?

01:59:22.995 --> 01:59:24.436
Why isn't he saying this anymore?

01:59:24.496 --> 01:59:31.298
Why is he focusing specifically on turbo cancer and double-stranded DNA and the SV40?

01:59:33.039 --> 01:59:33.379
Why?

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:38.841
Why is he saying this to me and no one else ever?

01:59:43.851 --> 01:59:44.672
Right, right.

01:59:44.752 --> 01:59:55.037
It's this is blowing my mind because it didn't really The, the, the extent to which this this adds variables is really breathtaking actually

01:59:56.238 --> 02:00:04.260
It's been frustrating me because I've heard so many arguments online that, oh, it's just the spike protein that's identical to what's in the virus.

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.560
No biggie, right?

02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:13.882
So you shouldn't, your symptoms, your adverse event profile should be a subset of what you get from the virus because we're giving you a subset of the virus.

02:00:14.002 --> 02:00:17.463
We're not giving you the full replicative competent virus.

02:00:18.663 --> 02:00:25.685
I don't think that theory should be accepted blindly because we're injecting these things in a more

02:00:26.144 --> 02:00:29.405
varied cell lines, we are rejecting them, I think, at a higher concentration.

02:00:29.445 --> 02:00:33.066
I mean, the way, how do you read those antibody studies, right?

02:00:33.086 --> 02:00:37.327
You see that they have higher antibody expression against spike, right?

02:00:37.888 --> 02:00:39.948
I don't read that as like a better immune response.

02:00:39.988 --> 02:00:41.849
I read that as you're expressing more spike.

02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:46.110
And so the antibodies are probably a proxy to the expression level of spike.

02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:47.550
And is that a good thing?

02:00:48.511 --> 02:00:52.892
Do you really need massive amounts of spike protein to build an immune response?

02:00:53.439 --> 02:00:56.160
because we have to be careful here, spike's the toxic peptide.

02:00:56.201 --> 02:00:59.963
So we're in this window like cancer treatment where we're trying to kill.

02:01:00.423 --> 02:01:02.764
Spike is the toxic peptide.

02:01:03.144 --> 02:01:11.469
It's exactly the illusion that they were sent in to say so that the effects of transfection would be confused with the spike.

02:01:13.052 --> 02:01:15.613
The spike is toxic, not the methodology.

02:01:15.933 --> 02:01:17.593
The methodology isn't stupid.

02:01:17.653 --> 02:01:18.974
The choice of the spike was.

02:01:19.034 --> 02:01:20.774
The choice to alter the spike was.

02:01:21.394 --> 02:01:25.175
The choice to put in impure RNA was the mistake.

02:01:25.235 --> 02:01:28.876
The choice to put in contaminated RNA was the mistake.

02:01:28.936 --> 02:01:30.697
Do you see it, ladies and gentlemen?

02:01:31.277 --> 02:01:32.317
Please tell me you do.

02:01:35.445 --> 02:01:51.829
And am I right in my understanding, though, that actually if you go with this idea that antibodies are neutralizing the spike and that's how you build immunity in their cartoon world, then aren't they only really concerned about antibodies that have some specificity for the receptor binding domain?

02:01:51.869 --> 02:01:55.130
This leaves an awful lot of useless epitopes in that.

02:01:55.874 --> 02:01:56.535
It does, yeah.

02:01:56.675 --> 02:02:06.684
And I don't know if you saw that recent paper that when they serially applied the same vaccination that the actual antibodies got more and more specific to the Wuhan type 1.

02:02:06.724 --> 02:02:10.207
So they're kind of making matters worse by boosting.

02:02:11.148 --> 02:02:15.512
At least they're making it worse so the patients are less tolerant to future variants by boosting.

02:02:16.266 --> 02:02:21.408
So here he is seeding the narrative that Luigi Warren would seed in my head as well.

02:02:22.308 --> 02:02:24.689
Maybe he had already seeded in my head by this time.

02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:32.352
Oh, no, of course, already a year into my head this time that Khertub VandenBosch was right that the virus could be manipulated, could be

02:02:33.052 --> 02:02:38.474
could be, the evolution of the virus could be influenced by the mass vaccination campaign.

02:02:38.994 --> 02:02:45.937
And because we were making very specific immunity to Wuhan 1, then we were for sure going to force the virus to change from Wuhan 1.

02:02:46.197 --> 02:02:47.278
That's where we are right now.

02:02:47.318 --> 02:02:48.378
Listen.

02:02:48.999 --> 02:02:53.520
So I'm, yeah, there's a host of problems with what they're, what they're doing on that front.

02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:59.883
But I, so I hope someone can prove me wrong and find more papers, anything related to

02:03:00.985 --> 02:03:02.866
what proteins actually get expressed.

02:03:03.026 --> 02:03:15.073
I would have thought that if we have 5 million SARS genomes in NCBI, and maybe there's 2 million NCBI, but there's 5 million in G-Set, right?

02:03:15.873 --> 02:03:20.736
How many sequence QCs do we have the loss on these vaccines?

02:03:20.756 --> 02:03:25.178
5 million sequences we already have of the virus by the end of 2021.

02:03:26.059 --> 02:03:26.759
Think about that.

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.721
That's also just part of the enchantment.

02:03:32.133 --> 02:03:34.835
Wow, we have five million sequences already.

02:03:34.915 --> 02:03:36.616
That's a lot of viruses we've found.

02:03:37.016 --> 02:03:39.038
We've been tracking this thing for a long time.

02:03:39.098 --> 02:03:42.680
It's so overwhelming how much data there is to process.

02:03:44.421 --> 02:03:45.442
It actually hurts my eyes.

02:03:46.282 --> 02:03:48.964
I can find one, like from Andy Fire's lab.

02:03:49.385 --> 02:03:50.966
And they didn't even put out the raw reads.

02:03:51.006 --> 02:03:52.347
They put out the consensus sequence.

02:03:52.367 --> 02:03:56.009
So you can't really dig into some of this nuance and how many variations are actually in there.

02:03:57.098 --> 02:04:00.500
So you would think there would be sequence QC locked a lot in all these vaccines.

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:08.883
You would also think that the evidence of when you transfect this into humans, what's the peptide that comes out with mass spec profiles in the peptides, like protein sequencing.

02:04:09.163 --> 02:04:10.484
Do you hear the enchantment there?

02:04:10.564 --> 02:04:14.706
When you transfect this into humans.

02:04:17.767 --> 02:04:18.548
Stop lying!

02:04:19.768 --> 02:04:21.629
Not when you transfect humans.

02:04:23.391 --> 02:04:29.472
Not when you transfect humans, but when you transfect this into humans.

02:04:31.093 --> 02:04:37.734
And so he is actually suggesting to me that it's not transfection, but it is what you transfect.

02:04:38.994 --> 02:04:40.034
And that is the lie.

02:04:40.274 --> 02:04:42.935
That is at the heart of my message.

02:04:43.615 --> 02:04:47.576
Transfection of healthy humans was criminal.

02:04:48.176 --> 02:04:50.076
Not transfection to a spike.

02:04:51.737 --> 02:04:52.437
Transfection.

02:04:57.169 --> 02:05:00.610
Why don't we know precisely what these are?

02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:03.711
The protein sequencing gives you some information about what's going on.

02:05:03.751 --> 02:05:05.392
It doesn't necessarily tell you how things fold.

02:05:05.632 --> 02:05:11.114
I mean, one of the challenges in codon optimization is you do change the rate of translation when you do this.

02:05:11.534 --> 02:05:16.555
And there's lots of papers out there showing that when you change the rate of translation, you can alter the folding.

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.196
It's particularly true when you hit double prolines.

02:05:19.216 --> 02:05:21.877
And there are a lot of double prolines in the spike protein, right?

02:05:21.957 --> 02:05:25.238
So those things end up stalling translation

02:05:26.042 --> 02:05:29.305
and your code on usage really matters across those things.

02:05:29.465 --> 02:05:45.821
But don't you find it also so frustrating that there are so many people that seem to have as much sort of intimate sequence gene type data, not data, but knowledge and understanding as yourself, but then focus it all on

02:05:46.600 --> 02:06:09.208
on proving that the virus didn't come from a laboratory and look at the sequence of the virus and and wax intellectual about all of this stuff but not once turn their this same keen eye to the PCR tests to the to the vaccine or to the to the transfection and think the same with the same sharp edge i just don't get it i i think it's it's um

02:06:10.874 --> 02:06:21.721
I think it's a hierarchy of funding that drives all that, that you'll see whether it's funding from NIH, NIAID, or from Gates, that all of those actors never want to attack the narrative.

02:06:22.602 --> 02:06:30.346
And if you start raising the questions like, hey, we've injected a- And so what is he proposing here, that he's attacking the narrative?

02:06:32.268 --> 02:06:34.169
They don't attack the narrative, but I do.

02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:38.480
And that's the limited spectrum of debate getting reinforced.

02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:39.461
Oh, but he's a hero.

02:06:39.821 --> 02:06:40.941
Those guys aren't a hero.

02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:41.821
He's a hero.

02:06:41.881 --> 02:06:43.801
So if I support him, I'm also a hero.

02:06:44.201 --> 02:06:47.822
If I ask the questions that he's got me curious about, I'm also a hero.

02:06:50.783 --> 02:06:53.103
Both teams are playing against us.

02:06:53.123 --> 02:06:54.163
A billion people with this.

02:06:54.203 --> 02:06:56.243
Shouldn't we have more sequence data on the actual vaccine?

02:06:57.084 --> 02:07:03.805
Like, you know, like you guys are doing a great job sequencing all those viruses and putting in public, but when are you going to turn your attention to what you're injecting into people forcefully?

02:07:05.643 --> 02:07:07.184
they turn that into a conspiracy theory.

02:07:07.264 --> 02:07:08.785
They can't question it, they can't look at it.

02:07:08.845 --> 02:07:16.210
But if you were neutral and not in this and not funded, which I'm assuming both you and I are in that camp and a variety of other genomicists are in that camp.

02:07:16.431 --> 02:07:28.299
The guy who was caught up in the house scheme was Rainer Fulmer, Fuller, Fulmert of the Coronavirus Investigation Committee in Germany, not Kurt von den Bosch.

02:07:28.639 --> 02:07:32.101
We look at a signal, you should have an equal number of sequences on both sides of this fence.

02:07:32.202 --> 02:07:34.143
The virus is really important to see where it's going,

02:07:34.656 --> 02:07:41.821
If we don't have particularly when there's liability free mandated injections going on, and there's no QC, and when you ask for it, they mock you as an anti-vaxxer.

02:07:43.462 --> 02:07:44.503
There's something really wrong there.

02:07:45.203 --> 02:07:49.326
Yeah, I think that's a really nice way to put it too.

02:07:49.947 --> 02:07:54.250
Are you in regular contact with Michael Yeadon since this or not really at all?

02:07:55.354 --> 02:08:10.101
We were in a little bit more contact when we were doing the PCR stuff, but I haven't I've seen him on a couple I'm on so many Twitter threads and whatnot his name comes by he got I'm on so many Twitter threads and whatnot because it's his full-time job I thought he had a company.

02:08:10.161 --> 02:08:12.322
I thought his brothers were trying to cure cancer.

02:08:12.782 --> 02:08:13.503
What in the hell?

02:08:14.603 --> 02:08:20.366
How does this guy with a hundred million dollar house on the Atlantic Ocean have so much time to be on social media?

02:08:20.386 --> 02:08:21.967
Calling me chemtrail retarded

02:08:23.646 --> 02:08:24.446
Do you see it yet?

02:08:24.686 --> 02:08:25.667
Do you see it yet?

02:08:25.707 --> 02:08:27.567
This guy called me chemtrail retarded.

02:08:27.587 --> 02:08:30.728
I kicked off the Twitter.

02:08:30.748 --> 02:08:32.749
So I haven't seen as much of him since he's off of Twitter.

02:08:32.789 --> 02:08:36.090
But there's a couple other email threads that I'm on that he's there as well.

02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:39.691
But he did, he brought up some concern, I think over

02:08:40.506 --> 02:08:41.967
What was it, syncytia-1 or something?

02:08:42.067 --> 02:08:44.710
It was a short amino acid sequence that he got a little bit flamed for.

02:08:45.931 --> 02:08:49.494
But- He's still just out there every day trying to push it.

02:08:49.554 --> 02:08:52.516
I just didn't- Syncytin is what he got pushed for.

02:08:52.597 --> 02:08:58.121
And syncytin has some homology to the fusion protein or something like that.

02:08:58.141 --> 02:08:58.442
I don't know.

02:08:59.242 --> 02:09:06.629
No, I think him and Peter McCullough and yourself and everybody who brings some kind of real

02:09:08.194 --> 02:09:14.100
real life experience to this and isn't afraid to speak out about the incongruencies I think is part of the solution.

02:09:14.161 --> 02:09:22.450
And I don't know, I've been following you for a long time on Twitter now since I figured out that you were one of the guys on that original

02:09:23.143 --> 02:09:23.843
Jorsten thing.

02:09:24.083 --> 02:09:35.428
And, uh, you know, I only did PCR in my, I did single cell PCR and tried to prove the, that there were different nicotinic receptors in different neurons that we were pulling out of the brain.

02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:42.371
And so most of my methodology, what problems we're just trying to convince people that we could get enough material to actually get a read.

02:09:42.391 --> 02:09:50.115
Um, they were fine with the fact that there were nicotinic receptors there that wasn't proving some kind of ghost or anything, but no,

02:09:51.134 --> 02:09:54.298
You know from doing that how sensitive it is.

02:09:54.719 --> 02:10:00.285
And how easy it is for somebody to say you don't have enough controls to know that you're saying what you're saying.

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:04.410
And so when this started, it was pretty mind-boggling to me that

02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:21.198
rather than starting with a small needle that I had just pulled out of a brain slice and I had just recorded from, so I knew what kind of cell I was pulling out, you could stick a swab up in my nose and make the same measurement that just seemed kind of impressive to me.

02:10:21.338 --> 02:10:21.678
I don't know.

02:10:22.358 --> 02:10:28.381
Yeah, I've not seen the LODs on this that get down to single DNA or something.

02:10:28.401 --> 02:10:29.042
LODs.

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:31.563
LODs.

02:10:31.763 --> 02:10:33.924
Oh my gosh, he's going to try and get me with another one.

02:10:39.618 --> 02:10:43.400
But they get close.

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:45.162
They get down to 100 copies usually.

02:10:45.202 --> 02:10:47.343
But the variance is sodium wide.

02:10:47.823 --> 02:10:48.343
Yeah, I see.

02:10:48.844 --> 02:10:54.827
You know, the LODs on this, they get down to single DNA or single copy levels, but they get close.

02:10:54.887 --> 02:10:59.790
They get down to 100 copies usually off those, sometimes 50 off of those nasal swabs.

02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.971
But the variance is sodium wide.

02:11:02.452 --> 02:11:02.972
Yeah, I see.

02:11:03.472 --> 02:11:05.333
You know, you get... No, I didn't.

02:11:05.414 --> 02:11:07.835
The CTs that were in the Datu paper were like,

02:11:08.764 --> 02:11:12.386
10 to 13 CTs from swab.

02:11:12.406 --> 02:11:18.008
I'm telling you, Kevin doesn't like talking to people that he's not sure he knows more than.

02:11:19.369 --> 02:11:24.351
He doesn't like talking to people who he's not sure what questions they're going to ask.

02:11:24.631 --> 02:11:26.052
That's who he doesn't like talking to.

02:11:26.392 --> 02:11:27.493
This was hard work for him.

02:11:27.933 --> 02:11:29.294
The swab on the internal control.

02:11:29.834 --> 02:11:33.275
And then you have everyone arguing over what the CT should be for the virus to cut.

02:11:33.295 --> 02:11:35.997
Well, if you don't normalize for how much you swab, you're never going to get that.

02:11:38.942 --> 02:11:41.063
I think my dog needs to go outside.

02:11:41.123 --> 02:11:41.583
Hold on.

02:11:41.603 --> 02:11:43.084
Be right back.

02:11:46.305 --> 02:11:47.146
He has a dog?

02:11:47.706 --> 02:11:49.047
I thought he had giant cats.

02:11:50.348 --> 02:11:51.068
That's weird.

02:11:52.249 --> 02:11:53.349
I didn't know he had a dog.

02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:55.871
I thought he just had giant cats.

02:11:57.271 --> 02:11:57.391
Wow.

02:11:58.732 --> 02:11:59.032
Wow.

02:11:59.733 --> 02:12:00.213
I just said wow.

02:12:06.547 --> 02:12:08.628
All right, he'll probably be back in a few minutes, so.

02:12:09.248 --> 02:12:09.968
No, no problem.

02:12:10.008 --> 02:12:14.070
I mean, I already really got a lot of what I wanted, and I'm really happy how quickly you got there.

02:12:14.130 --> 02:12:14.610
I am shocked.

02:12:14.630 --> 02:12:15.890
He has dogs?

02:12:16.410 --> 02:12:17.831
Did you know he has dogs?

02:12:17.851 --> 02:12:18.531
Man, oh man.

02:12:19.612 --> 02:12:25.414
I actually didn't, I actually didn't understand at all that, that pseudo-urine.

02:12:25.454 --> 02:12:26.394
Did you hear the dog?

02:12:26.454 --> 02:12:27.594
My dogs make noise.

02:12:28.475 --> 02:12:30.315
You can hear their paws on the floor.

02:12:30.655 --> 02:12:31.916
They bark sometimes.

02:12:34.337 --> 02:12:34.557
Hmm.

02:12:36.274 --> 02:12:39.917
Did he just say that he had a dog because he knows that I'm a dog person?

02:12:40.277 --> 02:12:42.459
Oh my goodness, I wonder what's going on here.

02:12:42.499 --> 02:12:43.900
He had less specificity.

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.482
Is he going to go back to the dog?

02:12:45.502 --> 02:12:46.723
Yeah, I'll forward you.

02:12:46.763 --> 02:12:55.049
There's some links in that preprint on OSF about this that show the pseudouridines base pairing with other molecules.

02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:58.853
It also facilitates quadriplex G formation because of this.

02:12:59.593 --> 02:13:03.717
So there's a host of problems with it that are just getting swept under the rug.

02:13:03.757 --> 02:13:05.178
And every time you raise this with people,

02:13:05.598 --> 02:13:12.343
You do understand that although a dog isn't significant, if we were to actually find out that he doesn't have a dog, this would be incredible.

02:13:13.644 --> 02:13:15.325
As dumb as it is, it would be incredible.

02:13:16.065 --> 02:13:17.687
What a stupid thing to lie about.

02:13:18.147 --> 02:13:20.108
I mean, really stupid thing to lie about.

02:13:20.148 --> 02:13:20.909
We need to find out.

02:13:20.949 --> 02:13:22.610
He's gotta have it on social media.

02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:29.995
It can't just be that he takes pictures of his cats if he's also got a dog that sleeps with them or the cats beat the shit out of the dog.

02:13:30.315 --> 02:13:32.297
There's gotta be some picture of the dog.

02:13:36.243 --> 02:13:40.045
They're just like, you're never anti-vaxxer.

02:13:40.185 --> 02:13:43.307
If it's too complicated, you can't, please.

02:13:43.447 --> 02:13:53.952
But can you explain a little bit why if the RNA folds in a particular shape that you're explaining, and then that shape attracts proteins that cause senescence?

02:13:54.679 --> 02:13:56.721
Well, they attract proteins associated with it.

02:13:56.761 --> 02:13:58.902
I don't know if it actually causes that yet.

02:13:59.022 --> 02:14:11.652
It's just, there's keys in the literature that show when you form lots of quadruplex G formations in RNA, you radically alter the translation rate and you alter a lot of the other cell signaling that goes on.

02:14:11.732 --> 02:14:14.875
So quadruplex Gs are a different form of base pairing.

02:14:14.915 --> 02:14:18.678
Most base pairings- The other person who pushed quadruplex Gs

02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:29.578
was Stephanie Seneff, also in the Steve Kerr Steering Committee, also on the 2023 St.

02:14:29.618 --> 02:14:34.342
Patrick's Day stream organized by John Bodwin that's still available on Rumble.

02:14:35.943 --> 02:14:44.049
No one else talking about quadruplex Gs except for me and Seneff and him, and I talked about it because of them.

02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:46.031
That's it, nobody else.

02:14:47.769 --> 02:14:53.875
is called Watson-Crick base pairing, where you get that nice double helix that you get about 10 bases per turn.

02:14:54.676 --> 02:15:01.142
When you get really GC-rich areas... I'm checking, I'm checking the link right now, because I need to know.

02:15:02.283 --> 02:15:07.869
Twitter says... Dog, okay, I see the dog right there.

02:15:15.646 --> 02:15:16.626
Your dog is a midget.

02:15:16.806 --> 02:15:17.627
Okay, that's fine.

02:15:17.947 --> 02:15:18.327
I got it.

02:15:18.927 --> 02:15:20.047
He's got a dog, great.

02:15:21.408 --> 02:15:32.951
What can happen is it's almost like, imagine you're like those old phone coils you have that are perfectly helical, except once in a while they get inverted and they flip the other direction.

02:15:33.071 --> 02:15:33.711
Yes, yes.

02:15:34.111 --> 02:15:35.972
That's kind of like a quadruplex G in DNA.

02:15:37.032 --> 02:15:44.214
They have these capacities to form Hoogsteen base pairing when they're GC rich, and then the structure of them changes into what looks like a knot.

02:15:45.174 --> 02:15:56.661
and those knots are stall points for translation and they also attract a lot of other cell circuitry because they're signals that are regulatory in nature.

02:15:58.402 --> 02:16:05.907
So again, remember when you say that these chemical structures are regulatory in nature, we're talking about p-value studies in one paper.

02:16:06.727 --> 02:16:09.288
We're talking about in vitro studies in one assay.

02:16:09.948 --> 02:16:12.429
We're talking about p-values and two assays.

02:16:12.469 --> 02:16:18.431
We're not talking about understood, well-defined, high-fidelity facts about our biology.

02:16:19.091 --> 02:16:29.955
But by using the terms that define them and provoking ideas with those terms, it becomes an enchantment where essentially that's what's happening in my mind.

02:16:30.635 --> 02:16:40.163
concepts that I don't quite understand are now being used to fill in the blanks and underscore or edify the logic of the concept that he's throwing at me here.

02:16:42.125 --> 02:16:46.108
And at this time, I wasn't sophisticated enough to see through him, but now I am.

02:16:46.128 --> 02:16:47.009
And now you are.

02:16:47.029 --> 02:16:49.130
You see a lot of these quadriplex Gs in promoters.

02:16:49.171 --> 02:16:50.992
You see a lot of them inside of telomeres.

02:16:51.132 --> 02:16:56.557
So there are signatures to the cell that are involved in interferon response.

02:16:57.632 --> 02:17:00.794
Um, so telomeres are involved in interferon response.

02:17:00.834 --> 02:17:13.844
You see how imprecise it is when you start making, uh, when you, when you code on optimize the viruses, RNA into the human version of this, where the, the most of the Asian, how many times have we said code on optimize in this thing?

02:17:13.904 --> 02:17:17.367
How many times would I say code on optimized after this stream?

02:17:18.647 --> 02:17:19.268
Lots of times.

02:17:20.979 --> 02:17:24.302
asking the wrong questions about transfection.

02:17:24.382 --> 02:17:25.944
Should we have codon optimized it?

02:17:26.144 --> 02:17:27.265
Why would we have done that?

02:17:27.325 --> 02:17:28.326
That will make it worse.

02:17:32.774 --> 02:17:37.258
T's in the third base of the codon get swapped out for G's or C's.

02:17:37.738 --> 02:17:41.001
When you do that, your GC content goes up substantially.

02:17:41.021 --> 02:17:45.804
And when your GC content shifts that much, you get quadruplex G formation all over the RNAs.

02:17:46.505 --> 02:17:49.968
That's something that's not as native to the virus.

02:17:50.068 --> 02:17:53.610
Actually, if you look at the quadruplex G structures in SARS, they're highly conserved.

02:17:53.670 --> 02:17:57.774
There's a paper out there showing they're conserved across 16,000 of the genomes they looked at.

02:17:58.434 --> 02:18:04.418
So the virus really only has these in key places for purposeful regulatory reasons.

02:18:05.118 --> 02:18:08.881
And then they make a version of spike protein that then litters them with a shitload more of them.

02:18:10.952 --> 02:18:23.298
Think about how significant these things should be on the list of reasons why the highly intelligent and extremely expert Kevin McKernan objects to these technologies.

02:18:23.518 --> 02:18:36.483
And yet somehow or another, he's been in front of the Senate and actually hasn't said that these technologies in general are such a multi-layered bouquet of bullshit that it's hard for me to summarize it in an hour.

02:18:37.944 --> 02:18:42.408
He says that double-stranded DNA and SV40 is what we need to be worried about in 2024.

02:18:43.649 --> 02:18:44.009
Almost 2025.

02:18:44.209 --> 02:18:52.556
None of these objections form the basis for the biology that he's now pushing.

02:18:52.596 --> 02:18:52.956
None of them.

02:18:54.517 --> 02:18:55.558
None of them!

02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:00.422
So what is he teaching our kids?

02:19:01.222 --> 02:19:04.205
What is he teaching our kids on the Danny Jones podcast?

02:19:05.105 --> 02:19:05.806
Stop lying!

02:19:06.466 --> 02:19:06.787
Nothing.

02:19:07.585 --> 02:19:08.526
He's lying to them.

02:19:09.867 --> 02:19:17.193
I think in the, I've got to dig up the exact paper, but they tripled in one of the vaccines and went up almost sort of magnitude in another one.

02:19:17.233 --> 02:19:19.796
I mean, it went up to like, I think 16 or 19 in one gather.

02:19:19.816 --> 02:19:29.264
So they've literally, I spent about a week trying to figure out if I could quantify or find a place that had quantified the difference in the vaccine number of quadruplex G's.

02:19:29.304 --> 02:19:35.349
And then I found a paper by Stephanie Seneff, not about the vaccines, but about the quadruplex G's.

02:19:35.819 --> 02:19:38.820
littered the RNA with these quadriplex Gs.

02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:40.520
They probably didn't notice this.

02:19:40.901 --> 02:19:48.583
I would argue they just did, if it was warp speed, they just put it through a codon optimization tool, because that's what you do to maximize expression, and they moved on.

02:19:50.363 --> 02:19:54.065
And so they're probably not aware that, oh, we put in all these secondary structures.

02:19:54.105 --> 02:20:03.487
Just like Annie DeGroat from EpiVax said on the video that Houston Tonic recently uploaded, we just used Word.

02:20:03.747 --> 02:20:05.168
We just used Microsoft Word.

02:20:05.808 --> 02:20:09.510
and did the did the search and replace the RNA.

02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:17.534
That's going to change the RNA's recognition by a lot of the toll receptors and by a lot of the viral defense mechanisms that they have.

02:20:17.574 --> 02:20:22.197
A lot of these viral defense mechanisms actually key off of the secondary structure of the RNA to cut it.

02:20:23.318 --> 02:20:29.501
It's interesting that the picture that's that he actually sent me, I just got to click on that again to show you what just dawned on me.

02:20:30.842 --> 02:20:35.845
is that the picture that you sent me is actually dog versus cat.

02:20:36.045 --> 02:20:40.928
And then here is a cat and a dog inside of a weight room.

02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:50.794
So does that mean he has a weight room in his house with a dancing bar and a mirror?

02:20:50.814 --> 02:20:55.156
I mean, because the cats are there, the dog is there, that's gotta be his house, right?

02:20:55.776 --> 02:20:59.879
Oh wait, sorry, I thought I had it up here already, my bad.

02:21:00.691 --> 02:21:02.332
Here, check this out.

02:21:02.892 --> 02:21:06.695
So this is the tweet that Soothspider dropped in.

02:21:07.335 --> 02:21:12.218
And then here we see the cat is lifting some iron to deal with the dog over here.

02:21:12.258 --> 02:21:21.483
But that means that in his Krispy Kreme house, there actually is a workout room with a ballet bar.

02:21:22.144 --> 02:21:24.025
And that's nice.

02:21:24.085 --> 02:21:26.306
I mean, it doesn't have to be his house, but it's kind of funny.

02:21:26.866 --> 02:21:27.807
Anyway, let's go back to this.

02:21:28.087 --> 02:21:29.128
Let's finish this up quick.

02:21:30.488 --> 02:21:35.714
And that's changed now with the pseudouridine implementation and the codon optimization.

02:21:35.754 --> 02:21:44.404
So I think that's why we're seeing a lot of these papers emerge that suggest these mRNAs reprogram the innate immune system.

02:21:45.713 --> 02:21:50.555
because these things go in and the toll receptors are confused by them.

02:21:50.955 --> 02:21:59.239
And we don't know how long they remain confused, but there seems to be at least a week period of either, you know, lymphocytopenia or neutropenia that's occurring.

02:21:59.299 --> 02:22:05.322
And there's also some alterations in the ratios of CD4 positive and CD8 positive cells, right?

02:22:05.342 --> 02:22:05.942
Those seem to be confusing.

02:22:05.962 --> 02:22:07.783
And toll receptors are in all cells, right?

02:22:08.635 --> 02:22:10.896
Toe receptors, they are immune.

02:22:12.457 --> 02:22:14.939
I don't want to say they're in all cells, because I don't know, actually.

02:22:15.019 --> 02:22:16.680
But they're in the gut a lot.

02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:24.064
And they're in a lot of cells that are, I think, on the epithelium layer to look for pathogens, basically.

02:22:24.424 --> 02:22:24.624
OK.

02:22:25.264 --> 02:22:26.045
They're in all cells.

02:22:29.099 --> 02:22:41.912
Yeah, I don't know how they exist in the brain, but I know that they're heavily involved in leaky gut syndrome and monitoring what types of pathogens and the microbiome that you've got in your gut.

02:22:43.034 --> 02:22:46.898
But how do they, if they're toll receptors, how do they interact with RNA that's inside?

02:22:48.433 --> 02:22:52.735
So I think it's total receptor three that looks for single-stranded RNA.

02:22:53.275 --> 02:22:53.736
Oh, I see.

02:22:53.836 --> 02:22:54.076
Okay.

02:22:54.136 --> 02:22:54.376
Okay.

02:22:54.416 --> 02:22:54.676
Okay.

02:22:55.096 --> 02:22:55.356
Yeah.

02:22:55.456 --> 02:22:58.678
And if that RNA has pseudourdine in it, I think it's, I think it doesn't see it.

02:23:00.199 --> 02:23:00.719
The, uh,

02:23:02.685 --> 02:23:12.651
Double-stranded RNA is another issue, which something Andy Fire's group did, is they tried to measure the single-stranded versus double-stranded ratio of the RNA in the vaccines they did sequence.

02:23:12.671 --> 02:23:17.535
And they found a very, very low frequency of the double-stranded RNA, because the double-stranded RNA tends to trigger more of this.

02:23:18.695 --> 02:23:20.056
Double-stranded RNA.

02:23:20.116 --> 02:23:26.600
So they looked for double-stranded RNA, but they didn't find the double-stranded DNA that he's now telling everybody in the world they found.

02:23:27.361 --> 02:23:28.802
That's very significant.

02:23:30.356 --> 02:23:42.508
He's talking about a paper that looked at single-stranded versus double-stranded RNA in the transfection products and didn't find any double-stranded DNA that he now says he can find even in tumors.

02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:46.592
He can find it in tumors.

02:23:52.618 --> 02:23:53.099
In response.

02:23:56.457 --> 02:24:07.086
But the real reason that they told us on PBS NewsHour that they did all this pseudouridine was to avoid the degradation.

02:24:07.386 --> 02:24:11.190
Only the degradation, I thought it was also the activation of the immune response.

02:24:11.890 --> 02:24:13.572
Yes, it's both.

02:24:14.092 --> 02:24:18.636
So, they have a vaccine that they designed to avoid activating the immune response.

02:24:20.370 --> 02:24:27.435
Because if the immune response gets activated by the mRNA and not by this toxic spike protein, then we'll have a different problem.

02:24:27.455 --> 02:24:30.278
You see how much layered bullshit there is.

02:24:30.318 --> 02:24:34.180
And if you start asking the right questions, it's very hard to maintain the layers.

02:24:35.181 --> 02:24:37.143
That's why he doesn't like this conversation.

02:24:38.439 --> 02:24:45.810
The question people are starting to raise is, okay, you evaded the immune response, but did you turn it off for a period of time?

02:24:46.431 --> 02:24:46.811
I see.

02:24:47.092 --> 02:24:48.975
Like, can you see other viruses now?

02:24:50.156 --> 02:24:53.822
We certainly see reactivation of other viruses post vaccination.

02:24:53.942 --> 02:24:55.903
Right, see, I see what you mean.

02:24:56.943 --> 02:24:59.725
And post vaccination post vaccination.

02:24:59.765 --> 02:25:01.386
Why not say post transfection?

02:25:01.446 --> 02:25:02.466
Because it's not.

02:25:02.886 --> 02:25:08.109
He wants me to think that they are transfecting a protein and the protein is causing the problem.

02:25:08.149 --> 02:25:10.030
So calling it a vaccination is fine.

02:25:12.523 --> 02:25:18.325
And of course, this gets even more complicated when you start considering breakthrough infections, because now you've got both to consider.

02:25:18.345 --> 02:25:23.767
You've got to consider the biology of this modified RNA and how... Are there breakthrough infections?

02:25:24.227 --> 02:25:27.268
Are breakthrough infections something we also have to understand?

02:25:27.628 --> 02:25:32.450
And they have a different biology because they've been vaccinated to the spike protein?

02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:34.391
Wow, tell me more, Kevin.

02:25:34.411 --> 02:25:39.172
They're going to interact with the virus, which has other genes like NSP13.

02:25:39.192 --> 02:25:41.293
We know that one interacts with these quadruplex Gs.

02:25:41.786 --> 02:26:06.213
But how are we going to differentiate between the, I guess that's what clinical trials should have done, but how can we differentiate in your mind between the effect of the never-before-tested complete pseudouridine of all the U's in an RNA versus the effect of the toxicity of the protein itself?

02:26:06.233 --> 02:26:08.574
Because assuming that that's also there.

02:26:09.810 --> 02:26:11.771
Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.

02:26:11.971 --> 02:26:19.115
I think they need to do more in vitro translation and peptide sequencing to prove, like, what is this thing actually making?

02:26:19.515 --> 02:26:27.259
Never mind the toxicity of the new improved nanoparticles that Peter Cullis has made more amazing than Robert Malone could have ever imagined, right?

02:26:28.059 --> 02:26:34.663
I mean, we're really... We're really very, very...

02:26:38.433 --> 02:26:42.176
We're really, really very, very far from reaching the exit with the help of this guy.

02:26:42.216 --> 02:26:45.458
You may not have to do that in human, you could do that in human cell lines first.

02:26:45.498 --> 02:26:49.381
That'd be a good step forward to see, okay, what do you, what does this produce in human cell lines?

02:26:50.042 --> 02:26:53.224
Ideally you do it, you could capture the stuff in patients as well.

02:26:53.384 --> 02:27:01.190
If they're catching exosomes circulating in the human bloodstream with that Bancel paper, we should be able to capture those and sequence them.

02:27:02.199 --> 02:27:10.301
But there were whole labs around the world that were sequencing the exosomes in the bloodstream of healthy people too before the pandemic.

02:27:10.961 --> 02:27:14.141
Whole labs that were doing exosomes inside of healthy people.

02:27:14.682 --> 02:27:18.922
It's so weird now how exosomes in this story have only to do with transfection.

02:27:19.363 --> 02:27:31.065
It's almost as if they know that when they use synthetic DNA or RNA to transfect to sell, one of the first things they do is try to get rid of that extra shit by producing exosomes and excreting it because they already do that.

02:27:34.229 --> 02:27:34.850
Isn't it funny?

02:27:35.390 --> 02:27:37.192
Isn't it funny how you can see right through it now?

02:27:38.113 --> 02:27:41.577
Well, I've seen sequences of them, or at least have high fidelity.

02:27:42.518 --> 02:27:48.704
I don't know enough about crystallization, whether you can capture enough of that method to actually get structure information out of it.

02:27:49.245 --> 02:27:52.408
That's probably a question for someone who's more in the structure space than I am.

02:27:53.149 --> 02:27:54.290
You got to have purity.

02:27:55.191 --> 02:28:15.810
sir, in order, I was going to say something worse, you got to have purity in order to do a crystallization and or you got to have an AI computer program that can do a virtual x-ray crystallography model like Robert Malone used to run the domain program in 2020 and select for silicoxib, ivermectin, famotidine, and remdesivir.

02:28:22.066 --> 02:28:25.229
Um, but that's definitely sequence the protein.

02:28:25.249 --> 02:28:27.772
You could definitely sequence the protein if you could purify it.

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:32.961
I think you could from the quantities, if you can see a band on a gel, they should be able to get that out in sequence.

02:28:32.981 --> 02:28:40.123
So the question is, will the mass spec systems that fragment these things be able to see, you know, heteroplasmic translation, right?

02:28:40.163 --> 02:28:42.524
This translation where there's a small percentage.

02:28:42.624 --> 02:28:48.725
But he just told us that there's an experiment where they did it with a single pseudouridine and they could see the mistranslation.

02:28:48.805 --> 02:28:52.106
So wait, either they can do it or they can't, right, Kevin?

02:28:53.866 --> 02:28:56.127
I'm sorry that I was so inept back then.

02:28:57.324 --> 02:29:20.311
I am so sorry to all the people that have suffered from transfection, that I was so inept back then, that I fell victim to these people, that I couldn't see through their lies in 2021, so that I couldn't save my friend Nathan, I couldn't save my friend Annie, I couldn't save my sister-in-law Femke, because I didn't understand.

02:29:21.811 --> 02:29:25.352
And I couldn't say it succinctly enough so that other people could understand.

02:29:27.952 --> 02:29:30.353
And I'm going to be apologizing for it for the rest of my life.

02:29:30.413 --> 02:29:35.216
I'm going to be working to atone for this mistake for the rest of my life, I assure you.

02:29:37.778 --> 02:29:42.901
Of the protein mistranslated, or is that going to be harder for them to pick up?

02:29:43.301 --> 02:29:44.882
That's a question for a mass spec expert.

02:29:45.082 --> 02:29:47.683
I haven't done a lot of mass spec or protein sequencing.

02:29:48.264 --> 02:29:53.407
And what you see in the three-dimensional structure, would it lead you to believe that there are going to be

02:29:54.247 --> 02:29:57.248
like signature error points or could you predict?

02:29:57.608 --> 02:30:13.433
I think so, I think you would probably see some of the consistent regions where they're fragmented or very very hard questions coming now that are not convenient for him to answer but he's answering them or where the translation stalls and you'll get spike fragments.

02:30:14.533 --> 02:30:17.175
Now, maybe some of those don't float around the exosomes because of that.

02:30:17.195 --> 02:30:17.575
I don't know.

02:30:17.695 --> 02:30:26.920
But you may be able to pick up partially folded spikes that would give you some understanding of, OK, we don't have one drug getting produced off of this prodrug.

02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:29.021
We have a library getting produced off this prodrug.

02:30:29.041 --> 02:30:33.344
And we have to consider that in the adverse response data that we're looking at.

02:30:36.246 --> 02:30:37.426
And so what's your plan now?

02:30:37.446 --> 02:30:38.707
You're not going to get into this at all?

02:30:38.727 --> 02:30:42.069
You're just going to stick with your botanicals?

02:30:42.754 --> 02:30:51.523
Yeah, I mean, I do this kind of as a hobby on the side because I'm as frustrated with everything going on in COVID as I can, but I don't have a lab that can work on this problem.

02:30:51.543 --> 02:30:55.647
And our company is all focused on making really good.

02:30:55.767 --> 02:31:00.011
So he's just going to fight the problem on Twitter because that's where the truth is.

02:31:00.292 --> 02:31:02.294
So he's just going to fight the problem where he can.

02:31:03.365 --> 02:31:08.269
genomic tools for other industries, but I'm not vested in the COVID industry.

02:31:08.329 --> 02:31:16.756
So people have always told me, you know, speak out if you can, because you're not, I don't get PCR revenue of COVID, you know, goes up or down.

02:31:16.776 --> 02:31:21.960
I don't have any, I don't have any vested interest in vaccines or anything.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.042
So I can view this from a more neutral perspective.

02:31:24.102 --> 02:31:28.286
No, my family is just tied into these people for generations already, that's all.

02:31:29.146 --> 02:31:32.610
But no, I'm doing this mostly because my kids are affected by all this.

02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:33.350
It's been two years.

02:31:33.370 --> 02:31:34.632
Their school's been totally blown up.

02:31:34.692 --> 02:31:36.954
My my eldest son never graduated from high school.

02:31:36.994 --> 02:31:38.435
I mean, he technically graduated.

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:41.098
That's the first time I remember him talking about kids.

02:31:41.138 --> 02:31:42.900
That's is interesting, cool.

02:31:43.973 --> 02:31:44.853
but we never saw him.

02:31:45.393 --> 02:31:46.634
He never had that experience.

02:31:47.174 --> 02:31:50.315
You know, all of these things in their life have just been turned upside down.

02:31:50.335 --> 02:31:57.256
They're having to wear masks into campus at universities the same week they'll have a 60,000 person football stadium.

02:31:57.416 --> 02:31:59.597
See, so he's not, he didn't keep his kids home.

02:31:59.657 --> 02:32:02.897
He wasn't smart enough or didn't have the principles to keep his kids home.

02:32:03.238 --> 02:32:04.718
He didn't protect his kids from this.

02:32:04.778 --> 02:32:06.358
And so essentially you can see it.

02:32:07.299 --> 02:32:08.699
He sold out like the rest of them.

02:32:08.739 --> 02:32:10.819
We don't know, but it sure sounds like he sold out.

02:32:10.839 --> 02:32:13.380
He didn't have the foresight to say, don't go to school this year.

02:32:15.106 --> 02:32:21.408
Even though that's what I was saying in 2020, that's what I was trying to tell Piper Stover to do with her daughters, but she didn't do it.

02:32:23.889 --> 02:32:38.413
She just delayed the publishing of my review until May so that the timing of the emergence of Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and all these people would only be a short month afterward and it wouldn't matter at all because we wouldn't publish it anywhere anyway.

02:32:45.356 --> 02:32:49.341
and filled with people without masks, and they all go out and then go to their classes in masks.

02:32:49.801 --> 02:32:57.871
It's making them grow up very distrusting of authority, which is probably a good thing, but it's also making them distrustful in public health.

02:32:58.131 --> 02:33:03.758
I mean, the generation above them is just an oppressor.

02:33:05.507 --> 02:33:07.688
In their opinion, they see this.

02:33:07.708 --> 02:33:09.149
There's hypocrisy everywhere.

02:33:09.409 --> 02:33:11.150
They're forcing the kids to do all the stuff.

02:33:11.230 --> 02:33:14.011
They know the kids are already- But you're doing it too.

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:15.932
You forced your kids to do all the stuff.

02:33:15.972 --> 02:33:17.393
You didn't tell them to not do it.

02:33:17.433 --> 02:33:22.275
You didn't tell them that noncompliance was the way that sovereign individuals would react to this.

02:33:23.355 --> 02:33:26.357
You didn't teach your kids how to resist at all.

02:33:27.377 --> 02:33:29.498
You went as limp as Jordan Peterson.

02:33:29.538 --> 02:33:31.159
I'm as lost as the rest of you.

02:33:32.611 --> 02:33:40.798
But you're a Human Genome Project guy who knew that this was a lie from the beginning, knew it was exaggeration from the beginning, but you let your kids go back to college?

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:51.108
That's as stupid as Robert Malone saying that he took Peter Cullis' word for it that they had improved a technology that he already knew 10 years ago was shit for healthy people.

02:33:54.403 --> 02:34:07.758
It's as ridiculous as Alex Jones insisting that he talked to the parents of Soph, and that they're great patriots, and that Soph is responsible for more than 90% of the stuff that she makes.

02:34:12.441 --> 02:34:21.446
It's as ridiculous as any of the other insistence that these people have made, that they're right and that they don't have conflicts of interest or they just mean well, or I just do this as a hobby.

02:34:22.167 --> 02:34:34.094
I don't have a lab that can do this stuff, but you just told a year ago, a year ago on the Vance Crowe podcast, you told him that you were actually doing PCR tests on pot for SARS.

02:34:37.299 --> 02:34:42.904
half immune because of the rate of this virus in the population, and they're still running after them with needles.

02:34:45.826 --> 02:34:49.890
What does that tell you about the generational exchange that's going on here?

02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:57.576
It's an extraction process and probably a wealth transfer problem as well, which is going on with all this inflation we're seeing as a result of this.

02:34:57.756 --> 02:35:04.302
Just careful little seeds of truth that make it sound like they were all fighting for the same shit, but he's on their team.

02:35:05.919 --> 02:35:15.344
his kids already have a seat, or they're being guaranteed a seat by his successful performance over the next five years or ten years or whatever they're going to do with him.

02:35:20.607 --> 02:35:22.088
I can't stop, ladies and gentlemen.

02:35:22.128 --> 02:35:25.369
I'm not going to stop because these people interfered with my life for years.

02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:30.132
And that means they interfered with the life of my wife and the life of my children.

02:35:30.172 --> 02:35:33.654
And that's what more of a direct insult

02:35:34.588 --> 02:35:38.170
Does a man have to have to justify his response?

02:35:47.737 --> 02:35:54.461
So yeah, there's a lot of global issues that will probably will have an impact on our business if we don't speak out.

02:35:54.661 --> 02:35:57.383
And so there's, I guess there's some personal interest there.

02:35:59.684 --> 02:36:00.585
Yeah, I don't know.

02:36:00.705 --> 02:36:02.748
I'm just really happy we finally got to talk.

02:36:03.209 --> 02:36:05.051
I'm so happy you waited.

02:36:05.071 --> 02:36:07.253
I can't say thank you enough.

02:36:08.175 --> 02:36:10.297
Oh no, thank you for the work you guys did at Drastic.

02:36:10.317 --> 02:36:13.581
I mean, that was a really hot topic that I was afraid to touch too early on.

02:36:14.402 --> 02:36:18.247
Thank you for the work you guys did at Drastic.

02:36:29.417 --> 02:36:52.921
Well, if you had any doubt, if you had any doubt that I was being played right here, understand what I told you before this video, that only one month after this video in January, fricking Rixey would show up and ask me to join drastic again and get behind the idea that the diffuse proposal was definitive proof of a lab leak.

02:36:56.582 --> 02:36:58.102
Do you see it?

02:37:00.097 --> 02:37:01.738
I was played like a fiddle.

02:37:05.201 --> 02:37:14.589
That took a serious amount of, you guys took an extraction process and probably a wealth transfer problem as well, which is going on with all this inflation we're seeing as a result of this.

02:37:14.629 --> 02:37:21.335
So yeah, there's a lot of global issues that will probably will have an impact on our business if we don't speak out.

02:37:21.555 --> 02:37:24.257
And so there's, I guess there's some personal interest there.

02:37:25.578 --> 02:37:25.738
Yep.

02:37:26.558 --> 02:37:27.459
Yeah, I don't know.

02:37:27.579 --> 02:37:29.619
I'm just really happy we finally got to talk.

02:37:29.759 --> 02:37:31.920
I'm so happy you waited.

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:34.141
I can't say thank you enough.

02:37:35.061 --> 02:37:35.281
Oh, no.

02:37:35.361 --> 02:37:37.162
Thank you for the work you guys did at Drastic.

02:37:37.202 --> 02:37:40.403
I mean, that was a really hot topic that I was afraid to touch too early on.

02:37:41.423 --> 02:37:46.448
It just, that took a serious amount of, you guys took a lot of risk on that.

02:37:46.569 --> 02:38:01.103
And I think a lot of people appreciate the work that you guys did there because I can remember those days, everyone was afraid that, you know, well, what if we speak out about this and they take this and turn it into weapons of mass destruction and go attack at China, you know, like this, you don't want to be the guy that could trigger that.

02:38:01.163 --> 02:38:02.405
And you guys did not trigger that.

02:38:02.445 --> 02:38:03.125
I'm not saying you did.

02:38:03.686 --> 02:38:05.287
In fact, I think it's quite the opposite.

02:38:05.407 --> 02:38:11.751
We were going to trigger them using the biology of viruses against China in a world virus war?

02:38:12.331 --> 02:38:19.136
Did he just suggest that that was what we were afraid we would trigger, but we luckily, because we did it well, we didn't trigger that?

02:38:19.396 --> 02:38:19.756
Opposite.

02:38:19.796 --> 02:38:21.457
If anything, it's been neutralized in that.

02:38:21.777 --> 02:38:23.378
It's pretty clear.

02:38:24.219 --> 02:38:28.222
You guys took a lot of risk on that, and I think a lot of people appreciate the work that you guys did there.

02:38:29.622 --> 02:38:37.447
I can remember those days, everyone was afraid that, you know, well, what if we speak out about this and they take this and turn it into weapons of mass destruction and go attack China, you know?

02:38:38.568 --> 02:38:39.728
Nobody was afraid of that.

02:38:42.270 --> 02:38:43.651
Nobody was afraid of that.

02:38:45.792 --> 02:38:46.632
It's hilarious.

02:38:47.233 --> 02:38:48.173
It's fantastic.

02:38:48.373 --> 02:38:51.575
It is the worst case scenario being seeded in my head again.

02:38:53.617 --> 02:38:55.418
The only one who said that was Kevin McCarron.

02:38:56.331 --> 02:38:58.272
was probably on the same team like this.

02:38:58.652 --> 02:39:00.572
You don't want to be the guy that could trigger that.

02:39:00.612 --> 02:39:01.852
And you guys did not trigger that.

02:39:01.892 --> 02:39:02.613
I'm not saying you did.

02:39:03.153 --> 02:39:04.953
In fact, I think it's quite the opposite.

02:39:04.973 --> 02:39:09.294
If anything, it's been neutralized in that it's pretty clear the funding comes back to us.

02:39:09.554 --> 02:39:13.115
So there's there's equal blame to go around between nation states here.

02:39:13.175 --> 02:39:15.256
We shouldn't be encouraging the nation states to

02:39:15.996 --> 02:39:17.157
get jingoistic here.

02:39:18.177 --> 02:39:19.718
We got to clean up our own house here.

02:39:19.758 --> 02:39:21.799
We got too many labs that are leaking these things.

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:33.484
And the virologists that are on this, who are funded to continue this work, are on a campaign trail to annihilate any lab leak stories, because they know that means they're going to get regulated like the nuclear industry.

02:39:34.205 --> 02:39:36.646
And frankly, the way they're behaving, they almost should be.

02:39:36.686 --> 02:39:37.406
I hate to say that.

02:39:37.526 --> 02:39:40.808
They wouldn't want to regulate them like the nuclear industry, would you, Mark?

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:47.801
Yeah, you should say that.

02:39:47.941 --> 02:39:49.122
I would say that, definitely.

02:39:49.542 --> 02:39:53.865
Yeah, they're out of control and arrogant, and they're seeing leaks left and right.

02:39:53.885 --> 02:39:55.786
I don't know if you saw the paper from the Venter Institute.

02:39:55.926 --> 02:40:00.368
Actually, it was from Beijing accusing the Venter Institution of leaking SARS-CoV-1 in 2007-2012, right?

02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:06.593
I mean, that can happen at their lab, and they've done excellent work throughout time.

02:40:06.673 --> 02:40:16.621
It can happen anywhere, and we need to up the bio-level safety levels, the oversight there when you're handling respiratory viruses that can have this type of global pandemic.

02:40:17.802 --> 02:40:19.483
I think it's just too loose right now.

02:40:19.644 --> 02:40:22.146
And you're not going to hear it from the mouthpieces on TV.

02:40:22.206 --> 02:40:26.549
They're going to pull in the people who benefit from this stuff, and they're going to tell you everything's fine.

02:40:26.589 --> 02:40:28.210
It came from penguins.

02:40:29.391 --> 02:40:34.356
And they, unfortunately, because they have the funding, they have the microphone right now.

02:40:34.456 --> 02:40:38.419
But hopefully, the tide is turning with all the outreach that you guys are doing on this.

02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:40.260
Yeah, I hope so, too.

02:40:40.421 --> 02:40:41.802
I mean, it's also just.

02:40:43.263 --> 02:40:44.944
Drastic is doing a lot of outreach.

02:40:46.666 --> 02:40:52.731
To me, as being a 50-year-old adult in America, I was gone in the EU for like 15 years.

02:40:52.751 --> 02:40:56.794
And when I came back, I couldn't believe that I felt like I had

02:40:57.475 --> 02:41:00.056
changed parties with just by leaving America.

02:41:00.936 --> 02:41:03.637
And I just want my old America back.

02:41:03.697 --> 02:41:10.840
I just want some semblance of honesty on television and I want some semblance of honesty with my kids.

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:18.923
I want everybody to kind of, you know, take responsibility for what they need to take responsibility for and start building community again.

02:41:18.963 --> 02:41:19.803
I don't understand

02:41:20.947 --> 02:41:27.371
how we got this fragmented, but it is frightening right now because I don't think we can take too many more years of it.

02:41:28.692 --> 02:41:29.973
And yeah, I don't know.

02:41:31.014 --> 02:41:31.774
It's very divisive.

02:41:31.814 --> 02:41:34.096
They are trying to segregate and separate people.

02:41:34.956 --> 02:41:37.758
And that is very crushing, I think, the human spirit.

02:41:37.778 --> 02:41:39.439
But it's also crushing, I think, to any

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.502
Escalation of dissonance, you're right.

02:41:42.522 --> 02:41:54.092
It's it's it's harder and harder for people to get together that have Experience here share these things with a loud enough voice where they aren't getting censored by the whole system I think that's that's that's part of the plan.

02:41:54.112 --> 02:41:55.734
So there is something here that's planned.

02:41:55.774 --> 02:41:59.698
I don't know who or what but There's just too many moves.

02:41:59.738 --> 02:42:02.360
They've made that you can't explain to ignorance, right?

02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:05.022
Absolutely, and you can't in and also the

02:42:07.066 --> 02:42:17.173
Wolfgang Wodach said it once to me in a Zoom call, that he said, I've never seen foreign policy across more than 10 countries be so on rails in my life.

02:42:17.874 --> 02:42:18.094
Right.

02:42:18.654 --> 02:42:19.575
I mean, it's on rails.

02:42:19.695 --> 02:42:21.196
And that's how he described it.

02:42:21.316 --> 02:42:21.556
It is.

02:42:22.377 --> 02:42:25.659
And it has not left the tracks yet, not since we left the station.

02:42:25.859 --> 02:42:26.980
And that's pretty frightening.

02:42:27.781 --> 02:42:27.981
Yeah.

02:42:28.761 --> 02:42:30.983
Yeah, we used to have some assurances that there was.

02:42:31.103 --> 02:42:36.267
So Kevin McKernan's dad used to work for a company by the name of Canberra Industries.

02:42:37.962 --> 02:42:40.124
And they, what do they do?

02:42:41.965 --> 02:42:56.236
They, um, a city firm, instead of using its own traveling salesman, uh, South sales Canberra produces radiation detection and analysis equipment used in medical research, environmental studies, and the nuclear industry.

02:42:56.437 --> 02:42:56.777
And they're.

02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:02.645
their president, vice president of marketing and sales was Richard McKernan.

02:43:02.685 --> 02:43:13.455
And that's before Kevin's dad went into microarrays, which are again, a foundational technology for the human genome project.

02:43:13.495 --> 02:43:21.122
So, you know, it could all be a bunch of coincidences that they're all mixed up in the same nonsense or, you know, mythologies or

02:43:22.333 --> 02:43:26.215
maybe just because they all were in the Department of Energy, then it just kind of worked out that way.

02:43:26.275 --> 02:43:32.998
Well, you guys can work down the hall if you want, because I know you work on radiation now, but we got this thing called the genome.

02:43:33.018 --> 02:43:34.078
We're working on that down there.

02:43:34.118 --> 02:43:38.220
If you just want to go down the hall and join that meeting, maybe you want to be with those guys too.

02:43:39.321 --> 02:43:40.221
Holy shit.

02:43:40.661 --> 02:43:50.726
Some energy between all the nation states and that, you know, there's jurisdictional shopping that could be done, but when it starts to get all synchronized like that, it does hint that there's something,

02:43:51.786 --> 02:43:52.926
you know, more organized above it.

02:43:54.607 --> 02:43:55.107
And that's.

02:43:55.307 --> 02:44:02.709
And the more organized above it includes guys like him, includes Robert Malone, includes Jessica Rose, a.k.a.

02:44:02.829 --> 02:44:04.489
Epi Girl from the Spars document.

02:44:04.529 --> 02:44:06.670
It includes Pierre Corey, a.k.a.

02:44:07.390 --> 02:44:08.730
George Floyd suffocated.

02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:12.611
It includes all of these people and a lot of them are Canadian.

02:44:18.953 --> 02:44:19.713
That's that's frightening.

02:44:20.733 --> 02:44:20.853
Yeah.

02:44:21.957 --> 02:44:23.158
Um, I hope we can talk again.

02:44:23.178 --> 02:44:25.220
I hear people screaming already.

02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:25.841
Yeah.

02:44:25.861 --> 02:44:26.061
Okay.

02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:26.521
All right.

02:44:26.601 --> 02:44:26.982
Good stuff.

02:44:27.102 --> 02:44:31.846
Well, thank you for the time and hearing the story and happy to, uh, no, thank you is necessary.

02:44:31.906 --> 02:44:32.367
I loved it.

02:44:32.427 --> 02:44:36.270
I'm going to turn it into a nice video and I'll let you see it before I show everybody else.

02:44:36.771 --> 02:44:36.991
All right.

02:44:37.031 --> 02:44:37.591
Well, no worries.

02:44:37.671 --> 02:44:38.552
I'm cool with it.

02:44:38.572 --> 02:44:39.874
You got to take it and run.

02:44:39.894 --> 02:44:42.416
I don't care about the edits, but all right.

02:44:43.197 --> 02:44:43.597
Thank you.

02:44:43.757 --> 02:44:44.638
We'll talk again.

02:44:44.858 --> 02:44:45.018
Yep.

02:44:45.479 --> 02:44:45.799
Bye bye.

02:44:58.891 --> 02:45:02.473
So that was a Kevin McKernan show.

02:45:02.513 --> 02:45:05.956
I get them guys mixed up, but John Baldwin knows the difference between the two of them.

02:45:08.652 --> 02:45:20.956
I don't know, I think these people probably are responsible for what happened and responsible for the confusion that I found myself in and are responsible for me unable to reach a useful finish line until now.

02:45:21.496 --> 02:45:24.457
But it doesn't change the fact that we are at a useful finish line now.

02:45:24.877 --> 02:45:29.078
It doesn't change the fact that the evidence that's found in this book is overwhelming.

02:45:29.098 --> 02:45:30.359
It doesn't change the fact

02:45:30.839 --> 02:45:34.222
that the evidence in their behavior in the last few weeks is overwhelming.

02:45:34.662 --> 02:45:44.870
Their consistent promotion of each other and their consistent elaboration of this limited spectrum of debate is exactly how they got us here.

02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:46.872
They are all part of the same illusion.

02:45:47.472 --> 02:45:49.433
We need to break this illusion quickly.

02:45:49.833 --> 02:45:56.936
Right now, the illusion is about gain of function, RNA molecules and natural viruses, or that there are none of these things.

02:45:57.376 --> 02:46:01.977
And that illusion is about to be replaced by another one that more people are willing to accept.

02:46:02.438 --> 02:46:10.881
That the FDA has permitted bad foods and bad chemicals and bad products and bad water to be unleashed on the United States.

02:46:11.321 --> 02:46:16.683
And the FDA hasn't done shit about what it's supposed to do, even though all of these foods are really well labeled.

02:46:17.648 --> 02:46:21.306
even though the fluoride concentration in the water is well published.

02:46:22.970 --> 02:46:26.952
because of the FDA and the EPA, they wanna get rid of those guys because they're shit.

02:46:27.073 --> 02:46:47.165
And in the meantime, we're not gonna talk about the dangers of GMO plants or GMO insects or the ways that stem cell research could be used or the dumbness of intramuscular injection or the terribly diabolical malevolent background noise of remnant sales in the American medical system.

02:46:47.745 --> 02:46:56.372
None of that stuff will be discussed by any of these people, but they're going to save us from foods that we could just choose not to eat and water we could choose not to drink.

02:46:59.834 --> 02:47:11.964
Ladies and gentlemen, we are still being governed in the same way that was described by Noam Chomsky and before him by many other people, including Aldous Huxley and Edward Bernays.

02:47:17.637 --> 02:47:23.361
Thank you very much for joining me and I'll see you again tomorrow for Biology 101 at 10.

02:47:23.741 --> 02:47:37.552
And I think starting next week, we're also going to start the Tuesday, Thursday Probability and Statistics or something like that with Matt Briggs that we are on the third class of.

02:47:38.432 --> 02:47:39.713
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:47:39.813 --> 02:47:40.893
Thank you very much for being here.

02:47:40.933 --> 02:47:42.694
I'm trying to stay on schedule as best I can.

02:47:42.754 --> 02:47:44.395
I apologize for being here late today.

02:47:44.875 --> 02:47:47.136
Hopefully tomorrow I'll hit 1010 on the money.
