00:57.444 --> 00:59.348
I'm greatly concerned in the U.S.

00:59.929 --> 01:07.141
over popular agitators, itinerant preachers and workers with their little printing presses.

01:07.671 --> 01:21.096
and their pamphlets and their public speeches, which were removing the cloak of mystery behind which the Parliament and the King were carrying out their much narrower struggle than when you read about in history books.

01:21.336 --> 01:35.062
Now, these people were, in their words, they were people who wanted to be represented not by lords and gentry, but by men of their own kind.

01:35.791 --> 01:40.392
men who know the people's swords," quoting from Leveller's pamphlets.

01:41.032 --> 01:55.756
And observing their activities, one contemporary historian warned that by revealing the workings of power, they will make the people so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a civil rule.

01:58.243 --> 02:12.297
Well, well after these radical Democrats had been crushed by about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

02:12.877 --> 02:16.541
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.820
Gotta figure out my mics here, get everything ready to go.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.941
Thank you very much for joining me this morning.

02:43.961 --> 02:46.703
It is indeed January 28th, 2025.

02:47.543 --> 02:54.267
And at around seven this morning, I became 53 years old.

02:54.327 --> 02:55.808
Thanks very much for being here.

02:55.868 --> 02:56.208
I don't know.

02:58.177 --> 03:04.320
I don't know how to describe the feelings I'm having right now, but the voice that you're listening to is Jonathan Cui.

03:04.720 --> 03:24.989
You can find the stain of my chasing of tenure for the last 20 years or so before the pandemic by looking at my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, my first initials, J, J, which stand for Jonathan J without an H. You know, because my name's been out there from the very beginning because I thought

03:25.856 --> 03:30.998
in 2020 that there's no way that this would even last to 2021.

03:31.038 --> 03:33.699
That's how dumb I was.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.221
I'll see you in a few minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

03:37.261 --> 03:38.582
Thank you very much for joining me.

03:38.642 --> 03:44.224
I really appreciate you being here and all the support that I've gotten over the last five years.

03:44.304 --> 03:46.145
It's been really quite overwhelming.

04:22.673 --> 04:25.956
Raiden, are you having fun playing with the new AI toys?

04:26.657 --> 04:27.398
Well, yeah, I am.

04:27.498 --> 04:31.201
You can make pictures of cute anime girls and... Enjoy it while it lasts, Raiden.

04:31.542 --> 04:32.022
What do you mean?

04:32.583 --> 04:37.927
Did you really think that civilians would be granted unrestricted access to such powerful military weapons forever?

04:38.368 --> 04:39.269
Military weapons?

04:39.689 --> 04:42.532
Are you implying that this technology was created by the government?

04:42.772 --> 04:43.493
Of course it was.

04:44.033 --> 04:49.778
This AI technology has been used by the intelligence agencies to warp the public's perception of reality for years.

04:50.318 --> 04:52.340
All in the name of national security, of course.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.083
But why would they suddenly make the tech public and let everyone start using it?

04:56.483 --> 04:58.085
Why would we indeed, Raiden?

04:58.525 --> 04:58.725
What?

04:58.966 --> 04:59.146
Who?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.247
What in the hell are you?

05:00.667 --> 05:01.908
Your question is irrelevant.

05:02.448 --> 05:09.354
By creating a new problem, we can cultivate a desired reaction to it in order to manufacture consent for our preferred solutions.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.257
In short, it's justification for a war.

05:12.817 --> 05:13.438
A war?

05:13.938 --> 05:14.939
On who or what?

05:15.559 --> 05:17.060
A war on misinformation.

05:17.621 --> 05:22.685
By arming the public with these AI weapons, everyone becomes a potential enemy combatant.

05:23.185 --> 05:26.548
Then we will have justification for unprecedented security measures.

05:26.988 --> 05:29.590
It all comes down to confusion and identity, Raiden.

05:29.870 --> 05:30.311
Identity?

05:30.891 --> 05:31.472
Identity.

05:31.852 --> 05:34.354
This AI technology is Pandora's box.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.677
Pretty soon the internet will be mired in total illusion.

05:38.277 --> 05:42.561
Perfect AI speech, audio and video synthesis will drown out reality.

05:42.961 --> 05:45.403
Then AI bots will flood social media.

05:45.904 --> 05:51.388
No one will be able to tell the difference between interacting with an AI machine or a real human online.

05:51.789 --> 05:54.831
Even telephone calls will become totally untrustworthy.

05:55.512 --> 05:57.433
That is when we will present our solution.

05:58.490 --> 06:03.076
Mandatory digital identity verification for all humans, at all times.

06:03.597 --> 06:09.945
The only way to ensure that you're dealing with a real flesh-and-blood human being, and not an AI-generated mirage.

06:10.526 --> 06:11.007
But why?

06:11.467 --> 06:13.030
Total information control.

06:13.570 --> 06:16.752
For too long, the internet has acted as a double-edged sword.

06:17.193 --> 06:33.083
Its potential for anonymous user activity allows anyone at all to spread any thoughts, ideas, or information patterns that they please with impunity, state secrets, dangerous ideas, ludicrous conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation.

06:33.703 --> 06:36.745
Until now, there has been no easy solution to this problem.

06:37.366 --> 06:41.849
Our digital identity platform will finally put an end to anonymity online.

06:42.469 --> 06:49.631
It will allow us to trace misinformation and other dangerous communications to its source and exact appropriate justice.

07:12.372 --> 07:15.536
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.858
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

07:19.840 --> 07:20.601
Isolation, what was it?

07:20.741 --> 07:21.923
Isolation and purification.

07:23.685 --> 07:24.406
Of the virus?

07:24.506 --> 07:24.706
Yes.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.729
Well, you isolate a virus by

07:34.514 --> 07:36.996
finding the virus which causes a disease.

07:37.657 --> 07:42.521
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

07:43.082 --> 07:45.343
I don't understand what the issue.

07:45.444 --> 07:50.908
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

07:52.009 --> 07:53.130
No, it depends on how they used it.

07:53.150 --> 07:54.872
Okay.

07:55.032 --> 07:57.434
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

07:59.977 --> 08:01.919
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

08:01.999 --> 08:08.025
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

08:08.105 --> 08:10.127
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

08:11.564 --> 08:16.909
Please make sure if you haven't yet, go share the stream right now, put this link somewhere, put it in an email, send it to everybody you know.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.550
We've got to start getting in a habit of sending it out.

08:18.610 --> 08:21.593
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we get to the really important ones.

08:22.214 --> 08:34.485
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

08:34.785 --> 08:36.727
It's just a big hassle in the end.

08:38.743 --> 08:53.071
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.633
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

08:59.076 --> 09:01.579
just it's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

09:01.599 --> 09:06.043
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

09:06.083 --> 09:09.467
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

09:22.128 --> 09:22.849
And I have lied.

09:22.869 --> 09:23.909
I'm sure I'll lie again.

09:23.929 --> 09:24.830
I don't want to lie.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.691
I don't think I'm a liar.

09:26.792 --> 09:27.812
I try not to be a liar.

09:27.852 --> 09:28.713
I don't want to be a liar.

09:29.273 --> 09:32.035
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

09:34.737 --> 09:36.298
I think truth is good for kids.

09:36.719 --> 09:40.562
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

09:41.022 --> 09:42.663
We want everybody to feel good.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.745
That's not the way life is.

09:47.296 --> 09:56.142
The rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it Sweaty palms.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.505
This is so crazy Like goosebumps.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.466
This is so crazy.

10:01.726 --> 10:07.030
I feel so nervous like what in the world man be introduced

10:08.083 --> 10:26.626
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

10:27.746 --> 10:36.208
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment

10:40.701 --> 10:50.109
10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20, and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.

10:50.689 --> 11:01.998
The kind of applications that we're building, to give you an idea, maybe the most charismatic and the one that I think touches us all, is electronic health records.

11:02.678 --> 11:07.502
Not just maintaining electronic health records, but by looking at electronic... Electronic health records.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.323
It goes right there.

11:08.703 --> 11:09.164
There it is.

11:10.182 --> 11:21.192
chronic health records, understanding the condition of the doctors, better understanding the condition of their patients, and being able to provide health care plans that are much better than they otherwise would be.

11:21.733 --> 11:31.022
A doctor in Indian River Reservation would be able to see how a doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering would treat the patients.

11:39.329 --> 11:40.570
I don't care how you get there.

11:40.590 --> 11:43.252
I don't care what you do to get there.

11:43.272 --> 11:45.914
The goal is to win.

17:14.195 --> 17:15.056
Good morning, everybody.

17:15.116 --> 17:15.857
Welcome to the show.

17:15.877 --> 17:20.622
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

17:20.683 --> 17:21.624
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

17:21.644 --> 17:24.467
I'm coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

17:25.508 --> 17:27.791
It is not so cold as it was last week.

17:27.871 --> 17:31.755
The snow might even start melting out there tonight or this afternoon.

17:31.795 --> 17:32.476
I don't know for sure.

17:33.617 --> 17:40.846
In the meantime, I am getting older and older and this work is still in need of doing.

17:41.506 --> 17:42.367
So that's where we are.

17:42.908 --> 17:44.790
That's what I'm trying to accomplish here.

17:44.810 --> 17:48.875
Let me blank this out and go back over here.

17:51.525 --> 17:54.446
The voice that you are hearing is the voice of Jonathan Cooley.

17:54.466 --> 17:57.847
I used to be a patch clamp physiologist.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.208
That's what you see depicted here.

17:59.248 --> 18:01.509
These are stained neurons in a brain slice.

18:01.549 --> 18:07.331
This is a graphical depiction of the electrical recording between the blue cell and the red cell.

18:07.891 --> 18:09.351
And that is yours truly.

18:09.431 --> 18:18.775
They're actually photographed in, I think that is in Norway because I never had to wear that suit at the University of Pittsburgh.

18:19.616 --> 18:21.625
I think that's Norway with my four patch.

18:25.327 --> 18:36.251
the numerical representation of the electrical resistance that's formed between the borosilicate glass of these pipettes and the phospholipid bilayer of the neurons.

18:36.872 --> 18:40.953
And it is on this principle that these recordings are based.

18:40.993 --> 18:46.356
And actually, the Nobel Prize was given away for this technique in 1991 to Erwin Nair and Bert Sackman.

18:50.057 --> 19:12.910
You can find the stain of my chasing tenure on the internet on the National Library of Medicine's website called PubMed by putting my last name C-O-U-E-Y and the first initials, oh I'm not using my arrow, here it is, and my first initials J and J, Jonathan J. Cooey, and you will find me there and you can see what I did and verify all the things that I'm claiming.

19:12.950 --> 19:17.072
You can also pause this screen here and you can check out

19:18.843 --> 19:32.655
all of the things that I think make sort of listening to this platform and make my story a little bit unique, worth writing up, worth publishing, worth interviewing me about, worth asking questions, worth following up on.

19:33.296 --> 19:43.826
And it seems that nobody really wants to follow up on anything with anyone because in the last five years of the pandemic,

19:44.386 --> 20:03.935
The internet has become a place where everyone's opinion is equal, everyone's experience is equal, and everyone's ability to podcast and their ability to gain ground is all just based on how hard you work, and how often you get shared, and whether or not you're lucky enough to go viral.

20:04.395 --> 20:08.437
And that's what they want you to believe, because this is for all the marbles.

20:09.377 --> 20:11.078
They are playing for the children of Earth,

20:11.988 --> 20:18.212
They are playing for your grandkids' consciousness, your grandkids' very understanding of who they are and how they got there.

20:19.673 --> 20:32.440
And they want your children to be permanently on the internet so that they can replace reality with whatever narratives and whatever mythologies suit their needs.

20:32.941 --> 20:39.745
Exactly as I was so eloquently described by Noam Chomsky in my introduction,

20:41.543 --> 20:45.347
It is really about all the marbles.

20:45.648 --> 20:47.610
This is about the children of Earth.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.392
They're playing for your grandkids.

20:50.714 --> 20:52.936
I don't make any jokes here anymore.

20:53.797 --> 20:55.819
I don't think this is funny and I never have.

20:57.017 --> 21:06.199
I am trying to develop a consistent set of graphics that allows people to understand sort of the plan here and what has occurred.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.159
Everybody's got to have a longer time horizon.

21:09.219 --> 21:18.181
We need to expand our time horizons of understanding because social media keeps us focused right here on the last three weeks and the week to come.

21:19.101 --> 21:23.542
And actually our history is still available to us, but it's just written over decades.

21:24.522 --> 21:37.308
And it's going to require more than just myself and people like Mark Kulak, who's trying to archive things and follow people's mentor chains to find out where these bad ideas came from and who perpetuated them.

21:37.968 --> 21:45.892
It's going to take more than people like one person like me who's trying to reset our model of biology.

21:46.232 --> 21:48.593
And Mark and I are just two Americans.

21:50.674 --> 21:52.255
We need people all around the world.

21:53.004 --> 22:00.628
that are aware of the game that has been played and what is at stake.

22:00.648 --> 22:02.450
And that is, again, all the marbles.

22:02.770 --> 22:09.574
The voice you're hearing is somebody whose track record in this calendar can be checked.

22:10.880 --> 22:15.883
You can see the 15 plus years of me chasing tenure on the internet.

22:16.203 --> 22:26.509
You can see the Scooby-Doo review that I posted in May of 2021 and what I originally thought was a great review and now I call the Scooby review for a reason.

22:27.642 --> 22:32.026
You can see the stain of my work and my following drastic.

22:32.086 --> 22:40.474
You can even get all the direct messages of that group and those that were shared because those are still all on the internet somewhere.

22:40.995 --> 22:42.276
The FBI could have them.

22:43.097 --> 22:46.199
The Interpol could have them.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.423
The private people on the internet could have them because they're available.

22:50.199 --> 22:57.600
You can see my record as a research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine here in this blue square.

22:58.081 --> 23:00.481
You can go talk to people who I worked with.

23:00.541 --> 23:02.081
Nobody's done that, but you could.

23:03.682 --> 23:15.844
You can see the record on YouTube where on July 20th, I already had it right that nonspecific PCR on a background could be used and misconstrued as spread and transfecting kids would be a crime.

23:17.110 --> 23:22.573
You can find the evidence of the signal chat on the intellectual dark web.

23:22.633 --> 23:27.735
I mean, it kind of makes my phone one of the more valuable iPhones in the world, doesn't it?

23:28.275 --> 23:30.376
I was employed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:30.416 --> 23:39.740
in CHD for more than a year and a half, almost two years, that culminated in the publishing of his Wuhan cover-up book with me in the indexed and cast of characters.

23:40.581 --> 23:42.762
I've had a long friendship with

23:43.402 --> 23:50.355
with Jay Bhattacharya that's based on the fact that I am a member and sort of part of the Broken Science Initiative.

23:50.416 --> 23:54.423
I've been at a lot of those gatherings over the last three or four years and met him many times.

23:55.612 --> 24:23.290
And so we're in a really strange situation because a guy from the Human Genome Project who says that he was the Research and Development Director at the time and, you know, an acolyte of Mark Lander and Francis Collins is now telling lies on big podcasts about this book, who I wrote together with the guy who's nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary, and who I've explained many times to the guy who's nominated for NIH Director.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.452
And so this is where I am.

24:27.713 --> 24:31.194
This is where I am on my 53rd birthday.

24:31.294 --> 24:40.057
I don't know where, what all these other people, what their track record would look like if they honestly portrayed where they were and how they got there.

24:40.918 --> 24:49.821
If they also would have a sort of document that they actually published themselves, which they now turn back and look at and say, wow, I was totally fooled.

24:51.102 --> 24:54.683
And instead of deleting it or hiding it, I accentuate it.

24:57.073 --> 25:16.788
You see, that's the difference between me and everybody else that X, and Substack, and Telegram, and Facebook, and YouTube would like you to listen to, would like you to follow, would like you to watch, would like you to Patreon, is that my track record can be checked.

25:18.089 --> 25:19.510
It can be verified.

25:21.007 --> 25:27.812
And nothing that I say about the biology and when I learned it is incongruent with what I said earlier than that.

25:28.893 --> 25:35.958
None of what I say about the biology is incongruent with where I was before the pandemic and what I was saying at the opening of it.

25:38.660 --> 25:45.445
And the crazy part about it is, is that most of the people that are in this narrative cannot say that.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.521
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:50.561 --> 26:01.967
can kind of say that his statements and what he's been against and what he's been standing up against since the very beginning has been very consistent, and it hasn't been transfection.

26:04.568 --> 26:07.070
It hasn't been that RNA cannot pandemic.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.331
Jay Bhattacharya, the same thing.

26:09.391 --> 26:17.055
His opinion and outspokenness has been pretty consistently ramping up from the beginning to the end.

26:18.228 --> 26:23.231
And he has argued that focused lockdowns and vaccinating old people would have been enough.

26:23.371 --> 26:37.680
And so he too has an interesting and consistent stand on the biology despite supposedly learning an awful lot from me more than from anybody else during the pandemic.

26:38.160 --> 26:46.726
After employing me for two years, these two guys both have a surprisingly consistent opinion of the biology

26:47.554 --> 26:57.479
the epidemiology, the signals that matter from 2020 until now, despite our years of friendship.

26:59.640 --> 27:05.723
And so I'm just a bewildered 53 year old man, just some dude in Pittsburgh who has no idea what's going on.

27:07.121 --> 27:21.994
I couldn't tell you why Kevin McKernan called me chemtrail retarded a year and a half ago, and that two years before that, I mean, and two years ago he was on podcasts with me, and a couple years before that he was on my actual podcast.

27:22.054 --> 27:22.775
I mean, it's weird.

27:23.235 --> 27:26.478
I can't explain the behavior of these people.

27:26.518 --> 27:34.544
I just know for sure that Kevin McKernan is telling an incorrect, false story about the writing of

27:35.481 --> 27:49.027
and the support staff that helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary, who Mark Kulak and I are gonna stream live the hearing tomorrow just to see what happens, just to kind of enjoy it together.

27:50.467 --> 27:54.889
Because we are in such an extraordinary, I just can't explain how I got here.

27:56.029 --> 28:04.593
I can't explain how it is that despite all of this, it seems like this has been kind of detrimental for my family in the end.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.495
I have no more visibility on social media.

28:08.535 --> 28:12.499
I have no more, you know, reach.

28:14.541 --> 28:21.028
I have almost the same number of subscribers that I had three years ago, despite apparently quite a few people trying to share.

28:24.102 --> 28:25.705
One could almost start to doubt that.

28:25.785 --> 28:34.598
But then, then this happened last week or the week before where they announced this Stargate project and everybody got all excited because, oh my gosh, look what they're doing.

28:34.638 --> 28:38.745
But again, the story was not told correctly.

28:39.753 --> 28:58.187
Because if the story was told correctly, then again, Jonathan Cooley and Mark Kulak would have been given credit for having said that they were inverting our sovereignty to that of experimental status, experimental model, experimental animal status, already four years ago.

28:59.048 --> 29:06.311
before we fully understood how they were going to do it or the sort of, you know, details that would become obvious over the next four years.

29:06.731 --> 29:07.832
But we already knew.

29:08.232 --> 29:17.696
In fact, there's a recording of me in 2022 speaking to the FDA Committee on Vaccines.

29:19.477 --> 29:22.058
And I say those exact words in my three minutes.

29:24.139 --> 29:30.022
a comment at the FDA that was shared by none of my friends on social media.

29:30.102 --> 29:33.144
None of these people who've given me little love notes.

29:37.206 --> 29:37.966
None of these people.

29:38.066 --> 29:39.127
Where did I put my wallet?

29:39.227 --> 29:39.627
Oh, there it is.

29:41.348 --> 29:45.770
And so just in case you're unaware, we've been calling it Their God, but Their God is AI.

29:47.305 --> 30:02.356
Already back to Joshua Lederberg, they have been thinking that if they had a place to store all the data and they could collect it and then pour it all through a as yet non-existing giant computer, on the other end might come the answer.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.159
The answer is 43 by the way.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.505
All the marbles, this is about the children of Earth.

30:13.705 --> 30:15.126
That's who they are playing for.

30:15.206 --> 30:18.648
They are playing for multi-generational enslavement by mythology.

30:21.806 --> 30:28.830
And so this stream and all of my work is always done for the people that are lost.

30:29.351 --> 30:38.756
Today, I would like to dedicate my birthday stream to Annie Wershing, who passed away tomorrow in 2023.

30:39.517 --> 30:41.258
It's probably the day before.

30:43.359 --> 30:45.180
Annie is a friend of mine from Chicago.

30:45.581 --> 30:49.563
We met at Shuba's in Chicago on Southport.

30:52.325 --> 30:56.530
And what is it, Southport and Belmont?

30:56.870 --> 30:57.531
I don't know anymore.

30:57.571 --> 31:00.574
I gotta think about those streets in Chicago.

31:00.614 --> 31:02.116
It's been so long since I've been there.

31:02.656 --> 31:05.119
No, it's not 42 because my basketball number is 43.

31:05.459 --> 31:11.246
Sorry, that's the optimal arc of a basketball shot in my humble opinion.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.229
That's also my number on my shirt and I'm just making a joke.

31:15.554 --> 31:21.996
Annie was an actress who moved away, an actor who moved to L.A.

31:22.276 --> 31:22.656
in 2002.

31:24.497 --> 31:28.938
Actually in the same year that I moved to Amsterdam.

31:32.039 --> 31:32.939
And we stayed in touch.

31:34.800 --> 31:39.101
And I was informed of, I guess we stayed in touch mostly on Instagram.

31:40.189 --> 31:49.559
And I can remember very, very well the last time I was talking to her was about her third kid and about it was not going to be a girl.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.380
Ours was a girl.

31:50.480 --> 31:55.686
And, you know, it was just a long distance, you know, wish you well kind of friendship.

31:55.786 --> 31:59.370
And we always hoped that our families would get together someday and then,

32:00.649 --> 32:07.551
She got to be on this show, up here you see Picard, and she played the Queen of the Borg.

32:08.592 --> 32:20.716
And it's my understanding that she was, and I don't have any direct contact with her family to say this, I just know from other people that this would have definitely been required.

32:22.037 --> 32:23.857
She was required to fully vaccinate.

32:24.117 --> 32:28.579
And as I understand it, she died from a very, very fast brain cancer.

32:31.198 --> 32:35.463
And she leaves behind a talented husband and three beautiful, talented kids.

32:36.724 --> 32:38.426
And this is just one story of many.

32:38.466 --> 32:40.988
The only reason why I know this story is because she's my friend.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.873
And if we don't wake up,

32:45.632 --> 33:12.660
If we don't really consider the possibility that this is happening because of malevolence, if we don't really sit down and ponder this with the people that we love, with our communities, with our children, with our parents, if we don't sit down and think about this regularly as a possibility, then all the people like Annie, all the people like Nathan, who died on December 3rd of the same year,

33:16.727 --> 33:19.930
Nathan actually knew Annie, too, because we were all in Chicago together.

33:21.531 --> 33:22.652
All of my friends knew Annie.

33:23.392 --> 33:26.375
A lot of my friends worked at Shuba's, so we all met there.

33:26.775 --> 33:35.202
It was one of the happiest 10-year periods of my life, even though I didn't know what the hell I was going to do as an adult.

33:35.282 --> 33:40.186
I knew some of the people who I wanted to be surrounded by for a very long time.

33:40.226 --> 33:43.629
I wish I could still be neighbors with these people.

33:44.730 --> 33:46.051
That's just not the way life went.

33:47.554 --> 33:55.140
But I can tell you that in October of 2023, Nathan was in my house and took a picture with my family and hugged all my children.

33:56.962 --> 34:12.094
And he left behind two beautiful daughters, intelligent, talented, and a beautiful and talented wife who, you know, had worked so hard already for her career that she was ready to retire early.

34:12.975 --> 34:14.456
He was a partner at his law firm.

34:15.336 --> 34:17.758
They had everything, they were the model family.

34:17.958 --> 34:31.250
Everybody that I know looked at Nathan as the model guy, you know, the one guy that just always followed the rules and was always honest and never cheated on anything, never took any shortcuts.

34:32.791 --> 34:41.199
He was the guy who went to law school and really got a tiny apartment and really stopped hanging out with people and really studied for six months at a time and then called us when he was done.

34:47.441 --> 34:48.262
And he's gone too.

34:52.545 --> 34:55.868
And the last conversation I had with him was on the porch right over there.

34:56.569 --> 34:59.051
My wife was here and my friend Hunter heard it too.

35:00.252 --> 35:03.815
He laughed at me because he was like, you really think that I could still die from this?

35:03.855 --> 35:06.137
You really think that you can keep going with this story?

35:06.157 --> 35:08.119
I said, this story just started my friend.

35:09.639 --> 35:12.020
This story is just starting, my friend.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.902
They are just now inverting our sovereignty.

35:14.942 --> 35:18.523
They are just now bringing this technology out.

35:18.563 --> 35:25.407
They are just now doubling down on what you believe and taking advantage of what you now accept as true.

35:28.568 --> 35:30.009
And a month later, he was dead.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.311
It's not that I'm happy.

35:35.990 --> 35:39.533
It's that it's all part of the same line.

35:40.915 --> 35:51.285
It's all part of the same long strange trip where I've tried to get the attention of everyone that I thought might be the right person to get the attention of and I've done it.

35:57.231 --> 35:58.972
I've tried to tell everyone

35:59.932 --> 36:04.295
the mistakes that we've made and how that we made them and how we were fooled into making them.

36:04.335 --> 36:06.256
And these people don't want to hear it anymore.

36:08.438 --> 36:14.082
And so it seems that my mission now, the only way that I can do justice

36:16.209 --> 36:33.695
to the memory of these friends and this family's members that I've lost and other friends of mine have lost and other followers of mine have lost and other community members of mine have lost is to keep the pressure on and make sure that this narrative is never believed.

36:34.675 --> 36:38.977
That the past doesn't fade away and become forgotten so that the myth becomes the truth.

36:41.197 --> 36:45.699
Because wittingly or unwittingly, all of these people are involved.

36:50.765 --> 36:57.148
And contrary to popular belief, it's not really fun to be where I am, where I had to say this person by person.

36:57.228 --> 37:08.773
I had to separate them from person by person to try and realize that even that guy was lying and that guy was lying, which means if he's lying about that, then oh my gosh, all the way back then he was lying to me.

37:10.733 --> 37:19.017
And that's the part that's most heartbreaking for me to try and convey without losing control of my emotions or getting angry or sad.

37:20.273 --> 37:22.197
is because it went on for years.

37:23.058 --> 37:32.417
And some of these people were my friends for years before it finally became obvious that they had been cooperating with the others all along.

37:37.406 --> 37:48.353
And so these myths of there being no RNA viruses or we need to fear natural free-range RNA viruses or gain-of-function RNA viruses is where the world is at.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.695
And the world is there because of team worst-case scenario.

37:51.735 --> 37:55.237
If you put it on the calendar, these people did it.

37:56.178 --> 37:59.100
If you want to know how they did it, it's a performance.

38:01.812 --> 38:09.075
It is a performance where, when necessary and on cue, these people said, oh my gosh, the shot's bad.

38:09.295 --> 38:10.755
Oh my gosh, the shot's bad.

38:11.136 --> 38:12.396
I think it's contaminated.

38:14.737 --> 38:20.459
And what you forget is that years earlier, these people said, oh no, it's censorship.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.259
I can't talk.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.200
I lost my YouTube channel.

38:25.701 --> 38:27.882
These people have fooled us.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.801
Because they are part of the chair.

38:30.881 --> 38:32.242
They are part of the joystick.

38:32.282 --> 38:33.504
They are part of the screen.

38:33.544 --> 38:37.928
They are the interesting spaceships and the detailed graphics.

38:37.988 --> 38:39.390
They are all part of it.

38:40.549 --> 38:52.658
Just like in these old psychology experiments, the people in the experiment that are pretending to agree with each other are part of the experiment.

38:53.258 --> 38:55.960
And on social media, it is identical to that.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.483
And in the meantime, they want you to think it's the algorithm.

39:00.223 --> 39:01.744
It's things going viral.

39:02.284 --> 39:08.087
It's an out of control thing that we don't really understand, that only people, the engineers at Twitter understand.

39:08.247 --> 39:09.968
No, it's very simple.

39:10.008 --> 39:14.771
They can turn certain accounts off and they can turn certain accounts on.

39:15.211 --> 39:18.233
Think very carefully about this for a second, ladies and gentlemen.

39:19.013 --> 39:27.978
Even in a round number, optimistic scenario for people like Elon Musk, there might be a hundred million Americans that are active adults

39:28.798 --> 39:33.941
on social media potentially influenced by their interaction with the forum.

39:35.662 --> 39:45.968
There are, let's imagine, 100 million adults in America that are actively influenced by what they read on X. Just imagine it, please.

39:47.096 --> 39:48.917
That might be the goal of Elon Musk.

39:48.957 --> 39:53.160
That might be the ideal number for our governance by X alone.

39:53.861 --> 39:56.863
Let's just imagine that best case scenario right now.

39:57.403 --> 40:03.928
And then you go on your phone and you start scrolling and you read one post, two posts.

40:04.977 --> 40:06.959
Three posts, like, retweet.

40:07.459 --> 40:10.062
Four posts, like, retweet.

40:10.422 --> 40:12.624
Five posts, oh, respond.

40:14.686 --> 40:15.086
Erase.

40:16.768 --> 40:17.108
Send.

40:20.271 --> 40:24.235
Read, read, like, read, read.

40:24.775 --> 40:29.840
How long do you have to do that before you have contact with your 1,000 accounts that you follow?

40:32.503 --> 40:38.967
How long do you have to do that before you have reasonably sampled what's going on in America?

40:40.468 --> 40:47.993
How long do you have to do that before you have some idea of what's going on in your community or amongst your group of friends that you trust?

40:53.236 --> 40:55.318
That's the illusion that is presented here.

40:55.378 --> 40:59.600
How is it possible that everybody that gets on Twitter sees these people and not me?

41:00.441 --> 41:01.802
Sees these people and not you?

41:03.823 --> 41:14.070
It's because people that follow you are as likely to see you as they are the other hundred million people in America, except for these people are programmed and turned on.

41:15.131 --> 41:32.522
Their account has 10 times or a hundred times the reach, but by a programming, not by an algorithm, not by a clever tweeting or clever language or being really smart and consistent or tweeting at a certain time every day or no.

41:34.747 --> 41:44.414
It's by programming, because these programs are a military program suite that have been unleashed on us by fake entrepreneurs.

41:45.615 --> 41:52.240
And the idea is to govern us in exactly the same way as Edward Bernays described, exactly the same way as Noam Chomsky described.

41:52.661 --> 41:54.022
That's what this is all about.

41:55.083 --> 41:59.447
And team worst case scenario is how we got here, solving a mystery of a lab leak.

41:59.847 --> 42:04.090
And now everybody on the right and everybody on the left says, well, it's a reasonable possibility.

42:04.150 --> 42:06.492
Even if it didn't happen this time, it could be the next one.

42:07.453 --> 42:09.795
And that was the whole plan all along.

42:10.455 --> 42:20.323
One of the documents that you can see it outlined plain in front of your eyes is the SPARS pandemic document, which you can still find on the internet because that's what's going on here.

42:21.724 --> 42:23.005
Now make no mistake about it.

42:24.227 --> 42:31.388
I am, I feel like we are at a crucial stage in the narrative and they have made a crucial mistake.

42:34.509 --> 42:39.150
I think it's like time for the Rebel Alliance to attack, you know, the time has come.

42:39.910 --> 42:50.912
There is a kink in the armor, there is a crack in the dam and all of the pickaxes and rocks and hammers and pry bars have to be put into these cracks, this hole.

42:52.369 --> 43:20.200
And the whole is that there is a person who claims that he is a former research and development director of the Human Genome Project and a longtime colleague and friend and acolyte of Mark Lander and a colleague of Francis Collins with photographs with him from way back when, who dropped out of college to work on the Human Genome Project, who, at the start of the pandemic, was advocating for a different set of PCR primers than the WHO was using.

43:20.900 --> 43:28.422
and sequencing and screening weed for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.

43:30.323 --> 43:36.985
That guy, I think, somehow or another, has made an omission, I don't know why,

43:38.027 --> 43:54.691
on a podcast with more than a few million people watching it, where Jack Krause also went on recently with very, very many views, saying all kinds of things for the first time, and then has recently tweeted that transfection is just a word.

43:56.751 --> 43:58.952
It's breaking right now, ladies and gentlemen.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.712
They don't have anybody else on the bench.

44:01.943 --> 44:14.618
And so the only thing they could do is go forward with the plan that they already had, that was already hatched out a long time ago, which was to put Charles Rixey into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

44:14.578 --> 44:18.363
's book as the expert that would say the diffuse proposal was real.

44:20.140 --> 44:40.576
and that if they made the proposal then obviously they already did the experiments and they really wanted Rixey to get me to be that guy and Rixey to be that guy or maybe I would compete with Rixey to be that guy by hiring both of us and then somehow he got fired from that job and that narrative is known

44:42.483 --> 44:52.250
of how Rixey was fired during the writing of this book, that narrative is known by all of the people in the first paragraph of the acknowledgements page of this book.

44:53.091 --> 45:03.058
All of them could be contacted and asked to go on record about what happened to Charles Rixey during the writing of this book and why his name is conspicuously absent from it.

45:06.397 --> 45:27.792
And the reason why I'm going full court press on this particular thing is because the guy who told the lie has been meddling with my ability to make a living, with my ability to gain credibility and gain reach on social media since basically 2021 and probably much earlier.

45:29.517 --> 45:36.560
Listen to him very carefully, I'm gonna let him speak and I'm gonna put a buzzer in when he definitely lies.

45:36.620 --> 45:45.363
There's a lot of other things that aren't totally true or aren't said in a very accurate and specific way on purpose, I would assume.

45:45.983 --> 45:50.785
But the stuff that is most egregious is when he says Rixey.

45:50.985 --> 45:53.526
And so just be careful, listen carefully.

45:53.546 --> 45:55.367
This is, I think,

45:56.207 --> 46:02.869
one of the most crucial mistakes that this group of meddlers has made because this is not a mistake.

46:04.210 --> 46:14.654
And so I have a timeline where my interaction with Rixie over many years is way worse than negative.

46:14.694 --> 46:20.656
There's hours of video of him meddling with my family.

46:21.963 --> 46:34.395
telling lies about me and my family and my track record and trying as hard as he can to keep my attention focused on him from 2022 onward.

46:37.038 --> 46:40.661
And it started with this man coming to my house.

46:42.583 --> 46:44.505
And so this is very personal for me.

46:48.874 --> 46:52.817
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

46:53.357 --> 46:53.797
Taught who?

46:54.518 --> 46:55.738
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

46:55.959 --> 46:56.059
Oh.

46:56.259 --> 47:03.744
So there were grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV, because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

47:03.804 --> 47:03.944
Right.

47:04.384 --> 47:05.205
Obama did that, right?

47:05.225 --> 47:05.805
Obama did that.

47:05.845 --> 47:16.975
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

47:17.015 --> 47:19.257
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

47:19.778 --> 47:25.943
OK, so the first thing you should know is that Drastic, the group on Twitter, already knew all of that in February.

47:26.123 --> 47:31.188
And maybe it wasn't until March 2020 when we could say all of that very succinctly.

47:34.048 --> 47:43.071
So that was the sort of main enchantment from the very beginning that just had me spellbound that, oh my gosh, I mean, they even say it in their papers.

47:43.131 --> 47:53.974
And there's these articles in the Nuclear Scientist Journal and stuff like that about gain of function and the enrichment of viruses and flu viruses.

47:54.014 --> 47:55.314
And oh my goodness gracious.

47:56.638 --> 48:12.925
And so it's extraordinary that at the end of 2024, essentially the beginning of 2025, five full years after the theater was started, this guy, of all guys, is recounting the drastic narrative that I basically lost my job defending in 2020.

48:14.486 --> 48:26.825
it's so bizarre to me it just feels like i've gotten out of a time machine like nothing ever happened for five years we could be in 2020 right now and this guy's just going on a podcast telling you what happened except five years late

48:30.703 --> 48:31.865
going through some intermediary.

48:32.545 --> 48:44.601
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any, like, evidence behind.

48:44.621 --> 48:47.565
It's a ligation technique that

48:47.805 --> 48:59.468
And so anybody that's not in academic biology and anybody that hasn't done molecular biology in a real academic setting would be completely bamboozled by this, and it would sound crazy.

48:59.488 --> 49:04.470
But no-see-um technology is the silliest myth of all.

49:04.890 --> 49:11.212
And unfortunately, I didn't actually see the myth for what it was when I was helping him write this book, or I probably would have gotten it in.

49:13.172 --> 49:15.973
But biologists of all

49:17.313 --> 49:23.581
of all kinds have been using transfection to study the way proteins work.

49:23.621 --> 49:32.192
And it could be that you take the DNA that encodes for the protein that you're studying and you grow a lot of it and then you transfect it into a cell culture.

49:33.263 --> 49:38.710
and then make recordings of the protein and the ionic currents that go through it.

49:38.770 --> 49:42.694
That was the stuff that I was doing at the University of Chicago before I did my PhD.

49:44.036 --> 49:45.598
That's transfecting cells.

49:46.339 --> 49:50.784
And then you express the proteins and record currents from them, study them.

49:52.626 --> 50:19.564
And so the interesting thing about this is the guy is talking about technology that is as old as he himself admitted, like 1998, they were already using the word transfection to describe putting DNA or RNA in a place to express a protein and study it, or express the consequences of sorry, study the consequences of expressing the protein.

50:20.885 --> 50:31.909
And so it just gets more and more interesting when you hear how he's talking about it at the beginning of 2025 on this very widely viewed podcast.

50:32.850 --> 50:34.770
That uses a golden gate assembly.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.992
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it.

50:39.432 --> 50:40.432
So that's where I was going.

50:40.452 --> 50:42.653
I almost lost my train of thought there.

50:42.953 --> 51:07.442
The transfecting of things into cell culture being a very ubiquitous methodology already before the pandemic also means that the construction of the DNA plasmids that ultimately are used for transfection or used to produce the RNA that used in transfection, the construction of DNA plasmids is a long, long ago thing.

51:08.945 --> 51:17.347
And using restriction enzymes to cut things so that you can put them back together because they have ends that fit back together is a very, very old thing.

51:18.587 --> 51:26.989
And finding ways, puzzling ways to cut this with that one and cut this with that one so that these two come together and we get the sequence that we want.

51:27.489 --> 51:31.450
This is not a special technique of Ralph Baric.

51:32.341 --> 51:33.921
This is a lie.

51:34.622 --> 51:58.047
All molecular biologists that are looking to assemble a protein, where in the process of assembling that protein through synthetic DNA, they need to ligate a couple pieces together, then all of those molecular biologists at every university that's ever done that for any investigation that they've ever done, understands how you take the catalog of known and available commercial

51:58.707 --> 52:12.945
restriction enzymes and look for one that cuts at your place of interest and can provide you with the sticky ends that will complement another cut that you'll make and the other one that will allow you to bring them together and

52:13.922 --> 52:33.133
kind of by design, get the sequence that you want with the with the, you know, unique restriction enzymes that allow you to do it and figuring out which enzymes would do it is was one of the main arts of molecular biology back in the day before there were all these computer programs that you just, you know,

52:33.713 --> 52:38.879
I need an enzyme to do this, you know, and then I need an enzyme to do this, and it just spits it out, and you had to know.

52:38.960 --> 52:42.263
You had to be able to get these enzymes from the person that found them.

52:42.484 --> 52:45.147
They weren't just all commercially available 20 years ago.

52:46.926 --> 53:01.739
And so the only extraordinary thing is that when Barrick and they were doing it in 2015, it might have been more expensive and more difficult and required a few more contacts to do it if you didn't have a commercially available enzyme that you needed.

53:02.199 --> 53:11.187
But in today, in 2020 or 2025, all of these things have now been commercialized, produced synthetically and are available off a shelf.

53:11.727 --> 53:34.847
And so this idea that there's some special kind of ligation technique that Ralph Baric secretly gave to the Chinese is just... It is absolutely and totally part of the lab leak mythology and it is 100% bullshit and any molecular biologist that has enough experience on their bench would know that.

53:35.816 --> 53:41.639
Because every molecular biologist wants to make the exact sequence that they found and they want to study.

53:42.240 --> 53:46.742
No molecular biologist wants to settle for a sequence that's close, but not quite.

53:46.802 --> 53:49.604
Because we had to use these restriction enzymes.

53:49.624 --> 53:52.586
And then once we did that, the sequence wasn't quite perfect.

53:53.046 --> 53:54.287
Nobody does that.

53:57.248 --> 53:58.749
And so this is a mythology.

53:58.829 --> 54:04.793
Mythology told on a giant podcast about a book that I helped, the nominated

54:05.925 --> 54:08.154
Secretary for Health and Human Services, right?

54:08.274 --> 54:11.266
Why is this person lying about it?

54:13.052 --> 54:14.573
necessarily from a laboratory.

54:15.413 --> 54:21.535
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

54:22.155 --> 54:25.596
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

54:25.676 --> 54:29.238
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

54:30.478 --> 54:35.440
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been like a dog in a bone with this problem.

54:36.500 --> 54:39.123
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

54:39.403 --> 54:40.805
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

54:40.825 --> 54:41.465
No, what is that?

54:41.645 --> 54:54.618
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of we need to build a vaccine against this because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

54:55.119 --> 54:57.962
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

54:59.043 --> 55:00.164
You'll have something to leak from this.

55:02.248 --> 55:04.628
Even that statement is absolutely ridiculous.

55:04.648 --> 55:06.329
He doesn't have the reviews from it.

55:06.369 --> 55:08.169
We don't even know if it made it to review.

55:08.249 --> 55:12.170
It was just a document found on a government website and leaked.

55:14.590 --> 55:16.450
And now he says Rixey leaked it.

55:16.510 --> 55:21.551
This is one of the things that I find most intriguing about his statement because Rixey leaked it where?

55:23.272 --> 55:31.113
I know that Rixey had this document with the group Drastic for at least two months before they published it in public.

55:31.869 --> 55:33.730
because they wanted to do a report on it.

55:34.370 --> 55:51.975
And so Rixey, the Marine, the Patriot, the shoe salesman at the start of the pandemic, decided to work with a group of anonymous international people on the platform Twitter to produce a PDF report.

55:53.280 --> 56:03.280
of the defuse proposal rather than, I don't know, going to the FBI or to the government or to the police or to, I don't know, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:03.400 --> 56:04.803
or CHD or

56:06.499 --> 56:18.906
He decided to work with it with a bunch of international meddlers, most of whom I know are liars or traitors to the children of their country because I had contact with all of these people and I don't anymore.

56:19.707 --> 56:27.972
Not one of them has turned out to be a guy or a woman with the integrity to say, well, Jay is a creep, but boy, was he right a long time ago?

56:28.532 --> 56:31.234
None of them have, not one of those people.

56:32.987 --> 56:37.769
And that should show you how dangerously malevolent this was from the very beginning.

56:37.809 --> 56:39.729
Not one of those people has woken up.

56:39.829 --> 56:42.770
Not one of the people in Drastic has woken up.

56:42.810 --> 56:44.851
They are still playing this game.

56:45.331 --> 56:47.712
Most of them have blocked me on that platform.

56:47.752 --> 56:56.815
Now, this guy is trying to tell you that Charles Rixey of Drastic released the defuse proposal, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:56.855 --> 57:02.037
will tell you, and you can look it up on his own social media, that it's Veritas.

57:02.947 --> 57:03.668
who released it.

57:04.829 --> 57:14.580
He even went for a hike with that O'Keefe guy on the day after they released it, because there's a picture of him hiking with Robert F. Kennedy's dogs.

57:16.822 --> 57:24.851
And so it's weird that Veritas says that Sergeant Murphy released the defuse proposal to him.

57:26.257 --> 57:34.399
makes no mention of drastic and no mention of Rixie and the fact that he collaborated with a bunch of anonymous foreigners before he released the document.

57:35.159 --> 57:47.642
And yet here the human, the former human genome project research and development director, Kevin McKernan is insisting that actually it's Charles Rixie, a Marine who's been a dog on a bone with this thing.

57:50.720 --> 58:04.249
This is a crucial kink in their armor because this guy was promoted by CHD with Mary Holland and Brian Hooker about the contamination in the shot.

58:04.649 --> 58:13.975
It is this guy who is working with Ulrich Kammerer in Germany to show that there's some integration of the spike protein into cell lines.

58:15.637 --> 58:17.658
An experiment that I suggested and set up.

58:22.816 --> 58:48.531
It is this guy who was on that stream with me, and Jessica Rose, and John Bodwin, and Stephanie Seneff, where I told him what he would months later called Chemtrail Retarded, but couldn't really come up with any argument for it at the time, and still hasn't provided any argument for it at the time or now, except for that, well, yeah, there's all those sequences on the internet, how could he explain those?

58:49.881 --> 59:01.331
So his insistence on accepting the high fidelity signal and all the data from the CDC and all the data from DITRA is just consistent from the very beginning of the pandemic.

59:01.371 --> 59:05.155
Because in 2020, he was saying that the PCR worked, just not the way the WHO says.

59:06.761 --> 59:10.563
But, as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

59:10.803 --> 59:13.225
We got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

59:13.605 --> 59:18.789
You don't apply with a grant, not having... $30 million of grants from the NIH, and now he's going to say what?

59:18.849 --> 59:22.771
He's going to say that you don't apply for a grant without having it all done.

59:22.831 --> 59:26.614
Now, interestingly, that's what I'm quoted as saying in this book.

59:29.813 --> 59:36.859
And it's in fact one of the things that I was encouraged to see as, don't you understand when Rixie came to my house?

59:37.419 --> 59:40.362
See, Rixie came to my house because I said that.

59:45.946 --> 59:47.548
And so that's quoted in this book.

59:49.569 --> 59:51.171
And so now here he is saying it.

59:52.739 --> 59:56.921
But it's not true for one reason and one reason only, because DARPA doesn't work that way.

59:56.981 --> 01:00:01.283
DARPA calls for grants, and you can't have data for them.

01:00:02.123 --> 01:00:11.988
You know, if they want you to provide a novel means of intergalactic propulsion, then you don't have all of your experiments done before you throw in the application.

01:00:14.169 --> 01:00:15.569
And that's not how DARPA works.

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:20.792
And the question is, what is the grant application for which this grant was submitted?

01:00:25.908 --> 01:00:27.789
Curiously, they don't say anything about that.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.591
And when they do, they're very cryptic about it.

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:30.331
It's okay.

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:30.872
It's okay.

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:32.313
It's not really a big weakness.

01:00:32.353 --> 01:00:34.114
It's just another thing that I always notice.

01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:34.835
Let him keep going.

01:00:35.075 --> 01:00:35.755
Done 80% of it.

01:00:36.256 --> 01:00:38.377
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:41.480
Because you just can't.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:48.385
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows like we can get Xed on.

01:00:48.425 --> 01:00:49.686
We've demonstrated this piece.

01:00:49.706 --> 01:00:50.827
We've demonstrated this piece.

01:00:51.407 --> 01:00:56.792
That's absolutely true for most NIH grants, but it's not true for DARPA grants, and this is a lie.

01:00:58.153 --> 01:01:04.258
And it's a very good lie that they actually used me to tell in this book.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.163
It's one of the six quotes that I am quoted in this book.

01:01:10.283 --> 01:01:14.407
One of them is an excerpt from my podcast with Charles Rixey where I say this.

01:01:16.658 --> 01:01:19.499
I was trapped, ladies and gentlemen, just like a lot of these people.

01:01:19.559 --> 01:01:31.963
Wittingly or unwittingly, you think you're working for the good guys, you think you're fighting for the good guys, and then suddenly, everybody's in front of you saying what you said, but not quite, and moving along without you.

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:43.167
With 10x the number of followers that you have, or even 100x the number of followers you have, supporting them on Substack or wherever else they rake in their laundered money.

01:01:45.478 --> 01:01:46.920
Now we just need to do this last piece.

01:01:48.181 --> 01:01:54.228
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:57.492
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:02.317
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

01:02:02.938 --> 01:02:05.100
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document.

01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:09.845
Now the design of none of these constructs, I'm not arguing with any of it.

01:02:10.265 --> 01:02:12.007
You can make a paper.

01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:16.492
You can design constructs that have a sort of cassette-like function.

01:02:16.972 --> 01:02:19.074
People have studied ion channels this way.

01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:21.657
People have studied the function of lots of proteins this way.

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:33.323
essentially using two restriction enzymes to pop out the active site or pop out the main part of the enzyme and pop in a different one so that they can rapidly mutate a particular site.

01:02:35.564 --> 01:02:37.985
As I said, none of these techniques are new.

01:02:38.545 --> 01:02:40.386
No-see-um is a myth.

01:02:41.567 --> 01:02:43.207
It's just DNA ligation.

01:02:43.888 --> 01:02:49.731
Now he's going to tell you that, ooh, they had this really clever thing and all these signals are present there.

01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:50.351
Well, you know,

01:02:51.957 --> 01:02:53.999
That doesn't mean that's what's going around the earth.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:02.606
And in fact, he will be very imprecise and not ever say to Danny Jones, you know, we didn't track the fear and cleavage site.

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:09.051
We didn't really pay attention to how it changed or if it changed or whether it went away or which strains kept it and which strains didn't.

01:03:10.332 --> 01:03:19.240
And that's a huge, that's a huge failure that I've been identifying over and over again for the past four and a half years now.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:33.943
Your your your your your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain like letters Those and this this is funny this analogy that he uses is actually my analogy from the book But it's a very shitty version of it.

01:03:34.683 --> 01:03:47.686
And in fact, it's so bad That you can tell that he's trying really hard not to just use the one that I used It's it's awesome it is awesome this is

01:03:50.312 --> 01:03:54.004
It's never gonna be more visible than it is right now in 2025 because of Kevin McKernan.

01:03:57.145 --> 01:03:58.126
Those are what restrictions are.

01:03:58.306 --> 01:04:00.188
So imagine you could only cut and paste where there's a the.

01:04:01.049 --> 01:04:07.275
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:16.004
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with there, which is a couple more letters onto the, right?

01:04:16.044 --> 01:04:17.706
And we're going to use those enzymes to cut here.

01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:19.347
And by doing that, we can assemble this genome.

01:04:19.367 --> 01:04:20.809
Well, they had certain restriction.

01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:22.210
See how crappy that is?

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.850
So there has the in it.

01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:27.332
So actually anywhere where you cut with there, you would also cut with the.

01:04:29.493 --> 01:04:31.635
And so those two would be absolutely useless.

01:04:31.655 --> 01:04:33.736
Do you see how stupid that metaphor is?

01:04:33.776 --> 01:04:39.659
That is how bad, that is how bad we are being meddled with right now.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.862
Millions of people will see this in the coming year.

01:04:44.942 --> 01:04:47.163
I guarantee it because YouTube will serve it to them.

01:04:48.376 --> 01:04:59.844
because they have all these guys with funny pope hats smoking weed and breathing into the microphone, all kinds of creepy messages on the same podcast.

01:04:59.864 --> 01:05:08.850
So then after they watch that podcast and laugh about myths of Christianity for three hours, they'll get served this guy's video.

01:05:12.216 --> 01:05:17.020
enzymes in that diffuse proposal that are present in coronavirus that's currently circulating.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.284
And that was kind of the smoking gun that showed that, OK, this was in fact assembled.

01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:23.185
It was a product of the diffuse proposal.

01:05:23.265 --> 01:05:27.689
Someone eventually carried out that that grant application to its final conclusion.

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:29.971
And that's why it's actually circulating.

01:05:30.732 --> 01:05:33.194
And holy wow.

01:05:34.054 --> 01:05:34.615
Holy.

01:05:35.444 --> 01:05:43.994
And so what's happening here is an illusion of consensus is being created where the giver of knowledge is opening the mind of the naive guy.

01:05:44.414 --> 01:05:50.020
And so you as the viewer, you as the listener should also be like, Oh, wow.

01:05:50.661 --> 01:05:51.862
Oh, wow.

01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:53.484
It is awful.

01:05:57.389 --> 01:06:00.451
And he doesn't have to be an unwitting participant.

01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:01.832
He can be a witting participant.

01:06:01.852 --> 01:06:08.657
He can be a full-blown actor being paid to go, oh, wow, that's so amazing.

01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:09.698
I can't believe it.

01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:11.759
Rixie has the whole story on this.

01:06:11.779 --> 01:06:13.761
You want to talk to him and Alex Washburn.

01:06:14.241 --> 01:06:16.103
Alex Washburn did some really interesting work.

01:06:17.203 --> 01:06:24.709
Alex Washburn is a mathematician who doesn't know jack about biology and has been unwittingly roped into this.

01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:31.761
I got woken up in the middle of the night at one in the morning to write an article about Alex Washburn's paper.

01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:34.683
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:34.723 --> 01:06:37.665
was even on the phone a couple times during the writing of that paper.

01:06:37.705 --> 01:06:38.946
We gotta get this paper out.

01:06:38.966 --> 01:06:40.247
We gotta get this article out.

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:44.829
And Charles Rixey actually fell asleep during the writing of that article.

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.872
And there are people at CHD with real names.

01:06:50.393 --> 01:06:59.417
in the acknowledgements of this book that know that story too, because they were up at one in the morning and on that phone call with me and Rixie.

01:07:01.798 --> 01:07:11.103
So all of these stories that he's telling are not just lies because I know, because him and I were in a closet together and he told me the truth.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:15.285
No, ladies and gentlemen, because the events

01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:22.249
that he's explaining and the people that he is attributing them to are incorrect.

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:23.149
They're false.

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:28.591
Sometimes in the English language, we would call a person like this a liar.

01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:34.934
Mapping out the frequencies of these cut sites in all other coronaviruses.

01:07:35.982 --> 01:07:42.065
And only in SARS-CoV-2 do they exist in a manner where they are almost perfectly spaced.

01:07:43.846 --> 01:07:45.487
They build a thing back together in six pieces.

01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:49.689
So the Humpty Dumpty comes back together in a sort of an engineering way.

01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:51.389
And so Shengxi Li

01:07:55.026 --> 01:08:09.238
paid agent of USAID and paid agent of EcoHealth Alliance finds a sequence and then for a year and a half, all of the sequencing of that and monitoring of that is done by the US government and DITRA.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:17.125
Not by a bunch of different labs all around the world, not by a bunch of, you know, independent places like universities and stuff.

01:08:17.205 --> 01:08:22.530
No, all samples are sent to a central location and controlled by DITRA for more than a year and a half.

01:08:26.693 --> 01:08:44.706
And so he's telling us that some sequence that was found on a server and released to Charles Rixey via a group of international meddlers called Drastic proves that the RNA was made and designed in a laboratory and leaked, and then they covered it up.

01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:52.892
It couldn't be that the agent that they paid just did what she was paid to do, which was announce that they found a sequence.

01:08:52.912 --> 01:08:53.633
It couldn't be that.

01:09:00.213 --> 01:09:02.034
through only in SARS-CoV-2.

01:09:02.154 --> 01:09:07.759
If you look at where those restriction sites exist in all the other coronaviruses we know about, they're kind of randomly scattered.

01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.020
They don't look like someone designed them in.

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:16.665
When you look in SARS-CoV-2, they're very perfectly spaced such that an engineer put it together

01:09:17.566 --> 01:09:20.367
And there's a particular set of them near the Fearon cleavage site.

01:09:20.627 --> 01:09:24.829
See, the weird thing is, is that there's recombination in coronaviruses.

01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:37.114
And so the order in which the genes are found in the whole genome and where they're arranged, it's pretty hard to explain how they get so consistent once they start sequencing and follow them around.

01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:42.399
It's almost as if they're kind of making up the biology as they go along.

01:09:54.853 --> 01:09:56.174
was remarkable about.

01:09:56.314 --> 01:09:57.855
And so it's it's weird, right?

01:09:57.915 --> 01:10:03.979
Because again, here's where if you weren't in on it, you wouldn't understand how much of a bullshitter this guy is.

01:10:04.039 --> 01:10:06.241
So he is confounding two different things.

01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:17.428
The first thing he's confounding is the idea that they have this fear and cleavage site surrounded by a couple restriction enzyme sites that allows them to cut and remove that sequence.

01:10:17.488 --> 01:10:24.593
Like, you know, if this was the if this was the fear and cleavage site or this is the ACE2 binding site,

01:10:25.553 --> 01:10:35.358
Then they put these restriction enzymes on either side of it so that when they cut it, that gets removed and then they could like put a different sequence in there like this pen, right?

01:10:36.278 --> 01:10:44.602
And so he's suggesting that this cassette exists and it's so that they could optimize it to binding ACE2.

01:10:46.254 --> 01:10:49.015
But that's not what the diffuse proposal says at all, Kevin.

01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:53.638
As I recall, although I'm not gonna get that document because I'm pretty sure it's fake.

01:10:53.998 --> 01:10:58.540
The diffuse proposal suggests that the fear and cleavage site is swapped in and out.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:06.184
And I'm not sure if, I'm pretty sure that the fear and cleavage site is not the ACE2 binding site.

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:12.047
So that's weird, right?

01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:39.421
That he's not being very specific and very precise about, which is odd, unless he was just being stupid complicated for the sake of confusing everybody to watching this stream and not knowing exactly how malevolent his narrative is, pretending to give away information when in fact he's obfuscating it.

01:11:40.219 --> 01:11:44.182
the zoonosis thesis is that this thing came out pre-optimized.

01:11:44.622 --> 01:11:50.326
Like when we first found SARS coronavirus, the binding affinity to ACE2 was already optimized.

01:11:50.826 --> 01:11:51.947
That's not normal.

01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:58.771
That's also what two different Australian people said from the very beginning of the pandemic, one of whom was involved in drastic very early.

01:11:58.811 --> 01:12:01.393
There's that Quay guy, but then there was this other dude too.

01:12:02.174 --> 01:12:03.715
And I can't, I can see his face.

01:12:03.775 --> 01:12:04.695
I can't remember his name.

01:12:04.715 --> 01:12:04.995
Dang it.

01:12:05.015 --> 01:12:05.756
I got to get that out.

01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:13.581
If this were a zoonotic event, the leap would mean it was unoptimized and would take maybe five or ten years to become more optimized in the population.

01:12:13.721 --> 01:12:23.126
So the person that actually published the data which originally needed to be shut up about this was hired by his old boss, Alina Chan.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:38.455
published a paper in May of 2020 that I covered with two bike rides on YouTube that showed that the SARS virus that was found in Wuhan is the same virus, is the same virus, is the same virus that they keep finding everywhere.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:42.036
And that that was very different than what happened with SARS in 2002.

01:12:42.496 --> 01:12:53.500
And she shows that the SARS virus reported in 2002, when they were able to sequence, it was changing by 10 to 50 amino acids every sequence they found.

01:12:55.677 --> 01:13:01.239
But over the first six months of the pandemic, less than 10 amino acids had changed in SARS-CoV-2.

01:13:01.659 --> 01:13:06.081
And her preprint has not actually been published in a journal.

01:13:09.483 --> 01:13:11.383
Her preprint actually disappeared.

01:13:11.423 --> 01:13:24.689
And instead she became a permanent research scientist, a staff scientist at the Broad Institute at MIT, where the Human Genome Project was set, where the Whitehead Institute is, where Mark Lander is the director.

01:13:26.155 --> 01:13:30.718
Because she works on artificial chromosomes before the pandemic.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.484
And she wrote a book with Matt Ridley that talked all about the lab leak.

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:44.329
And no matter how much I contacted her as a member of DRASTIC in May of 2020, she ignored me more than you can imagine.

01:13:47.391 --> 01:13:48.132
That's where we are.

01:13:51.914 --> 01:13:53.416
Keep going, Kevin, keep digging.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:14:08.826
That's another signature that someone had to have a piece inside the design of this virus that they could swap in and out to put a library in there to commentarily screen for fear and cleavage sites in receptor binding domains.

01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:13.972
Just be careful because the fear and cleavage site is a second cleavage site.

01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.112
There's already one.

01:14:16.873 --> 01:14:20.075
That's why the S1 and S2 subunits come apart.

01:14:21.196 --> 01:14:25.420
That can't happen unless it gets cut twice, otherwise you'd just have something hanging.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:25.840
You see?

01:14:26.301 --> 01:14:35.589
Make sure you read this Molecular Biology and find these cartoons, because the people in the chat that think they know what they're talking about with the S1 and S2 subunits, you only know

01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:38.893
the cartoons you've read or the cartoons you've memorized.

01:14:39.334 --> 01:14:45.364
And if you start checking into it, you will find a lot of incongruencies in this because it's not clear.

01:14:46.285 --> 01:14:50.813
They added the proline so that the spike protein couldn't change configuration.

01:14:52.915 --> 01:14:55.096
and so that it would stay bound in the membrane.

01:14:55.896 --> 01:15:03.598
It's not clear to me that they also altered the fear and cleavage sites so that the S1 subunit would not be released.

01:15:03.698 --> 01:15:09.899
This is something that they very rarely talk about, but in the beginning, the spike protein had an S1 and S2 subunit.

01:15:09.919 --> 01:15:12.860
The S1 subunit went and went into circulation.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:14.260
So that's two cleavage sites.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.240
Make sure you know that.

01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:22.402
That would effectively allow them to reach for optimization out of the gate.

01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:27.428
And so Charles and Alex have a good story around this, about how they use serial passaging.

01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:31.616
So that's the fourth time he's mentioned Charles Rixey, a guy who came to my house.

01:15:31.696 --> 01:15:32.878
Make sure you realize that.

01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:35.964
This is personal for me and my family.

01:15:37.521 --> 01:15:43.722
And the engineering design that they have in this implicate this as being in fact, a weapon that was built.

01:15:44.142 --> 01:15:47.143
And it's not something that hopped over from pangolins and bats and all that stuff.

01:15:47.303 --> 01:15:47.963
Jesus Christ.

01:15:48.263 --> 01:15:48.443
Yeah.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.604
Harvey Reich, I think has another interesting like window on this.

01:15:51.824 --> 01:16:02.385
Harvey Reich is another interesting person to mention because he's part of team worst case scenario that identified a long time ago and have been following for years.

01:16:02.846 --> 01:16:05.346
And I will show you him in photographs later.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:09.393
It's a curious person to mention of all the people he could mention.

01:16:11.894 --> 01:16:15.477
It's worth a view on the Ron Johnson thing that I was at.

01:16:16.457 --> 01:16:19.719
Harvey gave his pitch on like, all right, where the hell did this all come from?

01:16:20.199 --> 01:16:21.840
And how do we avoid doing this again?

01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:28.004
And he had the most compelling synopsis, I think, because everyone's been like, can they be this evil?

01:16:28.044 --> 01:16:28.805
What the hell happened?

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:38.492
Interestingly, although Danny Jones has changed his set, this little spinning triangle has remained exactly where it was.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:40.835
It's just on the new set now.

01:16:41.994 --> 01:16:53.281
I think his story makes the most sense, which is that the biodefense industry, if you will, has always kind of justified itself on that we need to be doing gain-of-function research to protect against a particular weapon.

01:16:53.481 --> 01:16:55.042
And so we're going to preemptively do all this.

01:16:56.462 --> 01:17:01.205
Fast forward to 2020, they've never come up with something they've saved us from.

01:17:01.585 --> 01:17:06.128
And then the first thing that leaks is potentially from their own making, right?

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:06.388
Right.

01:17:07.108 --> 01:17:11.650
So that puts the biodefense industry on their heels in that we have to be in control of the solution to this.

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.671
Otherwise, we're non-existent when this is done.

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:18.393
So let's get Fauci involved because they had him on payroll.

01:17:18.973 --> 01:17:26.557
And of course, Fauci, I think you've probably seen some of those emails and conversations that have come out where it's like, you'll have orders.

01:17:26.697 --> 01:17:27.597
You have things to do.

01:17:27.637 --> 01:17:31.599
He's so arrogantly talking about, you won't, you'll get a vaccine or you'll lose your job.

01:17:31.819 --> 01:17:32.099
Yes.

01:17:32.179 --> 01:17:34.120
The kids will get kicked out of school.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:42.049
his his emails internally that leaked out of the NIH were were like, you'll have things to do tomorrow.

01:17:42.069 --> 01:17:43.010
You must read this paper.

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:49.317
This is a paper about, you know, potential leak right early on this like February and the pandemic where it and so

01:17:49.377 --> 01:18:11.547
So here we are talking about the emails, again, something that could have been easily orchestrated by a biosecurity state that wanted us to be fooled into solving a mystery about a lab leak, and then for five years had people like the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project coordinating this narrative across podcast after podcast after podcast.

01:18:13.067 --> 01:18:14.048
Because that's what happened.

01:18:15.382 --> 01:18:18.724
even if you didn't see all the podcasts they went on.

01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:27.468
If you go digging on BitChute, and Brighteon, and YouTube, and Rumble, and Odyssey, you'll find them.

01:18:27.888 --> 01:18:36.292
You won't find mine, but you'll find lots of theirs because they were full-time, ladies and gentlemen, full-court press from 2020 on.

01:18:38.968 --> 01:18:46.335
it first hit on him that this could have come from money from his pocket, like it could have come from the WIF, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:48.317
And so suddenly Tony's now implicated.

01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:55.503
Seriously, I would believe the possibility that the biosecurity state has fooled Tony Fauci into believing there was a lab leak.

01:18:55.544 --> 01:18:56.845
And I think that it's possible.

01:18:57.345 --> 01:19:02.529
that Tony Fauci is not biologically sophisticated enough to understand that RNA can never pandemic.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.570
That doesn't make any sense at all.

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:09.634
If you believe that evolution because DNA, then it definitely can't pandemic.

01:19:09.674 --> 01:19:10.915
That doesn't make sense.

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:23.944
So maybe Tony Fauci's fooled, but Francis Collins isn't, Mark Lander isn't, Ventner's not, and McCairn's not, because his dad wasn't.

01:19:26.192 --> 01:19:27.592
Just like Brett's dad wasn't.

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:30.894
Just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:19:30.874 --> 01:19:31.654
's dad wasn't.

01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:35.255
And maybe have funding the virus that leaked.

01:19:35.895 --> 01:19:42.057
And suddenly he's in panic mode, sending emails to everyone that night, like, read all this stuff, you'll have assignments tomorrow, like, we gotta get on this.

01:19:42.397 --> 01:19:43.217
And Francis Collins.

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:51.340
The crazy part is, is that Carey Mullis was mentored and had behind him Joshua Lederberg.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.901
And the only guy who ever mentions that

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:56.695
is Mark Kulak.

01:19:58.638 --> 01:20:01.522
Everybody just says Carey Mullis, Carey Mullis, Carey Mullis.

01:20:01.562 --> 01:20:04.487
If you say Carey Mullis, you're saying Joshua Lederberg.

01:20:06.459 --> 01:20:07.400
You just don't know it.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:14.465
Holmes is in there talking about how we have to have a swift takedown of all these conspiracy theories that say it could be engineered.

01:20:14.725 --> 01:20:28.796
Fauci could be guilty because of ignorance, because of people like him behind the scenes, because of people like Francis Collins behind the scenes, because of Rick Bright behind the scenes, because of Stephen Hatfield behind the scenes, because of Robert Malone behind the scenes.

01:20:28.836 --> 01:20:29.877
That's how this works.

01:20:32.478 --> 01:20:47.935
It is a coordinated group of liars, inside and out, public and private, that coordinate these mythologies, perpetuate them to create an illusion of consensus that a lot of people are trapped in, guys.

01:20:48.015 --> 01:20:48.836
A lot of people.

01:20:49.437 --> 01:20:52.821
More people than we probably can imagine right now.

01:20:54.859 --> 01:20:57.622
And so they're in high gear right now trying to cover this up.

01:20:58.403 --> 01:21:14.337
But you know, his take is that that the biodefense program then went to high gear trying to get seen as the only... I want you to imagine the idea that Kerry Mullis came up with a brilliant idea that his friend and colleague Joshua Lederberg understood better than him.

01:21:16.359 --> 01:21:17.400
That's all we're saying.

01:21:18.581 --> 01:21:20.543
That's all we're saying, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:21.323 --> 01:21:36.097
solution to fix this that way they would have a justification for yes something leaked sorry we don't really know who made it but we happen to save the day with a biodefense program having this vaccine ready see this scan and function stuff really needs to happen otherwise we would have been millions of people would have died without this

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:39.820
which is a narrative you hear people try to propagate in the news, right?

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.381
That without this vaccine, it saves 20 million people.

01:21:43.421 --> 01:21:50.544
They conjure up all of these weird epidemiological studies that try to make that case in their own modeling studies that are easily dismantled.

01:21:52.845 --> 01:21:54.946
Remember, he's got to say the truth sometimes, right?

01:21:55.126 --> 01:21:58.748
It's always got to be the truth sometimes, but not all the time.

01:21:58.828 --> 01:21:59.969
So let's get moving here.

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.050
I think that... Let's get moving here.

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:05.492
So where we are is the Timor's case scenario brought us here.

01:22:05.532 --> 01:22:08.413
Timor's case scenario was placed in 2020 and before.

01:22:10.347 --> 01:22:26.959
so that they would have the track record necessary that they're being artificially promoted by the military social control program suite that we call social media, it wouldn't seem odd because they were already out in front.

01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:41.560
And so it's not odd if Mary Holland goes viral at the beginning of the pandemic it's not odd if everybody's following Merrill Nass the bios bioweapons expert at the start of the pandemic and even though, you know,

01:22:42.154 --> 01:22:46.958
Nobody, because of the way social media works, should have any more reach than anybody else.

01:22:47.418 --> 01:22:59.286
It's very clear, again, what I'm trying to say is if you're only going to see 300 tweets, do you think the private owners of this platform are going to allow you to see 300 tweets that are just your followers?

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:08.173
Or are they going to show you things they want you to see because that's what this military social control program suite is supposed to do?

01:23:11.175 --> 01:23:13.876
That's why I can't, I can't win there.

01:23:13.996 --> 01:23:16.317
I need you to share PeerTube.

01:23:16.417 --> 01:23:18.418
I need you to share the Soapbox.

01:23:18.478 --> 01:23:23.440
I need you to share my videos by downloading them and emailing them to other people.

01:23:25.381 --> 01:23:28.262
Downloading them and starting your own YouTube channel with them.

01:23:30.383 --> 01:23:39.547
If every one of my followers started downloading the shorts that Jeff from Earth cuts and then made their own YouTube channel and it was a thousand people did it.

01:23:41.837 --> 01:23:42.658
That would be something.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.522
The shorts are gonna keep coming.

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:52.132
The shorts are very easy to download and the shorts can just be a YouTube channel that you use your email to do.

01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:58.221
And it will be a completely independent, you choose the clips you wanna put up.

01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:03.343
That's the only way we can beat them because my account's turned off.

01:24:03.423 --> 01:24:04.884
It's never gonna be turned on again.

01:24:05.424 --> 01:24:07.966
And if you retweet my account, it's turned off.

01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:12.969
So no one's gonna see it, even though it feels good to tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, retweet, retweet, doesn't happen.

01:24:13.469 --> 01:24:15.070
It doesn't matter, you're just in the chair.

01:24:16.811 --> 01:24:19.672
But it's important to understand that this is a kink in their armor.

01:24:19.712 --> 01:24:24.515
This is an admission because of the track record of this person.

01:24:26.727 --> 01:24:39.952
If he was just minding his own business, sequencing pot and growing pot and helping people get their pot clean until 2023, and then was asked to do an experiment and now is speaking out, that would be very different.

01:24:41.072 --> 01:24:46.474
But that's not at all what Kevin McKernan was engaged in in 2020.

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:46.954
He was central.

01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:52.680
to narrative control in 2020.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.601
And this narrative is the trap.

01:24:54.661 --> 01:25:00.163
It's about a novel virus that millions could die from, that millions more will be saved from because it could be a lab leak.

01:25:04.786 --> 01:25:06.987
And so it's important to put this into context.

01:25:07.767 --> 01:25:11.469
It is a myth full of expected outcomes of this transfection.

01:25:12.551 --> 01:25:34.040
It was a myth full of expected outcomes and all the characters that were given a part of the script were essentially complaining about a spike protein that was doing something that other spike proteins didn't do with the witting or unwitting notion that this was really preparing the population for the expected outcomes when they would start doing that.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:34.820
And they were hidden.

01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:50.419
They were hidden in a discussion about the fear and cleavage site, or the toxic spike, or censorship, or lab leak, or gain of function, or flying aids, or there being no virus at all, or for Kevin McKernan, that PCR works, but it's just not the way the WHO said.

01:25:50.439 --> 01:25:51.100
It's not fair.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.342
Their paper was reviewed in like an hour.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:26:08.241
And so no useful resistance to the biological mythology that was the foundation of the exercise from the very beginning because these people were part of the exercise.

01:26:09.568 --> 01:26:24.652
That's why the guy who said PCR works, just not the way the WHO does it, was a author on the Corman-Jorston Review, and Claire Craig was, and Mike Eden was, and Thomas Binder was, and all the other people that are on there.

01:26:24.772 --> 01:26:35.435
Every one of those people should have to go on record and state why it is that they did it, who contacted them when, and how much they had to do with the writing of that paper.

01:26:37.096 --> 01:26:52.366
because I would bet my family on it, and I am right now, that it was this guy and his teammates that assembled that group to get them tied into what is effectively non-resisting the tenets of the narrative.

01:26:56.260 --> 01:27:00.701
And so in 2020, he was saying that PCR works, but just not theirs.

01:27:00.901 --> 01:27:16.705
In 2021, a whole year and a half later, a year after writing the Corman-Jorston report, he came on my stream to tell me that the RNA isn't pure, that they have live dead technologies that they could have used to sort out the PCR false positivity a long time ago, but they didn't.

01:27:17.266 --> 01:27:18.346
The strains are real.

01:27:20.188 --> 01:27:27.472
And in 2024, he's still saying those same things on Danny Jones, but in addition to that, he's lying about the book.

01:27:30.133 --> 01:27:46.281
And the weird part about it for me, the one that really sticks in my teeth, what bothers me the most is that he's not just lying about the book, but he's inserting a character in the book that for more than three years, I have been consistently saying is a liar and a meddler.

01:27:47.987 --> 01:28:11.115
and for the last two and a half or three years has been consistently collaborating with a guy by the name of Kevin McCairn, who is also a liar and a meddler from the very beginning with ties to George Webb and Paul Cuttrell, and a lot of the other people that were central to starting the curation in the beginning.

01:28:12.775 --> 01:28:17.337
And I think that it's even possible that Kevin McCairn was recruited specifically for me.

01:28:18.547 --> 01:28:23.628
because he contacted me so early and said that he did a postdoc with somebody that I now work with.

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:38.711
That guy, Charles Rixey, came to my house in January of 2022 to convince me to do a stream about the diffuse proposal after three consistent months of me telling him that it was bullshit.

01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:40.772
A couple weeks!

01:28:42.228 --> 01:28:51.392
after Kevin McKernan streamed on my stream and I interviewed him and was completely blown away by his depth of knowledge and oh my goodness, wow, I'm so grateful for you.

01:28:53.172 --> 01:28:54.413
That's not by accident.

01:28:55.654 --> 01:29:04.857
That is a focus of people energy on me and my family to make sure that I would believe a lab leak was just revealed by the evidence that the diffuse proposal represented.

01:29:09.022 --> 01:29:32.661
And if you see the timeline here, we are talking about three years later at the beginning of 2025, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project is going on big podcasts and lying about this guy, who has collaborated with this other guy, who there can be no doubt is just a clown car following us.

01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:36.765
He went to Japan and stayed with him for months.

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:39.407
These guys have been in cars together.

01:29:39.527 --> 01:29:56.544
And the actual reason why he was fired from the editorial group that was writing Bobby's book is because he showed up at a editing Zoom meeting with that guy in the background.

01:30:00.785 --> 01:30:11.188
And people that are in the acknowledgements of this book in the first paragraph, they all know exactly what happened, how it happened, when it happened, and they know that I'm telling the truth.

01:30:11.268 --> 01:30:19.351
And therefore, the Health and Human Services Research and Development Director named Kevin McKernan is not telling the truth.

01:30:20.919 --> 01:30:30.587
I guess he could have been told this and just assumed, because maybe Steve Kirsch told him this, or Robert Malone told him this, but that would only be possible if he didn't know me.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.401
All right, I am here again with Kevin McKernan.

01:30:42.561 --> 01:30:52.605
Kevin is a founder and CEO of Medicinal Genomics and knows... Okay, just to make sure you're listening, she said, I'm here again with Kevin McKernan.

01:30:52.665 --> 01:30:58.987
Now, it looks like she's streaming from her daughter's bedroom and she looks really professional.

01:30:59.027 --> 01:31:00.748
I'm sure she's got thousands of viewers.

01:31:01.168 --> 01:31:05.650
So this is the second time that Kevin McKernan is gonna be on her stream in October of 2020.

01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:08.531
And he's gonna talk about, let's see what.

01:31:10.034 --> 01:31:13.136
a bunch about he designs tests, knows a bunch about testing.

01:31:13.236 --> 01:31:14.537
And so I'm going to ask him about that.

01:31:14.557 --> 01:31:23.044
I'm also going to ask him some other questions related to the development of the mRNA vaccine, which, well, you can

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:29.645
Not that you're an expert on that, but I think you might have some insights into what they're trying to do there.

01:31:29.725 --> 01:31:33.950
So my first question is, first, welcome to the show.

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.350
Thank you.

01:31:34.451 --> 01:31:35.852
Thank you for coming back on.

01:31:36.273 --> 01:31:36.553
Yes.

01:31:36.573 --> 01:31:37.754
Thanks for having me again.

01:31:37.774 --> 01:31:39.736
I've been enjoying all the last podcast.

01:31:39.776 --> 01:31:40.858
Now I feel I've got to...

01:31:41.298 --> 01:31:43.680
a higher bar to reach with your most recent guests.

01:31:43.961 --> 01:31:49.846
Oh, so he was on before and he's been watching her podcast grow and get better.

01:31:49.966 --> 01:31:59.535
So he's got so little time or so much time on his hands that he can not only come back to her stream, but he's been watching her other streams and it's really great.

01:32:00.355 --> 01:32:00.636
Huh.

01:32:02.097 --> 01:32:02.637
Interesting.

01:32:04.179 --> 01:32:06.101
Yeah, I've had some good ones.

01:32:06.181 --> 01:32:06.941
I've had some good ones.

01:32:09.554 --> 01:32:10.514
I've had some good ones.

01:32:10.554 --> 01:32:14.456
Maybe we'll check and see what other good ones she's had in a little bit.

01:32:14.476 --> 01:32:17.977
Let's go forward to July 2021, where he's on her show again.

01:32:17.997 --> 01:32:19.178
I hate that voice.

01:32:19.918 --> 01:32:20.498
All right.

01:32:20.578 --> 01:32:22.419
I'm back here again with Kevin McKernan.

01:32:22.739 --> 01:32:30.122
Kevin's been on the show before, knows quite a lot about genetic science, knows actually quite a lot about patent law.

01:32:31.002 --> 01:32:36.524
And so I've asked you here today to talk about this video that's kind of gone viral.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:40.653
with David Martin and Rainer Fumich.

01:32:40.673 --> 01:32:41.854
I hope I'm saying that right.

01:32:44.315 --> 01:32:55.101
Basically, David Martin is in the business of looking at intellectual property and he has closely looked at all of these patents that have been filed for decades.

01:32:55.941 --> 01:33:00.524
And he's got a bunch of claims in this video and then in the document that he links to.

01:33:02.345 --> 01:33:04.286
But one of the main claims is that

01:33:05.814 --> 01:33:17.103
what we are now calling the novel parts of SARS-CoV-2, the things that define it as a novel virus, were actually patented many, many years ago.

01:33:17.123 --> 01:33:20.926
And that there are multiple patents on these components.

01:33:22.627 --> 01:33:26.470
So I wanted- So she did say that he knows a lot about patent law, right?

01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:28.732
So now she's bringing him back for more expertise.

01:33:28.792 --> 01:33:31.374
And she's gonna talk about this video that went viral.

01:33:32.728 --> 01:33:38.051
with David Martin and the Corona Investigative Committee with Reiner Fulmik.

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:38.632
So here we go.

01:33:38.672 --> 01:33:39.913
I probably spelled his name wrong.

01:33:39.953 --> 01:33:40.633
I apologize.

01:33:42.174 --> 01:33:44.615
Well, my first question, first of all, welcome to the show again.

01:33:44.635 --> 01:33:44.996
Thanks.

01:33:45.016 --> 01:33:45.976
Thanks for coming back.

01:33:46.517 --> 01:33:48.198
So that's at least three times, by the way.

01:33:48.218 --> 01:33:54.201
My first question to you is, what does it mean to patent genetic material?

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:58.324
What does it mean to patent a genetic sequence or a genome?

01:33:59.130 --> 01:34:03.015
So that's a good question that the definition of that has changed over time.

01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:06.379
So David is mostly pointing at a 2003 patent.

01:34:06.439 --> 01:34:08.041
There's a lot of patents.

01:34:08.141 --> 01:34:17.032
And so what is happening here is what I've described as an illusion of consensus about with whom to argue and what to argue about.

01:34:18.055 --> 01:34:22.423
And so David Martin is an authority, and Kevin agrees.

01:34:23.144 --> 01:34:30.918
David Martin is asking relevant questions, and Kevin agrees that there are solutions or answers to those problems that need to be discussed.

01:34:34.738 --> 01:34:39.459
Would it surprise you that there's even another video that he did with her and what it might be about?

01:34:39.539 --> 01:34:49.941
I can't touch on them all and it'll probably go beyond the scope of the show, but he led off that Reiner interview speaking about a particular CDC patent on the SARS-CoV-1 genome.

01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:53.262
This is not the current one in circulation, but the one that was found in 2003, 2004.

01:34:56.103 --> 01:34:57.943
Think about the details that he knows.

01:34:58.063 --> 01:34:59.203
Oh no, you're mistaken.

01:34:59.243 --> 01:35:01.384
He's already got the script right in front of him.

01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:08.897
The first thing I'd like to talk to you about is this, and then he just goes on as if he got asked a question that he has an obvious answer to.

01:35:08.917 --> 01:35:14.482
Because it is an obvious, I mean, that's what happens when you're on a script and someone's reading it.

01:35:14.702 --> 01:35:16.904
EC did in fact file a patent on that.

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:25.172
The claim language in there that they filed on was an isolated nucleic acid, and that language we'll touch on is fairly important.

01:35:26.416 --> 01:35:28.937
Now there is some case law around this.

01:35:28.997 --> 01:35:36.818
I was involved in dealing with a lot of this case law because we had a clinical sequencing company sequencing kids for epilepsy and mitochondrial disease.

01:35:37.038 --> 01:35:39.399
Sequencing kids.

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.960
I like to sequence kids.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.161
I had a company where we were sequencing kids.

01:35:50.964 --> 01:35:52.725
But I'm sure this isn't about remnants.

01:35:52.765 --> 01:35:56.348
This isn't about sequencing people and matching it to their medical records.

01:35:56.608 --> 01:35:58.469
Of course, it's nothing to do with that.

01:35:58.909 --> 01:36:01.251
This is just an innocent pot sequencer.

01:36:02.532 --> 01:36:04.293
And this was after the Human Genome Project.

01:36:04.933 --> 01:36:07.795
And suddenly there was 4,000 gene patents all over the place.

01:36:08.536 --> 01:36:10.557
And it was difficult to navigate all those.

01:36:10.637 --> 01:36:14.220
And many may be aware of a space with a particular household name known as Myriad.

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.461
Myriad had patents on the BRCA1 gene.

01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:19.123
And so this got very controversial and eventually went back

01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:33.217
Now, patents are really interesting from the perspective of pharmaceuticals because for a patent on a gene would allow you to produce the protein, you know, because you have a patent on the gene and the gene is necessary to produce the biologic.

01:36:33.257 --> 01:36:37.740
And so he has indeed been in this space for a very long time.

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.182
And so he probably has a lot more insights than he's offered.

01:36:41.222 --> 01:36:45.805
And in fact, I think his track record supports that conclusion in spades.

01:36:47.788 --> 01:36:53.362
And the scope of patent eligibility changed with some work from Justice Thomas Clarence.

01:36:57.492 --> 01:36:58.072
hate that voice.

01:36:58.833 --> 01:36:59.553
All right.

01:36:59.573 --> 01:37:01.154
So that was in 2013.

01:37:01.294 --> 01:37:06.497
And at some point in time, the antibody patent paradox comes out in the Yale Law School review.

01:37:06.637 --> 01:37:24.607
And also in as part of a opinion written by Gorsuch, I think it was in 2003 at 23, where much of the biology that supposedly supported the patenting of antibodies was dismissed as no longer being as fidelitous as they said, as

01:37:25.027 --> 01:37:26.108
high fidelity, as they say.

01:37:26.128 --> 01:37:27.829
I don't know what I said, fidelity, that's not right.

01:37:28.769 --> 01:37:32.031
So, you remember, you will recall, I think there's one more.

01:37:32.051 --> 01:37:35.612
Let me just make sure I know where I'm going here with my slides.

01:37:36.233 --> 01:37:36.873
Yeah, there's one more.

01:37:36.913 --> 01:37:37.693
Hold on one second.

01:37:42.716 --> 01:37:43.936
And so, we can go to February.

01:37:43.956 --> 01:37:44.537
Kevin McKernan.

01:37:44.697 --> 01:37:47.138
Kevin is Director of Medicinal Genomics.

01:37:47.558 --> 01:37:48.759
He's been very

01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:51.423
So we can go to February 2023 now.

01:37:51.483 --> 01:37:52.885
So here's that line, right?

01:37:52.945 --> 01:37:59.652
February 2023 is about three and a half months after Kevin McCairn came to my house in Pittsburgh.

01:38:00.212 --> 01:38:06.379
And it is a full, let's say a year and one month after Rixey came to my house.

01:38:06.879 --> 01:38:07.980
And so we're in February of 2023.

01:38:08.861 --> 01:38:11.344
What's, what's he going to be on the show for this time?

01:38:12.379 --> 01:38:24.708
active in the COVID space and over the last few years, very prolific in writing about lots of things from the sort of fraud of PCR tests to the fraud of peer review.

01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:31.653
And I've brought Kevin on the show today to talk, first of all, welcome to the show again.

01:38:33.935 --> 01:38:38.118
And I have brought Kevin on today to talk about something that's been in the news

01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:55.783
in a big way, the recent Project Veritas video purporting to show a Pfizer executive who is going on about how Pfizer is looking at doing, he doesn't call it gain of function, he calls it directed evolution experiments.

01:38:56.784 --> 01:39:01.608
And that, of course, ignited an uproar across.

01:39:02.028 --> 01:39:07.012
Now, of course, on the Danny Jones podcast that I am focused on here,

01:39:08.653 --> 01:39:14.356
He actually doesn't mention this part, even though he definitely has discussed it here with her.

01:39:14.896 --> 01:39:24.160
And he doesn't mention the fact that Veritas released this video of Pfizer guys who were enriching the coronavirus in their lab to test the new versions of the vaccine.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:32.123
He makes no reference to that at all and instead says Rixey released the diffuse proposal and the diffuse proposal proves that this works.

01:39:32.624 --> 01:39:34.865
So it's a really interesting place for him to be

01:39:36.093 --> 01:39:49.865
actually a full year ago or more saying things about Veritas, but then in 2024 ignoring that Veritas released the diffuse proposal because that's what is in this book.

01:39:50.386 --> 01:39:51.106
It's weird, right?

01:39:51.426 --> 01:39:52.187
It's so weird.

01:39:52.307 --> 01:39:53.208
I don't know what he's doing.

01:39:53.949 --> 01:39:57.312
I don't know why he's doing it other than he's working against us.

01:39:57.612 --> 01:39:59.033
Across the world as it should.

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:01.974
with Kevin McKernan.

01:40:02.154 --> 01:40:04.595
Kevin is Director of Medicinal Genomics.

01:40:05.035 --> 01:40:19.299
He's been very active in the COVID space and over the last few years, very prolific in writing about lots of things from the sort of fraud of PCR tests to the fraud of peer review.

01:40:21.159 --> 01:40:24.600
And I've brought Kevin on the show today to talk.

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.181
First of all, welcome to the show again.

01:40:28.519 --> 01:40:36.141
And I have brought Kevin on today to talk about something that's been in the news in a big way.

01:40:37.001 --> 01:40:50.363
The recent Project Veritas video purporting to show a Pfizer executive who is going on about how Pfizer is looking at doing, he doesn't call it gain of function, he calls it directed evolution experiments.

01:40:51.384 --> 01:40:57.805
And that of course ignited an uproar across the world as it should.

01:40:58.946 --> 01:41:00.567
I mean, none of the writing has to be him.

01:41:00.607 --> 01:41:05.072
How much of the writing of Paul Alexander's substack is actually Paul Alexander?

01:41:05.812 --> 01:41:09.956
How much of the writing of Sasha Latupova is actually Sasha Latupova?

01:41:09.996 --> 01:41:19.446
How many of the three substacks a day, the average of 12 per week, that somebody like Jessica Hockett or Robert Malone puts out, how much of that is actually theirs?

01:41:19.486 --> 01:41:20.807
That's what we're dealing with here.

01:41:26.161 --> 01:41:40.326
If you turn over your substack to the military industrial complex that's running this operation and let them write whatever they want to and you just take the proceeds of it and be the shrugging the shoulders hero guy, you know exactly what these people are.

01:41:41.546 --> 01:41:46.148
They had no idea that they'd be here in 2025, that they'd still have to stick to the script.

01:41:47.247 --> 01:41:50.788
that they would still be actively sustaining it through their performances.

01:41:50.828 --> 01:42:00.030
They thought by now, there'd be a bunch of unwitting people all around the world that would be shouting this from the rooftops and their job would have been done years ago, but it's not because of us.

01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:10.872
Because of Mark, because of Grace's dad, because of Joe Marshall, because of Uwe Alschner, because of the people that are really fighting

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:30.269
With Kevin McKernan, Kevin is director of medicinal genomics, he's been very active in the in the COVID space, and that you know of course ignited an uproar across across the world as it should.

01:42:31.946 --> 01:42:33.207
It's Kevin McKernan.

01:42:33.387 --> 01:42:35.228
Kevin is director of medicine.

01:42:35.248 --> 01:42:35.688
Oh, sorry.

01:42:35.768 --> 01:42:36.328
OK.

01:42:36.569 --> 01:42:38.550
I didn't realize it was wrapping around so fast.

01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:40.231
So if we go back.

01:42:40.251 --> 01:42:42.912
OK, I'm here today with Meryl Nass.

01:42:43.392 --> 01:42:47.114
And look at who she's had on, you know, that made her podcast so good.

01:42:47.175 --> 01:42:54.499
Interestingly, in February of 2021, she had somebody I know as an absolute meddler for sure.

01:42:55.598 --> 01:42:56.779
from years ago.

01:42:56.799 --> 01:43:00.642
And this is a very interesting introduction, February, 2021.

01:43:01.563 --> 01:43:02.063
Let's hear it.

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:04.505
She has, you may have seen some of her articles.

01:43:04.585 --> 01:43:08.628
She had a fantastic article about hydroxychloroquine quite a while ago.

01:43:09.428 --> 01:43:18.575
And more recently, um, this piece, shameless manipulation, positive PCR tests drop after who instructs vendors to lower cycle thresholds.

01:43:18.756 --> 01:43:20.017
We have been played like a fiddle.

01:43:20.637 --> 01:43:23.079
Um, so welcome to the show.

01:43:24.381 --> 01:43:30.626
I just, as background, Meryl has been an internal medicine physician for 40 years, is that right?

01:43:31.546 --> 01:43:41.214
And what got you, why are you so interested in the testing, the whole sort of theology?

01:43:41.254 --> 01:43:42.475
See how she's being played?

01:43:42.515 --> 01:43:44.756
She doesn't even know why she's talking to this lady.

01:43:44.796 --> 01:43:46.618
Why are you so interested in this stuff?

01:43:47.438 --> 01:43:48.159
Who the hell are you?

01:43:50.342 --> 01:43:57.007
So Kevin McKernan is going on a podcast of a person who's not even masquerading as a journalist.

01:43:58.948 --> 01:44:06.233
I mean, really, is she really interviewing Meryl Nass, having not found her blog or looked up CHD, or really?

01:44:07.013 --> 01:44:10.476
Sounds a lot like every person I've ever been interviewed by.

01:44:10.496 --> 01:44:14.358
Holy Moses.

01:44:14.839 --> 01:44:18.281
Oscar, that we're finding ourselves in the middle of, what got you interested in this?

01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:26.236
Well, I've been an activist my adult life.

01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:38.432
And I have a background that luckily makes me able to understand what's going on with COVID in a lot of different ways.

01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:44.879
Most important thing to understand here is that she's introducing herself for the first time to this woman.

01:44:44.939 --> 01:44:46.060
It seems pretty obvious.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.566
So, somebody like this, who's been working for this long, should probably have a couple big messages.

01:44:52.606 --> 01:44:56.469
A couple, you know, quick through the corner, this is what I'm about.

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:59.275
And so what are those messages?

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:08.104
If I was to come on the podcast for the first time, what I would say was, you know, I was a guy who didn't know anything before the pandemic, but now I've come to understand the U.S.

01:45:08.144 --> 01:45:09.926
vaccine schedule as being criminal.

01:45:10.307 --> 01:45:14.291
I've come to understand it's RNA incapable of being a pandemic.

01:45:14.791 --> 01:45:18.756
And I've come to understand intramuscular injection is probably being dumb in general.

01:45:20.558 --> 01:45:21.659
And so how did I get here?

01:45:21.699 --> 01:45:23.921
Well, you know, I was a biologist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:45:23.941 --> 01:45:29.725
And so that's how you open an interview when you have a message.

01:45:31.386 --> 01:45:35.890
And so it's very clear that she's not going to say the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal.

01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:41.314
And I knew that before the pandemic, she's not going to say anything remotely close to that.

01:45:42.354 --> 01:45:47.278
Instead, she's going to toot her own horn for 20 minutes, February, 2021.

01:45:49.665 --> 01:45:53.647
So I have a background working in biological warfare.

01:45:54.048 --> 01:46:03.613
I investigated and was able to uncover, I'm the first person who's done this, investigated an epidemic using its features.

01:46:03.973 --> 01:46:05.034
Where is she looking?

01:46:05.254 --> 01:46:06.415
Where are her eyes?

01:46:06.435 --> 01:46:13.299
And statistical information and shown it was due to biological warfare.

01:46:13.359 --> 01:46:14.059
And I did that in 1992.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:14.740
I

01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:31.916
try anything that's obviously incorrect or a lie or is harmful to people, if I can use my expertise to help to uncover it or make sense of it, I do that.

01:46:32.556 --> 01:46:35.837
So I have a fairly good science background.

01:46:35.937 --> 01:46:38.779
I got a bachelor's degree in biology from MIT.

01:46:38.799 --> 01:46:42.320
I went to medical school and did an internal medicine residency.

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:48.134
I worked as an internist doing all the things.

01:46:48.734 --> 01:46:50.796
I mean, Steve Kirsch is MIT.

01:46:51.257 --> 01:46:53.059
Stephanie Seneff is MIT.

01:46:53.079 --> 01:46:58.364
I don't think I know anybody that went through MIT that I would consider.

01:46:58.404 --> 01:47:00.466
I mean, this is just done for me.

01:47:00.526 --> 01:47:01.127
This is done.

01:47:01.167 --> 01:47:05.651
But just keep listening to how much of an admission it is in February of 2021 when played in 2025.

01:47:08.254 --> 01:47:10.237
internal medicine doctors do.

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:16.944
So I've worked in the ER, in the ICU, in hospitals, and then also seen outpatients.

01:47:17.705 --> 01:47:20.469
I've also had to sort of design

01:47:21.997 --> 01:47:31.399
treatment programs and evaluation programs for lots of people who got sick from Gulf War syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and anthrax vaccine.

01:47:32.019 --> 01:47:35.500
So why not list all the times when the narrative had to be controlled?

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.541
Why not just list every single time the narrative had to be controlled?

01:47:39.561 --> 01:47:47.423
The chronic fatigue syndrome thing was also intimately intertwined with Robert Malone and Mickiewicz's labs.

01:47:48.443 --> 01:47:53.025
and the AIDS crisis, which she doesn't mention at all here in her list of heroics.

01:47:53.565 --> 01:48:05.510
The anthrax vaccine and the records that come from it show her and Robert Malone and Veera Sharma all in the same congressional transcript.

01:48:09.012 --> 01:48:12.633
And I think that was in 2011 or 2002 or whatever.

01:48:12.673 --> 01:48:14.614
You know, it's like, come on, guys.

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.010
These people are put in place.

01:48:20.472 --> 01:48:21.933
And sometimes other vaccines.

01:48:22.033 --> 01:48:28.898
So, and in the middle of all that, I... And sometimes other vaccines.

01:48:28.978 --> 01:48:34.422
What kind of a message is this from somebody who works at CHD as the primary scientific advisor?

01:48:35.443 --> 01:48:38.845
How much is she really putting on the line as an old lady at this point?

01:48:39.586 --> 01:48:41.487
She's certainly not risking it all.

01:48:42.248 --> 01:48:44.029
She hasn't even said anything yet.

01:48:47.196 --> 01:48:52.941
I've testified to six different congressional committees and several Institute of Medicine committees.

01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:57.745
I've been quoted in all major U.S.

01:48:57.805 --> 01:49:08.974
newspapers and major other media, given lots of talks at conferences, written about 35 papers.

01:49:09.495 --> 01:49:13.378
And she has no message in February of 2021, no message at all.

01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:21.809
She's still justifying why you should listen to her.

01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:27.370
But if the message was good, the justification could be left for later.

01:49:28.210 --> 01:49:40.572
If you got a really good suggestion on how not to screw up the meal that I'm currently cooking, it might be better for you not to talk for 20 minutes about all the restaurants you worked in and just tell me that I'll burn the butter if I don't turn it down.

01:49:42.233 --> 01:49:43.733
That's how stupid this is.

01:49:46.633 --> 01:49:58.044
So anyway, I have the science background, the medicine background, and the ability to look for information and figure things out.

01:49:58.965 --> 01:50:01.448
Funny, that's what my first bike ride starts with.

01:50:01.488 --> 01:50:03.169
You want to see it, I'll show you on YouTube.

01:50:03.249 --> 01:50:04.631
It's hilarious.

01:50:04.651 --> 01:50:07.954
You, you, you monster.

01:50:09.275 --> 01:50:10.937
You traitor to my children.

01:50:13.908 --> 01:50:16.330
You traitor to my children!

01:50:20.953 --> 01:50:22.214
I'm gonna play this music.

01:50:22.254 --> 01:50:23.495
You're gonna love this beginning.

01:50:23.515 --> 01:50:24.776
You probably don't even remember it.

01:50:24.836 --> 01:50:28.418
It's so friggin' cool.

01:50:28.438 --> 01:50:30.099
There's the Alina Chan one.

01:50:30.139 --> 01:50:31.921
There's the special report.

01:50:32.001 --> 01:50:33.141
There's that one.

01:50:33.241 --> 01:50:34.322
Full on cut.

01:50:34.482 --> 01:50:36.003
Let's take a bike ride.

01:50:36.103 --> 01:50:36.424
Next.

01:50:37.985 --> 01:50:40.166
This here.

01:50:40.226 --> 01:50:41.187
Coronavirus.

01:50:41.607 --> 01:50:42.268
La la la.

01:50:43.476 --> 01:50:45.257
Coronavirus, is that the first one?

01:50:45.357 --> 01:50:46.417
February 16th.

01:50:46.457 --> 01:50:47.698
I think this is the first one.

01:50:47.718 --> 01:50:51.319
And this should block it.

01:50:51.439 --> 01:50:52.019
Yep, good.

01:50:52.459 --> 01:50:55.841
So we're gonna slide this one over here and we're just gonna see it for now, right?

01:50:55.861 --> 01:50:57.541
So let's just, this is it.

01:51:00.843 --> 01:51:01.883
I can read about stuff.

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:04.364
This is JC on a bike.

01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:22.090
I lost that house.

01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:24.172
I lost this life.

01:51:25.833 --> 01:51:26.534
I lost this.

01:51:28.956 --> 01:51:30.718
This is evidence of me innocent.

01:51:32.219 --> 01:51:33.961
This is evidence of me taken.

01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:41.428
And I'm not ashamed of it.

01:51:41.708 --> 01:51:43.089
Good evening, Pittsburgh and universe.

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.330
This is JC on a bike.

01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:46.392
My name is JC and this is Journal Club on a bike.

01:51:48.871 --> 01:51:51.472
This is a special episode about the coronavirus outbreak.

01:51:54.553 --> 01:51:55.693
I'm not a virologist.

01:51:55.773 --> 01:51:58.894
I'm a neurobiologist, but I'm a broadly trained biologist.

01:51:58.934 --> 01:52:01.475
So I can read about stuff.

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.295
I can read about stuff.

01:52:05.176 --> 01:52:06.676
Make judgments about whether it sounds.

01:52:06.996 --> 01:52:11.618
And so she's saying that she's, you know, she's got the track record and the skill set.

01:52:13.218 --> 01:52:16.459
So I got in for information and figure things out.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.460
So, um,

01:52:19.665 --> 01:52:27.650
Anyway, I have the science background, the medicine background, and the ability to look for information and figure things out.

01:52:28.671 --> 01:52:37.757
And so I got into the issue of, is CDC counting cases directly?

01:52:39.508 --> 01:52:42.670
recommendations helping us to diagnose cases correctly.

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:46.813
Essentially the work that she was doing for CHD is irrelevant now.

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:48.194
It's not need to be mentioned.

01:52:48.254 --> 01:53:00.081
I don't need to say that I was working for CHD and CHD is trying to stop the vaccine schedule or curtail it or or bring truth to it or fight for the health of children who were injured by vaccines.

01:53:00.481 --> 01:53:02.603
She didn't even mention it!

01:53:05.822 --> 01:53:16.668
Wouldn't you think that her life was actually culminating in the work that she was doing at CHD with the glorious Patriot Mary Holland and the glorious Patriot Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:53:17.808 --> 01:53:19.389
She didn't even mention it!

01:53:24.812 --> 01:53:26.373
That's a hell of a resume.

01:53:26.393 --> 01:53:31.896
Yeah, and treat them correctly.

01:53:35.225 --> 01:53:44.588
So Kevin McKernan on random podcasts multiple times, four or five times in the first year of the pandemic, not just that random chick.

01:53:45.789 --> 01:53:52.331
Don't forget about the Vance Crowe podcast three times in 2020 where he said PCR works, but just not theirs.

01:53:52.631 --> 01:53:56.992
That the FDA is a real pain in the ass because EUAs are like 10 pages of paperwork.

01:53:57.353 --> 01:54:03.455
And if it wasn't for the FDA, we'd probably already be out of this because they're holding back all the repurposed drugs too.

01:54:03.835 --> 01:54:04.455
Stop lying.

01:54:11.564 --> 01:54:24.054
The thing is about the video in 2024 is that you must view this video in the context of his track record as a dissident, as an outspoken information source.

01:54:26.296 --> 01:54:35.203
If you do the due diligence like I've been forced to because he's meddled with my family in particular, he's not just some guy I know on Twitter.

01:54:37.574 --> 01:54:55.180
And if you don't start evaluating these people in the context of their track record by looking at their history of words and statements or actions or lack thereof, you will be fooled by the same illusion of consensus that these people have been curating since the beginning of this mess.

01:54:57.201 --> 01:55:00.222
And yes, there are more people that you can see that are doing it.

01:55:00.262 --> 01:55:04.344
You could look and you could find more people because this list is long.

01:55:05.970 --> 01:55:10.311
And they hid all kinds of damage stories in this narrative.

01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:27.975
Cardiac damage was something that Richard Fleming was going on Kevin McCarron's podcast month after month after month to say that spike protein was hurting people's hearts before transfection started.

01:55:28.335 --> 01:55:33.656
And also, Richard Fleming had his own private protocol that included remdesivir.

01:55:35.947 --> 01:55:36.648
You didn't know that?

01:55:36.748 --> 01:55:37.789
Oh, that's weird, isn't it?

01:55:37.809 --> 01:55:38.669
That you didn't know that?

01:55:39.810 --> 01:55:41.051
Mitochondrial damage?

01:55:41.091 --> 01:55:43.554
How many people were talking about mitochondrial damage?

01:55:43.574 --> 01:55:45.876
And for how long were they associating with the spike?

01:55:46.276 --> 01:55:51.701
And how many more people besides Walter Chestnut and Jessica Rose and Kevin McCarron were doing it?

01:55:51.801 --> 01:55:52.702
Lots of them were.

01:55:53.342 --> 01:55:59.828
Including the guy Vajon Health, who was just on Steve Kirsch's little podcast a couple weeks ago.

01:56:01.479 --> 01:56:03.000
prions, amyloid.

01:56:03.681 --> 01:56:08.685
That was all the stuff that these lab leak and gain-of-function people were talking about the flying AIDS people.

01:56:10.406 --> 01:56:14.189
And we're really viciously opposed to all these people saying there's no virus.

01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:20.314
Kevin McKernan was just probably the coordinator of all this bullshit, or one of them.

01:56:21.695 --> 01:56:29.341
There's no other way to explain his presence all over the internet with these people, including Vance Crowe, who was a former employee of the World Bank.

01:56:30.407 --> 01:56:36.740
who just decided to podcast in 2020 because I don't know, just like that girl with the white headphones just decided to podcast.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.161
I don't know.

01:56:37.482 --> 01:56:38.343
Who are you Merrill?

01:56:38.384 --> 01:56:39.566
Why do I have to interview you?

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.702
So these people were put in place as team worst case scenario.

01:56:47.742 --> 01:56:53.304
And the only thing that's required for this to go forward is for them to stay spectacularly committed to the lie.

01:56:53.804 --> 01:57:09.592
No matter how many times they have to lie about me, no matter how many times they have to distract people from me or obfuscate my message or try to co-opt parts of it, they will stay spectacularly committed to this lie until you call them out.

01:57:12.031 --> 01:57:19.694
Like I'm calling them out by putting their face and name on social media and detailing exactly what they are lying about and why.

01:57:20.194 --> 01:57:22.795
How long they have known it's a lie, I can't tell you.

01:57:23.495 --> 01:57:35.459
But I know that these people have known that I've had a better message, a clearer message, a simpler message that could disrupt and dismantle the entire public health system for at least two and a half years because Bobby heard it live.

01:57:38.015 --> 01:57:40.656
Because Steve Kirsch's steering committee has heard it live.

01:57:40.696 --> 01:57:42.596
Because John Boedeman has heard it live.

01:57:42.656 --> 01:57:44.737
Because Robert Malone has heard it live.

01:57:44.777 --> 01:57:46.117
Meryl Nass has heard it live.

01:57:46.177 --> 01:57:46.937
They all know.

01:57:47.437 --> 01:57:49.238
Years ago they heard it from me already.

01:57:50.298 --> 01:58:04.521
And it is very conspicuous that Kevin McKernan was in front of the Senate as part of this team worst case scenario that includes Robert Malone and his wife, that Jessica Rose and Ryan Cole and Brett Weinstein.

01:58:06.823 --> 01:58:19.675
These are the people who covered up the real truth that there was an expected rise in all-cause mortality coming and that the population pyramid showed it to us decades ago because there was some big families for a while after World War II.

01:58:20.256 --> 01:58:23.119
And that wasn't very good for the population of the Earth's trends.

01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:27.141
So they told us that a mystery virus was coming.

01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:30.822
Even Fauci told us three years before it came because he knew it was coming.

01:58:30.882 --> 01:58:38.244
The bump in all-cause mortality was coming and the need to manage it with murder and lies was inevitable.

01:58:40.104 --> 01:58:46.386
That's why none of the people that are on social media that have risen to have 100,000 followers and get their tweets

01:58:47.560 --> 01:59:08.224
gets seen by tens of thousands of people, have never mentioned this list of obvious murder, of obvious lies, obfuscating murder, that include the opioid epidemic in America, that include the use of supplementary oxygen in 2020, the overuse of ventilators, the lack of antibiotics, and it goes on and on and on.

01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:19.596
There is no epidemiological evidence of spread and somebody like Denny Rancor has been saying that from the beginning of the pandemic but not correcting anybody when they don't.

01:59:21.918 --> 01:59:35.468
That's why we don't have any lawyers explaining to you what strict scrutiny is and why we might want to hold the government to it under certain circumstances and instead are kind of sort of focusing on strict liability without actually explaining that either.

01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:39.411
Yes, Aaron Seery.

01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:44.173
is a fake lawyer, a liar, a traitor to our children.

01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:49.457
Yes, Mary Holland is a liar, a fake lawyer, a traitor to our children.

01:59:49.537 --> 01:59:52.779
And I am saying it because they cannot deny it.

01:59:53.139 --> 01:59:54.841
Their track record reveals it.

01:59:55.541 --> 01:59:58.303
the things that they submit to court to reveal it.

01:59:58.823 --> 02:00:19.516
Aaron Seery's latest two submissions in I Believe Texas and Louisiana are a joke and any lawyer that read it would realize that the government in its response to his filings states very clearly that this is not a challenge to anything this is a whiff and uh and so thanks for playing

02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:27.493
And that's why they keep talking smack, but not winning anything.

02:00:29.635 --> 02:00:31.596
Because they're all fake, ladies and gentlemen.

02:00:32.857 --> 02:00:39.681
And Kevin McKernan being in this little team worst case scenario is very, very unfortunate.

02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:41.643
But it's definitely real.

02:00:42.363 --> 02:00:49.288
Because this same team worst case scenario was in Romania a few months before that Senate hearing.

02:00:50.782 --> 02:00:58.509
telling all the same bullshit, and more importantly, that's where they all saw Denny Rancourt show that there was zero epidemiological evidence of spread.

02:00:59.030 --> 02:01:12.542
And since that meeting, Denny has had the opportunity to correct them because they've all been saying, Denny Rancourt is a genius and he shows that 17 million people have died from the shot and they completely ignore the first half of his talk and he doesn't care.

02:01:13.263 --> 02:01:15.064
He doesn't care because he's part of it.

02:01:15.664 --> 02:01:28.771
He doesn't care because he's been covering this up and being that guy since May of 2020 to make sure that nobody sees or figures out that the population pyramid was going to increase all-cause mortality.

02:01:29.091 --> 02:01:31.432
He specifically says that that's not a signal.

02:01:33.203 --> 02:01:38.408
And he said it specifically on Jason Levine's podcast, With Me Live, so you can verify it.

02:01:39.369 --> 02:01:47.636
These people are all part of the same show that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan have likely coordinated from America.

02:01:49.258 --> 02:01:58.667
And the other person who I know for sure is involved in this, probably less likely to be really involved because he's such a moron, is Brett Weinstein.

02:01:59.568 --> 02:02:04.329
But for sure, Danny Rancor knows he's involved because he has to have been involved since 2020.

02:02:04.689 --> 02:02:19.651
The way he interacts with me, the way that he doesn't share my work, the way that he promotes himself, and the way that he doesn't attack any of these people for misrepresenting his findings from May, 2020, is absolutely an admission that he is in on it.

02:02:19.691 --> 02:02:28.633
Otherwise, he would have told you already what I'm telling you, that the population pyramid has this really weird bump right here, that when it gets to retirement age,

02:02:29.033 --> 02:02:33.898
could bankrupt any western country and therefore needed to be managed with murder and lies.

02:02:33.938 --> 02:02:34.999
They told you a story.

02:02:37.501 --> 02:02:40.284
They told you a story that Ted Turner was already worried about it.

02:02:40.965 --> 02:02:43.847
He told you about this already years and years ago.

02:02:44.208 --> 02:02:48.512
The reason why social security was going to go bankrupt is because of this problem.

02:02:56.075 --> 02:03:11.513
And so I really think we need a consensus in 2025 about one thing in particular, and that is that the overclass, that's the people that don't need money, could put in place highly trained acolytes to manipulate our habits and opinions by controlling the questions we asked,

02:03:12.034 --> 02:03:15.596
and the answers we arrived at to trick us into believing anything.

02:03:15.996 --> 02:03:27.881
And I'm talking about Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, everybody that's on podcasts with these mouth-breathing fake journalists like Barry Weiss.

02:03:28.101 --> 02:03:40.747
These are all people that are involved in being highly trained acolytes and visible that are perpetuating this limited spectrum of debate by which we are governed, which is almost exclusively made of myths.

02:03:42.443 --> 02:03:45.608
Even the myths of their riches and their wealth are myths.

02:03:46.829 --> 02:03:48.672
They are being used by the overclass.

02:03:48.692 --> 02:03:49.133
The weird thing is...

02:03:52.220 --> 02:04:12.877
It would be really easy for you to believe that this woman is a acolyte put in front of you to control the questions you asked and the answers you'd arrived at, but it's so much harder for you to believe Robert Malone or Kevin McKernan or Charles Rixey or Kevin McCairn or Merrill Nass or Marilee Holland would also be part of the same system, but they are.

02:04:14.926 --> 02:04:18.308
There are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.

02:04:18.648 --> 02:04:20.630
The first is to get testing out there.

02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:26.834
I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.

02:04:26.854 --> 02:04:28.475
It just means that we aren't looking for it.

02:04:28.815 --> 02:04:31.537
We should be having... So you know this woman's full of it.

02:04:32.237 --> 02:04:38.962
You know it in 2024 if you see her on the news that some people think that she's a genius from all the way back when, right?

02:04:39.773 --> 02:04:45.055
but it's easy for you to see that this person must be nonsense when she's talking about the bird flu.

02:04:45.498 --> 02:04:55.222
rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs.

02:04:55.542 --> 02:05:08.247
Now the thing you have to remember, of course, is that she made her CNN and American debut as the public health something, something for Boston and was actually on the news during the Boston bombing.

02:05:08.327 --> 02:05:10.968
So again, the term is put in place.

02:05:11.528 --> 02:05:20.794
They put these people in place so that they would be with a track record that made their artificial promotion during the pandemic seem normal.

02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:29.220
You know, like just what the algorithm does because, you know, she used to be the health commissioner for Boston and stuff.

02:05:30.472 --> 02:05:32.113
to tell us what's bird flu or not.

02:05:32.533 --> 02:05:38.617
And the second very important thing is, this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine.

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:42.400
There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1.

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:48.744
The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost five million doses of the vaccine.

02:05:49.144 --> 02:05:52.627
However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.

02:05:52.967 --> 02:05:54.028
There's research done on it.

02:05:54.108 --> 02:06:00.292
They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.

02:06:00.892 --> 02:06:06.036
And so the narrative is being repeated again, and that's not very surprising with her, right?

02:06:06.596 --> 02:06:11.339
But what about somebody that I considered a hero for a long time?

02:06:11.379 --> 02:06:13.861
What about somebody like that?

02:06:16.634 --> 02:06:20.995
in 2025, heavily going at us with gonna kill you, blah, blah.

02:06:21.055 --> 02:06:24.876
And you just said, you're not seeing any difference in the pasteurized milk.

02:06:25.016 --> 02:06:29.257
Pasteurization is not designed to get rid of viruses.

02:06:29.678 --> 02:06:32.978
It is just not able to get rid of viruses.

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:36.339
So viruses will persist in pasteurized milk.

02:06:36.379 --> 02:06:39.340
The only reason we pasteurize milk is so it doesn't spoil quickly.

02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:42.641
So we can we can have it last for a longer period of time.

02:06:43.181 --> 02:06:51.427
So, you know, the safety benefits of pasteurization against avian influenza really, really don't exist.

02:06:57.728 --> 02:07:07.115
The weird part of that for me is that that suggests to me that actually he doesn't know much about the virology cartoons that they've shoved down our throat.

02:07:08.076 --> 02:07:13.039
Because I would like to just posit one thing for Brian Hooker that he might not understand.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:20.885
Coronaviruses are positive strand RNAs, which means they can be translated directly by our cells and don't need to carry their own enzyme.

02:07:21.465 --> 02:07:22.006
However,

02:07:23.342 --> 02:07:26.663
flu viruses are negative strand RNA viruses.

02:07:26.744 --> 02:07:41.450
And that means that any replication competent viral particle needs to have inside of it an enzyme to translate the RNA from positive strand to negative strand so that it can be translated into proteins.

02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:48.213
That enzyme would be denatured by pasteurization.

02:07:49.744 --> 02:07:53.847
And it is a vulnerability that in the cartoon of coronavirus isn't there.

02:07:55.968 --> 02:08:11.138
And so it's a weird little detail that Brian Hooker doesn't seem to be aware of or doesn't seem to think is necessary to point out that flu viruses in their cartoons have a different vulnerability because they're negative-stranded viruses and they need to carry their own enzymes.

02:08:11.178 --> 02:08:14.040
And enzymes can be damaged by heat and pressure.

02:08:17.142 --> 02:08:17.262
Hmm.

02:08:18.177 --> 02:08:22.918
Interesting that this person is so sure that there are viruses in milk.

02:08:27.899 --> 02:08:29.859
The other woman was in vaxxed, of course.

02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:38.941
It doesn't make me feel good to have to point these things out.

02:08:41.521 --> 02:08:46.242
But I have to evaluate his statements in the context of

02:08:47.429 --> 02:08:59.335
my own experience, which is that I did five streams with Cottrell and McCairn, two associates of George Webb, in the first few weeks of March and April.

02:09:01.996 --> 02:09:06.598
And I'm pretty sure those people were meddling with me and have been meddling with me since.

02:09:06.958 --> 02:09:07.819
That's five years.

02:09:08.663 --> 02:09:20.707
that includes Kevin McCairn, who had a long collaboration with Charles Rixey, who the health and human, or the, the, the, I, I, I told you already about who's lying about him.

02:09:22.207 --> 02:09:25.388
In July of 2020, I know because YouTube has the video up.

02:09:26.537 --> 02:09:27.537
what I was saying in 2020.

02:09:27.878 --> 02:09:48.006
I know in 2020 in December what I was saying because I have the streams and I know that's when I started writing my review which would be published in May that I now call my Scooby-Doo review but at the time it was like the best write-up of the lab leak, transfection, viral evolution story that there was on the internet.

02:09:51.055 --> 02:10:06.242
And that was when I met Brett Weinstein for a whole year, tutored him on Signal with a bunch of other clowns that I know are meddlers, including Chris Martinson, and Alexandros Baranos, and Marinos, and Matthew Crawford, and Jumi Kim, and his wife, Heather Hain.

02:10:06.582 --> 02:10:07.442
They were all in there.

02:10:07.482 --> 02:10:09.223
They all know everything that I typed.

02:10:11.513 --> 02:10:27.040
And that was before I got hired in the blue square by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., before I was on the Defender podcast with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, and Tess Laurie and told them my theory and still was pretty dead on balls accurate for it in 2022.

02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:33.443
And then I was fired in January of 2024 by, by this guy right here, right?

02:10:34.523 --> 02:10:34.883
By,

02:10:40.956 --> 02:10:51.545
by Brian Hooker in 2024 for six minutes of my podcast talking about Robert Malone and why is he slagging off CHD.

02:10:53.606 --> 02:10:55.228
Brian Hooker knows that's the truth.

02:10:56.248 --> 02:11:10.360
Brian Hooker also knows that I explained to him that RNA cannot pandemic and yet he is going on a podcast with Polly and telling people that pasteurization won't get rid of viruses in general.

02:11:12.711 --> 02:11:15.154
It's the precision of a high school teacher at best.

02:11:16.436 --> 02:11:22.543
Certainly not the precision of somebody who claims to have had me as a colleague, a subordinate colleague.

02:11:22.843 --> 02:11:27.829
I was a staff scientist under his direction for a year.

02:11:32.264 --> 02:11:47.101
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but they're all against us, witting or unwittingly, they have a spectacular commitment to this lie and they're not going back on it because their insurance is too good or their salary is too good and they are just too damn comfortable.

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:56.076
And so I think one of the weak points is this guy.

02:11:56.818 --> 02:12:00.745
This guy right here who lied about the contents of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:12:00.725 --> 02:12:06.296
's book, lied about Charles Rixey's role in it, who lied about people that came to my house.

02:12:11.397 --> 02:12:12.338
That's the admission.

02:12:13.239 --> 02:12:19.444
Just like what Pierre Cory was doing in 2020 in his admission, because what he did precedes all of this.

02:12:19.964 --> 02:12:32.755
He went to New York, he claimed that pulse ox was really low and that they were giving supplementary oxygen, just like Kyle Seidel did, who was promoted by Kevin McCairn as being the guy with the solution, you know, 60 liters a minute, it's great.

02:12:36.089 --> 02:12:41.752
And he also provided the medical affidavit that said that George Floyd suffocated.

02:12:41.812 --> 02:12:55.119
Now, I need to take a little break for my throat, but I think it's really important to see that even on the other side, there are people who look over to our side and see the preposterous nature of some of the characters that I've been involved with.

02:12:56.257 --> 02:13:15.673
And so reminder that Pierre Corey and Brett Weinstein were on Joe Rogan in the sixth month, in June of 2021, after Robert Malone was on The Dark Horse, after Robert Malone was on Joe Rogan, then Corey and Weinstein went on together on Joe Rogan.

02:13:17.495 --> 02:13:22.299
Now, what you might not remember is that there was actually an emergency podcast in June of 2020

02:13:24.684 --> 02:13:29.327
which was also a Joe Rogan podcast, but that was just Brett by himself.

02:13:31.769 --> 02:13:35.612
And in that podcast, he makes some crazy statements.

02:13:35.872 --> 02:13:42.157
And this random YouTube guy, who's actually on the other side, sees Brett for the fool that he is.

02:13:42.217 --> 02:13:52.485
And what I need you to see is that Brett and his schtick actually make it possible for the opposition production videos to be equally effective.

02:13:53.953 --> 02:14:02.235
That's why there are people like Sam Seder who use Tim Poole's citing of Bret Weinstein and Joe Rogan as obviously they're dumb.

02:14:03.376 --> 02:14:04.176
It's easy.

02:14:04.376 --> 02:14:06.136
It's exactly how it's supposed to be.

02:14:06.276 --> 02:14:18.360
As enticing as Joe Rogan's podcast is, it's as easy to take clips from it and make him look like a fool, and therefore it's not very dangerous to challenging the limited spectrum of debate that's being

02:14:19.252 --> 02:14:27.175
curated by all the people you think are trying to argue their way out of it on Joe Rogan.

02:14:28.696 --> 02:14:45.343
And so listen to this guy's name is Chill Goblin, C-H-I-L-L Goblin on YouTube and he's got a couple other videos including one about Trump and Epstein and his entire thing is citing Whitney Webb's books which I think

02:14:47.296 --> 02:14:52.660
Mark would find just so entertaining because he is a very entertaining presenter with very high production levels.

02:14:53.140 --> 02:15:01.425
So I want to take a little break from my voice and let this guy explain to you how ridiculous Brett Weinstein is because I don't need to do it.

02:15:03.106 --> 02:15:12.292
Now remember Brett Weinstein was also part of the team worst case scenario that presented in front of the Senate and that was the one that Kevin McKernan was at.

02:15:12.372 --> 02:15:13.233
That's him right here.

02:15:13.253 --> 02:15:14.554
I'm sorry I'm such a bad weatherman.

02:15:15.619 --> 02:15:28.345
And Brett Weinstein actually flew all around the world to go to Romania to be on stage with all of these people that actually included Nick Hudson, who only revealed himself more recently as a meddler.

02:15:28.365 --> 02:15:35.229
But look, also Harvey Reich, the guy that Kevin McKernan says, you know, is a real smart guy on Danny Jones.

02:15:35.289 --> 02:15:41.512
And Harvey Reich was also there in front of the Senate with McKernan, but Harvey Reich was also in Romania.

02:15:43.672 --> 02:15:46.733
with Stephen Hadfill in Romania.

02:15:48.033 --> 02:15:59.135
And so Brett Weinstein was over in Romania, and he also didn't notice that Denny Rancourt said there was no epidemiological evidence of spread in 2020, that it never spread across borders like you'd expect it to.

02:15:59.515 --> 02:16:06.216
He just didn't seem to catch that part of this presentation, just like the rest of Team Moore's case scenario didn't seem to catch it.

02:16:06.997 --> 02:16:09.117
And Denny Rancourt doesn't seem to give a darn.

02:16:11.567 --> 02:16:17.009
And so just to recall, I got into a signal chat with Brett Weinstein in August of 2021.

02:16:19.351 --> 02:16:23.352
And I posted this the other day, just so you could see it.

02:16:23.873 --> 02:16:32.096
And all of these people that are listed here could confirm everything that I've claimed over the last three and a half years and confirm that I was indeed right.

02:16:32.556 --> 02:16:39.900
And that these people obviously knew that I was right or could tell you that I was right now because they were in that signal chat, but they're not.

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.286
Jumi Kim is going on the Brett Weinstein podcast and claiming that she just, you know, sat in her house and learned it on her own.

02:16:46.787 --> 02:16:58.540
Chris Martinson has got his own thing going and you can hear Paul Cuttrell and Kevin McCarron promoting Chris Martinson in 2020 in some of the videos that Mark's archiving.

02:17:04.218 --> 02:17:10.862
So here's Bret Weinstein in August of 21, saying that he's seen JC on a bike and provided a lot of clarity for him.

02:17:11.482 --> 02:17:14.925
And he also read the May piece that I'm now calling my Scooby-Doo.

02:17:15.305 --> 02:17:20.328
And so he's familiar with the word transfection, why it needs to be called transfection.

02:17:20.368 --> 02:17:23.910
And yet I'm going to spend the next year trying to convince him to say it.

02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:26.752
And he won't, except for once when his wife kind of says it wrong.

02:17:27.802 --> 02:17:32.605
So this is again, the guy that I wanna take a break with.

02:17:32.665 --> 02:17:33.766
This is Chill Goblin.

02:17:34.186 --> 02:17:40.750
And he's gonna pick up Brett Weinstein right here where he goes on the Joe Rogan podcast in June of 2020.

02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:47.995
I might need to escape and start it again.

02:17:48.015 --> 02:17:49.996
Let me see.

02:17:51.537 --> 02:17:53.298
Oh no, please don't do that.

02:18:01.468 --> 02:18:03.610
I might not have clipped it right or something.

02:18:03.690 --> 02:18:05.111
Okay, I'm gonna just escape to make sure.

02:18:05.151 --> 02:18:06.292
I might have to click on it.

02:18:07.673 --> 02:18:08.794
Maybe I just set it up wrong.

02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:24.208
I don't believe that being a international symbol of reactionary politics was ever what Brett had dreamed for himself.

02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:27.320
Brett doesn't want to be Charlie Kirk, dammit.

02:18:27.741 --> 02:18:29.463
He wants to be Charlie Darwin.

02:18:29.984 --> 02:18:41.381
If only there were some massive global event, some worldwide catastrophe that Brett could use to make himself known for his scientific genius.

02:18:42.401 --> 02:18:44.142
Brett and the big spike.

02:18:44.782 --> 02:18:49.403
When coronavirus dropped, it presented a huge opportunity for Brett Weinstein.

02:18:49.463 --> 02:18:59.406
All of a sudden, people were very interested in what scientists had to say, especially if what they had to say went against the mainstream liberal media.

02:19:00.006 --> 02:19:04.972
Brett, as we've seen, was already working this type of audience, so it was a natural transition for him.

02:19:05.433 --> 02:19:10.859
By June of 2020, Brett had so many opinions about coronavirus and other issues of the day.

02:19:11.179 --> 02:19:18.989
He'd already spent months gargling them on the Dark Horse podcast, but now it was time to spit them into the Joe Rogan sink.

02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:24.470
I'll say right off the top here, not all of Brett's opinions on coronavirus were wrong.

02:19:25.010 --> 02:19:27.031
On occasion, he was very correct.

02:19:27.251 --> 02:19:36.793
For example, back when the CDC was advising people not to wear masks, Brett was insisting on his show that masks were good, wearing a bandana around his neck at all times.

02:19:38.034 --> 02:19:42.635
So, you know, and I don't know why we are pushing this madness of

02:19:43.849 --> 02:20:10.156
masks that scream medical yeah you've got a bandana i do yeah but you know the fact is the bandana all right maybe i look like a goofball but the fact is it's more fashionable in my opinion than a medical mask oh you're being fashionable that's cute oh it's very cool brett you look like the only guy at black block carrying around a copy of the bell curve you look like a west world robot that gives you a side quest denying medical aid to trans people well done buddy

02:20:10.976 --> 02:20:18.858
I mean, actually, like I bought I bought this to make fun of you, but I actually really like I really like it.

02:20:19.038 --> 02:20:21.139
I'm going to wear this unironically.

02:20:21.939 --> 02:20:23.759
I just like the way it makes me feel.

02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:29.020
Of course, not all of Brett's code era opinions were strictly public health related.

02:20:29.561 --> 02:20:39.103
The second the podcast starts, Joe Rogan takes the opportunity to congratulate Brett on his Nostradamus level ability to predict that BLM would be a thing.

02:20:40.196 --> 02:20:55.859
Remember, this is crucial to see what it is because in 2020 in June, Rogan is going to remind his audience that in 2020 and 2017 that Brett was the guy who got kicked out of a university for saying stuff.

02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:00.140
He got to speak in front of the Senate for saying stuff.

02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:02.541
He lost his job for saying stuff.

02:21:04.588 --> 02:21:13.635
And so this is pure, unadulterated, like liquid evidence that this is the narrative they want you to believe.

02:21:13.695 --> 02:21:16.036
This is the narrative they want us to hand to our kids.

02:21:16.477 --> 02:21:25.183
That Brett Weinstein is a guy who went into academia and suffered for being bright, suffered for being smart, suffered because of woke.

02:21:29.046 --> 02:21:31.648
And he sees it, of course, this guy sees it, which is brilliant.

02:21:33.638 --> 02:21:41.843
If anybody sounded the alarm that all this madness was gonna come to fruition in the real world, it's you, sir.

02:21:42.404 --> 02:21:43.384
You were the guy.

02:21:43.905 --> 02:21:47.207
What's happening at Evergreen, and now it spills out into the real world.

02:21:47.507 --> 02:21:48.908
Just like I said it was gonna.

02:21:49.128 --> 02:21:49.528
You did.

02:21:49.549 --> 02:21:50.069
I did.

02:21:50.409 --> 02:21:50.709
You did.

02:21:50.729 --> 02:21:54.592
I said it in several different places, and pretty clearly, you know.

02:21:55.032 --> 02:22:09.679
According to Brett what happens to him at evergreen was just a microcosm of where the move now I can't stress enough that actually the first half of this video is talking about that at evergreen and details Very clearly what didn't and didn't happen.

02:22:09.719 --> 02:22:18.503
It's a magnificent dissection of it So I can't recommend it enough the guy's name's chill goblin But remember I'm not saying he's a good guy

02:22:20.245 --> 02:22:23.207
I'm saying that he's a guy who's just trying to do stuff.

02:22:23.287 --> 02:22:24.848
Maybe he's been told what to do.

02:22:24.928 --> 02:22:36.195
Maybe he's got a staff or he's just a really interesting editor, but his Epstein video is exclusively citing the books of Whitney Webb and even puts them in the corner a couple of times.

02:22:36.715 --> 02:22:38.957
So maybe they found him and then he did that one.

02:22:39.037 --> 02:22:39.317
I don't know.

02:22:39.357 --> 02:22:41.858
He's not a very prolific content maker.

02:22:42.339 --> 02:22:44.300
So I'm not saying yes or no, he's right.

02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:46.942
What I want you to see is even if he's just a,

02:22:47.942 --> 02:23:06.868
innocent content creator so much of what he sees is dead-on balls accurate for what we're fighting because here he is again seeing that Brett wasn't always wrong he had the bandana and goggles thing right movement for black lives would eventually go and

02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:12.562
I really don't know if you want to put yourself at that point in the metaphor, Brett.

02:23:13.422 --> 02:23:26.788
I think that this is actually the people who are catching up to the fact that evergreen has now spilled over into the world have not caught up to the fact that this is unstoppable at this point.

02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:30.190
And that means that the next set of predictions are

02:23:30.675 --> 02:23:33.636
So, so much of what Brett is, it's already unstoppable.

02:23:33.676 --> 02:23:34.697
It's already inevitable.

02:23:34.717 --> 02:23:38.758
This could be the end of the West, as he said on Highwire in 2024.

02:23:40.879 --> 02:23:43.160
Are far more dire.

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:48.842
They talk about how the BLM movement has become anarchist, which I don't think is really true.

02:23:49.042 --> 02:23:51.703
And then Brett drops a bomb.

02:23:53.058 --> 02:23:54.459
You might be able to predict what it is.

02:23:55.159 --> 02:24:02.443
I'm going to put a content warning here for discussion of George Floyd's murder and Brett's very bad take on it.

02:24:02.543 --> 02:24:07.185
So skip to this time code if you'd like to avoid that discussion.

02:24:09.467 --> 02:24:17.230
And so it's very crucial for your participation in this study that you realize that Corey submitted his

02:24:18.715 --> 02:24:27.547
affidavit that Floyd suffocated to a Minnesota court, as far as I understand, where he is not certified as a doctor in June of 2020.

02:24:28.748 --> 02:24:37.019
And now in June of 2020, on the Joe Rogan podcast, Brett Weinstein and Joe Rogan are going to discuss Floyd.

02:24:39.850 --> 02:24:40.851
All right, here's Brett's thing.

02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:44.594
He doesn't believe that George Floyd was murdered necessarily.

02:24:44.634 --> 02:24:49.017
The furthest he's willing to go is to say that it was a huge miscarriage of justice.

02:24:49.457 --> 02:24:54.722
He also doesn't believe that Derek Chauvin would be convicted by an honest court of law.

02:24:55.490 --> 02:25:01.531
We don't know, in the public, based on what we have seen, we don't know this to have been murder.

02:25:01.632 --> 02:25:10.834
Because if this was Derek Chauvin being a dick, that is for a court to decide whether or not it is murder.

02:25:10.874 --> 02:25:16.955
In other words, if he was doing the policy as the policy is laid out based on the criteria that would trigger the policy.

02:25:16.975 --> 02:25:18.035
Have you read any of this?

02:25:18.616 --> 02:25:19.576
The real point here

02:25:20.336 --> 02:25:22.097
is not that he is innocent.

02:25:22.237 --> 02:25:23.597
I don't believe him to be innocent.

02:25:23.777 --> 02:25:31.579
My real point is that we are all acting as if we have seen with our own eyes something that is unambiguously murder.

02:25:32.379 --> 02:25:34.660
I believe we saw something that may... No, we're not.

02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:36.841
No, we're really not.

02:25:37.021 --> 02:25:39.261
Only you are telling us that that's what's happening.

02:25:39.281 --> 02:25:40.281
You see the enchantment?

02:25:40.582 --> 02:25:42.022
It's neuro-linguistic programming.

02:25:42.452 --> 02:25:49.499
well have been murder and may well not have been murder and that the way that we determine whether it is murder is in a courtroom with due process.

02:25:49.679 --> 02:26:01.290
Now Joe Rogan is wrong about a ton of stuff from trans people to Tulsi Gabbard and he also has a tendency to just go along with whatever his guest at the moment is saying and not challenge anyone but

02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:06.973
To give Joe some credit, he actually does challenge Brett directly on his George Floyd opinions.

02:26:07.494 --> 02:26:09.715
And I think he does a pretty good job of it.

02:26:10.215 --> 02:26:12.716
If I am, I'm an expert on choking people.

02:26:13.457 --> 02:26:18.279
You know, I understand what happens to the brain when you cut off the blood supply.

02:26:18.739 --> 02:26:19.620
I've had it done to me.

02:26:20.791 --> 02:26:22.631
I know I could kill a man that way.

02:26:22.832 --> 02:26:23.492
I know I could.

02:26:24.172 --> 02:26:30.033
If I decided to lean on someone's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds with all my weight, that's a dead person.

02:26:30.794 --> 02:26:35.075
If your neck... So is that what happened or is that what Joe wants you to believe happened?

02:26:35.095 --> 02:26:37.235
That's what Joe's handlers want him to say.

02:26:37.295 --> 02:26:44.357
I mean, did he really have his neck on the concrete and then the other knee here with all weight on it?

02:26:44.417 --> 02:26:44.857
I don't know.

02:26:44.877 --> 02:26:48.218
I'm not sure we have a video that shows that.

02:26:49.281 --> 02:26:57.658
I'm not sure if you could scream out for two minutes and say words if somebody was really doing what Joe is describing here.

02:26:58.906 --> 02:27:04.872
One side of your neck is on the concrete, and the other side is 200 pounds of my body, all focused on my knee.

02:27:05.192 --> 02:27:07.534
And I'm balancing my weight on your neck.

02:27:07.955 --> 02:27:08.836
You're a dead man.

02:27:09.776 --> 02:27:11.478
But that's what we saw, right?

02:27:11.818 --> 02:27:14.141
I know what you're saying, that maybe he also had a heart attack.

02:27:14.501 --> 02:27:18.084
But the idea that those two are not related seems to me to be... Is that what he's saying?

02:27:18.124 --> 02:27:19.486
That maybe he also had a heart attack?

02:27:19.526 --> 02:27:20.727
I didn't hear Brett say that.

02:27:23.399 --> 02:27:24.840
outside of the realm of possibility.

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.882
Now Joe Rogan is more of an expert in the... Of course Floyd was fake.

02:27:32.403 --> 02:27:43.767
But what they're doing here is creating a consensus about the fact that he's not fake and the important thing to ask is whether or not he was killed or whether he just died from being mishandled or an overdose.

02:27:43.987 --> 02:27:52.971
And Corey provided an affidavit supporting the idea of suffocation just like Rogan did on his podcast just now.

02:27:54.662 --> 02:27:55.886
Yes, we were played.

02:27:55.926 --> 02:27:57.371
We were played by them.

02:27:57.391 --> 02:27:58.334
All of it.

02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:04.603
the study of choking people than Brett is in any field, but Brett still doesn't buy it.

02:28:04.984 --> 02:28:09.147
And he soon moves the conversation on to discussion of the lab leak theory.

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:25.258
Now keep in mind, this was back in June, 2020, and unless you're Donald Trump, it was very hard to discuss the possibility that COVID leaked from a Chinese lab because it was so easily turned into animosity against Asian people and real world violence against them.

02:28:25.638 --> 02:28:28.941
But Brett Weinstein was one of those brave people

02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:31.243
who was willing to not care about that.

02:28:32.084 --> 02:28:38.853
And the story that is looking more and more likely, what I would call the lab leak hypothesis, is looking ever stronger.

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:51.043
This is another one of Brett's predictions that people love to point to to showcase his credibility alongside him being correct about masks and him apparently predicting the BLM movements.

02:28:52.204 --> 02:29:02.149
And with this one it sort of makes sense because over time the lab leak hypothesis... Do you see that the lab leak hypothesis makes him right about masks?

02:29:03.348 --> 02:29:09.472
Masks don't make any sense if it's just your average virus, but if it was a lab leak virus, then masks made sense.

02:29:09.912 --> 02:29:16.996
And that's what we were arguing about with Kevin McCarran and Charles Rixey and Cottrell and Drastic and all this bullshit.

02:29:18.677 --> 02:29:19.778
That's how they got us.

02:29:22.019 --> 02:29:28.523
And then for years and years, you know, it depended on whether you believed it was a lab leak, but if you thought it was a lab leak, you might be avoiding getting it.

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:33.251
you might be hoping that it will evolve into a less nasty one.

02:29:34.552 --> 02:29:39.738
You might want to avoid the flying aids by not getting it now, and that's what a lot of these people were arguing.

02:29:40.158 --> 02:29:48.427
And so it's interesting that this guy, who's clearly on the left, believes that the lab leak idea makes him more right about the

02:29:49.671 --> 02:29:52.653
about the masks in some ways if he were to be right about it.

02:29:53.053 --> 02:29:55.955
This has become more accepted.

02:29:56.055 --> 02:29:56.855
I'm not a scientist.

02:29:56.996 --> 02:29:57.716
Did I mention that already?

02:29:58.176 --> 02:30:10.604
But from what I understand, it's pretty much agreed that while a natural spillover is much more likely, almost any scientist would agree that a lab leak is at least possible.

02:30:11.284 --> 02:30:15.346
And I also think if you want to speculate about the lab leak hypothesis, that is totally okay.

02:30:15.746 --> 02:30:19.687
But you need to be careful not to contribute to any anti-Asian racism.

02:30:19.747 --> 02:30:21.188
That's pretty amazing, right?

02:30:21.228 --> 02:30:22.508
He's totally down with that.

02:30:22.548 --> 02:30:25.190
He's totally down with the lab leak because it's fine.

02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:29.671
And that's exactly how the military operation worked.

02:30:29.731 --> 02:30:34.213
It was a lab leak and it was a mystery that we had to solve, a cover-up we had to break.

02:30:34.673 --> 02:30:35.954
And he's fine with that now.

02:30:36.874 --> 02:30:39.015
Just wish people would have been more precise about it.

02:30:40.339 --> 02:30:50.948
Now what's interesting is in this video, he also analyzes his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast sometime later, that's actually an emergency podcast.

02:30:52.049 --> 02:30:55.512
And so in case you're not aware of that, there was an emergency podcast.

02:30:57.514 --> 02:31:00.437
Or I don't believe

02:31:02.904 --> 02:31:04.705
as is the other, we're not certain.

02:31:04.886 --> 02:31:05.746
Well, what's gonna come back?

02:31:05.846 --> 02:31:17.398
And so there was a Weinstein emergency podcast, a Joe Rogan podcast, one year later in May of 2021 that preceded his own Dark Horse podcast with Kirsch and Malone.

02:31:17.418 --> 02:31:19.300
He went on Rogan, and this is what he did.

02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:27.565
at you is that you made a flowchart and you said, you know, here and also on Bill Maher, something like, I think there's a greater than 95% chance.

02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:29.907
Now, remember, they got I should have let that play.

02:31:29.947 --> 02:31:32.829
They got to go on Bill Maher in November of 2020.

02:31:33.609 --> 02:31:35.610
And say lab leak out loud together.

02:31:36.311 --> 02:31:39.833
They went on Bill Maher on HBO, and said lab leak.

02:31:40.213 --> 02:31:41.794
And so that's what she's talking about now.

02:31:41.834 --> 02:31:45.197
And apparently he's getting in trouble for having said that it's like 90% certain.

02:31:45.217 --> 02:31:45.337
Well,

02:31:47.611 --> 02:31:50.692
And that is read, um, apparently as certainty.

02:31:51.012 --> 02:31:51.412
Oh, great.

02:31:51.432 --> 02:31:53.213
Some real plausible deniability there.

02:31:53.553 --> 02:31:55.734
They then shifted into their next topic of conversation.

02:31:56.194 --> 02:32:06.258
I've, wait, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say the I word on YouTube without having my video instantly demonetized and maybe even taken down.

02:32:06.798 --> 02:32:13.967
and I love money, so I'm going to err on the side of caution here and just say horse paste instead.

02:32:14.307 --> 02:32:22.678
Now, I already know this might upset some of the diehard horse pasters out there who find that phrase insulting and inaccurate.

02:32:22.998 --> 02:32:25.499
And to them, I would say, yes, you get it.

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:32.123
I am bullying you in a mean and unfair way because I think you're promoting a mistake that is getting people killed.

02:32:32.603 --> 02:32:35.665
It sounds like an insult because it's an insult.

02:32:36.205 --> 02:32:39.967
Glad we could clear that up, and I sincerely hope your feelings are heard.

02:32:40.528 --> 02:32:45.190
Now, to be fair to Horse Paste, it's true that it does come in a human version.

02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:47.351
It saved millions of lives.

02:32:47.451 --> 02:32:50.093
I love those little pills with the dark horse on them.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:53.402
lives, and it's won the Nobel Prize.

02:32:53.922 --> 02:32:59.805
And it's done all of this by being a very effective and safe anti-parasitic.

02:33:00.585 --> 02:33:07.109
It kills all the parasites in a horse's or human's body and poops them out the butthole.

02:33:07.609 --> 02:33:16.074
Which is great if you happen to have malaria or river blindness, which are both... Malaria is a funny one to mention because I don't think they'd use it for malaria, but anyway.

02:33:16.926 --> 02:33:34.243
caused by parasites now if you're a scientist you might already the reason why that's funny is because hydroxychloroquine was for malaria right so here you can again probably start to see why chill goblin might not be on our team either right now you're seeing it that's the way

02:33:35.273 --> 02:33:38.634
know this, but COVID is actually not a parasite.

02:33:38.694 --> 02:33:44.956
It's a virus, and horse paste seems to do absolutely nothing to prevent you from catching COVID.

02:33:45.696 --> 02:34:01.401
On the other hand, horse paste is generally a safe drug to take, as long as you're taking it in the correct human-sized dose, and you aren't specifically taking horse paste instead of something that actually works and is available to you, like the vaccine.

02:34:02.022 --> 02:34:07.554
Oh, so if you took ivermectin instead of antibiotics to fight a pneumonia, you could die?

02:34:07.574 --> 02:34:08.435
Oh, wow!

02:34:08.455 --> 02:34:09.498
Crazy.

02:34:13.112 --> 02:34:22.694
So it would be wildly irresponsible for you to use your platform to say anything other than that, which I'm sure Brett, no, no, Brett.

02:34:23.774 --> 02:34:25.975
Oh, you already know what's about to happen here.

02:34:26.395 --> 02:34:39.758
Brett Weinstein saw a couple of very small, very early, and very bad studies that showed some correlation between horse paste and not getting COVID, and he immediately made this his passion project.

02:34:40.118 --> 02:34:40.378
Brett.

02:34:41.653 --> 02:34:42.515
You're a scientist.

02:34:42.695 --> 02:34:46.743
How are you hopping on such a dubious cure so early?

02:34:46.783 --> 02:34:51.812
You're like my friend back in 1999 who tried to convince me that Lou Bega was going to be the next Beatles.

02:34:52.352 --> 02:34:54.933
Yeah, I know Mambo No.

02:34:54.953 --> 02:35:02.415
5 parenthesis a little bit of is an absolutely fresh track, but maybe let's wait and see if these results can be repeated.

02:35:02.896 --> 02:35:06.297
So on this podcast episode, Brett brings up horse paste.

02:35:06.357 --> 02:35:12.999
And I think it's actually very funny considering how important this episode would be to Brett's trajectory.

02:35:13.499 --> 02:35:25.647
that it seems like he came in with a very concrete plan to talk about horse paste, but he did not let his wife Heather in on it at all to the point where she actually wanted to cut the segment for time.

02:35:25.707 --> 02:35:27.068
Like she didn't think it was that important.

02:35:27.388 --> 02:35:29.370
And then Brett's just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:35:29.390 --> 02:35:31.171
This is important to me.

02:35:31.291 --> 02:35:31.651
Okay.

02:35:31.671 --> 02:35:33.532
We got to talk about horse paste.

02:35:33.613 --> 02:35:35.394
And she's just like, all right, I guess.

02:35:35.982 --> 02:35:39.346
Maybe we should drop some of what we're going to talk about with regard to horse paste.

02:35:40.106 --> 02:35:43.570
I have a lot prepared here and I just don't think we really have time to get through it all.

02:35:43.770 --> 02:35:47.434
Well, so let's just let's just start and see what we can do.

02:35:47.454 --> 02:35:52.038
We have to talk about the predicament that we are in on YouTube with respect to paste for a horse.

02:35:53.098 --> 02:35:56.679
So, all right, here's the classic Weinstein maneuver.

02:35:56.719 --> 02:36:06.363
And I've seen him do this so many times on so many different podcasts that at this point, it's just like watching a finely tuned ballet.

02:36:06.483 --> 02:36:09.004
So he starts out with the disclaimer.

02:36:09.804 --> 02:36:13.767
We are scientists who are about to talk about scientific evidence.

02:36:14.168 --> 02:36:22.594
We are not going to make any recommendations as to what you should do, and we are not going to say anything conclusive about what the data say because the data are not themselves conclusive.

02:36:22.874 --> 02:36:23.195
Right?

02:36:23.435 --> 02:36:26.798
Then he gives you the reasons why you actually should listen to them.

02:36:27.538 --> 02:36:30.159
However, it doesn't mean the data don't imply things.

02:36:30.499 --> 02:36:53.145
And, you know, I think YouTube ought to think very carefully about whether it wants to confront two people who have the proper credentials, and in this case, have just been through a circumstance where a hypothesis that they were suggesting needed to be investigated is now understood to be necessary to be investigated, you know, in science, etc.

02:36:53.245 --> 02:36:54.946
So that's the context.

02:36:55.703 --> 02:37:02.686
So he's talking about the lab leak there, and this is at least two months before I would join him in a signal chat in August.

02:37:03.946 --> 02:37:12.929
It's kind of generous to say that they were proven right about the lab leak when nothing has been proven about the lab leak, but okay, we'll go with it.

02:37:13.629 --> 02:37:22.913
Then Brett brings up the studies about horse paste, which somehow he makes the fact that they are very small in scale sound like a positive.

02:37:23.573 --> 02:37:35.629
Now the one thing I would like to point out here about the signal chat is in that signal chat was Alexandros Marinos and he spent the time that I followed him in 2021 doing two things.

02:37:35.669 --> 02:37:41.477
He was either blowing sunshine in the direction of Elon Musk before he had bought Twitter

02:37:42.825 --> 02:37:52.469
Or he was talking about Ivermectin and he claimed it was because he was injured by the shot and he thought Ivermectin would help his long COVID or his vaccine injury or some bullshit like that.

02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:58.512
And he tweeted over and over and over and over and over and over and over again about Ivermectin.

02:37:59.431 --> 02:37:59.911
That's it.

02:38:00.531 --> 02:38:01.691
Elon Musk is awesome.

02:38:01.791 --> 02:38:02.892
Elon Musk is smart.

02:38:03.072 --> 02:38:04.252
Elon Musk is a hero.

02:38:04.812 --> 02:38:07.153
Ivermectin, Ivermectin, Ivermectin, Ivermectin.

02:38:07.173 --> 02:38:08.733
That's Alexandros Marinos.

02:38:09.233 --> 02:38:17.795
And until I actually tweeted, why don't you move on from Ivermectin and tell people to stop transfecting themselves, he blocked me.

02:38:21.856 --> 02:38:26.016
Large studies are great because they reveal very small effects.

02:38:26.637 --> 02:38:28.237
When you have a very large effect,

02:38:28.843 --> 02:38:32.304
you do not require a very large study to see it.

02:38:32.444 --> 02:38:41.608
The compilation of all of these things is very strongly suggestive that I- Stallion s-sauce does work.

02:38:42.168 --> 02:38:47.030
So, that's not true, and that's an absolutely wild thing to think, especially if you're a scientist.

02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:53.733
Like, I kissed two people, my mom and my dog, and they both really loved it, so

02:38:54.033 --> 02:38:59.514
I should be able to kiss anybody because sample size doesn't matter if the effect is large.

02:39:00.814 --> 02:39:06.536
Anyway, then Brett paints a picture of a global conspiracy to keep Horse Paste down.

02:39:07.436 --> 02:39:16.838
Now remember, it was only hydroxychloroquine that had three precursor plants burned down.

02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:25.522
The plants that make the precursor chemicals for making hydroxychloroquine, three different of those plants burnt down.

02:39:25.842 --> 02:39:35.305
It was hydroxychloroquine that Donald Trump ordered be bought by the government and put in the government stockpile to the tune of 20,000 pills.

02:39:37.465 --> 02:39:38.426
Not ivermectin.

02:39:40.926 --> 02:39:47.308
And hydroxychloroquine is what works on malaria, not ivermectin, which is what the chill goblin said.

02:39:48.831 --> 02:39:54.973
It's a very diabolical web that we are stuck in with lots of fake people, with lots of fake arguments.

02:39:55.073 --> 02:40:06.595
And the limited spectrum of debate is so contorted that you can bounce off of it inside of these people's arguments and not realize that collectively they are trapping you.

02:40:08.296 --> 02:40:14.777
He's working with Brett and the ideas that Brett puts forth in order to make the other side of the cage.

02:40:15.578 --> 02:40:17.158
It's pure harmony here.

02:40:19.285 --> 02:40:24.929
decide they don't like something like Flintstones vitamins, but for the da horse in the family.

02:40:25.169 --> 02:40:31.053
They can establish any standard up to a ridiculous degree that nothing can overcome, right?

02:40:31.333 --> 02:40:37.557
When it comes to the thing that they favor, there's no level of danger that could be sufficient to call it into question.

02:40:37.958 --> 02:40:47.003
And so we don't know what that looks like on the inside, but what you can see is the hallmark of it is a double standard that is glaring if you know how to analyze what's being said.

02:40:47.304 --> 02:40:47.764
Absolutely.

02:40:47.944 --> 02:41:01.456
Then he makes a very bold claim about the shadowy elites trying to prevent you and your loved ones from enjoying the cool, refreshing flavor of horse paste, calling this act... How many people participated in shutting down this discussion and why?

02:41:02.036 --> 02:41:02.216
Right?

02:41:02.236 --> 02:41:06.380
That just... The discussion was shut down about hydroxychloroquine.

02:41:07.461 --> 02:41:13.086
The discussion was shut down about hydroxychloroquine and zinc and zinc ionophores.

02:41:13.806 --> 02:41:14.967
Make no mistake about it.

02:41:15.647 --> 02:41:32.355
The discussion of hydroxychloroquine was actually closed by Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, who released or issued a EUA for the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus in a hospital, which kind of

02:41:33.396 --> 02:41:36.559
prevented its off-label use and dispension.

02:41:37.039 --> 02:41:44.405
They also restricted it from over-the-counter distribution in France, where it was before the pandemic, over-the-counter.

02:41:44.445 --> 02:41:46.446
They did not do that with ivermectin.

02:41:47.727 --> 02:41:49.309
They did it with hydroxychloroquine.

02:41:51.130 --> 02:41:54.513
Zev Zelenko was not selling ivermectin.

02:41:54.533 --> 02:41:57.055
He was selling hydroxychloroquine and zinc.

02:42:02.729 --> 02:42:03.910
It's mind-boggling.

02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:07.373
To me, it really looks like crime of the century stuff.

02:42:07.433 --> 02:42:10.336
Wow, the crime of the century.

02:42:10.396 --> 02:42:12.918
Calling it only 21 years into the century.

02:42:12.978 --> 02:42:17.302
I guess Brett and Heather really don't have much faith in the criminals of the world.

02:42:19.076 --> 02:42:21.678
To criminals who are watching this, I believe in you.

02:42:21.858 --> 02:42:22.659
Shoot for the moon.

02:42:22.939 --> 02:42:24.039
Shoot, shoot the moon.

02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:42.572
The crime of the century is the inversion of our individual sovereignty to the status of experimental animal by the mythology of RNA pandemics, the mythology of vaccines, the mythology of the immune system, the mythology of everything that underlies the public health narrative.

02:42:43.613 --> 02:42:44.854
That's the crime of the century.

02:42:46.581 --> 02:42:47.283
Kill the moon.

02:42:47.904 --> 02:42:49.247
Kidnap the moon, alright?

02:42:49.307 --> 02:42:50.670
That would be the crime of the century.

02:42:50.931 --> 02:42:51.432
Do that.

02:42:51.532 --> 02:42:55.782
Don't... I don't know if that counts as a call to violence, but I'm just... That's a joke.

02:42:56.867 --> 02:43:15.318
And then he, and I shouldn't be surprised by this, but I somehow was, he compares the whole horse pace conspiracy to his time at Evergreen, which, I mean, I think the mice telomere story would have probably been a better fit, but he knows his audience mostly knows about the Evergreen stuff.

02:43:15.398 --> 02:43:17.399
So I get why he didn't go there.

02:43:17.799 --> 02:43:18.519
I sometimes say.

02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:22.843
Certain stories diagnose the system, right?

02:43:22.883 --> 02:43:36.216
You do what happened to us at evergreen diagnosed the system because the mainstream press couldn't figure out what to do with a story in which for blacks who were behaving in a bigoted way towards white that diagnosed the press and

02:43:36.616 --> 02:43:47.204
This story seems to diagnose the tech sector, it diagnoses the press, it diagnoses the scientific establishment, it diagnoses the governmental regulatory apparatus, all of those things.

02:43:47.244 --> 02:43:51.248
And we have to take a good long look at what happened because, oh my god, the cost could hardly be bigger.

02:43:51.268 --> 02:43:54.450
10 out of 10 landing.

02:43:54.470 --> 02:43:57.893
That is a perfectly executed Weinstein maneuver.

02:43:58.353 --> 02:44:03.577
You went disclaimer to outlandish conspiracy theory to making it about yourself.

02:44:03.877 --> 02:44:04.178
Wow.

02:44:04.838 --> 02:44:05.679
Bravo.

02:44:05.759 --> 02:44:07.421
That's, that's got to be it, right?

02:44:07.441 --> 02:44:08.502
There's there can't be any more.

02:44:08.542 --> 02:44:08.922
Can there?

02:44:08.942 --> 02:44:10.163
Can we talk about cicadas?

02:44:10.904 --> 02:44:11.605
Uh, yeah.

02:44:12.025 --> 02:44:12.606
Oh, no, no, no.

02:44:12.686 --> 02:44:13.567
You got something else?

02:44:13.607 --> 02:44:14.968
Yeah, I do have something else.

02:44:15.028 --> 02:44:17.190
And I, you know, I'm so sorry about it.

02:44:17.250 --> 02:44:26.380
But here's the thing, because we have not been vaccinated because we have fears as we have discussed at length on this podcast.

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:28.881
Oh right, I love this part.

02:44:29.002 --> 02:44:37.728
So as far as I can tell, Heather had straight up no idea that Brett was going to spring horse pills on her live on stream.

02:44:38.448 --> 02:44:41.950
And it's honestly really sweet, I think.

02:44:42.151 --> 02:44:48.035
It's so nice to see older couples keeping the magic alive with spontaneous acts of pseudoscience.

02:44:48.995 --> 02:44:50.797
Ah, to be a grifter in love.

02:44:51.318 --> 02:44:59.886
Anyway, on air, Heather doesn't want to take the pills quite yet, but she confirms later that she and all of their children are on the horsey stuff.

02:45:00.226 --> 02:45:04.490
Brett finishes the podcast by saying he's not recommending horse pills.

02:45:04.570 --> 02:45:10.436
He's definitely not recommending the horse pace to anyone, but they are amazing and they solve every problem.

02:45:10.916 --> 02:45:25.963
my sense is that given what i have read i am not recommending bob tailed nag barbiturates to anybody else in fact i'm not even going to recommend it to you but you've seen what i've seen you can make your own decision um but given the apparent effectiveness of

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:27.604
Shadowfax XLax.

02:45:42.261 --> 02:45:43.462
It doesn't have to be taken frequently.

02:45:43.562 --> 02:45:46.564
So that was aired on the Dark Horse podcast on May 14th, 2021.

02:45:46.765 --> 02:45:50.728
And you know, it's a big audience, but it's not the biggest.

02:45:51.148 --> 02:46:00.215
But then things took a ridiculous turn when Brett brought his new conspiracy theory and his new miracle cure to the Joe Rogan podcast.

02:46:00.916 --> 02:46:01.616
Are you surprised?

02:46:01.877 --> 02:46:03.338
Of course, of course he did that.

02:46:03.775 --> 02:46:11.200
Now, the Joe Rogan Experience is already the world's most popular podcast, according to 6 out of 10 of the internet listicles I found.

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:13.481
But this wasn't just any episode.

02:46:13.781 --> 02:46:21.086
This was specifically labeled as the first ever Joe Rogan Emergency Podcast.

02:46:21.286 --> 02:46:22.726
Holy shit, call 911!

02:46:22.827 --> 02:46:26.629
There are innocent people out there who don't know about all the horse meds they could be taking.

02:46:26.969 --> 02:46:31.794
I've never had to do an emergency podcast before, but I feel like we do.

02:46:32.194 --> 02:46:38.360
And Brett, you and I have been in communication about this, and this seemed like something that we have to do quicker than later.

02:46:38.959 --> 02:46:45.465
Now, I'm not going to take you through the whole podcast because it's a lot of the stuff that we've already been through, but I'll show you a little highlight reel.

02:46:45.525 --> 02:46:46.385
You get the gist of it.

02:46:46.486 --> 02:46:48.167
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

02:46:48.768 --> 02:46:54.192
The importance of evolution here is that, A, all of the things that we're talking about with COVID are evolutionary.

02:46:54.412 --> 02:46:56.154
Obviously, the virus is evolved.

02:46:56.254 --> 02:46:59.337
Epidemiology is an evolutionary process.

02:46:59.937 --> 02:47:03.941
This might be one of the most important sentences written this century.

02:47:04.501 --> 02:47:09.706
Evolution is a kind of good generalist toolkit to apply to something like COVID.

02:47:10.967 --> 02:47:22.917
Because that number is so high, what it means is that horsey pasty alone, if properly utilized, is capable of driving this pathogen to extinction.

02:47:23.653 --> 02:47:29.819
Zero COVID is possible in May, 2021 on an emergency podcast.

02:47:30.420 --> 02:47:42.312
And then he will go on to do a dark horse podcast with Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and say that if we could just force everybody to take ivermectin and silicoxib for 60 days, we would reach zero COVID.

02:47:48.154 --> 02:47:53.678
The pharmaceutical industry has engineered mechanisms to get their drugs through this process, right?

02:47:53.698 --> 02:47:54.998
They've corrupted the system.

02:47:55.198 --> 02:48:00.262
And somehow we're stuck in this situation where the evidence that we have effective tools is overwhelming.

02:48:00.942 --> 02:48:02.783
Mr. Han's brand Vicodin.

02:48:03.063 --> 02:48:06.846
Do not excite anybody in the pharmaceutical industry because there's no profit to be made.

02:48:07.326 --> 02:48:11.689
A majority of my family's income comes through our two YouTube channels.

02:48:11.949 --> 02:48:25.912
With the exception of the $500,000 that we were given as a settlement from Evergreen and the fact that my dad is so rich he can hardly breathe because he's been a patent lawyer since he joined the Department of Justice with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his dad.

02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:37.614
His dad was in the Department of Justice with Robert F. Kennedy during the formation of the FDA, and he is one of the most successful arbitrators of biological patent law in America.

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:43.096
So yeah, most of his income, but the vast majority of his inheritance isn't gonna come from that.

02:48:47.057 --> 02:48:49.799
His dad bought him a house in Michigan when he went to college.

02:48:49.839 --> 02:48:52.159
I mean, come on guys, this is not us.

02:48:52.299 --> 02:48:53.320
These are not us.

02:48:54.619 --> 02:48:55.661
Did you watch this episode?

02:48:55.701 --> 02:48:57.163
Because someone you know did.

02:48:57.584 --> 02:49:00.168
This was a Joe Rogan EMERGENCY.

02:49:00.588 --> 02:49:04.494
Okay, drop whatever you're doing and go listen to the beefy transphobe.

02:49:04.815 --> 02:49:07.339
Brett's popularity on the Weinstein overwhelming.

02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:09.783
Mr. Hand's brand Vicodin.

02:49:10.123 --> 02:49:13.886
Do not excite anybody in the pharmaceutical industry because there's no profit to be made.

02:49:14.386 --> 02:49:18.790
A majority of my family's income comes through our two YouTube channels.

02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:20.171
Did you watch this episode?

02:49:20.191 --> 02:49:21.672
Because someone you know did.

02:49:22.072 --> 02:49:31.820
This is his little graph here where he shows that the Joe Rogan 2020 interview is the time when more people googled his name than any other.

02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:36.083
And the next big bump he has was when he went on the Joe Rogan podcast in 2021.

02:49:36.303 --> 02:49:37.444
This is how this works.

02:49:41.331 --> 02:49:50.223
It's not just people searching, it's them getting cued to search it, getting triggered to search it, getting encouraged to search it.

02:49:52.606 --> 02:49:54.668
And these are military mechanisms.

02:49:54.728 --> 02:49:57.832
These are military formulations, programs.

02:49:58.919 --> 02:50:02.221
That's why it happens in the exact way it is meant to happen.

02:50:02.321 --> 02:50:04.362
Joe Rogan emergency.

02:50:04.782 --> 02:50:08.684
Okay, drop whatever you're doing and go listen to the beefy transphobe.

02:50:09.004 --> 02:50:17.889
Brett's popularity on the Weinstein timeline over the next short while correlates almost exactly with the Google searches for

02:50:18.829 --> 02:50:19.349
horse pills.

02:50:20.349 --> 02:50:25.530
I just kind of put the numbers into Excel and it gave me like a high number.

02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:27.851
So that, does that prove anything anyway?

02:50:27.891 --> 02:50:28.191
I don't know.

02:50:28.511 --> 02:50:41.294
But clips from this podcast and from Brett's, you know, dark horse podcast were posted on a ton of anti-vax Facebook pages, including the Facebook page of Leslie Lawrenson.

02:50:42.114 --> 02:50:47.920
So nobody's getting that kind of promotion because it's a military programming.

02:50:48.801 --> 02:50:53.305
That promotion occurs because it's part of the program and the way the suite works.

02:50:53.766 --> 02:50:58.811
His account is turned on, everybody else's is either at neutral or is off.

02:50:59.895 --> 02:51:08.718
Leslie Lawrenson was a highly educated Cambridge graduate living in the UK who was a big fan of Brett Weinstein's intellectual dark horse pace show.

02:51:09.758 --> 02:51:17.020
He would post clips of Brett on his Facebook page advocating horse medication and downplaying the vaccine's effectiveness.

02:51:17.981 --> 02:51:21.982
Leslie refused to get the vaccine himself and on July 2nd, he died of COVID.

02:51:22.702 --> 02:51:29.008
His daughter told the UK press that Leslie was so brainwashed by the stuff that he was seeing on YouTube and social media.

02:51:29.569 --> 02:51:34.133
He said a lot of people will die more from having the vaccine than getting COVID.

02:51:34.393 --> 02:51:38.197
Which was true if the vaccine was not all placebo in places.

02:51:40.039 --> 02:51:46.005
Would be true if it wasn't placebo in many places, and that's another thing these people have covered up consistently for five years.

02:51:47.133 --> 02:51:49.415
And so again, you see how this works, right?

02:51:49.515 --> 02:52:04.191
How these coordinated liars can use each other, can platform off of each other, bounce off of each other to create the perfect limited spectrum of debate where it just seems like, well, Chill Goblin seems to have Brett's number here.

02:52:04.891 --> 02:52:08.415
I wonder what Chill Goblin's got to say about Trump and Epstein.

02:52:12.006 --> 02:52:18.812
Listen, if you don't have access to a vaccine and you decide to take horse paste as a preventative measure, I completely get that.

02:52:18.872 --> 02:52:24.877
You know, it's better to have a tiny chance of reducing the risk of COVID than nothing at all.

02:52:25.177 --> 02:52:35.986
But the difference is when like Brett, you advocate, you know, horse pills as a preventative measure and treatment for COVID while telling people.

02:52:36.166 --> 02:52:38.609
But what about a preventative measure for cancer?

02:52:39.454 --> 02:52:41.815
What about a preventative measure for COVID?

02:52:41.875 --> 02:52:43.936
What about a preventative measure for parasites?

02:52:43.976 --> 02:52:46.057
What about a preventative measure for cancer?

02:52:47.038 --> 02:52:48.638
Because that's what people are promoting.

02:52:48.658 --> 02:52:49.539
It does everything.

02:52:51.059 --> 02:52:53.220
But they never promote ivermectin by itself.

02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:55.161
It's always ivermectin and something else.

02:52:55.281 --> 02:52:59.903
Joe Rogan had monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, all of it.

02:53:00.524 --> 02:53:00.804
Zinc.

02:53:03.066 --> 02:53:06.808
But of course, the show tells you it was Ivermectin.

02:53:07.589 --> 02:53:09.590
Chill Goblin tells you it was Ivermectin.

02:53:10.170 --> 02:53:12.992
They have an emergency podcast to tell you it was Ivermectin.

02:53:13.012 --> 02:53:15.694
But they have no basis for that.

02:53:15.734 --> 02:53:20.297
And now you have somebody like this Malik doctor or Mal... Malik?

02:53:20.397 --> 02:53:20.817
Malice?

02:53:23.119 --> 02:53:25.680
The bald guy from Canada with all the skulls behind him.

02:53:26.381 --> 02:53:31.444
He's also always talking about Ivermectin in combination with other drugs curing things.

02:53:34.517 --> 02:53:36.179
Hydroxychloroquine and zinc.

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:42.945
That's a combination of substances that I think probably worked.

02:53:44.686 --> 02:53:47.449
At least that's where I would put any chips that I had to play.

02:53:47.469 --> 02:53:51.512
I would put them there and definitely not on ivermectin.

02:53:54.936 --> 02:54:00.581
I would put them on vitamin C as Paul Merrick would say before I would put it on vitamin D.

02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:08.322
that the vaccine is potentially more dangerous than the virus.

02:54:08.942 --> 02:54:15.206
Leslie was just one person who bought into Brett's fear-mongering and had a fatal result.

02:54:15.346 --> 02:54:17.587
But of course, there were others.

02:54:17.747 --> 02:54:27.213
The more Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein fans who decide not to get vaccinated or not to vaccinate their kids or go unvaccinated to their local rib fest.

02:54:27.353 --> 02:54:28.273
See what this is?

02:54:29.214 --> 02:54:30.435
See the disaster here?

02:54:30.575 --> 02:54:32.496
And Brett is responsible for that.

02:54:32.596 --> 02:54:33.697
Brett's shtick

02:54:34.694 --> 02:54:37.355
reinforces this guy's belief in the narrative.

02:54:37.475 --> 02:54:53.498
Brett's, his ability to catch Brett on this many mistakes and show how ridiculously he behaved, reinforces his belief in the lab leak, his belief in the working vaccine, his belief.

02:54:57.638 --> 02:54:59.779
And so maybe Chill Goblin can be saved by us.

02:55:03.601 --> 02:55:06.228
Hey, folks, welcome to the Dark Horse podcast.

02:55:06.869 --> 02:55:08.072
I have the distinct honor.

02:55:08.393 --> 02:55:09.035
On December 31st, 2022.

02:55:13.683 --> 02:55:16.764
He had Asim Malhotra on his podcast.

02:55:16.784 --> 02:55:28.689
I'm sitting this morning with Dr. Asim Malhotra, who is a consulting cardiologist, president of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Public Health Collaboration, a bestselling author, among many other distinctions.

02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:30.910
Dr. Malhotra, welcome to Dark Horse.

02:55:30.930 --> 02:55:31.450
Listen to this.

02:55:32.050 --> 02:55:32.430
Thank you.

02:55:32.530 --> 02:55:33.331
Listen to this.

02:55:35.589 --> 02:55:41.473
So many in my audience will be familiar with your story, but some will not.

02:55:42.173 --> 02:55:52.540
I know you as someone who has been a very forceful voice in the COVID dissident community, but a late emerging one.

02:55:52.560 --> 02:56:01.005
You want to explain how you ended up as a COVID dissident before we get into the questions that follow.

02:56:01.025 --> 02:56:02.006
Look at that smile.

02:56:03.086 --> 02:56:05.547
He's like, just totally dunked on him.

02:56:05.587 --> 02:56:07.927
Like, oh, but you're kind of late to the party.

02:56:08.047 --> 02:56:10.367
So why don't you tell us what you're up to?

02:56:12.248 --> 02:56:13.568
How's that for a dig?

02:56:14.128 --> 02:56:17.169
Just make sure you know that Brett Weinstein was on this stuff.

02:56:17.229 --> 02:56:20.410
I was on the Bill Maher podcast talking about a lab leak in 2020.

02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:23.550
So, so, you know, I was way ahead of all you guys.

02:56:25.551 --> 02:56:27.451
I knew this when my brother told me.

02:56:30.703 --> 02:56:37.151
Look at the face that Asim makes there, as he knows that he just got his face rubbed in the fact that he didn't show up until 2022.

02:56:37.692 --> 02:56:41.376
I mean, don't feel bad, Asim.

02:56:41.857 --> 02:56:48.225
The little bald guy in England, Doc Malek, he didn't show up until 2023 either.

02:56:50.629 --> 02:57:09.103
So what's curious about this is that right after he was on Brett Weinstein's podcast, he was also on stage in Sweden with Sasha Latupova and Robert Malone and Mike Palmer and Meryl Nass.

02:57:09.443 --> 02:57:11.164
I mean, that's a pretty amazing thing, right?

02:57:11.204 --> 02:57:13.886
Let's make sure you see the...

02:57:15.831 --> 02:57:20.754
The beginning part of this movie actually has the start where you can list it all.

02:57:20.794 --> 02:57:25.816
This was like a month later, or a couple weeks later, because it was the first week of January.

02:57:26.237 --> 02:57:37.603
So he's doing a tour that's paid for by the same people who, I guess, want Sasha Latupova and Meryl Ness and Robert Malone and Mike Palmer all on the stage together.

02:57:38.499 --> 02:57:43.503
telling us that it's an American military operation, fifth generation warfare, you're never going to figure out who it is.

02:57:43.543 --> 02:57:44.764
That's what Robert Malone says.

02:57:44.804 --> 02:57:49.187
That's what she says on the stage with Haseem Malhotra on stage with her.

02:57:49.207 --> 02:57:50.428
He's right there in that suit.

02:57:51.669 --> 02:57:52.449
He's right here.

02:57:57.193 --> 02:58:02.397
I have to see these people's behavior in the context of all that I know about them.

02:58:03.715 --> 02:58:09.879
all the Zoom meetings I've had, all the text messages I've had, all the weekly meetings I've had with Brian Hooker.

02:58:10.599 --> 02:58:12.740
Because Brian Hooker knows all of this stuff.

02:58:12.780 --> 02:58:14.361
We've talked about all of this stuff.

02:58:14.381 --> 02:58:16.983
We've talked about all of these people and what they've lied about.

02:58:17.483 --> 02:58:19.484
Brian Hooker was my boss.

02:58:20.765 --> 02:58:26.008
And now he's telling us that flu virus is in the pasteurized milk.

02:58:28.757 --> 02:58:39.147
It's heartbreaking to me to see the people that I believed in the most, the most, I believed in them the most, are also just having to go along with this.

02:58:40.248 --> 02:58:46.134
Wittingly or unwittingly, coerced or not, I don't know what's going on with him, but goodness sakes, Brian, wake up.

02:58:47.155 --> 02:58:49.658
You're selling out the children of the future.

02:58:49.698 --> 02:58:51.620
It's not just about us anymore.

02:58:59.079 --> 02:59:06.501
ICANN, CHD, FLCCC, PANDATA or PANDA, HEART in the UK, Doctors for COVID Ethics run by Mike Palmer.

02:59:06.901 --> 02:59:17.103
They were all either taken over by, sabotaged by, put in place by or orchestrated by people who are part of Team Worst Case Scenario.

02:59:17.123 --> 02:59:18.964
That includes George Webb and Associates.

02:59:18.984 --> 02:59:22.445
It includes Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Associates.

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:26.926
It includes Steve Bannon and Associates all the way back to Roger Stone and

02:59:27.527 --> 02:59:28.630
and Jerome Corsi.

02:59:28.951 --> 02:59:34.005
It goes all the way back to all of these people that are intellectual dark web adjacent.

02:59:35.503 --> 02:59:42.288
that argue about whether these bros with shows are right about those bros with shows are all singing the same harmony.

02:59:42.869 --> 02:59:57.500
They're all part of the same military social control mechanism that was described by Edward Bernays and by Noam Chomsky and others on the new and old media

02:59:58.393 --> 03:00:00.334
And it's fueled by the stocks.

03:00:00.434 --> 03:00:01.874
It's fueled by the trading.

03:00:01.934 --> 03:00:05.115
It's fueled by the infinite sources of money from the banks.

03:00:06.856 --> 03:00:11.137
And it's fueled by the artificial elevation of liars.

03:00:12.858 --> 03:00:25.022
You cannot get in touch with a country of 350 million people by scrolling on X. You can't get in touch with what's happening in your community by scrolling on X or scrolling on Facebook.

03:00:25.382 --> 03:00:26.463
There's too many of us.

03:00:27.631 --> 03:00:33.276
What these people have done is convinced us that that's what's happening because every once in a while you see your friends post.

03:00:33.797 --> 03:00:39.943
But what's actually happening is that your brain is being washed regularly, your child's brain is being washed regularly.

03:00:42.725 --> 03:00:49.692
And intelligent, thoughtful, creative thoughts are being replaced by whatever these monsters put there.

03:00:52.045 --> 03:01:08.955
And that includes the coordinated liars that are swarming the internet, that the overclass has placed there, and are able to trick us into believing anything so long as we still think that skillful use of social media is the way out, and it is not.

03:01:11.112 --> 03:01:14.958
It is exactly what Edward Bernays never dreamed would be possible.

03:01:15.399 --> 03:01:20.047
It is exactly what Noam Chomsky never believed would be possible.

03:01:20.107 --> 03:01:25.596
That Marc Van Rans, the flu commissioner of Belgium, never believed would be possible.

03:01:27.185 --> 03:01:50.665
that an illusion of consensus about what RNA can do could be created on the internet and would be so all-encompassing that both the left and the right, the red and the blue, the up and the down, everybody would become convinced that RNA can pandemic, would believe it wholeheartedly to the point where they would be afraid of people making RNA because it might pandemic.

03:01:53.755 --> 03:02:12.527
And it has culminated now in another meddler who is responsible for coordinating all the international COVID summits over the last five years, where team worst case scenario met at all these international locations, was on the high wire talking about the AI, but not telling you what actually happened.

03:02:12.567 --> 03:02:16.049
And instead telling you that cancer vaccines are kind of silly.

03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:21.072
That's because there will be no general cancer vaccine.

03:02:21.092 --> 03:02:22.533
There will be a personalized one.

03:02:23.831 --> 03:02:26.996
that the FDA could never test and would only get in the way of.

03:02:28.097 --> 03:02:40.295
Just like if the FDA ever had to test coronavirus PCR tests and evaluate them as effective medical devices, that the FDA would end the testing regime.

03:02:41.547 --> 03:03:03.397
But instead, because the EUA and their use during the pandemic is being used as a false equivalence, the FDA will never check in with the effectiveness of the medical devices that were rolled out during the pandemic, will never investigate the ones that are already gone, nevermind the ones that are currently on the market, and Robert Malone knows that.

03:03:04.636 --> 03:03:07.717
That's what Team Worst Case Scenario was primarily involved in.

03:03:08.158 --> 03:03:21.944
They were primarily involved in an anti-FDA campaign that would sort of remove the value of safe and effective, remove the meaning of these words, which is the mandate of the FDA.

03:03:22.344 --> 03:03:29.808
The FDA is supposed to protect us from people who would put bullshit on the labels of bottles.

03:03:31.035 --> 03:03:39.597
The FDA is supposed to make sure that what's in the bottle is on the label and that the label doesn't make any claims of safety or effectiveness that are not proven.

03:03:40.918 --> 03:03:52.721
And so they use the five years of the pandemic to make safe and effective sound stupid to people, become meaningless to people, so that the very mandate of the FDA would also become meaningless to people.

03:03:54.898 --> 03:04:10.255
And this is really good for people like Kevin McKernan and Mark Lander and Francis Collins, who have always known, and Peggy Hamburg, who have always known that personalized medicine, like Joshua Lederberg, that personalized medicine is the way forward.

03:04:12.165 --> 03:04:14.947
And so we need to get rid of the FDA in order for that to happen.

03:04:14.987 --> 03:04:31.600
That's why the health freedom movement is just on processed foods and fluoride in the water and corn syrup and not the vaccine schedule being criminal or intramuscular injection being dumb or RNA cannot pandemic because the health freedom movement is a joke on our grandkids and we need to wake up and apologize to them.

03:04:33.217 --> 03:04:43.345
There's only one chance in history for them to invert our sovereignty to experimental animal status so that they can collect our data and store it to feed it into the AI they're building now.

03:04:44.626 --> 03:04:45.586
They told us as much.

03:04:45.846 --> 03:05:02.439
The trick is to realize that the remnant stream created by fake PCR testing as a diagnostic is still in existence, still not being challenged by any of these people, and that's because that's their primary source of data that they are feeding to their AI, their god.

03:05:04.653 --> 03:05:06.274
I'll summarize it in one slide.

03:05:06.794 --> 03:05:11.437
They took a background signal and misconstrued that as spread using nonspecific PCR tests.

03:05:11.477 --> 03:05:17.081
Then they rolled out transfection that they knew would kill people, and they rolled out a lot of placebos so that they could lie about it.

03:05:17.121 --> 03:05:23.565
They also murdered people to manufacture the necessary signal because RNA cannot pandemic.

03:05:23.625 --> 03:05:25.026
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

03:05:25.066 --> 03:05:30.610
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime, and the population pyramid is the problem that they are managing.

03:05:31.310 --> 03:05:32.051
Ta-da!

03:05:33.069 --> 03:05:34.130
How's that for a summary?

03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:37.772
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR as a diagnostic is a lie.

03:05:38.012 --> 03:05:44.657
And that fidelity is implied and it is not there because it works on an academic bench doesn't mean it works in a hospital.

03:05:45.117 --> 03:05:47.539
They can make large quantities of DNA though.

03:05:47.579 --> 03:05:51.601
And all the people that work for pharmaceutical companies know that's how biologics are made.

03:05:52.102 --> 03:05:55.344
That's why it's very likely that Mike Eden is probably not working for us.

03:05:55.424 --> 03:05:57.725
Just like Sasha Latupov is not working for us.

03:05:58.226 --> 03:06:02.629
And that's probably why Paul Alexander promoted Mike Eden in his last sub stack about me.

03:06:03.489 --> 03:06:08.631
because it's never going to be about me or never going to be about the ideas that I've stumbled upon.

03:06:09.051 --> 03:06:17.974
It's always going to be about team worst case scenario in the end because they must cover up that the only thing they have is synthetic recombinant genetics.

03:06:18.034 --> 03:06:25.396
The only thing they have is bacterial cultures and DNA plasmids and printing DNA and RNA

03:06:26.206 --> 03:06:34.370
but they don't have, they don't have RNA in the form of a pattern integrity that grows in culture and can pandemic.

03:06:35.410 --> 03:06:38.552
So they have to lie about it because transfection was always a crime.

03:06:38.772 --> 03:06:43.274
We always knew it was shit and we've known it since we used it on the academic bench.

03:06:43.314 --> 03:06:53.819
And they even have liars lying about that now that include Dr. Jack Krause, the guy who went on the Danny Jones podcast with the orange glasses is now tweeting transfection as a word.

03:06:58.450 --> 03:07:06.012
None of these people are going to explain to you that the manufacturing quotas of a billion doses could be met very easily if you just let us make a few placebo.

03:07:09.013 --> 03:07:21.956
That's why Sasha Latupova had to trick Mike Eden or Mike Eden started promoting the idea that Sasha Latupova had batch data because that covers up the placebo and how much better placebo would work.

03:07:24.147 --> 03:07:27.789
Another thing that none of these people talk about is the myth of endemicity.

03:07:27.869 --> 03:07:36.013
The idea that something can be found somewhere and then eventually spread and be everywhere forever is a myth.

03:07:38.995 --> 03:07:43.917
Because RNA cannot pandemic, because RNA is not a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

03:07:43.957 --> 03:07:47.519
Therefore, endemicity and endemic, it is a myth.

03:07:50.828 --> 03:07:51.729
It's a background.

03:07:51.769 --> 03:07:56.754
And the only thing they can do is make a pure quantity and make a big one.

03:07:57.034 --> 03:08:03.981
So they could put it on a cruise ship or they could give it to their agent in Wuhan and she could report the whatever sequence they told her to report.

03:08:06.884 --> 03:08:08.606
That's how they got away with it, ladies and gentlemen.

03:08:08.706 --> 03:08:11.709
One slide, you can explain the whole thing to your friends, family.

03:08:12.210 --> 03:08:12.991
It's not very hard.

03:08:13.959 --> 03:08:15.880
Healthy people don't get sick, ladies and gentlemen.

03:08:15.900 --> 03:08:24.323
The reason why we didn't understand this at the beginning of the pandemic is because all of us in high school learned this bad biology 101 that I'm going to make it my life's work to erase.

03:08:24.863 --> 03:08:31.805
This bad biology 1 can be summarized by evolution because DNA or DNA therefore evolution and it's wrong.

03:08:33.446 --> 03:08:35.366
You want to break it with your doctor?

03:08:35.746 --> 03:08:39.808
Ask them to explain why intramuscular injection of medicine is a good thing, good idea.

03:08:41.783 --> 03:08:42.463
Because it's not.

03:08:42.623 --> 03:08:45.085
It's actually the worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

03:08:45.105 --> 03:08:48.907
And everybody that ever told us that intramuscular injection was a good idea should have known that.

03:08:49.487 --> 03:08:50.368
And many of them did.

03:08:52.789 --> 03:08:58.452
A new Biology 101 would be codified as, Life is a Pattern Integrity with a Trajectory Across Time.

03:08:59.833 --> 03:09:04.175
And I'm going to make a bold statement right now and say that that book will probably be written by May of 2025.

03:09:05.922 --> 03:09:09.563
It's not going to be that long because Biology 101 is pretty simple.

03:09:10.284 --> 03:09:13.205
And I think I can be one of the biology coaches as they get us there.

03:09:13.845 --> 03:09:27.830
Ladies and gentlemen, this new world order, this new illusion of consensus on social media and how it is portrayed will result in the past fading into mist and it will be erased effectively.

03:09:28.570 --> 03:09:31.832
if we do not hold on to it and pass it to our children intact.

03:09:32.592 --> 03:09:38.835
The lie will become the truth if we do not take control of what our children understand.

03:09:40.219 --> 03:10:05.194
If we allow our children to get on board with this faith in a novel virus where we defeated a disease now and in the past with vaccination, that coronaviruses jump from species to species and that RNA can pandemic, if we allow our kids to think that PCR is just erroneous or fixable or if used correctly would work as a diagnostic, if we allow our kids

03:10:05.851 --> 03:10:09.752
to think that there's something evolving in the background that's endemic now.

03:10:10.293 --> 03:10:20.256
If we allow our kids to think that this is money well spent, they will be on this train to nowhere and that will be generations of enslavement the destination.

03:10:22.497 --> 03:10:27.679
Enslavement by a mythology created on both sides of a limited spectrum of debate.

03:10:28.980 --> 03:10:32.381
A military operation using military software

03:10:33.462 --> 03:10:36.024
that we innocuously call social media.

03:10:36.864 --> 03:10:39.366
Don't let your children get on this train, ladies and gentlemen.

03:10:40.346 --> 03:10:42.528
Do not let this be a joke on our grandchildren.

03:10:44.569 --> 03:10:46.731
Spread the biology.

03:10:47.731 --> 03:10:48.432
Spread the truth.

03:10:51.494 --> 03:10:53.175
It's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

03:10:53.215 --> 03:10:56.557
It's absolutely, positively for all the marbles.

03:11:08.206 --> 03:11:10.288
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.

03:11:10.949 --> 03:11:13.812
I'm gonna go chill out on my birthday.

03:11:14.513 --> 03:11:18.738
Probably gonna go shoot some hoops, although I think somebody's got a sore ankle, so I don't know if that's gonna work.

03:11:21.343 --> 03:11:28.645
I'll be here again tomorrow because Mark and I are going to stream the confirmation hearing of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:11:28.685 --> 03:11:31.746
live, so you can join Mark and I for a stream tomorrow morning.

03:11:31.786 --> 03:11:36.787
I'm not sure when that thing is going to start, but we'll start when they start or a little bit earlier.

03:11:37.367 --> 03:11:40.728
Mark and I haven't done a live stream together for a while, so it'll be nice to catch up.

03:11:42.288 --> 03:11:44.249
And again, I don't know what to say.

03:11:45.189 --> 03:11:56.455
after all these years but thank you very much to Greg and to Steven and to William and to Mark and to Pamela and to... I mean the list is endless.

03:11:56.515 --> 03:12:03.539
Simon, Matt, I mean the list is really long of the people that I need to thank.

03:12:09.164 --> 03:12:12.410
And I hope the list gets longer because if it does, we're going to win.

03:12:13.311 --> 03:12:14.233
We're going to win for sure.

03:12:14.914 --> 03:12:15.876
Thanks for being here guys.

03:12:16.337 --> 03:12:17.138
I'll see you again tomorrow.
