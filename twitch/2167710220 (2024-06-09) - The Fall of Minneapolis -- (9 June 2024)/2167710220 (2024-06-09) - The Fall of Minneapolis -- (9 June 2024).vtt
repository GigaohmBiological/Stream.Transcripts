WEBVTT

00:04.298 --> 00:06.662
Cash money, cash money indeed.

00:08.044 --> 00:10.488
It's almost like you know when I'm gonna stream or something.

00:58.513 --> 01:22.129
Step in front of a runaway train Just to feel alive again Pushing forward through the night Taking just a glimmer of sight It's all part of something

01:25.945 --> 01:39.261
It's so far, so far away Cold wind blows into the skin

01:58.966 --> 02:11.488
It's so far, so far away Who are you trying to impress?

02:11.588 --> 02:25.891
Steadily creating mess Stood in front of a runaway train

02:35.179 --> 02:47.291
We should be going through the night Making just a blurry sight Making just a blurry sight

03:03.371 --> 03:05.133
I said, Jedis don't give up.

03:05.653 --> 03:11.937
I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup.

03:12.277 --> 03:14.799
But if he made a mistake, he would try and right that wrong.

03:14.859 --> 03:16.880
So right there, we had a fundamental difference.

03:18.208 --> 03:19.348
It's not my story anymore.

03:19.588 --> 03:20.889
It's somebody else's story.

03:21.089 --> 03:25.670
And Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective.

03:26.330 --> 03:29.551
That's the crux of my problem.

03:30.392 --> 03:31.792
Luke would never say that.

03:32.472 --> 03:32.993
I'm sorry.

03:33.053 --> 03:34.333
Well, in this version, see.

03:34.713 --> 03:37.054
I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars.

03:37.414 --> 03:39.455
This is the next generation of Star Wars.

03:39.475 --> 03:42.476
So I almost had to think of Luke as another character.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.376
Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.

03:44.436 --> 03:46.397
He's not my Luke Skywalker.

03:46.777 --> 03:52.159
But I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.120
But listen, I still haven't accepted it completely.

03:55.180 --> 03:56.640
But it's only a movie.

03:56.740 --> 03:57.760
I hope people like it.

03:57.780 --> 03:58.941
I hope they don't get upset.

03:59.001 --> 04:02.382
And I came to really believe that Ryan was the exact

04:02.822 --> 04:04.723
man that they needed for this job.

04:07.965 --> 04:11.988
I'm sorry, I don't want anybody to think that Mark Hamill is a putz.

04:12.048 --> 04:14.029
I think Mark Hamill is being used.

04:14.309 --> 04:16.291
I don't think that he's got a lot of choice.

04:17.338 --> 04:28.984
I think anybody that's been on that side of Hollywood for that long either knows or has existed just outside of knowing, you know, kind of like they do in the military with the look-away doctrine.

04:29.004 --> 04:30.725
We don't need to know what's behind that curtain.

04:31.266 --> 04:34.988
I assume I know what's behind that curtain, but please don't tell me.

04:36.047 --> 04:40.988
And so that's why he's doing these sort of over-the-top ads for Biden right now.

04:41.048 --> 04:49.391
It's almost like, I'll do it, but I'm gonna do it in such an over-the-top ridiculous way that I'm gonna still be able to say what I want to say.

04:49.411 --> 04:51.251
And he kind of did that with Star Wars too.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.632
So I get it.

04:52.732 --> 04:55.533
He's a putz, but I mean, I don't know.

04:55.953 --> 04:57.793
I've got no video or music over here.

04:57.893 --> 04:58.233
Anyone?

04:58.393 --> 04:59.474
I've got video.

04:59.654 --> 05:00.174
Anyone else?

05:00.794 --> 05:01.514
Just refresh.

05:02.475 --> 05:03.215
Talk to me, Goose.

05:48.923 --> 05:49.064
you

06:26.604 --> 06:30.765
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:31.245 --> 06:35.426
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:35.926 --> 06:40.087
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:41.947 --> 06:43.507
I think truth is good for kids.

06:43.947 --> 06:47.768
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

06:48.248 --> 06:49.869
We want everybody to feel good.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.169
That's not the way life is.

06:54.721 --> 06:56.221
But you can tell if someone's lying.

06:56.882 --> 06:58.642
You can sort of feel it in people.

07:00.443 --> 07:01.163
And I have lied.

07:01.183 --> 07:02.203
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:02.223 --> 07:03.164
I don't want to lie.

07:03.904 --> 07:05.004
I don't think I'm a liar.

07:05.104 --> 07:06.145
I try not to be a liar.

07:06.165 --> 07:07.025
I don't want to be a liar.

07:07.585 --> 07:10.306
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

07:14.178 --> 07:32.681
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

07:32.701 --> 07:42.283
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

07:45.998 --> 07:58.909
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

07:59.030 --> 08:04.534
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

08:04.835 --> 08:06.776
It's just a big hassle in the end.

08:08.797 --> 08:23.127
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

08:23.187 --> 08:25.689
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

08:30.295 --> 08:31.616
so so

09:01.252 --> 09:02.213
the the

09:26.815 --> 09:29.637
Good morning, everyone, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

09:29.677 --> 09:34.959
This is Guillaume Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:34.979 --> 09:44.004
We are trying to dispel the enchantment, and that enchantment is a chorus of people agreeing to lie to us.

09:44.044 --> 09:50.007
The microphone feels a little hot there.

09:50.027 --> 09:52.008
Let me see if I got that right now.

09:57.708 --> 09:58.508
Good morning, everybody.

09:58.548 --> 10:00.109
It's good to see everybody in the chat.

10:00.829 --> 10:09.433
I want to take a little break from the biology, so to speak, but not a break from this illusion.

10:09.473 --> 10:17.117
But I want to approach it from a very different angle today, because I think we put people very much on their heels.

10:17.717 --> 10:26.361
And oftentimes, oftentimes, I'm finding it better

10:29.531 --> 10:35.074
to relax a little bit once we shift the momentum like we have.

10:35.834 --> 10:40.716
Because they're still not even coming close to really discussing this stuff.

10:42.577 --> 10:48.040
Placebo batches are just absolutely nothing that anyone can talk about.

10:48.060 --> 10:57.444
The discussion of infectious clones as transfection and transformation in cell culture

10:58.669 --> 11:03.132
and that being the essential methodology of virology.

11:03.212 --> 11:06.114
No one seems to be able to talk about that.

11:06.174 --> 11:09.637
They just want you to think that, yeah, we make viruses, yeah, we can do that.

11:11.398 --> 11:19.104
Nothing, no chitter-chatter about, wow, Jessica really needs to be, we need to really figure out what this Jessica Hockett is talking about.

11:19.544 --> 11:19.944
Nothing.

11:20.705 --> 11:26.669
Just crickets on, let's make a list of how many different ways the protocols were murdered.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.430
Just nothing.

11:28.385 --> 11:31.306
Let's talk about gain of function and try to define it.

11:31.626 --> 11:32.046
Nothing.

11:33.607 --> 11:39.548
And still, none of these people can come to the possibility that, hey, maybe the government just lied about this stuff.

11:40.048 --> 11:43.349
Maybe the government and pharmaceutical companies together lied about it.

11:43.409 --> 11:48.951
Maybe the government and the pharmaceutical companies and media companies and social media just lied about it.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.547
They can't come to that possibility.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.208
It's like, nah, that can't happen.

11:53.748 --> 12:04.055
It could be a spontaneous group of people and lemmings that just decide to run us all off of a cliff because they want to make money and buy expensive cars.

12:04.235 --> 12:04.635
Could be.

12:05.615 --> 12:06.656
They want a bigger house.

12:06.716 --> 12:07.717
I guess it could be that.

12:08.077 --> 12:15.842
But it could never be a bunch of people that want all that stuff and more working together to tell us a story that would accomplish the same thing.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.363
No way.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.404
That would be just nuts.

12:24.574 --> 12:37.957
Well, there's gonna be a little bit of problem here, because again, if you're attributing bad motives to Jessica without just saying, okay, I think Jessica's bad, but her point about New York City is incredible, then you're not really doing it.

12:38.277 --> 12:48.659
Just like if you put a crack pipe in my mouth, and you don't say anything about the biology that I've been trying to teach for the last four years, then you're not usefully engaging in a debate, and in fact,

12:49.943 --> 12:55.747
You're doing what this almost completely unknown American said many, many years ago.

12:55.827 --> 13:01.010
You can engage in any kind of belief if you use that level of reasoning.

13:02.972 --> 13:07.795
And of course, they also have weaponized piles of money behind them.

13:08.953 --> 13:13.816
They also have the pre-programmed benefit of social media behind them.

13:13.916 --> 13:17.458
The real censorship is not the stuff that you can cry about.

13:17.478 --> 13:21.180
The real censorship is not the stuff where you then get promoted somewhere else.

13:21.780 --> 13:24.202
The real censorship isn't actually seen.

13:26.696 --> 13:40.645
How incredibly crazy is it that these people that have been trying to teach us about fifth generation warfare try to make you believe that the censorship is as easy as showing you that, look, I got canceled from LinkedIn.

13:41.346 --> 13:44.808
Look, YouTube took away my monetization.

13:45.308 --> 13:47.149
Look, we had to go to Gab.

13:47.610 --> 13:49.851
Look, we have a locals group.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.053
Look, we had to go to Discord.

13:52.813 --> 13:55.155
Look, PayPal took away my money.

13:56.455 --> 13:57.976
And then you go on Tucker and say it.

13:58.957 --> 14:01.218
You get promoted by other people who are pro- what?

14:03.079 --> 14:10.123
The censorship that matters is not actually visible because they have control over the thing you're looking through.

14:11.583 --> 14:16.486
You really think that the censorship that's visible that people get to cry about is actually relevant?

14:17.206 --> 14:19.908
Wouldn't that be a pretty crappy system of censorship?

14:20.848 --> 14:22.029
Are we really that dumb?

14:26.872 --> 14:29.473
We need to learn this history before they erase it.

14:30.574 --> 14:34.055
We need to stop asking the questions that they are arguing about.

14:35.896 --> 14:39.878
Because the charlatans have power over us because they have made us.

14:41.458 --> 14:50.242
They have created a propensity, an almost impossibility to ask the right question, a propensity to always be arguing about the wrong questions.

14:52.063 --> 14:56.065
And then only one question, and focus really hard on it.

14:58.479 --> 15:00.361
And this is only half of the charlatans.

15:01.081 --> 15:04.484
This is only the forward-facing TV version of the charlatans.

15:07.907 --> 15:15.794
And if we're gonna make gentle the life of this world, we're gonna have to understand our history with a little more nuance than what's being offered to us.

15:18.456 --> 15:22.520
A little more nuance than what's being offered to us, ladies and gentlemen.

15:27.406 --> 15:28.627
This is what it is right here.

15:28.667 --> 15:32.151
You see, this is an artificial sea wave.

15:33.012 --> 15:38.858
This is an artificial wave generated by the machine that you see to the left there, and that's why it's such a perfect wave.

15:39.798 --> 15:46.825
And this perfect wave is very akin to what they did to social media and have been doing to mainstream media for decades.

15:47.577 --> 15:49.618
They create stories.

15:49.738 --> 16:00.025
They create limited spectrums of debate, which people are able to very vigorously swim through and feel the currents of and say, see, I see the wave.

16:00.105 --> 16:00.565
I see it.

16:01.366 --> 16:02.306
It's a pandemic.

16:02.366 --> 16:13.994
It's an illusion of consensus created by a bunch of people on the internet and on TV that agree that certain questions are the right ones to ask and the answers are the right ones to argue about.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.435
You gotta stay focused on the biology that you can learn.

16:19.255 --> 16:23.817
You can't take any of their social media bait because it's almost exclusively lies.

16:24.457 --> 16:25.357
Exaggerations.

16:26.298 --> 16:30.619
And you've gotta work on trying to develop a relationship with your neighbors and your community again.

16:30.639 --> 16:34.841
And especially those in your immediate vicinity because...

16:36.838 --> 16:45.972
When social media decides to throw out the right bait, only a resilient community that's connected from within is gonna be able to resist it.

16:47.236 --> 16:52.118
Ladies and gentlemen, the way that GigaOM Biological works is people share this work and not enough people are doing it.

16:52.158 --> 16:53.499
We need more Soothspiders.

16:54.039 --> 17:06.164
That would be great, but we need more people sharing what Soothspider does and what Jeff from Earth has got some just an amazing wealth of videos on Instagram that you can easily take and post elsewhere.

17:08.779 --> 17:34.336
and we really need that because I know this sounds like a never-ending story but or never-ending complaining but we are running on fumes here and it's fine because an RV can run on fumes but I would like it very very much if I could put some of the stress off of my family and off of the inability to

17:35.137 --> 17:36.578
to see very far forward.

17:37.598 --> 17:51.645
And that would be being able to, you know, not have to... Anyway, if you can find a way to support or share the work, sharing would really help a lot because we just don't seem to get any views.

17:51.765 --> 17:53.066
And so nobody new sees it.

17:53.106 --> 17:57.288
And so the people that are already able to support the stream and are sharing it regularly are doing that.

17:57.588 --> 18:00.129
And so we need more people.

18:00.629 --> 18:01.530
And so I need your...

18:02.210 --> 18:09.816
participation in that at the same time as we try to bring people to understand what it means to engage in informed noncompliance.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.157
I'm really excited to be here.

18:11.737 --> 18:14.599
Very happy with our progress this past few weeks.

18:14.659 --> 18:16.120
Thank you very much, everyone.

18:16.180 --> 18:16.881
Thank you very much.

18:17.821 --> 18:19.483
This is GigaOM Biological.

18:47.434 --> 18:48.474
Good morning, everybody.

18:50.322 --> 18:51.982
Hazel Green, Wisconsin.

18:53.003 --> 18:53.723
An alligator.

18:54.743 --> 18:55.223
Interesting.

18:57.783 --> 18:58.724
It's June 9th, 2024.

18:58.804 --> 19:05.025
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

19:05.105 --> 19:07.085
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

19:07.365 --> 19:07.805
It's 1129.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.866
And yeah, it's a nice day.

19:11.486 --> 19:12.546
It's windy, but it's sunny.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.187
I think it's going to be warm for the rest of the day.

19:14.227 --> 19:14.707
I'm excited.

19:17.404 --> 19:18.564
I'm a human just like you.

19:18.584 --> 19:19.725
I've got a family.

19:19.745 --> 19:21.405
I rent my house.

19:21.445 --> 19:22.925
I don't have a book deal.

19:22.945 --> 19:28.647
I was hired by Children's Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:29.987 --> 19:34.748
for a year and then hired by Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland for six months.

19:36.649 --> 19:41.490
And I used to be a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine before the pandemic.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.651
I will be speaking at the Red Pill Expo next weekend.

19:46.111 --> 19:49.453
Anybody that wants to can also join in a live stream.

19:50.913 --> 19:53.034
And I very much encourage you to do so.

19:53.054 --> 20:00.177
I'm going to do my best to represent the last four years of work that many of you have participated in as best I can.

20:00.777 --> 20:07.020
And I'm not going to pull any punches because this may be the only time I ever get to be on stage and have this kind of audience.

20:07.060 --> 20:11.762
So if you only get one shot when they give you the microphone,

20:13.345 --> 20:13.565
right?

20:14.086 --> 20:15.107
You got no other choice.

20:15.267 --> 20:20.051
So we're going to basically try to work really hard so that people can't deny.

20:20.071 --> 20:27.597
Oh, there we went.

20:27.617 --> 20:31.280
Oh, I didn't load that in.

20:31.401 --> 20:32.421
Is that what happened here?

20:32.942 --> 20:34.844
Okay, let me see if that's the case.

20:35.876 --> 20:36.456
Sorry about that.

20:37.157 --> 20:40.618
Producer fell asleep while he was, there it is.

20:41.058 --> 20:41.818
That's what it is.

20:41.898 --> 20:43.159
I didn't set that camera yet.

20:43.999 --> 20:50.622
Sometimes, you know, fancy set up like mine with two cameras, not one.

20:50.782 --> 20:56.804
Whoa, I'm almost like, I'm almost like Dr. Drew over here with producers and stuff.

20:56.884 --> 20:57.885
I got two cameras.

20:59.673 --> 21:01.493
Oh, it's not gonna like this yellow, of course.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.754
It's not gonna like this yellow.

21:02.794 --> 21:07.654
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

21:08.155 --> 21:11.835
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

21:12.275 --> 21:16.916
Of course, anybody with a brain on their shoulders could have taken this further.

21:17.336 --> 21:27.498
Anybody with 100,000 or a million followers that's supposed to be an evolutionary biologist that had me on signal or an epidemiologist that's met me in person several times

21:27.918 --> 21:37.201
could have taken these ideas and tried to distill them down into something a little more understandable, like weaponize piles of money, murdered people, and convince people to agree about it being a lab leak.

21:37.221 --> 21:48.785
You know, convince people like Zuby and Dan Wilson, the old vaccine schedules, injuring and killing thousands every year, and getting a bunch of people like Dan Wilson and Zuby to agree not to talk about that.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.968
We don't need to fear free-range RNA molecules.

21:51.988 --> 22:01.760
It's a very clever way of saying that these virologists have grossly over-exaggerated the fidelity of their understanding, and yet nobody seems to be able to say this stuff.

22:01.800 --> 22:08.267
The no-virus people can't get past viral culture, isolation, and purification.

22:08.928 --> 22:20.771
They could never say any of these things, you know, to bolster their claim that, look, there's this lie about virology, and then there's this murderer that they lied about to preserve that lie about virology.

22:21.211 --> 22:22.332
See how easy it is?

22:22.372 --> 22:23.432
You don't need an hour.

22:24.292 --> 22:27.393
And yet somehow or another, these people have had four years.

22:28.757 --> 22:35.203
And the only person that's been able to get here is me, and that's the only person that they agree isn't worth listening to across the board.

22:35.243 --> 22:39.287
The no virus people think I'm a meddler working for RFK still.

22:42.690 --> 22:43.831
It's extraordinary.

22:45.052 --> 22:52.299
I have wonderful thumbnails on Kevin McCairn's Rumble page with me taking money from Pharisees.

22:54.224 --> 22:59.025
And Kevin has Mark and I riding a merry-go-round.

23:01.066 --> 23:13.050
And it's hilarious that they could just debunk this page right here, this screen right here with some, look, we know that this is bull, but they won't.

23:13.110 --> 23:17.951
They can't touch it with a 10-foot pole unless they can start with, well, there was a furin cleavage site.

23:27.779 --> 23:40.043
And that's because these people were put in place at the beginning of the pandemic and before some of the more trusted sources like Brett Weinstein, Carl Peterson, and Joe Rogan were put in place before the pandemic.

23:40.683 --> 23:43.144
This is a multi-generational plan.

23:43.644 --> 23:47.166
So there's gonna be a few years that you weren't aware about.

23:48.006 --> 23:54.068
There's gonna be a few machinations that happened in the background, a few legislations that were passed.

23:55.080 --> 24:05.231
that people like Catherine Watt have done very good at putting out the 21st Century Something Something Act and the PrEP Act and these other things that all add up together.

24:05.251 --> 24:09.015
But there are specific places that we could focus our attention.

24:13.669 --> 24:22.660
And very few people that have risen high enough to matter have been able to succinctly say any of the things that we say consistently here on this channel.

24:22.680 --> 24:32.372
They can say one of them, they can say a form of one of them, but none of them are able to add it all up and to realize that the simpler you can say it, the better.

24:33.433 --> 24:46.340
Some of these people now are like, well, iatrogenic genocide or iatrogenic euthanasia, or they can't quite say murder.

24:51.523 --> 24:55.045
And the spread of bad ideas is still happening now.

24:55.125 --> 25:00.728
It is very difficult to go onto Twitter and understand if you're seeing what anyone else sees.

25:00.768 --> 25:01.369
And in fact,

25:02.745 --> 25:03.245
You're not.

25:03.986 --> 25:05.366
We already know that we're not.

25:07.107 --> 25:15.510
And so it can be very frustrating to go on Twitter and to see what other people are doing and imagine what other people are seeing and trying to understand what's going on there.

25:15.530 --> 25:16.170
You can't.

25:17.531 --> 25:22.873
And I need to be reminded of that almost every day by someone in my family or by my dog.

25:24.514 --> 25:32.137
Sometimes it's just my dog that comes in my bed and puts her paws on my face like, will you please stop looking at that abyss?

25:34.212 --> 25:48.636
but it is exactly this abyss that got us here because Kevin McKernan, for example, was on podcasts very early in 2020 claiming that it was there where he was having these meaningful conversations about the truth.

25:50.796 --> 26:02.419
And it is of course there over the last three years that a large sect of the world has come to understand Elon Musk as preserving the freedom of the town square around the world using Twitter.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.596
Stop lying.

26:09.939 --> 26:14.062
And that's why we've come to the stage where I feel like you can really summarize it like this.

26:14.102 --> 26:16.244
You can see them because they won't talk.

26:18.226 --> 26:21.889
They won't talk about what they were doing in 2020 in particular.

26:22.949 --> 26:32.257
They definitely don't want you to know exactly what they were talking about in 2020 because if you saw it, you would be shocked at how close Kevin McKernan

26:34.318 --> 26:35.579
and Brett Weinstein are.

26:36.500 --> 26:57.061
Brett Weinstein, the guy with the dad who's like one of the biggest arbitrators of biotechnology in America that did this case after case after case that's kind of relevant for all kinds of things like the FDA and stuff and goes all the way back to being the first patent lawyer appointed to the Department of Justice in the Department of Justice of Bobby Kennedy's dad.

26:58.629 --> 27:07.169
You know, his uncle, John F. Kennedy, he appointed him to the Department of Justice that was headed by his brother, you know, the dad of that guy.

27:13.649 --> 27:29.493
It's very hard for me to hold this truth inside and not be a little bit afraid every time I say it out loud, because at first I contacted Bobby and said, Hey, Bobby, you know, uh, did you know that Brett Weinstein had you on his podcast in November of 2021 and only showed it now in February of 2023.

27:30.854 --> 27:33.634
And it wasn't really clear if Bobby was even aware of that.

27:34.495 --> 27:39.536
So then I said, well, you know what, but you might not also be aware then that his dad actually worked with your dad.

27:44.198 --> 27:46.380
It's not like Bobby called me up and then said, what?

27:46.580 --> 27:47.280
You're kidding me.

27:52.604 --> 27:56.166
I'm begging someone to understand this, okay?

27:56.206 --> 28:01.890
Because I'm seeing an alien that very few people can see and I'm telling the truth so they can't say anything.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.834
Otherwise, you know, somebody would have sued me by now.

28:08.235 --> 28:10.176
Somebody would have called me up and said, shut up.

28:11.837 --> 28:12.498
But they can't.

28:13.598 --> 28:14.519
They know they can't.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.961
And so I'm a huge problem.

28:19.622 --> 28:25.927
This is as close as you get to putting something in stone in modern culture, a book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:26.047 --> 28:28.288
that they're still selling.

28:28.328 --> 28:31.711
I mean, I have a chance that this book will be in a library for a very long time.

28:33.928 --> 28:39.714
So that means that Sina Bavari's paper and that reference will be in the library for a very long time.

28:39.734 --> 28:47.402
And that means that the idea that clones are the basic methodology of virology will actually be in the library for a long time.

28:47.442 --> 28:51.887
And then my statement that's on page 400, and let's see, I'll look in the index.

28:53.784 --> 29:03.127
where I said that they wouldn't even need a virus, on page 441, it is actually gonna be in the library for a long time, which is kind of cool.

29:03.787 --> 29:16.010
Because of all the people that we're supposed to be listening to, not very many people can say that they were a medical school faculty member in America at the time that the pandemic started.

29:16.050 --> 29:21.512
Not very many people can say that they had a YouTube channel where they were trying to teach their own field

29:22.777 --> 29:24.837
on a bicycle before the pandemic.

29:25.258 --> 29:32.379
Not very many people can say that they worked with a Nobel Prize winning lab during one of their postdocs before the pandemic.

29:32.899 --> 29:44.782
Not very many people can say that they've been to a seminar by Ron Fauchier while they were working at Erasmus in the Netherlands during their second postdoc.

29:45.362 --> 30:00.831
It's so weird because all of these things that they could be bringing up and saying that, look, this guy's a bad guy, actually also make it even crazier that I would come out in the beginning of the pandemic so naively and just say, hey, it looks like maybe this is a lab leak.

30:00.891 --> 30:02.712
I mean, why wouldn't it be a lab leak?

30:02.752 --> 30:08.235
There's all kinds of stuff in the bulletin of atomic scientists that says there's lab leaks all over the place.

30:08.295 --> 30:12.818
I was doing everything I needed to do to be the ultimate Scooby-Doo sleuth.

30:15.976 --> 30:19.119
So much so that Jessica Rose has been on my program.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.621
Mary Talley Bowden has been on my program.

30:21.701 --> 30:23.863
Augusto Rue has been on my program.

30:25.164 --> 30:29.107
Jessica Rose has been on my, all these people were on my program very early.

30:29.507 --> 30:33.651
Kevin McKernan honored me with two appearances on my stream.

30:37.148 --> 30:48.271
And now somehow or another, I've just, you know, I've just burnt all these bridges and I had a job with Bobby as a private consultant for a year and then CHD for a half a year working under Brian Hooker.

30:48.291 --> 30:55.013
I guess I burnt those bridges too because streaming from my, the back of my garage is so fun and so lucrative.

30:58.342 --> 31:09.752
And it's just, it's ludicrous because the only narrative that makes sense here is that every single thing I'm talking about with these, with regard to my experience with these people is not being distorted.

31:12.574 --> 31:16.838
The only thing that makes sense is that these people are coordinating their actions.

31:16.898 --> 31:24.084
And unfortunately, so many of them have over time coordinated their actions with me.

31:25.410 --> 31:30.975
And with regard to me, and I've been able to see it and they've blown it.

31:34.137 --> 31:41.283
And I don't even have everybody up here because if I put everybody up here, then everybody who I already know is working against America.

31:42.964 --> 31:43.825
And that's what this is.

31:44.125 --> 31:50.230
This is a group of traders and foreigners that are helping to orchestrate the controlled demolition of the American Republic.

31:54.008 --> 31:57.512
And if that idea is wrong, I'm probably going to go to my grave believing it.

32:01.876 --> 32:08.303
Everyone from Alex Jones to Brett Weinstein to Kevin McKernan to Jessica Rose, they're all working against specifically America.

32:08.343 --> 32:13.889
That's why they're not saving Israel and Canada and all these places where they're actually from.

32:18.817 --> 32:26.143
That's why a lot of these groups that are based in certain places outside of America don't do anything, almost, in the place that they're based.

32:26.283 --> 32:31.447
But they do a lot of noise-making in America and on American social media in English.

32:37.489 --> 32:49.297
That's why that fake French guy that came on the show a couple days ago came on and said that he was anonymous and it wouldn't do him any good if he came out and he can't point to anybody, anything that he's done in France because he didn't stand up yet.

32:52.299 --> 32:59.304
And I don't wanna be a creep, but I'm one of the first people that actually stood up, that had anything to lose and lost it.

33:00.359 --> 33:02.200
I lost a house I was renting to own.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.381
I lost a career that I worked 20 years for.

33:05.042 --> 33:14.868
And I lost a position and a microscope and a lab and students that I never, ever, ever would have given up if I would have given the choice to been able to stay.

33:14.888 --> 33:16.649
I wouldn't have taken a shot.

33:17.069 --> 33:21.512
I would have continued to speak out about it, but I would have worked as hard as I could to keep that job.

33:21.772 --> 33:22.312
I loved it.

33:23.453 --> 33:28.756
And more importantly, I thought I owed some people, you know, because they had helped me.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.540
And I believed in what I was working on.

33:37.523 --> 33:42.307
And there are very few people on that side of that screen over there who can tell you a story like that.

33:43.068 --> 33:45.090
Ahmed Malik's story is not like that.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.452
Dan Wilson's story is not like that.

33:47.532 --> 33:49.134
Zuby's story is not like that.

33:49.975 --> 33:51.136
Brett Weinstein's story.

33:51.156 --> 33:55.440
There's nobody over there who has a real story like that where they've lost something.

33:56.656 --> 34:00.677
Did Robert Malone have to give up the house that biosecurity state bought him?

34:01.117 --> 34:01.337
No.

34:01.798 --> 34:05.519
Did Kevin McKernan have to give up the house that the biosecurity state bought him?

34:05.639 --> 34:05.839
No.

34:06.459 --> 34:19.203
Did Brett Weinstein have to give up the wealth or the position or the social media fame that his fake operation at Evergreen and his half a million dollar settlement got him?

34:19.363 --> 34:19.583
Nope.

34:23.584 --> 34:32.747
It looks to me like Ryan Coles is in danger of losing something, but he may have had already so much that he's just losing the ability to make more.

34:34.487 --> 34:43.430
If you can retire, it's not exactly the same thing as your family might be homeless if you can't pay your rent and you don't own anything.

34:48.106 --> 35:08.459
And so I want to make very clear here, ladies and gentlemen, that, yeah, I'm a little bit pissed because, again, if you just do the scoreboard, I'm one of the least people that deserves to have a crack pipe put in my mouth by any of these anonymous accounts unless I'm doing it better and actually showing you the truth.

35:08.819 --> 35:10.400
That's the only thing they have left.

35:11.881 --> 35:16.304
We need to fear free-range RNA molecules is the book.

35:17.401 --> 35:19.082
That's the message of this book.

35:22.465 --> 35:37.116
That's why it's so extraordinary if you go into this book and find out all the stuff that I got in it, and that it's all nicely indexed, and that it gets a huge hat tip in the acknowledgments as the first listed expert.

35:39.778 --> 35:41.800
They tried really hard with me.

35:45.512 --> 35:48.675
And I'm trying to offer up to my children the truth.

35:52.097 --> 35:55.920
Someday my kids are gonna watch this stuff and I'm not gonna be ashamed, you see?

35:57.742 --> 36:02.826
I wonder if Kevin McCarron is keeping all of his videos for his kids to watch when he's gone.

36:04.656 --> 36:17.059
I wonder if Charles Rixey is keeping all of his videos from his Vajon Health appearances and his private conversations with Jeffrey Sachs so that his kids can know exactly how much of a hero he was.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.901
Does Jessica Rose have any kids to pass on her legacy to?

36:28.342 --> 36:29.402
What about Kevin McKernan?

36:32.281 --> 36:36.542
And what did Robert Malone's adult children already know about what their dad did?

36:37.662 --> 36:38.702
Is he risking anything?

36:38.722 --> 36:40.363
Of course not.

36:43.123 --> 36:50.145
Every day my kids go out into a world where they know that most of the adults would think that their dad was crazy if they knew what their dad did.

36:51.585 --> 36:54.026
How many of these other people are taking that risk?

36:56.403 --> 36:56.984
Or took it?

36:57.704 --> 37:05.891
Was Steve Kirsch taking that risk when he was using his contacts with Robert Malone to try and get EUAs and funding early treatment protocols?

37:08.614 --> 37:12.077
Was Robert Malone risking it when he was running the domain program?

37:14.099 --> 37:21.045
Was Brett Weinstein risking anything when he was telling people to wear bandanas to lockdown and to wear woodshop goggles to the store?

37:26.789 --> 37:28.310
Mike Eden was risking everything.

37:29.611 --> 37:32.674
Mike Eden was in front of the UK parliament saying it was bullshit.

37:34.776 --> 37:37.418
Thomas Binder spent some time in a psychiatric ward.

37:46.205 --> 37:52.791
I'm making some pretty bold accusations and I'm not pulling any punches and I'm very curious as to how come it's crickets.

37:55.342 --> 37:59.284
And I know why, because the truth is available on the internet still.

37:59.324 --> 38:03.307
All you gotta do is look up the podcasts that are still on YouTube.

38:04.247 --> 38:07.489
Shouldn't this have been bounced if it was really controversial?

38:07.929 --> 38:16.374
Shouldn't it have been bounced because he was saying that it's not a real novel virus and we have previous immunity.

38:16.434 --> 38:19.076
Isn't that kind of a scary thing to have said in May?

38:19.656 --> 38:21.057
Shouldn't it have been censored?

38:24.730 --> 38:31.092
until you realize and listen that what he said was no more dangerous to the narrative than what Brett Weinstein said.

38:32.713 --> 38:50.098
When you drop the possibility that it's a lab leak, but I'm gonna need to see some pretty big evidence first, you're seeding the exact same Scooby-Doo just in a different titrated way, and he's succeeded in being sort of present everywhere on this side of the debate for years now.

38:52.045 --> 39:00.253
And when you see that consistent presence for years now, circulating among the same people for years now, there's no other way to see it.

39:03.776 --> 39:11.844
It's very likely that these people are, these two in particular, are kind of near the middle of it in the sense of they've been so central to it for so long.

39:11.884 --> 39:14.927
Jessica Rose on this paper with Peter McCullough very early.

39:16.917 --> 39:22.742
Robert Malone doing all kinds of other things very early before he ended up having to come on this side of the narrative.

39:25.385 --> 39:30.229
And when he came forward, it was first almost like they wanted to just claim credit for the RNA.

39:31.530 --> 39:35.274
And of course, this podcast now is just extraordinary when you watch it.

39:35.314 --> 39:43.341
I can almost get sick every time I listen to the introduction because he says all kinds of crazy stuff that really is not what I know.

39:44.164 --> 39:53.869
And then he only reads the first paragraph of my thesis because the last paragraph is where I say the stuff about synthetic RNA and DNA and the fact that that's all they would need to use.

39:57.531 --> 40:04.475
And so it's okay to say it's lies as long as it's not lies about the whole story, as long as it's just lies about the shots.

40:10.134 --> 40:11.354
And that's the problem, right?

40:11.394 --> 40:12.995
That's the real big problem.

40:13.755 --> 40:25.339
What I want is that this guy has described it so well, but in a very cursory and brochure-like fashion, not to let you know how many different people like Epigirl would be in the background.

40:26.459 --> 40:28.380
And there were indeed many, many people.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.801
It's not just Epigirl, it's Epigirl and the people that argue with her.

40:33.862 --> 40:37.863
It's the inventor that argues with the Nobel Prize winner.

40:39.949 --> 40:54.216
essentially Weissman and Malone and Cullis and Carriot, whatever her name is, they're all kind of part of this debate and can be from a distance used as lights that oppose each other.

40:55.857 --> 41:01.100
I mean, think about what Dowd has done and not done for us by not telling us that it's murder in 2020 then.

41:03.254 --> 41:13.580
Maybe he's even hiding the murder in 2020, and that's why they have him at this meeting instead of Denny Rancourt, who, although he won't say murder, he has said that something else is going wrong.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.802
It must be the government killing people if there's no spreading thing.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.484
So he's come close to saying it.

41:21.524 --> 41:29.328
Maybe he's just safer than me not writing Denny off at all, because again, that was one of the clues about this group.

41:30.612 --> 41:36.314
was that a month or two earlier, there had been a very similar gathering in Romania of all places.

41:37.274 --> 41:39.735
And Denny Rancourt and Nick Hudson were invited there.

41:39.755 --> 41:59.342
And then when they came back, this person in particular, sorry, these two people in particular, these two people in particular wrote blogs about seeing Denny Rancourt's amazing presentation that said 17 million people were killed by the shot worldwide.

42:00.791 --> 42:06.616
and ignored the part of his presentation where there's no evidence of a spreading risk additive pathogen because it never crossed borders.

42:07.176 --> 42:15.443
And so that's, again, part of this limited spectrum of debate on the internet between people who agree to argue about certain things like early treatment.

42:18.777 --> 42:30.978
argue about certain things like IFR and CFR or whether the calculated CFR or the calculated IFR is what we should be arguing about or determining when and where lockdowns should be applied and ah!

42:33.683 --> 42:47.126
And that's what I really despise about this guy because this guy is one of the fakest of all the fakes because he knew almost everything that I've been teaching for the last four years since 2021 because he was in a private signal chat with me where I was saying all this stuff.

42:47.586 --> 42:49.886
Was I as good at it as I am now?

42:50.066 --> 42:52.427
No, but I was good enough.

42:55.187 --> 43:03.369
And instead he's rising by 30,000 viewers a day and going all around the world touring with all these other

43:04.758 --> 43:11.562
pre-programmed thought leaders that were auditioning for years before the pandemic, of course.

43:11.602 --> 43:23.128
They've been using people like this for years to orchestrate the controlled manipulation of the conscious and intelligent habits and opinions of the masses for decades already.

43:25.478 --> 43:36.811
And so you need to get familiar with these people and the fact that they are almost certainly coordinatedly providing this illusion of consensus that there was likely a lab leak.

43:37.812 --> 43:39.834
And that means there could be one again.

43:43.178 --> 43:45.801
There's no way that this picture can exist.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.181
These pictures can exist.

43:49.201 --> 43:59.564
There's no way that these pictures can exist unless there is a coordinated group of people agreeing to lie about the existence and potential of pandemics.

44:00.345 --> 44:01.965
There's no other way to explain it.

44:03.346 --> 44:12.329
And these pictures include pictures which imply how the narrative was curated and who they used to do it.

44:15.774 --> 44:25.941
I'm being very serious now because I do not want to pull any punches and I don't want anybody to be surprised at the kinds of things that I say when I'm on stage in South Dakota.

44:27.542 --> 44:33.565
There is no other way to explain these photographs existing and many, many more like them.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.246
There's no other way to explain it.

44:37.748 --> 44:39.169
Don't make me frame by frame it.

44:43.490 --> 44:54.399
There is a very lively debate happening right now that I am not involved in and will never be involved in because these people are curating something that I'm not a part of.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.562
And that's why they don't promote me.

44:57.622 --> 45:01.425
That's why they don't humbly admit that, wow, I learned a lot of stuff from that guy.

45:02.947 --> 45:03.927
I mean, a lot of stuff.

45:03.987 --> 45:07.410
Like he really cleared a lot of stuff up for me that I couldn't tie together.

45:07.751 --> 45:08.992
None of them will say that.

45:13.032 --> 45:33.995
now i don't i'm not saying that everybody's got to say that but the people that are are in multiple photographs with me better damn well say that people that credit me as the first expert in their freaking book about wuhan better damn well say that don't you see why that's a problem that there's a rockefeller lady in the row behind me up there in boston

45:35.973 --> 45:44.939
that took John Bodwin out for breakfast with Meryl Nass in Boston the morning before Bobby's little announcement.

45:48.981 --> 45:51.643
John Bodwin's been on my program a couple times.

45:53.644 --> 45:56.386
He knows exactly what the clone theory means.

45:57.486 --> 46:04.388
The only way that he's ignoring me is because Kevin McKernan and Steve Kirsch told him to.

46:04.448 --> 46:08.110
There's no other way to explain it because I don't think John Bodwin's a bad guy.

46:08.870 --> 46:10.591
And there's lots of people like that.

46:13.011 --> 46:20.434
Because there's so many of these people that are willing to lie about one thing in particular and then fight very vigorously about everything else.

46:22.543 --> 46:24.664
I don't think Jimmy Dore is a bad guy either.

46:24.704 --> 46:36.471
I think he knows very well what could happen to him because he's been at Hollywood parties and has friends that have been to Hollywood parties and he knows that wet work does occasionally happen and they call it drugged overdoses.

46:43.136 --> 46:47.058
There's no one else on the internet doing this.

46:48.759 --> 46:50.260
And that doesn't mean I'm crazy.

46:51.465 --> 46:54.626
It means that the gates of the trap are almost shut.

46:57.006 --> 47:03.727
They have control almost over every nozzle and they have control over almost every console.

47:04.468 --> 47:10.389
They have someone planted at almost every station, at every exit.

47:12.429 --> 47:16.810
And they have been planting these people in place for decades.

47:20.086 --> 47:28.910
so that the organized habits and opinions of the masses can be efficiently controlled by simply attributing bad motives to the people who disagree.

47:32.052 --> 47:36.154
Please tell me that there's a better way to say it than I just did, and then I'll say it that way.

47:37.774 --> 47:43.577
But intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is crazy.

47:45.168 --> 48:02.432
and transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent because we understood what it did and didn't do and the many limitations of it because so many hundreds of thousands of academic biologists have used transfection and transformation in their animal models of the systems that they study.

48:02.832 --> 48:13.935
And they know that this does not usefully augment that animal system and they could never have imagined that it could be tweaked in such a way to usefully augment the immune system of their own kids

48:14.435 --> 48:26.339
unless there was an illusion of consensus that was so strong that even a reasonably intelligent and awake person in an academic setting would be unable to escape.

48:26.419 --> 48:28.220
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

48:28.260 --> 48:29.760
That's why that picture exists.

48:30.280 --> 48:35.962
That's why an RNA cannot pandemic.

48:36.002 --> 48:39.784
There are easier ways to say it, and I think you can use those too if you want.

48:41.144 --> 48:43.785
You can use those to, let's watch a movie.

48:45.498 --> 48:46.579
Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot.

48:47.159 --> 48:49.721
Just to let you know, the crack pipe thing actually progressed.

48:50.501 --> 48:56.906
And now we can say that weaponized piles of money have murdered people and gotten Zuby and Dan Wilson to agree about it being a lab leak.

48:56.926 --> 49:02.470
The funny thing is, is that Dan, debunk the funk, decided to say crack pipe.

49:04.551 --> 49:05.151
Isn't that weird?

49:05.171 --> 49:05.672
Are they really?

49:07.978 --> 49:14.243
Are they so coordinated and so weak in their list of ways to attack?

49:14.583 --> 49:15.644
Hey, you know that mouse?

49:16.024 --> 49:18.686
He kind of got Jay to get really angry about the crack pipe.

49:18.766 --> 49:29.294
No, I just kept circling back to the idea that he wanted to make the argument that I attacked him, but all I said was is that all accounts are dangerous if they're anonymous.

49:30.802 --> 49:42.205
And so then his answer to weaponize piles of money of murdered people was to put a crack pipe in my mouth and interestingly debunk the funk, come and defend your claims.

49:43.466 --> 49:44.166
What claims?

49:45.266 --> 49:46.427
I don't need to defend anything.

49:46.487 --> 49:48.247
The whole video is right there for you.

49:48.287 --> 49:49.147
I did it yesterday.

49:49.207 --> 49:50.588
You can watch it yourself, Dan.

49:51.088 --> 49:58.170
The video shows very clearly that you and Zuby are about as deep of thinkers as two four-year-olds in a pool in the sun.

50:01.202 --> 50:01.922
It's pretty funny.

50:03.102 --> 50:07.043
This is really like retarded kids throwing ice cubes at the sun at this point.

50:07.804 --> 50:08.544
That's what this is.

50:09.224 --> 50:11.704
That's what Dan Wilson is doing.

50:11.764 --> 50:14.945
That's what all of these people, these anonymous accounts are.

50:15.385 --> 50:23.387
I don't wanna, sorry, I know some people don't like that word, but it's really, that's really what it is.

50:25.247 --> 50:27.828
It's liars throwing ice cubes at the sun.

50:29.056 --> 50:29.597
How about that?

50:30.277 --> 50:33.721
Witting or unwitting liars throwing ice cubes at the sun.

50:33.761 --> 50:47.235
And not to say that I'm the sun, but it's to do, to say this, you know, asymmetric kind of argument is so pathetic at this stage that all I can do is say that I gotta put the crack pipe down.

50:49.335 --> 50:50.836
And so this is these people, right?

50:50.997 --> 50:58.343
Zuby is a wonderful example of a person who really, really engaged in some meaningful debate on Twitter.

50:58.463 --> 50:59.524
Ooh, was he vigorous.

50:59.664 --> 51:04.849
Oh, he was using so many words that him and Dan Wilson got into a big argument for over a year.

51:04.909 --> 51:07.772
And this podcast discussion has been long overdue.

51:10.083 --> 51:20.012
And Dan Wilson has been fighting tooth and nail since he finally converted from being a conspiracy theorist to understanding that the TV actually does tell the truth.

51:20.692 --> 51:34.004
Which is a very interesting conversion that a surprisingly rare number of people have, where they're like, hey, wait a minute, I used to think that 9-11 was a conspiracy, but now I realize they told us the truth all along.

51:39.025 --> 51:40.785
I mean, it's really comical to me.

51:43.946 --> 51:56.308
And so you can see Zuby and you can see Dan Wilson and you can see Pierre Corey and you can see Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and his wife, who probably doesn't know what her husband is doing.

51:57.268 --> 52:06.170
And so many others like Jessica Rose as being people who really, really, really pretended hard, you know, I'm gonna push this VAERS data out.

52:09.980 --> 52:25.331
And of course, pushing the VAERS data out at the beginning of 2020 or the beginning of 2021, or whenever she started doing it, was also pushing the assumption that the evidence of harm of the old vaccine schedule wasn't there.

52:26.952 --> 52:31.035
And only now with this big spike, do we see a signal we've never seen before.

52:31.715 --> 52:34.177
So it's really like Jessica Rose's primary

52:35.820 --> 52:40.823
object was to come out and make sure that once and for all the books were closed on the old vaccines.

52:41.624 --> 52:46.027
Because she can show a decade of VAERS data that shows almost no signal.

52:46.607 --> 52:49.890
Never mind that the VAERS data has always been bullshit, right?

52:49.950 --> 52:50.910
Never mind that.

52:51.491 --> 52:58.395
Let's look at the fact that if the VAERS data is pretty right, then it looks like we're really in trouble now, but not before.

52:58.775 --> 53:04.960
Don't you see how magical it is once you start to dive into what they were doing in 2020 and really look at it objectively?

53:05.902 --> 53:12.165
And that's exactly why they're selling t-shirts right now that say, the COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

53:15.247 --> 53:17.668
They're still doing the same fake act.

53:22.290 --> 53:34.697
They're still spreading bad ideas on the internet and misleading everyone, but especially the young, because essentially by misleading adults, you end up having them teach it to their kids, which is the worst part about it.

53:36.274 --> 53:37.435
That's why I say it that way.

53:37.535 --> 53:43.299
Gain of function is a mythology that they, these people, want us to teach to our kids.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.541
That's why Bret Weinstein is doing it.

53:46.581 --> 53:48.283
That's why Meryl Nass is doing it.

53:48.323 --> 53:51.545
They want us to teach it to our kids, because then they're enslaved.

53:52.085 --> 53:53.066
And it was by will.

53:54.407 --> 53:55.688
It's not our fault you did it.

54:16.025 --> 54:20.708
And so one of the illusions that they created was, of course, the fall of Minneapolis.

54:21.168 --> 54:24.931
And if you haven't seen this documentary yet, I'm going to

54:25.834 --> 54:27.957
pretty much sit back and just let it play.

54:27.977 --> 54:31.723
I might make faces and I will take some notes.

54:32.444 --> 54:39.655
But I'm going to try very hard not to pause it too often unless I really need to point out how the narrative was sculpted.

54:41.124 --> 54:55.735
And so the point being, of course, that it wasn't just the pandemic and just the existence of a novel virus, but also the ramp up of this multi-gender rainbow ideology.

54:56.736 --> 55:13.135
also the ramp up of racism and unrest and institutional racism or systemic racism and how the system has been rigged against black people for so long that white people just have to like, I don't know, I guess they have to give up everything that they own.

55:15.037 --> 55:21.379
and feel guilty for the rest of their kids' lives because somehow there's this existence of white privilege.

55:21.839 --> 55:23.659
You cannot forget.

55:24.259 --> 55:33.862
You cannot forget that they did that in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 with the use of this rhetoric with Trump and everything else was all part of the same fire.

55:37.483 --> 55:42.484
A friend of mine ended up losing a multimillion dollar company because he tweeted Floyd 19.

55:45.185 --> 55:47.986
This was some serious PSYOP shit.

55:49.986 --> 56:08.592
And if you think only of the pandemic and focus only on these pandemic pseudo heroes and what they're arguing about, it's such a limited spectrum of a debate that you don't realize how the very foundation of our country was shaken to the core by this pandemic.

56:08.652 --> 56:13.593
And it wasn't just the lockdowns and stuff that that's all they wanna talk about.

56:14.864 --> 56:18.165
Can you imagine a patriot not showing this movie?

56:21.126 --> 56:36.911
I just can't believe that not one of these people has ever promoted it as evidence that this national security state would lie to you about anything to create the chaos that they need to demolish American, the American Republic, whatever's left of it.

56:38.371 --> 56:43.213
They need to create enough chaos so that we open the constitution to editing and so that we,

56:44.318 --> 56:45.339
We screw ourselves.

56:47.961 --> 56:56.469
And this movie should be very convincing with regard to, wait a minute, I thought I understood what happened in Minneapolis and with George Floyd.

56:57.170 --> 57:00.413
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I assure you, we still don't know.

57:01.354 --> 57:03.876
We still don't know what happened in Minneapolis for sure.

57:12.878 --> 57:16.782
In the world of trading, timing is everything.

57:16.882 --> 57:23.470
They're called bionic boomers.

57:24.110 --> 57:25.352
I'm sorry, this is my mech.

57:25.652 --> 57:27.274
I hope it won't do this to us too often.

57:45.498 --> 57:50.248
Okay, I can read the chat now a little better in case anybody had something you want me to catch up on again.

57:51.190 --> 57:53.135
Did he do a podcast with Nick Hudson?

57:53.155 --> 57:54.417
Yeah, that's not great.

57:55.259 --> 57:55.921
That's not great.

58:02.759 --> 58:05.740
Pierre Cory was not an expert witness for the Floyd case.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.061
You've got to be crapping me.

58:07.841 --> 58:09.522
You've got to be crapping me, Pamela.

58:10.062 --> 58:11.302
No way, Pamela.

58:11.322 --> 58:13.123
I don't believe you, Pamela.

58:13.143 --> 58:15.324
Oh my gosh, no way.

58:19.826 --> 58:20.826
No way.

58:21.727 --> 58:22.487
Oh my gosh.

58:28.314 --> 58:48.044
okay i'm just gonna let it play like i said unless somebody says pause pause pause pause pause sorry my rodney shirt is bleeding

59:35.087 --> 59:36.479
Holy crap!

01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:45.336
Stop spreading misinformation in my chat, Mark.

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.136
What is going on?

01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:46.276
Okay.

01:00:46.296 --> 01:00:48.858
Yep, yep, just head back in.

01:01:13.564 --> 01:01:18.445
You see your hands?

01:01:39.151 --> 01:01:39.551
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:39.931
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:40.371
I'm sorry.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:40.771
I'm sorry.

01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:41.112
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.192 --> 01:01:41.612
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.672 --> 01:01:41.972
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.992 --> 01:01:42.372
I'm sorry.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:42.712
I'm sorry.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:43.052
I'm sorry.

01:01:43.192 --> 01:01:43.692
I'm sorry.

01:01:43.752 --> 01:01:43.972
I'm sorry.

01:01:44.092 --> 01:01:44.712
I'm sorry.

01:01:44.773 --> 01:01:45.033
I'm sorry.

01:01:45.073 --> 01:01:45.673
I'm sorry.

01:01:45.693 --> 01:01:45.913
I'm sorry.

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:46.213
I'm sorry.

01:01:46.293 --> 01:01:46.773
I'm sorry.

01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:47.733
I'm sorry.

01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:48.033
I'm sorry.

01:01:48.073 --> 01:01:48.293
I'm sorry.

01:01:48.393 --> 01:01:48.834
I'm sorry.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:49.434
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.454 --> 01:01:49.734
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.754 --> 01:01:50.954
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:51.274
I'm sorry.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:51.814
I'm sorry.

01:01:51.914 --> 01:01:52.154
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.234 --> 01:01:52.515
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.535 --> 01:01:52.935
I'm sorry.

01:01:53.575 --> 01:01:53.995
I'm sorry.

01:01:54.015 --> 01:01:54.535
I'm sorry.

01:01:54.635 --> 01:01:55.075
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.115 --> 01:01:55.475
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.495 --> 01:01:55.795
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:56.155
I'm sorry.

01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:56.796
I'm sorry.

01:01:56.836 --> 01:01:57.096
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.116 --> 01:01:57.476
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.496 --> 01:01:57.956
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.976 --> 01:01:58.356
I'm sorry.

01:01:58.416 --> 01:01:58.816
I'm sorry.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:00.217
I'm sorry.

01:02:00.277 --> 01:02:00.597
I'm sorry.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:00.817
I'm sorry.

01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:01.237
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.197 --> 01:02:02.517
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.537 --> 01:02:02.777
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.817 --> 01:02:03.377
I'm sorry.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:03.617
I'm sorry.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:03.997
I'm sorry.

01:02:04.017 --> 01:02:04.258
I'm sorry.

01:02:04.318 --> 01:02:04.638
I'm sorry.

01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:04.978
I'm sorry.

01:02:05.038 --> 01:02:05.458
I'm sorry.

01:02:05.518 --> 01:02:05.818
I'm sorry.

01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:14.055
Back in.

01:02:14.075 --> 01:02:14.596
I'm sorry, Mr. Officer.

01:02:15.076 --> 01:02:15.616
I'm so sorry.

01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:17.618
God dang, man.

01:02:18.658 --> 01:02:21.020
Man, I got shot the same way, Mr. Officer, before.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.382
Okay, well, when I say let me see your hands, you put your fucking hands up.

01:02:24.402 --> 01:02:25.663
Man, I'm so sorry, Mr. Officer.

01:02:26.384 --> 01:02:26.864
You got him?

01:02:26.984 --> 01:02:28.485
Man, dang, man.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.006
Put your hands on top of your head.

01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:32.268
Let me in, Mr. Officer.

01:02:33.909 --> 01:02:35.330
Last time I got shot like that, Mr. Officer.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.330
Hands on top of your head.

01:02:36.891 --> 01:02:37.871
Hands on top of your head.

01:02:40.302 --> 01:02:42.524
Step out of the vehicle and step away from me, all right?

01:02:43.204 --> 01:02:44.205
Step out and face away.

01:02:44.225 --> 01:02:46.427
Step out and face away.

01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:47.608
Please don't shoot me.

01:02:47.688 --> 01:02:48.288
Please, man.

01:02:48.308 --> 01:02:49.149
I'm not going to shoot you.

01:02:49.189 --> 01:02:50.210
Step out and face away.

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.531
I'm going to get out of here, man.

01:02:51.911 --> 01:02:52.932
Please don't shoot me, man.

01:02:52.952 --> 01:02:53.672
I just lost my mom, man.

01:03:05.608 --> 01:03:08.591
Step out and face away.

01:03:08.891 --> 01:03:10.072
Step out and face away.

01:03:10.092 --> 01:03:11.854
Please don't shoot me, Mr. Officer.

01:03:11.874 --> 01:03:13.415
Please don't shoot me, man.

01:03:13.435 --> 01:03:14.136
Step out and face away.

01:03:14.156 --> 01:03:14.876
Can you not shoot me, man?

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:15.497
I'm not shooting you.

01:03:15.517 --> 01:03:16.398
Step out and face away.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:16.618
Okay.

01:03:16.778 --> 01:03:16.958
Okay.

01:03:17.038 --> 01:03:17.319
Okay.

01:03:17.699 --> 01:03:17.999
Please.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:18.980
Please.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:19.821
Please, man.

01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:21.663
He's not really following directions.

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:33.345
I didn't know, man.

01:03:33.405 --> 01:03:36.986
Get out of the car.

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:47.950
I didn't know.

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:48.970
I didn't know.

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:49.730
Stop moving.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.911
Put your hands behind your back, then.

01:03:50.931 --> 01:03:51.771
I'm not going to do nothing.

01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:52.691
Face at the door.

01:03:58.139 --> 01:04:00.081
Hey, you come back, stay in the car.

01:04:06.065 --> 01:04:07.966
I don't think Chauvin is there yet though.

01:04:08.046 --> 01:04:09.747
Chauvin is not either of these guys.

01:04:10.028 --> 01:04:10.768
I don't think so.

01:04:10.788 --> 01:04:13.310
Stop resisting, man.

01:04:15.171 --> 01:04:15.411
See?

01:04:17.693 --> 01:04:19.174
Was the other guy Chauvin or not?

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:20.295
Yes, you are.

01:04:26.956 --> 01:04:27.356
Stand up.

01:04:27.756 --> 01:04:29.036
Please, please, man.

01:04:29.357 --> 01:04:30.657
Stand up for me.

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:31.537
Stand up.

01:04:31.898 --> 01:04:33.158
I don't want to go back there.

01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:40.201
I ain't gonna do nothing wrong, man.

01:04:40.341 --> 01:04:41.081
Come on, walk with me.

01:04:41.141 --> 01:04:42.522
Walk with me.

01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:43.322
Walk with me.

01:04:43.342 --> 01:04:44.323
Come on, please, man.

01:04:45.613 --> 01:04:47.854
Stand up.

01:04:48.034 --> 01:04:49.794
Stand up.

01:04:49.874 --> 01:04:52.055
Come on.

01:04:52.095 --> 01:04:55.935
We're trying to get out of the street here so you don't get hit by a car.

01:04:55.995 --> 01:04:57.216
Yeah, that's not Chauvin.

01:04:57.256 --> 01:04:58.156
That's a bald guy.

01:04:58.176 --> 01:05:02.197
That's not the dude that everybody said was standing by.

01:05:02.217 --> 01:05:03.057
Take a seat.

01:05:03.077 --> 01:05:03.497
Sit down for me.

01:05:03.517 --> 01:05:04.177
Thank you, man.

01:05:04.617 --> 01:05:05.238
Thank you, Mr. Owens.

01:05:05.258 --> 01:05:05.558
Sit down.

01:05:05.618 --> 01:05:07.918
Thank you, man.

01:05:08.618 --> 01:05:09.399
Sit all the way down.

01:05:09.479 --> 01:05:09.839
Yes, sir.

01:05:09.859 --> 01:05:10.379
Yes, sir.

01:05:10.499 --> 01:05:10.859
I will.

01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:14.019
Please, man.

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:15.220
Please.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.160
Please, man.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.340
You got an ID on you?

01:05:18.721 --> 01:05:19.701
I got to get one at home.

01:05:19.821 --> 01:05:21.141
All right, what's your name?

01:05:21.782 --> 01:05:22.262
George.

01:05:22.882 --> 01:05:25.083
Palantir Productions, exactly.

01:05:25.183 --> 01:05:26.543
I don't know what's going on.

01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:27.263
Wow, nice one.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:29.584
Man, that's it.

01:05:29.604 --> 01:05:30.244
Spell it for me.

01:05:31.024 --> 01:05:31.565
G-E-O.

01:05:32.785 --> 01:05:33.005
Yep.

01:05:33.865 --> 01:05:34.726
R-G-E.

01:05:35.426 --> 01:05:35.846
Last name?

01:05:36.226 --> 01:05:36.726
Floyd.

01:05:37.086 --> 01:05:37.827
Hello, man.

01:05:38.127 --> 01:05:38.787
F-L-O-Y-D.

01:05:38.867 --> 01:05:39.247
F-L-O-Y-D?

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:39.487
Yes.

01:05:43.888 --> 01:05:44.369
date of birth.

01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:45.432
October 14

01:05:58.757 --> 01:06:01.559
If you mind doing me a favor, just run this guy over.

01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:02.460
George Floyd.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:03.480
Thank you.

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:09.344
Man, you know why we're here?

01:06:09.824 --> 01:06:13.447
We're here because it sounds like you gave a fake bill to the individuals in there.

01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:14.968
You understand that?

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:17.209
And do you know why we pulled you out of the car?

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:21.452
Because you was not listening to anything we told you.

01:06:21.832 --> 01:06:24.074
You listened to us, and we will tell you what's going on, all right?

01:06:24.094 --> 01:06:27.336
When you're moving around like that, that makes us think way more is going on than we need to know.

01:06:29.677 --> 01:06:30.618
And that's all I have.

01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:31.278
Got you, all right.

01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:33.659
We're going to put you in the back of a squad, all right?

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:34.759
Can I talk to you?

01:06:35.179 --> 01:06:36.840
Yeah, we're going to sort all this out, all right?

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.600
Is that your car key?

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.261
It's my sister's.

01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:42.201
Key fob right there?

01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:42.721
Yes, sir.

01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:44.402
I got one problem.

01:06:44.822 --> 01:06:46.242
Yeah, I'm going to hold on to that for you, all right?

01:06:46.262 --> 01:06:46.563
Stand up.

01:06:50.763 --> 01:06:56.287
Yeah, and look it, you're still able to reach your side.

01:06:56.307 --> 01:06:57.147
You're making me nervous.

01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:58.428
Yeah, I got you.

01:06:58.468 --> 01:06:59.409
We'll fix all that.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:03.571
We'll fix all that, but you've got to walk with me.

01:07:04.872 --> 01:07:05.172
Ouch!

01:07:05.573 --> 01:07:06.033
Ouchie, man!

01:07:06.053 --> 01:07:07.334
Are you on something right now?

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:07.954
No, nothing.

01:07:10.595 --> 01:07:13.358
He's a really big dude to be making that much pain.

01:07:13.438 --> 01:07:15.820
It's kind of like he's like a soccer player that fell down.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.400
Let's go.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.842
Let's go.

01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:19.763
You got foam around your mouth, too?

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:19.843
Yes.

01:07:19.984 --> 01:07:22.506
Yes, I was just moving earlier.

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:23.146
OK.

01:07:24.047 --> 01:07:26.549
All right, let me calm down now.

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.471
It's a little better now.

01:07:28.531 --> 01:07:30.173
OK, you do me one favor, man.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.894
And we're going to talk about that when we get to the car.

01:07:31.954 --> 01:07:33.696
Stop moving around.

01:07:34.957 --> 01:07:35.598
Oh, man.

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:37.015
Oh, man.

01:07:37.736 --> 01:07:38.996
God, don't leave me, man.

01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:40.777
Please, man, don't leave me, man.

01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:43.938
Please, don't leave me, man.

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:44.978
Just unlock the door for me.

01:07:45.098 --> 01:07:46.118
I didn't do anything.

01:07:46.598 --> 01:07:48.019
Hey, stand up.

01:07:48.039 --> 01:07:48.879
Stop falling down.

01:07:48.939 --> 01:07:50.320
I'm about to fall again.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.020
Stand up.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:51.900
I'm about to fall again.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.441
Stay on your feet and face the car door.

01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:53.981
Please, man.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:56.953
I mean, he's a big dude.

01:07:57.254 --> 01:07:58.076
Keep the door open.

01:07:58.096 --> 01:07:58.637
Keep the door open.

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:00.961
I guess the handcuffs could be painful, but.

01:08:00.981 --> 01:08:04.007
Man, you ain't listening to nothing we're saying, so we're not going to listen to nothing you're saying.

01:08:04.027 --> 01:08:04.909
Face the door.

01:08:07.395 --> 01:08:08.196
I mean, he's big.

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:10.297
I hear you, but you are going to face this door right now.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:11.238
I don't do anything.

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:12.179
I don't do anything.

01:08:12.199 --> 01:08:14.120
I don't believe you got anything, man.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.422
I'm not a resistor, man.

01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:17.483
I'm not.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:18.143
I'm not.

01:08:18.203 --> 01:08:19.004
You can ask him.

01:08:19.024 --> 01:08:19.484
He know me.

01:08:19.544 --> 01:08:20.705
He didn't risk himself.

01:08:20.745 --> 01:08:21.626
That's weird.

01:08:21.646 --> 01:08:24.248
Why is this going on like this?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:25.869
Look at my wrist, Mr. Olsen.

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:27.150
I'm not that kind of guy.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:27.690
Sit still.

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.671
I'm not that kind of guy.

01:08:28.691 --> 01:08:28.831
Please.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.332
I'm not that kind of guy, Mr. Olsen.

01:08:30.352 --> 01:08:30.632
Please.

01:08:31.213 --> 01:08:31.453
All right.

01:08:43.595 --> 01:08:45.898
Don't leave me by myself, man, please.

01:08:45.938 --> 01:08:47.080
I'm just claustrophobic.

01:08:47.561 --> 01:08:48.682
That's it.

01:08:51.598 --> 01:08:54.039
Anything sharp on you?

01:08:54.059 --> 01:08:55.380
Do you have anything sharp on you?

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.081
Not even like a comb or nothing?

01:08:57.101 --> 01:08:57.561
Stand up straight.

01:08:57.581 --> 01:08:57.942
You got him?

01:08:57.962 --> 01:08:59.202
Yes, I'll crack it.

01:08:59.222 --> 01:08:59.442
I will.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:08:59.682
I will.

01:08:59.703 --> 01:08:59.923
God, man.

01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:02.144
I didn't know all this was going to happen, man.

01:09:02.164 --> 01:09:02.724
Please, man.

01:09:02.744 --> 01:09:03.965
I just want my hands free.

01:09:22.026 --> 01:09:26.890
I don't want to do nothing to y'all, man.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.571
Nothing.

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:31.533
And I understand that people do stuff.

01:09:32.654 --> 01:09:33.715
And y'all don't know me.

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.637
Take a seat.

01:09:36.717 --> 01:09:37.918
OK, OK, OK, OK.

01:09:37.958 --> 01:09:39.559
Why are you having trouble walking?

01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:40.720
Because that was my hands.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.401
We won't feed you, man.

01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:43.421
Please don't do this.

01:09:43.442 --> 01:09:44.282
Take a seat.

01:09:44.302 --> 01:09:45.103
I'm going in.

01:09:45.163 --> 01:09:45.763
No, you're not.

01:09:45.803 --> 01:09:46.444
Take a seat.

01:09:46.484 --> 01:09:46.984
Take a seat.

01:09:47.044 --> 01:09:47.985
I'm not the kind of guy.

01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:52.650
I'm not that kind of guy, man.

01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:53.251
Take a seat.

01:09:53.311 --> 01:09:54.514
No, I'm gonna die here.

01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:55.375
Take a seat.

01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:56.197
I'm gonna die, man.

01:09:56.237 --> 01:09:57.540
You need to take a seat right now.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.802
And I just had COVID, man.

01:09:58.842 --> 01:09:59.664
I don't want to go back to that.

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:06.011
Hey, I'll roll the windows down.

01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:06.852
Hey, listen.

01:10:06.992 --> 01:10:07.693
Dang, man.

01:10:07.713 --> 01:10:08.113
Listen.

01:10:08.493 --> 01:10:09.694
I'm not looking at a guy.

01:10:09.855 --> 01:10:10.695
I'll roll the windows down.

01:10:10.715 --> 01:10:12.177
Put your legs in, all right?

01:10:12.197 --> 01:10:12.677
I'll put the air on.

01:10:12.717 --> 01:10:13.157
Look at that.

01:10:13.177 --> 01:10:13.558
Look at that.

01:10:13.578 --> 01:10:13.838
Look at that.

01:10:13.858 --> 01:10:14.659
You're not even listening.

01:10:14.679 --> 01:10:15.039
Look at it.

01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:15.459
Look at it.

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:17.621
We can fix it, but not while you're standing in front of me.

01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:18.562
Hey, man.

01:10:18.622 --> 01:10:19.983
God, y'all do me bad, man.

01:10:20.063 --> 01:10:21.425
Man, you didn't win.

01:10:21.465 --> 01:10:22.806
Man, I don't want to try to win.

01:10:22.826 --> 01:10:24.267
I don't want to try to win.

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:25.068
Quit resisting, bro.

01:10:25.168 --> 01:10:25.808
I don't want to win.

01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.969
I'm testophobic.

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:27.670
You ain't going to win.

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.291
I'm testophobic.

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:28.691
I got anxiety.

01:10:28.711 --> 01:10:29.412
I don't want to do nothing.

01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:39.129
You made a mistake.

01:10:39.249 --> 01:10:49.494
Somebody's not going with you.

01:10:49.514 --> 01:10:51.696
When I start breathing, it's going to pop on me, man. 3.39.

01:11:04.049 --> 01:11:04.950
You can't win.

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.150
I'm not trying to win.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:07.231
I'm not trying to win.

01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:08.591
Don't get in the car, man.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.592
Don't get in the car.

01:11:10.972 --> 01:11:11.553
You know it.

01:11:11.933 --> 01:11:12.833
You know it's a result.

01:11:12.873 --> 01:11:13.474
Y'all hear me?

01:11:14.034 --> 01:11:14.914
Don't do me like that, man.

01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:15.615
Get in the car.

01:11:15.695 --> 01:11:16.515
OK, I told you, please.

01:11:16.535 --> 01:11:16.935
Get in this car.

01:11:16.975 --> 01:11:17.716
We can talk.

01:11:17.756 --> 01:11:18.396
I am a testophobic.

01:11:18.556 --> 01:11:19.236
I'm not a phobic man.

01:11:19.296 --> 01:11:21.697
I'm hearing you, but you're not working with me.

01:11:22.998 --> 01:11:23.958
God, I'm claustrophobic, man.

01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:24.578
I'm in the car, man.

01:11:24.618 --> 01:11:25.819
You ain't gonna win, though, whatever you win.

01:11:25.839 --> 01:11:26.239
I'm in the car.

01:11:26.259 --> 01:11:26.959
Can you get me in the front?

01:11:27.299 --> 01:11:27.419
Please.

01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:28.619
No, you're not getting in the front.

01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:29.339
I'm claustrophobic, officer.

01:11:29.359 --> 01:11:30.019
Get in the car.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:30.960
OK, man, OK.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.720
I'm not a bad guy, man.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.380
Get in the car.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.420
I'm not a bad guy.

01:11:34.961 --> 01:11:35.101
Ah!

01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:39.381
Oh, man.

01:11:39.742 --> 01:11:40.302
Please, officer.

01:11:40.602 --> 01:11:40.982
Please.

01:11:41.322 --> 01:11:41.742
Please.

01:11:41.782 --> 01:11:42.322
Take a seat.

01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:42.622
Ah!

01:11:42.942 --> 01:11:43.522
Please, man.

01:11:43.822 --> 01:11:44.262
Please.

01:11:44.623 --> 01:11:45.383
No, I can't.

01:11:45.403 --> 01:11:45.863
Take a seat.

01:11:45.923 --> 01:11:46.203
I can't.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.903
I can't joke.

01:11:48.243 --> 01:11:49.103
I can't breathe, officer.

01:11:49.123 --> 01:11:50.644
I'm sorry if this is disturbing.

01:11:52.765 --> 01:12:00.968
It could very well be that he swallowed some stuff before he got pulled over, that he's paranoid for whatever reason, that he's going to get sicker.

01:12:02.529 --> 01:12:11.272
He is freaking out about being put in the car, which for a person with a previous arrest record seems a little bit strange to me.

01:12:11.392 --> 01:12:12.813
I'm not saying he's lying.

01:12:12.853 --> 01:12:14.974
I'm just saying there are reasons to.

01:12:16.038 --> 01:12:18.259
to relax a little bit.

01:12:18.299 --> 01:12:21.279
He wants to be on the ground.

01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:22.539
He wants to be on the ground.

01:12:22.579 --> 01:12:24.180
Get in the squad.

01:12:46.376 --> 01:13:00.267
So this is, I'm going to go back just a couple seconds because I missed that little pause there.

01:13:01.008 --> 01:13:04.390
This right here is a 2022, October 22, 2023,

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:24.353
He wants you to know that he was the medical expert who testified in his civil case that he did not die of a fentanyl overdose.

01:13:24.373 --> 01:13:28.034
So he was killed by the cop on him, I guess.

01:13:28.294 --> 01:13:35.637
And Pierre Corey is the guy who actually testified to that and actually promotes Tucker Carlson saying that.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.178
You see how cross promotion is the way you see them?

01:13:44.059 --> 01:13:49.241
And do you see how extraordinary it is that when we look backwards and then it's suddenly like, wait, what?

01:13:49.281 --> 01:13:54.722
George Floyd and Pierre Corey and, and Tucker Carlson all line up in a row.

01:13:55.382 --> 01:13:55.743
What?

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:07.086
And then what did they use that to cause the rest of our citizens to do to each other?

01:14:09.164 --> 01:14:13.245
and argue about and what questions were we asking for the next seven or eight months?

01:14:13.345 --> 01:14:15.426
The wrong ones, that's for sure.

01:14:15.946 --> 01:14:18.087
Is it okay to protest with COVID around?

01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:22.828
Get in the squad.

01:14:23.288 --> 01:14:26.589
Yeah, defund the police, exactly.

01:14:50.142 --> 01:14:54.249
I tend to agree that it's probably more for their cameras than anything else.

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:59.157
This guy's been under arrest so many times that you would think it would be a relatively

01:15:00.845 --> 01:15:02.267
well understood encounter.

01:15:02.307 --> 01:15:08.733
And he definitely would understand that the more resistance he puts, I mean, it's just absurd that this is not something else.

01:15:08.793 --> 01:15:09.634
I don't know what it is.

01:15:09.794 --> 01:15:19.143
I don't know who's doing it or why they did it, but it's all part of the same theater that's designed to govern us and our children by a bunch of mythologies that we can never

01:15:20.024 --> 01:15:27.810
ever see through because we have all this illusion of consensus on television and social media about what the relevant questions to ask are.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:33.274
Like, did he die of an overdose or did he actually die of the officer kneeling on his neck?

01:15:33.314 --> 01:15:34.975
Well, Pierre Kory's got the answer.

01:15:35.355 --> 01:15:36.136
Stop lying!

01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:42.060
I'm not COVID, man.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.301
I can't breathe.

01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:49.661
Oh, okay.

01:15:49.681 --> 01:15:52.483
Well, I stand corrected, Freeman Ace, because I'm not a cop.

01:15:52.523 --> 01:15:54.185
I don't know how criminals behave.

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:54.665
That's true.

01:15:54.945 --> 01:15:55.666
Take a seat.

01:15:55.686 --> 01:15:58.568
He's under arrest right now for forgery.

01:16:17.978 --> 01:16:19.559
Well, he has a South Korean name.

01:16:19.599 --> 01:16:20.980
I don't know what's going on.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.841
Or a Korean name, isn't it?

01:16:22.941 --> 01:16:23.541
I don't know.

01:16:23.642 --> 01:16:24.202
South Korean.

01:16:24.222 --> 01:16:24.882
Leave, man.

01:16:25.343 --> 01:16:26.243
I can't fucking breathe.

01:16:26.263 --> 01:16:26.884
Hey, come on out.

01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:27.784
Thank you.

01:16:28.104 --> 01:16:29.645
Thank you.

01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:30.746
On the ground.

01:16:31.106 --> 01:16:33.728
On the ground.

01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:39.331
No, opioids don't make you behave like that, as far as I know.

01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:41.112
Especially not in high quantities.

01:16:41.152 --> 01:16:41.753
Exactly.

01:16:42.013 --> 01:16:43.114
You got your, uh...

01:16:56.473 --> 01:16:59.194
It's interesting because no one did say that he was under arrest.

01:16:59.234 --> 01:17:00.234
I think you're right about that.

01:17:19.076 --> 01:17:20.617
He's already saying I can't breathe.

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:24.338
He can't breathe though because he's saying mama.

01:17:24.358 --> 01:17:27.459
You can't say mama if you can't breathe.

01:17:41.687 --> 01:17:42.868
Yeah, he is saying mama.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:43.308
I don't know.

01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:45.349
I don't, again.

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.850
All right.

01:17:48.611 --> 01:17:50.292
All right.

01:17:51.452 --> 01:17:52.053
Oh my God.

01:17:52.413 --> 01:17:53.694
I can't believe this.

01:17:54.614 --> 01:17:55.255
I can't believe this.

01:17:56.175 --> 01:17:58.556
I can't believe this, man.

01:17:59.397 --> 01:18:00.097
Mama, I love you.

01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:01.638
Rich, I love you.

01:18:01.658 --> 01:18:02.439
You got hobble?

01:18:03.019 --> 01:18:05.480
He's repeating, so he's breathing in when he says words.

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.962
In 2020, George Floyd says, I got shot last time.

01:18:07.982 --> 01:18:09.322
Man, I got shot last time.

01:18:09.342 --> 01:18:10.443
That ain't right, man.

01:18:11.223 --> 01:18:14.865
And you would have been the last officer to arrest George Floyd.

01:18:15.786 --> 01:18:16.386
Did you shoot him?

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:17.847
No, I didn't shoot him.

01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:18.267
No.

01:18:28.134 --> 01:18:29.915
The body camera is out there.

01:18:29.935 --> 01:18:33.617
It shows exactly what I did, exactly what the other officers did.

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:35.058
No, we didn't shoot him.

01:18:35.558 --> 01:18:38.440
How was George Floyd acting during that arrest in 2019?

01:18:40.279 --> 01:18:41.500
Everything was almost identical.

01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:48.727
I mean, the initial stop, when I first started to approach him, you know, he was uncooperative.

01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:50.229
He wasn't listening to my commands.

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:52.551
He was very agitated.

01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:54.473
Just keep your hands up where I can see them.

01:18:56.474 --> 01:18:56.855
Hey.

01:18:57.415 --> 01:18:58.176
Let me.

01:18:58.216 --> 01:19:01.099
Keep your hands where I can see them.

01:19:01.139 --> 01:19:02.400
Let me see your hands.

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:08.103
Stay in the car.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.404
Let me see your other hand.

01:19:09.524 --> 01:19:10.044
I'm sorry.

01:19:10.064 --> 01:19:10.244
I'm sorry.

01:19:10.264 --> 01:19:11.445
Let me see your other hand.

01:19:12.025 --> 01:19:13.166
Both hands.

01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:15.388
Put your fucking hands up right now.

01:19:15.628 --> 01:19:17.949
During the time, I couldn't see his hands.

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:19.070
He was moving around.

01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:20.951
We found out later he was probably eating dope.

01:19:22.152 --> 01:19:22.753
Open your mouth.

01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:23.633
Spit out what you got.

01:19:23.713 --> 01:19:24.734
Spit out what you got.

01:19:43.616 --> 01:19:48.398
I just lost my mom, man.

01:19:48.598 --> 01:19:50.339
Step on the face away.

01:19:50.379 --> 01:19:54.760
Go ahead and undo your seat belt.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.681
Don't shoot me, man.

01:19:56.721 --> 01:19:59.322
Please, I don't want to get shot.

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:01.243
I don't plan on shooting you.

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:03.104
I'm just saying, just take your time.

01:20:03.124 --> 01:20:04.464
Step on the face away.

01:20:04.504 --> 01:20:05.665
OK, if I was a police, don't shoot me.

01:20:05.745 --> 01:20:06.285
Please, man.

01:20:06.345 --> 01:20:07.245
I'm not going to shoot you.

01:20:07.265 --> 01:20:08.346
Step on the face away.

01:20:08.426 --> 01:20:09.846
I'm going to get out of here, man.

01:20:09.986 --> 01:20:10.987
Please don't shoot me, man.

01:20:27.637 --> 01:20:31.560
for five whole excruciating minutes.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.963
For eight minutes and 46 seconds.

01:20:36.483 --> 01:20:35.963
846, 846.

01:20:36.984 --> 01:20:40.306
Now I am gonna pause here because I want you to understand what this is.

01:20:40.406 --> 01:20:49.373
Just like the laugh track on a TV sitcom, this is the illusion of consensus that they created about what happened.

01:20:51.351 --> 01:21:05.041
And how they created it was with an illusion of consensus, an agreement across social media and mainstream media to say certain things so that almost everyone in America had the same basic thoughts.

01:21:05.661 --> 01:21:10.204
And that's a real, real dangerous avenue to walk.

01:21:13.647 --> 01:21:16.389
But if you see how they did it with George,

01:21:18.339 --> 01:21:24.963
then you're gonna see how easily they did it with COVID and still are doing it today.

01:21:28.366 --> 01:21:29.086
Listen to this.

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:32.328
And it's in 46 seconds.

01:21:32.348 --> 01:21:34.129
Nine minutes and 29 seconds.

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:39.773
Nine minutes and 29 seconds, right?

01:21:39.893 --> 01:21:41.454
Actually eight minutes and 46 seconds.

01:22:03.177 --> 01:22:06.439
I can think of a few other cameras that we still haven't seen from yet.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:33.313
Our heart and our solidarity are with folks who understand what happened Monday night to George Floyd.

01:22:34.453 --> 01:22:37.635
The vast majority of people that have come together have been doing so peacefully.

01:22:37.755 --> 01:22:42.537
Peaceful protests overnight in the Twin Cities, several dozen arrests at the state capitol.

01:22:42.638 --> 01:22:45.299
That entire time, they've been very peaceful.

01:22:45.339 --> 01:22:46.960
The crowd continues to be peaceful.

01:22:55.498 --> 01:22:59.401
It started out as a lot of people gathering, which is your first amendment, right?

01:22:59.861 --> 01:23:01.203
But it quickly changed.

01:23:01.903 --> 01:23:03.725
My husband actually left for work before me.

01:23:03.785 --> 01:23:05.306
He works for Minneapolis Police Department.

01:23:05.466 --> 01:23:09.889
And he texted me on the way into work and said, you're going to have a bad day.

01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:13.612
And he was correct.

01:23:18.156 --> 01:23:19.937
The crowds got larger and larger and larger.

01:23:20.237 --> 01:23:21.919
So we knew that we were going to have our hands full.

01:23:25.529 --> 01:23:27.450
Each day, it just compounded.

01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:29.630
By the end of the day, it was probably 1,000 people.

01:23:30.231 --> 01:23:32.331
And then the next day, it was 4,000 people.

01:23:32.671 --> 01:23:45.756
What you should see is this is like a DITRA and DOD experiment, an HHS experiment on how they can use the control of information to get people to do stuff.

01:23:45.796 --> 01:23:50.377
And then they can have private meetings with each other and say, look, here's what we did on Twitter.

01:23:51.417 --> 01:23:52.978
Here's what we did on Facebook.

01:23:53.834 --> 01:23:54.835
How well did it work?

01:23:55.295 --> 01:24:14.754
Well, we tried this out in New York, and we tried this out in LA, and we tried this over here with this group of people, and we got all this stuff working, and for seven months, they were jerking us around with their different strings, and their different narratives, and their different social media bubbles.

01:24:17.423 --> 01:24:24.047
different Lollapalooza of lies or liars where it doesn't matter what stage you go to, you're gonna get the same bullshit.

01:24:28.969 --> 01:24:45.558
Please see how magical it is that we can now use the same kind of insight about the brick walls of the theater or the borders of the hog trap to see that actually the borders of the hog trap are visible within this PSYOP too.

01:24:46.752 --> 01:24:50.336
because we are not just governed by a public health mythology.

01:24:50.756 --> 01:25:02.008
We are governed by a real politic mythology about big countries and big, big nations and world leaders rather than weaponized piles of money.

01:25:06.505 --> 01:25:09.546
And then the day after that, it was like 8,000 to 10,000 people.

01:25:10.426 --> 01:25:19.429
I think it's really important for people to understand that the police that were working the street at that time were dealing with situations that, in my mind, only you could think of as wartime.

01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:21.310
This is like a modern-day war zone.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:24.991
I mean, this is unbelievable what is happening on the streets of Minneapolis.

01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:28.933
So we are seeing someone being wheeled away, someone who looks pretty badly injured.

01:25:29.613 --> 01:25:32.594
They threw a whole bunch of bottles and rocks, and I got hit in my mouth.

01:25:32.834 --> 01:25:34.315
I ended up breaking three more teeth.

01:25:34.575 --> 01:25:35.195
Break that suit!

01:25:37.878 --> 01:25:43.920
We were dodging water bottles, bricks, Roman candles, anything they could get their hands on.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:52.303
It was crazy.

01:25:52.363 --> 01:26:03.266
It was like I was living in a... Does anyone remember that there was this dude who was walking around in all black in Minneapolis and he was like in three different videos where he was kind of initiating the violence?

01:26:04.066 --> 01:26:06.187
This is crazy what you're going to see.

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:08.908
third world country.

01:26:08.928 --> 01:26:10.169
I'm like, what is going on?

01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:12.350
Where do I live right now?

01:26:17.934 --> 01:26:29.600
And this is a thing that bothered me about government officials, is they let people sit back and throw rocks and bricks and firebombs.

01:26:30.541 --> 01:26:34.103
And we're supposed to just put on a helmet and take that.

01:26:37.249 --> 01:26:39.631
We are still taking rocks, frozen water bottles.

01:26:39.871 --> 01:26:41.112
They're shooting mortars at us.

01:26:41.492 --> 01:26:42.333
Can we escalate?

01:26:42.473 --> 01:26:44.054
Frozen water bottles?

01:26:45.835 --> 01:26:48.457
Who in their right mind thinks of that?

01:26:49.458 --> 01:26:56.163
What person is like, I'm going down to stand up for this guy that they just killed, and I'm going to bring a bunch of frozen water bottles?

01:26:57.684 --> 01:26:58.565
Come on, guys.

01:27:02.122 --> 01:27:11.230
There were stacks of bricks in multiple cities.

01:27:11.611 --> 01:27:12.972
I mean, it's crazy, guys.

01:27:13.032 --> 01:27:14.513
It's crazy once you see it.

01:27:18.377 --> 01:27:22.141
When did you realize this wasn't a typical riot response?

01:27:22.941 --> 01:27:26.725
Pretty early on, there was no response at all.

01:27:28.513 --> 01:27:35.299
They didn't say why, but I assumed they didn't want to make us look militant with the rioters.

01:27:36.621 --> 01:27:43.227
I actually had gear, but they were just saying, just wear your helmets and stand there, basically.

01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:49.571
Obviously they didn't take my request for more resources seriously.

01:27:50.352 --> 01:28:00.555
So we were just watching it unfold without less than lethal, without SWAT teams, without riot gear.

01:28:01.095 --> 01:28:02.736
Nobody had protective gear on.

01:28:02.816 --> 01:28:04.196
We were just in our uniforms.

01:28:04.516 --> 01:28:07.177
At this point, they're not giving you permission to wear your riot gear?

01:28:07.437 --> 01:28:07.617
Nope.

01:28:07.957 --> 01:28:10.578
There was no riot gear given to anybody at that point.

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.539
And we're in the middle of a war zone.

01:28:14.426 --> 01:28:15.967
It was just officer after officer.

01:28:16.408 --> 01:28:17.429
Injured, back in.

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.710
Sent him home.

01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:27.318
Injured, I mean it was 30 officers that evening probably that got injured while they were out there trying to deal with the riots.

01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:42.393
We were in a squad car, me and my partner, and we were at Chicago and Lake, and we had an observe and report post, basically.

01:28:42.853 --> 01:28:49.899
So we watched them with our own two eyes break into the T-Mobile store, Foot Locker, Chicago Lake Liquors.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.726
We were given a play-by-play over the radio, and the only sponsor we would get back is just copy, observe, and report.

01:29:00.426 --> 01:29:01.327
We watched them loot.

01:29:01.787 --> 01:29:07.271
We watched- What I think you have to be most afraid of and aware of now is that social media does this.

01:29:08.332 --> 01:29:10.434
Just with social media, they did this.

01:29:11.598 --> 01:29:17.261
The question now is, can we investigate how they did it and to what extent they forced it to happen?

01:29:17.321 --> 01:29:25.745
And maybe even sent messages between people that weren't from those people to make them convinced that we're agreeing that we're gonna go crazy today.

01:29:27.966 --> 01:29:31.168
Just like they made us go crazy in stores and buy toilet paper.

01:29:33.086 --> 01:29:38.010
They have been mocking us with these buttons and with these strings that they can pull.

01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:46.436
And they have been testing whether which strings are the most useful, which types of strings are the most useful to pull.

01:29:46.456 --> 01:29:51.100
I ate the Molotov cocktail and we watched them throw it into the building.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.202
They're starting to throw Molotov cocktails.

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:56.384
We were ordered not to do anything.

01:29:59.807 --> 01:30:06.310
Fire department wasn't responding, and we were trying to put out fires along, and cars were trying to run us off the road.

01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:07.110
We were trying to do that.

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:08.931
All kinds of things were happening to our team.

01:30:09.411 --> 01:30:12.733
And it wasn't just me, but all the strike teams and all the officers during that time.

01:30:13.133 --> 01:30:15.414
The stuff that was going on, you know, shots fired.

01:30:19.136 --> 01:30:21.637
It was completely utter chaos.

01:30:28.371 --> 01:30:34.776
This was just kind of wandering around aimlessly, waiting to be told what not to do next.

01:30:34.816 --> 01:30:35.736
It's a test run.

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:39.419
What they did to Minneapolis, they also did to Portland.

01:30:40.119 --> 01:30:45.343
And I'm becoming more and more convinced that if they wanted to do it almost anywhere, they could.

01:30:45.543 --> 01:30:48.245
And if they wanted to do it everywhere at once, they could.

01:30:49.466 --> 01:30:56.191
And it seems like they're putting more and more people in place so that they can.

01:30:58.806 --> 01:31:09.173
And I think we need to become aware of how we're being set up with regard to the election and the internet and power and resources and food.

01:31:10.454 --> 01:31:14.797
We need to understand it as a crisis right now that we are being set up.

01:31:15.357 --> 01:31:26.125
The trap is almost closed and we need to be able to see our recent history in the correct light so that as many people as possible can use this recent history to wake up

01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:30.322
and to find a way out of the cave that they're in.

01:31:30.922 --> 01:31:32.282
Holy man, are we in trouble.

01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:36.824
I think it's almost one o'clock and I think I have to go to the gym with the boys.

01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:39.705
Just let me check very quick if they're still here.

01:31:40.265 --> 01:31:44.826
And if they are, then I will just be on later this afternoon to finish this movie.

01:31:48.687 --> 01:31:49.768
Yes, they're still here.

01:31:50.628 --> 01:31:52.428
I think they signed up for one o'clock.

01:31:52.508 --> 01:31:54.409
So if you guys don't mind,

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:02.789
Again, check out these articles, if you will, Pierre Khoury's medical musings.

01:32:03.509 --> 01:32:16.237
And also, check out the Everyone Lied, Tucker Carlson, again, read in very early, it looks like to me.

01:32:18.559 --> 01:32:19.559
I'm gonna get rid of this.

01:32:21.142 --> 01:32:25.826
And I'm going to get over here, and I'm going to do this current slide.

01:32:25.886 --> 01:32:28.488
And I'm going to say, yes, I'm still saying the same stuff.

01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:30.449
I'm a big divider.

01:32:30.889 --> 01:32:37.594
I'm a big bad guy, because I think intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:32:37.614 --> 01:32:40.797
I think transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent.

01:32:40.817 --> 01:32:47.962
And I think thousands and thousands of biologists and doctors around the world are still got a lot of awakening to do.

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:56.468
And RNA cannot pandemic is another thing that our children are going to, if I have anything to say about, grow up understanding and be able to teach to their children.

01:32:57.108 --> 01:32:58.709
There are other ways to say this stuff.

01:32:58.729 --> 01:33:00.791
So if you don't like those, you can say it simply.

01:33:01.651 --> 01:33:07.535
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfection in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:33:08.856 --> 01:33:09.717
And yeah.

01:33:11.178 --> 01:33:16.943
This has been GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:33:16.963 --> 01:33:23.970
You can find this work at screen.gigaom.bio and you can find a way to support the work at gigaombiological.com.

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:27.012
Thank you very much everybody.

01:33:27.033 --> 01:33:31.637
I will update the subscriber list today, either before or after this last

01:33:33.416 --> 01:33:34.720
Monday we'll have an updated list.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:40.315
Thank you, thank you, thank you guys very, very much for being here and I'll see you again after basketball.

01:35:00.979 --> 01:35:04.245
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:35:04.986 --> 01:35:06.388
Stop lying!
