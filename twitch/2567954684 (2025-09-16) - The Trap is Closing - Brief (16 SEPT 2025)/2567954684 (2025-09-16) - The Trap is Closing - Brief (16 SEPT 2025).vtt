WEBVTT

00:14.180 --> 00:15.625
Stop lying!

01:30.062 --> 01:30.184
you

02:16.197 --> 02:17.177
There are no ethics.

02:17.217 --> 02:19.938
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

02:21.218 --> 02:26.179
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

02:31.246 --> 02:33.888
What will we do with this moment?

02:35.450 --> 02:37.532
How will we be remembered?

02:39.213 --> 02:42.256
Look at the opportunities before us.

02:44.558 --> 02:47.741
This election really isn't about the left versus the right.

02:48.481 --> 02:55.508
It's about we the people choosing our government and the choice between freedom versus tyranny.

02:58.439 --> 03:01.340
Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have.

03:02.221 --> 03:05.002
Why are we allowing this to happen to our children?

03:05.922 --> 03:13.385
Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.

03:15.286 --> 03:19.108
What is going on here is deeper than politics.

03:19.716 --> 03:21.339
It is deeply spiritual.

03:22.300 --> 03:28.009
We are being called to rise above the hatred and the fear and the evil.

03:29.454 --> 03:37.456
We need to remember above and beyond that we must love our neighbors, that we must treat other people as we hope to be treated.

03:38.036 --> 03:38.896
You want to be a rebel?

03:39.336 --> 03:40.137
You want to be a hippie?

03:40.477 --> 03:41.797
You want to stick it to the man?

03:42.397 --> 03:45.538
Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative.

03:45.778 --> 03:46.258
Stop lying!

03:46.298 --> 03:49.399
America is going to reach heights that it has never seen before.

03:49.419 --> 03:52.800
The future is going to be amazing!

03:53.620 --> 03:53.960
Stop!

03:58.931 --> 04:01.151
Don't you want healthy children?

04:02.192 --> 04:10.793
Don't you want a president that's gonna make America healthy again?

04:12.034 --> 04:15.274
I come to you today as a former Democrat.

04:15.614 --> 04:18.435
I will be a first-time Trump voter tonight.

04:20.455 --> 04:21.236
Stop lying!

04:41.257 --> 04:49.999
The people dreamed this country and it's the people who are making America great again.

04:54.501 --> 05:00.182
Stop lying.

05:00.222 --> 05:05.844
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:07.674 --> 05:08.396
And I have lied.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.438
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.379
I don't want to lie.

05:10.399 --> 05:12.223
I don't think I'm a liar.

05:12.343 --> 05:13.365
I try not to be a liar.

05:13.405 --> 05:14.246
I don't want to be a liar.

05:14.828 --> 05:17.533
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

05:55.971 --> 05:59.473
I guess I would ask myself, like, I mean, I lie.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.214
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

06:02.234 --> 06:04.215
I really try not to.

06:04.235 --> 06:06.196
I try never to lie on TV.

06:06.256 --> 06:07.956
I just don't, you know, I don't like lying.

06:08.096 --> 06:11.158
I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.

06:21.724 --> 06:27.131
Generally speaking, I don't lie out of weakness.

06:27.691 --> 06:36.902
I try to make a habit of not lying, and that's not apparently what Tucker Carlson and the like do.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.831
I would suggest to you that this is what a national security theater for dummies looks like.

06:43.911 --> 06:47.212
That's the reason why the anti-RFK Jr.

06:47.292 --> 06:52.593
tour actually features Corey and Kirsch.

06:53.673 --> 06:57.794
And they allowed themselves to be put on a poster like that.

06:58.034 --> 07:01.875
Because this was a national security theater.

07:02.035 --> 07:03.335
It was a trap.

07:06.690 --> 07:20.618
And if you don't start to see that this was an international social media based trap with international actors that chose their glasses, or even worse, someone chose their glasses for them.

07:22.299 --> 07:26.382
That's why all the ladies wear Craig, Claire Craig glasses nowadays.

07:27.589 --> 07:29.730
Oh, look, there's some more Claire Craig glasses.

07:30.170 --> 07:36.053
Look, that guy's glasses are surprisingly similar to these two guys' glasses.

07:36.694 --> 07:39.055
Wow, that is so bizarre.

07:39.115 --> 07:42.817
It's almost like it's a national security theater.

07:44.557 --> 07:44.838
Yeah.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.439
Yeah, Sam Harris is a neuroscientist.

07:51.724 --> 07:56.227
And so the Trump administration is destroying our democracy, is what one side believes.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.589
The other side believes that God sent us Trump.

07:59.690 --> 08:17.264
And right smack dab in the middle are people from the national security state working for the DOE since he dropped out of college, working for the Whitehead Institute, started by David Baltimore, recently dead, about to be the subject of a multi-week

08:18.373 --> 08:21.656
biology lesson, courtesy of yours truly.

08:22.737 --> 08:29.743
David Baltimore was one of the craziest scripted actors that I've come to understand as such recently.

08:29.763 --> 08:41.794
And I'm very excited that there's enough video of him to use thoroughly, to use thoroughly to show you how governance by scripted actors has actually been pulled off.

08:42.785 --> 08:50.809
from the ivory tower of academia all the way to the DOD, the DOE, and the top secret DARPA stuff that they do.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.231
It's all, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

08:54.872 --> 09:09.800
All the way to surfers from Hawaii put on a script, a resume built, and Bob's your uncle, ladies and gentlemen, and Bob is your uncle, and that's the way it works, right?

09:09.860 --> 09:11.361
I mean, that's just the way it works.

09:13.703 --> 09:14.864
This woman is not real.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.446
This man is not real.

09:16.486 --> 09:20.169
And he might even believe he's real, but he's surrounded by people who are not.

09:20.990 --> 09:25.574
I suspect he's probably the best example of what a Truman show would be.

09:26.656 --> 09:32.982
You surround a guy long enough with people on a script, and he will believe the script and actually believe that he's taking part in it.

09:34.202 --> 09:36.304
Um, crazy, crazy times.

09:37.485 --> 09:40.227
You and your children are trapped in a national security theater.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.249
You gotta get off social media if you want to escape.

09:43.989 --> 09:44.870
That's the reality.

09:44.930 --> 09:45.991
It's not gonna feel good.

09:46.872 --> 09:49.033
Ripping the Band-Aid off is not gonna feel good.

09:49.073 --> 09:51.735
But fortunately, I've got an alternative for you.

09:52.536 --> 09:55.378
I've got an alternative for where you can put your content.

09:55.438 --> 10:01.562
I've got an alternative for how we can build that network of trusted people.

10:02.563 --> 10:04.807
that I'd like to call the intellectual dark web.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.250
Sorry, the intellectual bright web.

10:07.331 --> 10:09.594
I'm sorry, the independent bright web.

10:09.614 --> 10:12.398
You see, it's all a semantic game.

10:13.991 --> 10:21.414
And our acquiescence to their semantic game played on their playing field on social media is what's going to make us lose.

10:21.434 --> 10:33.118
That's why I'm trying to lead the way or help to set the example of building our own social media, our own network of content providers.

10:34.431 --> 10:37.915
You know, we just build websites and put videos on them.

10:37.955 --> 10:47.927
It's not that hard, especially because there is this open-source software like Peertube, open-source software like Soapbox that can be used to do it.

10:48.047 --> 10:51.111
Actually, that's what Truth Social is, and that's what Blue Sky is.

10:52.032 --> 10:59.115
So we are not that dissimilar to some of the more cutting-edge ways that a federated network can be built.

10:59.855 --> 11:02.336
And in fact, I think we're helping to do that.

11:03.717 --> 11:06.078
And the next steps are right around the corner.

11:08.017 --> 11:08.657
Here you see it.

11:09.618 --> 11:12.499
The independent bright web includes Housatonic Live.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.041
And it is a way to make America real again.

11:17.081 --> 11:19.222
It's a way to make the web real again.

11:19.242 --> 11:20.722
An independent bright web.

11:20.762 --> 11:22.163
I really like it a lot.

11:23.524 --> 11:25.084
I think truth is good for kids.

11:25.524 --> 11:29.266
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.036
We want everybody to feel good.

11:32.376 --> 11:33.817
That's not the way life is.

11:34.077 --> 11:36.558
That is definitely not the way life is.

11:36.618 --> 11:38.819
Thank you very much for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.560
I'm happy to be here.

11:40.680 --> 11:46.443
I will see you in a... Yeah, of course, we've got to do the intro.

11:52.365 --> 11:55.587
Sometimes I dream That he is me

11:56.960 --> 12:00.002
You got to see that's how I dream to be.

12:01.322 --> 12:02.783
I dream, I move.

12:02.963 --> 12:03.423
I move.

12:03.904 --> 12:05.044
I dream, I groove.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.185
Like Mike.

12:06.305 --> 12:08.406
If I could be like Mike.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.407
Oh, if I could be like Mike.

12:10.467 --> 12:10.847
Like Mike.

12:10.927 --> 12:12.588
If I could be like Mike.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.871
If I could be like Mike.

12:18.351 --> 12:19.492
Be like Mike.

12:19.612 --> 12:20.052
Be like Mike.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.053
Yeah, I try.

12:22.190 --> 12:24.591
Just need to fly.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.272
Just wonder if I could be that way.

12:28.613 --> 12:29.873
I dream I move.

12:30.194 --> 12:32.615
I dream I groove.

12:33.135 --> 12:33.675
Like Mike.

12:33.975 --> 12:35.856
If I could be like Mike.

12:35.936 --> 12:39.398
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be like Mike.

12:39.598 --> 12:40.158
Like Mike.

12:40.198 --> 12:41.799
If I could be like Mike.

12:41.879 --> 12:42.919
Be like Mike.

12:43.059 --> 12:43.559
Like Mike.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.420
If I could be like Mike.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.541
What time is it?

12:46.621 --> 12:47.181
Daytime.

12:52.978 --> 12:54.819
I am really excited to be here.

12:57.159 --> 12:57.859
It's Tuesday.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.620
It's a nice day.

12:58.660 --> 12:59.660
The back door is open.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.441
The fresh air is blowing through the garage.

13:02.861 --> 13:06.042
And intramuscular injection is definitely still dumb.

13:06.142 --> 13:07.782
RNA still can't pandemic.

13:08.263 --> 13:10.083
Transfection is still a crime.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.424
And autism is still a myth at Giga Home Biological.

13:13.444 --> 13:16.005
I'm very happy to be here as part of the independent bright web.

13:17.385 --> 13:18.626
Thank you very much for being here.

13:18.706 --> 13:20.007
Thank you for using PeerTube.

13:21.588 --> 13:24.809
Getting off of social media is the only non-compliance that matters.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.550
It is a warning to your children.

13:27.470 --> 13:32.353
One of the best ways to move forward will be to learn the biology that supports this statement.

13:32.813 --> 13:43.636
that autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

13:44.136 --> 13:54.960
And in fact, in order to reinforce this mythology, to protect these ideas, they have also wielded the pandemic and gain of function as myths.

13:55.600 --> 14:07.564
which have confused people about virology and public health and intramuscular injection and led us down this path where for some reason we still can't figure out why everything was free.

14:08.704 --> 14:17.647
The masks were free, the closures were free, the iPads were free, you know, the supplementary oxygen was free.

14:19.207 --> 14:23.890
The shots were free, the remdesivir was free, all the protocols were free.

14:24.890 --> 14:32.274
It's just really weird why we can't seem to figure out why the cheese is free as a signal for what not to be, where not to be, what not to do.

14:32.835 --> 14:35.196
But I do think the way out is biology.

14:35.896 --> 14:39.458
And I do think that GigaOM Biological is the biology they ignore.

14:39.518 --> 14:44.121
Not is the, the, the biology they ignore, but just is the biology they ignore.

14:45.161 --> 14:47.062
That typo has been up there for a while now.

14:47.922 --> 14:50.003
I keep getting that wrong for some reason.

14:50.143 --> 14:53.344
I guess it's because my eyes don't see it.

14:54.224 --> 14:57.405
Or I pulled the old slide out again from an old deck.

14:58.805 --> 14:59.505
Something like that.

14:59.586 --> 15:03.407
Please, ladies and gentlemen, show your children why the cheese is free on social media.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.367
Explain it to them.

15:04.967 --> 15:06.888
Because they're using Discord right now.

15:07.088 --> 15:10.489
Your teenagers are using Discord to communicate.

15:11.169 --> 15:25.292
And so while you're running the rat race going back and forth from Netflix to work to Netflix to work, your kids are on Discord and what is that stupid roadblocks thing.

15:25.352 --> 15:28.393
And so, you know, that's what fifth generation warfare is.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.473
That's what you really need to be afraid of.

15:31.113 --> 15:32.894
And I do think we're all in on this one.

15:32.914 --> 15:33.934
We're all in it together.

15:34.954 --> 15:53.628
It's not just the people that took the the bait for the health freedom movement Although that is me and that is a lot of people that took that bait you might have seen through a lot of these Organizations and still believed that in general they were just trying to latch on to something that at its heart was good But that's what you thought

15:54.469 --> 16:12.103
you would be wrong because actually they were all there by design and it's not it's not a fun message it's not a message for everybody but it is a message for anyone anyone that's ready to hear it RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injections is a dumb idea from the late 1800s

16:13.564 --> 16:35.080
transfection is a crime and population pyramids are definitely real that's why they saw this thing coming and so we've been using social media incorrectly thinking that social media is some kind of interactive sitcom where we can make Ross and uh what was her name i don't know the other lady on that show friends they we could make them fall in love if we just texted the right thing and that's just ridiculous

16:35.620 --> 16:46.484
just the same as it would be if you thought that you could text Captain Kirk and Captain Kirk would change the plot or their tactics against the Romulans.

16:46.564 --> 16:48.344
So, welcome to the show.

16:48.865 --> 16:50.245
This is GigaOM Biological.

16:50.405 --> 16:53.786
I am broadcasting to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:53.806 --> 16:55.267
I'm going to plug PeerTube again.

16:56.327 --> 16:59.248
Just to be repeated, this is the way out.

16:59.448 --> 17:00.928
Please download the app.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.749
Use PeerTube app because it does work really well on your phone.

17:03.769 --> 17:05.150
It's even better than my website.

17:05.530 --> 17:06.730
This is for all the marbles.

17:06.810 --> 17:11.912
This is for the grandchildren of Earth and that's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

17:11.952 --> 17:14.332
I think I can pop myself in down here.

17:14.372 --> 17:15.173
Good to see everybody.

17:17.409 --> 17:20.291
Intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea.

17:21.371 --> 17:30.156
Transfection is what they should have called it from the very beginning because it's actually an old technology that they're renaming more or less to reopen the IP window.

17:31.317 --> 17:46.706
And a lot of the people that are involved with this narrative are also intellectual property experts that have likely at one time or another or ongoing are taking advantage of that knowledge, having invested in things that have inevitably gone up because of the

17:47.219 --> 17:50.182
the wild speculation and talk regarding the pandemic.

17:50.663 --> 18:05.198
And so of course they've played these silly videos where the donut salesman Ralph Baric is talking about how to profit from a pandemic, but they don't talk about how somebody from Goldman Sachs like Steve Bannon would be profiting from the pandemic or

18:05.838 --> 18:20.031
or even orchestrating the pandemic, even though he had somebody like Li Min Yan, and he was on stage with her, hugging her in January of 2020, talking about a lab leak and talking about getting her in the New York Senate, for goodness sakes.

18:21.693 --> 18:30.961
And now that guy is supposed to be some kind of political influencer on the right in America, whatever the right is like, this is the kind of absurdity that we are

18:33.499 --> 18:49.637
we are just believing in because we scroll through social media and read this stuff, and it seems like a lot of people agree that there is a health freedom movement, or a conservative movement, or a populist right movement, or a Christian conservative movement, or whatever the hell they call it.

18:50.098 --> 18:50.818
And there isn't.

18:52.981 --> 18:54.843
It only exists on social media.

18:56.656 --> 19:01.320
just in the same way that the gay community only exists on social media.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.843
There's no gay community in Bethel Park.

19:04.883 --> 19:06.064
There's just Bethel Park.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.728
And that's the real trick here.

19:11.669 --> 19:22.499
If everybody on social media agrees that RNA can definitely pandemic, and we call that a coronavirus, well then it's pretty hard for the average Joe to argue.

19:24.625 --> 19:46.141
It's pretty hard for the average Joe that has been just taking their word for it his whole life or the average, you know, Jane on the street who's been just taking their word for it her whole life to suddenly decide that, wait, I've got to figure out which of this is bullshit and which of it isn't so I can make some principled judgments about what to do with my family's future.

19:47.562 --> 19:52.186
I mean, that's not happening and social media is definitely not helping that to happen.

19:53.416 --> 20:03.463
Social media, there are no influencers on social media that are trying to teach our children how to safely navigate social media because of the fact that there are only actors.

20:05.824 --> 20:15.210
Actors who believe in pandemics, actors who think that the COVID shots are a vaccine, actors that think vaccine is a useful word.

20:17.732 --> 20:19.013
I mean, autism.

20:19.881 --> 20:23.944
describing something that we need to find the cure for or the cause of.

20:28.508 --> 20:33.612
It's going to seem like I'm repeating a lot of stuff, but actually that's all we've got now, ladies and gentlemen.

20:33.712 --> 20:42.439
And I've been saying this for years already, but when you are this over the target, the only thing you can do is hover.

20:44.947 --> 20:52.310
And at this stage, I feel like we're locked in right over the top of it, not moving a centimeter either way anymore.

20:52.390 --> 20:58.893
Because the bottom line is, is that they knew that something was coming since I graduated from high school.

21:00.234 --> 21:03.555
And they have been orchestrating the response to it.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.477
They have been orchestrating the use of this signal.

21:10.703 --> 21:30.788
And the use of this signal was to sort of demolish the United States, to demolish the nation state on earth, and to roll in a global governance system that would be capable of effectively taking control of the evolution of the species.

21:31.229 --> 21:39.851
And of course, there are all these incremental things that need to be added in, computer infrastructures that needed to be imagined and built.

21:42.697 --> 21:46.558
machine learning strategies that needed to be tested on smaller scales.

21:50.359 --> 22:10.085
And so now that we understand how to do it on those smaller scales, now we can build an infrastructure that's large enough and fast enough in order to provide the necessary data access for a machine learning algorithm to tackle a thing like the analysis of the heredity of a vertebrate.

22:12.352 --> 22:29.675
And so you can't possibly imagine that the reason why we're building these networks and we're building all of these storage facilities is so that we can have bigger videos and we can have them at faster frame rates or that we can play games at faster frame rates with more people.

22:33.692 --> 22:40.216
That's just a very, very convenient excuse for the development of all of these technologies.

22:40.256 --> 22:56.525
And you're told that there's all this dual-use technology and virology, but nobody seems to be able to see the dual-use technology right in front of their faces with regard to computers and cameras and data and computation.

22:59.126 --> 23:00.107
They saw this coming.

23:02.130 --> 23:12.239
And they have been telling us stories in our movies and our TVs about the solution that they would offer, the orchestrated theater that they would present.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.340
And then they did it.

23:14.581 --> 23:18.445
And it would be as simple as saying that, Oh, the green thing is a red thing.

23:18.505 --> 23:21.648
And the red thing is new, even though the green thing was there all the time.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.974
The illusion is as simple as a cartoon with five colors.

23:31.041 --> 23:45.933
but the irreducible complexity is not displayable on any modern, you know, it is remarkable where we are, ladies and gentlemen, because the window is closing.

23:45.993 --> 23:53.179
I can't stress this enough, that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

23:53.239 --> 23:54.680
They saw this coming.

23:56.778 --> 23:59.079
And they are using this signal against us.

23:59.139 --> 24:00.719
They have used it against us.

24:00.779 --> 24:11.302
They used manslaughter, murder, and lies to create a brief appearance of a crisis on this background.

24:15.424 --> 24:17.484
And so that's why this line is not level.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.725
That's why that doesn't look that impressive.

24:19.785 --> 24:24.987
That's why they have to take it away from all cause mortality and show it to you independently.

24:25.027 --> 24:26.187
And then it looks really bad.

24:27.145 --> 24:36.281
But if they show you pneumonia in the bright red, you'll just realize that, wow, what we had under control for decades, we lost control of for about two years.

24:36.341 --> 24:36.862
That's odd.

24:38.496 --> 24:40.637
And that's the murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

24:40.677 --> 24:46.661
That's why it's so easy and why it's so important for somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:46.842 --> 24:59.610
to, for example, never ever get the numbers from the opioid crisis correct, that none of these people can get the opioid crisis numbers correct, because that would mean that this chart would be a problem then.

25:02.898 --> 25:11.026
Because with the loss of control of pneumonia that you see here in red, plus the opioid numbers, what is there left to explain?

25:12.727 --> 25:17.351
Imagine if the opioid numbers laid over this just perfectly like the green.

25:19.854 --> 25:21.715
Imagine if the math was that simple.

25:23.817 --> 25:26.720
And now imagine that there's no one doing that math.

25:33.137 --> 25:44.479
And so I think we've been fooled by a very elaborate national security theater, which was orchestrated over a couple decades in anticipation of that signal in the population pyramid that I just showed you.

25:46.400 --> 26:02.303
In anticipation of that signal in the population pyramid, which was exacerbated crazier, much crazier in other Western nations with smaller populations without this big base in Scotland, et cetera.

26:04.690 --> 26:30.818
And so that was the pandemic and this window where we can use the fraudulent nature of the Trump administration, the fraudulent nature of the Biden administration, the fraudulent nature of the biology of the pandemic to discredit this 20 or 30 year long exercise in orchestrated mythology, we can break it for everyone.

26:32.042 --> 26:52.533
The trouble is, is that we're very, very close to the vast majority of Americans accepting the mythology that he's an idiot, that Trump's an idiot, that they put a lot of American kids in danger by questioning the vaccine schedule, and that the COVID vaccine is one of the most successful scientific endeavors ever.

26:53.133 --> 26:57.656
And that if Donald Trump wasn't such an idiot, he would have gotten a Nobel Prize for it already.

27:00.217 --> 27:01.118
And that's the trap.

27:02.332 --> 27:05.255
That's the trap they've always had us aimed at.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.558
That's the reason why this clown show exists.

27:08.618 --> 27:26.674
That's the reason why Alex Jones exists, because just like it seemed preposterous that anybody was gonna vote for Harris and whoever she was running with, or would vote for Biden again, just like it was so ridiculous.

27:30.698 --> 27:37.742
that a lot of people decided, well, I mean, you know, it's the lesser of two evils.

27:39.363 --> 27:43.346
But now the lesser of two evils, of course, is Donald Trump and these guys.

27:43.966 --> 27:48.849
And it's an easier choice, which means it will be a more violent move in that direction.

27:50.390 --> 27:55.093
And so even though it feels like right now, Charlie Kirk and everybody's getting really fired up about this.

27:55.193 --> 27:57.094
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:59.642 --> 28:02.204
It's nothing close to what they might be setting us up for.

28:02.244 --> 28:11.169
And if we're not very careful, um, it could be very, very ugly because again, on social media, you're not aware that we've been fooled by these people.

28:11.489 --> 28:25.417
There've been many times in the 25 years I've been in TV where I think, you know, are we using this like very substantial power that we have to put pictures on the screen to hurt weak people?

28:26.217 --> 28:27.238
And I have done that.

28:27.839 --> 28:32.182
inadvertently over the years because I got carried away, but I really try not to say.

28:32.622 --> 28:46.532
There have been many times in the 25 years I've been in TV where I think, are we using this very substantial power that we have to put pictures on the screen to hurt weak people?

28:47.312 --> 28:53.336
And I have done that inadvertently over the years because I got carried away, but I really try not to say.

28:53.776 --> 28:57.359
There have been many times in the 25 years I've been in TV where I think,

28:58.191 --> 29:07.662
You know, are we using this very substantial power that we have to put pictures on the screen to hurt weak people?

29:08.463 --> 29:12.588
And I have done that inadvertently over the years because I got carried away.

29:12.848 --> 29:14.450
But I really try not to say.

29:14.890 --> 29:18.134
There have been many times in the 25 years I've been in TV where I

29:18.843 --> 29:21.285
I apologize, I just got a text that I had to read.

29:22.806 --> 29:36.237
He's having a lot of these moments lately caught on camera where he's extremely clear about the fact that he lies, that he understands how television and social media could be used to lie.

29:37.257 --> 29:39.819
And you saw the video that I played in the beginning of the show.

29:40.920 --> 29:44.083
These people are, it's disgusting.

29:45.037 --> 29:52.319
If you see that music video now and listen to them talking about the election, it is just disturbing.

29:54.899 --> 30:04.082
Before the election, we had, we had Tulsi Gabbard telling us that she knew, you know, how the deep state worked and who was running the deep state.

30:04.122 --> 30:08.123
And now she's the director of the, of national intelligent, I guess, director of net.

30:08.203 --> 30:09.643
I don't even know what that means.

30:11.220 --> 30:16.124
It's obviously not as powerful as Chief of Staff, otherwise we would hear a lot less of her, right?

30:16.164 --> 30:27.254
I mean, it is so bizarre, but if you fell for this, or if some of your family and friends fell for this, either side of it, right, you fell for it.

30:27.394 --> 30:28.435
Welcome to 2025.

30:29.135 --> 30:32.818
If you think that guy's good or she's good, then you fell for it too.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.602
If you hate Trump,

30:37.583 --> 30:39.525
Or you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:39.585 --> 30:42.467
is a victim of a brain worm, you also fell for it.

30:42.527 --> 30:43.388
That's the thing.

30:44.308 --> 30:50.634
You're just going to be the kind of person that really pushes it hard the other direction when it's time.

30:51.654 --> 30:58.500
Just like some of us were the people that got to be pushing it in that direction when the choice was Harris or Trump.

31:02.748 --> 31:03.749
So you gotta see it.

31:03.809 --> 31:13.755
We have been walked into this trap as a country and now we are being shaken up in a very specific way with the idea of us, you know, like a judo throw works.

31:14.724 --> 31:19.366
Where in judo, like you push somebody and you get them to push back on you.

31:19.426 --> 31:24.669
And when they push back on you is when you, I mean, I'm not a judo guy, but I know it's sometimes done that way.

31:24.709 --> 31:34.853
I've seen videos where it sure seems to be done that way, where, you know, you're, you're trying to feel the force of the other person and then get out of the way and use it against them a lot of times.

31:35.714 --> 31:38.315
And quite frankly, I think that's what these people did.

31:40.779 --> 32:05.849
This health freedom movement was set up and put in place to take whatever conservative people in America were vulnerable to it, were critically thinking enough to question the narrative of the pandemic to create this vortex of black hole of shit where they found all these people

32:08.618 --> 32:12.040
and got lost in it, because that's what social media does.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.180
It makes you feel like you're solving a mystery.

32:14.200 --> 32:20.663
It makes you feel like you're talking to people because they give you a thumbs up, or they give you a like, or they retweet.

32:22.224 --> 32:31.028
And this has all been militarized to make it feel like you're interacting with the soap opera, where you're interacting with the Starfleet officers, but you're not.

32:34.514 --> 32:37.516
And if anybody understands it, it's guys like him.

32:37.596 --> 32:38.337
It's Rogan.

32:38.437 --> 32:40.978
It's all these people that know that's what they do.

32:41.019 --> 32:42.700
They are scripted actors.

32:44.841 --> 32:46.642
Jimmy Kimmel's a scripted actor.

32:46.722 --> 32:48.764
Stephen Colbert is a scripted actor.

32:50.825 --> 32:53.967
The crazy thing is, is Jay Bhattacharya is a scripted actor.

32:55.128 --> 32:56.749
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:56.769 --> 32:57.750
is a scripted actor.

32:59.554 --> 33:01.915
I'm afraid Thomas Massey is a scripted actor.

33:01.935 --> 33:05.097
I'm afraid all of these people are scripted actors.

33:05.257 --> 33:11.000
They are national security actors that have been paid to not question the script.

33:11.380 --> 33:20.445
How else can you explain it that these people have allowed themselves to be put on a poster that says the anti-RFK tour?

33:24.307 --> 33:28.929
Unless these people are as part of a setup to humiliate

33:33.238 --> 33:35.371
anyone on the conservative side in America.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.605
And so I played these guys before.

33:42.545 --> 33:44.606
I think we are being ruled by podcast.

33:44.686 --> 33:50.208
I think podcast actors and the scripts that they are on are how we are being ruled.

33:50.268 --> 33:56.431
And there are some really nasty ones that have been deployed on us in the conservative side.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.072
But there are many, many of these people on the left.

33:59.152 --> 34:01.193
It's just that on the left, it's easier.

34:01.313 --> 34:03.393
It's the TV narrative.

34:03.473 --> 34:04.774
It's the easy narrative.

34:08.396 --> 34:09.697
and it's gonna swing back.

34:10.437 --> 34:11.458
This is an illusion.

34:11.518 --> 34:12.898
The truth is not getting out.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.580
We are in trouble as a country.

34:19.021 --> 34:22.983
And so I think these people are need-to-know basis scripted actors.

34:23.063 --> 34:31.888
I think actually, I would go so far as to say, I think that Charlie Kirk was a need-to-know basis scripted actor.

34:33.410 --> 34:43.794
Now I'm not gonna make any statements about what happened, but I can assure you that he was not shot by somebody behind him or to the left of him or somebody in the crowd with a gun that looks like an iPhone.

34:45.014 --> 34:52.477
Because if a nine millimeter bullet goes off unsilenced next to you, you're gonna know that.

34:53.197 --> 34:55.558
And everybody around you is gonna know that.

34:57.098 --> 35:02.280
It doesn't matter how loud the PA system was or what was being said at the time.

35:04.631 --> 35:08.853
Nobody in that crowd reacts as though a gun went off in the front row.

35:09.693 --> 35:14.535
None of the security guys react as if a gun went off to their right or to their left.

35:17.236 --> 35:28.061
And so there are a lot of videos going around and a lot of nonsense going around, but the only thing you really need to understand is that they are need-to-know basis scripted actors.

35:28.541 --> 35:33.703
If they are part of a national security exercise, essentially they know that they are on a battlefield.

35:36.277 --> 35:39.859
They know it could be part of the script, that they have to leave the stage.

35:39.939 --> 35:43.361
How they leave the stage, I have no idea, because I'm not one of them.

35:44.502 --> 35:47.384
Would they take people off the stage with live bullets?

35:47.984 --> 35:56.809
My guess is yes, especially innocent bystanders like the guy or multiple people that were killed in Butler, Pennsylvania.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.651
I'm sure that they would take innocent bystanders out.

36:00.111 --> 36:02.312
Would they take actors out with bullets?

36:02.472 --> 36:02.973
I don't know.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.498
My guess is, sure, why not?

36:06.279 --> 36:09.724
Especially if those actors were no longer following the script.

36:10.646 --> 36:20.400
But I think the temptation is going to be for you to jump to conclusions about who is running and adjusting the script.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.780
Who is running the stage?

36:24.101 --> 36:25.682
You know, who's pulling the ropes?

36:26.302 --> 36:27.663
Who's changing the scenery?

36:28.184 --> 36:42.214
That is a hard question to ask, but since they are national security actors, I think you can safely assume that who's ever doing that is essentially attached to the national security state who's ever doing this.

36:42.955 --> 36:43.855
Is it the DOD?

36:44.156 --> 36:44.436
Maybe.

36:45.123 --> 36:46.946
Department of Energy, DITRA.

36:47.066 --> 36:47.447
I don't know.

36:47.567 --> 36:48.769
I don't know who does this stuff.

36:48.809 --> 36:49.910
I'm not an expert in that.

36:50.531 --> 36:52.394
I know that they're lying about biology.

36:52.414 --> 36:55.799
I know they're lying about who these people are on the internet.

36:56.140 --> 37:00.366
I know they're lying about the Human Genome Project and what has been accomplished.

37:02.401 --> 37:10.128
And I think that's all tied up in this one little ball of crap that also includes, you know, chronic fatigue syndrome.

37:10.248 --> 37:11.689
It also includes AIDS.

37:12.170 --> 37:16.213
It also includes cancer and the cancer biology.

37:16.253 --> 37:18.876
And it also includes the pandemic.

37:21.718 --> 37:22.559
It's all one thing.

37:22.999 --> 37:38.249
And it includes 9-11 as Mark Kulak, Housatonic ITS, has so eloquently shown that there was this huge momentum and interest in bioterrorism with none other than Senator Joe Biden the day before 9-11.

37:38.989 --> 37:47.175
And there is no reason to... This is all one show.

37:48.621 --> 37:57.109
I haven't been more confident of this conclusion in all the years that I've been doing this, and it's been a long time now, six years.

37:58.750 --> 38:07.178
But this is an elaborate theater that has been intricately planned and rehearsed, and they've even done test runs of it, you know.

38:08.777 --> 38:17.740
And these test runs have never had the acquiescence to social media that we have had since 2020.

38:18.841 --> 38:21.922
We never used social media like this.

38:23.363 --> 38:26.564
Before 2020, we didn't use social media like this.

38:26.644 --> 38:27.944
Make no mistake about it.

38:29.805 --> 38:31.225
We didn't watch shorts.

38:32.886 --> 38:34.867
We didn't binge watch Netflix.

38:37.225 --> 38:46.011
Something has drastically changed in the way that we communicate with one another, in the way that we assess our political and socioeconomic realities.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.734
And it's not that long ago.

38:50.034 --> 38:51.555
We can still remember it.

38:54.858 --> 39:02.383
You kids that are lucky enough to have gone through high school during the pandemic, you can remember it and remember it well.

39:03.684 --> 39:06.706
Remember it well enough so that you can tell your children about it.

39:09.386 --> 39:23.257
Remind them of why we went back to it Need to know basis actors Trump doesn't need to know that he was gonna be shot at that day He needs to know the script if he is shot at That's it.

39:23.757 --> 39:25.979
It's a need-to-know basis script.

39:26.499 --> 39:34.405
It's some improvisation mostly about what not to say and Just you know, don't ask questions

39:38.598 --> 39:42.539
And it may be that Charlie Kirk's wife is just not asking questions.

39:42.579 --> 39:46.441
She's just doing what she's told, posting what she's told to post.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.942
Maybe she doesn't even know what they're posting.

39:52.003 --> 39:54.164
But ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.

39:54.484 --> 40:00.186
I don't care if he said a lot of nice things on camera.

40:00.286 --> 40:03.347
I don't care if he said a lot of bad things on camera.

40:05.051 --> 40:13.376
What I care about is that he had a $150 million organization to be places to say things.

40:13.897 --> 40:18.900
And that doesn't happen in America unless it serves these people.

40:23.663 --> 40:24.303
It just doesn't.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.486
I don't know what to say.

40:29.747 --> 40:32.789
If you believe what you say about him,

40:35.427 --> 40:37.590
then you gotta act on how you believe.

40:37.830 --> 40:40.193
And I think that's what's wrong with the show right now.

40:40.253 --> 40:48.144
There are people who say they believe really tragic and important things, but then they do nothing.

40:49.826 --> 40:53.671
And their actions do not suggest that they actually believe that.

40:55.908 --> 41:06.077
If you believe your child is in danger of going, you know, it's dangerous to send your kid to a public school, but then you do nothing about it, then what does it really mean?

41:08.078 --> 41:14.584
If you think it's, it's dangerous to smoke cigarettes, but you smoke two packs a day, what does it really mean?

41:18.507 --> 41:21.870
And so I want you to ask the question, if you really believe

41:24.241 --> 41:27.902
that politics is a theater, what does it really mean?

41:28.082 --> 41:30.822
It means that Donald Trump is a fake.

41:30.902 --> 41:33.463
It means that Tulsi Gabbard is a fake.

41:33.543 --> 41:36.123
It means that Joe Rogan is a complete fake.

41:36.183 --> 41:38.324
It means that Peter Thiel is a fake.

41:38.784 --> 41:41.424
It means that Elon Musk is a fake person.

41:42.084 --> 41:49.646
It means that Jeff Bezos didn't invent anything to do with some kind of algorithm or distribution idea.

41:51.929 --> 42:05.938
It doesn't mean that Elon Musk is a master of deep tunneling engineering, and also rocket engineering, and also time travel, and electric cars, and also brain implants.

42:08.180 --> 42:09.480
It means it's a theater.

42:10.821 --> 42:14.784
And the more absurd the theater is, apparently, the easier it is for us to believe.

42:16.005 --> 42:19.227
Joe Rogan has such a great podcast that he makes $100 million a year.

42:23.564 --> 42:24.966
Peter Thiel is a genius.

42:25.426 --> 42:26.808
Stop lying!

42:27.409 --> 42:29.972
You know, Elon Musk builds things.

42:30.292 --> 42:31.073
Stop lying!

42:32.015 --> 42:33.877
And Jeff Bezos is a genius.

42:34.438 --> 42:34.818
Stop lying!

42:35.736 --> 42:38.097
And, and, and Robert Malone.

42:38.137 --> 42:43.700
He's a really good guy for 20 years and, and, and running.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.001
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:46.061 --> 42:58.827
He's also just a good guy trying to do his best to, you know, he's been praying for 20 years to be put in a position to stop the childhood chronic disease epidemic.

42:58.907 --> 43:03.089
And now I guess Donald Trump is the answer to his prayers.

43:06.414 --> 43:07.574
I'm pretty cynical right now.

43:07.634 --> 43:09.435
I don't like it, but that's the way it is.

43:09.695 --> 43:13.736
These people are lying and they have put these people in place to lie to us.

43:14.317 --> 43:15.697
And I want you to hear how bad it is.

43:15.757 --> 43:21.799
It feels like because of the design of our lives and the optimization of it, we're increasingly laddering up to just ourselves.

43:22.805 --> 43:44.960
even in my life I'm wondering now why is it why is it important to show this guy well because he's the example of how social media is used against us he is a government national security actor he was funded a rich guy but then what he was funded

43:45.816 --> 43:47.337
He's got an English accent.

43:47.437 --> 43:49.197
That's why he's used on Americans.

43:49.758 --> 43:57.681
He has 50 employees behind this diary of a CEO podcast, 50 employees.

44:00.402 --> 44:03.063
That's militarization of social media.

44:03.103 --> 44:05.064
That's not capitalism.

44:06.530 --> 44:08.871
That's not making a lot of money on views.

44:08.931 --> 44:15.574
That's not, you know, it's because he's got a staff of 50 that he's able to really get his views high enough to make it profitable.

44:15.995 --> 44:21.697
And you're just going to need to invest in your channel enough, you know, and pay some people to get some views or whatever.

44:21.797 --> 44:22.178
I don't know.

44:22.678 --> 44:24.139
This is just stupid.

44:25.879 --> 44:27.520
Now in this same conversation, uh,

44:29.417 --> 44:40.206
The other gentleman at the table is going to invite him to his house to pray in the weekend, which means I guess these guys live in the same town, which I think is Austin, Texas.

44:42.368 --> 44:52.557
Where Joe Rogan is, where Elon Musk is, where the University of Austin is with the wonderful Barry Weiss.

44:55.686 --> 45:10.250
Where all these podcasters are, it's one little media show that sucked a lot of conservative, populist, Christians, people that, you know, were skeptical of the whole lockdown narrative, didn't want to wear masks.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.530
They were all sucked in here.

45:13.931 --> 45:15.911
And this guy's connected to Peter Thiel.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.592
He's connected to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:19.713 --> 45:21.193
via his father.

45:22.608 --> 45:28.531
who is the foremost arbitrator of intellectual property law in biotechnology in America.

45:30.072 --> 45:33.173
One of the biggest funders of the Los Angeles Orchestra.

45:35.174 --> 45:36.155
Les Weinstein.

45:37.055 --> 45:46.820
Les Weinstein was appointed to the Department of Justice during the time of Estes Kefauver, the guy who died three weeks before Robert F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr.

45:46.860 --> 45:47.280
was killed.

45:48.467 --> 45:49.908
He died on the floor of the Senate.

45:49.948 --> 45:52.630
Nobody really cares about him, but I think he was a pretty good guy.

45:52.690 --> 46:07.120
I think there's a lot of history there that gets unsaid on purpose, but he had to do with trying to make the FDA a little better and oversaw a lot of that along with Les Weinstein.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.861
Yes, the father of the guy here at the table.

46:10.439 --> 46:14.104
Oh yeah, Alex Jones, he's in Austin too, isn't he?

46:14.124 --> 46:15.165
Do you pray?

46:21.072 --> 46:22.852
Hmm, it's a good question.

46:23.253 --> 46:23.613
Do you pray?

46:23.653 --> 46:25.233
You come over Friday night and pray with us.

46:25.413 --> 46:27.134
You come over Friday night and pray with us.

46:27.154 --> 46:27.534
I'd say I do pray.

46:28.294 --> 46:28.914
That's pretty weak.

46:29.074 --> 46:32.515
But it's not the way that I see prayer in movies and stuff.

46:33.215 --> 46:34.435
So that's the thing, right?

46:34.495 --> 46:38.176
We have this idea that somebody puts their hands together and they just believe.

46:38.737 --> 46:38.937
Yeah.

46:39.197 --> 46:40.877
A lot of time when you're praying, you don't really believe.

46:40.897 --> 46:42.998
You're not sure that you're doing anything sensible.

46:43.018 --> 46:44.098
You feel ridiculous.

46:44.978 --> 46:46.459
And that's true even if you're a believer.

46:47.119 --> 46:48.079
Think about that.

46:50.387 --> 46:51.908
Think about what he's saying there.

46:52.429 --> 46:53.090
That's true.

46:53.290 --> 46:56.973
Even if you're a believer, but I'm not a believer, but how can he know that then?

46:59.676 --> 47:01.938
But he purports to say that he knows it.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.420
Do you pray?

47:04.460 --> 47:07.743
You're going to come over and pray with us, but he doesn't believe in God.

47:07.843 --> 47:09.005
So who's he praying to?

47:09.065 --> 47:10.246
What is praying doing?

47:10.326 --> 47:11.307
Is it meditation?

47:11.387 --> 47:12.708
Is it saying shit out loud?

47:13.289 --> 47:14.470
Do you see what this is?

47:18.160 --> 47:23.282
This is exactly the same shit that we have with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:23.342 --> 47:25.563
saying that he prays for 30 minutes a day.

47:25.583 --> 47:30.145
And the answer to his prayers is Donald Trump.

47:30.185 --> 47:39.028
It's the same thing we have with Sherry Tenpenny saying that she heard a voice after she cried out to the Lord.

47:39.108 --> 47:41.369
Why do you, why did you give this to me to do?

47:41.409 --> 47:42.930
Why didn't you give me Tony Robbins?

47:43.030 --> 47:43.710
Rah, rah.

47:45.351 --> 47:46.071
She heard a voice.

47:48.530 --> 47:56.298
And that's why she's been working on vaccines for 25 years and still hasn't really come to any firm conclusions as to how to explain her objections about it.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.982
The same as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., curious enough.

48:02.125 --> 48:07.010
And so what you have here is a group of people who have agreed to screw us over.

48:08.703 --> 48:29.051
have agreed to confuse the American public and the curious American public, the skeptical American public, the Christian American public, they have volunteered to screw us over on behalf of these billionaires that would rather not have the American system around anymore.

48:29.844 --> 48:36.729
These billionaires that would rather not have the American electorate have anything to do with anything anymore.

48:37.890 --> 48:43.254
Why should we have to pander to them is probably what Peter Thiel and Alex Karp say a lot together.

48:43.974 --> 48:49.058
Can't we just spray them all with carfentanil from a drone?

48:53.441 --> 48:54.442
Do you think we need religion?

48:55.563 --> 48:58.165
Yeah, said the atheist.

48:59.087 --> 48:59.647
Are you an atheist?

48:59.667 --> 48:59.888
Yeah.

49:02.109 --> 49:02.550
Yeah, yeah.

49:03.070 --> 49:04.831
But I take religion super seriously.

49:06.332 --> 49:07.813
I don't lament to live with it.

49:07.973 --> 49:09.034
Is he doing a skit?

49:09.935 --> 49:11.416
And that's true even if you're a believer.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.078
Do you think we need religion?

49:15.481 --> 49:16.422
in movies and stuff.

49:17.122 --> 49:18.043
So that's the thing, right?

49:18.383 --> 49:22.065
We have this idea that somebody puts their hands together and they just believe.

49:22.626 --> 49:22.826
Yeah.

49:23.006 --> 49:24.787
But a lot of time when you're praying, you don't really believe.

49:25.407 --> 49:26.888
You're not sure that you're doing anything sensibly.

49:26.908 --> 49:28.009
You feel ridiculous.

49:28.869 --> 49:30.350
And that's true even if you're a believer.

49:32.051 --> 49:33.072
Do you think we need religion?

49:34.193 --> 49:36.834
Yeah, said the atheist.

49:37.735 --> 49:38.275
Are you an atheist?

49:38.315 --> 49:43.479
I mean, what is most obvious here is the tremendous size of his ego.

49:44.403 --> 49:56.085
He's so sure he's right about everything that he knows, that he's very comfortable saying that there is no God, but he prays anyway, because essentially he's looking in the mirror while he does it.

49:58.086 --> 50:01.646
Of course, he's the smartest person in the room, in every room that he's in.

50:03.847 --> 50:05.627
And so you can see it already, right?

50:06.467 --> 50:09.068
This is the kind of person that we are dealing with.

50:09.128 --> 50:10.308
This is the kind of person

50:11.007 --> 50:15.069
that would participate in the writing of Man and His Future.

50:15.109 --> 50:22.813
This is the kind of person that thinks that, you know, a lot of people just aren't smart enough to understand what we have to do next.

50:24.854 --> 50:29.716
A lot of people don't have this view of a multi-generational future.

50:29.756 --> 50:33.938
You know, where you work together with your kids to plant trees for the grandkids.

50:34.959 --> 50:39.521
Where you have a common vision of your future that extends beyond those kids' kids.

50:40.925 --> 50:43.791
That used to be the way that people thought all the time.

50:45.214 --> 50:49.001
And now social media has been used to erase that notion.

50:50.014 --> 50:57.779
has been used to separate generation from generation so that our parents aren't working with us the way they should be.

50:57.859 --> 51:01.061
And we are not working with our kids the way we should be.

51:01.661 --> 51:11.187
And we need to change that now while everybody is still alive and while we can still look to the future and decide to work together with our children.

51:13.168 --> 51:16.570
There are some old people we don't, we're not going to really have to worry about them anymore.

51:18.001 --> 51:27.227
It's honestly, I don't know that it's important for people that have children to look backwards to their parents anymore.

51:28.408 --> 51:35.973
I think it's more important for us to look forward to our children and make sure that our children and ourselves are on the same page about this.

51:38.195 --> 51:45.400
On the same page about the recent American history that has converted us to social media monkeys, to screen junkies,

51:47.503 --> 51:50.824
We need to be honest about that right now while we still can.

51:52.605 --> 52:03.268
I have a child who's about to turn 16 and he needs to be completely immune to and off of corporate social media by the time he's 18.

52:03.828 --> 52:04.868
He's not on it right now.

52:06.009 --> 52:12.071
All the discord groups that he's on, as far as I can tell, only contain invited members, which are his friends at school.

52:12.111 --> 52:13.351
There's only one, two groups.

52:14.271 --> 52:16.492
And then there's a basketball chat group and that's it.

52:19.625 --> 52:23.028
And that's the children, that's the generation we need to raise.

52:23.748 --> 52:25.990
But they're doing other things.

52:26.030 --> 52:33.016
They're wasting time in other ways and they're not investing in their own future because they don't see what's coming.

52:33.056 --> 52:34.037
They can't see it.

52:34.077 --> 52:35.638
There's no vision of our own.

52:40.202 --> 52:40.462
Yeah.

52:43.605 --> 52:45.386
But I take religion super seriously.

52:46.888 --> 52:48.589
I don't think we're meant to live without it.

52:51.363 --> 52:53.305
That's an interesting conundrum.

52:53.886 --> 52:54.506
I don't think so.

52:54.566 --> 52:55.828
Everybody gets hung up on it.

52:55.868 --> 52:57.790
I sort of wonder what their problem is.

52:58.070 --> 52:58.610
Please explain.

52:58.650 --> 53:06.538
So you believe that we aren't meant to live without religion, we're meant to be orientated by something transcendent, but you don't believe that it's real?

53:12.037 --> 53:18.362
I mean, it's important for somebody to sit across the table from him and say, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

53:18.382 --> 53:20.163
You better explain it better than that.

53:20.664 --> 53:22.625
It's not a profound statement.

53:22.745 --> 53:24.366
It's a stupid statement.

53:24.406 --> 53:34.034
Let's play it again and make sure you realize that the script here is that the CEO guy is not really going to say anything like, oh, that's a curious conundrum.

53:34.974 --> 53:36.435
That's not a curious conundrum.

53:36.475 --> 53:41.697
It's a stupid contradictory statement that doesn't make any sense without clarification, which he can't provide.

53:41.717 --> 53:42.697
Great trick that I learned.

53:45.038 --> 53:46.039
Do you think we need religion?

53:47.179 --> 53:49.820
Yeah, said the atheist.

53:50.740 --> 53:51.501
Are you an atheist?

53:52.501 --> 53:52.741
Yeah.

53:54.682 --> 53:56.463
But I take religion super seriously.

53:57.963 --> 53:59.644
I don't think we're meant to live without it.

54:01.942 --> 54:09.747
So what I think he's hinting at here is the idea that these elite see religion as a way of governing us.

54:10.827 --> 54:27.177
And that now these elite are trying to come up with a plan B kind of religion that will, you know, some kind of new age Jesus or something that will incorporate the idea that we have to take control of the evolution of the species.

54:27.257 --> 54:28.898
God gave us this knowledge, right?

54:31.494 --> 54:38.139
So it would be a very, it would be a abdication of our responsibility if we wouldn't use this knowledge.

54:38.199 --> 54:42.062
That's, and you know, not everybody can understand it.

54:42.142 --> 54:43.843
Not everybody's as sophisticated.

54:43.943 --> 54:51.809
So, you know, there's just, you know, we're not meant to live without religion is a very weak statement without clarification.

54:51.929 --> 54:52.490
Oh my gosh.

54:53.070 --> 54:57.854
I think everything that Eric Weinstein says is weak because it has no clarification.

54:58.991 --> 55:00.952
That's an interesting conundrum.

55:01.512 --> 55:02.113
I don't think so.

55:02.193 --> 55:03.433
Everybody gets hung up on it.

55:03.493 --> 55:05.414
I sort of wonder what their problem is.

55:05.694 --> 55:06.235
Please explain.

55:06.255 --> 55:09.536
So you believe that we aren't meant to live without religion.

55:09.556 --> 55:14.199
We're meant to be orientated by something transcendent, but you don't believe that it's real.

55:14.219 --> 55:26.185
I think that... You know, there's this great trick that I learned when I was scuba diving, which is that your need to breathe

55:27.321 --> 55:29.864
is triggered by the buildup of CO2 in your lungs.

55:30.144 --> 55:35.069
So I think this story that he's telling is as stupid as him playing blues on the guitar.

55:36.131 --> 55:39.674
And if you don't know how blues is played on the guitar, blues is easy.

55:41.296 --> 55:42.337
It's not very hard.

55:42.397 --> 55:44.500
If you learn the scales, blues is easy.

55:44.640 --> 55:45.601
There's no wrong notes.

55:46.962 --> 55:48.324
And he's, you know,

55:49.895 --> 55:53.397
I'm not saying that he can't play piano or he can't play guitar or whatever he does.

55:53.457 --> 55:56.019
I'm just saying that it's the same kind of shtick here.

55:56.059 --> 56:02.162
You know, it's spreading the butter too thin and representing yourself as something that you're not.

56:02.543 --> 56:07.386
And this is annoying because, you know, scuba diving, come on, come on.

56:07.726 --> 56:11.128
And there are all sorts of things you can do to decrease your need to breathe.

56:11.388 --> 56:15.751
One is you can hyperventilate and you can get rid of all of the CO2 that's residual.

56:16.647 --> 56:17.848
You can also inure your lungs.

56:17.908 --> 56:24.495
And then you can pass out because, you know, hyperventilating and then holding your breath and swimming is a great way to drown in a swimming pool.

56:24.516 --> 56:26.037
But okay, go ahead, tell me more.

56:26.197 --> 56:28.159
Lungs to CO2 by smoking.

56:28.985 --> 56:33.268
You can also breathe out the precious air that your instincts tell you to hold in.

56:33.669 --> 56:36.051
You can do all these things and then you can go super deep.

56:36.071 --> 56:36.771
You can equalize.

56:36.811 --> 56:44.177
Did he just say that you can use smoking to go super deep because it trains your lungs to deal with carbon dioxide?

56:44.217 --> 56:45.878
That's quite remarkable statement.

56:46.138 --> 56:50.602
Learn how to equalize the pressure in your ears by holding your nose and these techniques.

56:51.483 --> 56:54.085
And suddenly you're far deeper than you've ever been.

56:54.365 --> 56:57.948
And you're exploring the rocks and the fishes and there's a turtle and there's an eel.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.059
And you get a message, you're out of air.

57:03.241 --> 57:06.124
And you look up and you see, I am really far from the surface.

57:06.164 --> 57:07.125
This is terrifying.

57:08.188 --> 57:10.050
That's what happens when you unhook.

57:10.710 --> 57:13.512
I'm wondering whether he's ever been in that situation.

57:13.592 --> 57:15.394
My guess is he has not.

57:15.834 --> 57:16.535
Stop lying!

57:16.915 --> 57:18.256
I'm just going to say that right now.

57:18.296 --> 57:34.990
I don't think, and this guy actually ought to understand, if he's actually a scuba diver, then he ought to understand the absurdity of giving somebody 60 liters of minutes of pure oxygen in a hospital for a few hours.

57:35.770 --> 57:36.091
Stop!

57:37.251 --> 57:50.237
I mean, if he's a scuba diver and he knows all about going really deep, then he also knows about, you know, decompression tables and he knows about, you know, the tank composition, how much nitrogen has to be in there and that kind of stuff.

57:50.697 --> 57:53.138
And he knows that you don't put pure oxygen in there.

57:53.158 --> 57:58.320
So why in the world would pure oxygen be given to people if they came into the hospital in 2020, 21 or 22?

57:58.420 --> 57:59.421
I mean, come on, this is a joke to me.

58:05.509 --> 58:06.470
But that's what it is.

58:06.750 --> 58:07.791
It's a joke on us.

58:08.851 --> 58:13.755
And we need to wake up and understand that it was a joke on us.

58:15.096 --> 58:17.297
And we need to get out of this trap right now.

58:17.978 --> 58:23.202
And we need to get everybody else out of the other part of the trap as well, because the left is also trapped.

58:23.962 --> 58:29.046
The proximate, which is air hunger, from the ultimate, which is the need to breathe,

58:30.666 --> 58:32.986
So thirst is proximate to dehydration.

58:33.067 --> 58:37.007
Hunger is proximate to the need for nourishment.

58:38.348 --> 58:49.230
In part, religion and prayer is there to keep us from unhooking all of these protective things and just turning life into a hoot.

58:50.490 --> 58:54.931
You can have a hoot without religion, but if everybody has a hoot, the whole society collapses.

58:58.097 --> 59:03.983
At some point, I think a president of the United States may have said that people who defend this country were suckers.

59:05.445 --> 59:06.065
Something like that.

59:07.587 --> 59:08.948
And I thought, God damn you.

59:10.069 --> 59:11.150
Maybe it's true, even.

59:12.872 --> 59:21.521
But how many families have received a flag-draped coffin and felt pride?

59:22.875 --> 59:27.858
Like we lost something precious, but we are part of the American tapestry in a way that few families can be.

59:28.999 --> 59:42.168
And when we outsmart ourselves, when we unhook all of these things, you know, every single young woman has an idea about what the opportunity cost of not going on OnlyFans is.

59:42.869 --> 59:48.493
Only if she's on social media as a young person, that's it.

59:49.429 --> 59:55.831
I don't think there are very many high schoolers at my kids' high school, the same high school where Matthew Crooks went.

59:57.312 --> 01:00:08.856
I don't think there are very many high school seniors or juniors or sophomores thinking about whether or not they should finally, you know, go on OnlyFans and see if they can make a million dollars.

01:00:08.976 --> 01:00:09.936
I really don't.

01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:21.650
And I think that this story is part of a larger illustration of what they are trying to do, but you can see it in any flip part of this.

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:30.637
You can go to the view, you can go to PBS news, you can go to your favorite podcasts, and they will be pushing the idea that the internet is inevitable.

01:00:31.097 --> 01:00:35.141
The internet does stuff to us and that most people

01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:52.166
And the reality is, is that if you got off of that stuff on your phone, you got rid of Instagram, you got rid of Tik Tok, you got rid of YouTube and you didn't watch it or you didn't log into it so it could keep track.

01:00:52.606 --> 01:00:55.267
And you, you know, even then I think it would be awful.

01:00:55.307 --> 01:01:02.971
Like you just got off of these things, especially the ones where you text people and argue with people.

01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:06.353
Cause those are the dumbest get off of signal.

01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:09.960
Get off of Telegram.

01:01:11.982 --> 01:01:18.128
Get out of any group of people on your phone that is more than two that are not in your family.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:26.856
I mean, this kind of stuff is really, really disturbingly bad at this point.

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:31.160
We just need to get it all away because he's not saying it.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.622
Only fans is social media.

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:39.800
And so it'd be very simple to explain this as social media is awful.

01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:53.431
Even if all the algorithms were altruistically designed and optimized to make everybody as happy as possible, there would be the possibility of using them the other way.

01:01:53.971 --> 01:02:00.056
And therefore, the whole thing is dumb because it's never real.

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:10.842
If the algorithm was optimized to make everybody happy, it would be just as awful as it is now, where it's designed to split everybody into as many groups as possible.

01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:18.869
And that splitting then to argue that you have to choose one of two, because splitting is bad.

01:02:26.295 --> 01:02:29.218
Before we didn't know what the opportunity cost, there was no measurement of it.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.665
We're becoming too sophisticated.

01:02:32.705 --> 01:02:34.086
We've got too much information.

01:02:34.707 --> 01:02:36.088
We're deranging ourselves.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:37.309
We're having a blast.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:41.011
We're not having any fun on social media.

01:02:42.653 --> 01:02:44.834
And we don't have too much information.

01:02:45.175 --> 01:02:46.355
We imagine that we do.

01:02:48.717 --> 01:02:52.140
And we're completely undoing all of the superstructure of the world.

01:02:53.961 --> 01:02:56.183
Undoing the superstructure of the world.

01:02:56.223 --> 01:02:59.905
The undoing of the superstructure of the world was already apparent in the 90s.

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:06.145
We already knew that the superstructure of the world, which is the population pyramids...

01:03:07.557 --> 01:03:15.743
were being undermined by an effort to curb family size and curb population growth.

01:03:15.803 --> 01:03:25.369
And that meant necessarily that there would be some pain, structural pain to go through as our population dynamics changed.

01:03:25.449 --> 01:03:29.652
And people have known this for decades and they have planned for it for decades.

01:03:30.233 --> 01:03:32.614
And it's very possible that he works for some of them.

01:03:32.694 --> 01:03:33.595
It's very possible.

01:03:36.172 --> 01:03:39.093
The number of people who don't have children or want children.

01:03:42.554 --> 01:03:43.615
My kids make fun of me.

01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:45.515
I just go around telling people to make babies.

01:03:47.036 --> 01:03:51.537
I mean, he really thinks he's profound and he's playing a character that thinks he's profound.

01:03:51.597 --> 01:03:54.198
That, you know, he's saying things that nobody else says.

01:03:54.278 --> 01:03:56.139
I go around telling people to make babies.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.101
It's just a joke to me.

01:04:03.182 --> 01:04:04.482
And it's the most normal thing in the world.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:10.211
I meet parents who don't harass their own children to get married and have families.

01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:11.431
Like, what are you doing?

01:04:12.651 --> 01:04:14.431
Think about this for a second, okay?

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:21.593
If it's normal, think about the music, right?

01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:28.834
What music was around when... What music is out there now?

01:04:29.714 --> 01:04:31.055
K-pop demon hunters?

01:04:31.155 --> 01:04:32.515
Is that what your kid listens to?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.501
You know, what are we listening to now?

01:04:36.642 --> 01:04:38.846
What were we listening to before?

01:04:38.866 --> 01:04:39.667
What is this song?

01:05:15.546 --> 01:05:19.151
This song is called Love Walks In, right, by Van Halen.

01:05:19.191 --> 01:05:24.339
Now my question is, in modern pop music, how much music is about falling in love?

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:29.774
How much music is about, I don't know, maybe there's some country music that's that way.

01:05:30.354 --> 01:05:34.117
But when I was a kid, all the songs were about it.

01:05:34.617 --> 01:05:39.301
Maybe they were about sex too, but it was about boys and girls getting together.

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:42.524
And it was about falling in love with girls.

01:05:42.624 --> 01:05:54.393
It was about, I mean, all of this music is about... Let me see if I can, I mean,

01:05:58.393 --> 01:06:01.615
I mean, even a song like Run to You by Bryan Adams.

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:06.517
Every song by Bryan Adams was about a girl or a woman.

01:06:07.237 --> 01:06:15.101
And so we go from a decade where, and think about that.

01:06:17.645 --> 01:06:25.628
You can see it in the way that our music has changed, in the way that our pop media has changed, and he's pretending that none of that has happened.

01:06:26.328 --> 01:06:41.873
He's pretending it's just, you know, kids making choices nowadays and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, rather than it being a highly orchestrated, forced change in the way that kids and adults and social media users see themselves in the world.

01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:45.396
It's not a spontaneous process.

01:06:45.616 --> 01:06:48.198
It is a process that is programmed in.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:07:01.247
And this man is part of the large theater of people that has been put on the internet to make sure that you can never really see that, that it seems like something real is happening.

01:07:01.307 --> 01:07:05.930
And he just happens to be one of those guys that was there at the right time.

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:08.332
And, you know, he's just an internet dude.

01:07:09.853 --> 01:07:11.294
The superstructures of the world.

01:07:11.434 --> 01:07:11.654
Yeah.

01:07:13.803 --> 01:07:15.284
One being family.

01:07:15.304 --> 01:07:16.125
Yeah.

01:07:16.725 --> 01:07:17.345
Traditions.

01:07:18.206 --> 01:07:20.347
Things that connect you to.

01:07:21.908 --> 01:07:24.850
And what are the symptoms of that unhooking from the superstructures of the world?

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:26.912
How much do you care about things?

01:07:27.692 --> 01:07:31.735
How much do you care about people saying your name four generations out?

01:07:32.675 --> 01:07:38.419
How much do you care about people saying your name four generations out?

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.841
So he phrases the question,

01:07:42.788 --> 01:07:45.530
in a very self-centered, egoistic way.

01:07:45.951 --> 01:07:50.154
How much do you care whether people know your name in four generations?

01:07:51.936 --> 01:07:56.780
What you should really be thinking about is how much do you care whether you have grandkids or not?

01:07:59.491 --> 01:08:05.493
He just got through telling him that he goes tell people about kids and people should have kids.

01:08:06.254 --> 01:08:11.135
Now he asks this question in a completely unrelated, almost antithetical way.

01:08:11.636 --> 01:08:19.599
If kids are the most important thing, if kids are the superstructure of the world, then actually aren't we borrowing the earth from our children?

01:08:19.639 --> 01:08:22.199
We're not inheriting the earth from our ancestors.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:29.002
We're borrowing the earth from our children and we're actually preparing the earth for our grandchildren.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:36.942
What more noble way of describing the work that we have to do would be to prepare the earth for our grandchildren?

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:45.164
And yet he asks the question in the phrase of, will they know your name?

01:08:47.365 --> 01:08:49.885
Well, who would be most likely to know your name?

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:52.206
Your fricking grandkids.

01:08:54.281 --> 01:09:16.174
You see how awful this is, how nasty the script is, and how much of a monkey that guy is over there on the other side of the table who probably just took a big pile of money to be a podcast kid, a podcast actor on a national security script aimed mostly at America, but also at the UK, which is also being destroyed.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:35.761
Yeah, you you're probably asking the wrong person because I just don't think legacy matters because I'm gonna be dead That's right, but you're I'm asking all of you who believe that yeah That is so sad It's so weird That no one cares about their legacy because they don't see a future.

01:09:36.101 --> 01:09:37.122
What is he telling you?

01:09:37.182 --> 01:09:40.565
He's telling you that he definitely is thinking about his legacy and

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:44.488
Peter Thiel's definitely thinking about his legacy.

01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:49.272
His dad, Les Weinstein, has been thinking about his legacy ever since he was a kid.

01:09:52.795 --> 01:09:53.516
You see what I mean?

01:09:55.177 --> 01:10:07.487
And people who have been thinking about their legacy have also been recruiting people, you know, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to help steer the future, generations ahead.

01:10:09.649 --> 01:10:10.430
It's so weird.

01:10:11.172 --> 01:10:12.813
that you guys don't see a future.

01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:16.876
You don't see a future because social media doesn't contain one.

01:10:17.377 --> 01:10:19.758
Social media isn't about the future.

01:10:19.858 --> 01:10:22.741
Social media is about now and what just happened.

01:10:24.962 --> 01:10:37.571
Exactly the opposite direction and the opposite timescale that he's talking about here, but with such imprecision that every listener and even the podcast interviewer himself is confused by it.

01:10:38.412 --> 01:10:39.393
So what I'm trying to say is,

01:10:40.973 --> 01:10:43.274
I'm desperate to get you a future so that you care.

01:10:45.096 --> 01:10:46.697
What needs to happen to get me a future?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.398
Something remarkable.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.339
Something remarkable.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.420
Something wonderful.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.962
Wasn't that the line for Jeff Bridges?

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.430
I don't know what to say.

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:02.133
I think that this stage acting play is crashing.

01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:04.394
And I think they meant it to go on longer.

01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:11.658
And it's supposed to last until the end of the Trump administration, at least, as we peel into this swing to the far left.

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:20.102
Because, you know, they talk about a liberal left hook or a conservative right hook or something like that, but it's the opposite.

01:11:20.723 --> 01:11:22.584
We're actually being set up the other way.

01:11:23.464 --> 01:11:47.660
And so the whole orchestration of the pandemic on a five-year timescale was to bait a bunch of the most intellectual, free-thinking people to question a narrative that would inevitably be dumped on their head in a very unpredictable way with regard to the vaccine schedule and health freedom and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.624
and Donald Trump, so that the entire experiment can be discredited in one go,

01:11:53.536 --> 01:11:57.464
And everybody will push in the opposite direction.

01:11:57.705 --> 01:11:59.107
And it's not a 50-50 push.

01:12:01.363 --> 01:12:06.165
We have been led to believe that the election of, you know, just barely, he just barely won.

01:12:06.805 --> 01:12:12.767
And that means that, you know, America's like 50-50, but America is not 50-50 about the Weinsteins.

01:12:12.987 --> 01:12:14.548
Almost nobody gives a shit.

01:12:15.048 --> 01:12:18.569
And he's not, America's not 50-50 about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:18.589 --> 01:12:20.350
Almost everybody thinks he's an idiot.

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:24.811
I mean, we are talking about a severely big majority here.

01:12:24.851 --> 01:12:26.232
We're not, it's not even 60-40.

01:12:29.881 --> 01:12:32.122
And it's by design going in that direction.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:37.465
That's why Steve Kirsch and Pierre Kory are on that anti-RFK tour.

01:12:43.409 --> 01:12:44.149
It was a trap.

01:12:44.589 --> 01:12:48.132
Something utterly remarkable because it's not going that way.

01:12:48.492 --> 01:12:50.333
And that's what the physics part is.

01:12:50.853 --> 01:12:52.594
I talk about physics constantly.

01:12:53.174 --> 01:12:55.476
Physics is the only thing that's gonna get you a future.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:57.057
How?

01:12:58.154 --> 01:13:01.058
Well, right now the big problem is that we share one atmosphere.

01:13:01.538 --> 01:13:01.699
Yeah.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.621
So he wants to get off the planet.

01:13:03.821 --> 01:13:04.582
You see what I mean?

01:13:04.622 --> 01:13:07.206
I just hope we can build rockets and they get on them quick.

01:13:08.757 --> 01:13:09.717
It's just absurd.

01:13:09.977 --> 01:13:13.919
It's just as absurd as the other stuff when we're really talking about biology.

01:13:13.979 --> 01:13:17.540
We should be talking about biology all the time, but these people are scripted actors.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:23.801
Here's another joke out there that I want Riff TV to be fucking rock star solid.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:26.682
I apologize, but I want you to hear the swearing again.

01:13:26.742 --> 01:13:32.224
Remember America's conservative whatever right has been fractured into a million pieces.

01:13:32.964 --> 01:13:36.366
And only 100,000 people need to watch Riff TV.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:40.048
Only 100,000 people need to see Kim Iverson.

01:13:40.088 --> 01:13:42.970
Only 100,000 people need to read Last Vagabond.

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:48.794
Only 100,000 or 200,000 or a half a million people need to read Robert Malone news.

01:13:48.854 --> 01:13:59.260
And only, you know, half a million people or a million people need to watch Tucker Carlson for there to be enough people on the internet to create the illusion it's about half of America.

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:03.143
And it ain't half of America.

01:14:05.085 --> 01:14:06.086
We're in big trouble.

01:14:06.846 --> 01:14:07.987
The trap is closing.

01:14:08.828 --> 01:14:14.174
And this is one of the buffoons that makes up the teeth of the trap.

01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:17.177
This guy, it's just remarkable.

01:14:17.337 --> 01:14:17.517
Why?

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:21.261
Because we the people, the people out there watching this show,

01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:28.731
They need you to be their eyeballs for those douchebags in Washington, D.C.

01:14:29.191 --> 01:14:35.637
that are stealing time from them all these innocuous ways and insidious ways that nobody can put their finger on.

01:14:35.677 --> 01:14:40.021
They know something's wrong, but they don't know why it's wrong.

01:14:40.722 --> 01:14:41.483
You're that guy.

01:14:41.623 --> 01:14:42.604
What are five accounts

01:14:44.244 --> 01:14:53.852
Like I already know some words I'm going to be muting and some people I'm going to be muting, but you know, you have to, you have to kind of take control of your algorithm or it'll take control of you in terms of what information you're exposed to.

01:14:53.892 --> 01:15:09.766
So in terms of five accounts or people, maybe you don't know the account names that you think are on the money in finance, Bitcoin, medicine, who are five people that you think that... One of the ways that this movement has been fractured is with Bitcoin.

01:15:09.826 --> 01:15:12.088
Some people are really into that.

01:15:12.813 --> 01:15:20.539
and have spent many, many hours on it, and other people don't give a darn about Bitcoin.

01:15:21.059 --> 01:15:30.507
Just like some people spent hours and hours on PCR, hours and hours on DNA, or hours and hours on virology, or hours and hours on no virus.

01:15:30.807 --> 01:15:32.908
It's all the same kind of thing.

01:15:32.968 --> 01:15:36.491
That fracturing of the intellectual space is by design.

01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:40.614
There's got to be room for everybody, and they have actors on every stage.

01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:42.476
It's a Lollapalooza of liars.

01:15:43.096 --> 01:15:51.320
These guys might not have many viewers, but they need to be there Just like Shannon joy needs to be there and doc Malik needs to be there.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:16:10.569
These are all scripted clowns that have been recruited and Agreed to stick to the script and not question it Even when somebody like me comes along and gives them a way of seeing through it they stick to the script and

01:16:12.355 --> 01:16:13.977
Doc Malek knows that I'm right.

01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:21.704
Shannon Joy met me in person in Pittsburgh in November of 2024, introduced in person by Joe Marshall.

01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:30.513
They all know who I am and they all have watched my show and they all know I can say it very succinctly and they all know that I can

01:16:31.505 --> 01:16:37.049
I could go on camera and explain why Robert Malone is a fraud, why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:37.109 --> 01:16:58.685
is a fraud, why Martin Kulldorff is probably just a scripted fraud, why Mary Holland and Meryl Nass are scripted frauds, why Brian Hooker is a scripted fraud, and why frickin' Paul Offit is a scripted fraud, and yet nobody from either side wants to use me against the other because that's not how it will work out.

01:17:00.578 --> 01:17:11.663
What will happen is that this 30 year, you know, that culminated in the last 10 years, in the last six years, this, this national security illusion will disappear.

01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:15.464
The illusion of pandemics will disappear.

01:17:15.524 --> 01:17:18.325
The illusion of vaccine skepticism will disappear.

01:17:18.385 --> 01:17:24.188
The illusion of, of vaccines being the best thing since buttered bread will disappear.

01:17:29.522 --> 01:17:32.563
And the illusion of the human genome project would start to disappear.

01:17:32.623 --> 01:17:35.784
And that's all things that none of these people can let happen.

01:17:35.804 --> 01:17:49.647
And that's why, you know, Mr. Glasses here has no concept of how to question it and is focused on, you know, giving you bullshit avenues to go down with regard to mitochondria without really actually saying anything about mitochondria.

01:17:51.108 --> 01:17:55.449
I'll give you the top ones, I think, on the biology first.

01:17:55.929 --> 01:17:57.410
Alexis Cowan is one.

01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:58.830
She's a PhD researcher.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:20.994
another one is a just a random dude that uh he's really he's really hit the ball out of the park his name is on twitter helios so a random dude on helios he just assumes is just some guy who really hits it out of the park because he's so tough or he's so hard hitting and that's just a joke again but it's the same as pbs news hour saying that

01:18:21.434 --> 01:18:24.116
You know, Donald Trump can tweet something and that's important.

01:18:24.216 --> 01:18:28.019
Or, you know, Elon Musk tweeted something in Germany and that's important.

01:18:28.059 --> 01:18:40.427
It's the same thing as saying we have a Substack author and their Substack is X, Y, and Z because they all agree that this new social media and these mediums are the way that things are happening.

01:18:40.868 --> 01:18:42.849
And that agreement is scripted.

01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:54.007
Just like the agreement about it's a lab leak or it's a natural virus is a perfectly good dichotomy of questions to face for five years.

01:18:54.507 --> 01:18:55.368
That is a script.

01:18:56.349 --> 01:18:57.590
This is a scripted actor.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:03.815
Just because he swears a lot or doesn't wear a shirt when he's by his pool doesn't make him any less scripted.

01:19:04.295 --> 01:19:09.799
Just like Whitney Webb's shitty haircut and dumb glasses doesn't make her any less scripted.

01:19:09.839 --> 01:19:11.580
Just like Glenn Beck's

01:19:12.341 --> 01:19:17.166
fabulous studio, you know, it doesn't matter how you do it, you're scripted.

01:19:21.383 --> 01:19:26.306
I like that he's fucking edgy, and he takes a lot of my stuff, and he really fires people up.

01:19:27.487 --> 01:19:30.228
Another guy is a guy on Twitter, ZeRusty.

01:19:30.268 --> 01:19:36.192
He's got another name, but if you follow him, he really posts like salt of the earth kind of things that get you better.

01:19:36.932 --> 01:19:40.194
Another guy that's got a podcast, he's now getting ready to get a PhD.

01:19:40.214 --> 01:19:41.355
His name's Cameron Borg.

01:19:41.775 --> 01:19:46.078
He's very interested in quantum biology, and he's a good follow.

01:19:46.598 --> 01:19:48.099
That's enough on the biology side.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.441
And then I would tell you on the Bitcoin side,

01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:57.106
See, when they say quantum biology, they don't really know what they're talking about and they can't really explain it.

01:19:57.307 --> 01:20:00.850
And if they were to explain it, it would be a really shitty explanation.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.173
And that's the issue.

01:20:04.753 --> 01:20:07.035
Quantum biology is a lot of mythology.

01:20:07.075 --> 01:20:14.142
It's a lot of hocus pocus, but he likes to say it because then it seems like he's got a whole nother, you know, big knife on his belt.

01:20:14.282 --> 01:20:17.084
I mean, he hasn't even shown you all the stuff he's got in his EDC.

01:20:20.809 --> 01:20:25.492
Sorry, that's everyday carry for those people who aren't interested in pocket knives and that kind of thing.

01:20:25.872 --> 01:20:29.714
Favorite's Larry Lippard, who I hope you reach out to.

01:20:29.935 --> 01:20:31.095
Yeah, he's fantastic actually.

01:20:31.135 --> 01:20:31.355
Right.

01:20:31.676 --> 01:20:35.718
And Larry is a boomer, so I'm going to give your young audience another boomer.

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.220
I'm sure all of you are going, fucking get rid of this boomer.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.082
Let's get some... Oh, so this is a young audience on Riff TV.

01:20:42.182 --> 01:20:42.803
Great.

01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:44.732
somebody young on.

01:20:45.152 --> 01:20:48.595
But then I would tell you a younger guy from Canada is Jeff Booth.

01:20:49.156 --> 01:20:55.262
Jeff Booth, the reason why he's a good follow, because he's absolutely a freedom maximalist, but he's also Canadian, so he's conflicted.

01:20:55.942 --> 01:20:58.324
And he's got spectacular information

01:20:59.305 --> 01:21:21.101
on bitcoin i'm going to give you another canadian too who is as far as i'm concerned for my members i always say if you have a wallet question you have a cold storage question his name is ben but it's btc underscore sessions he's on youtube he's on x they just try to take his youtube channel away which is really unfortunate

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:27.742
And then a guy who's a macro guy that I really like, you know, this is more in the fiat world, Luke Roman.

01:21:27.942 --> 01:21:31.223
I think Luke Roman is spectacular follow.

01:21:32.623 --> 01:21:35.084
He won't say everything you want to say, but he should.

01:21:35.104 --> 01:21:44.966
And then I'm going to give you a new section who is a little bit of both, but these are data guys that are fucking killer.

01:21:45.914 --> 01:21:56.721
ethical skeptic who is a former Navy intelligence officer who is when it comes to cutting through the bullshit this is a guy you need to follow and

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:06.067
I would tell you another- There was a while in 2022 where everybody was debating whether Ethical Skeptic was a man or a woman.

01:22:06.107 --> 01:22:09.631
I mean, Ethical Skeptic is mostly full of shit.

01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:15.939
The guy is from Massachusetts, who's done yeoman duties, an electrical engineer, his name's John Bedoin.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.721
John Bedoin!

01:22:17.781 --> 01:22:19.203
I thought it was John Bodewin.

01:22:19.798 --> 01:22:20.559
I mean, really?

01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:21.420
Bedoin.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.001
Wow.

01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:24.064
So he doesn't even really know his name.

01:22:24.124 --> 01:22:24.845
That's sad.

01:22:24.945 --> 01:22:25.646
Sorry, John.

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:32.354
But I think John Bodwin actually told me that his name is John Bodwin, even though it's spelled John Bodine.

01:22:33.308 --> 01:22:34.369
Holy crap.

01:22:34.569 --> 01:22:36.590
He has done stuff on the Bitcoin.

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:42.693
I should say on the COVID side, looking at death records, that is spectacular.

01:22:43.474 --> 01:22:49.977
And then I think the biggest follow that really is the link between both, that's Kevin McKiernan.

01:22:50.518 --> 01:22:55.140
Kevin McKiernan is a cannabis researcher, worked on the Human Genome Project.

01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:57.862
He's a no bullshit fucking kind of guy.

01:22:58.442 --> 01:23:01.004
I got to spend time with him and his family in Prague.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:04.907
He spent time with him in Prague.

01:23:06.988 --> 01:23:19.539
These people are traveling all around the world, you know, podcasting from their pools and giving cannabis talks about the, you know, hemp industry versus medical marijuana industry.

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:27.665
And, you know, they're just a lot of jet setting suckers, you know, that just all the censorship and stuff, it's real expensive and whatever.

01:23:27.705 --> 01:23:27.905
I mean,

01:23:28.766 --> 01:23:30.447
My gosh, come on.

01:23:30.948 --> 01:23:38.193
And I will just tell you that if you're a fucking mitochondriac in training or a savage, and I'm talking to you right now, you follow him.

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.535
He may not have it all right, but he's got most of it right.

01:23:41.555 --> 01:23:45.078
And I can tell you most of the fucking jackasses on X, on YouTube,

01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:49.594
Uh, the people that are longevity space, they're not going to fucking help you.

01:23:50.155 --> 01:23:58.744
But that guy, uh, I can tell you he is above board and he cares actually about people.

01:23:59.384 --> 01:24:01.306
And I think in my business, what do I do?

01:24:01.867 --> 01:24:03.649
I'm sorry, but I'll say it right out loud.

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:08.173
I think Kevin McKernan is one of the worst actors in this space.

01:24:08.914 --> 01:24:16.295
I think he's likely one of the people that scripted Meryl Nass and helped to script Robert Malone and helped to script Mary Holland maybe for years.

01:24:17.168 --> 01:24:19.069
He may have known Brian Hooker for years.

01:24:19.249 --> 01:24:25.530
I would go so far as to say Kevin McKernan is one of the fakest Americans on earth.

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:30.772
Exactly the opposite of what this blowhard is saying right now.

01:24:31.192 --> 01:24:36.093
Hivilma is right in the chat, and this guy is funded by Nicole Shanahan.

01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:37.814
Well there, that's all you have to know.

01:24:38.334 --> 01:24:46.076
It is one malevolent shitshow of people that are using pictures and videos and lies against

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:49.676
Vulnerable people on social media.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:56.400
At the behest of people that would rather not have an American Republic anymore.

01:24:58.041 --> 01:25:08.648
I don't know what we're trying to save here, but I do know that there is a future that I want for my children that doesn't involve people like this, actors like this, and social media like this.

01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:14.349
My legacy isn't going to be in a monument.

01:25:14.469 --> 01:25:16.070
It's not going to be here or there.

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:19.394
It's going to be in the minds of people when I'm fucking dead.

01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:20.235
Why?

01:25:20.255 --> 01:25:25.280
I want to leave this mark on people to know that what really matters

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.540
is the mitochondrial genome.

01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:29.661
Epigenetics.

01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:32.001
It's not so much the nucleogenome.

01:25:32.762 --> 01:25:35.402
It's not so much the nucleogenome.

01:25:35.462 --> 01:25:39.884
It's the mitochondrial genome and he wants to leave that for people.

01:25:40.604 --> 01:25:44.145
This dude is a scripted actor and he's full of shit.

01:25:45.245 --> 01:25:48.226
He will never be able to get into more detail than that.

01:25:49.048 --> 01:25:57.717
And if he did, it would be a bunch of mumbo-jumbo and dumbassery that would end with something like, and quantum biology is really the foundation of all of this.

01:25:58.878 --> 01:26:09.208
These people are such charlatans, such snake oil salesmen, with his frickin' red glasses on and certain wavelengths of light are killing you.

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:19.236
And I need to get that message out to guys like you because you're a young man, you're extremely important.

01:26:19.536 --> 01:26:24.060
So he said to listen to this one biologist named Alexis something or other.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.581
Let's listen to Alexis for a second.

01:26:25.601 --> 01:26:25.922
Important.

01:26:25.942 --> 01:26:39.574
So what would be the mechanism behind vitamin D and sun exposure helping with colorectal cancer?

01:26:40.336 --> 01:26:40.957
Great question.

01:26:41.477 --> 01:26:42.779
What do you do?

01:26:42.799 --> 01:26:43.640
You got some quotes for us?

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.120
I'll take it.

01:26:44.221 --> 01:26:44.481
Okay.

01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:44.621
Yeah.

01:26:44.641 --> 01:26:46.003
I'll just read the quotes really quick.

01:26:46.043 --> 01:26:47.304
So that's her over there.

01:26:47.605 --> 01:26:50.848
This is Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.

01:26:50.888 --> 01:26:54.293
And then that's the other one that he said, Alexis, somebody to follow.

01:26:55.514 --> 01:26:57.897
And she's about to read shit off of her phone.

01:27:01.022 --> 01:27:10.397
Do you believe that these people are doing a podcast and making a living because they have subscribers or they put out content that people are willing to pay for?

01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:12.961
They've got a sub stack that's just rising?

01:27:15.404 --> 01:27:16.365
Is that what you believe?

01:27:16.845 --> 01:27:19.026
So here's a quote from a study.

01:27:19.226 --> 01:27:20.206
There's PMIDs.

01:27:20.226 --> 01:27:21.847
We can link in the show notes if people are interested.

01:27:22.428 --> 01:27:43.598
So it says, studies in the past decade indicate that insufficient sun exposure may be responsible for 340,000 deaths in the US and 480,000 deaths in Europe per year and an increased incidence of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, autism, asthma, type 1 diabetes, and myopia.

01:27:44.979 --> 01:27:48.120
I actually thought all those things were due to red meat.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.580
Oh, I know, right?

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.720
That's what you would be allowed to think in this culture, right?

01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:54.881
We also have another quote here.

01:27:55.161 --> 01:28:01.622
Frequent regular sun exposure acts to cause cancers that have a 0.3% death rate with 2,000 US fatalities per year.

01:28:01.662 --> 01:28:04.222
This is the SCC and the BCC skin cancers I mentioned.

01:28:04.982 --> 01:28:08.383
And acts to prevent cancers that have death rates from 20% to 65% with 138,000 US fatalities per year.

01:28:08.403 --> 01:28:09.963
That's the breast, colon, and blood cancers primarily.

01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:21.649
And my understanding is the reason that you're pointing this out is because we've been told a lot to stay out of the sun.

01:28:22.449 --> 01:28:23.810
We do spend a ton of time indoors.

01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:24.290
I'm curious.

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:27.852
Is this like the female version of ZDoggMD?

01:28:27.932 --> 01:28:37.357
Like she decided to go into podcasting because medicine is hard, but she's got an MD because, you know, that's what they do when you, when you pay a medical school for four years, they give you an MD.

01:28:38.017 --> 01:28:39.038
What is going on here?

01:28:40.546 --> 01:28:41.407
as to what the numbers are.

01:28:43.349 --> 01:28:47.112
And potentially that is doing us a tremendous amount of harm.

01:28:47.793 --> 01:28:59.023
And so then we are told to go outside, put sunscreen in, and I can appreciate what you're saying from that perspective that we are not getting enough sunlight.

01:29:00.304 --> 01:29:02.166
But it's more complicated than that, isn't it?

01:29:02.881 --> 01:29:10.163
Well, so I would really, as it relates to mechanisms of like cancer and sun exposure, I'd like to unpack another part of the story.

01:29:10.984 --> 01:29:21.087
Maybe briefly to wrap up the vitamin D side of the story, when UVB light hits your skin, it's not only that pre-vitamin D that's made, there's also over a dozen other vitamin D-like molecules that are made in response to UVB light.

01:29:21.487 --> 01:29:24.328
So if you're supplementing with vitamin D, you're missing out.

01:29:24.348 --> 01:29:26.848
You're getting a very narrow spectrum result.

01:29:26.908 --> 01:29:27.709
But if someone couldn't

01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:34.673
get outside, let's say they're institutionalized or in the hospital, they have a limited exposure to sunlight.

01:29:34.754 --> 01:29:35.234
What could someone do?

01:29:35.254 --> 01:29:36.415
Would they have to change their light bulbs?

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:52.747
What would be... See, the funny thing is, is that if you're talking about vitamin D and you're not talking about calcium metabolism and you're not talking about parathyroid hormone, then I don't think you're talking about anything that's really relevant because vitamin D sits at the heart of that.

01:29:54.031 --> 01:30:00.279
Vitamin D also is a cofactor for T-cells and a lot of the stuff that happens in immunity, but that's neither here nor there.

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:08.611
It could just be a cofactor that's necessary as opposed to like facilitating or something like that, you know, like you need dirt to grow a plant.

01:30:09.291 --> 01:30:15.337
Vitamin D could be in the background all the time and play that kind of a role in a lot of cellular metabolism.

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:23.043
But the heart of it in terms of, you know, day-to-day really important shit, it's the regulation of calcium.

01:30:23.103 --> 01:30:32.432
Calcium is one of the more important signaling molecules in the body and it regulated very, very tightly to very, very low concentrations

01:30:32.992 --> 01:30:42.778
when it's not supposed to be around and is a signal molecule so that it can be detected at very low concentrations and have very impressive physiological results.

01:30:44.019 --> 01:30:49.362
And so calcium metabolism is... Are you flying in the garage?

01:30:51.724 --> 01:30:58.388
And calcium metabolism is related to, dependent on vitamin D.

01:30:59.369 --> 01:31:09.218
And so to talk so aspecifically about vitamin D only in correlation to other things and other observations is so dumb.

01:31:09.978 --> 01:31:10.959
It's so dumb.

01:31:11.379 --> 01:31:14.422
And we have two doctors doing it together on a podcast.

01:31:14.922 --> 01:31:16.704
This is what we're talking about here.

01:31:17.224 --> 01:31:19.526
The national security state will fund

01:31:20.526 --> 01:31:23.150
people like this because they're not dangerous.

01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:29.119
They waste people's time and get people asking questions that will never get them out of the trap.

01:31:29.559 --> 01:31:31.722
They'll never question intramuscular injection.

01:31:31.783 --> 01:31:34.246
It's just a dumb idea that we've never really considered.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:40.924
They'll never realize that the COVID shot is actually just a recycling of old, old technology.

01:31:40.964 --> 01:31:44.306
That's been used in universities for 20 years on mice and monkeys.

01:31:44.746 --> 01:31:50.950
They'll never come to realize that social media could be used to destroy a nation or even a world.

01:31:53.872 --> 01:31:55.773
Everybody that speaks the same language.

01:31:57.455 --> 01:32:00.056
I mean, it's frightening ladies and gentlemen, what's happening.

01:32:00.076 --> 01:32:02.638
And I think we have a very limited time to get out.

01:32:03.973 --> 01:32:05.334
and to get our kids out with us.

01:32:06.015 --> 01:32:07.056
An opportunity for change.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:16.806
So I mean, I think this is one reason why this story has not really been popularized, because there's a lot of implications as to actually how we're living our lives, how people are being.

01:32:16.866 --> 01:32:22.311
So this is the woman that Jack Krause said that that guy should follow, this person.

01:32:24.754 --> 01:32:27.877
Just some random person who's too young to know anything.

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:35.567
With too little professional experience to know anything and she's already podcasting like an expert.

01:32:37.809 --> 01:32:43.453
Already being promoted by somebody who is funded by Nicole Shannon?

01:32:45.494 --> 01:32:45.875
Wow.

01:32:48.437 --> 01:32:50.118
Led to think in a certain type of way.

01:32:52.952 --> 01:32:59.861
This Week in Virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:06.028
Hello, Harvard Virology.

01:33:14.949 --> 01:33:24.514
I thought it would be nice to watch this for a little while because you get an insight into a scientific department and how a scientific department works.

01:33:25.574 --> 01:33:28.035
This is a virology department retreat.

01:33:28.115 --> 01:33:35.359
So they went somewhere and they rented some rooms and there's a meeting place so they can have breakfast together and then they all give

01:33:35.939 --> 01:33:39.940
presentations about their research and have dinner together and stuff.

01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:43.000
And so as their keynote speaker, they had TWIV.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.441
And so the Harvard Virology Department has TWIV.

01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:49.162
They're doing a TWIV show.

01:33:49.342 --> 01:33:52.602
And they have three of their all-stars on stage.

01:33:52.842 --> 01:33:54.823
And this show is magnificent.

01:33:54.863 --> 01:33:57.123
At least the first half hour is magnificent.

01:33:58.024 --> 01:33:59.564
Virology retreat in 2011.

01:34:01.324 --> 01:34:04.867
And one of my guests in the audience, David Knipe.

01:34:05.968 --> 01:34:07.730
And Phil Kranzu, she was another.

01:34:11.273 --> 01:34:11.914
That was fun.

01:34:11.974 --> 01:34:12.575
Now I'm back.

01:34:12.895 --> 01:34:14.797
And thank you for having us back.

01:34:14.837 --> 01:34:15.898
I guess you like TWIV.

01:34:16.838 --> 01:34:18.040
This may be the last one, though.

01:34:20.302 --> 01:34:24.205
My guest today from Harvard University, Aaron Schmidt.

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:24.686
Welcome.

01:34:29.818 --> 01:34:32.347
Those are all the students and grad students cheering.

01:34:35.023 --> 01:34:48.816
So of course, this is part of what goes on as you climb the ladder of tenure and get tenure, that you get this kind of, you know, you feel like a little bit of a celebrity, and these people are climbing tenure at Harvard.

01:34:48.936 --> 01:34:54.461
So needless to say, this guy feels very much, you know, like a guy in a big chair.

01:34:54.481 --> 01:35:00.647
Thank you, Vincent, and thank you very much for accepting our invitation to come here to be our keynote speaker for our retreat.

01:35:01.992 --> 01:35:05.313
I drove up with Aaron, so he's obviously an OK driver, right?

01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:09.995
Also joining us in the middle, a GS5 or G5.

01:35:10.255 --> 01:35:11.716
Is it G5 or GS?

01:35:12.316 --> 01:35:15.017
G. G. G is the government level thing.

01:35:15.117 --> 01:35:15.437
G5.

01:35:15.597 --> 01:35:18.698
Does that mean she's a grad student, fifth year?

01:35:18.718 --> 01:35:23.360
I think that's what that means.

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.161
That's a lot of time and a lot of money.

01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:26.781
Wow.

01:35:27.402 --> 01:35:28.862
G5 Tatum Sass.

01:35:28.982 --> 01:35:29.782
Welcome to Twim.

01:35:30.003 --> 01:35:31.023
Thanks so much for having me.

01:35:37.819 --> 01:35:40.741
And at the end there, Ben Gowers, welcome to TWIV.

01:35:40.842 --> 01:35:41.482
You got a mic.

01:35:41.522 --> 01:35:42.283
Yeah, thanks.

01:35:42.323 --> 01:35:43.183
I've watched a lot of TWIVs.

01:35:43.203 --> 01:35:44.264
It's amazing to be on this side.

01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:45.105
Good.

01:35:45.405 --> 01:35:46.946
Well, we're going to put you through the paces.

01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:54.753
Not only did you pick TWIV as the keynote, which I think is very good, right?

01:35:54.793 --> 01:35:55.313
It's different.

01:35:55.353 --> 01:35:58.756
And that's what I always wanted to do with these podcasts, do something different.

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:03.500
Now, what's interesting is that this first guy gets really nervous because

01:36:04.861 --> 01:36:08.145
He's going to be asked a bunch of questions, and he doesn't want to be a spokesman.

01:36:08.185 --> 01:36:13.351
Remember, because they have a very narrow field that they're experts in.

01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:15.974
And so they really are afraid to be challenged.

01:36:15.994 --> 01:36:17.696
I picked the panelists, too.

01:36:18.116 --> 01:36:19.057
I had no say in this.

01:36:19.097 --> 01:36:20.799
So thank you very much.

01:36:20.839 --> 01:36:22.741
And if they do well, it's your doing.

01:36:22.781 --> 01:36:23.923
And if they don't, it's your doing.

01:36:25.199 --> 01:36:27.300
So by the way, I have stickers here, right?

01:36:27.821 --> 01:36:31.443
Because I want you to advertise for Microbe TV.

01:36:31.503 --> 01:36:34.284
You can stick these and come and get them afterwards, OK?

01:36:34.304 --> 01:36:34.765
Don't forget.

01:36:34.785 --> 01:36:36.986
I don't want to take them back with me.

01:36:39.747 --> 01:36:45.111
You know that I did a postdoc with David Baltimore, and he just passed away September 6, not too long ago.

01:36:45.151 --> 01:36:47.332
David Knipe was also a postdoc.

01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:49.093
A student.

01:36:49.113 --> 01:36:50.754
Wow, he looks so young.

01:36:53.746 --> 01:36:57.314
We didn't overlap but I used to see you at parties and so forth.

01:36:57.334 --> 01:36:59.999
We got to be friends and so it was a big loss.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.729
David was a fantastic scientist that you know and I assumed he would live forever.

01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:09.077
because you could always call him or email him and he'd answer.

01:37:09.158 --> 01:37:12.281
So it's really, it's too bad because he was amazing.

01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:18.667
And I thought he was the best scientist I ever knew, frankly, the brightest biologist in the world.

01:37:19.869 --> 01:37:20.389
So it's too bad.

01:37:20.409 --> 01:37:24.233
But I had interviewed him for TWIV 100, which, oh my gosh, that was

01:37:25.755 --> 01:37:27.176
2010, ages ago.

01:37:27.816 --> 01:37:33.721
And Monday, the day after he passed, I listened to the whole thing and I said, oh my gosh, this is actually good.

01:37:35.502 --> 01:37:38.945
The sound was good and he was great, of course, and we asked good questions.

01:37:38.965 --> 01:37:39.805
So I reissued it.

01:37:40.845 --> 01:37:47.650
And when I went to the archive to look for the audio files, I found a video that I had never released.

01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:56.695
I was a novice back then, I put the camera on a tripod and I just pointed it at him, because I didn't know how to get me in it, I didn't know how to get the two people online in it.

01:37:57.256 --> 01:38:01.419
And I never released it, but it's there now if you want to see him.

01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:18.093
Answering the questions and you know, I'm not a great video editor But at the end I thank him and he says thank you and then I just have him fade away and the chair is empty Yeah, no, I'm not Quentin Tarantino I Just thought it was was cool.

01:38:18.113 --> 01:38:18.994
So go check that out.

01:38:19.074 --> 01:38:27.040
It's over at our YouTube channel micro TV if you enjoy these programs We'd love to have your support to do them.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.882
So we bring you science and

01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:31.853
Real science, no lies, no disinformation.

01:38:32.113 --> 01:38:34.955
We give you the science as it's done by scientists.

01:38:35.015 --> 01:38:38.098
And if you like that and you need to know this, we'd love your support.

01:38:38.138 --> 01:38:39.620
We don't do ads on our programs.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.104
We depend on listener support, microbe.tv slash contribute.

01:38:46.586 --> 01:38:51.290
OK, Aaron, you're the head of the virology program.

01:38:51.391 --> 01:38:53.713
So what is a retreat?

01:38:56.661 --> 01:39:14.311
a retreat is a formal gathering of it no that's the head of virology at Harvard Medical School that guy right there that sounds a lot like Rick Bright I mean I don't know what to say I don't I don't believe it but it's I guess apparently it's true

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:20.299
It's one of the highlights, in my opinion, of the entire program.

01:39:20.519 --> 01:39:35.705
And it's a chance for all of our students and some of our faculty to gather together to celebrate the science that everybody is doing, and also an opportunity for all of us to get together and join together to discuss science and celebrate each other.

01:39:35.765 --> 01:39:44.729
And so I think it's incredibly important, especially in the current climate, that there's an opportunity for us to gather and, again, to celebrate each other.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:48.643
So this is something you do every year, right?

01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:48.844
Yes.

01:39:49.584 --> 01:39:49.805
Yes.

01:39:50.025 --> 01:40:01.278
So this happens every year in the fall, and it's a chance to welcome our incoming first-year graduate students who have been accepted into our program and are about to begin their very long, arduous,

01:40:02.559 --> 01:40:04.260
Long PhDs.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.241
And this is before they've had a chance to select who they're going to do their thesis research with.

01:40:10.561 --> 01:40:28.746
So it's an opportunity for our incoming class to be able to interact with other class upper years and hear about their experiences that they've had with their mentors and their thesis advisors and give them an opportunity to learn about all the science, the great science, that is being done in the virology space at Harvard.

01:40:28.946 --> 01:40:31.067
And so it happens every single year in the fall.

01:40:31.807 --> 01:40:38.112
It varies from where we go, whether it's in the mountains here, where everybody loves to hike, apparently.

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:40.274
Not me.

01:40:41.595 --> 01:40:48.680
But then it's also an opportunity that we can go to Cape Cod, which is my favorite place to go to, Provincetown in particular, which David notoriously hates.

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:54.124
So when I was a student, it was not an opportunity for us to go there because David did not like it.

01:40:54.665 --> 01:41:00.409
But now that I'm head of the program, we will be going to Provincetown again, even though we're not there this year.

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:03.531
Thank you, Suzanne.

01:41:03.591 --> 01:41:04.551
Where are the G1s?

01:41:04.712 --> 01:41:05.232
Raise your hand.

01:41:05.252 --> 01:41:05.892
I want to see you.

01:41:07.033 --> 01:41:07.554
Oh, cool.

01:41:07.574 --> 01:41:08.474
Did you have a good retreat?

01:41:08.494 --> 01:41:10.136
Yes.

01:41:10.556 --> 01:41:12.077
Well, you're not going to say no, right?

01:41:14.239 --> 01:41:14.699
OK.

01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.982
So these are great.

01:41:18.342 --> 01:41:20.884
I had a great time at the last one, and I'm really glad to be back.

01:41:21.285 --> 01:41:22.525
This was even better, actually.

01:41:24.147 --> 01:41:30.813
One of the cool things at this retreat is last night we had a trivia contest, right, which was really good.

01:41:30.833 --> 01:41:44.386
Every table was a team and we got really great questions and like there was a whole series of clips from science fiction movies, right, and you had to guess what the movie was.

01:41:45.026 --> 01:41:51.735
I thought that was cool because Ian Lipkin was the script consultant for Contagion.

01:41:52.175 --> 01:41:57.462
He actually gives a talk where he goes through all the virus-related movies and critiques them.

01:41:57.942 --> 01:41:59.985
The earliest one is in the 20s with Vincent Price.

01:42:00.065 --> 01:42:01.287
It's a black and white issue.

01:42:02.806 --> 01:42:08.788
I wonder if Mark knows that Ian Lipkin was the script consultant for Contagion.

01:42:08.828 --> 01:42:12.469
I think Contagion is the movie that opens with a Lederberg quote, right?

01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:14.110
Maybe I'm getting them all mixed up.

01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:14.890
We issued later.

01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:17.271
It was redone in color with… Maybe that was Outbreak.

01:42:17.451 --> 01:42:18.512
You should check out that.

01:42:18.552 --> 01:42:21.052
If he's ever around and he's giving that lecture, you should check it out.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.962
Let's see, there was a Twiv set of questions, which I thought was really cool.

01:42:27.482 --> 01:42:28.523
I got all those right.

01:42:32.345 --> 01:42:33.846
But there was one that was kind of confusing.

01:42:33.866 --> 01:42:35.287
What was the latest Twiv?

01:42:35.327 --> 01:42:36.928
And there were two this week, right?

01:42:36.968 --> 01:42:38.589
So we had to modify that.

01:42:39.389 --> 01:42:42.631
And then- I'm gonna speed this up just a little bit.

01:42:42.771 --> 01:42:44.652
It is 100% heaps.

01:42:44.672 --> 01:42:44.992
Gosh, okay.

01:42:48.963 --> 01:42:51.525
Like someone told me who cares, except us.

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:52.666
So that's really cool.

01:42:53.406 --> 01:42:56.248
And here's another thing that I picked up during this meeting.

01:42:56.289 --> 01:42:57.249
How to pronounce words.

01:42:57.269 --> 01:42:57.870
This is from you.

01:42:59.291 --> 01:42:59.571
Oh, no.

01:43:00.171 --> 01:43:02.293
So how do you pronounce the word H-E-P-E-S?

01:43:04.154 --> 01:43:04.574
Oh, gosh.

01:43:04.735 --> 01:43:05.015
OK.

01:43:06.416 --> 01:43:07.737
I've always said heaps.

01:43:13.174 --> 01:43:15.995
The great David Knipe corrected me and said it's heepees.

01:43:16.095 --> 01:43:18.956
So from now on, I don't care.

01:43:18.976 --> 01:43:20.757
I'm going to have to switch.

01:43:21.277 --> 01:43:22.758
I mean, that's kind of sad, right?

01:43:23.018 --> 01:43:28.540
It's spelled H-E-P-E-S, and they're all capital letters.

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:32.862
So SCUBA, it's an acronym for a chemical.

01:43:33.908 --> 01:43:38.532
So you're not going to say heaps because he won't hear the spelling.

01:43:39.252 --> 01:43:49.380
It would be spelled H E E P S or H E A P S, but it wouldn't be spelled H E P E S and say heaps.

01:43:50.781 --> 01:43:52.963
Only dumb dumbs say heaps.

01:43:53.904 --> 01:44:00.369
And yet we are now reinforcing that because the head of virology at Harvard is a dumb dumb.

01:44:02.009 --> 01:44:02.829
It sounds like herpes.

01:44:03.629 --> 01:44:12.532
Oh, it is 100% heaps.

01:44:14.453 --> 01:44:16.213
I'm going with hepes because it sounds like herpes.

01:44:18.394 --> 01:44:20.854
So Dave and I are the same era.

01:44:20.974 --> 01:44:23.995
We used to call it hepes, right?

01:44:24.015 --> 01:44:25.496
But it doesn't matter.

01:44:25.536 --> 01:44:28.857
I mean, it's just an abbreviation for a chemical, so it doesn't really matter, right?

01:44:28.877 --> 01:44:29.797
All right, here's another one.

01:44:31.933 --> 01:44:33.975
This one is from you guys, C-O-O-P.

01:44:33.995 --> 01:44:35.076
How do you pronounce that word?

01:44:35.996 --> 01:44:38.238
C-O-O-P is a store in your place, right?

01:44:38.258 --> 01:44:38.918
In your campus.

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:40.600
How do you pronounce C-O-O-P?

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.240
It's the coop.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:41.801
The coop?

01:44:42.041 --> 01:44:42.561
The coop.

01:44:43.122 --> 01:44:45.243
Even though it comes from a cooperative, right?

01:44:45.343 --> 01:44:54.030
The co-op is a cooperative where people pay money to be a member so that they get things cheaper because they buy them together.

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:57.873
It's a cooperative supermarket or co-op

01:44:58.433 --> 01:45:02.035
For short, you could call it a coop, but then you'd be a dumbass.

01:45:03.996 --> 01:45:04.236
Coop.

01:45:05.076 --> 01:45:05.256
Coop.

01:45:05.777 --> 01:45:06.977
So, Cornelian.

01:45:06.997 --> 01:45:08.218
Where's the Cornelian here?

01:45:08.758 --> 01:45:10.299
How did we call it in Cornell?

01:45:10.319 --> 01:45:10.739
Do you remember?

01:45:10.759 --> 01:45:11.839
The co-op?

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.200
The co-op!

01:45:14.261 --> 01:45:15.041
Exactly!

01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:16.522
Why is this so annoying?

01:45:16.602 --> 01:45:18.442
Because vaccine is a word.

01:45:19.623 --> 01:45:21.424
Because transfection is a word.

01:45:23.086 --> 01:45:25.228
because autism is a word.

01:45:25.929 --> 01:45:48.289
And rather than having a nuanced discussion about whether these words are useful and how they might be made useful by honing the definition or having more specific definition of those words, they are willing to have discussions with each other about the pronunciation of acronyms for chemicals and the pronunciation for apoptosis.

01:45:51.917 --> 01:46:02.744
It's remarkable, the pronunciation of a four-letter English word missing a hyphen that's actually short for another word that these people are too dumb to know, apparently.

01:46:02.764 --> 01:46:04.224
Prompter, look.

01:46:05.245 --> 01:46:06.546
We called it the co-op, right?

01:46:06.566 --> 01:46:08.787
And there was no hyphen either, so it just varies.

01:46:08.847 --> 01:46:09.328
And one more.

01:46:09.348 --> 01:46:11.069
This is my favorite.

01:46:11.329 --> 01:46:12.249
Programmed cell death.

01:46:12.289 --> 01:46:13.010
How do you say that?

01:46:14.193 --> 01:46:15.234
It's the A word, right?

01:46:15.354 --> 01:46:16.334
A-P-O-P-T.

01:46:17.334 --> 01:46:18.875
Do you know program cell death?

01:46:18.895 --> 01:46:20.996
No, no, I'm just an ignorant virologist.

01:46:21.056 --> 01:46:21.796
How do you pronounce it?

01:46:21.816 --> 01:46:22.357
Autophagy?

01:46:25.878 --> 01:46:28.259
Okay, nice guy.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.120
Do you know what program cell death is?

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:32.881
Oh, I'm going to say it wrong.

01:46:34.262 --> 01:46:36.383
I've always said apoptosis.

01:46:41.849 --> 01:46:43.891
Yeah, that's how I say it, but I used to say it.

01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:45.251
What about you, Ben?

01:46:45.312 --> 01:46:48.974
I also say it that way, but I've heard Horvitz say apoptosis.

01:46:49.054 --> 01:46:51.456
Apoptosis, yeah.

01:46:51.556 --> 01:46:52.857
Who says apoptosis?

01:46:56.779 --> 01:47:04.426
I say it all the time, and I co-authored this virology textbook, and they excoriated me for saying apoptosis.

01:47:04.446 --> 01:47:06.789
They said, you're so unsophisticated to say that.

01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:11.753
So I got shamed into saying apoptosis, but now I have the whole room behind me now, apoptosis.

01:47:12.054 --> 01:47:13.315
Because it's a helicopter.

01:47:13.895 --> 01:47:17.617
What's really funny about that is that it's almost like these people don't speak English.

01:47:30.023 --> 01:47:32.164
They don't understand how words are said.

01:47:32.924 --> 01:47:41.428
It's kind of frustrating in a way because when a word is a word, its syllables are all said together with one syllable being accented.

01:47:41.468 --> 01:47:42.968
That's the general rule.

01:47:43.429 --> 01:47:46.650
I understand that in some languages there is no accent.

01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:58.695
Like in Norway, in Norwegian there are some words and some names that contain syllables with no accent and you can't say them because you can't hear that because you're trained to hear an accent.

01:47:59.437 --> 01:48:04.239
And so if we do apoptosis, it's not a-pop-tosis.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.621
It's apoptosis.

01:48:07.081 --> 01:48:11.143
You say the word, and the accent is the only thing you can change.

01:48:11.283 --> 01:48:15.145
And if you go a-pop-tosis, you are not saying a word anymore.

01:48:15.165 --> 01:48:19.347
You're saying three syllables separate, and you sound like a dumbass.

01:48:21.621 --> 01:48:30.291
It doesn't have to that you can hear every single little consonant separate from every other vowel and that's not how language works.

01:48:32.734 --> 01:48:35.778
That's why we have consonant blends and stuff like that.

01:48:35.818 --> 01:48:37.500
You know, this is just so dumb.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.443
This discussion is so revealing.

01:48:41.155 --> 01:48:44.116
for the kinds of things that these people would waste their time on.

01:48:44.196 --> 01:48:45.777
Now wait till you hear where it goes.

01:48:45.817 --> 01:48:50.239
And I've only got about five minutes, and then I'm going to go blank.

01:48:50.259 --> 01:48:54.080
We'll pronounce a word, and then Kathy Spindler will say, that's not the way you pronounce it.

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:55.741
Or that's wrong.

01:48:55.761 --> 01:48:56.921
I think that's a lot of fun.

01:48:56.941 --> 01:48:57.562
It illustrates.

01:48:58.382 --> 01:49:02.003
Remember, this is a program for non-scientists as well as scientists.

01:49:02.063 --> 01:49:04.444
And it just illustrates how flimsy science is.

01:49:04.805 --> 01:49:04.885
OK.

01:49:05.945 --> 01:49:12.114
flimsy science is because people don't know how to pronounce words because they have dumb mentors?

01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:13.076
Like, wow.

01:49:14.197 --> 01:49:17.322
Anyway, those are my memories from retreat.

01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:19.164
So thank you again for inviting me.

01:49:21.563 --> 01:49:24.225
And you became diploid.

01:49:24.265 --> 01:49:25.586
I became diploid, yes.

01:49:26.087 --> 01:49:31.091
But the point of my story is that when it came to argument, Harvard Mass General.

01:49:31.211 --> 01:49:32.051
Making my way to the.

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:33.993
As far as ways, like I'm.

01:49:34.013 --> 01:49:34.513
Sure.

01:49:35.094 --> 01:49:36.115
What you know goes on.

01:49:37.115 --> 01:49:39.838
Well, I don't know exactly what goes on, but I have a few graduate students.

01:49:39.858 --> 01:49:43.981
So if Giancarlo or Lamont or JC want to weigh in, they can.

01:49:45.122 --> 01:49:47.083
I absolutely believe that there are.

01:49:48.328 --> 01:49:49.449
this belief in infection.

01:49:49.489 --> 01:50:11.190
Some of the most pressing viral that we're interested in trying to understand is once you make an immune response to a particular pathogen, how does that pathogen, very interested in trying to understand is what is the way that our immune system sees a pathogen and how antibodies are made to it and how can we use that information to potentially guide next generation viral vaccines.

01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:20.315
Is it possible that the Harvard, the head of the Virology Institute at Harvard is still working on how the body decides to produce antibodies?

01:50:21.615 --> 01:50:22.436
Is it possible?

01:50:23.176 --> 01:50:31.340
Because I think how the body produces antibodies is a window into the illusion of the Human Genome Project.

01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:38.284
I think that Susumu Tonigawa's discovery and awarding of the Nobel Prize, he's now a neuroscientist, Susumu.

01:50:42.188 --> 01:50:46.050
That discovery is a window into how genes work.

01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:58.955
And these people are set on having you believe that is a very unique aspect of the B cell aspect of the subunits of the organism of the immune system, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:51:00.336 --> 01:51:03.057
I kind of stumbled through that because I was just improvising.

01:51:03.117 --> 01:51:07.079
But really, I think what he wants you to believe is that the

01:51:08.257 --> 01:51:29.331
way that antibodies are produced is a very interesting and hard to understand mechanism that we should spend all our time trying to understand when in reality it is a microcosm example of how genes are expressed throughout the body in every cell type for every enzyme and every functional protein.

01:51:30.245 --> 01:51:37.689
And that oversight is an illusion that he doesn't understand because he's not a sophisticated biologist.

01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:39.370
He's a gunner.

01:51:41.612 --> 01:51:43.833
He's on a script that he doesn't even understand.

01:51:45.534 --> 01:51:46.514
And it's Bad Biology 101.

01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:51.351
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm getting really excited because I can feel the momentum building.

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:52.671
We're going to be able to break this.

01:51:53.171 --> 01:51:54.732
We're going to be able to break it hard.

01:51:55.092 --> 01:51:55.932
It's going to be fun.

01:51:56.032 --> 01:52:01.633
It's going to be like a karate chop through a whole set of boards or a whole set of bricks.

01:52:01.713 --> 01:52:02.674
It's going to be ugly.

01:52:03.134 --> 01:52:05.694
And it's not going to be even like, this is great.

01:52:06.134 --> 01:52:15.737
But this is nothing like what we're going to do to the Human Genome Project and the illusion of the genome itself, the concept of a genome, and what it does or doesn't do.

01:52:15.797 --> 01:52:17.217
You know the central dogma?

01:52:17.777 --> 01:52:21.518
We are going to destroy it over the next couple months.

01:52:22.058 --> 01:52:24.319
Enjoy it while it lasts, ladies and gentlemen.

01:52:24.779 --> 01:52:27.340
This is an ongoing book writing session.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:34.662
Starting tomorrow, the book writing will begin with what will be called the History of Pseudobiology 432.

01:52:35.062 --> 01:52:39.123
It is one of the three courses that I'm gonna start teaching.

01:52:39.483 --> 01:52:44.705
We're gonna start with History of Pseudobiology because it's the one that needs the most study halls.

01:52:45.405 --> 01:52:51.947
And we'll start with David Baltimore, because he's the recent addition to the pantheon of these people.

01:52:51.967 --> 01:52:53.207
I'm really excited about it.

01:52:54.407 --> 01:53:00.889
Don't forget that using their test to find their ghost doesn't make you a Ghostbuster, because this is about all the marbles.

01:53:00.949 --> 01:53:02.669
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:53:02.710 --> 01:53:03.450
Thanks for being here.

01:53:03.490 --> 01:53:04.430
I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:53:06.434 --> 01:53:09.116
Yeah, it's not the red pill.

01:53:09.316 --> 01:53:10.457
It's not the blue pill.

01:53:11.758 --> 01:53:15.081
It is the green pill, ladies and gentlemen, the green pill.

01:53:15.601 --> 01:53:16.402
That's the answer.

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:19.404
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:53:19.444 --> 01:53:20.905
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:53:20.945 --> 01:53:23.767
Transfection is an old technology and RNA can't do that.

01:53:24.247 --> 01:53:25.108
Thanks for being here.

01:53:26.089 --> 01:53:28.331
You are trapped in a social media

01:53:29.091 --> 01:53:30.653
National Security Theater.

01:53:31.153 --> 01:53:32.615
And one way out is PeerTube.

01:53:32.655 --> 01:53:40.003
You can download the PeerTube app and then enter in the URL stream.gigom.bio and Bob's your uncle.

01:53:40.563 --> 01:53:41.244
Thanks for being here.

01:53:41.264 --> 01:53:41.765
See you tomorrow.
