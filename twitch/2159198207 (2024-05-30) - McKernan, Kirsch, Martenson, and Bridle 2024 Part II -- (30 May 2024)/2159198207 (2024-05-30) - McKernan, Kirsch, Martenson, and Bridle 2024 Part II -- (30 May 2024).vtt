Oh, man.

09:35.228 --> 09:35.888
Oh, darn it.

09:36.028 --> 09:38.109
Anyway, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

09:38.129 --> 09:43.249
Let's spend a little more time dispelling this enchantment, trying to get to understand the illusion a little better.

09:43.690 --> 09:45.250
This is GigaOM Biological.

09:45.470 --> 09:50.231
We are trying to follow in the steps of people who called it like they saw it.

09:51.151 --> 10:00.312
We live in very interesting times, and there's lots of ways to become distracted from the truth, because indeed, your consciousness has been prime real estate for some time.

10:01.113 --> 10:03.313
And so in trying to break free,

10:05.693 --> 10:07.194
Often panic has been induced.

10:07.234 --> 10:11.035
We're trying to be a little more calm about it here on GigaOM Biological.

10:12.135 --> 10:18.777
And I hope you can appreciate that really what we perceive to be true is all that has ever mattered to these people.

10:19.658 --> 10:22.559
And that's what makes it so, so darn dangerous.

10:30.751 --> 10:37.253
dangerous, that these fundamental ideas still really aren't spreading like the wildfire that they should be.

10:38.993 --> 10:44.034
And I think these ideas need to spread like wildfire.

10:45.495 --> 10:47.955
And we need to stop making it too complicated.

10:48.435 --> 10:59.378
Fifth Generation Warfare is just a group of people that is spectacularly committed to telling a tale, a mythology, lies.

11:01.710 --> 11:16.716
And the way that they get away with it is because they have also convinced us over the last few years or more that attributing bad motives to those we disagree with is a legitimate way of arguing, a legitimate way of having a debate.

11:17.896 --> 11:30.081
And while you might think that, ah, this is just in politics or this is just in advertising, no, ladies and gentlemen, it has become also something that essentially has replaced whatever used to be called debate

11:33.465 --> 11:46.327
And I think you're going to be very interested to know or to realize or to sense the role that this slide here in particular might have in the narrative that we're going to present today.

11:46.827 --> 11:50.948
And you're thinking, what narrative are you talking about now, Mr. Cooey?

11:51.008 --> 11:55.469
Well, I'm about to show you something that you may not have seen before.

11:55.509 --> 11:58.489
And it may change the way that you see other things now.

11:59.409 --> 12:01.310
And that's really what learning is all about.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.310
It's about adding

12:03.530 --> 12:20.587
adding knowledge which you can you can count on and I would argue that the things that these people are collecting and claiming is knowledge is actually not as high fidelity as they want you to believe and that means most of their their

12:21.843 --> 12:24.745
Their claims are actually charlatanism.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.406
They are snake oil.

12:27.107 --> 12:31.890
And if we learn our history, we're going to find out that our history is a lot of snake oil too.

12:32.571 --> 12:40.937
The biology and the foundations on which a lot of this molecular biology is based, the fidelity has been exaggerated.

12:43.790 --> 12:55.122
Our progress has been exaggerated in many domains, and it's been exaggerated because mentors have mentored students who have mentored other students, and that's where we are.

12:55.222 --> 13:05.473
Basically, we have inherited these charlatans from our parents, and these parents have inherited their power from their mentors.

13:06.897 --> 13:10.359
So the people that they learned from are the scary ones.

13:10.520 --> 13:16.524
The people that these people have learned from and the people that we are being told are the dissidents.

13:18.285 --> 13:21.107
These are the people that we need to learn the history of.

13:22.508 --> 13:31.234
And then we need to pass that history accurately onto our children so that we can make gentle the life of this world as we transition away from their mythology.

13:32.519 --> 13:59.020
That's the plan here in America, at least, is to transition away from their mythology in a peaceful and growing experience for us and our families and our communities so that this wave of lies that has been manufactured and is threatening to sweep our communities over the coming years and sweep our children through our schools and through the media and social media and their phones

14:00.253 --> 14:04.659
that we instead learn, teach our children to see it and surf on it.

14:09.345 --> 14:11.388
And I'm really, really, really excited.

14:11.408 --> 14:11.848
Yeah.

14:14.844 --> 14:19.268
So if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave, where we stay focused on the biology.

14:19.328 --> 14:21.650
We don't take their bait on social media.

14:22.190 --> 14:23.732
And we definitely love our neighbors.

14:23.832 --> 14:29.337
If not, maybe you're a skilled TV watcher in need of a life preserver, in need of a surfboard.

14:29.997 --> 14:37.183
And, well, you're in the right place, because this is the place where a lot of people have been

14:39.305 --> 14:45.189
you know, slipped through the net, so to speak, and actually found GigaOM Biological through someone else.

14:46.330 --> 15:04.502
Usually this doesn't happen, and that's why you can see that I still only have 3,100 followers on Twitch and about 14,000 followers on Twitter, because linear growth is linear growth, and programmed growth is something entirely different.

15:07.143 --> 15:08.604
And this is just linear growth.

15:08.664 --> 15:11.986
This is like, you know, old school email chains and that's about it.

15:14.988 --> 15:15.568
That's about it.

15:26.534 --> 15:31.397
We had a family night the other day to go see the last Planet of the Apes in the movie theater.

15:33.789 --> 15:35.770
We added extra pain to that.

15:35.870 --> 15:40.271
It wasn't really pain, but movie theater going can be very painful.

15:40.851 --> 15:55.216
Um, the movie theater that we go to in Pittsburgh is kind of old and I don't want to be too pessimistic, but the chairs are pretty old and the seats have been sat in a lot and by people heavier than me.

15:55.316 --> 15:57.437
And so whatever, um,

15:58.462 --> 16:01.964
But we accidentally went half an hour early because we had the schedule wrong.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.905
And that's really pain you don't want to add at the movie theater nowadays.

16:04.965 --> 16:10.047
Ladies and gentlemen, this illusion is sustained through your active participation.

16:10.107 --> 16:12.929
That means you can choose to let go of the rope whenever you want to.

16:14.189 --> 16:21.475
As Dan Cohen yesterday so eloquently said, we've got to drop some of these ropes that we've been enticed to pull on.

16:22.336 --> 16:29.702
And the way to do that is informing yourself and then you can engage in informed noncompliance and stop pulling the rope.

16:30.602 --> 16:32.163
That's what we want to try and do here today.

16:35.635 --> 16:35.975
do do

16:59.218 --> 17:00.660
Good morning, everybody.

17:00.780 --> 17:05.604
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

17:05.705 --> 17:11.310
It is the 30th of May and I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as usual, in the back of my garage.

17:12.191 --> 17:16.435
It's a really pretty day out, but it was like eight degrees last night, Celsius.

17:16.976 --> 17:19.178
I only know that because my wife told me this morning.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.160
Otherwise, I'd probably tell you it was like

17:22.255 --> 17:24.177
45 degrees or 48 degrees last night.

17:25.918 --> 17:31.062
And our little chickens, I left them open so they had their first taste of some chilly weather.

17:32.043 --> 17:34.344
Which was, I don't know, it was funny.

17:34.625 --> 17:35.265
They're fine though.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.347
They look like they're no worse for the wear.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.409
Welcome to the show.

17:39.489 --> 17:56.688
I'm very happy to have you here Thursdays are usually a throwback Thursday kind of thing But I had this show that I started day before yesterday yesterday I had a gentleman by the name of Dan Cohen on and I have been in contact with Dan for a while and we have

17:58.149 --> 18:12.772
kind of this standing project that he had going that I had agreed to help with at some point that I never really helped with because of the timing of books and movies and not for me, but him and books for me and

18:13.513 --> 18:14.433
and yada, yada, yada.

18:15.414 --> 18:16.134
We're here now.

18:16.874 --> 18:18.415
We had a great show yesterday.

18:18.475 --> 18:22.596
If you didn't see it, it's a really insightful discussion.

18:24.017 --> 18:42.304
One of the bigger messages to come out of it that I think is gonna get into everybody's, in between everybody's teeth in a painful way is that one of the issues that grinds everybody's gears when it comes to Israel and Judaism and the past and the future and Palestine and all this other stuff

18:43.244 --> 18:49.806
is the idea that it is a Jewish conversation about Zionism and what Zionism is and isn't.

18:50.787 --> 19:00.470
And so I'm not going to try and reiterate that now, but that's what I think Dan did a pretty good job of covering in that podcast, even though in retrospect he says that he wasn't

19:01.030 --> 19:03.951
firing on all cylinders because he missed his coffee or something like that.

19:03.991 --> 19:05.592
So we'll probably have to have him on again.

19:05.612 --> 19:18.176
And what I think is significant about that episode in case I probably have it queued up, sorry, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

19:18.616 --> 19:23.298
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

19:24.599 --> 19:35.574
Yesterday, we had Dan Cohen on, and we were trying to get another aspect of this illusion of consensus model of thought control and habit control, question control.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.079
And I thought that he did a very good job of also admitting

19:40.700 --> 19:52.107
that when I had shown a clip at the beginning from the Jimmy Dore podcast that he was on about eight months ago, and he felt really like his understanding had significantly evolved.

19:52.528 --> 20:02.994
And more importantly, as I expressed in the beginning of the show, his ability to express his understanding of it has evolved in such a way that he wished he had another shot at that.

20:03.615 --> 20:06.777
And how he said it on my podcast, I think was a little better.

20:06.797 --> 20:08.458
Our broadcast was a little better.

20:08.898 --> 20:11.502
And he was a little happier with it, at least he had another shot at it.

20:11.702 --> 20:14.906
So please, if you haven't seen it after this show, check that out.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.229
It's worth watching or listening to.

20:17.810 --> 20:22.997
I think it's really, at least it brought me to a more sophisticated

20:25.094 --> 20:26.775
perception of understanding.

20:26.835 --> 20:28.595
I'm sure that I still don't get it.

20:29.035 --> 20:38.518
And maybe even he's still doesn't get it, but it's a more sophisticated understanding than whatever the PBS NewsHour has been trying to give me.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.499
And admittedly, that's part of the...

20:55.156 --> 20:59.340
That's part of the reason why I think this throwback part of this show will be nice.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.402
Now remember, we did this two days ago.

21:02.423 --> 21:15.956
We got through about 17 minutes of the video, and in that video, if we look back in the notes, what we see is that McKernan and Bridle, and I guess I have to fold this over, don't I?

21:18.103 --> 21:18.763
This should work.

21:20.104 --> 21:23.386
They started with the idea that DNA is potentially dangerous.

21:23.466 --> 21:28.369
Kevin's got the data, is what Byron Bridle said at the beginning.

21:28.389 --> 21:37.394
Health Canada has confirmed some of this data and specifically confirmed that the SV40 is a bioactive sequence and that shouldn't be present.

21:38.155 --> 21:40.976
David Speaker confirmed this.

21:42.677 --> 21:46.038
And so since it wasn't disclosed, this is a rules violation.

21:46.459 --> 21:57.763
They say things like it's there in the vials, it's present in the vaxed or in the injured vaxed with not so much evidence, but they do say that there are papers, so there could be, and I need to look that up yet and follow up.

21:57.803 --> 21:59.883
I'm assuming they're in the notes of this video.

22:01.704 --> 22:11.771
But specifically, I noted that Kevin McKernan said mammalian transfection, he said willful misconduct, not criminal negligence, but willful misconduct.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.532
And that could be

22:13.991 --> 22:15.132
the more precise term.

22:15.172 --> 22:20.196
I think we would need somebody like, I don't know, a lawyer or something like that to confirm that.

22:20.236 --> 22:21.777
I've never said I'm a lawyer.

22:21.817 --> 22:23.678
I hope you don't think I've ever said that.

22:24.379 --> 22:29.163
Transfection vehicle is also something that Kevin McKernan said in those first 17 minutes.

22:29.743 --> 22:38.190
And then Byron Bridle was allowed to basically explain how Health Canada has admitted everything needed to recall these shots, but hasn't recalled them.

22:38.670 --> 22:39.050
And so,

22:41.269 --> 22:49.070
So one assumption might be that they're assuming that theirs wasn't contaminated, but that's not true because according to them earlier, this guy confirmed that it was.

22:49.991 --> 22:53.091
So just one lie equals liar.

22:53.431 --> 23:00.892
I don't remember exactly what that was from, but I presume it's because they've used the language that this is a big lie and it's not the big lie, right?

23:00.933 --> 23:04.613
There's another big lie that came before this one, otherwise we wouldn't have believed this one.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.394
And so then there's lots of theoretical ways and they use the sequence,

23:09.554 --> 23:11.815
the word choice, this sequence, a lot.

23:11.995 --> 23:26.459
Again, referring backwards to the sequence of SV40, which Kevin McKernan took some time to detail how, although they had well annotated their plasmid, they had, he alleges, left, and I guess the documents confirm this, alleges that this

23:27.119 --> 23:27.840
this is out.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.562
So, they didn't put this in there even though they could have.

23:30.602 --> 23:33.964
It's not that they didn't take it out of the sequence and not report it.

23:34.364 --> 23:38.847
It's just that they didn't annotate it as an SV40 sequence when they could have.

23:39.468 --> 23:50.436
And that one of the arguments that Kevin makes to support this is that if you throw this plasmid sequence into any number of plasmid characterizing

23:51.906 --> 24:00.852
type programs, most if not all of them will identify SV40 as one of the first or default sequences that it's always looking for.

24:01.413 --> 24:20.086
And this would be, and this is not something that they said in those 17 minutes, but this would be because SV40 is such a ubiquitously used promoter sequence in this, what they are now calling process two, but really should just be called standard operating procedure, recombinant bacterial plasmid

24:20.726 --> 24:23.027
production of mass quantities of DNA.

24:24.828 --> 24:26.708
Because that's how you make antibodies.

24:26.728 --> 24:28.969
You start there, you make the RNA, you make the protein.

24:29.369 --> 24:43.455
Then you can clean the protein up because you can use things like anion exchange chromatography to pull all the nucleic acids out from and the proteins become pure.

24:44.315 --> 24:50.821
And then you use that same process to show that the proteins have no DNA or RNA in them.

24:50.861 --> 24:58.167
And that's one of the most expensive processes in producing a biologic like a monoclonal antibody.

24:58.207 --> 25:11.499
And in fact, whole batches of monoclonal antibodies are thrown out as opposed to running them through anion exchange chromatography again, because it's so expensive the first time you do it.

25:12.139 --> 25:14.822
Now, I don't know that from firsthand experience.

25:14.862 --> 25:20.649
I know that from talking to people who have worked in pharmaceuticals and know how the

25:22.751 --> 25:28.553
the economics of making one of these large batches or smaller batches of monoclonal antibodies works.

25:29.393 --> 25:45.758
And so this was all work that was inspired by the work that Mark Kulak did with regard to the antibody patent paradox law review article published in the Yale Law Review that was then cited by the Supreme Court in a decision in 2020 about the

25:47.418 --> 25:53.104
general state of intellectual property law as it concerns monoclonal antibody patents.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.828
And so this is a pretty significant thing, of course.

25:58.590 --> 26:09.361
And so in terms of talking about this sequence and framing it in the right way, given the experience level and background of Kevin McKernan,

26:10.061 --> 26:25.386
one of the nuggets of information that he could have offered up to clarify to people why such a sequence would be present that's associated with, I guess, a virus in simian animals or something, whatever SV40 means.

26:25.426 --> 26:32.789
I think it was just a tube of stuff, not necessarily a virus, the original name SV40.

26:33.249 --> 26:36.410
But Mark has done a lot more work on that than I have.

26:37.759 --> 26:59.730
My point is, is that they keep referring back to this sequence, this sequence, but we're not very clear and crystal clear about the fact that this sequence is ubiquitously present in any commercial plasmid that you were going to buy and design to express a protein, to grow something, to do whatever you were going to do in an academic bench setting.

27:00.490 --> 27:05.973
I would be willing to bet that the SV40 promoter would be one of the few things that

27:06.866 --> 27:22.495
Almost any bench scientist that occasionally uses commercial molecular biology to do some basic manipulation in their experiment would know that SV40 is a very common hot promoter if you just want to get a lot of something.

27:25.156 --> 27:32.180
And I think it would be important to say that if you wanted to emphasize the danger of this, this idea.

27:33.956 --> 27:47.400
Because instead of spreading another equally ubiquitously understood idea in academia like SB40, he could also be spreading very accurately that this was always transformation and transfection.

27:49.041 --> 27:52.322
And we always knew that this wouldn't work no matter how pure it was.

27:52.382 --> 27:56.963
But the fact that they used a process like this makes it much worse.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.564
And that's fine to say, but that's not what we're saying here.

28:00.705 --> 28:01.885
We're not saying that at all.

28:03.254 --> 28:15.050
And you can find tweets where Kevin McKernan specifically said in 2021 or 22 that we would be ashamed to throw out the baby with the bathwater with regard to this contamination.

28:16.448 --> 28:42.203
which is again, the exact bait and switch that I suggested they were going to do somehow with the spike protein already at the beginning of 2021, when this Nature paper came out and so dubiously presented our timeline of understanding of RNA and our timeline of understanding of lipid nanoparticles as progressing in parallel and meeting just in time to save us before the pandemic.

28:45.103 --> 28:54.712
And so the batches that were most contaminated were associated with most injury is, I believe, some kind of hand waving, but I don't know that for sure.

28:55.173 --> 29:00.078
Because remember, the only peer reviewed data that we've seen actually comes from Denmark.

29:01.319 --> 29:04.122
And that seemed to show that there was some injury rate.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.328
correlation with different batches that were used in Denmark.

29:08.909 --> 29:18.878
Now the question is whether or not we can call those placebo batches or not, or whether you're going to buy into the idea that they were handled differently or quality control was somehow different between those batches.

29:20.900 --> 29:31.103
I think this is all smoke and mirrors, again, to get you to run around and ask different questions instead of the main one, which is, wasn't transfection always criminally negligent?

29:31.563 --> 29:35.165
Because we knew that it would be terrible for healthy humans to be transfected.

29:35.205 --> 29:36.325
Isn't that totally true?

29:37.605 --> 29:42.667
But instead, what's likely happened is maybe different transfection vehicles, as he calls them,

29:45.182 --> 29:49.431
Maybe different transfection vehicles were used to

29:53.334 --> 29:54.815
and tested in different places.

29:54.875 --> 30:02.117
And that's what the batch correlations were, or maybe different doses of mRNA or different processes to make the mRNA.

30:02.137 --> 30:02.757
You see what I mean?

30:03.397 --> 30:05.178
All of these things could have been tested.

30:05.598 --> 30:16.922
And we would, in theory, never know because of all the proprietary layers of technology and patented things are involved in making lipid nanoparticle based transfections.

30:19.457 --> 30:25.021
And so remember that Chris Martinson is an FLCCC board member.

30:29.004 --> 30:32.846
And he says things like the vaccine injuries keep coming.

30:34.207 --> 30:38.190
This contaminant, the word this contaminant or this phrase contaminant is used.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.751
So I'm going to take a new page.

30:40.571 --> 30:41.972
And what I really want you to see

30:43.288 --> 30:51.430
is that Chris Martinson is an interesting character to have appeared on this show.

30:51.730 --> 30:54.571
So let me just escape to make sure I get it to play correctly.

30:58.372 --> 31:05.014
So remember the principle here is that the, yeah, it's cranking a little bit.

31:05.054 --> 31:05.774
I don't know why.

31:08.695 --> 31:09.615
Anyway, I hope this works.

31:11.792 --> 31:22.576
The spread of bad ideas being more dangerous than any RNA molecule is not only a catchphrase, it's something that you need to understand in multiple dimensions.

31:22.656 --> 31:38.481
Because as we hypothesize that a, insert your understanding here, background signal of RNA and DNA could easily be misconstrued as spread.

31:38.501 --> 31:38.981
What's wrong?

31:39.901 --> 31:40.102
Why?

31:42.017 --> 31:50.204
Why Yeah, but you can't open it Okay

31:57.659 --> 32:02.501
Sorry, so the spread of any RNA molecules, she's trying to organize health insurance.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.102
It's taken us like three months.

32:04.362 --> 32:05.342
It's crazy.

32:05.422 --> 32:10.584
I think it's because the health insurance system is being overloaded by all the people that have arrived.

32:11.544 --> 32:14.165
But you know, I'm not pessimistic or anything like that.

32:15.125 --> 32:21.309
The spread of bad ideas being more dangerous than any spread of any RNA molecule.

32:21.389 --> 32:26.872
Understand that these bad ideas needed to be seeded before the pandemic.

32:27.292 --> 32:32.916
And these people that presented it to us were seeded before the pandemic.

32:35.037 --> 32:38.800
Off the top of my head, I'm not exactly sure when this comes from.

32:39.041 --> 32:48.830
I think it's like 2012, maybe 2010, because they speak of 2008 as back then.

32:48.850 --> 32:52.132
It might've even been more extemporaneous.

32:52.173 --> 33:01.000
It could've been, I should really find out, but I'm afraid to open my browsers, because I think my browsers being open are some of the reasons why I occasionally go out of sync.

33:02.282 --> 33:04.844
And I don't know that for sure, but I'm just playing it safe here.

33:05.345 --> 33:17.857
Um, so let's watch this video keep in mind We're gonna start this video introducing him with Judy Woodruff Judy Woodruff is the person that was in that photograph from the late 80s or late 70s or early 80s with a

33:23.264 --> 33:49.490
Ted Turner, and Bill Gates' dad, and the head of the Annenberg Foundation, and well, Tom Brokaw, and it was just a very creepy old photograph of the same people who have been telling us the same stories for a very, very long time, and also the heads of some pretty huge weaponized piles of money.

33:50.882 --> 34:00.392
We don't even, I mean, there's so many weaponized piles of money that we don't really talk about when we talk about BlackRock and State Street and whatever else we talk about, and that's very dangerous.

34:01.413 --> 34:02.514
But again, it is the

34:05.523 --> 34:15.772
conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized opinions and habits of the masses that is most important in a democratic society.

34:15.812 --> 34:19.455
And that is Edward Bernays from 1922 already.

34:19.896 --> 34:30.926
And so with the advent of the internet, they have been able to convince us that there was a novel virus that killed a million people.

34:32.438 --> 34:44.360
Now think very carefully about this being seeded and people being put in place like Brett Weinstein and his brother and Joe Rogan and all these people being put in place earlier than they were needed.

34:45.598 --> 34:54.427
maybe with different stories and under different circumstances, influenced or egged on by different people, encouraged by different people.

34:54.467 --> 34:58.711
Maybe the sources of comfort and encouragement came from different directions.

34:58.771 --> 35:04.296
But in the end, all of these people were put in place before the pandemic.

35:05.259 --> 35:10.821
and ready to go at the start of the pandemic when they were going to be needed as the script rolled out.

35:11.021 --> 35:15.882
And in real time, this operation, this limited spectrum of debate was controlled.

35:16.423 --> 35:20.864
Consider, consider this throwback Thursday video, please.

35:21.328 --> 35:24.892
This is the week where Congress appears ready to pass a new budget.

35:25.312 --> 35:32.799
While there's relief among many to see some kind of agreement, the size of the country's debt and deficit remains a major concern.

35:33.300 --> 35:45.032
And that brings us to our closing story tonight, a profile of a popular economic forecaster whose concerns about those issues and the direction of the economy has inspired him to change his life.

35:45.572 --> 35:52.624
NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman has a report, part of his ongoing series, Making Sense of Financial News.

35:56.499 --> 36:02.945
Meet Chris Martenson, author, speaker, and consultant to organizations ranging from the U.N.

36:03.165 --> 36:06.108
to corporations, investment funds, and foundations.

36:06.969 --> 36:16.878
With his video crash course on the economy, pulling more than three million views on YouTube, he's become a popular symbol of deep economic discontent.

36:19.747 --> 36:32.578
In 2003, Martinson, a PhD neuroscientist with an MBA, was a high-level big pharma executive with all the perks, big salary, big boat, big house in Connecticut.

36:33.339 --> 36:40.145
But increasingly, he worried about the cost of big government, paid for by America's annual deficits,

36:40.643 --> 36:42.926
hiking our cumulative national debt.

36:59.386 --> 37:09.094
Maybe a bit more highly produced, of course, because he already was doing a podcast and sustaining his life with a podcast before the pandemic started.

37:09.134 --> 37:13.397
He already got promoted on PBS NewsHour before the pandemic started.

37:14.278 --> 37:14.498
Huh.

37:15.459 --> 37:21.383
And he was a pharma executive who decided to, and then the PBS NewsHour is promoting him.

37:21.403 --> 37:21.864
Hmm.

37:22.604 --> 37:25.366
Now before the pandemic, I would have thought, wow, that's really cool.

37:25.406 --> 37:25.907
Good for him.

37:28.117 --> 37:51.667
But now that I'm a little bit more aware of how I've been manipulated my whole adult life, I think, wow, so really, this guy who appears in a video with Kevin McKernan and Byron Bridle and Steve Kirsch is actually a guy who the PBS NewsHour promoted as an insightful alternative economic opinion in America before the pandemic.

37:52.988 --> 37:57.450
And he is on the FLCCC, like,

37:58.812 --> 38:12.661
executive committee, and he supports Steve Kirsch's VSRF, Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, that the Skoll Foundation also supports, that also supports the PBS NewsHour.

38:13.502 --> 38:19.245
And Steve Kirsch is one of the largest private donors to the Democratic National Committee.

38:19.305 --> 38:21.327
And what is going on here?

38:23.504 --> 38:37.737
Are all these pseudo-conservatives actually just part of this global narrative that is going to talk and has been slow rolling a controlled demolition of America?

38:38.217 --> 38:39.999
He's on the PBS NewsHour here.

38:43.010 --> 38:47.453
It's somewhere between 8 and 9 percent per year, and the underlying economy is about half that.

38:47.974 --> 38:50.696
If the whole nation does that, how does the nation not get in trouble?

38:51.116 --> 38:58.601
Of course, this is the Republican refrain of the moment, insisting it's why the debt ceiling shouldn't be automatically raised.

38:59.482 --> 39:09.770
But a decade ago, Martinson was already taking action, selling everything, easing out of his job, moving his family to rural Massachusetts.

39:10.322 --> 39:17.329
where he and his wife, Becca, would homeschool their children, all based on Chris' own dire economic forecast.

39:17.409 --> 39:26.918
I'm absolutely mathematically certain about this, that if we do not willingly, on our own terms as a nation, get our debt levels under control, eventually those chickens will come home to roost.

39:27.339 --> 39:30.682
In the decade that Chris and Becca have been tending their flock, though,

39:31.229 --> 39:40.668
Debt-bedeviled America has paid an effective interest rate of less than zero if you subtract inflation and the usual cost of borrowing money.

39:41.511 --> 39:49.714
So, after all these years, those worried about the risk of a debt collapse are sounding like, well, Chicken Little.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.714
Didn't you think that was already going to have happened?

39:53.475 --> 39:54.395
I think it has happened.

39:54.415 --> 39:55.535
I think it's happened in Detroit.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.076
I think it's happened in Stockton.

39:57.476 --> 40:07.479
When you look at the number of houses on food stamps, when you look at the mean duration of unemployment hovering between 30 and 40 weeks, which is hiding all the people at 99 weeks who got popped off of the rolls,

40:07.779 --> 40:09.340
Did I think it might happen a little faster?

40:09.400 --> 40:10.341
Yeah, absolutely.

40:10.661 --> 40:15.104
You take me from 10 years ago, drop me in this chair and tell me what the Federal Reserve's done in the last two years.

40:15.485 --> 40:17.886
My hair would catch on fire and I'd run out the door, right?

40:18.487 --> 40:21.769
Martinson means the Fed's creation of more than $2 trillion.

40:23.373 --> 40:28.334
But it hasn't just been the growth of government debt and dollars that spooked Chris Martinson.

40:28.934 --> 40:36.516
What differentiates him from the chorus of complaint we have been hearing lately is his rejection of economic growth itself.

40:36.936 --> 40:39.357
We have an economy that's based on growth.

40:39.557 --> 40:40.497
We want jobs to grow.

40:40.517 --> 40:42.378
We would like to see more auto sales next year.

40:42.418 --> 40:43.438
We want more houses sold.

40:44.398 --> 40:45.859
And it's always on a percentage basis.

40:46.060 --> 40:50.884
So even if our economy is growing at just 3% a year, we're going to be doubling it every 24 years.

40:51.484 --> 40:54.286
So how many more times can the world be twice as big?

40:54.727 --> 40:56.108
And when growth stops?

40:57.149 --> 41:10.280
Anticipating the financial turmoil that might follow, Martinson paid off all his debts, bought gold, and built a business, website, book, speaking engagements, sounding an alarm.

41:10.740 --> 41:14.321
that rejects most of how America has been going about its business.

41:14.901 --> 41:15.482
What is wealth?

41:16.862 --> 41:19.463
If I say wealth, sometimes people think money, but money is not wealth.

41:19.523 --> 41:21.143
It's a way to store wealth.

41:22.084 --> 41:27.005
Primary sources of wealth, that would be rich soils, a thick stand of trees, rich fishing waters.

41:27.045 --> 41:28.186
That's primary wealth.

41:28.546 --> 41:32.007
And, yes, the preacher puts his secular sermons into practice.

41:32.588 --> 41:37.549
With a vegetable garden and orchard for food, Chris has lost some 30 pounds.

41:37.889 --> 41:42.611
Preacher puts his secular sermons to practice.

41:45.151 --> 41:47.172
Ah, you demon.

41:48.032 --> 41:48.412
Darn it.

41:48.872 --> 41:49.192
Sorry.

41:49.212 --> 41:51.033
Gotta find where he is there.

41:52.813 --> 41:55.394
Nope.

41:55.794 --> 41:59.155
In the decade that Chris and Becca have been tending their flock, though,

41:59.710 --> 42:09.160
Debt-bedeviled America has paid an effective interest rate of less than zero if you subtract inflation and the usual cost of borrowing money.

42:09.981 --> 42:18.150
So, after all these years, those worried about the risk of a debt collapse are sounding like, well, Chicken Little.

42:18.670 --> 42:21.132
Didn't you think that was already going to have happened?

42:21.892 --> 42:22.813
I think it has happened.

42:22.833 --> 42:23.954
I think it's happened in Detroit.

42:24.314 --> 42:25.495
I think it's happened in Stockton.

42:25.915 --> 42:37.783
When you look at the number of houses on food stamps, when you look at the mean duration of unemployment hovering between 30 and 40 weeks, which is hiding all the people at 99 weeks who got popped off of the rolls, did I think it might happen a little faster?

42:37.843 --> 42:38.764
Yeah, absolutely.

42:39.104 --> 42:46.289
You take me from 10 years ago, drop me in this chair, and tell me what the Federal Reserve's done in the last two years, my hair would catch on fire and I'd run out the door, right?

42:46.889 --> 42:50.772
Martinson means the Fed's creation of more than $2 trillion.

42:51.793 --> 42:56.776
But it hasn't just been the growth of government debt and dollars that spooked Chris Martinson.

42:57.357 --> 43:04.942
What differentiates him from the chorus of complaint we have been hearing lately is his rejection of economic growth itself.

43:05.363 --> 43:07.784
We have an economy that's based on growth.

43:07.985 --> 43:08.945
We want jobs to grow.

43:08.965 --> 43:10.827

What is wealth?

43:45.269 --> 43:47.891

43:56.977 --> 44:00.440
And, yes, the preacher puts his secular sermons into practice.

44:01.001 --> 44:09.225
With a vegetable garden and orchard for food, Chris has lost some 30 pounds in the process, solar panels for comfort.

44:09.606 --> 44:12.527
These are the kinds of investments that make a lot of sense to me, because they're tangible.

44:12.567 --> 44:13.327
I understand them.

44:13.588 --> 44:17.930
It's different than sending my money off to Wall Street and crossing my fingers and hoping for the best.

44:18.210 --> 44:19.711
The hardest thing about the transition was

44:20.450 --> 44:25.615
explaining to people in my family, in my community what we were doing, because they really thought we were crazy.

44:25.635 --> 44:26.055
PAUL SOLMAN.

44:26.075 --> 44:28.757
At first, his wife thought Chris was crazy, too.

44:29.538 --> 44:31.880
But Becca Martinson began to study.

44:32.020 --> 44:35.383
What did you read that most impressed you or had the biggest impact on you?

44:35.905 --> 44:41.170
the book called The Creature from Jekyll Island, which describes our money system and how money is created.

44:41.210 --> 44:43.853
That was just such an eye-opener for me.

44:44.193 --> 44:48.358
So you hadn't realized that money was just created out of thin air?

44:48.718 --> 44:48.958
Nope.

44:49.238 --> 44:53.403
That is not something that is commonly known, really, in our culture.

44:53.483 --> 44:54.604
It's certainly not taught.

44:54.704 --> 44:55.585
It's not talked about.

44:55.945 --> 44:56.446
And it's true.

44:56.946 --> 45:04.651
Interesting that the PBS NewsHour guy says it as though, don't you know that money's created from thin air?

45:04.751 --> 45:06.052
That's no big deal.

45:06.773 --> 45:08.214
What are you, silly?

45:08.234 --> 45:13.177
I think that's an interesting take to notice that already.

45:13.237 --> 45:13.978
It's almost like,

45:15.078 --> 45:18.480
Um, they wanted the PBS NewsHour audience to feel dumb.

45:19.140 --> 45:23.002
Um, you know, like, and, and, oh, yeah, not very many people know, but I knew.

45:23.022 --> 45:24.382
Oh, yeah, I knew.

45:25.063 --> 45:25.763
Can you hear it?

45:26.363 --> 45:31.285
The people yelling at their screen, agreeing, yeah, I knew, that not very many people know that.

45:32.966 --> 45:36.228
Shoot, I was one of those people yelling at my screen like that, probably.

45:36.808 --> 45:41.410
It is true, but to many, a conventional economist, kind of trivial.

45:42.295 --> 45:46.700
But of course, to skeptics, the Fed is the so-called creature from Jekyll.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.362
That is not his current wife.

45:48.442 --> 45:54.208
No, I think they divorced before the pandemic or right at the beginning of the pandemic.

45:54.268 --> 45:54.989
I don't know when.

45:55.149 --> 45:55.990
You have to look that up.

45:56.050 --> 45:56.411
I don't know.

45:56.451 --> 45:59.374
But it's definitely not the woman that he now streamed with.

46:00.555 --> 46:01.777
I don't know who that is.

46:03.770 --> 46:04.150
Island.

46:04.931 --> 46:10.455
And, yes, money creation, without anything to restrain it, can run riot.

46:11.115 --> 46:14.838
Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe more recently.

46:15.618 --> 46:17.199
And so, even though U.S.

46:17.259 --> 46:23.283
inflation has remained but a blip for decades, it's easy to picture the worst.

46:23.563 --> 46:25.245
They are going to print a ton of money.

46:26.477 --> 46:32.980
So inflation is how you measure whether or not our debt is a problem, which is also weird, right?

46:33.020 --> 46:36.822
That's not very, it doesn't seem like very good economics to me.

46:36.862 --> 46:47.347
And now they're going to play this video that I bet a lot of us have already seen, and they're going to make fun of it, which is really scary how they do it because they actually don't say it's wrong.

46:48.007 --> 46:55.994
They just say it's silly or something like that listen carefully because as jay, uh as one of the people in the chat, I think it was

46:57.137 --> 47:10.049
The guy who starts with a J, Jason, pointed out this is a very creepy video if you think about it being pre-pandemic and now that guy being part of Steve Kirsch's little narrative network.

47:10.870 --> 47:20.499
And in fact, remember I told you on the show two days ago, he was also in that signal chat with me and Brett Weinstein and a few other people, which makes this even creepier.

47:22.800 --> 47:29.788
And I am going to be presenting at a conference organized by G. Edward Griffin in a few weeks, which is also weird.

47:30.449 --> 47:31.870
I don't even know what to say anymore.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.714
Our money system and how money is created.

47:35.054 --> 47:36.015
I don't doubt Edward.

47:36.055 --> 47:37.317
I'm just saying it's all.

47:37.737 --> 47:41.842
So you hadn't realized that money was just created out of thin air?

47:42.222 --> 47:46.928
Nope, that is not something that is commonly known, really, in our culture.

47:46.988 --> 47:50.012
It's certainly not taught, it's not talked about, and it's true.

47:50.612 --> 47:55.218
It is true, but to many a conventional economist, kind of trivial.

47:56.084 --> 48:01.028
But of course, to skeptics, the Fed is the so-called creature from Jekyll Island.

48:01.048 --> 48:01.528
There it is.

48:01.908 --> 48:07.412
And yes, money creation without anything to restrain it can run riot.

48:08.093 --> 48:09.794
Germany in the 1920s.

48:10.334 --> 48:11.015
Zimbabwe.

48:11.075 --> 48:13.136
Without anything to restrain it?

48:13.196 --> 48:14.457
What's restraining it now?

48:14.517 --> 48:15.258
I don't see that.

48:15.958 --> 48:17.860
That is an interesting statement.

48:19.335 --> 48:21.556
money printing without anything restraining.

48:21.616 --> 48:22.596
It is dangerous.

48:22.716 --> 48:25.456
So what's the implication in America?

48:25.476 --> 48:27.217
We've got restraints on it?

48:27.897 --> 48:29.057
Wow, right?

48:29.277 --> 48:29.737
Wow.

48:30.438 --> 48:32.098
See it, please see it.

48:32.258 --> 48:32.978
More recently.

48:33.778 --> 48:41.440
And so even though US inflation has remained but a blip for decades, it's easy to picture the worst.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.461
They are going to print a ton of money.

48:43.881 --> 48:48.722
Which may explain why this viral video mocking the Fed's policy

48:49.222 --> 48:53.526
has become perhaps the most popular economic explainer ever.

48:53.787 --> 48:55.949
Why do they call it the quantitative easing?

48:56.789 --> 48:58.851
Why don't they just call it the printing money?

48:59.232 --> 49:07.339
Because the printing money is the last refuge of failed economic empires and banana republics, and the Fed doesn't want to admit this is their only idea.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.981
The mass appeal of such

49:11.567 --> 49:18.910
I'm gonna play it again and now I want you to listen very carefully to the fact that the PBS NewsHour guy doesn't say that the video is wrong.

49:20.570 --> 49:23.751
That printing money is the last refuge of banana republics.

49:23.811 --> 49:25.652
He doesn't say that it's wrong.

49:26.192 --> 49:27.213
Listen carefully.

49:27.273 --> 49:33.075
Ladies and gentlemen, these people have been telling the masses exactly what's going on.

49:33.455 --> 49:35.436
And they started before the pandemic.

49:35.956 --> 49:39.317
That's why so many people have totally bought into this narrative.

49:41.559 --> 49:51.230
Which may explain why this viral video, mocking the Fed's policy, has become perhaps the most popular economic explainer ever.

49:51.471 --> 49:53.653
Why do they call it the quantitative easing?

49:54.474 --> 49:56.517
Why don't they just call it the printing money?

49:56.909 --> 50:05.014
because the printing money is the last refuge of failed economic empires and banana republics, and the Fed doesn't want to admit this is their only idea.

50:05.274 --> 50:11.358
The mass appeal of such skepticism may help explain right-wing budget intransigence today.

50:12.419 --> 50:16.982
But Chris and Becca Martinson are not simply austerity scolds or Fed-a-phobes.

50:17.002 --> 50:17.642
Fed-a-phobes?

50:18.503 --> 50:19.984
When it comes to what we should do,

50:20.882 --> 50:25.503
They sound like the small is beautiful crowd that flourished on the left in the 1970s.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.744
Whoa, that one's heavy.

50:28.404 --> 50:35.507
So the evangelist of hard money and small government also proselytizes for renewable energy.

50:35.907 --> 50:38.928
And if we deployed it, we would be burning less fossil fuels.

50:38.948 --> 50:40.708
Deploy it!

50:40.808 --> 50:42.749
Deploy it, says Chris Martinson.

50:42.829 --> 50:44.729
All of it could be domestically manufactured.

50:45.089 --> 50:49.651
When you talk to conservative audiences and you start talking about

50:50.991 --> 50:54.212
national investment in alternative energy.

50:55.413 --> 50:57.834
Don't they, at the very least, look at you funny?

50:57.854 --> 50:59.475
Oh, windmills, solar panels.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.275
Oh, absolutely.

51:00.495 --> 51:00.855
Awesome.

51:00.935 --> 51:01.395
Absolutely.

51:01.455 --> 51:02.436
But this is not a left-right issue.

51:02.456 --> 51:02.896
There's your answer.

51:02.916 --> 51:04.217
I don't take left-right positions.

51:04.657 --> 51:10.179
If it saves money, it creates jobs, it enhances national security, it's good for the environment, who could be against that?

51:10.299 --> 51:14.481
Well, people who think— See, people are now trying to be not on the left or the right.

51:14.521 --> 51:15.782
He was one of the pioneers.

51:15.822 --> 51:17.142
He was set up, probably.

51:17.322 --> 51:18.082
It's obvious.

51:18.543 --> 51:19.143
It's awful.

51:19.343 --> 51:23.306
I think that government should not be so involved in making decisions for us.

51:23.507 --> 51:32.354
But if, you know, the choice was, listen, we were going to print up $2.4 trillion and we were either going to give it to the banks or we were going to do something else with it, I think this would be something else.

51:32.595 --> 51:38.480
We will muddle through, but one thing we're not going to muddle through with is an exponential economy that needs more, more, more all the time.

51:38.940 --> 52:02.085
suppose you're wrong about the debt that guy wears that hat all the time though for like 20 years he's just a dork just that we're not on the right track if i had to give just maybe bald it's unsustainable in my own life i've cut my standard of living in half i've doubled my quality of life i'm not saying everybody should do that or i'm admirable because of it but i've learned he cut his standard in living in half but didn't he say that he was like a really successful

52:03.416 --> 52:05.617
Multi-millionaire with boats and stuff.

52:05.717 --> 52:07.477
So he cut his lifestyle in half.

52:07.518 --> 52:09.018
What did he get rid of his big yacht?

52:09.558 --> 52:11.899
Stop throwing parties and flying people in for them.

52:11.999 --> 52:13.039
What what does that mean?

52:16.721 --> 52:29.185
We're supposed to think that he went from you know Contributing to his community to really contributing to his community now No He didn't contribute to his community before and now he's not either now.

52:29.225 --> 52:30.826
He's even more off of it like

52:33.979 --> 52:54.397
I'm only reasonably sure I'm right in critiquing Chris Martinson because he was part of that signal chat with Brett Weinstein and myself where all of them basically were listening and asking, able to ask questions of me while I thought I was finally getting attention from people that mattered and none of them ever helped my family.

52:56.914 --> 53:04.820
It just basically helped them stay ahead of my ideas or to pass them on to other people, or I guess just figure out a way to keep me quiet.

53:07.081 --> 53:19.711
And if I gave you all the details of all the acting and nonsense that went on inside of that little signal chat that I'm almost positive was mostly for me, it's absolutely absurd.

53:21.832 --> 53:24.074
It's a yucky thing that's going on here.

53:25.279 --> 53:36.443
And keep in mind that that signal chat was three years ago and these two guys, Chris Martinson and Brett Weinstein were just recently down in Panama and came back with the big scoop on the invasion.

53:37.563 --> 53:38.964
And they're not doing anything about it.

53:39.704 --> 53:48.767
They just paraded around, Brett Weinstein paraded around this week that he had a success against great odds against the who this week and we should all be celebrating.

53:49.853 --> 53:56.998
read a Meryl Nass tweet live about celebrating the victory, popping champagne because we beat the who.

53:59.720 --> 54:06.946
They're all the same little network of people that's pretending to be conservative, patriots, bald eagles.

54:09.488 --> 54:11.349
I think they're playing us, ladies and gentlemen.

54:12.790 --> 54:18.995
I think it's very, very much worth considering that we may be being played and have been played for quite some time.

54:21.584 --> 54:45.916
And it is my privilege or my curse that a lot of these people, let me use the word, courted me during 2020 and 21, and the beginning of 22, and were unable to get me to stick to the novel virus killed millions, millions more were saved, probably came from a laboratory, therefore will come again theory.

54:48.477 --> 54:50.258
The harder they press, the farther I went.

54:52.896 --> 54:55.578
Now, for a lot of them, essentially, I'm a no-virus guy.

54:56.659 --> 54:59.761
And for a lot of the no-virus people, I'm just controlled opposition.

55:04.225 --> 55:14.493
How many of those people are trying to dissect our recent history in such a precise way to show you exactly how possible it is yet to see this history?

55:14.533 --> 55:15.533
It's still right there.

55:17.955 --> 55:21.278
And to do the work that Mark's doing, besides the time,

55:22.853 --> 55:30.677
is really just clever combination or whatever you call it, searches with more than one term.

55:31.337 --> 55:36.620
I'm not trying to take anything away from the excellent work that Mark does, but Mark makes the argument himself.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.261
He wants more people to be doing it.

55:39.741 --> 55:47.525
You think Mark wants to be the guy that says, you know, if you were going to kill a million people, you wouldn't just kill them and put them in an oven.

55:49.186 --> 55:51.327
You'd use them first for something smart.

55:54.773 --> 56:09.547
And if you were gonna transfect a billion people around the world for a pandemic that didn't exist, you're not just gonna do it, you're gonna do it with some degree of precision so that you can learn something from it.

56:10.925 --> 56:24.635
at least in certain places where it's possible, where the database is present, where the infrastructure is there, or where the legislative structure can allow you to implement it secretly under the pretense of a national security operation.

56:26.837 --> 56:43.343
And that national security operation involves people that were put in place before the pandemic to be present and ready to curate the limited spectrum of debate that would be necessary to trick the whole world into trying to solve the mystery of a lab leak virus.

56:45.802 --> 57:09.696
And I think that Chris Martinson might have been put in place very early as one of these forward thinkers that can see around the corners so that when the virus was declared present, that people like him in different corners of the internet would already be in place to have a pretty good idea of what would be said and already have a pretty good idea that if they said what they were told,

57:10.396 --> 57:32.236
that their star would rise, not because of spontaneous algorithmic results, but from carefully pre-programmed, you know, behavior of the social platforms and carefully orchestrated pseudo-censorship, which all of these people claim, of course.

57:33.137 --> 57:33.938
I got censored.

57:35.089 --> 57:36.770
I can't do this on YouTube anymore.

57:37.211 --> 57:38.992
Before the pandemic, I was on YouTube.

57:39.052 --> 57:40.573
Now I can't be on YouTube anymore.

57:41.534 --> 57:42.595
Very common claim.

57:44.597 --> 57:45.918
Let's let this go.

57:46.078 --> 57:48.420
Sorry, it's almost done.

57:48.940 --> 57:53.184
We can do things far more efficiently and effectively and have better outcomes.

57:53.764 --> 57:54.885
And why wouldn't we do that?

57:55.445 --> 58:02.911
In the end, Chris Martinson may be just another economic doomsayer with an enthusiastic online following.

58:03.800 --> 58:28.785
But his popularity and his voicing of the disaffections of Americans right and left alike suggests he may instead be a wishful throwback to the American tradition of simple self-reliance in the face of an ever more complex, impersonal global economy, an economy that could turn out to be unsustainable.

58:30.964 --> 58:32.685
Could turn out to be unsustainable.

58:32.785 --> 58:33.545
Interesting, huh?

58:33.725 --> 58:40.228
Let's, let me just, let me just see if we can see when that, it was PBS News.

58:40.468 --> 58:41.689
I don't want to use my browser.

58:41.729 --> 58:50.653
Can you just look, really, you just have to look Chris Martinson, PBS News, and it'll come up and then you can find out when that video was.

58:50.833 --> 58:51.914
I would really like to know.

58:53.515 --> 58:58.657
Anyway, so this limited spectrum of debate is curated by these people.

58:58.717 --> 58:59.898
And so I want to watch that.

59:00.882 --> 59:02.183
And check this out.

59:06.148 --> 59:07.709
I want to put that up now.

59:08.130 --> 59:10.712
And I think I have that here, actually.

59:10.732 --> 59:15.097
I can save this really quick just to make sure I do that.

59:15.137 --> 59:16.518
And then I'm going to play this video.

59:17.459 --> 59:18.821
This one over here, this video.

59:19.551 --> 59:20.452
Yeah, that's one.

59:20.472 --> 59:28.482
And I'm going to play it fast 1.7 speed to get through the first 17 minutes, which I think is important to hear.

59:28.522 --> 59:30.224
And if it's too fast, that's too bad.

59:30.665 --> 59:36.572
And then we'll start taking notes on on the video after that, because there are some interesting topics that they cover.

59:37.193 --> 59:44.624
Which I think from a biological perspective, we can point out kind of how uniquely focused they are on certain things.

59:45.385 --> 59:46.908
So here goes nothing.

59:47.449 --> 59:50.273
It might be a little loud, so I'm going to jack this down a little bit.

59:51.718 --> 59:52.438
Hi, Steve Kirsch here.

59:52.498 --> 59:55.199
I'm here with Dr. Kevin McKernan and Professor Byron Bridle.

59:55.839 --> 59:59.660
We're talking about this plasmid contamination in the vaccines.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:00.881
And I've got a lot of questions.

01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:01.801
I think you probably have a lot of questions.

01:00:01.821 --> 01:00:03.881
We're going to go through them with these experts and get your questions answered.

01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:09.623
And I'm going to try to start with kind of the most serious and the ones that are on most people's minds, which is, you know, the press isn't making a big deal of this.

01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:10.683
The community is not in arms.

01:00:10.703 --> 01:00:14.825
Nobody's calling for the stoppage of these vaccines because the experts say there's nothing to see here.

01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:17.627
And so there's nothing to worry about.

01:00:18.187 --> 01:00:20.168
So let's start off with that because that's the elephant in the room.

01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:24.510
Because when I talked to Kevin and Byram about this, they say that this is very serious.

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.311
You cannot write this off.

01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:28.432
And that these so-called experts, that they're saying there's nothing to see here.

01:00:28.452 --> 01:00:29.313
It's all based on speculation.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.394
And this could be extremely, extremely serious.

01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:32.855
Is that correct, gentlemen?

01:00:33.835 --> 01:00:34.496
You want to start?

01:00:35.056 --> 01:00:36.278
Sure, yeah, you're 100% correct, Steve.

01:00:37.519 --> 01:00:55.858
We don't have, you know, Kevin and the others who have been directly producing this, these data, right, Kevin, Kevin made this discovery, lots of other labs have confirmed it, they, I mean, we're lacking the data to definitively state what exactly could be happening biologically, which means, since Kevin and his colleagues are the ones who have generated and have the data, these other experts who are being asked, they do not have the data, they have no idea, yet they can only speculate.

01:00:55.998 --> 01:00:56.879
What we do know, this is very

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:00.982
Yes, this is just a repeat of the beginning of that, but we're going to go through that.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.302
Just watch the notes really quick.

01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:03.703
It'll only take like five minutes.

01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:04.484
Very, very, very important.

01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:06.925
Health Canada, the equivalent of the FDA, but in my country, Canada.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:18.893
Health Canada has confirmed, and they seem to respond once Kevin reported his findings, they went and looked and they have confirmed the presence of the SV40 promoter in the bacterial plasmid DNA that Pfizer used to manufacture their shots.

01:01:19.214 --> 01:01:23.616
Health Canada has also confirmed that it is a bioactive genetic sequence, which means that it can do things in the body.

01:01:24.757 --> 01:01:29.659
And they can't definitively say or rule out the potential for harm, but they have admitted that it's bioactive if it should be contaminating the vials.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:44.185
Now we have data due to work that Kevin did with Dr. David Speaker, a virologist in Canada, showing that all of the vials they looked at for Pfizer in Canada were also contaminated with this bacterial plasma DNA, so indeed it is there, it is being injected into people, and Health Canada has also confirmed that that was not disclosed to them by Pfizer, and finally they've confirmed that that is against the rules, it breaks the rules.

01:01:44.425 --> 01:01:46.525
So no, nobody can say definitively that this can cause no harm.

01:01:46.766 --> 01:01:47.126
Nobody knows.

01:01:47.706 --> 01:01:47.886
Kevin?

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.312
You agree with that?

01:01:51.632 --> 01:01:54.634
One minor correction is I'm not a physician or doctor, so I just want to let everyone know that my position here is really good.

01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:55.154
I'm good at studying DNA.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:55.415
It's there.

01:01:55.435 --> 01:01:55.615
All right.

01:01:55.635 --> 01:01:56.595
We've got that confirmed all over the world.

01:01:57.196 --> 01:01:57.776
Six different labs.

01:01:58.196 --> 01:01:58.957
We would have in 12 more labs.

01:01:58.977 --> 01:02:00.437
We've got a list of labs asking for these PCR kits.

01:02:00.457 --> 01:02:02.218
We couldn't supply them because we just didn't have enough of them.

01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:04.540
So we finally have them manufactured at some scale where we can give them out to more people.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.740
But it's there in the vials.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.801
The next question is, is it in patient samples that have been injured?

01:02:07.822 --> 01:02:08.862
Is it in patient samples that haven't been injured?

01:02:08.882 --> 01:02:10.463
We need to look at both populations to see what's going on here.

01:02:10.923 --> 01:02:16.089
So for those not familiar with what this bioactive molecule is, this SV40 enhancer has been published prolifically as being a tool used in gene therapy.

01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:17.751
So it takes DNA and drags it right to the nucleus in hours.

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:20.334
It's used in gene therapy.

01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:23.157
It's used ubiquitously on the bench.

01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:25.079
That's important to understand.

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:31.306
It probably is present in some large fraction of all molecular

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:37.334
commercial products that you know, like here's a plasmid that does something.

01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:40.396
You can use it for a wide variety of things.

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:46.860
Almost all of those products, no matter who sells it, will probably have some version of SB40 in it.

01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:53.645
And I'm not a molecular biologist, I challenge somebody to go and show me that, oh, no, it's only 1%.

01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:54.786
He's totally an idiot.

01:02:54.866 --> 01:02:56.827
And I just wouldn't admit it like that's fine.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:00.670
But I think you will find that it's much more ubiquitous than you think.

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.231
And that's part of the reason why

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:16.803
It was so easy for them to unmask this Scooby-Doo villain because any rudimentary database scanning, sequence scanning,

01:03:18.368 --> 01:03:29.993
sequence mapping plasmid program would be looking for this as a very standard aspect, a standard component of any commercial plasmid.

01:03:30.053 --> 01:03:31.793
That's probably the best way to say it.

01:03:32.214 --> 01:03:35.635
It is a very common component of many commercial plasmids.

01:03:36.075 --> 01:03:45.399
And so to say that this is widely used in gene therapy is already, in my mind, using very careful language, which actually, again,

01:03:45.999 --> 01:03:48.823
creates this limited spectrum of debate that's incorrect.

01:03:49.503 --> 01:04:00.477
It is not just used in gene therapy, because gene therapy is almost not used anywhere except for into the transformation and transfection of people to augment their immune system right now.

01:04:00.517 --> 01:04:01.959
Unless you're a cancer patient,

01:04:04.693 --> 01:04:11.643
And so to say this in this way is very precisely wrong and chosen to be that way.

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:15.789
So let's go back and make sure we get that on, on, on.

01:04:16.363 --> 01:04:17.124
you know, we get it right.

01:04:17.204 --> 01:04:21.287
So we finally have them manufactured at some scale where we can give them out to more people, but it's there in the vials.

01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:23.328
The next question is, is it in patient samples that have been injured?

01:04:23.348 --> 01:04:24.389
Is it in patient samples that haven't been injured?

01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:25.991
We need to look at both populations to see what's going on here.

01:04:26.451 --> 01:04:31.615
So for those not familiar with what this bioactive molecule is, this SV40 enhancer has been published prolifically as being a tool used in gene therapy.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.256
So it takes DNA and drags it right to the nucleus in hours.

01:04:33.857 --> 01:04:41.563
We can also forward your audience other papers suggesting that when you do mammalian transfection like this, a subset of the cells, somewhere around 7% to 10% of the cells get permanently integrated when you bombard them with linear fragments of DNA like this.

01:04:42.103 --> 01:04:44.846
So to say that this isn't an issue is really, I think, willful misconduct.

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:47.430
You have to take a precautionary principle and say, no, wait a minute, we don't know if this is an issue.

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.812
We know there's DNA in there that shouldn't be, that was never disclosed and never consented to.

01:04:49.832 --> 01:04:52.075
We know it's in a transfection vehicle, and we know it has a sequence that drives it to the nucleus.

01:04:52.335 --> 01:04:53.817
Those three things are enough to ring alarm bells to stop.

01:04:54.198 --> 01:04:55.779
Stop and look to see if there's integration happening.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.403
Because if there is, there's a whole host of other complications that we have to begin looking at.

01:04:58.963 --> 01:04:59.964
So go ahead.

01:05:00.004 --> 01:05:02.447
Yeah, I mean, at a very minimum, the regulator should be warning the public.

01:05:02.547 --> 01:05:04.309
They should be saying, well, we have a major problem here.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:05.330
We're looking into it.

01:05:05.591 --> 01:05:09.495
You probably don't want to if you don't need to be vaccinated, don't be vaccinated right now until we can look into this.

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:09.815
Isn't that what?

01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:17.925
And so now the important thing to understand here, what they're obfuscating is that it isn't just this process that they used.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:24.439
and the contamination from that process that we're talking about and the mistake that was made.

01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:30.344
And therefore that's where the injuries come from, which are all questions that they want you to be asking.

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:32.085
They want you to feel like, oh, I get it.

01:05:32.465 --> 01:05:37.109
This is really important because all these vaccine injuries might've actually come from this.

01:05:37.169 --> 01:05:40.331
And in that case, transfection might be a lot better than we thought.

01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:43.294
And so, wow, this is really crucial that we get this right.

01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:47.277
It's crazy that the FDA and the CDC is not more interested in this outcome.

01:05:49.104 --> 01:05:51.205
They want your wheels to turn like that.

01:05:54.387 --> 01:06:01.731
But that's incorrect turning, because even in the best case scenario, transformation and transfection of healthy humans was always going to be a catastrophe.

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:02.411
They knew that.

01:06:03.152 --> 01:06:04.993
That's where the willful misconduct is.

01:06:05.433 --> 01:06:07.334
That's why I think it's criminal negligence.

01:06:07.394 --> 01:06:09.936
It's criminally malicious.

01:06:10.296 --> 01:06:15.559
I don't know what the right legal term is, but this is like poisoning someone's food.

01:06:17.844 --> 01:06:23.026
This is not like accidentally, oh, sorry, I didn't mean to hand you a gas can.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:26.368
I thought I was handing you the milk.

01:06:26.448 --> 01:06:29.189
That's not the kind of, that's not that either.

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:42.014
It's really willfully injuring people, probably with the idea of testing different concoctions, different preparations, different everything.

01:06:45.456 --> 01:06:46.376
If you're gonna hurt,

01:06:47.189 --> 01:06:51.813
a billion people under the pretense of an emergency, you just don't hurt them all.

01:06:53.034 --> 01:07:02.743
You do it with some systematic something or other so that you can learn something from it.

01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:06.026
Nothing is ever done willy-nilly.

01:07:07.347 --> 01:07:13.693
Even if you believe that this is a depopulation agenda, they're not just gonna kill people, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:15.225 --> 01:07:35.585
If you believe this is a depopulation agenda, it's even more important to understand the context and the mythology of World War II in the way that Mark and Uwe started to really bring to the light in the podcast that we did together on Sunday.

01:07:37.807 --> 01:07:43.270
They could not have wasted all those opportunities by just gassing and burning them.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.731
No way they wasted all that opportunity.

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:56.976
It's a very macabre thought, but no way have they wasted this opportunity to roll out a countermeasure under the protection of the PrEP Act.

01:07:57.016 --> 01:08:07.081
There's no way they missed this opportunity around the world to test different things, maybe even up to and including graphene oxide for all we know.

01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:18.452
And then the presence of it in one place and the absence in another would be the obviously evidence that they didn't do it in one place or did it in another.

01:08:18.972 --> 01:08:35.388
And you divide these people because their hamster wheel is different, because their Lollapalooza of lies and the stage that they went to is different in Portugal than in New York City, different in Japan than it was in Africa, different in the Netherlands than it was in Spain.

01:08:38.769 --> 01:08:45.873
And how convenient is it that all of these places are segregated by social media that is segregated by language?

01:08:49.996 --> 01:09:05.125
And so you get this several different layers of Lollapalooza of lies in your native tongue, but also in the universal language of English circulating around and going viral, supposedly by the will of the algorithm.

01:09:06.963 --> 01:09:20.310
It's by pre-programmed notions rising to the top and pre-programmed heroes being pre-programmed to say the right things.

01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:25.653
And don't take that like these guys are all tortured to do it.

01:09:25.673 --> 01:09:31.316
They just sit down at a table and say, yeah, that's great because these ideas have been around since the sixties.

01:09:33.413 --> 01:09:43.037
since Hilary Koprowski and Justin, Julian Huxley and Joshua Lederberg and Jonas Salk.

01:09:45.518 --> 01:09:48.059
We're talking about what we needed to do as a race.

01:09:50.034 --> 01:10:09.247
and how the resources of the globe needed to be distributed as a whole, and controlled and governed as a whole, and that we needed to think about human evolution a lot more seriously than we are right now, willy-nilly letting any random process go forward at this stage, given the understanding that we have of biology, would be ridiculous.

01:10:09.287 --> 01:10:13.590
It would be abdicating our responsibility as stewards over our own genetics.

01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:17.493
That's what these books say, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:20.205 --> 01:10:32.810
Where Hilary Koprowski and Lederberg and all these people that Mark and others have just wonderfully shown you how they've been talking and walking and eulogizing each other for decades already.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.071
Stanley Prusiner.

01:10:36.218 --> 01:10:53.907
the Sackler family, all intertwined with the same group of people that's read these books and talked about these ideas, including the ideas that we just heard Chris Martinson say on the PBS NewsHour before the pandemic about unsustainability.

01:10:53.947 --> 01:11:00.010
And if we have all these people and we keep having growth, then there's going to be all kinds of twice as many people, he said.

01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:10.688
And now he's in the background of this podcast waiting to come in and lend his PBS NewsHour insight.

01:11:13.011 --> 01:11:13.893
Regulators should be doing right now.

01:11:15.061 --> 01:11:16.302
I'll comment from the perspective of Health Canada.

01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:18.204
Steve, yes, I can't emphasize this enough.

01:11:18.364 --> 01:11:25.629
Health Canada has stated in an email, so it's publicly available, they've stated in an email that this is not supposed to be there, and they've confirmed that it's a bioactive molecule, it's not supposed to be there.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:26.150
It breaks the rules.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:32.394
I mean, if they want to maintain any thread of trust in them by the public, they need to immediately put a moratorium on this.

01:11:32.415 --> 01:11:35.457
They need to, like, any other drug that would be found with a contaminant that was not disclosed to them would be

01:11:36.157 --> 01:11:36.757
recalled immediately.

01:11:36.878 --> 01:11:37.658
That is exactly what should happen.

01:11:37.678 --> 01:11:38.358
So I actually disagree with you.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:39.979
I wouldn't say if there's anybody who doesn't need it, don't take it.

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:41.679
I would say Health Canada, the onus is on you now.

01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:46.401
You admitted this months ago, but you were wishful or you at least were okay because Kevin's data was reserved for the U.S.

01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:47.962
It wasn't linked to your regulatory policies.

01:11:48.062 --> 01:11:52.784
But now Kevin and David Speaker and others have shown that it applies to Canada's vaccine vials.

01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:54.845
So now the public knows this and the onus is on you.

01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:57.166
You have a contaminant now that you have publicly disclosed to everybody.

01:11:57.366 --> 01:11:58.086
It's not supposed to be there.

01:11:58.106 --> 01:11:59.127
It was not revealed to you.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:11:59.687
It breaks your rules.

01:11:59.787 --> 01:12:01.027
I mean, this is the case, Steve.

01:12:01.288 --> 01:12:03.088
How many lies do you have to tell to be a liar?

01:12:03.148 --> 01:12:03.668
One, right?

01:12:03.769 --> 01:12:04.889
So if Health Canada wants to restore

01:12:04.889 --> 01:12:06.110
or if they have to immediately recall the spot.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:06.651
But they haven't.

01:12:06.671 --> 01:12:07.812
They've done nothing.

01:12:07.952 --> 01:12:10.114
Just one lie, it makes you a liar.

01:12:10.174 --> 01:12:11.235
That's why we wrote that.

01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:12.476
Okay, that was pretty good then.

01:12:12.516 --> 01:12:13.197
That's fine with me.

01:12:13.257 --> 01:12:13.978
Nice work, Byram.

01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:22.866
But again, they have him focused on the one lie, the one lie that's okay to talk about, which is that the shot is really, really bad, right?

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.208
That's the T-shirt that we make back there.

01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:28.311
The COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:42.781
And so as long as they keep Byram excited and focused on the legal challenge to the shot and the legal challenge to whether or not Pfizer was good guy or bad guy or who's, then it's totally fine.

01:12:45.383 --> 01:12:50.769
As long as they keep him convinced behind the scenes that somebody like Jonathan Cooley is definitely not worth listening to.

01:12:52.366 --> 01:13:08.513
long as they keep him behind the scenes thinking that Jessica Rose has got all that injury taken care of along with John Bodewin, as long as he thinks behind the scenes that Steve Kirsch is great and Robert Malone is great and Pierre Kory is great, then it's fine if he can do all this.

01:13:08.573 --> 01:13:13.156
They don't mind the, this is part of the sparse pandemic narrative.

01:13:13.176 --> 01:13:14.496
This is what Epigirl does.

01:13:14.576 --> 01:13:18.238
They reveal over a course of a couple of years that indeed,

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:25.121
The rush of a vaccine has injured some people, and those people are really injured, so we're eventually going to have to do something about that.

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:29.322
That's what you're watching right now.

01:13:29.742 --> 01:13:31.783
A year from now, that's where we'll be probably.

01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:45.569
After the election of whatever savior is coming to our rescue, then these people will be elevated to some additional publicity and cross the red-blue line and unite some people.

01:13:46.929 --> 01:13:53.994
on the capitulation that we rushed it and we hurt some people and now we have to, you know, pay reparations or something.

01:14:16.909 --> 01:14:18.470
That's the obvious thing here.

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:23.091
So that's, again, you're designed to go, Oh yeah, but I know why they don't want to pull them.

01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:29.253
And you gotta be, if you're aware of that, then you can, you know, keep those wheels and not, not, not jump in them.

01:14:34.299 --> 01:14:36.861
Can I mention one more thing, Steve, based on what Kevin said?

01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:44.766
What's very important is Kevin and David Speaker and several other authors have this preprint that they just put out, which includes this Canadian data, but what also is included in there is very important, because the box up what Kevin was saying, I agree.

01:14:45.026 --> 01:14:49.008
When I say that there's no hard evidence of harm, I'm talking about those people who are saying there's nothing to see here, right?

01:14:49.048 --> 01:14:49.568
There is no problem.

01:14:49.588 --> 01:14:50.269
They have no evidence of that.

01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:52.489
Like Kevin mentioned, there are lots of theoretical harms.

01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:53.370
Lots of theoretical harms.

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:55.990
Lots of potential mechanisms whereby this bioactive genetic sequence could cause harm.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.290
That is, in and of itself, sufficient.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.891
It should be sufficient in science to say, we've got to stop, we've got to do the research now to definitively answer these questions.

01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:10.353
But get this, what they showed in this preprint article is that the batches, the Canadian batches, they were able to link them to adverse event reports, and the batches that were most contaminated were associated with the highest number of adverse events that had been reported.

01:15:10.533 --> 01:15:11.513
There's a correlation there, right?

01:15:11.713 --> 01:15:16.194
So, in fact, there is some evidence in the hands of Kevin and his co-authors, right, that does suggest harm.

01:15:16.694 --> 01:15:17.915
Irreparable harm by the way, right?

01:15:18.235 --> 01:15:41.553
Yes, and that that correlation was it was evident with Pfizer It wasn't evident with Moderna, but you know, we need more data there obviously could be confounders here But this is what Maris is designed for is hypothesis generation Yeah, and we see signals like this and there's there's other data That's not in the paper that is public that people should try if you plot those on that on those charts They'll reinforce this like Philip Buchholz Lots weren't in this because I went from Canada and those those have even more DNA than what we found in Canada and higher adverse events We also have another lot that's coming in FL 0 0 0 3 from Pfizer that is off the charts on DNA concentration off the charts on adverse events and

01:15:41.813 --> 01:15:42.654
There's a lot that were in Germany.

01:15:42.694 --> 01:15:47.340
There are, so there's a couple of lots floating out there that all sort of reinforce this trend that higher concentrations of DNA are having higher adverse events.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:50.323
So I think as more data rolls in, that chart will begin to reinforce itself on the Pfizer side.

01:15:50.343 --> 01:15:51.304
I don't know what's going on on the Moderna side.

01:15:51.324 --> 01:15:52.405
There's a lot of other different components of Moderna.

01:15:52.425 --> 01:15:55.749
They have lower DNA levels, but their adverse events don't seem to be tracking with the DNA concentrations at the moment.

01:15:55.769 --> 01:15:57.832
But we'll see if that changes when more data rolls in.

01:15:58.192 --> 01:16:00.074
So again, Moderna doesn't have this SV40 contamination system.

01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:01.416
So they're kind of on a different playing field right now.

01:16:01.656 --> 01:16:09.862
Yeah, but if you're stuck in the middle here in terms of, hey, some experts say this, and some experts say this, the data that you have is moving it towards the, hey, folks, this is very serious.

01:16:09.902 --> 01:16:10.943
It's not moving the data that we have.

01:16:10.963 --> 01:16:15.826
The little data that we're getting suggests that this is much more serious than there's nothing going on here.

01:16:15.986 --> 01:16:24.052
In other words, if you had to call the odds here, it's like if you were to call the odds about that this is serious or very serious, would you give me 60-40 odds?

01:16:24.072 --> 01:16:25.133
Would you give me 80-20 odds?

01:16:25.573 --> 01:16:28.075
What's your feeling if I were to ask you for a number?

01:16:28.895 --> 01:16:32.401
95.5.

01:16:29.036 --> 01:16:32.401
We've got evidence there being a problem here.

01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:33.943
It was not disclosed to the regulators.

01:16:34.043 --> 01:16:37.608
Theirs is on fire, and we now see this contaminant in many, many vials internationally.

01:16:37.809 --> 01:16:40.853
So I don't think they should leave them any wiggle room here on what needs to be done.

01:16:41.314 --> 01:16:42.435
This is a hit-and-breaks moment.

01:16:44.498 --> 01:16:46.158
So I'm a scientist and a hardcore researcher, right?

01:16:46.178 --> 01:16:48.899
So when you ask a question like that, I find it more difficult to put numbers on it.

01:16:49.239 --> 01:16:50.179
I don't disagree with Kevin at all.

01:16:50.619 --> 01:16:53.120
The way I would put it, though, as a researcher is you look at what the existing data is, right?

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.180
There's a research question that's been posed.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.380
So I view the question that you put to me as being a research question.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.240
And then you say, OK, I look at the existing data.

01:16:59.121 --> 01:17:01.081
And understanding the mechanisms of the existing data, what would I predict?

01:17:01.101 --> 01:17:04.642
In other words, what would my hypothesis be as I move forward with this kind of experimentation that Kevin's going to do?

01:17:04.842 --> 01:17:07.002
My hypothesis would be that it's going to be found to be harmful.

01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:07.382
Yes.

01:17:07.742 --> 01:17:11.443
Chris, if I were to ask you for odds, Kevin said 95-5.

01:17:11.463 --> 01:17:12.223
What are your numbers, Chris?

01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:13.091
Well, hi, Steve.

01:17:13.111 --> 01:17:13.672
Hi, Byron.

01:17:13.692 --> 01:17:13.972
Hey, Kevin.

01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:14.613
Good to see everybody.

01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:15.514
Good to see you.

01:17:16.154 --> 01:17:16.555
Likewise.

01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:25.282
So I don't know yet, because a lot of my research to this point has convinced me that the spike protein itself is toxic, but I differentiate that I think what I'll call wild-type spike protein, because there's a lot of them, right?

01:17:25.302 --> 01:17:26.844
There's the Omicron spike and the Delta and all that, right?

01:17:26.984 --> 01:17:33.269
But that this thing, this obviously probably grotesquely misfolded pseudo-uridine out product that comes from the vaccines, has its own toxicity profile.

01:17:33.289 --> 01:17:36.112
I think we've got good data to say that alone is doing something.

01:17:36.192 --> 01:17:37.813
And now we've got this plasmid on top of that.

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:38.814
So I don't know where to differentiate.

01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:45.142
Okay, so I guess we better go back and do that more slowly because that was actually pretty extraordinary.

01:17:45.162 --> 01:17:49.967
I'm going to briefly escape out of full screen so I can change this.

01:17:50.628 --> 01:17:51.549
Oops, up here.

01:17:53.552 --> 01:17:56.055
Get back to a little bit closer to normal speed.

01:17:56.075 --> 01:17:57.737
I'll still leave it slightly sped up.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.762
And I want you to listen carefully.

01:18:01.782 --> 01:18:04.645
He does say that he thinks the spike protein is toxic.

01:18:05.185 --> 01:18:16.775
He also says that it's misfolded, which is very different than being mistranslated or coming to a premature stop codon, which is more likely what happened.

01:18:16.815 --> 01:18:18.197
It's actually the first thing that

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:39.045
Kevin McKernan explained to me when he came on my stream for the first time is that one of the things that the pseudouridine does is create premature stop codons, which is the reason why he explained the RNA was just a smear because there were so many little fragments that were made from all the times when the ribosome just dropped off the

01:18:39.785 --> 01:18:42.968
RNA spontaneously because of the pseudouridine being present.

01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:49.415
So that's very different than being a spike protein that gets translated from beginning to end but gets misfolded.

01:18:51.036 --> 01:18:55.260
And so again, if you're not careful, you will miss how

01:18:56.443 --> 01:19:13.293
eloquently the walls of the limited spectrum of debate are outlined in almost every sentence and planted in almost every sentence so that the questions you are asking are like, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, and they're all wrong because they are all fundamentally not

01:19:16.892 --> 01:19:33.262
They are not stating and not making clear that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, independent of how pure it could be done, or how perfect the lipid nanoparticles could be made, or how well you injected it where.

01:19:34.863 --> 01:19:39.126
This was always transformation, and it was always transfection, and it was always biologically...

01:19:40.722 --> 01:19:55.975
unjustifiable in healthy children or even healthy, beautiful elderly people who should have been with us a few more years, but were neglected in hospitals and then forced to transfect in order to get treatment or anything else.

01:19:56.015 --> 01:19:57.697
I mean, it was just diabolical.

01:19:58.337 --> 01:20:07.380
And so again, to start off with the spike protein is toxic and probably misfolded is like several layers of bullshit all in one sentence.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.300
So listen carefully.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:13.502
And understanding the mechanisms and the existing data, you don't want to be harmful.

01:20:13.902 --> 01:20:14.062
Yes.

01:20:14.642 --> 01:20:20.124
Chris, if I were to ask you for odds, would you, Kevin said 95.5.

01:20:20.164 --> 01:20:21.364
What are your numbers, Chris?

01:20:21.864 --> 01:20:22.584
Well, hi, Steve.

01:20:22.624 --> 01:20:23.085
Hi, Byron.

01:20:23.505 --> 01:20:23.785
Hey, Kevin.

01:20:23.825 --> 01:20:24.845
It's good to see everybody.

01:20:24.865 --> 01:20:26.185
It's good to see you.

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:27.466
Likewise.

01:20:29.076 --> 01:20:29.717
Good to see you.

01:20:29.817 --> 01:20:31.118
Like what, what does that mean?

01:20:31.178 --> 01:20:32.079
Do they know each other?

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.442
Cause he didn't present in front of the Senate.

01:20:34.482 --> 01:20:37.766
Like you, can you see it's not, this is not funny.

01:20:39.748 --> 01:20:46.296
So I don't know yet because the, because I've pretty, a lot of my research to this point has convinced me that the spike protein itself,

01:20:47.123 --> 01:20:51.807
is toxic, but I differentiate that I think what I'll call wild-type spike protein, because there's a lot of them, right?

01:20:51.827 --> 01:20:53.608
There's the Omicron spike and the Delta and all that, right?

01:20:54.509 --> 01:21:03.956
But that this thing, this obviously probably grotesquely misfolded pseudo-uridine out product that comes from the vaccines has its own toxicity profile.

01:21:03.976 --> 01:21:05.917
I think we've got good data to say that alone.

01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:06.518
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:06.938 --> 01:21:08.159
is doing something.

01:21:08.319 --> 01:21:10.741
And now we've got this plasmid on top of that.

01:21:10.761 --> 01:21:26.154
So I don't know where to differentiate these effects yet, but I can tell you, you know, I was just at an FLCCC board retreat and, you know, I get to query, you know, Pierre Corey up close, just talking with all the doctors there who are frontline treating people with vaccine injuries,

01:21:26.889 --> 01:21:27.629
It's just grotesque.

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:32.291
I mean, it's a really wide ranging soup of conditions that are hitting them.

01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:35.312
And these are very long lasting, by the way.

01:21:35.332 --> 01:21:40.054
You know, people who got their their shots when it first came out, they are having new symptoms.

01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:48.758
Like I know someone who got shot when the shots rolled out and and and she was doing, you know, very poorly that much better than poorly than better.

01:21:48.818 --> 01:21:50.358
And, you know, she's been better for a while.

01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:54.300
And I just got a call last week that she lost the use of her legs.

01:21:56.488 --> 01:21:57.389
and was fine before?

01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:14.400
Well, I've been waiting for the all-cause mortality data to die off, because I thought, you know, correlation here, it should, I was thinking it was going to track with some lag, you know, the overall rate of vaccine boostering and uptake, and it's just, it just keeps going, you know, so I don't, these are really tricky signals.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.220
Deceptive.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:23.946
So that's annoying, because of course we know that the all-cause mortality signals from 2020, again, are the things that they don't want to talk about.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:48.146
They don't want to look at those in detail, even though their friend, Denny Rancourt, that they met in Romania because they flew him there, showed them very clearly that not only is there a nice signal for maybe as many as 17 million people being killed by the rollout of the transfection, but there is no real signal for a spreading

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.460
respiratory disease in 2020.

01:22:51.841 --> 01:23:01.262
There are localized increases in all-cause mortality that Denny Rancourt is curiously or dubiously unwilling to address.

01:23:02.883 --> 01:23:14.085
And I find it weird that he won't just talk to Jessica Hockett and discuss New York City in a real straightforward sort of way, but kind of avoids it.

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:17.206
But maybe that's just because it's a,

01:23:18.466 --> 01:23:19.126
you know, whatever.

01:23:19.707 --> 01:23:20.367
I don't know why.

01:23:20.387 --> 01:23:21.987
I don't pretend to understand.

01:23:22.047 --> 01:23:27.349
But I do know that that's a, that's a, it's a bright spot.

01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:29.650
I see that and I think of it often.

01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:33.351
And so here, we're talking about all cause mortality.

01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:38.233
But conveniently, we're not talking about the all cause mortality that, that, that

01:23:40.137 --> 01:23:59.813
that supports the idea that we had to rush a transfection out, supports the idea that Warp Speed was a good idea, or that the CARES Act was a good idea, or that any of these other things that were done were a good idea, all based on the idea that there was a novel gain-of-function virus spreading around.

01:23:59.873 --> 01:24:07.059
And in fact, Chris Martinson was on YouTube in 2020 speculating about that virus being gain-of-function and very, very,

01:24:08.101 --> 01:24:11.823
early on the side of LabLeak, much like myself.

01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:29.950
But unlike myself, who decided that that was a part of the national security state's narrative, and decided to argue against it and read to see if I could support it, this guy has been 100% LabLeak solved.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:34.932
Barrick, Fauci, and

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:42.439
and DAZAC since 2020 and is still there now.

01:24:42.519 --> 01:24:43.981
That is not insignificant.

01:24:46.561 --> 01:24:58.131
I should clarify my point is I wasn't saying 95-5 that it definitely harms people this DNA It's just that 95-5 that it's gonna this is a material event in the disclosure process and that it's going to be legally significant, right?

01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:06.017
Okay Yeah, if I were asked about the legal yes, I would say a hundred percent I mean health care from what I've seen from Health Canada.

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:07.218
It's a hundred percent.

01:25:07.238 --> 01:25:07.258
I

01:25:07.458 --> 01:25:07.658
Right.

01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:21.749
So so in other words, I mean, even, you know, like best possible case, at a minimum, these regulators should be letting the public know, hey, we may, you know, Houston, you know, we may have a problem here.

01:25:22.169 --> 01:25:22.409
Right.

01:25:22.489 --> 01:25:25.231
That that they should be saying that at a minimum.

01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:29.595
Now, what they really should be doing is they should be saying, hey, let's take these things off the market.

01:25:29.955 --> 01:25:30.155
Right.

01:25:30.315 --> 01:25:36.500
Would you all agree with that, that they should be taking them off the market for now until they can investigate the harms?

01:25:37.583 --> 01:25:41.885
I mean, that data was obvious years ago, but this is just one more really large nail in the coffin.

01:25:42.285 --> 01:25:50.329
Yeah, so when you say years ago, you know, some people said, oh, hey, we knew in 2021 that the SV40, that there was SV40 in the vaccines.

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:54.691
Is that, or SV40 promoter sequence, did we know in 2021 that- 2021, no.

01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:58.126
No, we didn't.

01:25:58.246 --> 01:26:08.953
Yeah, the material they gave to the EMA, and I'm assuming this is what Health Canada has been given as well, annotated everything in the plasmid except the SV40 region.

01:26:09.613 --> 01:26:10.614
So they were afraid of this.

01:26:11.034 --> 01:26:20.401
I mean, you don't go about annotating a plasmid with all the detail of the antibiotic resistance gene, the T7 promoter, you know, the spike protein, the cut site they used to linearize it.

01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:27.005
I mean, they went and annotated this thing with all of these details except the most material piece, which is the SV40 promoter that's active in mammalian cells.

01:26:27.005 --> 01:26:27.185
cells.

01:26:28.005 --> 01:26:30.507
So that is clearly hiding it.

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:33.168
So they showed they showed the gene.

01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:36.870
They had the regulators had the SV40 gene sequence, right?

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.570
The promoter.

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:39.831
So they had the entire plasmid sequence.

01:26:40.715 --> 01:26:44.697
They had the map, and in the map you sort of paint on the map what the parts mean.

01:26:45.177 --> 01:26:45.617
There you go.

01:26:45.797 --> 01:26:52.320
And what they didn't paint was the SV40 region, although they gave them the sequence so they can kind of slip it in, but they didn't spell out what it meant.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.681
Okay, so you see, Steve, this is what Kevin's talking about.

01:26:55.721 --> 01:26:59.683
See, it shows cut sites, it shows all the bioactive genes that are in here, everything.

01:27:00.163 --> 01:27:05.267
And you can see all the labels, but they didn't, so they disclosed all kinds of things, but not that SV40 enhancer.

01:27:05.647 --> 01:27:09.410
And can I just tell you something, just really quickly for your listeners, Steve, because I think this is really important.

01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:10.771
Listen, I've got the quotes.

01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:15.434
This is, so your listeners understand, this is what Health Canada, your equivalent of the FDA, said in an email.

01:27:15.454 --> 01:27:16.855
This isn't my words, this is what they said.

01:27:17.135 --> 01:27:27.082
Listen, Health Canada expects sponsors to identify any biologically functional DNA sequences within a plasmid, such as an SV40 enhancer.

01:27:27.423 --> 01:27:29.064
And this is to be done at the time of submission.

01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:32.535
And then it says here, how Canada says... Wait a minute, it said that?

01:27:32.555 --> 01:27:32.816
Yes, yes.

01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:44.305
And then they go on to say the sponsor, which of course is Pfizer, did not specifically identify the SV40 sequence.

01:27:44.585 --> 01:27:53.714
And then they say it was possible for Health Canada to confirm the presence of the enhancer based on the plasma DNA sequence submitted by Pfizer against the published SV40 enhancer sequence.

01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:55.315
So again, that's what we just talked about.

01:27:55.596 --> 01:28:00.841
They submitted the sequence as a data file, so they have a computer file sitting there with the sequence.

01:28:01.301 --> 01:28:11.743
They could see, and then they looked at Pfizer's document after Kevin published his data, and they said, my goodness, Kevin found this, but it isn't listed anywhere on here, but we don't have the gene sequence, so we can go back, and Kevin's the expert on this.

01:28:11.763 --> 01:28:22.166
He can tell you, you could blast that in a publicly available database, a beautiful one that your government offers, and in a few minutes, you can show, bang, 100% match for the SV40 enhancer sequence in the plasmid.

01:28:22.186 --> 01:28:22.706
That's what they did.

01:28:23.146 --> 01:28:23.326
Right.

01:28:23.386 --> 01:28:38.009
So, so it's the equivalent, you know, so for the lay public, this is the equivalent of a like a bill in Congress where they have this long bill, you know, it's 500 pages long and they sneak in a little piece here that says, and now we're going to strip all power from the president or something like that.

01:28:38.389 --> 01:28:44.550
I, you know, and they don't call it to anyone's attention, but they can say, yes, it was in the bill that you signed, but they didn't call it out.

01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:45.070
Is that.

01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:47.690
It's not as simple as that.

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.591
As I just mentioned to you, health Canada himself has disclosed

01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:55.272
Pfizer is required to disclose to them any bioactive sequence.

01:28:55.312 --> 01:29:06.276
So it's worse than that because it's not just that it got snuck in, it's that it got snuck in, but it's equivalent of there being a rule, you cannot sneak anything else, anything in without making it explicitly clear to us that you've inserted that.

01:29:06.576 --> 01:29:07.517
Yes.

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:14.080
Okay, so we have a diagram on the screen here, and this is Kevin's screen.

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:25.286
There's a duplicate of this in Kevin's video testimony that was on the World Council for Health, and so if you want to go through this and explain this with a mouse, Kevin, that'd be awesome.

01:29:25.506 --> 01:29:28.908
give you a sense of what they've, so this is the plasmid they gave to the EMA.

01:29:29.048 --> 01:29:30.468
I'm assuming this is what they gave to Health Canada.

01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:32.669
You can see they've annotated the spike protein here.

01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:36.131
They've put in this F1 element, this poly-A linker.

01:29:36.171 --> 01:29:40.053
They even annotated this little five base pair sequence known as the EMA-1104i site.

01:29:40.073 --> 01:29:44.115
That's a restriction enzyme that cuts open the plasmid and make it linear before they run an IVT reaction.

01:29:44.475 --> 01:29:45.435
They put the Ori in here.

01:29:45.475 --> 01:29:46.316
They put the CAN in here.

01:29:47.377 --> 01:29:50.399
What's not in here is this whole region in here has no annotation at all.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:30:01.329
And this is where, sorry, but these images are sort of mirror images of one another, so you'll have to see that the neocan gene is over here in green, and here's the SV40 region, which is not here.

01:30:02.089 --> 01:30:06.392
And what's really critical, they also left out the F1 origin, which makes single-stranded DNA.

01:30:06.412 --> 01:30:10.335
And I don't know if that's active in mammalian cells, but it's another region that they left out.

01:30:11.276 --> 01:30:14.759
But the most critical part here is this 72 base pair enhancer.

01:30:15.059 --> 01:30:18.722
This tandem repeat here is published heavily for use in gene therapy.

01:30:18.762 --> 01:30:20.804
It drives DNA straight to the nucleus in ours.

01:30:21.644 --> 01:30:23.446
And David Dean does a lot of work on this.

01:30:24.006 --> 01:30:30.611
So I think this is the reason they hit it, is that they probably started manufacturing this and realized, oops, we left in a mammalian promoter.

01:30:30.651 --> 01:30:31.212
That's not good.

01:30:31.952 --> 01:30:37.718
That means this plasma DNA is active in mammalian cells and it's not just active in the cytoplasm, it goes straight to the nucleus and that increases.

01:30:38.039 --> 01:30:46.507
So I want you to listen again when we go back to hear that he again states that SV40 is used as a promoter in gene therapy.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:52.432
It's not used ubiquitously on every bench in America's academic biological labs.

01:30:52.852 --> 01:31:00.177
It's not used in a lot of different commercial products that are basically plasmids to be grown in different contexts.

01:31:00.237 --> 01:31:00.777
No, no, no.

01:31:01.297 --> 01:31:04.700
It's used ubiquitously in gene therapy.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.601
You gotta hear it for what it is.

01:31:07.942 --> 01:31:08.602
Stop lying!

01:31:11.237 --> 01:31:12.438
straight to the nucleus in ours.

01:31:12.919 --> 01:31:19.305
Critical part here is this 72 base pair enhancer, this tandem repeat here is published heavily for use in gene therapy.

01:31:19.345 --> 01:31:21.367
It drives DNA straight to the nucleus in ours.

01:31:22.188 --> 01:31:24.010
And David Dean does a lot of work on this.

01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:31.757
So I think this is the reason they hit it, is that they probably started manufacturing this and realized, oops, we left in a mammalian promoter, that's not good.

01:31:32.498 --> 01:31:38.925
That means this plasma DNA is active in mammalian cells, and it's not just active in the cytoplasm, it goes straight to the nucleus and that increases integration risk.

01:31:39.326 --> 01:31:46.033
And since we're dealing with LNPs, this DNA is going to get there uninhibited, and it probably got deleted from their disclosure.

01:31:47.515 --> 01:31:53.859
why you would annotate something that's five bases down here, and even a T7, which is maybe 20 bases up here, and a COSAC consensus sequence.

01:31:53.879 --> 01:32:04.766
I mean, you're getting down to fine level annotation of five base pair elements, and then you emit this 366 region base, 366 base pair region that's like probably one of the most functional regions of the plasmid.

01:32:06.227 --> 01:32:08.088
So to me, it's clear someone hid something.

01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:15.034
So Mark says in the chat that Inder Verma is the world leader on this.

01:32:15.054 --> 01:32:17.477
I think he means SV40, but I'm not sure.

01:32:18.477 --> 01:32:24.423
If that would be the case, that would be kind of significant because I think Inder Verma has something to do with Robert Malone.

01:32:24.443 --> 01:32:25.203
But I can't remember.

01:32:25.223 --> 01:32:26.945
You're going to have to check with Mark on that one.

01:32:28.148 --> 01:32:30.790
If you don't know who I'm talking about, that's Mark Hucytonic.

01:32:31.371 --> 01:32:34.493
Mark Hulak at HucytonicITS.com.

01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:46.322
I want to back up the speculation.

01:32:46.762 --> 01:32:50.544
People don't go into plasmids by hand anymore and annotate these things.

01:32:50.584 --> 01:32:52.745
They put them in tools like Snapgene, which is what I did.

01:32:52.965 --> 01:32:57.367
You download this for free off the internet, plug the sequence in, and it paints all of this stuff on there.

01:32:57.727 --> 01:33:02.109
So I would have to actively go and delete this stuff from Snapgene and then give it to the FDA.

01:33:02.129 --> 01:33:05.971
Yeah, and anyone can go to Snapgene and do this, by the way.

01:33:07.132 --> 01:33:15.014
Yeah, I have something in my sub stack that teaches people how to put a DNA sequence in a snap gene and they can put this in there and see that it automatically annotates all this stuff.

01:33:15.054 --> 01:33:19.055
And you'd have to actively go and delete the information to get rid of this stuff.

01:33:19.715 --> 01:33:23.336
So there's no way in my mind that they just, oops, forgot about this.

01:33:24.076 --> 01:33:27.317
Any annotation program painted this and someone had to actively go and delete it.

01:33:28.146 --> 01:33:32.489
And Steve, I want to back that up, because I hadn't even thought of it from that perspective, Kevin.

01:33:32.509 --> 01:33:33.289
You're absolutely right.

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:40.574
My lab uses snap gene as well, because we make virus-vectored vaccines all the time.

01:33:40.594 --> 01:33:43.635
So there's all this cloning work that goes on, and snap gene is used.

01:33:43.695 --> 01:33:45.397
And so I can confirm Kevin's right.

01:33:45.517 --> 01:33:46.777
It would automatically label this.

01:33:46.857 --> 01:33:53.982
It would automatically label it because it's ubiquitously used on the bench, not just in gene therapy, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:54.562 --> 01:34:12.415
but in a wide variety of transfection and transformation scenarios because transformation and transfection is a ubiquitously present methodology across academic biology and academic medical biology and pharmaceutical production.

01:34:12.616 --> 01:34:19.621
It's everywhere because producing DNA and RNA has never been cheaper.

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:46.501
So they are obfuscating this, ladies and gentlemen, that again, an entire class of people that exists in America and around the Western world should have known better that using recombinant DNA technology to produce an RNA transfection and rolling it out en masse was about as criminally negligent as poisoning your children's cereal with gasoline in the morning.

01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:52.375
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that that was a misstep.

01:34:57.918 --> 01:35:06.362
And these people are pretending as though that some deceptive person decided to edit that out and everybody else is just innocent.

01:35:06.422 --> 01:35:07.802
Well, I didn't know that they did that.

01:35:08.022 --> 01:35:10.083
I would have never, oh my goodness.

01:35:10.103 --> 01:35:16.826
We're going to have to find the Scooby-Doo villain who's responsible for editing this map.

01:35:16.866 --> 01:35:18.247
They must've just edited it.

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:28.625
instead of arguing about the fact that every one of these damn people knew that you shouldn't transfect healthy people, and it didn't matter what they did.

01:35:28.685 --> 01:35:35.011
They needed to come up with a Scooby-Doo story so that a mystery could be solved, and you're watching it happen right now.

01:35:36.652 --> 01:35:38.253
This is only from like a week ago.

01:35:38.273 --> 01:35:39.594
I thought about that, actually.

01:35:39.634 --> 01:35:40.675
It's a very interesting point.

01:35:41.115 --> 01:35:43.878
So they would actually have to have removed a default label.

01:35:45.018 --> 01:35:45.219
Right.

01:35:45.359 --> 01:35:46.840
Chris, comment?

01:35:47.907 --> 01:35:51.069
Well, I don't know how they could have left that out.

01:35:51.489 --> 01:35:53.490
Particularly, Byron, let me be clear about this.

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:59.774
That thing you read, that was instructions given before COVID, before this vaccine came along, where they said,

01:36:00.603 --> 01:36:03.905
for instance, you need to call out SV40, or was that something they put in after?

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:08.847
Nope, nope, that's what they said, that's the important point.

01:36:09.647 --> 01:36:17.311
Health Canada expects sponsors to identify any biologically functional DNA sequences within a plasmid, such as an SV40 enhancer, at the time of submission.

01:36:17.651 --> 01:36:26.955
This was in existence prior to that, because of course, our Health Canada looks, they deal with gene therapies and everything else, that largely comes from the gene therapy regulations, right?

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:27.635
They

01:36:30.081 --> 01:36:38.767
The rule's supposed to be that they be made aware of any potentially bioactive sequence and any genetic material that's submitted to them to regulate.

01:36:39.307 --> 01:36:41.689
And if it's not, it breaks the rules.

01:36:41.789 --> 01:36:44.351
And my understanding was that that was supposed to prompt immediate recall.

01:36:45.252 --> 01:36:51.416
But what's the chance that Health Canada or anybody else, the EMA, the TGA, doesn't have access to SNAP gene?

01:36:51.436 --> 01:36:54.478
I mean, shouldn't this be minimally what they would do as part of their job?

01:36:55.146 --> 01:36:56.307
think.

01:36:56.367 --> 01:36:57.608
That's what I've learned from this, Chris.

01:36:57.888 --> 01:36:58.429
You're absolutely right.

01:36:58.489 --> 01:37:04.154
It raises for me a huge red flag, because I can't definitively say whether they do or do not do that.

01:37:04.454 --> 01:37:11.039
But I'll tell you this, Chris, moving forward, I would certainly like to hope that every regulatory agency will do this in the future.

01:37:11.219 --> 01:37:18.866
I mean, to me, that, I mean, again, Kevin is the real expert on all this molecular biological work, but it seems to me that this should have been part of the quality control process.

01:37:19.827 --> 01:37:42.496
Yeah, so let me clarify something for you, Chris, because the press release... Is anyone else seeing the irony here that when we watched Kevin McKernan from April 24th, 2020 on the Vance Crowe podcast, which you can still see at PeerTube, where it's stream.gigaohm.bio, or you can probably still see it on Twitch and on Rumble.

01:37:43.456 --> 01:37:46.699
Just go look for that second program about that appearance.

01:37:47.319 --> 01:37:57.286
And let's listen very carefully to how many times Kevin McKernan complains that the FDA and regulation is in the way and holding back our response to the pandemic.

01:37:57.346 --> 01:38:03.611
If the FDA could just get out of the way for, man, oh man, do you know that an EUA requires 10 pages of paperwork?

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:09.656
I mean, if it wasn't for the FDA, the pandemic probably would have never occurred according to April 24th, 2020, Kevin McKernan.

01:38:11.757 --> 01:38:15.338
Now Kevin McKernan is calling it a regulatory failure?

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.020
When is he gonna correct Byron Bridle here?

01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:29.562
And say that it was a regulatory framework that held us back in the first place?

01:38:32.283 --> 01:38:34.464
Or is he never gonna do that because in 2024 he was lying?

01:38:36.323 --> 01:38:37.043
Stop lying!

01:38:37.683 --> 01:38:38.804
Or maybe he's lying now.

01:38:39.604 --> 01:38:44.205
Or maybe the incoherence is part of the military operation they're executing on us.

01:38:46.166 --> 01:39:01.730
You know, this college dropout that worked at the Human Genome Project, and then after he left, he took all the intellectual property with him and sold it for millions, and now he's sitting on multi-generational wealth, and he's helping these people protect this bullshit story.

01:39:04.651 --> 01:39:05.371
That's what I see.

01:39:07.284 --> 01:39:10.487
That's why someone can be so contradictory.

01:39:10.567 --> 01:39:19.134
Go from April 24th, 2020, telling you that the EUA requiring 10 pages of paperwork is a great big pain in the ass.

01:39:19.194 --> 01:39:27.881
And all we have to thank for it is the FDA, never mentioned the PrEP Act and talk about how, oh my gosh, I've been fighting regulation my whole life.

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.423
It's just a big pain in the ass.

01:39:29.743 --> 01:39:30.824
The FDA is corrupt.

01:39:36.823 --> 01:39:38.769
Burn it all down, he's probably gonna say.

01:39:40.193 --> 01:39:40.594
Just wait.

01:39:41.087 --> 01:39:44.189
specifically called out the SV40 promoter.

01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:45.470
The press release did.

01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:54.937
But it's not in the Health Canada regulation that you must disclose the SV40 promoter sequences such as the SV40 promoter.

01:39:55.198 --> 01:40:02.283
In other words, what they wrote in the press release is a more embellished interpretation of their rules.

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:07.607
The rules didn't say you shall always disclose if there's an SV40 promoter sequence in it.

01:40:08.573 --> 01:40:11.676
No, but it's bigger than that, Steve.

01:40:11.696 --> 01:40:16.121
It says they have to disclose any biologically functional DNA sequence.

01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:16.861
Correct.

01:40:16.962 --> 01:40:18.383
Which includes SV40.

01:40:18.443 --> 01:40:26.811
Right, but the point is that the Health Canada regulations on the books do not specifically call out SV40.

01:40:27.172 --> 01:40:28.914
When they wrote the press release,

01:40:29.494 --> 01:40:30.935
That's when they added the SV.

01:40:31.095 --> 01:40:39.479
What is he saying other than making him ask the wrong questions and agree about solutions or answers to those wrong questions?

01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:42.981
Think about how he just, what did he do to Byram there?

01:40:43.582 --> 01:40:46.123
Any biologically functional DNA sequence.

01:40:46.403 --> 01:40:46.863
Correct.

01:40:46.983 --> 01:40:48.384
Which includes SV40.

01:40:48.444 --> 01:40:48.624
Right.

01:40:48.784 --> 01:40:49.204
No, no, no.

01:40:49.584 --> 01:40:56.747
But the point is that the Health Canada regulations on the books do not specifically call out SV40.

01:40:57.107 --> 01:41:04.849
When they wrote the press release, that's when they added the SV40, because they're not mind readers in being able to predict the future here.

01:41:05.049 --> 01:41:12.032
They basically just said, you have to let us know about any stuff that's in there that is bioactive.

01:41:12.572 --> 01:41:19.620
Yeah, so in other words, the regulators, yeah, they're letting Pfizer submit their sequence, and then they're letting them submit their map of the sequence.

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.824
And then there's trusting them, having complete faith.

01:41:23.864 --> 01:41:25.165
To me, I agree with Chris.

01:41:25.886 --> 01:41:26.547
Where's the policing?

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:31.591
Really, we're going to let the big pharma tell us exactly what's in there, and we're never going to question it?

01:41:32.051 --> 01:41:32.992
We're the police, guys.

01:41:33.012 --> 01:41:33.392
We're the police.

01:41:33.412 --> 01:41:39.056
Let me show you something that should have shocked them if they had opened up Snapchat.

01:41:39.676 --> 01:41:40.597
Can you guys see the screen?

01:41:40.837 --> 01:41:41.077
Yes.

01:41:41.778 --> 01:41:42.018
All right.

01:41:42.078 --> 01:41:50.384
So this would have stood out to anyone who opened this up in Snapchat, which is why the hell is there an open reading frame in both directions of the spike protein in Pfizer?

01:41:51.466 --> 01:41:54.109
That is a very long, unexpected open reading frame.

01:41:54.129 --> 01:42:00.954
So that's an entire start codon to stop codon of a gene that runs the opposite direction of the spike protein on Pfizer's vaccine.

01:42:01.235 --> 01:42:05.118
This would have been a major alarm bell if they just loaded the vector into SnapGene and looked at this.

01:42:05.498 --> 01:42:06.659
I didn't do any work here.

01:42:06.719 --> 01:42:07.960
SnapGene highlighted this for me.

01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:10.503
All right, this has been published, too, in other papers.

01:42:10.523 --> 01:42:12.425
This isn't some spooky thing that's come up on my computer.

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:21.336
People have made note of this, that the Pfizer plasmid, interestingly enough, can be read in the opposite direction without any stop codons for 1,230 amino acids or something.

01:42:21.896 --> 01:42:24.159
All right, so that's going to be a bioactive molecule.

01:42:24.379 --> 01:42:26.341
Now, when you blast that, it doesn't hit any human genes.

01:42:26.361 --> 01:42:29.024
I don't know what it is, but it's not going to be recognized itself.

01:42:30.338 --> 01:42:36.441
So it has a potential to make a very large open reading frame of non-self material in the plasmid that's being injected.

01:42:36.721 --> 01:42:43.263
But then you would have to have a very large piece of DNA in your shot, right?

01:42:43.303 --> 01:42:45.604
Which is not what Buchholz and him found.

01:42:45.644 --> 01:42:47.265
They found fragmented DNA.

01:42:48.145 --> 01:42:49.346
They haven't found whole

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.050
open reading frames of DNA.

01:42:52.091 --> 01:42:53.911
I mean, it's in the plasmid, I get that.

01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:59.713
But when it comes to what they found in the shot, this is now not being entirely genuine.

01:43:00.013 --> 01:43:01.773
That DNA is not in there.

01:43:01.953 --> 01:43:06.394
Parts of it might be, but the whole intact sequence almost certainly is not.

01:43:06.434 --> 01:43:08.955
They've never, maybe they have, I don't know.

01:43:08.995 --> 01:43:14.557
We have to look back at Buckholder's thing, whether he found large, big pieces of DNA or not.

01:43:16.037 --> 01:43:16.997
I don't think that he did.

01:43:18.798 --> 01:43:19.498
In any event,

01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:27.619
In my humble opinion, this is asking more details about something you don't need any more details about.

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:36.051
Transfection, if done in any process, was already criminally negligent to be applied to a healthy population.

01:43:37.486 --> 01:43:50.839
Now they have you asking questions about the particular process that was used and its particular outcomes and getting you to argue about whether or not they were honest about those particular processes or those particular outcomes.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.101
And that doesn't matter at all.

01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:01.491
where are the police people?

01:44:02.011 --> 01:44:03.492
So that would have helped as well.

01:44:03.872 --> 01:44:05.633
This has been known since how long?

01:44:05.693 --> 01:44:05.873
Since 2021?

01:44:06.433 --> 01:44:12.356
Ever since the sequence came out, let me see, the first sequence that came out was from Annie Fiers' lab.

01:44:12.376 --> 01:44:18.119
They did RNA sequencing and all they published was, they didn't find any vector, all they published was the spike protein region.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:28.765
And I think somebody since then, I have to pick up the right author on this, I'm forgetting their name, had noted that there was an open reading frame in the opposite direction on the spike protein that was uninhibited due to their codon optimization.

01:44:29.065 --> 01:44:32.428
But everyone wrote it off being like, well, single-stranded RNA, you'll never have that strand around.

01:44:32.468 --> 01:44:33.029
Don't worry about it.

01:44:33.089 --> 01:44:34.730
But now we know there's DNA in there.

01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:35.551
That strand is around.

01:44:36.326 --> 01:44:42.771
And that's another bioactive molecule that should have stuck out to any regulator who would like put this in the snap gene and open this.

01:44:42.811 --> 01:44:44.912
They would have said, all right, there's SV40, they didn't tell us about that.

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:48.034
There's an F1 origin that makes single-stranded DNA, they didn't tell us about that.

01:44:48.335 --> 01:44:50.676
And what the hell is this in a 1,200 amino?

01:44:50.896 --> 01:44:56.160
I just don't think that this is a relevant discussion because the plasmid was claimed not to be in the shot.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:03.165
The plasmid is about design and manufacture and it's proprietary and how they use it might be proprietary.

01:45:03.665 --> 01:45:05.547
And I really have the feeling that we are,

01:45:06.207 --> 01:45:11.991
being encouraged to bark very vigorously up the wrong tree in the wrong forest.

01:45:15.854 --> 01:45:18.116
What is ORF doing here in the opposite direction on Spike?

01:45:18.136 --> 01:45:20.358
That's not part of the virus.

01:45:20.378 --> 01:45:21.319
The virus doesn't have this.

01:45:21.419 --> 01:45:24.101
This is a codon optimization artifact that shouldn't be there.

01:45:25.722 --> 01:45:27.904
Is this on the antisense strand?

01:45:28.124 --> 01:45:28.464
It is.

01:45:28.564 --> 01:45:29.585
Yeah, it's on the other strand.

01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:35.175
We don't know if it's got a promoter or not.

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:37.618
Would the bacteria have read that and created RNA?

01:45:37.838 --> 01:45:39.520
So this is a really good question.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.066
How do you predict internal ribosomal entry sites?

01:45:44.226 --> 01:45:46.709
There aren't good computer programs to look for irises.

01:45:46.749 --> 01:45:47.389
There you go.

01:45:47.489 --> 01:45:54.231
Let's be honest here, ladies and gentlemen, because once we figure it out, we're going to figure it out and it's going to start to flood.

01:45:54.692 --> 01:45:58.493
And I think right now is one of those times when it might just flood.

01:45:58.633 --> 01:46:03.954
So let me get rid of the spinning G so you can see some of those guys up there.

01:46:05.335 --> 01:46:07.576
So what he just said there is very crucial.

01:46:07.636 --> 01:46:11.517
Now, let me refer back to my friend, Mark Kulak, who oftentimes

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:25.285
And I say this in the most complimentary way, we'll kind of stumble into something very interesting biologically with his spidey sense, but not really be able to fully see its significance.

01:46:25.325 --> 01:46:26.765
And oftentimes I can't either.

01:46:27.365 --> 01:46:36.209
One of the things that happened earlier last year was that he started to talk about this guy Venky Ramaskhani something, something guy who does ribosomes.

01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:44.195
And he, Mark started to try and make the intellectual argument that the ribosome is actually what everybody is interested in.

01:46:44.735 --> 01:46:48.217
That's the machine that everybody wants to figure out how it works.

01:46:48.277 --> 01:47:06.249
There's all these other machines, you know, like DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase and blah, blah, blah, that we have sort of made better cartoons about how they work and can at least make claims about having some fidelity of understanding of how they're constructed and how those subunits work together.

01:47:06.329 --> 01:47:06.990
Ribosomes,

01:47:08.230 --> 01:47:09.511
That's not the case at all.

01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:20.176
Ribosomes are the mystery of mysteries that are often almost exclusively hand-waved as things that are just hard to understand.

01:47:20.236 --> 01:47:33.081
Number one, because they're not just protein machines like enzymes, but they're actually composed of proteins and ribonucleic acids that work together to form their molecular clockwork machinery, however it works.

01:47:33.141 --> 01:47:34.942
It's a very, very

01:47:36.257 --> 01:47:47.211
poorly understood concept in biology, also because you are often tricked or misled into believing that all ribosomes are basically the same.

01:47:47.731 --> 01:47:52.678
Whereas it's pretty likely that my ribosomes are different than those of my kids.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:06.781
Maybe even that there are ribosomes in different tissues in my body which function differently because those tissues need a different complement of proteins with a different set of folding parameters or a different set of glycosylation rules.

01:48:09.335 --> 01:48:23.328
And we have no concept of the breadth and depth of this bouquet of potential that would be there if ribosomes are tissue specific or individual conspecific specific or ethnically specific or any of these things.

01:48:24.049 --> 01:48:25.030
They certainly are.

01:48:26.711 --> 01:48:29.935
And he gives you just a very brief flicker

01:48:31.224 --> 01:48:43.548
of this irreducible complexity when he says, we don't really have a program which can identify ribosome initiation sites, places where the ribosome decides to start reading RNA.

01:48:44.568 --> 01:48:48.510
Even though they refer to stop codons and stop codons all the time.

01:48:51.371 --> 01:48:55.192
That illusion of fidelity is just that.

01:48:56.598 --> 01:49:12.782
They talk about the ones they know, knowing that this is by far and away not an exhaustive understanding of how ribosomes decide to start and stop, how ribosomes influence or not the folding and tertiary glycosylation of things and yada, yada, yada.

01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:18.423
So listen carefully to what he says, because it's very, very important to hear it.

01:50:04.902 --> 01:50:05.622
Why did that happen?

01:50:05.642 --> 01:50:06.403
When did that go off?

01:50:06.423 --> 01:50:07.303
Somehow that clicked.

01:50:07.343 --> 01:50:07.703
Is it back now?

01:50:07.723 --> 01:50:08.343
Should be back now, right?

01:50:08.383 --> 01:50:08.503
Back?

01:50:08.523 --> 01:50:09.223
Okay, let me go back.

01:50:09.303 --> 01:50:09.563
I'll go back.

01:50:09.584 --> 01:50:10.024
Sorry about that.

01:50:10.044 --> 01:50:10.464
It actually clicked.

01:50:10.484 --> 01:50:11.104
It actually clicked off.

01:50:11.124 --> 01:50:11.864
I don't know why it did that.

01:50:11.884 --> 01:50:12.464
Okay, I'm going back.

01:50:12.504 --> 01:50:14.685
So again, the point we're trying to make, I don't know how long the sound was off.

01:50:14.705 --> 01:50:15.105
Boy, that's creepy.

01:50:36.446 --> 01:50:40.087
Um, we're going back because I want to make the point.

01:50:42.588 --> 01:50:43.508
Well, I just made it.

01:50:43.548 --> 01:50:44.368
I'm going to listen to it again.

01:50:44.508 --> 01:50:48.389
This would have been a major alarm bell if they just loaded the vector into snap gene and looked at this.

01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:49.930
I didn't do any work here.

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:51.250
Snap gene highlighted this for me.

01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:53.771
Um, all right, this has been published too in other papers.

01:50:53.791 --> 01:50:55.692
This isn't some spooky thing that's come up in my computer.

01:50:55.732 --> 01:51:04.274
Like people have made note of this, that the Pfizer plasmid, interestingly enough, can be read in the opposite direction without any stop codons for 1200 and like 30 amino acids or

01:51:04.414 --> 01:51:13.278
So without any stop codons, except for, of course, the fact that the pseudouridine often results in a stop codon because of the wobble base.

01:51:13.298 --> 01:51:14.439
So don't forget that part.

01:51:16.039 --> 01:51:23.203
And so there's also this little note here that I can see on my screen that says amyloidogenic 1, which is also

01:51:24.605 --> 01:51:24.945
Darn it.

01:51:25.566 --> 01:51:26.546
So let's keep listening.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.486
So, it has a potential to make a very large open reading frame of non-self material in the plasmid that's being injected into people.

01:51:43.007 --> 01:51:44.488
So, that would look up as well.

01:51:44.868 --> 01:51:46.650
This has been known since how long?

01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:46.870
Since 2021?

01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:50.493
Ever since the sequence came out.

01:51:51.374 --> 01:51:51.714
Let me see.

01:51:51.734 --> 01:51:53.356
The first sequence that came out was from Annie Fires Lab.

01:51:53.376 --> 01:51:55.718
They did RNA sequencing, and all they published was

01:51:56.458 --> 01:51:59.099
They didn't find any vector, and all they published was the spike protein region.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:09.785
And I think somebody since then, I have to pick up the right author on this, I'm forgetting their name, had noted that there was an open reading frame in the opposite direction on the spike protein that was uninhibited due to their codon optimization.

01:52:10.065 --> 01:52:14.027
But everyone wrote it off being like, well, single-stranded RNA, you'll never have that strand around, don't worry about it.

01:52:14.087 --> 01:52:16.548
But now we know there's DNA in there, that strand is around.

01:52:17.308 --> 01:52:23.753
And that's another bioactive molecule that should have stuck out to any regulator who would put this in the SNAP gene and open this.

01:52:23.793 --> 01:52:24.854
They would have said, all right, there's SV40.

01:52:24.874 --> 01:52:25.895
They didn't tell us about that.

01:52:26.195 --> 01:52:28.017
There's an F1 origin that makes some strand of DNA.

01:52:28.057 --> 01:52:29.018
They didn't tell us about that.

01:52:29.318 --> 01:52:33.862
And what the hell is this 1,200 amino acid ORF doing here in the opposite direction on spike?

01:52:33.902 --> 01:52:36.103
That's not part of the virus.

01:52:36.123 --> 01:52:37.064
The virus doesn't have this.

01:52:37.184 --> 01:52:39.866
This is a codon optimization artifact that shouldn't be there.

01:52:41.568 --> 01:52:43.629
Is this on the antisense strand?

01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:44.210
It is.

01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:45.291
Yeah, it's on the other strand.

01:52:47.421 --> 01:53:02.911
should we don't know if it's got a promoter or not but we don't know if it's got a promoter or not listen to him say it again it's on the antisense strand it is yeah it's on the other strand so you know we should we don't know if it's got a promoter or not but

01:53:03.504 --> 01:53:06.066
Would the bacteria have read that and created RNA?

01:53:06.706 --> 01:53:07.967
This is a really good question.

01:53:08.368 --> 01:53:12.511
How do you predict internal ribosomal entry sites?

01:53:12.671 --> 01:53:16.453
There aren't good computer programs to look for irises, internal ribosomal entry sites.

01:53:16.473 --> 01:53:19.796
This is a place where ribosomes bind down and move.

01:53:19.836 --> 01:53:23.979
That would be one very interesting thing to have tested, wouldn't it have been?

01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:32.385
One very interesting thing for them to have looked at across the population that they transfected.

01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:46.173
What signal could they have looked for with a post-transfection test to decide whether a particular, what do you call it?

01:53:46.213 --> 01:53:56.455
A ribosomal initiation signal, internal ribosome initiation signal, an iris, whether an iris was present in your body or not.

01:53:56.675 --> 01:53:58.056
Because then if it was,

01:54:00.205 --> 01:54:02.266
then maybe another protein would be expressed.

01:54:02.326 --> 01:54:09.449
Maybe they would find a signal that you would become seroprevalent to, and then they could look and go, yeah, wow, you got this, it worked.

01:54:10.089 --> 01:54:14.431
And they would know, they would know what they were reading, but you wouldn't.

01:54:15.652 --> 01:54:24.376
It would tell you that, yeah, the vaccine worked, luckily you got antibodies, and it would tell them that, yeah, he's got an iris site that corresponds to that batch.

01:54:28.183 --> 01:54:30.784
Because we don't have any programs to identify that stuff.

01:54:30.984 --> 01:54:40.127
And we know, we really do know that ribosomes are the thing that all these people have been interested in for decades.

01:54:40.267 --> 01:54:43.768
Ribosomes, they know because that's where the rubber meets the road.

01:54:43.808 --> 01:54:47.889
That's where the book is translated into the object, right?

01:54:47.929 --> 01:54:50.770
The picture of the desk and then the desk gets made.

01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:57.563
the code of the amino acids and then the amino acids get assembled and folded correctly or incorrectly.

01:54:58.083 --> 01:55:00.485
And that process is governed by ribosomes.

01:55:02.547 --> 01:55:04.488
The part that they hand wave over all the time.

01:55:07.079 --> 01:55:12.403
The one that Chris Martinson says, the spike protein is made, but it's misfolded.

01:55:13.104 --> 01:55:20.830
Doesn't talk about the truncated RNAs that are a result of bad production or by the codon optimizing.

01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:24.893
That again, remember, Kevin McCurdy came on my stream and talked about in 2021.

01:55:24.973 --> 01:55:26.794
Doesn't mention it anymore.

01:55:29.574 --> 01:55:33.080
Now, the second question is, will it make RNA off of this?

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:38.548
Well, there's an SV40 promoter over here, which is this 72 base pair piece is a bidirectional promoter.

01:55:38.568 --> 01:55:40.411
It makes RNA both directions off this molecule.

01:55:40.872 --> 01:55:43.316
So it will make an RNA that goes this long.

01:55:44.714 --> 01:55:46.155
The question is, will the ribosomes read it?

01:55:46.195 --> 01:55:49.157
Because we don't know if there's a Kozak consensus sequence anywhere in here.

01:55:49.217 --> 01:55:56.961
I didn't see one, but I'd ask others to go and look, because I've been told the iris elements are hard to bioinformatically predict.

01:55:58.161 --> 01:56:00.963
So he's just regurgitating stuff that other people told him?

01:56:02.293 --> 01:56:05.656
about the iris sites being hard to predict bioinformatically?

01:56:05.676 --> 01:56:08.137
Well, that sounds like information that people want to know.

01:56:08.157 --> 01:56:10.219
I wonder why it would be hard to predict.

01:56:10.279 --> 01:56:18.045
Maybe it's easier to predict if you have a population like China or a population like Israel, where there's a little bit more genetic uniformity.

01:56:18.485 --> 01:56:22.188
Interesting to think about if it's similar in Japan or in India.

01:56:23.942 --> 01:56:33.665
Can't be possible that all these people would have already had plans in place to make sure that they could identify internal ribosome initiation sites across different ethnicities.

01:56:34.325 --> 01:56:36.425
That would be a conspiracy theory.

01:56:36.605 --> 01:56:41.747
All this stuff up and integrates, you're going to end up getting these little open reading frames that are likely to be in frame.

01:56:41.787 --> 01:56:42.287
Good point.

01:56:42.327 --> 01:56:43.407
Good point.

01:56:43.427 --> 01:56:43.827
Good point.

01:56:43.867 --> 01:56:44.427
Good point.

01:56:44.467 --> 01:56:45.368
That's non-human.

01:56:45.768 --> 01:56:49.049
Somebody just made the point that there's no pseudouridine in the DNA plasmid.

01:56:49.089 --> 01:56:49.709
Excellent point.

01:56:49.749 --> 01:56:50.349
Thank you very much.

01:56:50.549 --> 01:56:51.830
get displayed in cells, right?

01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:55.493
It's just something that, and you're doing code on optimization, this is a flag.

01:56:55.513 --> 01:57:01.058
Like you don't want to have the opposite strand be fully coding because it's just, it's more noise in the system.

01:57:02.499 --> 01:57:03.260
So it creates risk.

01:57:04.269 --> 01:57:07.112
It creates risk, and it's a sign that no one looked at this.

01:57:07.232 --> 01:57:09.734
Pfizer gave them the sequence.

01:57:09.915 --> 01:57:11.596
They did it in 45 minutes.

01:57:11.676 --> 01:57:14.179
The lady from Moderna admitted it in a TED Talk.

01:57:14.259 --> 01:57:15.940
They got the sequence offline.

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:18.543
They added in a plasmid in 45 minutes.

01:57:18.583 --> 01:57:19.404
They were making it.

01:57:19.504 --> 01:57:20.024
Come on.

01:57:20.805 --> 01:57:23.026
This is just silly talk file.

01:57:23.046 --> 01:57:23.986
And that was the end of the story.

01:57:24.246 --> 01:57:24.446
Right.

01:57:24.546 --> 01:57:26.787
And nobody's asking, like, why did you do this?

01:57:26.887 --> 01:57:32.508
And how come, you know, this is there and why, you know, aren't you do something where you're doing something?

01:57:32.528 --> 01:57:33.028
Yeah.

01:57:33.088 --> 01:57:34.169
Why are these components needed?

01:57:34.469 --> 01:57:36.669
You can you can pull up Moderna stuff and see they don't have these things.

01:57:36.689 --> 01:57:39.990
So you're like, OK, well, one manufacturer doesn't have as many risks as the other.

01:57:40.691 --> 01:57:42.611
Well, you know, are these necessary?

01:57:42.671 --> 01:57:43.171
What's the point?

01:57:43.371 --> 01:57:48.973
I do think that Grace's dad is going to end up being right, that they are going to throw Pfizer under the bus.

01:57:49.935 --> 01:57:51.896
I mean, it definitely feels like it here, doesn't it?

01:57:53.257 --> 01:57:53.417
Yeah.

01:57:53.538 --> 01:57:53.738
Okay.

01:57:53.758 --> 01:57:55.439
So let's take this down from there.

01:57:56.179 --> 01:57:56.760
That's interesting.

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.521
This Pfizer has been pushed the hardest, right?

01:57:58.761 --> 01:57:59.141
Globally.

01:57:59.522 --> 01:57:59.802
Yeah.

01:58:00.022 --> 01:58:02.924
And the other thing in here to keep in mind right there, that's the promoter.

01:58:02.964 --> 01:58:05.166
The Ampar promoter is the promoter that Moderna uses.

01:58:05.746 --> 01:58:06.526
Pfizer has it too.

01:58:07.007 --> 01:58:09.148
So all of this stuff here is just all risk, no gain.

01:58:09.168 --> 01:58:09.609
You don't need it.

01:58:10.929 --> 01:58:11.490
Duplication.

01:58:11.530 --> 01:58:12.591
Yeah.

01:58:12.791 --> 01:58:13.151
I agree.

01:58:13.191 --> 01:58:16.753
Like my understanding is correct me if I'm wrong, Kevin, but the ideal, uh,

01:58:18.523 --> 01:58:24.628
plasmids to be using for this are the ones that are stripped down to the minimum bioactive sequence that are needed, right?

01:58:25.048 --> 01:58:27.130
No activity in mammalian cells, right?

01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:30.252
Just get rid of anything that actually creates complications.

01:58:30.953 --> 01:58:36.757
I've just got a quick question for that sequence that you were just describing, because that's a... Get rid of anything that could create complications.

01:58:36.817 --> 01:58:43.322
And if you get rid of all things that can create complications, then it sounds like to me Kevin McKernan thinks transfection and transformation.

01:58:43.823 --> 01:58:46.369
is a fantastically flawless technology.

01:58:46.409 --> 01:58:47.832
It was just executed wrong.

01:58:48.434 --> 01:58:51.260
Hear it for what he's saying because that's what he's saying.

01:58:54.186 --> 01:59:00.228
plasmids to be using for this are the ones that are stripped down to the minimum bioactive sequence that are needed, right?

01:59:00.668 --> 01:59:02.729
No activity mammalian cells, right?

01:59:02.829 --> 01:59:05.830
Just get rid of anything that's actually create complications.

01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:10.311
I've just got a quick question for that sequence that you were just describing because that's a concern for me as well.

01:59:10.991 --> 01:59:13.452
Are there any sequence similarities to any known

01:59:16.174 --> 01:59:18.956
I'll send you the sequence for it.

01:59:19.316 --> 01:59:26.923
I quickly blasted it and didn't get any hits that were of interest or made any sense, but I've been told that I shouldn't just rely on NRNR and BLAST.

01:59:26.943 --> 01:59:30.506
There could be other protein databases I should be go searching through to see if there's something else that comes up.

01:59:30.646 --> 01:59:32.367
Yeah, if you don't mind sending it to me, I'd like to have a look.

01:59:32.968 --> 01:59:35.289
Because you're right, if that gets expressed, that could be...

01:59:37.147 --> 01:59:41.936
that's something that the immune system will definitely... Well hopefully Byron will waste lots and lots of time on that, right?

01:59:41.976 --> 01:59:43.018
Because that's what they want.

01:59:43.078 --> 01:59:49.209
They want him to feel like he's contributing, that he's pushing the ball forward after all these years of having to fight for his life.

01:59:50.802 --> 02:00:00.149
while Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein and others have curated the narrative from the United States.

02:00:01.230 --> 02:00:10.856
And now they're just making him feel like he's made some difference when I guarantee you, it is because of these people that he hasn't made a difference.

02:00:11.116 --> 02:00:13.418
Definitely respond to, so it would be very bioactive.

02:00:14.288 --> 02:00:16.809
And this all links back to, I think, what Chris was saying as well.

02:00:16.849 --> 02:00:24.233
And you, Steve, with this idea of the timing with this, especially this new information, I've been swamped with questions from people like, what are the safety implications?

02:00:24.493 --> 02:00:33.497
And a lot of people have done their research and recognize that this bacterial plasmid DNA can be very long lasting, like Kevin said, especially if any of it gets integrated, then it's going to be there for the rest of the cell's life.

02:00:34.377 --> 02:00:37.339
And to me, it links to what you were talking about, about adverse events long-term.

02:00:37.819 --> 02:00:44.702
And I've said to people, and they asked me, I said, you know, I wish I could tell you, but I can't predict what long-term consequences would possibly be, because we don't know.

02:00:44.962 --> 02:00:46.042
We haven't been able to study this.

02:00:47.063 --> 02:00:48.604
But that's what we have to highlight here, right?

02:00:48.744 --> 02:00:51.685
These plasmid DNAs, we were told the modified RNAs would be

02:00:52.205 --> 02:00:54.286
gone quickly, like within 36 hours in the body.

02:00:54.306 --> 02:01:00.568
We know that's not true, but these plasmid DNAs, like Kevin can confirm, plasmid DNA, bacterial plasmid DNA, is a very robust molecule.

02:01:01.128 --> 02:01:07.390
And that, you know, so it's this kind of stuff that could potentially be a mechanistic explanation for the things you were observing, Steve, right?

02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:10.171
Why things could be happening well after having received shots.

02:01:10.811 --> 02:01:12.752
So the question is, why is it there?

02:01:12.772 --> 02:01:15.995
You know, why is it in the vaccines at all?

02:01:16.055 --> 02:01:26.202
Is it just because, well, this was the expedient, and we needed to get it out quickly, and our manufacturing process kind of left it in, and we didn't do anything to clean it up because we knew the regulators wouldn't look?

02:01:26.782 --> 02:01:32.126
Or, like, what is the rationale for all of these things being kind of in there?

02:01:32.166 --> 02:01:34.207
Because they all create risk.

02:01:34.327 --> 02:01:35.088
Why are they there?

02:01:35.648 --> 02:01:36.649
Why do you think they are there?

02:01:39.585 --> 02:01:42.106
I mean, I suspect it was warp speed type of activity.

02:01:42.486 --> 02:01:44.886
I don't, I can't get in people's heads and understand intentions.

02:01:45.206 --> 02:01:46.967
So I don't know that this is like nefariously put in there.

02:01:46.987 --> 02:01:58.350
I think when people move very quickly, I suspect Pfizer's vaccine or their plasmid, the idea behind that plasmid was, hey, we could express this in mammalian cells and that could be very helpful for us to study what type of proteins made.

02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:01.370
So let's put it in a vector that works in both bacteria and mammalian cells.

02:02:01.410 --> 02:02:02.831
That way we can shuttle it back and forth.

02:02:02.871 --> 02:02:04.671
And there's all types of more biochemistry we could do.

02:02:05.031 --> 02:02:06.752
That makes total sense to me that someone would do that.

02:02:07.612 --> 02:02:08.512
And then I probably graduate,

02:02:08.952 --> 02:02:09.492
into the vaccine.

02:02:09.853 --> 02:02:18.017
Yeah, if you're a researcher working on this spike protein, you want to put it in a plasmid that has some universality to it so you can study it in mammalian cells and then amp it up in bacteria.

02:02:18.057 --> 02:02:21.458
But that's using human beings as guinea pigs in your experiment, right?

02:02:21.638 --> 02:02:31.623
I'm suggesting they were probably, they had the interest of maybe putting this in HEK cells or something else to see, okay, let's express the spike protein in mammalian cells and then mass spec it and see how it glycosylates or whatever.

02:02:32.263 --> 02:02:37.246
You could use the plasmid as a model to study the production of the actual protein.

02:02:37.586 --> 02:02:42.812
but not in a vaccine that is given in billions of doses.

02:02:42.832 --> 02:02:47.557
They should have removed it, but they probably just ran with the research plasmid and used that as the production plasmid.

02:02:47.577 --> 02:02:50.720
Yeah, I concur.

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:51.541
I concur with Kevin.

02:02:52.924 --> 02:02:53.044
Right.

02:02:53.064 --> 02:02:56.168
We've all been told we were all assured that no corners were cut, but I agree with Kevin.

02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.769
It makes sense.

02:02:57.390 --> 02:03:00.915
What he said is exactly that's exactly how you would design something for the research stage.

02:03:01.235 --> 02:03:03.939
So, to me, this was for the preclinical and translational research phases.

02:03:04.339 --> 02:03:06.722
And to me, this is probably exactly what Kevin said.

02:03:06.762 --> 02:03:07.684
An example of.

02:03:08.402 --> 02:03:11.383
the warp speed rate at which these were developed.

02:03:11.824 --> 02:03:21.668
And so they're going to say that the original plasmid was approved and so they couldn't change from the original plasmid that was given the EUA when they went into production.

02:03:21.708 --> 02:03:26.470
They had to stick with the same plasmid even though they changed the process supposedly.

02:03:27.628 --> 02:03:43.940
So we're about to be told a story which is full of contradiction and full of incongruency because they changed the process, but we're supposed to believe they saved the plasmid because the plasmid got the EUA, but not the process.

02:03:45.558 --> 02:03:57.608
which I think has to be incorrect, but again, more work is gonna be necessary to crack this illusion, but I guarantee you, we are pressing our face painfully against the brick wall right now.

02:03:58.029 --> 02:04:03.874
Coming out and the fact that they didn't have the time to redesign the plasmid, like Kevin said, for the clinical use.

02:04:03.934 --> 02:04:04.114
Right.

02:04:04.747 --> 02:04:05.968
Right, now this is making sense.

02:04:06.008 --> 02:04:07.609
And they probably thought they could get rid of it all, right?

02:04:07.689 --> 02:04:09.089
Oh, we're just gonna erase that.

02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:12.031
So we're gonna cover our tracks and no one will know that we used the research plasmid.

02:04:12.531 --> 02:04:14.693
Exactly, and so Kevin, I've got a quick question for you.

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:23.798
I think it's very important, Steve, because I just like to get confirmation from Kevin, because I respect his expertise in this as being far greater than mine, because it was confusing to me.

02:04:23.838 --> 02:04:32.883
So I'll disclose, I sat on the advisory committee for graduate student over the past couple of years, who was developing an mRNA vaccine for use in poultry actually,

02:04:33.759 --> 02:04:41.864
And of course, we advised that after the mRNA was made—so it wasn't the modified RNA—but after the mRNA was made, to get rid of the DNA.

02:04:42.424 --> 02:04:45.947
And they used DNAs, you know, an enzyme that can digest it, and they had no problem getting rid of it.

02:04:46.347 --> 02:04:56.313
So I was very confused at first, but then I saw a paper recently suggesting that the issue here is with these modified RNAs, that you get all of these odd, like, multi-strand—in fact,

02:04:57.073 --> 02:05:00.634
DNA and RNA combinations and stuff.

02:05:00.694 --> 02:05:03.455
And apparently it makes it very difficult to actually get rid of the DNA.

02:05:04.115 --> 02:05:04.495
Is that true?

02:05:04.535 --> 02:05:04.835
It does.

02:05:05.315 --> 02:05:11.276
If you look at Moderna's RNA, they have a hundredfold more spike DNA than they have vector DNA.

02:05:11.416 --> 02:05:16.978
So when their DNA goes to town, it clears out the backbone of the plasma, but it can't digest the spike DNA as well.

02:05:17.018 --> 02:05:21.519
And that's presumably because there's a lot of spike RNA that's protecting the DNA from nucleus activity.

02:05:22.139 --> 02:05:30.882
So when T7 makes RNA, and you're putting in these modified nucleotides that alter the melting temperature of the RNA, and they're really sticky, what happens is you get a triple helix.

02:05:30.922 --> 02:05:33.563
You get an RNA, an R-loop, which is an RNA-DNA hybrid.

02:05:33.844 --> 02:05:36.325
And some nucleases are good at resolving that, and some aren't.

02:05:36.405 --> 02:05:37.485
They use DNA as one.

02:05:37.965 --> 02:05:41.126
If you go through, just simply through any of these catalog, you would not use that.

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:44.828
You would use DNA XT, which is actually designed to get rid of R-loops.

02:05:45.328 --> 02:05:47.229
So there's other nucleases that can be used to clean this up.

02:05:47.269 --> 02:05:50.050
And I think people should know that this is a very fixable problem.

02:05:50.590 --> 02:05:52.931
And I think even if they fix it, I don't think they're out of the woods.

02:05:53.991 --> 02:05:59.934
I just want to emphasize the fact that this moves so quickly that they use the first enzyme you would pick, which is DNase 1.

02:06:00.294 --> 02:06:05.716
But there's many other enzymes that have been evolved to actually do a better job at solving this problem that they never got to.

02:06:06.256 --> 02:06:07.897
And I wouldn't be surprised if they could fix it very quickly.

02:06:08.497 --> 02:06:10.039
So, Kevin, I find it very interesting.

02:06:10.059 --> 02:06:16.768
I didn't realize that it's so interesting that you've identified other DNAs that could be used to more effectively get rid of this stuff.

02:06:16.809 --> 02:06:25.781
So, with that, my understanding is, looking at your preprint article, your very recent one that you just released a few days ago, that it was the first evaluation of

02:06:26.461 --> 02:06:27.201
It is correct.

02:06:27.261 --> 02:06:27.922
You are right.

02:06:28.042 --> 02:06:29.962
I looked it up, and you are right.

02:06:30.002 --> 02:06:31.563
It's eight months ago that this was.

02:06:31.623 --> 02:06:35.244
It's a little bit older than I thought it was.

02:06:36.184 --> 02:06:37.725
You're right that I said it was.

02:06:38.385 --> 02:06:41.726
But I think it's appropriate on Thursday, a little throwback to eight months ago.

02:06:41.766 --> 02:06:45.047
And before that, we went back before the pandemic with Chris Martinson.

02:06:45.087 --> 02:06:46.788
So thanks for pointing that out.

02:06:46.908 --> 02:06:51.569
It's Oizen Page definitely is correct there.

02:06:51.689 --> 02:06:53.070
Moderna's newest booster.

02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:56.831
And I'll tell you, so I know, of course.

02:06:56.972 --> 02:06:58.672
Thank you for putting that link in, by the way.

02:06:58.992 --> 02:07:03.494
I really appreciate when people do that, because I don't, I should be doing that, but I'm not.

02:07:03.554 --> 02:07:06.496
So we're close with David Speaker, who was doing a lot of research.

02:07:06.856 --> 02:07:09.757
I told him I'm 100% convinced they will fix the problem and got rid of it.

02:07:10.497 --> 02:07:11.197
But yet it's still there.

02:07:11.297 --> 02:07:12.638
The DNA contamination is still there.

02:07:12.898 --> 02:07:13.638
So there's the question.

02:07:13.678 --> 02:07:18.540
And if somebody like you, they could have called you up and pick your brain about, okay, you've identified.

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.441
See, this is what research does.

02:07:19.461 --> 02:07:21.581
You identify a problem and then you come up with potential solutions.

02:07:21.661 --> 02:07:23.822
So why do you think they wouldn't have got rid of that?

02:07:24.322 --> 02:07:28.204
Because then they could say, for all this stuff you're raising, they could say, moot.

02:07:28.304 --> 02:07:29.304
It's all moot point, right?

02:07:29.344 --> 02:07:30.525
It's all the historical shots.

02:07:31.605 --> 02:07:33.827
Yeah, I think there's a lot of us that have a liability waiver.

02:07:33.867 --> 02:07:35.068
Everything's moot and irrelevant.

02:07:35.348 --> 02:07:44.014
So there's no motivation for them to fix this, which is why we really need to lean on the regulators to push on this because... Oh, so we really need to lean on the regulators to push this.

02:07:44.094 --> 02:07:49.959
But unfortunately, our regulators are crap or they're corrupt, which is what he told us in April of 2024.

02:07:50.039 --> 02:07:53.561
We had to get rid of all regulation, deregulate everything.

02:07:53.622 --> 02:07:55.883
Otherwise, this was going to be a disaster.

02:07:56.424 --> 02:08:00.727
I hear some pretty interesting contradictions and incongruities.

02:08:01.708 --> 02:08:05.693
So they're just going to keep claiming it's safe and effective until one of their family members dies.

02:08:05.713 --> 02:08:06.995
In fact, there's risk if they change it, right?

02:08:07.015 --> 02:08:12.022
There's risk if they change it because they'd have to then do another clinical trial and they'd be back to square one.

02:08:12.042 --> 02:08:12.883
So why change it?

02:08:13.243 --> 02:08:14.245
But this is the interesting thing.

02:08:14.285 --> 02:08:17.289
So what you just raised, Kevin, is this legal indemnity that they have.

02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:22.455
which I was just sharing with Steve the other day that I read a very recent ruling in Michigan, right?

02:08:22.635 --> 02:08:30.102
It was a guy who got badly injured after getting remdesivir, and it was a lot that was known to be contaminated with tiny glass particles, right?

02:08:30.863 --> 02:08:33.285
It had been recalled, but it was given to him anyways.

02:08:33.345 --> 02:08:36.228
The hospital hadn't returned their batch at that point.

02:08:36.748 --> 02:08:43.853
And he launched a lawsuit, it went to court, and Gilead Sciences, who manufactures the remdesivir, was named at the lawsuit.

02:08:43.873 --> 02:08:57.563
They immediately claimed the legal indemnity, but a court in Michigan just ruled that, well, it was interesting, they agreed, Gilead Sciences, they agreed, yes, you have legal indemnity for the approved components of your product, right, that ingredient list.

02:08:58.164 --> 02:09:01.646
But you don't have legal indemnity for contaminants.

02:09:02.547 --> 02:09:05.369
And so would that not apply here to Pfizer?

02:09:06.576 --> 02:09:09.927
I think so because they didn't include, when you look at their ingredient list, there isn't any DNA on it.

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:11.750
Exactly, exactly.

02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:12.430
It's not on the list.

02:09:12.650 --> 02:09:19.195
I remember we both spoke at the World Council for Health a few days ago as well, and I showed the ingredient.

02:09:19.535 --> 02:09:27.540
So we had a Freedom of Information Request to confirm what Health Canada actually saw, and Health Canada has now, through a Freedom of Information Request, released it.

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.084
And we also have confirmed definitively that Health Canada, on their approved ingredient list, there's no plasmid DNA.

02:09:33.144 --> 02:09:39.028
And now they've admitted that with that, and in addition, so even if there was that there,

02:09:39.748 --> 02:09:43.931
Still, one can argue the SV40, like Kevin said, was not disclosed, so that's not an approved.

02:09:43.971 --> 02:09:49.214
So even if that were okay, they were okay with some plasma DNA, they weren't okay with the SV40.

02:09:49.254 --> 02:09:53.497
So the way I look at it legally, I don't know how Pfizer can possibly escape legal indemnity here.

02:09:54.215 --> 02:09:55.877
Well, I think they're going to go for it.

02:09:56.397 --> 02:10:00.521
One possible way, though, with glass particles, you have the contaminant and you have the harm.

02:10:01.022 --> 02:10:02.704
They might say, well, there's no harm from this.

02:10:02.744 --> 02:10:03.905
So can I rewind just a bit?

02:10:03.925 --> 02:10:06.868
Because we were talking about the possible harm that this might come from this.

02:10:06.968 --> 02:10:09.711
Well, you don't know it's hard that there's harm is the is the issue.

02:10:10.131 --> 02:10:12.694
Well, well, so, but they're going to try and evade that.

02:10:12.714 --> 02:10:14.176
So let me just play devil's advocate here.

02:10:14.196 --> 02:10:17.579
So, so they're going to say, Oh, you know, they're not replication competent.

02:10:17.639 --> 02:10:21.684
And even if they were there, they're actually only in bacteria and there's no bacteria in your deltoid.

02:10:21.884 --> 02:10:24.627
Did he say they're not replication competent?

02:10:24.707 --> 02:10:26.369
What's not replication competent?

02:10:26.409 --> 02:10:27.510
The DNA fragments.

02:10:28.992 --> 02:10:30.474
Why did he choose those words?

02:10:32.503 --> 02:10:36.404
You think he chose those words because that's how to describe this?

02:10:36.624 --> 02:10:46.727
Or do you think he chose those words because he's actively absorbing gigaohm biological content in order to obfuscate our relevance?

02:10:47.707 --> 02:10:50.767
I'm sorry, I don't want to be egoistic, but that's what's happening here.

02:10:51.328 --> 02:10:53.428
Nobody else uses those words but us.

02:10:54.368 --> 02:10:56.349
Replication-competent DNA.

02:10:57.335 --> 02:10:59.396
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, boy!

02:10:59.976 --> 02:11:01.957
That is amazing shit right there.

02:11:11.027 --> 02:11:13.568
Well, well, so, but they're going to try and evade that.

02:11:13.588 --> 02:11:15.029
So let me just play devil's advocate here.

02:11:15.049 --> 02:11:18.431
So, so they're going to say, Oh, you know, they're not replication competent.

02:11:18.491 --> 02:11:23.894
And even if they were there, they're actually only in bacteria and there's no bacteria in your deltoid, um, et cetera.

02:11:23.914 --> 02:11:28.857
So, so can you, can you lay out the, the, how would this stuff get uptaken and do the harm?

02:11:30.718 --> 02:11:31.438
Yeah, I think you're right.

02:11:31.458 --> 02:11:33.139
They're going to, they're going to point out it's all broken up.

02:11:33.199 --> 02:11:35.741
It's with, now don't forget that Sabine Hazan,

02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:48.996
makes the argument that these DNA can be expressed and these plasmids can be expressed in the gut of your microbiome.

02:11:50.998 --> 02:11:55.381
Because, you know, that's bacteria.

02:11:58.964 --> 02:12:01.646
And that's significant and it should be on your radar.

02:12:11.038 --> 02:12:17.001
Just make sure that's on your radar, because we're going to, at some point, have to address her work and her contribution to this.

02:12:17.041 --> 02:12:22.804
Within the limits, and the limits are at 10 nanograms per microliter and less than 200 or over 200 bases.

02:12:22.884 --> 02:12:24.085
And we meet all those criteria.

02:12:24.305 --> 02:12:26.826
And there's some lots that don't meet that criteria.

02:12:27.366 --> 02:12:29.467
And depending on how you measure them, there's a big debate on that.

02:12:29.487 --> 02:12:30.248
But let's put that aside.

02:12:30.268 --> 02:12:35.531
I think what wasn't considered in those regulations is that the DNA be encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.

02:12:36.051 --> 02:12:39.172
They were assuming like a 10 minute half-life of DNA in the blood, which I agree with them.

02:12:39.212 --> 02:12:39.993
If it's just injected,

02:12:40.533 --> 02:13:03.948
it's going to get eaten apart and it probably won't have it'll it'll be an adjuvant is what they'll say is every every contaminant they find eventually graduates into an adjuvant category um and so they'll they'll pin it on that as look it's doing a little interferon response over here that could be good for you um so but but the fact that it's that we know it's in the LMPs means it's materially different than what they evaluated in the past and we've seen even some FDA so that's pretty terrible right because now

02:13:04.608 --> 02:13:06.169
contaminants are adjuvants.

02:13:06.409 --> 02:13:12.792
He's almost kind of giving the vaccine industry the benefit of the doubt with regard to real adjuvants then, isn't he?

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:19.215
It's already saying that adjuvants do something in other vaccines other than just be toxic.

02:13:21.376 --> 02:13:22.356
It's extraordinary.

02:13:22.376 --> 02:13:30.420
You need to hear it because every one of these statements is probably chosen more or less scripted, maybe even listed in front of them, the ones that are playing.

02:13:33.132 --> 02:13:44.255
It's Kilman, I think, is a paper we referenced, or Klinman, we referenced in our recent preprint that shows if there's any of these bioactive pieces of DNA, the limit doesn't go to 200 bases.

02:13:44.275 --> 02:13:45.395
They're worried about seven bases.

02:13:45.455 --> 02:13:48.456
Even as small as seven bases that can integrate and disrupt a gene is a problem.

02:13:48.976 --> 02:13:52.097
So we really have to focus them on, this isn't about naked DNA.

02:13:52.217 --> 02:13:58.259
This is about transfection-competent DNA going in that's bioactive that could get to the nucleus and create a genotoxic event.

02:13:58.299 --> 02:14:00.080
And you did no studies on genotoxicity.

02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:00.800
These were waived.

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:06.603
So you can't say that there's no genotoxicity because you gave them a hall pass on genotoxic.

02:14:07.083 --> 02:14:10.205
So we really have to focus them on, this isn't about naked DNA.

02:14:10.325 --> 02:14:16.308
This is about transfection competent DNA going in that's bioactive that could get to the nucleus and create a genotoxic event.

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.489
And you did no studies on it.

02:14:17.509 --> 02:14:21.091
I'm telling you the use of competent there is bullshit and wrong.

02:14:22.532 --> 02:14:24.052
They are making up words right now.

02:14:24.092 --> 02:14:30.376
They are making new combinations of words to absorb this idea of competent

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:37.425
viral particles and the debate about whether or not a viral particle is competent.

02:14:37.465 --> 02:14:46.333
They are trying to absorb it into this debate so that when you search for stuff and when you try to understand it, it's going to start to get all intertwined here.

02:14:46.914 --> 02:14:57.504
I can guarantee, almost, I would bet a lot of money that if you went before 2020 and tried to find someone talking about transfection competent DNA, you couldn't find that combination of three terms.

02:14:58.143 --> 02:14:58.864
genotoxicity.

02:14:59.004 --> 02:14:59.604
These were waived.

02:15:00.685 --> 02:15:05.349
So you can't say that there's no genotoxicity because you gave them a hall pass on genotoxicity.

02:15:06.129 --> 02:15:07.931
And now we have a mechanism that could induce this.

02:15:08.111 --> 02:15:09.692
So this needs to be looked at.

02:15:11.273 --> 02:15:17.318
We already had a mechanism by which transfection was criminally negligent for healthy humans.

02:15:17.358 --> 02:15:19.219
We don't need a mechanism by which

02:15:20.261 --> 02:15:23.065
Harm might be caused by DNA specifically.

02:15:23.126 --> 02:15:27.453
This is absurd But it is exactly the limited spectrum of debate.

02:15:27.493 --> 02:15:28.515
They want to trap people in

02:15:28.766 --> 02:15:40.237
Chris, I think they're going to go into exactly what you said, is they're going to say there's no evidence of harm, safe and effective, all these people passed it, and by the way, these nanogram limits we put in place means that we're okay.

02:15:40.577 --> 02:15:47.824
It's important that people know those nanogram limits were a thousand fold lower before the Reagan, what is it, the NCBIA Act.

02:15:48.485 --> 02:15:51.608
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, they were at 10 picograms before that.

02:15:52.148 --> 02:15:58.774
They put that in place, and then the DNA contamination guidelines ballooned 1,000-fold in 10 years.

02:15:59.915 --> 02:16:03.998
Those nanogram limits were 1,000-fold lower before the NCBIA.

02:16:10.891 --> 02:16:14.693
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, they were at 10 picograms before that.

02:16:15.213 --> 02:16:21.837
They put that in place and then the nanogram or the DNA contamination guidelines ballooned a thousand fold in 10 years.

02:16:22.997 --> 02:16:26.799
So there's- But that's not what protects now, right?

02:16:26.859 --> 02:16:39.826
So again, here we are, not really talking about the right legal context in the right legal way and referencing something that doesn't, I don't think it plays the way that he's playing it.

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:48.566
and especially doesn't play with regard to these biologics because they're governed under the PrEP Act and the emergency declared within.

02:16:48.666 --> 02:16:54.470
So that's again, in my opinion, although I'm not a lawyer, this was just a distraction there.

02:16:54.510 --> 02:17:01.156
He just mentioned something that you're gonna Google and think about and add to your list of complicated details.

02:17:02.449 --> 02:17:09.914
The criminal vaccine schedule in America was criminal before the pandemic, and so any PrEP Act version of it is definitely criminal, too.

02:17:10.274 --> 02:17:18.900
There used to be a much lower limit, and the limits that they designed were based on host cell genomic DNA, which at 10 nanograms, you're talking about 1,200 copies of the human genome.

02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:19.781
That's not a lot of copies.

02:17:20.541 --> 02:17:25.902
10 nanograms of this material is like 200 billion pieces of DNA with active oxides and hydroxyls.

02:17:26.163 --> 02:17:31.304
This is material that's ready to cause some harm, or at least get ligated into something.

02:17:32.204 --> 02:17:38.426
But I do want to bring up one point that Chris is punching on here, because this is a good devil's advocate position here.

02:17:38.446 --> 02:17:43.507
I've heard this from others online too, which is, hey, any cell that gets transfected with spikes is going to be dead, right?

02:17:43.607 --> 02:17:46.328
So why do you care if it's dragging other crap along for the ride?

02:17:47.689 --> 02:17:50.511
And I've kind of pushed back on that being like, well, is that true?

02:17:50.551 --> 02:17:51.451
Is it binary?

02:17:51.471 --> 02:17:52.973
Is it any cell that gets transfected dies?

02:17:52.993 --> 02:17:58.517
Because if that's so, how come it shows up in like breast milk and plasma and exosomes and all this other stuff like a year later?

02:17:59.197 --> 02:18:01.379
I don't know that it's 100% kill rate on transfection.

02:18:01.399 --> 02:18:04.742
I think there's a population that seems to limp along for a long period of time.

02:18:05.402 --> 02:18:07.344
And those are the ones we have to worry about for tumors.

02:18:07.924 --> 02:18:10.605
Wow, so that's a pretty bold claim there, right?

02:18:10.625 --> 02:18:12.446
Because limps along meaning what?

02:18:12.486 --> 02:18:16.967
That they test positive for the spike protein, which isn't produced in high fidelity?

02:18:17.127 --> 02:18:26.330
These are very hand-waving stories that are being told now about what we know and don't know about post-transfection symptomology.

02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:28.471
Again, because we're only using their tools.

02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:34.127
If we want to detect something after transfection, we have to use their tools.

02:18:34.207 --> 02:18:38.113
Nobody's genuinely investigating this, certainly not these people.

02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:41.001
It's extraordinary what he says here.

02:18:41.041 --> 02:18:42.002
I want to listen to it again.

02:18:42.182 --> 02:18:44.443
Cell that gets transfected with spikes is going to be dead, right?

02:18:44.543 --> 02:18:47.285
So why do you care if it's dragging other crap along for the ride?

02:18:48.606 --> 02:18:51.408
And I've kind of pushed back on that, being like, well, is that true?

02:18:51.448 --> 02:18:52.349
Is it binary?

02:18:52.369 --> 02:18:53.870
Is it any cell that gets transfected dies?

02:18:53.890 --> 02:18:58.313
Because if that's so, how come it shows up in breast milk and plasma and exosomes and all this other stuff?

02:18:58.473 --> 02:19:09.000
And so he's really trying to set forth the idea that you needed to have transformation of cells and transfection of cells with the DNA in order for it to exist this long.

02:19:09.921 --> 02:19:17.388
Because otherwise, if it would have worked as intended, those cells that express the protein would have been destroyed and we wouldn't have this problem.

02:19:18.809 --> 02:19:34.404
So there is, again, a little bit of contradiction and a little bit of incongruity there in his cartoon biology that he explains with words that sound good together but don't make biological sense when strung the way that they are being strung.

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:38.668
Like a year later, I don't know that it's 100% kill rate on transfection.

02:19:38.688 --> 02:19:42.030
I think there's a population that seems to limp along for a long period of time.

02:19:42.691 --> 02:19:44.812
And those are the ones we have to look at for tumors.

02:19:44.932 --> 02:19:46.453
Oh yeah, says Steve Kirsch.

02:19:46.673 --> 02:19:47.174
Oh yeah.

02:19:48.755 --> 02:19:49.315
Please.

02:19:51.897 --> 02:19:52.977
Is that your understanding, Byron?

02:19:52.997 --> 02:19:55.479
Because I'm not as dialed in on the immunology front here.

02:19:56.141 --> 02:19:59.522
Well, so I can give you one example right off the bat.

02:19:59.902 --> 02:20:03.863
Immunoprivileged sites would not be susceptible to being killed off, right?

02:20:03.883 --> 02:20:13.345
So we're talking about places like the testes, ovaries, the eye, the central nervous system, et cetera.

02:20:13.405 --> 02:20:14.446
So there's lots of tissues.

02:20:14.726 --> 02:20:22.728
And this is the interesting thing too, because there's- Oh, so all the places that the lipid nanoparticles not supposed to go,

02:20:23.834 --> 02:20:28.836
that have nothing to do with whether you get a bolus or not, but he's still cited Marc Giraudot.

02:20:29.937 --> 02:20:40.842
So you see this little tiny network, and whenever they can throw in a name of one of these puppets or people that are on their team, they do it, even when it's completely irrelevant, like Marc Giraudot.

02:20:41.834 --> 02:20:43.475
It's extraordinary when you hear it.

02:20:43.735 --> 02:20:46.216
It's just like right so far in your face.

02:20:46.657 --> 02:20:48.037
The bricks are scratching me.

02:20:48.238 --> 02:20:51.900
Avalanche sites would not be susceptible to being killed off, right?

02:20:51.920 --> 02:21:01.305
So we're talking about places like the testes, ovaries, the eye, the central nervous system, you know, et cetera.

02:21:01.365 --> 02:21:02.425
So there's lots of tissues.

02:21:02.706 --> 02:21:04.947
And this is the interesting thing too.

02:21:05.672 --> 02:21:09.193
Because I was going to say, then the question becomes, what's the biodistribution?

02:21:09.213 --> 02:21:10.614
It's so funny, isn't it, Steve?

02:21:10.674 --> 02:21:12.414
It's so funny, isn't it, Steve?

02:21:14.755 --> 02:21:15.375
Of this DNA.

02:21:15.395 --> 02:21:17.816
And that also links to what you were asking, Chris, because this is interesting.

02:21:17.836 --> 02:21:19.457
So even what you were saying, Kevin, I agree.

02:21:19.517 --> 02:21:22.938
If this is free in the blood, it is going to be degraded.

02:21:22.978 --> 02:21:26.319
But remember, in the blood are phagocytic cells, like the monocytes you were talking about.

02:21:26.379 --> 02:21:30.200
And there's also macrophages that can be in the blood just before they go into tissues.

02:21:30.981 --> 02:21:31.781
And they can be dendritic cells.

02:21:31.801 --> 02:21:34.422
These are what we call the phagocytic cells of our immune system.

02:21:35.097 --> 02:21:40.459
And these cells can't—they're not really efficient, but they can take up naked bacterial plasmid DNA.

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:41.600
But this is the thing.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:47.622
That uptake is dramatically amplified when these things are bound to lipid nanoparticles.

02:21:48.642 --> 02:21:53.144
And we're talking cationic lipids that are making up these lipid nanoparticles, so based on the charge,

02:21:53.988 --> 02:21:58.915
of the plasmid DNA, it can't efficiently bind to those cationic lipid nanoparticles.

02:21:58.935 --> 02:22:02.680
And so this raises two questions that are problems based on what you brought up, Chris.

02:22:03.141 --> 02:22:09.530
First, a while back you were saying, how do we differentiate between harms due to the spike and harms due to things like the cationic plasmid DNA?

02:22:09.810 --> 02:22:23.975
The easy answer would be, if all the plasmid DNA was free-floating in there, then you remove the lipid nanoparticles with the modified RNA, you just have that plasmid DNA and you administer that, say in an animal model, versus the whole dose.

02:22:25.419 --> 02:22:26.140
and see what the effect is.

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:32.443
But the problem is, like Kevin said, they're married to the lipid nanoparticles, which are married to the modified RNA, which expresses the spike.

02:22:32.503 --> 02:22:34.725
So we can't parse this out very easily.

02:22:35.205 --> 02:22:46.452
But my concern then, Kevin, is because they're associated with these lipid nanoparticles, that means they get distributed to wherever the lipid nanoparticles go, which go to some of these areas.

02:22:47.682 --> 02:22:54.005
Yeah, I think if you look at the biodistribution studies of the luciferase mRNA, that's where all the DNA is going, because I don't think this DNA is on its own.

02:22:54.025 --> 02:23:02.549
I think it's actually hybridized to the RNA, and it's going into the cell as a DNA-RNA hybrid, just because DNA-RNA hybrids are more stable than DNA-DNA hybrids.

02:23:02.649 --> 02:23:05.670
Thermodynamically, that's what's going to happen, is those two are going to be stuck together.

02:23:05.890 --> 02:23:11.873
There's a higher concentration of the RNA than the DNA, so all the DNA is going to get pulled out of solution to the RNA, and it's going to get presented to the cell as a DNA-RNA hybrid.

02:23:12.333 --> 02:23:19.078
Yeah, and you see, the way that's a concern, Kevin, is because when it's phagocytic cells, phagocytic cells will often travel, especially if you pick things up.

02:23:19.378 --> 02:23:22.981
Just remember that he said that this is a problem that can be solved, right?

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:24.922
And specifically, Kevin said that.

02:23:25.022 --> 02:23:29.826
This is a problem that can be solved.

02:23:31.952 --> 02:23:39.594
So now the only question is, how long are they going to dig into this stupid, complicated explanation for this problem?

02:23:40.114 --> 02:23:50.777
Because the longer they dig into it, and the longer they work together to create this illusion of consensus that we're asking the right questions, and then sub-questions of these questions are definitely relevant,

02:23:51.297 --> 02:23:56.962
Then they keep Byron Bridle busy working on this hamster wheel where he'll never get out and say, hey, wait a minute.

02:23:57.042 --> 02:24:03.187
What was the underlying narrative that justified the rollout of these transfections that they knew all along was gonna be bad?

02:24:06.009 --> 02:24:12.374
Did they murder people in the United States and lie about it so that people in Canada would take these shots without questioning them?

02:24:14.496 --> 02:24:19.760
Did they lie and murder people in America so that people around the world would take these shots?

02:24:21.135 --> 02:24:24.096
Because that's a question that none of these Americans are asking.

02:24:25.416 --> 02:24:41.860
None of these Americans have ever thought about the possibility that just like they might have demolished buildings in New York City to blame it on terrorists, they might have murdered people and lied about it in order to blame it on a natural or lab leak virus.

02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:46.341
And none of these Americans are sophisticated enough to see through it.

02:24:47.932 --> 02:25:01.528
And they could very easily say, hey Byron, wouldn't it be crazy if Americans or traders in America allowed the murder of some Americans and then lied about it so that people like you in Canada would be fooled into taking a transfection?

02:25:01.888 --> 02:25:05.792
Wouldn't that be a much more effective message?

02:25:11.437 --> 02:25:13.239
Byram is definitely no traitor.

02:25:13.299 --> 02:25:14.380
I don't think he is at all.

02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:28.572
But I think these three people are working very, very hard to project an illusion of consensus that Byram can't see through and is actually trapped in, not only on this stream, but I'm sure off the stream as well.

02:25:28.973 --> 02:25:29.914
The lymph nodes and so on.

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:35.659
So they would be susceptible, I believe, to killing eventually once there's an immune response mounted against the spike protein.

02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:40.823
But what you're talking about then is we're talking about any cell being able to take these up.

02:25:40.963 --> 02:25:42.504
So wherever those lipid nanoparticles go.

02:25:42.624 --> 02:25:54.272
I mean, what you see right now with Pierre Kory saying something about the vaccine schedule in general is him stepping in front of Peter McCullough, who already had the guts to go off script and say that a long time ago.

02:25:55.834 --> 02:26:00.777
I really think Peter McCullough is closer to being on our team than any of these other people, that's for sure.

02:26:01.157 --> 02:26:03.079
Byram excluded.

02:26:04.534 --> 02:26:09.380
You'll notice the regulators spend a lot more time diving into the double-stranded RNA numbers than the DNA numbers.

02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:14.285
And that's because the double-stranded RNA induces all types of mayhem inside the cell.

02:26:14.325 --> 02:26:17.789
But I don't know that we have as much information on what happens with DNA-RNA hybrids.

02:26:17.849 --> 02:26:19.791
I imagine those look pretty ugly to the cell as well.

02:26:20.052 --> 02:26:21.673
That's a less-studied field.

02:26:24.036 --> 02:26:27.841
They're doing something really weird measuring the double-stranded RNA, which is another area we want to dig into.

02:26:27.881 --> 02:26:31.926
I mean, they're using some ELISA assay to quantitate that, and that should all be done, I think, with next-generation sequencing.

02:26:31.946 --> 02:26:39.015
Because when we look at this through an RNA sequencing process, we see all types of Watson strand RNA that shouldn't be there under the spike.

02:26:39.275 --> 02:26:42.657
When you do RNA sequencing, you should get all Crick strands, which are scent strands, right?

02:26:42.677 --> 02:26:44.118
Because the T7 makes one RNA.

02:26:44.498 --> 02:26:45.939
But when you do RNA sequencing, you don't see that.

02:26:46.259 --> 02:26:51.562
You see all types of sequence coverage on the wrong strand, which means there's a lot of double-stranded RNA in there that hasn't been accounted for.

02:26:51.662 --> 02:26:57.866
And the assay they're using is something that, I don't know if anyone's ever validated that on RNA that has this methyl decorated like this.

02:26:57.926 --> 02:26:59.767
And there's 800 more methyl groups on this RNA.

02:26:59.787 --> 02:27:07.712
I would imagine that ELISA is probably- Think about all these details that don't matter when transfection in healthy humans was criminally negligent, no matter how pure they made it.

02:27:09.036 --> 02:27:23.515
But they're wasting minutes and hours talking about the details of this process too, which they already knew from the very beginning would never result in a pure RNA because of the nature of the biochemistry of DNA, RNA, and proteins.

02:27:24.386 --> 02:27:34.570
The typical processes which are used to purify a biologic-like and monoclonal antibody do not work with regard to RNA and DNA separation and purification.

02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:35.550
And they knew that.

02:27:36.090 --> 02:27:42.473
This guy who dropped out of college to work at the Human Genome Project at the Whitehead Institute, he knew that.

02:27:43.913 --> 02:27:53.497
This guy who dropped out of a pharmaceutical company a decade ago to get on the PBS NewsHour as a guy who was speaking out against the national debt and growing population, he knew that.

02:27:56.414 --> 02:28:03.636
And that guy's not sophisticated enough to have invented the thing that he claims he invented and being the serial entrepreneur that he is.

02:28:06.256 --> 02:28:07.496
He's also just a fake.

02:28:10.817 --> 02:28:18.739
They are all being promoted as people that know stuff and they are all agreeing to go on camera and agree that they know stuff.

02:28:20.273 --> 02:28:23.974
in order to get Byron Bridle to think that he's still making a difference.

02:28:24.454 --> 02:28:26.015
That's how malevolent this is.

02:28:26.035 --> 02:28:28.355
I've never seen that before and might be undercounting it.

02:28:28.395 --> 02:28:33.717
So I think there's a lot of other aspects in here that need to be dug into outside just the DNA contamination.

02:28:34.537 --> 02:28:34.897
I agree.

02:28:34.957 --> 02:28:46.461
And Kevin, I wanted to just highlight one other thing, one thought about what you raised, about how they might try and make the argument, right, that this DNA contamination could potentially serve as an adjuvant.

02:28:47.265 --> 02:28:57.035
And you're absolutely right in the sense that our immune system, for obvious reasons, for fighting off bacterial pathogens, is very good at recognizing bacterial DNA, and it's a potent stimulator of the immune system.

02:28:57.215 --> 02:29:01.839
But I'm thinking, for example, of the fact that these shots are being administered to women who are pregnant.

02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:09.547
One of the things you always, always, always want to avoid in somebody who's pregnant is anything that would cause systemic inflammation.

02:29:10.007 --> 02:29:13.488
Because stomach inflammation means it could potentially inflate it.

02:29:13.548 --> 02:29:18.330
So now we're here on the Naomi Wolf arguing point that we should have never given this to pregnant women.

02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:19.230
Well, no shit.

02:29:20.250 --> 02:29:24.712
We shouldn't have never given it to anybody that was healthy and wanted to live a long healthy life afterwards.

02:29:24.772 --> 02:29:31.494
Never mind two or three doses, boosters or other combinations of RNA targeting other things like pneumonia or flu.

02:29:34.508 --> 02:29:54.502
And instead of talking about those big picture issues that will make people understand the malevolence of the crime, we're talking about stupid, complicated details for several minutes in a row where the vast majority of people are just being bamboozled into believing that these guys got it under control.

02:29:54.522 --> 02:29:58.425
I'm gonna leave it to Steve and these other heroes.

02:30:00.045 --> 02:30:01.886
have an influence on the reproductive tract.

02:30:02.346 --> 02:30:11.928
And so what's interesting as a way to agree with this argument about, you know, maybe it's a good thing because it can serve as an adjuvant if it was like a traditional shot and it stayed in the muscle or state.

02:30:12.208 --> 02:30:19.890
If it was like a traditional shot and it stayed in the muscle, I don't know where he got his data, but that doesn't happen.

02:30:22.958 --> 02:30:29.343
Even if you just believe Marc Giraudeau, it doesn't happen one out of every nine times.

02:30:30.364 --> 02:30:32.185
But it doesn't ever happen.

02:30:33.246 --> 02:30:35.908
What you inject in the muscle doesn't stay there.

02:30:37.049 --> 02:30:38.070
That's ridiculous.

02:30:39.151 --> 02:30:40.232
Why did he say that?

02:30:43.593 --> 02:31:07.401
inflammation because stomach inflammation means it could potentially have an influence on the reproductive tract and so what's interesting is I would agree with this argument about you know maybe it's a good thing because it can serve as an adjuvant if it was like a traditional shot and it stayed in the muscle or stayed isolated there and to the regional and local lymph nodes because you want that inflammation that's the danger signal.

02:31:09.302 --> 02:31:11.483
Did you see Kevin's face when he said that?

02:31:13.629 --> 02:31:16.871
This was a landmark in the conversation.

02:31:18.212 --> 02:31:21.674
This was a pre-planned landmark in the conversation.

02:31:21.734 --> 02:31:23.515
I can almost see it from Kevin's face.

02:31:23.615 --> 02:31:23.975
Watch.

02:31:24.696 --> 02:31:26.277
This is starting to annoy me now.

02:31:27.872 --> 02:31:31.794
This is starting to annoy me now because there's no reason for him to say this.

02:31:32.394 --> 02:31:39.397
There is no reason for him to think that the lipid nanoparticles make it go, make stuff go farther.

02:31:39.857 --> 02:31:45.320
And that if you inject a toxin or a heavy metal in your muscle, it's not going to stay in your muscle.

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.761
That's how, how the hell does the aluminum get into the brain then?

02:31:49.181 --> 02:31:50.982
And the mercury got into the brain then?

02:31:51.042 --> 02:31:52.883
What are we talking about here, Byram?

02:31:54.281 --> 02:31:57.082
Now I'm not so sure anymore about this man.

02:31:57.642 --> 02:32:03.424
This is a very big red flag to say these words in combination with one another.

02:32:03.584 --> 02:32:04.804
It's on the reproductive tract.

02:32:05.285 --> 02:32:18.389
And so what's interesting as a way to agree with this argument about, you know, maybe it's a good thing because it can serve as an adjuvant if it was like a traditional shot and it stayed in the muscle or stayed isolated there and to the regional and local lymph nodes because

02:32:19.029 --> 02:32:29.800
You want that inflammation, that's the danger signal, to draw the attention of the immune system, so you bring in those phagocytic cells to pick up the RNA, make the spike protein, and go and show that spike protein to all the cells in your lymph nodes.

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:30.201
That's good.

02:32:30.774 --> 02:32:40.963
But the problem is when you get this plasma DNA that can be highly immunostimulatory distributed again through the body with a wide distribution we know is typical of lipid nanoparticles.

02:32:41.324 --> 02:32:43.245
Now you're talking systemic inflammation.

02:32:43.626 --> 02:32:46.468
And to me, they may have convinced him that these are special.

02:32:46.508 --> 02:32:47.349
These are different.

02:32:47.549 --> 02:32:49.671
Like they tried to convince me and other people.

02:32:51.232 --> 02:32:57.118
And that the old vaccine schedule, it's flawed, but it's not like this is a very, very

02:32:59.181 --> 02:33:12.171
enticing trap, because then a lot of parents like myself can forgive themselves for having put their kids on a schedule that's criminal, that likely damaged them, that limited their ability to grow and develop.

02:33:14.592 --> 02:33:22.218
It's a harsh reality that everyone's going to have to come to face, that the criminal vaccine schedule in America likely hurt all of our children.

02:33:23.729 --> 02:33:31.472
that all of our children were perfect, just the way they were, and every one of us is guilty of not having protected them.

02:33:31.572 --> 02:33:46.458
Our parents didn't protect us, but the vaccine schedule wasn't as criminal when I was a child being 52 now, than it is now for the children that are born today, like my daughter was six years ago.

02:33:50.435 --> 02:34:06.505
There's a lot of reckoning to happen here, and they are giving all kinds of easy outs to all of these academics and parents and doctors who don't want to, and they do not want to take the leap to say that, holy shit, have they been lying to us since before the pandemic?

02:34:06.846 --> 02:34:16.532
Has the PBS NewsHour been promoting people that they knew were gonna turn on us and help us with this controlled demolition all along, even before the pandemic they were bad?

02:34:18.877 --> 02:34:22.139
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:24.520
Can't make the argument.

02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:29.763
When you're promoting systemic inflammation, you can't promote, in my mind as an immunologist, that that is a good adjuvant.

02:34:29.803 --> 02:34:37.988
To me, an adjuvant that promotes systemic inflammation is a very bad adjuvant, particularly in cases of pregnancy, for example, is a classic one.

02:34:38.989 --> 02:34:39.269
Right, right.

02:34:39.289 --> 02:34:40.750
Don't eat cheese, but take one of these shots.

02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:42.231
That's the logic we were given.

02:34:44.080 --> 02:35:04.255
I mean it's it's it's Incredibly, I don't know what's the but we're not gonna laugh about the fact that they do that with the flu shot, too We're not laughing about that that they're doing that with the RSV shot too it's not really diabolical guys You don't need to point that out Not really worth it.

02:35:04.315 --> 02:35:05.116
It's just kind of funny.

02:35:05.136 --> 02:35:05.156
I

02:35:07.029 --> 02:35:13.952
irresponsible for the CDC to tell women to take a shot which causes systemic inflammation?

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:25.196
What else is crazy about this is they're all well aware that the next generation sequencing field just went through this whole transition off of amniocentesis to using non-invasive prenatal testing.

02:35:25.296 --> 02:35:29.578
So like three percent of the DNA circulating in maternal bloodstream is actually the fetal genome.

02:35:30.058 --> 02:35:32.819
So you sequence a mother's blood and you can get the entire genome of the kid.

02:35:33.819 --> 02:35:37.161
That means there's exchange of small DNA between the mother and the child.

02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:39.762
So this is vaccine DNA is going systemic.

02:35:40.363 --> 02:35:47.027
I would bet it's going into the child, either through the lipid nanoparticle, or if it's even naked in the blood, there's probably some exchange there.

02:35:48.267 --> 02:35:52.890
And they no longer do amnios now because they can sequence kids through the mother's bloodstream.

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:55.971
You don't have to stick a needle and have a 1 in 500 death rate with an amnio.

02:35:56.532 --> 02:35:59.714
So there's known communication between mother and child here.

02:35:59.854 --> 02:36:01.915
And I would bet on these LNPs getting there.

02:36:02.755 --> 02:36:04.317
And you know what, Kevin, I'm so glad you brought that up.

02:36:04.397 --> 02:36:05.558
I had never thought about that as well.

02:36:05.578 --> 02:36:05.999
But you know what?

02:36:06.619 --> 02:36:13.246
I actually have taught my students for years about the fact that technically mothers are what we call chimeras for that very reason, right?

02:36:13.266 --> 02:36:15.889
A chimera is a combination of two different individuals.

02:36:15.909 --> 02:36:18.551
We usually think of it like two different species, but same thing with people.

02:36:18.571 --> 02:36:18.992
So a mother

02:36:19.492 --> 02:36:22.074
does have a tiny genetic component of their baby.

02:36:22.754 --> 02:36:24.516
They never mentioned micro RNAs.

02:36:24.556 --> 02:36:35.864
They never, ever, ever mentioned micro RNAs, even though they know the RNA is highly impure and that it causes premature stop codons, which would result in RNAs, which are short sequences, micro RNAs.

02:36:35.904 --> 02:36:36.804
I mean, it's incredible.

02:36:37.305 --> 02:36:38.125
That stays with them.

02:36:38.465 --> 02:36:40.427
I never thought about it, though, from the reverse direction.

02:36:40.447 --> 02:36:40.767
You're right.

02:36:40.827 --> 02:36:46.831
So this is why it's important to get scientists together discussing these things, because I totally agree with that concern.

02:36:46.911 --> 02:36:47.812
That's a major concern.

02:36:48.271 --> 02:36:55.519
So if we had a CDC scientist on this call who would defend that, yes, it was the right thing to do.

02:36:55.879 --> 02:36:57.421
Here's a stupid hypothetical.

02:36:57.841 --> 02:37:00.444
Steve is so good at stupid hypotheticals.

02:37:00.624 --> 02:37:01.445
It's unbelievable.

02:37:01.505 --> 02:37:02.666
It's like his specialty.

02:37:02.766 --> 02:37:03.827
If there's anything

02:37:04.508 --> 02:37:09.150
that Steve Kirsch is good at, it's coming up with stupid hypotheticals.

02:37:09.250 --> 02:37:09.710
Here we go.

02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:10.190
With them.

02:37:10.511 --> 02:37:12.471
I never thought about it though from the reverse direction.

02:37:12.511 --> 02:37:12.832
You're right.

02:37:12.892 --> 02:37:18.894
So this is why it's important to get scientists together discussing these things, because I totally agree with that concern.

02:37:18.954 --> 02:37:19.935
That's a major concern.

02:37:20.355 --> 02:37:29.959
So if we had a CDC scientist on this call who would defend that, yes, it was the right thing to do to give this vaccine to pregnant women,

02:37:31.505 --> 02:37:34.554
What argument could they possibly use in light of what you just said?

02:37:35.458 --> 02:37:37.159
to defend, to defend argument.

02:37:37.199 --> 02:37:39.461
Because you know, we're never going to have this discussion, right?

02:37:39.481 --> 02:37:45.505
Because the CDC scientist is never going to be, allow themselves to be questioned because that's not what they do.

02:37:45.565 --> 02:37:46.225
They censor us.

02:37:46.285 --> 02:37:48.187
They do not answer any of our questions.

02:37:48.627 --> 02:37:52.149
If they were here, how would they, how could they respond to what you just said?

02:37:52.589 --> 02:37:53.290
Yeah, just really quickly.

02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:59.714
Cause I can't, I put thoughts into the minds of these theoretical hypothetical people who would potentially speak to us.

02:37:59.774 --> 02:38:01.075
But what I do know is.

02:38:01.415 --> 02:38:04.537
I can't put any thoughts into your hypothetical FDA

02:38:09.559 --> 02:38:11.279
It's such an intelligent conversation.

02:38:11.439 --> 02:38:14.620
You know, their job is to take a balance, right?

02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:17.921
And you start piling up the benefits on one side and the risks on the other.

02:38:18.061 --> 02:38:23.422
And their job is supposed to be, if the risks outweigh the benefits, you don't move forward and vice versa.

02:38:23.702 --> 02:38:29.043
So to me then, what they do is the risks just keep piling up massively over time.

02:38:29.523 --> 02:38:35.309
So to me, if I'm to hypothesize what they would do, they're going to try and pile as much as they can on the benefit side.

02:38:35.649 --> 02:38:43.297
But the problem is that they're going to argue this was super dangerous, but that's sort of gone out with work that's shown the infection fatality rate is much lower than was anticipated, etc.

02:38:43.317 --> 02:38:43.838
But you know what I mean?

02:38:43.858 --> 02:38:45.019
That's what they're going to try and do, Steve.

02:38:45.059 --> 02:38:45.640
They have to.

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:51.726
If they're going to counter this, they're going to have to get that pile on the benefit side as high as they can to outweigh the ever mounting risks.

02:38:51.926 --> 02:39:05.390
Yeah, and by the way, I just published on my sub stack a study of a VA paper, it was published in JAMA, and it basically showed that there was no hospitalization difference if you were hospitalized for COVID versus if you're hospitalized for influenza.

02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:12.532
The vaccination breakdown for both vaccines was identical in the two groups, which means neither vaccines work to prevent hospitalization.

02:39:13.032 --> 02:39:17.513
And as Byram, as you and I discussed, if there's no hospitalization benefit

02:39:17.893 --> 02:39:22.034
There is nothing in biology that shows that you can have a mortality benefit.

02:39:22.374 --> 02:39:26.795
So if your hospitalization benefit is zero, your mortality benefit is zero as well.

02:39:27.116 --> 02:39:32.237
So then doesn't that mean they murdered people in hospitals and then lied about it and called it COVID, doesn't that?

02:39:33.057 --> 02:39:34.238
What is he saying here?

02:39:35.098 --> 02:39:36.198
This is pretty bizarre.

02:39:37.799 --> 02:39:39.519
It has to be less than the hospitalization benefit.

02:39:39.839 --> 02:39:42.900
There are no exceptions in biology that you were aware of.

02:39:44.172 --> 02:39:48.696
I mean, there's a deeper issue here as well, is the CDC conflicted, right?

02:39:48.716 --> 02:39:51.798
Do they have a motivation to actually push vaccines?

02:39:52.058 --> 02:39:54.740
I mean, certainly there's a lot of other things that run through there.

02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:03.407
And don't they have a separate slush fund that Pharma can fund that is involved in funding, like, shots heard around the world, and that I think Bill and Melinda Gates can pump money into?

02:40:03.467 --> 02:40:07.450
It's not really under their budget, but they're under control of it or under influence of it.

02:40:08.391 --> 02:40:10.633
So they do have side funds coming in.

02:40:11.013 --> 02:40:14.255
So I don't know that we're going to get honest answers from conflicted organizations.

02:40:14.515 --> 02:40:15.596
No, we won't.

02:40:15.876 --> 02:40:18.077
They have $400 million in royalty from Moderna.

02:40:18.117 --> 02:40:19.999
They're not going to give us an honest answer.

02:40:20.279 --> 02:40:23.981
If we go to the FDA, they've got issues in that the PDUFA Act funds half of their budget.

02:40:24.001 --> 02:40:26.383
They're getting directly funded by the companies they regulate.

02:40:26.423 --> 02:40:29.785
So none of those are going to come to the table and give us an honest answer.

02:40:29.805 --> 02:40:32.266
They're going to come and say safe and effective and the virus is really dangerous.

02:40:32.467 --> 02:40:33.267
Yeah.

02:40:33.327 --> 02:40:35.989
And just to confirm for your Canadian listeners, Steve,

02:40:36.986 --> 02:40:37.646
It's very interesting.

02:40:37.686 --> 02:40:41.107
Health Canada, historically, was primarily funded by taxpayers.

02:40:41.147 --> 02:40:45.389
And so then the flip side is, is that the virus isn't very dangerous, but the shots are.

02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:47.530
And that's the dichotomy that they're fighting about.

02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:49.810
Shots are safe and effective.

02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:51.051
Virus is very dangerous.

02:40:51.071 --> 02:40:52.771
So the virus wasn't very dangerous.

02:40:52.811 --> 02:40:54.052
It was the same as the flu.

02:40:54.432 --> 02:40:55.872
And the shots are very dangerous.

02:40:55.912 --> 02:41:00.534
And as long as you have this argument with them and talk about all these super specific

02:41:01.074 --> 02:41:06.737
stupid, complicated details about the process and whether or not they lied about it, or did they obfuscate it or not?

02:41:07.137 --> 02:41:07.837
Did they really?

02:41:08.197 --> 02:41:10.718
Shouldn't they have annotated that better?

02:41:10.778 --> 02:41:11.839
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:41:12.199 --> 02:41:24.504
You're not arguing about anything other than what they want you to argue about, which reinforces the presuppositions of the state narrative, which is exactly what this gentleman said a long time ago.

02:41:24.925 --> 02:41:30.047
They allow a fairly lively debate within that spectrum, and you see Kevin McKernan

02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:55.193
and Steve Kirsch and Chris Martinson trapping and encouraging that behavior inside of Byron Bridle, making him feel like he's engaged in this critical and dissident discussion while still not putting in danger his position at a university, while not really questioning the heart of the narrative, which is the criminal vaccine schedule in America.

02:41:56.414 --> 02:42:02.638
And that's what gives these people like Byron Bridle a sense that free thinking is going on.

02:42:02.698 --> 02:42:05.740
It's so great when these scientists get back together.

02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:13.705
Ladies and gentlemen, the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses has been going on for decades.

02:42:13.765 --> 02:42:21.550
And it has become so complicated because we have allowed them to put social media and the people that are artificially promoted on it

02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:23.261
in front of us.

02:42:23.381 --> 02:42:30.386
And we listened to their limited spectrum of debate, their dumb questions, since the beginning of this narrative.

02:42:32.188 --> 02:42:38.853
Already in April 24, 2020, Kevin McKernan was telling us that the virus isn't dangerous.

02:42:38.933 --> 02:42:39.634
It's the shot.

02:42:40.254 --> 02:42:41.495
Actually, it's the response.

02:42:41.576 --> 02:42:43.337
It's the FDA getting in the way.

02:42:43.357 --> 02:42:43.637
It's the

02:42:48.502 --> 02:42:52.024
It's not by accident, ladies and gentlemen, that these people are in front of us.

02:42:52.304 --> 02:43:11.412
It is by careful programming, selection, auditioning, and promotion of them, fake censorship of them, which has resulted in certain groups of people being in front of the United States Senate that are infiltrated enough so that the message and the content of each of the individual speakers is effectively controlled.

02:43:11.872 --> 02:43:31.816
