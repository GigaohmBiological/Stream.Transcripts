00:47.219 --> 00:49.541
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa.

00:49.802 --> 00:51.403
Oh, time out JC on the bike.

00:52.464 --> 00:53.345
JC on the bike.

00:54.186 --> 00:55.347
It's JC on the bike.

00:56.148 --> 00:57.409
It's JC on the bike.

00:57.509 --> 00:58.370
Yeah.

00:59.011 --> 01:03.135
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning.

01:03.555 --> 01:05.197
And I know just the one.

01:06.078 --> 01:06.899
Look it round.

01:07.279 --> 01:08.400
It's JC on the bike.

01:09.001 --> 01:11.103
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

01:19.116 --> 01:19.356
really.

01:19.696 --> 01:20.196
Do it for me.

01:20.216 --> 01:21.697
Do it to save the white race.

01:21.717 --> 01:24.338
Hey what's up guys, it's Soph here, just getting ready for the pride parade.

01:24.858 --> 01:26.179
Oh hey, didn't see you there.

01:26.199 --> 01:31.021
I'm just here getting ready to go to the pride parade considering I'm going to a GSA meet pretty soon.

01:31.221 --> 01:35.423
So when you're kind of, you know, playing around with a gun as you do, you should always be playing around with it.

01:35.883 --> 01:42.506
You want to keep your finger directly on the trigger so you're always ready in case any sort of homosexual person strolls by.

01:42.526 --> 01:44.867
I need to see you holding the gun like this, okay?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.228
I want you to take yourself out.

01:47.248 --> 01:48.188
The way you got to do it,

01:49.229 --> 01:53.554
You gotta take your gun like so, thusly, and, uh, you know, shoot yourself in the back of the head.

01:54.996 --> 01:59.442
So guys, one of the classic ways to make your whole thing more comical is, uh, going akimbo.

01:59.462 --> 02:02.505
Uh, very impractical, very un-tactical.

02:02.525 --> 02:05.089
You wanna make sure you're really close together before you start hitting each other.

02:08.860 --> 02:14.665
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:15.105 --> 02:18.148
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:18.228 --> 02:27.676
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:27.696 --> 02:34.302
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:37.904 --> 02:40.966
So SARS-1 and its descendants have gone endemic.

02:41.006 --> 02:41.987
That's what I was just saying.

02:42.027 --> 02:45.369
The current PCR test is not specific for SARS-CoV-2.

02:46.249 --> 02:53.273
And that is known because it's the German company that originally produced it knows that they've chosen a short sequence that they think is relevant.

02:53.734 --> 02:58.496
It is a short sequence that just comes from one of the open reading frame one proteins.

02:59.137 --> 03:07.622
We are being duped by a nonspecific test and we would have gotten these numbers or numbers very similar to them with or without this pandemic.

03:08.370 --> 03:13.332
Because we've never looked for SARS viruses as they are spread through our population.

03:13.352 --> 03:14.332
We've just never looked.

03:15.173 --> 03:17.113
Nobody sampled for it until this year.

03:18.234 --> 03:19.914
That's a huge point to make.

03:20.795 --> 03:25.116
Because the SARS virus originally appeared in 2003 and disappeared in 2004.

03:26.237 --> 03:29.058
But it didn't really disappear, it just became not a problem.

03:30.427 --> 03:38.750
descendants of that virus of various virulence and infectivity have circulated in the time since.

03:38.870 --> 03:39.910
They didn't disappear.

03:41.951 --> 03:44.772
And this test is not specific for any one of them.

03:45.592 --> 03:54.255
And no one has ever done a study about how many descendants there are, how many people are infected, how many animals have been infected by it, etc.

03:57.416 --> 03:57.576
So

03:58.203 --> 04:19.643
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

04:21.205 --> 04:22.186
But I know for sure

04:22.574 --> 04:40.013
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

04:56.421 --> 05:00.725
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone.

05:03.027 --> 05:06.209
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you.

05:09.152 --> 05:13.315
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song.

05:15.397 --> 05:18.679
I just can't remember who to send it to.

05:21.882 --> 05:24.324
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

05:26.698 --> 05:30.679
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

05:32.820 --> 05:37.002
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

05:39.403 --> 05:42.964
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

05:48.846 --> 05:51.087
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?

05:51.867 --> 05:54.188
You gotta help me make a stand.

05:56.380 --> 05:59.822
Just got to see me through another day.

06:02.383 --> 06:07.005
My body's aching and my time is at hand.

06:09.266 --> 06:12.728
I won't make it any other way.

06:15.269 --> 06:18.450
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

06:20.651 --> 06:24.233
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

06:26.826 --> 06:30.967
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.869
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

06:38.069 --> 06:46.011
Been walking my mind to an easy time.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.371
My back turned towards the sun.

06:48.391 --> 06:54.433
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around.

06:55.507 --> 07:01.089
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come.

07:02.769 --> 07:07.431
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.

07:09.251 --> 07:12.452
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

07:12.472 --> 07:18.234
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

07:20.655 --> 07:23.816
I've seen lonely times when I could not find

07:26.843 --> 07:32.927
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again.

07:32.947 --> 07:39.952
Thought I'd see you one more time again.

07:40.052 --> 07:46.677
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now.

07:46.697 --> 07:49.379
Thought I'd see you.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.793
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

08:25.874 --> 08:30.621
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

08:32.043 --> 08:33.826
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

08:35.368 --> 08:36.109
It's embarrassing.

08:56.284 --> 08:58.807
And now your starting lineup.

08:58.847 --> 08:59.668
No, I won't do that.

08:59.728 --> 09:00.208
Sorry.

09:00.248 --> 09:05.233
This is Giga Home Biological Throwback Thursday with Jessica Rose, virologist.

09:06.294 --> 09:08.676
Very excited for this show.

09:08.776 --> 09:09.837
It is throwback Thursday.

09:09.877 --> 09:19.066
We're going to try and go back in time on Thursdays to see if we can put some meat on the bones of this illusion that they created.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.821
and that is going to require some work.

09:21.881 --> 09:29.925
It's going to require some archiving to realize what is perceived to be true is not true and how they did it.

09:31.065 --> 09:34.027
In order to break this enchantment we're actually going to have to

09:35.322 --> 09:37.203
You're going to have to pay attention to 2020 and 2021.

09:37.503 --> 09:47.770
And as much as I want to move on and teach everybody the virology, I am a neurobiologist, a biologist by training for many, many years.

09:48.290 --> 09:57.355
The name Gigaohm Biological comes from gigaohm seals, which are the electrical seal that I used to make when I was a biologist depicted in this

09:58.496 --> 09:59.577
little diagram here.

10:00.777 --> 10:12.424
Ladies and gentlemen, weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about the origins of a novel virus or multiple shooters and participating in the argument accepts the premise of a novel virus or multiple shooters by default.

10:12.964 --> 10:18.107
And we are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to social media of all kinds.

10:18.287 --> 10:23.510
And this includes all sides of every mythology that we're currently participating in.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.651
If you want to break out, this is the biology that will help you break out.

10:28.411 --> 10:36.093
And I hope that I can help you discover and understand this virology over the rest of the summer.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.074
Welcome to the show.

10:39.094 --> 10:46.857
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:50.373 --> 10:55.437
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is pretty dumb.

10:56.018 --> 11:02.803
And transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses aren't pattern integrities.

11:02.843 --> 11:04.685
They just can't do those kinds of things.

11:05.465 --> 11:11.530
And oftentimes the misconstruing of whatever virology claims to be virology as life

11:13.572 --> 11:16.233
is really the main bamboozlement.

11:16.273 --> 11:21.056
They are trying to convince you that RNA molecules are capable of doing things that they cannot do.

11:21.537 --> 11:27.721
And it doesn't matter if you start with the top phrase or you start with the middle phrase or you start with the bottom phrase.

11:27.761 --> 11:39.769
These are all places where you can succinctly open the door to a discussion that otherwise wouldn't be opened because these phrases force people to ask correct questions rather than ask these

11:40.592 --> 11:42.513
peripherally unrelated questions.

11:44.254 --> 11:44.914
Thank you.

11:46.134 --> 11:47.295
Thank you, thank you everybody.

11:47.315 --> 12:01.861
Thank you, thank you, thank you everyone.

12:04.862 --> 12:05.883
I love you too.

12:09.298 --> 12:11.059
Thank you, thank you.

12:11.160 --> 12:29.995
So I just want to be clear, first of all, the multiple shooters thing, what it does, first and foremost, and try to get your head around this, it completely absolves everyone who meddled with that kid, everyone that was involved in getting that kid to show up on that roof.

12:30.955 --> 12:37.221
Don't forget that according to a lot of eyewitnesses, that kid threw his rifle to the side, away from him.

12:38.166 --> 12:43.228
And it presumably looked like he was hoping he wouldn't get shot, that they would take him alive.

12:45.588 --> 12:53.211
Now, if you just take that one little piece of the story that nobody wants to talk about the boy, the boy is from four blocks away from my house.

12:53.311 --> 13:07.855
The boy was obviously somehow or another via social media convinced to go there, even though they say that he had no social media signature at all, which would be exceedingly odd for a 20 year old man in Bethel Park,

13:08.427 --> 13:09.108
Pennsylvania.

13:11.489 --> 13:23.679
These same people that want us to talk about the audio files which indicate multiple shooters don't want to talk about the only shooter for sure that we know was on the scene, seen by multiple people, and even had a gun that he fired.

13:25.293 --> 13:27.115
Nobody cares about how he got there.

13:27.175 --> 13:33.260
Nobody cares if Soph and Sasha and her handlers were responsible for it.

13:33.780 --> 13:37.824
Nobody cares if somebody like Soph was responsible for it.

13:37.884 --> 13:48.393
Nobody cares if someone like Sasha and Soph were responsible for that little boy being on that young man, that young adult, that perpetual adolescent,

13:49.403 --> 13:50.984
was on that roof.

13:51.485 --> 13:59.392
It's no question that that kid was some kind of patsy, but that doesn't mean that the discussion about him should then be moot.

14:01.414 --> 14:04.957
Unless of course the discussion about him would be the only way out of the cave.

14:07.093 --> 14:20.344
I mean, these multiple shooters that are on the audio tape, how do you know that they aren't people shooting blanks with the intent purpose of giving John Cullen and Chris Martinson something to argue about?

14:20.424 --> 14:29.151
Just like when Lee Min Yan came out in February to give something to Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson to argue about.

14:31.246 --> 14:44.234
The assumption that the audio files indicate multiple shooters is predicated on the fact that all those gunshots are real, all those gunshots had bullets behind them, and all those gunshots are definitely real.

14:47.256 --> 14:59.183
Even though we know they used fake video at the beginning of the pandemic to get us to believe that people were falling down on their faces in China, that they were building a huge, huge hospital, that there was a cruise ship in New York needed.

15:00.950 --> 15:17.466
that there were airplanes on 9-11, but somehow or another, the audiophiles are convincing enough that we have to spend weeks and hours promoting the same clown show, Bret Weinstein, John Cullen, Chris Martinson.

15:17.546 --> 15:19.028
These are all the same show.

15:20.387 --> 15:32.697
Chris Martinson, the retired, you know, homesteading pharmaceutical executive who was on PBS NewsHour in 2008, right before the crash to tell us that it was gonna crash.

15:33.657 --> 15:36.460
Then was ahead on the lab leak in February.

15:39.162 --> 15:46.728
An advisor to Brett Weinstein went to the Panama Canal with Brett Weinstein and Big Honey.

15:48.888 --> 15:52.214
to see the invasion of America from the South a couple months ago.

15:53.296 --> 15:57.123
Big Honey also supposedly met up with Kevin McCarron in Japan.

15:59.864 --> 16:27.028
And now we're supposed to believe that these same people who went down to Panama to see the invasion, these same people who were sure about the lab leak, these same people who were sure about ivermectin, these same people who are sure about the DNA double-stranded contamination of the shots, and sure about Li Min Yan despite not knowing anything about her and never looking where she came from, these same people want us to fight about audiophiles and how many different shooters there are and ignore the fact that there's definitely one shooter.

16:27.648 --> 16:34.770
who was an American, probably an innocent kid that was, over time, worked into that plan.

16:37.031 --> 16:41.552
And the most parsimonious, least number of moving parts is that that little kid missed.

16:43.093 --> 16:55.997
And yet the same people that got us to argue about the lab leak and argue about double-stranded DNA and argue about the lab leak coverup are getting us to argue about the audiophiles now.

16:56.940 --> 16:58.200
The audiophiles could be real.

16:58.801 --> 16:59.321
Sure they are.

17:01.101 --> 17:03.902
But it's a giant, giant assumption.

17:04.762 --> 17:13.065
And if you think about whose hands that plays into, if in the end, the only thing that was necessary for that whole plot to happen was that kid to show up.

17:13.565 --> 17:17.326
If that kid decides to stay at home, then what are those other shooters gonna do?

17:18.767 --> 17:22.968
Don't you understand how pivotal it is for crooks to have shown up?

17:24.102 --> 17:27.806
And we already know that he had a drone and that he flew it over there and stuff.

17:28.286 --> 17:34.232
This is all absolutely crazy that they have done this to us again.

17:34.492 --> 17:37.115
We might as well go out all and stock up on toilet paper.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.961
Look at this video and tell me that in 2020, this makes any sense.

17:44.943 --> 17:54.313
We're happy tonight we can get gathering here and celebrate the first year of anniversary of our new federal state of China.

17:59.592 --> 18:03.116
It is not just an event for anniversary.

18:03.757 --> 18:16.753
Actually for our Chinese people, we know how tough, how difficult we have to overcome numerous difficulties we face to the life's race and finally

18:17.273 --> 18:38.605
We can push the whistleblower movement, and we can make China government, Chinese Communist Party, and even China military scared of us, because we reveal the truth to the world, which they want to block, which they want to suppress, and which they want to cover up, and even take over the world.

18:43.123 --> 18:51.566
Okay, I still see that there's a big debate going on in the chat about the reality and whether or not those shots are real or whether they were supersonic or not.

18:52.067 --> 18:55.268
Again, you don't need to be an expert on shooting.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.409
You need to be an expert on audio recording.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.150
You need to be an expert on fake audio recordings.

19:01.170 --> 19:07.593
You need to be an expert on how to find out when audio recordings are cut and things are shifted.

19:09.659 --> 19:13.550
Because again, the default assumption is that all these audio files are real.

19:14.813 --> 19:20.495
All these audio files are legitimate pieces of evidence, manufactured or not, you don't know.

19:21.135 --> 19:32.378
But the assumption that all of these people are working on is that these are real audio files that represent real data from the real day, and that we can use them to discern how many shooters there are.

19:32.759 --> 19:39.301
And all you're doing is asking questions that have nothing to do with Crooks, nothing to do with who got Crooks to show up on the scene.

19:39.721 --> 19:43.582
And if Crooks didn't show up on the scene, what would these other shooters have done?

19:47.133 --> 19:57.059
just like if they hadn't murdered people in New York City with supplementary oxygen, what would the national security narrative had done?

19:57.660 --> 20:02.223
If they wouldn't have murdered people in New York City or lied about it, what would we have done?

20:03.043 --> 20:04.004
What would have happened?

20:05.236 --> 20:08.478
These are the questions that nobody's asking and why we have to go back to 2020.

20:09.518 --> 20:18.323
Because this shouldn't be August, 2020, Scarlet Yan talking about the new Republic of China and it's one year anniversary.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.945
That doesn't sound like a whistleblowing virologist to me.

20:22.485 --> 20:26.047
You can find this video archived on my site.

20:29.789 --> 20:31.771
For me, all for Chinese Communist Party.

20:32.011 --> 20:32.351
Thank you.

20:39.588 --> 20:49.512
Dr. Lee Min Yang is not only a hero to the Chinese people, not only a hero to the American people, she's a hero to all mankind.

21:03.138 --> 21:03.838
That's quite a hug.

21:07.441 --> 21:10.565
I never even get to hug my 14-year-old boy like that anymore.

21:10.585 --> 21:12.708
He won't even let me get close to him like that.

21:13.629 --> 21:17.874
I very rarely hug my wife like that, except for when she gets on an airplane, unfortunately.

21:17.934 --> 21:18.595
What is this?

21:20.137 --> 21:21.219
What are we seeing here?

21:32.847 --> 21:34.669
So I don't want to spend too much time on this.

21:34.729 --> 21:35.870
I want to get right to the work.

21:36.431 --> 21:43.119
We need to have a new consensus about the idea that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and all these people knew it.

21:44.008 --> 21:50.649
They knew that they had to have murder and lies in order to get away with it, in order to coerce people into accepting it, especially college age kids.

21:51.670 --> 21:55.230
RNA cannot pandemic and all these molecular biologists know that.

21:55.691 --> 22:02.812
And vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise and all of these people know it, they just won't say it because that's their whole job.

22:03.292 --> 22:10.554
Their whole job is to make sure that the average American, the average skilled TV watcher, the average skilled PBS news watcher,

22:11.562 --> 22:12.963
never comes to that conclusion.

22:13.003 --> 22:21.750
That's their job and that's why I think it's important to study these people who are on this team where they don't want to talk about 2020 and they keep saying the COVID shots are bad.

22:22.450 --> 22:25.052
They can't find the word transfection or transformation.

22:25.092 --> 22:27.193
They can't find the word fraud.

22:27.854 --> 22:29.175
They can't find the word murder.

22:31.124 --> 22:34.827
And all of them agree that we need to fear free-range RNA molecules.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.409
And I'm particularly interested in Dr. Jessica Rose.

22:38.449 --> 22:40.511
You can find her in lots of different places.

22:41.111 --> 22:45.735
You can find lots of different CVs or partial CVs of hers.

22:47.056 --> 22:49.518
If you, for example, oh, I didn't do this correctly.

22:49.578 --> 22:49.798
Sorry.

22:49.838 --> 22:51.679
Let me go back quick and get this out.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.702
I want to make these animated when they come in.

22:54.922 --> 22:55.182
Sorry.

23:05.465 --> 23:08.707
So let me just save it quick and then I'll start it again.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.790
The reason why I want to cover Jessica Rose is because I haven't really before.

23:12.830 --> 23:19.514
I haven't really gone back in time to see where she first came out, when she first came out, and so I thought I would do that today.

23:20.715 --> 23:23.097
If we build back this up from here,

23:24.137 --> 23:45.826
We're gonna look at the orchid page from her because she has filled out an orchid page there you can actually see that she used to work in Israel and then in Newfoundland Canada and then Newfoundland Canada and then Israel and Israel so Israel Israel Canada Canada Israel and the last place She says she's at is Israel.

23:45.846 --> 23:46.906
Although that's a postdoc.

23:46.926 --> 23:52.168
So I don't know if that's new now Look at her publication list on on

23:53.954 --> 23:57.819
Orchid, which is something I think you kind of have to maintain, but I'm not sure.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.464
We can just look at some of the authors that she's recently written with.

24:03.205 --> 24:10.013
In 2024, we have one here with Stephanie Seneff and Jessica Rose and Steve Kirsch.

24:10.919 --> 24:12.699
Peter McCullough is possibly.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.460
Dave Wiseman, I think is a good guy.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.701
Josh Getzko.

24:19.761 --> 24:21.341
Jessica Rose, here we go.

24:21.381 --> 24:22.942
David Wiseman, Josh Getzko.

24:22.982 --> 24:25.942
These are all Panda operators here.

24:25.982 --> 24:36.605
So I'm not really totally down with Josh just because he was on my stream once and he knows that I presented three times at Panda, but he's actually never, ever,

24:37.345 --> 24:39.146
ever shared my work even once.

24:39.186 --> 24:47.989
And when he came on my show, he was talking about VAERS and stuff like that, kind of similar to what Jessica, I just don't trust Josh.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.569
I'm very sorry if you like Josh, but I don't trust Josh.

24:51.550 --> 24:57.231
And then we look down here again, David Wiseman, Kevin McKernan, and David Spector.

24:57.272 --> 25:04.734
That's the guy from Canada who did their PCR tests and who actually can testify that they didn't have nested primers up there.

25:06.385 --> 25:10.907
Let's see, Tess Laurie, I don't think she's bad, I just think she's fooled.

25:11.807 --> 25:14.088
Here's another paper, Claire Craig.

25:15.188 --> 25:21.911
Martin Neal, you know, that's one of the guys that I was supposed to write a virology review with, thanks to Jessica Hockett.

25:22.791 --> 25:26.212
Norman Fenton, he might be a good guy, but he's fooled by these other people.

25:27.153 --> 25:33.035
Josh McClellan, Joe Smalley, Josh Getzko again, Jonathan Engler.

25:33.775 --> 25:40.097
That's the other guy from Panda that I was supposed to write a virology review with, and they just wrote the shittiest virology review ever.

25:40.557 --> 25:41.657
And then Jessica Rose.

25:42.478 --> 25:43.218
Martin Neal.

25:43.938 --> 25:44.678
Norman Fenton.

25:45.238 --> 25:45.939
Claire Craig.

25:46.819 --> 25:47.699
Josh Getzko.

25:48.239 --> 25:49.140
Jonathan Engler.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.300
See what I'm talking about here?

25:51.340 --> 25:58.362
These are all unpublished articles, but they're articles that were shared and talked about and promoted by these other authors.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.123
Claire Craig.

26:00.803 --> 26:01.904
Jonathan Engler.

26:02.364 --> 26:03.064
Martin Neal.

26:04.005 --> 26:04.845
Let's keep going.

26:05.126 --> 26:08.767
David Wiseman, Josh Getzko, Jessica Rose.

26:08.847 --> 26:09.547
Keep going.

26:09.728 --> 26:15.190
Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose, Josh Getzko, Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose.

26:17.731 --> 26:20.492
Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose, Jessica Rose.

26:20.552 --> 26:28.576
Now, if we go back a little bit to her own CV and we look at what she did her PhD and master's thesis on, it's actually very interesting.

26:29.687 --> 26:35.982
Her master's thesis is a dynamical systems analysis of HIV immunopathogenesis.

26:37.267 --> 26:40.288
So she's not very skeptical about HIV, I guess, right?

26:40.968 --> 26:46.030
She probably thinks it came from bushmeat and was isolated by Bob Gallo, right?

26:46.591 --> 26:49.072
Just like David Baltimore says.

26:49.492 --> 26:53.073
And then we have kinetics of chronic human viruses.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.214
Chronic, is that like a latent virus?

26:56.294 --> 26:58.695
Like what Judy Mikovits was talking about?

26:58.735 --> 27:01.296
That seems to be her doctoral thesis.

27:01.356 --> 27:02.937
I don't know if that ever got published.

27:03.922 --> 27:04.442
Interesting.

27:04.902 --> 27:08.963
And here's another one, the kinetic modeling of hepatitis B virus.

27:10.123 --> 27:15.665
Is hepatitis B virus the one that, wow, that's interesting.

27:16.985 --> 27:26.307
And so she's actually a virologist by training, even though she calls herself a immunologist and computational, but she's a computational virologist by training.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.048
Molecular biology modeling came after.

27:30.814 --> 27:34.176
Here we're talking about monocysteine virulence genes.

27:35.777 --> 27:44.581
And so when we listen to this interview, I want you to listen for a few things because it's one of the first interviews we can find and it has Peter McCullough and her in it at the same time.

27:45.482 --> 27:48.964
I want you to listen to who they mention as fellow travelers.

27:50.205 --> 27:55.207
I want you to listen and try to identify what questions they offer up as important.

27:55.287 --> 28:00.110
And I want you to listen for what biological ideas are touched and what are not.

28:01.271 --> 28:04.073
They're not going to go in depth into anything, of course, because they never did.

28:06.134 --> 28:08.595
But I want you to see very carefully.

28:08.615 --> 28:15.059
And ask yourself, how is it possible that this is one of the first times she ever showed up and she shows up with who?

28:16.120 --> 28:18.741
Peter McCullough.

28:19.301 --> 28:19.962
Beatbox.

28:24.925 --> 28:28.186
I used to listen to the Fat Boys a lot, you know, the Fat Boys are wow.

28:28.487 --> 28:30.648
I wonder if I can find the Fat Boys on

28:31.972 --> 28:37.675
on Spotify because the Fat Boys were hilarious.

28:40.377 --> 28:42.638
Fat Boys, there they are.

28:44.379 --> 28:46.500
Oh my gosh, look at that, they're right there.

28:48.741 --> 28:51.863
I'm gonna have to listen to the Fat Boys later, that's pretty funny.

28:54.504 --> 28:55.305
That's right.

28:58.945 --> 29:14.760
that's really funny so anyway beatbox fat boys hilarious um let's uh let's do this uh escape oh sorry i had it all queued up here darn it losing my losing my plot here we had this ready to go too

29:27.580 --> 29:36.580
yes so throwback thursday jessica rose the virologist in 2021 trying to understand their illusion that's the goal today um

29:38.308 --> 29:40.249
And so let's get on with it, shall we?

29:40.970 --> 29:59.844
Interestingly, before I start this, I just want you to hear the title of this video or this podcast is something like the Jihad Podcast or Jihad Biology or something, which is strikingly similar to a friend of ours who does the Jihad Science Show, which I find pretty funny.

30:00.384 --> 30:02.146
Here we go, fun times.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.925
Welcome to Truth Jihad Audio.

30:07.945 --> 30:14.449
I'm Kevin Barrett talking with the folks who have the most to say from way outside the box of mainstream idiocy.

30:14.769 --> 30:19.232
And today I've got two of my heroes I've been following for quite some time.

30:19.632 --> 30:21.093
I finally got them on the show.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.295
Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Jessica Rose.

30:24.375 --> 30:24.876
They're both

30:25.376 --> 30:33.503
people with very strong medical credentials who've questioned the COVID party line and gotten some pushback for their pains.

30:33.843 --> 30:39.348
Dr. Peter McCullough is a cardiologist with a strong public health background, a master's in public health from the University of Michigan.

30:39.648 --> 30:54.160
Jessica is a Canadian researcher who's got a bachelor's in applied math, a master's in immunology, a PhD in computational biology, and on and on and on, even more than that, but we'll just get going here.

30:54.641 --> 30:55.746
That's pretty funny.

30:55.786 --> 30:57.011
Peter and Jessica, how are you?

30:58.036 --> 30:58.638
Great.

30:58.679 --> 30:59.301
Thanks for coming.

31:00.143 --> 31:01.464
Okay, well, it's an honor to have you.

31:01.764 --> 31:08.730
We'll start with Peter because although both guests are having some internet issues, Peter's are worse.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.353
So Peter, where to start here?

31:14.454 --> 31:27.905
First, well, quickly, maybe you could introduce yourself and let us know how you ended up being somebody who's being both cheered and smeared for saying sensible things about COVID and the experimental injections.

31:29.180 --> 31:42.950
I'm a practicing internist and cardiologist in Dallas, Texas, academic practice, spent about half my time seeing patients like yesterday and half my time in academic mode as an author and former editor and contributor.

31:43.290 --> 31:54.578
I'm a frequent news commentator now, never thought I would be in the limelight, but I was very much prepared for it in terms of my training and background in analyzing data,

31:55.311 --> 31:58.713
both as a clinical trialist and an epidemiologist.

31:59.853 --> 32:00.814
I have been cheered.

32:00.854 --> 32:01.814
There's no doubt about it.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.035
I've testified in the U.S.

32:03.095 --> 32:06.436
Senate and been well-received across multiple news platforms.

32:07.117 --> 32:15.801
I've only been jeered, I think, and in fact, I know, by people with no credentials and no credibility.

32:17.463 --> 32:21.906
And I think the jeers are about 1%, and I think the cheers are 99%.

32:22.607 --> 32:29.031
But if you can find somebody who's credible, who's ever said a discrediting statement, I'd be happy to see it.

32:29.311 --> 32:31.552
Well, here's a kind of humorous discrediting statement.

32:31.572 --> 32:40.578
According to Wikipedia, you're spreading misinformation about COVID because you are not sure that people under 30 should be getting the experimental injections.

32:40.858 --> 32:43.480
Now, I don't quite understand that.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.822
Well, let me just say, Wikipedia

32:46.829 --> 32:49.693
has contributors who are anonymous.

32:50.214 --> 32:53.879
The most frequent contributor to my Wikipedia page is not me.

32:54.119 --> 32:56.322
I should actually be writing my own Wikipedia page.

32:56.402 --> 32:58.005
In fact, Wikipedia has locked me out.

32:58.566 --> 33:01.610
It's someone in Illinois named the Altman.

33:02.130 --> 33:03.312
So it's an anonymous.

33:04.093 --> 33:08.537
uncredentialed person who's putting incorrect information on my Wikipedia page.

33:08.617 --> 33:25.431
So Wikipedia, in my view, since it's not a biographical or autobiographical page that's credentialed or allows the individual to actually put correct information in, Wikipedia should be removed from the internet and clearly not viewed by anybody who's interested in the truth.

33:25.939 --> 33:26.679
I agree completely.

33:26.699 --> 33:29.921
I had a five-year battle with Wikipedia myself, and it was maddening.

33:30.021 --> 33:38.546
They had libelous information up for five years that couldn't be taken down, sourced to an anonymous obscure blog, lying about me.

33:38.586 --> 33:40.687
So yeah, it's completely insane.

33:42.488 --> 33:50.553
And the idea that questioning whether people under 30 should be getting these COVID injections is also completely insane, isn't it?

33:52.294 --> 33:53.155
Where did they come up with that?

33:53.755 --> 33:55.276
I'm a doctor, so I decide.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.614
not Wikipedia, but I decide.

33:58.734 --> 34:04.079
I have the medical authority to decide and help patients judge the risks and the benefits.

34:04.619 --> 34:17.030
The risks of the vaccines in people under 30 far outweigh any benefits that could be had even from the very beginning against the wild type strain of which the vaccines were designed to block.

34:17.330 --> 34:29.142
So can we agree then that right now the the idea is is that we're questioning the vaccine for people under 30 but we are agreeing that the vaccine is absolutely fine for people above 30.

34:29.522 --> 34:30.263
Can you hear that?

34:31.424 --> 34:32.005
Can you hear it?

34:32.045 --> 34:35.749
Make sure you hear it because that's exactly what they're saying here.

34:36.810 --> 34:38.131
Stop lying!

34:42.436 --> 34:44.376
I don't know what happened there, but that's really gross.

34:44.656 --> 34:45.857
That's what we're dealing with here.

34:45.897 --> 34:47.938
We're dealing with something very, very gross.

34:52.939 --> 35:01.383
Now with the Omicron strain across the age spectrum, the risks, which are still there, outweigh any theoretical benefits.

35:01.403 --> 35:02.563
And again, I'm the doctor.

35:02.743 --> 35:07.425
I have the authority to decide and make that judgment, not anonymous Wikipedia people.

35:08.131 --> 35:10.313
Well, I'm not a doctor, but that's sure how it looked to me, too.

35:10.553 --> 35:16.858
I just can't imagine why anybody would be telling young people to have got even back in the bad old days of Delta.

35:16.879 --> 35:21.062
But even then, the numbers didn't make any sense to me either.

35:22.023 --> 35:23.504
So, Peter.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.326
Where did this COVID thing come from?

35:27.307 --> 35:32.191
It looks like a bioweapon, and there are various theories about that.

35:33.291 --> 35:39.496
To my mind, even just the presumption that that's a possibility means we need to shut down biological weapons research.

35:39.516 --> 35:45.340
Maybe you can tell us your thoughts about biological weaponry and the possible link with COVID.

35:46.092 --> 35:49.053
That's beyond my range as a medical doctor.

35:49.073 --> 35:54.515
I've been treating patients who are falling sick with the virus or after receiving the vaccine.

35:54.555 --> 36:00.217
But I do would refer you and the listeners to Peter Bragan, COVID-19 and the Global Predators, We Are the Prey.

36:00.257 --> 36:02.338
It's about a thousand references in it.

36:02.398 --> 36:04.379
I wrote one of the introductions.

36:04.859 --> 36:11.702
It's probably the best synthesis of where the virus came from, who are the collaborators and what are the potential motivations.

36:12.488 --> 36:13.388
Thank you for that reference.

36:13.528 --> 36:14.328
I will check that out.

36:15.449 --> 36:28.711
So regarding the vaccines, it seems that there's a huge accumulation of danger signals suggesting that they are neither safe.

36:28.751 --> 36:37.673
Well, we know they're not very effective in terms of promoting herd immunity, but we also are learning that there are a lot of reasons to think that they're unsafe.

36:38.053 --> 36:39.933
What are the most important ones in your view?

36:40.578 --> 36:43.582
We always consider safety first before efficacy.

36:43.622 --> 36:49.230
So even if the vaccines were perfect against COVID, if they were unsafe, we still wouldn't use them.

36:49.770 --> 36:53.075
So we always, we would never have somebody take an injection and be harmed.

36:53.275 --> 36:55.117
That's completely unacceptable.

36:55.638 --> 37:05.585
We know now from the released court-ordered Pfizer documents, Pfizer had 1,223 deaths reported to them within 90 days of release of their product.

37:06.185 --> 37:08.007
That is completely unacceptable.

37:08.367 --> 37:12.310
They should have pulled the product off the market at 50 deaths or before.

37:13.170 --> 37:16.393
And by continuing to have the product on the market,

37:17.153 --> 37:26.524
Pfizer basically defrauded the government as providing a safe and effective product and chances are if we get the Moderna and Johnson and Johnson documents we'll find the same thing.

37:26.985 --> 37:35.635
Dr. Rose is with us and she's an expert on the vaccine adverse event reporting system that shows alarming signals as does a yellow card and the EU

37:36.235 --> 37:39.878
uterus system, there's also the V-safe and Vigi-safe systems.

37:40.258 --> 37:56.252
All of them show alarming, unacceptable, catastrophic deaths that occur a few days after receiving the vaccine, and then an array of non-fatal syndromes, some of them causing permanent injury, neurologic, cardiovascular, immunologic, and hematologic.

37:56.872 --> 37:57.853
And so there you have it.

37:58.393 --> 38:05.837
Jessica Rose is coming on the scene right now as an expert on VAERS, even though she's a virologist and a computational biologist.

38:06.457 --> 38:10.379
Because she can crunch numbers, I guess, she's become an expert on VAERS.

38:10.459 --> 38:15.002
And now here is Peter McCullough telling us that she's an expert on VAERS.

38:15.162 --> 38:19.304
And he's introducing her in a way that sounds like it's a relatively new introduction.

38:20.216 --> 38:30.641
They haven't made this appearance often, and she is not a well-known, you know, like she is now, where she can go in front of a crowd in Geneva and rap and get away with it.

38:32.782 --> 38:36.424
And Dr. Rose, what do you think are the worst of these things?

38:36.524 --> 38:37.625
And she's not a doctor.

38:37.705 --> 38:42.747
So if we're calling her Dr. Rose in the presence of Dr. McCullough, that's just kind of dumb.

38:42.927 --> 38:47.870
But we are, and we're going to keep doing it the whole podcast, which is already a problem, in my humble opinion.

38:49.725 --> 38:52.666
Oh, well, that depends on your point of view.

38:52.826 --> 38:56.066
But I mean, most people would think that death is the worst.

38:57.526 --> 39:02.727
We're at over 30,000 deaths in the domestic data set in VAERS right now.

39:03.547 --> 39:12.429
And as Peter said, this is mirrored in all of the adverse event data collection systems that are somewhat functioning right now around the world.

39:14.409 --> 39:18.850
I would say that personally, the neurological adverse event reports are

39:19.896 --> 39:30.308
One of the worst because these can be debilitating there's actually a category in there's called disability and the the numbers of disabled.

39:32.124 --> 39:35.948
of people reporting disabilities in the context of these injections.

39:36.008 --> 39:41.512
And now we're only talking about the Pfizer, the Moderna, and the Janssen products in the United States.

39:41.552 --> 39:42.833
So this is just three products.

39:43.954 --> 39:45.635
It's just off the charts.

39:45.695 --> 39:48.638
It's not even comparable to anything we've seen historically.

39:49.839 --> 39:54.423
And again, as Peter said, I mean, at 50 deaths, the product should have been pulled.

39:54.603 --> 39:57.405
This should have been pulled in January last year.

39:59.167 --> 40:17.562
So what you can see already, if we're talking about Janssen and Pfizer and Moderna as the same and lumping them all together as one thing, then what you're gonna see, of course, is they're seeding the narrative that the government is gonna admit that Janssen causes problems.

40:17.602 --> 40:21.325
The UK is gonna admit that, what was that one called?

40:21.425 --> 40:22.125
AstraZeneca?

40:22.145 --> 40:26.189
Has problems.

40:27.156 --> 40:30.420
And so they're seeding the narrative right now.

40:30.500 --> 40:35.627
They can't even differentiate between a transformation and a transfection.

40:41.074 --> 40:41.274
Right?

40:44.039 --> 40:45.901
They're not even differentiating between the two.

40:45.961 --> 40:50.166
So that's, sorry for that bad writing, but that's what I hear here.

40:50.226 --> 40:56.853
I hear a setup because Janssen, Pfizer, and Moderna are listed as all equivalent.

40:58.951 --> 41:05.296
It's not rational, it's not logical, it doesn't make any sense why this is continuing to this day.

41:05.697 --> 41:16.646
And not only continuing, but being pushed and promoted more shots, more versions of shots against more versions of this virus.

41:16.746 --> 41:19.108
It's insanity, it doesn't make any sense to me.

41:20.097 --> 41:41.452
Well, Dr. Peter McCullough, the VAERS data has been questioned in that, as Matthew Crawford said when he was on the show a few weeks ago, that theoretically every death data has been questioned in that, as Matthew Crawford said when he was on the show a few weeks ago, that

41:42.272 --> 41:53.020
Theoretically, every death that occurs within X time of vaccination ought to be reported to VAERS, which would be a very, very large number, even if the vaccine weren't killing anybody.

41:53.381 --> 41:56.683
So how do you think we should be interpreting the VAERS data?

41:57.003 --> 41:57.724
Do you see it?

41:58.925 --> 42:09.993
Matthew Crawford was on his podcast, the Jihad Truth podcast before Jessica Rose and Peter McCullough and

42:11.283 --> 42:21.812
Matthew Crawford met Robert Malone at the very, very first international COVID summit in San Juan or Puerto Rico or wherever the hell that was in 2020.

42:23.834 --> 42:30.400
Are you seeing that it's all just one big team Malone yet or are you still trying to deny it?

42:33.430 --> 42:42.443
We should interpret it as being valid for what's there, but being a grossly underreported set of data.

42:43.104 --> 42:49.234
So initially, events are reported, they get a temporary VAERS number, then the CDC vets it,

42:49.614 --> 42:52.937
And then when it's found to be valid, it gets a permanent VAERS number.

42:52.977 --> 42:56.139
The data Dr. Rose gave you are the permanent VAERS number.

42:56.299 --> 43:03.945
I've done numerous VAERS submissions, and I can tell you there are queries and calls from the CDC.

43:03.965 --> 43:09.229
If the lot number isn't correct or they want to know the MRI or the blood test, the CDC verifies it.

43:09.269 --> 43:13.633
So these numbers up in the database are legitimate and real.

43:14.433 --> 43:16.854
The concern is that they're a gross underreport.

43:16.914 --> 43:33.120
A paper by Pantazatos and Seligman in the ResearchGate preprint server system using census data and vaccine administration data, it's an ecological analysis, suggests the upper bound of the confidence interval for the number of lives lost after the vaccine

43:33.680 --> 43:40.142
through December of 2021 could be as high as 187,000 Americans.

43:40.202 --> 43:50.744
It's catastrophic, but it's cohesive with what we're hearing from the life insurance systems, where all the life insurance systems are reporting in now record numbers of deaths in people working age.

43:52.024 --> 43:52.364
That's right.

43:52.705 --> 43:58.846
And Dr. Jessica Rose, you recently wrote a post about the deaths among millennials.

44:00.066 --> 44:02.567
What is the data show about that?

44:03.689 --> 44:12.566
So yeah, there's this surge of deaths in millennials, which are 25 to 44 year olds.

44:12.606 --> 44:13.588
These are young people.

44:15.985 --> 44:21.287
84% surplus of deaths in the fall of 2021, which is completely unexplained.

44:21.747 --> 44:22.747
Nobody knows why.

44:22.767 --> 44:31.331
It's, according to what I found, it's not due to drug overdoses and suicides and all of these, these other ways.

44:31.551 --> 44:35.693
According to what I've found, no data provided.

44:36.915 --> 44:39.076
No, no explanation needed.

44:39.696 --> 44:42.918
It's not due to drugs and overdoses.

44:42.978 --> 44:44.359
It's not due to suicide.

44:44.399 --> 44:46.380
It's something else really weird.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.260
Holy shit.

44:48.961 --> 44:50.341
Holy shit.

44:51.122 --> 44:51.982
Five to 44 year olds.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.083
These are young people.

44:53.303 --> 44:53.363
Um,

44:55.422 --> 45:00.726
84% surplus of deaths in the fall of 2021, which is completely unexplained.

45:01.167 --> 45:02.188
Nobody knows why.

45:02.208 --> 45:04.930
It's- Do you see my arm?

45:04.950 --> 45:06.972
Do you see my arm?

45:09.226 --> 45:10.167
They lied to us.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.650
These people lied to us.

45:12.710 --> 45:17.255
They lied to us and we lied to our kids and that's why we're here right now.

45:17.615 --> 45:28.568
There's no way to explain why she just happens to have to say the opioid epidemic right now unless Mark has been right all along and they've been using that shit.

45:30.799 --> 45:31.980
This is really awful.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.161
This is really worse than I ever imagined it would be.

45:35.181 --> 45:38.263
Thank you for the person to send me this video.

45:38.303 --> 45:41.504
Thank you, Pamela, for having found it and the other person who sent it to me.

45:41.564 --> 45:42.785
I'm really sad right now.

45:43.405 --> 45:46.867
There's this surge of debts in millennials, which are 25 to 44 year olds.

45:46.887 --> 45:47.407
These are young people.

45:52.681 --> 45:58.864
84% surplus of deaths in the fall of 2021, which is completely unexplained.

45:59.324 --> 46:00.345
Nobody knows why.

46:01.305 --> 46:19.293
It's, according to what I found, it's not due to drug overdoses and suicides and all of these other ways of, or these ways of dying that, yes, they're on the grow, but they only comprise a certain percentage of this overgrowth of death.

46:19.413 --> 46:20.994
So- There's no way to explain it.

46:21.923 --> 46:33.151
There's absolutely no way to explain why she needs to address these other sources of death, but still clarify that even though those are rising, of course, I'm not ignoring them.

46:33.531 --> 46:34.511
It's not just that.

46:34.551 --> 46:36.293
There's something else in the background.

46:37.253 --> 46:39.495
It's very mysterious, strange.

46:41.556 --> 46:42.377
Stop lying!

46:44.918 --> 46:45.659
Are you mad yet?

46:47.760 --> 46:48.561
Are you mad yet?

46:50.740 --> 46:54.802
Something caused this surplus of death in young people.

46:54.982 --> 46:59.924
It's outrageous that this isn't like headline news.

46:59.944 --> 47:00.964
So it couldn't be murder.

47:01.344 --> 47:16.130
It couldn't be a combination of all these things, including putting people on supplementary oxygen or unneeded ventilation or unneeded remdesivir or any number of ways, including the opioid crisis.

47:17.329 --> 47:20.550
But according to what I found, it's not that at all.

47:21.210 --> 47:25.751
According to what I found, no data provided, no source cited.

47:25.771 --> 47:28.572
Stop lying!

47:29.792 --> 47:34.293
News and, you know, extra, extra read all about it, like back in the day.

47:34.853 --> 47:41.335
It's not right that nobody is giving a clear answer as to what killed these people.

47:41.555 --> 47:43.395
It's factual.

47:44.015 --> 47:46.416
It's confirmed in many different ways.

47:47.728 --> 47:52.680
Yeah, and it's, yeah, again, it's inexplicable.

47:53.502 --> 47:56.570
There are so many answers that we need and that we're not getting.

47:57.888 --> 48:05.153
Jessica Rose has been on Tommy's podcast with Matt Crawford at least twice, if not three times in these years.

48:05.273 --> 48:09.715
Just keep that in mind as we move forward with these fake experts.

48:10.016 --> 48:17.760
And Dr. McCullough, what about the reports of athletes dropping from cardiac problems, sometimes dead and sometimes not?

48:19.101 --> 48:21.123
Are those also concerning?

48:21.143 --> 48:23.964
Have you looked at the statistical analysis of those?

48:24.164 --> 48:24.965
What should we think of those?

48:26.966 --> 48:37.688
Roughly 700 athletes, mainly European, mainly soccer and rugby and other forms of football, 700 have had cardiac arrest during competition or practice.

48:38.149 --> 48:42.270
About half of them have been successfully resuscitated, half sadly have died.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.070
These are record numbers.

48:45.310 --> 48:52.772
Not a single case has there been a reporting that they took the vaccine, had myocarditis and died, not a single case.

48:56.727 --> 49:02.749
700 athletes have died in the EU, mostly football players, soccer players.

49:02.869 --> 49:06.850
About half of them have died and been unable to revive.

49:07.070 --> 49:14.092
And none of them, none of them have been reported as being vaxxed, having myocarditis and died.

49:14.132 --> 49:16.793
That's exactly what he said.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.485
forms of football.

49:20.505 --> 49:24.446
700 have had cardiac arrests during competition or practice.

49:24.926 --> 49:27.586
About half of them have been successfully resuscitated.

49:27.686 --> 49:29.027
Half, sadly, have died.

49:29.447 --> 49:30.847
These are record numbers.

49:32.067 --> 49:38.268
Not a single case has there been a reporting that they took the vaccine, had myocarditis, and died.

49:38.348 --> 49:39.548
Not a single case.

49:39.949 --> 49:43.769
In fact, there's almost little or nothing said about each one of these deaths.

49:43.849 --> 49:45.169
It's almost like a mystery.

49:45.469 --> 49:48.290
We do know globally these leagues have enforced

49:51.653 --> 49:55.857
Oh, looks like we may have lost Dr. Peter McCullough, as he predicted.

49:56.838 --> 49:58.459
Dr. Jessica Rose, are you still there?

49:59.780 --> 50:00.461
I am, yes.

50:01.021 --> 50:03.083
Okay, looks like we may have lost Peter.

50:03.103 --> 50:05.104
Oop, there he goes.

50:06.205 --> 50:06.746
Come in, Peter.

50:07.787 --> 50:08.427
Now he's gone.

50:08.567 --> 50:09.008
He's gone.

50:09.148 --> 50:09.468
Okay.

50:10.029 --> 50:14.993
Well, maybe you can pick up from there about the mysterious deaths of athletes.

50:15.779 --> 50:16.319
Yeah, sure.

50:16.479 --> 50:35.630
And I'll segue into the conversation about causation, because there's a huge pushback from all sides as to the debate of, are these injections causing all of these adverse events?

50:36.250 --> 50:38.892
Without a reasonable doubt, to me, they are.

50:39.232 --> 50:41.473
And there's a way to verify this.

50:43.084 --> 51:02.215
Using something called the Bradford Hill criteria, which is a, you know, long since used set of criteria that you can use to assess a causal effect in epidemiological or biological data and one of the ways that you can do that one of one of the criteria is called specificity.

51:02.771 --> 51:17.178
So that applies to our healthy young athletes and also our young children who are suffering these massively rare cardiac events and myocarditis, for example.

51:18.359 --> 51:28.504
If you take a young person and you ask yourself the question, okay, is it common for a young person to have a heart attack?

51:29.011 --> 51:33.034
Is it common for a 15-year-old boy, for example, to have myocarditis?

51:33.655 --> 51:42.202
Is it common for a healthy young athlete at the peak of their career to just drop dead from a cardiac event?

51:42.723 --> 51:52.511
So you look in specific populations where you would never expect, just logically or statistically, for these things to occur.

51:52.891 --> 51:54.372
And we're finding these things.

51:55.923 --> 52:00.586
much higher rates than above background in both of these specific populations.

52:00.706 --> 52:15.076
So yeah, and again, once again, we have not seen this before with a product that's being peddled to such a large proportion of the human population.

52:17.458 --> 52:18.419
There's just no

52:20.017 --> 52:21.777
There's no explaining this.

52:22.077 --> 52:22.718
Well, there is.

52:22.818 --> 52:24.098
It's just that you won't do it.

52:24.158 --> 52:29.639
So what you can see here very carefully is that this molecular biologist won't use the word transfection.

52:30.359 --> 52:34.800
This molecular biologist won't differentiate between old vaccines and new vaccines.

52:35.320 --> 52:38.020
They want to keep that debate to a minimum.

52:39.000 --> 52:47.302
The only thing they really want to discuss here is the idea that there is a signal that we don't really understand, and it's not coming from the lockdowns.

52:48.706 --> 52:50.267
It's not coming from the protocols.

52:51.828 --> 52:55.810
It's not coming from the opioid crisis.

52:55.990 --> 53:01.272
It's coming from something else that, you know, much higher rates in these groups of people.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.395
But you're not asking the right question at all.

53:06.475 --> 53:09.396
The question that she wants us to ask is, is it common?

53:10.217 --> 53:14.979
What are the rates that these things happen in a normal population?

53:16.420 --> 53:20.203
Why not just differentiate between the people that have taken the shot and the people that haven't?

53:22.805 --> 53:29.791
Why even open the door for the possibility that these might be normal rates, but we first have to determine what the normal rate is?

53:32.739 --> 53:41.082
It's just running out the clock, ladies and gentlemen, on questions that get you to the end zone much slower, in a much more circuitous route.

53:41.282 --> 53:42.963
It's exactly what Peter said.

53:43.443 --> 53:53.247
Even if these products are 100% efficacious, which they are not, they're negatively efficacious right now, which means that they're causing harm to your immune system, as a matter of fact.

53:53.945 --> 53:56.466
It doesn't matter if the product isn't safe.

53:56.907 --> 54:02.810
If it's even killing 50 people, it needs to be removed from use.

54:04.050 --> 54:05.811
This is the job of our regulators.

54:06.132 --> 54:11.594
So they're calling it a product as if it's a novel product, just like the novel virus, but it's not a novel product.

54:11.674 --> 54:15.216
It's a transfection by a lipofectamine, by a lipid nanoparticle.

54:15.717 --> 54:19.919
It's all the same bullshit that we've been using on our lab benches for decades.

54:21.087 --> 54:27.069
The only improvement of it is that it's a unique formulation of the lipid nanoparticle that they can claim is novel.

54:28.050 --> 54:35.552
And that apparently Robert Malone thinks he can claim that Peter Cullis told him was fine and stayed at the injection site and that's why he took it.

54:36.033 --> 54:36.733
Stop lying!

54:37.455 --> 54:58.503
These people are all on the same team, and they are all lying, and they've been lying from the very beginning to try and make sure that we focused all of our energy on solving the mystery of the novel gain-of-function virus, the bioweapon, as the jihad truther said, and that we didn't ever come to the conclusion that maybe we should investigate further what happened in 2020.

54:58.803 --> 55:00.404
Maybe it was just murder and lies.

55:01.448 --> 55:02.871
Jessica's not worried about that.

55:03.291 --> 55:05.636
It's not even opioids and suicide.

55:05.656 --> 55:07.018
We don't even have to worry about those.

55:07.058 --> 55:09.162
There's something else a lot creepier around.

55:09.703 --> 55:11.447
Regulatory bodies like the FDA.

55:13.112 --> 55:23.515
And it's interesting, the media is telling us that, well, whatever problems there might be with the vaccines, that they're actually doing a lot more good than harm.

55:23.815 --> 55:25.555
They're saving you from the evils of COVID.

55:25.615 --> 55:26.816
There it is, there it is.

55:26.836 --> 55:27.836
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

55:29.456 --> 55:37.639
So what you and Dr. McCullough say is that basically we have to have a do no harm kind of approach.

55:38.279 --> 55:38.799
Precisely.

55:39.795 --> 55:39.955
Right.

55:40.436 --> 55:55.588
And then, but the other side of that, and of course, you know, people with kind of the military approach to things, you know, military people are very much acculturated to sacrificing a certain number of their troops in order to gain a strategic advantage, win the war and save more of their troops.

55:56.368 --> 56:00.432
And it does make you wonder whether somebody high up in these agencies

56:01.192 --> 56:02.673
might be thinking along those lines.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.875
That's the implication of the way the media talks about it.

56:04.915 --> 56:13.741
The implication would be that, well, if we kill 100 people or even 100,000 and we save half a million or a million, then we've done a net good.

56:13.781 --> 56:14.902
So there's a philosophy.

56:14.962 --> 56:17.864
Do not harm doesn't work if it's worst case scenario.

56:17.904 --> 56:20.586
And worst case scenario was what a lot of people said it was.

56:20.807 --> 56:22.108
All the George Webb team

56:22.788 --> 56:24.949
said it was worst case scenario, a bioweapon.

56:25.389 --> 56:38.432
Kim.com became convinced after he did a little Twitter space with Kevin McCarran and Charles Rixey that it was a bioweapon and that if they wanted to, they could make a bioweapon be much more effective than a nuclear bomb.

56:41.673 --> 56:43.333
About a year and a half before the pandemic,

56:44.428 --> 56:53.055
Ralph Baric compared a bunch of different worst case scenarios like pole shift and these kinds of things and put pandemics on that list as well.

56:53.935 --> 57:00.640
And so here we are again, agreeing about, well, I mean, if shit is bad enough, then we may need to have to mandate things.

57:00.660 --> 57:04.663
You know, like if the vaccines work, then Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:04.703 --> 57:09.987
is fine with mandates, but until we have placebo controlled trials, no mandates, man.

57:12.278 --> 57:15.880
These people are liars, traitors to our children.

57:16.561 --> 57:17.421
Tickle issue there.

57:17.441 --> 57:21.724
And maybe you could concisely explain the do no harm position.

57:22.964 --> 57:32.270
Well, I'm not a medical doctor, but if I was, I would abide by my oath to do no harm, which you have to take if you become a medical doctor.

57:34.351 --> 57:36.973
One of the parts of doing no harm

57:37.563 --> 58:07.113
if you're a medical doctor and you treat patients is to ensure that not only you are up to date on what's going on in the pharmaceutical world, in the vaccine world, in the peer-reviewed literature world, in all the studies that you probably should be reading world, you have to convey that information to your patient as part of informed consent, especially when you're talking about a brand new experimental product

58:07.659 --> 58:10.701
that's being mandated in many cases.

58:10.741 --> 58:12.862
It's not a brand new experimental product.

58:12.902 --> 58:19.505
It is a transfection and a transformation, which you could differentiate by saying the one uses DNA and one uses RNA.

58:19.625 --> 58:21.406
One has a viral vector, one doesn't.

58:21.947 --> 58:28.750
You could explain all of this and explain how neither of these things comes anywhere near what we used to call a vaccine.

58:28.790 --> 58:37.235
And then, and then Jessica Rose, you would be helping people to get closer to the goal line that you just mentioned, which is informed consent.

58:38.936 --> 58:45.480
But instead, there's no video or recording of you talking about informed consent in front of the ACIP.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.262
There's a video of me, which you never shared.

58:50.664 --> 59:02.512
She is a traitor and a liar and working for NATO, Canada and Israel, but not America and not America's kids, not to protect the American constitution.

59:02.572 --> 59:06.855
She is part of the team that is designed to undermine it, I assure you.

59:08.964 --> 59:10.325
In many places in the world.

59:11.025 --> 59:25.009
So, it's this duty of medical doctors to do no harm is is seemingly being waived by many people and I'm not sure why that is.

59:26.034 --> 59:33.116
Um, I mean, maybe they don't think there is harm because they're simply just not up to date on the data.

59:33.256 --> 59:39.257
I would dare say that that's the reason why, but I don't think that's an excuse.

59:39.998 --> 59:49.720
I think it's, it's, it's absolutely your duty as a physician with patients to be up to date.

59:50.290 --> 59:55.232
And the data is very clear on both the efficacy and the safety of these products.

59:55.712 --> 01:00:02.195
The VAERS data is also clear about the previous vaccine schedule or not?

01:00:04.436 --> 01:00:11.718
The VAERS data before the vaccine schedule, I mean, before the COVID started was supposedly between 40 times underreported.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.278
Jessica is not concerned about that at all.

01:00:16.338 --> 01:00:25.244
Jessica is very concerned that people don't see that whatever signal we had before the pandemic, if that's zero, then we now have a very strong signal.

01:00:26.705 --> 01:00:30.007
And so her message is, is that there was no signal before the pandemic.

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:38.352
There was no hazard before the pandemic, even though a lot of people at Children's Health Defense and ICANN before the pandemic believed that there was.

01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:42.395
That's why they made the movie Vaxxed, and that's why they made the movie Vaxxed 2.

01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:49.576
But Peter McCullough and Jessica Rose right now are 100% dead on Ball's narrative.

01:00:49.596 --> 01:00:51.897
There's a novel virus that needs novel solutions.

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:57.180
These two are on the cutting edge of this novel understanding of this novel challenge.

01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:02.042
Liars.

01:01:02.923 --> 01:01:05.084
It's really, really clear.

01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:12.548
The pharmacovigilance tools that we use to assess safety signals like VAERS are screaming

01:01:13.027 --> 01:01:18.210
red flags in just about every adverse event type you can imagine.

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:25.694
There are over 10,000 types of adverse events reported to VAERS right now in the context of these products.

01:01:25.794 --> 01:01:33.117
So it's not just the absolute numbers of the reports, which like Peter said, are severely underreported.

01:01:33.878 --> 01:01:35.318
It's the number of types.

01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:41.982
If you pick any system, any tissue, any tissue system, any cell type,

01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:51.147
in the human body, somehow these products are affecting them in some populations of people.

01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:54.488
And that's one of the points I've been pushing.

01:01:55.429 --> 01:01:56.969
This is happening.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:58.890
They can deny it all they want.

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.051
And so she has no biological explanation for that?

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:07.373
She has no biological explanation for that?

01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:11.655
Because I think Byron Bridle hasn't come out yet.

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:17.994
Or Byron Bridle's gonna come out next week.

01:02:19.995 --> 01:02:21.155
This is July 6th.

01:02:23.776 --> 01:02:29.899
Bret Weinstein's classic podcast with Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch is two weeks after this.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.881
Or it's in June, sorry, it's in June of 2021.

01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:35.221
So when is this?

01:02:35.261 --> 01:02:36.582
This is June 6th, July.

01:02:36.602 --> 01:02:38.623
I think this is July 6th.

01:02:38.823 --> 01:02:40.303
I'm sure, I gotta look it up again.

01:02:40.744 --> 01:02:43.685
Let me just do that quick to make sure I'm right.

01:02:46.343 --> 01:02:54.987
This was posted two years ago.

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:56.187
I don't see the date here.

01:02:56.227 --> 01:02:57.388
This is the subscript.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:58.588
It says April 20th, 2022.

01:02:58.688 --> 01:02:58.888
Really?

01:02:58.968 --> 01:02:59.168
Really?

01:02:59.188 --> 01:02:59.168
2022?

01:02:59.248 --> 01:02:59.528
No way.

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:04.831
That's super late.

01:03:04.851 --> 01:03:04.911
Wow.

01:03:04.931 --> 01:03:04.911
2022?

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:06.851
They're just talking like this now?

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:17.503
Isn't that incredible?

01:03:19.406 --> 01:03:23.571
They're still talking about Janssen as if it's on the market.

01:03:23.611 --> 01:03:25.213
That seems really odd to me.

01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:26.975
Is that possible?

01:03:27.836 --> 01:03:32.723
When did they take, can someone find out when they took Janssen off the market?

01:03:32.823 --> 01:03:33.764
I thought that was in 21 already.

01:03:34.653 --> 01:03:35.713
but it is happening.

01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:46.677
And the annoying part for me as a scientist is that the work that needs to be done now is to figure out who this is happening to and why precisely.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:50.679
And because they're denying the existence of the problem itself.

01:03:50.719 --> 01:03:52.199
We don't need to find out why.

01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:54.000
We already know why.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.962
Transfection and transformation were always criminally negligent in healthy humans.

01:03:59.022 --> 01:03:59.942
That's why, Jessica.

01:04:01.178 --> 01:04:03.020
And you knew that already in 2022.

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:04.843
I assure you she knew that.

01:04:04.923 --> 01:04:10.791
If this is really April 20th, 2022, then I am shocked.

01:04:12.553 --> 01:04:13.995
I am shocked.

01:04:14.575 --> 01:04:16.198
Those studies aren't being done.

01:04:18.217 --> 01:04:31.006
Well, I've had Meryl Ness on this show, and she points out that the VAERS data, of course, is extremely concerning, but it's hard to know what to make of it, given that... A pause in 2022.

01:04:31.106 --> 01:04:31.866
Wow.

01:04:31.946 --> 01:04:34.868
So my timeframe has really been compressed.

01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:37.410
I thought for some reason they pulled it in 2021.

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.011
Holy shit.

01:04:39.071 --> 01:04:41.813
So the show was really, really slow.

01:04:43.959 --> 01:04:47.001
The show was really, really slow.

01:04:47.061 --> 01:04:49.062
And now you can really see how slow it is.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:57.987
If in April 20th, 2022, this woman still can't go beyond saying, there's, there's, there's, and it's all over the body.

01:04:58.607 --> 01:05:00.168
And we better find out why.

01:05:06.673 --> 01:05:06.953
Wow.

01:05:07.013 --> 01:05:07.313
Okay.

01:05:07.354 --> 01:05:09.955
Well, Albert wrote about it last night.

01:05:10.015 --> 01:05:16.180
You can check that out with his, he's working on the data that Steve Kirsch has been pimping the check data.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:16.940
So check that out.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.262
Albert's in the chat there with a, with a link.

01:05:19.402 --> 01:05:26.287
Matthew Crawford said that theoretically everybody would self those studies aren't being done.

01:05:28.302 --> 01:05:43.764
Well, I've had Meryl Ness on this show, and she points out that the there's data, of course is extremely concerning, but it's hard to know what to make of it, given that, as Matthew Crawford said that theoretically, everybody who has

01:05:44.745 --> 01:05:51.867
any problem after a vaccine up to who knows, you know, two weeks or a month, or there isn't even a timeframe really.

01:05:52.207 --> 01:05:53.328
There's no official timeframe.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:06:02.071
So any medical problem of any kind whatsoever after getting a vaccine, theoretically, you know, you could die 50 years after the vaccine from old age.

01:06:02.151 --> 01:06:04.651
And theoretically, there's no reason not to report that to VAERS.

01:06:05.112 --> 01:06:09.133
So given that there's such loose reporting criteria,

01:06:10.713 --> 01:06:12.334
It's really hard.

01:06:12.454 --> 01:06:17.335
It's easy for the establishment to tell us that, oh, it's all coincidence.

01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:21.457
All of these different kinds of problems are just problems that people would have had anyway.

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:28.119
And it's just a coincidence that they happen to have them within X timeframe, whatever that timeframe may be from the Xs.

01:06:28.299 --> 01:06:30.580
So anyway, Meryl Ness points out that, yeah,

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:36.023
She thinks that actually the VAERS data is probably underreported, but we can't prove that.

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:54.755
But she says that the government is holding really good data, that they've paid a lot of taxpayers' money for really good data, and they've kept it under lock and key, which is both outrageous in terms of swindling the taxpayers who paid for all that data, but also very suspicious.

01:06:56.436 --> 01:07:00.158
What's your take on all of that data that's not being released?

01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:04.139
Yeah, it's shameful because it does exist.

01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:10.806
They have more demographic data than we know about.

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:19.475
A, we don't know about it and therefore B, we don't know what it's telling us or what it would if we had access.

01:07:19.915 --> 01:07:24.100
This is the same story that we're being peddled from

01:07:24.738 --> 01:07:25.899
from the manufacturers.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:36.389
As you know, as you're probably well aware, you know, Pfizer wanted to hide their safety and efficacy data for 75 years.

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:49.122
And they've been ordered by the court now, thanks to some brave lawyers, to release this data over the next, I guess we have seven months,

01:07:49.642 --> 01:07:54.246
left now, uh, you know, tens of thousands of pages of data per month.

01:07:54.366 --> 01:08:01.592
And they were fighting and fighting and saying, well, we'll do this, but we'll-we'll redact some of it, and-and blah, blah, blah.

01:08:01.612 --> 01:08:03.134
It's like, no, no, no, no.

01:08:04.055 --> 01:08:10.220
You know, the public has a right to know what your studies showed in the clinical trials.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.084
Um... So don't forget, Naomi Wolf is gonna be the one that organizes 2,300 people.

01:08:18.436 --> 01:08:22.520
to use their free time to read those documents from Pfizer.

01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:28.187
And then she puts out substacks and releases things over time, all the time, people paying attention to.

01:08:28.627 --> 01:08:35.555
She claims that she had 2,300 smart people working on the Pfizer documents.

01:08:38.973 --> 01:08:39.833
That's impressive.

01:08:39.873 --> 01:08:43.974
So they didn't mention Naomi Wolf, but that's what they're talking about with the Pfizer documents.

01:08:44.034 --> 01:08:49.976
And in fact, I think she started with that already in June of 2021, a year earlier than this.

01:08:50.556 --> 01:08:52.576
I've already been injected with it.

01:08:52.636 --> 01:08:55.857
So, you know, that's an important thing for us to know.

01:08:57.717 --> 01:08:58.878
It's just appalling.

01:08:58.998 --> 01:09:04.819
I mean, you have to ask yourself, what would be the motivation of anybody

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:07.824
To hide safety data.

01:09:08.424 --> 01:09:20.034
And like I've said before, the only reason you would ever want to hide safety data is if you really don't want people to know that it's revealing that your product isn't safe.

01:09:20.515 --> 01:09:22.656
That would be the only reason to hide it.

01:09:23.237 --> 01:09:26.260
And then you have to start getting appalled.

01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:36.945
and realize that- See, what she wants you to think is that this is all just about money and greed and assholes that are doing it because someone else would do it if I didn't do it.

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:40.266
And of course, that's not the case at all.

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:55.395
This is a multi-year operation to convert the sovereignty of the young people in America and in the Western world to that of a community-oriented communal health model.

01:09:57.216 --> 01:10:09.344
And she can claim all she wants to that, you know, having her feet in, in the sands of Israel and her feet in the, in the sands of Canada makes her some kind of world traveling dissident, but I think she plays for them.

01:10:11.005 --> 01:10:20.972
And that's why she can't meaningfully say anything, you know, like, well, if I compare the vaccine schedule in Israel or Canada to America, it's obvious what they're doing here.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:29.582
If I compare the average health of people in Israel to the average health of people in America and Canada, it's obvious what they're doing here.

01:10:29.962 --> 01:10:38.404
If I, you know, there's lots of things that she could say, but she's hyper focused on the safety data, the VAERS data.

01:10:38.584 --> 01:10:42.245
And the crazy thing is, is that she's going to be focused on that from here on out.

01:10:44.614 --> 01:10:49.635
Even when she spoke in front of the Senate earlier this year, it's VAERS, VAERS, VAERS, I'm the VAERS lady.

01:10:50.055 --> 01:10:55.537
Just like Pierre Cory is the New York City and Ivermectin guy.

01:10:58.398 --> 01:11:03.879
Just like Robert Malone is the, you know, RNA vaccines work great if we don't rush them.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.741
And pandemics are real because I'm an outbreak specialist that started on Ebola and Zika.

01:11:12.608 --> 01:11:17.872
just like Jessica Rose started out as an expert on the AIDS virus for shit's sake.

01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:33.743
These agencies and these organizations and establishments are, they're really not peddling products that are safe for human so-called consumption.

01:11:33.903 --> 01:11:34.444
They're not.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:41.409
Yeah, it's, again, you know, it's just, it's all a part of this,

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:47.920
this whole story that's been one big lie, in my opinion.

01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:49.421
None of it adds up.

01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:50.462
None of it makes sense.

01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:53.824
None of it is in the interest of public health, obviously.

01:11:55.305 --> 01:11:56.926
And yeah, it's not over.

01:11:57.487 --> 01:11:59.208
That's one of the most disturbing.

01:11:59.288 --> 01:12:00.509
What is the big lie?

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.271
Is the one big lie the shot?

01:12:05.972 --> 01:12:09.415
The one big lie is the lie about the product?

01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:13.953
or products that she still can't differentiate between yet?

01:12:15.974 --> 01:12:19.096
Do you see how much, how absolutely malevolent this is?

01:12:19.156 --> 01:12:20.017
Who's she saving?

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:22.498
Who is she helping?

01:12:22.558 --> 01:12:26.881
Who is she getting closer to being able to exercise informed consent?

01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:27.541
No one.

01:12:28.662 --> 01:12:29.242
No one.

01:12:29.602 --> 01:12:30.363
Stop lying.

01:12:30.783 --> 01:12:33.585
It's because she's, she's lying about what the lie is.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:40.701
She's agreeing that the one big lie equals the shot.

01:12:42.702 --> 01:12:44.863
It has nothing to do with the natural virus.

01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:46.264
It has nothing to do with PCR.

01:12:46.364 --> 01:12:48.205
It has nothing to do with sequencing.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.767
It has nothing to do with murder in New York City.

01:12:57.869 --> 01:13:03.892
Once you see them for who they are, once you hear who they're promoting over and over again, you can only hear a network of liars.

01:13:05.322 --> 01:13:06.263
That's why they were there.

01:13:09.766 --> 01:13:15.732
Dr. Peter McCullough, he said that according to one estimate, I forget what the precise number was.

01:13:15.952 --> 01:13:22.499
I think he says it was 160,000 possible vaccine deaths in the U.S.

01:13:22.639 --> 01:13:22.959
alone.

01:13:24.085 --> 01:13:25.427
I've spoken with others.

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:32.596
I'm going to have Steve Kirsch on the show in a couple of days, and he's come up with estimates in that ballpark or possibly even somewhat higher.

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:37.123
Have you tried to crunch numbers and examine the various approaches?

01:13:39.105 --> 01:13:44.430
A number of people have used different signals to argue for different numbers of deaths.

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:50.455
And the US deaths, again, a lot of people have managed to put them in the six figures, usually the low six figures.

01:13:51.856 --> 01:13:55.039
Have you crunched those numbers or looked at some of those estimates?

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.562
Yeah, I actually have a publication.

01:13:58.582 --> 01:14:03.346
It was the second publication I did on VAERS data.

01:14:04.019 --> 01:14:09.602
where it's actually an assessment of the pharmacovigilance-ness of VAERS.

01:14:10.482 --> 01:14:18.506
And in this paper, I do estimate the underreporting factor using Pfizer's phase three clinical trial data that had been released at the time.

01:14:18.526 --> 01:14:19.546
That's right.

01:14:20.607 --> 01:14:22.368
Yeah, I remember seeing that actually, yeah.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:43.791
Yeah, so my underreporting factor was a conservative estimate at 31, which means that you would need to multiply most of the adverse events by a factor of 31, probably not death, even though this was calculated using severe adverse event data for which death is.

01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:52.417
I would say that the underreporting factor for death is lower because it's death more often reported, I would say.

01:14:53.134 --> 01:15:03.678
But in VAERS currently, in the domestic data set in the context of the COVID-19 products alone, we have over 30,000 deaths reported.

01:15:04.198 --> 01:15:19.663
So if we use an under-reporting factor of say, I don't know, let's just go 15, which is half of the lowest estimate that's been calculated, we're at about half a million deaths.

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:31.965
So the number is, we don't even need to account for the underreporting factor here when talking about the appallingness of what we're seeing.

01:15:32.585 --> 01:15:45.589
The numbers in VAERS right now, just the absolute numbers without, like I said, calculating in the underreporting factor are off the charts when you compare them to the last 30 years of data.

01:15:47.182 --> 01:15:48.883
There's no comparison here.

01:15:49.584 --> 01:16:06.895
It's like when I describe what the bar graph looks like, if you tally up all of the adverse event reports for all the vaccines combined for the last 30 years, because VAERS has been on the go for 30 years, you get about 39,000 reports per year.

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:09.277
This is for all the vaccines combined.

01:16:09.337 --> 01:16:13.080
I think there's almost up to 100 now, different kinds.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:22.784
If you compare that to just the adverse event reports in the context of COVID-19 for 2021, we're over a million.

01:16:22.824 --> 01:16:35.831
I mean, it's just insane that anyone would think that nothing is going on here and that it's just a coincidence and that, you know, it looks like a bunch of bungalows over the last 30 years compared to this massive skyscraper.

01:16:35.911 --> 01:16:37.392
That's what the bar graph looks like.

01:16:38.112 --> 01:16:43.139
And it's the same story for any standalone adverse event that you pick.

01:16:43.339 --> 01:16:44.280
You can pick anything.

01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:49.407
You can pick death, you can pick myocarditis, disability, anything you want.

01:16:49.507 --> 01:16:51.189
And it looks like that.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.181
And we're not explaining the biology at all, of course.

01:16:55.261 --> 01:16:56.221
Why would that be?

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.342
What would that be due to?

01:16:58.902 --> 01:17:02.303
She could say that it doesn't stay in the injection site right now.

01:17:02.363 --> 01:17:03.623
We already know why, right?

01:17:03.643 --> 01:17:05.203
But she doesn't say that.

01:17:05.903 --> 01:17:10.444
In 2022, she doesn't say that, even though I was saying it already in 2021.

01:17:10.985 --> 01:17:12.125
And so was Byron Bridle.

01:17:13.466 --> 01:17:18.129
to any remotely credible or thoughtful attempts.

01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:24.273
They said Matt Crawford's name twice and Meryl Nass' name twice, but still haven't said Byron Bridle's name.

01:17:24.694 --> 01:17:26.975
And it's a year after he came out.

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:29.557
You see this?

01:17:31.699 --> 01:17:35.261
To argue back from the other side, I've been looking for them.

01:17:37.228 --> 01:17:44.117
No, no, Steve Kirsch is very good at calling people and getting people's attention.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:46.339
He's a doer.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.921
He is very active.

01:17:49.423 --> 01:17:53.869
And he's been trying for, I'd say it's going on a year now.

01:17:55.191 --> 01:18:06.917
sending emails to like the top, like Walensky and Woodcock and all these people and saying, hey, how about letting us know what the under-reporting factor is if you're saying that ours is wrong?

01:18:07.418 --> 01:18:11.740
How about letting us know how come there's no causality assessment being done here?

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:22.826
How about letting us know, like any of the answers to our questions, what's the cutoff number for the number of deaths to deem the product unsafe?

01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.072
Anything, how many deaths are reported to VAERS right now?

01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:28.712
They can't even answer that, my friend.

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:37.895
There's a video of Walensky, both Walensky and Fauci, not being able to answer the simplest of questions.

01:18:38.655 --> 01:18:40.676
She's the director of the CDC.

01:18:40.776 --> 01:18:43.696
This is the organization that owns this data set.

01:18:44.097 --> 01:18:48.858
She could not answer a simple question, how many reports of death are in VAERS right now?

01:18:50.816 --> 01:18:52.457
Wow, that's crazy.

01:18:52.898 --> 01:19:05.387
I know Dr. McCullough has compared the inefficacy and danger of the vaccines to the apparent efficacy of treatments.

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.969
Have you done work on the treatment issue?

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:10.550
You mean like ivermectin?

01:19:10.771 --> 01:19:14.073
Yeah, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, I guess, are the two big ones.

01:19:15.254 --> 01:19:15.614
Yeah.

01:19:17.924 --> 01:19:20.918
I've talked about them in my presentations.

01:19:22.318 --> 01:19:23.358
to various people.

01:19:23.798 --> 01:19:36.401
So the first one she came up with with ivermectin, just remember the first one that we came up with that I said on my YouTube channel and that Zev Zelenko treated a lot of congressmen with was hydroxychloroquine.

01:19:36.821 --> 01:19:44.963
The reason why Peter McCullough kind of rose to fame was because he was speaking out about hydroxychloroquine not causing hearts to swell up.

01:19:45.443 --> 01:19:48.824
So it's interesting that she starts, first of all, what do you mean, ivermectin?

01:19:50.634 --> 01:20:01.997
Dr. McCullough has compared this apparent inefficacy and danger of the vaccines to the apparent efficacy of treatments.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:04.557
Have you done work on the treatment issue?

01:20:05.857 --> 01:20:07.118
You mean like ivermectin?

01:20:07.358 --> 01:20:10.638
Yeah, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, I guess, are the two big ones.

01:20:14.528 --> 01:20:38.218
I've talked about them in my presentations to various people, just in the context of, hey, there's another solution, but that's, I piggyback off of the FLCCC and peer query, like I'm not really analyzing data per se with regard to the early treatment, so.

01:20:39.764 --> 01:20:44.668
I know that there are many, many, many studies showing efficacy of these products.

01:20:44.808 --> 01:20:59.481
And I also know that ivermectin is, it's an antiparasitic drug that's super, super cheap, that's been on the go for decades, been used without any malefacts, even in pregnant women.

01:21:00.161 --> 01:21:12.395
And has, in fact, been on the going efficacy of these products and I also know that ivermectin is, it's an anti parasitic drug that's super super cheap.

01:21:12.796 --> 01:21:14.418
That's been on the go for decades.

01:21:15.419 --> 01:21:24.710
been used without any malefacts even in pregnant women, and has, in fact, been associated with a Nobel Prize.

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:29.776
I mean it's, it's a, it's an FDA approved drug that's been on the go forever.

01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:34.041
You know repurpose drugs are used all the time.

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:45.570
We use them in an off label way which means that you you've you you use it for a different ailment or disease for example with with success.

01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:53.597
This is not a new thing, but all of a sudden, very very strangely I mean Pierre Corey is the one to talk about this with.

01:21:57.515 --> 01:22:00.857
These poor drugs are being demonized.

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.878
I mean, it's just bizarro world.

01:22:04.459 --> 01:22:10.602
If people understood how strange that was, I think that they would ask a lot more questions.

01:22:11.242 --> 01:22:17.405
It's very strange to us, like how nonsensical it all is.

01:22:20.037 --> 01:22:27.083
Well, I've had this argument with my brother who is... So repurposed drugs, she reviews quite vigorously.

01:22:27.183 --> 01:22:34.289
And that's of course Malone and the Domain Program and Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch are all in on the ivermectin idea.

01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:37.531
And if we could just force people to take it for 30 days, we'd be at zero COVID.

01:22:37.992 --> 01:22:46.058
And then of course, she mentions Pierre Kory, who we've all come to love as one of the greatest characters in this story.

01:22:46.098 --> 01:22:46.458
So that's...

01:22:47.239 --> 01:22:48.560
That's pretty spectacular.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.641
What else do you want me to know?

01:22:52.082 --> 01:22:55.264
You should talk to Pierre because he knows all about this stuff.

01:22:55.664 --> 01:23:03.569
He's an MD, PhD, who has run lots of studies, usually randomized controlled trials.

01:23:04.009 --> 01:23:07.291
And so he says that- Who's that?

01:23:07.872 --> 01:23:14.015
If people understood how strange that was, I think that they would ask a lot more questions.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.197
It's very strange to us.

01:23:17.051 --> 01:23:20.817
like how nonsensical it all is.

01:23:23.433 --> 01:23:34.542
Well, I've had this argument with my brother, who is, he's an MD, PhD, who has run lots of studies, usually randomized controlled trials.

01:23:35.002 --> 01:23:41.748
And so he says that, well, first, he said, Oh, there's no evidence that ivermectin works, or no good evidence.

01:23:41.788 --> 01:23:48.894
And so I sent him, I sent him to that website that has the huge list of studies, the vast majority of which do show.

01:23:48.914 --> 01:23:49.074
Yeah.

01:23:50.675 --> 01:23:50.935
Right.

01:23:51.455 --> 01:23:53.537
And he said, oh, wow, I never saw that.

01:23:53.577 --> 01:23:54.697
So OK, well, there is some evidence.

01:23:54.717 --> 01:24:00.420
He said, however, the good ones, the good randomized controlled trials, don't show efficacy.

01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:03.342
So still, he's not convinced.

01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:05.603
So how do you respond to that?

01:24:05.683 --> 01:24:06.983
I respond to that like this.

01:24:07.003 --> 01:24:12.066
I trust the doctors on the ground who are having success treating COVID patients, OK?

01:24:12.766 --> 01:24:17.809
Paul Merrick and Pierre Cory and, you know,

01:24:19.298 --> 01:24:27.802
Farid and Tyson, they've treated tens of thousands of patients with these things.

01:24:27.982 --> 01:24:29.643
And you know how they did that?

01:24:29.663 --> 01:24:31.203
Do you know what the context was?

01:24:32.244 --> 01:24:34.005
We had an emergency situation.

01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:37.686
We had this potentially deadly virus.

01:24:38.186 --> 01:24:41.748
And so if you're an emergency room doctor, if you're an ICU doctor,

01:24:42.715 --> 01:24:51.463
So I think that one of the reasons why FLCCC was created by Robert Malone and Pierre Corey was to step in front of Paul Merrick.

01:24:52.123 --> 01:24:53.945
So I spelled that wrong.

01:24:56.067 --> 01:25:04.154
But Paul Merrick is a guy who is the vitamin C high dose for sepsis treatment.

01:25:06.963 --> 01:25:12.344
And of course, he was also advocating for DNC for severe COVID.

01:25:12.904 --> 01:25:16.085
And so they had to step in front of this guy, and they did.

01:25:16.785 --> 01:25:18.885
And they stepped in front of him with a protocol.

01:25:19.345 --> 01:25:25.866
The FLCC protocol included a 94% pulse ox recommendation.

01:25:25.906 --> 01:25:28.507
And then if it's lower than that, you should go to the hospital.

01:25:29.727 --> 01:25:34.268
And they also, of course, recommended ivermectin and still do.

01:25:37.711 --> 01:25:42.535
There's place, you know, you can see that Pierre Cory spends a lot of time with Paul Merrick.

01:25:46.658 --> 01:25:49.561
I think Paul is probably just taken by these people.

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:54.024
I believe to try and get into the head of the people who are on the,

01:25:55.703 --> 01:25:58.245
on the front of the line, as we've been calling it.

01:25:58.806 --> 01:26:05.912
They had to come up with a way to prevent their patients from dying or getting to the hospital.

01:26:06.392 --> 01:26:09.775
And so I imagine there was a lot of trial and error.

01:26:10.036 --> 01:26:11.897
There was a lot of critical thinking.

01:26:12.177 --> 01:26:19.764
There was a lot of, I'm going to draw upon my decades of experience as a physician, a lot of amazing independence.

01:26:19.824 --> 01:26:26.826
The reason why the obsession with ivermectin is bizarre is because nobody in America was using it before the pandemic.

01:26:27.006 --> 01:26:34.769
Veterinarians were, but it wasn't being used to prevent river blindness in the deep South or something like that.

01:26:35.569 --> 01:26:44.812
So there was no reason for any American doctor who we can all admit now are not the most informed biologists on the planet, there'd be no reason for them

01:26:45.532 --> 01:26:51.395
to have this on a short list of antivirals that would be appropriate for them to try.

01:26:51.895 --> 01:27:00.940
And there's no reason for anybody at FLCCC to have gone against Paul Merrick's recommendation of just, you know, vitamin D and C and some antibiotics.

01:27:05.462 --> 01:27:14.507
There's also no reason for them to be recommending ivermectin over hydroxychloroquine with such vigor.

01:27:16.348 --> 01:27:17.328
There's just no reason.

01:27:18.809 --> 01:27:33.453
There's more data, quite frankly, on the antiviral properties of hydroxychloroquine than there are on ivermectin, and yet this antiparasitic is assumed to work so well because these people say it does.

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:39.035
She's arguing that they use their experience and gut instinct.

01:27:39.175 --> 01:27:40.696
They don't have any experience with this.

01:27:40.736 --> 01:27:44.017
That would be like saying that the way that they figured out how to make

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:49.932
you know, fine, fine croissants is that they figured it out by trial and error.

01:27:49.952 --> 01:27:53.214
And I trust these guys more than I trust people that are taking the recipe.

01:27:55.516 --> 01:27:56.657
These people are lying.

01:27:56.758 --> 01:27:57.498
She's lying.

01:27:57.558 --> 01:28:03.603
Just like she said that, you know, according to what I've figured out, it's not the opioid crisis or suicide.

01:28:03.643 --> 01:28:04.804
It's something else.

01:28:05.865 --> 01:28:06.666
Stop lying.

01:28:07.707 --> 01:28:08.848
Dependent assessment.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:13.644
And they came up with these protocols from going through these processes.

01:28:14.424 --> 01:28:16.346
So that's what I would trust.

01:28:16.466 --> 01:28:18.068
You mean this protocol?

01:28:18.808 --> 01:28:19.108
That one?

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:25.894
If I had to make a decision for myself or someone that I love who is struggling to breathe, I'm like, take them to those people and let them do it.

01:28:26.075 --> 01:28:27.536
Struggling to breathe.

01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:33.967
Is that the Pierre Cory nod there to the Kyle Seidel nod?

01:28:34.247 --> 01:28:36.247
They're going to do, because I trust them.

01:28:36.407 --> 01:28:40.068
They've been on the ground, boots to the ground, treated the patients.

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:43.489
Nobody's being hospitalized if they go to these people.

01:28:43.689 --> 01:28:46.469
Nobody's being hospitalized if they don't go to the hospital.

01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:52.030
Nobody's being hospitalized if they don't go to the hospital, Jessica, you liar.

01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:55.491
And the other side of that is it ain't going to hurt them.

01:28:56.468 --> 01:29:00.609
It's a completely harmless drug, this ivermectin.

01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:05.891
It has an incredibly impressive- It cures cancer.

01:29:10.193 --> 01:29:11.493
It's a safety profile.

01:29:12.253 --> 01:29:13.254
So there's no harm.

01:29:13.494 --> 01:29:16.295
That's the other point I don't get, like why it's being demonized.

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:17.495
You know what I mean?

01:29:17.555 --> 01:29:19.636
It's like, yeah.

01:29:20.216 --> 01:29:21.717
So that's what I would say.

01:29:23.099 --> 01:29:26.661
I also, I'm skeptical about these randomized controls.

01:29:26.801 --> 01:29:27.662
All the giggling.

01:29:27.822 --> 01:29:33.045
I never found any reason to giggle in any interview I've ever done about this stuff.

01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:38.948
Never once did I find it necessary to flirt or to giggle or to throw my hair.

01:29:38.968 --> 01:29:50.435
And if you watch Jessica Rose's years and hours of interviews, she's, she's giggling and throwing her hair around a lot.

01:29:54.293 --> 01:30:20.035
trials, given that the most celebrated one that supposedly proved that ivermectin didn't work, it turns out that if you actually look at their numbers, as Meryl Nass pointed out on my show weeks ago, it turns out that it was conducted in Brazil among poor people, who apparently a lot of them probably signed up because it was a free source of ivermectin, which they take anyway prophylactically.

01:30:20.655 --> 01:30:32.607
and so anyway they they had divided into two groups they don't describe how they take it prophylactically but they're not taking it daily like brett weinstein said we should do for 30 days to get to zero covid

01:30:34.104 --> 01:30:35.424
supposedly double-binded.

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:49.887
However, it so happened that this huge number, I think it was like 60% or something, of the people in the control group that were getting the placebo didn't comply with the protocols of the trial somehow.

01:30:49.967 --> 01:30:53.428
So it came to the attention of the experiments that these people hadn't complied.

01:30:53.688 --> 01:30:56.849
Like 60% of the control group didn't comply

01:30:57.769 --> 01:31:03.091
and a vastly small version, hardly any of the ivermectin group didn't comply.

01:31:03.471 --> 01:31:05.472
So how can that be double-blinded?

01:31:06.152 --> 01:31:08.653
Welcome to Truth Jihad Audio.

01:31:08.773 --> 01:31:15.475
I'm Kevin Barrett, talking with the folks who have the most to say from way outside the box of mainstream idiocy.

01:31:15.495 --> 01:31:16.336
Sorry about that.

01:31:16.356 --> 01:31:16.816
Yeah, the FCCCT, yeah.

01:31:26.599 --> 01:31:26.839
Right.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.363
And he said, oh, wow, I never saw that.

01:31:29.403 --> 01:31:30.544
So OK, well, there is some evidence.

01:31:30.564 --> 01:31:36.251
He said, however, the good ones, the good randomized controlled trials don't show efficacy.

01:31:37.273 --> 01:31:39.175
So still, he's not convinced.

01:31:39.395 --> 01:31:40.677
So how do you respond to that?

01:31:41.298 --> 01:31:42.799
I respond to that like this.

01:31:43.496 --> 01:31:45.478
So the clinical trials don't matter.

01:31:46.238 --> 01:31:47.579
She responds to it like this.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:56.987
I trust the treating doctors because they've used their instincts and they've used their experience to decide and to settle on ivermectin as the solution.

01:31:57.047 --> 01:31:58.348
That's what she's saying right here.

01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.694
I trust the doctors on the ground who are having success treating COVID patients, okay?

01:32:05.374 --> 01:32:10.499
Paul Merrick and Pierre Cory and, you know,

01:32:11.913 --> 01:32:20.419
Farid and Tyson, they've treated tens of thousands of patients with these things.

01:32:20.579 --> 01:32:22.261
And you know how they did that?

01:32:22.281 --> 01:32:23.802
Do you know what the context was?

01:32:24.843 --> 01:32:26.624
We had an emergency situation.

01:32:26.784 --> 01:32:30.287
We had this potentially deadly virus.

01:32:30.807 --> 01:32:38.713
And so if you're an emergency room doctor, if you're an ICU doctor, people need to try and get into the head of the people who are on the,

01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:42.851
on the front of the line, as we've been calling it.

01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:50.515
They had to come up with a way to prevent their patients from dying or getting to the hospital.

01:32:50.995 --> 01:32:54.377
And so I imagine there was a lot of trial and error.

01:32:54.637 --> 01:32:56.498
There was a lot of critical thinking.

01:32:56.778 --> 01:33:05.402
There was a lot of, I'm going to draw upon my decades of experience as a physician, a lot of amazing independent assessment

01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:10.204
and they came up with these protocols from going through these processes.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:12.966
So that's what I would trust.

01:33:13.566 --> 01:33:24.452
If I was, you know, um, if I had to make a decision for myself or someone that I love who is struggling to breathe, I'm like, take them to those people and let them do what they're gonna do, because I trust them.

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:28.314
They've been on the ground, boots to the ground, treated the patients.

01:33:28.654 --> 01:33:31.715
Nobody's being hospitalized if they go to these people.

01:33:32.396 --> 01:33:34.537
So, and the other side of that is,

01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:36.372
It ain't gonna hurt him.

01:33:37.293 --> 01:33:41.438
It's a completely harmless drug, this ivermectin.

01:33:42.018 --> 01:33:46.803
It has an incredibly impressive safety profile.

01:33:47.564 --> 01:33:48.565
So there's no harm.

01:33:48.805 --> 01:33:51.608
That's the other point I don't get why it's being demonized.

01:33:52.249 --> 01:33:52.809
You know what I mean?

01:33:52.869 --> 01:33:53.210
It's like,

01:33:54.724 --> 01:33:57.086
Yeah, so that's what I would say.

01:33:58.408 --> 01:34:07.517
I also I'm skeptical about these randomized controlled trials, given that the most celebrated one that supposedly proved that ivermectin didn't work.

01:34:08.037 --> 01:34:15.184
It turns out that if you actually look at their numbers, as Merrill Nass pointed out on my show, a couple of weeks ago.

01:34:15.985 --> 01:34:28.012
It turns out that it was conducted in Brazil among poor people, who apparently a lot of them probably signed up because it was a free source of ivermectin, which they take anyway prophylactically.

01:34:28.632 --> 01:34:33.274
And so anyway, they had divided into two groups, supposedly double-blinded.

01:34:33.795 --> 01:34:42.900
However, it so happened that this huge number, I think it was like 60% or something of the people in the control group that were getting the placebo,

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:47.721
didn't comply with the protocols of the trial somehow.

01:34:47.781 --> 01:34:51.263
So it came to the attention of the experiments that they hadn't, that these people hadn't complied.

01:34:51.503 --> 01:35:00.926
Like 60% of the control group didn't comply and a vastly small version, hardly any of the ivermectin group didn't comply.

01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:03.287
So how can that be double-blinded?

01:35:03.687 --> 01:35:10.269
Somebody knew, you know, which group was which, and Merrill thinks probably that the poor people who signed up for free ivermectin

01:35:10.549 --> 01:35:11.810
They tasted their sugar pill.

01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.651
Oh, it's sugar.

01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:13.532
It's not ivermectin.

01:35:13.572 --> 01:35:15.073
And they went out and bought ivermectin anyway.

01:35:15.533 --> 01:35:20.338
And yet this has been touted as the best RCT, proving ivermectin doesn't work.

01:35:20.378 --> 01:35:28.485
If that's the- So Merrill Nass thinks that the reason why the random control trial didn't work is because the people could taste their placebo and went out and bought their own ivermectin.

01:35:29.446 --> 01:35:30.507
Merrill Nass!

01:35:32.288 --> 01:35:33.709
Four times mentioned.

01:35:35.171 --> 01:35:37.633
More times than Matthew Crawford's been mentioned.

01:35:39.778 --> 01:35:47.563
And she's sure that these randomized control trials are being goofed up by these people who are taking ivermectin because they know it already works.

01:35:47.703 --> 01:35:51.926
I would trust these people that are taking, oh my gosh.

01:35:52.006 --> 01:35:52.326
The best.

01:35:52.386 --> 01:35:53.306
I would hate to see the worst.

01:35:54.607 --> 01:35:56.969
Yeah, no, real world experience is the best.

01:35:57.049 --> 01:35:57.989
Thank you very much.

01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:00.511
They can have their randomized control trials.

01:36:01.118 --> 01:36:14.701
You know, it's not that I'm saying that they're not great when we have time and when they're done properly, but, you know, boots to the ground, real life is more valuable.

01:36:15.081 --> 01:36:28.645
And it's especially valuable when you're considering the fact that these people are still telling us that we're in an emergency situation, which we are not, but assuming that- Oh, we're not in an emergency situation.

01:36:29.585 --> 01:36:30.065
Interesting.

01:36:32.591 --> 01:36:33.292
How do you know that?

01:36:33.332 --> 01:36:34.833
Is it because they murdered people?

01:36:35.013 --> 01:36:37.054
Is it because there's no evidence of spread?

01:36:37.535 --> 01:36:41.798
Did you read Denny Rancourt's paper that was published two years before this video?

01:36:42.418 --> 01:36:45.180
Is that why you're saying we're not in an emergency anymore?

01:36:45.941 --> 01:36:54.387
We had been, you know, in the past, in the last year or so, in an emergency situation, which we are not.

01:36:55.427 --> 01:37:01.292
But assuming that we had been... Assuming that we had been... Stop lying!

01:37:02.392 --> 01:37:16.342
Assuming Pierre Corey wasn't lying about what happened in New York City, assuming that Kyle Seidel wasn't lying about the 60 liters a minute of oxygen being applied, then maybe it was just murder, Jess.

01:37:16.922 --> 01:37:26.068
You know, in the past, in the last year or so, you know, the best solution is to all hands on deck, man.

01:37:26.088 --> 01:37:27.990
Let's try everything and see what works.

01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:34.493
Seriously, they didn't take their time rolling these injections into people's arms, did they?

01:37:34.794 --> 01:37:36.634
They skipped all the safety trial.

01:37:36.935 --> 01:37:40.696
They did the shoddiest clinical trials in the world.

01:37:42.157 --> 01:37:47.419
Vaccines are supposed to take five to 15 years to go from conception to arm.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.922
They have to take that long in order to ensure that the products are safe and effective.

01:37:54.921 --> 01:38:00.696
And I mean, we raced through this in a year and a half, two years, the whole thing, the whole shooting match.

01:38:01.317 --> 01:38:02.580
And these are not.

01:38:03.188 --> 01:38:07.270
conventional vaccines, which makes what I just said very frightening.

01:38:07.650 --> 01:38:09.271
And most people don't realize that.

01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:10.591
This is a new platform.

01:38:11.432 --> 01:38:12.652
It's a new delivery system.

01:38:12.772 --> 01:38:13.933
It's not a new platform.

01:38:13.993 --> 01:38:15.534
It's not a new delivery system.

01:38:15.674 --> 01:38:21.657
She's a molecular biologist who almost certainly has used transfection and transformation in her academic work.

01:38:21.697 --> 01:38:24.498
And if she hasn't, then she's just an ignoramus.

01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:34.465
because almost everybody in academic biology and medicine and whatever in academia is using transformation and transfection all the time.

01:38:36.346 --> 01:38:44.771
And I'm getting sick and tired of hearing these people that have so many degrees, they can't even list them all in the beginning of their podcasts.

01:38:46.772 --> 01:38:50.654
And they can't seem to find these fricking words that I taught them already in 2020.

01:38:52.155 --> 01:38:56.037
Lipid nanoparticle tech, and it's a new concept.

01:38:56.874 --> 01:39:14.325
This is modified RNA, which is injected into your body, and it provides the template for your host cells to develop or to translate these modified RNAs, whatever they are, into protein.

01:39:15.446 --> 01:39:21.230
And these are very stable modified mRNAs, as we're seeing in peer-reviewed literature right now.

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:25.733
Up to 60 days, we found this crap in the germinal centers of lymph nodes.

01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:32.433
So they're in the germinal centers of lymph nodes.

01:39:32.473 --> 01:39:34.815
We should not have transfected lymph nodes.

01:39:34.875 --> 01:39:36.296
That would not be a good idea.

01:39:36.796 --> 01:39:44.462
And any immunologist would know how absolutely ridiculous it would be to transfect the lymph nodes.

01:39:48.806 --> 01:39:50.047
Do you see what I'm saying here?

01:39:51.971 --> 01:40:06.175
You're transfecting the lymph nodes so that, what, naive, dormant immune cells might start expressing foreign proteins so that maybe your immune system would have to clean out the expressing cells in the lymph nodes?

01:40:06.955 --> 01:40:13.817
And you're an immunologist and you can't say why that's particularly bad and we're an hour into this discussion?

01:40:16.818 --> 01:40:17.518
Stop lying!

01:40:20.506 --> 01:40:21.267
It's just gross.

01:40:21.487 --> 01:40:26.512
Or to translate these modified RNAs, whatever they are, into protein.

01:40:27.613 --> 01:40:33.378
And these are very stable modified mRNAs, as we're seeing in peer-reviewed literature right now.

01:40:33.759 --> 01:40:37.903
Up to 60 days, we found this crap in the germinal centers of lymph nodes.

01:40:41.458 --> 01:40:49.045
Yeah, what about the evidence that there is uptake into the DNA that it actually is altering DNA?

01:40:49.085 --> 01:40:53.229
For a long time, that was totally being debunked by the so called fact checkers.

01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:58.835
But then apparently, some studies came in showing that well, actually, it looks like there is some some uptake.

01:40:59.015 --> 01:41:03.039
So in April of 2020, now we're talking about DNA

01:41:10.799 --> 01:41:19.882
talking about DNA integration now, which is again, a subject that didn't really come up until 23 with McKernan.

01:41:22.103 --> 01:41:25.904
But it came up earlier, of course, in these weird places.

01:41:25.964 --> 01:41:27.645
And so that's what he's talking about now.

01:41:28.365 --> 01:41:39.709
DNA integration was eventually demonstrated using transfected cultures of the spike protein and then showing that they could find the spike protein DNA in the

01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:42.292
in the chromosomes of those cell cultures.

01:41:42.312 --> 01:41:44.934
Supposedly, McKernan and other labs have done that already.

01:41:44.974 --> 01:41:54.022
But again, this is in 2022, and we have that data being shown or claimed in front of the Senate in 2024, so two years later.

01:41:54.643 --> 01:41:58.426
Again, what I want you to see is that they've been running out the clock.

01:41:59.207 --> 01:42:02.370
It's been a, it's been a running out the clock thing.

01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:11.178
There's no reason why in 2021, we couldn't have been all the way to the finish line and saying the transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always dumb.

01:42:11.659 --> 01:42:13.180
And we need to put these people in jail.

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.902
We could have been there in 2021.

01:42:15.523 --> 01:42:20.447
Right when we took the Janssen shot off, we could have taken the RNA shot off all for the same reasons.

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:24.291
But these people have been running out the clock.

01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:32.054
What do we make of that?

01:42:32.735 --> 01:42:34.795
Yeah, so there's a new study.

01:42:34.895 --> 01:42:35.875
Thank you for saying that.

01:42:35.915 --> 01:42:43.078
The integration has only been shown in the microbiome, and so that's not really showing anything, especially when they digest the whole sample.

01:42:43.118 --> 01:42:43.638
So good one.

01:42:45.358 --> 01:42:47.099
Which is not in the preprint servers.

01:42:47.179 --> 01:42:48.059
It's peer-reviewed.

01:42:48.099 --> 01:42:49.139
It is published.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.400
That shows definitively.

01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:57.702
I've been up and down this paper a few times, and they did really good work, really good controls.

01:42:58.502 --> 01:43:04.310
And it shows definitively that reverse transcription occurs, which means that wasn't meant to happen.

01:43:05.252 --> 01:43:09.237
It wasn't meant to be possible for this RNA to go back to DNA.

01:43:10.205 --> 01:43:14.906
And the problem- Actually, reverse transcription means that there's an AIDS virus present.

01:43:15.466 --> 01:43:17.687
Maybe you should call David Baltimore.

01:43:17.727 --> 01:43:30.131
But of course, since you did your master's thesis on the dynamics of HIV virus, you should already know that the standard way of identifying whether HIV is present in a culture is to look for reverse transcriptase activity.

01:43:33.331 --> 01:43:38.273
Problem with that is

01:43:39.336 --> 01:43:40.996
We don't know for sure yet.

01:43:41.457 --> 01:43:48.558
We have strong evidence that it can happen with SARS, that this DNA can be incorporated into our genome.

01:43:49.298 --> 01:43:51.459
But that's precisely the problem.

01:43:51.699 --> 01:43:57.000
We were actually told that this was an impossibility, that it could reverse transcribe.

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.101
We were told there is zero possibility.

01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:00.781
We were mocked.

01:44:01.414 --> 01:44:07.139
for even raising concerns that that might be a possibility that integration may occur.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.421
We have yet to prove it.

01:44:08.441 --> 01:44:23.194
Well, the reason why it's so stupid is because you just got through telling us that the mRNA is found in the lymph nodes for 60 days, yet didn't bother to tell us that that's an extremely bad thing because, you know, autoimmunity is a real big problem.

01:44:23.875 --> 01:44:25.016
And I'm an immunologist.

01:44:28.277 --> 01:44:40.541
Instead, we're talking about DNA integration, which is like four or five bad outcomes down the line, and is only really bad if it integrates in certain cells that are dividing.

01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:41.862
And otherwise, does it really matter?

01:44:41.882 --> 01:44:42.382
We don't know.

01:44:43.814 --> 01:45:02.490
But focusing on that, instead of focusing on the primary observation, which is the transfection goes all over the body and therefore is likely to trigger autoimmunity anywhere it goes, is something that this immunologist, computational biologist, fraudulent traitor hasn't been able to say in four fricking years.

01:45:03.942 --> 01:45:07.203
that, but I dare say that paper is being written right now.

01:45:08.783 --> 01:45:26.127
We were also told that the product, whatever is in the needle, was going to remain at the injection site and the local draining lymph node close to the injection site.

01:45:26.407 --> 01:45:28.688
The local draining lymph node is not acceptable.

01:45:30.214 --> 01:45:36.980
staying at the injection site and draining to the local lymph node is not acceptable for these lipid nanoparticles.

01:45:38.321 --> 01:45:39.402
You dumb ass.

01:45:40.703 --> 01:45:45.107
You incredibly unsophisticated biologist liar.

01:45:45.767 --> 01:45:53.774
You cannot have lipid nanoparticles with a modified RNA go to the lymph node and have everything be okay.

01:45:54.174 --> 01:45:55.315
You freaking liar.

01:45:55.335 --> 01:45:58.078
And it's very, very clear

01:45:58.854 --> 01:46:06.582
from the recent Pfizer dump that it absolutely doesn't stay at the injection site.

01:46:06.762 --> 01:46:10.166
It biodistributes into places where it should never go.

01:46:10.626 --> 01:46:19.736
Because we have- Well, the lipid nanoparticle going there without the RNA is not very likely, but if it does go there, it could still be highly toxic to those lymph node cells.

01:46:20.578 --> 01:46:36.124
Because again, once the pH inside of the lipid nanoparticle changes, the lipid, the cationic lipids become incredibly toxic, which is a very easy thing to explain and Christine Grace spends a whole hour not explaining it every time she talks.

01:46:38.385 --> 01:46:41.286
You don't need an hour to explain that the pH

01:46:42.122 --> 01:46:54.185
changes as an LNP is absorbed into a cell, and that pH changes the chemistry and the toxicity of the lipid nanoparticle carrier by orders of magnitude.

01:46:54.365 --> 01:46:54.906
There, I'm done.

01:46:54.946 --> 01:46:55.686
I explained it all.

01:46:56.106 --> 01:47:03.008
Lipid nanoparticles are toxic, and they lie to us about it because they lie to us about what happens or doesn't happen inside of our body.

01:47:04.744 --> 01:47:06.505
See, I don't need an hour to explain it.

01:47:07.386 --> 01:47:16.171
Lipid nanoparticles and cationic lipids are really toxic once they get divorced from the peg and once they get exposed to intracellular pH.

01:47:16.612 --> 01:47:17.572
You liars.

01:47:18.533 --> 01:47:22.175
No idea what the physiological effects are going to be.

01:47:22.855 --> 01:47:29.720
The ovaries, the testes, the brain, the adrenal glands, the liver, the spleen.

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:31.221
I mean, it's everywhere.

01:47:32.273 --> 01:47:35.175
And so we're talking about the lipid nanoparticles right now.

01:47:35.296 --> 01:47:45.564
So these guys are comprised of four different fats, four different lipids, one of which is called a cationic lipid, which is highly toxic to cells by nature.

01:47:45.724 --> 01:47:47.666
And so is the polyethylene glycol.

01:47:47.726 --> 01:47:49.908
But not until it gets to the right pH.

01:47:49.988 --> 01:47:53.430
So again, not specific enough, not accurate enough.

01:47:53.971 --> 01:48:00.356
And this is in 2022, when she's supposedly been working on this full time between surfing and COVID.

01:48:00.476 --> 01:48:00.897
The peg.

01:48:01.437 --> 01:48:05.978
which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle.

01:48:06.679 --> 01:48:15.201
So these guys are heavily biodistributed, they go everywhere, they slip into cells, and they deliver their payload, which is this modified RNA.

01:48:15.741 --> 01:48:28.285
So we have to assume that the host cells are going to start producing the proteins that are the byproduct of this modified mRNA, whatever it is.

01:48:29.395 --> 01:48:37.078
And so we're- There will be no Byram Bridle nod because she is on Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone's team.

01:48:37.118 --> 01:48:48.021
And Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone went on Brett Weinstein's podcast in June of 2021, specifically to step in front of Byram Bridle on social media.

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.942
And they have stood in front of him ever since.

01:48:51.503 --> 01:48:58.405
We're going to get massive amounts of these foreign proteins being produced in locations where it should never occur.

01:48:59.392 --> 01:49:03.897
And we have no idea what the effect of that would be.

01:49:03.917 --> 01:49:07.320
Autoimmunity, Jessica, you are a fricking immunologist.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.843
Autoimmunity, Jessica, duh!

01:49:10.323 --> 01:49:14.748
All we know is that we see a lot of leaves rustling in the wind.

01:49:15.228 --> 01:49:18.131
In the, in the, in the... She doesn't want to say it.

01:49:18.959 --> 01:49:21.062
She's not interested in saving anyone.

01:49:21.222 --> 01:49:24.786
It is a slow roll titration.

01:49:25.467 --> 01:49:27.309
They are slow rolling the truth.

01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:33.817
You could say it very succinctly, but they don't because they are working against us.

01:49:34.438 --> 01:49:36.080
World of adverse event reports.

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.142
So you, everybody's heard.

01:49:39.222 --> 01:49:46.684
their mother, their sister, their daughter, their friend, somebody they know has had some kind of menstrual dysregularity.

01:49:47.144 --> 01:49:54.267
If they've either had the injections or interestingly enough, been in proximity to someone who has.

01:49:55.747 --> 01:50:03.710
We're seeing, yeah, we're seeing fertility issues in the form of miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths.

01:50:05.959 --> 01:50:13.300
Yeah, we're seeing enormous effects in terms of the adverse event reports now.

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:21.602
When you compare them to the past 30 years, it's just not the same story at all.

01:50:21.742 --> 01:50:23.462
Something's going on here.

01:50:24.162 --> 01:50:30.743
So in my opinion, I mean, maybe they're not related, but we have to find out.

01:50:31.163 --> 01:50:34.444
So something different is happening here and it isn't that,

01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:42.670
It is something different, meaning that the previous vaccines weren't as dangerous as this one, that the previous vaccine schedule's fine.

01:50:45.111 --> 01:51:03.315
And she should be sophisticated enough as a dissident immunologist to know that one of the best ways to wake Americans up would be to point out how shitty their vaccine schedule is, how early it is, how often it is, and for what it is, how many of them are required versus comparing them to any of the other countries, I don't know, that she surfs in.

01:51:08.523 --> 01:51:10.304
if they aren't or if they are.

01:51:10.704 --> 01:51:17.868
And the onus is on these people pushing this crap into us to prove that they're safe.

01:51:18.468 --> 01:51:20.889
It's not up to us to prove that they're not.

01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:25.632
We're doing this because we care, but it's not our duty.

01:51:25.692 --> 01:51:27.633
It's their duty to prove that they're safe.

01:51:28.153 --> 01:51:37.438
And if they're not even willing to acknowledge that, you know, this happened even though you said it wouldn't and we're seeing this effect,

01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:53.954
Or, you know, shouldn't you acknowledge that first and investigate like the possibility that maybe we're seeing an increase in stillbirths because, you know, there's massive amounts of spike protein being produced in the ovaries like.

01:51:54.952 --> 01:51:56.314
shouldn't we find out?

01:51:58.296 --> 01:51:58.636
Yeah.

01:51:59.518 --> 01:52:13.654
It does make you wonder and of course I don't think you have to be a professional conspiracy theorist like me to wonder whether the fact that we're seeing all of these signals relating to the reproductive system

01:52:14.455 --> 01:52:30.622
might possibly be related to the fact that we have Malthusians in high places Bill Gates is one of the many wealthy oligarchs out there who whole Rockefeller family and all of their friends, of course, have been on this for a long time.

01:52:31.142 --> 01:52:39.145
But in its course, it's not just these oligarchs who might think that the human population of Earth is way too high.

01:52:39.225 --> 01:52:40.165
It's unsustainable.

01:52:40.385 --> 01:52:41.325
It has to go down.

01:52:42.105 --> 01:52:43.966
What would be a kind and gentle way to do this?

01:52:44.346 --> 01:52:56.110
Well, if we could either release a disease or put out mandatory injections, either one of which, or perhaps both, tended to reduce fertility,

01:52:56.710 --> 01:53:02.431
then that might contribute towards helping solve this Malthusian problem.

01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:11.833
And to me, that's not a stupid conspiracy theory just because, I mean, these oligarchs actually have a good reason to worry about the size of the population.

01:53:11.913 --> 01:53:13.513
One can project oneself into their shoes.

01:53:13.573 --> 01:53:20.694
Imagine that one is a somewhat sociopathic oligarch and used to solving problems in a pretty brute force way.

01:53:20.714 --> 01:53:24.915
I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder whether that could conceivably be

01:53:25.695 --> 01:53:31.337
related to this bizarre phenomenon of putting out this experimental gene therapy.

01:53:31.377 --> 01:53:36.418
And so what they- Is neither safe nor effective, but seems to do something.

01:53:36.538 --> 01:53:40.739
What they really want you to think is that depopulation might be the agenda.

01:53:40.799 --> 01:53:44.580
It couldn't possibly be the inversion of sovereignty.

01:53:51.302 --> 01:53:54.683
It couldn't possibly be experimental testing.

01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:04.871
It couldn't possibly be genetic characterization.

01:54:09.753 --> 01:54:11.073
It can't be any of these things.

01:54:11.153 --> 01:54:12.734
It's just depopulation.

01:54:12.794 --> 01:54:13.594
This is what it is.

01:54:13.654 --> 01:54:14.875
It's gotta be depopulation.

01:54:14.915 --> 01:54:18.676
It can't possibly be an inversion of sovereignty.

01:54:18.716 --> 01:54:25.439
It can't possibly be a conversion from a sovereign being and individuals to experimental animals.

01:54:27.017 --> 01:54:36.484
It can't be the desire to genetically characterize everyone that's alive before we lose them or the next generation before we lose them and then depopulate.

01:54:37.685 --> 01:54:50.375
It couldn't at all have some nuance where we actually talk about that Kissinger himself said that once we get people to accept mandatory vaccination, then we can depopulate the earth whenever we want to.

01:54:52.537 --> 01:54:56.079
And so they're not talking about the fact that they would murder

01:54:58.922 --> 01:54:59.383
people.

01:55:01.865 --> 01:55:05.129
And they're not saying it's murder, they're saying depopulation.

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:08.793
Maybe they have a good reason to do it, if they're a little bit sociopathic.

01:55:10.334 --> 01:55:12.677
Maybe they have a good reason to do it if the models say it.

01:55:14.218 --> 01:55:18.403
Maybe they have a good reason to do it because they calculated it or used AI to know.

01:55:20.666 --> 01:55:26.631
Sounds to me like he's down with it as long as they've got the right attitude or the right numbers to back up what they're doing.

01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:44.589
Yeah, I, you know, I don't know if they're trying to do that could very well be I mean, there's not much that surprises me anymore after witnessing the last year.

01:55:46.511 --> 01:55:54.298
But yeah, I would say that they they're not smart enough to have anticipated this effect, I think that this is just about being careless.

01:55:54.958 --> 01:55:57.660
and it might just be a byproduct of that carelessness.

01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.641
Carelessness?

01:55:58.721 --> 01:56:00.002
There's no plan here.

01:56:00.662 --> 01:56:04.985
I'm just trying to solve the mystery of the Scooby-Doo and the VEARS data.

01:56:05.605 --> 01:56:07.747
There's no, there's no plan here.

01:56:08.207 --> 01:56:11.349
I'm not being paid to manipulate the opinion of people.

01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:31.639
i'm not being paid to manipulate the conscious and intelligent thoughts of people in america i'm not being paid to do that no no no i don't know i'm just i'm as confused as you are i'm just like i'm just like peter uh jordan peterson i got no idea i'm in a psychological disarray just like everybody else

01:56:33.777 --> 01:56:45.721
Yeah, that's what Ron Unz thinks too about his data or his evidence that seems to point to COVID emerging out of a presumably a U.S.

01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:49.762
biowar strike on Wuhan in October.

01:56:50.343 --> 01:56:51.343
Biowar strike.

01:56:51.363 --> 01:56:51.343
2019.

01:56:51.383 --> 01:56:51.563
October 2019.

01:56:51.603 --> 01:56:52.243
A biowarfare strike.

01:57:04.497 --> 01:57:10.981
Well, that's an interesting theory to throw out there that October, 2019, that's interesting.

01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:12.482
That would be what?

01:57:13.302 --> 01:57:15.704
The Wuhan Games.

01:57:16.064 --> 01:57:16.885
Stop lying.

01:57:17.565 --> 01:57:21.468
It's got like all the talking points.

01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:31.194
And then the fact that it next emerged in Qom, Iran, seemingly specifically targeting high up people in Iran also adds to that thesis.

01:57:32.114 --> 01:57:59.429
but he so he argues that it likely would have been blowback that is these people aren't smart enough not to figure out that you shouldn't be uh hitting adversary economies with biological weapons because it might blow back and hurt your own economy even worse oh hilarious they released the clone and the clone came back and bit us in the ass stop lying that is hilarious uh so there are these you know there's the

01:58:01.929 --> 01:58:05.731
the theory that it's all a combination of coincidence and incompetence.

01:58:06.571 --> 01:58:07.292
And who knows?

01:58:07.372 --> 01:58:09.313
I mean, we'll perhaps, maybe we'll never know for sure.

01:58:09.333 --> 01:58:11.614
Of course, we'll never know.

01:58:11.634 --> 01:58:16.356
Have you looked at the research about the possible biowar origins of COVID?

01:58:17.677 --> 01:58:17.837
No.

01:58:19.204 --> 01:58:41.386
okay well I urge you to she's supposed to focus on bears she's being paid to focus on bears she's being paid to focus on bears like a razor blade she is being paid to focus on bears no yeah no I I kind of try and keep that to my like uh you know the um

01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.081
What would I call that?

01:58:44.181 --> 01:58:56.886
I don't really have free time, but like, I try and separate- I'm doing so much nowadays, you know, I got the family and I got the surfing and I got the career and I got the- Stop lying!

01:58:57.366 --> 01:59:03.688
Great, the thing that I'm doing related to this COVID nightmare from all the other stuff.

01:59:04.049 --> 01:59:05.709
I know it's very difficult to do that.

01:59:06.209 --> 01:59:09.171
And I do have opinions, but yeah, I don't know.

01:59:11.193 --> 01:59:28.272
I think the bottom line is I want to save my energy and my bandwidth for the really important stuff, which is, well, first of all, stopping things like this nightmare idiotic who treaty that they're... Yeah, yeah, talk about that.

01:59:29.693 --> 01:59:42.787
Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know if people know about this, but this is happening today and we had five days notice, which the only reason I know about that is because of our, you know, inside groups who are

01:59:44.001 --> 01:59:45.923
getting the information from the inside.

01:59:45.943 --> 01:59:59.291
They're just planning on passing this insanity treaty, which basically means that all the countries that sign up, it's like a hundred and something something, I don't remember the exact number, will give up their sovereignty.

01:59:59.411 --> 02:00:05.035
And no matter what the hell they decide to do, you will have to abide.

02:00:05.055 --> 02:00:10.099
You will have to believe them, that there's some kind of new emergency,

02:00:10.999 --> 02:00:21.142
they'll have these new measures, they'll lock you up, they'll inject you, they'll do whatever the hell they want to you and there's nothing we're going to be able to do about it because we won't have personal sovereignty.

02:00:22.022 --> 02:00:23.203
So is that an announcement?

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:28.204
She's telling us that the who is going to take away our personal sovereignty and then we're not going to have any choice.

02:00:28.284 --> 02:00:31.125
She's telling us that just like Meryl Nass tells us that.

02:00:32.466 --> 02:00:36.047
Just like Robert Malone tells us that maybe it's, you know, better that we just

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:42.798
throw away the thousand years of previous experience and organize humankind in a different way.

02:00:42.998 --> 02:00:47.841
Maybe what we thought was in existence before the pandemic was never there in the first place.

02:00:48.101 --> 02:00:52.683
We won't have national sovereignty, we won't have anything if this goes ahead.

02:00:52.743 --> 02:01:00.146
So it's like, these are the kinds of things, and I know they're all related, I really do, but focusing on

02:01:02.146 --> 02:01:16.329
the real ways that we can try and stop that kind of nonsense from happening, which is finding out about it, first of all, and using, you know, the methods that we've always used, which is the voices and the power of the people.

02:01:17.029 --> 02:01:21.390
So one of the things that I did, I mean, it's stupid and it's small, but it's something.

02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:29.231
I mean, I used my Substack platform to just, you know, say, hey, you guys, you need to send

02:01:29.969 --> 02:01:31.750
a message to these people.

02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:42.253
Here's the website, go to this site, write your message send it to them because we need to let them know that this is not okay with us as a global population, we don't want this shit.

02:01:42.653 --> 02:01:49.835
We don't want you to take over our sovereignty, we don't, we don't need you, we don't need big brother, we don't.

02:01:52.318 --> 02:01:54.899
Yeah, I went on a little rant there, but.

02:01:55.159 --> 02:01:57.520
President Trump just pulled us out of the WHO.

02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:59.101
That simply stopped funding it.

02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:01.641
I don't think he actually took us out of the WHO treaty.

02:02:02.422 --> 02:02:03.382
And that's what we need to do.

02:02:03.422 --> 02:02:09.985
We need to get out of the WHO treaty, out of the, which means getting out of the UN, which is a lot harder for people to say.

02:02:10.385 --> 02:02:15.207
And in fact, I would argue that Jessica Rose saying the WHO is protecting the UN.

02:02:15.247 --> 02:02:19.048
And I think we should just get rid of, get out of the UN and that gets us out of the WHO as well.

02:02:19.448 --> 02:02:21.489
And so I think that that's a very,

02:02:23.214 --> 02:02:31.039
very purposeful focus, focusing on the who, but it's a subsidiary of the UN.

02:02:31.279 --> 02:02:33.440
We should have left the UN years ago, indeed.

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.182
Nightmare we have coming toward us.

02:02:36.362 --> 02:02:39.644
And most people have no idea.

02:02:40.744 --> 02:02:41.765
You know, it's hidden.

02:02:41.965 --> 02:02:43.146
It's completely hidden.

02:02:43.166 --> 02:02:47.828
Yeah, it's partly hidden under the propaganda.

02:02:49.423 --> 02:03:13.463
having been studying this kind of hysterical mode of fear propaganda since a little bit after 9-11, and then noticed that a similar approach was taken with COVID, that is just hitting the whole population with this wall-to-wall fear propaganda, and then manipulating the population to do completely insane things en masse,

02:03:14.724 --> 02:03:39.805
And now it's odd that just as the pushback was starting to peak with Canadian truckers, and then American truckers following Canadian truckers, and larger rallies, and more and more awareness, and the vaccines seem to hit a brick wall, and then suddenly, overnight, the pandemic is forgotten, taking wind out of the sails of the pushback movement, and suddenly we're all supposed to fear and hate Russia.

02:03:40.965 --> 02:03:56.111
And once again, the population seems to actually have been herded so that now about three quarters of the people do fear and hate Russia, just as the same three quarters of the people feared COVID and reacted to 9-11 in the way that the controlled demolition people wanted them to.

02:03:56.491 --> 02:04:04.914
So it sure seems that the- He's just said that the controlled demolition people were a fake on 9-11.

02:04:04.954 --> 02:04:06.455
He's implying there's no planes.

02:04:06.515 --> 02:04:07.555
That's pretty impressive.

02:04:07.595 --> 02:04:08.376
I wonder if she's gonna,

02:04:09.156 --> 02:04:10.616
She's going to address that at all.

02:04:11.016 --> 02:04:16.858
The public relations mind control machinery is trying to stay one step ahead of us.

02:04:16.878 --> 02:04:19.258
Do you have any ideas how we can try to get a step ahead of them?

02:04:20.059 --> 02:04:22.359
Yeah, stop listening to their garbage.

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.260
But she's their garbage.

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.321
But Robert Malone is their garbage.

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.081
But Matt Crawford is their garbage.

02:04:32.002 --> 02:04:33.762
But Meryl Nass is their garbage.

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.461
You see the problem?

02:04:37.121 --> 02:04:41.986
Robert Malone says you're never gonna figure out who Fifth Generation Warfare is, but I'm telling you, we figured it out.

02:04:42.026 --> 02:04:42.386
It's him.

02:04:43.347 --> 02:04:44.268
It's Jessica Rose.

02:04:45.369 --> 02:04:47.270
It's Peter McCullough.

02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:48.551
It's Pierre Corey.

02:04:48.691 --> 02:04:49.772
It's Matt Crawford.

02:04:49.872 --> 02:04:50.873
It's Meryl Nass.

02:04:52.215 --> 02:04:55.337
All the people that were mentioned here are part of this show.

02:04:56.718 --> 02:05:01.723
And I think they're all basically coordinated underneath Robert Malone, DITRA, DOD man.

02:05:02.225 --> 02:05:07.789
I don't know how to do that, because I mean, I can't even get my family members.

02:05:07.949 --> 02:05:15.794
I think the Department of Justice, or sorry, the Department of Defense probably killed some people early on and murdered people and lied about it.

02:05:15.854 --> 02:05:20.857
And then the rest of the role that the Department of Defense has to play is this.

02:05:22.258 --> 02:05:26.181
And they probably used members of NATO and Five Eyes countries to do it.

02:05:27.216 --> 02:05:34.124
And that's why Robert Malone is so often coordinating with people from the UK or Australia or Canada.

02:05:35.265 --> 02:05:40.130
That's why Jay Bhattacharya started a blog with a Canadian kid.

02:05:40.931 --> 02:05:46.497
That's why Alina Chan, a Canadian girl, was given a job at the Broad Institute.

02:05:47.639 --> 02:05:48.019
That's why.

02:05:49.983 --> 02:05:52.444
It's cooperating with Five Eyes people.

02:05:52.504 --> 02:06:00.568
That's why Jiki Leaks is not able to get over Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci and Ralph Baric.

02:06:01.772 --> 02:06:02.793
He can't get over them.

02:06:02.893 --> 02:06:07.215
He can't admit that Robert Malone is definitely on the same team as them.

02:06:07.255 --> 02:06:10.157
He can't admit that Pierre Kory is on the same team as them.

02:06:10.677 --> 02:06:24.064
That, obviously, Jessica Rose and Peter McCullough are on the same team as all of them, and that's why Pierre Kory and Peter McCullough are the two guys that had to go to Australia and testify about what happened in America.

02:06:26.165 --> 02:06:27.746
Jiki Leaks is on their team.

02:06:27.806 --> 02:06:30.448
Jiki Leaks pretends to oppose Panda.

02:06:32.179 --> 02:06:38.900
He's on the same team as Nick and Jason and Jonathan and Neil.

02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:39.701
It's all the same.

02:06:43.561 --> 02:06:52.323
Shoot, his fake substack name is probably just like Master Teacher Brother or something.

02:06:53.403 --> 02:06:56.284
Ahmed Khaled Syed Seyed, whatever the hell it is.

02:06:56.764 --> 02:06:57.904
Archmedic by ass.

02:06:58.924 --> 02:06:59.325
Traitors.

02:07:00.125 --> 02:07:01.125
All of them are traitors.

02:07:02.391 --> 02:07:07.975
You know, not that I've seen them for like a decade, but I couldn't even get them to turn off the TV.

02:07:08.195 --> 02:07:10.857
It's like, no, no, it's a part of our story.

02:07:10.977 --> 02:07:13.399
She hasn't seen her family in a decade.

02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:21.646
Her family won't listen to her, but she goes between Israel and Canada regularly through the pandemic to surf.

02:07:22.607 --> 02:07:25.329
But I guess she's just dealing with friends, not family, huh?

02:07:28.742 --> 02:07:29.322
schedule.

02:07:29.382 --> 02:07:37.064
And, you know, it gives people a feeling of weird safety and warmth, but it's like, dudes, you got to find another way to get safe and warm.

02:07:37.164 --> 02:07:37.904
Cause that ain't it.

02:07:40.705 --> 02:07:41.545
Safety and numbers.

02:07:41.625 --> 02:07:41.885
Yeah.

02:07:42.105 --> 02:07:43.425
It's inexplicable to me.

02:07:43.485 --> 02:07:44.765
It's like, no, no, no, no.

02:07:44.805 --> 02:07:47.206
You, you have to turn off the television.

02:07:47.606 --> 02:07:49.466
You have to get rid of your stupid phone.

02:07:50.167 --> 02:07:56.048
You know, maybe that's a little bit too much to ask for most people, but I mean, these are the ways out of this.

02:07:56.288 --> 02:07:56.508
I mean,

02:07:57.458 --> 02:08:07.247
We have to detach from these things that don't matter, that have no meaning and reconnect with the things that do, which is each other and the earth.

02:08:07.587 --> 02:08:09.709
It's just, it's that simple.

02:08:10.409 --> 02:08:13.372
You know, turn off the goddamn TV and go outside.

02:08:14.173 --> 02:08:16.395
Why not throw in some blasphemy there, right?

02:08:16.475 --> 02:08:21.239
Why not just throw in some blasphemy and go outside and connect with the earth?

02:08:21.579 --> 02:08:22.260
Don't pray.

02:08:24.178 --> 02:08:25.179
Don't connect with God.

02:08:25.799 --> 02:08:26.800
Don't get spiritual.

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:28.281
Go connect with the Earth.

02:08:28.501 --> 02:08:33.145
Sounds a lot like, I don't know, Russell Brand before he converted to Christianity last month.

02:08:34.215 --> 02:08:36.136
All right, well, that's a good place to leave it.

02:08:36.536 --> 02:08:39.138
Thank you so much, Dr. Jessica Rose.

02:08:40.619 --> 02:08:49.243
Quite impressive and inspiring, both with your numbers-crunching scientific work and also your inspirational rants.

02:08:49.564 --> 02:08:56.047
I hope I can get you back on the show for more rants and more scientific parsing in the future.

02:08:56.067 --> 02:08:58.489
So thank you, God bless, and keep up the great work.

02:08:58.509 --> 02:08:59.409
God bless you.

02:08:59.449 --> 02:09:00.450
Yeah, I'd love to come back.

02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.990
Thank you.

02:09:01.530 --> 02:09:02.591
OK, take care.

02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.429
Bye.

02:09:12.573 --> 02:09:14.294
I'm not even really sure what to say anymore.

02:09:14.314 --> 02:09:17.576
I'm not even really sure how to process this.

02:09:19.397 --> 02:09:27.442
But she definitely was sure that it's not opioids and it wasn't suicide because the research that she did indicates that it's something else.

02:09:30.706 --> 02:09:37.851
Now, if Jessica Rose is a good guy and just doing her best and making mistakes, then she needs to admit it and she needs to say it.

02:09:38.011 --> 02:09:59.947
Just like if Denny Rancor is really a good guy and he means to promote the right people, then he needs to force these people that promote him, like Robert Malone and the rest of them, he needs to force them to say exactly what Mike Eden has said.

02:10:00.939 --> 02:10:11.769
and focus on the observation that there was no excess all-cause mortality prior to the WHO declaration, that there's no all-cause mortality increase until the WHO declaration.

02:10:11.869 --> 02:10:22.558
That needs to be front and center and not the 17 million people killed by the shot that they started yelling from the rooftops after they met you in Romania.

02:10:22.938 --> 02:10:24.680
You gotta do better than this, Denny.

02:10:31.357 --> 02:10:37.300
You gotta force them to admit that they are pointing to the start of the pandemic as evidence of a pandemic.

02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.402
And you have the data that shows that that's a lie.

02:10:40.462 --> 02:10:42.563
You have the data that shows it was murder.

02:10:43.044 --> 02:10:50.948
And that means that these people are essentially lying about you and lying about your data by not admitting that your data shows that.

02:10:52.329 --> 02:10:54.330
Do better, Denny Rancor.

02:10:56.089 --> 02:11:03.076
because otherwise you are part of this illusion of consensus and you are helping them with your inaction by sustaining it.

02:11:06.476 --> 02:11:08.197
And we know these people came out early.

02:11:08.237 --> 02:11:08.918
We know they did.

02:11:08.958 --> 02:11:12.261
They all came out early saying some shit, but not all the shit.

02:11:12.661 --> 02:11:19.787
They know about Alina Chan, the Canadian that's now part of the Whitehead Institute at MIT, or the Broad Institute.

02:11:20.427 --> 02:11:26.452
You know, the Human Genome Project place where the former boss of Kevin McKernan still works, Matt Lander.

02:11:27.173 --> 02:11:28.474
Yeah, she works for him now.

02:11:31.215 --> 02:11:53.613
And yes, Kevin McCairn, the guy who was just recently promoted in March on Life Science Site News, along with Kevin McKernan, two years before that was actually on a stream together with Mark Bailey, where they pretended to stop the train, where they pretended to argue about virology and not virology, just like in 2023, we have the mother of SOF,

02:11:57.318 --> 02:12:05.181
being promoted with three separate hours on CHD and an hour on Epoch Times as a American thought leader.

02:12:06.202 --> 02:12:10.524
You know who else was an American thought leader promoted on Epoch Times in 2020?

02:12:10.624 --> 02:12:13.145
Lee Min Yan.

02:12:15.726 --> 02:12:18.427
This is a network of liars, ladies and gentlemen.

02:12:18.467 --> 02:12:24.790
It's a network of liars that are wittingly or unwittingly participating in the illusion.

02:12:25.717 --> 02:12:26.838
misleading our children.

02:12:26.858 --> 02:12:31.301
And that's why the crossover event of Andy Kaufman and Steve Kirsch.

02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:42.068
Yes, Andy Kaufman, the guy that Kevin McCarran said in February of 2020 was the baddest of bad and all about stopping the no virus guy, Andy Kaufman.

02:12:42.088 --> 02:12:47.591
You know, the one that I showed earlier with a photograph with shaking the hand of Andrew Cuomo in 2019.

02:12:48.272 --> 02:12:49.773
It's all one big network.

02:12:49.833 --> 02:12:52.395
That's why they all interact together.

02:12:53.254 --> 02:12:58.275
That's why slowly over these many years, nobody talks about the murder that happened here.

02:12:59.456 --> 02:13:01.536
But they're sure that COVID shots are bad.

02:13:01.976 --> 02:13:04.017
Boy, they're sure this is worst case scenario.

02:13:04.057 --> 02:13:05.958
They're sure that there's multiple shooters.

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:17.681
They're sure that they let this happen, but we don't have to worry about how the kid was fooled because then we might reveal the network that Alex Jones and Soph and Sasha are all a part of.

02:13:21.223 --> 02:13:27.809
They created this illusion of consensus, ladies and gentlemen, by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate, and these people need to go to jail for it.

02:13:29.110 --> 02:13:32.173
They need to go to jail as traitors.

02:13:32.453 --> 02:13:37.737
They were involved in making it seem like, for our kids, that transfection and healthy humans worked.

02:13:38.198 --> 02:13:39.679
That's what you just heard in that argument.

02:13:39.699 --> 02:13:44.563
We're talking about under 30 only is sketchy, but people above 30 were saved.

02:13:47.409 --> 02:13:52.351
And RNA can definitely pandemic because this could have even been a bioweapon.

02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:53.452
Stop lying!

02:13:56.533 --> 02:13:57.874
These people are lying about it.

02:13:59.214 --> 02:14:02.516
And yes, ladies and gentlemen, these people are also lying about it.

02:14:02.576 --> 02:14:03.376
And there she is.

02:14:03.937 --> 02:14:05.637
There she is, Jessica Rose.

02:14:06.878 --> 02:14:08.499
There he is, Robert Malone.

02:14:08.519 --> 02:14:10.320
There she is, Jill Glass Poole Malone.

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:10.880
There he is.

02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:31.640
Brett Weinstein, there he is right there, Kevin McKernan, they're all liars, they're all traitors, they're either working for weaponized piles of money that are cooperating with these global interests, but they are definitely working against American children, they are working against American families, they are working against the American Constitution and the American Dream.

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:34.157
And they helped do that.

02:14:34.238 --> 02:14:45.461
They helped with the controlled demolition of the American dream, of the American ideal, because they helped create this illusion of consensus with their fricking masks and the other bullshit that he did.

02:14:46.361 --> 02:14:55.644
And by admitting in July of 2024, that that's the right word, but not admitting that I told him that was the right word four years ago.

02:14:55.664 --> 02:15:00.906
And that his wife said it was the right word three years ago.

02:15:02.062 --> 02:15:04.783
and that I was the one who insisted that they call it that.

02:15:04.884 --> 02:15:05.404
And did they?

02:15:07.285 --> 02:15:07.725
Did they?

02:15:08.886 --> 02:15:09.626
Could they have?

02:15:17.130 --> 02:15:17.791
Could they have?

02:15:18.811 --> 02:15:20.892
For the last three and a half years, they could have.

02:15:22.053 --> 02:15:25.735
But they chose not to, just like all of these people chose not to.

02:15:27.247 --> 02:15:36.513
because they are sustaining an illusion of consensus that is required for this national security exercise, is required for the roles that they play.

02:15:37.133 --> 02:15:48.040
And that's why they won't talk about this new consensus that we need, that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, RNA cannot pandemic, and the vaccine schedule in the USA is a criminal enterprise.

02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:55.765
And we won't say that they used murder and lies in order to cover that up and to make sure that for generations to come, this truth would never come out.

02:15:56.736 --> 02:16:08.104
And we at GigaOM Biological and the rest of the independent bright web believe that a new consensus is necessary about what these weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about.

02:16:09.025 --> 02:16:15.690
Please, ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:16:16.190 --> 02:16:22.015

02:17:03.442 --> 02:17:04.443
Thanks for joining me.

02:17:04.463 --> 02:17:05.544
I hope it was okay.

02:17:06.604 --> 02:17:13.351
I got to get on the road and get some dog food and a couple other things that I've been putting off because

02:17:14.591 --> 02:17:16.012
My best friend does all that stuff.

02:17:16.052 --> 02:17:18.175
So anyway, thanks for joining me.

02:17:18.215 --> 02:17:19.276
I will see you again tomorrow.

02:17:59.861 --> 02:18:11.011
to left field a long home run for Aaron judge into the second deck his ninth of the season and the Yankees have tied it

02:18:25.615 --> 02:18:30.760
I'm actually going to a butcher because I get fresh meat for Ruby all the time.

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:32.482
So we're not going to get high-end bag food.

02:18:33.323 --> 02:18:34.044
We're going to get meat.

02:18:49.805 --> 02:18:51.147
Thanks for the support guys.

02:18:51.207 --> 02:18:52.228
Thanks for sharing my work.

02:18:52.348 --> 02:18:54.431
See you tomorrow by everybody out there.

02:18:55.092 --> 02:18:58.095
And how about some pretty nice sportsmanship by a Blue Jays fan out there.

02:18:58.115 --> 02:19:00.598
Give that young Yankee fan a ball boy.

02:19:00.858 --> 02:19:02.400
That kid is not going to forget tonight.
