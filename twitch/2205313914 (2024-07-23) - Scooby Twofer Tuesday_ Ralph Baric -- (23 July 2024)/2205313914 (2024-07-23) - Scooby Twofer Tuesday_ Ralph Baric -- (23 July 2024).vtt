00:35.845 --> 00:51.512
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles.

00:51.572 --> 00:54.373
Cause you know, not that many people die from it.

00:54.673 --> 01:00.475
It's, it's just a big hassle in the end, but no, when, when we have this.

01:01.776 --> 01:04.397
So what I argued, I believe I can.

01:08.646 --> 01:14.290
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

01:14.410 --> 01:15.351
Whoa, cyber attack.

01:15.371 --> 01:18.413
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.914
Sorry about that.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.535
And it's measles plus.

01:21.655 --> 01:27.159
I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

01:27.459 --> 01:29.461
It's just a big hassle in the end.

01:30.061 --> 01:35.625
But no, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality

01:42.399 --> 01:45.763
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:45.823 --> 01:48.326
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

01:55.097 --> 02:13.600
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

02:13.620 --> 02:23.202
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

02:25.382 --> 02:26.923
I think truth is good for kids.

02:27.364 --> 02:31.206
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.288
We want everybody to feel good.

02:33.308 --> 02:35.670
That's not the way life is.

02:38.632 --> 02:47.078
So what I argued, and I believe I came up with this independently, but I believe Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar, as has Jonathan Cooey.

02:49.543 --> 02:56.289
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.751
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:59.832 --> 03:09.299
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

03:09.319 --> 03:16.025
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.532
But you can tell if someone's lying.

03:20.173 --> 03:21.953
You can sort of feel it in people.

03:23.734 --> 03:24.474
And I have lied.

03:24.634 --> 03:25.514
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:25.534 --> 03:26.454
I don't want to lie.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.295
I don't think I'm a liar.

03:28.395 --> 03:29.435
I try not to be a liar.

03:29.455 --> 03:30.316
I don't want to be a liar.

03:30.876 --> 03:33.657
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

03:35.937 --> 03:39.098
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

03:39.578 --> 03:41.339
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

03:43.379 --> 03:44.060
Isolation, what was it?

03:44.080 --> 03:45.560
Isolation and purification.

03:47.242 --> 03:47.942
Of the virus?

03:48.043 --> 03:48.243
Yes.

03:49.503 --> 04:00.550
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

04:01.211 --> 04:06.094
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

04:06.874 --> 04:08.915
I don't understand what the issue.

04:08.995 --> 04:14.459
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.680
No, it depends on how they used it.

04:17.136 --> 04:18.377
Okay.

04:18.557 --> 04:20.999
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

04:23.521 --> 04:25.482
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

04:25.562 --> 04:31.587
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.728
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

04:38.392 --> 04:40.674
It's literally turning into a worst-case scenario.

04:40.694 --> 04:43.796
The latest data tells us that we're dealing with, essentially, a worst-case scenario.

04:46.636 --> 05:04.123
rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it sweaty palms this is so crazy like these bumps this is so crazy i feel so nervous like what in the world man

05:28.473 --> 05:30.474
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

05:30.494 --> 05:36.277
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:37.678 --> 05:39.439
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.740
It's embarrassing.

06:00.708 --> 06:01.468
Hello, everybody.

06:01.488 --> 06:02.288
Sorry to be late.

06:02.408 --> 06:05.669
I wanted to be on at 1.13 today, but I'm not.

06:05.769 --> 06:06.409
I'm here now.

06:07.789 --> 06:12.810
It is, again, one of these days where we're trying to get a different start, a little quicker.

06:14.030 --> 06:20.291
This is the home of the high-resistance, low-noise information brief called Gigaohm Biological.

06:20.311 --> 06:22.972
It's the 23rd of July, 2024.

06:23.692 --> 06:25.632
Today, I wanted to do something a little different.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.493
I want to do a study hall session, and I want to look at

06:29.233 --> 06:43.620
a video from just at the start of the pandemic and a video from a couple days ago so that we can try to learn a little bit about the pandemic potential of coronaviruses from none other than, um, Ralph Baric.

06:44.160 --> 06:55.026
And I think that's a really, really good idea because, um, this is the kind of sort of biology that as we move forward, we're gonna be able to... Let me just get this... at the right...

06:57.742 --> 06:58.383
level there.

06:59.324 --> 07:21.583
And yeah, so don't forget that the basic premise of this show is that weaponized piles of money and the people that that get their comfort and fame and and fortune from those weaponized piles of money have used social media and mainstream media to convince us that it's worth arguing about where this virus came from.

07:21.603 --> 07:21.664
And

07:24.784 --> 07:31.228
It's by participating in this argument that we have accepted the existence of the novel virus.

07:32.109 --> 07:51.802
We've been governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media, all of these social media platforms and podcasts, and the intellectual dark web is just a small, front-facing example of all of these crafty little things that are going on with sponsorships and things like locals and this kind of thing.

07:52.282 --> 08:08.251
I think it's really important to realize that still after nearly a year and a half of challenging people to just address these things, if you want to address Jonathan Cooley, why not just start with these three statements and see if you can whittle them down to something a little better.

08:09.171 --> 08:14.294
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:14.894 --> 08:19.597
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

08:20.097 --> 08:37.446
That last one you might express with a little more nuance and elegance by saying viruses are not pattern integrities, but I think any way that you look at it, these three statements are statements that no one seems to want to talk about.

08:37.566 --> 08:38.886
Everybody wants to talk about

08:40.926 --> 08:44.369
I don't know, a whole bunch of other things other than the biology we are pushing.

08:44.409 --> 08:47.292
And when I say they, I'm talking about these people.

08:47.352 --> 08:50.575
I do want to give you a little positive information.

08:50.595 --> 08:52.796
Oops, that was not the right cut.

08:52.877 --> 08:55.219
I wanted to cut here and then there.

08:58.288 --> 08:58.988
Hello, everybody.

08:59.929 --> 09:09.395
Yesterday I showed this graphic and I suggested that this was a team being loosely orchestrated by Robert Malone.

09:09.736 --> 09:18.201
And if you look at this graphic carefully, you'll see that I'm kind of implying that maybe I need to be a little skeptical or we need to be a little skeptical of Denny Rancourt.

09:18.902 --> 09:26.947
And it was with intention that I put him over there because I want to show you that all of the purple frames there are people that aren't American.

09:28.148 --> 09:45.603
And although I think that when I've spoken with Denny Rancourt and when he's spoken with other people, he's very clear that there's no evidence of spread, there's no evidence of a pandemic at the beginning when it was all supposed to be starting in 2020.

09:48.052 --> 10:01.126
He seems to also kind of be okay with the fact that a lot of these people on this side of the diagram are very happy to point people to Denny's work without saying that.

10:01.847 --> 10:08.694
Instead, they will point to Denny's work and say that, wow, it's really great, and look at how many people were killed by this shot.

10:09.375 --> 10:14.282
Look how many people were killed by the double-stranded DNA contamination of these shots.

10:14.763 --> 10:16.806
Look how many people were killed by the rush.

10:16.906 --> 10:18.949
Look how many people were killed by the lockdown.

10:19.409 --> 10:26.179
But never really quite get to the fact that Denny actually shows that it's tantamount to murder.

10:28.090 --> 10:54.496
And that nuance there is starting to become frustrating because Denny could just put his foot down and say, hey, I think it would be better if you guys would point out that the whole justification for rolling out potentially billions of transfections made in many different places around the world by all the same processes of recombinant DNA, molecular biological techniques,

10:55.516 --> 11:05.504
rather than saying that that whole impetus for that is based on a lie, they keep staying focused on the shots.

11:06.305 --> 11:11.029
And I think this is a problem, although there is some sunny side to this.

11:12.230 --> 11:17.975
Denny recently showed on Substack that Michael Yeadon is making the argument

11:18.675 --> 11:22.720
that we only need to focus on one of his observations.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.142
You can see that right here.

11:24.803 --> 11:35.356
Mike focuses on one of our observations in particular that there was no excess all-cause mortality prior to the WHO declaration and that is a brilliant argument.

11:35.396 --> 11:35.937
Now I think

11:37.361 --> 11:41.442
This is maybe the first step in first, you know, giving credit where credit's due.

11:41.942 --> 11:51.765
Mike Eden has been saying that for quite some time and trying to do it as succinctly and generally as possible.

11:52.245 --> 11:58.247
I think Mike Eden agreed with me on my show and liked my portrayal of the idea that if we call the police,

11:58.847 --> 12:11.085
We don't have to have a reasonable explanation for the motives of why the criminal has invaded our house and why we're calling the cops on the criminal at two in the morning.

12:11.506 --> 12:14.370
We just have to say there's a criminal in our house and he shouldn't be here.

12:15.571 --> 12:26.259
And in this case, I think Mike Yeadon saying that there's no evidence of a pandemic, so all of this stuff is bullshit, is I think one of the best tactics.

12:26.319 --> 12:32.283
And quite frankly, I really feel as though that's what this slide is all about.

12:32.423 --> 12:40.409
I really think that saying it this way and choosing to try and succinctly express our position in short,

12:42.071 --> 12:53.042
statements is what should, in theory, open any dumb ideas or any preconceived notions of biology that doesn't exist.

12:53.482 --> 13:00.029
It should open any of those potential things to ridicule and correction and critique.

13:00.851 --> 13:04.373
But instead, the only thing people do is ignore this slide.

13:05.033 --> 13:23.182
And that, I think, is kind of the same thing as what people are doing when they tend to ignore the fact that Denny Rancor has shown for really four and a half years now, since May of 2020, that there's no real evidence of the thing they're claiming that's happening.

13:24.761 --> 13:27.322
And he went on to show it over and over and over again.

13:27.362 --> 13:34.943
And eventually he got invited to go to Romania of all places and present on stage with some of those people over there.

13:35.704 --> 13:41.905
And then those people all came back to the United States and said, Denny Rancor's presentation was amazing.

13:41.925 --> 13:44.906
17 million people have been killed by the shots.

13:48.507 --> 13:51.988
And so that again, started to run, it ran out another quarter.

13:52.028 --> 13:53.748
It ran out another half really.

13:54.923 --> 14:14.031
I mean, we're talking about over half the game being run out because from November 2023 until now, we haven't made any useful progress since Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose met Denny Rancourt for the first time in Romania in November of 2023.

14:15.772 --> 14:26.537
saw his presentation live, probably had breakfast with him at the hotel, and then came back to the United States and didn't tell us anything about that first observation which he first made in May of 2020.

14:28.038 --> 14:39.364
And so the only reason why I had Denny over there is because I find it so strange that of all the people who've made all the observations early,

14:41.294 --> 15:05.475
Denny doesn't seem to insist that everybody acknowledge that he keeps making, he made that observation and he keeps fine tuning it and sharpening it and all arrows point to yes, you know, and demanding that those people over there who don't want to talk about 2020 make the admission that it's all murder and lies.

15:05.535 --> 15:06.897
It doesn't appear to be a, a,

15:11.161 --> 15:13.642
it doesn't appear to be a spreading pathogen.

15:16.123 --> 15:20.065
And this is really crucial to see that this is where I'm pushing.

15:20.145 --> 15:33.631
And while other people might come up with different terms for what this is, a gigaspiral or a purity spiral, no, this is very objectively looking at what people said and when they said it

15:35.731 --> 15:46.119
and comparing that to when they first talked to me, how long they talked to me, and what I was able to, in my opinion, adequately express to them.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.121
Some people haven't heard my pitch.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.283
Some people haven't heard my pitch over coffee.

15:51.323 --> 15:56.668
Some people have heard my pitch over Zoom, over Signal, over

15:58.490 --> 16:01.433
over dinner, over a rental car ride.

16:01.753 --> 16:07.479
So there's lots of different, you know, doses of KUI that you can get along the way.

16:07.939 --> 16:11.583
And not everybody has spent hours and hours listening to me on my stream.

16:12.424 --> 16:19.731
Not everybody like Brett Weinstein has had me at his fingertips on a signal chat for six or eight months.

16:21.570 --> 16:28.493
Not everybody has hired me as a consultant for a book like Robert F. Kennedy did for a whole year.

16:29.554 --> 16:41.520
Not everybody has hired me as a staff scientist like Children's Health Defense did for six months this year until I stepped on Meryl Nass' or Robert Malone's toes.

16:44.986 --> 16:49.507
So I think it's important to point it out, but we're gonna keep that stuff for Mondays.

16:49.547 --> 17:02.511
I'm sorry, I just wanted to give you a little positive note there that we keep seeing Denny Rancourt giving a shout out to Mike Eden, who's, you know, understandably Mike Eden is done.

17:02.571 --> 17:06.892
Like he's too little butter spread over too much bread at this point in time.

17:07.332 --> 17:08.193
In 2020, he was already,

17:09.793 --> 17:13.417
complaining about this stuff in front of the parliament in UK.

17:13.457 --> 17:24.449
And so, you know, either he has been an operative since the very beginning, or he's been an outspoken critic of everything that this pandemic has been since the beginning.

17:24.469 --> 17:26.771
And my chips are still on the ladder.

17:28.052 --> 17:39.128
So let's try to make some headway into the pandemic potential of coronaviruses and how this concept, right, because that's a concept, pandemic potential of coronaviruses, how is that

17:40.100 --> 17:40.660
created.

17:40.920 --> 17:47.403
And I think you're going to find that if you go into the literature and look, there are very few people to blame for this.

17:48.244 --> 17:58.988
And from the perspective of, let's say, mentor chains, the mentor chains basically start at Ralph Baric and end after Ralph Baric.

17:59.108 --> 18:03.770
In other words, everybody that trains with him is familiar with coronaviruses.

18:03.810 --> 18:07.752
Very few people go on to work on coronaviruses further.

18:09.003 --> 18:37.002
A notable postdoc of Ralph Baric that went on further to work on coronaviruses, at least in terms of writing reviews about them, is Alison Totura, who went on after her postdoc with Ralph Baric to write a review with Sina Bavari that all of you should read, and that I included in Bobby's book, which is about a coronavirus pandemic that would come from a bat cave or camels, and that remdesivir would be a hell of a useful drug to start with for.

18:38.570 --> 18:56.735
And so I think that one of the things that I'm trying to challenge people to consider is the idea that this whole thing is a sort of manufactured biosecurity narrative that has been laid down over many years, primarily by funding Ralph Baric's lab.

18:57.375 --> 19:19.212
And so as long as Ralph Baric passes students through and is able to bamboozle them with the shell game about what infectious clones are, and that infectious clones are essentially what we find in the wild, just conveniently replicated by modern molecular biological techniques so we don't have to work so hard culturing.

19:20.913 --> 19:21.614
And that's a lie.

19:22.950 --> 19:27.475
Transfection and transformation in cell culture is not virology.

19:27.976 --> 19:30.579
It is transfection and transformation in cell culture.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.784
And doing the same in animals is not virology.

19:34.844 --> 19:36.606
It's just transfection and transformation.

19:37.697 --> 19:42.222
And so working on self-replicating RNA constructs is not virology either.

19:42.242 --> 19:46.387
It's synthetic biology.

19:46.487 --> 19:52.554
It's synthetic manufacture of DNA and RNA and its application in cell culture in animals.

19:52.634 --> 19:55.737
And so what I want to do is listen to these two

19:57.037 --> 20:17.512
discussions about the biology of coronaviruses and I want you to listen specifically for, specifically for clues about methodologies where the elusive nature of coronaviruses and their reluctance to subject themselves to culture is contrasted by the

20:19.153 --> 20:25.935
the sort of mythological biology of coronaviruses that they can evolve very rapidly.

20:25.995 --> 20:40.820
And they are a very stable genome that can shift gears when it needs to, to adapt to what I guess Geert van den Bosch would call infectious pressure, but Ralph Baric will call evolutionary pressure.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.240
I don't know.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.661
These people are all just using words to enchant us.

20:45.721 --> 20:47.802
So let's start with the first video.

20:48.742 --> 21:02.068
which is Ralph Baric from 2020, right at the beginning of the pandemic, just trying to make sure that everybody starts out on the same page with regard to the basic coronavirus biology.

21:03.288 --> 21:05.469
And so let's check this one out.

21:06.210 --> 21:07.610
Hit escape here.

21:11.072 --> 21:12.512
No, that's not what I said.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.053
I said escape.

21:16.351 --> 21:18.392
My keyboard might be dead or something like that.

21:18.432 --> 21:19.932
I'm not really sure what's going on there.

21:26.114 --> 21:27.935
And let me move my brain for a second.

21:30.215 --> 21:31.516
Get this arrow up here.

21:38.666 --> 21:39.107
February 26, 2020.

21:39.928 --> 21:54.466
This is very close to the first time that a lot of these people, uh... It's very close to the time when Kevin McKernan started joining podcasts when, um...

21:55.407 --> 22:09.154
when Addy Adds and Paul Cottrell and Kevin McCairn decided that they needed to hit the airwaves as well to get the word out about the worst case scenario, a Red Dragon event or something like that.

22:09.914 --> 22:13.356
So this is Ralph Baric and the public facing version of this

22:13.996 --> 22:19.079
giving a presentation at the University of North Carolina, Gillings School of Public Health.

22:19.459 --> 22:23.921
That also may just be where he's affiliated, but I do think that's where he's presenting as well.

22:23.981 --> 22:24.342
Here we go.

22:24.402 --> 22:28.004
Here with them, people wearing masks, as is happening right now.

22:28.884 --> 22:35.227
And most of the new emerging coronaviruses that we've experienced in the 21st century are derived from bats.

22:36.668 --> 22:43.592
And in general, there are 1300 different bat species, and each one has somewhere between seven and eight

22:44.102 --> 22:45.264
different coronaviruses.

22:46.405 --> 22:54.515
And so this is, in essence, a reservoir of viruses that occasionally spill over into human populations and cause big outbreaks of disease.

22:54.555 --> 23:00.722
And I'm going to try to talk to you about how this occurs, why it occurs, why it appears to be accelerating.

23:01.483 --> 23:03.746
and what we need to be prepared for in the future.

23:17.225 --> 23:26.253
biological dark matter that the founder of MetaBiota, Nathan Wolf, was selling us a few years before that.

23:26.353 --> 23:34.080
So this is a very consistent biosecurity narrative with very little biological data to substantiate these kinds of claims.

23:34.580 --> 23:40.946
And now again, remember, we're focused on methodology, but I will pause it occasionally to say things like that as well.

23:41.026 --> 23:43.789
So who knows how long it's going to take to get through this, but it's only about a

23:44.690 --> 23:45.653
30 minute presentation.

23:46.034 --> 23:51.852
In the context of this new SARS coronavirus 2 novel coronavirus that emerged three months ago.

23:53.300 --> 24:04.488
So just on your right-hand side of the slide, there have been four major respiratory viruses that have emerged in human population.

24:04.508 --> 24:07.610
A lot of this is what I said on my bicycle on JC on a Bike.

24:07.630 --> 24:11.933
Some of my first pandemic videos are exactly this.

24:12.193 --> 24:14.615
I'm just going to check the notebook camera.

24:14.635 --> 24:17.777
Since the beginning of the 21st century, starting with SARS in 2003,

24:19.438 --> 24:30.153
the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus strain, followed by Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus in the Middle Eastern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012.

24:31.154 --> 24:32.516
That outbreak is still ongoing.

24:33.157 --> 24:34.419
And then just a few months ago,

24:35.202 --> 24:42.325
the SARS-CoV-2 strain or 2019 novel coronavirus or COVID-19, which is the disease.

24:43.025 --> 24:53.308
So what I'm going to talk about is talk about what the drivers are of emerging coronaviruses in terms of how they jump between species to cause outbreaks of human disease.

24:55.347 --> 25:07.390
talk about the context of the 2003 SARS outbreak and why we were able to control that and why this is gonna be so different, so much more difficult to control the 2020 outbreak strains.

25:08.130 --> 25:12.571
And then I'm gonna talk a little bit about countermeasures that we use in our lab.

25:12.651 --> 25:18.493
So, coronaviruses, nidoviruses is a bigger, larger group of viruses that include the coronaviruses.

25:19.793 --> 25:24.296
And these viruses have a tendency to traffic easily between species.

25:25.077 --> 25:32.562
So there are four common contemporary human coronaviruses that we've all been infected with, probably in the first five years of life.

25:33.643 --> 25:36.425
They originated between 120 and about 800 years ago, mostly from bats, rodents, or cattle.

25:42.271 --> 25:43.432
to cause human outbreaks.

25:43.492 --> 25:45.494
They then colonize the human population.

25:45.954 --> 25:50.258
They cause mild disease, respiratory tract infections in children primarily.

25:52.440 --> 25:58.344
Over the last 25 to 30 years, there have been a variety of new... Now, it's interesting.

25:58.404 --> 26:00.366
I don't know why I took myself off the screen there.

26:02.906 --> 26:06.148
It's interesting that he, these are the things he starts with, right?

26:06.228 --> 26:14.452
Nidoviruses are a larger group of viruses that include coronaviruses and traffic easily between species.

26:15.352 --> 26:20.014
No real data to substantiate that, just that's an assumption.

26:20.594 --> 26:23.416
Another assumption that was built in there was that all

26:24.116 --> 26:29.624
Humans are infected by these four endemic coronaviruses in humans.

26:29.644 --> 26:32.748
They're infected in the first five years of their life.

26:33.789 --> 26:34.851
And that's just said.

26:35.712 --> 26:37.494
As a matter of fact, that's the way it is.

26:38.689 --> 26:46.956
Now, think about that very carefully in the context of this new coronavirus that supposedly none of us have any immunity to.

26:47.737 --> 26:50.179
Because that's part of the illusion here.

26:50.699 --> 27:00.908
It only works, the only way that argument works is if the only correlative immunity you care about is antibodies and the ability to detect them with a given

27:03.786 --> 27:07.189
commercial product or specific methodology.

27:07.249 --> 27:30.130
So in other words, they are going to make no effort to describe to you that we don't really understand how the complex immune memory to, let's say, RNA signals occurs during the first five years of the life of a child, but we kind of assume that it happens.

27:31.069 --> 27:52.652
And that's what he should be saying, that we assume that in the first five years of life, that any of these signals that are endemic to our environment are going to be things that our immune system reckons with in such a way to build sort of a symbiotic or, you know, ignore kind of pattern with the environment that we find ourselves in.

27:54.138 --> 28:03.727
but instead they're hyper-specific and they say that kids are infected with the four human coronavirus strains in the first five years of their life.

28:03.907 --> 28:13.636
And that already is a massive simplification of, and a massive level of specificity that they absolutely do not have.

28:14.645 --> 28:29.275
If that's the case, then why don't we have hundreds of thousands of sequences, never mind millions of sequences of these coronaviruses, and why haven't we been monitoring them so that we understand how they change and don't change?

28:29.795 --> 28:31.776
There was already an experiment to be done.

28:33.097 --> 28:56.179
20 years ago then if these coronaviruses have been in the background the whole time and somehow or another we're supposed to believe that the biosecurity state that's concerned with pandemics wouldn't have characterized that background that all of us apparently are developing a lifelong immune memory to or at least an immune tolerance to for the rest of our lives come on guys

28:57.040 --> 29:03.803
This is the kind of of incongruency that I saw already very early and was frustrated with.

29:06.265 --> 29:08.086
And it was available in 2020.

29:08.166 --> 29:17.470
This contradiction right here was already available in 2020 because we don't know how we build an immune memory and immune tolerance to the

29:19.597 --> 29:21.719
RNA signals that are in our environment.

29:21.759 --> 29:29.804
But the assumption is, is that we build a tolerance to them over time, and especially in our development, in during a childhood.

29:32.206 --> 29:45.915
We probably should assume that breastfeeding has some role in bridging the gap between a naive immune system and an immune system that is appropriately adapted to some of the antigenic challenges in their surroundings.

29:47.740 --> 29:49.243
None of this stuff is discussed.

29:49.283 --> 29:51.888
They walk so carefully around it.

29:51.908 --> 29:59.923
Or they do this, where they just tell you some ridiculously simplified cartoon about the immune development of a child.

30:03.027 --> 30:08.371
Coronaviruses have caused major outbreaks in domesticated species of economic importance, like pigs and cattle.

30:09.512 --> 30:15.656
The most notable one here was porcine epidemic diarrhea virus that killed about 12 million piglets in the US in 2012.

30:16.077 --> 30:29.166
And then since the beginning of the 21st century, there's been accelerating cross-species transmission movement, starting with SARS about 16 years ago, MERS about seven years ago.

30:29.726 --> 30:31.948
The SADS coronavirus emerged in China

30:32.757 --> 30:35.299
two years ago, to cause outbreaks in pigs.

30:36.019 --> 30:45.345
It's notable because it replicates efficiently in human cells of the lung, and so it has all the potential features that could make it an epidemic strain in humans.

30:46.806 --> 30:53.810
And then we have SARS-Coronavirus-2, which is a kissing cousin of SARS that emerged three months ago.

30:55.151 --> 30:59.614
There is gonna be some science in this talk, but I'm gonna try to keep it relatively

31:02.117 --> 31:04.900
You understand that the lockdowns haven't occurred yet, right?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.741
There's not this super panic.

31:06.802 --> 31:10.625
I don't even know how far off we are time-wise.

31:10.685 --> 31:15.950
If this is the 26th of February, I don't know how far off we are from Sohomish County, man.

31:15.990 --> 31:17.552
It could even only be a week later.

31:20.871 --> 31:23.233
What are the drivers of coronavirus evolution?

31:23.493 --> 31:25.255
Why are they moving between species?

31:25.515 --> 31:27.997
So here is the regulated fidelity thing.

31:28.037 --> 31:37.445
This is the fundamental problem or obfuscation that occurs with the use of infectious clones.

31:37.505 --> 31:47.813
So we're just going to take many stabs at this all summer long and all fall long and all winter long until people actually get it, until it sinks in, or until I'm able to figure out

31:49.074 --> 31:52.197
a very short ladder for people to climb out of this hole.

31:53.158 --> 32:14.658
But understand that one of the illusions that needs to be created, one of the biological problems that is created when you're using RNA, and especially single-stranded RNA, as your genetic material, is that it's hard to copy single-stranded RNA with high fidelity.

32:17.728 --> 32:33.977
And that high fidelity is revealed in the behavior of and the instability of the smaller genomes that we have understood as similar entities before the discovery of and the description of coronaviruses.

32:34.037 --> 32:41.001
And so now here, Ralph Baric is going to describe how coronaviruses have evolved, apparently,

32:42.141 --> 32:46.024
a better enzymatic solution to copying RNA.

32:46.445 --> 32:56.672
And that's why they are able to sustain these large genomes despite the usual downside of RNA, which is copying can be terrible.

32:56.732 --> 33:01.415
And he's going to say in this talk that it can be an error every 1000 bases.

33:04.787 --> 33:11.727
coronavirus has 30,000 bases in its genome, that would be 30 errors per copy.

33:13.113 --> 33:14.574
30 errors per copying.

33:14.594 --> 33:17.357
We're not even talking about recombination.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.598
And he says recombination rates are high.

33:19.999 --> 33:28.906
And we're going to talk about why recombination rates being high is not a good thing for the infectious cycle model that they want us to teach our kids.

33:28.926 --> 33:30.527
So let's just listen to Ralph first.

33:31.347 --> 33:34.690
Well, these viruses have the largest RNA genome in nature.

33:34.990 --> 33:36.852
It's 30,000 nucleotides in length.

33:38.133 --> 33:40.575
And to maintain a genome of that size,

33:41.758 --> 33:46.041
They have a polymerase that has a fidelity function.

33:46.241 --> 33:50.163
In other words, it fixes errors when the virus replicates.

33:50.363 --> 33:57.268
Most RNA viruses, like flu or HIV, make a mistake every 1,000 nucleotides that they synthesize, they make a mistake.

33:57.648 --> 34:00.249
Or every 10,000 nucleotides, they may make a mistake.

34:01.070 --> 34:07.554
RNA viruses, like flu or HIV, make a mistake every 1,000 nucleotides that they synthesize, they make a mistake.

34:07.934 --> 34:10.496
Or every 10,000 nucleotides, they may make a mistake.

34:11.846 --> 34:18.431
In a big genome like coronaviruses have, if they can't repair that, they go into what's called error catastrophe and die.

34:19.812 --> 34:29.038
So I've just told you of a potential vulnerability that if you can develop drugs to knock out that activity, the virus will go into error catastrophe and eventually burn out.

34:29.579 --> 34:32.381
So novel enzymatic functions in the virus

34:33.171 --> 34:36.013
that can be taken advantage of for therapeutic intervention.

34:36.553 --> 34:43.538
And of course, what drug is going to target XON and the replication fidelity of coronavirus?

34:43.618 --> 34:45.059
It will be remdesivir, of course.

34:47.581 --> 34:54.086
And drugs that interfere with this are going to be a target that they all get very excited about.

34:54.963 --> 35:17.021
What they're not going to tell you is the reason why that would be exciting is because these enzymes, even if XON, non-structural protein 14 there in his diagram, even if this protein is real and it does contribute to a higher fidelity of copying,

35:19.625 --> 35:35.370
It doesn't change the fact that the fundamental model of the infectious cycle involves these sub-genomic RNAs and the regulation of sub-genomic RNAs, the packaging of full genomes or not full genomes.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.790
It involves recombination rates.

35:37.851 --> 35:45.553
If the recombination rates are 25% during mixed infections, the vast majority of recombinations are gonna be error catastrophe.

35:45.573 --> 35:46.933
They're gonna be not error catastrophe.

35:46.953 --> 35:48.774
They're gonna be a catastrophe error.

35:49.514 --> 35:58.747
and you're going to cross over and then you're going to recombine with another transcript that inevitably knocks out a gene or deletes half.

35:59.287 --> 36:04.474
You're not guaranteed to jump from one transcript to the other and have the story be continuous.

36:05.560 --> 36:10.406
That would be like saying, well, you're copying one book, and then you're going to jump over to another copy of the book.

36:10.887 --> 36:18.216
And hopefully you'll start at the exact page and the exact sentence that you need to start at, so that that recombination doesn't matter.

36:18.276 --> 36:20.318
But instead, you might go from chapter 14 to chapter 2 again.

36:23.459 --> 36:30.363
And what consequences does that have if that genome with that kind of redundancy gets packaged or vice versa?

36:30.723 --> 36:36.386
You might go from chapter two and jump to chapter 14 and finish the book in two chapters and then that's your genome.

36:37.107 --> 36:45.111
And so the rates of recombination being this high suggest they want you to believe and imagine in your head that these are all bonuses.

36:45.191 --> 36:48.293
These are all things that give superpowers to

36:49.093 --> 37:01.649
to coronaviruses when in reality these are all things that make their model of what's supposed to happen even more complicated and even more unlikely to occur as simply as they want to claim it is.

37:08.294 --> 37:12.857
Now this regulated fidelity can also vary depending on environmental conditions.

37:13.617 --> 37:20.661
So the virus, if it needs to increase its mutation rate to adapt to something or to a new change, it will modulate that activity.

37:21.622 --> 37:34.069
And so- And so if you're going to claim that the virus can modulate its ability to be high fidelity or not so high fidelity, does it also modulate where it makes that mutation?

37:36.693 --> 37:38.575
And where will it make those mutations?

37:39.656 --> 37:45.621
It'll make those mutations presumably in those subgenomic transcripts, which are the highest abundance.

37:46.922 --> 37:47.923
That's what you'd presume.

37:49.042 --> 37:52.004
That's what they presume, but they don't really talk about that.

37:52.084 --> 37:54.085
He's just going to say that in general.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.626
They can modulate it depending on conditions.

37:57.327 --> 38:01.369
Think about the fact that these are not pattern integrities.

38:01.429 --> 38:17.759
These are supposed to be single chain, 30,000 base pair long, single RNA molecule genomes that can modulate the way they copy themselves depending on conditions.

38:18.612 --> 38:20.933
but he doesn't need to explain it to you any more than that.

38:22.094 --> 38:47.388
No more biology needed there because you should just take his word for it that these things, if I told you that an insect could, that bees could adjust whether or not their venom was really stingy or it actually kind of tickled a little bit and it all depended on conditions, wouldn't you want a pretty good explanation for how the hell did they do that?

38:48.427 --> 38:49.367
What are the conditions?

38:49.407 --> 38:51.328
How does it change what's in their stinger?

38:52.369 --> 39:04.314
So as a biologist, the question that should come to your mind is he just showed you earlier here, a picture of some, some, I'm going to go back so you can see it.

39:05.334 --> 39:13.178
He just showed you a picture of some proteins that are all lumped together and supposedly making copies of, of, uh,

39:14.605 --> 39:24.476
RNA and he's telling you that these little machines here can adjust their error rate depending on whether you need more errors or whether you need less errors.

39:27.559 --> 39:33.386
That's a pretty bold claim to make about a cuckoo clock whose parts you still don't really understand.

39:35.796 --> 39:39.599
That's a pretty bold claim to make and just hand wave around it.

39:40.039 --> 39:45.083
The cool thing about coronavirus is they can adjust their fidelity to depend on conditions.

39:46.324 --> 40:02.836
This is a deep state national security narrative that Ralph Baric has very nervously been creating himself on behalf of Tony Fauci, NIH, and the rest of these people who want to enslave our children

40:03.732 --> 40:09.575
that want to take our children and turn them into voluntary experimental animals.

40:09.995 --> 40:18.158
Or maybe get our children to give their children as voluntary experimental animals, like maybe Sasha Latupova did to her daughter.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.520
You know, just experiment on my daughter.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.421
See if you can make her go viral.

40:23.501 --> 40:24.481
Give her some scripts.

40:24.861 --> 40:26.182
Help her make some videos.

40:30.014 --> 40:33.217
So we can have some idea of how to make people go viral.

40:33.257 --> 40:38.181
We can have a list of people that we could use to create chaos in the United States.

40:39.742 --> 40:40.543
Sure, have at it.

40:42.104 --> 40:43.125
My daughter would be great.

40:47.366 --> 40:48.607
It's all the same thing.

40:48.627 --> 40:52.110
It is one giant national security narrative.

40:52.150 --> 41:01.818
And as long as all the postdocs that study these enzymes go through Ralph Baric's lab, they're all working on synthetic constructs.

41:01.878 --> 41:06.642
They're all working on DNA and RNA produced synthetically.

41:06.742 --> 41:08.764
None of it is derived from the wild.

41:09.304 --> 41:11.986
None of it is derived from culturing viruses.

41:12.647 --> 41:14.348
And it's just ridiculous.

41:15.089 --> 41:24.194
He is the sole distributor of SARS Urbani, the infectious clone made from SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1.

41:29.777 --> 41:33.139
Well, these viruses have the largest RNA genome in nature.

41:33.679 --> 41:35.280
It's 30,000 nucleotides in length.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.022
And to maintain a genome of that size,

41:40.191 --> 41:44.494
They have a polymerase that has a fidelity function.

41:44.694 --> 41:48.597
In other words, it fixes errors when the virus replicates.

41:48.797 --> 41:55.722
Most RNA viruses, like flu or HIV, make a mistake every 1,000 nucleotides that they synthesize, they make a mistake.

41:56.102 --> 41:58.684
Or every 10,000 nucleotides, they make a mistake.

42:00.024 --> 42:06.569
In a big genome like coronaviruses have, if they can't repair that, they go into what's called error catastrophe and die.

42:08.095 --> 42:13.622
And so it's weird to even be talking like it's the virus because the virus is the genome.

42:13.662 --> 42:14.123
That's it.

42:14.183 --> 42:19.530
The genome goes into your cell and it makes these enzymes and now the enzymes are responsible for this.

42:20.010 --> 42:22.013
But the enzymes aren't the virus.

42:22.093 --> 42:23.835
The enzymes are not in the virus.

42:23.895 --> 42:25.718
The enzymes are made by your cells.

42:27.478 --> 42:41.522
And yet he attributes all of these things, all of these ideas, all of these processes, all of the supposed selective pressures on the virus, even though the virus doesn't have these enzymes.

42:41.562 --> 42:45.464
These enzymes are only present when it's infecting something.

42:48.325 --> 42:55.267
And so once your biology is sophisticated enough that you can listen and hear it,

42:56.178 --> 42:58.440
These people are just telling a story.

42:58.480 --> 43:09.847
That's just a mythology that has been very consistently curated by a few people like Peter Daszak, Nathan Wolf, Tony Fauci, Ralph Baric, and maybe Mark Denison.

43:09.887 --> 43:10.307
That's it.

43:10.548 --> 43:11.388
That's all you needed.

43:11.828 --> 43:16.592
They took Stanley Perlman out of the equation a long time ago.

43:16.632 --> 43:24.897
And Stanley Perlman, of course, is the guy who made his whole career showing that it was T-cells that were the important and crucial

43:26.798 --> 43:33.721
crucial part of the immune system that responded to a respiratory virus and created the immune response and governed it.

43:35.041 --> 43:35.301
Yeah.

43:36.742 --> 43:40.663
So that's why we don't talk to Stanley Perlman very much anymore, but we talk to Ralph Baric.

43:40.923 --> 43:49.907
Just told you of a potential vulnerability that if you can develop drugs to knock out that activity, the virus will go into error catastrophe and eventually burn out.

43:50.407 --> 43:53.208
So, novel enzymatic functions in the virus

43:54.008 --> 43:56.889
that can be taken advantage of for therapeutic intervention.

43:57.970 --> 44:02.512
Now, this regulated fidelity can also vary depending on environmental conditions.

44:03.272 --> 44:10.316
So the virus, if it needs to increase its mutation rate to adapt to something or to a new change, it will modulate that activity.

44:11.286 --> 44:13.267
And so the viruses are quite clever.

44:13.808 --> 44:16.609
They also undergo recombination at high frequency.

44:16.649 --> 44:18.110
Well, what is RNA recombination?

44:18.910 --> 44:25.814
Well, remember that I mentioned that up to six, seven to nine coronaviruses exist in a bat.

44:26.735 --> 44:32.839
If you have a co-infected- So 1,300 species of bat and seven to nine coronaviruses in each bat.

44:32.899 --> 44:40.123
Now, are they implying, are they just saying it right here that bats make coronaviruses?

44:41.357 --> 44:51.983
We don't make coronavirus, but bats make coronaviruses, and each species has between seven and eight or six to eight coronaviruses unique to them.

44:52.103 --> 44:54.044
That's an interesting statement to make.

44:54.624 --> 45:03.589
It's possible that bats, because of their biology, signal with self-replicating RNAs more than other species.

45:03.649 --> 45:04.909
That's totally possible.

45:04.969 --> 45:05.350
Why not?

45:06.069 --> 45:19.547
They live in huge, dense colonies that might require a methodology, a mechanism by which the cells of the immune systems could communicate in such a way to keep them in sync.

45:19.647 --> 45:20.028
I don't know.

45:20.248 --> 45:21.129
I'm just saying that

45:21.690 --> 45:28.913
that it's an interesting thing to say here, because again, it's very Nathan Wolf and Metobiota-esque.

45:28.993 --> 45:33.094
It's very EcoHealth Alliance and Peter Daszak-esque.

45:33.194 --> 45:41.237
It's very Tony Fauci-esque to say that there are 1,300 species of bats and he says between six and eight unique coronaviruses in them.

45:41.698 --> 45:44.899
And then when they're replicating, they can cross over and recombine.

45:45.299 --> 45:50.161
And that's a further complication in the pandemic potential, further

45:51.202 --> 45:55.125
data to edify pandemic potential when that's not true.

45:55.946 --> 46:00.269
That means it's more likely that you're not going to make a successful copy of the genome.

46:00.670 --> 46:05.373
It's more likely that you're going to make erroneous recombinations.

46:05.414 --> 46:11.659
It's more likely that you're going to make erroneous recombinations that result in truncated genomes.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.002
And so the whole idea of this creating more

46:17.273 --> 46:38.616
more potential is just wrong stop lying action with a blue coronavirus and a green coronavirus when the blue coronavirus is being replicated this polymerase complex up here can fall off bind to the green template and make a chimeric it can fall off this super high fidelity proofreading

46:39.773 --> 46:48.656
proofreading RNA-dependent RNA polymerase can fall off and go on to another transcript that just happens to be right there.

46:49.216 --> 46:50.976
You see what we're talking about?

46:50.996 --> 47:03.620
The inside of an infected epithelial cell, presumably, which is not a small space relative to the size of these RNA molecules, and more importantly, relative to the size of these proteins.

47:03.840 --> 47:07.721
One cell could have hundreds or even thousands of ribosomes.

47:12.335 --> 47:20.938
It's extraordinary the level of bullshit that they've thrown at us and how hard it has been to extricate ourselves from it.

47:21.278 --> 47:27.901
So in other words, they've genetically mixed their components so that you have something new that didn't exist before.

47:28.701 --> 47:31.142
And this happens about 25% of the progeny of a mixed infection.

47:33.743 --> 47:35.104
will be recombinants.

47:35.484 --> 47:42.166
Flu does reassortment in about 25% to 30% of the progeny from a mixed infection are resorted viruses.

47:42.707 --> 47:45.148
And this drives pandemic outbreaks of flu disease.

47:45.348 --> 47:48.329
So coronaviruses have their own trick like flu.

47:49.710 --> 47:56.095
But it's not the same because flu, supposedly, according to their biology, number one is a negative strand RNA.

47:56.595 --> 48:02.860
Number two are small little segments of that RNA.

48:03.020 --> 48:05.822
And the segments are what get reassorted.

48:05.902 --> 48:12.266
But every flu virus has to be packaged with a number of these little pieces of RNA.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.268
And then also, what?

48:14.568 --> 48:15.509
It needs an enzyme.

48:16.209 --> 48:21.070
It needs the RNA dependent RNA polymerase because a negative strand RNA, we don't have that.

48:22.090 --> 48:22.950
We can't do that.

48:23.030 --> 48:24.031
We can't use those.

48:25.211 --> 48:30.872
That's what I think you should realize from the perspective of the flu versus.

48:31.472 --> 48:36.153
So a flu virus, if I just draw a cartoon of flu virus, the genome would look like this.

48:36.193 --> 48:38.874
It might have, let's just pretend it has four parts.

48:38.934 --> 48:39.574
This would be flu.

48:41.024 --> 48:46.785
And then a coronavirus genome is supposed to be just one long genome that's 30,000 bases, yeah?

48:47.665 --> 48:56.227
And so maybe the genomes are equivalent size, but this one is broken up into some kind of segments.

48:56.327 --> 49:00.128
And these segments, during replication, are what get reassorted.

49:00.188 --> 49:06.770
So if you call these segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then you have another flu virus with 1,

49:08.030 --> 49:22.798
two, four, six, and seven, then you can imagine a scenario when you're copying these two viruses that you make all of these, you know, you're making all of these little RNAs and then the new package might have a one,

49:23.838 --> 49:27.420
a 7, a 4, a 3, and a 2.

49:27.921 --> 49:33.184
And so this combination will be unique to the infection, right?

49:33.444 --> 49:34.464
That's what he's arguing.

49:34.604 --> 49:35.685
But here's the key.

49:36.185 --> 49:43.129
Because flu virus is a negative-stranded RNA, then you also have to have the enzyme inside.

49:43.189 --> 49:47.192
If you don't have the enzyme inside, then you don't have an infectious particle.

49:47.232 --> 49:52.615
That's not a problem for coronaviruses because coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA.

49:53.820 --> 50:13.397
And so again, what I'm just trying to show you is that this is a pretty fundamental difference between the way RNA flu viruses are purported to create and maintain an infectious cycle and the way that coronaviruses are supposed to

50:15.327 --> 50:18.168
initiate and maintain an infectious cycle.

50:18.368 --> 50:19.648
It's very, very different.

50:20.169 --> 50:33.713
And the recombination mechanism by which the RNA is done, remember what I'm saying is if this is a 30,000 base pair genome, and this is a 30,000 base pair genome, and you get this far copying it,

50:35.532 --> 50:48.059
and then you jump down here to a random spot on another genome, the odds of you ending up with the equivalent of an entire genome over here when you're done are almost zero.

50:49.780 --> 51:00.707
Because you're gonna be jumping from a very specific spot on genome number one to a random spot on genome number two and the resulting

51:02.145 --> 51:04.246
It's not going to be great most of the time.

51:04.286 --> 51:08.309
You can just do it in your imagination, but it's also statistically provable.

51:09.330 --> 51:16.175
Recombination doesn't help the infectious cycle with infectivity or with replication competence.

51:16.295 --> 51:17.315
No, it doesn't at all.

51:18.636 --> 51:29.604
And it further complicates this admission of Robert Malone in 2021, where he said the vast majority of coronavirus particles during infection are not replication competent.

51:30.711 --> 51:31.934
That's a huge problem.

51:32.575 --> 51:38.327
And it suggests a different biology is involved here.

51:38.368 --> 51:40.652
And indeed, it could be that our normal

51:41.954 --> 51:47.656
exosomic communication is being hijacked by a foreign RNA for a brief period of time.

51:47.676 --> 51:48.497
That's possible.

51:49.097 --> 52:01.501
But in that scenario, none of the limitations of that are acknowledged because if they would be acknowledged, then they would undermine the illusion, which is, well, of course, pandemic potential, right?

52:01.521 --> 52:04.823
We're trying to create the illusion of pandemic potential.

52:04.863 --> 52:07.744
So we got to get rid of all of these complications

52:08.524 --> 52:17.634
which would, by any biological estimation, in reality, it would just make pandemics a ridiculous notion.

52:18.855 --> 52:19.856
RNA can't do that.

52:21.458 --> 52:23.480
They also can undergo modular evolution.

52:23.540 --> 52:29.487
That means genes can be shuffled, or critical virulence motifs can be shuffled between strains.

52:31.067 --> 52:33.388
Okay, so they can change quite quickly.

52:34.189 --> 52:42.634
And then if you look at the virus particle, you see these projections on the surface that give the particle a corona or a halo-like appearance in the electron microscope.

52:43.174 --> 52:44.855
That's the spike glycoprotein.

52:46.476 --> 52:47.736
It's a large glycoprotein.

52:48.197 --> 52:50.178
This is the actual structure of that protein.

52:53.278 --> 53:01.260
And it tolerates high rates of mutation, and I'll show you a picture of the amount of variation that exists within the SARS-like viruses in a little bit later.

53:01.760 --> 53:07.683
There can be big deletions, over 100 amino acids can be removed and the virus spike genes can tolerate it.

53:09.923 --> 53:14.225
Parts of the protein can be recombined into other coronavirus spikes.

53:15.396 --> 53:22.001
And the shuffling of sequences regulates host range, tissue tropism, transmissibility, and to some extent, virulence.

53:22.562 --> 53:27.245
Now it's interesting because this data would all be derived from PCR data.

53:27.285 --> 53:37.834
So they would PCR and sequence and find variability most often in the spike protein and then claim that that's evidence that it tolerates the variability.

53:38.806 --> 53:48.690
But if you go back to the fundamental observation of whatever these RNA viruses are doing, they end up producing a lot of subgenomic RNA.

53:48.731 --> 53:55.313
And the most abundant subgenomic RNA by several orders of magnitude is the spike protein.

53:55.353 --> 53:57.314
Now, again, roll back.

53:57.434 --> 54:00.236
Make sure that you have all the tools in the toolbox in the right place.

54:01.056 --> 54:02.537
we're still copying RNA.

54:02.977 --> 54:10.399
So if you're making lots of copies of the spike protein RNA, number one, I don't know how that's regulated and why that occurs, but that's what happens.

54:10.880 --> 54:16.201
You get hundreds of thousands of copies and all of those can potentially have errors in it.

54:16.642 --> 54:28.606
Now, is the evidence that the spike protein gene tolerates a lot of errors the result of their observation that there's a lot of this RNA and it's very variable?

54:29.560 --> 54:33.501
I think that's the most likely solution, the most likely assumption here.

54:35.582 --> 54:42.023
And instead, he's again trying to create the illusion of pandemic potential out of every observation that we have.

54:42.643 --> 54:48.665
And the observation that we have all of this subgenomic RNA dominated by spike protein

54:50.822 --> 55:05.845
is being misconstrued as a biological evidence of a phenomenon where the viral spike protein can tolerate lots of mutations and deletions, and we can substitute different parts and blah, blah, blah, and it all seems to work.

55:08.046 --> 55:15.147
It's extraordinary, because he's not telling you that certain parts of the spike protein need to be conserved.

55:15.787 --> 55:19.168
He's telling you that other parts of the spike protein don't need to be conserved.

55:19.958 --> 55:21.159
aren't so tied down.

55:23.620 --> 55:30.305
And of course, this comes from many, many, many years of research that spans all the way back to Robert Gary.

55:33.271 --> 55:40.136
who was making small proteins that could inhibit these, these, I don't know what you want to call them.

55:41.497 --> 55:46.681
At the time he called them fusion proteins, but that wasn't, that wasn't aggressive and weaponized enough.

55:46.701 --> 55:59.971
So now they call them spike proteins, but Robert Gary was calling them fusion proteins and fusion proteins are a general, you know, phenomenon in biology recognized across a lot of different viruses and certainly across all Corona viruses.

56:00.012 --> 56:03.114
And there's a, there's a common protein motif there.

56:05.512 --> 56:13.218
And so if these phenomenon are a background signal that we become tolerant to by the age of five,

56:14.594 --> 56:23.561
and some of these stories of virology are real, it is that some of these phenomenon are generalized, like the fusion protein.

56:23.581 --> 56:43.158
Of course, if exosomes are something that we are shedding actively as a biological signal, or as a biological repellent, or as a biological screen or filter, then it's gonna have some shared mechanisms that'll work, that can allow that to happen.

56:44.315 --> 56:55.585
this all would make sense, a lot more sense than portraying these signals as RNA hijacking our cells and making them do something they don't already do.

56:57.987 --> 57:05.433
So a lot of capacity to change themselves in natural situations.

57:07.174 --> 57:11.418
Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about SAR, capacity to change themselves

57:14.136 --> 57:15.657
in natural situations.

57:17.418 --> 57:19.239
Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about SARS.

57:19.459 --> 57:26.983
I don't know how many are familiar with a phylogenetic tree, but this is just a way to look at the relatedness between strains.

57:28.343 --> 57:34.426
The state of knowledge before 2019 was that there are a few out there in the bats.

57:34.647 --> 57:35.087
That's it.

57:35.287 --> 57:36.107
That's all we got.

57:36.568 --> 57:42.751
And the 2003 epidemic basically did this, I guess, which is extraordinary.

57:45.070 --> 57:46.491
It's pretty extraordinary.

57:48.172 --> 57:51.815
I don't know, where is the, oh, this is the 2003 epidemic in yellow.

57:52.635 --> 57:55.918
And these are bat coronaviruses that have similar potential.

57:55.958 --> 57:56.818
Let's let him talk.

57:57.419 --> 58:00.321
So SARS coronavirus emerged in 2003.

58:00.701 --> 58:01.582
It came from bats.

58:02.542 --> 58:08.427
And it circulated in open markets through civets as an intermediate, which were used as a food source in China.

58:09.688 --> 58:11.189
All of these strains here in yellow

58:12.239 --> 58:15.041
are strains that were associated with that 2003 outbreak.

58:15.502 --> 58:18.204
Human strains, civet strains, raccoon dog strains.

58:19.725 --> 58:23.989
That's what was circulating that was involved in infecting 8,000 people.

58:26.071 --> 58:30.875
Over the next 17 years, we sequenced coronaviruses in bats.

58:32.329 --> 58:34.510
And we found the dark red ones up there and the light.

58:34.530 --> 58:35.830
Well, that was a weird way of saying it.

58:35.870 --> 58:38.571
We sequence coronaviruses in bats.

58:38.611 --> 58:39.751
How many did you sequence?

58:39.811 --> 58:46.314
Why didn't you sequence coronaviruses in kids since the kids are all infected with these by the time they're age five?

58:46.854 --> 58:50.115
Why don't we know more about the endemic coronaviruses?

58:50.895 --> 58:53.456
Why don't we know more about the endemic coronaviruses?

58:53.536 --> 58:59.038
Why are we paying attention to these SARS viruses when apparently,

58:59.878 --> 59:09.003
There are four endemic coronaviruses that are infecting little kids before age five all the time that we could be studying their evolution or lack of evolution.

59:09.063 --> 59:11.044
Like, wow, it's extraordinary to me.

59:12.245 --> 59:13.206
Red ones down here.

59:13.506 --> 59:18.008
The dark red ones are strains that are about 10% different.

59:19.810 --> 59:32.760
than SARS, but can grow in human cells, they can use human receptors, and they have all the properties that would make them pre-epidemic strains, or strains that could immediately flip over and infect human populations.

59:34.281 --> 59:38.464
The light red ones down here can't, and I'll show you how that is tested.

59:40.826 --> 59:42.968
SARS-2 also originated from bats,

59:44.974 --> 59:46.357
But it's nowhere on this list.

59:47.540 --> 59:51.048
But he says that recombination during a co-infection is 25%.

59:54.489 --> 59:55.951
of the viruses produced.

59:56.051 --> 01:00:10.464
So if the bats that have between six and eight viruses in them are constantly recombining, then even a phylogenetic tree like this is but a very short change snapshot of whatever is actually going on.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:15.829
If you just go to the logical conclusions of their claims, it's so extraordinary.

01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:17.570
You really got to be a gap mouth

01:00:18.271 --> 01:00:29.874
drooler and just absorbing what this amazing man says and not questioning or thinking about the implications of it at all in order not to hear how much bullshit is coming out right now.

01:00:30.515 --> 01:00:30.815
Tree.

01:00:31.775 --> 01:00:32.995
I'll show you where it is later.

01:00:33.635 --> 01:00:39.477
It's a totally different clade of SARS-related viruses from anything we'd seen before in the past.

01:00:41.358 --> 01:00:45.419
And it also was associated with open markets, but that's debatable.

01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:49.988
So SARS, there are two models to explain that outbreak.

01:00:50.949 --> 01:00:55.712
The closest strain is a bat virus called WIV-16, which is about 98% identical.

01:00:56.092 --> 01:01:00.255
In other words, about 600 nucleotide changes across the 30,000 nucleotide genome.

01:01:01.676 --> 01:01:06.419
It could have transmitted directly to humans in the open market, which then spread to civets and then back to humans.

01:01:06.479 --> 01:01:14.424
And as it went back and forth and back and forth, you selected for strains that were about 99.5% identical that were associated with the expanding outbreak.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:24.349
The other model is that bats could have infected the intermediate host, then those could have infected humans, and that set up a transmission cycle.

01:01:24.529 --> 01:01:25.229
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:25.949
Both are possible.

01:01:26.429 --> 01:01:27.770
Both are possible.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:38.253
What you hear the Chinese say about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is that there had to be some intermediate host that transmitted to humans.

01:01:38.313 --> 01:01:39.693
And that's not actually the case.

01:01:39.753 --> 01:01:41.734
It could be direct bat to human transmission.

01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:51.509
So you're supposed to hear somebody who's at the center of a debate trying to understand a biological phenomenon, and that is at the heart of the illusion.

01:01:51.569 --> 01:02:00.797
That whole idea that Ralph Baric is at the cutting edge of understanding an ongoing biological phenomenon that we've just scratched the surface of,

01:02:01.637 --> 01:02:07.519
is the illusion that this national security operation is dependent upon.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:17.863
If that illusion and the whole career of Ralph Baric didn't exist, then there would be no reason to have the biosecurity state that we have.

01:02:17.983 --> 01:02:18.704
None at all.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:24.386
Even though I think whatever they say was there was before they said it was there.

01:02:25.146 --> 01:02:26.987
And we were fine not knowing about it.

01:02:27.168 --> 01:02:30.730
Now that we know about it, the national security state exists.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:31.731
And how do we know about it?

01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:33.932
Really because of Ralph Baric.

01:02:33.952 --> 01:02:40.397
There aren't very many other coronavirus biologists that work on their pandemic potential.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.718
Not even Stanley Perlman.

01:02:43.979 --> 01:02:44.900
It's extraordinary.

01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:59.996
OK, so it's really just Nathan Wolfe, Peter Daszak and Ralph Baric, who are probably just three sides of the same national security narrative curation team.

01:03:00.616 --> 01:03:01.497
They work for them.

01:03:01.598 --> 01:03:02.058
That's it.

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:06.383
And as long as those three guys agree to this, do the same shtick.

01:03:08.894 --> 01:03:20.260
And as long as Jikki Leaks decides that those are the three guys we have to focus on, it couldn't possibly be Robert Malone or Pierre Kory, then this is gonna go on forever.

01:03:22.862 --> 01:03:26.864
The SARS coronavirus outbreak went extinct around 2003, 2004.

01:03:28.325 --> 01:03:30.606
But is it extinct or is it still present in bats?

01:03:31.907 --> 01:03:36.590
And what's the relative threat level of these bat viruses that are SARS-like?

01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:38.830
Are they dangerous to human health?

01:03:40.611 --> 01:03:44.074
And so one of the things that we do in the laboratory is called reverse genetics.

01:03:45.295 --> 01:03:47.376
So coronaviruses have an RNA genome.

01:03:48.377 --> 01:03:57.243
You can make a DNA copy of that genome and then change it however you want and then recover the virus in the laboratory, okay?

01:03:58.164 --> 01:04:00.005
So in this case, you can remove a copy.

01:04:01.146 --> 01:04:04.589
And so one of the things that we do in the laboratory is called reverse genetics.

01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:07.900
So coronaviruses have an RNA genome.

01:04:08.901 --> 01:04:16.406
You can make a DNA copy of that genome and then change it however you want and then recover the virus in the laboratory.

01:04:17.446 --> 01:04:17.706
Okay?

01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:22.689
Recover the virus means transfect or transform cell cultures and collect it.

01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:26.412
That's what it means.

01:04:26.472 --> 01:04:33.156
So you make a molecular clone using recombinant DNA, reverse genetics,

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:42.245
And then you recover full length virus by making synthesizing full length genomes, you see.

01:04:43.809 --> 01:05:02.022
And yet he just got done explaining to you that synthesizing full length genomes is actually something that coronaviruses are very specialized in doing and can adjust their fidelity of, of, of synthesizing full length genomes, depending on whether they need more mutations or not.

01:05:02.683 --> 01:05:09.828
And they even can recombine up to 25% of the time and still make full length genomes.

01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:14.143
That's where Kevin McKernan comes in.

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:20.544
That's why Kevin McKernan had to stream with me a few times before he finally had to block me on Twitter and call me an idiot.

01:05:21.504 --> 01:05:22.645
Because this is the trick.

01:05:22.725 --> 01:05:23.905
This is the secret.

01:05:25.545 --> 01:05:32.407
That you can't get full length genomes in quantity any other way.

01:05:35.128 --> 01:05:39.629
Not if you had a whole cave full of bats and then fed them pure virus.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:51.140
from extracted from their feces, you could never get full length viral genomes in a pure quantity ever.

01:05:52.123 --> 01:06:02.168
Never, ever, because of recombination, because of the lack of fidelity of copying RNA, and because of a million different other reasons, you just can't.

01:06:02.609 --> 01:06:04.049
They've never been able to do it.

01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:14.355
But one of the things we do in our laboratory is we make synthesized full-length genomes and then use those to recover full-length virus.

01:06:16.027 --> 01:06:17.148
It's ridiculous.

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:19.650
They're telling you right here.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:37.763
It's transformation and transfection to synthesized full length genomes that we would have no other way of obtaining and no other way of producing in a quantity that we could detect.

01:06:40.632 --> 01:06:43.314
And so, yeah, do viruses exist?

01:06:43.974 --> 01:06:44.695
We don't know.

01:06:45.455 --> 01:06:53.381
The best we can do is detect short sequences with PCR and then synthesize them assuming they're full genomes.

01:06:54.682 --> 01:06:55.542
That's all they can do.

01:06:56.743 --> 01:06:57.544
That's all they can do.

01:06:57.584 --> 01:06:58.504
That's all they can do.

01:06:58.545 --> 01:06:59.505
That's all they can do.

01:06:59.565 --> 01:07:08.852
And if you realize that they're talking about signals that are made by the bats, they're talking about signals that are made by us,

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:14.344
then that's where this lie becomes extraordinary.

01:07:24.951 --> 01:07:26.372
Are they dangerous to human health?

01:07:28.133 --> 01:07:31.596
And so one of the things that we do in the laboratory is called reverse genetics.

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.898
So coronaviruses have an RNA genome.

01:07:35.899 --> 01:07:38.000
You can make a DNA copy of that genome.

01:07:39.175 --> 01:07:43.378
and then change it however you want, and then recover the virus in the laboratory.

01:07:45.659 --> 01:08:02.590
So in this case, you can remove the spike glycoprotein of the 2003 SARS strain, and drop in spike genes from these other bat strains, and then ask the question, are any of these capable of replicating in human cells?

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:06.793
And the answer is, the top three, WIV1,

01:08:09.356 --> 01:08:16.960
SHC014, these two up here, and another one called WIV16, can grow just fine on primary human airway epithelial cells.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.362
Now, what these are is the transplant recipients.

01:08:20.402 --> 01:08:21.963
The discarded lung is taken.

01:08:22.003 --> 01:08:26.426
You can take the cells out of the conducting airways and grow them in the culture.

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:32.589
So it's, in essence, a replica, as close as we can, of what the human airway looks like.

01:08:33.389 --> 01:08:36.091
And then you can ask the question, can that virus grow in it?

01:08:37.202 --> 01:08:42.773
And these viruses replicate in those primary cells, which are shown right here, just as well as SARS can.

01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:49.914
They also use the human receptor, just like SARS, and they can use the bat and the civet receptors.

01:08:49.954 --> 01:08:55.017
So there's no reason why those strains couldn't actually spill into humans and cause an outbreak of disease.

01:08:56.238 --> 01:09:09.847
Now the question is, should we inspect those papers to find out if they're just transfecting a cell culture and passaging, and then at the end looking for signals that indicate that the transfection made it to the passage eight or whatever?

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:14.209
or three, because that's not evidence of replication.

01:09:14.249 --> 01:09:16.716
That could just be evidence of ongoing transfection.

01:09:17.702 --> 01:09:29.032
and it's not evidence of infection, it's ongoing transfection and whether or not that RNA can replicate itself to enough to be found over there or whether the dilution occurs.

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:37.459
No quantifications are being made to show you the relative fidelity of replication or the relative rate of replication.

01:09:38.019 --> 01:09:44.165
None of those measurements are being made, just proxy measurements that show the presence of something.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.263
And that's how they did it with AIDS as well.

01:09:47.303 --> 01:09:54.226
The presence of reverse transcriptase activity was sufficient to indicate the presence of HIV.

01:09:54.807 --> 01:10:07.393
And here we have a scenario where a lot of these gain-of-function or pandemic potential papers are using molecular correlates that don't really adequately differentiate between

01:10:07.973 --> 01:10:26.206
the resultant of transfection or transformation to these cloned molecules, or the bona fide replication of those molecules, packaging of those molecules, and then the repackaging of those molecules by other cells, which is a very, very different thing.

01:10:26.826 --> 01:10:28.827
Well, their strains are not viable, so they're dead.

01:10:30.489 --> 01:10:35.192
So in reality, what's happened, the situation in nature is as follows.

01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:43.763
We have a reservoir of SARS-like bat coronaviruses that exist in bats.

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:47.504
And this heterogeneous pool can be up to 35% different.

01:10:48.904 --> 01:11:04.089
Don't forget that this is just a very complicated molecular biological story that is exactly the same as the story told in Man and His Future, the book and the chapter written by Hilary Kaprowski.

01:11:07.793 --> 01:11:12.935
That it's the exact same thing, viruses from bats, before we even really knew a lot about it.

01:11:13.455 --> 01:11:15.295
This is just a continuation of it.

01:11:15.596 --> 01:11:25.119
The exact, I mean exact same story that was told by Alison Totura and Sina Bavari in their 2019 coronavirus review.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:34.782
And you can believe if you want to that that has nothing to do with a national security state that would like to enslave our kids.

01:11:35.663 --> 01:11:46.890
You can believe it has to do with the genuine biologists and virologists of Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak and Ralph Baric and Tony Fauci or

01:11:48.069 --> 01:12:08.495
You can pull your head out and realize that it only takes those four guys agreeing about this and using slides like this, and they are just part of a continuous intellectual chain of bad ideas that starts at Hilary Koprowski and goes all the way through to Ralph Baric.

01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:30.057
And somewhere in that tangled mess of intellectual vines, you can find people like David Baltimore, and Bob Gallo, and Murray Gardner, and Judy Mikovits, and Rischetti, and Malone, and all of them, all the way down to Paul Offit.

01:12:33.618 --> 01:12:38.059
The brick wall is visible and the smell that you smell is wet bricks.

01:12:38.219 --> 01:12:39.020
They're right there.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.881
Like if somebody hits you in the back of the head, you're going to break your nose.

01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:45.382
That's how close we are to the brick wall right now.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:54.185
And that's why it's useful to go back to 2020 and see what Ralph Baric said and didn't say, because the narrative is right here for you.

01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:56.925
It is a national security narrative.

01:12:57.065 --> 01:12:58.646
It is not real biology.

01:13:01.064 --> 01:13:05.127
Some of those are high risk, some of those are low risk.

01:13:05.727 --> 01:13:12.351
In 2003, SARS emerged and caused 8,000 cases and about 800 deaths with a 10% mortality rate.

01:13:13.792 --> 01:13:19.316
The prediction is that these high risk strains could emerge in the future to cause future outbreaks.

01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:21.197
I'm going to speed it up a little bit.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:25.520
In 2019, SARS coronavirus 2 emerged, which was 22% different than SARS.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:39.666
It has caused 81,000 cases across the globe with 2,700 deaths in over 40 countries.

01:13:40.286 --> 01:13:42.648
There is ongoing human-to-human transmission.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:49.092
It's been stopped in the U.S., Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea.

01:13:49.775 --> 01:13:57.059
So it's moving towards where we would call the definition of continuous spread.

01:13:57.079 --> 01:14:02.542
It has caused 81,000 cases across the globe with 2,700 deaths in over 40 countries.

01:14:02.982 --> 01:14:06.564
There is ongoing human-to-human transmission in Germany.

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:11.126
It's been stopped in the US, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea.

01:14:11.727 --> 01:14:15.829
So it's moving towards where we would call the definition of continuous spread.

01:14:16.617 --> 01:14:18.918
on two different continents, which is the definition of a pandemic.

01:14:19.098 --> 01:14:22.660
I think I gotta slow it back down because I want you to hear that the way it was.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.620
Now, keep in mind that this is 22%.

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:28.562
There's still other strains within this pool that could emerge in the future.

01:14:28.742 --> 01:14:30.163
That was extraordinary, actually.

01:14:30.183 --> 01:14:32.404
It has caused 81,000 cases across the globe with 2,700 deaths in over 40 countries.

01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:34.404
There is ongoing human-to-human transmission.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:51.159
in Germany, it's been stopped in the US, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.504
So it's moving towards where we would call a definition of continuous spread.

01:14:57.524 --> 01:15:01.748
It's stopped in the United States.

01:15:02.088 --> 01:15:04.630
I don't think he feels very comfortable with what he's doing.

01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:07.853
His glasses are falling off of his nose because he's sweating.

01:15:07.993 --> 01:15:10.675
Vietnam, China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea.

01:15:11.636 --> 01:15:21.224
So it's moving towards where we would call a definition of continuous spread on two different continents, which is the definition of a pandemic.

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.026
So we're approaching that.

01:15:26.268 --> 01:15:29.251
Now keep in mind that this is 22%.

01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:32.874
There's still other strains within this pool that could emerge in the future.

01:15:34.309 --> 01:15:38.851
Even if SARS-Coronavirus-2 goes away, we will still be at risk for these kind of viruses.

01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:46.374
And so you need to think about it like, I know people don't do encyclopedias anymore, so I apologize.

01:15:47.754 --> 01:15:53.876
But you have to think about it like an encyclopedia of volumes that have 0% variation to about 35%.

01:15:54.697 --> 01:16:03.100
So now again, we're focusing exclusively on the spike protein, the spike glycoprotein, one of 30-odd proteins that

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:09.205
that virologists like Robert Malone will tell you that each one of those proteins has like four different functions.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:27.741
And so the spike protein was characterized very early on by people like Kevin McCairn and Walter Chestnut, who's been on my stream multiple times as being this crazy sort of Swiss army knife protein toxin kind of thing.

01:16:29.071 --> 01:16:44.415
And here Ralph Baric is exclusively focused on the spike protein before any of that nonsense started, before McCairn had said that it's going to be neurotropic, that there were HIV inserts according to an Indian paper that got retracted or whatever.

01:16:44.915 --> 01:16:46.876
Like all of that stuff is coming still.

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:58.414
And already we're focusing on the spike protein because broad-based vaccines are based on the spike protein, even though it can tolerate so much variation.

01:16:58.934 --> 01:17:10.419
Human monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs all focused on the spike protein, even though he told us in the beginning that one of the interesting targets would be the XON gene.

01:17:11.219 --> 01:17:15.963
and replication competence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex.

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:17.064
It's interesting.

01:17:17.204 --> 01:17:37.721
It's really interesting that we fool around with the spike protein over and over and over again, that the gain-of-function protein that supposedly would be insertion of a second fear in cleavage site, according to the champion Charles Rixey, is what resulted in it being the most infectious virus in human history, and insisted on it

01:17:41.058 --> 01:17:46.499
And so there's a narrative being curated here that focuses on the spike protein exclusively.

01:17:46.879 --> 01:18:08.464
And that narrative is then picked up and ran with by people like Kevin McCairn, Charles Rixey, Richard Fleming, Jessica Rose, Walter Chestnut, who all wittingly or unwittingly by being encouraged by each other or by a few meddlers to focus on the spike protein as evidence that this was a laboratory virus.

01:18:08.504 --> 01:18:09.384
And so here we are,

01:18:09.864 --> 01:18:12.586
We're on that train, we're going on the Scooby-Doo together.

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:25.618
And it shouldn't be very surprising that alongside all of these meddlers was the king meddler, king clone himself, Ralph Baric.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:27.860
Some variation.

01:18:29.161 --> 01:18:30.602
Some of these volumes are high risk.

01:18:32.748 --> 01:18:39.953
And they're shown there, SARS-WIV-16, WIV-1, SHSCO-14, and the 2019 novel coronavirus.

01:18:40.153 --> 01:18:41.634
They all have high-risk features.

01:18:42.295 --> 01:18:44.897
They use the same human receptor to infect the lung.

01:18:44.997 --> 01:18:47.158
High-risk features is just an enchantment.

01:18:47.198 --> 01:18:54.964
What does that mean, other than to scare the audience and to think that there's just yet another concept that you aren't sophisticated enough to understand?

01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:57.826
But thank goodness we have experts like Ralph Baric.

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:00.408
That, of course, people like Jiki

01:19:01.755 --> 01:19:12.063
And Robert Malone and all of these lab leak people want you to believe is the bad guy responsible for these molecular techniques.

01:19:12.643 --> 01:19:13.403
Stop lying!

01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:18.067
They all grow great on primary human cells.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:26.093
They cause ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, which I'll show you a picture of what that looks like, which is what is killing people.

01:19:29.013 --> 01:19:37.579
Acute respiratory distress syndrome can also be very easily inducted using supplementary oxygen at too high of a level.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.701
And that is well known.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:45.505
And the ones that are boxed or in animals, the ones that are not.

01:19:46.903 --> 01:19:51.405
If you are older, you are at much seriously increased risk for disease.

01:19:52.226 --> 01:19:56.148
The over mortality rate for SARS and MERS was 10 and 35%.

01:19:57.389 --> 01:20:02.351
But if you're over 60, the mortality rate goes to above 50 and above 75%.

01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:06.033
And especially males are vulnerable.

01:20:07.194 --> 01:20:14.478
So I don't know whether to be glad I'm studying this or whether I feel kind of like I'm a sentinel or something.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:18.200
But anyway, this is the threat level.

01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:19.421
These are the strains.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:35.335
And one of the things that we're doing in the lab is by resurrecting these strains in our laboratory, we now have a platform to test broad-based vaccines, human monoclonal antibodies, and drugs that not only protect against the bookends, the human strains, but anything that might emerge in the future.

01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:46.547
Solar Fire, I would say to you that coronaviruses aren't the only virus with spike proteins because viruses aren't real.

01:20:46.767 --> 01:20:47.867
Exosomes are real.

01:20:47.987 --> 01:20:52.328
And exosomes all have the requirement of a fusion protein.

01:20:52.368 --> 01:20:57.369
They have to have a fusion protein or they wouldn't be able to send the signal that they're sending.

01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:59.130
And so you shouldn't see it

01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:13.377
as a generality across viruses, what you should see is that if this was a packet communication system that is utilized by all eukaryotes and maybe plants and animals alike,

01:21:16.095 --> 01:21:22.500
then that system would have a universal mechanism by which you cross membranes or get membrane fusion.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:38.131
And although there would be variation across species and even across conspecifics, you would expect there to be some general mechanism by which a small membrane-bound organelle could bind with a larger membrane-bound organelle.

01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:41.314
And that universal mechanism is definitely real.

01:21:42.014 --> 01:21:55.024
The issue is whether that constitutes virology or whether that constitutes exosomal communication and endogenous biology of our own.

01:21:56.885 --> 01:21:59.087
Now, it's not just specific for SARS.

01:22:00.508 --> 01:22:04.951
If you look at MERS coronavirus that is currently causing an ongoing outbreak,

01:22:05.711 --> 01:22:09.154
with 35% mortality in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the Middle East.

01:22:10.154 --> 01:22:21.403
We have MERS at one end of the encyclopedia and a Chinese strain called 422, which is 35% different in its spike glycoprotein.

01:22:22.564 --> 01:22:25.747
It can still use the MERS receptor for docking and entry.

01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:29.730
It grows fine on all the primary human cells that MERS targets.

01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:34.674
Although our intervention strategies are focused on MERS,

01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:38.765
coronavirus emergence in human populations.

01:22:40.026 --> 01:22:43.526
The classic model for viral emergence was that you had this tsunami.

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:52.508
Remember, we're talking about these cartoons in the context of 1,300 bats with six to eight variables.

01:22:53.228 --> 01:22:57.329
And those variables recombine at a 25% rate during co-infection.

01:22:57.809 --> 01:23:00.330
And there's an error rate that's controlled by exo-AN.

01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:01.550
But then now, here we go.

01:23:02.366 --> 01:23:07.670
Here we can make an even more simplified cartoon about how they change and how they get back to humans or whatever.

01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:10.313
And this, again, is just bamboozlement.

01:23:10.393 --> 01:23:11.554
It's just enchantment.

01:23:12.094 --> 01:23:13.495
This is not real biology.

01:23:13.535 --> 01:23:14.676
It's not real science.

01:23:14.776 --> 01:23:17.398
I mean, he's using little circles and arrows.

01:23:17.478 --> 01:23:17.859
Come on.

01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:22.723
I just want to get to the point where we...

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:25.330
He might mention something.

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:25.691
Oh yeah.

01:23:25.711 --> 01:23:30.072
So here's the story about, you know, we got five isolates here.

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:41.095
Um, person to person spread identified, uh, in January, you know, this is really seeding the narrative of the pandemic to come.

01:23:42.296 --> 01:23:43.536
It's going to keep going here.

01:23:43.576 --> 01:23:45.557
I don't, I, maybe we should listen to this.

01:23:45.677 --> 01:23:46.037
I don't know.

01:23:46.697 --> 01:23:49.638
Farming communities in close proximity to bat hibernacula.

01:23:50.421 --> 01:23:52.842
could have been infected with a bat, coronaviruses.

01:23:53.142 --> 01:23:53.842
It's the outbreak.

01:23:53.882 --> 01:24:02.264
So there's a couple of different hypotheses floating around, which- What's a couple of different hypotheses that would include a lab leak if you guys weren't covering it up?

01:24:03.024 --> 01:24:06.065
That's the narrative that's gonna be fueled right after this.

01:24:06.105 --> 01:24:08.386
You see how enticing it is?

01:24:10.677 --> 01:24:11.718
So he's justifying the market.

01:24:25.569 --> 01:24:30.172
are used in certain delicacy dishes, and also used in medicinal medicines.

01:24:30.292 --> 01:24:32.774
Oh, yeah, bushmeat, just like Brett Weinstein said.

01:24:32.814 --> 01:24:34.696
So, you know, he's giving you the natural side.

01:24:34.716 --> 01:24:37.077
And so there's a kissing cousin of SARS.

01:24:37.117 --> 01:24:38.478
I'll show you where it sits in a minute.

01:24:38.939 --> 01:24:40.860
They publish each respective nation.

01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:52.088
Around the 20th, they reported a major, I'll talk, the major characteristics of SARS, MERS, and SARS coronavirus 2.

01:24:52.388 --> 01:24:53.949
It's a good way for you to understand

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:59.767
why this thing is so much larger in scope than anything we've seen in the past.

01:25:00.027 --> 01:25:05.972
Oh, so now he's going to explain why the past ones didn't make it, but this one, this one's going to be a lot bigger.

01:25:10.436 --> 01:25:13.458
So the first, let's just look at the number of countries involved.

01:25:13.478 --> 01:25:18.442
There's over 40 countries affected with SARS coronavirus two, about 28, 29 with MERS and SARS coronavirus.

01:25:21.853 --> 01:25:28.918
The number of cases for SARS-Coronavirus-2 far exceeds both the SARS outbreak and the MERS outbreak.

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:33.781
Mortality rate is about two to 3%, and I'm gonna talk about this in a minute.

01:25:34.302 --> 01:25:41.887
There are currently about 9,000 cases that are under critical care, meaning that they're probably getting some form of respiratory support.

01:25:43.308 --> 01:25:48.732
It's about 18 to 19% of the people develop really serious disease that require respiratory support.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.862
About 83% of the cases are mild or asymptomatic.

01:25:52.882 --> 01:25:56.144
It means you can be infected with this virus and not know it.

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.706
And that makes it difficult to control.

01:26:00.326 --> 01:26:01.467
Asymptomatic spread.

01:26:01.487 --> 01:26:05.669
I don't know how loud that is.

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:06.950
That's all right.

01:26:09.072 --> 01:26:10.112
Asymptomatic spread.

01:26:10.813 --> 01:26:11.473
Unbelievable.

01:26:14.655 --> 01:26:17.857
The mortality rate bounces around depending on who you talk to.

01:26:21.452 --> 01:26:29.135
2 to 3% is probably not a bad estimate, but the mortality rate in Wuhan was about 4.1%, 2.8% in a different part of the country.

01:26:29.155 --> 01:26:30.735
It's 0.17 to 1% in different areas of the world.

01:26:30.755 --> 01:26:33.977
Probably the best way to get an estimate of the mortality.

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:46.352
Prion proteins supposedly don't change when you heat them, and they cannot be sterilized away with autoclaving.

01:26:46.392 --> 01:26:48.493
That's what they say.

01:26:48.513 --> 01:27:02.483
I don't have any personal experience to verify that, but that's one of the magic features of proteins, of prions, is that they are proteins that are so stable that you can't use, you can't denature them.

01:27:02.783 --> 01:27:03.704
It's extraordinary.

01:27:03.824 --> 01:27:08.087
The rate of this virus is from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

01:27:10.405 --> 01:27:19.649
where 3,600 people were sort of locked in a closed container with a highly contagious respiratory virus that could undergo fecal spread as well.

01:27:19.789 --> 01:27:23.191
So in that case, right now the mortality rate is about 0.6%.

01:27:23.431 --> 01:27:27.213
That is about 750 people that have been infected.

01:27:28.293 --> 01:27:36.257
Most of the epidemiologists I've talked to expect somewhere around 50% of the people will be infected, will have been infected in that cruise ship.

01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:41.263
About 36 are still under critical care.

01:27:41.363 --> 01:27:51.914
So whatever that number turns out to be is probably a pretty good estimate, keeping in mind that there's an age skewing toward older individuals on the cruise ship.

01:27:53.175 --> 01:28:00.002
So again, this is an example of a disease where it's good to be young and not so good to be old or male.

01:28:02.932 --> 01:28:05.034
The incubation period is two to 14 days.

01:28:05.734 --> 01:28:10.338
This is a real problem, because now if you're quarantining people, you have to keep them in quarantine for 14 days.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.700
SARS and MERS were much more limited.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:23.449
The RO rate, or the number of people that get infected from one infected person, for the 1918 flu, for example, was about 2.2 cases per every flu-infected individual.

01:28:24.289 --> 01:28:25.430
SARS was about 1.8 to 2.5.

01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:25.971
MERS is low.

01:28:30.874 --> 01:28:32.135
SARS-2 is around three.

01:28:32.616 --> 01:28:35.058
That means on average... Something is really wrong with this thing.

01:28:35.078 --> 01:28:37.640
I have to change something here.

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:42.224
Reconnect.

01:28:43.205 --> 01:28:44.265
Hopefully it'll reconnect.

01:28:48.569 --> 01:28:49.670
Yeah, there we go.

01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:50.631
Let's see if that works.

01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:00.530
One person will infect three people.

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:01.551
Wow, it's so bizarre.

01:29:01.591 --> 01:29:02.971
Something is really wrong with my keyboard here.

01:29:02.991 --> 01:29:06.552
And this makes it also difficult to control because you have to reduce that.

01:29:07.933 --> 01:29:09.994
Asymptomatic spread never occurred.

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:11.674
Never occurred with SARS.

01:29:12.695 --> 01:29:16.576
It does occur with MERS, and rarely, and that's one of the reasons why

01:29:18.342 --> 01:29:19.183
How do we know that?

01:29:19.904 --> 01:29:22.766
How do we prove that it didn't occur with MERS or SARS?

01:29:22.826 --> 01:29:25.368
Who were they testing and how did they prove that?

01:29:25.408 --> 01:29:26.269
You see what I mean?

01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:34.956
That's extraordinary because the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 spreads asymptomatically is thrown out there with an equal lack of data.

01:29:35.416 --> 01:29:42.502
Public health officials in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have trouble getting this thing under control because there's chains of transmission they can't track.

01:29:43.883 --> 01:29:45.224
But it's probably common.

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:48.251
with SARS-2.

01:29:49.211 --> 01:29:49.792
Why is that?

01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:50.912
We don't know.

01:29:51.933 --> 01:29:57.757
Most likely the virus is replicating in different individuals, either in the lower or the upper respiratory tract or in the nose.

01:29:58.621 --> 01:30:00.562
And this could allow for more efficient transmission.

01:30:01.222 --> 01:30:05.323
Oh, it's just, you know, the trend, it's all about replication and replication.

01:30:05.363 --> 01:30:07.324
We just, he just explained to you how it works.

01:30:07.404 --> 01:30:12.686
And so if it's replicating in the wrong place or too fast, then that's how it happens.

01:30:13.206 --> 01:30:17.167
And this was the biology that we were all supposed to argue about in 2020.

01:30:17.608 --> 01:30:24.670
And we did, I argued about it and read about it and read about it and read about it and read about it.

01:30:25.762 --> 01:30:29.847
That's how I became an armchair expert in basic immunology.

01:30:30.808 --> 01:30:32.891
How I discovered Stanley Perlman's work.

01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:35.874
How I realized that T-cells were paramount.

01:30:36.275 --> 01:30:45.426
How I understood the order of activation of the immune system was all because of videos like this where I was like, wait, what is going on here?

01:30:50.788 --> 01:30:54.011
If you were a mouse, I could tell you in detail why that is working.

01:30:54.151 --> 01:30:58.454
But nobody's a mouse here, so I can't tell that.

01:31:00.276 --> 01:31:03.819
The attack rate varies depending on the situation.

01:31:04.219 --> 01:31:15.569
But still, requiring temperatures above 900 degrees Fahrenheit is a very, very exceptional attribute to a protein.

01:31:15.589 --> 01:31:17.250
900 degrees Fahrenheit is several,

01:31:18.308 --> 01:31:21.570
you know, steps above the boiling point of water.

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:29.695
Proteins are supposed to be a biologically organic molecule that does its thing in water.

01:31:31.356 --> 01:31:36.579
So for me, it's, yeah, it's pretty amazing.

01:31:36.619 --> 01:31:45.305
I mean, we should harness this for some industrial applications where an incredibly heat-stable protein would be useful.

01:31:45.785 --> 01:31:47.246
But we don't do that now, do we?

01:31:48.482 --> 01:31:52.423
Now that should already say something to you.

01:31:53.423 --> 01:31:56.164
20 to 30% is probably pretty common.

01:31:56.564 --> 01:31:59.105
So those are the basic features of this.

01:31:59.405 --> 01:32:02.566
I guess there's 57 cases in the US, just to keep you updated.

01:32:03.166 --> 01:32:06.127
And I don't have the full state list shown, that's not correct.

01:32:07.107 --> 01:32:08.368
Okay, so why do people die?

01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:15.710
The major cause of death with SARS-2 is from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:32:17.446 --> 01:32:22.987
Imagine your lung as a set of tubes that go from big tubes to smaller tubes to smaller tubes.

01:32:23.547 --> 01:32:25.707
And they end with a balloon on the end of it.

01:32:26.388 --> 01:32:27.588
And that's your alveoli.

01:32:28.468 --> 01:32:29.168
It looks like this.

01:32:30.508 --> 01:32:35.049
And normally the alveoli is open and oxygen air is flowing back and forth.

01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:41.210
And oxygen transfers across the single cell layer into a capillary bed.

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:45.511
Imagine a capillary bed on the top of that balloon that you've just blown up.

01:32:48.094 --> 01:32:51.837
And oxygen is picked up by the red blood cells and so that oxygenates your tissue.

01:32:52.478 --> 01:33:07.451
So what happens with SARS and MERS and SARS-2 and high path avian flu strains, these viruses kill these cells that provide the support around the balloon on the surface and it perforates them.

01:33:08.432 --> 01:33:11.735
And so fluid pours across this capillary bed

01:33:12.617 --> 01:33:18.603
into the alveoli, and so the immediate acute cause of death is by drowning.

01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:21.705
Your lungs fill up and turn into a water balloon.

01:33:22.226 --> 01:33:25.109
Okay, so remdesivir can cause that to happen?

01:33:26.004 --> 01:33:31.848
because they decrease kidney function and so you can get water in your lungs and that can happen.

01:33:32.729 --> 01:33:38.854
And it can also happen because you use high flow oxygen inappropriately.

01:33:39.574 --> 01:33:42.757
So there are multiple ways to get to this general condition.

01:33:42.857 --> 01:33:46.820
It can even happen if you use a contaminated vaping product.

01:33:49.442 --> 01:33:50.843
It can happen if you put

01:33:51.812 --> 01:34:05.822
Apparently, according to, I won't even say, I did see something on Twitter the other day about using ice in smoking devices, and that can also cause ARDS.

01:34:05.882 --> 01:34:18.412
So, I mean, you're really here talking about a general phenomenon that he is trying to attribute exclusively to these viruses, and he's not being precise about it on purpose.

01:34:20.424 --> 01:34:34.569
He's not being precise about it as a, let's say, physiological stress point that a human can reach from a variety of different causes.

01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:47.013
But he's trying to tell you that ARDS is actually something that we specifically call the disease progression that's created by these respiratory viruses.

01:34:47.073 --> 01:34:48.574
And that's definitely not true.

01:34:51.107 --> 01:34:54.990
Now, in the repair process, hope this isn't too graphic.

01:34:56.491 --> 01:34:57.051
Might as well know.

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:10.181
In the repair process, you end up going through what's called a profibrotic response, and you start laying down fibroblasts along this balloon to repair the perforated holes.

01:35:11.323 --> 01:35:16.646
But in some people, it doesn't just lay down a few, it continues to lay down more and more layers.

01:35:17.286 --> 01:35:26.191
And so now you have a thick layer of cells and the oxygen can't diffuse through and you suffocate and you can die from this months after the virus has been cleared.

01:35:26.891 --> 01:35:31.653
So some of these patients will probably be on respiratory care for a couple of months.

01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:33.134
So this is a pretty brutal disease.

01:35:33.734 --> 01:35:40.618
Now you can imagine a scenario if they transfected your lungs with an immunogenic protein, the same exact thing would happen.

01:35:41.676 --> 01:35:47.401
If they sprayed a inhaled toxin into your lungs, the same thing might happen.

01:35:47.982 --> 01:35:59.152
It's just simply the breakdown of the alveolar epithelial layer and the leaking of liquid from the blood into the lungs.

01:35:59.732 --> 01:36:02.695
That can be caused by any number of things.

01:36:02.775 --> 01:36:07.839
Probably also in extreme cases, it could be caused by allergens that you're allergic to from plants.

01:36:07.959 --> 01:36:08.400
Why not?

01:36:10.233 --> 01:36:14.074
This is the fundamental lie that's being told here.

01:36:14.094 --> 01:36:33.082
He's trying to bamboozle the people that are listening and see this talk into believing that this is a series of symptoms that's very specific for a series of very specific viruses instead of a general phenomenon that can occur in a variety of situations where the lung is compromised.

01:36:33.142 --> 01:36:34.402
Do you see what I'm saying here?

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:36.183
1918 flu does this.

01:36:36.983 --> 01:36:38.264
About a million deaths per year.

01:36:39.204 --> 01:36:43.795
The federal government has spent millions of dollars trying to figure out ways to treat this illness.

01:36:45.239 --> 01:36:47.961
not only from viral infections, but mechanical things and others.

01:36:48.061 --> 01:36:52.163
So it's, it's just a, um, a very devastating end stage lung disease.

01:36:52.343 --> 01:36:52.524
There.

01:36:52.544 --> 01:36:54.225
He almost said it actually.

01:36:54.525 --> 01:36:55.265
He almost said it.

01:36:55.605 --> 01:36:58.347
Not only from viral infections, but mechanical things and others.

01:36:58.447 --> 01:37:02.570
So it's, it's just a, um, a very devastating end stage lung disease.

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:14.157
It's a very devastating end stage lung disease can, that can be reached within a few hours using high flow supplementary oxygen, nevermind high flow oxygen on a full mouth nose mask.

01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:22.414
He should say that because I think that's the way a lot of people were murdered in America.

01:37:23.955 --> 01:37:38.926
And the way that the progression of the disease in hospitals was essentially created under the priority of a national security narrative that needed to be accepted so that we would get maximum compliance when transfection was rolled out.

01:37:40.253 --> 01:37:50.700
perhaps transfection to the very immunogenic protein they claimed to have found in Wuhan and in the Sohomish County man in Washington State.

01:37:54.142 --> 01:37:56.083
Okay, so why could we control SARS?

01:37:57.264 --> 01:37:59.285
Well, SARS had three drivers to the outbreak.

01:37:59.325 --> 01:38:05.289
The first was he had civets and raccoon dogs in the marketplace that were infected that transmitted virus to people.

01:38:06.007 --> 01:38:13.052
Okay, so we're going to skip out of this now because I do think that we'll hear more of the same in this talk.

01:38:13.092 --> 01:38:18.756
And I do want to get to this keynote presentation, which is from two days ago.

01:38:19.176 --> 01:38:22.518
I don't think there are more than a hundred views on YouTube of this one.

01:38:22.818 --> 01:38:25.700
And so this one will be very interesting to hear.

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:28.842
Scheduled for what?

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:29.683
What would it say?

01:38:31.324 --> 01:38:32.405
I'll go back and pause it.

01:38:37.652 --> 01:38:40.193
July 13th in Los Angeles, see?

01:38:40.733 --> 01:38:43.014
So it is now the 23rd.

01:38:43.114 --> 01:38:46.136
I think it was only put up on YouTube where I got it two days ago.

01:38:46.176 --> 01:38:47.076
So let's listen to this.

01:38:52.578 --> 01:39:02.002
Hello everyone and welcome to today's keynote webinar titled SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Response Platforms for Pandemic Virus Control in the 21st Century.

01:39:02.022 --> 01:39:07.144
This webinar is a part of the Coronavirus Virtual Event Series, the seventh in the series.

01:39:08.194 --> 01:39:12.236
I'm Antonina Salcedo of LabRoots, and I'll be your moderator for today's event.

01:39:13.177 --> 01:39:16.099
Today's educational web seminar is presented by LabRoots.

01:39:16.979 --> 01:39:18.080
Now let's get started.

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.403
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this event is interactive.

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:29.587
I encourage you to first participate by communicating with other attendees using our new live chat feature during the presentation.

01:39:30.247 --> 01:39:32.909
You can find the live chat located at the right of your screen.

01:39:33.854 --> 01:39:38.938
You can also participate by submitting as many questions as you would like during the presentation.

01:39:39.559 --> 01:39:43.902
To do so, simply type them into the Ask a Question box and click Submit.

01:39:44.563 --> 01:39:48.546
We'll answer as many questions as we have time for at the end of our presentation.

01:39:49.427 --> 01:39:58.574
If you have trouble seeing or hearing the presentation, please click on the Help Desk button located at the bottom of your screen within the navigation bar or from the lobby.

01:39:58.594 --> 01:40:02.798
And then it's a pleasure to be here to speak this morning.

01:40:04.142 --> 01:40:06.065
about pandemic virus control measures.

01:40:07.888 --> 01:40:18.824
On the left-hand side of the screen is a snapshot of the... I already have the energy of a tired old man who's tired of having to do this job.

01:40:19.125 --> 01:40:19.625
Tired.

01:40:20.896 --> 01:40:33.619
not happy that finally his work is taken seriously, not happy that finally he's justified in not having wasted his life on coronaviruses, but just exhausted.

01:40:34.399 --> 01:40:39.700
Gilling School of Global Public Health at University of North Carolina, where I hang out somewhere in this complex.

01:40:40.841 --> 01:40:46.262
Obviously, I'll be talking about SARS coronavirus, which is sort of a schematic picture on the right-hand side.

01:40:46.882 --> 01:40:49.903
And again, I want to mention my collaborations

01:40:51.983 --> 01:40:58.288
interact with the elderly in the 14th, 15th century, it's called the Triumph of Death.

01:40:58.709 --> 01:41:02.151
And he painted the Flemish countryside.

01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:06.134
And in this particular... What an interesting quote to choose here.

01:41:06.194 --> 01:41:11.719
The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance on the planet is the virus, Joshua Lederberg.

01:41:11.739 --> 01:41:14.121
And I think that's also at the beginning of Outbreak.

01:41:15.962 --> 01:41:19.145
The movie Outbreak also starts with Joshua Lederberg's quote.

01:41:19.205 --> 01:41:19.765
It's interesting.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.403
He's showing the impact of the bubonic plague on a small village.

01:41:26.484 --> 01:41:31.848
And as you can see, a large amount of death and destruction is coming into the village.

01:41:32.388 --> 01:41:41.755
Villagers don't really know how to prevent or control this pandemic outbreak of disease, but are doing the best they can with the tools they have at the time.

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:50.742
Obviously, 500 years later, we're much more effective at dealing with new epidemic and pandemic viruses.

01:41:51.513 --> 01:42:08.943
But again, this slide illustrates a common event that has evolved just right along with human civilization over the past 2,000 years and will continue to threaten humanity in the next 2,000 years.

01:42:10.704 --> 01:42:19.109
The 21st century has seen a rapid resurgence in new epidemic and pandemic and outbreak viruses.

01:42:20.539 --> 01:42:34.986
In the backdrop of this slide, you can see some number of the 240 some emerging or reemerging viruses or newly emerging viruses that have occurred since around in the 21st century.

01:42:36.127 --> 01:42:47.232
Three epidemic pandemic human coronaviruses, starting with SARS coronavirus in 2003, the MERS coronavirus in 2012, and the cases are still occurring in the Middle East and in Africa.

01:42:48.027 --> 01:42:51.909
And then in end of 2019, we've had SARS-2 reemerge causing COVID-19.

01:42:52.709 --> 01:43:05.176
What most people aren't aware of is that in the context of this 20-year interval, there's also been three new swine coronaviruses that have caused epidemic or pandemic diseases in these animal populations with devastating consequences.

01:43:05.556 --> 01:43:13.740
So the coronavirus family in general is a group of highly and rapidly evolving emerging viruses that threaten both human and animal populations.

01:43:14.195 --> 01:43:28.180
In addition, we've had pandemic alpha viruses like chikungunya, pandemic influenza viruses like the 2009 H1N1, as well as sporadic avian influenza virus cases of H5N1 or H7N9 that have been sampling human populations for the past 20 years.

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:34.843
The flaviviruses include West Nile virus and Zika virus in the backdrop of about 300 million cases of dengue virus each year globally.

01:43:35.263 --> 01:43:38.484
And then we've had several filovirus outbreaks like Ebola in 2014-16, 2018-20.

01:43:38.544 --> 01:43:39.645
And not shown here are the four

01:43:43.985 --> 01:43:45.887
norovirus pandemics that have occurred since 2002.

01:43:45.927 --> 01:43:50.010
Four norovirus pandemics.

01:43:50.851 --> 01:43:54.114
There are also norovirus pandemics that we just don't talk about.

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:56.136
Like, that's just crazy talk.

01:43:56.656 --> 01:43:58.618
They do not have evidence for that.

01:43:58.678 --> 01:44:00.099
That's what's so extraordinary.

01:44:00.119 --> 01:44:02.441
They're adding things to the list all the time.

01:44:02.461 --> 01:44:03.462
Human suffering.

01:44:04.023 --> 01:44:05.064
It's been a global catastrophe.

01:44:05.084 --> 01:44:09.167
There have been over 500 million cases and 6.2 million deaths that have been reported.

01:44:09.628 --> 01:44:10.168
If you look at

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.961
baseline mortality rates across the globe.

01:44:14.321 --> 01:44:18.423
The actual number of individuals who probably perish from this disease are somewhere between 14 and 25 million.

01:44:19.684 --> 01:44:22.485
Most recently after the emergence event that occurred in December of 2000.

01:44:22.665 --> 01:44:29.149
14 to 25 million people have been killed by SARS-CoV-2 is what he just said.

01:44:29.169 --> 01:44:29.149
19.

01:44:29.649 --> 01:44:36.012
There have been periodic sweeps of new variants of concern that have infected individuals or caused repeat infections.

01:44:36.752 --> 01:44:37.173
Next slide.

01:44:37.793 --> 01:44:38.253
I control that.

01:44:40.236 --> 01:44:46.378
The first variant that emerged after the Wuhan strain was identified in December 2019 was a variant called D614G.

01:44:46.478 --> 01:44:51.559
This emerged around the end of January of 2020, and then rapidly spread globally across the world.

01:44:51.659 --> 01:45:02.962
It has served as the backbone for other variants of concern that have been recognized by the World Health Organization, like the alpha variant, the beta variant, the gamma variant, the delta variant, and now most recently the Omicron and the VA2 variants.

01:45:03.783 --> 01:45:08.364
Each of these early variants from alpha to delta are characterized by mutations that enhance

01:45:08.963 --> 01:45:13.466
the ability of the virus to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and to transmit more efficiently between humans.

01:45:13.786 --> 01:45:15.607
So it's gotten even better?

01:45:15.747 --> 01:45:25.413
Because I thought at the beginning of the pandemic it was already gain-of-function good at it, like orders of magnitude more than we've ever seen in nature.

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:29.595
And now it's still getting better at binding ACE2?

01:45:29.635 --> 01:45:30.936
That's impressive, isn't it?

01:45:31.696 --> 01:45:31.917
Wow.

01:45:33.403 --> 01:45:38.027
exactly as you would expect the virus that has moved out of animal populations and is adapting.

01:45:38.748 --> 01:45:54.580
I would have assumed that the Australian scientists would have shown us that progression as it went from good to better, since he was just on the Vajon health program for an hour and a half and we didn't talk about the current ACE2 binding affinity at all.

01:45:59.064 --> 01:46:01.826
Omicron, however, was quite unique, which is on the right hand side of the slide.

01:46:02.722 --> 01:46:06.844
And this virus has a huge number of amino acid changes in the spike glycoprotein.

01:46:07.965 --> 01:46:11.747
It's about 3% different in the spike glycoprotein as compared to the original Wuhan strain.

01:46:12.608 --> 01:46:17.971
And many of those changes have a big impact on the antigenic structure and the antigenicity of the virus that affects immune responses.

01:46:19.662 --> 01:46:26.050
But see, you're already talking about the antigenic structure of the virus, the antigenic something of the virus.

01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:35.642
And that's ridiculous because we already know that our immune system, when it presents these, it breaks these things down into their component antigens.

01:46:35.742 --> 01:46:37.925
So the virus doesn't have

01:46:39.266 --> 01:46:55.354
an antigenic signature, its proteins do, its outer coat does, its coat proteins do, and anything that our antigen-presenting cells decide to present could potentially have an antigenic component.

01:46:55.394 --> 01:47:06.440
But the virus itself can't be said to have an antigenic component any more than a basketball can be said to have an athletic component.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.761
It changes in the spike like a protein?

01:47:08.937 --> 01:47:12.698
It's about 3% different in the spike glycoprotein as compared to the original Wuhan strain.

01:47:13.538 --> 01:47:18.900
And many of those changes have a big impact on the antigenic structure, the antigenicity of the virus that affects immune responses.

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:27.082
Importantly, this rate of variation that has occurred with SARS-2 approaches about 1.5% per year, shown here at the bottom of the slide.

01:47:27.723 --> 01:47:34.145
And that's equivalent or roughly equivalent to mutation-driven evolution rates for other highly evolving viruses like influenza and human noroviruses.

01:47:34.745 --> 01:47:35.645
And so this suggests

01:47:36.087 --> 01:47:44.429
that this virus may be undergoing a new strategy to maintain itself in the face of large amounts of human herd immunity.

01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:48.950
These changes in the Omicron virus cause about a 15 to 40 fold reduction in the neutralization titers.

01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:52.910
And so that has had a big impact on vaccine and pre-immune performance.

01:47:54.151 --> 01:47:54.571
Next slide.

01:47:55.031 --> 01:47:59.532
Next slide is a little bit complex, but this is the spike glycoprotein shown over here on the right-hand side of the slide.

01:47:59.992 --> 01:48:03.653
The blue area is the NTD domain on the very right-hand side of the spike.

01:48:03.673 --> 01:48:05.113
And if you look at under NTD changes,

01:48:05.543 --> 01:48:08.425
in terms of amino acid changes that have occurred between alpha and omicron.

01:48:08.705 --> 01:48:13.869
I don't think it should be called NTD domain because that's what he said.

01:48:13.949 --> 01:48:18.472
I think it's N-terminal domain that's being abbreviated as NTD.

01:48:18.532 --> 01:48:19.653
So he wasn't very specific.

01:48:19.673 --> 01:48:21.915
He wasn't very accurate there, which is weird.

01:48:21.935 --> 01:48:22.515
Next slide.

01:48:22.956 --> 01:48:27.419
Next slide is a little bit complex, but this is the spike glycoprotein shown over here on the right hand side of the slide.

01:48:27.899 --> 01:48:31.522
The blue area is the NTD domain on the very right hand side of the spike.

01:48:31.542 --> 01:48:32.983
And if you look at under NTD changes,

01:48:33.413 --> 01:48:50.738
In terms of the amino acid changes that have occurred between alpha and omicron, from the top to the bottom of the slide, you can see that a large number of mutations have occurred in the omicron NTD domain, which encodes neutralizing epitopes, but also can incur structural determinants that regulate, to some extent, presentation of the receptor binding domain, which is the region shown here in the blue box at the top of the slide.

01:48:51.619 --> 01:48:59.621
The RBD, or the part that binds the human ACE2 receptor, is shown here in yellow in the figure, and dots and sequence changes that occur in it are shown in omicron.

01:49:00.114 --> 01:49:13.123
And as you can see, the alpha variant had the first change, which was at position 501, that enhanced binding to the human ACE2 receptor, but even more importantly, it actually changed receptor recognition so that it could use ACE2 receptors for entry in other species like mice.

01:49:14.044 --> 01:49:25.853
The beta variant had more changes that affected both antibody binding and receptor usage, but Omicron has a large number of changes at the bottom of the slide in the spike receptor binding domain that both affect receptor binding usage and immunogenicity.

01:49:27.114 --> 01:49:27.434
Finally,

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:39.536
There's a cluster of mutations in the gray area of the spike ligoprotein that center in and around the furin cleaving site region that either increase the capacity of the furin site to be cleaved by this protease or not.

01:49:40.116 --> 01:49:46.761
Some of these changes also function as a molecular switch that modulates the receptor binding domain region in yellow to an open versus a closed position.

01:49:47.582 --> 01:49:49.163
So these are the types of changes that have occurred.

01:49:50.204 --> 01:49:55.788
And these changes in Omicron have had a huge impact on the ability of antibodies to neutralize viruses.

01:49:56.391 --> 01:50:12.505
So on the left side of the slide, basically this is a collaboration done with Sally Burmar and a group of people in my lab and elsewhere where young infant primates were vaccinated either with a Moderna mRNA or recombinant S2P adjuvanted vaccine that was developed at the NIH and then followed for several months.

01:50:13.005 --> 01:50:16.328
In this case, we're looking at the neutralization titer against D614G.

01:50:16.688 --> 01:50:18.790
This is the top panel on the right, the blue arrow.

01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:22.093
So the higher the dilution, the more potent the serum is.

01:50:22.133 --> 01:50:24.655
And so you can see a potent neutralizing antibody

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.761
against that original D614G variant.

01:50:26.781 --> 01:50:28.702
The beta variant causes a three to five fold reduction.

01:50:29.542 --> 01:50:33.804
The delta variant really is not much different antigenically from the D614G variant.

01:50:33.844 --> 01:50:37.866
And then the Omicron variant causes a 15 to 50 fold reduction in the neutralization titer.

01:50:38.066 --> 01:50:47.710
Just keep in mind, they're only talking about spike protein here, even though there are lots of other proteins for which your body could have immunity, build immunity, target immunity, whatever.

01:50:48.730 --> 01:51:04.673
But we're focused exclusively on the spike protein because that's the immunogenic protein that they've been working on at EpiVax and other places to create an adjuvant function in a protein so that they could make a biologic that could function as an adjuvant.

01:51:04.773 --> 01:51:17.796
And so these technologies have been, these ideas have been around for a long time and they've been around in the minds of people like Robert Malone and the company EpiVax and the company up in Canada that

01:51:18.757 --> 01:51:23.145
that Palantir has invested in trying to do monoclonal antibody screening for.

01:51:23.205 --> 01:51:25.609
It's all the same sort of scramble.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:45.952
for biotechnology that can allow this exaggeration to continue, to allow this implication of fidelity to continue, even though they don't have the fidelity of understanding that they pretend they have.

01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:50.316
None of these people are sophisticated enough in their biology to understand that.

01:51:50.356 --> 01:51:58.543
And none of these people are sophisticated enough to understand that if this is all endogenous signaling that's being misconstrued as pathogenic,

01:52:00.845 --> 01:52:17.718
that all of these people are doing is facilitating the study of transfection and transformation and either optimizing the immune response to or minimizing the immune response to transfection and transformation in our own cells.

01:52:19.747 --> 01:52:46.413
and how easily the exploration of the understanding and hijacking of our own signaling via exosomes could be misconstrued as pathogenic in order to ethically justify the study of it, to justify the investing of billions of dollars in the study of it under the guise of public health rather than just, you know, using you as an experimental animal.

01:52:47.401 --> 01:52:49.001
Blue is the protein vaccine.

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:51.042
Red is the mRNA-based vaccine.

01:52:51.742 --> 01:53:02.405
The reduction in neutralization titer with Omicron on the far right-hand side of the slide is equivalent to some of the bat coronaviruses that exist, SARS-related coronaviruses that exist in nature like SHC014, which causes a similar reduction in neutralization titers.

01:53:02.825 --> 01:53:04.806
This is at eight weeks after vaccination, 10 months later.

01:53:05.805 --> 01:53:08.548
notice that all of the neutralization titers have dropped about tenfold.

01:53:09.329 --> 01:53:24.726
But keep in mind that all of these people are victims of an illusion of consensus because David Baltimore and Ralph Baric and all of these people have agreed on the presupposition that viruses exist.

01:53:26.155 --> 01:53:38.520
They just haven't been shown with the fidelity that they say they have, or they haven't been shown to be as dangerous as they have, or we disagree on the classification of them or something like that.

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:51.705
But nobody, nobody, not even the no virus people are willing to say and posit the idea that healthy signaling across the entire potentially eukaryotic kingdom

01:53:53.522 --> 01:54:03.843
occurs and is governed by exosomes that all have fusion proteins on the outside with various levels of specificity for targets.

01:54:05.652 --> 01:54:09.234
And we are barely scratching the surface of understanding them.

01:54:09.294 --> 01:54:18.040
And there is a kind of, let's say, correlate of this signaling process in the pattern integrity of bacteria.

01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:24.905
There is a correlate of this signaling process in the fungi that are symbiotic with roots of plants.

01:54:25.365 --> 01:54:33.890
There is a correlate of this probably with the signaling that occurs between the bacteria of our gut and our immune system.

01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:35.610
But we are not paying attention.

01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:46.976
We are not investing in and understanding it in that way because we are exclusively asking questions about this, assuming that these are signals outside of our body.

01:54:47.417 --> 01:54:50.058
These are enzymes that are exclusive to viruses.

01:54:50.478 --> 01:54:53.200
And these are things that we have to exist in spite of.

01:54:54.258 --> 01:54:56.800
And these are all parts of the same mythology.

01:54:57.821 --> 01:55:06.508
These people are victims of a huge illusion of consensus that needs only a few people like Ralph Baric to be sustained.

01:55:06.909 --> 01:55:10.712
Many individuals with very, very low titers, making them more potentially vulnerable to reinfection.

01:55:12.433 --> 01:55:20.020
So let's take a step back now and talk about coronavirus threats that exist in nature and sort of review some of the history and try to come to some

01:55:20.845 --> 01:55:26.652
model system to explain how these viruses move out of animal host reservoirs and move into other mammalian species.

01:55:27.233 --> 01:55:30.537
The first example of this was with the original 2003 SARS coronavirus strain.

01:55:31.328 --> 01:55:32.789
which is closest relative.

01:55:32.889 --> 01:55:52.920
For which Alina Chan still has a as yet unpublished data set, which shows that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whatever it was, sequentially didn't vary at all for the first six months of the pandemic, unlike SARS-CoV-1, which varied about between 10 and 50 amino acids every sequence they got.

01:55:53.905 --> 01:56:03.228
very big observation that I did two bike rides about, but she just got a faculty position and a book, but they didn't have to publish that at all.

01:56:03.248 --> 01:56:05.349
And now she works on artificial chromosomes.

01:56:05.869 --> 01:56:06.589
Stop lying!

01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:11.671
Identified to date is a bat, a SARS coronavirus called WIV-16.

01:56:11.691 --> 01:56:15.913
This is about 98% identical to the SARS coronavirus strain that emerged in 2002-2003.

01:56:17.967 --> 01:56:21.848
the current model system for how SARS coronavirus emerged, which is most heavily referenced.

01:56:22.428 --> 01:56:43.215
I think you would be very, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't acknowledge that there are other biologists who studied the immune system 10 and 20 years ago who proposed that the immune system would be primarily generalizing across pathogenic molecular patterns or

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:47.718
or damage associated molecular patterns.

01:56:47.758 --> 01:57:01.422
So looking for combinations of molecules that are dangerous and found across bacterial species or across exosomal species or across any of these signals and then generalize across those things.

01:57:01.983 --> 01:57:12.666
And then those same strategies could be applied to toxins, could be applied to screening stuff through your gut, the whole nine yards.

01:57:13.735 --> 01:57:27.380
rather than the more modern idea that the pandemic biology has foisted upon our kids, which is that the immune system needs to make a new set of memories for every new thing that it ever meets in the new world all the time.

01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:33.422
And there are novel things that can come out of viruses or come out of laboratories and bat caves.

01:57:34.322 --> 01:57:35.242
And so I think a

01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:45.624
It is unwise to simplify this concept, which we don't understand yet, down to garbage, because it can't be garbage.

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:52.788
It's definitely not garbage when it comes to the interaction between fungi and the roots that they are symbiotic with.

01:57:53.189 --> 01:58:04.115
It's definitely not garbage when it comes to the regulation of the metabolic processes in zoonotic plankton, and not zoonotic plankton, but zooplankton in the ocean.

01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:13.289
We already know that bacterial evolution is sort of governed by bacteriophage signaling.

01:58:13.349 --> 01:58:20.232
So again, I would suggest it is very, if it ends up being garbage, then we'll get there eventually.

01:58:20.292 --> 01:58:31.958
But I think that if you want to take in and acknowledge most of the biological observations that have preceded these last five years, then I think it would be very much

01:58:33.968 --> 01:58:57.979
not in our best interest to go from not acknowledging exosomal signaling at all to then simplifying exosomal signaling down to a garbage processing mechanism rather than a natural, healthy signaling mechanism between tissues, between tissue and the immune system, between immune system cells, between the central nervous system and the peripheral.

01:58:58.059 --> 01:58:58.599
I don't know.

01:58:59.764 --> 01:59:00.004
Right?

01:59:00.164 --> 01:59:11.514
Once you understand that exosomal signaling is an untapped biological idea, there is potential for exosomal signaling to play a role in almost any aspect of our physiology.

01:59:12.755 --> 01:59:19.541
But instead, we are told that there is no exosomal signaling at all in any scenario.

01:59:20.762 --> 01:59:22.143
and that it's all viruses.

01:59:22.203 --> 01:59:23.784
You see, that's the crazy part.

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:33.290
Even AIDS, a retro viral signal supposedly transmitted between immune cells is definitely a bad guy from the outside.

01:59:33.570 --> 01:59:36.412
And that is just not, no way.

01:59:36.532 --> 01:59:37.312
Stop lying.

01:59:38.533 --> 01:59:48.279
The virus in a bat infected civets and raccoon dogs in the open market where the virus replicated and evolved variants that could now affect humans efficiently and this set up a transmission cycle.

01:59:49.281 --> 01:59:58.799
However, the truth of the matter is that WIB1, WIB16, and other bat-like SARS coronaviruses that have been identified are quite efficient at replicating in primary human airway cells from the lung.

01:59:59.505 --> 02:00:01.686
And so these viruses could have spilled directly over into humans.

02:00:01.886 --> 02:00:24.981
I think the most important thing to realize, Pete, is that everybody in academic biology is, to a certain extent, trusting the illusion of consensus, trusting the consensus of their mentors, trusting the consensus of the people that they meet and talk to, that some of these conclusions can be accepted as facts upon which we can base our investigations.

02:00:26.141 --> 02:00:28.263
And so in neuroscience, I was

02:00:30.914 --> 02:00:43.686
I was under the spell of some of these assumptions, which when they are made, you can do experiments and you can, you can say that you're getting results, but they're made, the experimental results are interpreted based on this assumption.

02:00:43.706 --> 02:00:49.231
And if this assumption isn't true, then the interpretation of the experimental results can flip on its head.

02:00:51.312 --> 02:00:54.916
And of course, as an academic biologist, if we're going to get to the cutting edge,

02:00:56.365 --> 02:01:25.852
If we're going to be able to ask questions which will redefine or help to better refine our understanding of what the cutting edge is, where the border of the irreducible complexity exists and how well we can understand the details of it, those experiments are only possible if, to a certain extent, we trust our mentors and take the fast route to what we think is the edge of our understanding.

02:01:27.591 --> 02:01:39.540
And so what you should see that as Pete and everybody else watching the show is that that potential is what makes science across generations possible and that

02:01:43.157 --> 02:01:44.939
That honor system, that's what that is.

02:01:44.999 --> 02:01:49.702
It's an honor system that so many of the people that are still in academia believe is true.

02:01:50.123 --> 02:01:53.085
It's an honor system where nobody's faking their data.

02:01:53.526 --> 02:01:58.029
No one would ever fake their data for fame, fortune, success, no way.

02:01:59.010 --> 02:02:08.338
Everybody in academia is doing their best to just collect data and interpret it objectively and doing their best to contribute to the building of the wall.

02:02:10.305 --> 02:02:15.967
And this illusion is ubiquitous throughout university system, throughout the academic system.

02:02:16.527 --> 02:02:39.555
And yet the fundamental thing to realize is that if there was a national security priority to take one aspect of academia and make it into a mythological thing, or maybe multiple aspects of the academic system, and make them into mythological scholarly endeavors,

02:02:40.967 --> 02:03:06.089
things like social justice, things like systemic racism, things like pandemic potential can be created, can be edified as real academic fields when they are based on conjecture and ideas that have no substantive support in real observations.

02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:07.851
And that's what I think virology is.

02:03:09.011 --> 02:03:14.013
and specifically RNA virology, specifically pandemic RNA virology.

02:03:16.614 --> 02:03:22.977
And at the root of it is this distortion of what this signal means and how high fidelity we can probe it.

02:03:27.039 --> 02:03:33.342
So then infected civets, and that set up the transmission cycle that maintained the virus, ultimately resolving in about 8,000 cases and 800 deaths.

02:03:35.183 --> 02:03:37.184
What do we know about coronavirus emergence events?

02:03:37.224 --> 02:03:37.844
Well, historically,

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:46.377
The human coronaviruses, the contemporary human coronaviruses that cause common colds, which are on the left side of the slide in green, the bottom part, include NL63, 2290, and OC43.

02:03:46.397 --> 02:03:56.845
These viruses are closest relatives are from bats or from cattle and emerged anywhere from about 120 years ago to about 800 years ago in human populations.

02:03:57.366 --> 02:04:02.170
So we really have no idea how coronaviruses evolve once they spill into human populations.

02:04:02.842 --> 02:04:12.245
The 20th century saw a large number of animal epidemic and pandemic coronaviruses, mostly in swine and cattle and other economically important species for human populations.

02:04:13.206 --> 02:04:23.009
And then the 21st century, yeah, the 21st century saw this accelerated movement of new bat coronaviruses that spilled into humans with SARS, of course on Delta coronavirus in 2009 in pigs.

02:04:25.276 --> 02:04:27.620
MERS coronavirus in humans, with the camels as an intermediate.

02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:37.454
I mean, just think about how much more complex and in-depth this presentation is than the last one, where there were four, and a couple, and four, and now there's all of these.

02:04:38.447 --> 02:04:49.796
It's just, it's an incredible expansion of their, of the resolution of their understanding over the course of three years when no increased resolution should have occurred.

02:04:50.296 --> 02:04:56.281
Because again, all of the resources were bent on studying this, the current novel virus.

02:04:56.441 --> 02:05:01.105
None of our resources were being spent on studying this timeline.

02:05:01.165 --> 02:05:06.129
And yet this timeline has become ever more high resolution as we move through the pandemic.

02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:16.051
SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, leaving the question, what does the future hold?

02:05:17.691 --> 02:05:28.073
So we've done a lot of work on the interface of looking at the capacity of zoonotic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 viruses, in terms of their capacity to be risk pathogens for human health.

02:05:28.753 --> 02:05:32.774
This, on the very top right-hand side of the slide, is a phylogenetic tree of the SARS-CoV-2 family.

02:05:33.314 --> 02:05:37.915
The clade 1a group includes SARS-CoV-2 from 2003, which is shown right here on this sort of slide.

02:05:38.993 --> 02:05:40.354
encyclopedia of strains.

02:05:41.415 --> 02:05:47.079
Notice that it's surrounded by other strains of sarvicoronaviruses that are derived from bats and from civets and raccoon dogs.

02:05:47.559 --> 02:05:51.602
These strains are shown here at the top as WIV-16, WIV-1, SHCL-14.

02:05:51.982 --> 02:05:59.667
They range anywhere from about 99 plus percent identical, like this civet strain right here, to about 90 percent identical to the 2003 SARS strain.

02:06:01.667 --> 02:06:04.829
The SARS-2 strain represents a different branch from the SARS-CoV-2 family tree.

02:06:04.969 --> 02:06:09.213
They're about 22% different than the original SARS strain, and over 25% different from all the others.

02:06:09.273 --> 02:06:13.476
Now, first of all, remember that this Jedi Master is reading word for word.

02:06:13.576 --> 02:06:19.460
Secondly, remember that this is a slide from the talk we watched from three and a half years ago, or four years ago.

02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:22.142
Don't forget that either, four and a half years ago.

02:06:22.162 --> 02:06:29.087
These other clade 1 strains that I just mentioned, its closest relative is a bat virus called RATG13, or pangolin, which is from pangolin coronavirus.

02:06:29.758 --> 02:06:33.101
They range anywhere from about 96% identical to 90% identical.

02:06:33.661 --> 02:06:37.765
And then you have the clade 2 strains, a totally different branch of the family, like HKU3.

02:06:38.506 --> 02:06:40.908
They all have similar high-risk features, except for the clade 2 strains.

02:06:40.948 --> 02:06:42.689
They can use the human ACE2 receptor for entry.

02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:45.952
So although they're bat viruses, they use the human receptors just fine.

02:06:46.012 --> 02:06:47.934
They can grow just fine in primary human airway cells.

02:06:48.354 --> 02:06:51.216
They cause acute respiratory distress syndrome either in humans or in mice.

02:06:52.297 --> 02:06:56.561
And they cause age-related disease gradients, just like the SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus 2 do in human populations.

02:06:57.429 --> 02:07:07.752
As the amount of antigenic variation in the spike glycoprotein shown right here increases, these strains begin to escape immunotherapeutics that were targeted against the original strain of SARS.

02:07:09.272 --> 02:07:14.694
Now, importantly, bats have been incredibly undersurveyed.

02:07:14.754 --> 02:07:19.695
So this group of viruses probably represents less than one millionth of the kind of diversity that exists

02:07:20.066 --> 02:07:22.366
within bats that could potentially spill within the human population.

02:07:22.567 --> 02:07:25.127
And so many of these strains are poison.

02:07:25.267 --> 02:07:33.169
We are underestimating the amount of danger we are in by a factor of one million, says Ralph Baric.

02:07:33.429 --> 02:07:37.090
To emerge, and mutation-driven evolution may not be necessary to colonize new species.

02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:40.030
Now let me give you an example of that with the pangolin coronavirus.

02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:42.591
Now we're only gonna look at clade 1b.

02:07:42.651 --> 02:07:45.291
These are the SARS-2 related strains that have been identified around the world.

02:07:46.111 --> 02:07:48.232
And at the top of this tree, you see the Wuhan strains

02:07:50.119 --> 02:07:54.081
China that were identified two different lineages in December, early January of 2019, 2020.

02:07:56.182 --> 02:08:02.464
Closest relatives moving down the tree include RATG13 and BANL52, which are about 96 plus percent identical.

02:08:03.084 --> 02:08:12.808
And then some other BANL strains from Laos, China, Thailand, Cambodia, then pangolin strains from China and pangolins and other strains from Japan.

02:08:12.868 --> 02:08:14.629
So all of the closest relatives to the

02:08:16.226 --> 02:08:22.310
COVID-19 strains that emerged in China and then went around the world are located, the closest relatives are from Southeast Asian viruses.

02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:26.072
So this is a Southeast Asian virus that has emerged to sweep around the globe.

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:27.973
Don't let anybody ever tell you anything different.

02:08:28.293 --> 02:08:29.494
This data is conclusive.

02:08:30.394 --> 02:08:33.276
Pangolins, however, have been suggested to be a potential reservoir species.

02:08:35.023 --> 02:08:36.383
Don't let anybody tell you different.

02:08:36.463 --> 02:08:37.544
In studying these viruses.

02:08:37.644 --> 02:08:41.445
And so we're going to take this GD1 strain potential, our coronavirus family.

02:08:41.585 --> 02:08:48.006
They're not screwed up in the original SARS strain and over 25% different from all these other clay one strains that I just mentioned.

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:52.968
It's closest relative is a bat virus called RATG 13 or pangolin, which is from pangolin coronaviruses.

02:08:53.448 --> 02:08:56.789
They range anywhere from about 96% identical to 90% identical.

02:08:57.349 --> 02:09:01.030
And then you have the clay two strains, a totally different branch of the family, like HKU3.

02:09:02.170 --> 02:09:04.571
They all have similar high-risk features, except for the clade 2 strains.

02:09:04.611 --> 02:09:09.612
They can use the human ACE2 receptor for entry.

02:09:10.152 --> 02:09:13.572
So although they're bad viruses, they use the human receptors just fine.

02:09:13.592 --> 02:09:15.513
They can grow just fine in primary human airway cells.

02:09:15.953 --> 02:09:18.793
They cause acute respiratory distress syndrome either in humans or in mice.

02:09:19.894 --> 02:09:24.134
And they cause age-related disease gradients, just like the SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus 2 do in human populations.

02:09:24.154 --> 02:09:25.115
We're almost done, don't worry.

02:09:25.135 --> 02:09:28.635
At the amount of energy variation in a spike like a protein, I know where I want to end.

02:09:29.616 --> 02:09:31.436
These strains begin to escape

02:09:32.364 --> 02:09:35.346
immunotherapeutics that were targeted against the original strain of SARS.

02:09:36.867 --> 02:09:42.291
Now importantly, bats have been incredibly undersurveyed.

02:09:42.331 --> 02:09:50.195
So this group of viruses probably represents less than one millionth of the kind of diversity that exists within bats that could potentially spill into human populations.

02:09:50.976 --> 02:09:56.439
And so many of these strains are poised to emerge and mutation-driven evolution may not be necessary to colonize new species.

02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.381
Now let me give you an example of that with the pangolin coronavirus.

02:09:59.801 --> 02:10:00.662
Now we're only going to look

02:10:01.212 --> 02:10:01.873
clade 1b.

02:10:01.973 --> 02:10:04.595
These are the SARS-2 related strains that have been identified around the world.

02:10:04.896 --> 02:10:08.058
I'm going to go forward because I accidentally went too far back.

02:10:08.179 --> 02:10:13.964
Relatives moving down the tree in Thailand virus that has emerged to sweep around the globe.

02:10:14.424 --> 02:10:15.846
Don't let anybody ever tell you anything different.

02:10:16.166 --> 02:10:17.327
This data is conclusive.

02:10:17.627 --> 02:10:18.868
That's what I wanted to play again.

02:10:18.888 --> 02:10:20.510
However, to sweep around the globe.

02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:23.793
Don't let our closest relatives are from Southeast Asian viruses.

02:10:24.414 --> 02:10:27.617
So this is a Southeast Asian virus that has emerged to sweep around the globe.

02:10:28.077 --> 02:10:29.518
Don't let anybody ever tell you anything different.

02:10:29.678 --> 02:10:31.039
This data is conclusive.

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:34.863
Pangolins, however, have been suggested to be a potential reservoir species.

02:10:36.964 --> 02:10:44.471
So we became interested in studying these viruses, and so we're going to take this GD1 strain of pangolin virus, and we're going to recreate it in our laboratory.

02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:46.072
We synthesize the full-length molecular clone.

02:10:46.601 --> 02:10:49.962
that then could be used to drive RNA transcripts to recover full-length viruses.

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:51.582
And this is the genome of the pangolin virus.

02:10:51.642 --> 02:10:52.642
It looks just like SARS-CoV-2.

02:10:52.962 --> 02:11:00.864
So they made a full-length cDNA clone and then they use that to generate full-length viruses.

02:11:00.904 --> 02:11:06.845
You see, this is transfection and transformation in cell culture and nothing more.

02:11:08.945 --> 02:11:09.965
That's all it is.

02:11:10.706 --> 02:11:12.886
And he's saying it out loud right there.

02:11:14.554 --> 02:11:17.095
That's hand-waving and we recover virus.

02:11:17.135 --> 02:11:23.076
You transfected or transformed a cell culture with the DNA that you said you just generated.

02:11:23.116 --> 02:11:24.016
Listen.

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:29.337
And so we're going to take this GD1 strain of pangolin virus and we're going to recreate it in our laboratory.

02:11:29.377 --> 02:11:30.957
We synthesize the full-length molecular clone.

02:11:31.457 --> 02:11:34.838
The thing could be used to drive RNA transcripts to recover full-length viruses.

02:11:34.918 --> 02:11:35.738
And this is the genome.

02:11:35.858 --> 02:11:43.240
But when you put an RNA clone on a cell culture, we've already looked at nanopore sequencing results from that.

02:11:44.192 --> 02:11:53.420
You get like two transcripts that even come close to being full genomes, and the rest of them are very tiny subgenomic RNAs.

02:11:55.061 --> 02:11:57.643
So you're not recovering full genomes.

02:11:58.204 --> 02:12:02.828
You're claiming you're covering full genomes, but you don't find them on the RNA.

02:12:04.289 --> 02:12:07.371
This is subgenomic RNA one, two, three, four.

02:12:07.391 --> 02:12:11.435
Look at the full genome is not even visible, but that's a huge transcript.

02:12:13.464 --> 02:12:17.809
It's supposed to be the primary thing that infects the next cell.

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:21.313
Yet even here, they show you the exact same data.

02:12:21.353 --> 02:12:22.775
Oh, I didn't have my arrow up here.

02:12:23.215 --> 02:12:24.917
They show you the exact same data.

02:12:25.925 --> 02:12:34.050
that they've been seeing since the 1950s and 60s and 70s and 80s since they've been looking at these self-replicating RNAs.

02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:41.615
There is an almost indetectable level of an RNA which would qualify with the weight of a full genome.

02:12:42.115 --> 02:12:46.898
Everything else is subgenomic RNA and it's orders of magnitude more abundance.

02:12:48.206 --> 02:13:04.575
And so the infectious cycle that they claim is being replicated or being recapitulated by transfecting and transforming cells with an infectious clone that they call an infectious clone is just transformation and transfection of cell culture.

02:13:04.715 --> 02:13:07.317
And then it's same exact crap happens.

02:13:08.612 --> 02:13:11.354
They don't get high fidelity replication.

02:13:11.414 --> 02:13:17.777
And in fact, the signal that they get is only as pretty as it is because they started with the clone.

02:13:18.458 --> 02:13:19.278
Don't you see?

02:13:20.019 --> 02:13:23.901
If they wouldn't start with the clone, they wouldn't even be able to get that signal.

02:13:27.303 --> 02:13:29.084
The pangolin virus, it looks just like SARS2.

02:13:29.944 --> 02:13:32.946
And then we made derivative viruses that either encoded GFP or nano-luciferase.

02:13:33.827 --> 02:13:38.785
These viruses, when they replicate, they express sub-smaller messenger RNAs that encode these downstream genes.

02:13:38.805 --> 02:13:40.130
You can see them present in the virus.

02:13:41.084 --> 02:13:45.387
And as you incorporate larger genes into the genome, you can see the mRNAs get larger.

02:13:45.968 --> 02:13:56.876
So they're using the appearance of a fluorescent protein that they are transfecting into these cells as an indicator that the virus is replicating, and that's not true.

02:13:56.916 --> 02:14:05.163
What that is showing you is that the RNA to the luciferase, or the RNA to the GFP, is capable of moving between cells.

02:14:06.636 --> 02:14:09.057
Maybe it's packaged, I don't know, it doesn't matter.

02:14:09.117 --> 02:14:12.778
If you put enough of the pure RNA in there, come on!

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:17.679
If you put enough of the pure RNA in at the start, you are not doing anything natural.

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.121
You are just transfecting and transforming cell culture, that's it.

02:14:25.141 --> 02:14:32.023
And the cardinal, fundamental bamboozlement of virology is that synthetic,

02:14:33.294 --> 02:14:42.657
creation of these pure molecules is recapitulating whatever biology they purport to be finding in these bats in the wild.

02:14:43.857 --> 02:14:44.778
It's that simple.

02:14:47.118 --> 02:15:02.263
And that is the illusion that somebody like Ralph Baric, Robert Malone, Judy Mikovits, Tony Fauci, Bob Gallo, David Baltimore,

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:11.703
and Murray Gardner and Ruschetti and all of them are all wittingly or unwittingly sustaining.

02:15:13.464 --> 02:15:31.952
And I am absolutely, absolutely 100% frigging convinced that some of these people that have been offered to us, forced upon us over the last four years as the default dissident leaders from the very first COVID summit in Puerto Rico or San Juan,

02:15:33.248 --> 02:15:36.812
all the way until the very last COVID summit that happened in Romania.

02:15:39.075 --> 02:15:46.144
These people have created the illusion of consensus about a gain-of-function virus that spread around the world starting in late 2019.

02:15:46.184 --> 02:15:46.885
These people, along with

02:15:50.734 --> 02:16:03.149
Tony Fauci and the TV people have gotten us to the stage where most mouth-breathing, skilled TV watchers or skilled social media users believe that, generally speaking, transfection worked well.

02:16:03.209 --> 02:16:04.571
It's probably going to cure cancer.

02:16:04.951 --> 02:16:10.138
They can transfect people and make them immune to shingles or protect them from

02:16:10.678 --> 02:16:13.560
from pneumonia, because we're doing that to old people now.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.462
And transfection was rushed during the pandemic, so some people were hurt.

02:16:17.802 --> 02:16:20.664
We'll probably figure that out, and we'll probably punish some people.

02:16:21.004 --> 02:16:31.130
But free-range RNA can especially pandemic if you put the right combination of fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts in there.

02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:34.292
So that's the part that really frustrates me a lot.

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:37.394
See, now here was my laptop just going away.

02:16:39.741 --> 02:16:41.582
And I don't know why it's just going away.

02:16:41.942 --> 02:16:43.503
But it did this to me yesterday too.

02:16:44.064 --> 02:16:48.526
So I'm going to reboot it and then I'm going to have to figure out what's happening here.

02:16:48.566 --> 02:16:49.707
Let me just feel it quick.

02:16:51.288 --> 02:16:52.228
It does feel hot.

02:16:55.050 --> 02:16:57.111
But it's not as hot as I have felt it.

02:16:59.733 --> 02:17:01.974
I'm very curious as to why it's doing this.

02:17:02.374 --> 02:17:05.276
I'd investigate this further.

02:17:06.236 --> 02:17:07.257
Because it does reboot.

02:17:08.726 --> 02:17:14.651
So these people have convinced us that whatever happened here, free-range RNA, we definitely have to be afraid of it.

02:17:16.153 --> 02:17:27.863
And it's something that these people agree on wittingly or unwittingly, just because they're on the news doesn't mean they understand, but they definitely are going along with it because it's a national security priority.

02:17:27.903 --> 02:17:30.746
They were probably briefed on it, that the idea that

02:17:31.898 --> 02:17:40.964
that we had to get maximum compliance was going to require that we tell people the simplest truth they're willing to accept.

02:17:41.044 --> 02:17:51.251
The simplest truth that they're willing to accept is that, you know, RNA can cause a pandemic and very likely a gain-of-function RNA can cause a really bad pandemic.

02:17:51.792 --> 02:17:54.093
And this illusion of consensus is exactly...

02:17:55.194 --> 02:17:56.375
Exactly what they created.

02:17:56.415 --> 02:17:57.516
So now it's back up again.

02:17:57.536 --> 02:18:00.038
I don't know what to say about my laptop.

02:18:00.078 --> 02:18:00.819
That's a problem.

02:18:00.959 --> 02:18:03.121
We need a new consensus, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:03.641 --> 02:18:11.668
We need a new consensus that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, that RNA cannot pandemic no matter what you endow it with.

02:18:11.708 --> 02:18:14.711
But you can make a lot of RNA and you can make a lot of DNA.

02:18:15.151 --> 02:18:17.433
And you can also murder people and lie about it.

02:18:17.593 --> 02:18:20.776
That is also very possible and very likely.

02:18:20.836 --> 02:18:21.797
So what I argued

02:18:22.097 --> 02:18:36.407
And that's why I think that identifying Brett Weinstein as a traitor and a liar, specifically with regard to me and my family, with regard to me and my work, with regard to my confident

02:18:37.308 --> 02:18:44.451
and confidential communications with him had a stage where I didn't have to waste any time on him and his wife.

02:18:44.611 --> 02:18:45.011
I did.

02:18:45.572 --> 02:18:52.995
And I did it because I thought he was genuinely trying to save the same future for my children and his children.

02:18:53.035 --> 02:18:53.675
But he's not.

02:18:54.095 --> 02:19:04.800
He's trying to put his family in a position in this new society when America and the idea of America is permanently demolished by Robert Malone and his compadres.

02:19:06.690 --> 02:19:08.691
These people are charlatans.

02:19:08.771 --> 02:19:18.056
They are lying to us about the fundamental truths of biology that include that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:19:18.776 --> 02:19:23.399
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:19:24.019 --> 02:19:25.300
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:29.204
Don't forget what these weaponized piles of money did to us.

02:19:30.245 --> 02:19:39.433
It is really without reservation that I've said for the last four years that we should stop transfection in healthy humans.

02:19:40.274 --> 02:19:42.556
I even got to say it in front of the ACIP.

02:19:42.736 --> 02:19:46.039
I said it to Brett Weinstein in 2021 and maybe even in late 2020.

02:19:49.642 --> 02:19:53.824
So we're talking about some serious, serious traitorous behavior.

02:19:53.844 --> 02:19:59.486
Please, they're trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:20:00.006 --> 02:20:08.029
Make sure you're informing the old people in your life that these new vaccines for shingles and for pneumonia are absolutely no-goes.

02:20:08.889 --> 02:20:13.931
If you liked what you saw, please share the restream at stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:20:14.011 --> 02:20:16.552
And if you can, we really need some support.

02:20:16.652 --> 02:20:18.413
We really need some new subscribers.

02:20:19.494 --> 02:20:28.745
We need people to take a risk on a four and a half year track record of integrity and trying to tell the truth, trying to save our grandkids.

02:20:29.185 --> 02:20:32.209
Ladies and gentlemen, gigahomebiological.com is where you can find me.

02:20:32.249 --> 02:20:34.512
Thank you very much for coming and I'll see you again tomorrow.
