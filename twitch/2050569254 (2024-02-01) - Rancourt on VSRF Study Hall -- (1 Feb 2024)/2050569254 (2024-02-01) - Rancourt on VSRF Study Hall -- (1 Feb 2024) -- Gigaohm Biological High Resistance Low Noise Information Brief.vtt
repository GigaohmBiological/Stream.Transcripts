WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Two years and three years, we've had one debate.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.680
You know, it's amazing if it made you break three years,

00:03.680 --> 00:05.400
but you finally got it.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.720
And this is the guy who did it, we're gonna be talking to it.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.800
Well, on that note, why don't we bring him into the media?

00:09.800 --> 00:11.320
All right, welcome to me.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.280
Thank you for coming on PSR5.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.760
Hey, it's a pleasure to be here.

00:14.760 --> 00:15.920
Yep, thanks for the invitation.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.320
I look forward to this conversation.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.240
I want to, before I read your bio, I also want to remind everyone

00:19.240 --> 00:20.760
we will be having a Q&A.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.160
So, put your questions in the chat, all caps,

00:23.160 --> 00:25.320
question, and address it to Denise or to Steve.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.400
And when I am doing the Q&A on the back,

00:27.400 --> 00:28.320
I'll try to get your question.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.040
And if you put a little super chat in there,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.600
we'll try to move you up to the top of the question list.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.760
But first, I'd like to read a little bit

00:34.760 --> 00:35.760
about our special guest tonight.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.400
Denise is a physicist and interdisciplinary scientist.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.960
He holds a master of science degree in physics

00:39.960 --> 00:42.320
and a PhD in physics from the University of Toronto.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.720
He was a natural sciences and engineering research council

00:44.720 --> 00:46.880
of Canada International Postdoctoral candidate

00:46.880 --> 00:48.680
in national scientific laboratories in France

00:48.680 --> 00:49.640
and in the Netherlands.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.440
He then became a National NSERC University Research Fellow

00:52.440 --> 00:54.440
in Canada and the lead researcher and professor

00:54.440 --> 00:56.360
at the University of Ottawa for 23 years,

00:56.360 --> 00:58.000
where he attained the highest academic rank

00:58.000 --> 00:59.320
of tenured full professor.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.720
He is an interdisciplinary research scientist

01:00.720 --> 01:02.440
and has published over 100 articles

01:02.440 --> 01:03.560
and peer-reviewed science journals

01:03.560 --> 01:04.720
in many different areas of science.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.600
He is presently co-director and researcher

01:06.600 --> 01:08.120
at the non-profit Correlation Research

01:08.120 --> 01:09.320
in the public interest.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.160
And we are grateful to have you here tonight with us.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.600
And Steve, you mentioned that debate.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.600
So, and I watched it, and I want to play a little clip

01:16.600 --> 01:17.800
from towards the back end of it

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
before I let you guys get started.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.960
Awesome, awesome, great.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.240
It's glaringly obvious in India, for example,

01:23.240 --> 01:24.560
that there was no excess mortality

01:24.560 --> 01:25.400
until the vaccines were rolled out

01:25.400 --> 01:26.560
and then there was massive excess mortality.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.440
We need to try to go on.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.400
No, no, no, no, no, okay, you just mentioned India, though,

01:30.400 --> 01:32.000
but then Tracy was mentioning all the other countries

01:32.000 --> 01:34.400
where excess mortality rose before or not in line

01:34.400 --> 01:35.240
the vaccine rose.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.720
And we've been addressing it in detail.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.840
More than half of the 17 countries in the Southern Hemisphere

01:38.840 --> 01:41.120
that we have good data for do not have excess mortality

01:41.120 --> 01:42.360
until you roll out the vaccines.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.200
More than half.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.320
The ones that do, it's the peaks that I've been showing you,

01:45.320 --> 01:47.040
these incredible assaults against people and so on,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.080
and we discuss it in detail.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.360
And don't forget that in the paper,

01:49.360 --> 01:53.040
there's an entire chapter on alternative interpretations

01:53.040 --> 01:54.560
that others would put forward without proof,

01:54.560 --> 01:56.120
and we address each one of them.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.080
It's all in that paper.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.360
So it's not like we've been just barring from our minds

02:01.360 --> 02:02.800
that other things could be killing.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.760
For example, some people have been critical of our work

02:04.760 --> 02:07.000
by saying, but these people that you're injecting

02:07.000 --> 02:07.840
have comorbidities.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.200
Of course they have comorbidities.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.040
You're in the real world.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.360
The point is they died the same day that you injected them

02:12.360 --> 02:14.000
and or they died soon after,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.320
or a bunch of them died soon after.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.320
The point is there was a vaccine rollout, okay?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.600
And people with comorbidities can be killed

02:20.600 --> 02:22.040
by these injections.

02:22.040 --> 02:22.880
That's the point.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.240
We're not trying to say it's pure toxicity problem

02:25.280 --> 02:26.360
of a healthy young athlete.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.800
No, we're saying in the general population,

02:27.800 --> 02:29.240
in real hospitals, in real countries,

02:29.240 --> 02:31.080
with all the propaganda and all the governments pushing

02:31.080 --> 02:32.840
to inject everybody, and that this is the thing

02:32.840 --> 02:34.480
you have to do, and this is why you'll be promoted,

02:34.480 --> 02:37.000
that there's a real danger that many,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.720
like 17 million vulnerable people were killed.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.280
So you're saying your paper shows for the Southern Hemisphere,

02:43.280 --> 02:44.280
which is the focus of your paper,

02:44.280 --> 02:46.320
that the fact that in every case that you look at,

02:46.320 --> 02:48.960
vaccine rollout is associated with higher access mortality.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.200
And for the Tracy's point,

02:50.200 --> 02:51.720
when the other countries that you didn't focus-

02:51.760 --> 02:55.240
Now, just to point out, good evening,

02:55.240 --> 02:56.600
this is Giga-owned biological.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.320
We're just doing a quick study hall tonight

02:58.320 --> 02:59.960
on this recent broadcast.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.680
It's actually might still be live, but I reset it now,

03:03.680 --> 03:06.940
where on Steve Kirsch's little Thursday night thing,

03:07.960 --> 03:10.000
we have Denny Rancor.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.480
Now, interestingly, they're discussing this debate,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.120
which I haven't really watched yet,

03:14.120 --> 03:18.560
that occurred between the two guys on the top

03:18.560 --> 03:21.280
are supposed to kind of be hosts or moderators.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.920
And it's supposed to be between Tracy Beth Holk.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.480
I think that's who that is.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.440
And that's Denny Rancor over here.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.640
Sorry, I'm not a good weatherman right here.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.200
So the guy in the upper left corner

03:36.200 --> 03:41.200
is the co-author or co-producer of the blog

03:41.600 --> 03:46.000
and podcast called Illusion of Consensus.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.440
Now, the reason why I find Illusion of Consensus

03:48.440 --> 03:50.400
to be kind of an interesting thing

03:50.400 --> 03:54.440
is because they started it in May of 2023,

03:54.440 --> 03:55.560
not that long ago.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.560
And I'm not really sure if I can't go back before May last year

04:01.720 --> 04:06.320
and find myself still using the words Illusion of Consensus

04:06.320 --> 04:08.120
and I'm not gonna do it

04:08.120 --> 04:09.640
because I don't wanna find out

04:09.640 --> 04:12.520
or I don't wanna think about whether

04:12.520 --> 04:14.400
some of these people are bad guys anymore.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.400
But I do know that this guy sort of came out of nowhere

04:18.480 --> 04:21.520
and in fact, one of the first places that I saw him

04:21.520 --> 04:23.880
which is really interesting

04:23.880 --> 04:26.520
was on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.560
And so he was promoted basically

04:30.560 --> 04:35.560
into this sort of little network of bros with shows

04:35.920 --> 04:39.960
and he now has this thing with J about Acharya.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.440
So that's where this occurred.

04:42.440 --> 04:46.920
So now we have Steve Kirsch promoting J about Acharya

04:46.920 --> 04:49.760
and this character's podcast,

04:49.760 --> 04:53.160
which was already previously anointed as cool

04:53.160 --> 04:56.480
by having been interviewed by Brett Weinstein,

04:56.480 --> 04:58.360
which is just interesting.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.560
It's just interesting.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.360
So on you're saying, also you would find one there

05:01.360 --> 05:04.480
if you're saying if you use the proper excess mortality

05:04.480 --> 05:06.240
figures or you're saying that sometimes-

05:06.240 --> 05:07.600
Yeah, I'm saying that we're gonna put out a paper

05:07.600 --> 05:08.480
in the next two months or so

05:08.480 --> 05:09.640
that we'll have 150 countries

05:09.640 --> 05:12.280
where we did this analysis throughout in great detail

05:12.280 --> 05:13.400
with state of the art methods.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.880
And it shows that this is a consistent phenomenon.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.000
It's helping me a lot.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.320
I got to be right back.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.080
Oh yeah, don't worry, go ahead and finish your dinner, Steve.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.000
Don't let me interrupt your dinner.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.360
So yeah, we had a debate.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.400
It was a, you know, personally,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.440
it was a very painful experience for me to have that debate.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.920
It lasted three hours.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.520
It was done, it was set up in a rush.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.600
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.040
So I gave in to a lot of the conditions of the debate

05:41.040 --> 05:42.600
that were not favorable.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.720
And I was angry when we started the debate.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.480
You guys didn't see the backstage discussion.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.400
But I was very susceptible to the seat.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.000
But I thought, well, I've just got to do the best I can

05:52.000 --> 05:53.080
and see what happens.

05:53.080 --> 05:53.920
Tell me more.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.280
What was unfair?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.600
Oh, I don't want to get into those details

05:56.600 --> 05:57.360
about how it was done.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.320
But no, I don't want to mean mouth how it was done.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.640
But, oh, unfair.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.400
Well, clearly the three of them

06:05.400 --> 06:09.000
were had a position which was opposite to mine.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.360
Rob himself told me he was certainly biased.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.240
You could see that in his prelude

06:13.240 --> 06:15.600
to the written critique by Tracy,

06:15.600 --> 06:18.440
that he was extremely biased against our study.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.680
And he said, yes, I'm biased, but I'll be objective now.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.440
And so on.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
I mean, it was that kind of a situation.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.200
So we did what we could.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.120
I did the best I could.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.600
And then, thankfully, I had the opportunity

06:28.600 --> 06:30.440
to write a very detailed written response

06:30.440 --> 06:32.800
to every point in Tracy's critique,

06:32.800 --> 06:34.360
where I unpacked her critique.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.680
And I responded to every single point in writing very clearly.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.680
So people are welcome to read that.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.520
It's on my website.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.600
And it's on sub stack.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.760
It's entitled, My Responses Tracy Beth Hoeig's Criticism

06:43.760 --> 06:46.200
of our 17 Million Vaccine Deaths calculation.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.040
It's all there.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.960
And I appreciate having done that,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.280
because there's a lot of fact checkers out there

06:51.280 --> 06:53.480
that are spewing out all kinds of garbage.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.160
And a lot of it was echoed by Tracy.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.800
And I was able to address it in detail, point after point.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.440
I'm not saying that Tracy made only fun comments.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.080
She also made some a few very pertinent scientific comments,

07:04.080 --> 07:05.360
which I'm grateful for.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.840
But it gave me a chance to address the fact checkers.

07:07.840 --> 07:08.680
Yeah.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.840
No, I don't want to be a creep.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.840
But I don't really care much about this interesting little

07:12.840 --> 07:13.760
debate they had.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.040
I think it must have been, for the most part,

07:16.040 --> 07:18.000
all about the 17 million deaths.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.400
And not about whether there was any evidence for spread.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.240
And if I watched that video and I spent an hour and a half

07:24.240 --> 07:28.040
watching it and find out that they wasted my time

07:28.040 --> 07:32.880
by not discussing the fact that he has oodles of data

07:32.880 --> 07:34.720
to show that for some reason or another,

07:34.720 --> 07:36.960
the virus doesn't spread from county to county

07:36.960 --> 07:40.680
or from country to country, I'm going to go bananas.

07:40.680 --> 07:46.080
And I'm almost sure that that's what happened on that debate.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.120
And so what I'm watching this for, what I'm hoping in this for,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.040
I have this set at 1.5 speed.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.960
I hope that he covers that in this discussion.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.520
Let's go.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.240
Suffice it to say, at the end of the day,

07:58.240 --> 08:00.760
you weren't persuaded by her arguments.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.720
Would that be fair summary?

08:03.720 --> 08:07.440
Oh, her argument was that our paper was untenable,

08:07.440 --> 08:09.480
had no value, that it was full of holes.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.760
She used the term that you needed to do a sanity check

08:12.760 --> 08:14.400
if you were going to believe this paper.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.480
So her argument was that it was a worthless paper.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.680
So she had, she was supposed to prove or demonstrate

08:19.680 --> 08:21.600
that there was something, an error in it or some logic

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
that was incorrect or something.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.080
And she did not do that whatsoever.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.120
And my response is, well, here are your points.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.080
One after the other, it's like a big shopping list.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.680
And some of them are just flippant, ridiculous, silly things

08:31.680 --> 08:32.560
that you shouldn't have said.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.880
And others are good scientific points.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.800
And here's my addressing each one.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.640
So you have not, in any way, invalidated our paper.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.000
OK.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.280
Yeah, so, but Tracy does bring up one good scientific point

08:44.280 --> 08:46.320
that I acknowledge, and it's a good point.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
It's an important point.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.800
And it does not invalidate our paper.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.440
But it's still something that is needed in the analysis

08:51.440 --> 08:53.520
and in the thought of what's going on here, which, of course,

08:53.520 --> 08:54.560
we have considered and so on.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.000
It just wasn't explicitly written in our paper.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.440
Do you want me to get into that?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.600
Like technically, what is the one key thing

09:00.600 --> 09:02.280
that she had a reasonable point on?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.960
I think that might be cool, right?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.200
So basically, she said, cut right to the chaser.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
Yeah, let's cut right to the chaser.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.960
She basically said, listen, she said,

09:08.960 --> 09:11.600
there has been a study done in Qatar

09:11.600 --> 09:14.480
where they had all the national data for the entire country.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.280
And they had not only the death certificate data,

09:16.280 --> 09:18.240
but they had the vaccination status of every single person

09:18.240 --> 09:19.240
who died.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.240
And by status, we mean like.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.960
Steve's getting very excited here.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.840
I anticipate he's going to have something fun to say here.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.600
Hang on.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.080
Each dose that was given, when it was given,

09:29.080 --> 09:30.000
they had everything.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.560
And she said, well, look at this paper.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.760
She didn't say this clearly in the debate,

09:33.760 --> 09:35.960
but if you read what she said and you read the paper

09:35.960 --> 09:38.640
and I was able to infer that, hey, there's a good point here,

09:38.640 --> 09:39.960
although she didn't say it this clearly.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.160
But basically, what it is, is if unless the Qatari scientists

09:43.160 --> 09:45.920
are being completely dishonest and are making up data,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.640
then what their study shows is that even if you interpret

09:48.640 --> 09:51.360
every single death that occurred after the vaccine

09:51.360 --> 09:53.600
that they report, as being due to the vaccine,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.920
it's still a small number, okay?

09:55.920 --> 09:57.680
So her point is, given that small number,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.240
which works out to be something like 10 or 20 deaths

10:00.280 --> 10:03.160
per million injections or per million people injected.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.520
And so she said, well, given that small number,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.080
how it's completely incompatible with what you're getting,

10:07.080 --> 10:08.240
right?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.360
And so that's the kind of opposition

10:11.360 --> 10:12.400
that is really good to make,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.720
because you're comparing two very different kinds of study.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.800
You're comparing a study where you actually know

10:15.800 --> 10:17.480
the vaccine status of everyone who died in the country

10:17.480 --> 10:19.240
for the entire period that you studied it for,

10:19.240 --> 10:20.760
to a study that does all cause mortality

10:20.760 --> 10:23.080
and looks at temporal correlations between rollouts

10:23.080 --> 10:26.560
and temporally associated peaks in the all cause mortality.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.880
And you quantify that, okay?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.280
So it's very different approaches.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.320
And she's saying, you're not giving the right,

10:31.320 --> 10:33.160
the same answer, they're not the same order of magnitude,

10:33.160 --> 10:34.800
there's gotta be something wrong here.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.960
And so we looked at the Katori paper in my response,

10:37.960 --> 10:39.160
and we were very critical of it,

10:39.160 --> 10:42.640
that it didn't apply to a real population in a real country.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.280
The average age of people who died was very young,

10:44.280 --> 10:46.640
whereas we're looking at most people who died,

10:46.640 --> 10:47.480
things like that.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.040
And they were all young males,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.560
and they were all immigrant workers in Qatar.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.200
It's like in their study period, nobody all died.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.280
And no Katori's died that had been vaccinated.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.720
In other words, it's a fountain of youth.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.400
It protected, if you got the vaccine and you were old,

11:02.400 --> 11:04.520
you couldn't die of all costs, right?

11:04.520 --> 11:06.800
Okay, so I tried to get the data.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.400
I tried to get the data on the Katori paper.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.240
Yeah.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.080
Guess what happened?

11:10.080 --> 11:10.920
They won't give it to you, they won't give it to you.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.760
Exactly.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.120
They actually say in the paper that.

11:13.120 --> 11:13.960
You can't get it.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.680
To protect privacy, we're not gonna give this to you.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.520
Yeah.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.680
And also I've got to protect the privacy.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.680
That's really important.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.480
As we learn to use human, yeah, especially for the dead.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.560
You can't got to preserve the privacy of dead people.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.400
So the authors were funded by the usual suspects.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.240
And that the...

11:31.240 --> 11:32.080
No.

11:32.080 --> 11:32.920
Yes.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.240
And that the independence of this study.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.880
And that the results were just really surprising.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.440
Like nobody all dying and stuff like that.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.520
So what did she say to that?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.600
No, no, no.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.200
You see, the problem is she did not,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.280
she didn't clearly put this to me during the debate

11:45.280 --> 11:46.400
or in her written thing.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.400
I had to construct what her best argument would be

11:49.400 --> 11:52.560
given the shotgun shot list that she put out of her.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.080
And then I addressed her best argument

11:54.080 --> 11:55.280
as I construct that it would be.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.120
Got it.

11:56.120 --> 11:56.960
I got it.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.640
So I have some good news for you.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.400
I have the data from New Zealand.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.240
Yeah.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.880
And I have the...

12:03.880 --> 12:04.880
Everybody's death.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.160
I have the death records for everybody.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.040
And I have the death records if you were vaccinated.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.440
So I can tell you that these vaccines,

12:11.440 --> 12:14.520
you may be surprised to hear this, they are not safe.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.480
And you know, I can't get an epidemiologist on camera

12:16.480 --> 12:17.960
to talk about the data for some reason.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.800
I just can't figure it out.

12:18.800 --> 12:23.520
To save my life, I cannot find a pro-vaccine epidemiologist

12:23.520 --> 12:25.120
where we can have an honest discussion

12:25.120 --> 12:26.240
about the New Zealand data.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.360
Because the New Zealand data, the beauty of the New Zealand data

12:28.360 --> 12:32.040
is that it's public information now, thanks to me.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.160
Thanks to Barry Young.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.960
Because he gave it to me, I then obfuscated it,

12:34.960 --> 12:36.760
and then I took the risk of publishing it.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.960
And so it's out for everybody to see.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.560
It's so much work.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.520
You know, Steve, my research team and I

12:45.520 --> 12:47.040
are doing the heavy lifting.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.400
I mean, as scientists, we're doing a really big job here

12:50.400 --> 12:52.240
and we have for many years.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.400
It's so much work to really do a rigorous job

12:55.400 --> 12:57.680
of analyzing this kind of data and trying

12:57.680 --> 13:00.400
to figure out all the caveats and everything.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.600
That before we launch into yet another country

13:03.600 --> 13:07.640
or yet another database, we have to be as sure as we can

13:07.640 --> 13:10.520
that it's not corrupted in any way.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.640
And for that reason, I've kind of been avoiding

13:13.640 --> 13:17.040
the New Zealand data because I don't know

13:17.040 --> 13:19.800
that it's complete for the country over the time period

13:19.800 --> 13:22.560
that they're saying it's not certified

13:22.560 --> 13:24.920
by a national government.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.000
And that kind of, you know, it's just so much work

13:28.000 --> 13:29.200
to work on this data.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.960
It's just like, well, I would rather work with data

13:31.960 --> 13:35.960
that no one will say can have any problems with it, you see.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
Yeah, that's fine.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.440
You know, personal preference, I can tell you

13:40.440 --> 13:43.600
that I have spent months with this data

13:43.600 --> 13:46.720
and I analyze it all sorts of different ways

13:46.720 --> 13:50.440
and it's like nobody could have faked this data.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.640
And it all matches up.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.440
I mean, I can go to each record.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.000
I've got the full records.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.880
I've got all the records.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.560
I can match them up with real life.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.480
I can verify every single record.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.320
Yes.

14:02.360 --> 14:07.440
I don't understand how is it anonymous,

14:07.440 --> 14:10.480
but then you can match it up in real life

14:10.480 --> 14:11.880
every record up in real life.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.120
I don't know what he's even saying there.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.640
It's really like he's trying to tempt Denny into,

14:19.640 --> 14:23.440
well, I have the perfect data set for you, the buddy.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.200
I got the perfect sirloin steak

14:26.200 --> 14:29.080
that you're just going to want to try and grill yourself.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.120
I don't really get it.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.440
I don't get it at all.

14:31.440 --> 14:35.640
This data set, he also tried to tempt CHD

14:35.640 --> 14:38.440
into doing some analysis on it when I was there.

14:38.440 --> 14:43.440
And yeah, I don't know.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.360
I feel like he's been pushing this data set

14:46.360 --> 14:48.440
on a lot of different people.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.760
CHD with Brian, and he's got a staff scientist there

14:58.760 --> 15:00.920
by the name of Carl that he works with.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.000
Carl's extremely skilled.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
And so I think given how long Steve has had this data set,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
how many people he's offered it to,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
how many people have had the opportunity to look at it

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
and haven't really seen what Steve thinks that he sees there.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
I would be very curious to see what Denny would find,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
but I have trouble with the initial aspect of it.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There were so many weird things

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
about the way that this whistleblower came forward

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
and the different context and requirements

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
that were needed.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I just,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I don't know how to say it any other way,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
but I don't trust anything that comes out of that country

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
after what I saw for the last four years

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
of how that place works.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
There's only like, is there 17 million of them down there?

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Maybe it's 17 million, but it's somewhere between the Netherlands

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and Norway, right, in terms of total population.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
This is not, so we're talking about a highly corruptible system

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
that was already highly corrupt when their prime minister

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
was that lady with a rather large,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
she had kind of a big mouth.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I mean, it's like physically wide with a lot of teeth visible

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
when she talks.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
Anyway, I don't want to talk about that data set.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
And statistically, this thing is perfect.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
You look at the all-cause mortality of people

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
who got the shot and died.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
I mean, these things match up to what New Zealand mortality is

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
within 10% or 20%.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Obviously, they're higher if you've got the vaccine.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You see what I mean?

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I think Denny's about to react to it right here.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Within 10% to 20% is a very wide window of variation.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
That's not really matching up to previous years

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
if it's between 10% and 20% on.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
But these things are really match up.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I mean, it really matches up.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And the consistency over the data set.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And statistically, this thing is perfect.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
You look at the all-cause mortality of people who got the shot

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
and died.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
I mean, these things match up to what New Zealand mortality is

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
within 10% or 20%.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Obviously, they're higher if you've got the vaccine.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But you look at Denny's face.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Did you see it?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Denny's like, wait, what?

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
They match up between 20% and 20%?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Like, that's not matching up.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Watch Denny's face.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Watch Denny's face.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Each record.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I've got the full records.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I've got all the records.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I can match them up with real life.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I can verify every single record.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
And statistically, statistically, this thing is like perfect.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Like you look at the all-cause mortality of people who got the

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
vaccine.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
And you look at the all-cause mortality of people who got the

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
shot and died.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
I mean, these things match up to what New Zealand mortality is.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, within 10% or 20%.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You know, obviously, they're higher if you've got the vaccine.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
But these things are really match up.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I mean, it really matches up.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
And the, you know, within 10% or 20%, you know, obviously, they're

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
higher if you've got the vaccine.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
But these things are really match up.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I mean, it really matches up.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.020
I mean, it really matches up and the

18:51.580 --> 18:59.000
Data because really matching up is what you really want when it comes to data. You want it to really match up

19:02.280 --> 19:05.680
Listen if you died in the first year versus the second year on

19:06.640 --> 19:10.040
Frickin believable. I mean this data

19:11.160 --> 19:15.920
Look at this day. I'm sorry that this is so technical. I hope you guys don't mind

19:15.920 --> 19:20.080
I'm gonna wait until I do the subtitles on this to break it down

19:20.280 --> 19:23.560
Technically this I know it's really dense right now, but just try to keep up

19:23.560 --> 19:28.360
Hey, you say there's no way that this data was tampered with this is this is honest

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
Awesome thing

19:31.160 --> 19:35.600
Completeness is another you can have it depends on her depends on how you analyze it, right?

19:35.600 --> 19:39.320
If you analyze it on a perdos basis the completeness doesn't matter

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
Because it's random

19:42.880 --> 19:49.360
Yeah, we probably don't want to go there why is it on a perdos basis the completeness doesn't matter

19:50.760 --> 19:53.460
Because it's random. It's it's a yeah

19:53.960 --> 19:58.520
We probably don't want to go there because we'll spend a lot of time talking about

19:59.040 --> 20:06.640
The caveats in analyzing this kind of data because you know, that's some that's what we do and there are a lot of caveats and

20:12.680 --> 20:20.560
You know, they they contact they contacted my he tried really hard to get him to take that data seriously

20:20.560 --> 20:23.040
That was pretty funny. I mean it matches up really nice

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
hosting provider to

20:26.480 --> 20:28.480
Try to take my server down

20:28.480 --> 20:32.920
And the hosting provider then said hey, we got this request and they sent me the request

20:33.200 --> 20:37.720
So I know who they are so I reached out to these guys I emailed all of them

20:37.720 --> 20:40.040
I I found I called them and

20:40.040 --> 20:43.120
And you know left a message. I've got that

20:43.720 --> 20:50.920
And these guys don't respond. They said oh contact us by you know, we're in

20:53.000 --> 20:59.640
Yeah, it's the lawyers. They write and the lawyers say so what happens is that they have the hitman lawyer who

20:59.760 --> 21:04.920
This is the guy who contacts my hosting provider saying oh, you know, yeah, take notice of this this order

21:04.920 --> 21:11.000
Which by the way, we don't have any jurisdiction over you, but they never say that right so they say check out this order and

21:11.840 --> 21:16.880
You know, please take down the the stuff and then they say well, you contacted the wrong firm

21:16.880 --> 21:21.200
You have to contact this firm so in nanoseconds this guy contacts the right firm

21:21.200 --> 21:28.480
Who's the interviewer again? Who who whose time are we wasting who whose interview is this and whose dinner?

21:28.480 --> 21:34.200
Did we interrupt? I don't get what's going on here. It's everything is flipped then I get it and

21:34.920 --> 21:38.520
I contact this guy here nothing from this guy

21:38.640 --> 21:45.920
Then I keep contacting them and then I get this note from the senior partner at the law firm

21:46.560 --> 21:52.240
And he writes me and he says oh, it's because I texted him or I texted

21:53.040 --> 21:57.000
Anthony who's the hench the hitman who who goes after

21:58.000 --> 21:59.640
My hosting provider

21:59.680 --> 22:07.520
So Anthony basically is out of the picture now because he's the lower level guy in the law firm

22:07.520 --> 22:14.120
So the top partner on the breaches then is tech he texts me back. He says

22:15.120 --> 22:19.560
I'm taking over now. All your conversations should be with me

22:19.720 --> 22:24.320
Don't see see any anybody else but me and contact me by email

22:24.960 --> 22:29.440
So I send him emails. They said okay fine. How about your way, you know Burger King. Have it you're right

22:29.640 --> 22:31.640
And and so

22:31.640 --> 22:33.640
Then he

22:33.640 --> 22:36.600
Send them all these emails and he never responds. Yeah, of course

22:37.080 --> 22:42.480
It's typical they the first thing they do if they can do it especially when they don't even have the jurisdiction

22:42.880 --> 22:49.880
They try to intimidate you and if it doesn't work then there's nothing they can do. So what's talking right right?

22:51.480 --> 22:56.040
Yeah, but I said I take it down. I said look I don't want to spread this information

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
I don't want to reveal any one of the identity

22:58.360 --> 23:02.180
How about I just want to have a zoom call with Margie

23:02.640 --> 23:07.800
Papa show show me that there's a problem with the data and I'll take it down. Yeah. Yeah, I said hey look

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
You got an N. H. I and you got a

23:10.800 --> 23:14.600
We use MRN's because we we obfuscated the N. H. I number so

23:17.240 --> 23:21.500
Why does he use the term obfuscated the the number I don't

23:22.340 --> 23:28.620
Is that the right term it could be I maybe I don't I've never used that term to describe

23:29.340 --> 23:30.260
the

23:30.260 --> 23:34.700
You know the changing the randomizing of numbers. Oh, give me the number

23:36.420 --> 23:42.620
You're an activist and you think like an activist their lawyers trying to get it down period, right?

23:42.620 --> 23:46.900
And and so you're saying well show me that it's wrong. Tell me it's wrong

23:47.740 --> 23:55.700
I mean, that's a typical prank that activists do whereas this lawyer guy his job was to try to impress you or intimidate you

23:55.820 --> 24:00.080
Make you worried make you consult your own lawyer who might say well

24:00.580 --> 24:02.580
You this way and this way and

24:03.540 --> 24:05.540
But it didn't work

24:05.900 --> 24:11.420
They have to crawl back and right right well, but but I told him hey, I'm happy to negotiate

24:12.300 --> 24:17.220
With Margie about taking my site down and of course in the negotiation

24:17.220 --> 24:22.980
I'll be like okay, you guys officially publish the data. Yeah, that's on my site the whole data

24:23.780 --> 24:28.340
Back to your point of the whole data. You publish the whole data set. I'll take my site down

24:29.140 --> 24:36.060
Right, right, you know, I'm a very small guy work. That's not how that's not what it's about. You know that of course

24:36.300 --> 24:41.380
Of course, but that's the way it should be about right because if they they think I did a poor job obfuscated

24:41.420 --> 24:48.500
Then they should say fine. We'll we'll do a great job obfuscating and the public should know because this is public health information

24:48.500 --> 24:54.860
It should be public. I mean you're you're totally in support of your your you did you did a service

24:54.900 --> 24:58.740
You put it out there in the hope that some scientists will pick it up and start to

24:59.140 --> 25:03.020
Yeah, analyze it and see if some of your statistical analysis

25:03.940 --> 25:10.220
You know, maybe it's not the best and so on. You're hoping that people get involved with the data, right?

25:10.540 --> 25:14.340
And you know, I may get there someday, but we've just got

25:16.340 --> 25:22.900
That's cool. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, you know what but you know what I'm learning about this is that

25:23.940 --> 25:31.420
I'm I'm still looking for the honest scientist because the honor the honest epidemiologist, right? You're looking at because you're

25:31.420 --> 25:35.700
No, I know I know but are you but are you saying I'm not an epidemiologist? No?

25:35.700 --> 25:42.460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, let me

25:42.460 --> 25:43.660
know what I said.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.040
No, no, no, no, no, that's what you said.

25:45.040 --> 25:49.380
Pro GPAT, seen epidemiologist, I didn't finish.

25:49.380 --> 25:56.060
There's a looking for the honest, pro vaccine epidemiologist who will look at this data.

25:56.060 --> 25:59.180
Well, that's what I want.

25:59.180 --> 26:03.040
Most most won't say that they're pro again, so they'll say they're just looking objectively

26:03.040 --> 26:04.100
at the science.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.100
Yeah.

26:05.100 --> 26:11.900
put it that way. But you know, we've had two theoretical epidemiology papers in my group

26:12.540 --> 26:19.100
published in peer-reviewed journals now. So I'm not letting anyone suggest that I'm not an

26:19.100 --> 26:23.660
epidemiologist. Oh, I'm not suggesting that you're not. I know I'm kidding you, you know that.

26:23.660 --> 26:29.580
So okay, so let me ask you, you left as a full professor at the University of Ottawa. Why did

26:29.580 --> 26:37.020
you leave? I didn't leave. I was fired. Really? Tell me more. It was an academic freedom battle.

26:37.020 --> 26:45.340
It was huge. It lasted a decade. What was the story? Well, there's what they said and

26:45.340 --> 26:50.060
and the thing they don't tell you, which is I was very, very critical of the university

26:50.060 --> 26:57.100
administration and very vocal and very expressive. And I had a blog and I was just constantly pointing

26:57.100 --> 27:02.140
out that they were using the university institution to for their own benefit and for their own

27:02.140 --> 27:09.100
political devices. And so I was very critical and they I got it got under their skin, I guess.

27:09.100 --> 27:16.300
And they decided to take me out even though I was a full prof and with tenure. And you know,

27:16.300 --> 27:24.540
do that though. There's isn't I thought if you're a full professor with tenure. Yes. And unless you

27:24.540 --> 27:31.340
like, shoot someone, you know, or get rid of a crime. You understand about power

27:32.700 --> 27:40.140
is that they can fire anyone anytime. It's a corporation. Now, will it stand up in court?

27:40.140 --> 27:45.340
If it's challenged, that's where tenure comes in. But they have the power to take you out

27:45.340 --> 27:51.660
one day to the next, like any corporation. Well, after that, after that, you must go to court

27:52.140 --> 27:57.340
or your union, if it's unionized, you and your union go to court and you say that that dismissal

27:57.340 --> 28:04.140
is not warranted. And this man has tenure and et cetera, et cetera. And you fight it out. Yeah.

28:04.140 --> 28:09.500
So we we fought it out for a decade. We fought it out for decade. We went all the way to the

28:09.500 --> 28:14.220
highest appellate court in the province and everything went back and everything. And we were still in

28:14.220 --> 28:21.340
appeal when we finally settled. Oh, wow, you finally settled. Is that a confidential settlement

28:21.340 --> 28:27.740
agreement? Of course, of course it is. And so that that that 10 years after 10 years, we settled.

28:27.740 --> 28:35.980
Oh my gosh. Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay. And there was there was one element that could not be settled,

28:35.980 --> 28:44.140
because it's not allowed in the law to settle it, which is that I was in the process of

28:44.220 --> 28:52.060
litigating against a doctor for breach of professional ethics. And you can't settle out

28:52.060 --> 28:59.420
a breach of professional ethics. So that case went forward. And my union didn't want to take it on.

28:59.420 --> 29:07.900
So I was self represented. It lasted four years or more. And I won. I won a huge victory

29:08.620 --> 29:15.260
against a professional who had worked for the university in this in this context. So there you

29:15.260 --> 29:20.460
go. So can you tell us what that victory was specifically? Well, the victory is public because

29:20.460 --> 29:28.940
it went to court. So what was the what were the particulars of this particular? Well, it was a

29:29.500 --> 29:39.660
hitman psychiatrist who was hired to secretly in secretly evaluate me. And he gave an opinion

29:39.660 --> 29:44.860
to the university that on the basis of psychiatry, I was a dangerous individual.

29:46.860 --> 29:52.940
So so this means that you are not a dangerous individual.

29:53.580 --> 30:01.500
Well, it's a thing. According to the court, you can you can prove that his that he had to

30:01.500 --> 30:06.540
breach professional ethics and did a bad job. And it was all wrong and use bad data and everything.

30:06.540 --> 30:10.460
You can prove all that, but you can't prove that I'm not dangerous. You see what I'm saying? So

30:10.460 --> 30:16.940
you still yeah, I got it. I got it. So yeah, I got it. I got it. So the point is that you still

30:16.940 --> 30:24.540
could be dangerous. It's just that his opinion now has to be discarded that you are dangerous.

30:24.540 --> 30:27.740
You can still be dangerous. I could be talking to a dangerous guy.

30:28.300 --> 30:33.500
His opinion has to be discarded and he has to be disciplined for having made it under the

30:33.500 --> 30:38.140
circumstances that he made. Congratulations. Yes. Thank you. How do you how do you

30:38.140 --> 30:42.620
monetarily support yourself? Wow, like 30 questions about donations.

30:43.500 --> 30:48.860
30 questions about it. How do you get cashflow? How do you get cashflow for your papers and

30:48.860 --> 30:54.140
you're not employed by a university? I don't I don't need people's sponsor. He doesn't need

30:54.140 --> 31:02.300
money. I don't need money for my personal life. But okay, I do I do need a research team and the

31:02.300 --> 31:10.860
research that we do, which is very expensive. And so I'm looking to make that sustainable.

31:11.740 --> 31:17.260
And I'm hoping that the correlation nonprofit corporation that we created will someday find

31:17.980 --> 31:24.620
you know, donors and we need to be become sustainable within a couple of years or we'll just sink.

31:25.340 --> 31:29.100
Okay. And what does sustainability mean? You have to raise a million dollars a year or

31:29.100 --> 31:36.860
a dozen a year? No, no, no, it's very modest. I figure if we I mean, if we had a hundred K a

31:36.860 --> 31:41.900
year, we could do all the research that we have the time and the energy and intelligence to do.

31:41.900 --> 31:48.300
Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Okay. So we're bottle we're bottle necked right now with that with

31:48.300 --> 31:51.660
that funding. Yeah. Okay. So if anybody wants to

31:54.220 --> 32:00.860
where would they go to to contact you? Oh, well, they can start with looking at the correlation

32:00.860 --> 32:06.380
website. So it's correlation dash Canada. I want 100 k a year. That's all I'm asking for is

32:06.380 --> 32:11.020
they can cast a donation. Come on, no, they can look at the client, they mess in with me.

32:11.020 --> 32:15.340
And then if they're serious about making bank transfers or negotiating something,

32:15.340 --> 32:23.180
they can just contact us. Okay. So my next question is, how long have you been a misinformation

32:23.180 --> 32:31.340
spreader, Denny? All my life. No, I mean, well, how about

32:31.340 --> 32:39.020
so you you've realized that the narrative for your entire life, you you've realized that you've

32:39.020 --> 32:43.660
been lied to by the government? Yeah, I mean, I could go back to my childhood and I knew that

32:43.660 --> 32:47.100
the stories that adults wanted us to believe were not true. And I was very vocal about it and so on,

32:47.100 --> 32:52.700
you know, I mean, it starts young. And what was your first, you know, disillusionment? Was it like

32:52.700 --> 32:56.300
Santa Claus or what was the, you know, like that? Well, I wanted to have answers to everything.

32:56.300 --> 33:00.220
I wanted to have answers to everything from a very young age on, you know, I, I didn't tolerate

33:00.220 --> 33:05.900
very well when my parents couldn't give me answers to questions like, how did I get here? And, you

33:05.900 --> 33:10.140
know, what did they say? Yeah, what did they say? How did my mother was very religious? And so she

33:10.140 --> 33:15.180
would give me the religious explanation, which was of some satisfaction to me in my youth, you

33:15.180 --> 33:19.740
know, in my very young age. But but but it but it but it it appeased me, but it didn't answer my

33:19.740 --> 33:23.180
questions. And I kept the questions alive. And so when I eventually went into science,

33:24.860 --> 33:29.740
you know, as a young as a young man, I figured I need to get some answers here. And from what I've

33:29.740 --> 33:33.020
been studying and reading this, I decided this even in high school from what I've been studying

33:33.020 --> 33:35.900
and reading physics is the discipline where I'm most likely to be able to answer some of these

33:35.900 --> 33:41.420
questions. And that way I can, you know, get grants, be funded and try to figure this out.

33:41.420 --> 33:46.540
So that was the start of my interest in physics. But as an interdisciplinary scientist, I would

33:46.540 --> 33:51.020
often change fields. And every time I changed fields, I would discover that some some or the

33:51.020 --> 33:54.940
main paradigm in the field was incorrect. And I was very vocal about it. And so people would welcome

33:54.940 --> 33:57.820
me into the field. I would go to their conferences and then I would start asking questions and then

33:57.820 --> 34:02.940
I would point out that something didn't go well. And then sometimes they would excommunicate me

34:02.940 --> 34:06.700
and call me on the phone and yell at me that none of my students would ever get jobs and that they

34:06.700 --> 34:10.300
would never recommend me to speak at a conference, etc. etc. If I publish this next paper that I then

34:10.300 --> 34:14.780
would publish and or or they would say, wow, this is great. We're really happy because it

34:14.780 --> 34:18.540
contradicts our main competitor. And we don't like these guys and they're getting most of the

34:18.540 --> 34:21.180
funding right now. So we're going to invite you to conferences and you're going to be our guy

34:21.180 --> 34:24.780
because you are, you know, really smart and you're able to prove that they're wrong. So let's go.

34:24.780 --> 34:29.340
So I found that I would get, I would get noticed and attention and become part of the in-circle

34:29.340 --> 34:33.580
if I was, if the research that I was doing authentically was against a group that some

34:33.580 --> 34:38.860
others wanted to attack, you see. Yeah, got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay. So we're in your career. Yes.

34:38.860 --> 34:42.620
Have you have you ever found something that? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is wrong.

34:42.700 --> 34:47.100
Yeah. You said it was wrong. No, no, wait, wait, wait. And that nobody benefited from this and

34:47.100 --> 34:51.420
they embraced you. You know, for example, you suppose you were looking at autism and you found

34:51.420 --> 34:57.180
that, Oh, vaccines cause autism and you published a paper on it. Were you ever embraced by the

34:57.180 --> 35:01.340
scientific community? Because oh my gosh, you know, we've been struggling for whether vaccines

35:01.340 --> 35:06.380
cause autism are not for for tens of years. Yeah. You've you have a question. Right.

35:06.380 --> 35:11.660
So I understand and become known and recognized on a speaker at conferences in the new field.

35:11.660 --> 35:15.420
Maybe in my career, I don't know, five or six times. I'm very interdisciplinary. And I,

35:15.420 --> 35:19.260
it's very broad what I've covered everything from planetary science to theoretical physics.

35:19.260 --> 35:23.020
You name it. So I have never encountered a situation where people were happy because

35:23.020 --> 35:27.740
I'd actually discovered something. So what you have to understand is that scientists are looking

35:27.740 --> 35:33.980
for funds, grants, and social status and social status within the discipline and power and influence.

35:33.980 --> 35:37.420
And that's what they're looking for. And the bigger you are, the more you're looking for that.

35:37.500 --> 35:42.380
And so we at one point, we did make a major discovery. We solved a long standing problem in physics.

35:42.380 --> 35:46.620
My students and I, and we after, you know, almost a decade of working on it on and off with other

35:46.620 --> 35:51.260
projects, we solved it. We started trying to write about it. We submitted to the top journals.

35:51.260 --> 35:54.860
The reviewers wouldn't have it. We ended up having to submit to more specialized journals.

35:54.860 --> 35:59.420
It got published. Then a few people who didn't quite like the leaders in the field got us into

35:59.420 --> 36:04.140
a few of the conferences. Well, it was so antagonistic that a very brilliant student of mine who had

36:04.140 --> 36:08.460
worked with me on this problem gave up physics. He just went into the private sector. Yeah.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.300
And I at that point, essentially disillusioned by the response because it should have been a

36:12.300 --> 36:16.780
scientific response and it wasn't exactly. And I discovered then finally after, you know,

36:16.780 --> 36:21.420
I was in maybe mid career and I thought, wow, they don't want to know. They are not interested

36:21.420 --> 36:26.460
whatsoever. And at that point, I stopped putting my emphasis on physics and I shifted my research

36:26.460 --> 36:30.620
towards environmental science, environmental biogeochemistry. And I started learning about

36:30.620 --> 36:34.380
bacteria and nanoparticles in the environment and that kind of stuff and became really well

36:34.380 --> 36:37.900
known in that field and invited at conferences and everything. But I just was so disgusted

36:37.900 --> 36:42.300
with the whole thing. I mean, we solved an important problem. And it was a lot of fun.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.660
And intellectually, it was very stimulating. And I discovered that nobody wanted to know the answer.

36:46.300 --> 36:51.020
Can you tell us what the problem and answer was? I can tell you what the problem was, but

36:51.020 --> 36:55.500
the answer is let's say complex. But could you simplify it for our audience and do it in like

36:55.500 --> 37:00.300
two minutes? Yeah. So there is a metallic alloy that exists in the world that was discovered

37:00.300 --> 37:03.580
by a man named Guillaume, who won the Nobel Prize for discovering it. And it's called

37:03.580 --> 37:07.180
Envar. And that comes from the word invariable. And that's because it does not have thermal

37:07.180 --> 37:11.660
expansion. So it is a metallic alloy that you can use in manufacturing that has no thermal

37:11.660 --> 37:16.220
expansion at the temperature. Yeah, it was an amazing discovery. And it became it became a

37:16.220 --> 37:20.380
challenge for physicists and material scientists to understand why. What is the mechanism whereby

37:20.380 --> 37:25.020
this apparently simple metallic alloy has no thermal expansion? And that became known as the Envar

37:25.020 --> 37:31.820
problem. And it's been around for 100 years or more. And my team and I proved that every single

37:31.820 --> 37:37.260
dominant hypothesis and theory about why it operated could be proven experimentally to be wrong.

37:37.260 --> 37:41.420
Wow. And we postulated a solution that was consistent with everything. And we did theoretical

37:41.420 --> 37:46.220
calculations to show that our solution actually worked on the basis of quantum mechanics. And

37:46.220 --> 37:49.340
we did that. And we were published. One of the papers was published in Physical Review B,

37:49.340 --> 37:53.260
which is a top physics journal and so on. And then the people in the field, there were hundreds

37:53.260 --> 37:57.100
of researchers in the field, they wouldn't read it. They didn't care. They would keep

37:57.100 --> 38:02.540
pushing their own theories and so on. So we were really upset with it. So I remember discovering

38:02.540 --> 38:07.580
the effect. I remember I was in my office and I've been struggling with how this works for like

38:07.580 --> 38:15.420
a decade. And I finally clicked on a key aspect of the problem. And I ran down to my lab where

38:15.420 --> 38:18.220
there was a few students working late that night. And I said to one of them, and I remember him,

38:18.220 --> 38:21.500
he's in contact with me on Twitter now. His name is Ricardo. And I said Ricardo,

38:21.500 --> 38:24.620
I said, I just figured out the in-part problem. I think I've got it now. This is it. We're going

38:24.620 --> 38:27.900
to write a paper right away. And Ricardo wasn't working on the in-part problem. He was working on

38:27.900 --> 38:31.820
something else. And he looked at me and he made a big smile and he said, well, that's great to me.

38:31.820 --> 38:34.540
And he didn't ask me what it was about. He didn't ask me to explain it or anything. He just said,

38:34.540 --> 38:37.180
that's great. I'm happy for you. And now I'm just going to keep doing my stuff, right?

38:37.980 --> 38:42.460
So I thought, wow, even the people in my inner circle don't care, right? It's time to go into

38:42.460 --> 38:45.740
environmental science and I always did that kind of thing. Okay. So can you tell us what the

38:45.740 --> 38:50.780
solution is? Why doesn't it expand? Yeah. And did you actually do an experiment to confirm?

38:50.780 --> 38:55.100
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This was the correct mechanism? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We did lots of experiments.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.180
Okay. So what's the answer? Why doesn't it expand?

38:59.900 --> 39:04.140
How do you put this in a few words? The magnetic structure of this alloy is one where

39:04.860 --> 39:10.540
some of the magnetic links between neighboring iron atoms in this metallic alloy couple,

39:10.540 --> 39:13.980
in such a way that the little magnetic moments on the atoms are opposite each other. This is

39:13.980 --> 39:20.300
kind of local anti-feral magnetism. Okay. And this is how they want to be, but because of other

39:20.300 --> 39:25.260
neighboring atoms in the alloy, they're forced to be aligned. And because they're forced to be

39:25.260 --> 39:33.980
aligned, they, they repel each other to not be as aligned as they would be. And as a result,

39:33.980 --> 39:39.500
that repulsion cancels the contraction that you get when you, when you cool. Okay. And it

39:39.500 --> 39:43.340
exactly cancels. And you say you have to have exactly the right, we call it magnetic frustration.

39:43.340 --> 39:47.740
You have to have exactly the right kind of topological mixture of these moments fighting it out within

39:47.820 --> 39:52.380
the material and, and, and so on. So I, I use that when I, then I discovered it basically a

39:52.380 --> 39:56.700
perfect storm. Yeah, that's the, that's the kind of thing it is. And then I, that knowledge,

39:56.700 --> 40:02.380
I was able to use to demonstrate the magnetic solitons, why, why and how they move and how you

40:02.380 --> 40:06.460
can explain how they change the effects of magnetic materials. And that's what that paper is what

40:06.460 --> 40:09.260
eventually got me hired at the University of Ottawa. Wow. So anyway, that's, that's, that's

40:09.260 --> 40:13.500
the kind of thing. That's awesome. Okay. So let's switch back to, uh, to COVID vaccines.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.700
So are there any benefits from the COVID vaccine? Do you think there are any benefits whatsoever

40:16.700 --> 40:19.260
from the COVID vaccine infection, hospitalization, or mortality?

40:20.060 --> 40:27.580
48, did you, did you find any 48 minutes in? We are finally back to the COVID vaccines and we are

40:27.580 --> 40:36.540
asking if the COVID vaccines have any benefit. Um, so again, 48 minutes in, we're finally back to

40:36.540 --> 40:43.260
this. And now hopefully we're going to eventually get to the data besides the 17 million people

40:44.140 --> 40:50.220
in the shot. Anything that shows a core benefit. You see, Steve, there's a premise in your question

40:50.220 --> 40:54.380
that I don't agree with. Okay. And the premise in your question that I don't agree with is that

40:54.380 --> 41:00.300
there was out there something to get a benefit. Something? No, no, I'm not assuming. No, but I don't

41:00.300 --> 41:04.060
think there's an benefit at all. I just, no, no, no, no, no. I'm trying to be objective and say,

41:04.060 --> 41:09.180
let me explain the benefits of your question is. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. So our work has shown

41:09.820 --> 41:14.860
conclusively that there was no particularly virulent pathogen. I don't care if it leaked from a lab

41:14.860 --> 41:20.220
or if it arose naturally or anything like that, there was no particularly virulent pathogen.

41:20.220 --> 41:25.020
And there was nothing spreading. We can prove that there is no spread here. So there is no

41:25.020 --> 41:30.460
spreading. And the patterns of mortality are inconsistent at odds with the accepted theory of

41:30.460 --> 41:35.980
spread and epidemiology for a respiratory disease. And they are in can only be explained if you

41:36.060 --> 41:41.340
acknowledge that excess mortality occurred when you assaulted people. And assaulting people is

41:41.340 --> 41:46.220
not just by vaccines. The a lot of the very vicious assaults were simply the protocol, the

41:46.220 --> 41:52.380
treatment protocols. Absolutely totally. So we can correlate, we've shown maps and little

41:52.380 --> 41:55.740
gif films and everything where you try to see a spread and you don't see it. What you see instead

41:55.740 --> 41:59.980
is apply this protocol, big peak and mortality doesn't spread, doesn't exist anywhere where you

41:59.980 --> 42:03.500
don't apply the protocol, etc. Especially in adjacent countries, you'll have adjacent countries

42:03.500 --> 42:06.380
where it's where high mortality and the country next door has nothing.

42:06.380 --> 42:11.740
Exactly. So I think we were the ones who really argued that and who really showed it. And starting

42:11.740 --> 42:16.220
in starting in our first paper, the second of June 2020. You'll remember that one where we argued

42:16.220 --> 42:21.020
that this was a mass homicide, that the peaks that were occurring, that the virus was way 2020.

42:21.020 --> 42:25.980
We were the ones who really argued that and who really showed it. And starting in starting in

42:25.980 --> 42:30.300
our first paper, the second of June 2020, you'll remember that one, where we argued that this was

42:30.300 --> 42:34.380
a mass homicide, that the peaks that were occurring, that the virus was waiting for the

42:34.380 --> 42:37.180
political announcement of a pandemic before it decided to kill anyone. Exactly.

42:37.180 --> 42:43.740
There's nothing happening on China. Yeah, the virus is very smart. Yeah. And Steve was so aware

42:43.740 --> 42:50.540
of this virus being very smart that he started the, the, the early treatment foundation or whatever

42:50.540 --> 42:55.660
the hell it was called and organized, you know, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars

42:55.660 --> 43:01.340
for the research and funding of early treatment for this, you know, nothing burger that there

43:01.340 --> 43:08.700
is no evidence of spread. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And in June of 2020,

43:08.700 --> 43:13.660
he put out a paper that showed that there was no, it was just a mass casualty event.

43:13.660 --> 43:16.300
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

43:16.300 --> 43:23.500
Yeah. That's why Steve has spent the last four years talking about this, right, Steve?

43:27.500 --> 43:30.620
It's listed, the virus listens to the mainstream media and then decides whether to kill people or

43:30.620 --> 43:35.420
not. It is a political virus. And not only that, when the virus is created, it's created with a

43:35.420 --> 43:40.060
passport. So it does not cross jurisdictions between states, between provinces, between

43:40.060 --> 43:44.300
countries, it does, it has completely different behaviors depending on which passport it has.

43:44.380 --> 43:48.220
Yes. And it can cause incredible mass amounts of deaths in one place. And as you said,

43:48.220 --> 43:51.900
right beside it, nothing but then later, a year later in that place, a big peak that corresponds

43:51.900 --> 43:55.820
to what they're doing now, you see. Yeah. So we have demonstrated that there, there is, there was

43:55.820 --> 44:00.380
nothing to be saved from other than the medical establishment and governments that we need to

44:00.380 --> 44:03.500
be saved from those things. Right. And so if you want to make a vaccine to save us

44:07.420 --> 44:13.900
from those things, it has to be a difficult, difficult, the treatment protocols. Absolutely.

44:13.900 --> 44:23.100
Totally. We can prove that there is no spread here. So there is no spreading. And the patterns

44:23.100 --> 44:30.780
of mortality are inconsistent at odds with the accepted theory of spread and epidemiology for

44:30.780 --> 44:38.940
a respiratory disease. And they are in, can only be explained if you acknowledge that excess

44:39.020 --> 44:47.260
mortality occurred when you assaulted people. And assaulting people is not just by vaccines.

44:47.820 --> 44:53.500
The, a lot of the very vicious assaults were simply the protocol, the treatment protocols.

44:53.500 --> 45:00.940
Absolutely. Totally. So we can correlate, we can, we've shown maps and, and, and, and little

45:01.740 --> 45:06.620
GIF films and everything where you try to see a spread and you don't see it. What you see instead

45:06.700 --> 45:13.100
is apply this protocol, big peak in mortality, doesn't spread, doesn't exist anywhere where you

45:13.100 --> 45:18.380
don't apply the protocol, etc. Right. So especially adjacent countries, you'll have adjacent countries

45:18.380 --> 45:24.540
where, where high mortality and the country next door has nothing. Exactly. So I, I think we,

45:24.540 --> 45:31.980
we were the ones who really argued that and who really showed it. And starting in, starting in

45:31.980 --> 45:38.380
our first paper, the 2nd of June, 2020, you'll remember that one, where we argued that this was

45:38.380 --> 45:44.940
a mass homicide, that the peaks that were occurring, that the virus was waiting for the political

45:44.940 --> 45:50.220
announcement of a pandemic before it decided to kill anyone. Exactly. Nothing happening

45:50.780 --> 45:54.540
until the virus is cleared a pandemic. Yeah, the virus is very smart.

45:55.260 --> 46:01.420
Yeah. He keeps trying to interrupt him. And he keeps trying to claim in a really annoying sort

46:01.420 --> 46:08.700
of Brett Weinstein kind of way that he's always known that. That's why it took him so long to come

46:08.700 --> 46:17.500
out and say this, right? That's why it's taken him until now to say it, right? 50 minutes into his

46:17.500 --> 46:23.180
podcast, he's decided to say it. It was more important for him to first tell us a story about

46:23.180 --> 46:27.180
whatever he told us a story about that I can't even remember something about a lawyer

46:28.140 --> 46:36.700
instead of letting this man talk instead of getting this guy's message out succinctly and

46:36.700 --> 46:49.020
cleanly as possible. It is absolutely appalling to watch this egomaniac work his his enchantment

46:51.100 --> 46:55.020
where it's is it supposed to be some kind of privilege to hang out with him. That's why he

46:55.100 --> 47:02.300
can eat while he podcasts with people. Why he can ask how they make their living. How do you

47:02.300 --> 47:11.100
make your money? Did he really ask him that? He really wanted to tell him him to tell him how

47:11.100 --> 47:21.420
much he settled for. She whiz. Now you ask why I didn't sign an NDA and take $8,000 as I left

47:22.380 --> 47:25.020
or was laid off from CHD.

47:28.780 --> 47:33.340
Now you know, because I would interview with somebody like Steve Kirsch and he would be all,

47:33.340 --> 47:38.060
oh, well, I guess it was pretty good. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Why do you make a living now? Oh, yeah.

47:43.340 --> 47:46.140
This is the worst. This is the worst because

47:46.140 --> 47:53.740
Denny's trying his best. Denny's doing his best. Denny's being a gentleman and he's getting it

47:53.740 --> 48:00.940
out there. There's no evidence of spread. First paper 2nd of June 2020. Mass homicide. Excess

48:00.940 --> 48:07.180
mortality happens not only with transfection, but whenever the protocols are released in different

48:07.260 --> 48:16.860
places, perfectly said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah. Like you've ever said that, Steve.

48:17.980 --> 48:22.540
It's listed the virus listens to the mainstream media and then decides whether to kill people or

48:22.540 --> 48:29.740
not. It is a political virus. And not only that, when the virus is created, it's created with a

48:29.740 --> 48:36.780
passport. So it does not cross jurisdictions between states, between provinces, between

48:36.780 --> 48:42.540
countries. It does, it has completely different behaviors depending on which passport it has.

48:43.180 --> 48:49.100
Yes. And it can cause incredible mass amounts of deaths in one place. And as you said, right

48:49.100 --> 48:54.540
beside it, nothing. But then later, a year later in that place, a big peak that corresponds to

48:54.540 --> 49:00.380
what they're doing now, you see. Yeah. So we have demonstrated that there, there is, there was

49:00.380 --> 49:07.260
nothing to be saved from other than the medical establishment and governments that we needed to

49:07.260 --> 49:12.300
be saved from those things. Right. And so if you want to make a vaccine to save us from those

49:12.300 --> 49:18.860
things, it has to be a very toxic vaccine that you inject into the people who want to do that.

49:20.060 --> 49:24.780
It has to be a, wait a minute, it has to be a toxic vaccine that would save us from the assaults

49:24.780 --> 49:30.860
that they're, that they're, Oh, you mean you have to basically kill people with the vaccine

49:31.580 --> 49:36.860
so that you're saving them from the assaults by the government? Yes. No, he meant,

49:38.060 --> 49:42.220
no, he meant you would use the vaccine on the people in government. You dork,

49:43.100 --> 49:47.660
you use the vaccine on the people that would want to do this and then you make it really toxic.

49:47.660 --> 49:53.820
That's what he said. Man, oh man, you think the guy that invented the optic mouse would be able to

49:53.820 --> 50:01.420
have a conversation. My goodness. That's a convoluted joke. Okay, wait, yeah, yeah, got it. But

50:01.980 --> 50:09.580
as far as you can tell, there was no benefit from the vaccine from these vaccines. Is that a fair

50:09.580 --> 50:17.100
statement? There was nothing to be saved from. There was nothing out there to be saved from.

50:17.900 --> 50:27.900
That could be solved by the vaccine. There are people did get Steve is having a little bit of

50:27.900 --> 50:35.020
a breakdown. I might need to load up. I don't know how I don't have the old. I don't have the old

50:35.020 --> 50:46.940
file here. Shoot, I got to change that. I don't have my. No, I don't have my my funny sound effect.

50:47.260 --> 50:52.460
There would be with the oblivion sound effects that would help a little bit because I think Steve

50:52.460 --> 51:01.340
is about to have a little tiny bit of a there's going to be some kind of gear grinding here. Hold on

51:01.340 --> 51:06.060
infected with COVID. Right. Some people were infected with COVID. Here we go. Is that a fair

51:06.060 --> 51:13.900
statement that you're saving them from the assaults by the government? Yes. Okay. All right. But

51:13.900 --> 51:20.220
sorry. That's a complicated joke. Okay. Wait. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. But as far as you can tell,

51:20.220 --> 51:26.620
there was no benefit from the vaccine from these vaccines. Is that a fair statement?

51:29.340 --> 51:33.820
How could there be a benefit if there was nothing out there to be saved from?

51:34.620 --> 51:43.740
That could be solved by vaccine. There are people did get infected with COVID, right?

51:45.100 --> 51:51.660
I don't know. I have no evidence of that. Oh, I do. I mean, I got infected with COVID.

51:52.220 --> 51:59.660
I had a lateral flow assay test. When I got sick and started having symptoms, my wife had symptoms,

51:59.740 --> 52:06.300
she checked herself positive. I then caught it from her. I started to have symptoms. I tested

52:06.300 --> 52:13.020
myself positive, treated myself with so he's told this story before that there was he actually

52:13.020 --> 52:20.940
witnessed a chain of infection, which included lateral flow tests that were positive for his

52:20.940 --> 52:28.220
wife before they were positive for him. And that temporal positivity indicates, you know,

52:28.220 --> 52:35.580
along with the test, the testimony of symptoms indicates that indeed there was transmission in

52:35.580 --> 52:40.780
his household. So I hope that that Denny's going to take a swing at this one. It'll be interesting.

52:40.780 --> 52:45.500
I hope he just tells him, well, that could also just be random. How could there be a benefit

52:45.500 --> 52:53.740
if there was nothing out there to be saved from? That could be solved by vaccine.

52:54.700 --> 53:02.300
There are people did get infected with COVID, right? I don't know. I have no evidence of that.

53:02.300 --> 53:09.340
Oh, I do. I mean, I got infected with COVID. I had a lateral flow assay test.

53:10.780 --> 53:16.300
When I got sick and started having symptoms, my wife had symptoms, she checked herself positive.

53:16.940 --> 53:23.020
I then caught it from her. I started to have symptoms. I tested myself positive, treated my

53:23.100 --> 53:29.500
wife at symptoms. I mean, I got infected with COVID. I had a lateral flow assay test.

53:30.940 --> 53:38.620
I have no evidence of that. Listen carefully. I mean, I got infected with COVID. I had a lateral

53:38.620 --> 53:44.780
flow assay test. When I got sick and started having symptoms, my wife had symptoms, she checked

53:44.780 --> 53:51.500
herself positive. I then caught it from her. I started to have symptoms. I tested myself

53:51.500 --> 53:59.900
positive, treated myself with a recommended protocol. It took a couple of weeks for the

53:59.900 --> 54:04.140
test to go negative. The test was indicating something that was correlated with mine.

54:04.140 --> 54:10.940
It was indicating something. Look, I don't question that these PCR tests as bad as they are.

54:10.940 --> 54:13.660
Well, there's not a PCR test. There's a lateral flow assay test.

54:13.660 --> 54:22.140
Okay. What was it measuring? Anybody's or presence of antigen?

54:26.940 --> 54:32.220
A lot of tests were approved for presence of antigen.

54:37.020 --> 54:39.900
A lot of tests were approved on an emergency base.

54:40.060 --> 54:52.620
A lot of tests were approved on an emergency basis and are completely unreliable. I've written

54:52.620 --> 55:00.780
about that. But your personal experience and how you understand it is not something that we can

55:00.780 --> 55:09.100
debate. But people get sick all the time. There are viral respiratory problems of all kinds

55:09.100 --> 55:18.780
all the time in so-called influenza, which they supposedly can test for, can cause you to have

55:18.780 --> 55:25.420
memory loss, loss of taste. All the weird symptoms that people are talking about have

55:25.420 --> 55:33.420
occurred and are documented. I don't know. I'm not personally convinced that there was something

55:33.500 --> 55:39.500
particularly new or special. I'm just telling you my position.

55:42.780 --> 55:49.340
Sure. The other thing is I have looked at the scientific literature and continue to research

55:49.340 --> 55:58.780
it for firm evidence that it has been demonstrated that you can spread a viral respiratory disease.

55:58.780 --> 56:05.100
In other words, that you can cause infection in a person using a virus. And I have not found

56:05.100 --> 56:13.660
any scientifically. Okay. For example, if you look at the work of Professor Sheldon Cohen,

56:13.660 --> 56:21.180
an American who spent his entire career trying to infect college age university students in the

56:21.180 --> 56:26.940
US when you were allowed to do that with what he thought was influenza. He had, you know, he had

56:26.940 --> 56:32.940
cultures, he was culturing this stuff and he would put the fluid, either vaporize it into their

56:32.940 --> 56:39.500
into their noses or deposit it or drop it in or into their eyes into their nose every way that he

56:39.500 --> 56:50.940
could. Did he try injecting it? No. And he, no, he's not injecting, he's trying to stimulate how

56:50.940 --> 56:57.580
you would catch it. You know, that the idea, what he found was, and this is really important.

56:58.460 --> 57:08.300
The people who got sick are the ones who had a significant psychological stress in their life.

57:08.300 --> 57:14.140
Wow. And this, these were the biggest factors that determined whether or not you were going to get

57:14.140 --> 57:20.780
sick is psychological stress that you were experiencing in your life and social isolation.

57:21.500 --> 57:25.740
So the college students that were didn't have a big social network and were socially isolated.

57:25.740 --> 57:33.260
Wow. And, and, and were stressed, they got sick and the more isolated and the more stressed they were,

57:33.260 --> 57:39.420
the sicker they got when they did get sick. But there was no relation to the, to what he was

57:39.420 --> 57:44.460
trying to do. Yeah. No, that's right. That's fascinating. And there are many, many studies

57:44.460 --> 57:50.380
like this. There are studies. Dennis sounds like Denny sounds like he's a no virus guy now.

57:51.340 --> 57:55.900
Denny sounds like he doubts the transmissibility of RNA pathogens. Uh oh.

57:56.860 --> 58:03.180
There were at the turn of the century, there was an island in the US where they had a lot of military

58:03.180 --> 58:10.940
personnel and they decided to do an experiment to see if the 1918 contagion would spread and

58:10.940 --> 58:16.060
they couldn't get it to spread. They were, they were, they were forcing the soldiers to be in the

58:16.060 --> 58:21.740
same bunks and then sleeping side by side and you know, they may have asked them to kiss. I don't

58:21.740 --> 58:26.460
know. But they couldn't get the thing to spread. There was like thousands of soldiers on this isolated

58:26.540 --> 58:31.660
island. Right. And they could never get us. Yeah, but you, but you have it there. There are many,

58:31.660 --> 58:38.140
there are many, uh, yeah, but yeah, but yeah, but I mean, conversely, yeah, but yeah, but

58:38.140 --> 58:43.980
conversely, you have lots of examples where doctors swear that yeah, but it happened in my house.

58:47.100 --> 58:52.780
Epidemologists through, throughout the last 100 years who have written on the basis of their

58:52.780 --> 58:59.740
careers that these things don't spread. Right. Okay. There's conversely, what about the cruise

58:59.740 --> 59:06.860
ships? You know, we had these cruise ships where someone, someone, someone was, was diagnosed with

59:06.860 --> 59:12.780
COVID. And so they, they locked down the whole cruise ship. And then, uh, days later, you have

59:12.780 --> 59:19.660
hundreds of people on the cruise ship that now have, uh, you know, they, they turn positive. So

59:19.660 --> 59:25.020
how do, how do you explain that? Oh, here we go. It's not hard to explain that you just have to,

59:25.020 --> 59:29.500
have to admit that it cannot, that it doesn't have to be explained by the spread hypothesis.

59:30.460 --> 59:33.820
And, and the epidemologists have been saying this for a hundred years. They said, look,

59:36.700 --> 59:45.180
look, it's grinding right now. Oh, it hurts. Oh, yeah, but we know the phenomenon that in the same

59:45.260 --> 59:51.660
household, people will often get a similar respiratory disease. That does not spread. That

59:51.660 --> 59:57.500
proves that these individuals are subjected to the same conditions and are subjected to each

59:57.500 --> 01:00:03.980
other's stress and are subjected, you know, and so that, that there's the ability to it. This,

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:09.260
I mean, you've got a bunch of old people locked onto a ship. What do you think's going to happen?

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:15.820
All right. Okay. So I'm going to switch topics real quick. Um, yeah, with respect to, to COVID.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:22.700
Okay. So, um, I'll claim so we can have a discussion about it. Uh, and, and I actually actually believe

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:29.500
this, that, that there is a COVID virus that has been sequenced. It's in GenBank and it's unique.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:36.380
And it's a, it's a novel, uh, viral pathogen. Okay. True.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:42.620
Oh, he's taking the Kevin McCurran position, taking the high road. Here he goes.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:49.020
Standing behind a whole wall of Illumina sequencers humming away. It must be true.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:58.380
Agree or agree or disagree? Agree or disagree? I do. COVID-19 is a real virus. Agree or disagree.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.340
Oh, man. I didn't, I ran out of time. I'm sorry. It was too much pressure.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:12.860
What an interview this is. Why don't you get another bowl of pasta or something and let Dennis talk?

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:18.380
Uh, and, and I actually actually believe this, that, that there is a COVID virus that has been

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:24.700
sequenced. It's in GenBank and it's unique. And it's, you, it's a novel, uh, switch topic.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:30.860
Is this a, is this a testament of faith? I actually believe this says, says Steve Kirsch.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:36.140
Stop lying. Listen to this. Um, yeah. Uh, with respect to, uh, COVID.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:42.700
Okay. So, uh, I'll claim so we can have a discussion about it. Uh, and, and I actually,

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.580
actually believe this, that I'll claim and I actually believe this. I'll claim it so we can

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:53.900
have a discussion about it, but I actually believe it. It's really a thing that I believe.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.020
I'd like to take this position because I want to have a discussion about it, but also

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.620
because it's something that I believe. Well, interesting Steve. What an interesting thing to

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:11.260
take a position on. This, I mean, you, you've got a bunch of old people locked onto a ship.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:15.980
What do you think's going to happen? All right. Okay. So I'm going to switch topics real quick.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:23.100
Yeah. Uh, with respect to COVID. Okay. So, oh my gosh, I almost twisted my mental ankles here

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.300
because he twisted, he's changing topics so fast. It's like he, he crossed me out. I'll claim

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:33.820
so we can have a discussion about it. Uh, and, and I actually actually believe this, that, that there

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:40.860
is a COVID virus that has been sequenced. It's in GenBank and it's unique. And it's, you, it's a

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:48.460
novel, uh, viral, uh, pathogen. Okay. True. Agree or agree or disagree?

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.460
I, I do not. Well, let me put it this way.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.700
I have, I plan to get in there and find out exactly what they're doing. Okay. But

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.380
in my beginning research, he plans to get in there, but he hasn't gotten in there yet. It's

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:12.380
something that I also heard earlier that he from himself to me that he plans to do it. So I do look

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:20.380
forward to him diving into it. So far, my deep dive into this whole thing has brought me out with

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:26.140
several conclusions. Um, most of which revolve around the fact that a lot of these people are

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:32.300
grossly overextended in what their fidelity of understanding is and what they claim it to be.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:40.460
I haven't, I haven't really met a person yet talking molecular biology with any kind of humility.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:51.260
It is the powerful molecular biological methodologies that are indisputable at this stage in Emily

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:56.940
Cop's presentation. It is the molecular biology that's indisputable at this point

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:04.220
when it comes to the extremely rare features of this novel coronavirus. And this rare features

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:11.020
have been high fidelity sequenced millions of times in the last four years. And I believe this,

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.980
I'm not just going to take this position. I actually believe this says Steve Kirsch.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.420
Do you agree or disagree?

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:32.220
I agree that it's remarkable that we claim to have produced 15 million snapshots of a

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:39.020
continuously evolving genome, which supposedly hijacks our own cellular machinery to replicate

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:45.660
itself. And it has done so successfully over the last five years that we've been able to track

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:54.380
several waves of genetic mutation as they cross the Earth, as they cross the Earth. And the only

01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:00.940
reason why these genetic mutations so uniformly cross the Earth is because we're such a globally

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:07.660
connected society with an interlinked set of economies and a highly mobile population.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:15.100
Right, that's the mythology that we're arguing about here. That's the kind of thing that we're

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:19.420
really trying to say here, right? That's what he wants you to agree or disagree.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:25.980
Which on the topic, what I'm finding is that the genetic sequencing methods are highly

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:35.420
unreliable, patchy, fabricated. I mean, you name it. So, okay, you, you, you,

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:43.900
Oh, we got to get Kevin McCurnan and, and, and Denny Rancor on the, on the Vaccine Safety Research

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.700
Council podcast to let him duke it out there. And that'll be, that'll be pretty exciting.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:54.860
Wow, that'll be like Ryu and Ken on, uh, on Street Fighter. That'll be nuts.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:06:01.900
Do this. Like one, one, one area that I did do some reading on was this whole notion of these

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:08.300
new variants of concern that are supposed to arise. Okay. The science of that, let me tell you,

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:13.740
Steve, the science of that they never used to do this before, before COVID. And there are hardly

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:18.300
no site, rigorous scientific papers that demonstrate that this is even a thing.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:24.300
What it is is government websites with nice graphs of prevalence of different variants.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:28.940
And when you look at the fine print and how they actually do this, what they do is they,

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.660
they ask a bunch of labs to send in their genetic sequencing bits and pieces,

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:40.460
and they look for pieces that are more common. And they assign that to a variant of concern.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.220
And they don't look at all the others anymore, even though they get hundreds,

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:50.220
hundreds of different sequences and so on. And then they design a PCR that will detect those

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:55.980
pieces in particular. And then they send those out for people to measure it. And then they confirm

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.940
through that with a very small sample that that's the prevalent thing that's happening. And then

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:07.420
they draw this beautiful graph. Now, I've, I've read the fine print. I've looked at the papers.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.060
I know a bit about, I know a lot about molecular science and how you measure things in science.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:17.580
Okay, I used to teach that at the gradual level. Yeah, I used to teach spectroscopy,

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:23.580
diffraction microscopy. I had an electron microscope in my lab. I had spectrometers in my lab. I was

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:29.100
the head researcher. I know about that stuff. Okay. And I can tell you, the science of these

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:37.100
variants and their prevalence is garbage. It's garbage science. It has no value whatsoever.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.380
Now this could be something right here. This could be something because according to Kevin McCurnan,

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:48.860
these 15 million sequences, whether you like it or not, whether some of them have been done with

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.460
the Arctic primer set or not and have a bias because they were done with the Arctic primer set,

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:58.540
you're going to have to accept the fact that a good portion of these have been done with good

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:03.580
old-fashioned saying or sequencing. And that means you're just going to have to suck it up and believe

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:11.500
that these things are real. Now we can go open his sub stack and you can read those words for yourself.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:17.340
But I assure you, that's the argument that he makes. He says that, yeah, there could be a lot

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:22.940
of bias with PCR because we use the same primers or we use primers that are that are going to pick

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.900
up things. And if they pick up things, then we're going to assume that it's picking up those things.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:34.700
And so that does bias this, but it's not everybody who's using the Arctic primers. Some people use

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:42.540
saying or sequencing. I almost feel like we should look it up right now just so you see how

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:49.260
intense this is right now. We are at the cusp of having somebody move this ball forward farther

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:55.420
than it's ever moved before because we were pushing on the exact same part of the dam that

01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:02.380
he's now pushing up. This part where you say that this whole variant thing is way out of control.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:12.780
This next strain analysis is way out of control. They are implying a fidelity that is impossible

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:22.380
for them to have. We know from attending the basic virology lectures of Vincent,

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:31.660
Rach and yellow, that a consensus sequence is a consensus sequence that might not even exist

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:40.300
in nature. It's like a best guess average. And yet these sequences are deposited into this website

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:46.700
and charted on next strain as though they reflect a definitive molecule that has been found and

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:56.140
purified. And of course, this is part of the sort of bedrock objections to this kind of discussion

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:03.100
of virology that Stephen Lanka has been pushing forward for years that I suspect that Doosberg

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:07.500
has been pushing forward for years. And now the latest people to push it are the Bailey's

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:17.420
and and Kaufman and Colin who on most of these issues with regard to the actual RNA viruses,

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.580
the stuff that they purport to find in the wild, they've always been 100% right.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:30.060
But don't tell me for one second that they've been playing this 100% for our grandchildren when

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:37.420
they've also attached themselves to things like frozen water memory and tried to confuse frozen

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:44.620
water emotional memory with the kind of electrostatic emotional memory residents that

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.940
Luke Montane was trying to look at specifically with regard to DNA.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:57.580
So this is a really crucial time for us to be able to accurately remember what happened over

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:06.220
the last four years because with a subtle tweak with just a guy goofing off on too much coffee

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:13.340
going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Claiming that he somehow knew that the protocols have

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:18.140
always been murder and that he's regularly advocating for the justice that those families

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:29.340
deserve when he's clearly not when he's not doing the addition subtraction multiplication

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:33.500
and division that leads to the conclusion that if there was no evidence of spread,

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:40.140
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The virus has passport. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:46.860
I'm borders. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But if the virus isn't spreading, then what do we need early

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.540
treatment funding for Steve? If the virus isn't spreading, then what do we need? What do we need

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:58.540
two shots of Moderna for Steve? Why did your cleaner and the cleaner's husband and the cleaner's

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:03.700
cousin die, Steve, if there was no spread and the protocols were the only thing that

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.020
killing people that if you do all the addition and all the subtraction in the division and

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.300
the math stuff, you know, that you're so good at because you got the New Zealand data and

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.740
you've been analyzing that data in all different ways.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:22.580
Well, let's just do the basic math on all cause mortality on what happened in New York

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.580
City.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:29.820
Jessica Hawkins data that she's been trying to get more thoroughly looked at.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.580
Not much math that you got to do there.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.540
That looks like a bomb.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:43.780
And so if there was no evidence of spread, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:49.620
And yet you were involved in the funding early treatment and propelling this, this idea

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.820
in the background that there was a national security priority that needed all hands on

01:12:53.820 --> 01:13:01.980
deck, including people scrambling to come up with patentable combinations of drugs under

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.900
the guise of repurposed.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:16.420
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this could be a moment here.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.900
Go get them, Danny, go get them, Danny, go get them, Danny.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.460
I know a bit about, I know a lot about molecular science and how you measure things in science.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.740
Okay, I used to teach that at the gradual level.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:34.300
I used to teach spectroscopy, diffraction, microscopy, I had an electron microscope in

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.300
my lab.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.660
I had spectrometers in my lab.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.300
I was the head researcher.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.580
I know about that stuff.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.580
Okay.

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:45.940
And I can tell you the science of these variants and their prevalence is garbage.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.940
It has no value.

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.940
Yeah.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:49.940
Yeah.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Yeah.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.940
Yeah.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.940
Yeah.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.940
Yeah.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.940
Yeah.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.940
Yeah.

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.940
Right.

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.940
Yeah.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:58.940
Variants are garbage.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940
Yeah.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.940
Right.

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.940
Yeah.

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.940
CDC official says, Oh, at that time it was Omicron.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.940
Oh, at that time it was Delta.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.940
It's crap.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.940
It's complete nonsense.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.940
You're in a, we're in Lala land here.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.940
Okay.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.940
Okay.

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940
So that.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940
Where's yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940
Oh, I get it.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940
I understand.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.940
Yeah.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.940
Yeah.

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:20.940
Yeah.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.940
Where is that?

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.940
We got to move on quick, I think.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.940
Oh, at that time it was Delta.

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.940
It's crap.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.940
It's complete nonsense.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.940
You're in a, we're in Lala land here.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940
Okay.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.940
Okay.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.940
So, so that's the variance in.

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:36.940
Okay.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.940
But getting back to my original question.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.940
Do you believe that there was a novel pathogen that was introduced into the world.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.940
Somewhere around.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.940
Yeah, 2020.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:53.940
You know, honor, honor.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.940
Do you believe.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.940
Do you believe in the novel pathogen?

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.940
Tell me now, do you believe?

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:07.940
Because if you're not going to profess your faith, you can leave this temple now.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:09.940
About 2020.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.940
Do you believe that a novel pathogen?

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.940
At this stage of my, at this stage of my study.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.940
I am not at all convinced that viruses.

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.940
Has a.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.940
Pandemic causing agent exist.

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.940
Oh, bingo.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.940
No, no, but that's not what it.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.940
But that's not what I asked.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.940
I asked whether there's a novel pathogen.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.940
That was introduced in 2020.

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.940
Yes or no.

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.940
I don't see any evidence for it.

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.940
I don't see any reason to postulate that or any evidence for it.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.940
Okay.

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.940
Okay.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.940
So now let me give you some evidence for it and let me see if you can go.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.940
Oh my gosh.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.940
This is totally going to be a wizard.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.940
This is going to be amazing.

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:02.940
I almost feel like I need to find more, more to drink or something, but this is going to

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.940
be amazing whether there's a novel pathogen.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.940
That was introduced in 2020.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.940
Yes or no.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.940
Get him Danny.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.940
I don't see any evidence for it.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.940
I don't see any reason to postulate that or any evidence for it.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.940
Okay.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.940
Okay.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.940
So now let me give you some evidence for it and let me see if you can go and

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:24.940
dispute that evidence or agree with me because let me see if I can change your mind.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:25.940
Okay.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.940
I'm going to.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.940
I know this is hard.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.940
Now he's going to change bread into coronavirus.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.940
He's going to show him the proof.

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.940
Because you're a smart guy.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940
Okay.

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.940
So talk to a paramedic.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:49.940
Oh, talk to a paramedic said, I've never seen anybody who, you know, they do these, the, the, um,

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.940
SPO two measures, you know, they do that on the, on the finger.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.940
And is that something to do with the viscosity of blood or something like that?

01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:58.940
Yeah.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:59.940
Yeah.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.940
Yeah.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.940
Yeah.

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.940
Well, um, the, the, the cause is we can, we can argue about that.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.940
But the point is that the paramedic has been doing his job for decades.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940
Yes.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:16.940
He's never seen anybody survive with an SPO two of like 50.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.940
And so he's measuring these people with an SPO two of 50.

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.940
And these people are like, you know, just like normal people.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.940
I'm not familiar with SPO.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:34.940
No, see, the question becomes, and, and if there's a paramedic in the audience or in the, in the chat, please, please tap it in.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.940
But is that a normal thing to do?

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:46.940
Do you normally look at the blood oxygen level with a little infrared fingerprint on the way to the hospital? Is that a normal thing?

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.940
Um, is that something that was standard before the pandemic?

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:57.940
Or is that something of a device that they started selling us during the pandemic as something not only to move and buy?

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:05.940
But to legitimize this idea that there are measurements to be made and, and other things besides, you know, putting a thermometer under your tongue.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:15.940
Because I kind of have the feeling that that's what that little device became is like this extra sort of, well, if you don't have one of those, you better get one of those.

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:22.940
I still think just if you want any advice just for free advice, you know, this is a million dollar piece of advice.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.940
If you're going to give a gift to anybody who's having their first baby, please don't buy any bullshit.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:36.940
Just buy them a digital thermometer that can be swiped across the forehead or read the infrared in their ear.

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:43.940
There's nothing better for a new parent than be able to check the temperature of a crying baby and at least know that it ain't that.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940
Anyway, here we go.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:51.940
Two is I don't know if you're measuring oxygen, a dissolution in the blood or viscosity.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.940
I don't know what you're measuring there.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.940
Yeah, no, no, it's not it's not viscosity.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.940
It is the oxygen saturation of the blood.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.940
Okay.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:18:59.940
Okay.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.940
And so they have these these spio two meters.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.940
You haven't seen these faint these little devices.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.940
You stick on your finger.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.940
Yeah.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940
Okay.

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:08.940
Okay.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:16.940
So as a paramedic, but it's an SBO two meter, meaning that it uses a light to do something to measure your blood.

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:17.940
It's not like it.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.940
It's it's got to be calibrated.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.940
It's got to have some kind of error range.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.940
You know, it's not some kind of ultra accurate thing because it's sampling your blood directly.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.940
I mean, so it's it's a little.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940
It's a proxy measurement.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.940
Yes.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.940
He's never in his career.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.940
Nobody's ever heard of this stuff before.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:43.940
And with these COVID cases, he's saying these cases, the cases where there was a high value of this indicator.

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:45.940
The person wasn't bad.

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.940
What you're saying?

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:51.940
Well, if if someone is an SBO two of, I will say Albert, I saw that.

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:55.940
And I will say, Denny spoke to me in private.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:01.940
And when we talked about this 17 million number from his perspective, it's an ultra underestimate.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.940
He didn't want to have a high end estimate.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:11.940
Like it's it's definitely meant to be conservative so that, you know, it nobody could really.

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:19.940
That's why the debate with Tracy Beth Hogue was so weird because he he or he could have easily.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:25.940
They could easily show that their their projection, you know, is is conservative.

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.940
So I'm sure you found that for a 50.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.940
They normally be dead.

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:37.940
So in the cases where this that this paramedic has seen, he's seen SBO twos of a 50.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.940
Those people were dead.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940
No, they were fun.

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:47.940
Well, no, they had, if they had COVID, they could have an SBO two or 50 and they'd be like, like normal.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.940
He couldn't believe it.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:49.940
He's like, there must be some.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:54.940
So imagine a scenario where somebody was exposed to a toxin or a.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.940
Transfection, and it changed.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:02.940
The reading on one of these things because.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.940
It's it's not really clear to me how low this number can go.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:11.940
But if you have that number at 50, my guess is that you're not getting you're not walking to the ambulance.

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.940
You're not walking to the hospital.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.940
I don't.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.940
But again, I'm way out of my league here.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.940
So I'm not going to.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:18.940
I'm not going to.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.940
I don't want to.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.940
Did I forget to do that, darn it?

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.940
That's that's too bad.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940
I don't want to.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.940
I don't want to make it about that.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.940
I just keep listening.

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:35.940
Nothing wrong with my meter, you know, so that they tested in the hospital and they verified this.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.940
He's it's it's this known thing.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.940
I'm going to put you in touch with with this guy.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:47.940
But this is this is well known on lots of paramedics have seen this and they've never seen it before.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:52.940
Well, if it wasn't if it wasn't a novel pathogen, how would you explain that?

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:57.940
And by the way, all these people tested positive on the the PCR for COVID.

01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:58.940
Right.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.940
And all these people tested positive.

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:04.940
You see, this is where we know that there's hand waving going on.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.940
He doesn't have that data.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.940
They don't have that data.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:16.940
The paramedic took them to the hospital and knows for sure that they all tested positive during New York City.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.940
They didn't even have tests for the first month or so.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:24.940
Like, I don't even know why we have to have these kinds of bullshit discussions where people say that.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.940
Oh, I talked to this one guy and he says that all of his friends said.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:37.940
And so I don't know how you're going to argue with that because I've also got my housekeeper and her two cousins.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:45.940
And it becomes a real waste of time, you know, because really we should just be talking to Danny and asking him more about what his data can show us.

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.940
Super frustrating.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.940
So here's my answer to that and many similar anecdotes.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:53.940
Okay.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:04.940
Clinicians, whether they're paramedics answering emergency calls or clinicians in hospital receiving patients that come in or whatever.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:11.940
Clinicians are seeing people come in with conditions they haven't seen before.

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:25.940
But the biggest impact on a person's health and physiology, blood chemistry, everything is experienced psychological stress.

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:30.940
This is not debatable. This is scientifically known. There's no doubt about that.

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.940
The thing that the biggest.

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:43.940
So from a panic attack, for example, if they told you on the news that something was spreading and you thought you were getting it and you introduced, you induced yourself into psychosis, like a real panic attack.

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:45.940
Could you have a lower? I don't know.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.940
I don't know.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:54.940
But that's, I think, what Denny's getting at here is that these, this is possibly a James Giordano prediction.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:01.940
You see in a few cases and then you tell everybody and you'll have every hypochondriac and every worry well.

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.940
Banging on the door.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:10.940
The determinant of your health is where you are in the social hierarchy, in the dominance hierarchy in the society.

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:20.940
And the reason that's the biggest determinant is because you are subjected to stress or aggressions to keep you in your place within the dominance hierarchy.

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:26.940
And it is random aggression. It's your bosses. It's all that your superiors. It's the way people look at you. It's all that stuff.

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.940
And that's stress, especially if it's random and it's increased.

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:36.940
I thank you for that comment in the chat. You can't hypervate on that yourself in the hypoxia. That makes sense.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.940
Has absolutely devastating consequences on your health.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:53.940
So you're looking at a period where the government has decided to assault everyone, scare them all to hell, physically assault, get them to go and get tested, get them to this, lock them down.

01:24:53.940 --> 01:25:01.940
If they test positive, they're basically brought into a treatment cycle and so on.

01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:11.940
You're telling everyone we're all going to die from this pandemic and you're running around locking people up and changing all the rules in society.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:20.940
And not only that, you got these people on the internet who are running around saying that a billion people are going to die and that's 15 days of lockdown is not nearly enough.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:26.940
We need to do 60 days of hard lockdown.

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:37.940
You got these people on the intellectual dark web that are saying that we didn't lock down hard enough and that's why we were still not at zero COVID and that zero COVID is still a goal that we should get to.

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:54.940
We have these people on the intellectual dark web that are saying that if everybody just took Ibermectin and fluvoxamine for 60 days, the pandemic would be over.

01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:05.940
You're preventing people who normally have work in the black market or whatever their activities are from doing any of their activities and they're now infectious, poisonous, dangerous people.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:12.940
You are stressing the society out like completely unusual circumstances.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:19.940
Now in these completely unusual circumstances, there is going to be a lot of unusual health problems.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:23.940
And it's going to be complicated and it's going to be all over the map.

01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:39.940
And the system that is most affected by your immune system being affected by distress is your respiratory system because it's the biggest organ other than your skin in contact with the environment.

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:47.940
It's a fragile organ and you're breathing in air or not breathing in enough air or whatever.

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.940
And air is loaded with crap.

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:51.940
Oh, he just shook his head.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.940
No.

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:53.940
He just shook his head.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.940
No.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.940
Or not breathing in enough air or whatever.

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.940
And air is loaded with.

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:01.940
Oh man.

01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.940
He's putting bacteria.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.940
I love it, Denny.

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.940
I absolutely love this.

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:06.940
I love where he's going.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.940
I love what he's doing here.

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.940
He's doing exactly what I would do if I had thought of it in this scenario.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:19.940
He's trying to explain that you have the surface area of a tennis court in your chest.

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:25.940
And that surface area of a tennis court is about one cell thick from you being the outside world.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:32.940
Like there's, it's a very fragile barrier between your blood and the outside world.

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:40.940
And at this interface, your immune system is working constantly, constantly.

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.940
It's not a sterile environment.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:49.940
Most of the time, except for when a novel pathogen comes in the mail from Amazon.

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.940
Wow.

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.940
Where's the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:59.940
You know, but when you are stressed, you don't even need the air to be dirty.

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:09.940
You already have an entire universe of potential pathogens in your respiratory tract that can

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:14.940
become lethal if they go into your lungs and you have a weakened immune system.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940
Oh, really?

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:23.940
That sounds like those two doctors that we covered back in like May or April of 2020,

01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:28.940
the dudes that had like the, the one guy with the dark hair that had like the almost wind tunnel

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:34.940
tested hairdo, those guys were awesome and everybody made fun of them.

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:39.940
And they were the most fantastically spot on point people ever.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:45.940
Talking about the fact that there's an ecosystem of microbes that are already present.

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:51.940
That you, you are, you know, like this is not just some sterile environment.

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.940
Oh my gosh, this is just brilliant.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.940
This is just brilliant.

01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:01.940
He's trying to read his, his little chat down there to see if his handlers have any,

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.940
have any hints on how to get this train back on track.

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:07.940
It ain't happening.

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:08.940
It ain't happening.

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:09.940
Transmitting anything.

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:17.940
You've got a zillion different pathogens and, and, and, and what pathogens you have in your mouth

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.940
or in your intestine or anywhere is completely different from person to person depending on

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.940
what you eat, what your habits are reading habits are everything.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.940
So this is a complex system.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:33.940
And the biggest knob that you turn to decide whether or not people are going to be sick

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.940
is experience psychological stress and social isolation.

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:38.940
Wow.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.940
Wow.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.940
It's like really neuroscience there.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.940
He's doing neurobiology now.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.940
Stress to animals gets sick.

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.940
That's it.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.940
I love it.

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.940
I absolutely, I absolutely love it.

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:56.940
This is some of the best stuff that I've seen in, in six months.

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:00.940
It turned up experienced psychological stress and they socially isolated everyone.

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:08.940
Of course you're going to have a myriad of medical problems, especially among the frail,

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.940
especially among those who already had that problem.

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:20.940
So we showed in the United States archive that the people who died were in the poor states.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.940
The more poverty there was in the state.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.940
Go down.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.940
That was correlated.

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:25.940
Those are the people who died.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:26.940
Who are those people?

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.940
They're also the same people who normally get 50%.

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:33.940
Sometimes twice as many antibiotic prescriptions.

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:38.940
You really should look at Meredith Miller's presentation that she did on my stream.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:45.940
It was a really good take from a psychologist perspective on what they did to us and how

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.940
they did it.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:52.940
And this is perfect to cue in with the idea that this kind of stress and isolation led

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.940
to a lot of the sickness that we attributed to COVID because we were using tests to to

01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:58.940
attribute it to COVID.

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:04.940
That's going to be a lot of unusual symptoms that clinicians are going to say and clinicians

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.940
are subjected to the same propaganda.

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.940
We're all going to die from this novel pathogen.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.940
And so they're wearing those glasses and that's what they see.

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.940
And then let me finish.

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:15.940
One more thing.

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:19.940
And then some of these clinicians decide to use ivermectin.

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:21.940
And guess what?

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:28.940
ivermectin is extremely powerful in aiding bacterial lung infection.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.940
It's antibiotic properties for bacteria that infect the lung are tremendous.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:40.940
So you've got this clinician now saving people's lives who have a bacterial infection and

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:45.940
they're not allowed to prescribe antibiotics and they save them with ivermectin and they

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:48.940
make the connection that therefore ivermectin saves you from COVID.

01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:51.940
Now this stuff is happening on a large scale.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.940
What I'm trying to tell you, Steve, is I don't believe these anecdotes.

01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:59.940
I don't believe what clinicians say.

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:06.940
I know from reading the historical documents that entire medical establishments in England

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:13.940
and Wales can be fooled by newspaper propaganda and can start writing things on birth certificates

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.940
because they read about it in the paper.

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:17.940
So this is not new.

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.940
And so I do not believe this crap.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.940
I'm sorry.

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:28.940
I respect for medical people, but they have to start recognizing that it's easy for them

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.940
to fool themselves.

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.940
Okay.

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:41.940
Let's just leave it here because suffice it to say I totally disagree with your assessment.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:45.940
Suffice it to say that he totally disagrees with his assessment.

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:49.940
I'm not sure that there was a novel virus that killed millions that millions more were

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:55.940
saved from and that likely came from gain of function that somebody created it and that

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:56.940
it could come again.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.940
He believes it.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:02.940
He totally disagrees with the idea even though there's no evidence for spread.

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:13.940
Even though there's no evidence for spread.

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.940
But that's fine.

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:20.940
You know, we can have the and I think that's good that we can have these disagreements

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:26.940
and it will get to one of my points later on in the interview here where we want to talk

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.940
about how do we determine truth here?

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.940
Like this is a perfect example here.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:37.940
Look, I know lots of people and heard lots of stories from completely independent people

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:45.940
who are like blown away by these SPO2 measurements and that these people who are experiencing

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.940
this and they've never seen it before.

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.940
Are these individuals, have they been hyphenating for the last hour?

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.940
No.

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:53.940
No.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.940
No.

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.940
No, no, no.

01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.940
No, but I don't want to belabor this point.

01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.940
Yeah.

01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.940
But I just, I don't want to drop it saying.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.940
No, no, no.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.940
We have a disagreement.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:06.940
Yeah, I got it.

01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:07.940
I got it.

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.940
I understand it.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.940
I'm, you know, I think about it, but I think in this particular case, you're incorrect.

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.940
And, but, but we should, you know, explore this further.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:16.940
I'd love to have enough.

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.940
I mean, I think you're incorrect.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.940
I think we actually did land on the moon, but we're going to leave it here now.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.940
And we're just going to agree to disagree.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.940
It's a little more important than whether we landed on the moon or not.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:40.940
This is really about fundamental ways that we have been governed over the last three years, the last four years, the last 10 years, the last 20 years.

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:55.940
And if we are at the stage now, we are, we are going to reevaluate our foundational understanding of disease with respect to transmissible RNA pathogens, then it's a little more important than I think you're wrong.

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.940
And we're going to agree to disagree.

01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:09.940
The whole reason why three billion shots of transfection were rolled out around the world is because he thinks there was a novel pathogen still.

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:28.940
The only reason why any college kid is ever going to be forced to take this shot to go back to campus is because he still believes, or at least says that he still believes that there's a shot needed because there is a freaking novel pathogen around.

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:36.940
That's been sequenced, as he said, so, so checkmate ish.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:42.940
I'm going to take this position, but I also really believe it that there's a novel pathogen that has been sequenced.

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:47.940
According to Kevin McCurnan, millions of times.

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:53.940
Millions of times.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:36:03.940
Opportunity to convince you that this is that your explanation doesn't fit the facts, which is the important thing, right? Because, you know, does it does it correlate?

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:07.940
Like I was under a lot of stress during COVID, tremendous amount of stress.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.940
I mean, I wasn't getting sleep.

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:10.940
I got an oral ring.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.940
It was telling me, Steve, you're under a lot of stress here.

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.940
And I'd be measuring my SPO to my SPO to never drop from 99% during the whole period.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:19.940
I'm under stress.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.940
I'm isolated.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940
Like nobody wants to talk to me.

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.940
So then why not an aerosolized toxin?

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:33.940
Why not an aerosolized transfection that expresses a toxic protein in your lungs for a certain period of time?

01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:45.940
Why not an alternative explanation besides a risk additive self-replicating pathogen?

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.940
It's one or the other.

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:51.940
It's either there's nothing or there's this magical RNA.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:37:07.940
It's coated in some kind of magical lipoprotein coat that makes it be able to copy itself millions and millions of times in every person and then spread around like kind of like wildfire, but not really, because there's no evidence of spread.

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:10.940
Yeah.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:17.940
What a confusing, unbelievably confusing podcast this was.

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:18.940
Wow.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.940
Formation spreader.

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:25.940
I mean, the whole thing on this perfect under stress, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.940
SPO due to it too, didn't drop at all.

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.940
Okay.

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.940
But that that's just that that's not a here and a there.

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:33.940
Let me know.

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:34.940
I know.

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.940
I know.

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.940
Look, I know it's an individual thing, but you're brought it up.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.940
The person reacts to stress differently.

01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:49.940
An individual's ability to quantify and recognize their own internal physiological stress is near zero.

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:50.940
Okay.

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.940
So, yeah, let's move on.

01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.940
Let's move on.

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:55.940
We can say this for another day.

01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.940
You know, I want to be respectful of your time here.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940
I want to talk to you about this JAMA paper.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940
I read this paper in JAMA.

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.940
It's a research letter.

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:05.940
It was in 2023.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.940
I wrote a sub stack on it.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.940
This is a JAMA VA study.

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.940
And to me, this was like, this was, this is like the perfect study.

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:17.940
So this epidemiologist at the VA, he's got a really high H index.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:25.940
He had access to all the VA data and he's doing this study on COVID versus flow.

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.940
Are you familiar with this?

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.940
No, I don't know which paper you're talking about.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940
Okay.

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.940
Okay.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:32.940
But let me, let me describe it because it's really interesting.

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:37.940
He basically said, we're going to take two groups of people that people who are hospitalized

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:43.940
for COVID and we're going to take another group of people who are hospitalized for the

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.940
flu.

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:49.940
And we're going to look at the percentage of those people who are hospitalized who die.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:50.940
Okay.

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.940
And he has this baseline group.

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.940
He says, we're going to enroll anyone who goes in the hospital for the flu.

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.940
And we're going to enroll anyone who goes in the hospital for COVID.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.940
And if you have both, we're not going to enroll you because you're going to be confounded.

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:05.940
But yeah, we'll enroll everybody for one.

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.940
And what's the conclusion?

01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.940
Well, so here's the interesting thing.

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:15.940
He looks at the baseline characteristics of the people, including their vaccination status

01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:17.940
for COVID and the flu.

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.940
Guess what?

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:24.940
Both groups had identical vaccination status percentages.

01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:25.940
Okay.

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.940
What is, what does that tell you?

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:29.940
Yeah.

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:35.940
It doesn't tell me much because I, I, I make a point of trying to avoid those kinds of studies.

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.940
I do not believe that COVID tests are reliable whatsoever.

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.940
No, no, no, not COVID test.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:43.940
Well, okay.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.940
I guess because they're hot, hot, hot, hospitalized for COVID.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:47.940
Okay.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.940
Yeah.

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.940
So hospitalized for, to me, that's me.

01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:52.940
I mean, depending on the.

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:53.940
All right.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:40:00.940
You can imagine that it would show a positive result if one aspect of the physiology is reacting

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:05.940
differently or strong, more strongly than, than in another, you know, all kinds of things can be happening.

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:06.940
But do you believe?

01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.940
Okay.

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:08.940
Do you believe the flu test?

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.940
Do you believe that I'm not, I'm not convinced that viruses exist?

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:11.940
Okay.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:12.940
All right.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:13.940
We got it.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.940
We got to move on then.

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:15.940
So.

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.940
I'm not saying that viruses don't exist.

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.940
I'm saying that I'm seriously as a scientist trying to look.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:22.940
Okay.

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:23.940
Okay.

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.940
All right.

01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:25.940
You did.

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:26.940
You did.

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.940
I got to have this discussion with somebody else.

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.940
Let me, let me, let me, let me.

01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:32.940
You did just say that, but you're not sure viruses exist.

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940
And not to be.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.940
I'm not saying that viruses don't exist.

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.940
I'm saying that I'm seriously as a scientist trying to look.

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:40.940
Okay.

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:41.940
Okay.

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.940
All right.

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:43.940
All right.

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:44.940
All right.

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:45.940
All right.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.940
All right.

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:47.940
All right.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:48.940
All right.

01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:49.940
All right.

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940
All right.

01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940
Let me, let me, let me.

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.940
You did just say that, but you're not sure viruses exist.

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:56.940
Not to be a creep, but he did just say that the flu test.

01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:59.940
Do you believe that the hospital could go with the.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:00.940
I'm not.

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.940
I'm not convinced that viruses exist.

01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:03.940
Okay.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.940
All right.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:05.940
We got it.

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:06.940
We got to move on then.

01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:07.940
So.

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:09.940
Okay.

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.940
Okay.

01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940
All right.

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.940
I got to have this discussion with somebody else.

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:14.940
Let me.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.940
Yeah.

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:16.940
Let me, let me, let me.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:20.940
Since Livio is showing up, that means I'm not a time here, but let me, let me ask you this.

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.940
It's really important question.

01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:25.940
How do we resolve.

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:27.940
Questions in science.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.940
And let me give you a perfect example.

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.940
That's really, really important, which is autism.

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:38.940
And I've done independent surveys that are very impressive.

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:42.940
That show vaccines are correlated with autism.

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:46.940
The more vaccines the kid gets, the more likely they are to get autism.

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:52.940
I surveyed the parents to ask them what their experience was.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:56.940
The parents couldn't collaborate on the, on the results.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.940
And there was a perfect straight line.

01:41:58.940 --> 01:41:59.940
It was a linear correlation.

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.940
There are a lot of scientific articles about that relationship.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:05.940
Right.

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:06.940
Right.

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:07.940
Right.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.940
But we don't have to get into the, into the relationship.

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:13.940
But when I looked at that, I said, there's no possible way that vaccines could not be causing

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:14.940
autism.

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.940
And, and I look at that and I say, this is like, it's just not going to happen.

01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.940
If there's like, it's statistically impossible.

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.940
I had 10,000 people in this survey.

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:26.940
And then I heard have other statistics as well.

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:31.940
But it'd be, let's not get into the specifics of this.

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:37.940
My question is, how do we resolve these questions in the scientific community?

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.940
Because there are a thousand papers that say vaccines don't cause autism.

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.940
And there are a thousand papers that say they do.

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.940
And the doctors are all saying, well, we, we.

01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:52.940
It would be very simple for him to promote this book because he's had Dr.

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:57.940
Brian Hooker on his show before.

01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.940
He knows all about children's health defense.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.940
He knows the children's health defense is made up of people that have been trying to

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:10.940
point out that autism and vaccines are intimately linked.

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.940
He knows that Dell Bigtree does that.

01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.940
He knows that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.940
did that with C.H.D.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.940
knows that C.H.D.

01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:21.940
is still doing it because he just had Brian on not too long ago.

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:26.940
Brian even took the time to record some kind of thing for Steve's roast that

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:34.940
that Steve barely even played or or or paid any respectable thank you for.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:39.940
And so now he's talking like he's the one who's figured out that that vaccines

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:40.940
cause autism.

01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:44.940
What about all the moms that actually have autistic children?

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:50.940
What about all the dads like Brian Hooker who's got an autistic child who's is an adult now?

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:57.940
How about how little humility here and hand the ball off to the people who've been carrying it?

01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:05.940
Notice that I'm not saying it's me cause it ain't me.

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:13.940
There's plenty of people out there that deserve credit for and promotion of these ideas.

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.940
It ain't Steve Kirsch.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.940
Can we have a little humility here?

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:25.940
Brian Hooker is the only guy who drove across the United States on his own and his own car

01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.940
to meet with somebody from the CDC to get the data that was necessary to show that

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:35.940
African American kids were being damaged and that the CDC had hid the data.

01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:39.940
He's the one who did that, not Steve Kirsch.

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:44.940
Not even Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did that.

01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.940
Although he can swing from metal hooks and do push-ups with his shirt off.

01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:52.940
He's not the one who did that.

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.940
Brian Hooker is.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:10.940
Unbelievable how little humility this whole community has for the idea that we were all taken.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:18.940
And any of us that were taken in 2020 by any part of this narrative.

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:25.940
I don't care if you thought it was the right thing to do to raise money for early treatment.

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.940
You were running around for something that didn't need running around for and you should have been fighting

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:36.940
for the people that were getting murdered in hospitals for two years.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:41.940
We all should have been fighting more for the people who were being murdered in hospitals.

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.940
Getting so tired of this.

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.940
But I ain't gonna quit.

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:59.940
This is who I am. This is what my family is.

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:04.940
We were kicked out of a moving truck twice now in this pandemic.

01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:09.940
We're not going to give up and neither are you argue these things.

01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.940
We don't argue these in debates.

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:12.940
It's not.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:13.940
Debates.

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:14.940
Decide this.

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.940
It is in the scientific literature.

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:22.940
The scientific literature is half of it is fake and half of it is real.

01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.940
And the scientists can't tell the difference.

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:30.940
So how do we resolve scientific questions like do vaccines cause autism?

01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.940
Is the COVID vaccine safe?

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.940
You know, does a virus exist?

01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.940
How do we how do we how do we how do we get to resolution of these because like.

01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:45.940
I think the way we get to the resolution of some of these things is that we say them the way that they need to be said.

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.940
So what I would do is something like this.

01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:56.940
I might say intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:05.940
I might say something like transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and I might ask them or dare them to challenge me to support these statements.

01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.940
That's what I might do.

01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.940
Maybe you could just say something like that, Steve.

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:23.940
Say something courageous like maybe that the entire vaccine schedule of America when you compare it to any other western nation has to be considered criminal.

01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:32.940
There's no other explanation for the number of shots and how early they are applied to our children other than criminality.

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:44.940
Why not just say something courageous like that instead of saying how do we resolve these crazy questions in the literature when half the literature is a lie.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.940
You just start with the truth then that's how you do it.

01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.940
You start with the truth.

01:47:49.940 --> 01:48:08.940
The vaccine schedule is criminal intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the irreducible complex system of the immune response is a dumb idea.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940
The autism question has been out for 20 years.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:11.940
Right.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.940
The autism question was answered a long time ago.

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:16.940
You know, that's the thing.

01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:17.940
It's been answered.

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:27.940
The question of safety of the COVID vaccine is already established firmly in the scientific literature.

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:35.940
There are more autopsies than you can shake a stick at and they've been done down to looking at the pathology of the cells themselves using.

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.940
Well, you're saying you're saying the COVID vaccines are killing people.

01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.940
I'm saying that there are maybe.

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.940
I don't know how many autopsies have been done in great detail.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:47.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.940
And so on.

01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:49.940
Yeah.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.940
And they demonstrate using.

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:52.940
A link.

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:53.940
A causal link.

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:54.940
Of a pathologist.

01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:55.940
Right.

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.940
The cause of death is that they were injected.

01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.940
Period.

01:48:58.940 --> 01:48:59.940
Right.

01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.940
Right.

01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:01.940
That's not my question.

01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:03.940
Right.

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:04.940
But that's not my question.

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:09.940
The problem is that the science, there are people in the scientific community who say, Oh, that's bullshit.

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:11.940
That was a bad study.

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:17.940
You know, like the Cleveland Clinic study, they'll say, they'll say, Oh, that was a bad study.

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.940
Oh, the vaccines are safe.

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940
You should get the shot.

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:25.940
How do we, how do we resolve this in the public's mind?

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:30.940
How do we come to a resolution of what is true and what is false?

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:31.940
Are the quote?

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:34.940
Like, I don't want any scientific questions.

01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:39.940
We're not in the business of determining what the public mind should think.

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:43.940
No, but that's, but that's.

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.940
People have to.

01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:45.940
Yes.

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.940
Yeah.

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:47.940
But there's no.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.940
How can we, how can we assist.

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.940
The public to determine the truth of scientific.

01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.940
Questions.

01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:00.940
I'm trying to assist the public by doing the best science that I can.

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:01.940
I know how you do it.

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:03.940
And as simply as I can.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:04.940
You know how you do it.

01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:05.940
You teach people.

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:11.940
You teach people the biology and then you let them learn for themselves.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.940
Actually, that's the best way to do it.

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:17.940
You, you throw down a rope ladder.

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.940
And you help people up into the tree.

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:27.940
Then you put a, a waist belt around them and clip them to the safety line.

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:33.940
And you teach them some basic rules like, you know, always one hand and one foot for the tree.

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:39.940
And then you start climbing.

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.940
This is not.

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:46.940
This is not how science is supposed to be.

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.940
This is not what science is supposed to do for us.

01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.940
Science is not supposed to be.

01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:58.940
A closed off library of knowledge that only certain people with keys.

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:02.940
And, and, and the.

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.940
The codex can learn.

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:15.940
If science and biology are going to give us what they should give us as a species, we should come to understand ourselves better.

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.940
Through science.

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:21.940
We should come to understand our what makes us sacred.

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.940
Better through science.

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.940
And that's what science used to do for me.

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.940
That's what science always did for me.

01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:32.940
Is that it made me appreciate the complexity.

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.940
Of what I was looking at under the microscope.

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:40.940
I could so easily imagine like, wow, what am I looking at here?

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.940
I'm looking at this tiny little sliver.

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.940
Of what makes a mouse, what a mouse is.

01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:54.940
And my goodness, what goes on inside the head of my son.

01:51:54.940 --> 01:52:01.940
And there were times when I would just, I would be overwhelmed.

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:09.940
Sitting in front of my microscope with a black and white image of a, of neurons from a mouse.

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:15.940
And I would just be overwhelmed with this sense of awe.

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:22.940
That I was even allowed to look at this image, never mind makeup.

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:33.940
Scientific investigations to try and understand what's going on there and, and, and pretend like I was really making progress contributing to some understanding of what was going on inside of this.

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:38.940
And possibly complex thing.

01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:43.940
But I loved that job. I really did because it did make me feel that every day.

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:51.940
This reverence for, for, for a little mouse.

01:52:51.940 --> 01:53:07.940
And if you can have a reverence for a little mouse, then every time you see your son come in the house, throw his backpack on the floor, you think tears can come running down your eyes.

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:24.940
And none of these people are, none of these people are there anymore with their understanding of what our children are as perfect. They're, they're not there anymore understanding what our babies are as perfect.

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:30.940
These people, they don't, they don't see it.

01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:36.940
And I don't know why, but I do know that it is our sacred duty.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:41.940
We are brought here for one reason and one reason only and that we are the gardeners of this.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:46.940
We are the tenders of this garden.

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:56.940
And the really weird thing about it is is the most important piece of the garden is ourselves is our, our humanity.

01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:08.940
Just like an elephant is one of the gardeners of their jungle. We were supposed to be gardeners of our, of our, our world.

01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:16.940
I mean, have you ever imagined what it would really be if, if, if we did it the way we should be doing it?

01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:37.940
Imagine if my great grandfather on the plot of land that they had in Cadet, Wisconsin would have planted the right arrangement of oak trees and then carefully trained them over his lifetime so that they twisted together in the right way to make the perfect house.

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:43.940
Not a very big house, but a log cabin made out of living oak trees.

01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:52.940
It's not impossible. It's a project that would take you 20 or 30 years, 40 years, 50 years.

01:54:52.940 --> 01:55:06.940
But it's not that different than the beautiful trees that you see in Japan where they cut them just the right way so that they grow these perfect cedar pieces of wood so that they can make their perfect houses and they actually just grow these trees

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:14.940
and they, they prune them and they get new wood all the time. And so this, that's where we should be.

01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:28.940
At one with nature, trying to find ways to maximize mother nature's productivity and our ability to dwell within it.

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:37.940
And so we are very, very far off course. There's really no question about it. But what's most important to see is that none of these people are offering us a way out.

01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:52.940
None of these people are offering us a viable way forward. None of these people have a vision of the sacred biology that can is capable of leading us forward.

01:55:52.940 --> 01:56:06.940
Because they see our unhealthy, poisoned, malnourished, screen ridden children as being little urchins.

01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:11.940
They see their children as the future, not ours.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.940
Man, oh man, I'm fired up. I love it, Denny.

01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:18.940
And you do a great job of that.

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:30.940
We're trying to help medical people, other scientists, communicators and the general public to do a great job with how we do it. Okay.

01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:46.940
You're doing an awesome job, Denny. But the problem is that these fact checkers will say that, oh, it's not published in the peer reviewed literature.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:57.940
He didn't consider this. Tracy Beth Hoegg will say, oh, gee, if this paper was true, they're going to be throwing all this bullshit at you.

01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.940
He wants to talk.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:12.940
Let me put your question, though. What you're basically asking me is, what can we do about the fact that the people who have power determine truth and what the narrative is?

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.940
Exactly.

01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:15.940
Exactly.

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:16.940
Yeah.

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:25.940
And the answer is the same answer that has been around historically since the beginning of time.

01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.940
Human societies.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:34.940
Why is Steve excited? Steve excited because he's not talking about the fact that there's no virus anymore. They've gotten him off that topic.

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.940
So now Steve can smile again. It's very funny.

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:40.940
They are always organized as dominance hierarchies.

01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:50.940
And they can be more democratic where different social groups and social classes have more influence and play a role in determining where the nation as a whole is going to go.

01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:57.940
Or they can be very totalitarian where there's no such thing and everybody that's not part of that elite circle is a surf and that's all there is to it.

01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:08.940
And so you can have these different structures and the answer is every person and every group and every social class and every professional class.

01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:17.940
And if they feel that they prefer society that's more close to the democratic end, then they have to do everything they can to fight to move things in that direction.

01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:32.940
And so you have to eat each person has to decide what what am I going to do and most people have to combine that decision with what am I going to do to survive and what am I going to do to make sure that my kids are okay and that I'm okay and so on.

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:38.940
So that the end often you can combine the two in a very effective way.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.940
So that's what people are doing as much as they can.

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:51.940
But overall, the biggest determinant of this societal structure are the big wheels that really control things.

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:55.940
And I have written about this and talked about it often.

01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:57.940
It's all about geopolitics.

01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:12.940
The geopolitics is what is is what turns the world geopolitics is the reality that will affect your life in the U.S. in Canada more than anything else for on the on the time scale of decades.

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:13.940
Okay.

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:17.940
There was freedom after the Second World War because of geopolitics.

01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:24.940
There was changes in society in the 60s and 70s because of geopolitics.

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:35.940
There was a closure and a removal and a back racking against democratic influence in the 80s and 90s because of geopolitics.

01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:53.940
There was a sudden increase in predatory globalization at the early 90s because of geopolitics and U.S. corporations were given a free hand to take all the European corporations, Japanese and so on because the Soviet Union had just dissolved.

01:59:53.940 --> 02:00:03.940
And so I've written a very large paper about geopolitics and how it impacts our lives and how it even determines what the ideology in the West is going to be.

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:07.940
Wokeism and all of that. The origin of it is geopolitical.

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:12.940
And one can study that. I wrote a big paper in 2019 about this.

02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:24.940
That's been Steve does not like this discussion at all because his handlers don't like this discussion at all that it's about geopolitics that it's about land grabs.

02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:28.940
It's about resources. It's about controlling waterways.

02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:32.940
It's about controlling food.

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:36.940
It's about controlling supply chains.

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.940
And so we're supposed to pay attention to like, you know, the slaughter of people in Gaza.

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:49.940
We're supposed to pay attention to the latest variant. We're supposed to pay attention to the latest connections to Epstein.

02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:57.940
We're not supposed to be paying attention to the geopolitical consequences of all the nonsense that's going on right now.

02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:05.940
We're not supposed to pay attention to what's being changed in our food supply was being destroyed in our supply chain.

02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:10.940
How rules and regulations are being changed on with regard to international trade.

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:16.940
These are not things we're supposed to pay attention to. We're supposed to be worried about the who trade the who committee.

02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:21.940
The who treaty. That's what we should worry about.

02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:27.940
I think I'm going to end it here. I'll watch this later and see if there's anything else that I miss at the end.

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:31.940
If you've seen the end of this one already, maybe you can recommend it as well.

02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:38.940
Otherwise, I think we've gotten the meat out of that one. And I think Denny did an absolutely fantastic job.

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:45.940
Had making sure that the main message got out, which there is no evidence of spread.

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:52.940
In fact, what did he say? No evidence of spread. June 2nd. It was really mass homicide.

02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:58.940
Excess mortality happens not only with transfection, but also with the rollout of particular protocols.

02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:07.940
There was nothing to be saved from. So how could there be a benefit from the transfection?

02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:20.940
Excuse me. I did notice that they did not use the word transfection, although they did talk very much about there not being a virus to the great uncomfortableness of Steve, which made me very happy.

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:27.940
How to see the medlers. They don't talk about childhood vaccinations, or if they do, they talk about it like a non.

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:35.940
Just like a thing that can't be solved as Steve talked about it tonight. I'm not really sure how we ever are going to answer these questions.

02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:43.940
There was Steve's conclusion. Let's not talk about strict liability for all pharmaceutical products. That would be a pretty easy way to solve that problem too.

02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:52.940
Let's not talk about the use of protocols to create mass casualty events as a meaningful data point, even though they kind of did.

02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:59.940
Steve has never really talked about it before and doesn't do it regularly. Didn't use the word transfection. Didn't use the word clones.

02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:09.940
Attacked people versus ideas? Hmm, I don't know. And unable to summarize across the entire show, that's almost certainly what happened here.

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:17.940
Because even though we said there was no evidence of spread, they couldn't summarize to the point whether that means we didn't need to transfect anybody.

02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:21.940
And I wish people would make that point more often.

02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:27.940
I also wish people would bring up the point of where the excess deaths in America are coming from.

02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:34.940
And I don't always get to it myself, but I noticed that they never talk about any other possible causes of excess deaths.

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:42.940
Like anything to do with the lockdowns, anything to do with opioids, anything to do with suicides, anything to do with depression.

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:50.940
They mention these things, but they don't mention the fact that they could contribute to all cause mortality rise.

02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:55.940
They could then be blamed on COVID. So tomorrow, I'm going to try and do a show at noon.

02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:59.940
I don't know how well this is going to work for you guys who like to be here late night.

02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:13.940
But for my family, it's going to be better if I'm doing a noon show with my slide deck and my late shows as either a question and answer or a study hall with no slides like I did tonight.

02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:21.940
So I have a slide deck prepared for tomorrow that I'm going to put on in the afternoon sometime between 12 and two so that I'm done before the boys get home.

02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:30.940
And then after the kids are in bed, if all goes well on any particular night, I'm going to plan to do study halls in the evening.

02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:40.940
This doesn't mean that there's going to be a show every day at noon, but I'm going to target doing a show every day at noon as opposed to doing a show every day at nine.

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:50.940
And so if that means that I'm going to push a study hall to noon and not do it at night, that's more likely to happen than the other way around going forward.

02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:56.940
I think this is going to be better because this is also going to allow me to make videos for my wife's yoga channel.

02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:09.940
And it's also going to allow me to put my videos up on sub stack on the same day that I have streamed them, which right now I'm falling behind very quickly because of the way this works.

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:14.940
And so I need to get a schedule where my day is broken up in the right way.

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:22.940
And right now what ends up happening is that I'm working on my stream until the very end and then I decide at the last minute whether I'm going to go on.

02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:32.940
And then as usual, I'm up here until 1130 and I'm so excited to have spent this time with you that when I turn the stream off, it's not like I can just go hit the pillow and pass out.

02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:42.940
And so instead I have to watch or study or I have to read something and so then it ends up be one o'clock before I go to bed and then I'm not up early and then this whole cycle repeats.

02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:47.940
So we're going to try and break that cycle by doing a 11 o'clock noon.

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:55.940
I'm just going to go with my feeling for these first days until something starts to feel like the right time and then we're going to start to schedule it.

02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:57.940
So you're going to have to bear with me.

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:07.940
This is a work in progress. Like I said, my wife has been brought on to the operation and so there's going to be more ways to communicate.

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:18.940
You're going to be more up to date when we start to do the the PDFs and we're going to come up with a few more ways to support that don't have to do with PDFs and send all and that kind of thing.

02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:25.940
But I do think my PDFs are going to be something that you're going to want to download and they're going to be free anyway so you can.

02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:32.940
But the point is I think it'll make subscribing seem a little bit more like something that's worthwhile.

02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:33.940
So anyway.

02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:41.940
Wow, I wasn't planning on saying anything and then I said that we are going to discuss this.

02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:46.940
This this idea tomorrow.

02:06:46.940 --> 02:07:05.940
I've got a really interesting one of my favorite YouTube channels that has nothing to do with COVID actually has all to do with motorcycles that he's a Canada guy did this video about self driving cars that I think I can use to teach some biology, which is just crazy

02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:12.940
but I teach some biology specifically about about how do I do that like this, this nonsense right here.

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:19.940
So I put this stream or this slide up every night but I have never really taken the time to explain it.

02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:31.940
So we'll talk about Neuralink and we'll talk about Elon Musk and the whole AI thing and we'll talk about self driving cars, motorcycles and biology I guess.

02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:41.940
So it's kind of like we're revisiting the motorcycles and and compound pose video from JC on a bike or JC in the woods all that long time ago.

02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:47.940
So anyway, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group.

02:07:47.940 --> 02:08:00.940
Don't forget that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting your beautiful immune system is dumb and you know where to find me and I will be here again tomorrow.

02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:14.940
Remember it'll be in the afternoon tomorrow, maybe for lunch or early afternoon possibly even 11 Eastern but I think that's too early for you West Coasters and then we'll we'll see how we do the evening shows.

02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:28.940
You can find me at giggleonbiological.com the archive there is a little bit more up to date and you can find a one time donation there and if you scroll down you can find a way to also do the subscribing thing.

02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:47.940
So thank you very much for joining me it's been really fun and I will see you again tomorrow thank you.

02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:59.940
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:14.940
Hey that looks better that's better I like that so the guys in gold are not subscribers necessarily but they just made a donation and so I'll update the gold list separately from the active subscribing supporters.

02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:21.940
Again your name is bigger it's because you either you know I've donated in other ways to or you know who you are.

02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:35.940
Anyway thank you very much these are the people that make this possible I do have to say that I need I need a lot more support than this if we're going to keep this up over the next years to come and I do think it's important enough to try and do that.

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:44.940
So if you can help me by sharing this stream with as many people as you can that would be really really great not driving into important stuff is hard.

02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:54.940
That's what we're going to talk about tomorrow I'm so excited see you later.
