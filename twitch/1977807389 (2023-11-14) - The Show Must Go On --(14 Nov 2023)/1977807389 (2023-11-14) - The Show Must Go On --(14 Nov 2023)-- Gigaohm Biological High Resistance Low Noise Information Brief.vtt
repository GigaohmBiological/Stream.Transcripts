WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
Testing one, two, test one, two.

01:55.000 --> 02:24.000
You schedule for 60 minutes next is going on French.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's embarrassing.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Don't stand by the wind.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Stand by the wind.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
That's one best story no one will believe.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, good evening. Thanks for joining us, Vin Dicty.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
I'm glad you found me through Mark. That's about the best way you can find me.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
That really makes me very happy.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
So here we are, Gigo and biological Ohio resistance.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Low noise information brought to you by a biologist.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
It is the 14th of November, 2023.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
We are still basically working through the same noise and I'm going to be singing the same songs tonight.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
Because we're still just kind of running on this gift here, you know.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
It feels like we're just barely getting out of the cave as it collapses.

05:07.000 --> 05:17.000
But somehow we're not making as much progress as I should because I think we're still trapped in this limited spectrum of debate.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So we've got to do something about that.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Sorry I had a little music problem there for a second.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I wasn't really sure what I was going to do, but of course I'm going to put on my favorite tune.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
We need to learn our history.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
That's what Mark has been helping us out with a lot.

05:46.000 --> 06:01.000
It's always great to have somebody digging in the background as you try to sort out the cutting edge biology yourself and have no time at all to look back at the history of these charlatans.

06:01.000 --> 06:11.000
But actually so much of what I've learned about the biology, about the immunomythology that these guys are pushing.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
I have learned by following the links in their history.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And a lot of those links are provided by my friend Mark Gulak of his atomic life.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And so shout out to him.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I think he's in the chat right now.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
See Albert in the chat and Christy.

06:30.000 --> 06:40.000
A lot of people that I'm really happy are coming here every night to help study the brick wall that's visible.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I guess that's what we're really doing.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
We're studying the brick wall and we're trying to make sure that people can see it easier.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
We're trying to describe the brick wall in simpler terms.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
You know, like Jessica Hawkins idea of explaining it by saying there was no spread in New York City.

07:02.000 --> 07:11.000
Denny Rankor is also very, very astutely used math to say that there was no spread of a dangerous virus.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Infectious clones are the only real threat in explaining the role of infectious clones.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
We're going to work on that during this holiday season.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
The role of placebo batches, I think, you know, I give credit where credits do.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
You know, this is something that mathematically speaking Matthew Crawford put forward very early and how this would be useful.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Hum-transfection and healthy mammals is dumb.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I think that's a pretty simple way of putting things too.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Protocols were murdered, gained a function as a mythology.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
The Scooby-Doo, the mystery that you've been led to solve, is also real.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And the players are committed to the lies that form that Scooby-Doo.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I think that's really important to understand.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
It's really this faith in a novel virus, this faith that millions died, but millions more were saved.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And the gain of functions is actually real.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
It's so real that people lie about it and a virus will come again.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
So that's what Gigo and Biological is all about right now.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
We're going to keep singing this song day after day, night after night.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It's a late streak tonight.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Basketball practice went a little late.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It kind of goes like this.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
Sometimes there's this like really vigilant janitor that's standing at the door at 859 with a mop and keys.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
And saying coach, coach, let's go.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
And then sometimes you're at this gym and it seems like nobody cares that you're there.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And the kids want to play and they start scrimmaging.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
And before you know you're talking to a parent and now I'm starting at 10-21.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
So you're going to have to forgive me for that.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
But like lots of people have noticed at least the streak is alive.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Give me a chance to get up to speed and get back into shape.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
I ran my first set of horses tonight in many, many years in my lifetime.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
Trying to run some of the calisthenics and exercises that the boys do, but not all of them.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Let's get to work.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm very excited because, whoa, that was DJ, Jazzy J, not so Jazzy.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah, so it's not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
And I've been telling this story relative to the intellectual dark web and some pieces on the board have moved today.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
And I want to just take some snapshots and take a look at them and discuss what they mean to me.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Given my experience during the last three years.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
And then basically just do a rocket summary introduction and closure around that.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
Because yesterday was a really long stream and I'm starting late tonight.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
It'd be nice if I could be done in an hour. I don't think it's really possible.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.000
But we've been trying to work on this language, this language that doesn't really seem like a lot of people want to adopt or even really consider touching.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
I don't think it's because of the toxicity of what these words mean.

10:20.000 --> 10:29.000
I think it's more about how many people are participating in the controlling of the narrative and how many of those people have a.

10:30.000 --> 10:39.000
Invested interest or a an obligation not to really amplify my work and the work of others like Mark Koolak.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
And transfection and healthy humans is actually criminally negligent.

10:50.000 --> 10:59.000
The people that were involved in the classification of these transfections as investigational vaccines.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
So that they could be rolled out as countermeasures during the pandemic.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
Are guilty of something and I don't know if it's up to me to really determine what they're guilty of because I'm not a lawyer.

11:12.000 --> 11:21.000
But the bottom line is that there's no biological excuse for assuming that transfection would be a useful way of augmenting the immune system.

11:21.000 --> 11:29.000
And I think that's the basis from which all of these investigations into criminal, whatever's should be done.

11:30.000 --> 11:40.000
It is my the gremlins that whisper in my ear suggest to me that unless the lawyers that are here are.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
Stating the statute that is being violated, it's hard to take some of these people seriously.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
So with grains of salt, watch the bait on, you know, watch the bait on social media, but do not take it.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
There's a lot of pomp and circumstance and a lot of bluster right now.

12:00.000 --> 12:12.000
And all of that bluster and all of those people standing on stage and all of those people talking, they don't seem to be able to get the messaging down to a few things other than informed consent.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
But then, you know, informed consent requires understanding.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
So if you're going to start with informed consent, at some point you're going to have to say something about this biology that's on the screen here.

12:24.000 --> 12:33.000
I recently, you know, yesterday decided that, you know, to try out some other combinations of words. And so let's keep doing that.

12:33.000 --> 12:43.000
So that we can learn how to communicate crisply and precisely, maybe even before Thanksgiving and try it out on some of our family and friends over that holiday.

12:44.000 --> 12:54.000
Again, I wanted to say that this stream in particular, I want to focus a little bit on the intellectual dark web and the idea of how we've been governed over the last three years.

12:54.000 --> 13:21.000
It is very tempting to believe that it is this, you know, push and pull between, I guess, the DOD, DARPA and NIH and NIAID and CDC and FDA and the rest of the executive branch and countries around the world and the who and GAVI and all these different organizations working together

13:21.000 --> 13:34.000
to respond to the pandemic are sort of kind of responsible for the decision making and for the interpretation of the narrative and the control of the narrative.

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
And so the dissidents that are fighting against those entities are necessarily good guys.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
But in reality, I'm going to try and stop doing that. I know that's really annoying.

13:48.000 --> 14:10.000
In reality, the, the dissident side of the narrative is also composed of people that are as participating as those people in Congress has participating as those people that work for DARPA as participating has those people that work for the CDC and the FDA ACIP community.

14:11.000 --> 14:27.000
All of these people are playing a role in making sure that this Scooby-Doo was adopted by everyone, that everyone on the left, everyone on the right was invested in trying to figure out what happened.

14:28.000 --> 14:37.000
And the premise that most people have been fooled into believing is that there was a novel virus.

14:38.000 --> 14:52.000
And the intellectual dark web was really crucial in seeding that narrative and particularly crucial in seeding the worst case scenario possibility space.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
What is the worst case scenario here that included a lab leak?

14:58.000 --> 15:22.000
And now the idea is that these people are pretending to be legitimate dissidents while actually if you look at the history of their record, if you listen to their podcasts from 2019 through 2020 and that transition into the pandemic, you don't hear dissidents.

15:23.000 --> 15:45.000
You hear submissive completely on narrative people. You hear people that are just starting their podcast on their eighth podcast on their fourth podcast talking about the relevance of, you know, following directives.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
And, you know, when there's a real emergency, and these are not by accident. This is by design.

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
And so now the question is, how can we see this? How can we see the reality of these people in real time?

16:01.000 --> 16:17.000
It has been very useful to go back into their record of 2019, 2020, 2021 and see that although we've been led to believe that these people are the leaders of the dissident movement, the only ones that spoke up.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
When we go back in time, actually, they are really far removed from 2020 when speaking up would have been useful.

16:25.000 --> 16:38.000
When Knut Wieckowski was speaking up, when Wolfgang Woda was speaking up, when Michael Yeden was speaking up, when, when really Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough were speaking up.

16:39.000 --> 17:02.000
And very cleverly, other people have been inserted in front of and ahead of these early dissidents and taken control of the narrative in such a way so that we were almost guaranteed not to write that, not to ask the right question early enough to avoid this disaster.

17:03.000 --> 17:18.000
Where the confusion and frustration and doubt has almost fractured our country irrevocably, irrevocably, irrevocably, I can't even speak, fractured our country.

17:19.000 --> 17:28.000
And so I really want to understand how it is that on all levels of the internet, there were medlers.

17:28.000 --> 17:45.000
On all levels of social media, there were medlers that were given different parts of the narrative to push, different pieces of evidence had different times were released to very questionable characters, very

17:46.000 --> 18:09.000
important. Books were sold, narratives were pushed, people were sued, and these were all orchestrated ways of getting us to imagine that we were paying attention to an ongoing struggle for the truth, when we were really paying attention to an ongoing theater of struggle.

18:10.000 --> 18:24.000
A controlled spectrum of debate, as Noam Chomsky so eloquently said, and within that controlled spectrum of debate, there's been a very vigorous argument between Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris.

18:25.000 --> 18:36.000
And that vigorous argument represents the state of the art of our society trying to figure out what happened with the pandemic and come to a real realization of what to do next.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
And quite a few people have fallen into the trap of believing that quite a few people in our government believe that.

18:45.000 --> 19:13.000
And that's the work that we're now trying to do to try and show people that it's impossible that a paper by and a group and the head of the vaccine chief of vaccine research for the cancer wing of the NIH are writing an editorial about from genome to vaccine.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
And that they say the silent part out loud.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
Following the events of September 11th, 2021 is in the text here.

19:29.000 --> 19:37.000
Bioterrorism and several years of sustained increases in government funding have had a stimulatory effect on vaccine development.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
AIDS has also driven vaccine research primarily because of a well-deserved infusion of funding in that field.

19:46.000 --> 20:10.000
This immunomythology has been laid piece by piece for decades with the idea of basically tricking us into thinking we solved a mystery about a virus so that we would our children would come to believe that pandemics are real fact of life.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
And that it's man's hubris sometimes, but it's also mother nature's cruelty sometimes.

20:20.000 --> 20:30.000
And these books have made it very obvious, at least to me, that I have been unaware of how we have been governed for so long.

20:31.000 --> 20:44.000
And in reality, the intellectual class, the bureaucrats in government, they've been governed by similar mythology, just not based in public health, not directly.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
And now it's been rolled on on a global scale.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
This theater has been used to bamboozle the globe.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
So I'm just discussed.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
Mark has been playing this video and I think it's really worth watching again.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
And the thing to get from this video is to understand the yellow text.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Vaccination is a methodology that will work on everything.

21:21.000 --> 21:39.000
And this pivot is a game that they are playing so that they can call basically anything that's genetic, any type of genetic therapy will essentially be called a vaccine.

21:40.000 --> 21:52.000
And that's exactly what they've done with regard to COVID and with regard to this SARS-CoV-2 virus that supposedly started trampling the earth in 2020.

21:55.000 --> 22:04.000
And we need to see this as the final push for that cognitive dissonance to be set in place for the next generation.

22:05.000 --> 22:27.000
And we need to break it because we can't let our children grow up thinking that we have transitioned to a time when using adenovirus or using a lipid nanoparticle to carry modified RNA into ourselves and augment our immune system is something that we do now.

22:28.000 --> 22:36.000
Even if the TV says it, even if social media says it, we can't let them grow up thinking that that's okay.

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
And we need to educate doctors one by one, nurses one by one, moms one by one, teachers one by one or 30 by 30.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
But we've got to find a way to do it.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
Because what this man says in this video is extremely on point.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
This is the plan.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
It is an enchantment.

23:02.000 --> 23:11.000
Vaccines cure diseases because the best cures that we have are vaccines.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
And every disease has a cure. You're not going to argue with that. Are you?

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
We have heard Tony Fauci say these exact words and I apologize, but because I got back from the basketball practice so late, I couldn't get this video.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
It would take me a little while. I know I know what it is and where the the interview is.

23:36.000 --> 23:50.000
It's a BBC interview where he's talking to a woman with short hair and Fauci says basically the same thing that our immune response to HIV is not as robust as it is for some other viruses.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Therefore, the vaccine has to be better than the infection at activating your immune system.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
So this logic and this concept is very tightly.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I mean, they say almost exactly the same words. I don't know how locked in time they are.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
This is 2014. I'm pretty sure that the video that was in 2011 with Fauci.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Over three years earlier, they were already using almost identical language.

24:20.000 --> 24:31.000
So let's just listen to him again. He's going to explain how previously we used live attenuated vaccines made from the viruses that we were trying to protect from.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
And antigenically speaking, these are also viruses, measles, polio that don't really antigenically evolve that rapidly.

24:40.000 --> 24:53.000
Unlike a lot of the other viruses that we tend to think of as circulating an endemic like coronaviruses, human papilloma viruses, etc.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
It's a long arduous road for us to teach this stuff, but we got to do it.

24:59.000 --> 25:08.000
We need to do now, and I agree wholeheartedly that this is important, that we need to have elevator pitch talking points about this stuff.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
And the idea that vaccination is a methodology that will work on everything is one that needs breaking.

25:17.000 --> 25:34.000
We cannot allow them to call these vaccines unless we are also going to very explicitly say that legally speaking everything that you inject with a needle should be held to strict liability.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Is that the right word? Strict liability? I'm always, I mean...

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Where is my message that I want to look up here?

25:57.000 --> 26:15.000
Yes, strict liability. So if you hold, you know, the reason why that you see pharma commercials on TV with all these warnings afterward is because these compounds are being held to strict liability.

26:16.000 --> 26:34.000
The example that was given to me earlier today was if the latter company doesn't warn you that you could fall or it's dangerous to climb the ladder or do it with a partner or don't supervise or whatever, potentially if you get hurt, they can be liable.

26:35.000 --> 26:54.000
And if the drug, you know, doesn't warn you that you hair loss or lack of sexual dysfunction is a side effect of this drug and then you use it and you have this happen, potentially that strict liability you could be sued for that.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Loss of hair, whatever.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
So vaccines are not held to this standard.

27:02.000 --> 27:12.000
And if we wanted to be legally pretty simple, this is how we would describe it that vaccination is a methodology that will work on everything is an enchantment.

27:13.000 --> 27:25.000
It's an idea that is actually, it's incongruent with biology, but their goal is to avoid the strict liability that is associated with all other pharmaceuticals.

27:26.000 --> 27:38.000
By trying to move genetic therapies into the vaccine space because the vaccine space is not held to strict liability.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
And so if we can be simple, that's about as simple as we can be.

27:43.000 --> 27:53.000
Any lawyer worth their salt should know what strict liability means and should be able to say that this is the goal that we want to hold vaccines to strict liability.

27:53.000 --> 28:01.000
It's better to say that quite honestly than it is to say we want random randomized controlled trials with placebo.

28:03.000 --> 28:12.000
Because still then you're saying that if they pass a randomized controlled trial with placebo, then it's okay for us to not hold them to strict liability.

28:13.000 --> 28:26.000
In theory, a vaccine bottle should be covered in red labels, right, in warnings and all kinds of stuff, but they're not because they're not held to strict liability.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
So that's what the bamboozlement is happening and it's already been happening.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
This is 2014.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
So we're talking at least 10 years ago and we know earlier than that people were trying to make this cognitive shift.

28:42.000 --> 28:59.000
Within the academic community that we could think of genetic therapies as vaccines because we're using them to treat diseases, which, you know, like cancer diseases have cures and one of our best cures is vaccines.

29:00.000 --> 29:12.000
And for academics, this is fine for, you know, funding and whatever and for prior health priorities and whatnot, but it is an actual move.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
It is a move to avoid strict liability.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That's what they're avoiding.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It's not.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
And it's to be precise.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
That's what that's what you have to say strict liability.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm sorry.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm being so.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Two about it.

29:32.000 --> 29:52.000
Well, I think, you know, the big problem in vaccines has been that while it's been possible in the past to make vaccines against viruses that cause acute self-limited infections, that's mostly been done

29:52.000 --> 30:10.000
by making either an attenuated or killed virus, which induces an immune response that mimics the immune response that you get to the natural infection because the natural infection will give you lifelong or at least long-lasting immunity.

30:11.000 --> 30:24.000
But now what's left are viruses that cause chronic infections or cancer that causes chronic disease where the disease itself does not induce an adequate response to get protection.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
So now the vaccine has to be better than the virus or the cancer itself.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
It's really word for word what Fauci said in that video.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm going to find chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis C, for example.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
And I think more and more strategies are being developed to target those very similar to the ones I just talked about for cancer vaccines.

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
And I think hopefully within the next five to 10 years, we will have vaccines for those diseases.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
I mean, you know, we're going to have a vaccine for laziness.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
We're going to have a vaccine for for ugliness.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
We're going to have a vaccine for unhappiness or depression.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That's what they want.

31:06.000 --> 31:15.000
This idea, they want this idea to start leaking out into the average person's consciousness, you know, and it's terrifying.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
Because it is really just what they laughed about yesterday on Twiv.

31:20.000 --> 31:28.000
Why don't we just, you know, change the definition of ecology, change the definition of ecosystem, change the definition of niche.

31:28.000 --> 31:42.000
Why don't we just change the definition and expand the definition of vaccine to cover also everything that that modifies genes.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
And this is where we are.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
This magic trick of imprecise language.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
And a bunch of yes men and yes women.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
Trying to climb the ladder of prestige and and perceived fame and honor and power.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
All the while barely even learning the biology they're doing because why do they need to learn it?

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
I mean, just need to learn how to do it.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
And don't ask any questions.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
You've just discussed.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
If you could take 10 players off the map.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Right. If you simply reran the pandemic, but.

32:32.000 --> 32:40.000
Robert alone, Peter McCullough, Joe Rogan.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
You know, if you took 10 players off the map, including you and me, the pandemic unfolds totally differently.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Right. The story never breaks.

32:49.000 --> 33:07.000
People probably at this point will have just simply accepted that the reason that we can now all go back to life is that these marvelous vaccines have saved the day they will accept the phony data that suggests that, you know, they've probably been kept out of the hospital by these things.

33:08.000 --> 33:20.000
And, you know, they would be inserted into the the childhood vaccine schedule and everybody would do to fully be getting their kids vaccinated with them despite the fact that that never made the slightest bit of sense.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
So again, if all you did was take out.

33:26.000 --> 33:38.000
The 10 people who most impacted the public discourse in a way that went against the mainstream narrative, then you wouldn't have to mess with everybody else.

33:38.000 --> 33:53.000
It doesn't matter that there would be people who were noticing things, people who had, you know, lost loved ones in the immediate aftermath of being vaccinated, they would be, you know, shouted down by an angry public that didn't want conspiracy theories being circulated.

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
Right. The calamari clots that the the morticians were finding would become just a rumor.

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
It's not hard to imagine that, you know, messing with 10 people would have been enough.

34:06.000 --> 34:20.000
And the problem then is the idea that it had even happened would be effectively invisible because anybody who said, Hey, you have no idea what happened to us why we were disappeared from the Internet at this moment.

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
I mean, all of the people you mentioned were messed with. We did get messed with. We just didn't get completely obliterated. Right. The fact is we.

34:31.000 --> 34:40.000
I think a very important point is happening here. I think what's becoming obvious to me is that Heather actually doesn't know.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
I'm just speculating for fun because it's late night and, you know, I'm tired.

34:45.000 --> 35:05.000
But I don't think she knows that her husband is in cahoots with his brother and Peter Teal and the rest of the intellectual dark web to control the narrative around the doubt side to make sure that the wrong questions are always asked.

35:06.000 --> 35:14.000
And that simple forthright biology is never really presented.

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
He's never taught immunology 101 not once on his stream, even though he said at the beginning of the pandemic that he would do it.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
He's never explained. He's never had graphics. He doesn't do papers.

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
They're both PhD's. They barely they barely do anything useful for three years.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
And in the first year of the pandemic, they did not doubt anything.

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
In the first year of the pandemic, they did not doubt anything.

35:48.000 --> 35:56.000
From masks to lockdowns to distancing, they doubted nothing.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
And in fact, they believed very much in the usefulness of Ivermectin prophylactic use.

36:03.000 --> 36:17.000
They believed very much in hybrid immunity with people who had been infected and also getting the the the Moderna or other shots.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
We are talking about some very, very serious.

36:24.000 --> 36:43.000
I don't know what's what to call it, but it's it's very dubious statements to be making given the actual video podcast record on YouTube of what he said and did.

36:43.000 --> 36:50.000
There was no reason to censor him in 2020.

36:50.000 --> 36:58.000
There was no reason to censor him in 2020. There was no reason to censor Joe Rogan in 2020.

36:58.000 --> 37:13.000
There was no reason to censor his brother or anybody else on that list in 2020, except for Peter McCullough, Pierre Corey, who he's stepping in front of now.

37:13.000 --> 37:27.000
He considers himself kind of the the the leader of that group, the best example of that group.

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
It's very, very, it can be very frustrating if you allow this bait to get to you.

37:33.000 --> 37:42.000
But what you need to see is that this is obviously part of the governance structure that they use to orchestrate this pandemic.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
This cannot be explained by arrogance and and ego alone.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
There's no way.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
It's impossible.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
And the disconnect that's on display right now between Brett and her.

37:59.000 --> 38:08.000
And if you don't see it, maybe you haven't watched him enough and then good for you, you know, you don't need to watch him. So you see it. But for me, I see it.

38:09.000 --> 38:24.000
And I, without wanting to sound too confident, I really feel like I can tell when people are lying. And right now, she is in love with Brett and fully unaware of the fact that he's lying about this stuff.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
And I think I've recorded a little bit to which I, but this podcast is extraordinary. You really got to watch it.

38:33.000 --> 38:50.000
Because he, he makes a lot of references that I just, I don't think he could make for any other reason than the work that Mark and I have done together and separately with regard to this, this subject and the stuff we did with regular guy.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
As a, as a trio.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
It's really extraordinary. Here we go.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Survived. We paid.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Heavy cost.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
But the fact that we remained.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Important nodes in the discussion.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
And staunch.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
And staunch did not.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Did not give in to.

39:15.000 --> 39:25.000
True speaker. Why can't you didn't give in to truth speak. You didn't give in to bandanas. You didn't give in to lockdowns for the first year. Yes, you did.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
You didn't give into the narrative of bush meat and market release. Yes, you did.

39:31.000 --> 39:39.000
You didn't perpetuate the idea that this is a lab leak. So we better. Maybe we should stay home longer. Yes, you did.

39:39.000 --> 39:52.000
You didn't have Yuri Dagan, the guy who knew about the fear and cleavage site and how infectious it would make the virus already in January of 2020 on your podcast and like February already or March.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah, you did.

39:57.000 --> 40:08.000
And so the legend that you're supposed to believe is that his speaking out about that stuff was all really brave, you know, who I was, I was way ahead on the lab leak.

40:08.000 --> 40:30.000
No, but you were way behind on the biology because you never taught people that actually they should have overlapping immunity to previous RNA viruses that would make them pretty invulnerable to a novel coronavirus that can't actually circulate the globe for three years in a consistent pattern of waves and colors.

40:31.000 --> 40:40.000
But again, remember, Brett Weinstein was on a signal chat with me for almost nine months where I taught him all the immunology I could.

40:40.000 --> 40:50.000
And at some point I asked him, you know, he was just getting frustrated. He didn't understand what I was trying to explain with transfection.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
And he didn't think it would be useful to be on a zoom chat with me.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Just for a half an hour to see if I could explain it.

40:58.000 --> 41:17.000
Same guy who interviewed Robert F Kennedy Jr. in 2021 and didn't release it until 2023 because, you know, archive and stuff is now saying that he's really one of the 10 people that the only you could have stopped this, all this resistance and the resistance

41:17.000 --> 41:27.000
would have meant nothing if it wasn't you could just take out these 10 people me and you included him and his wife are the 10 of the 10 most important.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Incidents in the movement.

41:30.000 --> 41:38.000
That's the poster of the intellectual dark web.

41:38.000 --> 41:51.000
This is exactly the cognitive game that's being played with you and our families and our friends and everybody that watches everybody that listens everybody that argues about Brett Weinstein.

41:51.000 --> 42:13.000
Because Tim Poole argues for Brett Weinstein and Sam Sader argues against Brett Weinstein and together they make a whole two or three million people debate about whether Brett Weinstein is a good guy and speaks up or is a crazy anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist.

42:13.000 --> 42:23.000
And so there's this whole pyramid of performances going on here, whether they willingly provide or winningly participate or unwittingly participate.

42:23.000 --> 42:31.000
That's what is being created with Brett Weinstein and intellectual dark web and Joe Rogan at the top.

42:31.000 --> 42:41.000
And then all these little podcasts underneath it that are slightly less popular, you know, like Huberman and Lex Friedman.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
And then underneath that you have Tim Poole and Sam Seder and all these other weird ones.

42:49.000 --> 43:05.000
And this is the kind of network that's left over after the careful crafting and censorship of three years and amplification over three years of these people that they wanted to rise.

43:05.000 --> 43:16.000
And the ones that have locked horns or ended up trying to manipulate Mark and myself have been the ones that haven't really risen.

43:16.000 --> 43:29.000
Presumably because the truth and the sunlight that comes along with trying to influence Mark and I is pretty hard to stand in.

43:29.000 --> 43:40.000
And that's why people like Brett Weinstein went from loving to have a signal chat with me to not wanting to listen to me anymore and not mentioning me anymore.

43:40.000 --> 43:52.000
And the reason why he never really mentioned me on his stream is again because this is a fight that very few people are actually fighting.

43:52.000 --> 44:07.000
Most of the people wittingly or unwittingly are participating in the sustaining of this faith in a novel virus that millions of people died from but also millions of people were saved from likely originated and gain a function which is certainly a real thing.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
And therefore virus could come again.

44:10.000 --> 44:23.000
That is the job of these people from the very beginning to make sure that the worst case scenario was believed and the faith was never questioned.

44:23.000 --> 44:36.000
And now he's taking credit for being a questioner to prefer being a doubter for being a guy who who otherwise the pandemic would have just rolled over us.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
And Heather's Heather's definitely along with that idea of course we were we were staunch.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
This review come through.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
Just discussed at this moment.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
I mean, all of the people you mentioned were messed with.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
We did get messed with we just didn't get completely obliterated.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
Right. The fact is we survived.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
We paid.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Heavy cost.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
But the fact that we.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh, come on.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
No.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I'm going to get this right.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
I very apologize here.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Let's do it.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Just discussed.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
At this moment.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
I mean, all of the people you have caused.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
I mean, they had.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
We just didn't get completely obliterated.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
Right. The fact is we survived.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
We paid.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Heavy cost.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
But the fact that we remained.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Important nodes in the discussion.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
And staunch.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Didn't did not.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
Did not give in to.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Unreal.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Why can't I think of the writer.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Unreal.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Newspeak.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Newspeak.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Yeah.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Did not.

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
Continued to assess what we thought was what the evidence suggested.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
So true for everyone you mentioned and many more.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
The list I've given is not complete much.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
There are lots of people who played an important role in that.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
So I want to just rescue two terms.

46:22.000 --> 46:30.000
One, I would say the prediction implied by the concept of surgical totalitarianism is now clearly true.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
Renee Darest is talking about surgical totalitarianism in terms designed to make it sound.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
Surgical totalitarianism.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
Not to be confused with the phenomenon of mass psychosis.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Something something or other.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
I don't remember what the other one was.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
It could be best described as worst case scenario.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Team worst case scenario.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
But it's also just kind of like stupid complicated.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
Brett is extraordinarily bad at making things simple.

47:04.000 --> 47:12.000
He's extraordinarily bad at using simple word combinations so that everybody understands what he means.

47:12.000 --> 47:21.000
And he has this propensity to really enjoy repeating these kinds of things like he just did surgical totalitarianism.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Wow, I love that combination of words.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
That guy's really smart.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
But if you say something like transfection is not immunization, he wants, I don't really understand what you mean.

47:35.000 --> 47:42.000
And I don't think 30 minutes on a Zoom would ever help me understand what you mean.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
This is the kind of magnificent controlled op that Brett Weinstein is.

47:48.000 --> 47:57.000
He actually told Dan Cohen, a man with four years of experience in Gaza, that he wasn't the right guy to discuss

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
anything to do with Israel because he's an evolutionary biologist.

48:02.000 --> 48:14.000
And so the two of them look at the situation differently, even though he's happy to tweet about anything to do with it and very politically so.

48:14.000 --> 48:21.000
We really have to work on these pressure points because actually this is one of the weakest ones.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
And when this one falls, lots of other ones will fall.

48:25.000 --> 48:37.000
And as long as they're going to keep extending themselves further and further out on this precipice of lies, we need to make sure that we don't allow it to happen.

48:37.000 --> 48:47.000
And so listen carefully as this continues because this is no joke.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Nonetheless, it's obviously a real thing.

48:50.000 --> 49:06.000
She is well aware as a person who is a central node in the censorship industrial complex that it doesn't make sense to censor everybody who says stuff that violates the mainstream narrative, which you really just need to do is decapitate the emerging sense making

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
capacity and then people are free to talk among themselves.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
They can have whatever beliefs they like.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
It just doesn't threaten power.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
So that's one thing.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Surgical totalitarianism turns out.

49:15.000 --> 49:30.000
So why are we talking about surgical totalitarianism when, when Noam Chomsky explained it much simpler as a limited spectrum of debate that doesn't threaten the actual, the actual truth.

49:30.000 --> 49:38.000
And then encouraging a lively debate within that spectrum so that people see this as, wow, that's pretty cool.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
Like Fox and MSNBC.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
Why does it have to be more complicated than that?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Why aren't we citing Noam Chomsky?

49:48.000 --> 50:00.000
Why are we citing a new person and so surgical totalitarianism when it's really just a spectacular commitment to lies?

50:00.000 --> 50:09.000
There are two or three groups of people that are spectacularly committed to the lies that they tell and that's how this is done.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It's not surgical totalitarianism.

50:11.000 --> 50:20.000
If it is, that's a more complicated word for something that can be much more simply described as a spectacular commitment to lies.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
That's what you're seeing here right now.

50:27.000 --> 50:37.000
Improvisational acting about the importance of lies.

50:37.000 --> 50:49.000
So in later in the podcast, they pull this stunt where Heather says that she's bringing up a review an anonymous review.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And they're going to talk about it.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
And then in the anonymous review, they are accused of a few things and then they will address those few things.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And I think that this is a stunt.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I don't think this is a real review.

51:02.000 --> 51:11.000
I think this is, you know, their clever way of saying, well, how could we address this idea that we're not really controlled by Peter Teal?

51:11.000 --> 51:18.000
How can we really address these conspiracy theories without, without, without giving much credence to them?

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
How can we really ignore the real conspiracy while feigning that we're addressing it?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
And that's how they do it.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Here it comes.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
This review come through this week about the podcast.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Dangerously stupid.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
This podcast kills people.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
One star.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
People have literally died because of the misinformation on vaccines and Ivermectin spread by this podcast.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Apple needs to remove it.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Call Brett what you will.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Chaos agent.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Peter Teal's puppet.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Sociopath.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Massad agent.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Wow.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
What is absolutely clear is the man has an unwell mind and he wants to influence yours.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Run.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Yeah.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
So.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I just found that.

52:00.000 --> 52:07.000
I mean, honestly, delightful at one level because it so encapsulates the.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Inanity.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Like, I don't even know.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Maybe this isn't doing a real person, right?

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
Or it's a real person, but it's someone who's been paid to put this sort of thing out there and all of the.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
All of the people's platforms who are.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
He's stuck.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
It they snuck in snuck in the little, you know, Zionist bit there, right?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Massad agent.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Massad agent.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Yeah.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
That's a good one.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
I will point out there was an exchange on Twitter in which.

52:39.000 --> 52:46.000
Somebody had also said something incredibly stupid about me and.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Gator, our friend.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Who is not in fact an animated crocodile.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
We don't know that.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
You do.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Yeah.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
I do too.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Well, not animated cartoon cartoon.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Cartoon.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
But anyway, he pointed out.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Their son runs their stream.

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
Writing this scathing declaration about me was obviously a moron.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
At least he spelled my name correctly.

53:15.000 --> 53:24.000
To which Alexandra's marinos pointed out that that actually likely implied that it was a bot and then on looking at the profile of the person.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
It was pretty clear.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
It was not a real honest to goodness person.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
This also contained a correct spelling of my name.

53:31.000 --> 53:38.000
That may have been automated having just copied my name from whatever it was that triggered the scaling review.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
But anyway, that it fits with both.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
You know, both what we were talking about with regard to what we're named arrest is up to.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
The kinds of things the FCC is trying to get its.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
Into with regard to the powers that it would grant itself.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
And then.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
I'm only giving you a little brief, brief clips of this it.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
We could have probably watched it for 20 minutes or so, but.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
I didn't want to spend too much time on it.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But here this was also pretty funny.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Oh, no, this is a full conspiracy theory.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Unfalsifiable in fact.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
That somehow connects my family to the.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Your natal family, not this family here.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Correct.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
To the Robert Kennedy assassination.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
Oh, on the basis that my dad.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
Oh, she says, ha, ha, ha, so this is really acting right.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
And now remember.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
The connection is not to the Kennedy assassination.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
The connection is to the Kennedy administration.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
The connection is to the litemite case that basically defined what the FDA does.

54:50.000 --> 55:00.000
The connection was to the intellectual property space that is defined by the FDA and how long his dad's been swimming in it.

55:00.000 --> 55:11.000
The discussion was about the idea that he sat down with with Bobby Kennedy in his house for three hours and they didn't bother to broach that subject at all.

55:11.000 --> 55:20.000
And now he starts out by saying that this is about the Kennedy assassination and somehow he's involved or that he hates Kennedy.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
What?

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
That's not anything that we ever reported.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
It's not anything I ever asked him over signal.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
That's right.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm not afraid to say it.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
When we learned about Brett Weinstein's dad and Eric Weinstein's dad.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
I sent him a signal message and just asked him about it.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
And his response was what's with all the interrogation.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
Ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing something here.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
I don't know if you can call it.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
Bearing false witness or what this is.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
But this story is made up.

56:00.000 --> 56:09.000
This rumor of him being involved in the JFK assassination is made up out of whole cloth.

56:09.000 --> 56:18.000
The only rumors about him and JFK are the JFK appointed his father to RFK's Department of Justice.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
The first patent lawyer to ever have been appointed to the Department of Justice.

56:23.000 --> 56:38.000
He was involved in the thalidomide case that had a real foundational role in defining the FRDAs role in the American economy.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
And listen to him twist this around and make it seem like it's not about any of that.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
It's not about intellectual property law.

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
It's not about his dad being involved in biotech for like 20 years.

56:52.000 --> 57:03.000
It's not his dad being involved in the antibody patent paradox or being involved in advising Eric Weinstein on how to advise Peter Thiel and where to put his money.

57:03.000 --> 57:22.000
Couldn't possibly be that Peter Thiel was in absolera because of something that Les Weinstein would have told him about the intellectual property space of and monoclonal antibodies changing in 2019 or 20 or a 16 or all the times that it changed up to and approaching the pandemic.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Course not.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
It's about the Kennedy assassination.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
Worked for Bobby Kennedy in the Justice Department and I'm not sure how that.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Yeah.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Now working for with it on behalf of the man definitely means that you hate him.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Right.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
That's the leap.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
And in fact, at one point I was going to see Bobby and the younger.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Yes.

57:51.000 --> 57:59.000
And yes, I was born a year after Bobby Kennedy senior was killed.

57:59.000 --> 58:17.000
But anyway, I introduced my dad to Bobby Kennedy Jr. and they talked about the fact that my dad had worked for for Bobby's father.

58:18.000 --> 58:27.000
And so anyway, the idea that any connection at all, any for Bobby's father that my dad had worked.

58:27.000 --> 58:38.000
But anyway, I introduced my dad to Bobby Kennedy Jr. and they talked about the fact that my dad had worked for for Bobby's father.

58:38.000 --> 58:53.000
So anyway, the idea that any connection at all, any wisp of some ancient connection is going to be turned into some obviously conspiratorial something is obviously a bad instinct that people have.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
No, it sure is.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
I did.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I don't want to spend much time on it.

59:00.000 --> 59:06.000
I mean, that's some pretty extraordinary that's a pretty extraordinary point about the normalization.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
That's some pretty extraordinary obfuscation of the truth.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
And it's, it's bald face storytelling.

59:14.000 --> 59:22.000
It's bald face storytelling because he's talking about my signal chat with him. He's talking about the private message I sent to him about his dad.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
And about the stuff that Mark has done and the stuff that I've done and the stuff that we talked about with regular guy.

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
There is no other rumor. There is no other story on the Internet.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
They're making this up. Otherwise, they'd show the tweet.

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
Otherwise, he'd show the tweet where he dunked on him about it where they'd show the Reddit thread where they dunked on him or they'd show the comments from this.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
This is just ridiculous.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:05.000
What you have to see is this is absolute and this podcast is absolute confirmation that one of the major players, one of the major groups.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's functioning as part of our governance structure is this Peter Teal, Elon Musk, Weinstein, Rogan intellectual dark web group that includes Shapiro and.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Oh my gosh, do you see it?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Once we shed this layer and all the sub layers of it, all the fakers of it, all the people that are just going along because it's great to be a podcast that gets kickdowns from Rogan.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
It's great to be a podcast that gets kickdowns from Lex Friedman.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It's great to get kickdowns and have your own podcast and that's what all these people do.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
All sponsored by Element, the salt drink or sponsored by some other.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Once you see this network for what it is, once you see the performance for what it is, you can't unsee it.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Hi everyone, Megan Cohen, director of the CDC and I'm here with Senator Schumer, but it's an important message for you about vaccines.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And what's many good things about our director, one of whom she's from Baldwin, New York, we're urging everybody to get their flu shot and their updated COVID booster.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
They don't hurt these shots don't hurt anymore like they used to when I was a kid and they do you a lot of good. Please get your shot.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It'll avoid a lot of pain later.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Thanks, Senator.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:58.000
If people are willing to go on television with the spectacular commitment to these lies, what are we going to do about that?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
That's the task we have at hand.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
A discussion today at our weekly urgent care provider meeting and actually was talking to one of our oncologists who's on our P&T committee locally.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
At this point, we have seen hundreds of thousands, millions of doses. I think Pfizer was saying they've released 2.3 million doses of vaccine already.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:31.000
We're not seeing issues. So we're really kind of moving a little bit of a decision making to just millions of doses of RSV vaccine for our folks, older folks getting the RSV vaccines.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And as we mentioned with the NERSEVA MAM shortage, really trying to get pregnant women in that last trimester, the protection that they can then transfer to their to their children for this upcoming season.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Daniel, we have a text from CDC VSA. Remember that program where you'd?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yes, yes.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Now they say it's open for 60 plus adults who get an RSV vaccine.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Okay. Yeah. And so they say register and tell us how you feel after RSV vaccine. How do they know I got one?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Did you get your RSV vaccine, Vincent? Yeah, I did. I got RSV COVID and flu all at once.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Okay, that's fantastic. Well, let's talk about that for a second. So the way I think he's got to be not telling the truth.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I don't I don't I don't know what else to say. I don't I don't believe that he did it.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I don't think he's talking like he did it.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Did you did you get your RSV vaccine, Vincent? Yeah, I did. I got RSV COVID and flu all at once.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Okay, that's that's fantastic. And what we should well, let's talk about that for a second. So the way they know, and this is nice.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:53.000
A lot of states actually have a centralized place where, you know, for instance, my patient comes and sees me that that gets uploaded to the state.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And there's a nice system where I see that a person has covered their recommended vaccinations, other health maintenance things.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
So it's really a great resource. And what you did is really what we recommend.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You know, there was there was a little bit in the media that came out recently about, oh, I don't know if people showed RSV and flu at the same time.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Because there was one study where we looked at a specific age group over 85 and and there was a slight minimal statistically significant increase in strokes.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You know, that that's getting to the point of data mining when you start like looking for something like that.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Because we have lots of other studies, you know, you really decrease your risk.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Interesting enough with the flu vaccine, you're decreasing your risk of having heart attacks of strokes of getting hospitalized for even non flu related issues.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So the recommendation for the board is don't miss an opportunity to do that.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That's a new one.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Just like, you know, Vincent, you're a role model there, probably because you're aware of the cape and the spike t-shirt.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But yeah, yeah, let's let's get everyone protected so that this becomes the year when we say what happened with RSV.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So I got mine at a CVS would.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Would they work?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You got GSK.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I got GSK.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You know how I know that is that's actually why GSK is winning over Pfizer.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
They got the CVS contract on RSV vaccines, but they would they report it to CDC?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
They report to the state.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I see.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Yeah, so it's a state state thing.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I don't even know what to say, but apparently, Vincent got his three shots.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I thought I had one more video of him where he says that he got his COVID in one arm and this one and the other and he had no pain from all of them.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And anyway, that I know that that's part of that that podcast to it doesn't really matter.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I really, I really am going to push this idea of a orchestrated illusion of consensus that was really set up from very early on and even set in motion before the pandemic actually started.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
These people were all put in place.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And at some point in 2021, we went extraordinarily.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Maybe even in 2020 we went extraordinarily off narrative.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And they had to really course correct and that's why so many people through their head in the ring at the same time.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's not for nothing that Steve Kersch, Robert Malone and and Brett Weinstein were all on the same broadcast when when this illusion of consensus was really solidified and the leaders of it were really established.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
It's not for nothing that there are areas that had massive spikes of the virus the same as let's say Northern Italy.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's more important even to say that that how many of these people just absolutely positively abjectly ignore Denny Rancor.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Robert Malone ignores him.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Steve Kersch ignores him.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Steve Kersch is promoting his own debate about vaccine effectiveness and a $10 million challenge.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It's always promoting himself.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Nobody talks about Denny Rancor.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:39.000
He's got like four different analyses on all cause mortality that seem to make an argument about the fact that you can only really see a reliable signal when you look for correlations with massive rollouts of transfection or transformation.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
There's no evidence of the spread of a contagious respiratory virus.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And even after appearing on the Kim Iverson show he didn't really have any momentum nobody really cared.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000
It's not like Robert Malone tweeted this video out to his 1.10 million followers.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I mean if you think about the list of people that Brett Weinstein said you know are the 10 people that had to be stopped and the pandemic would have been completely different.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
None of those people have even said Denny Rancor's name out loud.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
It's magical.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
In New York who did not use any of those treatment protocols but stuck with the tried and true of how you deal with the respiratory illness.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And that's interesting.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Yeah.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Okay, so that spike that initial spike you caused it due to the virus.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You understand I'm arguing it's not due to a virus at all.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
It's due to the what with the measures that were applied.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
That's what killed people.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
People could come in.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But we did see a spot.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I mean are you.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I guess we have to ask.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Do you believe that COVID-19 as a virus exists at all that SARS-CoV-2 exists.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I think that question is irrelevant. What I'm trying to say is all the data.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That is a firm hard all cause mortality data is inconsistent with the idea of a particularly virulent at the gym that spreads.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It's inconsistent with that.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So you can believe that there's a whole spectrum of viruses and bacteria and whatever you want.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But there was nothing special or new in terms of these pathogens that did anything that spreads that the data is inconsistent with that.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
So you don't have to get into the question of whether or not viruses exist and all these all these exotic things.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I don't even want to touch that. I'm just saying my view of the data is that this is not a spreading pathogen period.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
It's inconsistent with that is disproved by the data.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But you asked the question well were there places where they weren't applying these these very horrendous protocols and that still had spikes.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Well our data we've done studies about this and for example Germany did not apply these fancy protocols.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Germany did business as usual and had zero peak at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There is no signal there whatsoever in the entire territory of Germany.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So when you make a map of Europe and you put colors on for the intensity of that peak.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
It's red in northern France for example around London around Madrid.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There's these horrible red spots and it does not cross the border into Germany whatsoever Germany stays white on the map if you like.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But I guess what I'm saying is that what I'm saying is that you know as they were tracking the virus itself and the spread of the virus.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:55.000
They were saying then that the answer to that would be well because Germany had taken all these measures that they weren't getting the virus into their country yet that it hadn't spread into Germany.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So if it was spreading in Italy.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I see spreading spreading spreading tracking tracking tracking when they were tracking the virus listen to how vigorously Kim Iris and defends the faith in a novel virus that spread and killed millions about millions were saved from.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's a very vigorous debate a very vigorous defense of the spread we saw the spread of the virus the virus spread the spread virus and spreading virus in the tracking of the spread virus.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
It's red in northern France for example around London around Madrid.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:38.000
There's these horrible red spots and it does not cross the border into Germany whatsoever Germany stays white on the map if you like.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:51.000
But I guess what I'm saying is that what I'm saying is that you know as they were tracking the virus itself and the spread of the virus they were saying then that the answer to that would be well because Germany had taken all these measures that they weren't

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000
getting the virus into their country yet that they're it hadn't spread into Germany so if it was spreading in Italy but not in Germany spreading.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You can wave your hand like that. Okay, first of all, I don't believe that they were.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
They weren't tracking mortality. They may have been tracking something that they call.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The cases of COVID or whatever with these very suspicious tests that they were using and so on they can they can do all of that and they can count cases.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I put all that aside and I look at mortality, because it's the only thing that I'm sure of, and it's something you can measure and be certain of and all the all the jurisdictions do it.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And when I look at mortality, there is no evidence of any spread.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You have bursts of mortality when you start doing something.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So, right, right at the beginning when you started applying these aggressive protocols you had certain hotspots that had peaks that mortality did not spread. It didn't then.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So you're saying it doesn't matter if there was a virus or not circulating because you're not even looking at that you're looking at deaths and only deaths.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:15.000
You look at mortality and the deaths in areas you're not seeing deaths spread from one region to a next to a next that would indicate that something was spreading around killing people.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:28.000
That's right. Now, Kim, in fact, I see the opposite. That's what's important. I see the opposite. I see the US, which has a very large number of very vulnerable people that did die.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:44.000
In the US, the excess mortality during the COVID period correlates perfectly with the poverty, the number of people living in poverty in the state. You get this incredible correlation line that goes through the origin of Pearson correlation

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:53.000
of the coefficient of 0.86, which is unheard of. And so it was poor people who died, and especially in the southern states.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Now, you cross this thousand kilometers of border between Canada and the US and there were no deaths in Canada in that whole period.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Virtually none. You can hardly detect the excess mortality in Canada compared to the United States. That's impossible. These are two of the biggest trading partners in the world.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:20.000
The highways were open. It's impossible that a virus that is said to have been spreading did not want to cross the border to Canada.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Same thing. I think that we've heard people on our side say that was the most infectious virus the earth has ever seen.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Like the most infectious virus ever.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You'll have the Trudeau's of the world and all the Trudeau's supporters saying, well, that's because we implemented some serious protocols that prevented people from traveling.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:56.000
You couldn't even travel in Canada. You guys were in major lockdown unlike what we were here in the United States. The lockdown levels that you guys experienced was much harsher.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So they would say, I would think that you can always wave your hands and say that kind of thing.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But if you believe that it's that it is a pandemic causing virus, you cannot believe that it will refuse to cross the border like that. That's just that's just incredible.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:22.000
There's no science that makes any sense if you want to believe that. But also, we in one of our studies, which I co-authored the lead author was John Johnson from Harvard University.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And we authored a paper where we looked at states in the United States and we compared neighboring states that share a border, one that locked down and the other didn't.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And they were comparable otherwise. We found 12 pairs of states like that that you could directly compare. And we found unambiguously that the lockdowns that states have these large excess mortalities, which were not present in the non lockdown neighbor that shared a border with it.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Okay, so that makes sense to me, except how do you explain that, you know, my guess is the hospitals were not overwhelmed in Canada, right? So it's like the people still have to show up.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I mean, they don't magically, you know, they can't magically use a ventilator, right?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And that has large cities and large hospitals. And they were claiming the same kinds of problems of overwork and over this and over that in Canada as anywhere, any other major city in the world, they were all screaming that.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Okay. So just because it's a big country and a relatively small population doesn't mean.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Well, you can see why why he's not getting attention. You can see why I've got him in the green here and you can see why he needs to be cordoned off.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Because he's threatening this idea that there was a novel virus that millions of people died from a novel virus that millions of people were saved from a novel virus that gain a function is real and it was spreading like that because it was gain a function.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
This could come again.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And you can hear Kim Iverson fighting desperately to preserve this faith.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:17.000
This tunnel of mythology that we are trapped in by people like Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch and Joe Rogan and everyone on this screen.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Because none of these people on this screen either have the insight or the courage to question these fundamental mis truths, these fundamental pillars of this mythology that they want to govern our children by.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Because they know this is true.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And I have been kind of up on these guys because number one, they blocked me and number two, they are pushing this DNA contamination as being some kind of very significant thing that otherwise everything would be fine.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And that's a particular critique of Phillip Buckholtz because Phillip Buckholtz is the guy who spoke in front of the South Carolina Senate.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And after he spoke in front of the South Carolina Senate he answered some questions and in that question and answer he said that as the shots stand right now he would still recommend them for his parents but he might not recommend them for his daughter

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
and he himself wouldn't take them unless they could show that this DNA wasn't in there anymore.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Otherwise he thinks that the technology is great.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And yes he said that.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And I respectfully disagree with him as a biologist and as a father and as a.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Yeah.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The reason why I disagree with him I need to explain this again really quick because.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:56.000
When I explained it yesterday I was a little imprecise about where these small interfering RNAs might come from and I think I made a little bit of a misstatement so I just want to clear it up here.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So a transfection in its purest form is wholly inappropriate for healthy humans.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:08.000
The analogy that I've been using lately is your grandma's apple pie and if you ask grandma to make 10,000 or 100,000 or even a million of her pies.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:18.000
He would have a whole host of issues with regard to scaling up that process in order to make those pies in any reasonable length of time.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And that challenge was of course present in this scaling up of a transfection which would typically be manufactured on a bench and a nanogram scales instead to manufacture similar quantities.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Sorry similar quality but in kilograms.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And many people including Michael Eden very early on predicted that this was something that they were kind of glossing over as not being a big deal.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
But actually it was.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And I actually think it was clear to some people already in 2020 that the.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
The lipid nanoparticles and the RNA that were used in the trial were produced in a different way than the.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Mass production process to I do think that people were saying it but I haven't really.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:22.000
In my notes I don't really have who was saying I don't know where I heard it so I can't really claim that that was something that was out there but it did come out earlier this year now.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So the RNA was impure is something we've known from the very beginning because when they submitted their documents to the EU and to the FDA there was not a single band on the RNA gel but it was a smear and that smear means.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:45.000
All this fragmented RNA or or or what we don't know because they didn't sequence it but there are many many many many tiny RNAs.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And so that means that there's impurities in that RNA that can result in.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
You know not perfect production of the spike protein obviously but also.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000
All of these RNAs can have many many unknown consequences especially given the.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Huge overlap in many of the sequences of the spike protein.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:20.000
With our own endogenous sequences they're small short overlaps but they're still important relative from an epitome perspective and they're more they also are also important from the perspective of any of these RNA fragments that were produced.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
In this process too and then not can't remove them so they're in these lipid nanoparticles as well.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And interestingly one thing to say about that is that by talking about the DNA and the contamination of the DNA they are in a way distracting from the fact that the RNA was definitely impure.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And it is possible that double stranded DNA is less dangerous than small interfering RNAs that might be the consequence of this horrible production method of these RNAs having a lot of short transcripts in that.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That could actually be a bigger problem than the double stranded DNA from from a molecular perspective simply because maybe this is just a hypothesis.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Maybe the immune system and our cellular machinery is much more capable of rejecting double stranded DNA fragments than it would be capable of rejecting small interfering RNAs or modulatory RNAs or RNAs that would otherwise mess with the endogenous RNAs present in our cells.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
If double stranded DNA is more immunogenic then it'll be cleared easier.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And so the potential here for the focus on double stranded DNA to be really an actual orchestrated attempt to distract us from all these other sources of danger and reasons to believe that they are criminally negligent is number one first of all that even in its purest form they had to know

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
that it was bad for healthy humans. They had to know they had to know they had to know.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And so you don't need to go all the way down the list until you get to the double stranded DNA fragments that they recently found because you can start with number one then you go down to number two and you know that for sure that resulted in a lot of problems which yes include double stranded DNA.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
They include endotoxins from the bacteria for sure.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But the RNA was in pure from the beginning so we knew it wasn't going to produce spike only but it was going to produce all kinds of protein fragments and those fragmented RNAs were all packaged up in the in the lipid nanoparticle as well.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So the RNA was code on optimize that means that there's going to be misfolding that means that whatever whatever epitopes are created are not necessarily the same epitopes would be would be created when the real viral coding of the spike was sent through the same

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:07.000
ribosome. Very similar problems result from the chemical alteration of the modified RNA.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Two main important ones are that the pseudoyiridine can cause premature stop codons which will then again give you truncated proteins and also can be effectively a wobble base so that many different substitutions in that amino acid chain and that therefore the complex

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:39.000
the 3D construction of the protein that gets that results that this is also just going to add variability to the epitopes that are available after this transfection and challenge the immune system further.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Not to overreact. It's just all added variability that you don't want if your goal is to usefully augment the immune system which obviously that's their goal.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.000
So the protein produces on characterizing highly variable for the reasons 3, 4, and 5.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:17.000
That means that your immune system is not given a a perfect set of epitopes but a huge bouquet of variability that it's supposed to sort through and somehow produce a useful immune response which is a pretty pretty ridiculous statement.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:29.000
So the LNP was never tested this is very important and we have of course you know right from the horse's mouth Peter Cullis thanks to Robert Malone's recommendation in his sub stack the day after the Nobel Prize was awarded.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:46.000
We watched a video with Peter Cullis and at the end during the question and answer he said that he burnt the lives of four five postdocs on the task of trying to target lipid nanoparticles to a particular region or a particular tissue and they failed and were probably 40 years away from ever achieving that.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So we already knew that the lipid nanoparticles wouldn't stay where we put them.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:05.000
We already knew that there was this huge variability in where they would go and what that would do because we already knew that tissues have their own special ribosomes and so if you express the same RNA and different tissues you probably are going to get different proteins

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:20.000
and definitely going to get different you know different lengths of their lifetimes of the RNA different regulation of the RNA based on the particular cell type that you express it in all of these things were known.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
All of these things were known.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
None of these things are a surprise.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Like Robert Malone said on on on Brett Weinstein's podcast that I just assumed that they fixed all these problems.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
No, that doesn't even make sense.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Because all of these things are known. I'm not I'm not some.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I had to learn this.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I had to make this list over many months of study, but not Robert Malone.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Not Berzowski, not Fauci, not David Baltimore, not Vincent Rancin yellow.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
They don't need they didn't need they knew this.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Not Annie DeGroat, not not Peter Teal, not Eric Weinstein.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.000
These people knew this stuff and if they didn't know it then people that they knew knew it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
They've known it for decades.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
They've known that endotoxins are highly immunogenic.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
They know that. Why do they know that?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
If they make a protein bio.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
If they make a protein product.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Which is a biologic.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
They can use anion exchange chromatography to remove all of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And in fact monoclonal antibodies are held to a standard of zero nucleic acids.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:16.000
It's one of the most expensive parts of the process of developing monoclonal and producing monoclonal antibodies so much so that entire batches can be thrown away if they don't pass the testing for purity after they are subject to anion exchange chromatography.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Because it's so expensive to run the batch through that process again would lose all the profit of the batch and maybe even cost more money and can be recouped by the sale.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And this is also a well understood part of the process of making monoclonal antibodies and of the regulatory process and structure that protects these as products as pure products.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Anybody that was involved in arbitration of these biological ideas, these biological products like monoclonal antibodies would definitely understand some or all of these sort of production requirements.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Surely Robert Malone would understand these production requirements surely the vaccine center of the NIH and Barney and all these people would definitely know the limitations of transfection.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:33.000
The limitations of lipid nanoparticles, the limitations of mass manufacturing using a bacterial basis of plasma replication, they know, they can't not know because these are not new technologies ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And so yeah, there are double stranded DNA fragments from process to their sure are and you know what we were told for almost two years that we had to be concerned because the spike was toxic.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:30:02.000
The spike from the back from the vaccine is actually sometimes causing myocarditis but man oh man the spike from the back from the virus did cause a lot more myocarditis.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And there were lots of people in our movement that spent many, many months, many, many podcasts, many, many sub stacks talking about the spike and how it might have been the wrong protein.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:38.000
The source said maybe we should have used the end protein, Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone discussed how maybe we shouldn't have used this extremely toxic protein maybe we should have taken some of the epitopes out.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Maybe we should have just used the receptor binding domain.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The conversation occurred over over a year and a half ladies and gentlemen do not forget how long no one said anything about RNA and purity codon optimization chemically altered your stop codons or the protein being uncharacterized in highly variable.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:20.000
People and talked about the lipid nanoparticle going everywhere in the body as being a significant thing except for very few people and somehow or another these leading dissidents these 10 people who saved the world have never been able to put all these things together in a single presentation.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:27.000
They've never been able to summarize all the dangers while they're on stage.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:37.000
People can only talk about Ivermectin other people can only talk about informed consent other people can only talk about a lab leak other people can only talk about myocarditis.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:49.000
But nobody seems to be able to summarize it all together at once as lying except for Mike Eden and Nick Hudson and me.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Get no amplification on social media.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
None.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And no amplification from any of these really you know people that suffered sacrificed a lot for our dissident movement.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:29.000
These guys I mean these guys who've talked about them all.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
This is where we are.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:47.000
They want your kids data they want to make it normal for children to believe in pandemics and believe in public health and take the word of the doctors and more vaccines the better.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Take your recommended vaccines and the way out is to explain this lie.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:02.000
This faith in a novel virus and the ability to detect it with high fidelity.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:11.000
National security plan that was already there and the only way they could have done it with any sort of honesty.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Is that they used a clone and they seeded it in multiple places so that the people that they tried to culture would be pretty successful and they would definitely get a sequence that would match other sequences in the world.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And remove any shadow of a doubt from anybody that was looking for proof of a pandemic.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
That would be it.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And without the sophisticated understanding of what RNA and DNA can and can't do.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Without a pretty sophisticated understanding of how exaggerated the fidelity of our understanding and the infectious cycle is without a sophisticated understanding of how the immune system works and doesn't work.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It's very easy for somebody to be shown that data has a bureaucrat a high paid diplomat bureaucrat and say that okay you remember that thing we drilled.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
You remember that plan we had well it's time to put that plan into motion.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And that's what they did.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And that plan that is in motion includes the inversion of our sovereignty to permissions it includes that so as soon as there was a pandemic.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
All of these government bureaucrats understand that okay we're moving to digital ID no.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Okay we're moving to lockdown and digital ID they knew that already that's something you need to understand a lot of these people know where this is going and have known where it's going for a long time.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:51.000
That's why they've been so confident that they're right.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:01.000
That's why even people on the dissident side are actually walking a very fine line between warning you and announcing it.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
And if you listen carefully you can hear that a lot of times people are just more or less announcing it.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
The who has power.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
The who if they pass a treaty you lose.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Is that warning you or is that just telling you what's going to happen and announcing the thing you're supposed to accept.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Be very wary of people who purport to be warning you and actually are only announcing what's going to happen.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And so this all revolves around of course this idea of pandemic potential being available in bat caves being accessible through cell culture being accessible through animal passage or being successful through genetic stitch work.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And again the worst case scenario is this story that Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris and and Rand Paul and Tony Fauci and.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And the the proximal origins authors and all of these people that were emailing with Tony Fauci early on they all created this illusion of a cover up of a gain of function virus leak.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:30.000
And the illusion of a cover up is still going on now Paul off it and the same podcast that I cited earlier also said that it's just ridiculous that people are still talking about this as a lab leak of course it wasn't a lab leak it was a leak.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It was a jump and they happen and that's how this stuff works.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
The bat cave potential is all you need for Paul off it.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:56.000
The stitching together a viruses is all you need to condemn equal health alliance and you can fight about either of these as potential and you agree with the premise that there are pandemic potential viruses that we need public health to protect us from.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And that we need cures for the best cures are vaccines.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
That's the illusion of consensus that there was a novel virus killed millions of people that millions of people were saved.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Can a function is real and therefore the virus will come again and they will they do this by again not doing the math of excess deaths and many people on our side are not doing the math of excess deaths.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
They're still attributing way too many deaths to a novel virus that didn't kill anybody.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:40.000
A novel virus that only exists in the context of PCR tests novel virus that only exists in the context of PCR tests and lateral flow tests.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
It's just absurd at this stage.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:38:02.000
The do not resuscitate orders in New York City the ventilators that were used the lack of antibiotics the poor use of steroids remdesivir madazalam opioid deaths on top of that and death certificate fraud because it was financially encouraged.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:11.000
None of this is ever they don't ever do this equation. They don't ever subtract this stuff.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:20.000
More importantly they avoid the discussion of the PCR fraud the idea that you know that we were even testing for anything.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The lateral flow test fraud was the similar thing done in the UK.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:37.000
The variance in the sequences are just taken on face value RNA infectious clones basically caused everybody to block me everybody to attack me.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:52.000
People worth millions of dollars decided that Jay was worth tweeting about all because I tried to teach people that RNA infectious clones are the only technology that allow them to study any form of an RNA virus.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000
They can't study RNA viruses without making clones of them.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And it's just absurd how people reacted to this revelation this description as well it doesn't matter.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000
So much so that you know we have to ignore Jay now.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:30.000
The same basic thing happened when I started to explore quasi species genetics but it I think that was an it was an easier concept for them to fend off because it is more complicated and it's more mathematical it's more theoretical.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
The RNA infectious clone thing is really like making cakes.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:52.000
And once you explain that making cakes can only go a certain way it's pretty easy for everybody to understand it once you do the mixtape is pretty easy to understand once you explain mp3s versus flak files it makes sense.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And so you know incompetent fraction all the stuff about virology we don't talk about any of it they don't teach any of it because it questions the very principle of a novel virus it questions the very principle of pandemic potential and gain a function and all this stuff.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And they don't want that they need that they want your kids to believe that this virus was created by evil people that didn't have respect for mother nature.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:25.000
They want you to believe that it's becoming ever more easy to do this because all these tools are so we're going to be using CRISPR to make make viruses that are 10 times worse than this one.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:37.000
They want your children they want our our college age kids they want young people to believe this so that they grow up in a world where they accept this as true.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Then they'll be the easiest to govern citizens that have ever walked the earth.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
That's the goal.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000
All the information about this mythology is available on their phone.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:00.000
The latest updates on the mythology come in on the phone the images and the facts and figures of the mythology come in on the phone.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And so if they want you to jump through hoops because people are shooting each other on the other side of the planet they can make that happen if they want you to stay at home they can make that happen.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:18.000
They want you to think that there was an attack in another city they can make that happen with this little device right here it's a window to the world.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
An illusion of consensus is created by the last four people that you read that all agreed.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Obviously I don't need to think about it then.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I mean if Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch all agree who am I to argue with these three successful men.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:50.000
We worked together to create this illusion of a Scooby-Doo mystery that we had to solve about people covering up a laboratory leak and whether or not that's plausible biology or not.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And what's not plausible about it is the the presumptive the presumptions that are required in order for this theory to work which is depicted by the green earth.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Before 2019 there was no SARS-CoV-2 and so therefore we were all vulnerable to it when it leaked from the laboratory and then it changed over the years as it went around the world until here we are in 2023 with yet another set of variants

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:33.000
of evidence in previous literature experience or recordings of tracking a coronavirus with this fidelity.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000
It's just absurd.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And this illusion of consensus has trapped most of us into thinking that there's a Scooby-Doo mystery to solve.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And while we solved that Scooby-Doo mystery of where is that virus come from and how they killed people with the protocols and then blamed it on the virus so that we kept believing that there was a mystery to solve.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.000
And so there are a lot of doctors who are guilty guilty of criminal negligence guilty of being stupid.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
That's what they are.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
That's what Doc Malek is saying now.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
That's what a lot of people need to really admit.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
They were dumb.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
That they believed that, you know,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000
intramuscularly injecting a child with 36 different things in its first two years of life is totally normal.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Because you didn't take the time to learn yourself the biology that they purport to base these schedules on.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Every nurse who didn't learn the biology and come to the conclusion that something was off his guilty guilty of negligence guilty of being dumb.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And they use fear, frustration, confusion in the beginning and they used an illusion of consensus to take advantage of people to scare them into being dumb.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And so we don't want to condemn any of these people.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
We want them to confess.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:23.000
We want them to seek with some remorse.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's what we want.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And then we welcome them home with open arms.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000
But these people have to admit that they made some pretty gigantic mistakes when it counted.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
When it was an emergency and they did not have principles.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
As Alexandra Smerino said so eloquently.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
It only matters when there's an emergency whether you have principles.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
That's when it counts.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And Brett Weinstein did not have principles when it counted.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:07.000
He did not have the biological knowledge or the forthright studious commitment to learning it.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
In order to save anybody meaningfully he didn't save a single college kid from taking the shot.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Not one.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I tried.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
But not one college kid was saved by any of these people on this screen.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Not one college kid was saved from taking a mandated vaccine on a campus by any of these people.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Not one even spoke out.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Richard Ebright tweeted in 2020 that if we open colleges this fall will kill a quarter million people by Christmas.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:50.000
A quarter million people would die on college campuses if we opened them said Richard Ebright and none of these people said anything.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
None of these people argued with him.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I think I tweeted I'll take that bet.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
That's what we're talking about here.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
This illusion of consensus didn't save a single college kid from getting this injection not one.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000
And every one of these people should be ashamed of themselves because every one of these people should have spoke out and said no we're not going to do that to these guys.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Come on.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Old people may be.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And we should of course not said maybe to the old people but I'm just trying to illustrate how ridiculous it is that none of these people stood up and said we shouldn't be transfecting college age children.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000
College age young adults should not be taking this shot to go back to campus.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
But colleges encourage the HPV shot as well.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Colleges encourage the RSV shot and the flu shot and masks and we just didn't speak out against them.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And so this illusion of consensus was really created on purpose.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's a faith in a novel virus and in order to beat it you've got to call the faith alive.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
You've got to call it what it is.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
It's a lie.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It's a lie about a background signal.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
It's a lie about fidelity.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
It's a lie about something.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And it's a criminal investigation so we better figure it out.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
You're going to call it in endemic background.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
That's fine.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And you want to think that they released infectious clones to make it really clean?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I think it's a really good bet.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
But it still doesn't change the fact that the protocols were murder.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
That's how they got this to happen and transfection is not medicine.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And none of these people spoke out usefully to save anybody from taking that shot.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
The ones that really, really needed saving.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000
You want to say that they released transfection agents or they're doing it right now and we're shedding and that's also a problem.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
That's totally okay with me too.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Protocols were murder, transfection isn't medicine.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
And none of those people saved any college kids.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
None of these people saved any college kids either.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:19.000
The reality is that maybe they did because they didn't believe in anything but these people didn't help us get out.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
If anything, they just made it harder for us to figure out what was going wrong.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:31.000
It's a conflated background signal of some kind and the faith in the novel virus is a lie.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
This is a lie.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And that's all you got to know.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:43.000
By looking at what they don't talk about, consistently don't talk about and consistently won't challenge, you can definitely see them for who they are.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.000
If they're making grand statements about what they did and what they role they played in it, but they've never mentioned any of this stuff, bingo.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:05.000
If they're selling a book that's focused on bio weapons or focused on one particular aspect of the pandemic, it's almost a bingo.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:19.000
If they have a sub stack where they started out on one single idea, like VAERS or one single idea, like a fear and cleavage site or one single idea.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
It's a pretty big red flag.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:36.000
If you didn't talk about natural immunity and in like the first two years of the pandemic, even though you were supposedly a biologist, this is, this is not acceptable.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Anybody that didn't roll up their sleeves and teach themselves immunology 101 in 2020 while they were supposed to be a pro biologist.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I'm sorry, but no.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Like what else was there to do?

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You have to get in shape, I guess.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:02.000
But I mean, if you wanted to figure your way out of this, if you really wanted to understand this so that you couldn't be lied to, there was only one answer.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Read every immunology book you could find, get rid of the contradictions, boil it down to the basics, make sure that you could confirm everything and whatever you can confirm.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:18.000
You better at least make sure that the people on TV at least acknowledge those principles and guess what? They didn't.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And they want your day to please stop transfections in humans full stop.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I'm sorry that this wasn't such a great stream, you know, but at least I was here.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
We're getting this streak going a little bit again, so we got to get the momentum.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
And so I'm practicing, practicing, practicing, staying under two hours, I guess, but that's not really a feat.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It would be nice if I could get this down to like 45 minutes, but I'm going to start cutting clips in the near future.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I'm going to go on peer tube as soon as Ted gets that done.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:01.000
We're going to start trying to have our own private streaming independent platform that also simultaneously streams to Twitch and maybe other places depending on what we can organize.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:08.000
So there's a lot of things in the works, and I hope that, how come that explosion doesn't go?

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
It cannot play media.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Something's wrong with my memory or something like that, I guess we're overloading here.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:26.000
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system of healthy humans, including transfection and transformation, is criminally negligent.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Thanks very much for joining me this evening.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I'm glad that all of you guys were here.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
This is Gigaohm Biological.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000
You can find me at GigaohmBiological.com and you can also wrap with me at gigaohm.bio.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
gigaohm.bio.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:46.000
It's probably going to be like stream . gigaohm.bio where we're going to set up the peer tube.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
More on that as it gets developed.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Boy, I need a drink and I need to go to bed.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:03.000
JFK was definitely killed by the bankers for Executive Order 110, which was when he started tying $5 bills to the silver standard, I believe.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Thanks very much for joining me, guys.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I'm going to see you again tomorrow.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I had a cancellation for a morning show, so it's going to probably be an afternoon show again tomorrow.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I'm hoping to get a special guest this week yet, but I don't want to announce his name in case it doesn't work out.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
We've got a couple in the barrel and otherwise we'll just do an impromptu stream like we did tonight.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Thank you very much. See you tomorrow.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Oh, I should have come over here.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
That was better.
