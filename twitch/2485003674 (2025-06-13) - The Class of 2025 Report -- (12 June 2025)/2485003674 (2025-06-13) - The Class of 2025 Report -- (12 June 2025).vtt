WEBVTT

00:23.396 --> 00:26.560
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.862
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

00:30.844 --> 00:31.585
Isolation, what was it?

00:31.765 --> 00:32.947
Isolation and purification.

00:34.709 --> 00:35.430
Of the virus?

00:35.530 --> 00:35.730
Yes.

00:36.971 --> 00:38.733
Well, you isolate a virus by

00:45.538 --> 00:48.001
finding the virus which causes a disease.

00:48.661 --> 00:53.526
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

00:54.327 --> 00:56.049
I don't understand what the issue is.

00:56.089 --> 00:56.249
I see.

00:56.269 --> 00:57.830
No, it depends on how they use it.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.925
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:13.025 --> 01:14.846
I mean, he actually isolated it.

01:15.206 --> 01:19.048
I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:19.108 --> 01:21.149
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:23.729 --> 03:23.929
Oh.

04:21.179 --> 04:32.788
Did you really want audio to that I didn't think you really wanted audio to that This This scam, did you see all the people in that video?

04:34.289 --> 04:49.200
Watch the list of people Tim Poole's handler Super clown making fun of AOC and also on Australian news all the time as an American thought leader Robert Malone

04:50.413 --> 04:51.774
Jill Glasspool Malone.

04:57.399 --> 04:58.880
And they're selling you t-shirts.

05:13.593 --> 05:15.454
Dom Lucra, he's real big on X.

05:16.963 --> 05:19.025
Nurse Erin, oh my gosh.

05:19.685 --> 05:22.447
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, we need to wake up fast.

05:24.128 --> 05:35.636
I recently visited Hiroshima in Japan and stood at the epicenter of a city that remains scarred by the unimaginable horror caused by a single nuclear bomb dropped in 1945, 80 years ago.

05:42.779 --> 05:51.615
It's hard for me to find the words to express what I saw, the stories that I heard, the haunting sadness that still remains.

05:51.715 --> 05:54.200
This is an experience that will stay with me forever.

05:56.445 --> 06:10.171
This attack obliterated the city, killed over 300,000 people, many dying instantly while others died from severe burns, injuries, radiation sickness, and cancer that set in in the following months and years.

06:11.191 --> 06:13.132
Nagasaki suffered the same fate.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.854
Homes, schools, families, all gone in a flash.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.376
The survivors... Just an interesting anecdote.

06:22.536 --> 06:23.797
In January of 2023,

06:26.388 --> 06:29.570
The following people were on stage together in Stockholm, Sweden.

06:30.371 --> 06:50.826
Sasha Latipova, the mother of Soph, Meryl Nass, super anthrax bio-expert, Robert Malone, multi-outbreak expert, bioethicist extraordinaire, and actually, you know, basically a disambiguation wizard.

06:52.186 --> 07:00.672
Aseem Malhotra, the guy who pushed mRNA until his dad died, and then that apparently woke him up to the truth of things.

07:01.813 --> 07:06.796
And finally, an interesting fellow by the name of Mike Palmer, who has an interesting book.

07:06.876 --> 07:11.359
Michael Palmer is a biochemist from Canada with German background.

07:12.260 --> 07:19.685
And he is the default leader of the Doctors for COVID Ethics, which actually split into two at some point.

07:20.509 --> 07:35.053
during the pandemic and became the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International with Stephen Frost, and then this group, Doctors for COVID Ethics, where I think Thomas Binder and Sukrit Bhakti hung out.

07:35.153 --> 07:38.654
But as soon as the two groups split, I basically didn't go with either of them.

07:40.315 --> 07:43.455
I got very frustrated with the idea and how it split.

07:43.516 --> 07:48.477
But one of the main reasons why it split was because Mike Palmer,

07:49.969 --> 08:02.238
Michael Palmer has a book on the internet about Hiroshima not being real, and that it was actually a large amount of TNT with some radioactive material, i.e.

08:02.298 --> 08:11.205
a dirty bomb, and some mustard gas to create the chemical burns, and they lied to you about it being a nuclear weapon.

08:14.422 --> 08:17.544
So essentially the the Manhattan Project is fake yada yada.

08:18.084 --> 08:37.993
And so then this dude by the name of Hodgkinson an old guy with glasses who's been on a lot of podcasts and he's kind of ornery and he taught you've seen him, but I've never I The guy drives me bananas, but he and Mike Palmer had an argument Because

08:39.636 --> 08:54.852
Hodgkinson said that Mike Palmer shouldn't be able to be the leader because we can't trust him because he has this stupid book on the internet archive that says there are no nukes and so that disqualifies him as an intellectual.

08:54.932 --> 08:55.853
Obviously he's an idiot.

08:56.693 --> 09:15.431
And so they basically made people choose about whether it was okay for Mike Palmer to have that book, it didn't matter because this is a pandemic now, or whether we should get out of here because Mike Palmer is a hardcore German guy who sticks to parliamentary procedure too much and needs to get off his high horse.

09:16.604 --> 09:17.925
That actually happened.

09:17.985 --> 09:20.086
I actually was there when it happened.

09:20.266 --> 09:22.148
And so it's curious, right?

09:22.208 --> 09:39.939
That, that now we're, remember, I'm just, you know, it's a random connection, but the dude, the one dude that was kind of sort of supposed to be responsible for the splitting of the group of the doctors for COVID ethics into two groups in 2021, I think, but I'd have to go look at my notebook again.

09:40.779 --> 09:58.143
And he has a book and that was the reason why the split happened and then that guy found himself on stage with Robert Malone a couple years later with Sasha Latipova and Meryl Nass and Haseem Malhotra who's now the scientific advisor for the Maha whatever.

09:59.143 --> 10:01.064
I mean, he can't make this up.

10:01.424 --> 10:05.725
He just got to realize that the patterns on the board are actually pretty relevant.

10:06.533 --> 10:17.655
And there's been so much effort to try and throw other patterns on the wall and other irrelevant connections on the wall when the obvious ones, they're just incriminating.

10:19.456 --> 10:20.696
Anyway, back to the show.

10:21.316 --> 10:29.518
The Hibakusha, they carried the pain of extreme burns, radiation sickness, and loss for decades.

10:32.239 --> 10:42.161
Survivors of this attack were asked to put in paintings and drawings their own memories and how they felt and what they saw.

10:42.361 --> 10:58.204
And those paintings and the suffering that they conveyed, the pain and the sense of loss were almost more powerful than the photos themselves.

10:59.588 --> 11:06.094
Yet this one bomb that caused so much destruction on Hiroshima was tiny compared to today's nuclear bombs.

11:06.895 --> 11:20.087
The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima had a yield of just 15 kilotons of TNT, whereas today's nuclear warheads range in size from 100 kilotons to over one megaton.

11:20.527 --> 11:24.471
A single nuclear weapon today could kill millions in just minutes.

11:25.291 --> 11:29.133
Just one of these nuclear bombs would vaporize everything at its core.

11:29.573 --> 11:32.034
People, buildings, life itself.

11:33.215 --> 11:38.257
The shockwave would crush structures miles away, killing and maiming countless people.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.759
And then comes the fallout.

11:41.259 --> 11:49.243
Radioactive poison spreading through the air, water and soil, condemning survivors to agonizing deaths or lifelong suffering.

11:50.194 --> 11:59.769
A nuclear winter could follow, with smoke and ash completely blocking the sun, plunging the world into darkness and cold, killing crops and starving billions.

12:00.811 --> 12:05.338
Acid rain would scar the Earth, wiping out entire ecosystems.

12:06.636 --> 12:09.458
This isn't some made-up science fiction story.

12:10.079 --> 12:14.462
This is the reality of what's at stake, what we are facing now.

12:14.542 --> 12:26.651
Because as we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers.

12:28.066 --> 12:37.319
Perhaps it's because they are confident that they will have access to nuclear shelters for themselves and for their families that regular people won't have access to.

12:38.801 --> 12:44.849
So it's up to us, the people, to speak up and demand an end to this madness.

12:46.087 --> 12:54.450
We must reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.891
Save the buildings, use neutron bombs.

13:10.854 --> 13:12.796
I don't think it's all funny, ladies and gentlemen.

13:12.816 --> 13:14.217
I don't think it's all funny at all.

13:14.257 --> 13:19.042
But sometimes, gosh, it's hard to hold on to it all the time.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.984
It's hard to hold on to it all the time.

13:21.004 --> 13:23.846
I don't care how you get there.

13:23.866 --> 13:26.549
I don't care what you do to get there.

13:26.569 --> 13:33.095
The goal is to win.

13:33.956 --> 13:34.877
What time is it?

13:34.957 --> 13:35.698
Game time!

13:35.798 --> 13:35.918
Woo!

13:50.800 --> 13:51.881
I had my volume down.

13:51.901 --> 13:53.202
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

13:53.262 --> 13:54.102
Welcome to the show.

13:54.122 --> 14:00.346
This is Giga Home Biological, high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

14:01.767 --> 14:04.248
I'm not really sure what to say, ladies and gentlemen.

14:05.129 --> 14:08.931
I don't want to suddenly become a physicist.

14:08.951 --> 14:11.813
I don't want to suddenly take sides on the nuke issue.

14:13.368 --> 14:27.513
I think nuclear war and nuclear weapons don't make a lot of sense from many different perspectives but I do think it makes a lot of sense for everybody to believe that there are bombs that are a hundred times the size of whatever was dropped in Hiroshima.

14:28.454 --> 14:35.036
I don't know what 50 kilotons of TNT looks like when it goes off and I definitely don't know how to tell the difference.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.677
I don't know if there are other ways to make strontium-90

14:40.738 --> 14:42.079
appear in people's teeth.

14:42.880 --> 14:50.647
All I know is that right now they can tell us whatever they want to tell us because everybody's using social media to learn and that's a very big mistake.

14:51.488 --> 14:55.091
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a, it's a myth.

14:55.391 --> 14:57.654
It's used, it's a biological myth.

14:57.714 --> 14:58.474
It's not to say

14:59.665 --> 15:12.916
that those conditions don't exist, but to rope them all together as one autism spectrum disorder is a mythology, and that is helping them to sustain this illusion.

15:13.817 --> 15:24.807
It's helping make sure that intramuscular ejection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as either a reason or an answer.

15:27.304 --> 15:31.048
and what you just experienced and we just experienced and my gosh.

15:32.034 --> 15:33.235
Talk about heartbreaking.

15:34.056 --> 15:44.645
What the class of 2025 experienced is this mythology in full force, and a bunch of adults who didn't understand the trap that they were in.

15:44.725 --> 15:46.866
They didn't understand why the cheese was free.

15:47.547 --> 15:56.855
They didn't understand why the iPads were free, and the Chromebooks were free, and the pandemic's funding was free, and all this stuff.

15:56.875 --> 15:57.916
They didn't understand it.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.640
And that's why they're still in the trap now, but it was really heartbreaking.

16:03.161 --> 16:14.745
Yesterday, I had the privilege of going to a high school graduation ceremony at Bethel Park High School in the south region of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:14.865 --> 16:16.185
Pittsburgh is a pretty big place.

16:19.406 --> 16:27.828
The population is spread out much beyond Pittsburgh's borders and in the south part of the map is where I live.

16:28.348 --> 16:29.949
Wow, I really ran out the music there.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.309
Hold on.

16:33.090 --> 16:38.631
The south part of Pittsburgh is where I live and a lot of hills out here.

16:41.549 --> 16:47.610
And this is actually the school district and the high school where Matthew Crooks went to school.

16:48.231 --> 16:58.813
Matthew Crooks is the boy that was found on the roof in Butler, Pennsylvania and blamed for the shooting of the ear of Donald Trump.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.034
I don't even remember when that was.

17:01.094 --> 17:01.554
I guess it was 2024.

17:05.601 --> 17:07.765
Or maybe it was I don't know was it 23.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.688
Can somebody tell me what that date was?

17:11.610 --> 17:15.494
Anyway, if you're here for a while, you are here at the top of the wave.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.975
I'm not saying you're not getting wet.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.476
I'm not saying you're not going to drink.

17:19.677 --> 17:23.081
I'm just saying that you're here at the top of the wave trying to stay above water.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.223
And if you're not, you're here for the first time.

17:26.264 --> 17:27.465
July 13th, when?

17:27.845 --> 17:28.345
Last year?

17:30.267 --> 17:32.629
You need to stay focused on the Violet 24.

17:32.689 --> 17:33.911
Thank you very much.

17:33.971 --> 17:36.293
Don't take their bait and love your neighbor.

17:38.706 --> 17:41.508
I guess maybe then he graduated in 2022.

17:41.609 --> 17:42.549
That might be the thing.

17:42.609 --> 17:44.891
So he was a recent graduate of the high school.

17:46.112 --> 17:48.134
And so, yes, this is Jonathan Cooley.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.716
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania right now.

17:50.976 --> 17:57.082
And I'll just segue into that little explanation and then we'll go on to the work of the day.

17:57.142 --> 18:01.485
I got to get done quick because my kids are home from school.

18:02.566 --> 18:04.048
And that changes everything.

18:04.108 --> 18:09.936
Don't forget I've got this YouTube channel called JC on a Bike where you can see the very first videos I made as a YouTuber.

18:10.717 --> 18:18.227
Naively thinking I was about to boost my higher ability as a college, you know...

18:18.707 --> 18:21.770
Professor Sort Guy by making a YouTube channel.

18:22.431 --> 18:25.113
Boy, was that a... that was a big mistake.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.876
Anyway, or at least it turned out not the way I planned.

18:28.136 --> 18:30.338
I'm now streaming live on JC in the Woods.

18:31.239 --> 18:35.103
You can find that at j.c.inthewoods.

18:35.423 --> 18:39.667
All one thing, or with the spaces you should be able to find it on YouTube.

18:41.268 --> 18:42.829
You know that I helped with that book.

18:42.849 --> 18:44.549
You know that I'm friends with Jayanta.

18:45.570 --> 18:48.411
And you know that this work is supported by you.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.291
Otherwise, you probably wouldn't be here.

18:51.051 --> 18:55.933
But if you are here for the first time, you can go to GigaOMBiological.com and find out what this is all about.

18:57.134 --> 19:00.095
See an archive of old videos all the way back to 2021.

19:00.235 --> 19:07.197
And you can download some of the stuff we're reading at the link stuff if you want to catch up.

19:07.257 --> 19:09.838
That won't be very hard because I'm a little behind myself.

19:10.738 --> 19:20.846
And if you really want to know how far behind you are, if you've never heard of Housatonic ITS and Mark Kulak out of Boston, Massachusetts, then I'm afraid you're very, very far behind.

19:21.546 --> 19:28.071
And so check him out, follow him on all those platforms, so all those platforms think he's cool.

19:29.052 --> 19:30.613
This is the Independent Bright Web.

19:31.634 --> 19:36.938
What that basically means is I'm more or less a one-man show, provided you accept the fact that I have a

19:38.299 --> 19:44.266
a family of five and they helped me out a lot with emotional and physical support.

19:46.669 --> 19:50.153
They are a great reason why I'm here.

19:51.134 --> 19:52.376
In fact, I think you could

19:54.229 --> 20:00.034
You could say they're the only reason why I'm here, and I don't think that's crazy.

20:00.154 --> 20:04.158
Don't forget that you are probably under the spell of a team of performers.

20:04.218 --> 20:08.582
If you're still using social media actively, you have been fooled.

20:08.882 --> 20:14.066
And the way that you were fooled with regard to the pandemic was that there was a giant biological signal

20:14.807 --> 20:21.972
A big train was gonna come into the station, and you have been fooled into believing that you need to help stop it.

20:22.532 --> 20:26.095
And you were fooled by, like, a hundred thousand people on internet.

20:26.735 --> 20:34.641
Fake accounts, real accounts, and their bots, into thinking that you had to help slow the train, and then you had to help get it started again.

20:34.661 --> 20:37.483
That's basically the pandemic, all in a nutshell.

20:38.263 --> 20:44.987
And Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass, these people were all part of that show.

20:45.047 --> 20:51.390
And many of these people were actually put in place, many of these people were put in place years before the pandemic.

20:51.830 --> 21:07.019
With the specific design of them being there to slow walk us through this mystery solving exercise where we think that the most likely result is that the pandemic is due to a lab leak, that we responded with a

21:08.059 --> 21:22.477
a ham-fisted response that it resulted in even more death especially in America and then in the end we ended up transfecting people and it worked but it would have worked a hell of a lot better had it not been contaminated with DNA and that's

21:23.493 --> 21:24.753
That's basically where we are.

21:25.094 --> 21:33.696
I mean, we've gotten here with such a smooth, you know, all the way guided, unfortunately, by a guy like Kevin McKernan.

21:34.417 --> 21:41.159
He's been there from the very beginning, crazily enough, podcasting with a guy who used to work for the World Bank.

21:42.725 --> 21:44.826
Anyway, that was 2025.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.287
This thing we watched yesterday.

21:46.307 --> 21:47.068
It was really good.

21:47.148 --> 21:49.129
I think it's worth watching again with you.

21:49.570 --> 21:50.830
If you haven't seen it, check it out.

21:51.371 --> 21:57.695
And then I've been kind of drawing attention to Mary Bowden, thinking that she might be an unwitting participant.

21:58.716 --> 22:04.360
Kind of hopefully thinking that, but she's been on too many podcasts with too many long con kind of people.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.963
This guy's been playing the same stunt man for a very long time.

22:08.983 --> 22:11.224
And so on and so on.

22:14.086 --> 22:18.707
And again, I've been focused on Mary Talley Bowden because I thought maybe she's a good guy.

22:18.867 --> 22:37.454
And I've been waiting for somebody to do the research, somebody to, you know, really realize that even on my archived link on my YouTube, or am I sorry, on my website that I just showed you, there is an interview with Mary Talley Bowden and myself from July of 2022.

22:39.739 --> 22:48.583
And if any of you had the wherewithal to find it, or if you saw it that I posted it yesterday on my peer tube, only like 40 people watch it.

22:48.603 --> 22:50.243
So I guess not very many people saw it.

22:50.283 --> 22:58.327
But that video, in my opinion, I think my money is on the fact that what we're going to hear is a script.

22:58.407 --> 23:00.687
And I think I'm going to be able to teach off of it.

23:00.747 --> 23:09.071
I think I'm going to be able to show you or reason why it is a script and not just what a doctor would say.

23:09.980 --> 23:16.825
Now that's what I think is so cool about having these kinds of snapshots and then also kind of analyzing them live.

23:16.925 --> 23:17.846
I put it up there.

23:17.866 --> 23:20.328
I haven't seen all of it.

23:20.448 --> 23:27.433
I've seen some bits of it and I've sampled like three separate time points long enough to understand that I'm pretty sure

23:28.922 --> 23:30.384
I'm pretty sure there's a theme here.

23:30.484 --> 23:33.869
So I'm going to share this with you together at the same time.

23:33.929 --> 23:34.770
I'll take some notes.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.592
We'll talk about it if we have to pause it.

23:37.794 --> 23:40.497
But I think we should just get on with it.

23:41.999 --> 23:42.580
This is me.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.361
I'll just let it run.

23:44.906 --> 23:46.146
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

23:46.606 --> 23:47.887
Another special brief for you.

23:47.987 --> 23:51.047
I do have the throat at that time already.

23:51.507 --> 23:54.508
And so he'll have to tolerate the frog throat from me.

23:54.568 --> 24:05.009
But I'm going to put myself super tiny down in the bottom because this was when I was in my bedroom still at my old address that people posted Zillow pictures of and stuff a few years ago.

24:05.490 --> 24:09.070
And I still have the same exact microphone setup.

24:09.110 --> 24:09.750
It's right there.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.811
It's just that you can't see it anymore because I got better with photography.

24:14.825 --> 24:21.529
I don't know what the point is of showing a big giant microphone unless you really need it there because that's how far away you have to be from the microphone.

24:21.949 --> 24:27.212
You can also choose a microphone that doesn't need you so close and then you basically almost get the same results.

24:27.792 --> 24:35.177
But you know, it looks cool if you have a big old sure $300 microphone in front of you or $800 microphone in front of you.

24:35.817 --> 24:38.719
How I remember that, that Banksy thing, that's cool.

24:39.639 --> 24:42.441
I'm gonna make myself a little bit tinier.

24:43.697 --> 24:46.019
Let's see, I might have to fast forward this a little bit.

24:46.279 --> 24:48.080
Hopefully this will be a very sharp stream.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.161
I hope I don't make a fool of myself.

24:50.862 --> 24:53.363
Wow, see how humble I was in 2022?

24:54.284 --> 24:57.226
I was just trying to catch up with these people.

24:58.406 --> 24:59.667
Could be worse, I guess.

24:59.827 --> 25:01.288
Oh, I gotta be a little soft.

25:02.349 --> 25:04.210
I gotta put myself a little smaller.

25:07.032 --> 25:08.233
Because we have a guest.

25:09.474 --> 25:09.874
Yes.

25:11.075 --> 25:11.475
A guest.

25:13.806 --> 25:16.890
We have a guest tonight to this afternoon.

25:16.930 --> 25:18.732
That's why I'm on early, Harold Zoid.

25:18.792 --> 25:19.773
Thank you for noticing.

25:20.354 --> 25:25.420
We have a guest tonight, or this afternoon, Dr. Mary Talley Bowden.

25:26.541 --> 25:28.543
And I hope to have her on in a few minutes.

25:28.563 --> 25:29.745
Oh, I got to get that slide out.

25:29.765 --> 25:30.666
Wow, that's funny.

25:30.806 --> 25:33.409
At which case, I don't remember how I made that.

25:35.373 --> 25:35.954
That's funny.

25:36.294 --> 25:38.696
I must have found a web tool or something that did that.

25:38.716 --> 25:40.157
It looks pretty low resolution.

25:40.197 --> 25:42.639
I probably just pirated something off the internet.

25:43.660 --> 25:43.880
Funny.

25:44.481 --> 25:44.701
Sure.

25:44.741 --> 25:45.161
Why not?

25:45.602 --> 25:45.982
That one.

25:47.704 --> 25:49.005
I might just click forward.

25:49.025 --> 25:52.868
I don't want to waste too much time with this starting part here.

25:52.908 --> 25:53.068
OK.

25:53.308 --> 25:53.609
Don't.

25:54.589 --> 25:54.870
Oh, yeah.

25:54.890 --> 25:55.150
First.

25:55.470 --> 25:55.750
Sorry.

25:57.838 --> 25:57.958
of a

26:11.047 --> 26:22.235
So what we're listening for is a doctor who doesn't know everything, but apparently went against the grain and started treating people, lost her job.

26:22.776 --> 26:32.043
And then what I'm going to be listening for and what I want to coach you to listen for are the details of her biological model of what's actually happening.

26:33.058 --> 26:48.312
and where the details are missing and where there's kind of a, yeah, the X, Y, and Z. If you hear a lot of this X, Y, and Z stuff that wouldn't really make sense from a pre-pandemic perspective, I'm gonna stop it and we'll work it out a little bit.

26:48.452 --> 26:52.516
Joining me, I'm actually talking to you over there, but then I'm streaming you over there.

26:52.576 --> 26:53.937
So that's why it looks a little funny.

26:56.339 --> 26:58.661
Oh, no, I'm extremely excited to talk to you.

26:59.989 --> 27:02.191
So I tried to preface it a little bit.

27:02.231 --> 27:03.612
We haven't met until right now.

27:04.192 --> 27:07.735
But because everybody's got so little time, I think it's just important to get it out there.

27:08.636 --> 27:14.520
I have a stream that I've been doing for about two years where we talk about immunology and we've talked about the coronavirus for two years straight.

27:15.561 --> 27:17.322
We do journal clubs and everything else.

27:17.382 --> 27:18.503
And so we're very much on.

27:19.198 --> 27:23.880
the page of real biology and immunology and that it's not as simple as antibodies.

27:24.921 --> 27:32.024
And so you're the first MD that we've ever had on that can come on and tell us about how this actually unfolded.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.986
So I don't know if that's too much to ask, but

27:35.786 --> 27:49.729
For me, I would love to hear the story of how you went from getting the bulletin that there is some unknown pathogen that's coming our way to realizing that something was horribly wrong.

27:50.429 --> 27:56.791
And then now you're here in some people's book a hero and other people's book a pariah.

27:56.891 --> 28:03.673
And so I just want to give you the floor and let you go to town and then maybe ask some questions, but I don't need to say anything.

28:05.762 --> 28:06.723
Well, thank you.

28:07.583 --> 28:12.247
So, I'm a nursing and sleep medicine physician.

28:12.687 --> 28:14.048
I work in Houston, Texas.

28:15.109 --> 28:17.111
I did my residency at Stanford.

28:17.691 --> 28:19.333
So I already see her looking down.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.593
Now that could be nothing.

28:20.613 --> 28:24.957
It just depends on how you would put your notes.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.219
But if you don't want to be seen,

28:28.328 --> 28:33.270
Then you need to put the notes in places where they are visible, but they don't need to be moved.

28:33.350 --> 28:35.391
And they don't need to be turned or turned up.

28:35.451 --> 28:37.052
Maybe turning over is okay.

28:37.892 --> 28:39.173
So watch for that kind of stuff.

28:40.673 --> 28:44.255
I'm just telling you that because... Which one am I using?

28:44.275 --> 28:45.335
I guess I'm using that one.

28:46.236 --> 28:54.819
I'm just telling you that because, you know, with this camera I could... I can show you... How should I best do that so I can set it back up?

28:54.879 --> 28:56.140
Well, I can... I mean...

28:57.526 --> 29:00.007
this camera could, I could take that off, I guess.

29:00.107 --> 29:08.070
I don't, I don't, it's, it's just that I don't, I don't ever have, I don't ever have any notes.

29:09.470 --> 29:16.392
Um, the notes for me, the, the, or maybe the slides, the slides don't even have notes.

29:16.472 --> 29:18.253
So what I see is what you see.

29:18.273 --> 29:26.656
Um, the rest is just because I've done a lot of work, um, probably worked as hard, um, in the last five years.

29:28.601 --> 29:36.985
as I've ever worked in my life, mostly because it was a labor of desperation.

29:40.226 --> 29:55.834
I mean, I've read more pages of stuff in the last five years than I probably read in my entire professional career before that, simply because in reading of

29:56.972 --> 30:05.463
of academic biology, so much of what you read meets your expectations and so you can read it very fast and process it very quickly.

30:06.364 --> 30:12.411
And reading during the pandemic was a very slow and deliberate process.

30:13.766 --> 30:32.641
and a double checking and keeping things straight and also trying to dismiss a bunch of things that more and more have become clear to me are kind of irrelevant concepts that are designed to complicate things that don't need to be complicated because that complication implies understanding that isn't there.

30:34.022 --> 30:35.263
You know, if, if, uh,

30:36.843 --> 30:43.905
If you know all the names of all the cars on the road, you can imply a bunch of mastery.

30:43.945 --> 30:46.206
Oh, that's a Cadillac DeVille.

30:46.226 --> 30:47.706
Oh, that's a this, that, and the other.

30:47.766 --> 30:57.289
And somebody might assume that your knowledge of cars and their mechanics and whatever is just complete at the mastery level, whereas you could be a fool

30:58.149 --> 31:08.379
when it comes to the actual maintenance of an automobile and your advice on when to change the oil or what tire pressure to run at would be absurd to follow.

31:09.540 --> 31:20.110
But you could create quite a ruse with the detailed knowledge of the year and model and number of colors that came in in that year.

31:21.127 --> 31:22.931
you could really impress somebody.

31:22.971 --> 31:27.620
And then when you said, yeah, but you shouldn't change the oil in that car, except for every 10,000 miles.

31:27.660 --> 31:29.002
And then you shouldn't use synthetic.

31:29.483 --> 31:31.327
They might say, wow, he knows everything.

31:32.768 --> 31:36.551
And I think there's a lot of academic biology that ends up to be that way.

31:36.711 --> 31:46.879
A lot of academic biology ends up to be that there's almost an incentive to create the illusion that you're working on something that is separate and different from everything else.

31:46.939 --> 31:55.206
And then it's almost in your best interest to find as many things that set your work apart from everybody else's as possible.

31:55.986 --> 32:01.651
And as a consequence, we've created a lot of dead ends that are just imaginary.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.269
What did I come over for this slide for?

32:04.329 --> 32:06.589
I was gonna use that camera, but I guess I decided not to.

32:06.669 --> 32:07.670
Okay, back to Mary.

32:08.670 --> 32:14.832
I moved to Houston after residency and I worked at a little small private ENT practice.

32:16.232 --> 32:23.615
I ended up having four boys in five years, so I took a big chunk of time off because I had to attend to them.

32:24.864 --> 32:35.948
And then six months before the pandemic hit, I had opened up a new practice that it was different in that it's called direct specialty care.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.989
I'm not contracted with any insurance companies.

32:39.049 --> 32:40.690
I'm not contracted with the government.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.651
I'm not, no relationship with pharmaceutical companies.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.272
I'm just working for my patients.

32:47.222 --> 32:54.247
So I start this, you know, I see a lot of respiratory tract infections as an ENT doctor, and I had patients asking me how to get tested.

32:55.028 --> 32:58.110
And one of the tools I was- So she's not looking everywhere.

32:58.330 --> 33:01.092
See, she only looks down here where I'm sitting now.

33:01.172 --> 33:05.035
And if, and that's the most important thing.

33:05.455 --> 33:09.919
If she keeps looking down here through the whole hour, that would be fine.

33:09.959 --> 33:11.220
But if she looks down here,

33:12.321 --> 33:20.310
tell a certain time point when she starts to look over to the other side or look up or something like that, then it might be a little strange.

33:20.330 --> 33:28.639
I was using for patients with chronic sinusitis was a PCR test for bacterial infections in the sinuses.

33:29.540 --> 33:33.304
And the company that was doing these PCR tests,

33:34.175 --> 33:37.638
pivoted and started a saliva test for COVID.

33:38.638 --> 33:47.986
And my practice is located in a strip center on purpose because I wanted to make it easy in and out, no parking garages to deal with.

33:48.786 --> 33:58.614
Now PCR testing for bacteria could in theory be a much more high resolution thing for which PCR could be used.

34:03.453 --> 34:08.538
And depending on how it's deployed, it could have been a much higher resolution kind of test.

34:09.159 --> 34:16.767
She didn't tell us the details of the test, but she did tell us that the company that started COVID testing was also

34:17.984 --> 34:20.586
previously doing PCR testing in bacteria.

34:20.606 --> 34:29.894
That's an interesting story because I don't know how many companies in Texas would have been doing testing of bacteria by PCR at the start of the pandemic.

34:29.914 --> 34:31.315
We might need to go back a little bit.

34:31.335 --> 34:43.025
So when the saliva test came by, it was actually, I had opened up a new practice that it was different in that it's called direct specialty care.

34:43.769 --> 34:46.190
I'm not contracted with any insurance companies.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.871
I'm not contracted with the government.

34:48.732 --> 34:52.714
So did she, she knew already right away to open up her own practice.

34:52.854 --> 34:57.737
I thought she lost her job at a hospital or something like that, but maybe this isn't the same lady.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.739
So I didn't hear anything, but did you hear anything about losing her job?

35:01.899 --> 35:02.960
I darn it.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.040
Did I blow something there?

35:06.662 --> 35:06.982
Hold on.

35:07.022 --> 35:07.402
Let me see.

35:09.023 --> 35:09.283
Okay.

35:09.463 --> 35:10.204
Let's just run it.

35:11.044 --> 35:11.384
Sorry.

35:11.544 --> 35:12.565
I'll just keep taking notes.

35:12.990 --> 35:16.051
I'm not, no relationship with pharmaceutical companies.

35:16.131 --> 35:17.711
I'm just working for my patients.

35:18.612 --> 35:25.634
So I start this, you know, I see a lot of respiratory tract infections as an ENT doctor, and I had patients asking me how to get tested.

35:26.434 --> 35:34.977
And one of the tools I was using for patients with chronic sinusitis was a PCR test for bacterial infections in the sinuses.

35:35.857 --> 35:39.618
And the company that was doing these PCR tests

35:40.506 --> 35:43.968
pivoted and started a saliva test for COVID.

35:44.969 --> 35:54.315
And my practice is located in a strip center on purpose because I wanted to make it easy in and out, no parking garages to deal with.

35:55.116 --> 36:03.822
So when the saliva test came by, it was actually ideal because patients could just go to their car, spit in a cup, leave it outside our door, and it was contact free.

36:04.864 --> 36:20.854
Well, I was one of the only people in our area that was able to provide 24 to 48 hour turnaround time for COVID tests early on when it was just a. So that's interesting because Ryan Cole is also very, very lucky.

36:21.781 --> 36:30.050
to be one of these guys who was early in adapting and getting it, you know, being able to have the infrastructure to do it.

36:30.150 --> 36:31.571
She's, you know, lucky enough.

36:31.691 --> 36:34.054
She had it in a mall and ready to go.

36:34.074 --> 36:36.356
I'm not really sure.

36:36.376 --> 36:43.003
I'm not going to develop an opinion yet, but this already easy in and out.

36:45.888 --> 36:48.931
It's not like she's not advertising for herself, right?

36:48.971 --> 36:51.934
It's almost like, you know, I don't work for anybody.

36:51.994 --> 36:53.095
I work for my patients.

36:53.235 --> 37:03.384
As an ENT doctor, she was treating chronic sinus infections using bacterial PCR tests, which might be a very legitimate way to figure out which

37:04.352 --> 37:11.798
which antibiotic would be appropriate and maybe whether there's one kind of bacteria or another kind of bacteria.

37:11.838 --> 37:25.390
And it's very plausible that that kind of thing would work because bacterial infections, if they're relatively homogenous, will have a pretty, I think, a pretty homogenous genetic background signal that could be tapped for that.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.071
I don't think that's implausible.

37:28.172 --> 37:31.913
show from, you know, LabCorp got completely overwhelmed.

37:32.613 --> 37:36.354
And then they ran out of the swabs, they ran out of supplies.

37:36.814 --> 37:45.797
So I was one of the few places where... So she's one of the few people who's able to testify to exactly how this didn't work, and that didn't work, and they ran out of this.

37:48.325 --> 37:52.088
And so it's not that she's talking about the respiratory disease yet.

37:52.148 --> 37:55.450
She's not talking about why she thought it was a new disease yet.

37:56.051 --> 38:01.214
She's just talking about the logistics of the failure, why she was an exception to the rule.

38:02.615 --> 38:04.757
Okay, just keep in mind, that's what's happening here.

38:04.837 --> 38:09.200
You could get a COVID results back in 24 to 48 hours.

38:09.280 --> 38:15.064
So my practice just exploded into this COVID testing center just,

38:16.235 --> 38:16.756
overnight.

38:17.416 --> 38:22.141
And then, you know, then I had all these patients coming to me saying my primary care doctor won't see me.

38:22.321 --> 38:26.606
You know, they test positive for COVID and I'm like, well, go see your primary care doctor.

38:26.626 --> 38:30.730
They're like, well, my primary care doctor has closed their clinic and refusing to see me.

38:31.290 --> 38:35.254
Or my primary care doctor says, well, just stay home and there's nothing you can do.

38:36.195 --> 38:47.440
Well, that didn't really sit well with me, and I started doing breathing treatments, and I put patients in their cars and used portable nebulizers and had them do breathing treatments in their cars.

38:48.321 --> 38:58.626
And then I just started researching more and more about what could be done with these patients, and I'm only an outpatient doctor, so my goal was to keep people out of the hospital.

38:59.466 --> 39:03.194
So I started learning about Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine.

39:03.735 --> 39:06.541
When monoclonal antibodies were available, I provided those.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.998
And now my practice has evolved into the next best thing to the hospital.

39:11.338 --> 39:15.301
She provided monoclonal antibodies, and that means she's an outpatient place.

39:15.341 --> 39:17.803
I guess you can give IV at an outpatient place, though.

39:17.843 --> 39:18.543
I guess that's true.

39:18.603 --> 39:20.945
Because patients are so scared to go to the hospital.

39:20.965 --> 39:25.589
So I have people walking into my clinic with oxygen saturations in the low 80s.

39:26.890 --> 39:28.611
It's interesting, though.

39:28.651 --> 39:31.213
I mean, it's an interesting thing to drop.

39:32.415 --> 39:36.077
It's almost like checking a box because, you know, you'd want to be specific.

39:36.177 --> 39:44.461
For a while, we were able to get Regeneron and then we tried, you know, because there is a little more than just when antibodies were available.

39:44.981 --> 39:49.784
I got to listen to that again because antibodies, are we talking about monoclonal antibodies?

39:49.804 --> 39:55.307
Are we talking about the serum of people who have recovered?

39:55.347 --> 39:55.827
I don't know which.

39:56.449 --> 39:59.351
because I have been able to help them and keep them out.

39:59.992 --> 40:06.577
My practice just exploded into this COVID testing center just overnight.

40:07.217 --> 40:11.941
And then, you know, then I had all these patients coming to me saying my primary care doctor won't see me.

40:12.121 --> 40:16.564
You know, they test positive for COVID and I'm like, well, go see your primary care doctor.

40:16.604 --> 40:20.527
Like, well, my primary care doctor has closed their clinic and refusing to see me.

40:21.087 --> 40:25.050
Or my primary care doctor says, well, just stay home and there's nothing you can do.

40:25.991 --> 40:37.209
Well, that didn't really sit well for me with me and I started doing breathing treatments and I put patients in their cars and use portable nebulizers and have them do breathing treatments in their cars.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.662
And then I just started researching more and more about what could be done with these patients.

40:43.362 --> 40:45.543
And I'm only an outpatient doctor.

40:45.663 --> 40:48.484
So my goal was to keep people out of the hospital.

40:49.285 --> 40:53.026
So I started learning about ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine.

40:53.547 --> 40:56.348
When monoclonal antibodies were available, I provided those.

40:57.287 --> 41:03.191
And now my practice has evolved into the next best thing to the hospital because patients are so scared to go to the hospital.

41:03.251 --> 41:08.814
So I have people walking into my clinic with oxygen saturations in the low 80s.

41:08.974 --> 41:13.537
But it's very cool because I have been able to help them and keep them out of the hospital.

41:13.758 --> 41:21.182
Whereas prior to the pandemic, if somebody came into my office without oxygen level, I would have called in the ambulance.

41:22.623 --> 41:35.929
One thing that is interesting that we've learned from this pandemic is the concept of permissive hypoxemia, where you can let somebody, basically you let their oxygen level go at a lower level than you thought possible.

41:36.169 --> 41:41.452
Like earlier, you know, if somebody came to the ER with an oxygen saturation of 82%, they would have been intubated.

41:42.381 --> 41:44.043
Now I'm able to treat it.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.745
I basically give them high-dose steroids.

41:46.785 --> 41:48.046
I give them IV antibiotics.

41:48.106 --> 41:52.110
I give them high-dose vitamin C. I give them IV pepsin.

41:52.150 --> 41:55.112
I give them glutathione, B12, B-complex.

41:55.593 --> 41:58.455
I give them a brief... I mean, this is impossible.

41:59.356 --> 42:04.301
The uniformity of this script right here is impossible.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.511
Um, because it's actually titrating.

42:07.571 --> 42:09.713
This is July of 2022.

42:09.913 --> 42:17.480
So she's trying to imply a progression of understanding that at the beginning of the pandemic, we didn't get it at the beginning of the pandemic.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.343
We were doing this, but now we understand that it can be this way.

42:20.383 --> 42:22.965
So I send them to their car with a nebulizer.

42:22.985 --> 42:25.207
I, I get, Oh my gosh.

42:25.667 --> 42:26.448
Oh my gosh.

42:26.568 --> 42:27.249
Come on now.

42:30.894 --> 42:33.316
Unless it's her true experience.

42:33.577 --> 42:36.940
I mean, you can say that about each and every one of these people.

42:37.961 --> 42:39.582
You can say that about Robert Malone.

42:39.602 --> 42:41.324
What if it's his true experience?

42:42.425 --> 42:44.066
You can say that about Meryl Nass.

42:45.408 --> 42:47.570
Or Stephen Hadfield.

42:49.343 --> 42:56.307
What we've got to do is start making decisions about things and having people come forward and talk to us again.

42:56.987 --> 43:02.350
This is a very, very interesting set of words here.

43:05.632 --> 43:06.673
Just put it that way.

43:06.713 --> 43:08.734
It's a very interesting set of words.

43:08.814 --> 43:15.457
It's not to me as spontaneous and convincing of spontaneity as I had hoped.

43:16.926 --> 43:22.509
When you say that they would have been intubated, do you mean that as a general treatment or since COVID?

43:24.149 --> 43:27.491
No, I think prior to, well, probably both.

43:27.851 --> 43:38.556
I mean, we're supposed to remember one of the things we have to accept is that she just happened to open a independent clinic as an ENT doctor.

43:40.160 --> 43:52.850
at the pandemic and just happened to stumble into a must have been very lucrative business of testing people for COVID and perpetuating the narrative that it could be tested for.

43:52.910 --> 43:59.896
Now, she may be an unwitting participant and just have been recruited, given the opportunity to do it.

43:59.936 --> 44:00.877
Hey, this is coming.

44:00.957 --> 44:02.838
So if you wanna get ahead of it, this is the tip.

44:03.459 --> 44:06.581
You know, like an insider trading tip when you don't even know why.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.404
Buy Inovio, sell Inovio.

44:13.618 --> 44:16.479
It could be, I mean, we could say that it's possible.

44:17.399 --> 44:30.024
But I guess what I'm saying is if somebody came to the emergency room at oxygen saturation at 82%, I mean, they wouldn't have been immediately intubated, but let's just assume that you got them on oxygen and they couldn't get above 90, which they probably can't.

44:31.564 --> 44:32.884
Why would you intubate them?

44:32.965 --> 44:34.885
Why is intubating them better?

44:35.545 --> 44:37.046
I don't understand that at all.

44:38.539 --> 44:40.280
It's very, very interesting.

44:40.340 --> 44:48.705
It's really like they're trying to edit out the possibility that first they would be given supplementary oxygen, because that's what Kyle Seidel said they did.

44:49.105 --> 44:51.326
That's what Pierre Kory said they did.

44:52.627 --> 44:59.751
Without doing some interventions, that would have been grounds for intubating most patients, right?

45:00.031 --> 45:02.933
And now we realize, I mean, I'm sending these patients.

45:02.973 --> 45:04.033
Why does she say, right?

45:04.154 --> 45:04.994
I'm not a doctor.

45:05.154 --> 45:06.315
Well, how the hell would I know?

45:07.372 --> 45:12.155
As far as I understand, you're only supposed to intubate somebody when their chest has been crushed.

45:12.315 --> 45:22.361
As long as they can, you know, show some improvement and they're not acutely short of breath, I'm able to send them home and then they come back the next day if needed and get more of the same.

45:23.402 --> 45:27.004
But that's very, I think that's an interesting development from

45:27.654 --> 45:28.114
COVID.

45:28.274 --> 45:29.335
I mean, at least I've learned that.

45:29.415 --> 45:42.745
I don't know if the people in the hospital learn that, but I think the other, the other interesting thing is, um, that we can treat viruses because prior to the pandemic, I mean, like most doctors, I didn't think there was anything you could do for COVID.

45:42.945 --> 45:44.546
I mean, I just figured it's a virus.

45:44.726 --> 45:45.647
There's nothing you can do.

45:45.667 --> 45:47.949
What in the hell does that even mean?

45:48.109 --> 45:48.969
Holy crap.

45:50.210 --> 45:52.932
Before the pandemic, it's a virus.

45:53.092 --> 45:53.733
What can you do?

45:57.042 --> 45:58.424
Did doctors think that way?

45:58.525 --> 45:59.907
Is that how the flow chart goes?

46:00.027 --> 46:02.852
If virus yes, what can you do?

46:03.713 --> 46:05.096
Is that what they teach in med school?

46:08.891 --> 46:10.252
This is not possible.

46:10.672 --> 46:12.274
That line is not possible.

46:12.334 --> 46:14.456
I'm sorry, that's scripted as shit.

46:15.136 --> 46:16.998
There's nobody, nobody says that.

46:17.278 --> 46:18.639
Nobody says that.

46:19.239 --> 46:20.621
No way, no way.

46:21.281 --> 46:26.165
I'm able to send them home and then they come back the next day if needed and get more of the same.

46:27.206 --> 46:30.809
But that's very, I think that's an interesting development from

46:31.782 --> 46:33.142
I mean, at least I've learned that.

46:33.202 --> 46:46.525
I don't know if the people in the hospital have learned that, but I think the other interesting thing is that we can treat viruses because prior to the pandemic, I mean, like most doctors, I didn't think there was anything you could do for COVID.

46:46.725 --> 46:48.345
I mean, I just figured it's a virus.

46:48.505 --> 46:49.446
There's nothing you can do.

46:49.466 --> 46:50.606
We can't give them antibiotics.

46:52.266 --> 46:53.847
And I- And that murdered people.

46:55.387 --> 47:00.588
Don't you see that murdered people because you blamed a syndrome

47:01.952 --> 47:10.755
on a virus and then ruled out antibiotics for all subsequent symptoms, no matter what was developed, including pneumonia.

47:11.176 --> 47:14.857
We've talked about viral pneumonia for like three or four years now.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.478
She needs to clear that up, right?

47:16.518 --> 47:18.638
That there is no such thing as a viral pneumonia.

47:18.678 --> 47:19.819
Will she do that or not?

47:21.379 --> 47:29.283
I've just loved how now I've realized, yeah, you can manage somebody with a virus, um, which is a new development.

47:29.303 --> 47:30.303
So,

47:31.713 --> 47:33.575
And did you... It's a new development.

47:34.976 --> 47:35.196
Yep.

47:35.636 --> 47:36.918
So it's a new development.

47:37.718 --> 47:44.524
Before the pandemic, most doctors just didn't think you could treat viruses, but now it's a new development.

47:45.565 --> 47:46.266
Stop lying!

47:46.886 --> 47:50.850
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but that is a scripted line there.

47:50.890 --> 47:53.192
That is not somebody trying to...

47:54.884 --> 48:13.423
trying to oh my gosh I'm mad who as an independent doctor still feel the the the change that at least from the perspective of a parent I really feel like I felt the change where my family doctor went from being a guy who was telling me what he thought to being a guy

48:13.891 --> 48:18.633
telling me what he was told that he should do or what the policy was.

48:20.313 --> 48:28.596
With the last two years that I've been talking to my family physician, it's been very much him telling me what he's read rather than what he thinks.

48:28.877 --> 48:33.058
And I find that change very difficult to accept.

48:33.938 --> 48:38.020
And I can't imagine what it would be like being the professional on the other end of that change.

48:39.022 --> 48:45.624
I think the hardest thing for me to swallow through all this is the primary care doctors shutting their doors to their patients.

48:45.804 --> 48:47.144
That shocked me.

48:47.704 --> 48:52.285
I mean, your job as a doctor is to treat patients.

48:52.305 --> 48:56.306
Did that actually happen or is that something that we're supposed to believe is happening?

48:56.606 --> 49:02.908
I would really like to hear the numbers on that because nobody I know of couldn't go to their doctor.

49:05.069 --> 49:08.331
It might've happened from a week, you know, or a month.

49:08.511 --> 49:13.514
I mean, I don't really know, but that sounds like, again, something that was queued up.

49:13.974 --> 49:19.197
The thing that bothers me the most about this is that, I don't know, I'd like to know the numbers on that one.

49:19.737 --> 49:26.681
All these physician offices closed their doors, and now, even there, there's still some doctors that won't see you if,

49:28.539 --> 49:33.344
if you're not vaccinated or if you have symptoms of COVID, they won't see you.

49:33.364 --> 49:38.389
And that is just completely shocking to me.

49:39.069 --> 49:46.717
I haven't taken my kids to any kind of, I haven't been to see a doctor or taken my kids, so I haven't had the first-hand patient experience that you're talking about.

49:47.871 --> 50:06.148
I certainly hear it from all of my patients, and I hear them say how they feel pressured to get the vaccine, they feel judged if they bring up... Yeah, I mean, I will temper my comments, because again, it is very possible for somebody to think they're doing

50:07.486 --> 50:31.057
really well and that they understand molecular biology enough to understand viruses versus bacteria and antibiotics versus antivirals and you know anesthetics versus analgesics and so they this is all you know just trying to keep up and again if if you've just

50:32.096 --> 50:43.085
fallen face first into the butter because you were allowed to test a bunch of people and call it a business, and it's still going strong, are you really gonna say, hey, this is all for nothing.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.386
They tricked me into doing this.

50:45.267 --> 50:46.208
I shouldn't be doing this.

50:46.228 --> 50:46.888
This is nuts.

50:47.209 --> 50:59.159
I mean, I don't know how very many people are supposed to see through it, especially if there was any, any, any focus at all on her like there was on me.

51:00.069 --> 51:05.690
If Robert Malone came to visit her, or she was invited, or you know, whoever came over and hung out.

51:05.730 --> 51:15.332
I don't know where she was up until 2022, but it would have been plenty of time for her to have, you know, gone somewhere with all of these people and sat down at a table and said, here's what's going on.

51:15.412 --> 51:17.173
And here's what we need from you.

51:17.273 --> 51:18.353
And it's an opportunity.

51:18.433 --> 51:24.094
And also if you, if you manage to pull it off, then we can also support you on the internet and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

51:25.095 --> 51:25.435
Great.

51:25.535 --> 51:26.155
Sounds good.

51:26.435 --> 51:27.015
Sign me up.

51:29.321 --> 51:29.762
I don't know.

51:30.563 --> 51:39.237
It's unfortunate, but I just think that line about, you know, before the pandemic, most doctors didn't think you could treat, but I don't even know what that, that, that's impossible.

51:39.277 --> 51:40.179
That's not a thought.

51:40.860 --> 51:41.541
That's a script.

51:43.041 --> 51:54.152
they, you know, they just feel like they're talking to a, you know, a planned answer that has no critical thinking to it.

51:54.212 --> 51:55.313
There's no discussion.

51:55.333 --> 51:57.455
It's just a one size fits all.

51:57.475 --> 51:58.557
It doesn't matter.

51:58.577 --> 52:02.400
You know, the natural immunity doesn't matter.

52:02.420 --> 52:03.662
I mean, it's, it's,

52:05.572 --> 52:06.373
It's pretty awful.

52:06.613 --> 52:12.918
I think one of the things that first cued me off that things were wrong was when I realized I thought natural immunity mattered.

52:12.958 --> 52:17.783
I thought that Mary Holland could travel during the pandemic because she had natural immunity.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.486
She had COVID for like two days, but took ivermectin and she was fine.

52:22.967 --> 52:25.489
I thought natural immunity allowed Mary Holland to travel.

52:26.610 --> 52:27.411
So it's weird.

52:27.431 --> 52:29.132
There's a lot of contradictory signals.

52:29.393 --> 52:33.296
They hadn't given one general recommendation about good health.

52:34.028 --> 52:35.909
like changing your practices a little bit.

52:35.949 --> 52:43.135
There's a pandemic coming, so maybe you want to think about seeing your doctor, checking your vitamin D level, whatever it might be.

52:43.675 --> 52:46.357
There had to have been something they could have said, and they said nothing.

52:49.019 --> 52:55.664
And of course, you're aware of the early treatment stuff, and you mentioned that you got on that pretty quick.

52:56.365 --> 53:02.009
Do you think it was important that you were in Texas, where there might have been less

53:03.553 --> 53:04.314
No, it didn't matter.

53:04.954 --> 53:10.439
OK, so I am in Harris County, which is a huge county in Houston.

53:10.899 --> 53:13.781
And it's very, very, very liberal.

53:13.901 --> 53:24.170
So I feel like a fish out of water, especially in the medical community, because the medical center is the biggest employer in the county.

53:25.177 --> 53:27.598
And the medical center brings in people from all over.

53:27.698 --> 53:30.240
It's not just born and bred Texans.

53:30.480 --> 53:32.921
So it's, you know, it's good.

53:32.961 --> 53:34.982
It's diverse, but it's also super liberal.

53:35.563 --> 53:37.804
Um, and particularly among doctors.

53:38.384 --> 53:38.724
I see.

53:39.765 --> 53:40.005
Yup.

53:40.165 --> 53:40.465
I see.

53:40.485 --> 53:41.726
I don't know if I like that.

53:41.746 --> 53:47.769
One of the things that I've been telling my viewers a lot is a story that I heard firsthand from, um,

53:48.795 --> 53:49.795
Wolfgang Wodach.

53:49.836 --> 53:50.916
Do you know who that guy is?

53:50.936 --> 53:52.417
He's from Germany.

53:52.497 --> 53:54.558
He's a respiratory physiologist.

53:54.578 --> 53:56.739
See, she doesn't know who Wolfgang Wodach is.

53:56.939 --> 54:03.282
That's a good sign that there's something there, you know?

54:03.402 --> 54:05.503
And I don't mean that she's a bad guy.

54:05.523 --> 54:12.386
I mean that she was cued up, that she was given a couple hints, and the stock tips paid off.

54:13.223 --> 54:21.911
The investment paid off and she just thinks that she's one of the lucky ones and now doing the right thing for her family.

54:21.931 --> 54:24.053
And so I don't think there's a lot of spite here.

54:24.633 --> 54:32.300
I certainly don't think there's a person who knows that behind the curtain people are going to be transfected and it's a terrible idea yet.

54:34.026 --> 54:35.427
I don't think so.

54:35.507 --> 54:43.711
Certainly doesn't seem like she's worried about it because she's calling it a vaccine and complaining about doctors not seeing people who don't want the vaccine.

54:43.731 --> 54:46.273
So she doesn't seem to be worried about the vaccine at all yet.

54:47.153 --> 54:51.816
He used to work for their public health service.

54:52.276 --> 54:59.942
And in 2009, he was involved in this swine flu pandemic slash bad flu vaccine thing in Germany.

55:00.702 --> 55:16.853
And when the pandemic first started, I was in an email exchange with him where he tried to convince me, and I know that I pretty much am sure he's right now, but I just wanted to see if you could confirm some of this, that as a respiratory physiologist every year,

55:17.733 --> 55:31.079
people die of, let's say, unknown general pneumonia, unknown viral pneumonia, because they're old and they have comorbidities, and we've never labeled it like we label it now.

55:31.779 --> 55:33.080
And from his perspective,

55:34.294 --> 55:54.582
So at this time, I hadn't done the work necessary to understand how big of a signal was hidden in the population pyramid, but I already know that biologically speaking, there is a signal that could be misconstrued as something novel if they just pretended that their PCR tests were specific for it.

55:54.902 --> 55:56.303
It might even come out right here.

55:56.323 --> 55:57.243
Or even tried.

55:57.947 --> 56:05.812
They never tried to really categorize these things as different viruses and find out whether it was one virus or another virus that was doing it.

56:06.813 --> 56:13.477
And now... So if that's true, then why are you, why would you have in your head already that you can't treat it?

56:13.697 --> 56:21.222
If you were never trying to differentiate viruses, then how do you know which one was viruses and which ones were treatable and which ones weren't?

56:22.697 --> 56:36.383
What an interesting agreement that, I don't want to be a picky guy, but it's, that seems to disagree with what she said earlier, which is that all doctors just assume that, you know, you can't treat a virus before the pandemic.

56:36.423 --> 56:40.004
But she says that before the pandemic, they weren't even paying attention to viruses.

56:40.404 --> 56:42.465
They weren't trying to differentiate from anything.

56:42.505 --> 56:46.427
Wolfgang Wodach says that, you know, respiratory disease is respiratory disease.

56:46.447 --> 56:48.608
We never had a molecular test to tell what it was.

56:50.134 --> 56:56.878
to suddenly say that we're going to categorize them and then say that they're only one, he thought was absurd.

56:56.918 --> 57:07.163
And he doesn't have the evidence because, you know, he's not a molecular biologist, but from his perspective, they always used to teach their med students that there are around 200 coronaviruses.

57:07.183 --> 57:10.525
So now she may be switching to the script on that side.

57:10.605 --> 57:11.466
Just watch her eyes.

57:12.146 --> 57:14.567
All cause basically the same kind of respiratory disease.

57:16.621 --> 57:23.226
Well, I will say, I don't know that we had the technology and that's been another advancement since COVID.

57:23.266 --> 57:28.651
Like I have a machine now in my office that can distinguish between 18 different viruses.

57:29.091 --> 57:36.858
Oh, I have a machine in my office that can distinguish between 18 different viruses.

57:44.284 --> 57:45.224
I don't know what, I don't know.

57:45.245 --> 57:45.665
I mean,

57:46.101 --> 57:49.983
Now, that would have been unheard of prior to the pandemic.

57:50.043 --> 57:54.224
That would have been unheard of prior to the pandemic, but she assumes it's all above board.

57:55.125 --> 57:57.626
Before the pandemic, we didn't have these things.

57:58.046 --> 58:02.648
But now that we have these things, I'm sure I know what was around before the pandemic.

58:03.453 --> 58:07.934
It's a background signal that they have no data on before the pandemic.

58:07.974 --> 58:09.594
Then they rolled out a bunch of machines.

58:09.675 --> 58:23.998
And even if they can measure it now, because you weren't measuring it then, you have no idea if what you're measuring right now is a set of novel signals with these new names or a set of old signals that have been given new names.

58:27.796 --> 58:31.958
And now we have these products and the FDA is not going to regulate them.

58:32.518 --> 58:43.442
She's talking about machines that can find 17 different viruses in there in a lot or all of the hospitals and testing facilities in America and around the world.

58:43.942 --> 58:46.443
And this is all an elaborate illusion.

58:47.651 --> 58:48.492
And it's good.

58:48.752 --> 58:53.895
I mean, I can distinguish between COVID and the flu and all these, and RSV.

58:54.155 --> 59:04.722
And I think prior to the pandemic, no one really cared because we didn't have the means of actually distinguishing very much.

59:05.243 --> 59:06.884
So I think that's part of it.

59:07.324 --> 59:10.026
Not to, I'm sure there's conspiracy behind it.

59:10.166 --> 59:11.046
No, no, no.

59:11.567 --> 59:13.308
I'm sure there's conspiracies behind it.

59:13.868 --> 59:14.549
What does that mean?

59:15.748 --> 59:20.530
Before the pandemic, we didn't measure any of those 17 viruses.

59:21.370 --> 59:23.832
And then after the pandemic, you started measuring them.

59:23.892 --> 59:36.477
Now that is equivalent to saying that before the pandemic, there were just cars, but after the pandemic, now we have dangerous cars and other dangerous cars and we can measure them all and they're spreading everywhere.

59:37.778 --> 59:42.960
And they're the reason why, you know, we have to vaccinate people or they're the reason why we have to lock down.

59:48.092 --> 01:00:06.218
I really only want to say that if there is an ongoing phenomenon which is responsible for X number of deaths every year that we didn't paint very specifically and now we're painting it very specifically, there is a possibility that we're making more of something that was already there.

01:00:06.438 --> 01:00:07.038
That's all.

01:00:07.398 --> 01:00:08.819
And I think that's one of the problems.

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:13.000
I mean, if I have a conversation with my family and I tell them that

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:27.419
between 2,800,000 and 3,000,000 people die every year in America, and then you divide that by 365 days, you start to figure out that when they say that 2,000 people died of COVID, it's not a giant number.

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:35.282
And so that's part of this too, is having some perspective on what's actually going on in a hospital every day.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:39.644
And that's been very frustrating for me.

01:00:39.805 --> 01:00:40.485
Is there a way,

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:57.158
or a tip or an idea that you have of how to get this tide to turn where we can start to take account of what really happened and not just keep running forward.

01:00:57.338 --> 01:01:02.059
Because I think we do have to realize that some people were very wrong for a very long time, right?

01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:02.339
I mean.

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:03.639
Right.

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:06.500
I mean, I do feel like a tide is shifting.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.120
I don't know.

01:01:09.406 --> 01:01:19.488
I mean, I think the more and more people that have vaccine reactions and come forward and are vocal about that, it can't be ignored.

01:01:21.629 --> 01:01:32.011
I've noticed a few more politicians standing up, like Ted Cruz was at the truckers convoy, which that gave me some hope.

01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:35.172
He's been pretty quiet on COVID.

01:01:37.332 --> 01:01:40.833
Yeah, I'm still I think now now that I don't.

01:01:40.893 --> 01:01:47.155
I'm not seeing as many sick people and I don't know about the rest of it, but in Houston it's dying down tremendously.

01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:50.096
Now I have time to be more vocal.

01:01:50.296 --> 01:01:51.696
Talk more on interviews.

01:01:53.177 --> 01:02:01.819
I'm suing Methodist Hospital to get their financial information and that will that will stay in the news and.

01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:04.900
We're gonna have a press conference soon.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.521
Why is she suing for their financial information?

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:13.623
Wouldn't she have wanted to sue for her job or for the lost salary or some kind of professional thing?

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:21.126
To talk about the frivolous complaints that are being made against doctors like me.

01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:30.150
So I think now that there aren't as many sick people, that doctors like myself are gonna have time to become more and more vocal.

01:02:31.505 --> 01:02:33.067
really get the message out.

01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:42.337
Did you have a plan or did you formulate a plan when you when you started to become successful treating patients?

01:02:42.357 --> 01:02:45.360
I don't know if there is a plan or is there

01:02:46.519 --> 01:03:01.930
I'm not getting this question out as the way I want to, but have you tried, I'm assuming you have, to collect data across these patients that you're treating so you can show what's happening and what improvements are occurring with your treatments and keeping track of this?

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:02.350
Okay.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:03.030
Yes.

01:03:03.311 --> 01:03:13.778
And that's another goal of mine in the coming month or two is to really look at that data and organize it and analyze it and get it out there.

01:03:14.398 --> 01:03:14.679
I see.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.501
And so what do you have?

01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:18.883
Can you tell me like what kinds of data is data?

01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:24.607
Do you take just all kinds of measurements when they come in and then all kinds of measurements when they're fine?

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.408
Or how do you do it?

01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:27.770
It's, I mean, it, it evolved.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.711
It's an evolving thing.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.392
I get, I used to track.

01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:40.260
Wouldn't you want to keep track of how ivermectin, what doses you're using, how many people are recovering, how long the recovery is.

01:03:41.843 --> 01:03:43.984
Don't you see what the issue is here?

01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:45.585
Don't you want to know what's happening?

01:03:45.665 --> 01:03:48.647
Don't you want to, you just assuming all those things work.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.247
So then what's the research you're going to do?

01:03:50.287 --> 01:03:51.528
What data are you going to collect?

01:03:52.048 --> 01:03:52.949
This is interesting.

01:03:53.009 --> 01:03:54.930
I don't, I don't think she's, Oh, wow.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:55.550
Yeah.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.251
Percent positives every week.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.992
Like, and, and then I used to try.

01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:03.674
And so what do you have, can you tell me like what kinds of data is data?

01:04:03.694 --> 01:04:09.417
Do you take just all kinds of measurements when they come in and then all kinds of measurements when they're fine?

01:04:09.477 --> 01:04:10.158
Or how do you do it?

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:12.535
It's, I mean, it, it evolved.

01:04:12.575 --> 01:04:13.476
It's an evolving thing.

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:24.219
Like it, I used to track, you know, percent positives every week, like, and, and then I used to track, okay, how many are, how many of the vaccinated are positive and how many of the unvaccinated are positive.

01:04:24.879 --> 01:04:25.820
Now I'm looking at.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:35.523
Oh, so it's about vaccinated, positive vaccinated, not positive and whether or not they're more likely to get COVID, which was a narrative that we argued about for another year.

01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:38.924
And she keeps looking down to the same side of herself on the desk.

01:04:39.244 --> 01:04:45.357
long-haul patients and vaccine reactions and what interventions I'm giving them and what the results are.

01:04:45.377 --> 01:04:50.468
I just sent out a survey about early treatment like

01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:58.770
trying to get information on who got early treatment, how successful it was, how many people ended up getting hospitalized.

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:10.616
I mean, there's, and then I did an antibody study where I, everybody got, who had a natural immunity, who'd had prior COVID infection, but not vaccinated and no monoclonal antibodies.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.396
I got their antibody level.

01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:14.737
This is right after Delta.

01:05:14.937 --> 01:05:19.960
And then I looked to see if they got the Omicron variant and then what their antibody levels were after that.

01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:22.862
There you go.

01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:24.725
That was that was pretty uncomfortable.

01:05:24.785 --> 01:05:26.387
She had to push that one out boy.

01:05:26.467 --> 01:05:36.822
Wow, that was impressive You have any data from that last one did they get a boost again after their Omicron infection or did it not really?

01:05:37.628 --> 01:05:46.271
I'm still gathering that last data point, so it's hard to speculate at this point.

01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:51.933
The Omicron variant exists, and I'm checking whether people develop a seroprevalence to Omicron.

01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:53.033
Come on.

01:05:58.735 --> 01:06:00.676
Now, don't get me wrong.

01:06:02.037 --> 01:06:18.800
It's possible that Mary Talley Bowden is simply not biologically and scientifically sophisticated enough to know that if Robert Malone gave her these ideas, or Kevin McKernan gave her these research plans, and maybe a research assistant to help her, that this would feel very legitimate to her.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.961
Especially if they said you're working on behalf of whatever U.S.

01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:27.321
government, such and such, Human Genome Project military thing.

01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:29.482
It's not like she wouldn't fit the

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.182
the profile of a military lady.

01:06:34.563 --> 01:06:59.884
It's not like a giant, multi-decade national security, you know, thing wouldn't, I mean, just don't, just leave your mind open to the possibility that she got on Joe Rogan, not because she's a freedom fighter, that they have the wool pulled over her eyes, and there's a possibility that we might wake her up, and then she'll call Joe Rogan and say, oh my goodness, Jay's got a, you gotta talk to Jay.

01:07:00.854 --> 01:07:01.955
that's not gonna happen.

01:07:02.896 --> 01:07:05.639
I don't think that's gonna happen because this, no.

01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:24.618
So many papers out during the pandemic that have shown that, you know, the health care worker data is always the best for me because I feel like, you know, you guys are the people who are gonna get regular low-level exposure and so you're most likely to build a, whatever they want to call it, but

01:07:25.512 --> 01:07:48.110
you're you're most likely to be as asymptomatic as anyone can be while still building immunity that's how i see it and maybe listen to me juggle those those ideas that you know this invisible thing could produce that invisible thing and the presence of that invisible thing could mean that it was invisible for a long time when you didn't know it holy man the other healthy person but you guys are

01:07:49.428 --> 01:07:53.091
You know, like a school teacher, you have your immune system constantly on fire.

01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:55.613
So I feel like you guys would be the best ones.

01:07:56.053 --> 01:08:03.840
And all that data from healthcare workers is always showing that you guys are responding even when you don't show symptoms or whatever.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.281
Fully lost still.

01:08:05.341 --> 01:08:13.508
July 2022, still fully lost in the basic model of contagion and viruses and everything.

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:14.529
You can hear it, right?

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:22.237
I mean, this is when I just barely, you know, just barely am starting working for Bobby Kennedy on the book.

01:08:22.317 --> 01:08:28.284
At one point I was being paid, but I wasn't really being invited to any of these meetings right away.

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.525
It was just kind of supporting me.

01:08:30.646 --> 01:08:37.828
For me now, I'm happy that Pennsylvania has their masks gone now, but there are still places that are doing it.

01:08:38.068 --> 01:08:42.390
So we're just trying to find people and network people.

01:08:45.271 --> 01:08:49.072
I think I actually started already in May though, so this would be July.

01:08:49.152 --> 01:08:51.372
So I'm definitely already working on the book with him.

01:08:51.392 --> 01:08:53.693
I was hoping that Matt could help you.

01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:55.654
I don't know, did he say he would or is he too busy?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.643
Well, he's, he's heavily into the, um, Renz.

01:09:02.743 --> 01:09:10.588
And so I'm trying to hook her up with Matt Crawford and Matt Crawford is working on Thomas Renz right now, or with Thomas Renz right now.

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:12.369
That's actually what this video is.

01:09:12.429 --> 01:09:13.030
It's amazing.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.652
I felt like I can't really take away from that.

01:09:17.672 --> 01:09:20.654
Um, and I actually have a friend who is a statistician.

01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:21.435
He's going to help me.

01:09:21.475 --> 01:09:22.015
Well, there you go.

01:09:22.235 --> 01:09:22.375
Great.

01:09:22.395 --> 01:09:22.495
Great.

01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:48.099
I'm, uh, I'm very curious, um, to know if, if, if, if long COVID, do you, do you have any idea if long COVID will eventually, do you have a feeling that it will be linked to other similar, uh, fatigue disorders and this kind of thing, or, or will it, will there be any connection to hospitalization or not, or ventilation or not?

01:09:48.179 --> 01:09:48.859
Or, I mean, it's,

01:09:49.798 --> 01:09:56.622
or do you really think it is just a thing that happens to some people?

01:09:56.642 --> 01:09:56.782
I don't.

01:09:56.802 --> 01:10:05.688
So there's, from what I understand is that you don't have to have severe symptoms to end up with long COVID and that's consistent with what I'm seeing.

01:10:05.708 --> 01:10:06.788
Okay.

01:10:06.948 --> 01:10:10.190
It does tend to respond very well to ivermectin.

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:10.250
Um,

01:10:11.471 --> 01:10:18.237
Yeah, not in everybody, but I do get a good response.

01:10:18.537 --> 01:10:22.800
I just don't understand how you can jive that, not with everybody.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.182
Then what's the mechanism that describes that?

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:34.430
Because if this is viral replication and ivermectin interferes with viral replication, then why is it that sometimes it doesn't?

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:39.448
I don't understand.

01:10:39.508 --> 01:10:45.014
And I want to understand because they say it with such certainty with no mechanistic explanation at all.

01:10:46.095 --> 01:10:46.856
I don't get it.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.640
Do doctors always accept these things like that?

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.844
If it doesn't work for everybody, then what does it mean to you as a doctor?

01:10:56.306 --> 01:10:59.009
Does it mean that some people didn't have COVID?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:23.757
I mean, can't we at least get that far in our thinking that we're processing reality as it happens, that we assess the words that are coming out of our mouth and try to explain why that massive battleship size contradiction that I just spit out of my mouth that makes me sound like I know nothing about what I'm doing and I have no idea of what I'm doing.

01:11:24.597 --> 01:11:26.018
Let me explain that further.

01:11:26.979 --> 01:11:27.820
Holy shit.

01:11:31.532 --> 01:11:33.257
I can only poop again.

01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:47.570
I guess my big question is, is this gonna be something that lays dormant and then just flares up here and there, like, you know, like upstream?

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:52.012
That hippie dickie, I'm sorry, but I was a biophysicist for a while.

01:11:52.353 --> 01:11:54.314
I worked on ion channels for a while.

01:11:55.014 --> 01:12:05.140
You can't just say it's calcium or it's chloride or it's sodium channels, because if you say that, then it's almost inevitably a toxin.

01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:11.223
You can't interfere with a whole family of ion channels and not be toxic.

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.243
It's not possible.

01:12:13.644 --> 01:12:21.326
And any of these people who say otherwise just simply don't understand how cellular physiology, as we understand it right now, works.

01:12:21.406 --> 01:12:23.807
But ion channels are integral to that.

01:12:24.647 --> 01:12:26.388
And certainly chloride channels are.

01:12:26.828 --> 01:12:32.670
And you'd have to be very specific about what kind of chloride channel it was and whether it was a G protein coupled channel or not.

01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:47.668
whether it was a calcium-dependent channel or not, whether it was fast or slow decay channel, where are they, what cells are they expressed in, and which ones would matter and which ones don't, and are there any chloride channels in the brain that are affected, because that would be very different.

01:12:47.688 --> 01:12:58.173
You see, this is the problem with the social media, because they can put these little ideas out there that combine words together that sound really intelligent, when in fact they're ridiculous.

01:12:59.758 --> 01:13:08.705
To say that ivermectin interacts with chloride channels, therefore it cures cancer, therefore it cures COVID is so absurd.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.469
It's just, it's ridiculous.

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:17.332
And I'm not trying to be condescending.

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:20.974
I'm trying to be a good coach.

01:13:22.075 --> 01:13:24.237
And that is ignoring the fundamentals.

01:13:27.076 --> 01:13:35.361
That is ignoring the fundamentals of what we know and what we don't know and the ridiculously, almost irreducibly complex thing that we are.

01:13:35.842 --> 01:13:39.304
And when you say chloride channels, that's like saying athletes.

01:13:39.484 --> 01:13:41.185
And I understand athletes.

01:13:42.966 --> 01:13:50.371
And it's like, but chloride channels are a very diverse set of channels with a whole bunch of different regulatory mechanisms built in.

01:13:51.952 --> 01:13:56.195
There's fast ones and slow ones and large conductance and small conductance and

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:58.570
this tissue and that tissue.

01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:13.553
And so we've got to learn and we've got to focus on that because allowing people to get away with saying that ivermectin works for some people means that you don't really know anything.

01:14:13.813 --> 01:14:16.454
And that's a damning statement right there.

01:14:16.594 --> 01:14:25.436
Either she's easily bamboozled and is really just following a script that someone gave her and sticking to it because so far it's paid off big time.

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:28.229
Or she's just, she's fooled.

01:14:28.469 --> 01:14:30.150
She's fooled like everybody else was.

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:33.913
And she's lucky enough to got on Joe Rogan just because.

01:14:35.294 --> 01:14:38.996
Or is it once it's gone, it's COVID and that's.

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:45.761
Or I mean, it's, do you really think it is just a thing that happens to some people?

01:14:46.838 --> 01:14:56.944
I don't, so there's, from what I understand is that you don't have to have severe symptoms to end up with long COVID and that's consistent with what I'm seeing.

01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:58.065
Okay.

01:14:58.225 --> 01:15:01.407
It does tend to respond very well to ivermectin.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:07.310
Yeah, not in everybody, but I do get a good response.

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:18.914
I mean, just think about that elementary high school level biology student thinking about this and how easy it would be for any one of those high school students that I saw graduate yesterday to think a little while and say, hey, wait a minute.

01:15:19.654 --> 01:15:21.814
What did we use ivermectin for before?

01:15:22.315 --> 01:15:24.435
Wasn't it for parasites or something like that?

01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:31.898
What would be the effect of sick people coming into your office, some of them with parasites, and then you gave them ivermectin and they felt a little better?

01:15:32.418 --> 01:15:52.840
and you thought you were treating COVID and they all had COVID but some of the people with COVID also has parasites and now you treated their parasites and they feel better but you didn't know and they didn't know that ivermectin worked on parasites you know like heartworm and dogs and cancer in Canada and so this is serious because that level of

01:15:54.685 --> 01:15:58.131
shallow thought suggests that she's on a script.

01:15:58.612 --> 01:16:07.829
Because nobody who was thinking about what they were saying would say that it doesn't work for everyone, works for some people, and then think that that's understanding.

01:16:13.258 --> 01:16:27.414
Um, and I guess my big question is, is this going to be something that lays dormant and then just flares up here and there, like, you know, like Epstein bar, um, or is it once it's gone, it's gone.

01:16:27.494 --> 01:16:31.979
But my, my hunch is it's going to lay dormant and then flare up here and there.

01:16:32.498 --> 01:16:33.478
I see, I see.

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:42.943
I saw a couple of recent results that show that... Just drop the F-15 bar in there so that there's another hamster wheel and another biology book I can read, right?

01:16:43.043 --> 01:16:47.765
I mean, you know, just like Judy Mikovits might say, latent viruses that...

01:16:48.405 --> 01:16:53.867
latent mouse viruses are, you know, being triggered by other viruses that are in the vaccines.

01:16:53.907 --> 01:17:01.109
And so if we vaccinated for you, you for that virus, then they wouldn't activate the other viruses that cause autism and chronic fatigue disorder.

01:17:01.129 --> 01:17:11.753
It might be infecting CD4 positive helper T cells, in which case maybe very similar to the way that, that HIV can stay dormant.

01:17:12.973 --> 01:17:14.133
And it's possible that I,

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:25.743
Don't know enough to go that far into the disease portion of it, but dormant viruses to me are something that Still have very little understanding in the literature, too.

01:17:25.823 --> 01:17:34.711
So it's very hard to know exactly what's going on there She won't say anything about that one any other specific things that I wanted to get that was a pretty good comment.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:34.771
I

01:17:37.915 --> 01:17:39.456
This has been already really good.

01:17:40.257 --> 01:17:48.464
I knew that it would be quick just because, again, my goal here is to alert people to you and to sort of spread the word about you.

01:17:48.504 --> 01:17:54.529
And at the same time, I want to build up a list of doctors who are doing this, and I think

01:17:57.202 --> 01:18:01.064
Yeah, it's got to be very frustrating to be in it.

01:18:01.124 --> 01:18:07.008
I mean, I've been complaining about it for more than two years, and I know a lot of other people have like yourself.

01:18:08.329 --> 01:18:17.294
And it's difficult now to see the country divided as much as it is about something as biological as this that we shouldn't be fighting about.

01:18:18.135 --> 01:18:18.655
Right.

01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:26.040
Well, for me, what's scary and I was going to ask for advice was how would you advise that I

01:18:26.781 --> 01:18:28.322
approach my own doctor.

01:18:30.483 --> 01:18:48.614
So I'll give you the status of my current doctor is that he supported a medical exemption for my wife by saying that we wrote a letter with a great deal of scientific support and evidence, but he disagrees with our conclusions but still wants to support our choice.

01:18:49.648 --> 01:18:57.036
So he specifically said in the exemption that he didn't support it, the actual conclusion.

01:18:57.096 --> 01:19:02.341
And that was when my wife was working at UPMC Medical Center, yes, while I was doing this.

01:19:02.401 --> 01:19:07.647
So she got a job in 2022 and was working to make this happen.

01:19:08.487 --> 01:19:10.730
So yeah, everybody's sacrificing on this boat.

01:19:11.324 --> 01:19:15.146
But he wanted to support our choice, which is pretty weak, but anyway.

01:19:15.867 --> 01:19:17.808
Okay, I'm going to wrap this up.

01:19:17.848 --> 01:19:22.510
You can watch the last bit of that on my PeerTube channel.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:23.551
I uploaded it there.

01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:26.572
I think this explanation fits very well.

01:19:27.073 --> 01:19:30.815
I don't think anything we heard from Mary Bowden suggests that

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:35.956
She was anything but scripted and cued up and stick to these things and it'll be fine.

01:19:36.457 --> 01:19:39.978
There were a couple hairy moments there, a couple things that didn't feel very good to me.

01:19:39.998 --> 01:19:44.659
And I think I was pretty good at pointing that out, so I don't need to go over it again.

01:19:45.179 --> 01:20:00.584
But it stands to reason and stands clear here that one of the primary things that she believes in and in fact was ahead of, like Ryan Cole was ahead of, was being available and having the facilities to test.

01:20:01.476 --> 01:20:05.537
And that she's got a machine in her office that can test for 17 different viruses.

01:20:05.577 --> 01:20:09.418
So I think she is a witting or unwitting ghostbuster at this point.

01:20:10.079 --> 01:20:15.260
And she should be sophisticated enough to understand that actually RNA can't do that.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:21.022
She should be able to come to the conclusion after more study that

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:29.632
The arrangement of the immune system and the arrangement of our barriers suggests that intramuscular injection is never a good idea.

01:20:30.733 --> 01:20:37.021
Transfecting healthy people, therefore, is an even worse idea because it belies a level of understanding of the

01:20:37.742 --> 01:20:41.304
irreducible complexity that we are, that we simply do not have.

01:20:41.344 --> 01:20:51.149
We can't just express some proteins in places in the body and assume that what's going to happen is the body's going to make antibodies to those proteins and those antibodies will save us.

01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:59.194
The population pyramid is a problem, it is a real thing, and it is one of the primary movers of the way that we are being governed on Earth right now.

01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:05.721
The pandemic would have never been possible without these people, and Andy's picture should be bigger than that, I apologize.

01:21:06.342 --> 01:21:15.994
The people that I'm pretty sure are all in on it or so lost in it, it's almost all of them, and they all will reinforce the bad biology until they

01:21:16.634 --> 01:21:21.598
until they go to their grave evolution because DNA, PCR, are a universal diagnostic tool.

01:21:21.998 --> 01:21:25.260
Sequencing is a high-fidelity measurement, especially when done by DITRA.

01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:30.624
Endemicity is a process and also an end state that lasts forever.

01:21:31.184 --> 01:21:33.106
And gain-of-function has many, many forms.

01:21:33.546 --> 01:21:41.492
Many, many forms from cell culture and enrichment to using animals to enrich viruses.

01:21:42.152 --> 01:21:45.054
And so intramuscular injection is the best kind of medicine.

01:21:45.094 --> 01:21:46.095
It's the best invention.

01:21:46.836 --> 01:21:49.598
Pandemics are real, and we can also make them in a garage.

01:21:50.018 --> 01:21:56.983
You are human, not a person with only a limited amount of time to contribute to the well-being of future generations.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:22:01.227
You're just a human, and you should turn over your data to your rulers.

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:03.128
And we all descend from the same puddle.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:04.329
That's basically the joke.

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:07.211
It's been a long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:07.271 --> 01:22:09.153
I hope you have a very, very happy Friday.

01:22:10.554 --> 01:22:12.775
I guess I should play us out.

01:22:13.756 --> 01:22:14.216
I don't know.

01:22:14.777 --> 01:22:16.037
I want to do a different song.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.339
Don't forget, that's how they're getting away with it.

01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:20.100
COVID shots are bad is great to say.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.082
Just don't talk about the murder in 2020.

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:23.463
It's for all the marbles.

01:22:23.543 --> 01:22:26.185
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:28.446
Thank you very much for all your support.

01:22:28.566 --> 01:22:30.108
If you would like to support this stream,

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:34.032
Please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do so.

01:22:34.592 --> 01:22:38.396
I'm going to keep working, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to keep this on the air.

01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:45.764
But boy would I like to make more videos, and boy would I like to make more channels, and boy would I like to make a high school curriculum.

01:22:45.824 --> 01:22:49.268
So help me out there a little bit if you can, especially if you've never done it before.

01:22:49.308 --> 01:22:50.489
There's so many people who've

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:54.016
have just made this, I mean, it's crazy.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:23:09.711
There's, you know, it's really crazy how many people I have to thank and how blessed I feel to have those friends around the world supporting my family and supporting this very, very crucial work to preserve what I think is human history.

01:23:09.811 --> 01:23:13.755
What I think is the last, potentially the last

01:23:14.893 --> 01:23:22.917
open window that we can just pull our kids out and end this social media domination of our collective reality.

01:23:23.417 --> 01:23:24.338
I love you all very much.

01:23:24.758 --> 01:23:25.318
Good to see you.

01:23:25.599 --> 01:23:28.460
And I think I will just play this one out actually.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:29.380
Thank you.

01:23:29.761 --> 01:23:30.101
Thank you.

01:23:30.141 --> 01:23:30.901
Have a good weekend.

01:23:31.201 --> 01:23:33.703
There could be a stream tomorrow night by the fire.

01:23:34.423 --> 01:23:46.310
There is rumors that I'm having a guest, and that guest might be up for hanging out by a fire with a microphone and talking, and that might mean that we'll also call another friend and have a three-way conversation.

01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.750
We'll see.

01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:51.233
I apologize for the awkward ending, and I will see you again very, very soon.
