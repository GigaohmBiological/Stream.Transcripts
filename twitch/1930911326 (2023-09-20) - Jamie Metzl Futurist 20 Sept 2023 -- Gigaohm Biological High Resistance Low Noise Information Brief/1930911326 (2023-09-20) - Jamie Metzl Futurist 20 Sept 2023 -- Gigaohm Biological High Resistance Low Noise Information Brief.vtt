01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I

01:47.560 --> 01:53.600
Sorry I'm late ladies and gentlemen, this is gonna go on biological every night every day

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You

02:04.000 --> 02:31.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next

02:31.000 --> 02:42.000
He's going on French British Italian Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
Hey listen to this gang. Teenage sleuths solved bone hijacking mystery. Captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sheriff

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
That was some plan they had first spreading the phony story about cover and then stealing the yachts from the marina

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
That night on the beach color was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of shit

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, but like his diving suit got covered with that cookey glowing seaweed

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And that's where the glowing ghost story came from

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Well that closes the mystery

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
How did scuba do with that? I guess that's another mystery

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is the own biological since 20th of September 2023

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I thought I'd take a look at an interesting

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
alternate player in the scuba doo

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
A very integral player in the beginning of the scuba doo actually part of laying down this spectrum of debate very early on in

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
2020 and I think we can learn something about drastic and about what drastic likely was

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
By thinking carefully about what we can show you in these first couple videos

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm I'm really curious as to see looking back. I will affect you. Definitely affected me a lot

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
I think it's a really really cool. It's a really really cool look back. I'm supposed to have a sound effect there. Yeah

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Something like that. I don't know what

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen hello

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Welcome to the show. I'm fresh off of the set of

05:06.600 --> 05:09.000
Brian Hooker's doctors and scientists podcast

05:10.600 --> 05:17.000
So I surprised him by wearing his shirt that I got at the bus the other day and we had a really interesting discussion

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Where I

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Does that work? No that doesn't work

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Where I drew a picture of the immune system and we talked about all kinds of things to do with the

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Transfection and we had a really nice conversation. So I hope that's gonna be out

05:33.000 --> 05:36.400
I don't know when that comes out. Does it come out tomorrow? Maybe I don't know

05:37.600 --> 05:40.400
But when I find out what it is out, I will tell you that it's out

05:41.500 --> 05:46.300
Please don't take the bait on social media. Don't take the bait on TV. It's gonna get worse

05:47.700 --> 05:54.900
That's one of their plans right is to keep us endlessly endlessly divided and especially on our side now

05:55.900 --> 05:57.900
The waking up of

05:57.900 --> 06:01.900
As Vera said last night on Mark's happy birthday stream

06:02.200 --> 06:04.200
the mamas have woken up and

06:04.900 --> 06:13.200
There may be no turning back now and so the consequences of this could be quite severe and the question is how will the system react and

06:14.300 --> 06:17.700
We can almost guarantee that they're gonna try and fragment us

06:18.200 --> 06:20.300
So that there isn't one united front

06:20.900 --> 06:23.900
With regard to vaccination with regard to health freedom

06:24.000 --> 06:30.300
So I think we all have to really be aware that to a certain extent that message of don't divide is real

06:31.400 --> 06:36.300
On the other hand we have to be very careful that we don't allow

06:38.300 --> 06:40.300
Fake rather than grassroots

06:42.000 --> 06:44.900
Manufactured rather than grassroots that we don't let

06:45.900 --> 06:52.000
Installed people that have deep ties to the system that we were trying to break

06:53.000 --> 06:59.500
That aren't posing as people who could be trying to help us but in reality might walk us right back into the wood jipper

07:01.700 --> 07:08.000
And so I think it's really important and I was able to explain this pretty well on Brian's podcast that we realize that

07:08.000 --> 07:21.100
The transfection is not immunization and that more importantly we come to the realization that any combination of chemicals that's inter injected intramuscularly is is a pretty silly way of augmenting the immune system

07:24.500 --> 07:36.100
I would like to also encourage you to go back and watch the Twiv episode from the other day because the Twiv episode from the other day covers some of the more subtle nuances of antibody dependent

07:36.600 --> 07:51.000
memory as it were and I think it's a really neat example of how you can have these five virologists talking about immunology and they can walk right past the elephant and not see it

07:52.800 --> 07:57.600
They also talked about engineering of RNA viruses with CRISPR

07:58.600 --> 08:13.600
They tried to make it seem like it was a pretty neat thing but they kind of glossed over the fact that in order for them to do any of the experiments that they did they were more or less just transfecting RNA into cell cultures and then looking for fluorescence

08:14.600 --> 08:26.600
And the things that they were injecting there had to be only could be made through recombinant DNA technology converted to RNA and then transfected into those cells

08:26.600 --> 08:45.600
So they're using the exact cloning technology that I came to realize about a year ago is the only way you could explain how a high fidelity full coronavirus sequence identical to a coronavirus sequence found in five or six other disparate locations on Earth could exist

08:46.600 --> 08:50.600
It's because it had to be put there by clone

08:51.600 --> 09:06.600
So we've had the way that we changed just been fundamentally inverted by people and the narrative on television combined with the counter narrative on social media

09:07.600 --> 09:24.600
And the clever part of that is the idea that even if you think you're going against the TV there's still another safety wall and another safety wall here of narrative to keep you in and that's what all of these players have enabled

09:25.600 --> 09:35.600
They have enabled the idea that people would come to the general understanding that yes you can be vulnerable to a novel virus and everybody can be vulnerable to it

09:37.600 --> 09:43.600
They changed fundamentally the way we think about all cause mortality by making us not think about it

09:44.600 --> 09:51.600
Nobody's been putting any of these numbers into context and in retrospect nobody's putting these numbers into context

09:52.600 --> 10:06.600
If you said a billion people were going to die in March of 2022 by the end of this and you're off by oh I don't know a billion people then we have a pretty serious problem on our hands

10:07.600 --> 10:16.600
If you said that antibodies were the reason why you needed to be worried about this virus and that antibodies were the only thing to think about

10:16.600 --> 10:26.600
And you weren't let's say clever enough to teach real immunology based from antigen presenting cell to T cell to B cell then you were part of this

10:27.600 --> 10:35.600
And if you didn't take the time to learn the immunology well enough to know that transfection isn't a form of immunization

10:37.600 --> 10:42.600
And get to the point where you realize wow immunization is kind of a weird thing isn't it in Western society

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
The way that we protect it the way that is worshipped

10:48.600 --> 10:59.600
And so all of these changes that they brought about were really mystical they were magical changes that enchanted everyone and they were laid down before the pandemic

11:01.600 --> 11:07.600
So that when we went into this pandemic and the fear was ramped up and the confusion was ramped up and the doubt was ramped up

11:07.600 --> 11:19.600
that everybody would accept these biological ultimatums and that would make possible some very serious serious iatrogenic murder

11:20.600 --> 11:28.600
People being ventilated that could talk people given remdesivir when that may be good for nothing

11:29.600 --> 11:37.600
Untreated secondary pneumonia and mass for a couple months three months a year depending on how long this and where he looked

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
Plus this idea of shutting society down which we can never let them do again

11:43.600 --> 11:57.600
And so I believe that we have been brought into this with this very carefully sculpted narrative so it would feel like we were free thinking but we weren't actually free thinking

11:58.600 --> 12:03.600
It would feel like people were really fighting in front of the Senate but they weren't actually really fighting in front of the Senate

12:04.600 --> 12:08.600
It would feel like emails were being redacted but they weren't actually being redacted

12:09.600 --> 12:15.600
It would feel like slack messages were being released but they weren't actually being leaked

12:16.600 --> 12:22.600
It would feel like Pfizer executives were being filmed in restaurants but it's not really true

12:24.600 --> 12:35.600
And so it's this kind of controlled narrative that has allowed us to feel as though we were solving the mystery that were teenagers sleuths solving the mystery

12:36.600 --> 12:51.600
That was what drastic was all about was about getting a bunch of people together to create a momentum behind the scenes that could be blamed could be credited with the lab leak hypothesis

12:52.600 --> 13:15.600
And that lab leak hypothesis is based on this idea that in the scientific literature pandemic potential has already been described in reviews and described in the introductions and the discussions of papers have to do with coronaviruses and bats

13:16.600 --> 13:23.600
That have to do with passage of coronaviruses in cell culture that have to do with flu virus

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
Passaging in animals

13:26.600 --> 13:30.600
And have to do with recombinant viruses in the laboratory

13:31.600 --> 13:38.600
And all of these stories have allowed them to scare the living daylights out of us by pretending that they were covering up a lab leak

13:39.600 --> 13:50.600
And we're so scared we're about to give up our sovereign rights over our bodies over our babies in the name of public health I guess

13:53.600 --> 14:06.600
And so I've been trying to dissect the people map of this because I think that wittingly or unwittingly we've got to wake people up that can be woken up to the idea that maybe a lot of this mystery was a hoax

14:07.600 --> 14:11.600
Maybe a lot of this biology was a mythology

14:13.600 --> 14:16.600
And maybe the mythology started a lot earlier than 2020

14:19.600 --> 14:24.600
And so that's what we've been working on here. I think the people in green are probably doing pretty well

14:24.600 --> 14:28.600
I think the people in yellow might be able to be converted maybe I don't know possibly

14:29.600 --> 14:36.600
And I think the people in red are so committed that I don't know what to say so I got to assume that they might be lost

14:36.600 --> 14:39.600
Or I don't know what but we maybe can convert them to

14:41.600 --> 14:46.600
But some way or another we've got to break out of this very limited spectrum of discussion that involves

14:46.600 --> 14:51.600
There was a novel virus and that we had to do something and that the mRNA did something

14:51.600 --> 14:55.600
Whether it's pushing the virus around now or whether it's saved people before

14:56.600 --> 14:59.600
And it was getting a function so it could come again

14:59.600 --> 15:03.600
We've got to push our way out of this trap

15:03.600 --> 15:08.600
Because this faith is so limiting it will trap our grandchildren

15:09.600 --> 15:13.600
This story about a novel virus that was released in 2020

15:13.600 --> 15:18.600
So if you remember I was a mild-mannered patch clamp physiologist

15:18.600 --> 15:23.600
I used to make recordings from two or more neurons at the same time

15:24.600 --> 15:26.600
And see if they were connected

15:27.600 --> 15:31.600
And I did that in mouse and rat brain slices

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
Very mundane

15:34.600 --> 15:36.600
Niche work

15:36.600 --> 15:41.600
Only you know you don't impress people with that at a coffee or at a

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
Dinner party very often

15:44.600 --> 15:49.600
But I have publications that go back to the year 2000 or 2001

15:49.600 --> 15:51.600
Maybe 2002

15:52.600 --> 15:57.600
I've worked in Switzerland doing this. I've learned this from a guy by the name of Henry Markram

15:57.600 --> 16:04.600
Who was actually the guy who was the head of the the blue brain project and the human brain project

16:04.600 --> 16:07.600
I believe was it called the human brain project?

16:08.600 --> 16:14.600
Anyway, it was a billion dollar a billion dollar ten year grant in the EU

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
It was very controversial

16:16.600 --> 16:19.600
I'm not saying that that guy was some kind of super smart wizard guy

16:19.600 --> 16:24.600
He was actually maybe a little a little smart and a little bit of sales money

16:24.600 --> 16:30.600
He now works or he actually started the frontiers line of scientific journals

16:31.600 --> 16:38.600
But there's no question he was a visionary in terms of thinking about how we could think about solving the problem of the brain

16:38.600 --> 16:41.600
I'm not saying that he made tremendous progress in that direction

16:41.600 --> 16:45.600
But he made a lot of progress in getting people to think big about trying to do that

16:45.600 --> 16:50.600
And here's me building a rig in Norway or working on my rig in Norway

16:51.600 --> 16:58.600
Where I had a co-authorship on a science paper and a nature paper and so it's like a nature neuroscience paper

16:59.600 --> 17:03.600
It's just to say that I had a decent career. I mean I wasn't a

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
Flunky

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
And I came to

17:07.600 --> 17:12.600
Pittsburgh kind of resigning to the fact that I was going to be a middle a middle guy

17:13.600 --> 17:18.600
And I might not be the head of the department ever but I did I thought I deserved my own lab

17:18.600 --> 17:24.600
I thought I could definitely have my own lab and so I was thinking I was going to write a grant and get some money eventually

17:26.600 --> 17:30.600
And so I had this YouTube channel and on this YouTube channel

17:30.600 --> 17:37.600
I was doing neuroscience and then I started on February 21st is my third ride where I was talking about COVID-19

17:38.600 --> 17:43.600
And here I'm giving credit to Harvard to the big house because you know Harvard to the big house was the guy that

17:44.600 --> 17:48.600
Oops, sorry about that that was here. I'm giving credit to Harvard to the big house because

17:49.600 --> 17:53.600
It was his blog that really got me started on this and made me realize wow wait

17:54.600 --> 17:59.600
That's right. They did enrich avian flu at Erasmus while I was there. That's a little weird

18:00.600 --> 18:02.600
I know all about this stuff

18:03.600 --> 18:08.600
And so it got me really fired up and I actually did lots of videos on it. I did one here this one on the bottom

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
I think is about

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
Yeah the proximal origin paper

18:14.600 --> 18:17.600
And then a year later vanity fair

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
And the Newsweek and Tucker Carlson covered it

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
And if you listen carefully to what Tucker Carlson is going to say

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
He's going to say something about a guy by the name of Jamie Metzel

18:30.600 --> 18:35.600
He's going to answer the letter to censor anyone on social media who mentioned the possibility of a lab leak

18:36.600 --> 18:40.600
It can't be true the lancet says it's not true 27 eminent scientists say it's not true

18:41.600 --> 18:44.600
Only a few scientists in the face of all of this dare to speak up

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
One of them was called Jill Dumanov

18:48.600 --> 18:53.600
He formed a group of researchers called Drastic that's an acronym for decentralized radical autonomous search team

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
Something that all scientists should be

18:57.600 --> 19:03.600
And so now what you see here is one Jamie Metzel who you heard that Tucker Carlson said was one of the founders

19:04.600 --> 19:08.600
I think that if I had to just bet based on what I've read and logic

19:09.600 --> 19:13.600
I would bet it's most likely this was an accidental leak

19:14.600 --> 19:21.600
And so now what you see here is one Jamie Metzel who you heard that Tucker Carlson said was one of the founders

19:21.600 --> 19:29.600
Jamie Metzel who you heard that Tucker Carlson said was one of the founding members of drastic and he was never in drastic

19:30.600 --> 19:35.600
And the guy that he said did start drastic was a guy who joined drastic about a year after it was formed

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
And he was also not originally in drastic

19:40.600 --> 19:47.600
So at the time the guy who actually started drastic or the Twitter account that actually started drastic is Billy Bo Stix

19:48.600 --> 19:52.600
And if you know anything about Twitter if you start a direct messaging group

19:53.600 --> 20:00.600
There's only one account that is the curator of who gets in and who gets out and that's Billy Bo Stix

20:01.600 --> 20:04.600
So before drastic split in half

20:05.600 --> 20:12.600
And before I spoke out about transfection I was still all on board with this is probably a lab leak

20:13.600 --> 20:16.600
And then this story comes out a year later

20:17.600 --> 20:20.600
And now I'm out of drastic, drastic is split

20:21.600 --> 20:25.600
And they talk about this on Tucker Carlson

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
And they say that these two guys are the start of drastic

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
Now what's weird about it is is Jamie Metzel is not nobody

20:34.600 --> 20:39.600
He's a former national security council staff member of the Clinton administration

20:40.600 --> 20:43.600
It's a pretty trusted Clinton individual

20:48.600 --> 20:58.600
And I think that's really really important in terms of putting him in place because if we go to Jamie Metzel

20:59.600 --> 21:03.600
Before the pandemic and then go to Jamie Metzel about a year into the pandemic

21:04.600 --> 21:11.600
I think we're going to see some very big parallels between people like him and Peter Teal

21:12.600 --> 21:16.600
And Eric Weinstein and Brett Weinstein and Elon Musk

21:17.600 --> 21:20.600
And everyone else who might call themselves a futurist

21:21.600 --> 21:25.600
Which usually are subtitled like futurist transhumanist

21:27.600 --> 21:29.600
So I've got a couple videos picked out here

21:30.600 --> 21:33.600
I'm going to watch the one first that is from 2019

21:35.600 --> 21:38.600
And then we'll watch the one from 2021

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
I might have to make myself a little tan here

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
Open any major news source and what do you see?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
We see Trump, we see Brexit

21:52.600 --> 21:56.600
But 30 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now

21:57.600 --> 22:00.600
People are going to look back at now and they're not going to be talking about Trump

22:01.600 --> 22:03.600
They're not going to be talking about Brexit

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
What they are going to be saying is that now was the moment

22:07.600 --> 22:10.600
When after 3.8 billion years of evolving

22:11.600 --> 22:15.600
By the set of rules we called our winning evolution of random mutation and natural selection

22:16.600 --> 22:22.600
This was the moment when our species took increasingly active control of our own evolution

22:23.600 --> 22:27.600
Think about that for a moment, think about how profound that is

22:28.600 --> 22:33.600
When Watson and Crick identified the double helix structure of DNA in the 1950s

22:34.600 --> 22:38.600
What they were doing was identifying that the book of life had a structure

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
And the structure was the famous double helix

22:42.600 --> 22:46.600
And with the fruition of the Human Genome Project in 2003

22:47.600 --> 22:50.600
What we were doing was identifying that the book of life could be read

22:50.600 --> 22:54.600
In the A's and C's and T's and G's of genetic code

22:55.600 --> 22:59.600
And now at the dawn of the age of human precision gene editing

23:00.600 --> 23:05.600
With tools like CRISPR we're recognizing that the book of life can be written

23:06.600 --> 23:11.600
When we think about technologies that are readable and writable and hackable

23:12.600 --> 23:14.600
We think about information technology

23:15.600 --> 23:18.600
As a matter of fact we recognize the variability of our IT so much

23:19.600 --> 23:25.600
That we have a built-in assumption that every new version of our iPhone is going to be better and stronger than the last one

23:26.600 --> 23:31.600
And yet for some reason we think about our biology as being fixed

23:32.600 --> 23:39.600
But why do we think that? Somehow we evolved from being single cell organisms almost 4 billion years ago to this

23:40.600 --> 23:44.600
And we've only been homo sapiens for around 300,000 years

23:45.600 --> 23:47.600
And yet it's all we know

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
But with these tools of the genetic revolution

23:51.600 --> 23:54.600
We are going to be able to fundamentally transform our biology

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
So don't misunderstand what I'm saying here

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
This is a person preaching

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
He's selling a faith

24:06.600 --> 24:09.600
He's not trying to convince you of what's real

24:10.600 --> 24:12.600
He's trying to convince you of what's possible

24:13.600 --> 24:17.600
And that's what's very very important to understand here

24:18.600 --> 24:20.600
These people know that we're not there yet

24:21.600 --> 24:23.600
These people know that we may never get there

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
But that's not the idea

24:26.600 --> 24:30.600
The idea is to sell there as a destination worth aiming at

24:31.600 --> 24:37.600
And that it's so worth aiming at that we can break a few eggs when we make that omelet

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
That's really what we're talking about here

24:41.600 --> 24:46.600
And all of these people smiling with their perfect delivery in person

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
Go out to dinner after these presentations

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
And talk with the insiders about how this will be achieved

24:54.600 --> 25:00.600
And it is not the kind of utopian sort of solution that you think it is

25:01.600 --> 25:05.600
It is a malevolent application of us and them

25:06.600 --> 25:12.600
And this, you know, the means justifies, the ends justify the means rather

25:13.600 --> 25:16.600
And it is as malevolent as you can imagine

25:18.600 --> 25:22.600
And this is going to create wondrous, amazing opportunities for us

25:22.600 --> 25:26.600
Every time a young child dies of a terrible genetic disease

25:27.600 --> 25:30.600
We recognize that as a crime against potential

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
But when a 90 year old gets dementia

25:34.600 --> 25:36.600
That's a crime against potential too

25:36.600 --> 25:39.600
Think of the investment that we have made in people

25:39.600 --> 25:44.600
You have a whole life of developing your knowledge and your wisdom and your relationships

25:44.600 --> 25:47.600
And when that goes away, we all suffer

25:47.600 --> 25:51.600
And we are developing tools that are going to expand our humanity

25:51.600 --> 25:54.600
Expand our potential and we need to welcome that

25:55.600 --> 25:58.600
But we also need to recognize that there are dangers associated

25:59.600 --> 26:03.600
With developing these Promethean technologies that are giving us powers

26:03.600 --> 26:06.600
That in the past, we have attributed to our gods

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
What does Promethean hear mean? I believe it means

26:09.600 --> 26:13.600
Isn't that the guy who like flew too close to the sun got it burnt?

26:14.600 --> 26:17.600
Something like that, Prometheus was the guy who like went for fire

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
And then he flew, I think that's what it is, isn't it?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.600
So it's like now we're gaining powers that we shouldn't have

26:24.600 --> 26:27.600
Or powers of the gods, you know?

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
Crazy

26:31.600 --> 26:34.600
Prometheus brought us fire, right? Okay, yeah, okay, sorry

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
The power to make and we...

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
Stole fire from the gods and gave it to the people

26:38.600 --> 26:41.600
And that comes with the generous food to the sun

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Thank you

26:43.600 --> 26:47.600
Because the genetics revolution is coming very, very quickly

26:47.600 --> 26:49.600
And we aren't ready

26:49.600 --> 26:53.600
And in order to make sure that we optimize the incredible benefits

26:53.600 --> 26:56.600
That are coming our way, we've got to be

26:56.600 --> 27:01.600
So there are three key areas where we are all going to be feeling

27:01.600 --> 27:04.600
The impact of this fundamental change

27:04.600 --> 27:07.600
The first and probably the most obvious is in our healthcare

27:07.600 --> 27:10.600
When people think about genetics now, they think about healthcare

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
For some very good reasons

27:12.600 --> 27:17.600
But if this is genetics, it's going to fundamentally transform the entire paradigm of healthcare

27:17.600 --> 27:22.600
But how different is this than what we heard Robert Malone say in that interview with

27:22.600 --> 27:26.600
On the Tommy podcast

27:26.600 --> 27:30.600
Where he was describing the fact that when he was in grad school

27:30.600 --> 27:35.600
He thought that within ten years there would be a geneticist at every hospital

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
Using retroviruses to cure genetic diseases

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
And that's why he wanted to go into retroviruses

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
Do you remember this?

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
So if that's the case

27:45.600 --> 27:47.600
That's really what we're talking about

27:47.600 --> 27:49.600
How different is that than now?

27:49.600 --> 27:55.600
What this guy's saying that in ten years genetics is going to cure genetic diseases

27:55.600 --> 27:57.600
It's no different at all

27:57.600 --> 28:02.600
They're talking about the same long distance destination

28:02.600 --> 28:04.600
The same end of the rainbow

28:04.600 --> 28:08.600
That Robert Malone was enticed by all those years ago

28:08.600 --> 28:11.600
And we haven't gotten anywhere

28:11.600 --> 28:16.600
Realistically with regard to actually being able to usefully augment that system

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
We have not

28:18.600 --> 28:24.600
We're still just trying to find ways to augment it where it doesn't implode

28:24.600 --> 28:27.600
And so far we don't have those

28:27.600 --> 28:31.600
And that's the real truth of this

28:31.600 --> 28:37.600
We have to come to, I think we have to come to terms with the fact that these people have been selling this

28:37.600 --> 28:39.600
For a very very long time

28:39.600 --> 28:42.600
And they're going to continue to sell it for a very very long time

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
Because the only thing they've got

28:44.600 --> 28:47.600
Is that well if we collect the data

28:47.600 --> 28:49.600
Maybe an AI will solve it

28:49.600 --> 28:56.600
And so the solution is to collect as much data as possible from everyone

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
It's just

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
It doesn't have to be smart

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
It doesn't have to make sense

29:02.600 --> 29:05.600
But this is the sales pitch

29:05.600 --> 29:09.600
And it combines the mythology of AI

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
With the mythology of genetics

29:12.600 --> 29:15.600
And the mythology of our mastery of biology

29:15.600 --> 29:19.600
And the mythology of our mastery of protein folding

29:19.600 --> 29:24.600
And the mythology of our ability to understand how it all works together

29:27.600 --> 29:30.600
Right now, when you go see a doctor

29:30.600 --> 29:34.600
You are treated based on the principles of generalized medicine

29:34.600 --> 29:40.600
Meaning you are treated because you are a human with an end of about 7 billion

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
But that is going to change

29:42.600 --> 29:46.600
Because as we were able to look under the hood of each individual human

29:46.600 --> 29:51.600
Your treatment is going to be based on the individual biology of you

29:51.600 --> 29:53.600
And that's why when you take a drug

29:53.600 --> 29:57.600
It's not going to be a drug that works on average for humans

29:57.600 --> 30:00.600
It's going to be a drug that works potentially for you

30:00.600 --> 30:03.600
Based on specific knowledge of your own biology

30:03.600 --> 30:05.600
So there you set it very carefully

30:05.600 --> 30:07.600
It works potentially for you

30:07.600 --> 30:11.600
Based on your specific biology and prediction made about it

30:11.600 --> 30:14.600
It's wonderfully

30:14.600 --> 30:19.600
Exactly on point for what Mark Koolak has been saying for a long time

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
Which is they want to go to personalized medicine

30:22.600 --> 30:25.600
Because then they can't really test anything anymore

30:25.600 --> 30:29.600
And so first they are transitioning to you to the idea

30:30.600 --> 30:34.600
The transfection and transformation with adenovirus

30:34.600 --> 30:39.600
Is potentially a completely safe and proven methodology

30:39.600 --> 30:43.600
And so swapping in and out like a cassette

30:43.600 --> 30:47.600
The RNA or the DNA that's in that gene application

30:47.600 --> 30:51.600
Could result in endless different therapies

30:51.600 --> 30:55.600
That could be specifically designed for you

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
Maybe we could create a gene therapy that would make your muscles grow

31:01.600 --> 31:03.600
And your fat go away

31:03.600 --> 31:08.600
Maybe we could make a gene therapy that would make your skin less wrinkly

31:08.600 --> 31:14.600
Or a gene therapy that would solve any of the other myriad of problems

31:14.600 --> 31:17.600
That could be solved in other ways

31:17.600 --> 31:20.600
Nutrition exercise

31:20.600 --> 31:24.600
But could also be solved with a gene therapy

31:24.600 --> 31:28.600
With a transfection or a transformation

31:28.600 --> 31:32.600
And if it's personalized for you and it doesn't work

31:32.600 --> 31:34.600
Well, you know, that's the role of the dice

31:34.600 --> 31:37.600
Personalized medicine will get better in the future

31:37.600 --> 31:39.600
We should collect all the data we can

31:39.600 --> 31:42.600
So the next time we do it, it's better

31:44.600 --> 31:49.600
And the foundation of that biology will be your sequence genome

31:49.600 --> 31:52.600
Which will be part of your electronic health record

31:53.600 --> 31:55.600
So what's that going to mean?

31:55.600 --> 32:00.600
Well, as more and more of us have our sequence genome

32:00.600 --> 32:05.600
Our genome's sequenced as part of this transition from generalized to precision healthcare

32:05.600 --> 32:10.600
We're going to have millions and more of us have our sequence genome

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Our genome's sequenced as part of this transition

32:12.600 --> 32:15.600
And generalized to precision healthcare

32:15.600 --> 32:18.600
We're going to have millions, then hundreds of millions

32:18.600 --> 32:24.600
And within 10 years, about 2 billion people will have had their whole genome sequenced

32:24.600 --> 32:28.600
Are you surprised to hear him say this?

32:28.600 --> 32:32.600
Because I've been saying at the end of every stream for about a year now

32:32.600 --> 32:35.600
That's the whole reason

32:35.600 --> 32:39.600
That they're running out of time to sample as many people as are available right now

32:39.600 --> 32:44.600
And if they have their plan in a few generations, there won't be this many people

32:44.600 --> 32:49.600
And if they have their plan in a few generations, we will never have this many people again

32:49.600 --> 32:52.600
We're never going to make this mistake again

32:54.600 --> 32:56.600
But as long as they're all here

32:56.600 --> 33:00.600
And as long as they're not going anywhere for the next generation or so

33:00.600 --> 33:06.600
Why don't we invert sovereign rights over our citizens

33:06.600 --> 33:12.600
The sovereign right of our citizens into the sovereign right of the state over the citizens

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
The ownership of them

33:14.600 --> 33:17.600
Their duty to the system

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
Like communism

33:19.600 --> 33:24.600
Where your data and your medical data, you owe it to the state

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
You owe it to your community

33:26.600 --> 33:29.600
It would be selfish of you to ask for anything for that

33:31.600 --> 33:33.600
That's where we're going

33:34.600 --> 33:38.600
They want databases and they want to make them available to as many people as possible

33:38.600 --> 33:41.600
That can make as much money off of them as possible

33:41.600 --> 33:48.600
And they want you to buy into it under the pretense that eventually it'll be all good for you too

33:48.600 --> 33:53.600
Even though we're the only ones who ever have to pay into the system

33:54.600 --> 33:57.600
Then with the genotypic information, what our genes say

33:57.600 --> 34:03.600
And the phenotypic information of how those genes are expressed over the course of our lives

34:03.600 --> 34:11.600
And using big data analytic tools, we are going to be able to decipher more and more of the secrets of the genome

34:11.600 --> 34:17.600
And that is very quickly going to transform our healthcare from the paradigm of precision medicine

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
To predictive medicine

34:19.600 --> 34:23.600
Right now, what we call health care is really sick care

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
You go to your doctor with a symptom

34:26.600 --> 34:33.600
But maybe that symptom has been germinating in your body for 10 years, 20 years, maybe your whole life

34:33.600 --> 34:39.600
And maybe when you go to see your doctor, it's so late in the process, your doctor can't do anything

34:39.600 --> 34:45.600
But what if, when you're taking your child home from the nursery after just being born

34:45.600 --> 34:50.600
The doctor says, here's your child, take him home, but just FYI

34:51.600 --> 34:56.600
Your child has a 70% greater than average chance of getting early onset Parkinson's

34:56.600 --> 35:00.600
Or familial Alzheimer's or type 1 diabetes

35:00.600 --> 35:04.600
Right now, you say, oh my God, why are you telling me this? This is torture

35:04.600 --> 35:07.600
But it's actually really useful information

35:07.600 --> 35:12.600
If you knew that your child had an increased susceptibility to type 1 diabetes

35:12.600 --> 35:16.600
Wouldn't you want to instill in him or her

35:16.600 --> 35:20.600
A sense of, a series of habits of x

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
Now what you really need to hear here

35:24.600 --> 35:29.600
Is that this is the mythology, this is the religion of p-values

35:29.600 --> 35:33.600
It's the idea that we measured a lot of people

35:33.600 --> 35:37.600
This is presumably after we measured billions of people

35:37.600 --> 35:41.600
Right? That's the hypothetical here

35:41.600 --> 35:43.600
Because so far we haven't

35:43.600 --> 35:48.600
But if we measured billions of people, we had their genotype from the very beginning

35:48.600 --> 35:54.600
And then we looked at who made it to the end of the line with and without Parkinson's disease

35:54.600 --> 36:00.600
That billion, two billion people, we would have a much better idea of what genes

36:00.600 --> 36:04.600
associate with the formation of Parkinson's

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
Much better than we do now

36:06.600 --> 36:10.600
And hypothetically, as Jamie's trying to tell you, if we had enough of this data

36:10.600 --> 36:13.600
Well, we'd be able to tell you it right from the birth

36:13.600 --> 36:18.600
Just look at the genotype and then say, oh yeah, you have this, you have this, you have this

36:18.600 --> 36:23.600
And it's based on this almost unquestionable data set

36:23.600 --> 36:25.600
Or is it?

36:25.600 --> 36:32.600
You see, the genetic variation found in the human population right now is so great

36:32.600 --> 36:39.600
I think it's a problem that none of us can really fully get our minds around

36:39.600 --> 36:44.600
And it's one of the reasons why I think in this race

36:44.600 --> 36:51.600
In this mythological race that Jamie Metzel believes that America and West are involved in

36:51.600 --> 36:56.600
That China is involved in, that Russia is involved in

36:56.600 --> 36:59.600
That in this hypothetical race

36:59.600 --> 37:04.600
Ethnicities that are more homogenous

37:04.600 --> 37:09.600
Present an easier target for understanding how the genome works

37:09.600 --> 37:13.600
And understanding how genetic disease manifests

37:13.600 --> 37:18.600
The more genetically diverse your population is, the more alleles

37:18.600 --> 37:22.600
And variations on those alleles that are present in your population

37:22.600 --> 37:27.600
The more difficult it will be to make strong correlations between clusters of genes

37:27.600 --> 37:33.600
Their expression and the phenotype that emerges 20 or 40 years later

37:33.600 --> 37:39.600
And so I think one of the things that's been hyped in the back room with lots of really smart people

37:39.600 --> 37:43.600
Is that the Chinese could be very far ahead of us

37:43.600 --> 37:48.600
Because their population is so genetically homogenous relative to ours

37:48.600 --> 37:57.600
And that genetic homogeny allows them to make great strides in identifying genetic weaknesses, genetic whatever's

37:57.600 --> 38:02.600
That potentially could be repaired with genetic technologies

38:02.600 --> 38:08.600
Now again, these are all hypothetical crazy ideas that I do not think we need to be worried about right now

38:08.600 --> 38:12.600
But, from the perspective of Scooby-Doo-like stories

38:12.600 --> 38:17.600
Stories that you need to tell people in suits in order to make them walk in the right direction

38:17.600 --> 38:21.600
And type on the right page and sign on the right line

38:21.600 --> 38:24.600
These stories are fantastic

38:24.600 --> 38:29.600
And I think Jamie Metzel is one of these people who is like in between

38:29.600 --> 38:32.600
The smart people and the bureaucrats

38:32.600 --> 38:40.600
And so he often gives these talks where, you know, he's the one who gets to go to the science conference every once in a while

38:40.600 --> 38:45.600
He's the one who gets to go talk to somebody, but he doesn't know much more than anybody else does

38:45.600 --> 38:51.600
He's just able to play this role of a guy who's really fired up about the future

38:51.600 --> 38:55.600
Really fired up about the future technologies, the future changes

38:55.600 --> 38:59.600
The things that are just around the corner

38:59.600 --> 39:03.600
You know, like when we have two billion people sequenced

39:03.600 --> 39:06.600
Exercise and diet?

39:06.600 --> 39:10.600
If you were at risk or your child was at risk for some terrible disease

39:10.600 --> 39:15.600
Wouldn't you want to keep an eye on what progress was being made in treating that disease?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.600
Wouldn't you want more tests?

39:17.600 --> 39:22.600
If you knew you had a greater susceptibility to breast cancer at some point in the future

39:22.600 --> 39:26.600
Everybody is going to want this information

39:26.600 --> 39:30.600
But as we move toward universal sequencing

39:30.600 --> 39:33.600
Our understanding of genetics and...

39:33.600 --> 39:36.600
As we move toward universal sequencing, which means what?

39:36.600 --> 39:40.600
It means sequencing every baby that's born

39:40.600 --> 39:44.600
Genomics is going to move way beyond the realm of healthcare

39:44.600 --> 39:50.600
And that's the second critical application will be through direct-to-consumer genetic information

39:50.600 --> 39:53.600
That has nothing to do with healthcare

39:53.600 --> 39:56.600
We don't have a disease genome

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
We don't have a healthcare genome

39:58.600 --> 40:00.600
We have a human genome

40:00.600 --> 40:03.600
And that means that as we understand the secrets of the genome

40:03.600 --> 40:07.600
We aren't just going to understand more about our disease states

40:07.600 --> 40:13.600
We are going to understand more about the essence of what it means to be a human being

40:13.600 --> 40:17.600
Our most intimate traits the way our brains function

40:17.600 --> 40:19.600
Our personality styles

40:19.600 --> 40:21.600
Anything that has a genetic component

40:21.600 --> 40:26.600
And there certainly are many traits that are mostly genetic and partly genetic

40:26.600 --> 40:31.600
We will be able to increasingly understand the genetic component of those traits

40:31.600 --> 40:33.600
So that's going to mean a lot

40:33.600 --> 40:39.600
Because remember taking your kid home from the nursery with the information about disease risks

40:39.600 --> 40:43.600
What if you have information that your kid has a better than average potential

40:43.600 --> 40:47.600
At being amazing at abstract math

40:47.600 --> 40:51.600
Or sprinting or having an outgoing personality

40:51.600 --> 40:55.600
Will you send them to drama school because you have that information

40:55.600 --> 40:59.600
How will that affect how we think about what it means to be a human being

40:59.600 --> 41:01.600
How we think about parenting

41:01.600 --> 41:06.600
And then the third and most profound application of these technologies

41:06.600 --> 41:13.600
Will be in a fundamental transformation in the way that our species reproduces

41:13.600 --> 41:17.600
Right now about two percent of children in the United States

41:17.600 --> 41:21.600
Are born through a process called in vitro fertilization IVF

41:21.600 --> 41:25.600
It's about ten percent in Denmark

41:25.600 --> 41:29.600
And now when you have IVF, when a woman has IVF

41:29.600 --> 41:33.600
These embryos, the pre implanted embryos

41:33.600 --> 41:39.600
Can be screened for mostly single gene mutation diseases and disorders

41:39.600 --> 41:42.600
Things like TASACs and sickle cell disease

41:42.600 --> 41:44.600
Chromosomal abnormalities

41:44.600 --> 41:49.600
And simple traits like hair color and eye color and of course gender

41:49.600 --> 41:54.600
And all of that is in some instances controversial

41:54.600 --> 42:00.600
But when we have more and more of this information about complex genetics

42:00.600 --> 42:05.600
It's not going to be making selections based on just this limited information

42:05.600 --> 42:08.600
We already have the ability to rank

42:08.600 --> 42:11.600
Let's say, let's call them 15 pre implanted embryos

42:11.600 --> 42:14.600
From likely tallest to likely shortest

42:14.600 --> 42:19.600
Within about ten years we're going to have the ability to rank them

42:19.600 --> 42:23.600
From likely highest genetic component of IQ

42:24.600 --> 42:28.600
Now there he was again, in ten years we're going to be able to rank the embryos

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
Based on genetic component of IQ

42:31.600 --> 42:33.600
Within ten years

42:33.600 --> 42:40.600
Just like Robert Malone thought, within ten years we would be having a geneticist in every hospital

42:40.600 --> 42:43.600
Using retroviruses to cure genetic diseases

42:43.600 --> 42:46.600
And that was in the eighties

42:46.600 --> 42:48.600
So forty years later

42:48.600 --> 42:53.600
And so I would caution you very much

42:53.600 --> 43:00.600
This guy is asking you to believe that a mythological concoction of data plus AI

43:00.600 --> 43:04.600
Is going to give us the keys to the book of life

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
Make no mistake about it

43:06.600 --> 43:14.600
He's using those words because he knows exactly how sacred the things that he's talking about are

43:14.600 --> 43:17.600
The concepts that he's talking about are

43:17.600 --> 43:25.600
And yet making fun of the idea that at some point there is a sacred complexity that you just can't cross

43:25.600 --> 43:29.600
There is a sacred complexity that we don't understand yet

43:29.600 --> 43:34.600
I'm going to sit here and say that we might not understand it in three generations

43:34.600 --> 43:39.600
But when we come to understand it, it will be a much more humble realization

43:39.600 --> 43:44.600
Than what is being displayed on these screens in the last three years

43:44.600 --> 43:50.600
This arrogant malevolence

43:50.600 --> 43:57.600
You need to see it for what it is because this is a guy, again, who served in the Clinton administration

43:57.600 --> 44:00.600
Who's talked at a lot of these things

44:00.600 --> 44:03.600
It says in the chat that he's a friend of Elon Musk

44:03.600 --> 44:10.600
And maybe even was a guy who worked for PayPal or as an owner or whatever

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
So it's a real dude

44:12.600 --> 44:18.600
That before the pandemic is talking about how we should be collecting the genetic data from everybody sooner or later

44:18.600 --> 44:21.600
Exactly what we've been saying

44:21.600 --> 44:26.600
And then before the pandemic, now during the pandemic in the first few months

44:26.600 --> 44:32.600
Sorry, the first year Tucker Carlson blames him or gives him credit

44:32.600 --> 44:37.600
For being one of the first people to speak out on the lab league

44:37.600 --> 44:42.600
And Vanity Fair says that he's part of drastic, which he wasn't

44:42.600 --> 44:45.600
What the hell is going on here?

44:45.600 --> 44:53.600
The really weird thing is that Billy Bo sticks in, the guy who started drastic and we still don't know who he is

44:53.600 --> 44:59.600
Foreign national, not foreign national, hell if I know, it could be Jamie Metzel

44:59.600 --> 45:08.600
But he wasn't very upset that nobody in drastic actually got any credit in any of those articles

45:08.600 --> 45:12.600
Extraordinary times, ladies and gentlemen, because these are the players

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
These are the actors

45:14.600 --> 45:17.600
And it's not a few of them, it's many

45:17.600 --> 45:24.600
Many, an army of people has been carefully hurting us along

45:25.600 --> 45:34.600
I mean, I was just telling this to someone the other day, how many of you have seen the new plan to the apes movies?

45:34.600 --> 45:37.600
Not the old ones, but the new ones

45:37.600 --> 45:40.600
The new ones are about a virus

45:40.600 --> 45:46.600
If you watch the first one, which maybe is called Dawn or Rise of the Planet, I don't know which one it is, I think it's Dawn

45:46.600 --> 45:49.600
Rise, whichever one

45:49.600 --> 45:57.600
The first one, there are six different references in the movie to antibodies and their ability to stop a virus

45:57.600 --> 46:04.600
The second movie opens with a two-minute sequence where a virus is spreading around the world and kills all the people

46:07.600 --> 46:12.600
They have been telling us this on the X-Files and on the Simpsons

46:13.600 --> 46:17.600
And you know it because you've been seeing those videos being circulated

46:17.600 --> 46:22.600
But they've also been telling it to us at fancy conferences

46:22.600 --> 46:27.600
At big Google sponsored TED Talks

46:27.600 --> 46:34.600
They've been telling it to us in secret meetings for all the bureaucracy of the United States government

46:34.600 --> 46:39.600
And for the military and for intelligence agencies

46:39.600 --> 46:46.600
They've been telling us this story about the coming technologies, the coming bioterrorism

46:46.600 --> 46:50.600
The coming things that China is inevitably ahead of us on

46:50.600 --> 46:52.600
Because it's all about data

46:52.600 --> 46:56.600
And more and more and more and more data

46:56.600 --> 47:06.600
And if your data set is really, really, really varied as a high degree of variability like America's data set does

47:06.600 --> 47:10.600
And you need a lot more of it

47:10.600 --> 47:16.600
Or alternatively, we could just wait until China figures it out, I guess

47:16.600 --> 47:20.600
You see, these people know they've been making these stories up

47:20.600 --> 47:25.600
They've been telling these stories and retelling them at campfires for two or three decades now

47:25.600 --> 47:27.600
They're very good at it

47:27.600 --> 47:35.600
It's very enticing to think that human biology, hell, all biology is almost at our fingertips

47:35.600 --> 47:39.600
And there's no need to worry about fuddling with anything

47:39.600 --> 47:44.600
Why don't we just destroy all the microbes in our soil? Because, you know, we don't need those

47:44.600 --> 47:50.600
Why don't we just destroy all the microbes in our gut? Because we don't need those

47:50.600 --> 47:57.600
Why don't we just start changing our stem cells? Because, you know, what's possibly could go wrong

47:57.600 --> 48:00.600
To likely lowest genetic component of IQ

48:00.600 --> 48:04.600
We'll be able to rank likely most outgoing

48:04.600 --> 48:07.600
Again, it's not an entirely genetic trait

48:07.600 --> 48:09.600
To likely least outgoing

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600
You see where this is heading

48:11.600 --> 48:19.600
We are touching the core of what has been the mystery of what it means to be a human being with these technologies

48:19.600 --> 48:23.600
So there's gonna be no mystery anymore, you see? With these technologies

48:23.600 --> 48:27.600
There is no mystery, meaning there is no sacred

48:27.600 --> 48:33.600
It is a fundamental attack on everything that it is to be human

48:33.600 --> 48:37.600
The whole reason why we had respect for everyone

48:37.600 --> 48:42.600
The whole reason why human rights exist all vanishing now

48:42.600 --> 48:45.600
We're nothing but programmable robots

48:45.600 --> 48:51.600
They don't want you to think of yourself as being given a sacred gift

48:51.600 --> 48:54.600
Being the steward of a sacred gift

48:54.600 --> 48:59.600
Having some responsibility for a sacred gift that you were given

48:59.600 --> 49:01.600
They don't want you to think that anymore

49:01.600 --> 49:08.600
They want you to think that you're part of a much bigger thing

49:08.600 --> 49:11.600
And you should surrender yourself to it

49:11.600 --> 49:19.600
But right now, our ability to select embryos is limited by the number of eggs that a human female produces

49:19.600 --> 49:22.600
I mentioned 15, which is the rough average

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
But what if you could have more?

49:24.600 --> 49:28.600
And there is a technology that is already being applied to animals

49:28.600 --> 49:32.600
Of taking an any adult cell, but a skin cell is often the easiest one

49:32.600 --> 49:35.600
And so you take a skin graft

49:35.600 --> 49:39.600
You induce those skin cells into stem cells

49:39.600 --> 49:44.600
Using a process for which Shinyi Yamanaka won the 2012 Nobel Prize

49:44.600 --> 49:48.600
So now you have, let's call it, 10,000 cells

49:48.600 --> 49:52.600
That have been turned skin cells into stem cells

49:52.600 --> 49:55.600
Stem cells then induced into egg precursor cells

49:55.600 --> 49:58.600
And egg precursor cells into eggs

49:58.600 --> 50:02.600
So now you have 10,000 eggs

50:02.600 --> 50:04.600
And you fertilize them with the male sperm

50:04.600 --> 50:08.600
Because there's about a billion sperm cells in every male ejaculation

50:08.600 --> 50:12.600
And now you have 10,000 fertilized eggs

50:12.600 --> 50:16.600
And in a machine you grow them for about five days

50:16.600 --> 50:18.600
You extract a few cells from each

50:18.600 --> 50:22.600
You sequence those cells and the cost of genome sequencing

50:22.600 --> 50:25.600
Has gone down from about a billion dollars in 2003

50:25.600 --> 50:29.600
To about 800 dollars now to negligibley within a decade

50:29.600 --> 50:32.600
So that doesn't cost anything

50:32.600 --> 50:35.600
And then you get a spreadsheet

50:35.600 --> 50:41.600
And in the spreadsheet you have all of the options for your 10,000 embryos

50:41.600 --> 50:45.600
And when you're starting with 10,000 you have a lot of options

50:45.600 --> 50:47.600
How far can we go with this?

50:47.600 --> 50:55.600
Well our ancestors who knew nothing about genetics took proud wild wolves

50:55.600 --> 50:59.600
And turned them into yapping chihuahuas

50:59.600 --> 51:05.600
Imagine how far we can go with the knowledge that we have

51:05.600 --> 51:09.600
About how genetics works and how biology works

51:09.600 --> 51:13.600
We can go a very, very, very long way

51:13.600 --> 51:22.600
And on top of that, then we have these unbelievably power tools of precision gene editing like CRISPR

51:22.600 --> 51:26.600
Many of you know that in 2018 a Chinese scientist

51:26.600 --> 51:29.600
So I'm not really sure what to say about that last little bit

51:29.600 --> 51:36.600
Because he was kind of equating breeding and selection with genetic editing

51:36.600 --> 51:39.600
And it's just not going to work like that

51:39.600 --> 51:44.600
It's really unfortunate but it's just not going to work like that

51:44.600 --> 51:49.600
And it's too much for this presentation for us to talk about it

51:49.600 --> 51:55.600
But it is the same kind of bamboozlement where this really enticing narrative about how we're almost there

51:55.600 --> 51:57.600
And we're at the cusp of all these changes

51:57.600 --> 52:01.600
It's the same narrative they've been telling us since the 80s

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
And the only thing that's come true

52:04.600 --> 52:08.600
Is that it has become cheaper to sequence pure DNA

52:08.600 --> 52:11.600
It has become easier to make pure DNA

52:11.600 --> 52:13.600
And it has become easier to make pure RNA

52:13.600 --> 52:14.600
That's all

52:14.600 --> 52:16.600
Nothing else

52:16.600 --> 52:19.600
And as long as they can make pure quantities of this stuff

52:19.600 --> 52:21.600
They can do some limited things with it

52:21.600 --> 52:29.600
But they can't replace selective breeding in animals

52:29.600 --> 52:32.600
With genetic editing

52:32.600 --> 52:33.600
They can't

52:33.600 --> 52:36.600
And CRISPR has off target effects

52:36.600 --> 52:41.600
So yes you can hit the target but you can also edit other places

52:41.600 --> 52:43.600
So then what?

52:43.600 --> 52:50.600
It's a bacteriologic set of enzymes that was a protective mechanism

52:50.600 --> 52:55.600
And you're using it to edit mammalian genomes

52:55.600 --> 52:57.600
And talking like it's super precise

52:57.600 --> 52:59.600
Which I guess technically it is

52:59.600 --> 53:03.600
But talking as though it does exactly what you want it to do

53:03.600 --> 53:05.600
And you know that it doesn't

53:05.600 --> 53:09.600
And you know that we're not at the cusp of figuring out how to make it not do that

53:09.600 --> 53:12.600
And so it's extraordinary because

53:12.600 --> 53:15.600
Even the editing of DNA with CRISPR

53:15.600 --> 53:18.600
It's not the same as

53:19.600 --> 53:27.600
I get really depressed because it is so sad

53:27.600 --> 53:32.600
That people make such an attempt

53:32.600 --> 53:37.600
To divorce us from what is beautiful about our complexity

53:37.600 --> 53:40.600
What is beautiful about the pattern integrity that we are

53:40.600 --> 53:44.600
We don't understand exactly at all

53:45.600 --> 53:47.600
Even a tiny little bit

53:47.600 --> 53:49.600
Of how a DNA molecule

53:49.600 --> 53:52.600
Can somehow it seems

53:52.600 --> 53:56.600
And code most of the data necessary

53:56.600 --> 54:00.600
To generate and maintain

54:00.600 --> 54:03.600
The pattern integrity that is a mammal

54:03.600 --> 54:05.600
That is a plant

54:05.600 --> 54:07.600
That is a reptile

54:07.600 --> 54:09.600
That is an amphibian

54:11.600 --> 54:13.600
We don't understand it

54:14.600 --> 54:18.600
We have a general idea that this molecule contains codes

54:18.600 --> 54:21.600
And some of those codes are for proteins

54:21.600 --> 54:25.600
And that these pattern integrity are made up of those proteins

54:25.600 --> 54:27.600
We understand that

54:27.600 --> 54:31.600
That's like saying that I understand that my car has an engine

54:31.600 --> 54:34.600
And the engine has moving parts that turn the wheels

54:34.600 --> 54:36.600
And when you push on the pedals

54:36.600 --> 54:39.600
The engine moves faster and the wheels turn

54:40.600 --> 54:44.600
But can I really get in there and do anything about it?

54:44.600 --> 54:46.600
Can I really get in there and

54:46.600 --> 54:49.600
Usefully augment the function of my automobile?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.600
Of course I can't

54:52.600 --> 54:55.600
I can change the oil

54:55.600 --> 54:58.600
I can give myself a sandwich

54:58.600 --> 55:01.600
But I can't usefully augment the way that my immune system works

55:01.600 --> 55:04.600
By injecting something into my muscle

55:04.600 --> 55:08.600
And that's the way that they are planning to usefully augment

55:08.600 --> 55:12.600
A human is injecting something into the embryo

55:12.600 --> 55:17.600
Or injecting DNA into an empty embryo

55:17.600 --> 55:20.600
Or maybe I guess editing babies

55:20.600 --> 55:22.600
Which is ridiculous

55:25.600 --> 55:28.600
And so this is just pure snake oil

55:28.600 --> 55:30.600
In 2019

55:30.600 --> 55:32.600
About the coming genetic revolution

55:32.600 --> 55:34.600
The transhuman revolution

55:34.600 --> 55:38.600
The futuristic revolution of biology

55:41.600 --> 55:44.600
An unethical Chinese scientist, in my view

55:44.600 --> 55:48.600
Was the first person to genetically engineer

55:48.600 --> 55:50.600
Two little girls

55:50.600 --> 55:53.600
So unethical? Well then what are you talking about doing?

55:53.600 --> 55:55.600
And what stage will become ethical?

55:55.600 --> 55:57.600
Any humans

55:57.600 --> 56:02.600
And those children were born in October 2018 in China

56:02.600 --> 56:05.600
But they terrified everybody with those humans, right?

56:05.600 --> 56:06.600
Because we were right

56:06.600 --> 56:09.600
The Chinese are way ahead of us

56:09.600 --> 56:13.600
And they're so ahead of us that man, we better pull the brakes

56:13.600 --> 56:16.600
We need to get rid of this freedom stuff

56:16.600 --> 56:21.600
Because by the time we convince these people to give us their genetic data

56:21.600 --> 56:23.600
The Chinese will rule the world

56:23.600 --> 56:26.600
So it's time to do something

56:26.600 --> 56:29.600
And this was a rogue scientist

56:29.600 --> 56:32.600
But had he even not done what he did

56:32.600 --> 56:34.600
Still, two years from now

56:34.600 --> 56:35.600
Three years from now

56:35.600 --> 56:39.600
We would anyway have had the first application of precision gene editing

56:39.600 --> 56:42.600
To a pre-implanted human embryo

56:42.600 --> 56:44.600
That would have been taken to term

56:44.600 --> 56:47.600
We aren't going to be starting from scratch

56:47.600 --> 56:49.600
And creating babies out of a computer

56:49.600 --> 56:54.600
But we will be making small numbers of gene edits

56:54.600 --> 56:56.600
Whether it's one, two, three edits

56:56.600 --> 56:58.600
Five edits, maybe ten edits

56:58.600 --> 57:03.600
I don't think that we're going to be making 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 gene edits

57:03.600 --> 57:08.600
To a pre-implanted embryo within the next couple of decades

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
And what is that going to mean?

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
Because we are going to make changes

57:12.600 --> 57:18.600
In most cases to eliminate terrible and perhaps deadly risks

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
And people have a gut feeling

57:20.600 --> 57:23.600
Well, it's okay to eliminate risks

57:23.600 --> 57:27.600
But we don't want to do things that feel like enhancement

57:27.600 --> 57:31.600
But there will not be a clear boundary between those two poles

57:31.600 --> 57:35.600
All of life will be in that gray area

57:35.600 --> 57:39.600
Because it is all about perception

57:39.600 --> 57:45.600
And these incredibly powerful tools will exist in the context of us

57:45.600 --> 57:48.600
Of our communities, of our cultures

57:48.600 --> 57:52.600
And we are all different within our societies

57:52.600 --> 57:54.600
People have all kinds of views

57:54.600 --> 57:58.600
Ranging from extreme people with strong religious views

57:58.600 --> 58:02.600
Who have a strong aversion to quote unquote, playing God

58:02.600 --> 58:04.600
To transhumanist biohackers

58:04.600 --> 58:06.600
Who thinks it should be all systems go

58:06.600 --> 58:07.600
And everything in between

58:07.600 --> 58:11.600
People who are religious who have a version to playing God

58:11.600 --> 58:16.600
And then biohackers who say gung ho, let's go

58:16.600 --> 58:22.600
See, this is the dichotomy that's like the lab leak or the natural virus

58:22.600 --> 58:24.600
They give you two bad choices

58:24.600 --> 58:27.600
And then they want you to choose the middle road

58:27.600 --> 58:29.600
You know, we're going to be real careful

58:29.600 --> 58:31.600
We're not going to be crazy like these guys

58:31.600 --> 58:35.600
But we're also not going to be silly like these God freaks

58:37.600 --> 58:41.600
And so the dismissed sacred is gone from the discussion

58:41.600 --> 58:45.600
The dismissed complexity which cannot be boiled down further

58:45.600 --> 58:48.600
Is dismissed from the discussion as if it doesn't exist

58:49.600 --> 58:56.600
And how will societies figure out how to balance those different desires and interests?

58:56.600 --> 58:58.600
We're also different nationally

58:58.600 --> 59:00.600
That there are countries that have strong geo-Christian backgrounds

59:00.600 --> 59:04.600
That may have one view about the permissibility of messing with nature

59:04.600 --> 59:06.600
Other societies may have different views

59:06.600 --> 59:09.600
How do we think about sinking these different views?

59:09.600 --> 59:10.600
And if that isn't hard enough

59:10.600 --> 59:12.600
So what's the scary version of this talk?

59:12.600 --> 59:14.600
The scary version is

59:14.600 --> 59:17.600
That places like China don't have any ethics at all about this

59:17.600 --> 59:20.600
So there are decades ahead of us

59:20.600 --> 59:25.600
And if we don't fundamentally invert the way that our country thinks about this

59:25.600 --> 59:27.600
We aren't going to fall behind

59:27.600 --> 59:29.600
We're going to be left behind

59:31.600 --> 59:33.600
And so we're behind schedule right now

59:33.600 --> 59:36.600
We need to speed this up

59:36.600 --> 59:41.600
And so the only way to speed this up is to set everybody on their heels

59:42.600 --> 59:44.600
To reset everything

59:44.600 --> 59:47.600
And to reset particularly new public health priorities

59:47.600 --> 59:54.600
That in the end will allow us to prioritize the collection of medical and genetic data

59:54.600 --> 59:57.600
Does that sound like a plan to you guys?

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.600
Because that's the only plan that I can come up with

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.600
That can compete with

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.600
Our rival over there that has all of our money

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.600
That has a genetically homogenous population

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.600
And complete control over it

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.600
What are we going to do about that enemy?

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.600
Well, if we're going to reach our transgenic goals

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.600
If we're going to reach our utopian future

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.600
Where we become God humans

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.600
Then I guess we better get the show on the road

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600
Push the button, pandemic time

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.600
We're doing it in a world driven by extreme competition

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.600
We have extreme competition within our communities

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600
I have a friend who is Korean and lives in Seoul

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600
He has 12 students

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
I'm sorry, 12 tutors coming to his house

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.600
Every week to tutor his 11 year old girl

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600
Korea has a law making it a requirement

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.600
That cram schools close every night at 10 p.m.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.600
Because so many people were having their seven and eight year old kids

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.600
Stay out past midnight, seven days a week

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Preparing for exams, they were going to take a decade in the future

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.600
When I asked my friend, if you could sort your pre implanted embryos

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.600
To give your future child a 10 to 15 point IQ boost

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
Would you do it?

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.600
He looked at me like I was insane

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600
Like why would you even ask that question?

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.600
Obviously

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.600
And then I said how about everybody else who are the parents of kids in your school

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.600
And the look on his face didn't change

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.600
And that may be culture specific, subculture specific

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.600
But we have all of these different cultures

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600
And people will have different desires

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600
And if that's not complicated enough

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.600
What happens when different countries have different entire approaches

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600
To using these technologies?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.600
Imagine one country called the United States decides to opt out

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.600
Another country, let's call it China, decides to opt in

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.600
Because it perceives an economic or a competitive or other benefit

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600
What would the opt out country do?

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600
One thing you could imagine, they would say well

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600
We've made our decision, you've made your decision

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600
Let's see how it plays out and we don't know how it would play out

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.600
But people will be afraid of that because what if that other society has some kind of big advantage

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600
That society that's opted out doesn't have?

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.600
What do you do?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600
So you could try to say well we'll try to build a global standard

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.600
Which is a great answer but it's hard to do

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.600
But what if you try to pressure that other country and they don't change?

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.600
Do you make it illegal for your citizens to procreate with people from that other place?

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.600
Do you use force to try to get them to stop?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.600
Imagine all the crazy things humans have gone to war over in our history

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
Is this one?

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600
I don't know, it could be

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.600
And the ethical issues around this are so deeply profound that they hit us all

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.600
What we are talking about is messing with very complex systems

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.600
We don't remotely or fully understand

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600
There are equity issues who has access

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.600
Wait, he's just going to gloss over that, isn't that the most important part?

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.600
I don't know

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.600
But we've seen what happened when European powers, for example, had slightly better weapons

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600
And slightly better ships than everybody else

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600
It led to the colonial era

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.600
What will happen if there are real or perceived differences between people?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.600
And diversity, we think about diversity as a great way to have better workplaces

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600
And universities and universities

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.600
We think about diversity as a great way to have better workplaces

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600
And universities and universities

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.600
We think about diversity as a great way to have better workplaces

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600
And universities and schools

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
But it's something much deeper from an evolutionary perspective

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600
From a Darwinian perspective

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600
Diversity is just random mutation

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
You could say if it weren't for diversity

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.600
We'd still be single cell organisms

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.600
But you'd be wrong

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600
Because if we didn't have diversity

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600
Those single cell organisms could never have survived

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600
Once the environment changed

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.600
Because there's not good or bad in evolution

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.600
There's just suitability for a particular environment

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.600
And diversity is our investment in being ready for a future scenario that we can't predict

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600
And we're going to have to make big decisions

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.600
Before we fully understand the long-term implications of the decisions that we are going to have to make

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.600
We now have a tremendous responsibility

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.600
But also a great opportunity

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.600
To bring our best values to bear

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.600
In shaping this technology that is going to shape us

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600
And I invite you to join me

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600
See, so you have no choice

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.600
Because the technology is coming

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.600
So you might as well step up and bring your best values to it

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.600
It's a really crazy thing to talk about right before the pandemic

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.600
And now here's April 1st, 2021

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600
Kind of ironic

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.600
And a bear breakthrough innovation forum

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.600
And he's giving the keynote address at the beginning

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Of course he's doing it via Zoom

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600
With a funny green backdrop

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.600
Let's just listen to this

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.600
And then we'll, I'm going to take it as an evening

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.600
Because yeah, I already did that show with Brian tonight

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.600
So I'm a little bit more tired than usual

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.600
He's got a blue halo here

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600
And bears are really good company

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
I don't know if you know that or not

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.600
But they make all kinds of things that make people really happy

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.600
I'm delighted to be here with you today

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.600
Because we are at a transition point in human history

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.600
And we are using our incredibly powerful new capabilities

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.600
Of the genetics and biotechnology revolutions

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.600
To renegotiate in profound ways our relationship with the world around us

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.600
Our species now has the increasing ability to recast the code of life

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.600
And the essential question that will determine our future

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600
Is whether or not we can use this power wisely

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.600
Conversations like this are so essential

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.600
Because every one of us and all of our institutions

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.600
Have a critically important role to play in this process

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600
To set the stage for where we are

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.600
It's important to understand the magnitude of this moment in history

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.600
When one of the greatest forces in the universe

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600
Human creativity is being unleashed

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.600
100 years ago, 2 billion people lived on our planet

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600
With a roughly 15% literacy rate

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.600
That means that around 300 million people

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.600
Had the opportunity to fully participate in the world of knowledge

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Shared beyond their immediate communities

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.600
Today there are nearly 8 billion of us

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.600
With an 85% literacy rate

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.600
Meaning 6.5 billion people can share their ideas

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Because we are networked with each other

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Everyone can wake up every morning and solve new problems

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.600
Ending the wasteful redundancy of innovation our ancestors experienced

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.600
Because our technologies are super converging

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.600
With each technological revolution inspiring

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.600
And being inspired by all other technologies

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.600
The tools we are using to understand and interact with the world

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.600
Within and around us are improving at exponential rates

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.600
And because this change is accelerating

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.600
We must continually challenge the evolved practicality of our brains

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.600
To help us understand what's coming

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.600
We must, in other worlds, all start to think

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.600
A little like science fiction writers

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.600
Because we live in a world that will increasingly feel like science fiction

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.600
I would say that he's trying to encourage you to imagine a future that may not be

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.600
In order to change your behavior based on that mythology

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.600
Imagine a future that may not be so that they can change your future

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.600
Based on that mythology, that's what he's doing

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.600
And they've been doing this for decades now

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.600
Where we're just around the corner

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.600
We're going to be able to do everything we always dreamed of doing

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.600
And it'll be like an erector set but for humans

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.600
As exciting as this all is

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.600
It can also be unsettling

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.600
Not least because it feels unnatural to many people

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.600
But we need to remember that much of what we call natural is not fully natural

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.600
At least as experienced by our ancestors

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.600
Our distant ancestors never went hiking in the woods for fun

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.600
Because the woods were full of dangerous predators

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600
They wouldn't recognize almost everything in our supermarkets today

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.600
Including almost all of the fruits, vegetables and animal products

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.600
So the issue for us in our world engineered by our ancestors

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.600
Using the technologies of their day

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.600
Like the then radical biotechnology of agriculture

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.600
Is not technology yes or no

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.600
But technology how best to benefit humanity and our world

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.600
We also need to recognize that while healthcare is a critically important driver

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.600
Of our application of our new genetics and biotechnology capabilities

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.600
This revolution extends far beyond healthcare

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.600
We are moving from a paradigm of generalized medicine

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.600
Based on population averages

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.600
To our new world of personalized or precision healthcare

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.600
Where interventions are made, were not made

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.600
Based on a far deeper understanding of each person's individual biology

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.600
But collecting genetic and broader systems biological information

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.600
As part of our transition to precision medicine

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.600
And placing those data in ever larger and more usable databases

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.600
Along with other biological and life information

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.600
Will allow us to use our increasingly powerful tools of AI and machine learning

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.600
To begin to crack the code of complex life

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600
Ta-da! Let's hear that again

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.600
More use of our transition to precision medicine

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.600
And placing those data in ever larger and more usable databases

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600
Along with other biological and life information

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.600
Will allow us to use our increasingly powerful tools of AI and machine learning

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.600
To begin to crack the code of complex life

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.600
We'll never understand it perfectly

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.600
But even our imperfect knowledge will shift us toward a more predictive model of healthcare

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.600
We'll never understand it perfectly

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.600
But it'll shift our knowledge to a predictive model of healthcare

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600
It's snake oil ladies and gentlemen

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600
They've been doing it for a while

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.600
But they're amping it up now because the pandemic allowed them to do it

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.600
They took the reins of all these industries

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.600
They changed all these industries

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.600
They put a lot of things out of business

01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:00.600
And shifted a lot of this intellectual property space around

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.600
Health and in many ways life

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.600
Our goal will be to optimize and then expand our biological possibility

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.600
With continuous feedback loops guiding precision interventions at the optimal times

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.600
We'll move from our current system, which we call healthcare

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.600
But is all too often symptom based sick care

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.600
To a newer model of prediction and prevention

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.600
But as I said, the genetics and biotechnology revolutions will

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.600
And must extend far beyond human health

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.600
They are already leading us toward very significant

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.600
And badly needed changes in how we do agriculture

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.600
The green revolution of last century

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.600
Is what made it possible for us to go from 2 to 8 billion humans so quickly

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.600
But its reliance on chemical fertilizers and engineered water systems

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.600
Is simply not sustainable in our current form

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.600
As our global human population grows toward an estimated 10 billion people

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.600
Chemical fertilizers today account for 2% of energy use

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.600
And 1.5% of greenhouse gas emissions

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Not to mention the impact of runoff to sensitive aquatic ecosystems

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.600
We are reaching the limits of sustainable land and water use

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600
For the course we are on

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.600
Clearly we need to increase yields

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.600
While lowering agriculture's environmental and climate footprint

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.600
Our new tools, like the ones leaps is championing

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.600
Promise to do just that

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.600
By doing things like manipulating the microbiomes in plant roots and soils

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.600
To massively decrease the need for fertilizers and pesticides

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.600
And generating crop varieties that can thrive

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.600
And highly populated parts of the world

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.600
Where climate change induce warming

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.600
And groundwater salination

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Are threatening current crops and human survival

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600
Of course this is

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.600
What I find so extraordinary about this is that

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600
Agriculture is pitched as the thing to fix

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600
Agriculture is pitched as the broken thing

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.600
It's nothing to do with any other industry

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.600
Nothing to do with any other industry at all

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:14.600
And it's extraordinary because there's obviously other industries in the world

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
Besides agriculture

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.600
We're not talking about mining

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
We're not talking about refining

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.600
We're not talking about a manufacturing of goods

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.600
We're not talking about manufacturing of batteries

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
Or anything like this

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.600
We're talking about the environmental impact of agriculture

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.600
I mean it's extraordinary really because if you think about it

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.600
Of all the fires that are burning in the world

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.600
Of all the pollution that's happening in the world

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.600
This guy is talking about working on agriculture

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.600
Not

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.600
It's extraordinary

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600
Not all about new technologies

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.600
We also need to invest in helping traditional agriculture

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.600
Become more sustainable and scalable

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.600
The question is not technology either or

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
But how best?

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.600
Our value chains will only be valuable if they are sustainable

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.600
The incredible economic growth we've seen over the last 150 years

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600
Has depended on levels of extraction that are not infinitely scalable

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.600
To grow economically in ways that don't decimate our planet

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.600
We must shift our natural resource acquisition model

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.600
From cut down and dig up to grow

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.600
Using precision fermentation from genetically engineered yeast, algae and bacteria

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.600
And other approaches to do what nature already does

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.600
Build from small to big from the recipe of code

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.600
This is the revolution of biology plus biology-inspired human engineering

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.600
Where we can grow plastics, woods, fabrics, industrial enzymes

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.600
And many of the other raw materials we need

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.600
McKinsey estimates that 60% of all physical inputs we need

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.600
McKinsey estimates that 60% of all physical input materials we need

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.600
McKinsey estimates that 60% of all physical inputs to the world economy

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.600
Can be disrupted in this way

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.600
DNA data storage is another important area where we simply must think differently

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.600
Using these new tools

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.600
We are today on the verge of generating far more data than we can store with our current technology

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.600
But DNA is the ultimate data storage mechanism

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.600
Honed over billions of years

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.600
It's a million times denser than silicon and can be stored for over a million years

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.600
New frameworks for DNA data storage and computing

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.600
Have the potential to be an important foundation of our information future

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Of course there are significant challenges of science, cost and scale

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.600
In all of these areas which must still be overcome

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.600
But human creativity is essentially infinite

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.600
While most of the existing natural resources on our planet are finite

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.600
There are also very real potential dangers which must be acknowledged and addressed

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.600
Our technologies do not come with their own built-in value systems

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:22.600
It's up to us to ensure that our most cherished values guide the application of our most powerful technologies

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:29.600
Because what we are talking about here is manipulating complex systems we don't fully understand

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.600
Which requires almost limitless humility

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.600
If we are not in

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.600
It sounds like the same thing that he said at that TED Talk four years ago

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.600
We are talking about manipulating complex systems that we don't understand

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.600
And it requires the utmost humility

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.600
It's a really incongruent circular reasoning statement there

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.600
It's like what?

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
I mean

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600
It's sacred

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.600
You know cheating on your wife has to be done very carefully

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600
Because you can really hurt her feelings

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.600
That means that you don't think your marriage is sacred

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.600
You can say my marriage is really sacred, my marriage is really sacred

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:22.600
And if you cheat on your wife you should be very careful because you might hurt her feelings

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.600
Then you don't really believe that your marriage is sacred

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:33.600
And if you say that this is a complex system and we have to approach it with the utmost humility

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.600
But we are going to be collecting all the data and editing people and editing babies

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.600
And changing the soil

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.600
And editing crops and all this other stuff

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Then you don't think that this is a complex system and you don't have any humility

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.600
It's frustrating because that's what you hear in these talks

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.600
If you can hear the words and actually understand what he is saying

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.600
Because a lot of times they don't make sense together

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.600
You hear people saying incongruent things

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.600
My marriage is sacred, my marriage is sacred

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.600
If you cheat on your wife be careful because you might hurt her feelings

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.600
We're going to do this, biology is this, we're going to become gods

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.600
We can change DNA, we're going to be able to rewrite the book of life

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.600
It's a complex system and we have to have the utmost humility

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.600
These statements are not congruent

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.600
They're lies, they're enchantments

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.600
They're designed to bamboozle the people that are hearing them

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.600
And designed to make these people unable to compute anymore

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.600
Just to accept what's coming

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.600
As long as I get to go to the dinner tonight I guess this is fine, I'll clap for this

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.600
I got invited to this Zoom meeting, I guess that's great

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:05.600
Their salaries depend on them not realizing that this is a hoax

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.600
That this is a elaborate sales pitch

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600
That's never going to come true

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.600
Certainly not in these people's lifetimes

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Within 10 years nothing is going to change

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.600
Nor amously careful

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.600
And even if we are, we run the risk of limiting the diversity of life

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.600
Which has always been the foundation of resilience and survival

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:38.600
Given the power of these technologies, their uneven application could supercharge the massive equity challenges

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.600
We already face across the globe

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.600
But we need to recognize that maintaining the status quo also carries with it

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.600
Existential risks, climate change being only one

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.600
There's a danger in not investing in healthier lives for ourselves

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600
Our loved ones and the people around the world

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.600
In not seeking a more sustainable future for our planet

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.600
In not beginning to imagine alternative long-term futures for our species

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.600
When we know this planet will not always be habitable

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.600
But to increase the odds that we use our technologies to help us

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.600
Individually and collectively

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600
And not undermine us

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:22.600
We need to recognize that this is not ultimately a conversation about science

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600
But about values

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.600
Ethics is not what we do after we've developed a technology

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.600
But a framework we must integrate into every aspect of our work from the start

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.600
And so really what he's talking about is that we didn't have ethics before

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600
And we need ethics now

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600
He wants you to make you think that this is an open tablet

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.600
This is something that we can decide on now

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.600
There's no previous precedence

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.600
We don't have to think about informed consent

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.600
We don't have to think about all these concepts like beneficials

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.600
We don't need to think about that stuff

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600
This is a new age

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600
So we gotta have a new book

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600
A new ethics

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:12.600
It must be at the core of all processes, products and interactions at every stage

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.600
To do this

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:20.600
We need to recognize our responsibilities as builders and shapers of that larger story

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.600
Even if we are each only touching a small part of it

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600
We need the strongest possible governance

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600
Interesting way to put that

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.600
That's very much what I would think was said to a lot of the people that are on the

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.600
coronavirus novel, virus narrative

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Is that it's important that we all stay

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600
What did he say?

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.600
Count of builders are each only touching a small part

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.600
And shapers of that larger story

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:49.600
Recognize our responsibilities as builders and shapers of that larger story

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.600
Recognize our responsibilities as builders and shapers of that common story

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.600
Is that what he said?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.600
Recognize our responsibilities as builders and shapers of that larger story

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Even if we are each only touching a small part of it

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.600
Even if we are only touching a small part of it

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:15.600
Can you imagine that message being delivered to people at the beginning of the pandemic

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.600
Telling them that I know you want to fight and I know you want to speak up

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.600
But it's important for us to be all on one page

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.600
It's important for the country

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.600
It may be important for the world

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.600
And we need you to help us

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.600
And if you do, it could be a lucrative sub stack

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.600
It could be a lucrative supplement company

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.600
We can think of lots of ways that we can provide comfort for you

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
If you go along with this

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.600
You don't have to tell lies

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.600
Just don't tell them that

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.600
We need the strongest possible governance and accountability frameworks

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.600
In our companies, universities, governments and international organizations

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.600
Dynamic processes for public-private partnerships

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.600
As well as systems for exploring and sharing best practice

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.600
Dynamic processes for public-private partnerships

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:23.600
We're talking about taking public money, making private business

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:29.600
making private intellectual property

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.600
And having new ways of governing it on a global scale

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.600
That's why he talks about how some people, some societies

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.600
Don't mind this at all

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.600
Other societies have a big problem with it

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.600
As somebody said in the chat, this is a globalist here

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.600
All futurists are globalists

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.600
They think that we are eventually going to come together under one church

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.600
And have one world government with one world currency

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.600
And those people also think transhuman wise

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.600
We're going to have this command over our biology

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.600
Or at least we should reorganize so that we can collect the data

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.600
That will eventually give them to the AI and give us command over our

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.600
Over our biology one day

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.600
That's what they all believe

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.600
And this is one of their high priests

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
Or at least middle ground priests

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.600
Frameworks in our companies, universities, governments

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600
And international organizations

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Dynamic processes for public-private partnerships

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:32.600
As well as systems for exploring and sharing best practices

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:37.600
We need to think differently about public education, empowerment and engagement

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.600
By working with radical transparency

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.600
By supporting ongoing and multi-directional public dialogues

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600
Where we are really listening

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.600
And where what we hear has the potential to impact directions going forward

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.600
We need inclusive and respectful processes

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:58.600
That optimize positive societal and global outcomes for all

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.600
I wonder if I could take this

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.600
And write my own speech that just says nothing

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.600
But comes close to saying something about biology

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.600
Because this is extraordinary

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
It's almost hard to listen to

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600
I know this is a very tall order

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.600
But it's not just about where we are going

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.600
But how we get there

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.600
Because we are on the verge of an incredibly exciting future

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:26.600
If we can have the wisdom and foresight to build it

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.600
And building that better future is up to each and all of us

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.600
Thank you

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.600
That's what we're talking about here

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600
Ladies and gentlemen is some real nonsense

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.600
Some real real nonsense

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.600
And it is a consensus agreement on this nonsense

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.600
It's gotten us here

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.600
I can't stress enough how important it is to realize that

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600
This story

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600
Oops

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.600
This story of a novel virus

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600
Is a story that

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.600
Was told on pretense

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.600
For a very very long time

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.600
And many many secret meetings

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.600
In the beginning of movies

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.600
In the X files

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.600
In Simpsons

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.600
In every

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.600
TV series

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600
That you can imagine

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.600
They probably had something to do with

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.600
A pandemic

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.600
An epidemic

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.600
A breakout

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.600
Anybody's viruses

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.600
And none of the most of those

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.600
If not all of them are not innocent

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.600
Certainly the

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.600
The plan to the apes rewrite is not innocent

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.600
And if you start to see it that way

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.600
Then you can also start to see these more

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.600
Recent additions to the real

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600
Play on the street

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.600
The real play on social media

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.600
You can see that this has been scripted

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.600
For a very long time

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.600
This is Robert Malone

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.600
And the original press secretary of Donald Trump

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.600
On a podcast talking about a lab leak

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.600
You can't possibly believe this is the real

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.600
Random world of humankind

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.600
You can't possibly believe this is anything

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.600
But

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.600
A elaborate scheme to govern us

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Because it most certainly is

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.600
An elaborate scheme to govern us

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.600
The illusion of consensus

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.600
Medium turkey chili

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.600
It is an illusion of consensus

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.600
That keeps you believing in a novel

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.600
Virus that keeps you believing in an RNA

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.600
That keeps believing in

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Again of functional viruses

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600
Because everybody else does

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.600
Excuse me, I think you forgot my bread

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.600
Bread, two dollars extra

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.600
Two dollars, but everyone in front of me got free bread

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.600
You want bread?

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600
Yes please

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.600
Three dollars

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
No soup for you

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.600
It's an illusion

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.600
And if you remove the illusion of consensus

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.600
You can start to see it for what it is

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.600
You might still be funny

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.600
But you're not told when to laugh

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.600
Medium crap best

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.600
And the lab leak story might be real

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.600
Or a version of it with clones might be real

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600
You didn't get any bread

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.600
Just forget it's not as scary as you were told it was to be

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600
Because

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
If you were not told to be scared

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600
This would not have happened

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.600
Bread, two dollars extra

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.600
If you were not told to be scared

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600
This would not have happened

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.600
If doctors were not told to be scared

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.600
This would not have happened

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600
And that's what Denny Rancors

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600
That's what Denny Rancors data shows

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.600
That's what this shows

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.600
Because without the illusion of consensus

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.600
In the form of track laughter

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.600
Even Seinfeld isn't as funny as it used to be

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.600
And with regard to the 20 years of consensus

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.600
That has been created around the potential for coronavirus

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.600
To pandemic

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.600
Around the consensus of the last 20 years

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.600
That we've had previous close calls

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600
With pandemics

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.600
And over the last 20 years

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.600
This consensus that there's ever growing danger

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600
Of laboratory leak

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.600
And gain a function virus

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.600
Is coming from ever increasingly cheaper

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600
Bioterrorists

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.600
This is also something that has been created

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.600
As a consensus in secret meetings

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.600
Behind closed doors

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.600
For more than a decade

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.600
And so with this ongoing consensus

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.600
Behind the scenes

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.600
This ongoing consensus

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.600
Reinforced by salaries and subsidies

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.600
Encouragement, fame, etc

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.600
You have a whole army of people

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.600
Arguing on both sides of the narrative

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
Lab leak or natural virus

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600
And none of them are talking about

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.600
PCR fraud anymore

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.600
None of them are talking about

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.600
What was done with PCR in 2020 and 2021

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600
None of them are talking about

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600
Masking lockdown

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600
The lack of data for spread

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.600
The Jessica Hockett has been showing time and time again

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.600
It's just not there

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.600
The evidence for this phenomenon is not there

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.600
But plenty of people were killed

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.600
Plenty of people were frightened, confused

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.600
And ran around with doubt

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.600
For more than a year and a half

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.600
Because people like Brett Weinstein did

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.600
Because people like Sam Harris insisted

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.600
Because people like

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.600
Eric Fingal-Ding

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.600
On Twitter exist

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600
Because Kevin McCarran said

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.600
There was going to be a billion people dead

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.600
Because Paul Catrell said

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.600
We needed a smash to curve with 60 days locked down

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Because George Webb was on 60 minutes

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.600
Saying that it was a lab leak or a bioweapon

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.600
Lee released by

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600
The Chinese at the Wuhan Games

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.600
And brought back to the United States by an Air Force

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.600
Lady

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.600
That's why we're here

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600
Because the worst case scenario

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.600
Native narrative was seated

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.600
And because none of this stuff was talked about

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.600
And it's still not talked about

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600
And that should tell you all you need to know

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.600
So they misled us about pandemic potential

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.600
And laboratories and in nature

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.600
In order to invert our human rights

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.600
Might have been a

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.600
An infectious clone that was used to see

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.600
That sequence around the world

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.600
And if you need

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.600
That sequence to be responsible

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.600
For respiratory disease and other illness

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.600
Then you just make more of it

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.600
And so like I said million times

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600
This is a crime scene

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600
I'm just calling 911

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.600
I don't know exactly what happens

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
I don't know who all the bad guys are

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
But I'm telling you a crime has been committed

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Please send the police

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.600
Or we're going to lose our human rights forever

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.600
That's what I believe

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.600
And so yeah we are

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.600
In the midst of this

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.600
Thing where I think instead of scenario

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.600
One through three

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.600
Which is laboratory or bedcave zoonosis

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.600
Where the earth is clean

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.600
In the beginning here

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600
And then gets dirty

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.600
I think it's a conflated background signal

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.600
And they may or may not have added to it

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.600
In order to control it better

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.600
They may or may not have added to it

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.600
In order to make it cleaner or higher fidelity

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.600
But they didn't have to do that

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600
Because the vast majority of this

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.600
Was created through PCR

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.600
And conflated background signals

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600
All PCR needs

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600
And so it doesn't matter

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.600
If it's an endemic background coronavirus

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600
The protocols for murder and transfection

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600
Is not medicine, it doesn't matter

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.600
If it was an infectious clone release

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600
It doesn't matter if it was a transfection agent

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.600
Or a combination of all of the above and more

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.600
The protocols remain murder

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600
And we're conflating background signals

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
With these stupid diagnostics

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600
And so that's why no viruses

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.600
Is inadequate

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600
That's why it's just inadequate

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.600
This is where we are

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.600
Protocols of murder and transfection

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.600
Was not, it's not

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.600
Will never be medicine

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.600
These people misled us

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.600
They continue to mislead us

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.600
Because they keep on the narrative

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.600
There wasn't a virus

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600
We had to do something

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.600
The mRNA worked for a lot of people

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600
And it's again a function virus

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600
So this will probably happen again

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600
You got to understand how you respond

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600
To a respiratory disease

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.600
And I explained it pretty well

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.600
At the end of Brian's talk today

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.600
So hopefully that podcast will come out soon

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.600
And you can see that

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.600
But you've really got to learn

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600
About all cause mortality

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.600
And put these numbers into context

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.600
In America between 2.7

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.600
And 3 million people die every year

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.600
In the best year

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600
And that's somewhere between

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600
55 and 65,000 people a week

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.600
Get your head around that

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600
When they tell you that

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.600
500 people died of COVID this week

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.600
Or that 300 kids died this year of something

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.600
Get your head around that

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.600
50 to 60,000 people a week

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600
Is very normal in America

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.600
Get your head around

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600
How your immune response really works

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.600
And how it is a balance

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.600
Between the intolerant T cells

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.600
And the intolerant T cells

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.600
Get your head around the idea

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600
That there's one contiguous barrier

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.600
That your immune system defends

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
And it's the barrier between

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
Inside and outside

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600
And there's outside in the tube

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600
That goes through your body

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.600
And that outside is also defended

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.600
From the inside

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600
By your immune system

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.600
And learn why

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600
Transfection is not immunization

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.600
Please

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.600
And learn why

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600
Intramuscular immunization

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600
Is also probably a pretty dumb idea

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.600
That we've outgrown

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600
That we've outgrown

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600
Because our biology

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.600
That this

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.600
Jamie Metzel is talking about

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600
Means that we've outgrown it

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600
We've outgrown

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600
Injecting toxic chemicals

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.600
And recombinant proteins

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.600
Into the muscle

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.600
In an attempt to augment the immune system

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.600
We can do better than that

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600
And it's not transfection

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600
But changing our mind about this stuff

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.600
Allowed the pandemic to happen

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.600
And allowed protocols

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.600
In treating normal

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.600
A pneumonia

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.600
And normal

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
Old people problems

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.600
Got treated

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.600
Completely differently

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600
Like a highly contagious

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600
Deadly respiratory disease

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600
Based on a PCR test

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.600
And financial incentives

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.600
To pay attention to it

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600
They rolled out Remdesivir

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.600
And gave it to people

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.600
For what?

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.600
Remdesivir

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600
Everybody that was given Remdesivir

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
And died was a murder

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600
Everybody that was given Remdesivir

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.600
And didn't die got lucky

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.600
And all of them should be

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.600
Reimbursed for the damages

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.600
That they were

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600
It's a poison

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
There was no reason to believe

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600
That Remdesivir would help these people

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600
From whatever was out there

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.600
Especially if nothing was out there

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
Ladies and gentlemen

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600
We've got to come to terms with this

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600
This is a real real problem

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600
This is not just like we gave a

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600
Maspurin and Aspirin didn't work

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600
We gave them a poison

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600
A Dazzalam was effectively a poison

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
The way it was used in the UK

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600
Not giving people antibiotics

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600
When they have a secondary pneumonia

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.600
It's basically poisoning them

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.600
Come on guys

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.600
So that's where we are

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600
I'm going to run that by one more time

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600
And that's why I showed Jamie Metzel

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600
Today because you know

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.600
I think one of the stories

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600
They've been telling in the back rooms

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600
Of these meetings

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600
Is that we don't have much time guys

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.600
We've got to change these people's minds

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600
Right now because if we don't

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600
If we don't change their minds now

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600
We're going to miss this peak

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.600
This peak availability

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.600
Of the most genetic variations

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600
Of the most examples

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.600
Of human genetics

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600
And human phenotypes

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600
That we're ever going to have again

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Think about it from the perspective

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600
Of Go or Chess

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.600
And how AI solved that problem

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.600
It solved it by playing millions and millions of games

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.600
And every one of the humans on the planets

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.600
Is one game of the human game

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.600
And so if you want many many many many many many games

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600
To feed to your AI

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.600
So that the AI can figure out

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.600
How to win the game

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.600
And you've got to give it

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600
Many many iterations of the game

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600
That's why they need genetic code

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600
And all of the biological data

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.600
They can muster from every human being

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.600
They can get

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Because they don't know how much data

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600
They're going to need before the AI will go

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.600
Okay, no, I get it

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.600
And as we heard

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600
And learned from the

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600
AI winning at Go

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600
The moment the human played

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600
Rather unorthodox

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600
Than the Go machine

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600
Lost all of its powers

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.600
And so there's a very very good chance

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
That the first 10 solutions from the AI

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600
Will be close

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
But no cigar

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600
And in the end this will be nothing but

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.600
A mythology

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600
Run all the way out to the threads

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600
All the way out to the threads

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600
Because this is not the way

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.600
This is going to work

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.600
This is not the way it's going to happen

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600
It's not the right way for humans

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600
To go forward

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600
In a hundred years

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600
Everybody that's alive is going to be dead

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600
And there is no

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.600
There is absolutely no chance

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.600
Of us

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Usefully augmenting a human

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600
So that's not the case

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.600
And the only people that probably have a chance

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.600
Of living out

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600
This next hundred years and longer

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600
Are little kids that are

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.600
Vaccinated right now

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600
And will not be in the future

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.600
The fearfully and wonderfully made

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600
Little children

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
That are not vaccinated

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600
Those are the ones that are probably going to live

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600
The next hundred years

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.600
Everybody else is going to be dead

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600
You can find me at giga-home.bio

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.600
Still trying to convert

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.600
I'm really not on social media anymore

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.600
And I think it's good

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600
I think I'm getting on stream every day

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.600
And I think that's a better thing to focus on

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600
Thanks very much for joining me

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600
I hope you enjoyed it

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600
I need some sleep

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600
Transfection is not immunization

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600
Any combination of chemicals

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.600
Injection intramuscularly is probably

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.600
A dumb idea as far as

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600
Augmenting the immune system

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.600
You heard it here

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600
Stop all transfections

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Because they're trying to eliminate the control group

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.600
I think I'm going to do a broken science video

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.600
Greg just put out a new

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600
A new video podcast

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
I think I'm going to watch that tomorrow

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600
Big shout out to Greg

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.600
Check it out if you want to check it out

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600
A little really broken science initiative

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.600
Thank you

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600
Thank you for joining

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600
Thank you for joining me

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600
Thank you for joining me
