WEBVTT

00:31.638 --> 00:32.258
Testing 1, 2.

00:32.719 --> 00:33.019
Test 1, 2.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.701
Test 1, 2.

00:36.281 --> 00:45.788
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

00:46.448 --> 00:55.575
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.

00:56.513 --> 01:02.957
This was said in 1924 by Edward Bernays of the United States of America.

01:03.998 --> 01:08.181
Thank you for being here, Aaron and Arthur and Fletch and Jeff and Tony.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.322
Good to see you all.

01:11.783 --> 01:20.729
I do believe that biology is the way out, ladies and gentlemen, and this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

01:21.633 --> 01:23.995
Let me just scoot over here and check really quick.

01:24.015 --> 01:28.458
We're going to lose that for just a second just to make sure that we are also live on YouTube.

01:28.538 --> 01:29.399
It appears we are.

01:30.139 --> 01:32.000
Thank you very much again for being here.

01:33.241 --> 01:39.586
The voice that you're listening to is Jonathan Cooey out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:40.807 --> 01:46.691
You can find me on PubMed where you use my last name C-O-U-E-Y, my first two initials.

01:47.992 --> 01:50.114
You can see some of the

01:51.050 --> 02:00.556
The mess that I got involved with, some of the evidence is even available on PubMed there, for example, the should we discount the laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.

02:01.977 --> 02:10.242
That's an article that I'm not especially proud of, but it definitely is part of my track record and should not be dismissed, but rather

02:12.543 --> 02:17.704
assessed as part of the whole picture that I try to present every day that I come on stream.

02:18.584 --> 02:25.966
I've tried to teach this basic biology to Panda and to the NCI and to the Wellness Company and to Children's Health Defense.

02:27.026 --> 02:30.747
I even got my name in a book with the current Health and Human Services Secretary.

02:31.668 --> 02:36.589
I presented this at Red Pill last year, thanks to G. Edward Griffin.

02:37.269 --> 02:41.530
And I'm trying to put together a YouTube channel based on biology and basketball that will kind of

02:42.253 --> 02:48.358
teach the biological principles that edify a different kind of biology 101.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.541
And so if any of these things interest you, you're in the right place.

02:52.601 --> 02:54.343
Thank you very much again for being here.

02:55.123 --> 02:57.725
The headquarters is at GigaOMBiological.com.

02:57.765 --> 03:00.548
You can get notified by adding yourself to that list there.

03:00.608 --> 03:03.490
That hasn't actually started yet, but it will soon have.

03:04.211 --> 03:06.774
And we archive everything at stream.gigaom.bio.

03:06.794 --> 03:09.698
If you want to watch the stream live there, you can also watch it there.

03:09.858 --> 03:17.287
At some point, we're going to do a weekly stream that is just on PeerTube, just to see what we can pull off over there all by our lonesome.

03:18.568 --> 03:20.611
Thank you very much for being here again, ladies and gentlemen.

03:24.693 --> 03:45.103
I don't care how you get there.

03:45.123 --> 03:47.805
I don't care what you do to get there.

03:49.706 --> 03:50.366
The goal is to win.

03:55.143 --> 03:56.484
What time is it?

03:56.524 --> 03:57.225
Game time!

04:04.311 --> 04:06.994
A Monday worry, a mean, mean stride.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.596
Today's Tom Sawyer mean, mean pride.

04:24.429 --> 04:31.826
Don't put him down there's arrogant He's reserved a quiet defense Riding out the day's events

04:53.425 --> 05:21.382
Is what you say in the society Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the grip The world is, the world is Love and life are deep Maybe as its skies are white

05:26.601 --> 05:31.270
He gets high on you, and the space he invades, he gets by on you.

06:44.493 --> 06:46.055
To any god or government

07:11.630 --> 07:35.921
What you say about his company Is what you say about society Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spit The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

07:47.020 --> 07:50.035
Exit the warrior, today's dawn, so you hit your time

08:24.540 --> 08:28.323
I do think it could be different this time, ladies and gentlemen.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.165
I definitely think it could be different this time.

08:31.205 --> 08:33.066
Thank you very much for being there, everybody.

08:33.687 --> 08:41.192
Of course, Mark's got to get in the chat and brag about how many times he's seen Rush because he was totally into Rush before I was.

08:41.293 --> 08:43.214
I mean, I didn't even know who they were when I went to college.

08:43.234 --> 08:49.379
I don't even know how to tell you how much music I discovered as a college freshman.

08:50.159 --> 08:50.720
It was really

08:51.560 --> 09:04.348
an eye-opening experience being an outdoor snake wrangling, fishing, basketball playing, non-music listening to kid that really thought U2 was the best band in the world.

09:04.388 --> 09:09.230
It was a really eye-opening experience the four years I spent with

09:10.311 --> 09:13.833
I don't know, young adults my age trying to figure out what this world meant.

09:14.413 --> 09:17.694
College was still okay in 1990 and 1991 and 1992 and 93 and 94.

09:17.735 --> 09:19.976
Think about going to college in Lincoln Park of Chicago in 91, 92, 93, 94, 95.

09:20.756 --> 09:22.477
Some of the best years of my life

09:39.389 --> 09:45.453
I can remember every single one of those finals, including the very first one.

09:45.613 --> 09:50.997
I actually can remember seeing a bus tipped over, or almost tipped over.

09:51.778 --> 09:55.720
It rocked so hard, I thought people were going to get crushed by it.

09:56.761 --> 10:03.967
There's no way for anybody to avoid gigaohm biological at this point, because whether they like it or not, the word is slowly spreading.

10:04.087 --> 10:07.490
And the point is that the word only goes one direction.

10:08.390 --> 10:17.918
Once you experience the truth, once you see that this illusion requires your active participation, the whole thing disappears.

10:17.998 --> 10:20.080
Intramuscular injection is just dumb.

10:20.720 --> 10:26.845
Transfection is obviously a crime in healthy people, and RNA could never have pandemic.

10:27.285 --> 10:38.294
This is a ridiculous statement that any newly minted PhD student just having gone through their oral exams should have already done known better.

10:38.915 --> 10:45.920
But unfortunately, because of the illusion of consensus that is created on TV and in social media, these

10:46.921 --> 10:50.285
These really cardinal truths are just absolutely hidden.

10:51.466 --> 10:53.629
And the most important one being that the U.S.

10:53.669 --> 10:55.811
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

10:56.612 --> 11:02.159
And it's very easy to see if you compare it to any other vaccine schedule in the world.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.641
That's the cool part about it.

11:06.634 --> 11:14.817
It is, indeed, March 18th, 2025, Skigohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information stream brought to you by a biologist.

11:14.877 --> 11:19.199
It is a message of hope that is not for everyone, but it is for anyone.

11:19.639 --> 11:26.162
We are here seeking the truth together because this is for all the marbles, this is for all the grandchildren of Earth.

11:27.302 --> 11:30.163
And we are faced with a Lollapalooza of liars.

11:30.223 --> 11:34.805
It is a team of people that have been, you know, limitedly read in.

11:34.845 --> 11:39.807
A lot of them don't know the whole story because they're simply not sophisticated enough to even understand it.

11:40.387 --> 11:54.853
But they are aware that they are part of a governing elite, a narrative of people that is going along to get along and covering up the truth, which is actually still right here on the about page of the LearnTheRisk.org.

11:56.574 --> 11:57.675
YouTube channel.

11:57.955 --> 12:09.970
The United States has more vaccines on the childhood schedule than in any other developed country and yet we have one of the sickest populations despite spending more on health care than any other developed country.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.534
We are exposed to a chemical cocktail from polluted air and water.

12:15.540 --> 12:20.843
process foods laced with toxins and pesticides, and then we add vaccines to the mix.

12:21.424 --> 12:24.405
That says that right there still on the YouTubage.

12:25.406 --> 12:27.347
That actually, the plate is fantastic.

12:27.467 --> 12:28.468
I would love that very much.

12:28.548 --> 12:28.868
Thank you.

12:29.909 --> 12:34.992
The noise that you'll hear and not see is the sound of me eating eggs in between words.

12:35.592 --> 12:36.453
Don't worry about that.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.634
It has been a long, strange trip.

12:39.594 --> 12:43.437
I have met a lot of these people and come to the conclusion that somehow or another,

12:43.937 --> 12:47.018
They're all part of a theater that I'm not playing in.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.058
I'm not read in on.

12:49.218 --> 12:57.421
And that's the best way that I can describe their behavior over the last five years, especially with reference to their personal interactions with me.

12:58.441 --> 13:09.344
I consider these people part of a group of highly trained acolytes that are put in place to manipulate our habits and opinions by controlling the questions we asked and the answers we arrived at.

13:09.384 --> 13:11.164
And they can trick us into believing anything.

13:11.204 --> 13:12.645
And I think in this context,

13:13.685 --> 13:34.453
You really have to start to suck it up and realize that if you look at the graph and you see that that bright red is pneumonia deaths and for a very brief period of time we seem to have just not given a shit and then we put everything back to normal again and we have been tricked into believing that that was something other than what it was.

13:35.782 --> 13:44.328
It was murder and lies, and we have been tricked into believing that it was a novel virus, and it was the poor response to a novel virus, and in fact, it was not.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.930
It is really not even close to that.

13:46.950 --> 14:00.679
It is an elaborate national security theater that has been set up and put in place and running for quite some time, and it's just the latest act in this theater that we've experienced as the pandemic.

14:03.072 --> 14:09.735
But this act has had many other acts before it, and one of the best ones that nobody is aware of anymore.

14:09.755 --> 14:23.600
But if you paid any attention to our shows, you'd be aware of the fact that Sasha Latupova's daughter was playing within a network of the same kind of social media military control mechanisms that we are victims of now.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.121
Maybe even she was a prototype.

14:26.852 --> 14:33.515
And that career culminated in 2019 with her being on Alex Jones like three times.

14:33.975 --> 14:53.322
And so the acute association of our Health and Human Services Secretary and Children's Health Defense with the mother of this young lady and her association with Robert Malone, including her appearance on stage in January of 2023 with Robert Malone,

14:55.310 --> 15:23.578
and Aseem Malhotra and a number of other foreign meddlers, Merrill Nass, an American trader, is all indication that this is one orchestration of a spectacular commitment to lies where they have orchestrated some kind of replacement of our already criminal vaccine schedule with one that we will have assumed worked

15:24.565 --> 15:32.527
on the basis of that pandemic, on the basis of that theater where there were two years of people being murdered and then the murder stopped.

15:32.707 --> 15:37.548
And they want you to think that the murder stopped because the transfections worked.

15:39.268 --> 15:50.831
And in reality, if we would have told college kids in 2020 that these are transfections not that dissimilar from what is used on the academic bench in the hospital attached to your university,

15:51.889 --> 16:20.661
that these aren't that different than what 1964 says this anonymous account and agreed upon by the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, Kevin McKernan, a person who I think has personally interfered with my ability to provide for my family to a criminal extent that I think is a traitor to our grandchildren because he is part of a perhaps decade long national security operation to make sure that nobody figured out

16:21.741 --> 16:43.808
that the vaccine schedule in America was wholly criminal, that nobody in Europe would figure it out, that nobody on the internet would figure it out in 2024, so much so that this same character, after five years of consistent performing, went on a podcast and lied about how the Health and Human Services Secretary's book was written.

16:45.488 --> 16:51.150
And I think he did this because they are in a desperate position, because it is in fact true.

16:52.332 --> 17:02.681
That this whole entire lie is based on... This whole story is based on this commitment that molecular testing... I've got to put a bite of this egg in my mouth.

17:02.701 --> 17:16.033
I'm going to lower the... And I got coffee to drink.

17:16.053 --> 17:18.455
And I'm going to splatter butter...

17:19.857 --> 17:34.288
Over my nice shirt, which I don't really want to do so I'm gonna take that off right now Which is annoying because I probably already did it But it's butter so it'll probably come out if I get it wet right away

17:35.683 --> 17:41.666
If you're listening, feel like you can come down and get my jacket, that silly butter just splattered all over me.

17:42.646 --> 17:59.215
So yeah, the whole idea is, is that Kevin McKernan is on the internet performing in the way that he's performing, not because he's a patriot, because he's doing actual work, work that he's paid to do.

18:02.476 --> 18:03.737
This is the reality of it.

18:07.256 --> 18:10.804
And so you can see this consistent track record of what he does.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.089
And remember, a lot of these posts are sent to me.

18:14.637 --> 18:17.017
by other people because he's blocked me years ago.

18:17.778 --> 18:21.378
And this is just the level of malevolence that we're dealing with.

18:21.398 --> 18:25.659
It is a spectacular commitment to these lies.

18:25.839 --> 18:36.481
And that is the reason why someone like Mary Holland has been in place since roughly 2015, because she is not a failure.

18:36.961 --> 18:38.961
She is a meddler.

18:39.881 --> 18:43.122
If you think that Mary Holland has been fighting in earnest

18:44.130 --> 18:58.294
since 2015 when she was on Democracy Now!, then effectively that means she's a failure because her message is still just rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear, that's it.

19:01.215 --> 19:04.175
It's really remarkable where we are.

19:04.776 --> 19:11.878
And I think if you just digest a little bit what's happening here and realize that from January 25th, 2020,

19:14.204 --> 19:24.749
when it was declared a lab leak by Steve Bannon with, of course, you know, he's a Catholic pro-China hawk.

19:25.389 --> 19:28.330
He has promoted CHD throughout the pandemic.

19:29.351 --> 19:38.355
He's a self-declared intellectual property expert, and he used to work for Goldman Sachs, you know, the same bank that Aaron Seary used to work for.

19:41.138 --> 19:50.185
Kevin McKernan is also an intellectual property expert who's convinced that the FDA was corrupt and annoying and part of the reason why the pandemic ended up with so many people dead.

19:50.686 --> 20:06.418
Brett Weinstein is also, you know, the son of an intellectual property expert that was the first intellectual property expert to be appointed to the Department of Justice by none other than the father of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the guy who's now Health and Human Services Secretary.

20:08.683 --> 20:35.867
And of course, we could consider these all happy little accidents, or you could see this almost flawless pattern of people that can't seem to tell you that PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool, can't seem to identify pure oxygen as a possible cause of ARDS and this death in hospitals, and not being able to articulate that, you know, not giving antibiotics for pneumonia would be a crime tantamount to murder.

20:37.594 --> 20:40.355
It's not a accident.

20:40.855 --> 20:56.601
These are people that were put in place by the slavers that I'm calling team worst case scenario, that were supposed to convince us that a lab leak is not only possible, it is likely, and that the molecular biology to support this idea is not only possible, but obvious.

20:58.262 --> 21:04.484
And what this allowed to happen is that PCR as a medical diagnostic standard is now in place

21:06.129 --> 21:14.297
and being used to define these things going forward without needing FDA approval.

21:15.945 --> 21:23.250
even if the emergency ends, a lot of these medical devices will just be grandfathered in.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.752
You can rest assured that that's the case.

21:25.792 --> 21:29.714
And that means that these remnant streams will be grandfathered in.

21:29.774 --> 21:39.741
Just a happy little accident that we're collecting DNA from everybody that goes into every hospital, every person that enrolls and matriculates at a university.

21:39.781 --> 21:45.325
It's just a happy little accident that all the people that are behind those words right there have some ties

21:46.045 --> 21:50.488
to the Department of Energy or to genetics or to vaccines.

21:52.008 --> 22:03.295
These would-be patriots, these would-be world global leaders in the dissident movement, they are no less than global leaders and global influencers.

22:05.327 --> 22:11.851
And none of these people can explain to you why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread, even in this macro picture.

22:12.591 --> 22:19.275
None of these people have ever taken this picture and shown it to you to explain why this must be murder.

22:22.798 --> 22:30.062
They have never, ever shown you that you can actually see an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality in the graph.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.363
It's just visible.

22:32.179 --> 22:41.123
You can just look at the 50,000 line and then look at the 60,000 line and look at how all cause deaths rise up to it.

22:41.623 --> 22:46.185
Stop dropping below 50,000 and start only dropping below 60,000.

22:48.125 --> 22:52.047
Where the peak of the deaths is around 60,000, it's now way above 80,000.

22:52.087 --> 22:52.547
Interesting.

22:55.307 --> 23:09.626
Looks like an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was possibly sculpted using murder and sophisticated liars on the internet to create the myth of an RNA pandemic that no one could argue with unless they knew this.

23:11.488 --> 23:12.089
Just look.

23:38.513 --> 23:39.193
Two eggs down.

23:39.213 --> 23:40.214
There we go.

23:41.235 --> 23:42.796
Thank you very much for that patience.

23:44.037 --> 23:45.558
But you can see what I'm talking about, right?

23:46.178 --> 23:47.399
It's not very hard to see it.

23:50.501 --> 23:58.386
And so we have a list of how that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies.

23:58.406 --> 23:59.106
We have a list.

24:00.107 --> 24:00.827
We have a list.

24:02.468 --> 24:07.392
Not only was it the fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and confusion, and the do not resuscitate orders,

24:08.442 --> 24:13.503
and the ventilators and the poor use of steroids that Robert Malone laughed about.

24:14.284 --> 24:17.364
It was not only the remdesivir and the midazolam that was used.

24:17.424 --> 24:24.006
It was not only starving people or dying of cold like they did in Scotland or depriving them of water.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.747
It was also death certificate fraud.

24:27.807 --> 24:31.268
It was also financial incentives that made everything classify as that.

24:31.308 --> 24:37.390
It was track and trace and masks and closures and mandates that all scared people into believing that PCR was real.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.194
The lateral flow testing was real.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.576
That the sequencing was real.

24:43.677 --> 24:48.420
And for three years straight, nobody mentioned the opioid deaths except for Mark Kulak.

24:50.241 --> 24:52.742
Actually only one person on the internet, Mark Kulak.

24:54.864 --> 25:03.329
Nobody really explained how, if a viral pneumonia is bullshit, then not using antibiotics is criminal.

25:03.890 --> 25:04.890
Nobody could explain

25:06.134 --> 25:25.766
And this is remarkable that there wasn't a doctor in the United States that happened to catch this Kyle Seidel's video where they're exposing people to 60 liters a minute of oxygen and didn't protest as that being dangerous.

25:25.866 --> 25:29.169
It's remarkable how apparently poorly trained

25:30.109 --> 25:36.213
most doctors in the United States and around the world actually are in the basics of intensive care.

25:38.394 --> 25:53.764
And so what you have to imagine instead is a team of performers with elaborate costumes and effects and scripts and lines and you know they all know what they're going to do because they've all done the rehearsal they've all been at the table read and so

25:55.165 --> 26:06.268
What they did was they used this ongoing anticipated biological phenomenon, think of it like this train, and then pretended to have some effect on it.

26:08.169 --> 26:12.510
Not only that, but they agreed that each other was having an effect on it.

26:12.570 --> 26:20.932
So what you really need to be able to see is four or five people standing in front of this train performing the same little act that this guy in the stretch pants is performing.

26:23.325 --> 26:30.345
Because this act is important to understand, and it is especially important to understand how this act

26:32.992 --> 26:44.979
would be accentuated and enhanced if it was not just him, but it was also me, and Mark Kulak, and Jessica Rose, and Pierre Corey, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:45.379 --> 27:00.128
without a shirt on, and Robert Malone had a horse, and Jill Glasspool Malone was, I don't know, holding some elaborate device that was plugged in, and it looked like it ran down into the crack here where the track runs.

27:01.058 --> 27:06.463
And we were all agreeing, you know, and Jill would call out, all right, everybody, the train's coming in three seconds.

27:07.123 --> 27:12.608
And then, you know, Robert would ride his horse all the way down to the end and pull a chain along there.

27:12.648 --> 27:14.229
And it would seem like, wow, what's he doing?

27:14.690 --> 27:16.652
And then we would all get ready to catch the train.

27:16.692 --> 27:18.253
And then at once we would all grab it.

27:18.313 --> 27:25.159
And once we stopped the train, I would give Jessica Rose a high five and Pierre Corey would come over and give me a high five and

27:25.699 --> 27:35.323
and Mark Kulak would be over there, you know, stretching his arms like this and adjusting the bib overalls he's wearing and then we'd get ready to push the train out.

27:36.524 --> 27:43.527
It would be a lot more convincing than this guy and still it wouldn't change the circumstances of the train.

27:46.888 --> 27:53.591
And what I'm arguing is that's what they did with this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

27:55.947 --> 28:01.612
They just got their costumes on and when the train came in the station, they started performing.

28:05.176 --> 28:06.677
Brett Weinstein was performing.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.162
Eric Weinstein was performing.

28:11.222 --> 28:13.264
Peter Thiel knew there was going to be a performance.

28:14.551 --> 28:16.613
They all knew there was gonna be a performance.

28:16.753 --> 28:19.435
James Lyons Weiler knew he was given a script.

28:19.475 --> 28:20.636
He knew he was being told.

28:20.996 --> 28:33.766
I mean, we just listened to Chris Martinson yesterday, so certain about what a calamity a pandemic would be, as if suddenly he's not interested in gold and the Federal Reserve anymore, but is just sure about virology.

28:35.607 --> 28:39.630
Because they were all told, come on, we all gotta pretend, we gotta stop it.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.171
Just come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

28:41.191 --> 28:42.032
I'll explain it later.

28:44.551 --> 28:47.233
And five years later, they're still doing it.

28:48.014 --> 28:49.915
Some of them still don't even know why.

28:50.916 --> 28:57.280
Because there's so many people standing along this train that it actually seems plausible that they're doing something.

28:58.921 --> 29:06.227
Have you ever seen these giant tug-of-war, tug-of-war things where there's like hundreds of people on either side of the rope?

29:07.261 --> 29:13.506
It's very hard to gauge what you yourself are actually doing when you pull on the rope because there's hundreds of people on your side.

29:13.987 --> 29:16.589
And on the other side of the river, there's hundreds of people over there.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.850
It's very hard to tell.

29:19.191 --> 29:24.175
What's more important is the more people there are, the less it matters what you do.

29:26.117 --> 29:28.238
And so in a situation like this,

29:29.113 --> 29:38.726
The more people that line up along the train and pretend to stop it, the more likely it is that any given dupe will not be able to tell that they're really not doing anything.

29:41.550 --> 29:44.254
And so this scenario

29:45.745 --> 29:59.011
but applied to a social media platform where they have all the access to all the messages that they can communicate and read what you're doing, where there are anonymous accounts that they can use against you for the same purpose.

30:01.332 --> 30:07.795
Now you maybe are starting to conceive how this pandemic was always meant to be played.

30:09.540 --> 30:31.880
and why so many of our people, the leaders that are the people that are in positions of power are so carefree and nonchalant because they understand what they did as a group, lining up against this train and grunting and pulling really hard and getting their hands dirty and wiping it on their pants and going, I'm just trying to help.

30:32.421 --> 30:33.642
They know what they did.

30:34.815 --> 30:40.018
And they know that as long as they keep doing it, anybody that doesn't know what's happening will be fooled.

30:41.439 --> 30:47.784
They know that the illusion is requiring them to sustain their work, to sustain their smile.

30:47.844 --> 31:03.454
That's why you can see what happened in Australia differently now, what happened in New Zealand differently now, what happened with Kevin McCairn differently now, what happened with Kevin McKernan's timeline differently now, and everybody's timeline needs populating.

31:04.423 --> 31:21.090
in order to understand when they got in on this performance and whether they can be forgiven for having come in when there were thousands of people lined up trying to stop the train, pretending with all of their might, so that it was pretty hard not to know.

31:22.450 --> 31:25.551
Sorry, it was pretty hard to know that these people were fooled.

31:27.172 --> 31:31.734
Or were they part of an original group of people that decided we have to pretend?

31:33.117 --> 31:40.240
Because if we don't pretend, the criminal vaccine schedule in the United States will be exposed.

31:42.140 --> 31:49.163
And of course, the criminal vaccine schedule in the United States being exposed would be a huge problem for the Human Genome Project.

31:51.484 --> 31:58.006
It would be a huge problem for anybody that was interested in collecting genomes, you know, like the Claire Craig of the 100,000 Genomes Project in the UK.

32:02.130 --> 32:14.802
like HIV virologist, Jessica Rose, or longtime retro virologist and post-doc of Murray Gardner, Robert Malone.

32:15.702 --> 32:28.074
Or the country doctor and bioweapons expert from Australia and Rhodesia and America in Maine, Merrill Nass, whose son works at Google.

32:30.805 --> 32:33.687
Or maybe, I don't know, who else do you want to talk about here?

32:33.767 --> 32:38.750
The idea that Brett Weinstein's father and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

32:38.710 --> 32:42.772
's father were in the same Department of Justice and helped form the FDA?

32:42.852 --> 32:58.802
I mean, we are dealing right now, ladies and gentlemen, with a almost too obvious issue where there is a biological phenomenon and a world to govern.

33:00.578 --> 33:01.558
And you can do the math.

33:03.579 --> 33:09.200
You can do the math once you go look for it and realize that this signal has been foretold for like 20 years.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.201
They've been telling us for a very long time that was gonna happen.

33:12.741 --> 33:20.323
Before the pandemic, I wouldn't have had to work very hard to convince my family and friends that these people might work together to create an illusion of consensus.

33:23.324 --> 33:27.405
That they might pay people to go on social media to create an illusion of consensus.

33:29.167 --> 33:41.051
But I'm still gonna have trouble convincing a lot of my family and friends that these people were paid to go online and create an illusion of consensus in order to destroy America.

33:41.951 --> 33:44.032
Because that's what this ultimately is about.

33:44.252 --> 33:50.514
And I think it's really important for everybody in America on Team USA, which I don't have my jacket on now.

33:50.554 --> 33:53.895
I could probably put it back on, but darn it.

33:54.995 --> 33:56.976
I'm afraid it's got butter on it though.

33:58.422 --> 34:00.624
Yeah, it's got butter on it, but I guess it'll come out.

34:00.784 --> 34:01.565
I'm not worried about it.

34:02.146 --> 34:03.567
We'll wear the butter.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.871
We'll wear the butter, clean the butter after the show.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.796
We will clean the butter after the show.

34:11.836 --> 34:12.316
There we go.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.838
Team USA, baby!

34:16.004 --> 34:22.170
And I think it's really important to state that out loud because I think everybody in the world right now should be on Team USA.

34:22.750 --> 34:32.279
And I don't mean Trump and I don't mean RFK, I mean Team USA like the US Constitution and the idea that the US system is on the brink.

34:33.718 --> 34:44.325
and that there is something to be saved here, even if it can't be saved financially or mathematically, it can be saved on principle and it can be saved on ideals.

34:45.266 --> 34:51.289
And those ideals I think are still very important to understand are only codified in law here in America.

34:51.790 --> 34:59.315
It's the only place where we still have free speech and real free speech, you know, protected by the law.

35:00.413 --> 35:06.238
Whether or not it will actually be protected is another thing, but technically speaking, it's not written like that anywhere else.

35:06.758 --> 35:23.492
And so this lollapalooza of liars that is composed of a lot of international meddlers is designed to create a general apathy toward America, and a general disdain for America, and then eventually blame this big mess on America.

35:23.552 --> 35:24.333
I'm sure of it.

35:25.157 --> 35:32.499
Because again, the idea is to control, demolish America, as I said, in July of 2020 from my backyard.

35:36.300 --> 35:52.204
And it makes perfect sense that there would be some key traders within the American system that would play a key role in making sure the American public would never wake up to the fact that our sovereignty was going to be inverted, that we were going to be used as

35:55.157 --> 36:03.608
as experimental animals, and I think there's a very good argument to be made, and I think the only one making it is Mark Kulak, that the original intent

36:04.767 --> 36:15.754
of 9-11 was a bioterror attack, which would allow them to use an anthrax vaccine on the military.

36:15.814 --> 36:21.657
Now, the question becomes to me, and I'm still a little worried about this, and I think Mark needs to do a little work here.

36:21.697 --> 36:23.458
Since he's critiquing me, I'll critique him.

36:25.820 --> 36:32.504
In the sense of, I think that already a lot of troops that were shipped off to Iraq were already given that vaccine.

36:33.360 --> 36:48.214
And in fact, if this data port was set up and as he says at Wimber to look at cancer back in the year 2000, I have no doubt that that network is bigger and better now with the same intentions in mind.

36:49.355 --> 36:53.579
I only say this because I do have a friend who enlisted at some point because he was kind of lost.

36:54.100 --> 36:57.863
It was around the same time that I decided to do my PhD in the Netherlands.

36:58.964 --> 37:06.947
And he enlisted and one of the first things that happened after basic training was they all got shots and they all were in the basement of a church, incredibly sick.

37:08.047 --> 37:25.352
And so again, the idea that you were using our military as experimental animals, I think is to be a foregone conclusion already before the pandemic, and that the pandemic was actually more about converting the entire population to the same status, or at least

37:25.953 --> 37:27.334
That was the original intention.

37:27.394 --> 37:29.514
Again, this is a crime scene.

37:30.075 --> 37:39.158
I don't know what these people were hired to do, but I do know if a couple of these people were to break, what they would have to admit would probably be absolutely mind-blowing.

37:42.259 --> 37:46.421
I mean, there's no way to explain why the Brownstone Institute exists.

37:46.521 --> 37:47.501
It's such a joke.

37:48.101 --> 37:54.064
If you listen to Jeffrey Tucker, if you read what he writes, it is such pretentious bullshit.

37:54.966 --> 38:03.053
And yet somehow or another, they have enough money to have fellows that include lawyers and people like Jessica Rose and Brett Weinstein.

38:03.133 --> 38:21.088
It's not by accident, it's the same people that I call team worst case scenario, because all of these organizations are essentially part of this fake populist movement that seems to have been coordinated largely by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Steve Bannon.

38:23.090 --> 38:24.512
And I don't mean coordinated.

38:24.532 --> 38:27.815
I mean, there's a there's a script and only a few people really understand it.

38:28.496 --> 38:37.545
I don't think that Brett Weinstein has the sophistication of understanding of biology to get get to the point where he can even imagine why

38:38.382 --> 38:39.963
DNA might be exaggerated.

38:40.843 --> 38:44.005
And I do think that Kevin McKernan understands that very well.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.507
I don't think that Steve Bannon gives a shit.

38:47.147 --> 38:51.590
Although he might be sophisticated enough to understand that a lot of this is huff and puff.

38:51.650 --> 38:53.531
It's a lot of exaggeration.

38:54.952 --> 38:56.593
I don't think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:56.633 --> 39:20.625
is sophisticated enough to understand how long and by whom he's been manipulated, and I don't think any of us can blame him, because it's possible that since his father was killed, he has been experienced, victimized as a Truman Show, where everybody that's been around him has been feeding him a limited spectrum of understanding that essentially defines his reality now.

39:21.405 --> 39:25.709
And so, you know, I don't think of him as a good or bad guy.

39:25.829 --> 39:41.204
I think of him as a good intending guy, mainly because unlike Kevin McKernan, who has gone out of his way to meddle and interfere with my ability to make a living, this guy gave me a job.

39:41.844 --> 39:42.985
This guy put me in his book.

39:43.917 --> 39:57.434
I have the feeling that in a lot of ways, some of these people that are more of the chess players here are frustrated that my name is so prominently featured in that book and will remain there in perpetuity.

39:59.338 --> 40:19.526
I plan to make sure that I hammer that for the rest of my life because I think that a lot of these people were put in place and knew that they were in place to maintain this limited spectrum of debate where everybody feels like there's being progress made except for those people who are actually aware

40:20.446 --> 40:23.928
of the position of the ball and whether or not it's moving.

40:24.328 --> 40:31.372
If you've never played football before, let's call it rugby because that makes a little more sense from the perspective of the scrum.

40:31.913 --> 40:35.655
If you've never played rugby before, you don't actually really know what's going on in there.

40:37.436 --> 40:43.199
I would argue that anybody that's played American football has got no freaking idea what goes on inside of a rugby scrum.

40:45.117 --> 40:59.587
And in that scenario, anybody that's not been exposed to the tragedies of healthcare in America before, never really experienced it because they're just naive, then this will be a lot like your first rugby game.

41:00.628 --> 41:02.629
Wow, these people work together really well.

41:02.689 --> 41:04.551
It looks so cool how they do it.

41:04.971 --> 41:10.915
I can't believe it, all those rules, and it looks so neat, and look at those lines, and wow, those plays are exciting.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.397
I don't know how they organize that, but that looks so cool.

41:14.878 --> 41:15.698
That's what this was.

41:17.159 --> 41:22.601
This wasn't meant for the people that have been fighting against the vaccine schedule for years.

41:22.721 --> 41:26.743
Like, it wasn't meant for the fans of Brian Hooker.

41:27.363 --> 41:29.484
Wasn't meant for the fans of this lady here.

41:29.564 --> 41:34.366
This was meant for the people who didn't know anything about anything before.

41:36.166 --> 41:40.068
This wasn't meant for people that knew who Brandy Vaughn was, that's for sure.

41:43.564 --> 41:51.788
And them going to Romania a couple months before to rehearse all of the same presentations with all of the same people.

41:53.429 --> 41:55.970
Well, that wasn't a happy little accident either.

41:58.251 --> 42:07.056
These people having been off the coast of Turkey on a cruise together for a week the year before this is not a, it's not an accident.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.655
hot tub pictures and shoe pictures.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.116
These are not accidents.

42:14.196 --> 42:20.317
These are the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

42:21.538 --> 42:36.461
And to a certain extent, you could see it as a populist movement global, where this network flexed its strength global, trying to show the power of social media networks on a global scale.

42:37.967 --> 42:40.148
to herd cats like never before.

42:40.309 --> 42:52.237
Almost like a no-sphere, you know, something that Teilhard de Chardin talked about, where the entire consciousness of humanity becomes one.

42:53.938 --> 43:01.703
I assure you that the social media platforms would love us to start using them to that extent, because then they can really control our countries.

43:06.013 --> 43:20.169
Maybe they could even create a very lively debate within that spectrum, which would get us to essentially decide to dissolve our national borders and to sort of just accede to a global governance.

43:21.414 --> 43:31.766
Maybe that's the reason why a lot of these people seem to have allegiances outside of the United States, seem to have allegiances to invisible weaponized piles of money.

43:32.466 --> 43:34.689
You can't think of Peter Thiel as an American.

43:34.709 --> 43:37.592
You can't think of Elon Musk as an American.

43:38.093 --> 43:42.297
So why are we allowing these people to have so much influence over us?

43:43.058 --> 43:48.821
via these social media platforms upon which they pay people to proselytize.

43:49.302 --> 43:53.804
This is absolutely positively a Lollapalooza of liars.

43:53.984 --> 44:00.008
And from my own personal perspective, this is the starting lineup for team worst case scenario.

44:00.328 --> 44:01.669
There can be others.

44:02.489 --> 44:09.934
I don't have Judy Mikovits on here because I've never had any real personal interaction with her, although she definitely belongs on here.

44:09.954 --> 44:17.499
I don't have Mickey Willis on here or Del Bigtree on here because I've never had any personal interaction with them.

44:20.962 --> 44:29.828
These are all people that I've had extensive conversations with, multiple Zoom meetings, tried to convince them that, you know, some of this stuff is worth saying.

44:31.297 --> 44:32.997
That's why these people are here.

44:38.278 --> 44:47.100
And they all ignore the fact that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that can explain all of the death.

44:51.581 --> 44:51.961
All of it.

44:56.521 --> 44:59.982
But what they needed to do was push this together

45:01.926 --> 45:03.567
And that's what makes it malevolent.

45:04.627 --> 45:13.130
They needed a specific signal, which Mark Kulak, it particularly sticks in his teeth because he's the one who kind of figured it out.

45:13.170 --> 45:18.112
You know, changing flu deaths to COVID doesn't kill any more people.

45:20.313 --> 45:29.977
A rise in all cause mortality is provided by an anticipated rise in all cause mortality provided by death certificate fraud and provided by Murr Diddley Erdler.

45:31.075 --> 45:33.036
It's gotta be murder, deadly, hurdler.

45:33.916 --> 45:35.797
I'm saying it like, like Flanders.

45:35.857 --> 45:39.178
It's gotta be murder in order to get these peaks.

45:40.038 --> 45:42.639
It doesn't have to all be the same kind of murder.

45:44.199 --> 45:52.662
It can be neglect and starvation and lack of antibiotic use for urinary tract infections and remdesivir and midazolam and starving.

45:52.922 --> 45:55.903
And it can be all of those things in different places.

45:57.768 --> 46:03.230
as long as you understand that they needed to kill people or this never would have happened.

46:03.810 --> 46:12.233
Yes, there would be a signal, just like every other year there would have been a signal in the winter, but it would not have been like this.

46:13.634 --> 46:16.935
This only happened in hospitals.

46:18.656 --> 46:25.038
There wasn't a wave of severe COVID that swept our neighborhoods and left people dead in their house.

46:27.796 --> 46:30.538
That happened in New York City because they didn't resuscitate people.

46:30.578 --> 46:33.099
That did not happen because of COVID.

46:34.400 --> 46:38.402
This is murder, and it is a myth that they have created.

46:40.063 --> 46:43.625
And so I think it's time to put some stuff on a timeline.

46:43.725 --> 46:44.966
Sorry, it's 44 minutes in.

46:44.986 --> 46:47.988
I wanted to do that faster, but I never do it fast.

46:57.284 --> 46:59.426
I'm kind of happy that it's just butter.

46:59.967 --> 47:00.707
I think it'll come out.

47:01.228 --> 47:02.429
I don't know why I'm so obsessed with it.

47:02.449 --> 47:03.570
I just got this jacket.

47:03.610 --> 47:04.611
I love all these jackets.

47:04.651 --> 47:05.452
I think they're so great.

47:05.492 --> 47:09.015
Since I was a young boy, I thought that the Dream Team was super cool.

47:09.035 --> 47:13.640
I'm a young man and I really just, I don't know, for some reason I finally...

47:14.965 --> 47:41.402
Decided what I wanted to make that YouTube channel about and the theme I wanted to make it out And so I'm now I'm super excited about it, and I hope you are too Giggle and biological comm is the place where you can go if you want to support this stream because we are supported only like by viewers like you Thank you very much for all those people that do support Again, we are trying to be on a timeline here trying to explain what this Lollapalooza of liars has done what they have ignored What they haven't told you

47:43.853 --> 47:48.295
and how they did it, how they accomplished it, what this limited spectrum of debate was, actually.

47:48.335 --> 47:50.816
And what it was, of course, was this mystery.

47:51.236 --> 47:55.398
And how you can see it are the ways that they ignore each other as well.

47:56.219 --> 48:10.425
One of the recent examples I gave was the fact that the NCI in Canada is listing Jessica Rose a Brownstone Fellow, which means she gets money from Brownstone, and an IMA Senior Fellow, which means she gets money from that.

48:10.985 --> 48:18.069
and she has a lucrative substack, and she's a surfer, is a Canadian researcher with five post-secondary degrees.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.251
And that is a lie.

48:21.431 --> 48:24.373
A post-secondary degree, what they mean is a post-doc.

48:25.714 --> 48:29.076
And they all know that that's a really bullshit line.

48:29.116 --> 48:31.077
She's never even had a faculty position.

48:32.216 --> 48:43.104
So these degrees just mean that she spent some time in somebody's lab that you could call a molecular biologist, that you could call an immunologist, that you could call a computational biology lab.

48:43.164 --> 48:45.545
And so then she has a degree in that.

48:46.386 --> 48:56.513
If I did a postdoc in a lab that was a molecular neuropsychiatry lab, am I now, do I have a degree in neuropsychiatry?

48:56.994 --> 48:57.494
Apparently.

49:01.502 --> 49:29.261
And so this lie, which is really a bold lie from someone who has hundreds of thousands of followers and has convinced hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people that the spike protein in 2021 was to be feared, that the spike protein might be the cause of all kinds of things, and that VAERS was showing a signal that it had never shown before, this person is completely ignored

49:30.356 --> 49:49.292
by these no virus people that have spent lots and lots of time attacking me, writing letters about me, doing streams about me, even streaming with other people about me, but never even mentioned Robert Malone or Jessica Rose, never even mentioned them.

49:51.234 --> 49:54.737
And that's how you can see that it is one coordinated,

49:56.019 --> 50:03.482
sort of operation where these people are all playing some role that is akin to like Epigirl in the Spars pandemic document.

50:08.464 --> 50:09.124
JJ?

50:09.464 --> 50:10.344
Sorry, yes, go ahead.

50:10.524 --> 50:12.805
And so that's why, again, I put this here.

50:13.145 --> 50:14.466
All these people ignore

50:15.566 --> 50:38.728
Jessica Rose's blatantly fraudulent CV, blatantly fraudulent claims of expertise, blatantly obvious CV with NATO supported postdocs and virology that includes simulations of viral replication and also like something to do with HIV.

50:41.201 --> 50:51.169
And all of these people who claim none of those things exist ignore the one that claims not only do they exist, but she's got five degrees in it.

50:55.532 --> 50:57.434
That's what this lively debate is.

50:57.514 --> 50:58.975
That's what the limited spectrum is.

50:59.035 --> 51:06.341
And so then you interact with these people on social media and you think you're making progress, but you're really not because the cartoon was already written.

51:08.464 --> 51:10.245
The play was already written.

51:10.305 --> 51:11.947
These people already have their lines.

51:12.007 --> 51:21.094
And so they can incorporate you with a little impromptu improvisation, but they don't need to worry because they know that you're not going to be in the next scene anyway.

51:24.372 --> 51:38.836
And I experienced this over and over and over again during the pandemic, group after group after group that held me on for about nine months each time, making me run in their hamster wheel, thinking that if I could just convince this group, then I would make progress.

51:38.876 --> 51:39.816
And then they threw me out.

51:40.237 --> 51:42.857
Then I would get in another group and then they would eventually ignore me.

51:42.877 --> 51:44.898
Then I'd get in another group and they'd eventually ignore.

51:44.938 --> 51:48.719
And this happened many, many, many times over five years.

51:50.703 --> 52:05.414
And the truths that have come out of it are that transfection in healthy people is wrong, that basically RNA virology is based on synthetic recombinant DNA, and that an intramuscular injection of medicine is probably dumb.

52:05.614 --> 52:09.197
And since I've said it, no one has ever been able to say, yeah, but.

52:19.215 --> 52:21.496
And we're still left with the history of Brandy Vaughn, right?

52:21.616 --> 52:27.458
The one that was putting up billboards in San Francisco in 2016 that said all vaccines do is harm people.

52:28.459 --> 52:32.900
The same Brandy Vaughn that's in this picture with Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:33.161 --> 52:39.343
and James Lyons Weiler and Judy Mikovits in 2019 and who dies in December of 2020.

52:39.723 --> 52:44.265
They all got in front of her.

52:45.205 --> 52:51.649
They all had a limited spectrum of debate that they were told to enforce, write a book about, and you'll be okay, you'll be part of this.

52:52.289 --> 52:54.871
James Lyons Weiler is a traitor to our grandkids.

52:55.471 --> 53:04.396
Paul Thomas is probably an unwitting participant, although at this point he's gotta be sophisticated enough to understand that a delayed vaccine schedule is bullshit.

53:05.597 --> 53:10.239
It might be safer than no vaccines because development is real.

53:11.840 --> 53:12.401
In other words,

53:13.351 --> 53:19.453
If you, if the earlier you vaccinate, the earlier you poison a baby, the worse off they are.

53:19.553 --> 53:37.539
So if you really want to screw up a fetus, you should do it in, you know, at the 36 cell stage or something like that, you know, when, or the 64 cell stage, when, when the entire organism can be screwed up, that will usually result in an abortion, a miscarriage.

53:39.110 --> 53:40.870
So this is what we're dealing with.

53:40.890 --> 53:44.911
We're dealing with, yeah, it's a limited spectrum of debate again, because yeah, it's true.

53:45.371 --> 53:54.133
A delayed vaccine schedule, if you could delay all the shots until they're two years old, there's no doubt that those kids will be better off than the kids that it wasn't delayed in.

53:54.934 --> 53:56.414
That doesn't mean that they'll be great.

53:57.014 --> 54:00.555
It doesn't mean that intramuscular injection is okay at age two.

54:04.136 --> 54:05.576
It does mean it's less dangerous.

54:06.926 --> 54:13.987
just like probably shooting a newborn in the chest is more dangerous than shooting a 20-year-old in the chest.

54:20.029 --> 54:35.692
And Stephanie Seneff, of course, of MIT computer science fame, is sure that the autism epidemic is gonna be one in two children by 2060, and it's all because of glyphosate, like Robert Malone just recently wrote on his Substack in 2025.

54:38.413 --> 54:39.674
So just listen to Polly.

54:40.214 --> 54:50.338
That the other side, without a doubt, do not want the public, the people, the parents to hear the stories of the unvaccinated.

54:50.358 --> 54:55.200
They want us to talk about MMR, autism, Andrew Wakefield.

54:55.220 --> 54:59.462
They want that to go down the same path every single time because they can attack us.

54:59.822 --> 55:07.045
But you cannot attack the generations and generations of the health of the unvaccinated.

55:07.826 --> 55:11.487
Vax2 doesn't even begin to cover the health of the unvaccinated.

55:11.627 --> 55:13.088
We uncovered so much.

55:13.588 --> 55:19.769
We uncovered generations and generations standing there saying, we've never had any cancer in our family.

55:20.270 --> 55:22.910
We've never had rheumatoid arthritis in our family.

55:23.110 --> 55:24.291
We've never had diabetes.

55:24.331 --> 55:24.891
We've never had

55:25.555 --> 55:29.739
Any of these things that you see that are just common elderly conditions.

55:30.800 --> 55:34.824
Now, what does this also suggest that I've never said before, which I should have said before?

55:35.344 --> 55:42.371
It suggests, of course, a very malevolent reasoning for why they would look for genes for cancer.

55:43.272 --> 55:49.257
Of course, if my posit is correct and that cancer is different every time it happens,

55:51.054 --> 56:06.293
Then but it can all be basically based on on similar mechanisms, but it happens for different reasons You know just like a flat tire is not a uniform cause Boy, we're studying and we just can't figure it out you know that that

56:07.361 --> 56:19.169
this idea that vaccine damage occurs is the only thing we need to think about and not try to define it amongst a small number of manifestations.

56:19.229 --> 56:23.112
And that is a very, very important message that she's saying here.

56:23.492 --> 56:34.059
If we talk about Wakefield and autism, then we're missing out on the fact that unvaccinated kids are ridiculously healthy and intelligent and beautiful and never get sick and don't have cancer.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.701
And it actually is, you can see it in

56:37.881 --> 56:38.622
in families.

56:40.322 --> 56:51.627
And so what's important to understand is that people like Kevin McKernan and his brothers are working on cures that are based on the idea that there are genetic causes for cancer.

56:52.847 --> 56:58.410
And that's very different than the dysregulation of a particular gene, and that's how cancer is manifesting.

56:58.910 --> 57:00.991
That's not the cause, that's the mechanism.

57:02.991 --> 57:04.772
And they want you to think it's the cause.

57:04.852 --> 57:06.773
The gene is not the cause.

57:08.971 --> 57:18.438
Just because you have race tires on your car doesn't mean that you're, you know, that that explains why the nail pops your tire and doesn't pop his tire.

57:18.498 --> 57:21.881
No, that only works for people with mind-proof tires.

57:21.921 --> 57:30.508
Then yeah, those guys, there's an explanation, but the difference between my tires and race tires are negligible if you have the right puncture.

57:35.154 --> 57:36.955
And I think this is extraordinary.

57:37.035 --> 57:48.702
I think this is really important to see because one of the pretenses of the Human Genome Project is based on this idea that cancer has a genetic cause.

57:49.122 --> 57:50.963
It is a genetic dysregulation.

57:51.003 --> 57:53.004
Therefore, it needs a genetic solution.

57:53.565 --> 57:59.048
This is a real impetus in cancer biology that goes across subfields.

57:59.861 --> 58:07.288
And so it's important to see this unifying idea that, wait a minute, they're telling us that the transfection is causing turbo cancers.

58:08.129 --> 58:25.525
Mark Kulak has uncovered this network that was set up specifically to back up and store data about something to do with the health of the American military around the same time that they were talking about revamping a vaccine schedule in the military.

58:26.769 --> 58:30.412
And who was arguing about that on some random congressional call?

58:30.873 --> 58:35.837
Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Veera Sharma in 2011?

58:41.202 --> 58:42.043
Or when was that?

58:42.363 --> 58:43.044
Maybe I'm wrong.

58:43.104 --> 58:46.387
Maybe, maybe, maybe somebody's in the chat that can correct this.

58:46.427 --> 58:51.692
This is a, this is a, this is the central message here.

58:53.049 --> 58:57.312
that at some point in time, a lot of these people have said it very, very well.

58:57.372 --> 59:07.900
It's even possible that Brandy had had so much positive influence on Polly that Polly was finally trying to say it right and actually getting better at saying it right.

59:08.460 --> 59:10.222
They want you to argue about Wakefield.

59:10.262 --> 59:16.667
That's an amazing statement coming from someone who essentially moved to the United States with Andrew Wakefield.

59:17.367 --> 59:19.929
to do the same thing that she did in the UK.

59:20.129 --> 59:25.153
She had to know that she was being moved over here to do the same thing that she did in the UK.

59:25.594 --> 59:28.236
She was on like 90 billboards in the UK.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.321
She helped elect a prime minister.

59:41.967 --> 59:42.227
Sorry.

59:46.277 --> 59:52.703
And so that's why James Linesweiler was at the beginning of the pandemic, where he was, knowing what he was, and why he's in this weird photo.

59:53.530 --> 59:56.512
That's the reason why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:56.552 --> 01:00:04.378
is promoting Judy Mikovits by telling her story from his house with her present in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:20.090
They are actually taking over, stepping in front of this narrative to be the populist resistance to the COVID narrative and make sure that there were no legitimate actors like Brandy Vaughn having any real influence.

01:00:22.256 --> 01:00:24.861
About five months after this, Brandy would be dead.

01:00:30.993 --> 01:00:31.214
Right?

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.536
I mean, that's the reality.

01:00:34.973 --> 01:01:03.947
10 months after the lab leak is declared by Steve Bannon, 10 months after Kevin McKernan has done his podcast series with the Vance Crowe guy from the World Bank, 10 months of Brett Weinstein performing the Glasses, Woodshop Goggles, and Bandana Act, and the lockdowns work, and we should still be going for zero COVID, Brandi's dead.

01:01:06.423 --> 01:01:11.805
Six months after Brandy's dead is when Robert Malone comes on Brett Weinstein's podcast for the first time.

01:01:12.365 --> 01:01:16.326
Now, I know I use this all the time, but I want to use it again.

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:19.367
Please hear this just for what it is.

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:23.028
You know, they put people in place.

01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:27.530
There is no way to explain this.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:34.092
And I know it's easy to see with somebody like Shapiro, somebody like, uh,

01:01:36.682 --> 01:01:40.364
Like this English guy, can't remember his name off the top of my head, sorry, Pierce Morgan.

01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:45.866
Pierce Morgan is put in place by somebody who pays him to be there, right?

01:01:46.406 --> 01:01:50.168
It's harder to see that actually Ben Shapiro was also done like this.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.249
That's how they do it.

01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:56.931
They groom them, not in a weird way, just like you do in the minor leagues.

01:01:56.991 --> 01:02:01.893
First, he's a guest a few times, they give him a Breitbart thing, and then, you know, he rises.

01:02:01.973 --> 01:02:04.774
It's the same thing they did with all of these people.

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:15.255
That's why in 2015 and in 2025, we're still arguing with Paul Offit, who was first arguing with Mary Holland.

01:02:15.295 --> 01:02:22.800
And now I want to go back to 2013 and listen to this, which you can also find on my website, stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:30.665
I'm going to briefly pause here to get this clipped out and put it here in the chat.

01:02:30.886 --> 01:02:31.526
There you go.

01:02:32.106 --> 01:02:36.209
And then I'm going to open this thing and I'm going to listen to it.

01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:40.216
Let me see where I put it.

01:02:40.816 --> 01:02:41.496
Where did I put it?

01:02:42.056 --> 01:02:42.357
Here?

01:02:43.377 --> 01:02:43.617
Yes.

01:02:45.538 --> 01:02:47.519
So we're listening to this recording.

01:02:47.539 --> 01:02:49.400
Well my baby was a child so strong

01:03:07.439 --> 01:03:11.621
baby, never did no wrong.

01:03:12.521 --> 01:03:20.064
Then they took her to that infant doctor.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:27.287
They took a needle and shot her.

01:03:30.329 --> 01:03:36.391
That evening, she stopped breathing, her face turned

01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:38.745
Good to see everybody in the chat.

01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:42.308
I haven't been reading it very much, I apologize.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:58.961
While this is playing in, I would remind you that when we went to the Brownstone

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:12.445
When we went to the Brownstone event in November of 2024, it was the same weekend that we had the live gigaohm event here in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

01:04:12.665 --> 01:04:18.909
And Mark Kulak and I and Joe Marshall went to the Brownstone meeting that was in Pittsburgh.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:26.675
And at that event, Jeffrey Tucker came over to me not knowing who I was and

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:32.685
I don't remember exactly how he said it, but he said something like, I don't think you're having a very good time here.

01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:42.391
And I just, I wanna know if you're having a good time and then I don't want you to, I don't want you to do something.

01:04:42.651 --> 01:04:44.672
I don't know what it was, confront other people.

01:04:45.032 --> 01:04:50.075
He didn't declare that I was gonna be violent or anything like that, but he did come over to warn me somehow.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:50.876
It was weird.

01:04:53.017 --> 01:04:55.699
And he didn't come over to warn me in a nice way.

01:04:55.739 --> 01:04:56.339
It was really very,

01:04:58.078 --> 01:05:00.400
attempting to be intimidating.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:06.286
Of course, he wasn't as tall as me and his handshake, like they all are, was very clammy and weak.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:10.631
And so it's hard to intimidate somebody like that, but he tried.

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:13.453
You know, he's the guy with the big bow tie and stuff.

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:21.361
And what's neat is that Mark was standing right there and he could see that I was about ready, you know, something was about to break.

01:05:22.443 --> 01:05:31.014
And so he just kind of stepped in and said, hey, you know, I'm Mark Hulak and started talking to him and laid it right to him, like went right to the hole and dunked.

01:05:31.034 --> 01:05:33.238
He's just like, you know, I don't know if you're aware.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:42.633
but the whole drop in life expectancy in America can basically be explained by the opioid pandemic and none of these fools are saying it and somebody should say it.

01:05:43.453 --> 01:05:47.215
And it was pretty extraordinary because he said that, oh, I mean, that's very interesting.

01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:48.155
I have to look into it.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.556
And of course he hasn't said anything since.

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:50.896
Okay.

01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:51.757
So let's let this go.

01:05:51.777 --> 01:05:53.717
Remember this is Brian Hooker.

01:05:53.737 --> 01:05:58.219
Uh, and it is, um, it is in 2013.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.421
the music you just heard because of what I just heard.

01:06:03.441 --> 01:06:05.562
There was nothing we could do.

01:06:05.582 --> 01:06:11.326
We could not stop his young five-week-old infant daughter from dying in front of his eyes.

01:06:12.006 --> 01:06:19.270
Five weeks old, healthy, vibrant, given a hep B shot, and died 15 hours later.

01:06:21.051 --> 01:06:23.432
And it's hard to discuss it.

01:06:24.073 --> 01:06:27.675
You know, I can't imagine what it's like to go through the actual experience.

01:06:28.328 --> 01:06:33.711
And of course, the one who suffered the most was the little infant girl.

01:06:34.652 --> 01:06:42.857
But the other insidious and most insidious aspect of this whole story is that they found what was obviously vaccine damage.

01:06:42.897 --> 01:06:48.480
It was brain damage in the coroner's office in the days following the little girl's death.

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:50.481
And they informed the family of this.

01:06:51.762 --> 01:06:56.305
A coroner called the family and spoke to Mr. Belkin and told him on the phone,

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.390
We found brain damage in your daughter.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:04.055
Brain damage is the indication of an encephalitic reaction to a vaccine.

01:07:04.595 --> 01:07:07.418
It's a common, serious, adverse reaction.

01:07:07.998 --> 01:07:12.742
In the Merck manual, vaccines are listed as a cause of encephalitis.

01:07:14.423 --> 01:07:23.711
And yet a few days later, Mr. Gulkin got another phone call that drew him down to the coroner's office, standing face to face with that same woman, who now adopted a very

01:07:24.784 --> 01:07:35.129
told Mr. Belkin that they were going to list the girl's death as sudden infant death syndrome, while the coroner supervisor sat across the room carefully monitoring the conversation.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:40.231
So this was coming down from the hierarchy.

01:07:41.092 --> 01:07:49.936
It was being- And so the first thing to get from this, all right, in case you're not processing it yet, is that SIDS, when we were growing up, was a lie.

01:07:52.046 --> 01:07:53.327
That's the best way to say it.

01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:56.189
When we were growing up, they did 60 minutes about SIDS.

01:07:56.249 --> 01:07:59.191
They did, you know, news spots about SIDS.

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:00.972
SIDS was a lie.

01:08:02.534 --> 01:08:03.774
SIDS is vaccine death.

01:08:05.876 --> 01:08:06.596
Plain and simple.

01:08:07.197 --> 01:08:10.399
SIDS is vaccine mythology.

01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:18.665
Sure, through virtual surveillance right there in her office, that a new message was given to the Belgians and

01:08:19.381 --> 01:08:24.544
Not surprisingly, Mr. Belkin has been very, very active in the vaccine awareness community since they have two other kids.

01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:26.204
One of them now plays drums in his band.

01:08:26.224 --> 01:08:32.768
It's called The Refusers, the name based on the fact that once you're vaccine aware, you refuse the vaccinations.

01:08:33.728 --> 01:08:37.810
And there is not a mention anywhere to be found in the little girl's record of the brain damage.

01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:40.711
OK, that having been said, let's get to our guest.

01:08:40.731 --> 01:08:44.733
I'm glad to welcome Brian Hooker, who is a PhD in biochemical engineering to the program.

01:08:44.994 --> 01:08:45.354
Hi, Brian.

01:08:45.374 --> 01:08:45.914
Welcome to the show.

01:08:46.394 --> 01:08:46.814
Hi, Sean.

01:08:46.834 --> 01:08:47.795
Hey, thanks so much for having me.

01:08:48.197 --> 01:08:54.681
Sure, and again, folks, I'm here with co-host for today, at least, Sherry Nockin, known as Vaccine Dangers in the vaccine awareness world.

01:08:54.701 --> 01:08:59.023
Sherry's been a homeopath for several decades and very active in the vaccine awareness community.

01:08:59.643 --> 01:09:04.766
Okay, Brian, would you please tell us what it was that initially brought you to research vaccines?

01:09:04.806 --> 01:09:15.972
And then we'll get into some of the very active work you have participated in, for instance, helping instigate the recent congressional hearings, the newly held congressional hearings on autism.

01:09:16.523 --> 01:09:16.983
Right, right.

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:33.529
Well, my background and training is specifically in biotechnology, and I spent a sizable portion of my career working on making hemophilia drugs with plants, actually with genetically modified plants, which is a whole other topic.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.831
I don't appreciate what's going on right now with GMOs.

01:09:36.871 --> 01:09:37.271
In fact, when

01:09:38.084 --> 01:09:39.045
I was working with my plants.

01:09:39.386 --> 01:09:40.787
They were only for medicinal purposes.

01:09:40.827 --> 01:09:44.290
They were not for human consumption in terms of food substances.

01:09:44.491 --> 01:09:45.492
The whole thing is very alarming.

01:09:45.652 --> 01:09:49.075
I don't want to get off topic, but I do want to have that proviso.

01:09:49.676 --> 01:09:51.418
So that's already very funny, right?

01:09:51.458 --> 01:09:57.804
Because he worked on genetically modified plants to make medicines for hemophiliacs.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:08.882
And that is so not very far away from what Kevin McKernan would like to do with all of his weed genetics and weed breeding and whatever else they're doing.

01:10:09.363 --> 01:10:13.525
He says that it's about, you know, virions and pathogens.

01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:14.246
It's not at all.

01:10:14.326 --> 01:10:20.950
It's about transitioning to personalized medicine and what different ways personalized medicine will actually manifest itself.

01:10:21.711 --> 01:10:23.612
And one of them will be personalized weed.

01:10:23.872 --> 01:10:24.513
I'm sure of it.

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:26.154
Why not?

01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:50.024
But from the perspective of his understanding of what's going on, he could not have worked for years on genetically modified plants and modifying the genetics of plants without understanding what transfection and transformation were.

01:10:51.144 --> 01:10:52.005
It's impossible.

01:10:53.476 --> 01:10:58.041
It's also impossible that he doesn't know that the SV40 story is bullshit.

01:10:58.882 --> 01:10:59.843
It's not possible.

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:12.893
He probably used SV40 in those 15 years of transforming plants at some point and was exposed to that same pathogen and all the potential it has to express things in your gut just like now.

01:11:13.354 --> 01:11:16.416
It's just absurd to think that they're telling that story.

01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:22.081
But even worse is that to think that this guy who's telling you right now in 2013 that he has

01:11:24.462 --> 01:11:29.445
15 years or 16 years of experience in biotechnology with genetically modified plants.

01:11:31.506 --> 01:11:34.107
Claims he didn't know what transfection was in 2020.

01:11:36.288 --> 01:11:39.990
Claims that he's just calling them vaccines because, you know, they're vaccines.

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.732
That's what Fauci and Collins say they are.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.873
Kevin McKernan says they're vaccines.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:45.913
I guess they're vaccines.

01:11:48.715 --> 01:11:50.156
I'm trying not to be upset here.

01:11:50.981 --> 01:12:08.710
But what I'm trying to suggest to you and remind you is that I was a staff scientist under the direct supervision of Brian Hooker at Children's Health Defense, and I did not know that he had 16 years working on genetically modified plants when I told him about transfection.

01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:17.455
And he certainly didn't tell me that he knew all about SV40 and DNA plasmids and transformation

01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:22.898
Because he has 15 years of experience doing it for the government.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:38.246
Before I sort of launch into anything else, but I was very in tune with the FDA regulatory process, how that applied to biologics, biologic products, and so forth.

01:12:38.786 --> 01:12:40.047
And I was

01:12:42.337 --> 01:12:46.600
also very much active in statistical analysis.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:13:04.092
So the FDA regulatory process with regard to biologics, which is a really interesting thing, of course, that was central to the pandemic narrative, and that obfuscating the truth of that was central to the pandemic narrative.

01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:06.274
What an interesting thing to be an expert in, in 2013.

01:13:12.665 --> 01:13:22.750
And so I did a lot of, as a part of my graduate work, as a part of my career, I was a researcher at National Laboratory for 17 years.

01:13:23.831 --> 01:13:29.854
I was doing a lot of statistical analysis in line with these biological products that we were trying to produce.

01:13:30.554 --> 01:13:34.656
So I had a lot of experience in biotechnology and in the drug industry as well.

01:13:36.127 --> 01:13:40.330
but I did not know very much about vaccines except for what my pediatrician.

01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:42.472
Doesn't that sound a lot like Brandy?

01:13:43.993 --> 01:13:46.255
Doesn't that sound a lot like Brandy?

01:13:49.938 --> 01:13:55.923
You have a lot of expertise and everything else, but I just didn't know vaccines were so shitty and so different and so dumb.

01:13:58.186 --> 01:13:59.527
Wow, this is extraordinary.

01:13:59.567 --> 01:14:06.134
He's got all the requisite background knowledge in 2013 to know everything that my dumb ass didn't figure out until 2022.

01:14:08.826 --> 01:14:09.127
told me.

01:14:09.567 --> 01:14:10.407
My son's a pediatrician.

01:14:11.088 --> 01:14:12.909
My son had all of his vaccinations on time.

01:14:12.969 --> 01:14:15.231
His name is Steve and he's 15 years old now.

01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:31.381
He was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine that he received that could have thimerosal, thimerosal is the mercury-containing organic preservative that they used in vaccines and still use in some instances, but he had a very very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines

01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:39.988
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

01:14:40.088 --> 01:14:41.269
I don't like the word autism.

01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:42.710
He was actually damaged.

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:50.577
He was neurologically damaged and he's still suffering with many of the effects of that initial damage done at 15 months.

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:51.998
And so he regressed rather.

01:14:52.538 --> 01:14:56.882
And so here's Brian Hooker explaining very clearly that he doesn't like the word autism.

01:14:58.114 --> 01:15:01.757
because he doesn't think it's adequate to describe what happened.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:02.757
It's inaccurate.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:03.958
It's misleading.

01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:06.260
I don't know why he doesn't like it, but it's obvious.

01:15:07.621 --> 01:15:09.442
His son is vaccine damaged.

01:15:10.483 --> 01:15:16.167
If you got hit by a car and then they called it autism, you wouldn't really want it to be called autism.

01:15:16.187 --> 01:15:18.569
You'd want to say that, well, my son was hit by a car.

01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:19.930
That's why he's in a wheelchair.

01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:24.293
He's not handicapped because it's genetic.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:28.853
It's not handicapped because he had some gene called MTFR.

01:15:34.217 --> 01:15:41.863
That's the illusion that they are teaching our children, that they are teaching in universities, that these academic biologists are unwittingly perpetuating.

01:15:42.444 --> 01:15:48.369
The idea is very obvious now, if you listen to this 2013 Brian Hooker person.

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:54.299
It's not, I don't like the word autism either.

01:15:54.439 --> 01:15:57.044
Quite frankly, I don't think anyone likes that word.

01:15:57.224 --> 01:16:00.671
I think it's much better to call it, call it what he just said.

01:16:01.815 --> 01:16:05.157
regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

01:16:05.257 --> 01:16:06.437
I don't like the word autism.

01:16:07.078 --> 01:16:07.898
He was vaccine damaged.

01:16:08.138 --> 01:16:15.762
He was neurologically damaged, and he's still suffering with many of the effects of that initial damage done at 15 months.

01:16:15.902 --> 01:16:16.702
And so he regressed.

01:16:16.802 --> 01:16:21.865
And so this is not a genetic cause, an environmental cause.

01:16:21.925 --> 01:16:24.666
This is an acute neurological assault.

01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:29.689
Don't call it autism if he got hit by a car.

01:16:33.168 --> 01:16:39.153
You would never call it autism if he was playing baseball and took an aluminum baseball bat to his temple.

01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:41.715
He wouldn't say, well, my kids got autism.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:53.526
And that is what this person, 2013 Brian Hooker, is very, very clearly saying.

01:16:58.426 --> 01:17:01.888
rather quickly into neurological difficulties.

01:17:01.928 --> 01:17:06.650
He lost language and we lost eye contact.

01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:08.211
He was staring at lights, things like that.

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:18.497
And within weeks of the initial vaccinations, he got five vaccines while he had an active ear infection, which is a big no-no.

01:17:18.697 --> 01:17:20.898
It's contraindicated even if you look at the packet insert.

01:17:22.135 --> 01:17:30.601
But within weeks we saw profound regression and it continued in a downward cycle until he was about two years old and then it started to stabilize at that point.

01:17:30.761 --> 01:17:36.485
OK, and you as a parent, there's not a single doubt in your mind about the connection between the vaccinations and the subsequent regression.

01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:37.266
No, not at all.

01:17:38.027 --> 01:17:59.154
uh it was it was apparent uh at the time that he received the vaccines and um it was uh just to be aware i am playing this at 1.33 speed so brian doesn't talk faster in the past just to make sure you know and pointed out i didn't even know that the vaccinations that he received contained mercury until we had the fortunate experience of working with specialists

01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:16.804
who was a part of the Defeat Autism Now movement when my son was about 30 months old, but that physician alerted us and who became, you know, essentially my son's primary doctor at that point, is that Tamarazol was in the vaccines and we did the calculation and I was astounded by the amount of mercury that my son received in the vaccines.

01:18:17.404 --> 01:18:28.390
Not only that, but as my knowledge has grown, I'm astounded and I continue to be astounded by the poor design of these particular therapeutics

01:18:28.931 --> 01:18:31.573
and the poor rationale for vaccinating in the first place.

01:18:31.854 --> 01:18:35.176
The poor rationale for vaccinating in the first place.

01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:45.185
It sounds like he's very close to saying that vaccination as it currently manifests, which is intramuscular injection, is dumb.

01:18:47.487 --> 01:18:54.493
Sounds like he's trying to say it's sophisticated enough so that he can't get shot for it, but he pretty much knows already that it's just dumb.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:02.936
And so after all this time, I guess big top tent of health freedom is really as far as he's gotten.

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:04.697
Gotcha.

01:19:05.318 --> 01:19:16.344
Let me ask you, what were your doctors, several or one if that was the case, immediate reaction to, I'm sure what was a call to them to describe what the consequences were after the vaccination?

01:19:16.364 --> 01:19:17.525
It was pretty much dismissal.

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:41.367
that oh it's you know it's just an unfortunate coincidence um we uh had to file uh the VAERS report um when when a child is vaccine injured the physician is supposed to file a report with uh what the CDC calls VAERS which is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Service uh system excuse me and uh the physician would not file the report we had to file the report directly in my and um

01:19:41.867 --> 01:19:55.197
my wife and I and also my mother who was a former public health nurse filed the VAERS report and did the VAERS follow-up and the physician didn't want any part of it and quite frankly at that point we didn't really want any part of her and we found a new pediatrician right away.

01:19:55.677 --> 01:20:00.801
Understood and so everybody in the audience realizes that VAERS is a system that is supposed to record

01:20:01.613 --> 01:20:05.414
any events that take place temporarily related to the vaccinations.

01:20:05.994 --> 01:20:12.376
And they don't necessarily have to be claimed by the physician at all as being causally related by the vaccines.

01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:14.536
That is supposed to be determined by further research.

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.817
But the events are supposed to be reported.

01:20:16.857 --> 01:20:24.979
This system was set up in 1986 with the act that also removed the liability from the vaccine industry for any damage that their toxic bruise may cause.

01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:28.400
But that's why the system was set up to keep track ostensibly

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:37.622
of the events, but they're only supposed to be reports of events that are temporally related, as were the events that took place in your son's life after the vaccines he was given.

01:20:37.903 --> 01:20:44.525
There's no excuse in the world for the physician to have refused to associate herself with a VAERS report.

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:53.267
It was very difficult and- Just to address something in the chat where Reginald says the kids are not all right, I tend to agree with you.

01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:58.869
If you hit your kid over the head with a baseball bat and tomorrow he seems okay, is he?

01:21:00.525 --> 01:21:01.525
Are you ever gonna know?

01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:04.786
You know, I mean that that's what we're dealing with here.

01:21:04.866 --> 01:21:14.968
That is reality And now we're doing the same thing with social media with our kids over years of time where we're just like well Whatever they're on it.

01:21:15.048 --> 01:21:16.048
So I guess they're on it.

01:21:16.088 --> 01:21:17.328
That's what all the kids are doing.

01:21:17.428 --> 01:21:24.629
So whatever Even if it could permanently screw them up emotionally or socially.

01:21:24.689 --> 01:21:25.329
Well, I don't know.

01:21:25.389 --> 01:21:29.590
I guess it's just gonna happen then Ladies and gentlemen

01:21:32.045 --> 01:21:43.353
We are gonna be remembered as a group of adults that were abject failures to our children if we don't rise and resist right now in a real way and know what we're rising against and know what we're resisting.

01:21:45.355 --> 01:21:47.316
No more abstract bullshit.

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:54.021
We need to be like 2013 Brian Hooker apparently.

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:58.244
We were questioned a lot in terms of our intent

01:21:58.895 --> 01:22:04.538
and our scientific acumen, it was a little easier for me because, you know, I have a PhD in biochemical engineering.

01:22:04.979 --> 01:22:08.061
So I could look at the evidence and say, yeah, we need to file a VAERS report.

01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:17.666
And the physician, you know, of course, most physicians will attempt to talk down, allopaths will attempt to talk down to their patients and parents.

01:22:18.547 --> 01:22:22.229
But at this point, you know, I had a scientific background.

01:22:23.222 --> 01:22:25.363
I don't know if I did not have the background.

01:22:25.403 --> 01:22:26.824
I don't know if I would have filed a VAERS report.

01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:29.145
I don't know if I would have pushed it because it took a lot of pushing to do.

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:35.228
Well, you can see right there how there's such a room for non-reporting.

01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:41.132
One of the former FDA commissioners, Kessler, thought it was maybe only 1% are reported.

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:46.934
And it's a law that they have to report it, but there is no teeth in that law, no consequences.

01:22:48.075 --> 01:22:48.916
There's absolutely none.

01:22:49.216 --> 01:22:50.536
And I would say 1% would be

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:53.331
about right.

01:22:53.411 --> 01:22:58.794
And if you look at 1% in the VAERS reports, the VAERS is publicly accessible.

01:22:59.295 --> 01:23:03.678
You can do a Google search on VAERS and the public can access that database.

01:23:04.298 --> 01:23:15.025
Also, there's a better website that has a better interface to the database by the National Vaccine Information Center by Barbara Lowe Fisher, her organization.

01:23:15.486 --> 01:23:18.888
And you can look at the actual adverse events reports

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.068
And the things that are astounding are the numbers.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:27.153
If that's really 1% of all the vaccine injuries that occur in the United States, but there are many more vaccine injuries.

01:23:27.613 --> 01:23:33.878
Then I've ever been, you know, then pharmaceutical industry or the CDC was ever left.

01:23:34.839 --> 01:23:35.980
Absolutely, from the music.

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.161
Obviously we're coming down to the first break.

01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:38.202
This is a vaccine.

01:23:38.262 --> 01:23:44.187
If an issue of trust and yes, I'll point out that there are over 5000 VAERS reports of vaccine associated death alone.

01:23:44.267 --> 01:23:44.447
Hang on.

01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:53.999
I appreciate you having me on the show.

01:23:54.019 --> 01:23:56.679
I started to get involved and interested in the whole issue of

01:24:14.661 --> 01:24:21.348
scientific malfeasance specifically within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding vaccines and autism back in 2004.

01:24:21.729 --> 01:24:30.739
And I was following the Institute of Medicine at the time was having what they call the Immunization Review Committee and the review committee actually held a series of nine meetings.

01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:41.033
And the final meeting, which was in 2004, basically the Immunization Safety Review Committee declared that there was no relationship between vaccines and autism.

01:24:41.573 --> 01:24:45.115
They only considered two issues, which is really less than Tiffany Iceberg.

01:24:45.135 --> 01:24:50.818
They looked at the MMR in autism, you know, based on what they did to disparage Andy Wakefield's work.

01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:54.900
And I'm a good friend of Andy's and I have incredible respect for his scientific veracity.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:04.722
One of the few MDs that I know, actually that's good research, MDs tend to be fairly poor researchers, if I can make a broad brush, but Andy is so impeccable with his work.

01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:11.984
But getting back to the Institute of Medicine, they looked at the MMR and said that there's no relationship between the MMR and autism, despite lots of evidence to the contrary.

01:25:12.284 --> 01:25:16.005
And then with the maricel, they looked and said that there was no evidence

01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:19.494
and that there was a connection between thimerosal and autism.

01:25:19.894 --> 01:25:28.885
And specifically on the thimerosal issue, they only looked at epidemiology, and the only epidemiology that they looked at were these five studies that were directly tied to the Centers for Disease Control.

01:25:29.566 --> 01:25:32.710
And as a parent and as a scientist, that really didn't pass the smell test for me.

01:25:33.271 --> 01:25:41.995
And so I started to look at what CDC was claiming in these studies and going to the open scientific literature and going through the statistics.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:47.517
And the more concern that I got, the greater my desire was to get the background information.

01:25:47.877 --> 01:26:00.383
And so I started submitting a Freedom of Information Act request in 2004 to the CDC and also to the FDA, as well as the other branches within the HHS that are specific around the vaccination program for the United States.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:22.477
Since that time, I've submitted about 120 FOIA requests to the CDC, and as the information started to come out, as the CDC very sparingly was sharing information to me, I saw a consistent pattern to cover up any type of vaccine adverse event in general, especially if it was a neurological sequelae vaccine.

01:26:24.338 --> 01:26:30.601
There is just a concerted effort on their part to... I just want to state this here.

01:26:33.723 --> 01:26:38.665
It strikes me as odd that he sent 120 FOIA requests.

01:26:39.445 --> 01:26:40.366
And let me say why.

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:45.648
Because in order to get a FOIA request for free, you need to claim you're a media person.

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:48.350
And you need to claim you are a journalist.

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.111
Otherwise, they can charge you.

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:55.400
So 120 requests is a lot of requests.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.363
Like in all these years, I haven't actually managed to file one yet.

01:27:02.804 --> 01:27:08.307
I'm thinking about filing a bunch, but it's very different to say you've filed 120 and also gotten results, which is...

01:27:12.088 --> 01:27:13.468
in and of itself quite extraordinary.

01:27:13.488 --> 01:27:17.169
I'm not saying it's wrong or incorrect, I'm just, it's notable.

01:27:17.409 --> 01:27:29.352
Fraud to cherry pick data, to minimize results that are reported, and to always come down on the side that vaccines do not cause neurological damage, period.

01:27:30.452 --> 01:27:33.653
Right, and these are the folks who are supposed to be guarding the health of the nation.

01:27:34.133 --> 01:27:35.513
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:27:35.653 --> 01:27:39.814
The CDC's paradigm that they use is that vaccines are safe until proven otherwise.

01:27:40.504 --> 01:27:42.766
And first of all, that's completely backwards.

01:27:43.687 --> 01:27:54.975
The government should, the onus should be on their backs to prove that anything that I put in my body or my child's body or my wife's body or anybody, and remember, vaccinations are mandated by law.

01:27:56.076 --> 01:28:01.180
And even the exemptions, the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC are trying very, very hard to make sure that those go away.

01:28:01.764 --> 01:28:08.710
And so therefore, they should be guaranteeing the safety of the things that they are saying that I need to put in my body or in my child's body.

01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:12.633
But they're saying that vaccines are safe until proven otherwise.

01:28:13.073 --> 01:28:14.514
That's a totally wrong paradigm.

01:28:14.874 --> 01:28:27.104
And then also from the information that I've seen via the FOIA, whenever they see an adverse event or whenever they see a connection between a vaccine or a vaccine component and an adverse event like autism, then they will work their magic to cover it up.

01:28:27.714 --> 01:28:29.055
Okay.

01:28:29.075 --> 01:28:29.375
They will.

01:28:29.415 --> 01:28:44.127
And I'd like to point out that they have another little ace up their sleeve, if you will, in Orwell's speak, in the opposite speak, to us, to you as a parent, to me as a grandparent, and to the millions of parents out there, the word safe means will not harm.

01:28:44.907 --> 01:28:51.552
But to the vaccine industry, the word safe means the benefits outweigh the risks, and then they won't talk about the risks.

01:28:52.273 --> 01:28:52.613
Right.

01:28:52.733 --> 01:28:54.755
And even from that perspective,

01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:57.950
I would dare say on a population basis that that's really true.

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:01.953
And, and, but really these are not decisions that should be made in a population basis.

01:29:02.033 --> 01:29:04.995
As a parent, you really only care about the population.

01:29:05.015 --> 01:29:06.496
That's really true about the risks.

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:07.396
Right.

01:29:07.456 --> 01:29:12.880
And, and even, even from that perspective, I would dare say on a population basis that that's really true.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:18.824
Oh, so vaccines on a population basis really do work.

01:29:19.664 --> 01:29:23.307
He just said that about the risks.

01:29:24.008 --> 01:29:29.650
Right, and even from that perspective, I would dare say on a population basis that that's really true.

01:29:30.711 --> 01:29:33.632
But really, these are not decisions that should be made on a population basis.

01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:38.694
As a parent, you really only care about the population of your children, and assuring the health and safety of your children.

01:29:39.534 --> 01:29:50.338
Whereas the CDC and the HHS as a whole, going all the way up to Kathleen Sebelius, they are- So wait, is the vaccine and the rationale for vaccinating kids good or not?

01:29:50.398 --> 01:29:51.799
Because if it's not good,

01:29:53.533 --> 01:29:55.995
Then he should be advocating for it to end.

01:29:56.415 --> 01:30:00.819
But now he's saying that on a population basis, it could be good.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.201
Holy shit.

01:30:03.261 --> 01:30:04.522
What's going on here?

01:30:07.184 --> 01:30:18.714
More interested in population dynamics and they look at vaccine adverse events, life changing, life altering, life ending events as acceptable damages and the war on infectious disease.

01:30:19.375 --> 01:30:20.536
And these things aren't known.

01:30:20.656 --> 01:30:37.246
I mean, these people are making decisions, and they're deciding to sacrifice thousands, tens of thousands, I believe, coming up on millions of children in the name of this sort of wrongheaded notion that these infections are going to ravage our population if 90% or so aren't vaccinated.

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:50.429
Well, it kind of flies in the face of the fact that, in my opinion, they are well aware of the fact that over 50% of the population now is affected by vaccine-influenced, if you will, neurological damage.

01:30:50.469 --> 01:30:58.375
Everything from ADHD to a muscle twitch, to asthma, to diabetes, to encephalitis, to the rash of epidemics.

01:30:58.755 --> 01:31:05.079
The epidemic of epidemics, if you will, that we have of juvenile disorders that we've never used to see in juveniles.

01:31:05.119 --> 01:31:07.681
Diabetes, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis.

01:31:09.062 --> 01:31:11.664
We're talking about this in 2013, guys.

01:31:13.945 --> 01:31:15.866
So there's two ways to see Brian Hooker.

01:31:15.947 --> 01:31:20.210
He's been fighting for, I mean, what is it?

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:20.210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.971
Like 12 years?

01:31:21.991 --> 01:31:22.551
13 years?

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:42.720
and he went from sounding pretty good, sorta, kinda, they kinda work on a population basis, but the decision should be every parent's.

01:31:44.381 --> 01:31:48.184
I mean, I don't know what to say.

01:31:48.424 --> 01:31:56.809
One of my son's dated a woman, a very nice lady, a few years ago, a three-year-old kid that while we were in relation with her was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, three years old.

01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:58.630
That's just impossible.

01:32:00.391 --> 01:32:02.612
If anybody had described this type of scenario 20 years ago,

01:32:04.502 --> 01:32:12.807
I'm gonna err on the side of saying that he's probably being overly cautious when he says that, well, on a population basis they seem to work.

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:26.273
Maybe not knowing that actually on a population basis they only seem to work because we take care to not get shit in our mouths, that we take care to wash our hands, that we drink clean water.

01:32:26.313 --> 01:32:32.437
Maybe he's not acutely aware that that shell game was played in the 50s.

01:32:33.357 --> 01:32:48.841
yet it's possible because for the most part he's saying that there's the rationale he just said it the rationale for vaccinating doesn't make sense to him uh most scientists and physicians would have said no way no how that just can't happen so quickly but if you look at how the vaccination schedule has grown

01:32:49.731 --> 01:33:13.849
Since 1986, since essentially the passing of the Childhood Vaccine Safety Act of 1986 and the establishment of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program subsequently in 1988, because of the liability shield, and vaccinations have a liability shield, you cannot sue the manufacturer for design defects because the Supreme Court has ruled that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

01:33:13.889 --> 01:33:15.090
That is directly from the ruling.

01:33:15.552 --> 01:33:18.115
OK, nobody's saying at the Supreme Court that vaccines are safe.

01:33:18.135 --> 01:33:19.617
They're saying that they're unavoidably unsafe.

01:33:19.877 --> 01:33:23.461
And so, therefore, they're using that as impetus to keep you from suing the manufacturers.

01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:29.067
And the manufacturers are having a field day in the pipeline for vaccinations, for new drugs and new vaccines.

01:33:29.768 --> 01:33:34.594
In biotech, it's actually three times greater than the pipeline of development of other biological drugs.

01:33:34.894 --> 01:33:36.376
I mean, they're really taking over the markets.

01:33:36.856 --> 01:33:43.158
because large pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Wyatt, Sanofi Pasteur are making a very, very large amount of profit.

01:33:43.178 --> 01:33:47.239
And you never heard any of those names throughout the entire pandemic, not one of them.

01:33:47.999 --> 01:33:52.040
Profits from childhood vaccines that are now being mandated by law.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.981
And at this point, there's 49 vaccinations that U.S.

01:33:55.021 --> 01:33:56.861
children have to receive by age six.

01:33:57.761 --> 01:34:02.302
And that's opposed to countries like Denmark that has 11, Iceland that has 10.

01:34:03.223 --> 01:34:04.743
Why don't they say that every day?

01:34:06.078 --> 01:34:08.300
Why isn't that the main message of CHD?

01:34:09.041 --> 01:34:11.563
End the criminal vaccine schedule in America.

01:34:11.623 --> 01:34:12.384
It's very simple.

01:34:12.444 --> 01:34:13.665
Compare it to Denmark.

01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:19.151
They're not all dead.

01:34:19.171 --> 01:34:27.619
And we keep on hearing these horrible infectious diseases that are going to ravage our populations.

01:34:28.326 --> 01:34:42.261
population if we don't get all 49 of these vaccines, but yet other countries are existing just fine with and actually are doing much, much better in terms of child mortality, overall child health, and we're watching the health of children decline in the United States as we add more vaccines to the schedule.

01:34:45.277 --> 01:34:49.381
So what, what, how did the, how did the message?

01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:53.664
And by the schedule right now, two-year-olds have received 115 doses of vaccine.

01:34:54.065 --> 01:34:55.446
Hang on, we'll be back after a break.

01:34:55.966 --> 01:35:05.754
How is it possible that in 2013, they were there and in 2025, after a pandemic of five years, we haven't gotten anywhere?

01:35:06.074 --> 01:35:07.115
How is it possible?

01:35:07.395 --> 01:35:11.579
Folks, we're joined by Nancy Novak's, of Nancy Novak's fame, our, our,

01:35:12.409 --> 01:35:13.971
intrepid co-host for most of the last year.

01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:22.819
And so we are now here with Nancy and Sherry Nopkin, homeopath and Brian Hooker, PhD in biochemical engineering specialty in biomedicine.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:36.433
Obviously an experienced and astute researcher who knows what he's talking about when he starts looking at the studies, because that's, that's obviously an astute researcher who knew what transformation and transfection were at the beginning of the pandemic and could have explained it better than me.

01:35:38.124 --> 01:35:44.048
knew what recombinant DNA was and how it's grown, how they use it to transform plants and cell cultures.

01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:46.710
He knew it all.

01:35:47.471 --> 01:35:56.657
And he knew that they were lying and calling transformation and transfection investigational vaccines, and he chose not to do anything about it.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.662
He chose to take a salary,

01:36:05.663 --> 01:36:13.929
to stand in front of Brandy Vaughn and not tell any Americans the truth and he still, still essentially hasn't saved a significant number of kids from any damage.

01:36:17.452 --> 01:36:21.855
Because you're not gonna find really Brian Hooker or Children's Health Defense until after the damage happens.

01:36:25.418 --> 01:36:31.382
That's why I gave my kids their shots while I was working for Children's Health Defense.

01:36:32.343 --> 01:36:34.905
Because their messaging is so shitty

01:36:37.807 --> 01:36:47.482
that you can get a job for him as a staff scientist and as a scientific advisor and get a book published without knowing that the vaccine schedule is criminal and that you shouldn't give your kids any shots.

01:36:47.903 --> 01:36:48.284
Duh.

01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:57.791
his expertise, that's his discipline, is the academic side of it.

01:36:58.172 --> 01:37:00.152
So his words are valuable to us.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:02.573
So let's go on.

01:37:03.154 --> 01:37:05.355
Brian, if you want to talk any more about the malfeasance, that's fine with me.

01:37:05.775 --> 01:37:17.280
I'll point out that, as I said before, I hinted at it saying, well, I think that the overall effect of the vaccines, in essence, is so damaging at this point to such a large percentage of the population that the CDC for a long time

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:25.742
for many years, has had no leg to stand on to use the argument, the philosophy, if you will, that it's safe because it's only a few percentage of the population that are really damaged.

01:37:25.762 --> 01:37:26.803
That's not the case at all.

01:37:27.403 --> 01:37:33.425
And they're the ones that know, because as we've all pointed out so many times, they're the ones who are actively suppressing the information about the damage being done.

01:37:36.001 --> 01:37:36.702
Can I add something?

01:37:37.102 --> 01:37:38.564
I'm a pediatric nurse to begin with.

01:37:38.904 --> 01:37:40.406
I graduated in 1971.

01:37:40.546 --> 01:37:41.747
My mother is a pediatric nurse.

01:37:42.228 --> 01:37:46.372
I worked in my pediatrician's office in high school, and I later was an office manager.

01:37:46.773 --> 01:37:51.458
So I worked in the late 60s and early 70s and 80s in pediatrics.

01:37:52.018 --> 01:37:52.298
Never.

01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:59.282
I had worked in a busy four-person pediatrician office in a big city, and not one autism.

01:37:59.442 --> 01:38:01.303
I never learned about autism in school.

01:38:01.724 --> 01:38:02.964
I never saw autism.

01:38:03.365 --> 01:38:03.925
Never, ever.

01:38:04.305 --> 01:38:06.006
We had one child with asthma.

01:38:06.446 --> 01:38:08.828
We had one child with hemophilia, which is a different story.

01:38:09.088 --> 01:38:11.789
We had a few on Ritalin for ADHD at the time.

01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:14.831
We had lots of ear infections, which are vaccine reactions.

01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:16.731
But we didn't have any of this.

01:38:17.411 --> 01:38:18.412
We didn't have any SIDS.

01:38:18.572 --> 01:38:21.334
I mean, SIDS was common then, and SIDS happens with vaccines.

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:25.876
But to say it's better diagnosis, which is out there everywhere, is ludicrous.

01:38:27.217 --> 01:38:27.577
Definitely.

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:30.859
And there are a couple of things I want to highlight.

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.262
The CDC really has not looked at

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:52.977
that even, you know, even the smallest fraction of vaccines and vaccine components as related to neurological issues, neurological injury in children, the only things that they really looked at were based on public outcry were thimerosal and the MMR vaccine.

01:38:53.659 --> 01:38:59.502
And the CDC has done, since 2000, has done 12 different population-based studies.

01:38:59.942 --> 01:39:01.843
These resulted in 12 peer-reviewed publications.

01:39:01.983 --> 01:39:20.271
It strikes me right now, and I might as well just stop it and say it, that the idea that Wakefield published a paper about autism and vaccines causing it is not any different than them publishing a paper about the proximal origins of the virus.

01:39:21.892 --> 01:39:29.038
and the whole principle of the paper gets you to accept the virus, the whole principle of the paper gets you to accept autism.

01:39:30.939 --> 01:39:33.841
Autism is something that happens to kids.

01:39:34.922 --> 01:39:38.285
It is when this and this and that happens.

01:39:39.425 --> 01:39:42.568
And there could be a cause, and it might be vaccines.

01:39:43.448 --> 01:39:46.571
And Andrew Wakefield got it right or got it wrong.

01:39:46.671 --> 01:39:49.433
Does impeccable science is a complete fraud.

01:39:49.473 --> 01:39:50.274
It doesn't matter.

01:39:51.226 --> 01:40:04.254
The existence of Andrew Wakefield and the question of autism and MMR and his whole role is identical to the proximal origins of SARS-CoV-2.

01:40:05.874 --> 01:40:07.055
It's a Scooby-Doo.

01:40:08.256 --> 01:40:09.897
And the bad guy's autism.

01:40:11.598 --> 01:40:17.061
But what if autism doesn't exist like 2013 Brian Hooker claims it doesn't exist.

01:40:17.121 --> 01:40:18.742
It's just neurological damage.

01:40:20.171 --> 01:40:26.175
due to intramuscular injection of a combination of bullshit and calling it medicine.

01:40:29.337 --> 01:40:38.864
And what if the whole point of Andrew Wakefield is to just establish the idea that autism is real and it's a brain and a gut thing?

01:40:45.808 --> 01:40:46.549
Oh my gosh.

01:40:49.433 --> 01:40:50.914
Oh my gosh, that's it.

01:40:51.334 --> 01:40:52.275
It is really it.

01:40:52.435 --> 01:40:55.717
I'm sorry, but I really think Andrew Wakefield is the same.

01:40:55.857 --> 01:41:02.401
And look, if Andrew Wakefield and Peter Daszak are on the same paper in 1990-whatever,

01:41:05.407 --> 01:41:08.848
How can you not see it anymore as what this is?

01:41:08.988 --> 01:41:17.789
That Andrew Wakefield was put in place to create a narrative that got you to accept the pretenses of that limited spectrum of debate.

01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:30.272
And now we need to do the scholarly work necessary to figure out exactly what those pretenses were and what we were led to accept as we participated in that lively debate.

01:41:31.647 --> 01:41:42.295
just like the proximal origins of SARS-CoV-2 got us to participate in a very lively debate that convinced us that, wow, gain of function might be a reasonable explanation.

01:41:42.795 --> 01:41:44.176
Maybe they are covering it up.

01:41:45.878 --> 01:41:59.248
Maybe autism is caused by vaccines, accepts the existence of autism as a phenomenon that might, for example, have environmental and genetic causes.

01:42:01.141 --> 01:42:04.963
When in reality, maybe 2013 Brian Hooker was right all along.

01:42:05.023 --> 01:42:06.043
It's not autism.

01:42:06.103 --> 01:42:06.963
I don't like that word.

01:42:07.023 --> 01:42:08.164
I don't call it that word.

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:10.745
My son is vaccine damaged.

01:42:11.265 --> 01:42:17.068
It's a neurological insult that he suffered when he got five vaccines in one go.

01:42:18.268 --> 01:42:18.788
Hmm.

01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:22.750
Interesting interpretation of

01:42:24.247 --> 01:42:29.109
our recent history available on the internet that no one else is talking about besides me and Mark.

01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:37.774
Many of them were such poor quality that they were originally rejected by frontline journals, like the Journal of American Medical Association or the New England Journal of Medicine.

01:42:38.094 --> 01:42:50.360
And based on my FOIA efforts, I've been able to show that all 12 are at a minimum flawed, but many of them, I haven't proven that all of them are fraudulent, but the large majority I can show they're actually fraudulent studies.

01:42:51.236 --> 01:42:57.782
In 2010, the CDC came out with what was supposed to be the end-all study on thimerosal and autism.

01:42:59.083 --> 01:43:01.045
Actually, the first author was not from the CDC.

01:43:01.085 --> 01:43:02.866
It was from a research firm the CDC hired.

01:43:03.407 --> 01:43:04.428
His name was Christopher Price.

01:43:04.768 --> 01:43:06.129
He was not a PhD scientist.

01:43:06.209 --> 01:43:07.951
I believe he had his master's in statistics.

01:43:08.451 --> 01:43:16.093
And then the second author was a guy named Frank DeStefano, who was the head of the Vaccine Safety Office at the CDC.

01:43:16.213 --> 01:43:21.015
Another thing to notice with 2013 Brian Hooker is that he names names.

01:43:21.055 --> 01:43:22.455
He's fine with naming names.

01:43:23.035 --> 01:43:25.516
He's not building a big top tent of health freedom here.

01:43:25.556 --> 01:43:27.656
He's telling you who told the lies and when.

01:43:27.676 --> 01:43:28.917
I like that.

01:43:31.232 --> 01:43:42.480
particular study, the statistical phenomenon and statistical errors within that particular study meant that the lion's share of what they presented was fatally flawed.

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:51.566
There was a statistical error called overmatching, where the cases that they were looking at in the controls got virtually the same samarasol concentration, and so you could prove nothing.

01:43:52.106 --> 01:43:56.369
But the one part of the study that was valid was prenatal samarasol exposure.

01:43:56.609 --> 01:44:00.752
Now this is very important because this is the mode of exposure, the primary mode of exposure

01:44:02.253 --> 01:44:09.220
that infants and children are receiving thimerosal is because the flu shot in the United States contains thimerosal.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:15.065
Over 50%, probably more like 70% of the flu shots that are given specifically to pregnant women contain thimerosal.

01:44:15.526 --> 01:44:25.315
And the Price study basically within the text of the study said that there was no effect, there was no reason to forego a thimerosal-containing flu shot because it was not connected to autism, period.

01:44:26.222 --> 01:44:35.071
But even the results that they presented showed that there was an 86% increased risk in autism in those infants that were exposed to this mercury prenatally.

01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:40.756
Now, when I looked at the background report and when I received the information via FOIA, I saw something completely different.

01:44:41.465 --> 01:44:46.686
In essence, the real risk that was associated with the flu vaccine containing thimerosal was 800%.

01:44:48.006 --> 01:44:59.889
Meaning that a child that received or was exposed to thimerosal through a flu vaccine that the mom got while she was pregnant, the child was up to eight times more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than a child.

01:45:00.089 --> 01:45:04.290
Now remember, MMR is what Wakefield talked about.

01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:09.711
MMR is what was featured kind of in Vaxxed.

01:45:10.967 --> 01:45:15.390
Hepatitis, or yeah, HPV shot is what's featured in Vax 2.

01:45:16.931 --> 01:45:22.974
Neither movie is really saying that intramuscular injection is dumb and that it can be any of these things.

01:45:24.415 --> 01:45:29.438
And Brian isn't really there yet as he tries to say that it's the thimerosal.

01:45:29.958 --> 01:45:33.821
It's the thimerosal because it's, that's the mercury part.

01:45:34.676 --> 01:45:37.800
It couldn't also be the recombinant proteins that they put in there.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:48.093
It couldn't also be the preservatives that are in there that aren't tested, like all of the things that Brandy Vaughan listed on her billboards.

01:45:48.674 --> 01:45:51.518
Brandy Vaughan just didn't list aluminum and mercury.

01:45:54.430 --> 01:46:03.136
She never even listed thimerosal because that wasn't really it that's not in very many shots And if you take that out then are the is the shot okay, man.

01:46:03.216 --> 01:46:03.717
Oh, man.

01:46:03.797 --> 01:46:04.858
I'm frustrated here

01:46:05.973 --> 01:46:09.094
I still don't think 2013 Brian Hooker is a bad guy.

01:46:09.114 --> 01:46:26.922
I think 2013 Brian Hooker is trying to tell the truth and what you hear later on is the truncated, titrated, obfuscated version of the truth where you can say that certain parts are dangerous or certain components are dangerous or the adjuvants are dangerous.

01:46:27.409 --> 01:46:31.031
And you know, Bobby Kennedy's gonna get to the adjuvants eventually.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:34.713
You can see that iPhone video of Mark if you need some comedy.

01:46:35.674 --> 01:46:37.615
Did not, was not exposed to thimerosal.

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:38.896
CDC covered this up.

01:46:39.556 --> 01:46:41.117
There's no statistical basis for what they did.

01:46:41.157 --> 01:46:42.738
They just didn't like the data, so they didn't report it.

01:46:43.098 --> 01:46:43.598
And that is fraud.

01:46:43.618 --> 01:46:45.199
I mean, it's pure and simple fraud.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.220
Indeed is, and it's an outreach.

01:46:47.661 --> 01:46:49.722
Yes, and there are, you know, I could go on.

01:46:52.428 --> 01:47:19.006
uh... for days and days and days and fortunately it's very horrifying information by the foyer uh... it was used in congress are helping me get this information and get lots of information through them i get it through i get it leaked through sources that will call me up and say i can't release my name but i want you to have this information uh... but uh... you know they're even insiders in the cdc we will hope that somebody will come forward as a whistleblower at some point uh... but uh... but uh... you know the there are insiders that want this information out uh... same thing with an mmr uh... you know the

01:47:19.423 --> 01:47:40.150
The CDC did an NMR study in 2004, and if you read the study, it shows that in some cases, boys that got the NMR on time versus boys that got the NMR after three years were 250 more times, or percent, 250% more likely to receive a diagnosis of autism than those where the parents delayed.

01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:43.191
And the CDC didn't even look at the portion that didn't get NMR.

01:47:44.604 --> 01:47:56.307
What I find important about this is that in 2013, Brian already knows that if he would just be able to delay the schedule, he could save a lot of kids from this severe injury.

01:47:57.107 --> 01:48:04.769
And so in a lot of ways, you can see where somebody like Paul Thomas has an argument that, you know, it's better to delay

01:48:05.785 --> 01:48:10.326
how long it is the first time your kid gets hit in the head with a baseball bat.

01:48:10.386 --> 01:48:15.968
And if you can delay that until three years old, that would be really good for your kid's overall future.

01:48:16.828 --> 01:48:17.588
That makes sense.

01:48:18.348 --> 01:48:19.729
Totally makes sense to me.

01:48:21.489 --> 01:48:29.311
The point is though, if you know that hitting a kid with a baseball bat is always bad, then why don't you just say that?

01:48:32.867 --> 01:48:50.078
In fact, as a sophisticated biologist, you should be able to use the evidence that the later you hit a kid with a baseball bat, the less damage it can potentially do for the remainder of his life to make the argument that hitting a kid with a baseball bat is bad at any age.

01:48:52.179 --> 01:49:00.925
Because that's what you would expect to anything that could throw off the pattern integrity and the development of that pattern integrity across time

01:49:01.874 --> 01:49:04.757
It would have to be a pretty malevolent insult.

01:49:06.719 --> 01:49:16.129
In fact, I would argue that a baseball bat has less likelihood of changing that trajectory across time than an intramuscular injection does.

01:49:18.471 --> 01:49:20.273
Think about them apples for a second.

01:49:23.357 --> 01:49:23.737
That's funny.

01:49:24.352 --> 01:49:25.613
OK, yeah, but that's across the board.

01:49:25.653 --> 01:49:27.915
They consistently in essence.

01:49:27.975 --> 01:49:28.936
It's a. It's a here.

01:49:28.996 --> 01:49:31.218
No unvaccinated information.

01:49:31.258 --> 01:49:32.559
See no unvaccinated information.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.461
Speak no unvaccinated information, right?

01:49:34.862 --> 01:49:38.965
Right, yeah, it's it's so ridiculously obvious.

01:49:39.886 --> 01:49:42.028
And go ahead, I'm sorry.

01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:48.818
And yet it's no unvaccinated information, see no unvaccinated information, speak no unvaccinated information.

01:49:49.319 --> 01:49:58.310
There's the point that Polly made in 2019, probably because of the influence of Brandy Vaughn, that actually the real message is that unvaccinated kids are fine.

01:49:59.218 --> 01:50:02.980
In fact, they're higher functioning than most fully vaccinated children.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.201
They have far less health problems.

01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:12.144
And that message doesn't mean that we should delay the vaccine schedule or that we should advocate for free choice.

01:50:12.644 --> 01:50:20.167
It means that if you want to protect the grandkids of America, you should advocate for the ending of the US vaccine schedule.

01:50:23.658 --> 01:50:40.846
And I think that they should have been there already in 2013, if they could have been on the radio talking this much shit, then by 2015, when they met Brandy Vaughn, they should have been given high fives and saying, damn right, baby, let's get this on every billboard in every state in America, and let's end the vaccine schedule by 2016.

01:50:44.668 --> 01:50:51.011
Because that would have been four years of collaboration on this problem.

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.401
And that's not what happened, guys.

01:50:55.002 --> 01:50:56.264
That's not what happened at all.

01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.930
Right, right.

01:51:01.291 --> 01:51:04.815
Yeah, it's so ridiculously obvious.

01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.951
Go ahead, John, I'm sorry.

01:51:08.431 --> 01:51:11.373
And yet, I mean, it's surreal, you know?

01:51:11.753 --> 01:51:26.824
The American public, those who are interested, and watching, for instance, the recent congressional hearings, about which I'd like to speak in a little while, can sit there and, like some of the folks in the gallery behind the two CDC doctors, sit there and shake their head at the answers being given out.

01:51:28.225 --> 01:51:29.587
I'm going to pause this here.

01:51:30.087 --> 01:51:41.621
I'm going to show you that actually I do have loaded up the other video, the Union of the Unwanted, which was in December of 2020, just after Brandy Vaughn died.

01:51:45.706 --> 01:51:56.155
There is a stream where Brian Hooker holds court and Mark already did a nice stream about this and pushed some of the highlights that I think are very stunning.

01:51:57.116 --> 01:52:01.861
But I do think that this video is probably worth a full study hall and so tomorrow I'm going to do that.

01:52:02.581 --> 01:52:07.924
I might finish that video behind this one up first and then start with this one.

01:52:09.485 --> 01:52:11.366
I assure you we have a lot of work to do.

01:52:11.386 --> 01:52:18.611
Team Worst Case Scenario doesn't seem to be going away and that's because I think they still have a control over the...

01:52:18.851 --> 01:52:23.096
The social media messaging, that's why they're still inserting new players.

01:52:23.856 --> 01:52:29.282
That's why they're still using people in the UK to help insert these new players.

01:52:29.362 --> 01:52:32.726
It's an illusion of consensus that spans the globe.

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:39.113
It's a little weird populist movement and nobody is in this narrative by chance, except for me and Mark.

01:52:41.068 --> 01:52:42.429
We're not in the narrative though, right?

01:52:42.449 --> 01:52:49.633
We have a timeline where everybody meets us and ignores us, obfuscates our work or never even mentions it.

01:52:49.753 --> 01:52:51.914
And even after I'm in the book, it doesn't matter.

01:52:51.975 --> 01:52:54.276
They still write virology reviews without me.

01:52:55.637 --> 01:53:00.920
And it's all the same people, ladies and gentlemen, promoting each other in a fake theater.

01:53:02.185 --> 01:53:03.426
It's a fake resistance.

01:53:03.486 --> 01:53:05.446
These are all traitors to our grandkids.

01:53:05.486 --> 01:53:07.327
I have no doubt about it in my mind.

01:53:07.827 --> 01:53:14.570
And the ones that are unwitting need to feel the pressure so that they realize how they've been fooled, how they've been used.

01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:16.971
Bret Weinstein doesn't need to be pressured.

01:53:17.011 --> 01:53:20.292
He knows exactly how he's been used and he's happy to be used that way.

01:53:20.332 --> 01:53:26.775
He hopes that at some point the elite will thank him and his family's contribution to our enslavement.

01:53:27.555 --> 01:53:38.025
I think that you can find out who any of these people are that are currently in front of us rising stars of the new social media by simply looking at what they were clowning with in 2020.

01:53:38.445 --> 01:53:48.435
And everybody from Julian Michaels to Chris Martinson can be seen plainly for who they were and what they were doing when they did it.

01:53:49.445 --> 01:53:52.127
It's not happy little accidents, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:52.228 --> 01:53:53.088
It's malevolence.

01:53:53.849 --> 01:53:57.953
It's not happy little accidents that these people are being paid by these nonprofits.

01:53:58.553 --> 01:54:00.896
It is not happy little accidents.

01:54:00.996 --> 01:54:02.697
It is malevolence and traitors.

01:54:03.998 --> 01:54:11.886
It's not an accident that this guy has been following me around for five years, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project.

01:54:14.528 --> 01:54:15.249
This is real.

01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:22.916
The lies that they tell are real evidence of the malevolence.

01:54:22.996 --> 01:54:27.922
They are real evidence of what's going on and how bad it is off script.

01:54:29.043 --> 01:54:30.425
I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:30.465 --> 01:54:33.389
was supposed to be more than Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:54:35.106 --> 01:54:54.908
I think they hoped that they would get other people in positions of power, although I'm still convinced that Marty McCarty and Jay Bhattacharya are already vetted and going to be going to be playing along because they already must know that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal and they must know that we must be governed in order for this to be sustained.

01:54:55.657 --> 01:54:57.480
They have to run out the clock, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:03.067
The vaccine schedule will eventually be admitted to be faulty, not perfect.

01:55:03.808 --> 01:55:07.974
And the COVID vaccine will also be admitted to be not perfect.

01:55:08.054 --> 01:55:12.360
But the next generation of this molecular medicine will be personalized.

01:55:13.081 --> 01:55:18.668
and they will use the murder and lies listed here to make that transformation possible.

01:55:18.728 --> 01:55:26.918
These people use that list of murder and lies to make the transformation possible by enacting a dinner theater about a mystery virus.

01:55:28.015 --> 01:55:38.744
That's why none of these organizations will ever explain to you the significance of Brandy Vaughn's simple idea of comparing ingestion to injection of a pharmaceutical.

01:55:39.144 --> 01:55:50.253
They will never enunciate the gigaohm biological language of that nature, intramuscular injection is dumb, and challenge their doctor members to correct that.

01:55:52.295 --> 01:55:53.976
That's because they all know we're right.

01:55:56.078 --> 01:55:57.039
They all know the truth.

01:55:57.622 --> 01:56:02.806
They never imagined that we would be able to so succinctly describe it.

01:56:02.906 --> 01:56:26.023
They never imagined that we would rediscover Brandy Vaughn, and they never imagined that somebody with my track record and history in biology would ever come to the conclusion that there is no safe vaccine, that intramuscular injection of medicine is a lie, and risk his family's well-being to try and spread this message, just like Brandy did.

01:56:28.339 --> 01:56:32.762
putting it all on the line to spread this one message and risk it all.

01:56:33.303 --> 01:56:43.190
Because if this is the truth, and I'll say if, if this is the truth, then what else is there to argue about?

01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:44.511
What else is there to fight for?

01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:47.353
You're gonna argue for seatbelts?

01:56:47.953 --> 01:56:51.276
You're gonna fight for getting the bad dyes out of Froot Loops?

01:56:56.937 --> 01:57:05.479
If you're going to fight for something, maybe you should fight for getting Narcan in every single ambulance in the United States.

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:17.082
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what to say other than you can find out if these people are meddlers just like I'm finding out by looking at their track record that's still freely available on the internet.

01:57:17.682 --> 01:57:20.923
You can find out what these people weren't doing when they should have done it.

01:57:23.143 --> 01:57:24.764
And you can tell your grandkids the truth.

01:57:24.964 --> 01:57:26.204
You can make sure that they get it.

01:57:26.952 --> 01:57:32.418
One of the ways to make sure that they get it is to make sure that a story about these people is published.

01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:35.622
And Giga Home Biological is working on that right now.

01:57:35.682 --> 01:57:37.464
It's going to be one of the books that we put out.

01:57:38.786 --> 01:57:40.267
I don't have a book contract.

01:57:40.407 --> 01:57:41.348
I don't have a book written.

01:57:42.409 --> 01:58:01.619
I've got lots of notes and lots of outlines about what these people have done and I'm trying to integrate it into a story that makes sense so that I can pass down something to my kids that they can hand out and help to spread the word of how the United States was essentially ruined by a bunch of traitors when the truth was available.

01:58:02.439 --> 01:58:04.761
They chose to ignore it for the slavers.

01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:22.995
I'm not really sure how to describe what happened if Brett, I mean, sorry, if Brian Hooker was there in 2013 and we're now in 2025 and he still can't say that intramuscular injection is dumb, except to say that this must be a national security exercise.

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:30.001
That the vaccine schedule in America and its future use

01:58:32.285 --> 01:58:49.640
as a central part of the pivot to personalized medicine and the collection of all the medical and genetic data of American citizens, that this is a national security exercise that these people were recruited into.

01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:59.849
I don't know when Brian Hooker was recruited in, but my guess is, is if you check his language over time, you will see an abrupt change when he was recruited.

01:59:01.266 --> 01:59:07.709
Maybe it was 2018 when the World Mercury Project changed its name to Children's Health Defense.

01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:11.271
Maybe it was before that.

01:59:11.391 --> 01:59:11.791
I don't know.

01:59:13.132 --> 01:59:24.137
But I know that right now Brian Hooker is not working for us because there's no way to explain how a guy with all that molecular experience

01:59:25.746 --> 01:59:45.413
relevant biotechnological experience with recombinant genetics that includes transformation and transfection in 2013 could be where we just heard him and then in 2025 be unable to say anything other than rise and resist people over profits truth over lies and courage over fear.

01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:54.150
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but there's only one conclusion to come to.

01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:55.591
Brian Hooker is a fraud.

01:59:56.731 --> 02:00:01.713
Brian Hooker is a traitor to our grandchildren, and at some point he sold out like Mary Holland did.

02:00:03.914 --> 02:00:06.054
Otherwise that video wouldn't exist.

02:00:07.195 --> 02:00:18.639
And the videos with him and Mary Holland and Kevin McKernan at the end of 24 wouldn't exist, or 23 wouldn't exist, and be part of the portfolio of reasons why I was fired from CHD.

02:00:19.713 --> 02:00:22.294
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR is a diagnostic, is a fraud.

02:00:22.334 --> 02:00:27.976
The only thing they have is synthetic recombinant genetics that they've used to make protein biologics for decades.

02:00:28.497 --> 02:00:32.178
They can make a large quantity of pure DNA and they could put it places.

02:00:32.218 --> 02:00:35.620
They could even call that virology if they wanted to, but it wouldn't make it real.

02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:45.784
But I assure you that with an agent in Wuhan and a little collaboration, they could find anything they wanted to find at high fidelity and even trick other people into thinking that they found it.

02:00:49.318 --> 02:00:53.580
Transfection is a crime, ladies and gentlemen, and the way that they got away with it is placebo.

02:00:54.260 --> 02:01:00.243
It may be the way that they're getting away with the vaccine schedule in America as it stands that many of them are placebo.

02:01:00.283 --> 02:01:07.846
Maybe they even told that to Brian when they finally ran him in on the national security operation that he seems to be a part of.

02:01:07.966 --> 02:01:11.828
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but endemicity is a myth.

02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:19.544
and a foundational myth of RNA virology that can be dispelled with three words, RNA cannot pandemic, that's bullshit.

02:01:20.604 --> 02:01:27.967
There is a hot background upon which non-specific PCR tests could be applied, and that's the end of the mythology.

02:01:30.348 --> 02:01:39.152
RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injection is dumb, transfectioning healthy humans was always a crime, and the population pyramids is a problem needing menu.

02:01:40.015 --> 02:01:40.575
Managing.

02:01:40.635 --> 02:01:41.776
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:01:41.796 --> 02:01:42.716
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:01:42.736 --> 02:01:50.819
We got lots of work to do, ladies and gentlemen.

02:01:50.839 --> 02:02:01.003
Tomorrow's gonna be a big stream because I have a feeling there's gonna be an incredible amount of bullshit in that 2020 video with Brian Hooker on the ripple effect.

02:02:04.664 --> 02:02:06.525
I'm gonna get this butter out of my jacket.

02:02:08.206 --> 02:02:08.426
See ya.

02:02:38.046 --> 02:02:40.305
that is much more likely it's a lab leak.
