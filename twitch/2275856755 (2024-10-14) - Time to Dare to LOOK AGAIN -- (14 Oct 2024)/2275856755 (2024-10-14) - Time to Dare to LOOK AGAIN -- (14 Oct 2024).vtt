WEBVTT

00:20.932 --> 00:22.913
You're welcome.

00:55.724 --> 00:56.045
you

01:13.826 --> 01:15.707
vaccine, if you think about it.

01:15.727 --> 01:20.691
You know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:21.111 --> 01:24.174
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:24.234 --> 01:33.701
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:33.721 --> 01:40.306
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:56.573 --> 01:56.854
Yeah.

02:56.115 --> 02:58.947
In retrospect, iMovie is so weak.

02:59.268 --> 03:01.497
I mean, it's so, oh man.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.201
Man, I also had spiked tires on 365 days every year.

03:14.341 --> 03:17.902
So like, I don't wipe out even on oil with those suckers.

03:18.082 --> 03:22.743
Paint, none of that stuff bothered me because I had spiked tires.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.783
Like I'm not the pig deck, as they say in Norwegian.

03:27.864 --> 03:28.944
I wasn't fooling around.

03:29.044 --> 03:31.524
I wiped out a couple of times and broke my wrist once.

03:31.644 --> 03:35.065
And after that, I never took them off my bike again, even in the summer.

03:52.950 --> 03:55.352
Post that link at the soapbox, too.

03:55.392 --> 03:56.633
I'll see if I can check it out.

03:56.733 --> 03:57.093
Yikes.

03:57.293 --> 03:57.734
Whatever.

03:57.914 --> 03:59.755
Another viral disease in horses.

03:59.835 --> 04:02.697
I'm sure that Robert Malone will rescue us from this one, too.

04:02.877 --> 04:05.960
At least he'll ride in and let us know why his horses are immune.

04:36.305 --> 04:36.365
Mm.

05:46.584 --> 05:47.205
Yeah.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.965
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

09:07.025 --> 09:11.748
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.869
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.310
It's embarrassing.

09:35.515 --> 09:37.175
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

09:38.456 --> 09:39.596
Welcome to the Hamster Wheel.

09:40.851 --> 09:55.806
We are still there, of course, still unable to shed social media entirely, and so our consciousness is still largely occupied by the illusions that they have cast on us, the enchantments that they have cast over the last five years.

09:56.707 --> 10:11.365
And so we are still fighting those illusions that were planted in our children's minds and our own minds by these elaborate computer animations and these charlatans which have agreed to lie to us, to bamboozle us.

10:11.425 --> 10:14.749
And the way that they bamboozle us is very complicated.

10:15.290 --> 10:29.017
because they each have different pieces of the puzzle and those pieces fit intricately together so that as you assemble them, no matter which pieces you put together, they all assemble into the same story, the same mystery has been solved.

10:29.458 --> 10:35.521
And what's at the end of that is a biological mythology that can enslave our grandchildren.

10:36.061 --> 10:43.508
If you want to get out, you need to understand why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

10:44.008 --> 10:47.912
You need to understand why transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

10:48.332 --> 10:53.116
And you need to understand why RNA cannot pandemic, and that's because viruses aren't pattern integrities.

10:54.698 --> 10:57.661
There was no mystery virus which caused excess deaths.

10:57.701 --> 11:13.375
These excess deaths were expected and in fact a large inconvenience for the most of Western world and so they needed a long list of ways that they could disguise the murder and lies because there would never be any epidemiological evidence of spread.

11:14.216 --> 11:26.981
And so that's why we don't have lawyers usefully fighting these legislative traps that we're in that allow these people to think that they have blanket immunity to do whatever they want and to roll out whatever they want.

11:27.021 --> 11:37.506
Because again, this is all part of the same illusion that's hiding these murder and lies, these expected deaths that have been misconstrued as a novel virus.

11:37.786 --> 11:39.727
And it's in order to prevent us

11:40.427 --> 11:48.492
essentially prevent us what was from already happening before the pandemic where people were starting to realize that the vaccine schedule might be a little bit goofy.

11:48.832 --> 11:56.937
They were starting to realize that transfection was never really going to go anywhere and there was no way that we were going to be able to get

11:57.717 --> 12:10.824
that we were going to be able to get anybody to accept it as a medical thing because it was never going to pass what even the FDA would consider a safety test.

12:11.345 --> 12:16.988
And so they also really needed to conceal the fact that RNA can't do this.

12:17.928 --> 12:39.385
um and so the only way to this this is why it was so convenient for all of these these people to be retiring and getting old and and and becoming frail and being unhealthy that's why it has been okay for the last 20 years in america in particular not anywhere else in particular around the world but particularly in america

12:40.066 --> 12:50.569
for the food industry to go absolutely south and for the medical industry to absolutely become a profit-oriented machine.

12:51.189 --> 12:57.651
Because there was this gigantic problem with prosperity and it needed to be stopped.

12:58.331 --> 13:04.193
And so for the last 30 years they have been reducing the family size in America and encouraging us

13:05.253 --> 13:07.335
to believe in ghosts.

13:07.415 --> 13:13.440
Ghosts that are based on biology about RNA that just cannot be true.

13:14.560 --> 13:24.348
And I was a victim of this illusion as well because I had been taught by people who had been taught by people who had learned biology 101 based on genes.

13:25.008 --> 13:28.230
Biology 101 based on genes is the trap

13:29.291 --> 13:32.713
Um, and Mendel is part of that illusion.

13:32.733 --> 13:52.665
Um, and this totalitarianism they want to trap us in really, really requires at its foundation, this, this mythology about how genes and their determinism in, in our destiny, um, as a species, but also as individuals, um, ultimately governs who we are.

13:52.685 --> 13:58.009
Uh, and that's terrifying because we're, they're very close to closing the trap right now.

13:58.689 --> 14:02.510
They're very close to getting a lot of young people to believe this.

14:03.471 --> 14:21.877
And I think that there can be no doubt that social media is a weaponized governance mechanism that requires the active participation of highly trained acolytes that keep us busy on the internet and make sure that useful ideas and useful patriots

14:24.096 --> 14:30.011
do not assemble, but that faux groups assemble.

14:31.707 --> 14:54.307
false groups of people assembled to save us and these weaponized piles of money have almost unlimited resources especially if we acquiesce to social media use to convince us about what to argue and with whom to argue they have almost unlimited access to our attention and they have unlimited resources therefore participating in an argument with them is almost

14:56.129 --> 15:01.512
impossible not for it to result in us accepting the premise of the narrative.

15:02.032 --> 15:06.935
That's what happened on Twitter in 2020 and 2021, like it or not.

15:07.395 --> 15:14.739
We are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms, includes all sides of their mythologies.

15:14.779 --> 15:20.802
And I've really come to see Twitter or X as central to this illusion, at least in their game.

15:21.682 --> 15:44.737
I don't think they managed to pull off what they wanted to pull off yet, but I do think that in their designed script, X was gonna be censorship, but truth, and censorship, but the truth was there, and then Elon was supposed to come and buy it, and then the people that were telling the quote-unquote truth

15:45.297 --> 15:47.119
before he bought it would be promoted.

15:47.559 --> 15:49.881
And so this was a multi-step game.

15:50.442 --> 15:54.726
Like The Sting, if you've never seen that movie, these people have been performing a narrative.

15:56.547 --> 16:03.754
And I, as an academic biologist, was very vulnerable to their narrative because they spent a lot of time on me.

16:03.854 --> 16:10.080
They sent a lot of different people to talk to me, to join with me on Twitter groups,

16:11.701 --> 16:27.770
calling me on the phone, putting me in signal chats, and it's all because I had a kind of a legitimate background in biology, a long track record of trying to get tenure, and that's in fact where Gigaohm Biological derives its name.

16:30.172 --> 16:32.814
And so there was a problem when I was speaking up.

16:32.874 --> 16:46.346
And I think that the best thing, the reason why I played that cartoon or that intro in the beginning with JC on a bike is for you to see how absolutely vulnerable and naive I was at that point.

16:46.366 --> 16:49.889
I was riding on my bicycle.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.030
Sorry, I'm just going to pop in here on the bottom.

16:53.112 --> 17:16.062
I was riding on my bicycle and editing movies at night, trying to impress the faculty with what I thought would be like something that no other faculty member had, a YouTube channel and a useful one and an interesting one and one that contributed to, could contribute to the courses that he was teaching.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.423
And so I was just getting started.

17:20.151 --> 17:30.758
And so that was me doing my best to like brown nose basically to try and stand out amongst a crowd of people who all wanted that kind of attention.

17:30.818 --> 17:47.849
And so in retrospect, when I look back on it and I see that trailer or I see some of those videos, I can really see who I was and I can see what my mindset was and I could see how positive I was that that was what I was supposed to be doing.

17:49.471 --> 17:51.892
and that everything was on the right track.

17:51.932 --> 18:01.015
I mean, I'd just gotten all this free equipment from a company in Germany that I had bought from for years and made friends with a lot of the guys there.

18:01.055 --> 18:09.359
And so I was sitting on a room full of stuff that nobody at the University of Pittsburgh could have ever gotten by themselves by sending a couple emails.

18:10.779 --> 18:15.601
But I got a pretty amazing company in Germany to send me their state-of-the-art

18:18.123 --> 18:19.684
Because I said, hey, I need some help.

18:19.744 --> 18:20.725
I'm trying to get tenure.

18:20.765 --> 18:22.186
I'm barely hanging on here.

18:22.826 --> 18:23.987
I'm doing everything I can.

18:24.047 --> 18:25.408
Hey, check out my YouTube channel.

18:25.468 --> 18:28.329
And by the way, I could really use another rig here and I don't have one.

18:28.510 --> 18:29.770
And he sent stuff.

18:31.311 --> 18:35.194
And so at the beginning of the pandemic, I was sitting in a position where I was

18:36.448 --> 18:50.758
You know, like that guy on, you saw the, sure, everybody saw it, the guy in the sailboat who's told everybody on the news that he was just, you know, this is all he's got, all of his stuff is in this boat, so he's not evacuating, he's just gonna wait out the storm.

18:50.818 --> 18:53.099
I mean, I was all in.

18:53.119 --> 19:04.347
I had dragged my family around the world, I had raised my kids in, we had kids in Norway and then in the Netherlands, and then we dragged them all the way to Pittsburgh because we were all in on my career.

19:05.452 --> 19:14.294
We could have stayed in the Netherlands and I could have got some other job, probably at a teaching, at a English speaking high school or something like that.

19:14.894 --> 19:20.095
I could have easily tried to stay in the Netherlands if that was the number one priority.

19:20.135 --> 19:27.736
But when you look back on it, our number one priority as a family was to move back to the Netherlands and do my job.

19:28.276 --> 19:32.977
And when my job in the Netherlands didn't work out, we bailed on the Netherlands in a month in my mind.

19:33.797 --> 19:38.863
I don't think my wife has ever bailed on the Netherlands and her family's beautiful and huge and happy.

19:40.145 --> 19:45.992
But when I look back and I see that video, I'm not proud of it.

19:46.652 --> 19:52.880
I cringe and I recall a very, very difficult time for my family.

19:53.953 --> 20:02.221
because we were living on a shoestring budget, renting our house in a city that we didn't really know why we came to, but it was okay and it was nice.

20:02.742 --> 20:06.586
And then Trump got elected within months and the whole place lost their mind.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.888
And then they were burning cities down.

20:08.928 --> 20:09.669
It was nuts.

20:11.738 --> 20:19.723
And as I told Mark yesterday in the chat, we had some didn't even understand how somebody's parents died in the first six days we were here.

20:19.763 --> 20:28.970
And in fact, you will recall there was also, you can look it up in the Pittsburgh, but the same year that we were here, there was also a guy in the end of our street.

20:29.870 --> 20:50.181
in that part of Pittsburgh that had a whole house full of guns and got them emptied and they had like they had like army vehicles coming down there to to because it was a standoff they had some kind of robot and stuff that was also on the news in the first year that I was back in in America so we we really had a crazy year that

20:51.710 --> 21:00.659
We all just, my whole family went through because I was going to be a tenured academic biologist or we were going to crash.

21:03.362 --> 21:09.348
And this pandemic thing could have ruined my life.

21:09.468 --> 21:09.808
It really

21:10.822 --> 21:23.729
if it wasn't for my wife believing in me and trusting in me and never doubting me for a second, this could have destroyed our family in a heartbeat, all the things that we went through.

21:23.789 --> 21:27.771
It destroyed the relationship I have with my brother up until now.

21:27.891 --> 21:29.972
That's why it's called Silent Rob.

21:30.413 --> 21:34.335
Originally, it was a hat tip for the fact that he helped me out with a

21:34.975 --> 21:47.807
with uh extra money when we were moving to my trying to put a security deposit down on our house but like now it's silent rob because he doesn't talk to me anymore

21:49.232 --> 21:51.714
And so my life is not great.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.375
I'm not having a good time here.

21:53.475 --> 22:06.625
But what I do know is that my experience getting here has put me in a unique position to kind of have a good idea of how bad it is and how many of these people are likely not working with us.

22:06.845 --> 22:12.189
Because I was part of what needed to be controlled.

22:13.590 --> 22:14.911
And I didn't know it at the time.

22:16.033 --> 22:25.398
I only maybe know it now, but the farther we get back in this storyline, the easier it is for me to see how manipulated I was.

22:25.498 --> 22:31.761
And so I'm going to look at a video that's actually stored here in the Batcave.

22:32.719 --> 22:42.343
And I'm also going to look at a video that's stored at GigaOMBiological.com in the archive list, which is also on Vimeo.

22:43.503 --> 22:49.866
And the reason why I'm going to do that is because I think it's time that we really, you know,

22:51.314 --> 22:53.397
I've gotta, I gotta fix this.

22:53.557 --> 22:57.342
I gotta open this wound or I gotta heal this wound or whatever the wound is.

22:57.482 --> 22:58.544
I don't know what the right word is.

22:58.564 --> 22:59.986
I gotta peel the band-aid off.

23:00.066 --> 23:08.156
I gotta, there's definitely going to be something in this video that's gonna be painful for me to see.

23:10.660 --> 23:14.143
There's definitely going to be something in this video that's painful for me to see.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.886
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

23:16.946 --> 23:21.630
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

23:21.670 --> 23:24.593
I'm coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

23:25.694 --> 23:26.694
Yes, it is October.

23:29.151 --> 23:32.193
2024 and I am shocked.

23:32.933 --> 23:43.740
I have to be very honest with you that we're still here But I am also very happy here to be here with you and have the kind of optimism that I have because The doors haven't closed yet.

23:43.960 --> 23:52.345
I don't have a chip in my hand yet My kids aren't chipped yet The internet is still on and I

23:53.345 --> 23:56.088
You know, it's not snowing outside, so I don't know.

23:56.149 --> 23:59.332
I have limited things to complain about and I don't want to complain.

24:18.622 --> 24:20.842
Just making sure everybody hears it, right?

24:20.862 --> 24:23.203
This is who I am.

24:23.283 --> 24:32.305
I'm a guy who was on the internet, and particularly I was on Twitter in the beginning in a group called Drastic, thinking that I was fighting against the Empire.

24:33.145 --> 24:44.727
And what I did was I kind of met all these people in blue as I was fighting the Empire, and I thought that they were helping me, or more importantly, I thought I was joining their team and helping them.

24:45.867 --> 24:50.792
And in reality, these people were a part of these people's same, it's the same illusion.

24:51.512 --> 25:01.360
Whether you fight on the Rebel Alliance team or whether you fight or you believe in the Empire's okay, you are sitting in this chair and playing a Star Wars game.

25:01.381 --> 25:03.322
You're not really escaping.

25:03.662 --> 25:06.024
And that was a trick that I didn't understand.

25:07.326 --> 25:13.291
And it wasn't until I started talking about this stuff in 2021 that the heat really got turned up on me.

25:14.511 --> 25:21.595
And actually, when I was talking about population pyramids was when I started to meet people like Kevin McKernan.

25:21.695 --> 25:32.120
So, weaponized piles of money have known for a long time already that there was going to be an increase in all-cause mortality to be expected by the large families after World War II.

25:32.580 --> 25:35.882
And a lot of these countries would have been potentially budgetarily vulnerable

25:38.263 --> 25:39.684
to a bit of a problem here.

25:40.144 --> 25:52.790
And so I think that that's that easily and most parsimoniously explains why countries as diverse as China and the UK and the Netherlands and France and America would all more or less cooperate in lockstep.

25:54.150 --> 26:02.876
in order to orchestrate a theater that would take advantage of this known increase in all-cause mortality, never let a good opportunity go to waste.

26:03.436 --> 26:10.460
And if this is a biological phenomenon that can't be avoided, then what better thing to use it for than to convince you that they saved you from something.

26:11.020 --> 26:12.101
And so that's what they did.

26:12.161 --> 26:15.403
They took advantage of this opportunity to stage the plandemic.

26:16.792 --> 26:22.976
And so how they did it, of course, is they used this whole list of potential ways to murder people.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.276
They didn't use all the list.

26:24.837 --> 26:31.701
Holy cow, it should be like, it should sound like this then if I'm gonna be so big and small.

26:32.821 --> 26:39.205
The list that they use is varied and different across countries, depending on what protocols were previously in place.

26:39.245 --> 26:45.008
For example, in the UK, where they were already more or less euthanizing people before the pandemic,

26:46.429 --> 27:09.566
They had a whole series of protocols that were more or less acceptable even to the people that were working there Whereas in America it required a little more subterfuge and a few key doctors being visible by a lot of people so that an illusion of consensus about falling oxygen levels and an illusion of consensus about the relevance of using you know, if you got nothing else you could give them pure oxygen and

27:10.226 --> 27:35.273
And the purposeful ignorance of the ideas that were already around for a couple decades that pure oxygen isn't really that good for you, especially dry, cold, pure oxygen, which is often what is coming out of these full mouth masks that are hooked directly to a tank where Kyle Seidel would often put it up to 60 liters a minute to try and drive these people's pulse ox back to 99.99% where it should be.

27:39.750 --> 27:50.743
And so yeah, you know, they've also in America, we've had this wonderful additional source of all cause mortality, the opioid crisis, and all of these people have been very, very

27:53.112 --> 28:04.542
united in their inability to figure this in and subtract it from the total number of deaths, which if you think about it, would be just another way to argue that they screwed up a response.

28:04.602 --> 28:08.546
It could be just another way to argue that the response was exaggerated.

28:08.586 --> 28:13.310
It could be just another way to expose Tony Fauci and the bad, oh, wait.

28:16.823 --> 28:17.923
So you see how it works.

28:18.924 --> 28:41.890
Once you see that all the cards aren't played, once you see that these people have been holding trump cards for a long time, like the fact that you can't be a guy with 20 years of experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing and not know that the pharmaceutical companies in order to make biologics are making, you know, grams of DNA and grams of RNA already.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.571
You can't not know that.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.507
That's how all biologics are made.

28:47.168 --> 28:53.809
And so it's strange, right, that everybody who's been in this space now for five years still hasn't gotten to the point where they can say that.

28:54.690 --> 29:02.252
It's not like they had to make a bunch of new stuff or they actually could cut a bunch of steps off of what they were already doing.

29:02.672 --> 29:08.653
They try to make you think that they had to make all these new manufacturing facilities, they had to build all these new vats.

29:09.553 --> 29:10.494
Come on.

29:14.022 --> 29:15.423
They got you on that one.

29:16.284 --> 29:33.016
Any company that could make biologics like antibodies or anything protein-derived, it was inevitably starting with a synthetic DNA construct, which is also the starting point, lo and behold, for virology most of the time, especially the really good papers.

29:34.232 --> 29:56.795
And so in 2020, they needed to have clever people or maybe not so clever people get seated, maybe egoistic people get seated with little bits of the narrative that in any mismatch assembly would lead that naive person to think that, wow, I'm putting pieces of this puzzle together and starting to understand how

29:57.375 --> 29:59.416
how malevolent this web really is.

29:59.497 --> 30:05.261
And the inevitable conclusion here is that they're covering something up and the mystery is solved when you think it's a lab leak.

30:06.181 --> 30:18.009
And this was all cleverly designed by the people who wanted transfection to be accepted as a medicine, accepted as a countermeasure, accepted as a general methodology that in general worked.

30:18.570 --> 30:23.253
And even if it's got a little DNA in it, that won't hurt old people anyway, according to Buckhalter.

30:25.086 --> 30:44.789
And really what they were doing was seeding a mythology about a novel virus that would overlap with and be easily misconstrued with the known and expected and hypothesized outcomes that would be big signals in a big population that were being transfected to new proteins.

30:46.980 --> 30:58.363
And tying any of these effects to the spike protein in general, of course, protects transfection as a methodology in general, and puts all of the blame on that special protein.

30:58.743 --> 31:10.707
And so this combination of ideas automatically pigeonholes anybody who's trying to figure this out into putting the round peg in the round hole or the square peg in the square hole and thinking that you solved the puzzle.

31:12.674 --> 31:33.105
But you really haven't because what you've done is accepted their narrative that somehow or another, despite the flaws or the rush or the mistakes or the contamination, this idea is so sound because it goes back 20 or 30 years to the Human Genome Project when all this genius came into fruition and became industrial.

31:35.865 --> 31:52.445
And so all parties have accepted this worst case scenario, which is endemicity, this idea that a virus can go from a mud puddle all the way to covering most of the lungs in the known, you know, human space and environment, and even the lungs of

31:53.969 --> 31:57.314
white-tailed deer in North America and a few other, I guess.

31:57.854 --> 32:09.069
And so this concept is very clever, because if you don't have any data from before 2020, when the novel virus supposedly emerged, the novel RNA signal appears.

32:09.850 --> 32:16.474
then you can't differentiate that from a background RNA signal that may have been present before you started testing.

32:16.494 --> 32:24.560
And in fact, that's almost guaranteed what this is if there is a real bona fide signal, bona fide signal in the background.

32:25.529 --> 32:38.978
then it would be a signal that was already there and that they already took the time to characterize so that they could slowly roll out a series of PCR tests that would be accurate but not accurate or whatever.

32:39.038 --> 32:42.720
I mean, you can imagine all kinds of ways that they could orchestrate that.

32:43.441 --> 32:53.527
One way that would accept some tenements of there being some signal in the background that could be misconstrued or called a coronavirus or a

32:54.528 --> 33:02.832
a lipid particle with RNA in it is that they are everywhere and that they characterized them under the guise of metabiotes sampling all this stuff.

33:02.872 --> 33:16.579
And after they characterized it and put it into the coolest, you know, genealogical phenotypical tree, then they took that sequence and said that that's what they were getting when they were sequencing at DITRA.

33:17.441 --> 33:29.384
And then at some moment when Ditra decided, okay, we'll just let it go and let everybody else sequence the stuff, they had already seeded a phylogenetic tree that was kind of presupposed the background that they knew was already there.

33:29.804 --> 33:40.567
And now it looks like this amazing biological event that really validates this new technology of high throughput sequencing and really validates the

33:41.147 --> 33:44.088
the whole field of virology all in one go.

33:44.168 --> 33:55.912
So we get transfection, we get virology, we get gain of function virology, we get high throughput sequencing, we get all these technologies just get accepted in one giant

33:57.012 --> 34:16.234
one giant enchantment and all it requires is us to acquiesce to the the medium of enchantment which would be social media and especially x so anybody that was on twitter was absolutely and positively fooled and i i am convinced that that is one of the reasons why i was so fooled

34:16.977 --> 34:23.683
because Twitter became my primary window to the people that were, and my primary means of communicating with them.

34:24.143 --> 34:37.014
And because I believed that this was a spontaneous activity that was happening despite what all the world governments would have wanted to happen, I really thought I was in the mystery machine solving this puzzle.

34:38.015 --> 34:40.497
And it took me a really long time to get there.

34:40.557 --> 34:44.581
And when I got there is when all these people went bananas for three years.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.478
And so here we are now with COVID shots are bad.

34:49.558 --> 34:59.141
Nobody talking about the extensive revealing study that happens and released in Scotland again, now in 2024, a new update of it again.

34:59.241 --> 35:00.602
And nobody's talking about that.

35:00.662 --> 35:02.643
Nobody's talking about the murder in 2020.

35:03.843 --> 35:13.647
And if we were talking about the murder in 2020, it would be completely different, but all of these people won't do it because they also then would have to explain what the hell they were doing in 2020 and before.

35:16.223 --> 35:22.086
Here's just the example from Scotland where you can see midazolam used in 2020.

35:22.126 --> 35:23.146
That's clearly murder.

35:24.487 --> 35:28.529
And then that could be misconstrued as a, right?

35:28.969 --> 35:34.072
If you are in 2020, like right here, then you don't know when this is gonna end.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.012
This just looks like, holy balls.

35:36.613 --> 35:39.974
And this is exactly in line with what happened in New York.

35:40.074 --> 35:42.776
Holy cow, we are in trouble.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.861
And then we locked down, so it went away, right?

35:46.021 --> 35:46.581
Oh, it came back.

35:46.701 --> 35:48.162
Oh no, it went away again, it came back.

35:52.584 --> 36:08.671
And so that's why they won't discuss how this background signal could work, and I'm talking about the background signal of RNA, and I'm also talking about the background signal of more people gonna die for the next 10 years, and then go away, or they will go back down, or it will collapse even.

36:09.383 --> 36:11.304
And they won't have saved us from disease.

36:11.364 --> 36:25.574
It will be that this large population of people that's all around the same decade of age, because they were all born into families after World War II and are now aging out, that bump in our population is going to go away.

36:25.634 --> 36:28.376
And then we will be left with a lot fewer people.

36:29.977 --> 36:30.778
And they knew this.

36:32.844 --> 36:36.708
And so they used murder to accelerate that in a few places.

36:36.768 --> 36:43.916
And then they had social media people talking about what going on in America and how the lockdown saved people in Australia and New Zealand.

36:43.956 --> 36:51.304
And that's why you need anonymous accounts on American social media from Australia telling you and saving you from things.

36:52.162 --> 37:02.394
that won't question Robert Malone or Pierre Kory or Peter McCullough or any of these people that needed to travel down to Australia to make sure that in person somebody could tell you how bad it was in America.

37:03.195 --> 37:11.986
Pierre Kory's been all over the world telling people how bad it was in America and he started in the US Senate and then has been on world tours with Robert Malone ever since.

37:13.100 --> 37:18.823
And there's no reason for one guy to be doing that unless they need one guy to do it to stick to the right story.

37:19.563 --> 37:29.827
Or two guys, or five guys, or anybody that they can recruit that's got their head so stuck in their navel they don't understand how they're being used.

37:32.989 --> 37:38.411
And so they don't teach you how PCR can be very accurate on an academic bench, but not for a

37:41.635 --> 37:44.438
a diagnostic and it's elaborate lies.

37:44.478 --> 37:46.339
And it started all the way back in 2020.

37:47.100 --> 37:51.343
They don't define the countermeasures as transformations and transfections, and they never did.

37:51.883 --> 37:55.866
They list and define the many ways that even in its purest form, it wouldn't have worked.

37:56.006 --> 37:56.827
No, they don't.

37:56.887 --> 37:59.029
And it was never going to be in its purest form.

38:00.213 --> 38:02.236
And they won't talk about infectious clones.

38:02.316 --> 38:05.840
And most importantly, Kevin McKernan won't talk about infectious clones.

38:05.860 --> 38:17.255
He says that this whole idea of it just being transformation and transfection and cell culture being misconstrued as virology as chemtrail retarded.

38:18.888 --> 38:32.746
And so I guess he thinks also saying that RNA cannot pandemic is just very easy to dismiss as chemtrail retarded, even though these things are all obvious truths and so I think we can expose this guy just by watching a few videos.

38:33.366 --> 38:34.348
That's the reason why.

38:35.669 --> 38:41.011
Steve Kirsch made an own goal with his, you know, there may be a time when we have safe vaccines.

38:41.031 --> 38:43.952
That's always been the position that these people were going to play.

38:44.413 --> 38:48.294
That's why Steve Kirsch is like one of the largest lifetime donors to the DNC.

38:48.754 --> 38:54.277
That's why Robert Malone was actually a Democrat his whole life, and you can find evidence for it online.

38:54.757 --> 38:58.478
That's why Transfection and Transformation was on Robert Malone's resume in 2017.

38:58.899 --> 39:04.361
And that's why we have Elon Musk being said by Tucker Carlson to have

39:04.961 --> 39:07.742
saved free speech, which is just absolutely absurd.

39:08.842 --> 39:26.527
This is a military operation to get you to accept and use a military program as a substitute for free speech while you're actually giving away a great deal of how you think and a great deal of what you pay attention to and reveal what you want to pay attention to, to the people who care.

39:27.495 --> 39:41.006
And so this guy gets on, not a week ago even, and says that polio was bad and smallpox was bad and without those vaccines, we'd still have smallpox and polio, almost as if he thinks the kids are still getting a smallpox vaccine.

39:41.506 --> 39:47.071
And he, like Kevin McKernan, all the way back in 2020, says that regulation is killing America.

39:47.131 --> 39:56.619
So this guy who has a military technology company for tunneling, rockets, satellite, internet,

39:58.065 --> 40:00.627
and RNA and electric cars.

40:02.409 --> 40:08.873
This guy is claiming that number one, he is so good at business that he can do all of those things.

40:09.134 --> 40:14.378
And that he has so many ideas that he can assemble people that can make those things.

40:14.898 --> 40:20.102
And so he makes Steve Jobs, who just made the iPhone, look like kind of a chump, right?

40:20.142 --> 40:22.304
Because Steve Jobs should have also had

40:23.044 --> 40:31.986
tunneling company and a rocket company and a and space company and electric car company and Self-driving company.

40:32.486 --> 40:33.987
He should have had all those things too.

40:34.047 --> 40:35.907
If he was a really really cool guy.

40:35.927 --> 40:37.208
I mean, what is Jeff Bezos?

40:37.608 --> 40:44.890
He's just got a rocket I mean, he doesn't have a rocket company that gets contracts and puts satellites up in the air for his other company.

40:44.930 --> 40:50.271
That's making Come on guys We've got to wake up

40:51.445 --> 40:54.989
We gotta get out of this, we gotta snap out of it.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.532
And we need to snap out of it now.

40:58.052 --> 41:10.646
And coming to you as humbly as I possibly can, being the guy who was trapped on X from 2020, because I was, I needed to be trapped.

41:11.066 --> 41:12.027
They sought me out.

41:13.103 --> 41:15.746
Like they sought me out and trapped me on purpose.

41:15.866 --> 41:25.558
And several of these people worked together several different times from the Brett Weinstein signal chat to the Steve Kerr steering committee.

41:26.159 --> 41:27.501
I have seen how they do it.

41:28.666 --> 41:30.248
This is always how they do it.

41:30.688 --> 41:37.896
And if you are making any progress on these social media platforms, they are actively doing it to you, I assure you.

41:38.597 --> 41:47.826
And you need to, in retrospect, and internally investigate who you're following and what you're listening to to understand how it is they do it.

41:48.407 --> 41:55.589
If you're just watching podcasts and enjoying them, then you're already 12 meters under in the pool.

41:56.070 --> 42:06.413
But if you're treading water at the surface, what you're doing is arguing with these people, and you still think that some of these people here are okay, and they're not.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.965
Wittingly or unwittingly, they are gone.

42:10.085 --> 42:16.206
They are already part of the machine and their livelihood and everything depends on it, just like mine did.

42:16.826 --> 42:27.569
And had I shut my mouth and kept working, maybe, maybe not, but I would have had a better chance of staying in the system had I not opened my mouth.

42:27.849 --> 42:32.130
But when I opened my mouth, I invoked this machine.

42:33.290 --> 42:35.651
I became the focus of these people.

42:37.523 --> 42:51.155
And it started with Kevin McCairn and Paul Cottrell, who later became related to George Webb to me, but I didn't know that because George Webb had already blocked me on X from the beginning of the pandemic.

42:51.556 --> 42:52.737
I was already blocked by him.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.020
And so you can see how the whole thing works.

42:57.816 --> 43:02.600
It becomes immediately apparent in retrospect if you look back and see it.

43:02.700 --> 43:04.922
It's just one continuous game.

43:05.542 --> 43:17.732
Because at some point three years later, Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan are actually promoted on the same LifeSite News article where they're both like speaking to some health group in Australia.

43:20.066 --> 43:40.181
And so these people have been performing and coordinating a confusion narrative online designed to get you to think that you're solving a mystery and giving you different pieces of the puzzle, but never all of them, in order to keep all of us solving the mystery on our own in our head and keep us in the chair.

43:41.142 --> 43:45.125
And the more you engage, the more likely it is that they're going to get you.

43:56.072 --> 43:58.074
And so I think it's time to dare to look again.

43:58.114 --> 43:59.455
And that's what I want to do here.

43:59.575 --> 44:02.798
So I'm going to see how this works.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.202
Let's see here.

44:08.837 --> 44:09.077
Yes.

44:09.518 --> 44:22.029
So if you go to GigaOMBiological.com slash archive, and you scroll down, and if your screen is like mine over here, and it's too tiny, then it'll be in more and you go into archive there, that's where this is.

44:22.689 --> 44:28.394
And if you scroll down here, you can find the two videos where I talk about Kevin McKernan.

44:28.454 --> 44:30.796
So this is where he comes on my podcast here.

44:31.837 --> 44:35.300
So I think it's important to watch this video again, so you can see how

44:37.468 --> 44:54.779
impressed I was with his resume and and remember at this time I'm just a neuroscientist trying to figure out it's December it's 1010 what is it let me see the Vimeo it is move head

44:56.152 --> 44:56.692
It is 12, 12, 21.

44:59.174 --> 44:59.734
Okay.

44:59.774 --> 45:02.956
So that's when the real, the real interview took place.

45:03.176 --> 45:08.219
And I'm still in my old house, the one that we lost, um, that we really wanted to keep in the woods.

45:09.479 --> 45:14.622
Um, and so, uh, I apologize for, you're going to see my bedroom for a second there, but it's not my bedroom now.

45:15.563 --> 45:19.285
Uh, and I think it's important to listen to this because, um,

45:21.417 --> 45:23.417
This is the same month, okay?

45:23.537 --> 45:24.438
This is 12-12.

45:24.978 --> 45:33.940
And now on my website, stream.gigaohm.bio, there's a channel called The Bat Cave.

45:35.400 --> 45:39.281
And in that channel, The Bat Cave, you can find a lot of difference.

45:39.321 --> 45:40.381
So let me go to home.

45:41.121 --> 45:43.522
And then if you go to home, you go down here to Bat Cave.

45:43.562 --> 45:44.462
That's this one here.

45:44.542 --> 45:44.922
See that?

45:45.002 --> 45:45.222
Click.

45:45.862 --> 45:52.407
And then you'll get to this list of videos and you can go down here and you can see the December 30th, 2020 Kevin McKernan.

45:53.067 --> 45:57.050
Even after the vaccine, they want masks and they want social distancing.

45:57.290 --> 45:59.572
And there doesn't seem to be any exit strategy for this.

45:59.892 --> 46:06.377
So now what I want to show you here is that this is in the same month.

46:06.557 --> 46:10.180
Kevin McKernan is on this guy's podcast for the third time here.

46:10.220 --> 46:14.523
And just listen to their banter and how happy he is and listen to what they talk about.

46:15.049 --> 46:18.031
the UN and others in third world countries, there's going to be starvation.

46:18.712 --> 46:26.458
I'm Christina Hudson Kohler, an egg processing manager living in Syracuse, New York, and you are listening to the Vance Crowe podcast.

46:26.806 --> 46:31.590
Now remember, Vance Crowe used to work for the World Bank and something else and something else.

46:31.650 --> 46:39.175
And now he started a podcast at the beginning of the pandemic and had Kevin McKernan on in May and in June and now in December.

46:39.215 --> 46:40.877
This is the third time he's been on.

46:41.397 --> 46:45.720
And this is exactly the same month that I interviewed him just two weeks later.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.703
And listen just briefly to what they talk about.

46:49.543 --> 47:10.390
And think about how it is that somebody who claims to be a pot geneticist, who was testing pot for COVID at the beginning of the pandemic because he was afraid it might get in the supply chain, knows so much about so many things in February of, this is December of 2020.

47:11.170 --> 47:16.011
So think about this, December of 2020, when does he come on my program?

47:16.692 --> 47:17.692
A year later.

47:20.103 --> 47:24.930
A year later, okay, so a year later he's working on me.

47:25.831 --> 47:34.322
This is a year before, and look at his banter, look at what he's talking about, look at what he says, look at how comfortable he is with this dude.

47:35.697 --> 47:37.098
Welcome back to the podcast.

47:37.218 --> 47:39.180
I'm glad you're here today.

47:39.260 --> 47:42.723
I'm interviewing a past guest, Kevin McKernan.

47:43.143 --> 47:48.028
Kevin is a scientist that once was working at MIT on the human genome project.

47:48.448 --> 47:59.257
He has then separated, started his own company, built them up, and he is an expert in the PCR space, which is really an interesting space to be in during coronavirus.

47:59.317 --> 48:02.340
So we have a wild conversation about

48:02.840 --> 48:10.525
the details of those tests, those nasal swabs that people are having shoved up their noses and the rapid test and what does the antigen test mean.

48:11.506 --> 48:14.368
And Kevin is one of those guys that I love staying in contact with.

48:14.428 --> 48:20.332
I watch him on Twitter and I find his perspective to be interesting if only because it's different.

48:20.512 --> 48:37.539
I happen to find Kevin to be intelligent, fair-minded, able to articulate complicated ideas, but even if he wasn't, I really love the fact that I'm able to explore ideas that are not being published in other places, and I think that that is a really important thing.

48:37.879 --> 48:43.482
We're going to get to the interview, but one thing that you should be aware of is if you like conversations like this.

48:44.142 --> 48:53.386
Conversations with people that want to push the envelope, that they believe that their faith is best tested by going out and exploring the world, consider joining the Articulate Ventures Network.

48:53.826 --> 49:01.869
It is a place where we have big conversations about all kinds of complicated ideas and people have various perspectives that are not all in sync.

49:02.109 --> 49:06.310
But I want you to hear how it opens.

49:06.630 --> 49:13.133
Because if you hear how it opens and you hear how happy he is, I want you to see how different it is when he interviews with me a year later.

49:14.349 --> 49:17.573
at network.articulate.ventures.

49:18.073 --> 49:21.777
So I'm gonna head now to the interview with Dr. Kevin McKernan.

49:22.198 --> 49:25.041
Kevin McKernan, welcome back to the pod.

49:25.061 --> 49:25.842
Thank you.

49:25.962 --> 49:27.163
Yes, it's been too long.

49:28.705 --> 49:29.866
Miss Chandy about this stuff.

49:30.086 --> 49:32.148
What's my world has changed.

49:32.188 --> 49:43.978
So for anybody that is new to the podcast, Kevin McKernan was one of the very first guests I had on that was willing to take a contrary position to the national narrative about what was going on with coronavirus.

49:44.339 --> 49:47.081
And I don't mean it contrary as in like it wasn't there.

49:47.562 --> 49:50.344
It was let's think about the measures that we're taking.

49:50.684 --> 49:51.986
Let's lay out some lines.

49:52.006 --> 49:53.067
Let's talk about data.

49:53.727 --> 50:00.673
And man, you are the guy that I turn to when I say it's really easy to me to know what the national narrative is.

50:01.133 --> 50:03.895
But how do I know what other people are thinking?

50:03.915 --> 50:05.597
Because it's often pushed out of the world.

50:05.677 --> 50:07.038
So what do you think?

50:07.999 --> 50:12.202
What is the status of coronavirus right now at the end of December of 2020?

50:14.304 --> 50:23.391
OK, well, my sense of it is it would be much better if they didn't make a lot of these generic outpatient treatments illegal in our country.

50:23.631 --> 50:31.737
So for those who aren't familiar with ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, which we probably spoke about many months ago, those have proven to work really well in India.

50:32.277 --> 50:38.202
And now we have doctors down at the Department of Homeland Security pounding the fist on the table to open them up for US use.

50:38.242 --> 50:39.342
And I think that just happened.

50:40.223 --> 50:47.567
Ironically, like the week they made the vaccine available, they opened up those two, which is kind of incredible timing.

50:47.607 --> 50:56.412
But yeah, I think in India, they're seeing something like 90 or 80 or 90 deaths per million and maybe 100 deaths per million.

50:56.432 --> 50:58.473
And we're up at like 800 here in the States.

50:58.573 --> 51:05.776
And one of the things they do there is if you get symptoms, they don't tell you to wait around for a couple of weeks before coming to the hospital.

51:07.017 --> 51:08.638
They give you hydroxychloroquine out of the gate.

51:09.119 --> 51:10.860
And I think the ivermectin data looks even better.

51:11.060 --> 51:16.185
So those are really cheap, off-patent drugs that haven't been used quite a bit here.

51:16.245 --> 51:19.748
And so we have a contagion here that's larger than it needs to be.

51:20.748 --> 51:30.917
At the same time, there's a lot of other folks I follow on Twitter that have some really good studies here, or will point you to a lot of good studies that demonstrate the excess deaths are fairly exaggerated here in the news.

51:31.277 --> 51:35.441
We have this obsession of following PCR cases, and PCR cases are really not informative.

51:36.121 --> 51:36.221
I'm

51:51.307 --> 51:51.327
a

52:24.715 --> 52:28.817
It's not reflective of what's actually going on if you dig into the numbers.

52:29.477 --> 52:32.138
The numbers are we have a second wave that's really a ripple.

52:32.658 --> 52:36.420
Although, if you look at the PCR data, it looks as big, if not bigger, than the first wave.

52:36.940 --> 52:40.601
But it's just not pulling through in terms of the IFR.

52:40.761 --> 52:42.482
The IFR, and this continues to go down.

52:42.542 --> 52:46.624
I think John Ioannidis just put some work out demonstrating it approaching the flu now.

52:47.504 --> 52:56.907
which I think is what we spoke about back in March, is that this thing would eventually reach the flu, if not lower, because it'll probably reflect what most other coronaviruses do over time.

52:57.367 --> 53:01.048
You know, your treatments get better and you understand the disease.

53:01.108 --> 53:03.309
Now, it's important to see a couple things here.

53:03.369 --> 53:06.650
Number one, Vance Crowe pushed Twitter.

53:06.970 --> 53:09.111
It was the only, the only

53:10.242 --> 53:13.323
The only social media he mentioned was Twitter.

53:14.064 --> 53:19.586
He didn't say, I'm happy to be on YouTube or thank goodness YouTube doesn't wipe my nothing.

53:20.306 --> 53:21.387
He only said Twitter.

53:21.887 --> 53:24.788
This guy also only said Twitter.

53:26.649 --> 53:31.951
And what I think I see here, and only in retrospect, is it visible?

53:31.991 --> 53:34.732
Because as we get farther and farther down the road, right?

53:34.792 --> 53:39.174
The more that you look back and see that all of these things line up a little too neatly.

53:40.447 --> 53:48.593
All of these stories line up a little too neatly, and all of these people's stories start, like wait, they were all on this.

53:48.653 --> 53:50.314
They were all on the same bullshit.

53:51.655 --> 53:54.076
And it's not because they were all watching the TV.

53:57.218 --> 54:00.821
Kevin McKernan isn't reading the New York Times to get his bits.

54:01.801 --> 54:06.785
Kevin McKernan isn't active in a bunch of DM groups asking people what they think.

54:08.442 --> 54:11.645
And he's not here to ask Vance Crowe what Vance Crowe thinks.

54:15.589 --> 54:18.111
Look at how enthusiastic, look at how certain.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.254
There's no mysteries here.

54:21.274 --> 54:23.116
This guy knows exactly what's going on.

54:24.877 --> 54:32.004
Now, one year later, I should let it go for a little while longer, but one year later, I'm gonna interview with him.

54:33.002 --> 54:39.108
more, you understand who it affects, and you try to protect the vulnerable, and you do a better job at managing the disease, and the numbers improve over time.

54:39.168 --> 54:47.114
So, yeah, I think there's a lot of problems in the PCR side of things, and that's what seems to be driving the panic and the fear.

54:47.835 --> 54:53.000
And a lot of that, I think, is a misunderstanding of what PCR is measuring.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.441
It's really not measuring your

54:54.701 --> 55:11.567
Well, here, let's stop for a second, because one of the biggest differences between when you and I spoke the first time and now is that I didn't know anyone that had coronavirus, but we were watching videos of people laying dead bodies in the street and running away, right?

55:11.707 --> 55:14.828
So now it's been a little bit inverted.

55:14.888 --> 55:16.929
Like, we don't see those types of things now.

55:16.989 --> 55:18.189
We maybe see hospitals.

55:18.209 --> 55:21.811
I don't watch regular news, so I don't really have that much of a chance to see it.

55:22.611 --> 55:28.034
But I do know people that have lost grandparents to coronavirus.

55:28.094 --> 55:33.517
I know people that are in their 50s going to the emergency room and getting put on ventilators.

55:34.057 --> 55:41.401
So like one thing that I hesitate as I'm hearing you describe this stuff is because I'm like, I don't know, man.

55:41.682 --> 55:43.963
Seems like people got pretty sick with this one.

55:44.571 --> 55:46.933
Yeah, I'm not a denier.

55:47.133 --> 55:47.633
It's happening.

55:47.653 --> 55:49.795
Without a doubt, there's a virus spreading around.

55:49.815 --> 55:56.180
But you have to also put it in context to all the other numbers that are going on.

55:56.220 --> 55:58.481
The flu has disappeared.

55:58.581 --> 56:03.765
So this time last year, there's probably some coronavirus floating around that we all called the flu.

56:03.785 --> 56:06.647
So we probably under-called it last year, and we're probably over-calling it this year.

56:07.848 --> 56:09.449
So yeah, those things do happen.

56:09.530 --> 56:12.492
There is a very- So there's no questioning of the narrative here at all?

56:13.032 --> 56:13.292
None.

56:13.933 --> 56:24.018
And a very joyous reunion, a very joyous reiteration of what's going on, a very swift summary with a lot of jovial and upbeat energy.

56:25.179 --> 56:36.025
Not a dim and grim outlook at all about the level of deception or malevolence that must be involved at this stage if it's not that big of a deal, but everybody still thinks it is a big deal.

56:37.646 --> 56:40.187
Something is not congruent here anymore.

56:41.647 --> 56:46.011
You're telling us that the rocket is crashing, but you're not really that panicked.

56:46.731 --> 56:51.996
You're telling us that the parachute is not gonna work, but you're not that panicked.

56:52.656 --> 56:58.441
You're telling us that we don't know where this train is going because they're telling us stories, but you're not that panicked.

57:02.850 --> 57:08.174
So let's just escape out of here and see what the other one holds for us.

57:08.254 --> 57:12.277
And now we're going to go to Vmil here, and I can put that link in the chat if you want.

57:12.337 --> 57:14.519
You can also just find it by, oh no, I can't.

57:15.119 --> 57:16.100
That's the other computer.

57:16.220 --> 57:18.122
You're just going to have to find it on my webpage.

57:19.783 --> 57:22.285
So let's see how this works.

57:24.875 --> 57:25.996
Oh, there we go.

57:26.036 --> 57:28.058
All right.

57:29.059 --> 57:30.100
OK, so my background.

57:30.881 --> 57:33.403
So first of all, don't be disturbed.

57:33.463 --> 57:43.372
But at this time already, at the end of 2021 was when I started to develop whatever that thing was on my vocal cords that exploded on the 23rd.

57:44.033 --> 57:48.998
Sorry, the like Halloween day or whenever we were having the Halloween party here.

57:51.385 --> 57:58.942
In October of last year, some great big bubble exploded in my throat and I coughed up a bunch of blood and then this voice came back.

57:59.002 --> 58:01.729
But I have the bad voice in this video, just beware.

58:02.571 --> 58:04.493
I've been in genomics for about 25 years.

58:05.253 --> 58:09.857
I started at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.

58:09.917 --> 58:13.340
This is with Eric Lander working on the Human Genome Project.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.301
I was the team leader for R&D there.

58:15.341 --> 58:22.848
We built all the robotics that's in that Nature paper for the floor that does all the purification and sequencing for that project.

58:23.428 --> 58:25.989
And around 2000 I spun some of that stuff out.

58:26.049 --> 58:36.352
There was several patents we filed on magnetic bead isolation of viruses and DNA from E. coli and that stuff got spun out to a company called Agincourt.

58:37.212 --> 58:42.994
Agincourt became one of the larger sequencing providers in the country at the time and eventually got

58:43.254 --> 58:47.456
acquired by Beckman Coulter for a lot of the viral purification tools we had.

58:47.496 --> 58:51.459
We were building these RNA and DNA purification kits using these magnetic beads.

58:51.539 --> 58:53.840
And so they needed that and they needed both.

58:53.960 --> 59:00.263
And so he has been working on technology specifically related to viral isolation.

59:00.583 --> 59:08.628
And of course, we know that viral isolation is already very sketchy if you're not acknowledging all the other signals that are likely to be at that same fraction.

59:09.704 --> 59:29.292
can go into that later in our biology 101 in our molecular course but this this is this is nuts and in case you haven't heard I'll just drop it in here because it popped into my head the red pill conference is no longer an in-person event because according to Ed Griffin's post on on the website that I guess there's a

59:30.310 --> 59:33.312
a general worry that there will be unrest after the election.

59:33.352 --> 59:35.733
And so not very many people are interested in traveling.

59:36.314 --> 59:46.220
And so because of extremely low turnout, they've decided to invest all of their resources into the free live stream that they're going to make out of it.

59:46.280 --> 59:58.327
So for better or for worse, the red pill that I was supposed to be one of the headliners at, at the November 17th or 16th in Oklahoma is now going to be a virtual event only.

01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:04.090
that onto some of the automation they had.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:09.494
So they came and acquired the company and spun out one of our R&D projects that was building the solid sequencer at the time.

01:00:10.535 --> 01:00:13.217
That got acquired a year later by Applied Biosystems.

01:00:13.317 --> 01:00:14.758
They brought that sequencer to market.

01:00:15.899 --> 01:00:21.604
I spent about five years there, working on a platform competing with Illumina and then also brewing up other ones.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:23.785
We ultimately acquired Ion Torrent.

01:00:24.966 --> 01:00:26.227
which makes these chips right here.

01:00:26.887 --> 01:00:29.829
Another one of those little sequencers that runs on a chip.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:33.391
And that, I didn't invent any of that.

01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:40.395
I was just someone who, we saw the technology and pulled it in, and Jonathan Rothberg's team kind of carried a lot of that weight, but our team at Beverly also.

01:00:40.615 --> 01:00:46.799
Now, far be it from me to be paranoid, but I'm analyzing my own show here, like looking through there, looking at the camera.

01:00:46.879 --> 01:00:47.440
So it's,

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.466
You know, it's already goofy, but remember, I'm not trying to analyze my own show so much as to illustrate how bamboozled I was at the time.

01:00:55.526 --> 01:01:00.110
This is still when, um, let me think about this very carefully.

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:00.110
21.

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.210
Hmm.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.662
No, I was already done.

01:01:10.682 --> 01:01:12.565
I was already on my own here.

01:01:12.665 --> 01:01:19.938
So this was right before, actually, if I think about it now in the timeline, it would be in January of 2022.

01:01:19.978 --> 01:01:20.559
So just one month later.

01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:45.776
when oh wow okay so this video takes place on 12-12-2021 and in January of 2022 is when Charles Rixey came to my house in Pittsburgh actually this house right here spent the night and we did a stream that a couple months later would be the stream that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:53.461
would tell me that Robert Malone sat him down and made him watch and that was the reason why he called me and wanted to hire me as a consultant

01:01:54.687 --> 01:01:57.749
And so this is one month before Charles Rixey comes to my house.

01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:59.691
This guy wanted to be on my street.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.417
It's just what it is, right?

01:02:08.717 --> 01:02:09.838
I don't know what to tell you.

01:02:10.198 --> 01:02:11.759
I didn't have any followers then.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.981
I wasn't, I was, I was dying here.

01:02:17.183 --> 01:02:17.363
Like,

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:25.163
If it wasn't for Greg at this time, my family would have never even, I mean, it's crazy.

01:02:26.464 --> 01:02:29.105
And there were all kinds of different people that were helping me back then.

01:02:30.406 --> 01:02:40.812
And I can't thank any of them enough for allowing me to go through that even when I wasn't really there yet, even close to there yet, fully under their control, really.

01:02:42.033 --> 01:02:48.977
So now remember what he told Vance Crowe a year before about PCR tests being, you know, kind of not right, but right.

01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:54.247
You know, there being multiple variants, there's definitely a virus.

01:02:55.028 --> 01:02:58.995
All of these things that he was talking about, this is a year later.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.301
about 100 of us jumped on making that platform sing.

01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:11.002
And then after that, I kind of just jumped out to start, we need to do something different.

01:03:11.022 --> 01:03:18.105
And I had a non-compete and now the company was LifeTech and it pretty much meant I couldn't work anywhere in the biotech space because they had fingers everywhere.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:25.467
So I started working in the cannabis space doing sequencing cannabis genomes, trying to get more of these compounds public, if you will.

01:03:27.117 --> 01:03:39.363
And what I mean by public is there's a lot of the things that you're seeing in COVID right now have been plaguing that industry for decades.

01:03:40.543 --> 01:03:42.204
He actually wasn't in the other room though.

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:48.807
He was sitting right next to me and I had me on the green screen and then I had him on a separate camera so I could make myself smaller.

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:50.667
really a trick.

01:03:51.288 --> 01:03:54.249
I had him in the same room next to me.

01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:56.830
It looked like that, but it wasn't.

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.491
This was really when I had no space at all.

01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:01.191
I was pulling this off.

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:05.153
This was really a desk with a curtain behind it.

01:04:05.273 --> 01:04:12.096
And then I sat him at a little table next to me against the wall where the ceiling was slanted.

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:12.916
It was pretty funny.

01:04:12.976 --> 01:04:17.678
If it looked like he was in a different room, then I did that way better than I thought I did.

01:04:19.497 --> 01:04:25.119
Science is funded primarily by government, and it crafts a certain narrative about harms.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:31.322
And so I was noticing that that plant was severely underappreciated, and we just put its genome public.

01:04:31.622 --> 01:04:34.664
And since then, we've been building tool picks and shovels.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:43.728
We sell snip chips and PCR kits to that industry to help them breed and help them track down viruses and track down different microbes that may affect the yield of the plant.

01:04:44.788 --> 01:04:45.549
That's my background.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.511
I did do a little bit of clinical sequencing as well for five years.

01:04:48.971 --> 01:04:51.433
So I know some of the CLIA rules and regulations.

01:04:51.893 --> 01:04:53.715
I wonder what clinical sequencing he did.

01:04:53.755 --> 01:04:54.835
It's probably cancer.

01:04:54.875 --> 01:05:02.120
I'm just guessing because his dad died of cancer and his brothers have a cancer company, so it's probably likely that it was something like that.

01:05:02.961 --> 01:05:04.142
I don't know off the top of my head.

01:05:04.543 --> 01:05:07.325
You should be doing PCR and not be doing PCR in clinical settings.

01:05:07.385 --> 01:05:10.828
And that got me dragged into the Corman-Drawston review.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.330
And then I've been doing some work very recently.

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:20.477
And the Corman-Drawston review is this paper that Claire Craig, Mike Eden, Thomas Binder, Kevin McKernan.

01:05:21.535 --> 01:05:28.980
and a bunch of other people that all have some interesting contribution to 2020, 21 and 22.

01:05:29.941 --> 01:05:34.964
Just take note, I'm quite certain that Claire Craig is on this team.

01:05:35.825 --> 01:05:42.429
Before the pandemic, she was gathering genomes as a clinical pathologist and part of a 100,000 Genomes Project.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.671
So she's on the same team for sure.

01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:50.975
It's just a question of whether Mike Eden and Thomas Binder were included to make sure that

01:05:51.676 --> 01:06:06.310
Mike Eden and Thomas Binder accepted Claire Craig and these other people as as real experts to, and they were kind of being absorbed into that paper or whether that paper is actually in retrospect and admission that these people are all on some kind of team.

01:06:06.831 --> 01:06:07.612
I have the feeling.

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:12.876
that any of that is possible, but it's least likely for Thomas Binder.

01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:17.840
I think Thomas Binder has shown the ability to say we should end the who.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:27.888
Thomas Binder has shown that it's nonsense and said it's nonsense and had not gotten too deep in any particular argument or tried to be too specific with any argument.

01:06:28.648 --> 01:06:31.289
Which was what Mike Eden did for a very long time, too.

01:06:31.329 --> 01:06:54.059
It's only very recently that I've become worried about Mike Eden, and only because they've used him to promote people like Sasha Latupova, who are absolutely positively part of Team Robert Malone, as much as Meryl Nass is, or Mary Holland is, or any of these other people, CHD, who published his books, and they're all on that team.

01:06:55.019 --> 01:07:10.836
I don't know who and how that hierarchy works or who they work for, but it seems likely that some player in there is Elon Musk and X, because in the beginning of the pandemic, all of these people were united in saying that the truth was being sorted out on X.

01:07:11.437 --> 01:07:19.144
and that there was censorship on X. And then, right, then it kind of gets set up to fail and then Elon Musk rescues it.

01:07:19.524 --> 01:07:25.930
And now those same people are still on X and still saying that X is the place and still promoting Elon Musk.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:29.032
And Elon Musk is still promoting X as a really cool place.

01:07:29.553 --> 01:07:31.895
And yet there is where you see all the censorship.

01:07:32.275 --> 01:07:34.577
There is where you see all the nonsense.

01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:37.500
That is where this guy attacked me for two and a half years.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:46.322
there and Substack, another social media that popped up during the pandemic that everybody just takes for granted as being something that's useful.

01:07:46.402 --> 01:08:00.025
But in reality, who is the controller of that platform has a great deal of power and a great deal of access to information and to see how people swim in schools of thought.

01:08:01.305 --> 01:08:06.646
That's no different than what X is, except X has this added benefit of you scrolling.

01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:13.108
And so it can actually put things that it wants you to see in front of you and not things that it doesn't want you to see.

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:21.930
And that whole process is taken for granted as some kind of algorithm that we influence with our behavior, which is absolutely positively.

01:08:25.222 --> 01:08:35.230
That's the trap, but it's important to see that this guy said Twitter on my interview a year later, and he said it on Vance Crowe's podcast each time he was on it.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:44.618
Not Facebook, not I'm trying to get it out on all platforms, or you can find me anywhere by looking up at Super Catman.

01:08:45.398 --> 01:08:53.324
He's not on any other platform but X. Vance Crowe's not mentioning any other platform but X.

01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:55.570
Where's his video listed?

01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:56.290
He doesn't care.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.711
It's Twitter that he likes.

01:09:01.052 --> 01:09:02.092
I see something, Hen.

01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:07.094
Yeah, I'm just looking at the mRNA structures with Peter McCullough and a few others.

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:21.560
Yeah, it's a really, now that I hear it put that succinctly, I'm kind of, well, I'm thoroughly humbled now, and I really feel like I'm definitely interviewing someone who I need to be interviewing, and that's really great.

01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:24.228
Do you want to expand?

01:09:24.288 --> 01:09:25.569
Look at that face.

01:09:25.869 --> 01:09:28.530
This is a person who's doing a job here.

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:37.533
This is not a person who's giving away his free time because he's trying to save our grandchildren, or he really thinks this needs to get out.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.793
This is really urgent.

01:09:38.853 --> 01:09:40.534
This guy is working right now.

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:47.556
And not only is he working, but he seriously needs to achieve something here, and he's worried he might not achieve it.

01:09:47.796 --> 01:09:48.557
That's what I see.

01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:51.818
Because with Vance Crowe, he wasn't worried about it at all.

01:09:53.695 --> 01:09:55.376
Hey, it's good to talk to you again, man.

01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:57.777
I really miss talking to you about this stuff.

01:09:57.877 --> 01:10:01.039
Or maybe it's a year later and he's just sick of this crap.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.222
And it all, is there, has anything happened with the Corman Dorstan thing at all?

01:10:07.382 --> 01:10:18.368
So that thing we've, we, we put that public, it got, the first one got attacked pretty heavily and we put a public, so we wrote like another 60 pages trying to explain all the references behind it.

01:10:19.089 --> 01:10:20.229
That thing barely ever got read.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:23.171
I don't even think Stephen Boston read it when he, when he reviewed the paper.

01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:28.478
So there is, if you go to my Twitter page, go through the story that's on the top of that page.

01:10:28.518 --> 01:10:40.589
What's really interesting about what's pinned up there is that the people who are trying to attack that paper are on record in court cases before attacking Steven Wakefield for the same damn PCR problems that are in the Drosten paper.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:44.353
And they got Pete having all the evidence to do it.

01:10:44.413 --> 01:10:50.138
Did he just plug Wakefield as being a guy who said some PCR problems?

01:10:51.598 --> 01:10:53.679
Did he just plug Wakefield?

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.061
Holy balls.

01:10:58.582 --> 01:11:09.608
Talk about laying it down thick and making sure no matter what lead you choose to chase down, you inevitably end up in a limited spectrum of debate curated by the show.

01:11:09.628 --> 01:11:11.349
Whoa.

01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:24.782
are on record in court cases before attacking Steven Wakefield for the same damn PCR problems that are in the Drosten paper.

01:11:25.963 --> 01:11:28.587
And they got paid half a million pounds to do it.

01:11:28.647 --> 01:11:31.331
Steven Buston got paid by Glaxo to take down Wakefield.

01:11:32.599 --> 01:11:35.922
And he was attacking him for not having internal controls in the PCR.

01:11:37.503 --> 01:11:38.563
So careful, right?

01:11:38.623 --> 01:11:49.891
Because he's saying that somebody got paid to take down Wakefield, but then he's not going to talk about vaccines or what might have been covered up or all that story is going to be left for me to chase down.

01:11:51.923 --> 01:12:01.730
This is a year after he was talking to Vance Crowe and he just happens to throw in Wakefield and PCR and Wakefield had the same problems.

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:13.137
That's actually him going and throwing stuff into my head, throwing stuff into my notes, throwing stuff into leads that I have to follow later.

01:12:13.177 --> 01:12:14.198
And where will I end up?

01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:18.321
Vaxxed.

01:12:19.622 --> 01:12:24.206
Wakefield, the MMR vaccine, or maybe some component of it hurt my child.

01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:26.568
Oh, wait, it's a fake paper.

01:12:26.648 --> 01:12:27.269
No, it's not.

01:12:30.992 --> 01:12:34.155
Directly into the trap.

01:12:35.411 --> 01:12:37.593
or not, which, you know, Drosten had no internal controls.

01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:40.195
At least, at least Wakefield tried to have an internal control.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:42.176
It just wasn't performing appropriately.

01:12:42.477 --> 01:12:43.117
Oh, I see.

01:12:43.157 --> 01:12:43.598
You're right.

01:12:43.798 --> 01:12:44.598
Andrew Wakefield.

01:12:44.638 --> 01:12:45.559
Thank you very much.

01:12:45.719 --> 01:12:46.820
Left-handed monkey wrench.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.621
I'm confused.

01:12:47.661 --> 01:12:48.161
That's good.

01:12:48.221 --> 01:12:49.222
Good, good, good, good.

01:12:49.302 --> 01:12:51.944
Don't be, don't, don't think that you're wrong there.

01:12:52.064 --> 01:12:53.525
So who's Steven Wakefield then?

01:12:53.565 --> 01:12:54.726
We have to look this guy up.

01:12:54.846 --> 01:12:55.126
Sorry.

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:55.987
I'm going to stop here.

01:12:57.908 --> 01:12:58.449
Steve.

01:13:04.619 --> 01:13:05.579
Wonder who that would be.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.401
I don't even know if that's someone.

01:13:08.461 --> 01:13:09.742
No, that's not it either.

01:13:23.308 --> 01:13:24.149
Is it Georgetown?

01:13:24.549 --> 01:13:25.169
No, it can't be.

01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:26.870
There's a lot of these guys.

01:13:27.411 --> 01:13:29.231
Okay, well, we know that it's not that one.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:29.692
I'm sorry.

01:13:29.732 --> 01:13:32.033
I almost went a little bit nuts there.

01:13:34.155 --> 01:13:36.437
But that's what happens when you get paranoid like this.

01:13:36.517 --> 01:13:37.918
It's pretty impressive.

01:13:40.059 --> 01:13:41.941
Maybe he was thinking of Steven Hatfield.

01:13:41.981 --> 01:13:43.082
OK, sorry about that one.

01:13:43.102 --> 01:13:43.922
That was a little glitch.

01:13:44.223 --> 01:13:44.583
Had one.

01:13:44.983 --> 01:13:45.944
Drosten doesn't even have one.

01:13:47.005 --> 01:13:50.387
And then a lot of the other things that we've, you know, the protocol wasn't very clear.

01:13:50.407 --> 01:13:57.753
A lot of the critiques that we put forward in terms of primer dimers and everything else, those things exist in the Drosten protocol.

01:13:57.793 --> 01:14:01.696
He was on record in a legal case attacking Wakefield for those same things.

01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:05.078
That's the reviewer that Euro surveillance could pull up.

01:14:05.438 --> 01:14:07.539
Okay, so it must be another PCR test.

01:14:07.599 --> 01:14:08.600
I apologize for that.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.140
My bad.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.261
I don't know who that is.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.742
And I guess that's also, it's the same thing.

01:14:12.802 --> 01:14:14.183
I'm supposed to chase that down.

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:18.085
If I don't know that paper, then that's something else I have to learn here, right?

01:14:18.145 --> 01:14:27.949
Instead of looking at and talking about the biology of PCR and how it could be or not be, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're laying seeds that will get me lost.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.690
It's the only one that went public.

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.291
They wouldn't put any of the reviews public.

01:14:32.279 --> 01:14:42.026
Um, so we just have to go to the fact that he leaked some of this information on a podcast that he was a reviewer and he didn't even look at the primaries during the review, which is what our whole 60 page addendum was attacking.

01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:43.487
So I don't know.

01:14:43.527 --> 01:14:47.410
I don't have much hope that like clarifying that's going to end the pandemic, you know, back then.

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.470
No, I agree.

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:48.971
I agree.

01:14:49.011 --> 01:14:53.594
And so much of that is technical that, that, that for the vast majority of the people that

01:14:54.292 --> 01:14:58.173
could in theory be convinced a simple hand wave from the right person and that's gone.

01:14:58.233 --> 01:15:11.838
But you brought up something twice in that in that description that that I really wanted to ask you about, which is, are there PCR tests that have what you would call a appropriate control?

01:15:11.858 --> 01:15:13.179
Oh, yeah.

01:15:14.304 --> 01:15:18.125
Yeah, there's a, I mean, there are, there are others tests out there that have internal controls.

01:15:18.145 --> 01:15:20.886
They go off the RNase P gene and that helps them tremendously.

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:27.467
But what we're not seeing the industry do is pull out all the live dead PCR technology, which has existed for probably a decade.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:29.608
It's been refined for a decade.

01:15:29.648 --> 01:15:31.268
This is- Was that an answer?

01:15:31.288 --> 01:15:36.570
I just asked an absolutely baller question.

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:37.450
Did he answer it?

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:42.331
I think we have to go back and you need to hear that again because he didn't answer it at all.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:51.331
And that's a pretty amazing admission because he could have said, yes, this one is, this one is, this one is.

01:15:51.391 --> 01:15:53.392
He's an expert in the PCR space.

01:15:53.532 --> 01:16:02.555
A year earlier on the Vance Crowe podcast, you would have assumed that he was keeping track of all the different EUA products that were in America, or at least in Massachusetts.

01:16:02.915 --> 01:16:07.056
And he could tell you that, well, there's three products that are being used in Massachusetts.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:11.478
And this one goes after this gene, this one goes after this gene, and then this one uses the, uh,

01:16:13.059 --> 01:16:15.641
the endogenous gene something, something, something.

01:16:16.341 --> 01:16:28.391
What he's talking about is, are there, I asked him, are there prime PCR tests that have the appropriate multiple primers, have the appropriate nested, sorry,

01:16:30.569 --> 01:16:48.117
multiple amplicons with nested primers or other controls to scale the PCR result to an endogenous gene like we do on the lab bench, which I'm familiar with already because I've done it in my little career before this.

01:16:48.918 --> 01:16:50.999
And so that's a real pertinent question.

01:16:51.079 --> 01:16:51.859
Does he answer it?

01:16:53.447 --> 01:17:00.249
Or does he bamboozle me with expertise that I'm just not capable of processing at this time?

01:17:00.269 --> 01:17:02.770
60-page addendum was attacking.

01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:04.210
So I don't know.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.351
I don't have much hope that clarifying that's going to end the pandemic.

01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:09.191
No, I agree.

01:17:09.211 --> 01:17:09.692
I agree.

01:17:09.732 --> 01:17:14.293
And so much of that is technical that for the vast majority of the people that

01:17:15.026 --> 01:17:18.908
Could in theory be convinced a simple hand wave from the right person and that's gone.

01:17:18.948 --> 01:17:32.575
But you brought up something twice in that in that description that that I really wanted to ask you about, which is, are there PCR tests that have what you would call a appropriate control?

01:17:32.595 --> 01:17:33.616
Yeah.

01:17:35.034 --> 01:17:38.857
Yeah, I mean, there are others tests out there that have internal controls.

01:17:38.897 --> 01:17:41.639
They go off the RNase P gene and that helps them tremendously.

01:17:41.979 --> 01:17:48.204
But what we're not seeing the industry do is pull out all the live dead PCR technology, which has existed for probably a decade.

01:17:48.825 --> 01:17:49.625
It's been refined.

01:17:49.826 --> 01:17:52.287
So live dead PCR technology.

01:17:52.388 --> 01:17:55.470
Think about that as an umbrella term and throwing that out there.

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:57.211
That doesn't exist.

01:17:58.552 --> 01:18:00.394
Live dead technology.

01:18:02.196 --> 01:18:05.061
You know, am I supposed to write that down in my notes and go Google that?

01:18:05.562 --> 01:18:05.782
I mean...

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:14.565
for a decade, this is the capability to get PCR to tell you what's infectious virus, which is not infectious virus.

01:18:14.805 --> 01:18:19.707
And they're not doing that for a very explicit reason, because that would have cut their revenues by an order of magnitude.

01:18:20.007 --> 01:18:33.872
I mean, if you look at just the- Think about how amazing that line of bullshit is, that they have this technology of live dead virus technology, but they're just not using it, because otherwise that would cut their profits in half.

01:18:37.682 --> 01:18:39.924
I mean, that is just, that is amazing.

01:18:40.564 --> 01:18:44.367
How long people are infections versus non-infections is either five to tenfold.

01:18:44.427 --> 01:18:48.210
And now, now they tell you don't get PCR tests for 90 days if you've been positive, right?

01:18:48.390 --> 01:19:06.024
Because you might still be positive from the last infection, but you're not- How many, how many academic molecular biologists in your imagination should actually, by their own experience, know that these tests are, one, one, inadequate, and two, that there's technology that already exists that would have been better anyway?

01:19:06.264 --> 01:19:06.424
What?

01:19:07.037 --> 01:19:08.538
How many people should really know that?

01:19:08.579 --> 01:19:09.960
Shouldn't there be thousands?

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:10.801
There should be.

01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:15.185
Yeah, I think anyone in the molecular biology space or genomic space knows that there's live dead tools out there.

01:19:15.205 --> 01:19:17.547
There's even stuff called live dead tools.

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:22.571
So you see the loop that he runs?

01:19:22.631 --> 01:19:24.533
He doesn't acknowledge what I just said.

01:19:25.874 --> 01:19:30.198
Which, if he was to be honest, would be like using multiple amplicons

01:19:31.352 --> 01:19:54.058
using a control amplicon from the human so you could scale it, maybe running in triplicate, maybe using nested primers, maybe picking a gene that is specific for a, nothing about how the actual PCR tests work, but repeating this live dead virus technology three times now.

01:19:56.298 --> 01:19:57.679
This is spectacular.

01:19:58.573 --> 01:20:00.954
and malevolence at its highest level here.

01:20:01.435 --> 01:20:03.035
And he's not happy about doing it.

01:20:03.075 --> 01:20:05.657
This is a precision work here that he's doing.

01:20:05.737 --> 01:20:08.698
Listen to it again, how he turns it around on me.

01:20:13.721 --> 01:20:18.103
Pull out all the live dead PCR technology, which has existed for probably a decade.

01:20:18.877 --> 01:20:18.957
it's

01:20:32.927 --> 01:20:36.868
But how long people are infections versus non-infections is either five to tenfold.

01:20:36.908 --> 01:20:40.709
And now they tell you don't get PCR tested for 90 days if you've been positive, right?

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:58.513
Because you might still be positive from the last infection, but you're not- How many academic molecular biologists in your imagination should actually, by their own experience, know that these tests are, one, inadequate, and two, that there's technology that already exists that would have been better anyway?

01:20:58.753 --> 01:20:58.893
What?

01:20:59.545 --> 01:21:01.047
How many people should really know that?

01:21:01.087 --> 01:21:02.468
Shouldn't there be thousands?

01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:03.309
There should be.

01:21:03.329 --> 01:21:07.694
Yeah, I think anyone in the molecular biology space or genomic space knows that there's live dead tools out there.

01:21:07.714 --> 01:21:12.620
There's even stuff published on SARS with this, that you can do live dead, you know, viability PCR on these things.

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:20.889
He just totally, I mean, that was, I don't know what you call that, but that is like the most amazing Jedi mind trick ever.

01:21:22.776 --> 01:21:29.223
because he didn't answer my question and he threw out this idea of live dead tools again, that I wasn't talking about live dead tools.

01:21:30.164 --> 01:21:43.759
I'm talking about using PCR in an objectively honest way where you apply the methodology to get high specificity and low error rates.

01:21:44.861 --> 01:21:51.064
And he's going nowhere near that, but wants you to talk about live dead tools, which of course live dead tools, what?

01:21:51.164 --> 01:22:05.751
It accepts the narrative of a novel virus, of RNA that can pandemic, of high fidelity sequencing tools and all the other stuff that his wealth and multi-generational potential, you know,

01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:09.121
membership in the elite class is based on.

01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:24.337
He's in the overclass right now because he has helped to bamboozle the world about what a gene is and how close they are to understanding all the genes and how genetics is so awesome.

01:22:27.011 --> 01:22:42.640
He is one of a few very primary movers that has been, for better or for worse, necessary to be exposed publicly in order to control a narrative that very few people are in a position to control.

01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:51.826
Only if you understand the illusion that is being sustained, the fidelity that is being exaggerated,

01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:55.789
and the methodologies that are being oversold.

01:22:56.409 --> 01:22:58.971
Are you capable of sustaining this illusion?

01:22:59.251 --> 01:23:02.754
That's why this guy's on so many podcasts for so many years.

01:23:03.737 --> 01:23:18.371
and not just keeping his head down working on pot, because he is part of the same team that Robert Malone is, the same team that Pierre Khoury joined in 2020, the same team that all of these people, I think, are on.

01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:25.238
It is a team that is designed to help these global powers take advantage of and

01:23:26.659 --> 01:23:39.999
minimize the consequences of this boomer generation on our economies and take advantage of the opportunity to create the illusion that RNA can pandemic so that they can enslave our children based on this mythology.

01:23:41.499 --> 01:24:05.434
and so that they can test us genetically, keep track of all of our data to correlate back with our genetics because they're sticking to this mythology that with enough data and enough measurements and enough precision, that eventually the deterministic world that is determined by our genes would be able to be identified, monitored, harnessed, and enhanced.

01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:10.654
It's all a lie, it's all bullshit, it's all never gonna work.

01:24:11.094 --> 01:24:22.303
But that's what these people have believed for years and have been using it as an excuse to be subversive and malevolent and egoistic and elitist and lie.

01:24:26.427 --> 01:24:29.910
And I just don't think there's any way that Kevin McKernan doesn't know.

01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:34.203
given what his track record is for the last five years.

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:35.484
There are people who don't know.

01:24:36.084 --> 01:24:39.867
It's possible that Pierre Khoury knows there's something but doesn't want to know.

01:24:40.347 --> 01:24:43.990
That's called the look-away doctrine in our system.

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:55.878
If you work for the DOD and you know that behind that curtain over there is something very hee-hee sketchy going on, you know, the look-away doctrine is how you don't know about it, so then you don't have to say anything.

01:24:55.918 --> 01:25:00.201
You know, sometimes they use the words plausible deniability, but it's even better than that.

01:25:01.485 --> 01:25:02.726
It's part of their system.

01:25:03.707 --> 01:25:06.008
It's why things need to be compartmentalized.

01:25:06.068 --> 01:25:08.430
It's why you only get read into what you need to know.

01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:11.712
And a lot of these people have only been read into what they need to know.

01:25:11.812 --> 01:25:15.214
Stick to ivermectin and you'll be fine, Pierre-Corey.

01:25:17.436 --> 01:25:20.858
Stick to VAERS and you'll be fine, Jessica Rose.

01:25:29.093 --> 01:25:31.814
So it's not like, I mean, if you just Google search it, you'd find it.

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:39.458
But the problem is that there's so many people they sweep up in that tail of PCR positivity when you're no longer infectious.

01:25:39.638 --> 01:25:43.379
And then that explodes into a contact map of everyone else you're in contact with.

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:50.363
So everybody's infectious, but because this PCR signal lingers for so long, there's a lot of false positives.

01:25:55.045 --> 01:25:57.146
Team Robert Malone working hard here.

01:25:58.322 --> 01:26:02.263
they're sweeping in an enormous number of clinically false positive leads.

01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:05.864
I mean, yes, technically the RNA is there, but they're not infectious.

01:26:06.184 --> 01:26:08.025
And so I call that a clinical false positive.

01:26:08.805 --> 01:26:14.506
And that's probably the bigger problem than all the, the Drosten things are more like analytical false positives, right?

01:26:14.567 --> 01:26:20.908
Like your primers hit the wrong shit, or you haven't proven to us that this doesn't hit other viruses like the flu.

01:26:21.588 --> 01:26:27.090
Those are things you can get in the weeds on with a molecular biologist, but I think the real thing is damaging society,

01:26:27.543 --> 01:26:36.194
is that the way PCR is currently calibrated, which is very rarely against virocells, and very rarely through a viability check, even

01:26:37.282 --> 01:26:41.486
When it's deployed, you have this long tail of people that are positive with RNA.

01:26:41.586 --> 01:26:42.827
What did he just say?

01:26:42.847 --> 01:26:53.737
Again, again, remember part of the shtick is to bamboozle you with, with information that you don't understand and make no effort at all to bring you to understand it.

01:26:54.478 --> 01:27:01.404
This should be the polar opposite of what you see in my progression and my progression of presenting these ideas.

01:27:01.444 --> 01:27:03.046
I haven't gotten more complicated.

01:27:04.238 --> 01:27:08.682
I haven't gotten an adding more details that make it even harder for you to see the big picture.

01:27:09.322 --> 01:27:15.728
I have been trimming this tree since I realized that I was lost in the forest for a long time.

01:27:15.788 --> 01:27:21.493
I've been trimming, trying to get to an elevator pitch that people can digest.

01:27:22.273 --> 01:27:24.115
This is not what's happening here.

01:27:24.675 --> 01:27:27.358
Through a viability check, even, even

01:27:28.422 --> 01:27:33.145
When it's deployed, you have this long tail of people that are positive with RNA that aren't infectious.

01:27:33.225 --> 01:27:36.587
They get sweeped in, they get contact traced, and all their contacts get PCR'd.

01:27:36.607 --> 01:27:46.532
It just creates this huge explosion of PCR activity that effectively just shuts down society.

01:27:46.933 --> 01:27:55.758
But in your space for botanicals and whatever, you have to have a pretty specific, I mean, you must have run

01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:05.418
quite a lot of checks to be sure that what you're testing for is really there and that you're not producing a test that... Well, I mean, that's what drives me nuts is these are clinical tests going on humans.

01:28:05.458 --> 01:28:07.739
We have more controls testing candidates.

01:28:08.419 --> 01:28:11.380
I mean, it's like there's an internal control on every one of our tests.

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:17.541
You have to have, in order for you to have a viral load, which is what everyone's talking about, you have to have two different CTs.

01:28:17.741 --> 01:28:18.641
You can't just have one.

01:28:18.821 --> 01:28:25.183
You need to have... So he's giving me an argument to make that these tests have to have two different

01:28:26.497 --> 01:28:28.498
amplicons, and that's not a good argument.

01:28:29.299 --> 01:28:32.721
Because I've made the argument since that one amplicon's not enough.

01:28:33.522 --> 01:28:38.605
That one amplicon would never be enough for nature, it would never be even enough for the Journal of Neuroscience.

01:28:38.645 --> 01:28:42.208
You gotta have more than one amplicon or you don't know for sure what you're looking at.

01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:49.662
And those amplicons should amplify at a similar level in order to validate one another.

01:28:50.463 --> 01:29:02.373
That's a different control than the gene that you expect to be there because you're swabbing a nasal cavity of a human, and this gene is always there, that you will then scale those two against.

01:29:04.975 --> 01:29:09.799
And he's not talking about the fact that these could be further specified by

01:29:12.489 --> 01:29:23.453
by using nested primers, which would further specify the sequence that was amplified, but none of these tests use nested primers, which is something that's almost bench standard in academics.

01:29:25.453 --> 01:29:26.714
Instead, he's talking about

01:29:27.808 --> 01:29:33.469
live dead technologies, which I still think are just really, stop lying.

01:29:33.589 --> 01:29:39.230
And then there's this stuff that he's saying now here, which is just absolutely extraordinary.

01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:50.433
One amplicon for the test and one amplicon in control is not the solving of the problem, but that's what he's telling me right here.

01:29:50.693 --> 01:29:57.294
For botanicals and whatever, you have to have a pretty specific, I mean, you must've run

01:29:58.231 --> 01:30:03.357
quite a lot of checks to be sure that what you're testing for is really there and that you're not producing a test.

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:06.961
I mean, that's what drives me nuts is these are clinical tests going on humans.

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:09.304
We have more controls testing candidates.

01:30:09.965 --> 01:30:12.888
I mean, there's an internal control on every one of our tests.

01:30:12.968 --> 01:30:17.594
You have to have, in order for you to have a viral load, which is what everyone's talking about, you have to have

01:30:18.123 --> 01:30:19.083
two different CTs.

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:20.183
You can't just have one.

01:30:20.343 --> 01:30:23.004
You need to have the host CT, and you need to have the virus CT.

01:30:23.044 --> 01:30:24.924
So you have a ratio of virus to host.

01:30:25.044 --> 01:30:27.665
When you just skip the host, you have no clue what that number means.

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:34.967
There's been papers published showing there's about a 10,000 fold variance, 1,000, 10,000, it's a paper called DADU, in swabbing your nose.

01:30:35.487 --> 01:30:37.567
That's the variance in the number of cells you can have.

01:30:37.587 --> 01:30:39.287
Can you do that all in the same tube then?

01:30:39.407 --> 01:30:41.008
Or do you have two separate samples?

01:30:41.868 --> 01:30:46.309
Yeah, you put primers in there that have fluorophores that go off in different columns.

01:30:47.259 --> 01:30:52.201
And there are some PCR kits that do this in the coronavirus space, so I don't mean to disparage.

01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:56.563
And so he said you do that with primers that have fluorophores of different colors.

01:30:56.703 --> 01:31:13.329
So essentially, you are trusting the manufacturer of the PCR test to make primers that won't go together and make positive, or what will go only to become fluorescent when amplifying these, you see?

01:31:16.201 --> 01:31:21.751
So he's not really telling us the truth here because all the primers don't have fluorescence.

01:31:30.219 --> 01:31:33.320
Well, maybe in some tests they do, but it doesn't matter.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:41.944
What you're hearing here is again, a person saying and confirming that PCR tests could be used to track a virus.

01:31:41.984 --> 01:31:55.969
He's saying that there is a virus obviously to track, but there are these weird aspects of the signal that make it easy to misconstrue as being dangerous when it's not dangerous and miss it when it is dangerous or something like that.

01:31:58.928 --> 01:32:00.249
all of them and call them all Drosten.

01:32:00.309 --> 01:32:09.378
But the ones in the human space, they measure RNAs P, which is a gene that's human, and they compare that CT value to the CT value you get from the virus.

01:32:09.478 --> 01:32:12.761
Now you have a numerator and a denominator, and you can call a viral load.

01:32:12.801 --> 01:32:19.968
And according to the Mikey guidelines that Bust and Drosten and self-authored spelled this out very clearly, you don't have a viral load without two numbers.

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:21.409
you need both.

01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:28.375
But there is a lot of PCR out there in the coronavirus space where they're just skipping ignoring the internal control and just saying if we get any signal out to 30.

01:32:28.435 --> 01:32:40.306
And so now the other thing to realize is is the the disparity here that even if you believe their their illusion of viruses when they look at these RNA constructs in vitro

01:32:41.227 --> 01:33:00.995
What they find are is that certain subgenomic RNAs are orders of magnitude more abundant than the full genome sequence and more abundant than many of the most crucial proteins that are most crucially conserved, like the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the helicase and the N-protein.

01:33:02.079 --> 01:33:05.680
Although you do make quite a bit of N and E, because N is necessary to wrap up.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:13.342
And in fact, Ralph Baric already showed that just with the N protein alone, you already get viral particle production.

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:20.264
And in fact, if you go to my sub stack that everybody seems to ignore, where I talk about that, that

01:33:21.801 --> 01:33:46.549
incomplete bibliography, you can see that I've gathered a whole bunch of random articles out of the virology literature where every one of these articles that's using a synthetic RNA as a starting point to generate their viral particles also co-transfects with the N-protein RNA alone, because as they say in their own methodologies, we get a lot more particles if we do it this way.

01:33:48.717 --> 01:33:53.209
And so they've already known for a very long time that cells in culture can package RNA.

01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:55.455
They've already known how to entice them to do it.

01:33:56.530 --> 01:34:12.258
because it's a natural processes that cells do in all different contexts that we are wholly unaware of because we haven't been paying attention to it because they have told us for the last 40 years that everything that you isolate in this fraction in a sucrose gradient is exclusively viruses.

01:34:12.858 --> 01:34:25.425
That's what meadow biota told us, that's what David Baltimore tells us, that's what Ralph, sorry, Ralph Baric would tell us, that's what Vincent Rack and Yellow would tell you, that they all would tell you that.

01:34:26.212 --> 01:34:40.130
And this guy just told you that he was part of a whole series of technologies that was involved in that very thing, identifying viruses and infractions that were isolated.

01:34:41.641 --> 01:34:48.342
So we are really talking about the sustaining of an illusion of molecular biology.

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:51.103
It's an illusion of fidelity.

01:34:51.943 --> 01:34:55.004
It's an illusion of simplification.

01:34:55.164 --> 01:35:06.026
It's an illusion of command over a system that they don't have, a breadth of understanding that they do not have.

01:35:06.106 --> 01:35:08.567
And it's all based on an elaborate

01:35:09.562 --> 01:35:20.710
elaborate collection of assumptions which ultimately goes all the way back to the idea that life on earth is just physics and chemistry that we haven't managed to delineate yet.

01:35:21.671 --> 01:35:38.063
We haven't managed to describe all of the laws and processes that are involved, but essentially the pattern integrity that is us is just explainable by a very wonderful combination of physics and chemistry, and that is the seductive lie

01:35:39.576 --> 01:35:44.979
that all of these people in one way or another are participating in, believing in, assuming to exist.

01:35:45.019 --> 01:35:46.419
It's an atheist kind of thing.

01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:58.244
And you can disguise that as an appreciation for the universe, an appreciation for creation, an appreciation for the sun, an appreciation for nature, an appreciation for Gaia.

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:06.975
But then you're never acknowledging that this perfection could have never come into existence without a creator.

01:36:07.016 --> 01:36:12.081
And you're never humbly submitting yourself to the will of the creator then.

01:36:12.836 --> 01:36:27.044
You're inevitably going to be tricked into believing that we as a species have risen to have lordship and stewardship over creation in a way that we are not, no, supposed to take.

01:36:28.405 --> 01:36:29.645
Stewardship's the right word.

01:36:29.745 --> 01:36:30.906
Lordship's the wrong word.

01:36:31.686 --> 01:36:34.148
We are supposed to be the gardeners of the earth.

01:36:35.182 --> 01:36:46.020
We were given a beautiful gift that we are instead treating as if it's something that we need to remake in our own image or some bullshit like that.

01:36:47.042 --> 01:37:12.029
And this is really dangerous because all of these people, like it or not, are contributing to this collective consciousness, this noosphere that is being amplified on social media to get everybody to believe that we're going to a continuous gender, multiracial, global community with a unity religion and a unity party.

01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:14.910
And our kids are gonna love it.

01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:35.478
And that's the UN, that's the City of London, that's the Vatican, that's Washington DC, and all these weirdos of the Human Genome Project, and the CEBA Foundation, and Gavi, and the UN, they're everywhere.

01:37:39.275 --> 01:37:43.179
And they're all not fighting for America's grandchildren.

01:37:43.219 --> 01:37:47.764
And that's all I can fight for because my kids live on this dirt.

01:37:48.284 --> 01:38:00.297
So I, by definition, it's totally okay for me to want this dirt to be free, to want this dirt to be prosperous, to want this community and this land to be free.

01:38:02.662 --> 01:38:05.023
I don't know what the rest of you can do in the world.

01:38:05.083 --> 01:38:06.703
I know you're all in the same trap.

01:38:06.843 --> 01:38:11.425
I know that you're all falling for the same gag because we're all falling for the same gag.

01:38:11.465 --> 01:38:15.707
Our children are all being offered the same poison fruit.

01:38:17.607 --> 01:38:20.908
It's all different forms and different shapes, but it's all the same.

01:38:20.988 --> 01:38:21.949
It's all the same.

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:25.430
And Russell Brand and this guy are all the same.

01:38:27.791 --> 01:38:29.932
And now that I see it, and...

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:40.164
As clearly as I think I do, it also feels very, very, it's empowering because I know that we can fight this.

01:38:40.644 --> 01:38:42.725
I know that we can teach our children to see it.

01:38:42.845 --> 01:38:45.207
I know that we can teach our family and friends to see it.

01:38:45.647 --> 01:38:48.809
And I know the personal attacks can end.

01:38:48.969 --> 01:38:58.335
I feel bad for the people that are helping this along because I don't think that any of them got into this thinking that they were going to be involved in something like this.

01:38:59.628 --> 01:39:05.913
I don't think Kevin McKernan's dad knew that getting into microarray of technology was contributing to these ideas.

01:39:06.013 --> 01:39:11.237
I don't think Kevin McKernan knows that all of his work has contributed to these ideas.

01:39:11.297 --> 01:39:19.344
He might know where these exaggerations are taking place, where these assumptions are allowed to sit.

01:39:20.825 --> 01:39:23.307
But in the end, it's a look-away doctrine thing.

01:39:24.727 --> 01:39:31.030
They know only as much as they need to know and they keep everything else out of their mind because this is how it goes.

01:39:32.831 --> 01:39:42.235
Otherwise, if they accept what they are a part of and how this is going, then inevitably their whole existence will be put into question.

01:39:44.008 --> 01:40:01.282
And so if one department of the university, like the sociology department, is just going full rainbow trans nonsense, and the trans studies department is getting millions of dollars in grants, the biology department is not going to say anything.

01:40:07.008 --> 01:40:14.238
The Department of Neurobiology isn't going to say anything about what transgender might be in certain cases.

01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:21.708
None of those biologists are going to stand up to the social sciences that are in the same university because they

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:25.350
engage in the same kind of look-away doctrine.

01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:34.733
It's just that behind the curtain is not a bunch of people being tortured for intelligence, it's a bunch of students being taught things that they know are wrong.

01:40:35.173 --> 01:40:42.115
They're not going to help those students, but them taking their tuition is as important as them bringing in grant money.

01:40:43.789 --> 01:40:49.635
And they've got to keep their head down in order for that to be a successful venture and for them not to catch any flack.

01:40:50.075 --> 01:40:56.862
And so the chemistry department and the biology department and the psychology department shut up about that, those departments and vice versa.

01:40:58.049 --> 01:41:17.780
And that's no different than a guy from the Human Genome Project shutting up about what the Human Genome Project has become and not become and how the NIH and the NIAID and all of these large funding corporations are using the illusion that was created by the exaggeration of the Human Genome Project to forward all of their ideas.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.722
He just doesn't wanna lose what he has.

01:41:22.963 --> 01:41:25.465
And so when they ask him to help out, he does it.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.203
Very reluctantly and made him very angry by the end of this this the year after this.

01:41:32.683 --> 01:41:51.334
He was fed up with me and My chemtrail retarded ideas Seven positive, right and they will fuse to sequence anything I think the CDC only sequences stuff below 28 and I see how the labs doing it below 32 and

01:41:52.125 --> 01:41:55.146
So they don't really have sequence validation on the stuff past 32.

01:41:55.226 --> 01:41:56.246
All that stuff could be noise.

01:41:56.326 --> 01:41:57.946
It could be influenza.

01:41:58.026 --> 01:41:59.167
It could be other coronaviruses.

01:41:59.187 --> 01:41:59.547
We don't know.

01:41:59.567 --> 01:42:00.767
They're not sequencing that stuff.

01:42:02.727 --> 01:42:03.108
I see.

01:42:03.888 --> 01:42:07.589
And that 32 number kind of lines up with probably what you've seen from Didier Riel's lab.

01:42:09.249 --> 01:42:13.310
The paper out of, I think it was Jessica Jabbar,

01:42:13.917 --> 01:42:17.298
Didier Real from France was just plugged in.

01:42:17.338 --> 01:42:21.720
He was the guy who kind of seeded the hydrochloroquine as it might have worked.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:22.200
I don't know.

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.301
I may have no readage apart.

01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:31.963
She did this work where they calibrated PCR on Vero cells to show what CT they stopped performing PFUs.

01:42:32.003 --> 01:42:34.044
And you should know Vero cells are hyper

01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:36.199
they're very sensitive to this virus.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:57.426
If you compare... But one of the things that's interesting that Mark and I have been talking about behind the scenes is that even PCR from the perspective of qPCR, he's talking about calibrating quantitative PCR so that the cycle count where the reaction goes exponential is a useful number.

01:42:58.386 --> 01:43:00.447
So you can use PCR in multiple ways.

01:43:00.547 --> 01:43:02.929
One of the ways to use PCR is a yes or no.

01:43:03.569 --> 01:43:12.634
Either the PCR amplifies an amplicon and then you say yes it's there or you run it for 45 cycles and nothing amplifies and then you say no it's not there.

01:43:13.094 --> 01:43:22.359
And then there's another way to use PCR where you know it's there or you're assuming it's there and then you take the data from when the exponential

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:31.197
Curve sets in you take that as an indication of some kind of quantity because again if there was less

01:43:32.705 --> 01:43:33.645
And this is going to be wrong.

01:43:33.685 --> 01:43:34.726
It should have been this way, I guess.

01:43:34.786 --> 01:43:37.847
If there was less, then that curve would be over here.

01:43:37.867 --> 01:43:40.408
And it would amplify in, or sorry, over here.

01:43:40.448 --> 01:43:44.390
And it would be amplifying at a much higher cycle count, like at 40.

01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:47.211
And if it was more abundant, it would amplify at 30.

01:43:47.691 --> 01:43:50.972
And if it was more abundant, it would amplify at 20 cycles.

01:43:51.752 --> 01:43:56.934
And so what he's talking about is a paper where they grew virus in Vero6 cells.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:16.586
and they claimed to know how much virus they were growing and then they PCR'd it up to show or calibrate what kinds of viral numbers in their prep are equivalent to what cycle count in PCR in a nasal prep.

01:44:17.614 --> 01:44:29.663
Which of course, if there's a background that any of these tests are detecting, then this whole idea is moot because there's a background signal and you're pretending that there isn't.

01:44:29.783 --> 01:44:35.567
And so when you swab and you find the background signal, you're saying that it's something novel when it's a background signal.

01:44:36.388 --> 01:44:45.735
And so again, we're not explaining that at all, but instead reinforcing a narrative that he sees that I have come to understand as evidence of a novel virus.

01:44:47.082 --> 01:44:48.244
and trying to understand it.

01:44:56.449 --> 01:44:58.871
Vero cells really make a lot of PFUs.

01:44:58.891 --> 01:45:01.274
And so they found the number around 33 with their assay.

01:45:01.374 --> 01:45:10.842
And so now I'm supposed to learn all the different cell types and how much virus they can make, and that should be in my new model of how I understand things.

01:45:10.922 --> 01:45:12.283
It's a lot of noise.

01:45:13.104 --> 01:45:16.968
It's a lot of meaningless details that have no real message here.

01:45:17.028 --> 01:45:19.670
I still don't really know what his message is.

01:45:21.087 --> 01:45:24.090
There's, there's a lot getting called above and beyond 32.

01:45:24.671 --> 01:45:26.033
What is, what is PFU?

01:45:26.093 --> 01:45:27.374
Is that like per?

01:45:27.935 --> 01:45:32.940
Oh, PFU is a platform units, um, like, like colony forming units, these colonies back here, you can.

01:45:33.121 --> 01:45:36.544
Plaque forming units, but that's talking about viruses.

01:45:36.604 --> 01:45:40.949
This is bacteria behind him and using bacteria and counting plaque.

01:45:41.650 --> 01:46:07.458
forming units was where the plaque forming unit thing came from in virology and he is equating the two as being equivalent and equal and I think one of the things that the no virus people like Mark Bailey have established very well is that the plaque assay is really nonsense and and quite frighteningly so and that's indeed

01:46:08.126 --> 01:46:10.508
it's important that he reinforced that here.

01:46:10.988 --> 01:46:11.328
Okay.

01:46:11.609 --> 01:46:13.370
You count those, each one of those is a CFU.

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:19.054
With, with viruses, you make a lot of cells and then the plaques form where all the cells are dying.

01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:19.835
I see.

01:46:19.875 --> 01:46:22.797
Those are, those are each individual virions that seeded that death.

01:46:23.057 --> 01:46:24.878
And so you count the plaque forming units.

01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:36.227
And so he reiterates or, or, or recites the assumption that's made in the plaque forming assay in virology, but it's not the same as this.

01:46:37.202 --> 01:46:38.864
It is not the equivalent of this.

01:46:39.605 --> 01:46:45.133
In the viral plaque forming assay, you're looking for cytopathic effects in a cell culture.

01:46:45.193 --> 01:46:46.896
Here, you're looking for bacterial growth.

01:46:49.128 --> 01:46:55.392
It's really kind of funny, actually, when you see it now, that he's walking me right into it.

01:46:56.513 --> 01:47:00.255
And the no-virus people are already, by this time, very much on it.

01:47:00.895 --> 01:47:07.019
And they've already succinctly described why these plaque assays are bunk.

01:47:09.634 --> 01:47:10.955
And it's, it's, it's amazing.

01:47:11.015 --> 01:47:13.938
I see this now so clearly, it's, it's kind of scary.

01:47:14.278 --> 01:47:14.638
Instead.

01:47:15.779 --> 01:47:24.966
And so you measure a PFU curve and calibrate it to a CT level, and then you have a sense of, okay, this assay is picking up viability out at a certain time point.

01:47:25.447 --> 01:47:25.767
I see.

01:47:26.267 --> 01:47:27.108
Certain CT values.

01:47:27.188 --> 01:47:32.012
I understand that so much better now than I've read it probably 50 times and I didn't really fully understand it.

01:47:32.032 --> 01:47:32.472
That's funny.

01:47:33.273 --> 01:47:33.493
Yeah.

01:47:34.795 --> 01:47:36.116
But I don't do viruses, right?

01:47:36.156 --> 01:47:41.882
I mean, just trying to read into this immunology and so much of it just doesn't make congruent sense.

01:47:41.942 --> 01:47:44.085
I mean, I can't tell you all the details.

01:47:44.765 --> 01:47:47.848
And that's why it's really interesting to talk to you.

01:47:47.929 --> 01:47:54.055
So the next thing that, from a general biologist perspective, has been on my mind for a long time is the idea that

01:47:54.853 --> 01:48:10.604
Moderna and Pfizer have told us that they have this sequence and they can make many good copies of it and then put it in our cells and they'll make very many good copies of a protein that will harmlessly provoke an immune response that we can rely on in the future.

01:48:10.644 --> 01:48:19.851
And a lot of that seems odd, but the most odd of it was this calling it vaccination instead of transfection.

01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:23.974
And I always understood transfection as being something that

01:48:24.813 --> 01:48:39.874
I mean, when we did it to our mice, it was an endpoint after five or six weeks of having transfected a particular, let's say optogenetic protein in the brain, that area of the brain is also going to be a little bit unhappy.

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.280
Yeah.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:40.780
Unhappy.

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:41.661
Let's say it like that.

01:48:41.721 --> 01:48:41.981
Yes.

01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:42.421
Yeah.

01:48:42.501 --> 01:48:46.443
If you overdo it with the lipid nanoparticles, they become toxic to the cells.

01:48:46.463 --> 01:48:51.205
So you can't, usually you have to go in at low MLI, low multiplicity of infection in order for you to get.

01:48:51.386 --> 01:48:55.628
So there he goes throwing out another MLI, multiplicity of infection.

01:48:55.688 --> 01:48:55.888
I mean,

01:48:56.468 --> 01:49:06.457
He's just trying to bamboozle, just trying to make sure that no matter which way I move in the paint, he boxes me out and makes sure that I understand that the paint is his territory.

01:49:06.498 --> 01:49:07.859
I'm not allowed to post up there.

01:49:07.899 --> 01:49:10.982
You can cut through, but if you cut through, you're going to pay the price.

01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:12.243
You're going to kick a forearm.

01:49:12.703 --> 01:49:13.784
That's what he's doing here.

01:49:13.884 --> 01:49:14.966
Law will listen to it.

01:49:15.626 --> 01:49:16.986
It's impressive like that.

01:49:17.066 --> 01:49:17.286
Yes.

01:49:17.546 --> 01:49:17.746
Yeah.

01:49:17.846 --> 01:49:21.527
If you overdo it with the lipid nanoparticles, it becomes toxic to the cells.

01:49:21.627 --> 01:49:24.548
So you can't, usually you have to go into low MOI, low.

01:49:24.668 --> 01:49:28.008
So the lipid nanoparticles are toxic to the cells too.

01:49:28.088 --> 01:49:32.809
So you go into a low concentration so that they don't really get you see that wow.

01:49:32.869 --> 01:49:33.770
Lipid nanoparticles.

01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:38.631
Supposed to be an infection in order for you to get, um, those transfection systems to behave.

01:49:38.671 --> 01:49:40.711
I've done, I've done some of the infection in the,

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.542
I can't say this about the lipid nanoparticles they're using because they've modified them, but the ones that we typically use.

01:49:46.762 --> 01:49:51.363
Oh, they modify the lipid nanoparticles, so I have no idea if they're any good.

01:49:51.423 --> 01:49:52.384
I assume they're better.

01:49:52.444 --> 01:49:56.225
I mean, Robert Malone assumed they were better because Peter Cullis told him they were better.

01:49:56.265 --> 01:49:57.665
That's why he took the shot.

01:49:57.705 --> 01:50:07.929
In retrospect, if Peter Cullis wouldn't have lied to him, he would have never taken the shot in the first place and never would have forgot his vaccine card when he went to Rome with Stephen Hadfield.

01:50:08.029 --> 01:50:09.049
I mean, wow.

01:50:12.504 --> 01:50:13.565
This is amazing.

01:50:13.865 --> 01:50:19.149
Using with betragen is surest way to destroy your cell lines is to put too much of it in there.

01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:23.512
So I'm very skeptical of what they've claimed.

01:50:23.552 --> 01:50:29.936
They've claimed they have these mRNAs that get transfected and then that they make this perfect spike protein.

01:50:29.996 --> 01:50:30.857
They've never shown that.

01:50:31.137 --> 01:50:34.880
I mean, unless your audience can find, I really hope someone can't prove me wrong here because I've been

01:50:35.302 --> 01:50:38.523
There's now like so many millions of papers of SARS-CoV-2 out there.

01:50:38.543 --> 01:50:40.904
It's very hard to dig through the literature and find exactly.

01:50:40.924 --> 01:50:41.905
Oh, I've been looking.

01:50:42.645 --> 01:50:44.006
So that's pretty convenient, right?

01:50:44.046 --> 01:50:45.246
There's just so many papers.

01:50:45.326 --> 01:50:46.226
I can't sort through it.

01:50:46.266 --> 01:50:53.589
It's like, you know, it's possible maybe that Charles Rixey read a thousand papers in the first two years and he read all the wrong ones.

01:50:53.749 --> 01:50:55.430
I mean, so many papers.

01:50:55.930 --> 01:50:57.471
Yeah, but I do not find...

01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:06.083
I've been looking for if anyone has found like dose, you know, if they have some range of what they expect to go into circulation or what they expect to be produced.

01:51:07.944 --> 01:51:24.911
And the other thing that you were, you've written a paper about recently is the, the obvious unknown of post-translational modification and then how the protein itself is folded, given the fact that it's not the actual sequence they've, all the sequence in such a way.

01:51:26.089 --> 01:51:26.309
Yeah.

01:51:26.349 --> 01:51:31.934
So that's, that is, um, I think that's criminal in that it's technically a pro drug, right?

01:51:32.014 --> 01:51:42.822
Because you're, you're giving us a sequence that you're transfecting into cells and you're asking yourselves to make the final drug without ever having to declare what the final drug is or prove the fidelity of making that final drug.

01:51:43.442 --> 01:51:44.824
They got away with a hall pass.

01:51:44.924 --> 01:51:48.106
So he says that it's a pro drug and that means it's criminal.

01:51:48.166 --> 01:51:49.988
That's an interesting statement to make.

01:51:50.128 --> 01:51:51.629
I don't think he makes that anymore.

01:51:53.055 --> 01:51:54.516
I don't think he's saying that anymore.

01:51:54.536 --> 01:51:57.218
I don't think he said that to Vance Crowe, for example.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.881
Three times he was on Vance Crowe.

01:52:01.921 --> 01:52:02.882
I don't think he said it.

01:52:03.582 --> 01:52:05.183
Just to let you know, that's the truth there.

01:52:07.332 --> 01:52:14.196
Like if this were some other drug that was a pro drug that your liver modified and turned into another drug, you'd have to have all these P450 studies, you'd have to have those three.

01:52:14.216 --> 01:52:16.438
That's a really wonderful way to explain it.

01:52:16.458 --> 01:52:32.368
I think a lot of people will, even some nurses and stuff would understand that if you point out that if this was a pro drug that had to go through the liver first, then you would have so many more checks and balances and tests and trials that would have needed to be done on all stages of that.

01:52:33.404 --> 01:52:35.089
You'd have to prove what the final drug is.

01:52:36.332 --> 01:52:40.444
They have no evidence that they're making a spike protein off of this MR.

01:52:41.482 --> 01:52:44.024
I mean, they have, they have a couple, I shouldn't say no evidence.

01:52:44.064 --> 01:52:48.006
There's papers out there where they take these things and they express them in other posts.

01:52:48.407 --> 01:52:48.807
Right.

01:52:48.907 --> 01:52:51.729
And I've seen a couple of 3D, you know, crystal structures of them.

01:52:51.769 --> 01:52:53.710
They've all used modifications of it.

01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:57.572
Like they put a twin strap on one end so they can purify these and crystallize them.

01:52:57.593 --> 01:53:00.915
Or they're not, they're not using the pseudo-uridine template.

01:53:00.935 --> 01:53:04.377
Sometimes they're putting them in DNA vectors and getting them to express, you know, so.

01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:17.119
The actual mRNA getting injected into people and what actual peptide sequences that those mRNAs manufacture in cells, I can't find literature on.

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:25.907
Some people sent me material that were from Pfizer's disclosures, I think, to some European government agencies, which I can forward to you if you want to link into this chat.

01:53:26.639 --> 01:53:31.581
Um, but, uh, they basically show that they have all types of problems in multiple different bands when they go.

01:53:31.621 --> 01:53:36.983
I just imagine that this guy was able to present in front of the Senate and probably could have talked as long as he wanted to.

01:53:37.023 --> 01:53:38.164
And he didn't say any of this.

01:53:39.124 --> 01:53:42.926
There's DNA contamination and he's not promoting me.

01:53:42.986 --> 01:53:48.268
He's promoting Buckhalter who says that the DNA was fine for his grandparents, just maybe not for his daughter.

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:52.670
And he's being promoted by CHD about the DNA.

01:53:54.158 --> 01:53:58.702
He's interviewed by Mary Holland and Brian Hooker about the DNA.

01:54:00.243 --> 01:54:11.092
And so now we're not talking anymore about whether the spike protein is produced or what these small RNA fragments that are also in there will produce or what these chemical alterations will do.

01:54:11.793 --> 01:54:15.776
None of those issues are being spoken about at all by this guy.

01:54:15.857 --> 01:54:19.380
But in this interview, he's going to make sure that I hear enough of them

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:40.372
and get confused by enough false leads that I'll be lost for another couple years and he can and Robert Malone can and Brett Weinstein can slowly but surely be elevated on X and other platforms and slowly elevated in front of people on social media to absorb all of the useful patriots in America.

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:43.535
instead of promoting them.

01:54:43.956 --> 01:54:51.019
And that's why Steve Kirsch and Kevin McKernan are best buddies.

01:54:51.059 --> 01:54:56.721
That's why Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose are taking pictures together in foreign countries.

01:54:58.802 --> 01:55:04.284
That's why Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan are

01:55:05.416 --> 01:55:10.000
They have to be part of the same group of narrative controllers.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:22.750
That's why Jessica Rose is first and foremost a virologist, who instead of talking about the virus has been talking about VAERS for the first year and a half, and publishing with

01:55:23.334 --> 01:55:30.678
Peter McCullough because, you know, a Canadian, Israeli, and a guy from Texas, I mean, what other combination can you imagine?

01:55:30.698 --> 01:55:38.543
There's nobody in Texas who could do what Jessica Rose did in that cardiology paper with Peter McCullough.

01:55:38.563 --> 01:55:47.928
I'm sure there was nobody else in Texas who could have done that, even though four of the largest medical center, research medical centers in the world are in Texas.

01:55:48.008 --> 01:55:51.650
Like, I'm sure nobody else could have helped with that.

01:55:51.710 --> 01:55:52.651
That had to be Jessica.

01:55:53.423 --> 01:56:03.548
and try to express these in vitro, they get all types of fragmentation that occurs, and they don't know if that's fragmentation of the virus or stall points in translation, and the banding patterns they see on gels are smears.

01:56:04.088 --> 01:56:09.750
And there's questions on them having to clarify, why are those smears not the right size, the anticipated size?

01:56:10.271 --> 01:56:12.852
And that's all we can see from some of the regulatory disclosures.

01:56:12.912 --> 01:56:20.635
So- So there is already him saying it's contaminated, it's not pure, there's no way to justify it, it's a pro-drug.

01:56:20.695 --> 01:56:21.816
All these things are there,

01:56:24.065 --> 01:56:27.267
So why when he gets in front of the Senate, doesn't he start with this?

01:56:28.188 --> 01:56:30.709
It wouldn't have worked because it was transfection.

01:56:30.809 --> 01:56:36.953
We already knew how this worked because at the same time, he's saying that it's the lipid nanoparticles that does, that hurts.

01:56:37.193 --> 01:56:49.661
And that the concentration, he just said that like five minutes ago, that the concentration of the lipid nanoparticle, nobody really knows these are new ones, but the old ones, you have to avoid a certain level of multiplicity of infection or something.

01:56:49.701 --> 01:56:52.863
He said, he is bullshitting me.

01:57:00.501 --> 01:57:04.104
It's remarkable in retrospect how much he's bullshitting me.

01:57:05.846 --> 01:57:06.286
It hurts.

01:57:08.108 --> 01:57:19.078
What has me worried about what they did is they took a sequence that was already code unoptimized by a virus adapted to its host and decided to make it different.

01:57:20.519 --> 01:57:24.983
They took a sequence that was already adapted to its host.

01:57:25.704 --> 01:57:26.364
Stop lying!

01:57:28.931 --> 01:57:31.596
And they code on optimized it again.

01:57:31.616 --> 01:57:34.863
I mean.

01:57:35.925 --> 01:57:53.473
The number of leads, the number of ideas, the number of hamster wheels that this, it's like, have you ever seen that old video game, Spy Hunter, and you can drop a smoke screen or you can drop CalTrips behind you and pop the tires of the cars that are chasing you?

01:57:54.114 --> 01:57:56.535
This guy is dropping CalTrips like crazy.

01:57:56.775 --> 01:57:58.016
I can't barely dodge them.

01:58:00.937 --> 01:58:01.637
It is nuts.

01:58:01.997 --> 01:58:05.119
We know this is now the most toxic protein probably in virus, right?

01:58:05.748 --> 01:58:20.813
So if a virus has evolved a certain codon structure for a toxic peptide, the most toxic peptide of the virus, can we at least agree that this is the most toxic protein in the virus?

01:58:26.455 --> 01:58:29.936
It probably has got the codon structure right.

01:58:30.716 --> 01:58:35.358
And that it needs to make sure it's not lethal to the host so it can still survive transmission.

01:58:36.608 --> 01:58:42.169
Look at me, look at me grinding there, just trying to, oh my gosh, this guy is so smart.

01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:44.390
Oh my gosh, I can barely keep up.

01:58:44.730 --> 01:58:46.550
Oh my gosh, this guy is amazing.

01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:51.232
Supercharging this by codon optimizing it so it would express even more in human.

01:58:51.452 --> 01:58:56.633
I mean, this is what, I'm not, I think I do, whenever you want to hyper express a protein, this is just what we do.

01:58:56.653 --> 01:59:03.034
We codon optimize it, we put it behind a really heavy promoter, toss it into some cells that are gonna be sacrificial and just jack the expression of it up.

01:59:03.614 --> 01:59:05.555
But you're doing this in cells you know you're gonna kill.

01:59:07.267 --> 01:59:09.968
and then purify as much of the damn protein as you can.

01:59:10.008 --> 01:59:12.348
That's not necessarily what you need to do to dose humans.

01:59:12.829 --> 01:59:14.909
That's actually how you make biologics.

01:59:14.949 --> 01:59:16.229
So this is not old tech.

01:59:16.269 --> 01:59:18.030
They didn't need to retool anything.

01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:24.011
Just needed to wash the vats out, rinse the hoses, maybe replace some of the hoses, but that's it.

01:59:26.352 --> 01:59:27.732
We're there, ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:28.372 --> 01:59:29.453
The curtain has dropped.

01:59:29.813 --> 01:59:34.254
You shouldn't be necessarily aiming for maximum expression because when an RNA gets into a cell,

01:59:34.761 --> 01:59:40.685
and starts making maximum expression, all types of triggers go off on the interferon system, being like, this could be cancerous.

01:59:40.745 --> 01:59:41.826
Like, what the hell's going on here?

01:59:42.306 --> 01:59:45.508
You could get apoptosis because you're expressing way too much protein in a particular cell.

01:59:45.969 --> 01:59:48.190
So they did a lot of things to jack up the expression.

01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:50.952
They put a beta-globin promoter on there, which is a pretty aggressive promoter.

01:59:51.532 --> 01:59:55.355
They then codon optimized it, which didn't need to be done, in my opinion.

01:59:55.814 --> 01:59:57.997
And that creates all types of other problems.

01:59:58.037 --> 02:00:03.705
When you codon optimize it, you don't know that the translation is going to go at the same speed anymore.

02:00:04.385 --> 02:00:07.610
It may slow down due to all types of knots in the RNA you've created by doing this.

02:00:08.032 --> 02:00:11.453
like there are quadruplex G structures now that we know in the RNA.

02:00:11.653 --> 02:00:14.113
Quadruplex G structures.

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:16.114
I was on that for about four months.

02:00:16.154 --> 02:00:24.035
That was amazing because the, the RNA has a three-dimensional structure and by codon optimizing, we change the three-dimensional structure.

02:00:24.075 --> 02:00:29.316
So it changes the speed and the, the tempo with which it's translated and therefore the folding.

02:00:29.396 --> 02:00:29.816
Wow.

02:00:30.216 --> 02:00:34.357
Much more frequent in the messenger RNAs than they are in the actual natural virus.

02:00:34.687 --> 02:00:36.929
Does that make error rate go up then too, or?

02:00:37.009 --> 02:00:38.650
It makes translation error go up.

02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:45.475
It also attracts other types of regulatory proteins to the molecules because quadriplex G structures look like telomeres.

02:00:45.815 --> 02:00:47.876
And so telomeres are involved in sensitive.

02:00:48.777 --> 02:00:50.378
Uh, if you, yeah, if you're looking at telomeres.

02:00:50.458 --> 02:00:51.339
Telomeres.

02:00:51.499 --> 02:00:52.259
Oh my gosh.

02:00:52.319 --> 02:00:53.921
Guess who's all about telomeres.

02:00:53.961 --> 02:00:57.263
That's Brett Weinstein's, you know, that's his wheelhouse.

02:00:57.303 --> 02:01:04.388
That's his only real discovery that his brother says is one of the most extraordinary discoveries in modern biology.

02:01:08.105 --> 02:01:09.706
That is spectacular.

02:01:09.766 --> 02:01:12.147
That, that, that I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.

02:01:13.348 --> 02:01:20.032
And so those things recruit proteins that are, that are involved in the life cycle of the cell that are involved in cancer and that involved in sensitive.

02:01:20.852 --> 02:01:25.795
So, um, there's actually, why is he saying sensitive instead of senescence?

02:01:26.035 --> 02:01:27.136
It's weird how he says it.

02:01:28.096 --> 02:01:32.819
In SARS that are attractive to there's the NSP 13 protein is attracted to quadriplegics.

02:01:33.854 --> 02:01:34.034
right?

02:01:34.054 --> 02:01:39.359
So they now have much, I think there's like four in the natural virus.

02:01:39.439 --> 02:01:44.623
It goes to like maybe nine and into the teens on the, on the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine.

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:52.190
So they're creating a lot more of these stall points and translation and other biological motifs that might alter the biochemistry of the cell.

02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.731
Wow.

02:01:52.771 --> 02:01:54.352
That's actually really, really good.

02:01:54.412 --> 02:01:57.255
Super codon structure, plexing telomere adocious.

02:01:57.355 --> 02:02:00.017
That's really actually extremely good.

02:02:00.925 --> 02:02:03.728
Super codon structure plexing, telomere adocious.

02:02:04.409 --> 02:02:06.991
McKernan saying this is really quite atrocious.

02:02:07.052 --> 02:02:12.657
That's really, I mean, dude, you better log off because you're done for the day.

02:02:12.697 --> 02:02:14.920
That was, that's a dunk right there.

02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:15.761
That's nicely done.

02:02:15.781 --> 02:02:22.908
The other thing that they did is they put a universal base in there known as pseudo-urine.

02:02:22.948 --> 02:02:23.669
All right.

02:02:24.611 --> 02:02:25.912
And many have probably heard about this.

02:02:25.952 --> 02:02:27.093
The patents go to UPenn.

02:02:28.434 --> 02:02:34.920
And so I've had another longtime viewer correct me on this a number of times.

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.261
It's not pseudo-uridine.

02:02:36.301 --> 02:02:38.283
It's M1 pseudo-uridine.

02:02:38.743 --> 02:02:46.990
And I'm not sure if he's just not being specific because he doesn't want to confuse his victim or if he's really not being specific to confuse his victim.

02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:50.293
I've never heard it called a universal base before, though.

02:02:50.976 --> 02:02:51.837
It's a degenerate base.

02:02:51.857 --> 02:02:51.997
Yeah.

02:02:52.017 --> 02:02:58.080
So it binds to, they won't call it that, but I built DNA sequencers on degenerate bases and those things were on a readoff for a reason.

02:02:59.101 --> 02:02:59.281
Yeah.

02:02:59.321 --> 02:03:07.626
So it binds to, it has pseudo-uridine being uracil, should have, it's like a thymidine replacement.

02:03:07.686 --> 02:03:07.987
Okay.

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:10.768
So it should have a, it should have one of these AT pairs.

02:03:11.289 --> 02:03:11.769
Right.

02:03:12.129 --> 02:03:16.292
And unfortunately this thing also binds to G. It also binds to itself.

02:03:16.752 --> 02:03:18.233
It also has some binding to,

02:03:18.795 --> 02:03:20.856
to cytosine.

02:03:20.936 --> 02:03:23.977
So this means that it's a very, very sticky base.

02:03:24.237 --> 02:03:26.337
It can, it can flip around and bind.

02:03:26.778 --> 02:03:28.598
If you actually look at its glycosic bond.

02:03:28.658 --> 02:03:32.199
And I don't want to sound like an idiot, but this is the first time I've ever heard this for me.

02:03:32.339 --> 02:03:37.221
I always just assumed it was a chemically different substitute for a single base.

02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:38.341
It does.

02:03:38.421 --> 02:03:39.221
It replaces it.

02:03:39.241 --> 02:03:43.723
They're replacing all of the use with this because it's more RNase resistant.

02:03:44.003 --> 02:03:44.303
Okay.

02:03:44.343 --> 02:03:45.603
So it doesn't degrade as much.

02:03:45.643 --> 02:03:47.684
So that meant, so you've now got a,

02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:53.595
an RNA, you've codon optimized it, you put a heavy promoter on it, and now you also took away the breaks.

02:03:54.876 --> 02:03:59.941
The breaks are usually RNAs that come in and chew up these messenger RNAs, but they put a long policy.

02:03:59.981 --> 02:04:10.912
So what's weird about that is, is that if it binds with other bases, see, I'm still trying to figure this out because there's no double-stranded RNA.

02:04:13.263 --> 02:04:18.267
So what does he mean when pseudouracil can bind with other bases?

02:04:18.327 --> 02:04:28.735
What he must mean is that the codons that are made by it can bind other transfer RNAs.

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:35.800
Because otherwise, I don't really know what he means, that it can also pair with T. RNA is not double-stranded.

02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:37.561
So when is it pairing like that?

02:04:37.901 --> 02:04:42.545
And if he's talking about that, then what he's actually saying, oh my gosh.

02:04:44.019 --> 02:04:57.307
We just realized it right now that what he's saying, and he might not want to say it, is that all these small erroneous RNAs that are part of this smear could potentially be

02:05:00.342 --> 02:05:23.670
interfering RNAs, small regulatory RNAs, that because they are degenerate bases at the uracil position, that we could have many small RNAs that have kind of a multiple potential affinity for RNAs that they could downregulate, RNAs that they could misregulate.

02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:27.952
So maybe it's hard to follow this, but small

02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:43.096
mRNAs are known to regulate larger RNAs because double-stranded RNA, when a little RNA binds to a big RNA, you create a little patch of double-stranded RNA, can attract cellular enzymes that will degrade the RNA.

02:05:43.116 --> 02:05:53.780
So if you have a bunch of RNA transcripts in the cell, and you want to downregulate some of them, you make, apparently, is what these people tell us, and in fact, they just gave a Nobel Prize out to some guy who works on this.

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.741
They, oh no,

02:05:58.914 --> 02:05:59.414
I see it.

02:06:00.855 --> 02:06:09.001
Because they gave a Nobel Prize to a guy who was working on microRNAs, but they didn't give him a prize for microRNAs.

02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:09.842
Do you see?

02:06:11.997 --> 02:06:37.621
And his discovery of micro RNAs should surely tell us that putting small degenerate base containing RNAs into our cells would be a very, very open-ended experiment because we wouldn't know what RNA transcripts those degenerate micro RNAs could potentially interact with if all of these bases are wobble bases.

02:06:38.442 --> 02:06:40.522
It doesn't even need to be specific anymore.

02:06:42.881 --> 02:07:00.008
And so instead of pointing that out, he's pointing it out from the perspective of what protein gets made, but he's not pointing it out from the perspective of what all those other unintended RNAs will do because they have a degenerate sequence that might overlap with endogenous RNAs.

02:07:02.829 --> 02:07:04.189
I'm sorry, but this is huge.

02:07:04.989 --> 02:07:07.210
Okay, this is why we review these things.

02:07:07.330 --> 02:07:11.592
This is why I'm doing it because I don't have any face to lose here.

02:07:13.871 --> 02:07:19.697
I got 3,100 followers on Twitch and I've had 14,000 followers on Twitter for the past two years.

02:07:20.237 --> 02:07:28.546
I have nothing to lose here except for a few people, and those few people I'm not going to lose because I know.

02:07:32.452 --> 02:07:41.994
I have to keep going, I have to keep pushing this because there is a chance that this biological illusion, this mythology can be dispelled.

02:07:42.434 --> 02:07:57.277
This generation, with these young people, they can be brought to see what happened during the pandemic and we can teach them enough of this biology so that they can see through it for their generation, for their children.

02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:04.164
I really see it as a distinct possibility right now.

02:08:08.407 --> 02:08:12.310
Lay tail on this, and they put these pseudo-uridines in there so that the RNases can't touch it.

02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:24.620
Now, there's a consequence to doing that, is when you camouflage these things from RNases, you also start triggering a lot of the toll receptors to get malfunctioned, like toll receptor 3, 7, and 8 could all scurry with pseudo-uridine.

02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:27.443
But that's a separate topic we can bench for later.

02:08:27.483 --> 02:08:29.184
The thing I want to get across is that,

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:33.801
the base that they have in there is not very specific.

02:08:34.061 --> 02:08:37.623
And so, when you don't have specific reading, you can get all types of mispronunciations.

02:08:37.643 --> 02:08:39.503
That doesn't even seem possible, but it is.

02:08:41.784 --> 02:08:56.549
Vilma just dropped in an original research paper from November of 2023 about VAERS, which is written with Jessica Rose and Daryl Rickey, the guy who published with

02:08:59.136 --> 02:08:59.936
Oh my gosh.

02:09:01.057 --> 02:09:02.077
That's pretty amazing.

02:09:03.038 --> 02:09:05.159
Uh, that is pretty amazing.

02:09:05.239 --> 02:09:08.420
Jessica Rose and Daryl Rickey.

02:09:10.381 --> 02:09:13.003
Um, wow.

02:09:14.263 --> 02:09:15.204
Um, wow.

02:09:16.044 --> 02:09:17.925
I don't, I don't know what to say about that.

02:09:17.965 --> 02:09:19.566
That's pretty shocking.

02:09:20.126 --> 02:09:20.206
Um,

02:09:21.903 --> 02:09:24.004
Anyway, we're just going to keep going as best we can.

02:09:24.044 --> 02:09:29.628
I hope this is not too, um, I do have to go in about a half an hour because I need to take a break.

02:09:29.688 --> 02:09:35.392
I have a way game at two o'clock and that has a very quick, I'm going to have to do a lot of talking for that away game.

02:09:35.472 --> 02:09:42.216
And then I also, um, I also, uh, I also need to still be able to play ball tonight.

02:09:42.256 --> 02:09:44.478
So let me see what we got going here.

02:09:44.498 --> 02:09:44.818
20 minutes.

02:09:44.898 --> 02:09:45.078
Wow.

02:09:45.098 --> 02:09:47.059
This is a 50 minute video or a 40 minute video.

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:49.061
Wrong one.

02:09:49.341 --> 02:09:49.701
Finding.

02:09:50.145 --> 02:09:52.106
You can get all types of hairpin formations to form.

02:09:52.486 --> 02:09:57.067
But more importantly, this will create errors in replication in DNA.

02:09:57.087 --> 02:10:01.029
But the errors that are actually orders of magnitude more frequent are errors in translation.

02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:04.130
Your tRNAs then have to come in and read this thing.

02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:07.571
And when you have universal bases in there, they get all confused.

02:10:07.631 --> 02:10:09.372
And the translation errors go through the roof.

02:10:10.592 --> 02:10:12.293
And there's a couple of papers I can point you to.

02:10:12.313 --> 02:10:13.573
You're bumping your microphone or something.

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:14.473
Oh, I am.

02:10:14.493 --> 02:10:15.014
My hands are on it.

02:10:15.054 --> 02:10:15.234
Sorry.

02:10:15.254 --> 02:10:16.094
There must be a problem.

02:10:16.815 --> 02:10:18.877
Sorry.

02:10:18.897 --> 02:10:26.263
So when you have this universal base in there, it not only confuses polymerases, but it more readily confuses the tRNAs and the ribosomes.

02:10:26.303 --> 02:10:29.225
They have a much harder job of having to put these triplet codons in there.

02:10:29.666 --> 02:10:38.193
And when one of the bases is mismatching to multiple different bases, the transcription, I'm sorry, translation errors go through the roof.

02:10:38.673 --> 02:10:39.274
Right.

02:10:39.754 --> 02:10:43.037
Now there's a paper on there that tries to measure these translation errors with pseudouridine.

02:10:43.057 --> 02:10:44.658
And they measure like, they can detect it,

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.364
when there's like one pseudouridine in there.

02:10:48.005 --> 02:10:53.094
And what we know from these mRNAs, every uracil is replaced with these.

02:10:53.154 --> 02:10:57.602
So they're getting codons invariably that have multiple pseudouridines underneath these tRNAs.

02:10:58.268 --> 02:11:00.228
There's no way that thing creates high.

02:11:00.489 --> 02:11:01.689
Okay, so then why not?

02:11:01.869 --> 02:11:11.271
Why not start here, then this is a great reason not to jab people because the protein that you're making will never be pure because of the degenerate basis.

02:11:11.311 --> 02:11:12.752
He's explaining it right here.

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:18.073
So we don't need double stranded DNA to blame because they're the original

02:11:19.016 --> 02:11:44.116
the original the actual pure product even on a cartoon pure level would still be inappropriate because it wouldn't create the fidelity of antigen or epitopes that you that are drawn in the cartoon or are on the Moderna drawing because that's not how the these pseudo-uridine bases will will do you see

02:11:45.117 --> 02:11:50.844
so why isn't he telling everybody that transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent because

02:11:52.045 --> 02:11:55.687
The wobble bases mean that they're not making good spike protein.

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:57.829
They're not making whatever they say they're going to make.

02:11:57.849 --> 02:12:14.660
So even if it isn't a toxic protein, even if it isn't, or the codon optimization doesn't hurt, the bottom line is, is that the fidelity of the technology is being exaggerated and its usefulness for augmenting the immune system is being exaggerated.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:16.241
But this guy can't say it.

02:12:22.572 --> 02:12:27.175
You just said that they could detect the translation errors when there was only one?

02:12:27.715 --> 02:12:28.015
Yes.

02:12:28.275 --> 02:12:30.317
And these things have replaced all of them.

02:12:32.038 --> 02:12:34.119
That's a huge statement.

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:37.301
Again, I'm learning a lot of this for the first time.

02:12:37.381 --> 02:12:39.782
I did not realize that this was this awful.

02:12:40.723 --> 02:12:41.143
Wow.

02:12:41.943 --> 02:12:51.829
Now here's another thing that's really spooky about, at least the Pfizer one, is there's some papers out there that show when you put pseudouridine in the stop codons, the ribosomes read through it.

02:12:52.622 --> 02:12:54.663
And they sometimes frameshift on the way through it.

02:12:55.723 --> 02:13:02.726
It means they keep translating the RNA sequence that's past the double stop codon.

02:13:02.746 --> 02:13:08.329
So you have to ask, what's on the three prime end of the Pfizer UTR?

02:13:08.509 --> 02:13:09.649
Like, what do they have back there?

02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:11.690
And we went and scanned all those things.

02:13:11.710 --> 02:13:17.333
And there's actually a human peptide on the other end of that that could get expressed as a chimeric protein.

02:13:17.653 --> 02:13:18.974
We've got no evidence for this in vivo.

02:13:18.994 --> 02:13:21.675
This is just all in silica stuff that we're looking at.

02:13:22.768 --> 02:13:26.051
if pseudouridine ablates that SOP codon, what does it read into?

02:13:26.651 --> 02:13:33.177
And it reads into a fairly long peptide that has some homology to GP130, but we don't know much more about it.

02:13:33.257 --> 02:13:37.100
The data in NCBI is pretty sparse on whatever that thing is.

02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:45.687
But some of that's in the paper we put together with Peter McCullough as to what the human peptide is and what does that mean if some,

02:13:47.654 --> 02:13:52.798
There's some error rate here, and I'm not suggesting every single spike protein that comes off this mRNA is going to do this.

02:13:52.838 --> 02:13:59.183
These error rates happen at frequencies that are very low, but you have to keep them in context to how many molecules they're injecting into you.

02:13:59.203 --> 02:14:02.506
They're injecting trillions of these things into you, right?

02:14:03.086 --> 02:14:09.151
So those numbers, times an error rate that some I've seen, 10 to the minus four, 10 to the minus fifth rate,

02:14:09.931 --> 02:14:10.952
they matter, they matter.

02:14:10.972 --> 02:14:17.435
You could get chimeric proteins that come out of this that have human SARS chimerase.

02:14:17.455 --> 02:14:25.078
So no mention of this now with regard to the DNA contamination, no mention of this when he was given a platform to speak in front of the U.S.

02:14:25.118 --> 02:14:30.380
Senate next to Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Pierre Cory, no mention of this at all.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:36.663
It was very specific that there's double-stranded contamination in what apparently would otherwise be okay.

02:14:38.467 --> 02:14:46.034
And if it's not okay, then why isn't he taking that time to explain all of this that he could explain to me in December of 2021?

02:14:46.194 --> 02:14:56.183
And, you know, what does it do?

02:14:56.203 --> 02:14:57.745
Does it create autoantibody issues?

02:14:57.765 --> 02:14:59.146
Does that create autoimmune issues?

02:15:00.423 --> 02:15:03.287
I mean, the long story short is these are all hypotheses.

02:15:03.387 --> 02:15:04.549
Autoantibodies.

02:15:04.689 --> 02:15:05.029
Wow.

02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:18.406
So, you know, the only way that they would get autoantibodies from a transfection is if, in this scenario, the pseudouridine reads through the double stop codon and translates what's on the other side, which happens to be a human protein.

02:15:20.086 --> 02:15:25.027
So if I took that bait and went for it for the next six months and said, everybody, hey, guess what?

02:15:25.167 --> 02:15:31.588
Kevin McKernan taught me that it reads through the double stop codon and there's a human protein that could cause auto antibodies.

02:15:32.388 --> 02:15:34.108
Now I'm selling their product.

02:15:36.329 --> 02:15:40.349
Because if they would just fix that problem, it would go away.

02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:47.471
I'm not, it would be no different than buying into the double-stranded DNA.

02:15:47.511 --> 02:15:49.351
If they could just get it out, it would be okay.

02:15:52.096 --> 02:15:56.161
Here, he's actually telling us some things that make it never okay.

02:15:57.862 --> 02:15:59.104
But he's never said that.

02:15:59.965 --> 02:16:04.790
Only I have been able to say that transfection in healthy humans is criminal.

02:16:05.050 --> 02:16:05.511
Only me.

02:16:07.473 --> 02:16:09.015
He said something else was criminal.

02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.849
Right?

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:11.889
And it wasn't this.

02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:15.010
It was the idea that it was a pro-drug.

02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:16.491
And so what?

02:16:17.311 --> 02:16:20.372
The expression of the protein is not dangerous.

02:16:20.572 --> 02:16:25.693
It's whatever protein is produced that's dangerous and whether or not that protein is good or not.

02:16:25.753 --> 02:16:35.856
So all of the stories that are found in this interview up until the moment of 23 minutes, all of the stories completely absolve

02:16:36.596 --> 02:16:42.823
transfection as a methodology from any general role in the damage being done.

02:16:42.983 --> 02:16:56.717
It is specific aspects of it that include the lipid nanoparticle, that include the pseudouridines, that include the mistranslation, that include the tail of RNA fragments,

02:16:57.503 --> 02:16:58.604
The lack of purity.

02:16:59.524 --> 02:17:05.968
All of these are reasons why the shot could never be okay and was always criminal.

02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:11.472
And yet now in 2024, this man isn't saying any of these things.

02:17:11.532 --> 02:17:13.353
He hasn't gotten better at saying them.

02:17:13.734 --> 02:17:15.755
He hasn't gotten better at summarizing them.

02:17:16.175 --> 02:17:19.357
He's gotten better at forgetting them and never mentioning them again.

02:17:19.457 --> 02:17:27.383
For me, they became a list that got longer and longer and longer of all the reasons why we should stand up and not allow this.

02:17:27.903 --> 02:17:31.666
And for him, the list has actually changed over time.

02:17:36.505 --> 02:17:49.325
as has his interweaving connections with CHD and Robert Malone and this whole Senate hearing every year and international COVID summits.

02:17:52.967 --> 02:17:56.390
He is a weak link in that chain, ladies and gentlemen.

02:17:56.410 --> 02:18:07.781
He's a kink in their armor because, like Pierre Kory, there is no way to explain why someone like him would waste so much time on some nobody like me.

02:18:08.782 --> 02:18:14.168
This is a many, many hundreds, you know, probably hundreds of millionaire kind of person.

02:18:15.097 --> 02:18:21.601
who does not need to be on Twitter telling people that my, my, my ideas are chemtrail retarded.

02:18:21.642 --> 02:18:23.643
He has no need to do that.

02:18:23.703 --> 02:18:26.365
There's no explanation for it at all.

02:18:28.326 --> 02:18:36.712
Other than to make sure that I never really stepped back far enough to realize how far I was fooled and kept vigorously arguing with them.

02:18:39.949 --> 02:18:45.650
And now all I can do is humbly submit to you that they fooled me as best as I've ever been fooled in my life.

02:18:47.391 --> 02:18:53.152
And if it wasn't for the grace of God and the faith of my wife in me, I would have never pulled my head out.

02:18:56.153 --> 02:19:05.335
And I would have never had the guts to ask to present to Bobby, to send him an email that then provoked a podcast that will go down in history.

02:19:08.115 --> 02:19:18.428
with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, and Tess Laurie, all on the same podcast to try and dilute what I would say in the first seven minutes.

02:19:21.412 --> 02:19:23.415
And that's a whole year after this.

02:19:27.935 --> 02:19:31.117
And that's still more than a year and a half before today.

02:19:33.479 --> 02:19:35.521
It's really crazy where we are, guys.

02:19:36.021 --> 02:19:37.422
Disease that haven't been explored.

02:19:37.462 --> 02:19:38.263
They're in silica.

02:19:38.283 --> 02:19:52.954
But you do have to ask, why did Pfizer and Moderna, these people, get away with getting the prodrug certified without ever having to show their hand on what the hell these things make in human cells?

02:19:53.575 --> 02:19:56.637
I've dug up a couple of papers in that paper with Peter.

02:19:57.310 --> 02:20:03.514
on, okay, there's a couple other images in papers that look like this could be happening.

02:20:03.554 --> 02:20:09.518
Like when you ever, there's one great paper out there, I think from Bancel that looks at like spikes, spike proteins that are expressed in exosomes, right?

02:20:11.099 --> 02:20:13.581
In the blood, they showed them like four months later, really interesting.

02:20:13.981 --> 02:20:15.162
Exosomes.

02:20:16.523 --> 02:20:18.845
Exosomes, exosomes.

02:20:18.985 --> 02:20:22.187
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:20:22.407 --> 02:20:23.228
That is awesome.

02:20:23.268 --> 02:20:28.252
They do have some like SDS page images of what they, of those exosomes and they're smeary.

02:20:29.012 --> 02:20:29.853
He said it again.

02:20:29.913 --> 02:20:32.575
He said exosomes again.

02:20:32.655 --> 02:20:33.736
He said it again.

02:20:33.976 --> 02:20:42.622
Jiang et al that, that, um, showed these, uh, showing fragments and, and, and they're, they're the fragments that were getting expressed at the spike protein.

02:20:42.642 --> 02:20:43.623
They weren't all full length.

02:20:44.147 --> 02:20:47.468
they were different based on the cell fraction they isolated them from, right?

02:20:48.189 --> 02:20:51.870
And I think that was even with the DNA vaccine that didn't have the pseudo-uridium problems, right?

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:56.752
So you can imagine that would get even worse if you had all these other complications put in there.

02:20:56.792 --> 02:21:01.834
So my concern is we don't really know what these vaccines are producing.

02:21:01.854 --> 02:21:02.875
We don't know the fidelity of it.

02:21:03.375 --> 02:21:10.118
We suspect there's some spike protein because there's motifs that look like spike proteins because antibody studies, but we only have antibodies.

02:21:10.658 --> 02:21:12.499
So it's kind of like the people, you know,

02:21:12.935 --> 02:21:15.397
blindfolded doctors touching the elephant, right?

02:21:15.417 --> 02:21:17.898
You know you got some similarity, fine.

02:21:18.839 --> 02:21:23.122
But we don't precisely know the diversity of what's getting expressed in humans.

02:21:23.707 --> 02:21:24.247
Nice.

02:21:24.447 --> 02:21:29.470
And we only have antibody studies, so we really don't know what they look like or what form they are.

02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:34.653
And so we're really taking their word for it, like doctors feeling an elephant with the blindfold on.

02:21:35.133 --> 02:21:46.699
But he's never actually going to allow us to get to the point where we could realize that the national security state, with the help of people like him going on podcasts, could use bullshit PCRs on a

02:21:47.379 --> 02:21:51.322
on a hot background to convince us of whatever they wanted to convince us of.

02:21:51.862 --> 02:21:57.285
And if we accepted it and taught this to our kids, it would literally be the end of everything.

02:22:00.967 --> 02:22:02.668
Wow, that's impressive.

02:22:03.269 --> 02:22:07.691
And we should be concerned about that because these LMPs don't target particular sound lines that go everywhere.

02:22:09.132 --> 02:22:11.174
So that's a much broader problem.

02:22:11.314 --> 02:22:13.435
If you knew that, okay, we're expressing

02:22:14.122 --> 02:22:26.950
Some fragmented spikes, but we've got them well-characterized, the data's public, and they're going only to cell lines that the virus sees, like ACE2 expressing cell lines or CD147 expressing cell lines.

02:22:26.970 --> 02:22:29.132
Fine, you've got an understood complexity of the problem.

02:22:29.532 --> 02:22:32.334
When you start using these LMPs, they transfect every cell they touch.

02:22:32.934 --> 02:22:41.840
So now you've got to worry about not just what does spike toxicity do in those, what does all the degenerate products of low-fidelity spike expression do to many more cell lines?

02:22:42.914 --> 02:22:45.975
It can really blow up like the complexity of the problem.

02:22:46.075 --> 02:22:49.997
And even perhaps the symptomatology right we Right, right.

02:22:50.077 --> 02:23:00.341
It's this is blowing my mind because it didn't really The, the, the extent to which this this adds variables is really breathtaking actually

02:23:01.562 --> 02:23:09.647
It's been frustrating me because I've heard so many arguments online that, oh, it's just the spike protein that's identical to what's in the virus.

02:23:10.047 --> 02:23:10.967
No biggie, right?

02:23:11.007 --> 02:23:14.189
So you shouldn't, your symptoms, your adverse event profile.

02:23:14.229 --> 02:23:25.536
So you see how this hamster wheel is so well constructed that it moves so smoothly and keeps you from ever turning and facing the real question is, was there something?

02:23:25.696 --> 02:23:27.497
Are we really detecting anything?

02:23:27.537 --> 02:23:29.518
You're not really asking that question.

02:23:30.811 --> 02:23:37.556
You're not really asking about the possibility of a background that these people are misconstruing as a high fidelity signal.

02:23:37.596 --> 02:23:39.097
We are taking his word for it.

02:23:39.217 --> 02:23:43.820
I'm taking his word for it that there are flaws, but there is a signal to be found.

02:23:45.441 --> 02:23:48.043
And that assumption is what gets you in the trap.

02:23:48.083 --> 02:23:48.963
There is a signal.

02:23:48.983 --> 02:23:50.104
I mean, it's strange.

02:23:50.144 --> 02:23:50.824
We got sick.

02:23:50.884 --> 02:23:51.645
People got sick.

02:23:51.705 --> 02:23:52.185
We agree.

02:23:52.265 --> 02:23:52.766
I mean, come on.

02:23:53.902 --> 02:23:58.326
should be a subset of what you get from the virus, because we're giving you a subset of the virus.

02:23:58.466 --> 02:24:01.948
We're not giving you the full replicate of competent virus.

02:24:03.109 --> 02:24:11.435
I don't think that theory should be accepted blindly, because we're injecting these things into more varied cell lines.

02:24:11.675 --> 02:24:13.877
We are injecting them, I think, at a higher concentration.

02:24:13.897 --> 02:24:17.520
I mean, the way, how do you read those antibody studies, right?

02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:21.783
You see that they have higher antibody expression against spike, right?

02:24:22.336 --> 02:24:24.400
I don't read that as like a better immune response.

02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:26.303
I read that as you're expressing more spike.

02:24:26.664 --> 02:24:30.570
And so the antibodies are probably a proxy to the expression level of spike.

02:24:31.212 --> 02:24:31.973
And is that a good thing?

02:24:32.961 --> 02:24:37.385
Do you really need massive amounts of spike protein to build an immune response?

02:24:37.826 --> 02:24:40.628
Because we have to be careful here, spikes are toxic peptides.

02:24:40.648 --> 02:24:51.817
So we're debating whether it's a toxic peptide and how much of it should there be and whether or not the antibody levels are correlated with the amount of spike protein that was expressed.

02:24:52.858 --> 02:24:54.360
This is all just amazing.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.541
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap it up here.

02:24:56.601 --> 02:24:58.663
I might watch the rest of it with you tomorrow.

02:24:59.184 --> 02:25:00.585
I might dare to look at it again.

02:25:01.565 --> 02:25:02.626
Um, I, I don't know.

02:25:02.806 --> 02:25:03.987
I'm, I'm impressed.

02:25:04.547 --> 02:25:10.771
Um, I'm impressed because, uh, I, I didn't think it was going to be quite this hard.

02:25:11.191 --> 02:25:27.422
Um, but it is, uh, if you look back and you really see what happened, I mean, there's going to be hours and hours of evidence of me being fooled and the, the video that's next to that, um, on my website, uh, let me escape from here or out of here.

02:25:28.462 --> 02:25:34.236
And if you look at my website here and we go to, let's see, what is this?

02:25:37.984 --> 02:25:45.812
You can first of all go back and you can see the earlier ones in April and in May where he's talking about the same things.

02:25:45.832 --> 02:25:51.118
You can also see Allison Morrow cut her teeth early on in 2020 on the same podcast with him.

02:25:51.879 --> 02:25:59.226
So it's a reared confluence of people that did pretty well in 2020 and 2021 developing podcasts and he was on all of their shows.

02:26:00.582 --> 02:26:10.308
Um, and then also if you go to, um, GigaOM's archive here and you go down to where Kevin McKernan, the friendly times, I didn't even notice.

02:26:10.368 --> 02:26:12.110
I said that the raw interview.

02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:16.652
And then this one is actually really interesting because this is the stream that I do right after it.

02:26:16.733 --> 02:26:18.494
And boy, am I bamboozled?

02:26:18.554 --> 02:26:19.855
Like I.

02:26:20.757 --> 02:26:29.399
I nail it in the sense of auditioning for the role that I would be given as advisor for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:26:29.439 --> 02:26:33.000
And remember that right after this, like, let's see when this is.

02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:33.920
Does it say?

02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:34.800
Can I see it?

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.701
If this thumbnail shows up on Vimeo, then I can see it.

02:26:40.201 --> 02:26:42.081
Ah, yeah.

02:26:42.361 --> 02:26:43.102
21st of December.

02:26:43.162 --> 02:26:44.822
See, so this is like a week afterward.

02:26:45.718 --> 02:26:49.042
And in those days I was preparing a new slide deck all the time.

02:26:49.082 --> 02:26:50.243
I wasn't going on every day.

02:26:50.724 --> 02:26:53.447
And so this is a really interesting video also to watch.

02:26:54.067 --> 02:26:57.111
It's going to reveal exactly how fooled I was.

02:26:57.831 --> 02:27:02.436
And exactly why a lot of the people that were paying attention to me at the time were completely fooled.

02:27:02.937 --> 02:27:04.619
Because I was pretty good at selling it.

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:10.744
And I think I'm also pretty good at selling my humble submission that I was wrong.

02:27:11.484 --> 02:27:15.187
And I'm pretty good at explaining it, but a lot of these people just don't want to hear it.

02:27:15.928 --> 02:27:17.409
And that's how they get away with it.

02:27:17.449 --> 02:27:18.550
They don't talk about 2020.

02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:27.677
They don't talk about a background signal or how PCR can work, or even in its purest form, like we heard from Kevin McKernan, it would never work the way they said it would.

02:27:28.137 --> 02:27:33.141
And transformation and transfection is something we've been using for a long time, even if Kevin McKernan says,

02:27:33.661 --> 02:27:37.262
He can't really say anything because they changed the lipid nanoparticle for this one.

02:27:38.543 --> 02:27:41.764
And infectious clone is something he could have taught me about here.

02:27:41.824 --> 02:27:49.667
But of course, one of his jobs is to make sure that everybody thinks that that's a chemtrail retarded idea instead of explaining how virology is an illusion.

02:27:50.148 --> 02:27:51.608
And RNA cannot pandemic.

02:27:51.648 --> 02:27:53.609
If you knew that, then you wouldn't buy any of this.

02:27:54.830 --> 02:28:00.572
So endemicity versus background is the illusion, or at least one of the illusions they won't talk about.

02:28:00.692 --> 02:28:02.913
Placebos, another illusion they won't talk about.

02:28:03.834 --> 02:28:05.116
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:28:05.156 --> 02:28:06.558
The vaccine schedule sucks.

02:28:06.638 --> 02:28:07.780
Transfection does too.

02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.462
And RNA can't pandemic.

02:28:09.502 --> 02:28:10.724
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:28:10.764 --> 02:28:11.866
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:28:11.906 --> 02:28:13.969
I do have an away game, so I got to end quick.

02:28:15.271 --> 02:28:18.455
GigaOMBiological.com and Stream.GigaOMB.bio.

02:28:18.475 --> 02:28:18.936
Thanks very much.

02:28:18.976 --> 02:28:19.317
See you.

02:28:37.905 --> 02:28:39.887
Drill-tard friends.

02:28:40.467 --> 02:28:41.228
Nice one.

02:28:41.828 --> 02:28:42.429
Nice one.

02:28:42.529 --> 02:28:43.190
How does it go?

02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:44.651
I gotta say it.

02:28:44.891 --> 02:28:48.274
I gotta go scroll back up here for super something something.

02:28:48.694 --> 02:28:51.957
Super codon structure-plexing telomere-adocious.

02:28:52.777 --> 02:28:55.900
Super codon structure-plexing telomere-adocious.

02:28:57.241 --> 02:28:59.463
Super codon structure-plexing telomere-adocious.

02:29:00.604 --> 02:29:02.646
Super codon structure-plexing telomere-adocious.

02:29:04.013 --> 02:29:06.722
Supercoat on structure flexing, telomere adhocious.

02:29:07.726 --> 02:29:10.054
Kevin McKernan saying this is really quite atrocious.

02:30:20.888 --> 02:30:22.117
Stop lying!
