01:11.305 --> 01:15.187
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:17.012 --> 01:17.713
And I have lied.

01:17.933 --> 01:18.774
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:18.794 --> 01:20.517
I don't want to lie, you know?

01:20.737 --> 01:21.558
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:21.578 --> 01:22.700
I try not to be a liar.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.601
I don't want to be a liar.

01:24.161 --> 01:26.845
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

01:53.490 --> 02:07.082
Community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap, trying to screen their employees and their nursing homes for something that's not going to turn positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

02:09.924 --> 02:16.970
I said, dude, you need these capture antigen things, where you're not looking for antibodies, you're actually looking for the virus.

02:20.779 --> 02:27.144
But the antibody is what's on the membrane, the antibody specific for the COVID virus.

02:28.785 --> 02:33.809
So patient sample, mix it up, the whole virus is coming through.

02:33.829 --> 02:41.095
And if it latches one of them, another antibody comes through and it turns color.

02:41.115 --> 02:43.016
You get like the pregnancy test kit.

02:44.718 --> 02:46.219
The first one of these I saw, we, 2021,

02:49.853 --> 02:52.655
We had to go to Rome to speak to the Italian Senate.

02:54.436 --> 02:57.779
And I'm not vaccinated.

02:57.799 --> 02:59.280
I don't have a card.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.321
Neither did Dr. Malone.

03:03.202 --> 03:04.063
He didn't have a card.

03:04.904 --> 03:06.985
So, you know, I know you can't come in and out.

03:07.405 --> 03:08.646
So we're raising hell.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.969
So they go in and take us to see the

03:13.223 --> 03:37.137
the Senate doctor, he's got these little rapid flow can, he rips it open and I'm reading this thing, antigen test kit, not antibody, antigen, the protein, let's say it's testing for spike protein, and it's accurate, and it's as accurate as the PCR test would have been if you ran it at a CT.

03:43.662 --> 03:45.564
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

03:45.664 --> 03:50.950
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

03:51.831 --> 03:58.579
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

04:55.158 --> 04:58.900
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

04:59.461 --> 05:01.702
We want everybody to feel good.

05:02.022 --> 05:03.183
That's not the way life is.

05:36.755 --> 05:37.015
Yeah.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.373
Maybe it's my fault.

06:10.195 --> 06:13.037
Maybe I led you to believe it was easy when it wasn't.

06:14.839 --> 06:19.023
Maybe I made you think my highlights started at the free throw line and not in the gym.

06:21.165 --> 06:23.888
Maybe I made you think that every shot I took was a game winner.

06:26.711 --> 06:29.654
That my game was built on flash and not fire.

06:32.389 --> 06:38.074
Maybe it's my fault that you didn't see that failure gave me strength, that my pain was my motivation.

06:40.336 --> 06:48.622
Maybe I led you to believe that basketball was a God-given gift and not something I worked for every single day of my life.

06:52.766 --> 06:53.967
Maybe I destroyed the game.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.352
Or maybe you're just making excuses.

07:04.102 --> 07:05.023
What time is it?

07:05.083 --> 07:05.844
Game time!

07:05.944 --> 07:06.184
Woo!

07:13.070 --> 07:14.171
Good morning, everybody.

07:14.191 --> 07:15.232
Welcome to the show.

07:15.272 --> 07:20.457
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:21.138 --> 07:25.942
We're trying to stay focused on the biology, not take the bait on social media, and to love our real neighbors.

07:25.962 --> 07:27.644
Yes, that was a European starling.

07:27.684 --> 07:29.486
I think she raised that bird, though, so...

07:30.206 --> 07:31.948
It's vocal talents are unique.

07:33.028 --> 07:39.274
Ladies and gentlemen, you need to get your kids off of social media and right now because right now there's still a door open.

07:40.194 --> 07:44.098
We can still establish our own social media networks.

07:44.138 --> 07:45.459
You will not call autism.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.140
I don't like the word autism.

07:48.041 --> 07:48.962
He was vaccine damaged.

07:49.022 --> 07:49.362
Thank you.

07:49.682 --> 07:50.223
Thank you, Brian.

07:50.883 --> 08:01.265
Um, yeah, so I think it's really important to understand that the statement that GigaOM Biological is making is that these people and these organizations are all sabotaged.

08:02.446 --> 08:08.927
And these organizations are all part of the same illusion that is the COVID pandemic.

08:08.987 --> 08:12.008
They are part and parcel for the same scam.

08:12.998 --> 08:28.603
And if you don't start to realize that these people are playing the same script, then you will never, ever really understand why it's so significant that in 2013, Brian Hooker did not call it autism.

08:29.364 --> 08:32.985
Brian Hooker did not call it autism.

08:34.639 --> 08:44.328
That's a very significant thing to realize because that means that autism spectrum disorder is actually a myth to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

08:44.749 --> 08:49.393
Virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

08:49.813 --> 08:55.339
And in fact, pandemics and gain-of-function as mythologies have also served the same purpose.

08:57.014 --> 09:07.883
Now I think it's interesting to watch everybody come to the realization that I might have been right about the intramuscular injection is dumb whole, you know, language of it.

09:08.343 --> 09:15.249
It might actually be so dead on balls accurate that it was hard for people to process three years ago when I started saying it.

09:17.511 --> 09:27.879
I don't really know what to say other than pandemics and gain-of-function have also made it possible that most people on earth have come to accept that there was a novel virus.

09:28.820 --> 09:35.726
Most people have come to accept that PCR is a useful diagnostic for as many as 15 or 16 viruses.

09:37.267 --> 09:41.591
They have come to accept that COVID or something strange killed millions of people.

09:42.967 --> 09:47.029
And they have come to accept that mRNA maybe even saved some.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.171
You know, it could have also killed people.

09:49.191 --> 09:52.933
It may have given some more people COVID or something like that.

09:54.373 --> 09:56.755
And social media is useful.

09:56.855 --> 09:59.596
This one is the really bad one.

10:01.257 --> 10:03.398
Because social media is not useful.

10:03.939 --> 10:06.040
And in fact, I would argue,

10:07.711 --> 10:28.742
that one of the reasons everyone has come to accept the mythologies of autism spectrum disorder, the mythologies of world-ending nukes, the mythologies of world-ending viruses, the mythologies of world-ending nanoparticles, the mythologies of world-ending proteins called prions,

10:29.402 --> 10:46.028
The mythologies of world-ending phenomenon like antibiotic-resistant bacteria, these are all mythologies that they have used to coerce us into accepting these more basic assumptions under which we will be enslaved.

10:47.677 --> 10:49.738
That's the reality of it in my humble opinion.

10:49.778 --> 10:52.879
I think I got here for a reason.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.762
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, you're not going to get out.

10:59.022 --> 11:00.703
And so that's the trick.

11:03.064 --> 11:04.205
You have to be smarter.

11:05.575 --> 11:11.218
And right now people are not even behaving as smart as rats behave in the backyard.

11:11.538 --> 11:27.326
I mean you can only catch a rat or his friends with the same trap a couple of times and after that the trap ain't gonna work anymore on the rest of those rats because they will have witnessed what happened with the other rats and they'll understand, trust me,

11:28.546 --> 11:41.076
I know from experience animals are very, very smart and humans, unfortunately, when they engage with other humans or when they think they're engaging with other humans, they're very, very much less smart.

11:43.498 --> 11:44.839
And that's the problem.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.943
Ladies and gentlemen, if you haven't, please subscribe, follow, watch.

11:50.524 --> 11:52.105
Housatonicits.com.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.448
His program from this morning is especially poignant.

11:56.569 --> 11:59.052
I'm going to springboard off of it a little bit today.

11:59.072 --> 12:00.033
I've pivoted.

12:00.073 --> 12:02.856
We're not going to do that video that I promised, unfortunately.

12:03.929 --> 12:05.651
I hope you're not disappointed in that.

12:06.331 --> 12:10.575
Also, shout out to biologyphenomenons.substack.com.

12:11.235 --> 12:21.523
Still one of the best places where you can see how this manslaughter was pulled off, where they murdered and ended people and then lied about why it happened, lied about it to the world.

12:22.865 --> 12:26.407
But I do think the truth will set all of us free.

12:27.528 --> 12:30.571
And that truth is available if you just know what you're looking for.

12:31.781 --> 12:32.822
And it's the biology.

12:32.882 --> 12:33.862
Biology is the way.

12:33.902 --> 12:38.545
You gotta learn the biology and then so much of this mythology just evaporates.

12:39.946 --> 12:42.888
And there are easy ways to challenge people.

12:43.568 --> 12:47.771
And I think a lot of vulnerable people that need to be challenged are actually in America.

12:49.035 --> 12:53.417
Americans needed to be especially focused on in terms of the bamboozlement.

12:54.237 --> 13:03.921
There are lots of smaller populations with less potential for realizing the truth, that we're more easily controlled.

13:03.961 --> 13:07.303
The Netherlands is a place that has 17 million people.

13:07.363 --> 13:10.444
It's not an unmanageable population.

13:11.284 --> 13:17.007
And the United States is approaching one of these populations without military level control.

13:18.228 --> 13:22.481
We are we we are we are a tough nation to govern and so for a long time.

13:22.521 --> 13:23.724
They've been optimizing this

13:25.495 --> 13:34.820
And COVID can be seen as a wave which was coercing us, a wave of consensus created on social media because we've acquiesced to its use.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.003
And so, some people are able to use social media and kind of extract truth from it.

13:41.123 --> 13:49.608
I like to think of myself as eventually having learned how that might be possible, but I still think it's a very error-prone process by design.

13:51.061 --> 14:01.401
And the best strategy that I have for you is to stay focused on biology, to not take the bait on social media, which means blocking and muting and just ignoring so much of what's there.

14:02.559 --> 14:17.406
Any kind of consensus about what everybody's talking about whether it was the second or third shooter in in Butler, Pennsylvania or or whether it's You know how many planes disappeared and how many globes were there that were going around the airplane?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.367
You must love your neighbors.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.588
You got to get to know them again.

14:22.108 --> 14:26.370
It's gonna be really crucial maybe even this year so don't put that off and

14:26.730 --> 14:32.556
Um, start to get to know your neighbors again and start to come together under this realization that we're all under the same spell.

14:33.237 --> 14:41.204
We've all fallen for the trick of social media and so we are all vulnerable to these illusions of consensus on social media.

14:42.225 --> 14:46.770
Um, just one second please, let me switch over to the desk view.

14:47.811 --> 14:50.413
Um, good morning everybody, welcome to the show.

14:51.674 --> 14:56.736
This is giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

14:56.756 --> 15:06.379
My name is Jonathan Cooey I am coming to you live from Pittsburgh in the back of my garage It's a warm day, but not warm enough that I don't have the back door open.

15:06.399 --> 15:07.459
So there's a little breeze in here.

15:07.479 --> 15:10.140
It's humid It's very humid

15:11.551 --> 15:14.434
And as usual, the captain has joined us on the bridge.

15:15.375 --> 15:23.783
We are in some alternative timeline here where apparently people think that intramuscular injection is a great idea.

15:24.444 --> 15:30.730
And fabulously enough, my friend Mark Hulak in Boston has been doing some of his analyst magic.

15:31.431 --> 15:45.568
and just decided to turn his attention and his website memberships to questions regarding when was it that people decided to entertain the possibility that a metal

15:47.179 --> 16:02.430
rod, a hollow metal rod with a sharpened end could be used to inject substances into animals and people as a way of administering medicine, as a way of augmenting their immune system or augmenting their health.

16:02.490 --> 16:04.011
Let's just talk in a more general term.

16:04.971 --> 16:25.514
And I find it quite striking that this question and this sort of angle of investigation, as far as I can tell, was never really part of, for example, Suzanne Humphrey's book in 2013, Dissolving Illusions, written with this other dude named Roman Bozansk.

16:26.395 --> 16:38.539
I'm confused as to this forgotten history and why the forgotten history has nothing to do with the change to intramuscular injection.

16:38.579 --> 16:42.840
It's weird how with just a few days of work, you know, a few

16:43.601 --> 17:11.910
Few days and I don't know it could be as you know, 48 hours of work, you know, it could be a whole week essentially, it could have been a whole week of Equivalent work for all I know maybe more than that Mark was able to make some very serious headway and identifying some of the places where Doctors in the United States attempted to Inject things in a lot of people and there are pretty

17:13.442 --> 17:20.228
what I would call detailed descriptions of what they did and the contents of them.

17:20.588 --> 17:34.239
And the detailed descriptions, what they say and don't say, how they say it, reveal an extreme, I would characterize it, an extreme naivety to the potential dangers of injecting

17:36.162 --> 17:37.863
into a human.

17:37.923 --> 17:54.872
Now, what you have to remember, and I think this is something that, you know, will help augment what Mark has been doing over the past few days, is realize that with regard to injecting in an animal, and I have experience with, you know, working on animals and injecting them and transfecting their brains,

17:57.819 --> 18:05.783
You can imagine that it's a little more difficult to tell with a mouse that it's in discomfort or that it's, you know, something is wrong.

18:05.863 --> 18:08.685
And certainly you're not going to get any details about what's wrong.

18:08.705 --> 18:14.447
You're just going to have this general feeling based on its behavior that it's not acting how it used to act.

18:14.508 --> 18:25.093
And so number one, that requires a great deal of familiarity with the animal or animals that you're working with, which is not guaranteed from any perspective in research.

18:26.669 --> 18:29.452
And secondly, it requires a researcher to care.

18:31.874 --> 18:46.545
And nevertheless, the signal that you're going to get is only going to be very strong when the damage or pain that the animal has is very severe, or the damage in the brain, for example, is very severe.

18:50.831 --> 19:17.967
One example that I can give you is that when you are doing daily experiments with mice, like C57 Black 6, these very typical mice that are used in physiology experiments that I used to do, you need to sacrifice an animal every day, you need to kill an animal every day, and very successfully remove its brain in ice, and then dissect the brain into very thin slices.

19:18.008 --> 19:19.428
You can make recordings from those.

19:19.468 --> 19:20.089
That's what I did.

19:21.216 --> 19:44.633
And independent of whether I could justify doing another 10 years of that kind of research or not, or whether I had the right questions to do that kind of research, let's just use this as an experiential example of what I'm trying to say with regard to injecting an animal, like a cow, and then trying to watch the cow to see if anything happens as a result of the injection.

19:44.714 --> 19:46.315
Because with mice,

19:47.853 --> 19:55.394
And this is, again, my experiment is to look at the normal brain of a mouse and look at these circuits in different brain regions.

19:55.454 --> 20:03.816
And so my experiments were reliant on the idea that I could make the same prep every day of the same basic area of the brain.

20:04.856 --> 20:16.518
And sometimes I would cut open what I thought was a very normally behaving mouse and an entire section of the midbrain would be missing.

20:18.464 --> 20:32.890
Now, from a neuroscientist perspective, I would have thought that any of these animals would have this incredible phenotype that you could just see them that, you know, the one in 10,000 animals that's missing most of the midbrain, including the hippocampus.

20:34.795 --> 20:36.256
that would be pretty striking, right?

20:36.296 --> 20:36.856
But you don't.

20:37.256 --> 20:38.496
You don't see that at all.

20:38.597 --> 20:49.361
Somehow or another during development, there's a sufficient compensation that this animal is still able to engage in what looks like normal mouse behavior from the casual observing researcher.

20:49.561 --> 20:54.743
Until you get the head open and you cut open the brain, you're like, oh wow, that's one of those waterheads.

20:55.123 --> 20:55.403
Oops.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.484
Giant ventricles, you know, whatever.

20:58.544 --> 21:00.485
I don't know exactly because we don't care.

21:00.505 --> 21:01.285
We just throw them away.

21:01.826 --> 21:02.786
But the point is,

21:04.574 --> 21:27.906
is that one of the assumptions that took place in probably the late 1800s, as far as Mark can see, is that a technique of treating animals with injectables was rather abruptly transferred to the treatment of humans, especially with regard to vaccination, because the smallpox vaccination was very painful.

21:30.097 --> 21:37.043
because any of these things where they were scratching it into the surface of the skin using a little barbed fork was painful.

21:39.425 --> 21:42.928
And these vets and doctors are sometimes the same guys.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.851
They notice that the animals don't care with a needle injection.

21:45.911 --> 21:50.235
And so, you know, this is an interesting observation

21:52.011 --> 22:01.036
It's an interesting observation that it's so striking that no one's really gone back and tried to analyze in the way that Mark has and how easy it is for Mark to dig up this gold.

22:08.540 --> 22:18.066
And so for this stream, I just want to make sure you understand that what's happening with Mark and what should happen with other people as we move forward

22:18.934 --> 22:25.858
is that people start to understand why I have chosen the words that I have chosen, like intramuscular injection is dumb.

22:27.679 --> 22:39.826
I've chosen those words at first, maybe as a challenge to see, but really, as soon as that combination of words came into my head, I understood that that was the way to approach the problem.

22:39.906 --> 22:46.270
Because again, it is so unbelievably

22:50.091 --> 22:58.434
It is just, it's incredible how easy it is to fall into the trap of using their words and thereby their concepts to argue with them.

22:58.994 --> 23:13.380
And so, even when the illustrious Suzanne Humphreys in 2018 on video said that she doesn't think there is a possibility of making a safe vaccine, she still wasn't there.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.782
Because she was still using their term, vaccine,

23:21.880 --> 23:29.662
And the concept vaccine is part of the enchantment, just like the concept of gain of function is part of the enchantment.

23:29.702 --> 23:36.484
If you say the gain of function research should be banned, you accept that gain of function is real.

23:36.584 --> 23:38.945
Even if you don't think it's real,

23:40.083 --> 23:42.545
but you're for the ban on it.

23:42.685 --> 23:43.225
Do you see?

23:44.066 --> 23:56.534
That's the trap that we have all fallen into, that it feels like we're making progress, but then we always get spun around and we get walked back to the middle of the trap because the semantics is the trap.

23:56.774 --> 24:05.640
When you start using the word vaccine and accept that that's where we start, you're already on their side of the field facing their touchdown.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.661
And so if you start running, you lose.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.623
And this is the trick.

24:10.604 --> 24:22.338
And for a very long time when I was saying intramuscular injection was dumb, there were lots of people telling me that this isn't the right way to say it, you should say it better than that, it's not the right words, but it is.

24:22.498 --> 24:29.246
It really is the exact best, shortest combination of words which challenges this entire narrative.

24:30.572 --> 24:38.938
I'm going to give you a couple examples of how it is that you can see how important it is that that is the statement.

24:39.038 --> 24:42.280
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea.

24:43.081 --> 24:44.021
It is from the late 1800s.

24:44.041 --> 24:47.884
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the early 1800s.

24:47.904 --> 24:52.167
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the early 1800s.

25:02.136 --> 25:17.683
And transfection is a very, very well understood methodology that has been used for decades on the academic bench of almost every biomedical faculty in America.

25:18.043 --> 25:21.024
I would say every, and certainly throughout the West.

25:21.244 --> 25:23.065
And so this is important.

25:32.901 --> 25:34.782
And finally, RNA cannot pandemic.

25:34.842 --> 25:42.728
The thing that Sukrit Bhakti said, well, since it's a settled issue, then we should stop talking about it, which is exactly wrong.

25:43.929 --> 25:54.876
It is a fundamental assumption that we cannot pass on to our children that coronavirus exists and that it can pandemic.

25:54.936 --> 25:56.017
And at the heart of that,

25:57.113 --> 26:05.540
Very detailed myth with lots of subtleties that we have to understand and 1,200 pages of books that we have to read down there.

26:07.201 --> 26:11.124
At the heart of that is the assumption that RNA could possibly do that.

26:12.646 --> 26:26.357
Just like talking about whether or not there's a safe vaccine or whether or not there's a dangerous component or components of vaccines accepts that there is in theory a safe vaccine and a reason to do it.

26:28.826 --> 26:33.250
And more importantly, it assumes that intramuscular injection of stuff is obviously it works.

26:33.310 --> 26:54.129
It's just a question of whether these combinations, that's the why it's so malevolent that after I worked for Bobby Kennedy for a year, that after I worked for CHD for almost a year, after I talked about this with all these people, they have gone on to ignore it instead of use it.

26:57.639 --> 27:04.604
They have gone on to repeat their stuff about mandates and about free speech and our channel got demonetized.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.253
Nobody's lost their job.

27:10.393 --> 27:29.279
I still can't find anybody that lost their job like I did, that got asked to hand in their badge and keys because the faculty doesn't feel safe with you saying that they are lying about the background, that the tests don't work, and that this is transfection and we're not going to transfect our healthy old people.

27:29.779 --> 27:34.441
What is going on here other than absolute malevolence?

27:40.413 --> 27:42.794
Maha is a joke on America, ladies and gentlemen.

27:42.814 --> 27:45.176
It's a very, very bad joke on America.

27:45.856 --> 27:47.317
And we have all fallen for it.

27:47.437 --> 27:48.198
I fell for it.

27:48.218 --> 27:48.998
You fell for it.

27:49.018 --> 27:49.999
We all fell for it.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.221
It's not just these guys.

27:56.382 --> 28:03.126
Although this is one of the more abhorrent manifestations of Maha.

28:04.647 --> 28:05.508
It's all of it.

28:06.641 --> 28:32.089
It's the fact that what should have been the skeptical part, the awake part, the motivated part, the patriotic part of the American populace has been fractionated already in a million pieces because of these people, because of Robert Malone, because of Jessica Rose, because of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., because of Kevin McKernan, because

28:33.149 --> 28:38.111
of Ryan Cole and because of Pierre Cory and because of Peter McCullough.

28:38.891 --> 28:45.273
Those are the reasons why we are so fractured instead of united on very simple ideas.

28:45.974 --> 28:52.076
Like intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the early 1800s or the late 1800s.

28:54.096 --> 29:00.859
Like this was always transfection, that's why that word is on Robert Malone's early resume like 15 times.

29:05.632 --> 29:22.804
And calling this gene therapy is allowing all of this stuff to be generalized across instead of admitting that there are very specific things that we've understood and we've been using for decades and they are limited and it's fine, but you would never put it in healthy people.

29:22.864 --> 29:28.628
And that was my message already in 2020 that got me kicked out of the illustrious group drastic.

29:30.356 --> 29:36.380
and got me admitted into the group of Brett Weinstein for a year before they ignored me for another four.

29:38.782 --> 29:41.644
Here's the latest joke of Maha.

29:42.204 --> 29:44.545
This is from the Peter McCullough sub-stack.

29:46.087 --> 29:50.910
The focal point sub-stack of that Kermit the Frog sounding guy.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.511
Look what we have down here.

29:53.211 --> 29:53.992
Hiroshima.

29:55.689 --> 29:58.871
14 or 140,000 people were killed.

29:59.312 --> 30:02.394
I wonder how many people were killed during the firebombing of Tokyo.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.915
Was it more than 140,000?

30:07.337 --> 30:14.281
Because if it was, then this would be a pretty shitty representation of American history, of world history for that matter.

30:17.523 --> 30:20.525
And this 17 million killed, where does that number come from?

30:22.964 --> 30:31.268
Think about this because I'm trying to show you that the whole script is one malevolent script of coordinated liars.

30:31.508 --> 30:43.355
Even the numbers are chosen and paraded about, and they all coordinatedly are parading about the number that is from Denny Rancor.

30:43.415 --> 30:49.998
This is the silly sub stack, Nicholas Husner, whatever his name is, with a master's in public health.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.839
Come on, come on.

30:54.315 --> 30:57.778
for the McCullough Foundation, courageous discourse.

30:57.838 --> 30:59.700
Boy, this is a joke.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.882
Look at these AI generated images they use.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.605
This is an AI generated image here.

31:08.487 --> 31:16.974
And we're supposed to believe that 17 million people were killed by transfection, but they're not calling it transfection.

31:16.994 --> 31:22.279
They're calling it genetic injections, just like Robert Malone would have scripted them to call it.

31:23.342 --> 31:34.649
And they're not talking about real world history, they're talking about nuclear history because that's the world destruction narrative they want you to focus on, not the firebombing of Tokyo where we killed a lot more people.

31:37.370 --> 31:41.112
That could even, you know, make us even worse as a country.

31:42.113 --> 31:45.315
You can see that this is an orchestrated narrative of fear.

31:47.182 --> 32:03.028
And one of the worst players in it is Denny Rancourt because his paper in 2020 that showed that there was this huge rise in deaths but it had nothing to do, it like respected borders and it looked like it had to do with income and stuff.

32:05.222 --> 32:12.033
This guy has been put in place with writing a hundred figure papers and you know, it's just the most comprehensive.

32:12.053 --> 32:13.255
I just use all the data.

32:13.335 --> 32:17.542
I get all the data from all the countries because I, you know, just use the available data.

32:19.090 --> 32:28.495
but he can't figure out why there might've been an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality in the population pyramid because he just doesn't think it's that.

32:28.535 --> 32:31.977
He's not really sure about what opioid deaths would do in America.

32:32.397 --> 32:34.558
He doesn't think it would really have that big of an effect.

32:34.578 --> 32:44.763
Just like Jessica Rose there in the front row doesn't think that she sees this change in life expectancy in America, but from what she can tell, it's not anything to do with opioids.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.084
Stop lying!

32:47.065 --> 32:51.786
And Denny Rancourt, you know, he can't see that population pyramid would have anything to do with.

32:52.206 --> 32:53.567
Stop lying.

32:54.227 --> 32:56.107
And that's really why these people are there.

32:56.147 --> 33:00.628
And that's why all of these people went to Romania in November of 2023.

33:01.409 --> 33:10.471
There's no way to explain why all these jackasses are on one stage in Romania with Steve Hatfill.

33:11.960 --> 33:17.343
The guy who in 2020 was on Steve Bannon's, yeah, right?

33:17.363 --> 33:33.313
Steve Bannon's podcast, The War Room, saying it was a lab leak, telling us that Barney should wear a mask so the two-year-olds accept it, that we should treat our kids with a rubber apron, and that they should have a separate shitter if they're sick with COVID.

33:33.914 --> 33:39.177
That guy on stage right next to Nick Hudson, the guy who says I'm crazy,

33:41.360 --> 34:10.395
who worked with Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler to promote Claire Craig of the 100,000 Genomes Project, to promote Kevin McKernan of the DNA Contamination Project, to promote Robert Malone of the Domain Project, and then they took this Jason Kristoff to Japan with them for the sixth coronavirus, you know, international summit thing.

34:12.267 --> 34:25.433
And don't forget Brett Weinstein lost his lucrative YouTube channel monetization in 2021 for risking his family's wellbeing by putting Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone on his podcast.

34:25.513 --> 34:26.893
And it turns out they were right.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.094
They were just telling the truth.

34:30.155 --> 34:36.317
Ivermectin works and transfection was dangerous, but Robert Malone took one apparently, two.

34:38.522 --> 34:39.763
And Steve Kirsch did too.

34:40.424 --> 34:43.807
And now Steve Kirsch has some vaccine injury.

34:43.847 --> 34:46.270
So we have to believe everything about Steve Kirsch.

34:47.671 --> 34:50.975
These people are the worst frauds alive.

34:52.836 --> 35:00.104
They should get hit with rotten fruit and vegetables every time they come out in public and somebody recognizes them for the rest of their lives.

35:05.931 --> 35:15.394
I hope they suffer the worst that the internet has to offer in doxing, in canceling, in outing, in public shaming.

35:18.715 --> 35:21.816
And I am saying it, their names are on the screen right now.

35:21.976 --> 35:23.417
Sue me, please.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.365
Because they are all liars.

35:27.445 --> 35:28.826
They are all traitors.

35:28.906 --> 35:31.247
They have all had communications with me.

35:31.748 --> 35:38.311
Sue me so that I can enter my emails and text messages and signal chats into a court document.

35:39.292 --> 35:42.314
You cowardly international traitors.

35:45.580 --> 35:59.112
Denny Rancor was on my show a couple times, and I also was on that Levine podcast once with Denny Rancor when he very specifically lied and said he didn't think population dynamics or opioid crisis had anything to do with this.

36:00.254 --> 36:03.436
He's one of the shittiest people on earth, in Canada at least.

36:06.199 --> 36:09.422
If I saw him in person, I would have a really hard time not swinging.

36:09.842 --> 36:11.584
For a lot of these people, quite frankly.

36:14.380 --> 36:25.106
Thank goodness that Mark told me not to go to the second day of Brownstone in Pittsburgh, or I might have taken a swing at Robert Malone or Brett Weinstein that day.

36:27.468 --> 36:30.170
After I got home from the Saturday, I was just seething.

36:31.050 --> 36:37.434
I couldn't believe that that idiot came over to me and actually had the audacity to touch my name tag.

36:47.140 --> 37:03.588
I have a recording of Harvey Reich where he says that he got COVID for the second time even though he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic and the second time any else was injected and the second time he got it it was even worse than the first so for sure COVID is real.

37:07.679 --> 37:25.691
And so Denny Rancor apparently can't understand this explanation that actually there's an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals that they in no way, shape or form are able to differentiate a coronavirus with a single set of primer pairs or even a couple.

37:26.991 --> 37:37.298
And that there's a reason why it was timed for this particular year for the Donald Trump administration, because there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

37:38.919 --> 37:45.591
What I'm suggesting to you is, is that the first administration of Donald Trump was exactly as planned as this one is.

37:47.054 --> 37:50.921
Even the Biden administration in between was planned.

37:52.048 --> 37:53.148
It's orchestrated.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.829
This is a show.

37:54.989 --> 38:00.270
It is a national security priority to get us to believe in a pandemic.

38:00.711 --> 38:09.353
So therefore the national security priority required that they control the White House and HHS for about 12 years at least.

38:11.874 --> 38:12.334
Probably 25.

38:13.014 --> 38:18.876
It's a higher priority than nukes were.

38:21.684 --> 38:22.985
They're sparing no expense.

38:23.486 --> 38:27.129
They're bankrupting the country and giving up the dollars.

38:28.215 --> 38:33.518
you know, role as reserve currency while they do it.

38:33.958 --> 38:52.667
While they extract the remaining wealth from America and turn it into this, you know, first iteration infrastructure of a global server data set that could, you know, in theory, take a lot of medical records and interface them with a lot of genetic sequences and try to make something of it.

38:54.047 --> 38:55.528
They gotta spin it up somehow.

38:57.045 --> 39:08.595
And so the way that they did it was they put shitheads like Denny Rancourt out there and kept them on script and made sure that although he talked to me for three years, he never absorbed anything.

39:09.857 --> 39:13.380
And make sure that when he went over to Romania,

39:15.216 --> 39:24.241
that when all these people came home, when Jessica Rose came home, when, when Brett Weinstein came home and Robert Malone came home, they all did a sub stack.

39:24.281 --> 39:33.085
They all did a podcast and said, wow, I saw such an amazing presentation in Romania by this guy by the name of Denny Rancourt.

39:33.585 --> 39:38.668
And he says that 17 million people were killed by the shots.

39:40.441 --> 39:54.308
And here we are in 2025, almost two years later, and Kermit the Frog on McCullough's Foundation substack is saying 17 million people were killed.

39:54.508 --> 39:58.691
Isn't that just a wonderful little shit script that we're on?

40:00.672 --> 40:03.133
With these shithead scripted bullshitters?

40:04.906 --> 40:12.408
that really, they just can't see that there is an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality coming already in 1990.

40:14.349 --> 40:15.849
And it's really visible and well at 2000.

40:16.429 --> 40:26.772
And that that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality needed to be planned for, was planned for, and they used it for the most malevolent purposes possible.

40:27.192 --> 40:30.453
They used it to both manage

40:31.414 --> 40:39.217
the population pyramid, and also to permanently install this mythology that intramuscular injection is good.

40:40.858 --> 40:42.538
They're not doing it to themselves.

40:44.719 --> 40:46.960
They're not augmenting themselves with this.

40:47.020 --> 40:50.821
And if they are, then they too are bamboozled by this nonsense.

40:50.861 --> 40:51.562
And that's okay.

40:52.582 --> 40:55.763
We are not, and our children will not be.

40:57.524 --> 41:00.545
But these scripted actors are paid to lie about why people die.

41:04.693 --> 41:06.075
That's the real simple truth.

41:06.315 --> 41:11.122
These scripted actors are paid to lie about why people die.

41:14.367 --> 41:19.274
And they all belong in jail in whatever respective country for which they hold a passport.

41:25.599 --> 41:38.652
I'm not sure exactly who... I thought it would be interesting to play this through a little bit, just so you realize that in 2023, these scripted bullshitters really, really revealed themselves for the fuckwits that they are.

41:39.393 --> 41:48.062
Because remember, this is a response to a letter that I wrote as staff scientist of CHD, where I tried to explain to CHD and to them at the same letter

41:49.062 --> 41:56.609
that we're both kind of confused about the fidelity of the PCR and the fidelity of what is called virology.

41:57.050 --> 42:10.062
And they overcome this, they bamboozle us by making recombinant versions of the sequences that they find and then apply them, transfect them in animals or cell culture and call that virology.

42:10.483 --> 42:11.364
And that letter

42:12.950 --> 42:27.059
which was genuinely an attempt at that time, because I still thought CHD were good guys, to bring the no-virus people on the same side of CHD under a... Holy shit, what is this?

42:27.899 --> 42:27.999
Oh.

42:31.161 --> 42:35.524
Sometimes they fight over the holes in the, fight over the egg boxes.

42:36.365 --> 42:36.485
Um...

42:40.217 --> 42:41.058
Oh, violence.

42:43.320 --> 42:48.525
And so what I thought was going to happen was that they would realize, wow, we can talk about this differently.

42:49.085 --> 42:52.909
We could say it the same as they say it, and we might make progress.

42:52.969 --> 42:56.452
We could say that virology is a lot of hocus pocus.

42:56.532 --> 43:04.820
But what we do know is that they can make large quantities of pure DNA or large quantities of pure RNA, and they can put it places.

43:06.519 --> 43:08.361
And this is the response to this.

43:08.561 --> 43:13.125
And think about how disingenuous it is that this is the response.

43:14.206 --> 43:19.851
Yes, his name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

43:20.712 --> 43:27.478
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

43:28.680 --> 43:41.746
But what I really wanted to preface this event with is this has been, I think, it's nice because this is admittedly by Tom Cowan himself an event.

43:42.547 --> 43:55.453
It is an event where all five of these Jedi masters of the no virus movement are getting together to respond to a staff scientist working under Brian Hooker and Mary Holland at CHD

43:56.153 --> 43:58.975
And that staff scientist is named Jonathan Cooey.

43:59.736 --> 44:02.577
It's an event in 2023.

44:04.299 --> 44:05.279
This didn't happen.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.601
They didn't do an event for Jessica Rose.

44:09.142 --> 44:12.664
They didn't do an event to respond to Robert Malone's claims.

44:13.044 --> 44:17.768
They didn't do an event to respond to Robert F. Kennedy Jr's claims for shit's sake.

44:18.908 --> 44:19.689
Do you see this?

44:23.032 --> 44:30.696
It's unfortunate, but nobody else on earth can claim that so many events took place regarding the stuff they were trying to teach.

44:30.816 --> 44:31.197
Nobody.

44:33.078 --> 44:33.478
Nobody.

44:36.359 --> 44:45.605
For all of us, I'll speak for myself, but I may be able to speak for the rest of us, a kind of bizarre and frustrating few years.

44:47.339 --> 45:01.853
And I've often asked myself, why has this been so frustrating and so difficult to have a conversation that resolves the questions around virology?

45:02.994 --> 45:09.500
Why has it been so difficult to come to any agreements between, quote, both sides?

45:10.899 --> 45:16.164
And now see, he's addressing the fact that that's what that letter I wrote is trying to do.

45:16.844 --> 45:24.030
He's admitting that I'm trying to say that you're both right about things, you're both kind of overgeneralizing about things.

45:24.651 --> 45:27.794
CHD assumes that there's a lab leak, which is ridiculous.

45:28.871 --> 45:30.972
Because viruses can't do that.

45:31.633 --> 45:34.915
RNA can't do that, was what I should have been saying, but I wasn't there yet.

45:35.035 --> 45:41.439
You see, this progress that I'm making, these people never made that progress for five years plus.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.742
Because Tom Cowan has a book from 2018, you know, the same year.

45:46.883 --> 45:52.085
that Suzanne Humphreys is on film multiple times saying she doesn't think there are any safe vaccines.

45:52.505 --> 46:09.711
So still kind of falling on her face because she's using vaccines as a term and admitting that that's the argument that should be had instead of saying something like, I don't know if intramuscular injection is actually a good idea because actually we've been doing it since the late 1800s.

46:10.132 --> 46:13.453
And so that assumption is just kind of baked in.

46:14.133 --> 46:18.447
for a couple generations now, and none of these people have ever been able to get there.

46:19.069 --> 46:20.694
The illustrious Andy Kaufman.

46:21.516 --> 46:29.040
The, the multiple books Bailey team, two doctors in one family haven't been able to get there yet.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.940
They're so focused on virology.

46:31.321 --> 46:45.087
And what's so bizarre is that if you don't think there are any viruses, then you must also believe that there are, there's no safe vaccine, which would then mean that actually intramuscular injection might be ridiculous, but none of them have ever gotten there.

46:47.728 --> 46:49.109
None of them have ever gotten there.

46:50.626 --> 47:16.494
How is it possible that with only five years of hard work, three of which were done under extreme duress because I was surrounded by jackasses on a script, how is it that after like a year and a half of being completely free of these people, I have come to the point where I can say it better than anybody alive.

47:17.878 --> 47:23.301
I don't think I can say it better than Tony Bark, and I don't think I'm saying it any better than Brandy Vaughn did, but they're both dead.

47:28.344 --> 47:29.465
Who else says it better?

47:30.606 --> 47:32.927
Who even comes close to saying it anymore?

47:35.029 --> 47:41.913
Pierre Cory blew the lid off SIDS, but that still doesn't really blow the lid off of shit, now does it?

47:43.442 --> 48:07.853
Especially if it's only done on Steve Kirsch's podcast and on Twitter and on all these other shitty places where again only our conservative health freedom movement is It's impossible that these people never got there I think there's actually a very simple answer to that and that is when you look at

48:09.238 --> 48:24.487
The central issue, which is what we talk about, which is, is there evidence or proof that these so-called pathogenic viruses actually exist?

48:24.728 --> 48:38.236
Now, wouldn't it be spectacular if in 2023 they had already arrived at the fact that, actually, the most important question to ask is, is there any evidence that intramuscular injection is a good idea?

48:43.433 --> 48:48.478
We already know the virus story that they tell us is exaggerated.

48:48.519 --> 48:51.322
And that would have been the better way for them to say it.

48:51.382 --> 48:54.145
Not, there are zero viruses.

48:55.222 --> 49:03.847
But whatever signal they are finding or saying they're finding in the background is so ridiculously exaggerated, we shouldn't pay attention to it.

49:03.887 --> 49:10.351
Instead, we should be asking better questions like, is intramuscular injection even a justified methodology?

49:11.092 --> 49:23.319
Or are they using this elaborate mythology about disease and their high-fidelity understanding of it to bamboozle us into accepting something as dumb as intramuscular injection?

49:25.666 --> 49:29.667
And the only conclusion I can come to is that these people are scripted.

49:30.068 --> 49:40.791
They can't be stupid enough not to have gotten there already, especially because for the last two and a half years, I've been saying it well, and they must be aware of it.

49:43.252 --> 49:45.573
And so that's, what's so magnificent about it.

49:46.813 --> 49:48.554
It's so easy just to say it.

49:50.453 --> 49:54.036
Say that Robert Malone knew these were transfections from the very beginning.

49:54.496 --> 49:59.900
Say that Stephen Hatfield said to us on Tommy's podcast that Robert Malone is not transfected.

49:59.940 --> 50:03.222
So he must've lied on Brett Weinstein's podcast.

50:03.242 --> 50:13.749
And so Brett Weinstein not knowing that he lied is actually kind of shocking because they're all on the same stage in Romania in November of 2023, which means he probably knows that he lied.

50:16.171 --> 50:18.052
They've done international travel together.

50:18.072 --> 50:19.613
How could he not know that he lied?

50:22.247 --> 50:32.916
You see, this is the problem, is that we don't break free because we think that the way we break free is still social media, that we can use social media to break free and we cannot.

50:34.017 --> 50:40.642
No amount of tweeting, no amount of retweeting is ever gonna break this spell because these people are programmed in.

50:42.324 --> 50:49.830
The interesting thing, and I know we've talked about this a lot, but I'm not sure if people completely appreciate this,

50:53.277 --> 50:55.440
Maybe I'm going to let that play just a little while longer.

50:57.042 --> 50:58.924
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

50:59.024 --> 51:04.310
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

51:04.330 --> 51:09.917
A very simple answer to that, and that is when you look at

51:11.303 --> 51:23.427
The central issue, which is what we talk about, which is, is there evidence or proof that these so-called pathogenic viruses?

51:23.527 --> 51:30.109
See, the problem is, if you believe there are no pathogenic viruses, that's not where you stay.

51:31.129 --> 51:31.510
OK?

51:31.930 --> 51:32.790
That's the problem.

51:35.034 --> 51:38.857
And that's the problem that you can see with these people not making progress.

51:39.057 --> 51:58.753
If, if in 2018, Suzanne Humphries was able to say that she didn't think there were any safe vaccines, that it's not possible because that's antithetical to our immune system, then sometime between 2018 and now she could have gotten to the point where she said, well, maybe the whole idea of injecting stuff is dumb because Brandy Vaughn was saying that.

52:00.879 --> 52:06.704
on stage, the same stage that Suzanne Humphries has been on at the same days.

52:09.367 --> 52:11.288
And so it's just as suspect.

52:12.025 --> 52:25.772
that somebody like Suzanne Humphries kinda said it in 2018, but if you analyze it well, she actually didn't, because she said, I don't think vaccines can be done, assumes that a vaccine is a thing.

52:26.292 --> 52:35.596
Whereas her stage mate, Brandy Vaughn, was already saying that, no, it's injection versus ingestion that you should be teaching people.

52:36.057 --> 52:39.318
This is the stark contrast, and that is

52:41.664 --> 53:00.756
why they're dead and why those people are still in front of us that is why these malevolent shitheads have been on stage with bobby kennedy and brian hooker in 21 and 22 because this is all one malevolent show and sometime in 2021 they spread out to do more damage

53:01.638 --> 53:09.443
and to herd more cats and keep those little cat herds separate from each other so that they would never come together.

53:09.503 --> 53:13.345
Just like, I can't believe that we can't come together under some understanding.

53:13.665 --> 53:18.748
Hey, we can't come together because of these shitheads right here, because that is their job.

53:20.529 --> 53:21.690
Actually exist.

53:23.157 --> 53:37.378
Now, the interesting thing, and I know we've talked about this a lot, but I'm not sure if people completely appreciate this, is that the way to answer that question is extremely clear.

53:38.883 --> 53:47.767
The way you should do it is you make essentially a definition of what you're looking for.

53:48.047 --> 53:52.548
And here we go, I could destroy this because it's so stupid.

53:52.608 --> 53:53.909
Now I remember what he says.

53:55.069 --> 53:56.130
He's gonna tell you...

53:57.202 --> 54:06.386
that what we have to do is establish the model of virology and then show them that they never establish it.

54:06.466 --> 54:13.548
So the model of virology is a replication-competent particle that makes copies of itself.

54:15.769 --> 54:16.109
You see?

54:16.830 --> 54:19.831
And that is absolutely the shittiest way to win.

54:20.936 --> 54:31.944
because none of the virology papers, none of the virologists, none of the virology books claim that they have definitive evidence of all the minor details of how this is done.

54:32.404 --> 54:34.065
They have indirect evidence of it.

54:34.806 --> 54:44.453
And their hypotheses always are based on null hypotheses, which accept these indirect proxies, like, you know, a PCR signal.

54:48.436 --> 54:52.998
And these people have never really usefully attacked that.

54:53.178 --> 55:01.961
Instead, what they have done is reinforce this idea that there might be, and that's it, right?

55:02.401 --> 55:02.941
The question.

55:03.141 --> 55:10.924
They have reinforced the idea that the question is, are there replication competent particles in nature?

55:13.132 --> 55:19.777
And if virology hasn't proven that there are replication-competent particles in nature, then obviously there are no particles in nature.

55:19.898 --> 55:21.139
See how stupid it is?

55:22.259 --> 55:24.021
But that's exactly what he's gonna say right now.

55:25.097 --> 55:34.742
which we have, you know, a replication-competent protein coat genetic interior that, you know, replicates in living cells.

55:35.442 --> 55:40.985
And you go look for that in various, quote, infected animal plants.

55:41.005 --> 55:46.888
Now remember, this letter that I sent them was specifically about the idea that they don't have any direct evidence for that.

55:47.836 --> 55:57.382
And more importantly, what they do is they take their purported sequence and they make a large pure quantity of it and they put it in places and call that virology.

55:57.862 --> 56:00.784
And these people are never going to acknowledge that that's right.

56:01.465 --> 56:03.086
These people are never going to explain it.

56:03.971 --> 56:10.794
They're never gonna say what, you know, what Jonathan Cooley is trying to say is actually real, because we've looked at a lot of papers and it's actually what they do.

56:11.274 --> 56:22.139
Sometimes they actually co-transfect the whole coronavirus sequence with the end protein sequence separately, and then they get a lot more particles getting packaged.

56:23.739 --> 56:26.180
Because I sent those papers to them and they don't care.

56:26.320 --> 56:29.842
They don't give a shit that the virology,

56:30.928 --> 56:32.389
illusion is breakable.

56:32.549 --> 56:41.774
They don't want to break it, because if they break it, they will reveal that that virology is just testing transfection under the guise of this bullshit.

56:42.815 --> 56:43.975
It has always been that.

56:45.136 --> 56:53.441
And even our use of transfection on the on the bench in academia is testing all the same technology.

56:54.161 --> 56:57.003
It's just that in virology, they can play with

56:59.164 --> 57:03.928
with what they purport to find in nature as homologues of this kind of stuff.

57:03.988 --> 57:05.349
We have exosomes.

57:05.989 --> 57:10.612
We know how particles can be targeted for specific places in the body.

57:11.193 --> 57:22.061
We have just been lied to about the fact that this irreducibly complex genetic background of signals that are relevant to us and signals that are relevant to our microbiome around us

57:23.433 --> 57:33.399
are there, and none of these people have ever bothered to explain that as a one of the many weaknesses of the idea of a pandemic based on RNA.

57:34.019 --> 57:42.084
They've just never gotten there because the central issue is to establish what they were saying and then see if they find it.

57:44.326 --> 57:46.407
This is a super jackass here.

57:47.688 --> 57:49.108
A scripted shithead.

57:49.649 --> 57:51.070
Ant or human tissue.

57:52.182 --> 57:54.364
That's the way we look for most things.

57:54.984 --> 58:16.441
Now, we all know and we all agree that, and Christine knows this better than anybody, because... Remember, last week, or this week, actually, no, it's last week, Sasha Latupova claims that Christine Massey is one of her worst Looney Tunes that she's had to ban on Substack.

58:18.612 --> 58:31.258
But Christine Massey is actually the one that was goading me to write this email and then goaded me afterward to provide more literature for them to read and proof that there were infectious clones.

58:31.298 --> 58:34.439
And then when I didn't do it, they did this, this event.

58:38.221 --> 58:39.602
These are scripted liars.

58:39.662 --> 58:42.683
They are scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

58:42.703 --> 58:44.644
They were probably recruited by them too.

58:47.318 --> 58:50.281
These are all really, really shitty people.

58:53.364 --> 58:57.388
And they're breakable because some of them do have a little hint of morals.

58:57.468 --> 59:00.671
I think Mark Bailey could be breakable, for example.

59:01.792 --> 59:04.996
We have hundreds now of answers.

59:07.375 --> 59:14.581
And so that's the reason why Mark Bailey and Sam Bailey and Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan, you know, they all have books.

59:15.042 --> 59:16.103
They're all really smart.

59:16.143 --> 59:26.552
Tom Cowan had a book in 2018 about the changing nature of childhood illness, but he's never gotten to the point where he could say that confounding

59:27.992 --> 59:37.218
a nearly endless variety of early childhood neurological disorders with intramuscular injected injury

59:38.320 --> 59:40.580
is the malevolent game these people are playing.

59:40.601 --> 59:41.821
They've never been able to get there.

59:42.121 --> 59:52.683
They've never been able to say that autism spectrum disorder is like a giant myth that's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned because they don't question it either.

59:53.363 --> 59:56.024
They just question the existence of viruses, you see?

59:56.484 --> 59:59.484
And they also don't really question virology.

59:59.524 --> 01:00:01.805
They question the existence of viruses.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:06.426
If you wanted to question virology, you would get virologists to see.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:12.513
that what they do is they order a synthetic sequence and then they put it on their cell culture.

01:00:12.553 --> 01:00:13.816
That's not virology.

01:00:15.398 --> 01:00:17.903
That's Human Genome Project molecular biology.

01:00:22.557 --> 01:00:30.642
And they will never say this, that public health will never be questioned as a reason so long as this stuff is believed.

01:00:30.662 --> 01:00:40.008
They just focus on viruses and no viruses and purification and isolation and culturing.

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:44.111
Doing control experiments.

01:00:46.533 --> 01:00:48.734
These people are just obnoxious liars.

01:00:48.914 --> 01:00:51.916
It's really sad, but they are not obnoxious liars.

01:00:51.956 --> 01:01:07.606
We're supposed to believe that Denny Rancourt and all those people on that stage in Romania in 2023 can't figure out that there was this, you know, anticipated rise in all cause mortality that you can see in Denny's own graphs, but that that's just normal.

01:01:08.006 --> 01:01:14.430
So what he's done is essentially taken that anticipated rise in all cause mortality and subtracted it.

01:01:16.314 --> 01:01:21.939
from these numbers so that there is no excess deaths, because we expected those people to die.

01:01:25.022 --> 01:01:29.126
Anybody that died after the age of expected deaths was an expected death, right?

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:32.609
So then those can be removed from the excess deaths.

01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:34.751
That's exactly what Denny Rancor has done.

01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:44.234
so as to create the illusion that this wasn't anticipated, that those numbers aren't real and couldn't be misconstrued as a spreading novel virus.

01:01:44.654 --> 01:01:52.345
Denny Rancourt is one of the shittiest Canadians alive, because after being presented a few times with this list by myself,

01:01:53.792 --> 01:02:13.544
and having a discussion with him on another Canadian podcast about the supplementary oxygen, about the anticipated rise sculpted by manslaughter and lies, by the lack of antibiotic use, by the opioid deaths and how they contributed to the false illusion that COVID had decreased all cause more, sorry, life expectancy in America.

01:02:16.306 --> 01:02:22.710
Denny Rancourt just pretended not to understand it even though he makes, you know, hundred figure papers about this shit.

01:02:24.096 --> 01:02:42.403
has analyzed the data from all the countries and stuff, you know, like, like, Robert Malone screened all the nutraceuticals in the FDA catalog, you know, like, like, Charles Rixey has read all the papers, you know, like, like Scott Shara has done 4000 hours of research.

01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:49.493
You're very welcome to CounterPoint.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:56.418
On this episode, we have a pretty dramatic presentation of a protected disclosure.

01:02:56.739 --> 01:03:04.885
Now, what I'm going to do this for is because there are parts that she gets really wonderfully right and there are parts where she gets wonderfully wrong because

01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:10.749
She is still unaware that Denny Rancor is part of this illusion.

01:03:10.809 --> 01:03:12.550
I want you to hear it, and then we'll listen on.

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:13.831
Maybe I'll find more stuff.

01:03:14.372 --> 01:03:20.415
But the reason why I'm showing this right now, just because I only watched the beginning and already caught this, and so I want to point it out.

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:28.921
Because it's really bad, and we can strengthen their position if they start to understand that this Denny Rancor is a meddler.

01:03:31.596 --> 01:03:37.923
under the Protected Disclosure Amendment Act 2022 by a senior pharmacist in this country.

01:03:38.383 --> 01:03:43.468
And here to talk to me about it, a senior counsel and Masters of International Relations, Una McGurk.

01:03:43.548 --> 01:03:45.090
Una, you're very welcome to Counterpoint.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.191
Thank you very much, Eddie.

01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:47.092
It's a pleasure to be here.

01:03:47.412 --> 01:03:50.893
First question I want to ask you, so people understand the kind of framework here.

01:03:51.314 --> 01:03:55.335
What is this Protected Disclosure Act that has been used by the pharmacist?

01:03:56.116 --> 01:04:06.560
And can you explain the difference between the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland?

01:04:07.099 --> 01:04:07.379
Indeed.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.923
Well, first of all, the Protected Disclosures Act is really known as the whistleblower's legislation.

01:04:13.203 --> 01:04:13.283
OK.

01:04:13.663 --> 01:04:18.686
Because somebody who is a whistleblower will make what's known as a protected disclosure.

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:21.968
And they can do that to any one of three bodies.

01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:31.514
They can do it to a minister, they can do it to the ombudsman for the protected disclosures, or they can do it to prescribed bodies under the Act.

01:04:32.094 --> 01:04:38.683
So in this particular case, this pharmacist that you have referred to has made a disclosure to the minister.

01:04:38.743 --> 01:04:43.430
In this case, it's the Minister for Health under Section 8 of the Act.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.172
That's Jennifer Carole MacNeill currently?

01:04:45.233 --> 01:04:45.653
Correct.

01:04:46.718 --> 01:04:56.686
But what this disclosure is, me being here today, is a disclosure under Section 10 of the Act, which is a disclosure other than one under 7 or 8.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:05:02.131
And it can be made in certain circumstances, where, for example, the person who's making

01:05:02.631 --> 01:05:13.855
that the protected disclosure, which is the pharmacist you've referred to, has previously made a disclosure of essentially the same material and nothing has happened.

01:05:13.995 --> 01:05:25.860
So in this particular case, the pharmacist in question has been making disclosures to two bodies in particular, effectively over the last four years, and nothing has happened.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:35.828
And in addition to making the disclosures to these two bodies, on each occasion, he cc'd the Minister for Health, who was Stephen Donnelly.

01:05:35.908 --> 01:05:45.515
So the former Minister for Health and the Department of Health are very well aware of the disclosures that have already been made by this particular pharmacist.

01:05:45.796 --> 01:05:47.257
OK, so I'm going to leave it playing.

01:05:47.297 --> 01:05:54.483
But just to get to the chase, the disclosure by this pharmacist is that there was a shit ton of midazolam used to kill old people in Ireland.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:06:00.172
in a way that should never have been used.

01:06:00.453 --> 01:06:01.695
And they don't give a shit, right?

01:06:01.735 --> 01:06:04.340
Because it was part of managing the population pyramid.

01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:15.006
So he decided that he was going, at this stage, to make a formal, direct disclosure to the minister because he'd had enough.

01:06:15.747 --> 01:06:17.148
And that's what's happening.

01:06:17.448 --> 01:06:18.889
And so that's what he has done.

01:06:19.389 --> 01:06:23.671
And he has asked me if I would do this today.

01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:27.514
And I'm very honored to be here to do this because, as you probably know, Eddie,

01:06:28.294 --> 01:06:34.518
anyone and everyone who makes a disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act is entitled to their anonymity.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:38.260
So I can't take credit for anything that's contained herein.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:46.325
I've been given this information and I'm happy to bring it to your attention because the information contained in here is really quite shocking.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.706
It's a very profound document.

01:06:48.726 --> 01:06:51.468
This is a copy of the actual disclosure.

01:06:51.528 --> 01:06:52.709
It's 16 pages long.

01:06:54.153 --> 01:07:08.225
It consists of very technical medical information with links to various peer reviewed independent studies from scientists and doctors, independent scientists and doctors at the highest level.

01:07:08.765 --> 01:07:18.594
And there's also a backup document, which is almost 100 pages detailing the correspondence that this particular individual that we call him the whistleblower

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:27.521
has had with various bodies, but in particular, the two that you've just mentioned, which are the PSI and the HPRA.

01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:33.406
Now, the PSI... I just want to make one point because it bothers me a lot now that I understand it.

01:07:33.546 --> 01:07:41.773
The term whistleblower in American law specifically applies to somebody who spoke up in their own

01:07:43.777 --> 01:07:49.241
authority chain in their own hierarchy and then were retaliated against.

01:07:49.742 --> 01:08:03.853
So you, in order to be a whistleblower, you need to be a guy who went to the Dean of University of Pittsburgh and said that this is a transfection and we shouldn't be calling it a vaccine.

01:08:04.473 --> 01:08:10.218
We all know that because we all transfect our animals and then you get fired for doing that.

01:08:10.698 --> 01:08:11.859
Then you're a whistleblower.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.301
Sounds like somebody I know.

01:08:16.264 --> 01:08:29.139
Anyway, if you don't go up the chain first and try to work through your employment chain first or through the government chain first of hierarchy and then get punished for it, you're not a whistleblower.

01:08:30.401 --> 01:08:32.183
You're just some dude who's running his mouth.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:45.940
Make sure that you understand that because they use that term very loosely on purpose so that people don't understand when you have protection as a whistleblower.

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.064
Like maybe I would have protection as a whistleblower because

01:08:50.945 --> 01:09:17.259
because the University of Pittsburgh fired me, but did the CHD even consider the possibility or did any legal organization in America, any lawyer consider the possibility that I as a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh with more than 15 years experience that included a postdoc in the recent Nobel Prize winning lab would have any recourse in terms of speaking out and now it turns out that I was kind of right?

01:09:18.422 --> 01:09:19.402
Does anybody care?

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:23.364
Does my friend Jay Bhattacharya, who was also supposedly censored, care?

01:09:23.384 --> 01:09:29.407
Does Brett Weinstein, who was censored while I was in his signal chat, does he care?

01:09:31.148 --> 01:09:32.329
None of these people care.

01:09:32.509 --> 01:09:43.074
Does our Health and Human Services Secretary, who employed me for more than a year to help him write his book, does he care that actually I was fired by a medical school in America?

01:09:47.915 --> 01:09:57.298
with ties to the deep state with, with University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh has all kinds of stuff going on there.

01:09:57.738 --> 01:10:08.901
One of the papers was that was written about the reversed Moderna sequence that was found in the SARS-CoV sequence was written by some guy who does breast cancer research there.

01:10:09.601 --> 01:10:15.263
That guy offered me, took me out for coffee in 2021 to make sure that I understood his paper.

01:10:18.203 --> 01:10:46.808
Who's the whistleblower in this story if it isn't me telling you that the Health and Human Services Secretary is a scripted fool, that Jay Bhattacharya has got to be a scripted fool, and that not only am I a whistleblower with regard to what happened at the University of Pittsburgh, but I'm telling you that the nonprofit CHD is a scripted fraud, that Mary Holland is a traitor to our grandchildren,

01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:54.679
And that they fired me for talking about Robert Malone and defending Bobby Kennedy and CHD.

01:10:56.361 --> 01:11:01.167
Because Robert Malone said that CHD was a mismanaged organization on Twitter.

01:11:01.827 --> 01:11:03.269
It was almost like they trapped me.

01:11:03.309 --> 01:11:05.852
I wonder how many other people saw that tweet on Twitter.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.491
I'm the real deal.

01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:17.015
I'm one of the only people who can claim to be the real deal with regard to COVID.

01:11:17.195 --> 01:11:19.736
Everybody else on social media is part of it.

01:11:22.098 --> 01:11:26.401
Or trying to fight the empire on social media.

01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:32.465
And that means you're just essentially in a chair with goggles on shooting TIE fighters and you're never going to win anything.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:39.242
And this lady is somewhat bamboozled as well, although it's a very specific bamboozlement.

01:11:39.582 --> 01:11:41.785
And maybe she's not even a bamboozled person.

01:11:42.245 --> 01:11:46.089
It's just that the promotion of Denny Rancourt is a mistake here.

01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:50.293
We don't need to do that, but she's promoting his early paper.

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:53.035
You see, his early paper is okay.

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.897
The one that he put out in May is okay.

01:11:55.984 --> 01:12:03.094
The one that he keeps putting out later and later where he keeps explaining that it looks like all the excess mortality came after the shot.

01:12:03.575 --> 01:12:04.356
That's the lie.

01:12:06.879 --> 01:12:07.701
Those are big lies.

01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:09.739
Society of Ireland.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:10.119
Correct.

01:12:10.499 --> 01:12:12.041
Now, this is a statutory body.

01:12:12.201 --> 01:12:17.247
Both of them, by the way, are statutory bodies, which means they have obligations to the taxpayer.

01:12:18.388 --> 01:12:29.180
And the PSI is a statutory body whose role is the regulator responsible for pharmacists in order to protect the health, safety

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:45.711
I actually did try to correct things internally though because I requested that Robert Malone be taken off the reading list and I told CHD and the reading list that I thought that Robert Malone was a trainer and that he should not be allowed to see the writing of this Wuhan cover-up book.

01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:51.632
And when the Wuhan cover-up book was published and on the back of it was Robert Malone, I was pretty upset.

01:12:54.150 --> 01:13:00.693
And as far as I can tell now, Robert Malone was only removed from the document where it said who the readers are.

01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:02.633
He had access to the book the whole time.

01:13:04.934 --> 01:13:05.995
I guarantee it.

01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:09.636
And so I definitely whistle blew.

01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:18.099
I blew the whistle to Brian Hooker repeatedly over and over again, including the fact that I thought that Mary Holland was also working against CHD.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.400
So I don't know.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.161
I feel like I'm the real deal.

01:13:22.955 --> 01:13:24.177
and well-being of patients.

01:13:24.217 --> 01:13:30.645
And this is very important and will become more crucial as we go into the information that's disclosed in the document.

01:13:31.285 --> 01:13:37.914
They have a statutory duty to recognize and respond to potential harms

01:13:38.594 --> 01:13:41.637
relevant to the protection of their patients.

01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:46.040
That's a very significant statutory duty.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:53.145
Now in preparation for this discussion with you, you know, somebody of your vast experience looking at a document as technical as this and so on.

01:13:53.686 --> 01:13:55.868
I went through it a couple of times just as a lay person.

01:13:56.388 --> 01:14:03.914
And it seems to me that notwithstanding what you just said about the kind of non-response that this pharmacist has had over the last four years and now using this

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:09.919
nuclear option, really, I suppose, in one sense, of a protected disclosure.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:25.113
It seems to me that the allegations being made, backed by evidence, which we'll get into, seem to centre on suppressed evidence, cancer risk, fraud, ethical breaches, these are my notes, endangerment of life, financial corruption and regulatory collapse.

01:14:25.153 --> 01:14:26.794
So, I mean, that's what you mean by

01:14:27.675 --> 01:14:29.176
by pretty serious allegations.

01:14:29.196 --> 01:14:33.497
We're talking here about corruption at the highest levels within the state.

01:14:33.697 --> 01:14:36.478
So the information contained in this document is quite shocking.

01:14:36.498 --> 01:14:37.659
And I'll come into that in a moment.

01:14:37.719 --> 01:14:43.981
But I just want to tell you about the HPRA, which is the Health Products Regulatory Authority.

01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:52.204
And their website, in describing their ethos, uses words like integrity, excellence, innovation,

01:14:52.984 --> 01:15:03.087
patient focused in describing their values for their mission, which is that of regulating medicines and products for the benefit of people and animals.

01:15:03.307 --> 01:15:19.211
And when we go through the evidence, you know, the statutory functions of these two organizations will become very relevant and it will become very apparent to the listeners and to the viewers that they are not carrying out their statutory functions.

01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:20.631
And that's just putting it mildly.

01:15:20.922 --> 01:15:21.842
Now, can I just pause you there?

01:15:21.862 --> 01:15:24.363
I just want to bring up something for viewers to see.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:37.447
It's diving straight into the middle and we'll go back to the start, which is what happened at the start of COVID, which we recall was quarter one, quarter two, 2020, and then kind of repeated itself 12 months later.

01:15:37.487 --> 01:15:40.268
Can I just bring that up on screen next?

01:15:40.288 --> 01:15:43.949
I want to comment on this because it's in the protected disclosure.

01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:46.477
So here's the midazolam injections.

01:15:46.777 --> 01:15:48.378
April, they killed some people.

01:15:48.538 --> 01:15:50.938
January, February, March, they killed some people.

01:15:51.418 --> 01:15:54.659
This is very similar to the manslaughter that occurred in America.

01:15:58.079 --> 01:16:02.540
And in this case, they have midazolam to explain for it in these care homes.

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:13.382
But in America, it was probably a combination of things that always started with supplementary oxygen at the start so that a certain percentage of people would inevitably progress

01:16:14.423 --> 01:16:16.724
through to this ARDS symptom set.

01:16:19.365 --> 01:16:23.126
And so this is pretty remarkable because this is manslaughter, it's murder.

01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:33.670
If we start at the beginning, okay, first of all, and I think this is relevant because obviously this is- And just like in Scotland, nobody wants to talk about 2020.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:36.151
So this is a very remarkable video.

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:37.850
very technical document.

01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:39.430
I'm not going to read it out.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.691
That will be very boring for the viewer.

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:45.453
So what I'm going to do is deal with it in a narrative form in chronological order.

01:16:45.573 --> 01:16:47.174
So we'll get to Midazolam when you're ready then.

01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:48.274
OK, so I'm sorry.

01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:50.055
So it will be very quick, I promise.

01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:50.996
I'm nearly there.

01:16:51.436 --> 01:16:56.999
So basically, in March 2020, as you know, we had the WHO declared the pandemic, right?

01:16:57.839 --> 01:16:59.620
Then we had the commencement of the lockdowns.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.522
That was basically at the end of March.

01:17:01.562 --> 01:17:03.143
I think it was the last weekend in March.

01:17:03.223 --> 01:17:16.012
OK, now, it was very clear to everyone at that time that there were no deaths in the community, notwithstanding the disturbing images that we saw being beamed in from Wuhan and Italy and places like that.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:16.712
Yeah, the propaganda.

01:17:17.052 --> 01:17:17.433
Exactly.

01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:20.137
And, you know, that's that's a story for another day.

01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:21.439
We could do another video on that.

01:17:21.499 --> 01:17:22.601
But this is what was happening.

01:17:22.641 --> 01:17:26.527
And yet everyone noticed that nobody was dying in the community.

01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:31.835
People were going about their daily jobs and nobody was healing over on the street, thankfully.

01:17:31.995 --> 01:17:32.616
And thank God.

01:17:33.792 --> 01:17:48.820
So then in March, a very strange policy was introduced by the Department of Health, which was that they directed that patients, elderly patients who were in hospitals, would be taken out and put into nursing homes.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:56.383
Now, the person who was the Minister for Health at that time was none other than Simon Harris, our current Bánaiste.

01:17:56.823 --> 01:18:00.525
So this was a somewhat very unusual practice of taking.

01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:15.672
Now, it's an unusual practice that was also described by Robert Malone on a podcast that he was doing when he was interviewed with by Paul Cottrell in early 2021, I think in August, as that's not early 21, right after he was on Brett Weinstein's podcast.

01:18:16.457 --> 01:18:31.967
where he joked about dexamethasone being used like a hammer to get rid of all symptoms and batter down the immune system so that they could clear the ICUs of hospitals and send these people back to care homes.

01:18:33.568 --> 01:18:41.894
So this same thing happened in America, and we actually have Robert Malone describing one of the many ways that it was done on a video.

01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:58.200
You know, Robert Malone, the hero that is behind CHD, with three books from CHD Skyhorse Publishing, and a close advisor to both Meryl Nass and Mary Holland, the former campaign general manager of

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.362
of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:10.332
when he started his campaign, but then she came back to CHD as CEO when I was hired by Laura Bono, who now is retired.

01:19:11.653 --> 01:19:17.259
And some people are even calling a nutcase on X, which is hilarious.

01:19:18.861 --> 01:19:20.002
Toby, you know who you are.

01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:33.094
Taking these elderly patients out, as I understand it, the excuse used was that they needed the beds for this surge in cases that was going to materialize that never materialized.

01:19:33.414 --> 01:19:40.081
And before I proceed further, I need to state categorically, because it is a fact, hospitals were effectively empty in 2020.

01:19:41.022 --> 01:19:42.984
So that was the case also in America.

01:19:43.891 --> 01:19:44.973
Make no mistake about it.

01:19:45.193 --> 01:19:54.329
But then, of course, this left plenty of time for the certain doctors and nurses to practice their TikTok dances because they didn't have to look after these elderly people.

01:19:54.369 --> 01:19:56.072
They were sent into the nursing home.

01:19:57.296 --> 01:20:00.757
In the nursing home, there were no protocols for the care of these people.

01:20:00.878 --> 01:20:05.639
In the hospitals, they had been getting treatment, but when they arrived in the nursing homes, there was no protocol.

01:20:05.659 --> 01:20:11.402
My father-in-law died in a nursing home in the Netherlands of a urinary tract infection.

01:20:11.562 --> 01:20:12.742
Other people starved.

01:20:13.423 --> 01:20:15.404
Other people died of cold and thirst.

01:20:15.964 --> 01:20:25.808
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't wake up to the fact that people were murdered in 2020 in order to manage the population pyramid and at the same time bamboozle us,

01:20:26.775 --> 01:20:31.339
into teaching our kids that some pandemic is occurring, he will never escape.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.820
We must look back.

01:20:34.601 --> 01:20:36.322
I'm sorry, but we must look back.

01:20:36.362 --> 01:20:40.005
We cannot continue to run forward with our blindfolds on.

01:20:49.032 --> 01:20:56.374
In fact, he was so incensed by this policy that he actually resigned from the medical council because he saw that there were no treatment protocols.

01:20:57.094 --> 01:21:02.016
And the only thing that they were given was end of life care, like do not resuscitate.

01:21:02.576 --> 01:21:05.717
And they were and they were given drugs like midazolam.

01:21:05.797 --> 01:21:07.597
And I don't know if you know about midazolam.

01:21:07.777 --> 01:21:09.978
And I don't know if the viewers.

01:21:10.118 --> 01:21:13.299
I think you're definitely right about the valley vaping disease.

01:21:13.439 --> 01:21:14.079
I think that

01:21:14.659 --> 01:21:29.696
The fact of the matter is that Robert Malone and the superclown Andrew Huff did a couple podcasts together where we found out that Andrew Huff used to work for Juul and that Andrew Huff knows stuff about supply chains.

01:21:30.076 --> 01:21:31.237
And so they tested that.

01:21:31.298 --> 01:21:32.279
They auditioned him.

01:21:32.779 --> 01:21:36.101
They tried to put him on the main burner, but it didn't happen.

01:21:36.221 --> 01:21:37.142
People didn't buy it.

01:21:37.522 --> 01:21:46.668
He even told a story on multiple podcasts about shooting like 150 rounds at the local Michigan police from his house.

01:21:47.088 --> 01:21:56.834
He even ran back to his house to reload where his infant baby and his wife were, and then went back out into the field and shot back at him again.

01:21:56.894 --> 01:21:58.195
He told this story.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:15.144
as part of his elaborate entry into this space where he also told people on a podcast on X that SARS-CoV-2 had essentially been accelerated through 100,000 years of evolution through these careful insertion of fear and cleavage sites.

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:21.314
And so make no mistake about it, this is an orchestrated theater.

01:22:21.734 --> 01:22:32.982
And many people, even if they have the best of intentions, are still essentially discombobulated by the theater because they still haven't seen all the way to the brick wall.

01:22:34.119 --> 01:22:37.001
The viewers, it's an end-of-life drug.

01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:38.823
It speeds up your death.

01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:41.185
It causes kidney failure.

01:22:41.805 --> 01:22:42.886
It's a horrific drug.

01:22:43.006 --> 01:22:47.049
Not only that, but it is a respiratory suppressant.

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:51.953
So why would anybody give midazolam to a patient

01:22:53.774 --> 01:23:03.078
that suppresses their respiratory system when we are supposed to be in the midst of a respiratory crisis like COVID.

01:23:03.518 --> 01:23:05.339
It simply doesn't make sense.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:08.060
So this was a very, very bizarre policy.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:13.042
Now, it's not clear who directed the protocols for the care or the end of life care.

01:23:14.184 --> 01:23:25.667
So it doesn't seem that she is necessarily questioning that there was a respiratory disease, but she might even be hypothesizing that with a respiratory disease around, midazolam could have killed people.

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:27.347
And I think that's a mistake.

01:23:27.987 --> 01:23:33.589
I think we need to push people to understand that the reason why they would use midazolam

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:42.295
The reason why they would give supplementary oxygen is because it would cause respiratory distress that they could call the new virus.

01:23:42.796 --> 01:23:51.663
If they gave them something that didn't cause respiratory stress, then there would never be any respiratory distress in the hospitals or care homes.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:24:02.093
And so I don't think she can still see it because the existence of COVID is only based on those symptoms or the stupid test.

01:24:02.474 --> 01:24:12.559
So in reality, the only existence she has, the only evidence of existence she has is the mistreatment of these people, which doesn't prove the existence of it.

01:24:12.816 --> 01:24:20.662
fact happened was that in April of 2020, there was a spike in deaths in nursing homes.

01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:21.783
Can I bring up my slide now?

01:24:21.943 --> 01:24:22.484
Yes, please.

01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:23.564
OK, thank you.

01:24:23.745 --> 01:24:24.185
Thank you.

01:24:24.745 --> 01:24:26.587
I wanted to get to this slide as fast as possible.

01:24:26.607 --> 01:24:27.367
Thank you very much.

01:24:28.228 --> 01:24:28.989
And this is a slide.

01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:33.294
And by the way, this is a slide which is contained in this protected disclosures document.

01:24:33.794 --> 01:24:34.936
And that's why I'm using it.

01:24:35.116 --> 01:24:42.725
And so for the viewer can see that the dark thick lines represent the the deaths that took place.

01:24:42.805 --> 01:24:47.670
And as you can see, you know, fourth in from the bottom, April 2020, there is

01:24:49.492 --> 01:24:53.235
obviously a very massive spike in debt.

01:24:53.575 --> 01:24:55.077
I mean, it's very, very clear.

01:24:55.817 --> 01:25:05.125
And then coincidentally, the thinner line, which in reality follows it, it's red in reality, you can see it exactly.

01:25:05.885 --> 01:25:08.627
There's a huge spike then of that thinner line.

01:25:08.647 --> 01:25:12.430
That thinner line represents the administration of Madazalan.

01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:21.015
So here we have a correlation, an exact correlation between the administration of midazolam and deaths.

01:25:21.976 --> 01:25:28.199
And we know from research that's been done that that those deaths effectively occurred in nursing homes.

01:25:28.359 --> 01:25:38.366
Yeah, I got a phone call actually from an insider in the industry around that time saying, you need to go and look at this sudden increase in midazolam being supplied to nursing homes.

01:25:38.547 --> 01:25:44.471
And I was so busy doing other stuff, and I didn't have the bandwidth to follow it anyway at that stage.

01:25:44.531 --> 01:25:45.532
Of course, and you're so busy.

01:25:45.572 --> 01:25:52.156
But thanks to this whistleblower, this is one of the many graphs that are included in this document, which is extremely important.

01:25:52.176 --> 01:25:56.019
Can I just go back to that slide again, because it's spiked again, it seems, 12 months later.

01:25:56.039 --> 01:26:05.546
You can see the next spike is a spike in January of 2021, which, of course, coincides with the rollout of the vaccine.

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:08.888
And we'll come to that, because that forms a very, very important part of this document.

01:26:08.908 --> 01:26:09.469
Can I just stop you there?

01:26:09.509 --> 01:26:10.049
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:10.089 --> 01:26:12.311
But just on that, because I've covered it before.

01:26:12.671 --> 01:26:17.833
And so she's not differentiating between any of the vaccines by using the word vaccine.

01:26:18.334 --> 01:26:29.399
She should be saying whether they rolled out the transformation of AAV carrier of genetic information, the package, adenovirus package, or whether they're talking about the mRNA.

01:26:29.959 --> 01:26:32.420
I suspect they're talking about the adenovirus first.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.261
I just want to jump to it because I think it's relevant.

01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:38.503
And so there was a big study done by Rancourt and company in Canada.

01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:43.245
They looked at about a quarter of the world population that had been injected.

01:26:44.025 --> 01:26:45.666
So that's very, very many countries.

01:26:46.046 --> 01:26:48.767
And they came to the conclusion that there was no data.

01:26:48.847 --> 01:26:53.950
There's no data surge supporting excess deaths from from any pathogen.

01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:58.772
But there's very strong evidence to show that there was excess deaths from the response

01:26:59.332 --> 01:26:59.632
Correct.

01:26:59.672 --> 01:27:02.213
To the so-called pandemic.

01:27:02.873 --> 01:27:13.716
And and of course, the rollout of mRNA vaccines and particularly that study showed in many places a surge in the deaths in nursing homes coincidental with the start of it.

01:27:13.756 --> 01:27:17.036
So there was three three areas of of of.

01:27:17.196 --> 01:27:18.937
Now, remember, he went over to

01:27:19.657 --> 01:27:29.177
to Romania and presented all of his data and the main message that all of these people brought back was that 17 million people had been killed from the shot.

01:27:30.811 --> 01:27:35.615
not that people were murdered at the start of the pandemic, even though that data was also presented.

01:27:36.075 --> 01:27:44.061
And so one of the interactions that I had with him after that meeting was very specifically, why aren't you correcting them?

01:27:44.922 --> 01:27:47.804
Why aren't you correcting Robert Malone's substack?

01:27:47.844 --> 01:27:50.966
Why aren't you correcting Jessica Rose's substack?

01:27:51.387 --> 01:27:52.828
And his response to me on

01:27:53.608 --> 01:27:57.530
Twitter via direct message was that I don't like to have confrontation.

01:27:57.570 --> 01:27:59.111
I like to do it at the right time.

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:01.873
I'm very strategic in how I interact with people.

01:28:04.014 --> 01:28:04.374
Liar.

01:28:06.826 --> 01:28:08.708
a causation of that.

01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:16.594
So there was the suppression at the start of, sorry, the nursing home debts spike, which we can see there in the Irish data.

01:28:17.614 --> 01:28:27.302
They put the total amount of excess debts globally at 33 million, of which 17 million were temporally in time.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.805
He is repeating the same number.

01:28:32.446 --> 01:28:34.768
It's a magic spell they are casting on us.

01:28:36.226 --> 01:28:38.688
correlated to the rollout of MRA vaccines.

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:39.288
Yes.

01:28:39.849 --> 01:28:48.535
And before that, they also did a study with regard to the the alleged of the spike in alleged covid deaths.

01:28:49.035 --> 01:28:50.196
And the first spike.

01:28:50.356 --> 01:28:52.457
See, she's talking about the right study.

01:28:52.697 --> 01:28:56.080
And the first study was about the spike at the beginning.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.744
It came out in May and it showed that there was no spread across borders, that it had more to do with poverty.

01:29:02.825 --> 01:29:04.005
It had more to do with

01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:09.732
I don't know, bad health, whatever, but it had nothing to do, and it did it in hospitals.

01:29:11.454 --> 01:29:16.941
And they're not talking about that anymore, they just say 17 million people killed from the shot, Denny Rancor, smart guy.

01:29:17.902 --> 01:29:19.885
Denny Rancor is a scripted liar.

01:29:20.882 --> 01:29:25.725
that Rancourt identified and his team identified was, guess what?

01:29:26.265 --> 01:29:29.707
A spike which occurred between March and May of 2020.

01:29:29.928 --> 01:29:38.973
So that- And that message was never brought back from Romania and Denny Rancourt did not give a shit.

01:29:42.055 --> 01:29:44.737
Because he's a scripted traitor on the exact same team.

01:29:44.777 --> 01:29:46.218
That's why he was in Romania.

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:51.891
Do you really think that Denny Rancourt traveled to Romania to help save the world around him?

01:29:52.511 --> 01:29:54.292
To help do what he could for Canada?

01:29:54.692 --> 01:29:59.015
Do you think Robert Malone was over in Romania because he was trying to help America?

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:05.619
Do you think that Ryan Cole took a trip to Romania because he thought that was the best way that he could help America?

01:30:05.679 --> 01:30:13.683
Do you think that's why Nick Hudson was in Romania because he thought he could help the kids of South America by going there and talking to those people?

01:30:14.003 --> 01:30:16.465
Do you think Jessica Rose has been traveling the world

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.546
help anybody but herself?

01:30:22.108 --> 01:30:28.353
Coincides perfectly with what happened here in Ireland and what he discovered.

01:30:28.373 --> 01:30:41.061
So what you're saying here is that the protected disclosure by the senior pharmacist in Ireland to the authorities in Ireland who've ignored his disclosure so far is actually directly corresponds to the results of the Rancourt study.

01:30:41.481 --> 01:30:41.841
Exactly.

01:30:42.822 --> 01:30:43.002
Yes.

01:30:43.483 --> 01:30:50.790
And in that the Rancourt study, what they discovered was that this virus wasn't, you know, adopting a normal path.

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:53.172
It was extraordinarily discriminatory.

01:30:53.893 --> 01:31:02.001
And, you know, in its in its path, because it was very prevalent in some areas and then it wasn't prevalent in other areas.

01:31:02.321 --> 01:31:07.327
And they said this isn't the path that a normal pathogen would take.

01:31:07.407 --> 01:31:17.337
So when they carried out the studies, they discovered that, in fact, the spike in deaths that occurred, including the spike in this particular time period that's relevant to Ireland,

01:31:17.998 --> 01:31:30.869
occurred only when the aggressive medical interventions were undertaken, such as the ventilators, which we now know killed at least 90% of those who were on them.

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:32.531
And guess what?

01:31:33.131 --> 01:31:34.372
The use of midazolam.

01:31:35.013 --> 01:31:36.754
So it's in the Rancourt report.

01:31:36.774 --> 01:31:41.679
So the Rancourt report actually supports what's contained in that

01:31:42.139 --> 01:31:46.880
OK, so let's just walk me through the evidence, the rest, the other evidence, because there's quite a lot in it.

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:47.901
There is a lot.

01:31:48.661 --> 01:31:53.402
So as I said, it was very bizarre that these people were being given a respiratory suppressant.

01:31:53.462 --> 01:31:56.783
So we've dealt with all of that now in one.

01:31:56.843 --> 01:31:59.363
And I just want to mention this because it's particularly damning.

01:32:00.144 --> 01:32:04.085
In one case, there were eight people, eight elderly people died in one

01:32:05.296 --> 01:32:09.299
hospital care home in the Midlands in one weekend during that time.

01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:10.400
It was during Easter.

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.802
So what we have now is they have the deaths.

01:32:13.842 --> 01:32:20.106
The deaths, you see, were not occurring naturally in the in the in the environment or in the community.

01:32:20.567 --> 01:32:23.229
But now they have their surge in deaths.

01:32:23.649 --> 01:32:29.013
So this, of course, was fed into the mainstream media, fomenting the fear for the people.

01:32:29.693 --> 01:32:32.335
Enter stage left the PCR test.

01:32:32.455 --> 01:32:38.403
People like Devi Sridhar from yesterday's show when he, she was talking to the Topol shithead.

01:32:38.984 --> 01:32:45.172
She's one of those people who was over in Scotland saying that, you know, we need to lock down because there's a virus.

01:32:45.212 --> 01:32:48.196
And in fact, they were murdering people and calling it a virus.

01:32:50.686 --> 01:32:56.751
Now it had already been in use, but now it really was being ramped up, this PCR test.

01:32:57.031 --> 01:33:12.564
So what you're saying so far is that the initial surge in deaths, which was used to scare the population, was actually caused not by, well, apparently not by the pathogen, but actually by the treatment or response to the elderly people being taken out of hospitals and put into nursing homes.

01:33:12.584 --> 01:33:12.964
That's right.

01:33:13.365 --> 01:33:14.205
Or so it would seem.

01:33:14.225 --> 01:33:16.407
I mean, these correlations are alarming.

01:33:16.587 --> 01:33:17.008
Obviously,

01:33:17.748 --> 01:33:19.830
I can't call it definitively.

01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:20.870
That would be inappropriate.

01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:24.953
But what I'm saying is these correlations are very serious, very alarming.

01:33:24.993 --> 01:33:33.098
And in themselves, this this incident alone, it warrants a very, very serious criminal investigation.

01:33:33.198 --> 01:33:43.285
And really, the families of these people should be these deceased people should be asking what and what medicines were given to their elderly relatives, you know, before they passed.

01:33:43.605 --> 01:33:44.486
Was it midazolam?

01:33:44.506 --> 01:33:45.286
Was it morphine?

01:33:45.627 --> 01:33:47.548
Why were they being given end of care treatment?

01:33:47.628 --> 01:33:49.029
I mean, this is very just.

01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:52.090
Why were they being given end of care treatment?

01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:55.372
Why were they being euthanized without consent?

01:33:56.392 --> 01:33:58.773
Why were they being manslaughtered, murdered?

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:08.838
Remember, Mary Talley Bowden went on Joe Rogan a couple of weeks ago and said that it looks like Grace Shara was intentionally euthanized, but you can't do that.

01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:18.710
Euthanasia requires consent from the person you're doing it to, or from those people around her.

01:34:21.033 --> 01:34:24.357
They only had implied consent because she was in the hospital.

01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:47.058
And so what Grace Shara's dad should be doing to bring justice to the memory of his daughter is advocating for everybody who lost somebody in 2020 to look up the medical records and find out if anybody was given end-of-life care when they definitely didn't need end-of-life care.

01:34:49.414 --> 01:34:54.899
that no one that they know died of something through implied consent.

01:34:54.919 --> 01:34:58.061
They were in the hospital, so, you know, they were allowed to treat him.

01:34:58.682 --> 01:35:04.327
Do you understand how malevolent it is that Scott Shara doesn't appear to be doing that?

01:35:06.348 --> 01:35:09.871
That CHD is promoting him without doing that?

01:35:10.885 --> 01:35:20.591
How frightening it is that nobody is advocating to go back to 2020, 2021 and 2022 and make sure that there weren't too many people that got murdered.

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:24.213
Nobody's doing that.

01:35:26.474 --> 01:35:30.036
This woman is advocating for them, for everybody to do it in Ireland.

01:35:30.076 --> 01:35:31.057
And I like it a lot.

01:35:32.981 --> 01:35:34.582
And where did the instructions come from?

01:35:34.602 --> 01:35:37.163
And where exactly did the instructions come from?

01:35:37.483 --> 01:35:38.363
So this is very serious.

01:35:38.383 --> 01:35:41.765
So you can see why Dr. Marcus de Brun took the action he did.

01:35:41.785 --> 01:35:42.565
Yeah, absolutely.

01:35:43.145 --> 01:35:47.607
And also this information ties in with the information he gave you in the interview.

01:35:47.627 --> 01:35:48.688
Well, I'm not asking you to comment on this.

01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:55.533
I think that's a blanks thing that I didn't leave it there.

01:35:55.573 --> 01:36:03.142
So remember the conscious and intelligent manipulation of our organized habits and opinions is an important element of how we are governed.

01:36:03.182 --> 01:36:07.268
In fact, social media does this to a military level now.

01:36:08.206 --> 01:36:11.369
We are being manipulated by liars on social media.

01:36:11.389 --> 01:36:20.259
Flags, natural disasters, government-imposed disasters, World War III, you name it.

01:36:20.459 --> 01:36:25.124
We have a lot coming at us, and this is why so many Americans are going to the satellite phone stores.

01:36:25.504 --> 01:36:28.725
So we got to go to the satellite phone store and get a satellite phone.

01:36:28.745 --> 01:36:39.787
We got to stock up on Ivermectin and we should buy a serious number of gold, I don't know, bullion or some shit like that and put it in a safe somewhere to protect our wealth.

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:49.068
We should also have a lot of Bitcoin, I guess, because Bitcoin might be the reason why they bombed Iran, according to Jack Cruz.

01:36:49.568 --> 01:36:53.129
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been so thoroughly fooled.

01:36:53.949 --> 01:37:07.804
Our children are still being thoroughly fooled and most Americans and most adults around the world with a telephone are being fooled by social media into believing that that's just kind of like a TV only better.

01:37:09.466 --> 01:37:12.129
Instead of the mind control device that it is.

01:37:12.329 --> 01:37:15.573
Instead of the enslavement device that it is.

01:37:18.211 --> 01:37:33.095
I know it's easy to see through a clown like this, but it's harder to see through groups of clowns, especially if they also are texting your wife and all this other shit that's going on over the last many, many years.

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:36.176
It's ugly, ladies and gentlemen, it's ugly.

01:37:37.817 --> 01:38:02.906
Josie's on a vacation far away Come around and talk it over So many things that I wanna say You know I like my girls a little bit older I just wanna lose your love tonight I don't wanna lose your love tonight

01:38:11.481 --> 01:38:32.898
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble You know I'd do anything for you Standin' up and keepin' undercover I just wanna use your love tonight I don't wanna lose your love tonight

01:38:53.432 --> 01:38:58.809
Something in my mind's not making sense

01:39:21.772 --> 01:39:30.364
I just wanna use your love tonight I don't wanna lose your love tonight

01:40:58.706 --> 01:41:02.508
Now I have made the point often that these guys are scripted traitors.

01:41:02.548 --> 01:41:05.349
That's the reason why they're there where they are.

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.971
This is really as bad as it's gonna get.

01:41:12.732 --> 01:41:24.517
If we don't turn this ship around right now and realize that that guy's a fraud and that Marty Makary's a fraud, and then that means that the FDA is in big trouble, that this radical transparency is bullshit.

01:41:24.557 --> 01:41:27.098
If we don't realize that these are foreign agents,

01:41:29.168 --> 01:41:33.569
who have no vested interest in our children and don't give a shit about my kids.

01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:37.851
These people are traitors to our grandchildren in America.

01:41:37.951 --> 01:41:44.333
They are undermining our country and they are guilty of some crimes.

01:41:44.393 --> 01:41:47.914
I don't know really what they would be called, but they're awful people.

01:41:49.272 --> 01:41:49.773
Actually, J.J.

01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:57.723
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:41:57.984 --> 01:42:03.211
It's weird because this lady and her husband are now

01:42:04.532 --> 01:42:15.923
are now just did a podcast yesterday saying that finally YouTube has confessed that they were wrong or they were right and it's all good.

01:42:16.664 --> 01:42:24.751
We've been proven correct when they didn't do anything but stay on Robert Malone's script for the last five years.

01:42:25.192 --> 01:42:28.635
And part of being on that script is claiming to be a hero

01:42:29.756 --> 01:42:44.288
and claiming to be having spoken out at the right time and taking a risk of giving Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch a platform which supposedly saved a bunch of people by encouraging them to take ivermectin instead of the vaccine.

01:42:44.708 --> 01:42:50.213
And this woman is a shitty, shitty American because I told her in 2021

01:42:51.674 --> 01:43:00.600
and all of them that this was a transfection and we needed to call it that so that academic biologists would wake up and realize that they knew that too.

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.482
And they didn't use the word.

01:43:02.682 --> 01:43:07.826
Insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:43:08.586 --> 01:43:09.046
Actually, J.J.

01:43:09.126 --> 01:43:15.591
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:43:19.028 --> 01:43:21.170
And so they will never say these things.

01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:26.776
They will never progress in their understanding to stop using the word vaccine.

01:43:27.116 --> 01:43:36.725
They will never progress in their understanding to stop using the word vaccine and call it transfection or transformation with regard to the COVID shots.

01:43:37.106 --> 01:43:40.989
They will never start to challenge the idea that RNA

01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:58.150
can pandemic even though they're biologists who supposedly believe that the magic of evolution was made possible by the magic of dna and yet all of the magic of dna is somehow missing from rna holy shit

01:44:01.434 --> 01:44:04.475
Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying are two of the worst Americans alive.

01:44:04.535 --> 01:44:20.041
The same Palantir program, Gotham AI Kill Chain, is being used to target Hamas in... So this lady is named Zoe Smith, and she has some kind of book called... We've already used the Tiberius... The Thrill Kill Medical Cult.

01:44:21.614 --> 01:44:30.362
And this lady has been brought into a case in California that I was an expert for.

01:44:30.922 --> 01:44:41.712
And I'm becoming a little disturbed at how many times I'm finding her on the internet talking a little bit about me, saying my name a little bit with regard to this case.

01:44:42.192 --> 01:44:47.117
But now, for example, a couple of weeks ago was on the Corbett Report for a whole hour.

01:44:47.921 --> 01:44:53.732
So the Corbett report is promoting somebody who was on the bus and in the movie Vaxxed 3.

01:44:59.062 --> 01:45:06.144
And this woman was brought into our case like later, like, I don't know, around the same time that Dave Rasnick was brought into our case.

01:45:06.544 --> 01:45:19.547
And as far as I'm concerned, Dave Rasnick also feels like somebody who's kind of sticking to a limited script of, of pseudo skepticism about things and never really able to get anybody across the finish line.

01:45:19.607 --> 01:45:23.048
Say for example, that intramuscular injection might just be dumb.

01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:42.517
And instead he gives long presentations about alternative explanations for cancer like polyploidy and this stuff, which may or may not be true, but they're not really fundamental to our escaping the narrative that supposedly he was speaking out against already back with HIV and AIDS.

01:45:43.217 --> 01:46:00.855
And yet somehow or another, somebody who's been speaking out that long about virology still hasn't been able to get to where I am or to get to where Mark is, where they kind of, we realized that intramuscular injection, intramuscular injection is just a methodology that dates back to the late 1800s.

01:46:06.121 --> 01:46:09.525
The Corbett report covered this lady a few weeks ago.

01:46:09.545 --> 01:46:21.719
And in that thing, she's talking about all kinds of worst case scenarios with regard to AI and their use of AI to kill us and their intentions to do it further and further and further.

01:46:21.759 --> 01:46:25.443
And so kind of like all the other stories, there's no resisting.

01:46:26.539 --> 01:46:36.223
If the billionaires want to kill you, and the military wants to kill you, and they're all working together to kill you, then what choice or chance do we have?

01:46:36.263 --> 01:46:38.965
We might as well go back to the gym and work on our jump shot then.

01:46:40.065 --> 01:46:41.846
Do you see what this is?

01:46:43.347 --> 01:46:46.648
I think that this is how you can characterize almost all of these people.

01:46:46.708 --> 01:46:52.971
If they give you no hope, or they give you an explanation with a great amount of certainty that in the end leaves you helpless,

01:46:55.222 --> 01:47:04.405
then you can almost guarantee they're full of shit because my message doesn't leave you helpless if you understand that RNA cannot pandemic, you'll never be scared again.

01:47:04.445 --> 01:47:08.386
If you understand that intramuscular injection was always dumb, you'll never take another one.

01:47:08.806 --> 01:47:23.570
If you understand that they're lying about this technology being new and exciting, you will also not be bamboozled anymore by this contamination issue or by all this other shit about upgrading to a next generation.

01:47:23.630 --> 01:47:24.470
None of it will matter.

01:47:28.638 --> 01:47:31.661
And then you can see what this replicon thing is, right?

01:47:31.701 --> 01:47:36.886
The replicon thing is just testing whether or not they can make a self-replicating RNA and whether it'll work or not.

01:47:37.266 --> 01:47:40.609
And the only place to test that, in humans.

01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:53.801
Because if you make a self-replicating RNA that works in mice, it'll only work in mouse ribosomes, in mouse cells, and most likely only work in inbred, purebred mice.

01:47:54.701 --> 01:47:57.223
that we work on on our academic benches.

01:47:57.263 --> 01:47:58.824
We won't know how to do it in humans.

01:47:58.864 --> 01:48:02.807
The only way to learn how to do that in humans would be to do it in humans.

01:48:04.708 --> 01:48:22.240
And so while all this bullshit is going on about AI kill chains and purports to be speaking out about these technologies, you're just going to go limp because even if you don't take a shot, you're still going to be under the digital ID and you know, yada, yada, yada.

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.442
They're going to spray it on you, et cetera, et cetera.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:55.121
corporatereport.com and an interview that is being recorded on june 17th of 2025 here in japan but i am talking on the line today to a guest from the united states specifically zoe smith who is the author of well my life in the thrill kill medical cult the substack uh she also has a book on the covid code i mean isn't it crazy how they all have a substack and they all have a book

01:48:57.037 --> 01:49:00.199
She got in the movie Vax 3, not me.

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.002
Not Brandy Vaughn, not Tony Bark.

01:49:05.302 --> 01:49:09.445
They didn't make any of those movies in memory of those two women that were killed in 2020.

01:49:09.625 --> 01:49:10.906
No, no, no, no, no.

01:49:11.266 --> 01:49:13.187
That would have been, that would have been crazy.

01:49:19.798 --> 01:49:27.860
I think it's very remarkable that this woman was in Vax 3 and then now finds herself involved with me in this case in California.

01:49:29.961 --> 01:49:36.783
I find it very bizarre that Dave Raznick got involved with me in this case in California, even though I kind of objected to it.

01:49:39.603 --> 01:49:45.005
And if I told you the craziest part about the case, you wouldn't even believe me.

01:49:47.594 --> 01:50:06.151
about the Thrillkill medical cult and her interesting experience having, well, seen- Remember, his main role was to make sure that everybody focused on the bad guy Bill Gates with three really wonderful, highly produced, hour-long videos about how Bill Gates was the ultimate in badass bad guys.

01:50:08.033 --> 01:50:09.454
He did that perfectly well.

01:50:11.716 --> 01:50:13.358
The bureaucratic back-end

01:50:14.119 --> 01:50:15.340
of the COVID-19 scam.

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:27.210
So what's bothering me about this is that Dolores Cahill was on the medical doctors for COVID ethics and she lectured about all kinds of shit.

01:50:27.691 --> 01:50:31.554
And then during the questioning, this Zoe Smith was there.

01:50:31.874 --> 01:50:41.963
And again, she mentioned my name with regard to this fricking case and mentioned my name in the same breath as fricking Dave Rasnick again.

01:50:42.611 --> 01:50:50.018
which bothers me a lot because i think these people are game and something in british gardens in north wales

01:50:51.212 --> 01:50:52.793
And so this is Stephen Frost.

01:50:52.853 --> 01:50:57.355
Remember, I've presented to this group seven times.

01:50:58.275 --> 01:51:06.798
Seven times I've presented to this group, and at least three times I've been where I am now, where I can say the population pyramid was sculpted using murder and lies.

01:51:07.259 --> 01:51:09.259
I can say that it was always transfection.

01:51:09.639 --> 01:51:11.880
I can say that intramuscular injection was dumb.

01:51:12.441 --> 01:51:15.362
And I can say all, I said all of that three times to this group.

01:51:15.982 --> 01:51:27.779
And somehow or another, those very profound statements never seem to land and never get repeated, even though apparently I have such an important message that they had me present it seven times.

01:51:29.221 --> 01:51:31.985
Where I am within a week of the Ukraine war starting.

01:51:34.557 --> 01:51:38.520
So I think, you know, we can just I just know that's fine.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:39.420
I'll just finish off.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:54.270
I think the thing is why it's good to read the the Rosa Corey book Behind the Green Mask or the Committee of 300 is that what's going on is like a strategy, you know, like a military strategy.

01:51:54.790 --> 01:52:00.714
And what they want is for us to be in camps about climate change or pandemics.

01:52:01.414 --> 01:52:02.174
or the virus.

01:52:02.434 --> 01:52:16.719
OK, so the thing is, that's why when you know this is a very sophisticated agenda that they put a lot of our resources and their time into, that they want us to argue.

01:52:17.119 --> 01:52:28.543
So what I would then do is say, no, we're not going to, because they have been kind of preemptively programmed to when you're told about things like climate change when you're young,

01:52:29.543 --> 01:52:33.586
the psychology is that they then believe in that very strongly.

01:52:33.666 --> 01:52:43.053
So anyone who wants to open a discussion, that would be a very private thing, and that they are literally untouchable to argue on that issue.

01:52:43.654 --> 01:52:53.121
So when you know the psychology behind it, you have to then either be very simple and just say, well, if there was a pandemic, there'd be more deaths and there wasn't and just show it.

01:52:54.165 --> 01:52:57.908
or you approach- This is such weak bullshit.

01:52:57.988 --> 01:53:05.293
Remember that Dolores Cahill supposedly has been on the front lines of arguing this idea for a very long time.

01:53:05.773 --> 01:53:21.383
She's one of the people that started to make me understand that the idea of transfecting somebody was an endless bouquet of possibilities that would always be the confusion of the immune system with this expression of a foreign protein.

01:53:21.423 --> 01:53:23.185
And that confusion could have any,

01:53:24.045 --> 01:53:28.288
a countless number of ramifications and autoimmune consequences.

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:30.269
And she helped me to see that.

01:53:30.329 --> 01:53:31.130
That's for sure.

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:33.472
But that was six years ago.

01:53:35.913 --> 01:53:44.659
And now six years later, she still seems to be stuck in some of these huge assumptions with this rock solid certainty, just like she had in 2020.

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.864
that where there is mockery or ridicule, or you get them to ask a question.

01:53:52.944 --> 01:54:02.010
So what people, if you want to break out of their... And that's exactly what I think stating that intramuscular injection is just plain dumb does.

01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:03.831
It forces people to ask a question.

01:54:04.631 --> 01:54:12.016
Saying that RNA cannot pandemic is the perfect way to force them to ask the question of how do they know that RNA can pandemic?

01:54:13.533 --> 01:54:22.639
I want you to see how disingenuous it is that there is a whole group of people that's listening to this talk, probably over a hundred of them.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.403
All of them have heard me present between five and seven times, depending on how much they attended.

01:54:28.783 --> 01:54:37.349
And all of them know that this is bullshit unless you give people a script of simple things to say to challenge people and force them to ask the right questions.

01:54:37.769 --> 01:54:39.891
This is scripted fricking bullshit.

01:54:41.343 --> 01:54:42.323
And it gets worse.

01:54:42.343 --> 01:54:55.909
Attachment to COVID or anything is you say to them, isn't it interesting the prime minister was telling everyone they had to stay at home and they had parties, you know, two parties every Friday.

01:54:56.729 --> 01:55:02.451
Wouldn't you feel that they were either mocking us on the TV and lying?

01:55:03.371 --> 01:55:09.494
We are in 2025 and the only argument she has is not that they murdered people and lied about it.

01:55:10.253 --> 01:55:11.800
but that they had parties.

01:55:19.038 --> 01:55:44.155
wow i mean this is a really shitty script she's on or they were you know they they might have done one or two parties but not for the whole time so i'm only get or you give them examples to show there is no evidence i'm not saying there is or there isn't a pandemic there is or there isn't climate change there is that there's not a virus the evidence is there was no increase in death and so by definition

01:55:44.155 --> 01:55:47.779
There was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

01:55:47.819 --> 01:55:48.640
Where did it go?

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:52.264
Do you see the problem?

01:55:52.524 --> 01:55:54.146
She is scripted to say that.

01:55:54.206 --> 01:55:55.347
There was no rise.

01:55:56.048 --> 01:55:56.528
You see it?

01:55:57.009 --> 01:55:57.489
You see it?

01:55:57.609 --> 01:55:59.251
She is scripted to say that shit.

01:56:04.375 --> 01:56:20.144
It's taken a lot of us literally years of research to understand the psychology and the parts that they have, like Wi-Fi, 5G, fluoride, things that affect fertility, the vaccines, climate change, right?

01:56:20.505 --> 01:56:21.905
So literally they have it.

01:56:22.326 --> 01:56:23.646
So there's 20 of them.

01:56:24.207 --> 01:56:27.929
So that if a family agree on one thing, they won't agree on another.

01:56:28.489 --> 01:56:28.870
And that...

01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:32.292
in a way is not the best way out.

01:56:32.793 --> 01:56:37.077
The best way is that we who know this kind of park it all.

01:56:37.477 --> 01:56:51.330
And then we say, well, what people really want is to to be have live healthily for a long time and build up their local communities and try and have one goal like the best education system or that they will live healthy to be 140.

01:56:52.731 --> 01:57:06.575
and that we kind of let the whole theater of their 20 scenarios to suck out the energy for people and just focus on... But so what we need to do, in my opinion, Dolores, we're too much on the back foot.

01:57:07.175 --> 01:57:11.496
So we sit there, we know all these narratives are false.

01:57:11.836 --> 01:57:12.456
We know that.

01:57:13.477 --> 01:57:15.257
But we've got to convince the public.

01:57:15.537 --> 01:57:17.798
We've got to tell them in a way that they understand.

01:57:17.818 --> 01:57:21.119
You can't trust your government, particularly after the COVID years.

01:57:22.199 --> 01:57:40.125
but even before and and so um that uh that none of these narratives they create are false narratives they're complicated intentionally so it's very difficult to counsel so he can't he can't remember what i told him those seven times he can't he's

01:57:40.225 --> 01:57:43.087
think about, well, I wonder who said it best.

01:57:43.567 --> 01:57:48.510
I wonder if there's anybody that we've listened to in these meetings that said it better than anybody else.

01:57:49.371 --> 01:57:57.236
And maybe I should have some list of ideas that I think are most important and then move them around as I listen to all these people.

01:57:57.256 --> 01:57:57.476
You know,

01:57:57.896 --> 01:58:11.032
If I had a podcast and I was interviewing three people a week or four people a week like Kim Iverson, I might have a whole wall of good ideas that I would want to pursue and good ideas that I wanted to check out and good ideas I thought was stupid.

01:58:11.372 --> 01:58:15.957
If I was somebody like, I don't know, Sarah Westall, I might do the same thing, but instead, no.

01:58:17.449 --> 01:58:22.631
They just interview people and say, Oh wow, cosmic space dragons sounds really cool.

01:58:23.172 --> 01:58:23.632
Oh wow.

01:58:23.932 --> 01:58:26.633
There was no opioid pandemic, but AI is going to kill us.

01:58:26.913 --> 01:58:27.274
Oh wow.

01:58:27.334 --> 01:58:28.054
That's really neat.

01:58:28.114 --> 01:58:33.116
And they don't think they don't, they don't absorb, they don't question, they don't criticize.

01:58:33.176 --> 01:58:35.477
They just do a podcast.

01:58:36.658 --> 01:58:45.002
And so what's the point of hosting a meeting for five and a half years with all these doctors, if you're not going to make progress and figuring it out,

01:58:49.249 --> 01:58:55.698
It's to waste people's time, keep them busy, to make them feel like they're getting somewhere when they're not.

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:00.985
That's why you're gonna see the amazing Mark Steele.

01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:07.875
and Dolores Cahill talk to each other like they've been to a few places together before.

01:59:08.596 --> 01:59:16.404
But what we do wrongly, in my opinion, we fall into the trap of saying, you know, thinking that we have to prove that they're wrong.

01:59:16.664 --> 01:59:19.126
No, they should be proving that there was a pandemic.

01:59:19.587 --> 01:59:24.832
They should prove that Ukraine could beat Russia in a war when it's complete nonsense.

01:59:25.212 --> 01:59:26.574
They should, they should.

01:59:26.854 --> 01:59:31.277
How about they should prove that intramuscular injection is a useful methodology for something?

01:59:31.618 --> 01:59:36.241
How about they prove that transfection is being renewed or new or not old?

01:59:36.281 --> 01:59:38.963
How about they prove that RNA can pandemic?

01:59:39.023 --> 01:59:41.565
You fricking scripted traitor.

01:59:43.026 --> 01:59:46.449
The same guy was trying to get me to write a book with Jerome Corsi.

01:59:47.355 --> 01:59:57.106
Jerome Corsi being this guy who was associated with, with Roger Stone and supposedly accidentally emailed the government about Zev Zelenko.

01:59:57.146 --> 02:00:01.552
And that's how Zev Zelenko got, got caught distributing hydroxychloroquine.

02:00:03.994 --> 02:00:05.136
Can you, can you see it yet?

02:00:06.778 --> 02:00:07.818
I can't make this shit up.

02:00:07.878 --> 02:00:09.359
I can't just pull this out of thin air.

02:00:09.419 --> 02:00:10.059
That's real.

02:00:10.599 --> 02:00:13.240
Jerome Corsi was in this group for a long time.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.201
He tried to set me up with Jerome Corsi.

02:00:15.221 --> 02:00:23.004
Jerome Corsi brought Steve Bannon to this group about five months ago or six months ago, or it could be a year from now ago.

02:00:23.084 --> 02:00:23.884
I don't know anymore.

02:00:28.206 --> 02:00:32.508
These people are scripted traitors, ladies and gentlemen, and they're not gonna stop the truth from getting out.

02:00:32.548 --> 02:00:33.648
They're just never gonna say it.

02:00:36.022 --> 02:00:37.664
I am so shocked.

02:00:38.565 --> 02:00:49.078
This is the same group where they brought Sukrit Bhakti on to tell me that now that we've settled the fact that RNA can have pandemic, there's no reason to talk about it anymore.

02:00:49.679 --> 02:00:53.984
And Stephen Frost isn't talking about it anymore.

02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.923
He's making sure they don't prove the stuff about climate, the nonsense about climate change.

02:01:01.143 --> 02:01:01.923
We don't do that.

02:01:02.523 --> 02:01:03.344
No, no, that's true.

02:01:03.384 --> 02:01:08.806
But I also think that imagine if someone is 40, from 40 years old to 100 listening to this.

02:01:10.047 --> 02:01:11.368
I have a different strategy.

02:01:12.628 --> 02:01:20.112
I think we should be saying, imagine if we had care facilities so that whether you're 40 or 70,

02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:28.974
Listen to what this woman says next, because you won't believe it.

02:01:30.215 --> 02:01:31.417
And nobody pushes back.

02:01:38.749 --> 02:01:42.873
we will never lock you in your home and we will never coerce you to medical treatment.

02:01:43.453 --> 02:01:57.927
And that we, you as somebody who wants that and you're 45 now, that you can work cooperatively in Sydney or in Tipperary to build the structure that there will be a business.

02:01:57.987 --> 02:02:04.113
If somebody listening to this starts it, that you then when you need it say, well, the nurse works for me.

02:02:04.673 --> 02:02:05.234
You know what I mean?

02:02:05.274 --> 02:02:07.035
In a transparent, lawful way.

02:02:07.536 --> 02:02:10.839
And that whatever protocol you're on, you can be in a network to make sure.

02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:14.583
And that you get, if you want to, your blood tested twice a year.

02:02:14.643 --> 02:02:20.168
So she's advocating for private networks of people to pay in to take care of themselves when they're old.

02:02:20.188 --> 02:02:21.850
You know, kind of like break up the system.

02:02:23.286 --> 02:02:24.347
Smash the system.

02:02:24.747 --> 02:02:40.201
We're gonna do it outside of the system like America's frontline doctors are doing like the wellness company is doing You see you're not malnourished and the aim would be that you are not neurocognitively impaired Because you can actually detox from a lot of heavy metals.

02:02:40.641 --> 02:02:41.843
What else works for me?

02:02:42.423 --> 02:02:42.983
You know what I mean?

02:02:43.024 --> 02:02:44.785
In a transparent, lawful way.

02:02:45.285 --> 02:02:48.588
And that whatever protocol you're on, you can be in a network to make sure.

02:02:49.168 --> 02:02:53.752
And that you get, if you want to, your blood tested twice a year to show you're not malnourished.

02:02:53.992 --> 02:02:59.796
A blood test twice a year to show you're not malnourished to participate in this private network of people.

02:03:00.857 --> 02:03:03.499
What in the Sam hell is she talking about?

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:10.945
Other than creating the exact remnant stream that they still want to have, just in a private network setting.

02:03:11.863 --> 02:03:16.304
What the actual, what in the actual hell is going on here?

02:03:16.885 --> 02:03:21.726
Remember, this is in the same country that's already decided to collect all the genetic data from all the babies.

02:03:23.087 --> 02:03:35.290
And the aim would be that you are not neurocognitively impaired because you can actually detox from a lot of heavy metals and that people who are in their 50s now say, I don't really need to talk about all this thing.

02:03:35.610 --> 02:03:37.211
I want to live a happy life.

02:03:37.231 --> 02:03:39.892
Why is her eyes, are her eyes moving so much?

02:03:40.737 --> 02:03:48.523
And if you grew up in an area, I want to live in my home or in my local care home where I can come and go as I please.

02:03:48.964 --> 02:03:52.026
I think that's, so that's what Rosa Corey was saying.

02:03:52.086 --> 02:04:09.620
That is how you attack the whole thing by actually, or say, if you're in your 20s and you want to have the healthiest baby in five years time, that you start now and someone says, you can monitor yourself, you can detox, you can prepare to have- What are you detoxing from?

02:04:10.657 --> 02:04:11.638
The spike protein?

02:04:12.178 --> 02:04:14.379
Are you detoxing from the nanoparticle?

02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:16.881
Are you detoxing from the COVID?

02:04:18.502 --> 02:04:25.006
I don't think we're detoxing from the intramuscular injection suite that we all received over the course of our lives.

02:04:25.066 --> 02:04:28.068
I don't think that's what she's talking about at all because she's a traitor.

02:04:29.798 --> 02:04:33.919
healthy babies and that then you invest whatever time into that.

02:04:33.959 --> 02:04:41.242
That's what I think really is our and as well like the internet for free speech will say our banking that costs nothing and can't be shut down.

02:04:41.802 --> 02:04:50.225
They are kind of the three key things that if we just provide them if they were available people will say well if you're a medical professional

02:04:51.005 --> 02:04:58.668
in something that guarantees also if I'm ever need medical care or hospital treatment or in a care home, I will not be coerced.

02:04:58.748 --> 02:05:05.370
My family can come and go and I will get the best care and it will be transparent and the physicians are accountable.

02:05:05.850 --> 02:05:06.831
That's what people want.

02:05:06.971 --> 02:05:08.031
I think that's what people want.

02:05:08.391 --> 02:05:12.392
But Dolores, you'll never get a system like that where everybody can believe everybody else.

02:05:13.013 --> 02:05:13.793
It's not going to happen.

02:05:13.813 --> 02:05:15.173
We're going to move on anyway.

02:05:15.594 --> 02:05:16.454
OK, perfect.

02:05:17.882 --> 02:05:19.043
That's very good.

02:05:19.083 --> 02:05:25.431
I gave more time because, Dolores, your information you're sharing with us is so valuable.

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:27.573
It was a wonderful conversation, you and Stephen.

02:05:27.593 --> 02:05:29.395
Thank you.

02:05:29.576 --> 02:05:31.878
We just have to take this opportunity, everybody.

02:05:31.918 --> 02:05:33.400
Don't follow your own agenda.

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.481
Listen to these opportunities.

02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:36.123
So while you might have your hand up,

02:05:36.784 --> 02:05:43.346
But, you know, Dolores, you're speaking such wonderful, useful information for us that please listen, everybody.

02:05:43.386 --> 02:05:44.787
Don't just wait for your own question.

02:05:45.487 --> 02:05:49.589
OK, Mark Steele, superstar with his case going on in the UK courts.

02:05:50.189 --> 02:05:50.669
Hello.

02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:51.989
Hi, Mark.

02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:53.190
Hi, Dolores.

02:05:53.210 --> 02:05:53.990
How are you doing?

02:05:54.610 --> 02:05:55.191
Good, good.

02:05:55.311 --> 02:05:56.171
Lovely to see you again.

02:05:56.912 --> 02:05:57.472
Good to see you.

02:05:57.512 --> 02:05:58.473
Well, I'll see you soon.

02:05:58.953 --> 02:06:08.159
So he's got a case going in UK courts, and we're supposed to believe it's a case that the people in charge don't want to have happen.

02:06:09.687 --> 02:06:20.913
You know, just like the case against Facebook brought by RFK is something that the state didn't want to, the COVID people, the guys in charge, the real bad guys, the globalists, they didn't want that to happen.

02:06:20.953 --> 02:06:23.174
That's RFK working against them.

02:06:23.534 --> 02:06:31.618
And this guy is working against the globalists by bringing some kind of fricking suit in the UK about probably 5G.

02:06:31.799 --> 02:06:33.199
I don't know, maybe the cameras.

02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:36.281
And they know each other well.

02:06:41.007 --> 02:06:59.221
Cumbria not only that but remember the one of the the times when I thought I was giving a very very very important presentation my fifth presentation to the UK doctors for kovat ethics this shithead Was allowed to talk before I could start presenting and for 15 minutes.

02:06:59.241 --> 02:07:08.848
He talked about how 666 was encoded into a gif of the of the X symbol for Twitter and

02:07:10.799 --> 02:07:11.580
And they allowed him.

02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:21.707
And then when he asked questions about me, he went bananas because I wouldn't say that the 5G is how they caused COVID in the beginning.

02:07:22.807 --> 02:07:28.812
It wasn't midazolam in old folks' homes, it was fucking 5G, says this shithead.

02:07:31.654 --> 02:07:34.516
And of course, Dolores Cahill's all about this guy.

02:07:35.256 --> 02:07:37.738
So we'll be together then, and I can go through the whole

02:07:40.108 --> 02:07:41.288
Listen to her response.

02:07:41.849 --> 02:08:00.938
What I was studying 20 years ago is that they can just modulate the frequency and that, say, if 40-year-olds or 20-year-olds have a specific metal in their organ, that can be in a university campus or it can be in a school.

02:08:01.838 --> 02:08:04.739
And there could be like where people have nosebleeds, right?

02:08:04.839 --> 02:08:09.300
Because that's why they rolled out the injections in different batches and different age groups.

02:08:09.881 --> 02:08:14.982
And literally they could do that all across one or two countries and then wake up in the morning.

02:08:15.042 --> 02:08:26.106
And so it's all kinds of different toxins and all kinds of different nanoparticles causing all kinds of things from magnetism to you being brain controlled by 5G.

02:08:26.586 --> 02:08:30.627
And all of these lists are missing placebo.

02:08:34.787 --> 02:08:42.869
Even if they were going to do this, still, the story would be that they wouldn't roll out all of these electromagnetic antennas into everybody.

02:08:43.209 --> 02:08:47.769
They would only roll them out in a very small number of people and the rest of them would get placebo.

02:08:48.169 --> 02:09:01.492
And if these people were seriously pushing this story, placebo would be part of their story so that they could explain to people why not very many people have metal spoons sticking to their fricking injection site.

02:09:03.183 --> 02:09:04.164
Can you see it yet?

02:09:05.124 --> 02:09:15.351
Can you see why if they are missing certain parts of the kind of obvious conclusion that anybody that was actually thinking would come to, they're missing those parts for five years?

02:09:15.771 --> 02:09:17.012
It can't be possible.

02:09:19.872 --> 02:09:23.013
morning, you could have nosebleeds or serious deaths of teenagers.

02:09:23.453 --> 02:09:31.717
But then they could say there is an Ebola outbreak together because there are different nanoparticles that resonate.

02:09:32.077 --> 02:09:33.478
So it's very specific.

02:09:33.538 --> 02:09:40.321
And I think some of the people that are being targeted to be seriously ill can be easily targeted so that they just die.

02:09:40.341 --> 02:09:42.621
You know, we die in our sleep or we drop dead or whatever.

02:09:43.022 --> 02:09:45.563
And I think it's that kind of technology.

02:09:45.623 --> 02:09:45.763
So

02:09:46.483 --> 02:09:50.926
It is a huge threat and I think private prosecution is very important.

02:09:50.966 --> 02:10:04.275
But what I've been doing and our networks as well is when you provide this information, which many of us and you have done to the police and the Supreme Courts and the regulators, it is unlawful.

02:10:04.815 --> 02:10:12.600
to and against the... So if you ask for FOIAs and you don't get any, any response, then it's evidence that they're lying.

02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:19.044
If you submit all this crazy shit to the government and they don't do anything about it, then I guess they're lying.

02:10:22.046 --> 02:10:25.488
This is like an Aaron Siri style bullshit session here.

02:10:27.529 --> 02:10:35.693
And it really feels as though Stephen Frost and Dolores Cahill and this shithead Steele, they're all just kind of in on it.

02:10:35.733 --> 02:10:37.914
Wittingly or unwittingly, they're fools.

02:10:38.014 --> 02:10:41.556
They're fools because they believe so much is true.

02:10:42.196 --> 02:10:51.301
So many fantastic stories they have and fantastic explanations for the phenomenon around them instead of just fricking murder.

02:10:52.927 --> 02:10:59.769
practice of the police to not investigate threats, which is what you're doing, Mark.

02:10:59.829 --> 02:11:20.057
And I congratulate you for the high level of information, but it means that the actual police now and the health regulators and the manufacturers putting these nanoparticles in the food and in the vaccines and in injections in dentistry

02:11:20.865 --> 02:11:29.163
they, people will figure it out in the... Wow, you can't even go to the dentist anymore according to these people because you're going to get nanoparticles injected into you.

02:11:29.724 --> 02:11:30.766
Holy shit!

02:11:31.894 --> 02:11:34.235
Holy shit, burn it all down, I guess.

02:11:34.495 --> 02:11:39.938
The years to come and we and individuals will be held to account.

02:11:40.638 --> 02:11:47.541
And also the nanoparticles are partly involved in the infertility agenda in the ovaries and in the testes as well.

02:11:47.621 --> 02:11:51.703
So, yeah, I'm agreeing with you and it is correct what you're saying.

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:52.964
Brilliant.

02:11:53.184 --> 02:11:53.504
Excellent.

02:11:53.544 --> 02:11:54.885
Well, see you soon, Dolores.

02:11:55.145 --> 02:11:55.405
God bless.

02:11:55.425 --> 02:11:55.925
See you, Mark.

02:11:56.145 --> 02:11:56.605
God bless.

02:11:56.625 --> 02:11:57.726
Thank you for all you do.

02:11:58.266 --> 02:12:00.227
Yeah, man, great job in what you're doing.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:03.741
the nation's population.

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:05.523
Oh, no, I had to play that for it.

02:12:05.564 --> 02:12:08.447
Sorry, I had more coming there because there's where Zoe is.

02:12:12.592 --> 02:12:19.059
I was studying 20 years ago is that controls and that's partly why they were bringing in the data and the gene.

02:12:19.239 --> 02:12:22.403
How are genetic and genetic and who's present.

02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:25.171
And I actually have private prosecutions.

02:12:25.531 --> 02:12:33.896
Jerry Brady has reminded you all to watch witness statement, which again is a notice to the authorities to investigate all of these crimes.

02:12:34.336 --> 02:12:39.239
All right, Zoe, Thrillkill Medical Cult.

02:12:39.259 --> 02:12:48.284
I love putting your website on there so that we can all go to your website.

02:12:48.324 --> 02:12:49.825
He's never done that for me.

02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:51.850
Wow.

02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:54.071
Go to your website, sell your book.

02:12:54.091 --> 02:12:55.032
Over to you Zoe.

02:12:56.112 --> 02:12:56.392
All right.

02:12:56.432 --> 02:12:56.773
Thank you.

02:12:56.793 --> 02:12:58.974
I can't, I think I have my view screwed up.

02:12:59.034 --> 02:13:01.455
I can't really see anybody but you Charles.

02:13:02.015 --> 02:13:03.116
Change your view.

02:13:03.176 --> 02:13:03.716
There we go.

02:13:04.156 --> 02:13:04.656
There we go.

02:13:04.836 --> 02:13:06.297
Now I can, I'm not blind.

02:13:07.298 --> 02:13:08.178
Well, hi Dolores.

02:13:08.218 --> 02:13:09.499
Thank you so much for being here.

02:13:10.979 --> 02:13:13.000
I'm actually a whistleblower in America myself.

02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:17.122
Uh, I was a medical coder working in the hospitals and I walked out over.

02:13:17.422 --> 02:13:19.843
So she's a whistleblower, but she walked out.

02:13:20.463 --> 02:13:20.863
You see?

02:13:20.963 --> 02:13:21.984
So she's full of shit.

02:13:22.044 --> 02:13:23.584
She didn't try to change anything.

02:13:24.045 --> 02:13:26.346
She didn't speak up the chain and get retaliated.

02:13:26.386 --> 02:13:27.986
She didn't even get fricking fired.

02:13:31.188 --> 02:13:36.250
She quit and wrote a book and now is getting rich by the minute because CHD is promoting her.

02:13:39.608 --> 02:13:42.489
And because Corbett Report is reporting on her.

02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:49.032
For the vaccine injury, and I wrote a book.

02:13:50.073 --> 02:13:51.013
That was one of the things.

02:13:51.693 --> 02:14:01.958
And I actually cited you in my book, your prediction in 2020, when you came out and you said when people were vaccinated, their bodies would begin to attack themselves.

02:14:02.898 --> 02:14:04.059
That's not what she said.

02:14:04.159 --> 02:14:08.861
She was talking all about how the spike protein had mimicry in it.

02:14:09.974 --> 02:14:19.479
that there were all kinds of sequences in the spike that seemed to be designed to mimic our own proteins, and that's why we would have autoimmunity.

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:24.762
And unfortunately for Dolores Cahill, I remember that shit.

02:14:25.363 --> 02:14:28.044
I have notebooks that help me remember that shit.

02:14:28.384 --> 02:14:31.106
And I remember very well what her explanation was.

02:14:31.146 --> 02:14:32.487
She even has a paper about it.

02:14:32.847 --> 02:14:36.369
Her whole expertise was protein mimicry, remember?

02:14:38.007 --> 02:14:43.151
So her story was not that transfection in general is a bad idea.

02:14:43.612 --> 02:14:46.334
It's not that intramuscular injection is a bad idea.

02:14:46.474 --> 02:14:54.601
It is that the spike has a mimicry sequences in it that cause it to create autoimmunity.

02:14:57.783 --> 02:15:07.171
And it sounds like the scripted Zoe is trying to kind of tweak that narrative a little bit, but that's absolutely positively incorrect.

02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:13.972
I did about three weeks of stream in a row about Dolores Cahill's work.

02:15:15.533 --> 02:15:16.614
Unfortunately for this...

02:15:21.716 --> 02:15:22.136
Lying!

02:15:22.637 --> 02:15:24.839
This is a absolute slam dunk.

02:15:25.039 --> 02:15:26.640
These people are scripted liars.

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:27.681
I'm sure of it.

02:15:27.981 --> 02:15:31.524
May present as sepsis, and they may go into multi-organ failure.

02:15:31.944 --> 02:15:43.453
I actually gave that testimony on the Vaxxed bus, and that was featured in the- See, the multi-organ failure and the sepsis corresponds to the story about the fact that the spike protein caused that, you see?

02:15:44.974 --> 02:15:49.398
And the spike protein was causing that when it was on the original Wuhan strain, remember?

02:15:51.328 --> 02:15:57.991
So she's reciting the exact shit narrative about a novel virus with a shitty spike that was designed to be really nasty.

02:15:58.031 --> 02:16:00.672
And that's why this virus was bad in the beginning.

02:16:00.992 --> 02:16:05.074
And that's why the spike protein therapeutics are also bad.

02:16:08.615 --> 02:16:09.055
Busted.

02:16:10.436 --> 02:16:12.397
Movie Vax 3 authorized to kill.

02:16:14.517 --> 02:16:15.878
So thank you for your warning.

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:17.629
to multi-organ failure.

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:23.593
I actually gave that testimony on the Vaxxed bus and that was featured in the movie Vax 3 Authorized to Kill.

02:16:24.153 --> 02:16:33.219
So she said the incorrect biology on the Vax 3 bus after they fired me or before they fired me, right?

02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:36.862
Why couldn't I have said that on a podcast with Brian Hooker?

02:16:38.373 --> 02:16:46.637
Why wouldn't they put a website up that explains this so you can get an explanation of what transfection is and why it would be dangerous?

02:16:47.517 --> 02:16:49.498
Why isn't that on their website somewhere?

02:16:51.339 --> 02:16:55.760
Because CHD, Brian Hooker, Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.461
are all scripted frauds.

02:16:58.101 --> 02:17:03.804
And they are probably complicit in the murder of Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn.

02:17:06.741 --> 02:17:08.141
So thank you for your warning.

02:17:08.661 --> 02:17:09.582
Thank you, Zoe.

02:17:09.662 --> 02:17:10.182
Thank you.

02:17:10.242 --> 02:17:10.642
Thank you.

02:17:10.702 --> 02:17:12.282
And of course, thank you for that.

02:17:12.382 --> 02:17:13.702
Thank you for stepping away.

02:17:13.802 --> 02:17:14.202
Thank you.

02:17:14.282 --> 02:17:16.803
I admire everyone on the VAX bus as well.

02:17:16.883 --> 02:17:17.283
Thank you.

02:17:19.203 --> 02:17:20.164
And thank you, Stephen.

02:17:20.184 --> 02:17:23.524
You already covered the first part of my question about PCR testing fraud.

02:17:24.564 --> 02:17:28.265
I'm actually on a case right now, which they're not allowing to go forward.

02:17:28.345 --> 02:17:29.745
They're silencing and censoring.

02:17:29.765 --> 02:17:30.725
I'm about to write it up.

02:17:32.006 --> 02:17:33.366
She's about to write it up.

02:17:34.889 --> 02:17:37.452
Put it on her sub stack, make some money, I guess.

02:17:38.914 --> 02:17:42.598
Even though I've been working on the case for like a year and a half now and I haven't written it up.

02:17:42.918 --> 02:17:44.180
No one's asked me to write it up.

02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:45.922
People even told me not to write it up.

02:17:45.982 --> 02:17:47.043
Like what's going on here?

02:17:50.327 --> 02:17:51.288
What's going on here?

02:17:54.707 --> 02:17:57.850
So I had a question for you, Dolores, that has to do with that.

02:17:58.410 --> 02:18:06.998
So the expert witnesses on the case are David Rasnick, who's presented here before, and Jonathan Cooey, who's presented here before.

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:09.840
Why do you need to mention those two people anyway?

02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:16.586
Why do you need to mention the other two experts on the case, other than to associate yourself with me?

02:18:22.102 --> 02:18:28.707
Also, and it's about the PCR fraud, but it has to do with genetic surveillance.

02:18:29.188 --> 02:18:32.811
Because I uncovered a document in- So she uncovered a document.

02:18:32.911 --> 02:18:34.973
Actually in the case, I'm the one who uncovered it.

02:18:36.594 --> 02:18:42.919
I uncovered the key piece of data and observation during an interview with one of these people.

02:18:43.499 --> 02:18:48.744
And then at some point they decided to bring her in, I guess, because she discovered some document.

02:18:49.653 --> 02:18:57.496
You know, like I guess Christine Massey has some FOIA requests, or Charles Rixey has a diffuse proposal that got leaked to him.

02:18:58.116 --> 02:19:00.177
She has a document.

02:19:00.737 --> 02:19:08.580
I was looking at the testing, the PCR fraud, because I actually worked in a lab at one point, and I knew that PCR was for genetic.

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:23.145
conditions originally and then it somehow it transferred over to viruses while I was doing medical coding and I wasn't looking and then COVID came out and I realized that the COVID tests were false positive and they were done by PCR.

02:19:24.086 --> 02:19:34.990
Well looking into that I discovered there was a document from the CDC that advised every CLIA certified lab in the United States to send a sequence to one of two gene banks

02:19:35.430 --> 02:19:37.813
GISAID or NCBI.

02:19:38.394 --> 02:19:50.448
And both of those gene banks say that they're there for the purposes of collecting our DNA, our genetic information, so that they can tailor vaccines to our individual genome,

02:19:50.928 --> 02:19:57.914
So she thinks that she is busting the idea that they're gonna make personalized medicine in the form of vaccines.

02:19:58.354 --> 02:20:05.980
She's pretending she has been given a document so that she can pretend that she's the one who figured this out.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:06.961
It wasn't Mark and I.

02:20:08.959 --> 02:20:13.123
It wasn't my research in that case that exposed it.

02:20:13.223 --> 02:20:19.329
It wasn't my regular repeating that there were 220 EUA granted PCR tests in America up until 2022.

02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:21.511
It was none of that work.

02:20:21.892 --> 02:20:24.234
It was her finding this fricking document.

02:20:29.318 --> 02:20:41.026
And now we have Operation Stargate announced under the Trump administration with Larry Ellison coming out and saying he's going to be able to come out with vaccines that can be tailored to our individual genome to cure cancer.

02:20:41.567 --> 02:20:45.410
And you kind of already covered both of those pieces of that.

02:20:45.510 --> 02:21:02.040
So my question to you is, since there's a lot of doubt and a lot of people who aren't aware that that was even happening, are you aware of that happening at all or in other countries other than America, that this, how PCR is used to collect our genetic information?

02:21:02.281 --> 02:21:04.222
Why aren't you saying the word remnant?

02:21:05.464 --> 02:21:11.186
If you really wanted to tell everybody, you would say that the remnants of medical procedures are sold.

02:21:11.846 --> 02:21:18.868
And by creating a endless remnant stream based on PCR, the PCR doesn't even have to work.

02:21:18.948 --> 02:21:25.750
It just has to be an excuse to swab somebody that creates the remnant that you can then sell to somebody to sequence.

02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:31.691
And she knows this because she's talked to me about it before I understood that she was this person.

02:21:33.172 --> 02:21:34.192
And she's not saying it.

02:21:36.348 --> 02:21:38.169
She's not even using the word remnant.

02:21:40.931 --> 02:21:44.254
And then how accurate do you think it is?

02:21:44.534 --> 02:21:48.757
There's claim that they can, I mean, I don't believe vaccines work.

02:21:48.797 --> 02:21:51.159
I'll just say that to just to preface.

02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:55.763
She doesn't believe vaccines work because she's a medical coder.

02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:59.684
And she quit because she's a medical coder.

02:22:00.465 --> 02:22:02.168
She is a scripted fraud.

02:22:02.408 --> 02:22:04.992
There is no doubt in my freaking mind.

02:22:05.492 --> 02:22:07.075
This is a scripted fraud.

02:22:07.115 --> 02:22:09.438
I don't think all back don't most vaccines do.

02:22:09.538 --> 02:22:10.319
Oh my gosh.

02:22:10.359 --> 02:22:10.980
What a joke.

02:22:12.482 --> 02:22:17.585
for people who are concerned about what's going to happen with these new replicon mRNA vaccines.

02:22:17.966 --> 02:22:18.986
Oh, the replicon.

02:22:19.086 --> 02:22:29.833
Oh, you know, that thing that Karmadoc asked a question about in 2021 when she was following around Robert Malone and Lee Min Yan and Ryan Cole through churches in the South.

02:22:32.955 --> 02:22:36.697
For example, and I know people are really concerned about shedding.

02:22:37.277 --> 02:22:41.600
So I'm just curious on your take, how

02:22:42.282 --> 02:22:48.385
Accurate do you think is their ability to tailor anything to our genetic?

02:22:48.785 --> 02:22:51.606
To our genome, I guess how accurate is that claim?

02:22:53.767 --> 02:23:00.951
So that's an absolutely stupid question It's a stupid stupid stupid question and it is a scripted one.

02:23:01.031 --> 02:23:04.692
There's no freaking doubt in my mind It is a scripted one.

02:23:05.293 --> 02:23:05.773
Thank you.

02:23:05.953 --> 02:23:10.055
Very good questions So

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:41.014
I think as well, just to step back a little bit, and this is just my research, what I'm going to say, I don't have 100% proof of it, but I was saying this in 2020 and all the way through, that I think that some of the agents they had in the injections will be primers and or to integrate for future positives for the next decades to come.

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:48.495
So let's say if you were to- They have planted signals for decades to come.

02:23:49.015 --> 02:23:53.836
They have primed people to be triggered by future nanoparticles.

02:23:54.076 --> 02:23:55.837
I freaking shit you not.

02:23:56.117 --> 02:24:08.339
Target nanoparticle type that go into your brain so that if you are radiated, it looks like you have a nosebleed and Ebola involves bleeding from the eyes, you know, profusely.

02:24:09.315 --> 02:24:21.273
that I think it may be that people who were injected will actually be positive for the rest of their lives, for the testing that's going to be rolled out in the decades to come.

02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:26.271
actual real positives.

02:24:26.371 --> 02:24:30.074
Do you know what I mean?

02:24:30.374 --> 02:24:38.079
So that was partly why I was very hopeful there would be a significant amount of the population in each country.

02:24:38.659 --> 02:24:44.003
And that's partly why we were getting the heritage of definitively healthy people.

02:24:44.543 --> 02:24:50.828
Because what the GenBank and the databases are doing is trying to say that this was always there.

02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:52.260
Right.

02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:53.521
So that's right.

02:24:53.661 --> 02:25:05.244
For 20 years, we have worldwide build up bio sample collections and bio repositories from people who either lived or died, you know, in the 70s, 80s to be controls.

02:25:05.664 --> 02:25:13.147
And that's partly why they were bringing in the data and the GDPR bullshit so that they can destroy those repositories of blood samples.

02:25:13.607 --> 02:25:21.053
because you can't really compare normal in 20 years time unless you have a group of population that are not vaccinated.

02:25:21.594 --> 02:25:33.864
And that's partly why I was saying that they can then say the PCR test is working, right, because they might only do the testing on people who confirm that they were vaccinated with COVID.

02:25:34.124 --> 02:25:34.384
Wow.

02:25:34.544 --> 02:25:35.685
I mean, wow.

02:25:35.765 --> 02:25:37.507
So that's one part of your question.

02:25:37.547 --> 02:25:41.270
So what they were doing with COVID is like setting it up for the next 40, 50 years.

02:25:42.611 --> 02:25:54.659
for the people who are 30 now for when they're 80, because all the various so-called pandemics and the testing has all been sequenced, you know, in their world and patented and prepared.

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:58.742
So then the other thing is about you're talking about integration then.

02:25:59.302 --> 02:26:12.051
So I guess one of the questions is, was there some kind of nucleotides in some of the vaccines that can somehow get into the genetic material?

02:26:12.971 --> 02:26:15.694
and be there for some time is the question.

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:18.836
And I think the answer is yes.

02:26:19.396 --> 02:26:23.480
And I think it's done by mechanisms called transposons.

02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:33.808
So I think the thing about whether there's a virus or not, it's a little bit more nuanced because the body works on smaller strings.

02:26:33.948 --> 02:26:35.289
It's a little more nuanced.

02:26:35.489 --> 02:26:39.232
Oh, maybe she's going to mention micro RNA and the regulation of RNA.

02:26:39.272 --> 02:26:40.113
And no, she's not.

02:26:40.193 --> 02:26:41.054
She's a traitor.

02:26:41.354 --> 02:26:53.763
let's say mRNA, we'll say DNA just for because it's a little bit, it can be either mRNA, RNA or DNA, but they're only about 30 base pairs long.

02:26:54.810 --> 02:27:06.296
What the body and the immune system sees is only a small little fragment, like Smarties, whereas the actual genome is much bigger, maybe a million times bigger.

02:27:06.336 --> 02:27:13.960
Damage-associated molecular patterns is what people think the immune system memorizes, and they are short patterns, yes.

02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:15.821
This is all absurdity.

02:27:16.261 --> 02:27:31.249
Remember what I said earlier, her story in 2020, which they don't seem to want you to know, is that she was saying the spike protein had specific sequences in it that mimicked our own proteins and that that would cause the autoimmunity.

02:27:31.329 --> 02:27:36.071
She is a scripted liar because it doesn't matter what protein you transfect.

02:27:36.111 --> 02:27:37.512
If you transfect a protein,

02:27:38.172 --> 02:27:44.316
like this into a person, you will cause autoimmunity because it's just the way the body works.

02:27:44.416 --> 02:27:46.158
It's not a natural process.

02:27:46.558 --> 02:27:50.280
You're not administering anything natural and the response cannot be predicted.

02:27:50.721 --> 02:27:55.584
So even more, you can't learn anything about the response in people if you do it in animals.

02:27:55.644 --> 02:28:02.549
So in order for them to make any progress on future genetic technologies, they must do all experiments on people.

02:28:03.009 --> 02:28:07.292
And so she's advocating for a private institution to also sample the blood a couple times

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:11.736
a year to see if they're, they're, uh, metabolically healthy or not.

02:28:11.836 --> 02:28:14.859
Does she even realize how stupid that sounds?

02:28:17.003 --> 02:28:19.205
What if somebody doesn't eat for nine hours?

02:28:19.285 --> 02:28:21.787
Is their blood going to indicate that they're malnourished?

02:28:22.327 --> 02:28:24.508
What markers is she going to look for?

02:28:24.869 --> 02:28:27.471
This is so freaking bullshit.

02:28:28.231 --> 02:28:40.880
And the fact that this Zoe Smith is performing with Corbett and performing with her while casually saying my name is freaking evidence that these people are part of the malevolent show.

02:28:42.902 --> 02:28:45.504
And I think the whole system works on

02:28:46.977 --> 02:28:52.241
these little fragments, so that those little fragments can easily integrate.

02:28:52.261 --> 02:28:55.824
Do you mean the little fragments that Epibax was looking for?

02:28:55.904 --> 02:28:57.886
The super antigens?

02:28:57.946 --> 02:29:02.830
Are you going to use any terms that belie a greater understanding?

02:29:02.850 --> 02:29:05.012
Or are you just going to babble your bullshit?

02:29:05.032 --> 02:29:16.121
Integrate into the hereditary genetic material, into chromosomes, into the material in your ovaries or in the sperm.

02:29:17.082 --> 02:29:26.769
you know, or the testes, and they integrate, and then they can come out if you're stressed or if that cell starts dividing.

02:29:27.189 --> 02:29:35.655
And I think they have many different elements that will come to the fore in the years and decades to come.

02:29:36.236 --> 02:29:46.103
And I- You might as well give up because in the years and decades to come, these already deployed nanoparticles are going to be unleashed or triggered.

02:29:48.407 --> 02:30:02.241
That's what she's saying in cooperation with this woman named Zoe Smith who keeps pimping everything she can about my ideas as if they were her own and just freaking lied about what this woman said in 2020.

02:30:02.481 --> 02:30:08.427
I fear that that integration will be multi-generational and

02:30:10.254 --> 02:30:11.014
multi-generational.

02:30:11.034 --> 02:30:13.275
The nation's population unites physically.

02:30:13.995 --> 02:30:14.796
Governments fall.

02:30:15.176 --> 02:30:19.637
I've heard 9%, but golly gosh, I'm sure America and Australia are at least 20%.

02:30:19.858 --> 02:30:26.700
And we're in a spiritual war, and I think Daria will tell us something.

02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:28.761
She put something in the chat that's very interesting.

02:30:29.281 --> 02:30:31.522
So all of us, we keep on the fight, Zoe, and

02:30:32.222 --> 02:30:33.303
You know, thank you, Zoe.

02:30:33.323 --> 02:30:34.644
We're up for the fight.

02:30:34.684 --> 02:30:35.104
Thank you.

02:30:35.625 --> 02:30:45.753
And, you know, when you were speaking and Zoe was speaking, I had shivers, you know, which I always feel that's like the message from the divine that we're on the right track.

02:30:45.813 --> 02:30:47.655
But it's wonderful to hear 1.8 million.

02:30:48.335 --> 02:30:51.318
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to I'm not putting up with this anymore.

02:30:51.338 --> 02:30:55.782
These people are scripted liars, and it doesn't matter how charming or sweet they sound.

02:30:57.043 --> 02:31:01.026
That's the Irish version of Judy Mikovits for shit's sake.

02:31:02.452 --> 02:31:16.782
because there's no way in hell she doesn't understand that there's an irreducibly complex background of bacteriophages and bacteria signals and countless other signals that are not able to be differentiated from in a clinical sample with a simple PCR reaction.

02:31:16.842 --> 02:31:20.304
She knows that and she's lying about all these other things.

02:31:20.765 --> 02:31:24.967
She also is very, very, very, very easily could know about this.

02:31:25.967 --> 02:31:27.728
but she doesn't because she's on a script.

02:31:28.149 --> 02:31:36.374
She can't see that in her own country, an anticipated rise in old people was managed using murder and lies to create the illusion of the pandemic.

02:31:36.394 --> 02:31:37.675
She just can't see it.

02:31:38.296 --> 02:31:41.098
After six years, she just can't see it.

02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:45.040
She just can't see it.

02:31:45.081 --> 02:31:47.742
She's never even bothered to try and come up with a list.

02:31:48.623 --> 02:31:51.145
Most of the time, the list only contains one thing.

02:31:51.505 --> 02:31:53.166
Madazolam is on my list.

02:31:53.246 --> 02:31:55.448
It's been on there for a fricking long time.

02:31:57.193 --> 02:31:58.834
but it's just one piece of a list.

02:32:00.536 --> 02:32:02.497
It doesn't rule out all these other things.

02:32:05.239 --> 02:32:08.081
No one's ever gotten to the point where they question endemicity.

02:32:08.241 --> 02:32:14.806
Wouldn't that be a great place for these no virus people to get to as another way to hack at this, but they keep hacking at the same things.

02:32:15.467 --> 02:32:17.008
They keep stuck in the same place.

02:32:17.528 --> 02:32:22.052
And that's why they also, none of these people hypothesize that maybe placebos would be beneficial.

02:32:22.995 --> 02:32:29.161
that maybe they could hide all this fancy different technology they're rolling out by making the vast majority placebos.

02:32:29.861 --> 02:32:34.866
No one on their side has fricking thought of that because they are scripted liars.

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:45.635
That's the same reason why none of them have ever gotten clever enough to say that using their tests to find their ghosts will never make their ghosts real and nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

02:32:47.056 --> 02:32:47.537
I got there.

02:32:49.810 --> 02:32:52.112
It's because this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

02:32:52.152 --> 02:32:53.594
It's for the grandchildren of Earth.

02:32:53.614 --> 02:32:56.376
That's why we have this fake anti-vax movement around the world.

02:32:57.317 --> 02:32:59.919
Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, nobody says it better than us.

02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:01.401
See you again tomorrow.

02:33:32.153 --> 02:33:37.139
If you liked what you saw, please consider going to GigaOM Biological and finding a way to support this work.

02:33:37.739 --> 02:33:39.882
The voice that you heard was that of Jonathan Cooey.

02:33:39.922 --> 02:33:41.704
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:33:41.744 --> 02:33:48.952
You can find the record of my academic work on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website using my last name, my first two initials, JJ.

02:33:49.433 --> 02:33:52.216
You can also buy that Wuhan cover-up book and learn a lot of this stuff.

02:33:53.197 --> 02:33:58.320
You know, Jay Bhattacharya could tell you what he knows from me, but he's not a biologist, so he can't really explain it.

02:33:58.721 --> 02:34:00.242
I've got a YouTube channel or two.

02:34:00.982 --> 02:34:04.705
I'm streaming on JC on a bike right now because I don't have a thing there.

02:34:05.625 --> 02:34:10.409
And remember, if you can't support the work financially, that's fine, but please try to find a way to share it.

02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:13.651
If you can share it with email, that would be great.

02:34:14.411 --> 02:34:15.552
People read emails.

02:34:16.272 --> 02:34:20.295
And if you want to support the stream, please go to GigaOM Biological and find a way to do it.

02:34:20.335 --> 02:34:22.517
Thank you very, very, very much.

02:34:23.658 --> 02:34:28.302
Shout out to all those people who have already taken that step.

02:34:29.263 --> 02:34:30.264
You make this possible.

02:34:30.284 --> 02:34:30.945
Thank you very much.
