01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
It was quite a plot, you kids, uncovered.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Who would have suspected masters of dog-napping his own pet?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
He decided to win the dog show by dog-napping the only three dogs

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
who could beat Big Red.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Then Big Red was to turn up just before the show and win first prize.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
You said something about a phantom Indian on horseback. What about that?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Simple. He used a movie projector from the back of his truck.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Look, Jeronimo! He's back again!

02:26.000 --> 02:38.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Gigong Biological.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
It's a high-resistance low-noise information brought to you by a biologist.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
It's the 14th of September, September, 2023.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
That means it's throwback Thursday.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
You'll notice these last few slides aren't changing in a while.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
It's because we're pretty solid on track here.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
Lots of people are starting to come to understand the pandemic as one great big Scooby Doo.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
And I think it's a really apt description of what's going on.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Thank you very much for joining me. This is Gigong Biological High-Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
My name is Jonathan Cooey, and this is going to be a little quick throwback Thursday hour

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
where I want to review a German video from 2021.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
It should kind of help you not take the bait on TV and social media.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
There's just a lot of that going on right now.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And so I just want to be sure that we all...

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, I almost made that work.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Then we're all on the same page here.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
You know, Sesame Street and PBS NewsHour are now making coloring sheets where the bravery bandage is there

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
in order to invite children to color this page to celebrate getting vaccinated.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.000
There's not a whole hell of a lot we can do about this aspect of things at this moment.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Other than to highlight the absurdity of such a coloring page.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
But be aware that it's there and be aware of...

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
well, how seductive these kinds of things are.

04:50.000 --> 04:59.000
I think I'm going to try and go getvaccineanswers.org and see what's to be found there.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
So a few people or many people, lots of people inside and outside of government,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
inside and outside of industry, inside and outside of social media have changed the way we think.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
And it is the kind of lemming, herd mentality, conformist fear of speaking out that happens.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
The larger the group gets that social media has now sort of replaced with a fake feeling of consensus.

05:27.000 --> 05:37.000
And that fake feeling of consensus has been weaponized against us to make us think that certain things are really smart to think about.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
And certain kinds of simplifications and certain kinds of over complications are normal.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
And we accept them because other people on TV accept them.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And as a result, they've been able to change our minds about our own biology.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
They've changed our minds about our vulnerability to respiratory viruses and why we might be vulnerable.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
They've changed our idea of why we all die every year, why there's 3 million people to die every year in America.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
They've changed the way we think about our own immune response to disease and kind of inverted it on his head to make us think exclusively about antibodies

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
when there are a whole host of other autonomous cells that fight viral and pathological infection as well.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
And then they change the way we think about immunization and vaccination and how that is achieved, how immunity is achieved through these two methodologies.

06:36.000 --> 06:50.000
And this suite of changes was able to be achieved largely through the application of pressure, coercion and fear.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And that caused doctors to change their behavior.

06:53.000 --> 07:07.000
It caused teachers to change their behavior and school boards and businesses and lawyers and people inside of the government and police officers and EMTs and everyone.

07:07.000 --> 07:18.000
And that resulted in millions of people dying for the wrong reason, maybe not even for a good reason, not a legitimate one, but a mistake.

07:18.000 --> 07:30.000
And so this is why it's a crime, this is why we have to investigate it because maybe hundreds of thousands of people were improperly treated, maybe even millions.

07:30.000 --> 07:42.000
And even on the small possibility that that's true, we need to back the truck up and figure out what's going on.

07:42.000 --> 08:01.000
And I believe that there are a lot of people again on TV and on social media and in the spotlight and behind the scenes that are working against the possibility that it will become common knowledge that a pandemic isn't really biologically possible.

08:01.000 --> 08:10.000
And that the only way an RNA sequence can show up in so many places at once in the world is as if it would put their insufficient quantity.

08:10.000 --> 08:19.000
Otherwise, it's just not possible. And that's really where this whole story starts and ends.

08:19.000 --> 08:29.000
And by controlling the discussion about the possibilities underlying the biology of the pandemic, i.e. what are the causes?

08:29.000 --> 08:42.000
What is the root cause of the pandemic? By controlling that debate very carefully from the very beginning, like the first day, that's how we got here.

08:42.000 --> 09:01.000
And we grossly underestimate, underestimated, especially in 2020, the extent to which they would go to control both sides of the narrative.

09:02.000 --> 09:23.000
And so a lot of the people that came out quite early in the pandemic are actually people that are unwittingly were involved in controlling that narrative that slowly evolved from a natural virus to a lab leak, eventually to a gain of function virus that was a lab leak.

09:24.000 --> 09:49.000
And this slow escalation of the severity of the story, the severity of the potential has actually worked perfectly in concert with the intended the intended plan to put more pressure on people to accept the countermeasures

09:49.000 --> 09:58.000
and to accept the idea that something bad happened and potentially it could be much worse next time.

09:58.000 --> 10:08.000
And now what I find such an interesting pattern here is that the people that have really questioned this narrative in all of its best forms,

10:08.000 --> 10:26.000
those people are largely marginalized and don't really gain much recognition relative to the people who have largely been on the side of this gain of function laboratory leak and the idea that it could come again and the idea that maybe the shots are screwed up because they were rushed, but we can fix them next time.

10:27.000 --> 10:49.000
That seems to be largely this what everybody in the red triangle thinks only people in the yellow have questioned more than the shot have questioned the novelty of the virus have questioned the sanctity of vaccine induced immunity have questioned the the primacy of of antibody based immunity.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
These people have been marginalized and for the most part cast out now as we have pushed forward over the course of these last three years.

10:58.000 --> 11:22.000
Some of these people have been have been absorbing some aspects of the skeptical narrative in the middle here where the protocols are still a question where spread is a question where variants are questioned those are not anything that anyone over here has really absorbed significantly.

11:22.000 --> 11:35.000
But just a little bit now has been absorbed some of the the the really true objections they're always going to be able to morph a little bit over here.

11:35.000 --> 11:48.000
And so that's what this is all about a controlled narrative and having people on both sides that you can trust that you know are not going to cross any big lines of the faith which is the novel virus we had to do something.

11:49.000 --> 11:59.000
The mRNA was rushed but it could have been better and it's since it was gained a function it could come again.

11:59.000 --> 12:17.000
And so I don't have to tell you that the the pandemic potential of bat caves that's accessible through cell culture and accessible through animal passage and also can be even enhanced by genetic manipulation is a suite of mythologies that has been laid down over the last

12:17.000 --> 12:33.000
couple decades with the overarching plan of using this mythology as an excuse for us to surrender our rights and invert from human rights to human permissions.

12:34.000 --> 12:53.000
And that's what the Scooby-Doo is about because again you're solving the mystery you think you solve the mystery everybody right now on TV and social media to the most part thinks that the lab leak is kind of a conclusion that everybody should come to because after the last three years it's obvious that they covered it up.

12:54.000 --> 13:12.000
Now I just want to point out here that the scenario that Dr. Giordano points out in his video is the idea that you see in a few sentinel cases and then you use the internet to claim asymptomatic transmission and then also you claim responsibility.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
Yes, I'm a terrorist and I released this bio weapon on you but then the real weapon I use is the internet.

13:20.000 --> 13:33.000
Right now the thing about that story and what's different about our story is that in that story he's telling a fictional story to a room of people who are in the military.

13:34.000 --> 13:45.000
And so it's a terrorist organization trying to use a bio weapon to scare a country into fragmenting and not trusting its government anymore.

13:46.000 --> 14:08.000
Now the scenario of seeding cases is very real but how would a national actor or a group of national actors come on to the scene and say that they may be involved in the virus in some way without saying that they're involved in the virus in some way.

14:08.000 --> 14:19.000
Well, the way that they would do it is they'd say first it's natural and then they would be caught in a cover up which is essentially like a whistleblower that comes out and says,

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Hey, I found a grant proposal and so it is basically the same story.

14:26.000 --> 14:46.000
We have a few seated cases of high fidelity likely clone generated sequences that are all the same from lots of different places in the world and those viruses don't change very much for the first six months because they originated from a clone.

14:46.000 --> 15:04.000
And then at some moment the PCR is not picking up that signal anymore but in fact is being used all over the world where that signal could have never gotten and picking up background coronavirus and over cycling of the PCR made that even worse.

15:04.000 --> 15:22.000
And so then here we are signaling a spreading virus went over only a very small portion of it ever had that sequence only a very small portion of it could have ever really been part of the original thing and none of it could have possibly been generated

15:22.000 --> 15:37.000
by a point release in Wuhan because then the virus that went to Italy would have been different forever from the virus that went to Africa or North America and that sequence would have never been Delta everywhere,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Omicron everywhere or anything like that.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
That's not even remotely possible.

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
That's the worst part of the narrative on television.

15:50.000 --> 16:05.000
And so the only way that this works the only way that it really makes sense is if there was a background signal and then there was the release of a clone to trigger the molecular signal around the world that you know some molecular biologists could call each other up and say

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
we got a new one over here too and it's the same, I think it's the same sequence as yours.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Wow, really?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So is mine.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
Wow, really ours is the same too, which is just not possible.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
And the only remotely close example we have of that is SARS-1.

16:23.000 --> 16:34.000
The only data set we have from that is Alina Chan and that data set's not published but it clearly showed that the SARS-1 virus was changing at a much higher rate

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
at the beginning when it first came out than this one ever achieved.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And so how is that really possible?

16:43.000 --> 16:55.000
Well, it's only possible if we're looking at a background stable signal that's being, let's say, it's being misconstrued as spread.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
So if there is SARS virus in the background everywhere, then everywhere we sequence, we'd expect to find different ones.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
And so all they need to do is just tell us some story about a phylogeny, some story about change.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
And every time they want to make it serious, they can pick one that looks serious.

17:11.000 --> 17:20.000
It's just not a genuine tale of high fidelity molecular biology mystery solving.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
That's not what's happening on the gen-set database or whatever it's called.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
It's a carefully curated, probably, library of nonsense.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
And that's the unfortunate part is there are just some people who are going to be spectacularly committed to the lie.

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
And have you believe that before the pandemic, we only had a few hundred, maybe even 50, full sequences of a coronavirus.

17:50.000 --> 18:02.000
And now, since we put our mind to it, we have several hundred thousand sequences of a coronavirus and a very detailed phylogeny of its evolution over the last three years.

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
That in no way compares to any other phylogeny that we've ever measured in nature because we've never been able to do that before.

18:09.000 --> 18:27.000
And with the only one that we could have kind of done it with, we only got a few hundred sequences that show a speed of change, five orders of magnitude higher than this one, five times as much as this one.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
It's just incredible where we're at.

18:34.000 --> 18:45.000
So yeah, they released this virus and then they let out people that could tell us the story about what happened, which eventually became some debate between nature and a lab leak.

18:45.000 --> 18:57.000
And the truth is, is that with careful study and review, we've come to the conclusion that transfection is not immunization, that intramuscular injection is not a means of immunization.

18:58.000 --> 19:06.000
And so let's get right up to it. The Paul Schreier Pandemic Simulation Games is our throwback Thursday.

19:06.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm very excited about this because I think it's a really good video for us to share together.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So let's check it out.

19:28.000 --> 19:40.000
Hello, my name is Paul Schreier. I'm a freelance journalist, author and co-editor of the magazine Multipolar.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Today, I would like to talk about occurrences connected to the corona pandemic.

19:44.000 --> 19:55.000
The title of my talk, Pandemic Simulation Exercises Preparations for a New Age, indicates that it won't be about the present corona crisis, but about what has happened before.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Indeed, most interesting events have taken place, to be specific pandemic simulations.

20:01.000 --> 20:17.000
The situation we are experiencing right now, the fear of a virus and ensuing measures that extremely restrict liberties, is exactly the situation that has been repeatedly and intensely trained and rehearsed in the past years, with all kinds of infectious disease simulations.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
What I am going to present to you now, are not speculations, but well-recorded and documented facts.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I have chosen the subtitle Preparations for a New Age.

20:32.000 --> 20:46.000
Well, many people are under the impression that a new era has begun with this crisis, and that it might not be a good era, but one in which democratic structures are dismantled, an age in which liberties are phased out, reduced and abolished.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
With this talk, I would like to go some way towards a wider view, a more historical perspective.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Let me just briefly say a few words about the table of contents.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
I will begin in the 1990s. Indeed, it was already in the 90s that we had the fight against terror as a political instrument.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Then I will present several bioterror simulation exercises.

21:07.000 --> 21:20.000
After that, we will take a look at the very interesting lockstep scenario in 2010, and then investigate a few more recent pandemic simulation exercises that were executed during the Trump presidency.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
My final topic are the events at the stock market in September 2019.

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
In my view, this is an interesting, a crucial topic, which you do not find in the book that I have written about this subject.

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
So, for all of you who have already read my book, this topic probably contains information which might be new for you.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
Yes, a new era is beginning. What is the era that has come to an end?

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, of course, it is the era of the Cold War, which has ended in 1990.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Let us briefly recall what kind of age it was.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
As you all know, it was marked by the two superpowers confronting each other to Soviet Union on the one side and the US on the other.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
Or to put it more generally, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc facing each other.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
Both were heavily armed with nuclear weapons and threatened each other with total annihilation.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
That was the global situation from approximately 1945 until 1990.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
It was a situation shaped by a lot of fears and great insecurity.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Many people were afraid of the threat of nuclear war.

22:27.000 --> 22:38.000
Now, is it entirely crazy to think that they might not have had 5,000 nuclear warheads in the USSR aimed at us?

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
And we might not have had 3,000 warheads aimed at them.

22:43.000 --> 22:53.000
That the Soviet Union might not have had enough warheads to destroy the Earth 8 times over and we didn't have enough to destroy it 5 times over.

22:53.000 --> 23:06.000
But it was useful to tell that story, useful to tell that story in secret meetings, useful to tell that story on the second page of a newspaper or in the editorial.

23:07.000 --> 23:17.000
Have you ever considered the possibility that even if we could make nuclear weapons that we wouldn't make thousands of them?

23:17.000 --> 23:33.000
And yet somehow if you question the whole narrative possibility of nuclear weapons and whether they exist, it's not the same as questioning if they exist would we make thousands of them?

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
And could we make ones that are 10 times the size of the ones we used to have?

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
And if we could, why would we make them?

23:43.000 --> 23:55.000
And so I think it's worth considering now that we're looking at the pandemic as a Scooby-Doo to think about how many other facts in history are actually kind of the same thing.

23:55.000 --> 24:09.000
An exaggeration of what really happened in order to make sure that the mythology around that historical event or that series of historical events could be used to govern in the future.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think it's really important point.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Which was an absolutely real possibility.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Several times an outbreak of a nuclear war was imminent.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
1962 there was the Cuban Missile Crisis.

24:21.000 --> 24:32.000
In the 80s as well there were a few highly precarious situations that might readily have escalated into a full-scale nuclear war, which was only prevented with a lot of luck at the last moment.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
At least that's how we see it today.

24:34.000 --> 24:43.000
So when you put the above in a wider historical context, that Cold War period was an absolutely crazy time with a threat so massive and existential.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
But this period came to a close in 1990, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
A great sigh of relief was felt all over the world.

24:53.000 --> 25:06.000
The Soviet Union disintegrated, there was Glaznosten, Paris Troika, a process that had already begun in the second half of the 80s when reforms were initiated in Eastern Bloc countries that led to greater liberties.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
People breath the size of relief.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
With the sense of greater freedom, fears dissipated not only for the populace of former communist countries.

25:15.000 --> 25:24.000
That was basically the attitude towards life from the 1990s onwards, not all over the world of course, but in great many parts of it, especially in the Eastern Bloc.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
That period, however, did not please everyone.

25:32.000 --> 25:40.000
There were influential groups of people that had a big problem with this kind of development, for example the military and the entire defense complex.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
Because with the collapse of the USSR, the enemy was gone.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
How could you now justify to maintain such an immense military budget?

25:49.000 --> 25:59.000
Here we have the picture of an American aircraft carrier, which is the symbol par excellence for the security state and the military, the necessity of exercising power all over the world,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
for which the military juggernaut and such weapon systems are needed.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
How could that be justified from now on?

26:10.000 --> 26:20.000
Well, I found a striking quote of Colin Powell from this period, who at that time was the highest military official of the US and thus the chief military advisor to the president.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Later he became Secretary of State.

26:23.000 --> 26:33.000
In 1991, he said in a newspaper interview, with a slightly sarcastic undertone, but he certainly was serious, I'm running out of demons. I'm running out of villains.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm down to Castro and Kim Il-sung.

26:38.000 --> 26:50.000
At the time, Castro was president of Cuba and Kim Il-sung, president of North Korea, thus referring to two of the few remaining communist countries that couldn't seriously serve as formidable enemies.

26:50.000 --> 27:01.000
The countries were way too insignificant and much too weak in regards to their military force, so how could the US claim an earnest after 1990 that a strong military complex was still needed?

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
It wasn't that context and with that key problem that the fight against terror began in the 90s.

27:11.000 --> 27:20.000
It truly was a historical turning point, symbolized by the change of political actors. President George Bush Sr. was succeeded by Bill Clinton.

27:20.000 --> 27:28.000
Bush had been strongly influenced by the Cold War. It was not only as CIA director in the 70s that he could be called a cold warrior.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
So that transition of power from Bush to Clinton steered up hope.

27:32.000 --> 27:43.000
Yes, the election of Clinton was a sign of hope for many. He was not at all considered a hawk, but an open-minded young president who was inaugurated in January 1993.

27:44.000 --> 27:53.000
Just a few weeks later, there was a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York, with the Twin Towers still erect since this was long before 9-11.

27:54.000 --> 28:05.000
The detonation in the underground car park of the North Tower, here a picture from February 1993, was the greatest ever terror attack in the history of the USA with 700 injured.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The car park was completely devastated.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
The intention was to bring down those towers, a scheme that was ultimately accomplished in 2001.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
The backers of this bombing are said to have been Islamists.

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
The next year President Clinton announced his national security strategy, something that per se was not that unusual.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Basically, almost every president releases ANS as report.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
Clinton here specified his vision and explained where he intended to set his priorities.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I would like to quote from it, because it is quite interesting.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
Clinton said that the Cold War may be over, but the need for American leadership abroad remains as strong as ever.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
I am committed to forging a new public consensus to sustain our active engagement abroad.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
Well, this is, so to speak, code language. You might be familiar with that kind of wording.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
Active engagement abroad means nothing other than military interventions abroad or wars, just sugarcoating.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
The crucial point here is that Clinton expresses the need for public consensus.

29:16.000 --> 29:25.000
He makes clear that he desires consensus so that we can continue to use our military anywhere, which means this consensus did not exist at the time.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
To the contrary, there were heated debates.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
People said we want a peace DVD now. That was the cue.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
We want the money that for decades was spent for armament, those funds should now be used for building our own national economy.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Our society should benefit. The defense budget should be reduced.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
And indeed, in the 1990s, the budget was cut back because of public pressure.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
So that was 1994, and now we get to 1995, or more specifically, March 95.

29:59.000 --> 30:08.000
This is a picture of Joe Biden, now US President, who 25 years ago already had an important function as he headed the Senate Judiciary Committee.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Here he is pictured in the Senate introducing a law.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
It was a law that should give more power to the president and in general to the executive branch in case of a major terror attack.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
That law was met with great resistance at the time.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Looking into press archives, we can see that there was a passionate debate on that law.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
We learned that influential civil liberties groups immediately went to the barricades and expressed that that was going too far.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
No special powers for the president and the government. Everything should be democratically controlled.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
We do not want that law. Great resistance.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
A few weeks later, in April 95, another terrorist attack happened.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
This time it was aimed at a federal building in Oklahoma City.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
Since this was before 9-11, the attack was again the largest and deadliest single terrorist attack in US history.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Around 170 people died and roughly 1,000 were injured.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
We can see that the damage is immense, a truck bomb with two tons of explosives.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
It was a gigantic damage.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
Public attention on the subject of terrorism skyrocketed with this attack and remained high for a long time afterwards.

31:26.000 --> 31:35.000
This attack on the federal building in Oklahoma City truly was a milestone, a divide, a defining moment for the subject of terrorism.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Now the danger of terrorism was perceived differently. It attained new meaning.

31:43.000 --> 31:52.000
There is a lot of secondary footage from the Oklahoma City bombing which indicated that there were several devices on the site.

31:53.000 --> 32:05.000
A guy by the name of Ted Gunderson has been reporting for a very long time that actually you can't make an explosion like what was done there in the federal building where I just blew up one side of the street

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and took down the whole face of that building.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
He said it was some kind of device called the Pineapple Bomb which had some kind of directionality to it.

32:16.000 --> 32:34.000
But anyway, already back in 1997 there was quite a good portion of the people that were reading understood that it was likely that whatever happened in Oklahoma City was being orchestrated and covered it up.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Timothy McVey wasn't some mastermind dude.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Certainly not somebody capable of doing that.

32:42.000 --> 32:49.000
Writing this wave, the wave of terrorism so to speak, fears were fueled.

32:53.000 --> 33:04.000
This year is a newspaper article from 1997. It was however not written by journalists but by politicians, namely the CIA director at the time, James Woolsey, and a very high Pentagon official.

33:05.000 --> 33:12.000
The title of the article is Defend Against a Shadow Enemy.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
The first sentence directly refers to the two great attacks which I just mentioned, to quote,

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
the destruction of the federal building in Oklahoma City and the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York shocked Americans.

33:26.000 --> 33:35.000
But, and this is the pivotal point, those tragedies would have been far worse if nuclear, biological or chemical materials had been involved.

33:36.000 --> 33:47.000
The authors further on in the article explain that the danger of chemical and biological weapons in the hands of terrorists is real and would be the most likely physical threat to the US homeland.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Great efforts need to be put in to guard against it.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
This article is only one example of the media campaign at that time.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
A lot of articles were actually published in this vein.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Now I would like to present you another example of the same year.

34:08.000 --> 34:17.000
William Cohen, then Secretary of Defense, announced during a press conference here at the top on the agenda that chemical and biological weapons would be likely.

34:17.000 --> 34:46.000
I really need you to see that this is so parallel to what Marco like has been teaching us and bringing to us on his show, which is that around the turn before the year 2000, there was this ongoing campaign to again pivot this threat from terrorism to bioterrorism and chemical and biological weapons.

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
And so here we are in 1997, William Cohen is already in front of the Pentagon talking about it.

34:54.000 --> 35:06.000
I think William Cohen might be the guy who goes on ABC News and says that a flower bag size with a bag of flowers saying this much anthrax could kill a lot of people like a city or something.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
The elements of future warfare and with that claim he justifies to put one billion dollar more into the defense budget within the next five years.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
So you can see that from the beginning we are dealing with large sums of money, huge budgets justified by that.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
In the same year William Cohen appeared before the press in quite a different manner as guest on a morning show.

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
That was not like a press briefing at the Pentagon, but a program where the viewers usually are not confronted with politics.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
We sat there on the morning show holding up a five pound bag of sugar.

35:48.000 --> 36:01.000
He said if Saddam Hussein sprayed an equivalent amount of anthrax over a city like Washington DC, at least half of the inhabitants would with one breath be sent into writhing death throes and probably die within five days.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
There you go. I told you.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Most of the TV show were speechless and backed him to stop.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
This TV appearance made waves in the press because the example had been so drastic.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
It is quite clear. I can't help but identify such a statement as fear mongering or scare tactics.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It obviously was employed to trigger extreme fears.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
People were talked into believing that they were in immediate mortal danger. That was the mood.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
In the second half of the 90s, that kind of gloom was worked up more and more.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
On the one side, a new threat was declared and debated.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
On the other side, that self-same dangerous weaponry was being fabricated by U.S. facilities at one and the same time.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
This is an interesting fact unbeknownst to me before I did research on this subject.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
In 1997, highly questionable research into bio warfare agents was conducted in the U.S.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
There was, for example, the covert CIA project Clear Vision, an effort to create a bacteria bomblet.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
Project Jefferson of the Pentagon's DIA was aiming to reproduce a genetically modified strain of the anthrax bacterium.

37:13.000 --> 37:20.000
These laboratory studies of offensive biological weapons agents were conducted in absolute secrecy without any parliamentary control.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
It was only in September 2001 that these doings were unveiled in a New York Times article.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
There upon a press conference was convened.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
The Pentagon claimed that it was mere defensively-minded research, which is of course quite nonsensical.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
When bio warfare agents are created in secret, it's certainly not defensive research.

37:44.000 --> 37:53.000
At that time, this man took center stage, Colonel Robert Cadlak, who had served as UN bio weapons inspector in the Iraq War in 1991.

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
He was one of the leading U.S. bio weapons experts, who in 1998, in an internal strategy paper of the Pentagon, wrote the following.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
This quote was pointed out to me by my colleague Doug Pullman. It is remarkable and he serves closer attention.

38:12.000 --> 38:20.000
Using biological weapons under the cover of an endemic or natural disease occurrence provides an attacker the potential for plausible denial.

38:21.000 --> 38:33.000
Biological warfare's potential to create significant economic loss and subsequent political instability, coupled with plausible denial, exceeds the possibilities of any other known weapon.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
The nyre-cram of loss and subsequent-

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Do you hear this?

38:39.000 --> 38:50.000
Using biological weapons under the cover of an endemic or natural disease occurrence provides an attacker the potential for plausible denial.

38:51.000 --> 39:03.000
Biological warfare's potential to create significant economic loss and subsequent political instability, coupled with plausible denial, exceeds the possibilities of any other known weapon.

39:08.000 --> 39:23.000
If you use a bio weapon that is able to be plausibly denied because it's also endemic, it's the best kind of bio weapon, says Robert Cadlak.

39:24.000 --> 39:51.000
So if you had a background of coronaviruses and then you used a coronavirus to claim that there was a pandemic and then piggybacked on the background in order to cause the pandemic with PCR, do you see how easy it is to see how these subtle changes in the way that Robert Cadlak speaks or the way that the Giordano speaks?

39:51.000 --> 40:16.000
That you can get really quickly toward a scenario where an absolutely harmless exosomic signal called coronaviruses that had been looked at as a possibility for a wide variety of biological tech applications has now suddenly become the central danger that mother nature presents to us

40:16.000 --> 40:32.000
in an everlasting potential danger in the future because people can tweak them and then now we have Robert Cadlak saying in 1998 that the best one would be to have a virus that was also endemic so then you can kind of use it as an excuse.

40:33.000 --> 40:45.000
And so you can already see them thinking about how can they use the endemic signal, how can they use an existing virus as a weapon?

40:45.000 --> 41:00.000
And then you get somebody like Giordano or someone else who taught Giordano to come along and say, hey, we don't even need a weapon if we can convince people that what is out there represents the potential for danger.

41:00.000 --> 41:20.000
So that if they just test positive for something, they might already take on the average, very dangerous treatments in order to avoid this hypothetical worst-case scenario outcome from this non-able thing that's actually just a signal in the background and they don't even know it.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I hear it perfectly.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
Those sentences must be regarded within the historical context of the late 90s.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
Robert Cadlak warns that enemies of the USA might use such bio-weapons against them.

41:35.000 --> 41:43.000
When you read the paper carefully, however, you notice that the author on several occasions stresses the potential for plausible denier.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
That makes you prick up your ears somewhat.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
Right at that time, an institution was found at which today looms large given our situation.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
I am referring to what today is called the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
You probably have come across that name within the context of the corona crisis.

42:08.000 --> 42:19.000
This institution has played a major role since vital data pertaining to corona are being compiled, displayed and analyzed on a global dashboard, which was developed in January 2020.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
These data are disseminated by...

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
Actually, it was developed much earlier than that by a guy named John Cullen, right?

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
He used to work for some company that made that dashboard and so when he saw the dashboard and it was all read, he was like, wait a minute.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Media all over the world.

42:36.000 --> 42:48.000
The center was founded in 1998 under another name, Center for Civilian Bio Defense Strategies, so we can see that name obviously still has a somewhat military ring to it.

42:49.000 --> 42:56.000
Later, in terms of public image, the emphasis would be on health. The focus, though, has always been the same.

42:59.000 --> 43:07.000
This center has organized a few very important and essential simulation exercises in the field of disaster response strategies.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
I would like to go into this subject more in detail. It started in 1999.

43:13.000 --> 43:21.000
The center came into being with the help of the Sloan Foundation, which was established by then-president of General Motors, Alfred Sloan.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
The Sloan Foundation is a very large sponsor of the PBS NewsHour.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Who has died long since?

43:29.000 --> 43:35.000
The Sloan Foundation managers have put many, many millions into these bioterror exercises.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
So in 1999, just one year after establishing the center, a first conference was organized.

43:42.000 --> 43:54.000
Many hundreds of participants from 10 countries met in Arlington, home to the Pentagon, were the capital directly across the Potomac, for a national symposium on medical and public health response to bioterrorism.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
At this conference, problems arising in the wake of a bioterror attack were assessed and discussed.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
It was a big event that February, 1999.

44:04.000 --> 44:15.000
Here we have the organizing agency, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefence Strategies, in collaboration with the Department of Health and various other scientific organizations.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
In the context of this conference, a simulation exercise took place for the first time.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
It was the real-life replication of a smallpox terrorist attack in the U.S., where the resulting smallpox epidemic and a massive number of victims.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
How could the situation be effectively addressed?

44:38.000 --> 44:49.000
Just picture experts from various fields, sitting at a conference desk in a role play, acting as officials in different functions, talking to each other just as these people would communicate in such a crisis.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
See them conduct a mock telephone conference coordinating strategic responses.

44:55.000 --> 45:02.000
That kind of conference was acted out by who says what and who should decide what, where do conflicts and problems arise.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
In the final report on the exercise, we find the following quotes.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
How far can police go to detain current-time patients?

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
A consensus must be reached as how to proceed with the vaccinations.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Should martial law have been implemented?

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
How to control the message going to the public?

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
These kinds of questions were discussed there in 1999, questions that remind us obviously a lot of our present time.

45:33.000 --> 45:43.000
One of the speakers there was Richard Clark, a high-level counter-terrorism advisor to the U.S. government, who emphasized the fact that, for the first time, the Department of Health,

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
is part of the national security apparatus of the United States.

45:47.000 --> 45:54.000
Indeed, at that time, a new path was treated and that these public health issues were rendered military problems.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
In itself, same year, 1999, the Pentagon continued its bio-weapons research.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
What's the date there?

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
For example, Project Backos, a covert program in the desert of Nevada.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
The goal was to find out whether it was possible for terrorists.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
What's the date there?

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
New York Times, 4th of September, 2001.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Do you see?

46:21.000 --> 46:38.000
I mean, it's really impressive. Mark has really stitched this up so well with regard to letting us see how maybe September 11th wasn't quite what we thought it was.

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
I don't know, but I'm interested to see what this guy, Paul Schreier, is going to frame September 11th as.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Program in the desert of Nevada.

46:48.000 --> 46:57.000
The goal was to find out whether it was possible for terrorists to construct a small anthrax production facility by just using off-the-shelf equipment.

46:57.000 --> 47:04.000
After a few months, the Pentagon specialists did actually succeed in reaching their goal and managed to produce a few pounds of anthrax.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
It was only several years later that this Pentagon project was disclosed.

47:09.000 --> 47:23.000
When we now assume evil purposes, the Pentagon here will develop the capability to perform a bioterror attack while claiming that it must have been the work of some terrorists since all necessary ingredients were readily available in the stores.

47:23.000 --> 47:33.000
So let us note that this extremely dangerous skill was developed at that time right there on this military base in Nevada, where in former years nuclear weapons were tested.

47:33.000 --> 47:40.000
Now in the 1990s, the base was used for bioweapons research, far from any settlement.

47:40.000 --> 47:47.000
The pandemic simulation exercises went on.

47:47.000 --> 47:56.000
Already by the next year, the second National Symposium on the response to bioterrorism took place at the same conference venue organized by the same institution.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
The only difference was that this time the focal problem was not smallpox, but the plague.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
This year is the original website of the event of the year 2000.

48:06.000 --> 48:14.000
By the way, all the documents I have used are generally accessible on the Internet, so all quotations are verifiable since they are publicly available.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
If you would like to investigate or subject yourself, you can find the documents quite easily.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It's not whistle-blower material.

48:21.000 --> 48:31.000
So you can see here Margaret Hamburg, Thomas Inglesby, somebody we know still, Michael Ulsterholm, of course we know very well.

48:31.000 --> 48:40.000
Tara O'Toole, we know her from, I think she's at the University of Pittsburgh, even if I recall correctly, or at least used to be.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
That's quite a list, all the same show.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
It's pretty impressive.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Hey, Eustonics in the chat, nice to see you buddy.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Plague.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
This year is the original website of the event of the year 2000.

48:54.000 --> 49:02.000
By the way, all the documents I have used are generally accessible on the Internet, so all quotations are verifiable since they are publicly available.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
If you would like to investigate or subject yourself, you can find the documents quite easily. It's not whistle-blower material.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
Now I would like to quote a few sentences from the documents for this conference in the year 2000.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.000
Decide of an armed military presence in U.S. cities has provoked protests about curtailment of civil liberties.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
The question is, how do we enforce it and to what degree?

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
How much force do we use to keep people in their homes?

49:31.000 --> 49:38.000
So these are the things that have been discussed and debated in these exercises by high-level officials 20 years ago.

49:39.000 --> 49:48.000
Many of you might remember that at this time there were important presidential elections.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
President Bush Jr. came into office in January 2001.

49:52.000 --> 49:58.000
Here in this picture you see him with Vice President Dick Cheney, who was of high influence in that administration.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Shortly after the inauguration, the third big bioterrorism exercise took place.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
It was called Dark Winter, and again it was a smallpox scenario.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
Here this colorful page is the center's original website of 2001.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Yes, it is the original one.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
Websites then were quite a bit more colorful and somewhat messy compared to today.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I did find it in an Internet archive.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Its sponsors are explicitly mentioned.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
See here this long foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
This time the simulation exercise was professionalized.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
The previous ones took place in conference rooms in hotels.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
They were quite simple.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
But in 2001 the venue of this event was a military base, Andrew's Air Force Base.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
It's a large military base just a few miles from Washington D.C.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
So the exercise was upgraded and was even given a name.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
Dark Winter sounds like the title of a Hollywood movie.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
It reminds of a marketing campaign for the whole topic.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
The public relations aspect is visible.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
It was definitely meant to be made known to the public.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Quite a number of articles were published about Dark Winter.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
So let's take a look at who has taken part in this exercise.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Who were the key participants?

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
I could find a list of attendance among the original documents for this major infectious disease simulation exercise.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Margaret Hamburg.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Honorable David Gergen.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Sam Nunn.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Frank Weisner.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
William Sessions.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
James Woosley, let's see.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
If you are familiar with American politics at that time, many of these names will be known to you.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
They were senior executives and reasonably high positions of power.

51:56.000 --> 52:04.000
Here, for example, the role of the CIA director was played by James Woolsey, who, a few years ago, had actually held that position.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I let mention him before.

52:05.000 --> 52:13.000
Here, Frank Keating, a governor of Oklahoma, who, at the time of that infectious disease simulation, actually was serving as governor of Oklahoma.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
He held that position also while the mentioned Oklahoma City bombing occurred.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Similarly, the other positions were occupied by high-ranking officials.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
You can truly say a full-scale national emergency was practiced.

52:27.000 --> 52:34.000
We are not dealing here with the middle management of authorities, but top-level operatives, who discussed strategies for such a scenario.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
When you look at the documents for this simulation event, you can't but notice the role of the press.

52:39.000 --> 52:49.000
The media were a vital part of this exercise, and those who participated and played their part were not in any way minor journalists, but nationally known journalists.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
Therefore, example, we have the well-known Judith Miller of the New York Times, an expert on national security affairs.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
And here are a few representatives of major TV networks, NBC, CBS, and BBC.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
This is a photograph from the exercise. We can see a mock press conference.

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
The politicians are announcing a state of emergency because of a bioterrorism attack on the U.S., this time the biological warfare agent is Smallpox.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
A press conference is being conducted. The reporters ask questions and the politicians respond and note how the press reacts.

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
They develop skills to respond in an appropriate way, so they train the questions and responses thoroughly on a high level and learn their strategic lessons.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Isn't that what exercises are for?

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
It became obvious then that the U.S. were ill-prepared for a bioweapons attack.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
The quantity of vaccine stockpiles was not sufficient.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
Forcible constraints on citizens would likely be the only tools available when vaccine stocks were depleted.

53:47.000 --> 53:53.000
So the conclusion was that civil liberties have to be restricted. That was in 2001.

53:53.000 --> 54:07.000
Here we come across Robert Cadillac again, the official who has written the above mentioned Pentagon's strategy paper suggesting that biological warfare agents would work well because they could be used under the cover of a natural epidemic and therefore plausible denial would be easy.

54:08.000 --> 54:14.000
This Robert Cadillac participated at Exercise Dark Winter as an expert on bioterrorism.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Here in this picture we see him appearing on a fictional news channel.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
You should know that such simulation exercises provide as many details of reality as possible.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
So on huge screens the participants watched fictional news reports that were produced beforehand.

54:27.000 --> 54:38.000
So bioterrorism expert Robert Cadillac appears on screen saying that there was a problem of insufficient stocks of vaccine and he adds that this means that a dark winter could be ahead in America.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
A very dark winter. And as you know this is the name of the exercise.

54:42.000 --> 54:54.000
When we now take a look at what became of that man we see in the year 2020, the year of the corona crisis Robert Cadillac resurfaces as one of the most important advisors to the government under Trump.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
In this photo you see him at the lectern next to Vice President Mike Pence.

54:58.000 --> 55:10.000
But now let's have a look at Joe Biden who just a few days after major US news outlets had declared him the winner of the presidential election said that the US was facing a dark winter.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
He used exactly the same words. Coincidence?

55:13.000 --> 55:23.000
I can't prove the connection to the exercise. You might call it Coincidence although you could also suspect that his choice of words was related to the exercise.

55:23.000 --> 55:37.000
Anyway, let's go back to 2001 now. We can read in the final script of the dark winter exercise that Americans can no longer take basic civil liberties such as freedom of assembly or travel for granted.

55:37.000 --> 55:52.000
So that was the third simulation exercise on the subject within a brief period of time. That was in June 2001 and just a few months later the September 11 attacks happened and the topic of terrorism is again pushed to a higher level.

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
9-11 was the day the terrorist threat was literally being brought home to everybody in the global community.

55:59.000 --> 56:07.000
For years the topic of terrorist threat has been engaging and informing the entire political debate.

56:07.000 --> 56:14.000
A little later over the course of several weeks the so-called 2001 anthrax attacks happened.

56:14.000 --> 56:27.000
Letters containing a fine white powder laced with spores of the bacterium bacillus anthracis were sent to several news media offices and to those two senators, Patrick Lee and Tom Daschle.

56:27.000 --> 56:34.000
Daschle served as US Senate Majority Leader and Lee shared the Senate Judiciary Committee.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
Both were critical of the legal changes proposed after the 9-11 attacks.

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
See the controversial Patriot Act which led to constitutional infringements on civil liberties by expanding the government's surveillance powers.

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
Like for example the NSA's warrantless wiretapping at home and abroad and using broad data mining systems.

56:53.000 --> 56:59.000
They felt it was necessary to discuss and carefully weigh each case of legal change.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
So in this situation these two senators received anthrax letters.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
To this day it is not clear who was responsible for those attacks.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
First bin Laden and al-Qaeda were the supposed culprits, then Iraq's Saddam Hussein was blamed.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
There's a...

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Nothing came of it.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
Finally a mentally fragile scientist of a US bio-defense laboratory was in the focus.

57:24.000 --> 57:36.000
So I hope you remember that you need to go to his satanic lives sub-stack and read about all the reasons why one Robert Malone might actually have a pretty good idea of who did it also stay.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Who did it also Steven Hatfield might have a pretty good idea of who did it.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
Maybe Sina Bovari has some idea who did it.

57:44.000 --> 58:00.000
It probably wasn't this mentally fragile US scientist who maybe stole a notebook from some girl that Robert Malone used to know ten years earlier and then decided to kill himself.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
This allegation proved to be wrong too.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Many different stories are circulating.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
To date doubts exist about the FBI's conclusions.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
But to come back to the two menaced senators.

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
We can imagine that if you send a letter containing highly dangerous Patogans to a politician,

58:17.000 --> 58:23.000
it is clear that the person addressed is not endangered since he or she of course has employees to open the mail,

58:23.000 --> 58:30.000
which means that whoever had planned the attack did not intend to kill the politician in question but only to intimidate.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
There are other ways to kill inconvenient individuals.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
They say it was just a signal that a certain red line should not be crossed.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
These two senators were merely meant to be intimidated.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
I do not know how they assessed the threat but it is a fact that right after having received those letters,

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
they stopped opposing the disputed legal changes and the laws were passed.

58:53.000 --> 59:02.000
Something interesting occurred in November 2001 immediately after the Antrex scare.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
On the initiative of the American government, a new international organization was founded

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
called Global Health Security Initiative because it was deemed necessary.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
The reasoning for founding this organization was the Antrex scare,

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
which was a major topic all over the world at that time.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
It was emphasized that every government was in immediate danger.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein might ship this deadly Patogane in letters to each and every country.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
We now need to unite and jointly take action.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
So this organization was founded in November 2001.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
The participating countries are symbolized by flex.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
Here is Canada, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Great Britain, USA

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
and finally the WHO as technical advisor.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
This group of countries more or less are the G8,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
the most influential industrial nations of the West, complemented by Mexico.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
From then on, senior officials and health ministers of those countries regularly came together

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
or sent high-level representatives and discussed the topic of bioterrorism

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
in order to coordinate with each other.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
In 2002, the matter was taken one crucial step further.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The group declared that emergency planning for bioterrorism is quite similar

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
to that foreign influenza pandemic.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
So from 2002 on, both scenarios were exercised and prepared for.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It must not necessarily be the danger of a bioterror attack,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
but it could just be a dangerous influenza virus spreading in a natural way.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It was concluded that such a case would be just as perilous and needed to be prepared for.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
From pandemic preparedness on an international level means being able to globally coordinate

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the implementation of measures for such a scenario.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
A strategic planning group for an influenza pandemic was led by Great Britain and the U.S.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
From then on, this series of exercises were not only taking place in the USA

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
but were coordinated internationally.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Wow!

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Twenty years they prepared!

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The first one was called Global Mercury and convened in 2003.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
This is a chart from the Robert Koch Institute taken from the post-exercise report.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The players are the European Union as an entity and then France, Germany, Italy, Japan,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Mexico, Great Britain, the USA, the WHO and Canada.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
See here at the top the exercise planning group, the director and the higher control staff

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
who planned and designed the exercise.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
This time Germany participated too, represented by the Robert Koch Institute.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It was an elaborate exercise stretching over several days.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Either you participate and get on board or when this happens you'll be left behind.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Get on board and participate or when this actually goes down you'll be left behind.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I think a lot of countries may have been offered a very similar heads you in, tails you lose kind of thing or whatever.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Many hundreds of people participated.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
In those years there was a whole series of such exercises.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
An important one, convened in the year 2005, was called Atlantic Storm.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Here at the speaker's desk, former Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who played the US President.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
In the post-exercise report we can read the following key questions.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
How should national leaders determine measures such as border closure or current time?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
If actions are taken to restrict the movement of people for how long would restrictions have to be maintained,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
how would they be coordinated internationally and how would the decision be made to lift them?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This is exactly the same kind of questions that are being discussed worldwide right now in 2020

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and which have already been debated intensely on a very high level during that exercise.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I'd like to show you now two of the players who were politicians.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Werner Huier of the German FDP, a classical liberal political party, and Bernard Cushney of France,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
then Secretary of Health. Later he became Minister of Foreign Affairs, so he was part of the French government.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
At the time of the exercise he was a candidate for the position of Director-General of the WHO,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
thus he was an important senior official in this field at the time.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
He acted a part of the French President.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Next to him, Werner Huier, a former German Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
He played the role of the Chancellor of Germany.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So, the representatives of these countries were all individuals who have had former governmental responsibility

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
or were currently in key positions.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
After the exercise Werner Huier remarked,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
for someone who has been around in a security and defense field for many years,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
this was quite a surprising and breathtaking exercise.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
This is something I think a very small minority of politicians in Europe are aware of.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I have presented you quite a few of these simulation exercises,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and by now you probably recognize common patterns.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So, let me at this point draw a brief interim conclusion.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
The basic premise of every one of these scenarios was a public health emergency

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
with ensuing questions about the decision-making process and competences.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
But they also involved declaring a state of emergency,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
implementing authoritarian leadership, bypassing parliament

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and investing certain federal officials with augmented decision-making power,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
while also suspending fundamental civil rights and effectuating plans to vaccinate the population.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
What strikes me as particularly noteworthy is the ready suspension of basic human rights

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
when responding to a pandemic or a bioterror attack,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
because that is not necessarily a logical consequence.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Observing all of this, the question arises that maybe such exercises might have served

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
as a cover and testing ground for a state of emergency and checking out

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
how such a political situation could be handled.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
At least this is my personal thing.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I really like his interpretation, so I'm just going to go back a few sentences

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and let him say it again.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So, let me draw a point, brief interim conclusions.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Let me at this point draw a brief interim conclusion.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
The basic premise of every one of these scenarios was a public health emergency

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
with ensuing questions about the decision-making process and competences.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But they also involved declaring a state of emergency, implementing authoritarian leadership,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
bypassing parliament and investing certain federal officials with augmented decision-making power,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
while also suspending fundamental civil rights and effectuating plans to vaccinate the population.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
What strikes me as particularly noteworthy is the ready suspension of basic human rights

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
when responding to a pandemic or a bioterror attack,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
because that is not necessarily a logical consequence.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Observing all of this, the question arises that maybe such exercises might have served

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
as a cover and testing ground for a state of emergency and checking out

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
how such a political situation could be handled.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
At least this is my personal impression.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Well, then, soon, the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 happened,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and the topic of pandemic exercises was pushed a little to the background on the international stage.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Then, in the spring of 2009, when its impact had a devastating effect on world economy,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
another pandemic came around the corner to put it casually.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So, when the H1N1 flew, also called Swine Flu, emerged and nobody quite knew

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
what could come of it, this gentleman here said something very interesting.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
He is probably not known to everybody, but in France he is prominent.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
His name is Jacques Ataly, who many decades has had the function of special advice

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and French politics, counseling several presidents, most of all Francois Mitteror,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
for whom he had also worked as so-called Sharpa, preparing G8 summits.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So, Ataly has moved in the circles of French power elites for a very long time

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and has exerted substantial influence as an avant-garde thought leader.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He has helped Emmanuel Macron rise to power and says of himself that he has discovered him.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
This is a relatively credible claim because of Ataly being a visionary networker

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and his extensive connections.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So, as I said, he wrote something most interesting when the 2009 H1N flu came about.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
History teaches us that humanity advances in great strides if it is frightened.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The pandemic now setting in might trigger one of these fears that cause structural changes.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Then we will be able to lay the foundation for a world government,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
something to accomplish much faster than it would have been possible by economic reasons alone.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I don't want to commend it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Those are simply Ataly's own words from the 2009 H1N1 flu.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Actually, what I find striking is the fact that such ideas are usually associated with conspiracy theories,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
but this is a true quote.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
It is the utterance of a man of great influence globally.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
A year later in 2010, a study was published in the USA that goes along the same lines.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It is the so-called lockstep scenario.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Let me briefly introduce it to you.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The title of the study is Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It sounds a little boring and bureaucratic, quite unspectacular at first glance.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You wouldn't expect that the study contained newsworthy information.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It was financed with money from the Rockefeller Foundation. See the logo here.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That foundation is one of the oldest, wealthiest and most powerful private foundations in the world.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
The name is derived from the founder David Rockefeller, who 100 years ago was in fact the wealthiest man alive.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Even today, the Rockefeller Foundation is influential in many fields.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The study of 2010 was apparently taken scenario planning to an entire new level.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000
A set of four different global future scenarios were envisioned in order to explore how societies might develop over the next 15 to 20 years.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So in each of the four narratives, the imagined societies are shaped by certain driving forces,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
playing out over time like, for example, the impact of new technologies and natural catastrophes like deadly diseases.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The project designers were required to think outside the box and envision plausible futures.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
One of these possible scenarios was called lockstep, which describes the following.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
A deadly flu pandemic is spreading globally and leads to panic.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
China, with its restrictive approach, has seen as the paragon of effective crisis management and is widely emulated.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Mask-wearing becomes mandatory everywhere.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Authoritarian control of citizens is imposed and remains in place even after the pandemic is over.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Citizens willingly give up their sovereignty and liberties.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It is only after around 10 years of top-down rule that people start rabbling.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:22.000
After around 10 years of top-down rule that people start rabbling.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
They expect us to wait seven more years until we start rabbling.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That's pretty creepy, actually, right?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Wow, that's creepy.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It is very odd to read this now in 2020, recognizing in that depiction our present reality.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You come to realize that the study's underlying objective is to seat a new strategic conversation among the key public, private and philanthropic stakeholders,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
so as to achieve impact more effectively for a preferred future.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
China is by a very powerful foundation, I guess, that quite a few key players have read the study,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
even though I'm not able to say how it was received and who read it.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
For further inquiry, just look for it on the Internet.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
From 2017 on, the topic of emergency response and pandemic simulation exercises gained traction

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
when a new U.S. president moved into the White House, Donald Trump.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I suggest a casual relation between the change of government and invigorating the international simulation exercises.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Here a picture of outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama in conversation with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office in November 2016.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
You all remember the days after the election, it was truly a shock affecting the media all over the world.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Trump is the new U.S. president.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
How could that happen?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Nobody had deemed it possible that an outsider like Trump, someone who had been expressing himself in such a bold and blunt manner,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
not caring about how his words would be received by the media, actually won the election.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The news of that man becoming president sent shockwaves around the globe.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You are surely familiar with the world economic forums, annual meeting, every January in Davos,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and the Munich Security Conference every February.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
In 2017 at those events the attendees spoke about little else but the new president of the USA.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
What would Trump as president mean for the world trade, the financial system, and for international diplomacy?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Can we keep going like we did in the past?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
So in February 2017 in his opening remarks in Munich, John McCain said,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I refuse to accept the demise of our world order.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000
He was a hardliner and hawk with great influence in the U.S. and in international diplomatic circles,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and his address was met with a lot of applause on that conference where high-ranking representatives of military,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
politics and business mainly from NATO member countries get together every year.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000
When you look at the documents and articles from that year, you come to realize that the transatlantic relations were severely challenged at the time.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
The members of these elite circles worried big time about the future of the Western military alliance

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
and wondered if it might fall apart because of Trump.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So in that context McCain remarked, I refuse to accept the demise of our world order,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
followed by louder plows of his peers from Western world countries.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The next day at the same conference Bill Gates appears and gives a talk as well,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
warning that we ignore the link between health security and international security at our own peril,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and adds that it is only a question of time that a dangerous Patogaine would spread,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
be it by a quirk of nature or by the hand of a terrorist.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
We need to be prepared with a new arsenal of weapons.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The world needs to prepare for epidemics the way the military prepares for war.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Right afterwards the pandemic exercises started anew.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
In May 2017 for the first time in history the health ministers of the G20 met in Berlin.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
They were sent by the 20 wealthiest and most powerful industrial nations of the world.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
China, India and Brazil participated as well.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:36.000
For the first time those health ministers came together as a team in order to organize their response to the threat of a future pandemic.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So we see here, sitting side by side, all the health secretaries or health ministers.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Here in the front row of the German Health Minister, Harmann Gruy, the predecessor of Jenschban,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
next to him his colleague from China, the US, Brazil, Canada, Australia.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
The other day they are watching a pandemic scenario,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
on the screen.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The name of the new dangerous virus was not Zars, but Mars, mountain-associated respiratory syndrome.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Mountain-associated virus came from a mountain area.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That's racist.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Just see them all in unison intently watching the story unfold.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:39.000
When we look at that picture, we might comprehend a bit better why in today's crisis all or at least most of the countries are proceeding very co-ordinately and why in every country more or less the same is acted out.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
All these officials in power received the same input a while before the corona crisis.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000
They were given the same general recipes and procedural instructions that are now being realized in a synchronized way.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
At least this is how it seems to be.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Back to our timeline.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It is now August 2017 and the German Health Minister Gruy is presenting an international advisory board for the German Health Policy.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Well, actually that group will not just be counseling Germany alone because Germany was assigned for leading the way to global health policy.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
These ladies and gents are to advise the government.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
This one here in the back in Germany, we all know him.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
First-hand Rosten, he is a member of that advisory board.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
To his left, we see Ilona Kickbush, a professor who has done a lot of research about pandemic threats.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
She has been working in high-level positions for the WHO for many years.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000
There is Jörk Hakka, the former director of the Robert Koch Institute, here the WHO Regional Director for Africa.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
In my view, however, these two gentlemen at the sides are most important for they play in a different league altogether.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Here to the left is Jeremy Farrah of the Wellcome Trust.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
That is a British foundation with a remarkable $25 billion endowment.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
It is an extremely influential charitable foundation in the field of health governance.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It is even more powerful in terms of funding than the Rockefeller Foundation or the George Soros Open Society foundations.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
So the Wellcome Trust has more funds and has built a huge network for global health governance.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
To the right is Christopher Elias of the Gates Foundation.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
This is in fact an even more important foundation in this field.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
With roughly 50 billions, that foundation is even better connected.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The Gates Foundation plays a leading role in global health governance.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
One can surely say without exaggeration.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So from 2017, these two weighty gentlemen have been counseling the German government

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and have set at a table with Christian Drosten and the German Health Minister.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It could possibly help to notice.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Let's move on to the year 2018.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Again, there is a major bioterrorism simulation exercise in the USA, this time however, without international scope.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
You see very high level officials and politicians representing the US National Security Council in Washington.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
They are all people in high functions who act as if they were members of the National Security Council

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and are now coping with that emergency situation.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It is interesting from different angles.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
There on the screen in the middle a pre-produced TV program is playing.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Those two women talking to each other are well-known TV hosts in the United States.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
If that event had taken place in Germany, we would see, for example, Sandra Meiszberger and Muybrüt Ina

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
conversing with each other about the bioterrorism attack that had just occurred.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Those who had planned the exercise had applied a lot of effort to make it as realistic as possible,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
so that the trainees would experience the situation as real.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000
The plot of the exercise was as follows.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000
A fictional elitist cult had financed the creation of a nasty virus in the BioLab in Zurich.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
It was eventually let loose so that a global pandemic has arisen.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000
The aim of that cult had been to reduce the global population, indeed a demonic ambition.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So that was the scenario of this exercise which was called Clayd X.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
It was once more organized by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Here are all the Quaintons to the right.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I have mentioned him before as one of the addresses of the Antrex letters,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
who in the meantime has been employed as a lobbyist for the healthcare industry,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
he is now participating in this exercise.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Two is left biosecurity expert Tara O'Toole, who has written a number of scripts for such simulation exercises,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
among them the dark winter scenario.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
This goes on an important role in government.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's a nice presentation.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's one of the key figures in the field of disaster response strategies.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Now we are fast approaching the present time.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
But before I tell you about the latest simulation exercise event 201 in October 2019,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000
allow me at this point to pose the question of why the corona pandemic did happen in January 2020.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
You could of course say that happened because the virus just came up then.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Sticking with the official explanation, it originated in Wuhan, China

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
and spread from one person to the next, from one country to the other, naturally.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
If you however assumed that the corona pandemic did not occur so faithfully,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
but was masterminded by some circles, it might not be uninteresting to get straight what has happened in September 2019.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Many people, me included, didn't fully realize that in mid-September 2019, stock markets were in panic.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It was a liquidity crisis called the cash crunch of September 2019 or repo crisis 2019.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
At that time I had not noticed the unusual liquidity problem of US banks.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
As I said at the beginning of today's talk, this money markets crisis is not mentioned in my book.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I had only become aware of that extraordinary moment when working on this talk.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Now I would like to show you a news report from German weekly site online of 2nd October 2019,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
titled Blackout in the Financial System.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000
The Fed tries to prevent a breakdown of the cash market by injecting billions of dollars into the financial system.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
How alarming is the situation?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Here a few excerpts.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The crisis came overnight.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Banks were running short of cash.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The Fed was intervening with massive amounts of dollars to prevent the burst.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
This sounds like the climax of the global financial crisis 11 years ago,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
but in fact it only describes the Monday of the week before last,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
an important part of the global financial system was on the verge of collapse,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
and the general public noticed practically nothing.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So what had happened?

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
In the night of September 17, 2019, a certain interest rate unexpectedly spiked on an overnight loan market.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It was to rate for short-term credits that are normally borrowed by banks at an interest rate of about 2%.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
But suddenly lenders were demanding 10%.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000
The last time the Fed had to intervene was after the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000
The fall of that large bank prompted a crisis in that part of the financial system that almost led to the collapse of world economy.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
That development helped my attention.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I have looked at the monetary policy principles and practice of the US Federal Reserve System,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
the US Central Bank, and checked the data on its website.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
There you can find this graph.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Now for everyone who isn't at home at the subject of numbers and finance,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
don't be scared now.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It's not rocket science.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
It's not as complicated as it looks at first glance.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I will try to explain what the chart is showing.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It's the balance sheet of the Fed depicting its total assets.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It shows how much money the Fed is pumping into American economy by buying treasury and corporate bonds to offset the fact that banks have stopped lending money to each other.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:45.000
In short, the Fed actively participates in the economy by creating money and injecting it into the domestic banking system in order to compensate for the fact that the interbank lending market has dried up because banks have lost confidence and hold on to their reserves.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
So it is basically the fever chart of US economy.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Here to the left, that's 2008, before the global financial crisis, when the Fed owned assets of almost a trillion dollars, that's 1,000 billions.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
This amount doubled within a few weeks in the fall of 2008.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Why? The Fed's total assets doubled because the confidence was gone.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
The banks had stopped lending money to one another.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So the Federal Reserve had to fill in, otherwise the system would have blown up.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
That's what happened in 2008.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It's striking though that the Fed's bonds purchases were not cut back, but continued in 2010 and 11.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The amount was even increased in 2012, 13 and 14, further rises then from 2015 to the end of 2017.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
The intervention plateaued at the high level of 4 trillion, which was roughly 4 times the amount compared to before the crisis of 2008.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000
When you look at that from today's perspective, you read and think of what they get you to argue about with regard to student loans.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Where businesses, you know, somewhere between 100,000 and 700,000 can go, I mean, I don't know what the number is.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The businesses can go bankrupt for the tune of millions of dollars every year.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Nobody's got any problem with that, but not, you know, the idea that student loans, they can't be bankrupt.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You can't dispense of them with bankruptcy and you can't get out of them and the interest runs forever.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And there's no real control on that.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And then they make us fight about whether those loans are important enough when businesses are allowed to declare bankruptcy all the time.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And the Fed is allowed to take on the weight of the bad choices of the banking system to the tune of multi trillions of dollars.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Multi trillions of dollars.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It's extraordinary to me how the bait and switch works on every level.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
We're never really talking about what's important if we're talking about what the TV wants us to talk about.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Realize that the bubble was gigantic and it becomes clear that this practice couldn't be kept up.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You either had to deflate it or it would eventually burst.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Actually, that was tried by the Federal Reserve at the end of 2017 when it was decided to slowly but deliberately deflate that bubble in a steady manner.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Sell assets and thus effectively take money out of the system.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
For two years, that went pretty well between the end of 2017.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I mean, it's no different, right?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The student loans are no different than somebody going into the hospital with no insurance and having somebody at the door say,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
you can have the best treatment. All you got to do is sign here.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Because with most of these kids, they go off to school. That's how I got it.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I wanted to go to a school. They said, I sign here and I can go to the school and you'll figure out the student loan debt later.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Well, if you went into a hospital and they said you'll get the best care, if you just sign here, we'll pay for it and you can figure it out afterward.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And then you came out with a huge bill that you never really could understand.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And the hospital's not on the blocks for charging you the right amount.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
The university's not on the block for charging you the right amount.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And so a lot of these liberal arts universities can charge $20,000 a year because they know Pell grants and guaranteed student loans are going to be given away at infant item to any kid that applies for them.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And so they hire a whole financial aid department that helps these kids navigate the application process and make sure is that all of them get the financial aid that they deserve so that they can cover the bill of whatever that university decides to charge them this year.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And so it's kind of a racket to put the college kid completely on the block for having gone to that university, paid the cost of the university, had the university graduate them and nobody's looking at the university for what product they provide, whether they charge what they should have.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:17.000
When I get that it's an open market, I get that people should be choosing the right university or going to a state university or whatever.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And that if you choose out of state tuition, that's your own problem, I get all those things.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:37.000
But my point is, is that very similar to my analogy of if you walked into a hospital and they told you could have the best treatment if you just sign here, student loans aren't the same as getting alone for a car.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Or getting a loan mortgage for a house, nobody evaluates anybody's potential to pay the loan back.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
You just have to sign at the dotted line and now you have four years of college.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And that's a pretty weird thing to then say, by the way, you could never get out of this.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Never. Never ever ever get out of this. It's on you forever. And if they want to charge you 9% interest and compound it when you can't pay it, well, that's tough shit.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So it's interesting to apply that to student loans, but not to apply it to business loans, mortgage loans, any other loans that anybody has, credit card loans.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Because again, that's fine. Bankruptcy is fine, but not when it comes to student loans.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And so I'm just saying, this is crazy. It's extremely nuts.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And student loans is a very small drop in the bucket for what goes on in the background with corporate business going out of business, corporate business cheating, corporate business tax fraud.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And this federal government bank collusion that we have to admit that we don't even understand.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:27.000
But obviously the confidence on the repo market was reduced to nothing in mid September 2019, which means that the Fed had to completely alter its course, reversing the policy it had been pursuing for two years.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So it was again buying government securities, thereby providing liquidity for the markets. What a turn.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And now you see the significant rise here. It has nothing to do with Corona that is January 2020. But this year in March 2020, this is the sharp increase in the shadow of Corona.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:53.000
But see, October, November, December 2019, the graph indicates ever increasing cash injections that have nothing to do with Corona.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
After March 2020, it's the same upward movement, just much more pronounced.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And now I would like to show your report from January 16, 2020, a few weeks before Corona became the major media topic.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It is a report by Norbert Herring, a German economics journalist, writing about the Fed's massive bond purchases.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:28.000
The Fed explained its interventions with the less than convincing reason of temporary miscalculations, saying it was out of the question that the banks didn't trust each other.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
The alleged miscalculations apparently seem to be rather persistent.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Four months later, the Fed's emergency landing is still perpetuated in unrestrained amounts, an end is not in sight.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The names of the company's receiving loans are kept secret so that their reputation won't suffer.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:52.000
It might be that the financial market boom, fueled by central banks, is in its final phase before collapsing.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I would like to put that into a wider chronological context.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I found the chart depicting the historical view of the Fed balance sheet over a period of not only 10 years, but 100 years.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
That's how long it already exists.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Here we can basically see to what extent the Fed was actively participated in US economy relative to GDP.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
We see that it peaks in 2008 during the global financial crisis.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The value was comparable to the Great Depression in 1930, rising continually until 1940, only to decrease slowly after World War II.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
The level of the Fed's interventions is similarly high during the crisis of 2008 and again in September 2019.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000
We are experiencing the same large-scale dimensions of financial intervention.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:53.000
In October 2019, the next simulation exercise took place at that hotel, an exceptionally luxurious venue for such an exercise on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Central Park is right across, and when you walk a few blocks south on Fifth Avenue, you come to the Trump Tower.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
So this part of Manhattan is the most expensive.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:09.000
The hotel Pierre was opened in 1930 during the Great Depression, financed by some big Wall Street bankers.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:17.000
That roof anti-architecture are reminiscent of the royal chapel of Versailles, the Baroque grandeur of Louis Catos.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The Wall Street bankers whose money made it possible obviously like to live in that kind of pomp and splendor, they saw themselves on that level.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
The hotel still exists, and right there in New York, the exercise called Event 201 was hosted.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Sure enough, it was a corona virus pandemic that was being responded to.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I'd like to present you briefly who is sitting there at the conference table.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
This is the host from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security next to him, Christopher Elias of the Gates Foundation.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I have brought him to your attention before, since he is a member of the Advisory Board on Global Health for the German Government.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
To his right, the Director of American Center for Disease Control.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.000
There is the Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, who was also part of that group of global senior leaders.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000
There the Vice President Global Public Health at Johnson & Johnson by market value, the largest farmer corporation in the world.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Here the former Deputy Director of the CIA, and there in the front, the Global Chief Operating Officer at Edelmann, the world's largest public relations and communications firm.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
As I've mentioned, this time a corona virus pandemic was simulated with an eye towards public relations.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:54.000
It says here, governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:01.000
This will require developing the ability to fluid media with fast, accurate and consistent information.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:13.000
For their part, media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritized and that false messages are suppressed, including through the use of technology.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
That is basically just what is happening at this very moment.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Here another picture of the conference.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
This is Anita Atcizero, the Deputy Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
She was assigned to co-organize the event.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:42.000
She's a lawyer who, before joining the center, had worked as a farmer lobbyist in the management of a Washington, D.C law firm responsible for about 300 employees,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:51.000
advocating on the behalf of the farmer industry with members of Congress, likewise constructively engaging with members of the European Commission.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Finally, she became Deputy Director of that Center for Health Security.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
These infographics there are found very interesting.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:10.000
The significant data of the fictive crisis of event 201 are being presented in charts, maps and tables, showing the mounting numbers of cases,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and there on the map you see what countries are impacted and to what degree.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
There we are informed about the performance of financial markets.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Here we have the projection of how the death rate will develop within the next month.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000
This is exactly the same kind of infographics that we are now getting from the Johns Hopkins University.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
It is the info we are being fed by all mainstream media outlets.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
It's just that same graphic visualization of numbers and cases that is our reality now.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And the present censorship by social media giants like YouTube and Google has been expressly advised on that event 201 just a few months before today's corona crisis.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
What had been planned then is now reality.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:04.000
As opposed, all that information taken together provides a crucial backdrop for you to form your own opinion about what is happening at the moment.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Thank you for your attention.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So that's pretty nice.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I really like that one.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It's a very, very nice video.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I'm going to put a link to it here in the in the chat so you can mark it for yourself.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I think it's a real nice one to share and you can also share this stream, of course, of us watching it together.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I want to just make sure that we have it clear.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
The concept of what's going on, the illusion of consensus.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And how we're using this example of left track as an illusion of consensus.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That was a close one.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I almost been home with that guy.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You doing okay?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Do we need to go?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
No, I'm fine.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I admit all these people did take me by surprise at first, but I've learned that I can accept change.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Since when?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I managed it when Amy switched her shampoo from pral to pral for oily hair.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Although I do miss the way her head used to slide off the pillow.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And now if we remove that consensus, look at how bad it becomes.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I'm over here Sheldon.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
That was a close one.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I almost been home with that guy.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
You doing okay?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Do we need to go?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
No, I'm fine.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I admit all these people did take me by surprise at first, but I've learned that I can accept change.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Since when?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I managed it when Amy switched her shampoo from pral to pral for oily hair.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Although I do miss the way her head used to slide off the pillow.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:18.000
And that's really what they do with this when they have five ladies on the view talk about coronavirus for three years

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and come to conclusions together.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.000
It creates this illusion of consensus that these three ladies who are much smarter than me

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
and they're on TV seem to agree that it's a natural virus and these people are telling a story about lab leak

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
and they all took the virus or they all took the shot.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
She has COVID.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Yes, it's back.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
It's back.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
But she's on the men.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
She's on the tail end and she's probably back this week.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
But sorry, she's not here for those of you who are looking forward to seeing her.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And so if you change the channel and you find this illusion of consensus, if you change and scroll on Facebook

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and you find this illusion of consensus, if you look on Twitter and you see this illusion of consensus

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:13.000
that we've got to figure out whether it's a natural leak or a lab virus and then that consensus slowly starts to change

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
to the fact that, wow, they seem to have really lied about this.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It seems like they were covering stuff up and it looks like they gave money.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:28.000
And this guy and that guy and no, and there's barrack and there's fauci and there's eco-health alliance.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
This is all wrapped up.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And none of the current players that are really talking every night, the ones that are on,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:47.000
are able to be on YouTube, the ones that are able to be on every podcast that they ever want to be on all the time,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
every channel are not talking about the PCR fraud at all anymore.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I don't know if I've ever heard Robert Malone talk about that.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I don't know if I've ever heard Steve Kirsch really talk about it anymore.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000
They're not talking about the crime of the masking and lockdown anymore.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
That's already forgotten.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000
The spreading, the pathogen that spread is never really spread.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And now we have data from Jessica Hockett and from lots of other people, actually, like Denny Rancour,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
that all show the same thing.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
There's death certificate fraud.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000
The journalists have uncovered in New York City and in other places around the United States.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
There's protocol fraud that includes do not resuscitate orders to EMTs in New York and elsewhere,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000
because you don't want to resuscitate people and catch the virus yourself.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And then all of those heart attacks that weren't resuscitated were called COVID deaths.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000
There's the protocol ventilation fraud, the protocol treatment fraud with remdesivir,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:04.000
and then there's this early treatment fraud, which is the idea that something was held back.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And that's why people died as opposed to treating them poorly or not treating them at all

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
or not giving them antibiotics because antibiotics doesn't work for a virus.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And in reality, anybody that's talking about this, as Mr. Sparkle, aka Mike Eden talks about it,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:34.000
you got to talk about it all every time in order for people to understand how it has to all be lies.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It can't possibly be a lab leaked virus that killed millions of people and all of these lies.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's ridiculous.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You don't need anything if you have all of these lies except for a spectacular commitment to maintaining these lies.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And so I believe this is where we are, the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Virus said to be detectable by a specific PCR test, but it was not specific.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I think most likely scenario is that they released, as was described in that video,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:22.000
they just they released a clone, which would blend into a background of an existing coronavirus background.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And so they put the clone in places, maybe made people sick with it,

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:34.000
but certainly made people detectively positive for a sequence that would be very similar around the world,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000
and thus be plausible biological evidence for the rapid spread of a single agent.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
But of course, with that background, as Robert Cadillac said, with that background, a few seed cases

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and then testing that doesn't really cover the specific would give you the thing that Giordano said.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And that would enable a larger portion of all cause mortality to be prioritized as a national security threat

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
because the test makes it that instead of the other.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
And the US was ready with a plan as was described in this video.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000
We had been rehearsing with other countries for decades.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And so an NIAID funded DNA RNA infectious clone, so using DNA to generate the RNA and then spraying it around,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
or just DNA and spraying it around so that you can sequence for it.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:41.000
This clone of a coronavirus may have been used to seed the molecular idea, maybe even cases.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Maybe the first SARS virus in 2002 was what a clone does when you release it in China on an apartment building.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It gets 10,000 people trackably sick and it kills 700 people.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And so maybe they did that in five places and then they sequenced it in five places and they found that virus.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
That's what I'm suggesting.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000
After that, there doesn't need to be spread because there was a background signal that these tests cannot differentiate from

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
and that these sequencing reactions can pick up.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And since we have no sequencing data from before 2020 that's worth a darn, we don't know if that background signal didn't always exist.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And it's a much more parsimonious explanation for the molecular signal we're seeing now

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:41.000
than the point spread of an RNA species from Wuhan, China around the planet.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And the reason why they're telling us this story that our fabulous commitment to lives is because they are fabulously

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:58.000
committed to converting our children from basic human rights to basic granted permissions.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.000
They don't want our kids to feel the sovereignty that we feel over our children.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And I'm going to zip through this because you know already that's what they did.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000
So the way that they convinced us of this again is a laboratory or a bad cave zoonosis.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And I think it was a conflated background signal.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.000
If you compare these two, in this scenario, the Earth is clean over here in 2018.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And then a lab leak or a natural virus is released in Wuhan and it spreads around the world and it changes.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And that's why the virus changes color.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And what I think is a much more parsimonious explanation for what they've done is that in the background there is a signal.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:54.000
And they probably used a clone to seed the appearance of a homogenous novel signal on this background.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000
And since nobody's really aware of the depth and the breadth of this background because no one was looking at it before,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:09.000
once they rolled out mass testing and mass sequencing, it looks like, wow, look at all this stuff, we're finding it everywhere.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:23.000
But in reality, if they'd have looked this hard and this often all the time with this much gusto and this many terrible products and this much, let's say, impetus to find things

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:31.000
then they would have found this background signal a long time ago, but it just wouldn't have been conflated into a pandemic.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:39.000
And so it doesn't matter whether it's a leak or lease or lies, it doesn't matter because in this scenario, it is the protocols that killed everybody.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It's the change in behavior that killed everybody. It's the bad information that killed everybody.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
It's the notion that there's a novel virus around that you don't understand that killed everybody.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:49:12.000
And they put all these young doctors on their heels and sent all the old doctors home and separated families and spouses and children from their parents as they died from what was probably an untreated secondary pneumonia brought on by a respiratory disease.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And so the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine, you can turn this around and try to explain it.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But I've said a million times if you call 911 and say there's a man in my house, you shouldn't really have to tell 911 what he's doing there or what his motivations are.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They should probably send the police right away and then the police figure that out.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And when you realize that there wasn't a pandemic because the biology doesn't permit it, which means everybody is lying to you, then this becomes a crime scene and we're not really obligated to explain what happened.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
It's time to back the truck up and figure it out.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
All we know for sure is the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So you could say it was a transfection agent release and infectious clone release.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
It doesn't matter because the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:19.000
So whatever it was, I think the best explanation to cover the most is a conflated background signal, meaning there was an agent.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:27.000
They likely seated the molecular signature on a background from which the PCR could not differentiate.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And overuse of the PCR and people who are not sick, but with a huge background from which it couldn't differentiate, this huge signal came up.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:51.000
And the media and social media and governments were all primed to talk only about spread, talk only about numbers that started from zero and went to infinity.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And not to adequately describe this in context of all cause mortality and instead describe it in some cartoon manner that has nothing to do with the biological reality.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Protocols were murder, transfection is not medicine.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:18.000
And that's why the scenario of there are no viruses is definitely a trap because there is transfection.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.000
We can make gene sequences. We have made transfections working animals before.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
We have aerosolized these things before.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Bioweapons programs are real.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I think it's very, very good argument that these guys make that there aren't these obligate pathogens that replicated our bodies and fly around the world.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:50.000
But there are exosomes and there are lots of signals at this size scale that involve genetic material that we do not understand.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Some of them go between our tissues. Some of them are signaling for our immune system and others of them may signal between conspecifics and we may not understand them.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000
And there is likely this signaling process in animals as well.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
It's even possible that this signaling process is, let's say, semi-self enduring.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So you might send a signal that is self-replicating for a little while to communicate with a conspecifics immune system to augment it.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Maybe this is why little kids make old people sick.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.000
It's an interaction between immune systems. It's not a pathogen dirty being spread from another person who's clean.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And I think what we need to do is not suddenly rush to another solution like there is no viruses or it's germ theory or it's terrain theory, but rush to stop rushing.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:53:01.000
But just sit back and relax and realize that the simple cartoon that we've been given that's supposed to make us understand how this and other diseases have been cured by vaccines is insufficient to describe our lack of knowledge.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:12.000
About how our immune system interacts with our environment and is augmentable by human intervention.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000
So this isn't sufficient. Protocols or murder and transfection is not medicine.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.000
So this is where we are. This is really, really, really where I think we should stay.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And I think Mike Eden and I are going to try and come up with a way of collaborating on this so that we can get some kind of message that we can be sending out more regularly and making clips of, etc.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:45.000
So I think people have worked together, wittingly and unwittingly, to change our minds to see this worst case scenario in the beginning.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And that really put us on our heels. And it's taken us three years to realize that this mindset change allowed us to change so much behavior and a full and entire society into essentially shooting ourselves in the foot.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And, or injecting ourselves in our shoulder as it were. And this was the plan. And it's been the plan all along.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And once we realize that it's a plan, we're going to have to, we're going to have to put the brakes on and take control of our car again.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Because the goal is bio surveillance. And it's not for us.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:33.000
We're too old. And we're too sovereign over ourselves and our children. So the idea is to get our children's children. This is a long game.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
10 years, 20 year game.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And their idea is to talk all this smack about AI and stuff when they really realize the only hope they have of cracking anything of this complexity is to start sampling the diversity that's here before it's gone forever.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:04.000
You can communicate with me at gigaohm.bio and also gigaohmbiological.com. I'm also at JJ Cooey on Twitter.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And yeah, we're just going to keep on going because transfection is not immunization. Intra muscular injection is not a valid means of augmenting your immune system.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I hope you enjoyed the show. I really liked that German's presentation. It was pretty much spot on. And I thought it was appropriate because we had two videos now with Mike Eden talking about the simulations that occurred and, you know, reminding everybody that's a pretty big piece of evidence.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And this hour long presentation really laid it out and smoothed it over as much bread as it can cover. And it's a lot of sandwiches. I got to say, um, yeah. Thanks for joining me.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And we will see one another again tomorrow as far as I can tell you. Stop all transfections and humans full stop because they are trying to eliminate the control group. This is gigaohmbiological and high resistance low noise information stream brought to you by a biologist.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
That's me, Jay Cooey. See you tomorrow.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Thanks, guys. I'll see you tomorrow night, maybe tomorrow afternoon, probably tomorrow night.
