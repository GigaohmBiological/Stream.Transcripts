Okay, so I'm just testing this really quick to see if I think what happened was I did such a long one that the last video didn't show up on my list right away, but now I see it there and it's transcoding so it could be that it just goes into limbo for a little while, but

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
I just wanted to check again so this is another transmission just very quickly to get us

00:54.000 --> 01:06.000
get us another video online so I apologize for this if you're jumping back onto Twitch, I apologize for that I didn't mean to get you too excited, but I am testing this because I do think it's working well

01:07.000 --> 01:23.000
on the on the peer tube it just looks like that it takes a little while for it to show up in my list so I am really trying very hard to get that to work because I want people to be able to go there and do this

01:24.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay, so that's working so I'm just going to stop it now and see if this live stream shows up as I expected it to with the right amount of time I think that we're very close to this working for an hour and having no glitches which is, you know, it's pretty

01:38.000 --> 01:51.000
amazing I mean we're going to have our own version of YouTube where there's no algorithms and everybody's private and we can just enjoy ourselves in peace it's going to be a little it's going to be a little garden of our own which I'm really excited about

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
so thanks very much again for joining me I'll probably see you again after basketball
