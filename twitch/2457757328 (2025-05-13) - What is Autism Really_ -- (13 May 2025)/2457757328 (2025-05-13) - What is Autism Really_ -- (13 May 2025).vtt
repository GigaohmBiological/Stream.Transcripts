WEBVTT

00:11.929 --> 00:13.110
I don't care how you get there.

00:13.130 --> 00:15.791
I don't care what you do to get there.

00:15.811 --> 00:18.452
The goal is to win.

00:28.066 --> 00:30.670
And what's up, this is Tajay of the Mighty Souls of Mischief crew.

00:30.690 --> 00:34.535
I'm chilling with my man Festo, my man A-Plus, and my man Boat, you know, he's dope.

00:34.836 --> 00:37.119
And right now, you know, we're just maxing in the studio.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.846
We're hailing from East Oakland, California, and sometimes it gets a little hectic out there.

05:11.688 --> 05:12.128
The End

05:31.785 --> 05:32.867
Good morning, everybody.

05:32.927 --> 05:33.928
Welcome to the show.

05:33.988 --> 05:39.394
This is Gigome Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.817
That biologist is Jonathan Couey.

05:42.457 --> 05:45.921
I am coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from the back of my garage.

05:45.961 --> 05:49.365
I'm good friends with Jay Bhattacharya and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

05:50.146 --> 05:58.550
Had a great relationship with Mr. Kennedy while we wrote this Wuhan cover-up book and later got hired by Children's Health Defense.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.851
Didn't do so well with that organization.

06:00.911 --> 06:03.853
Ended up butting heads with a lot of people, including Mary Holland.

06:04.633 --> 06:12.357
You can find the work that I did before the pandemic on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, using my last name, my first two initials.

06:12.918 --> 06:15.339
You could maybe find a video or two of mine

06:15.959 --> 06:19.660
some of the six hours that I did for the organization known as Panda.

06:20.060 --> 06:34.024
However, Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and the rest of their crew apparently lost those videos, but instead have decided to recycle those ideas on Twitter and on this sub stack with an American by the name of Jessica Hockett.

06:34.044 --> 06:43.787
So Woodhouse76 has a great face to find my ideas diluted in the form of arguments with Claire Craig or Pierre Cory or Mike Eden or even

06:44.287 --> 06:46.790
Jay Bhattacharya, it's really remarkable.

06:47.451 --> 06:59.544
But anyway, irrespective of all the past history, let me just suffice it to say that I'm coming to you live because I think it's very important that we keep our eyes on the ball, and that is when RNA cannot pandemic,

06:59.984 --> 07:03.327
and they tell us stories about how it can, we have a problem.

07:03.467 --> 07:09.073
If intramuscular injection is not medicine, we've got a pretty big problem on our hands.

07:09.133 --> 07:15.118
And if this was always transformation and transfection, then I mean we have some very big problems on our hand.

07:15.158 --> 07:21.083
Now imagine the possibility that that big problem was a population pyramid.

07:21.724 --> 07:29.949
You know, sort of inverted and they needed to manage that problem and they wanted to take advantage of it to create a mythology that they could enslave our kids with.

07:30.409 --> 07:36.913
That's what I think is happening right now with regard to a lot of these stories, including

07:38.013 --> 07:39.494
autism spectrum disorder.

07:39.934 --> 07:58.766
So I wanted to address that today by looking at a video with one Peter McCullough, where he explains his current take as a cardiologist and respiratory disease expert and coronavirus disease expert, expert in alternate treatments.

07:59.266 --> 08:01.648
And I'm really excited about this video.

08:02.088 --> 08:03.309
Thank you very much for joining me.

08:03.429 --> 08:04.389
Let's get on with it.

08:06.092 --> 08:08.034
Hi everyone, it's always good to be with you.

08:08.474 --> 08:13.419
We're about to have a conversation with an eminent guest.

08:14.960 --> 08:27.211
But before I get into that, I just want to say one more time that whether we're separated by geography or distance of one sort or another, I feel a huge sense of connectedness.

08:28.872 --> 08:34.495
I'm sorry to stop it already, but number one, this music is seriously gay.

08:35.376 --> 08:41.399
And two, this whole idea of I seriously feel some sort of connectedness with you.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.963
I'm very sorry to report, but I've got about 110 subscribers.

08:47.523 --> 08:54.407
And I've got a lot of people that just donate because they're inspired by a particular show or by a particular comment I make.

08:54.927 --> 09:03.271
And thank you to all of those people who I don't have a list of here handy and have never read and that's probably very ungrateful of me.

09:04.012 --> 09:05.412
But we're barely making it here.

09:06.433 --> 09:10.015
And I don't feel any connection with any of those people.

09:10.195 --> 09:14.117
I do feel often like I'm just talking to a camera in my garage.

09:14.877 --> 09:19.619
I do often feel like I'm just talking to another camera in my garage.

09:19.679 --> 09:21.800
I feel very alone in this.

09:21.961 --> 09:22.201
I don't...

09:22.961 --> 09:39.189
feel any connection, even though I have some really amazing supporters that give an incredible amount of money that make it possible despite, according to Sasha Latupova's observations, me not having enough followers to make a living.

09:40.309 --> 09:49.254
Somehow or another, this family of five is able to scrape by for five years now through the generosity of just my few viewers.

09:50.336 --> 09:51.437
That's how this works.

09:52.017 --> 10:04.683
And yet I still feel tragically alone, like almost, almost, you know, dangerously alone, except for the fact that I have the love of my wife and my best friend.

10:05.164 --> 10:13.288
And I have my kids around who, I don't know what I would do without my family because I don't have anything else.

10:13.348 --> 10:16.109
And I want to feel connection to my viewers.

10:16.169 --> 10:19.151
I want to feel connection to the people that I made, but I don't.

10:20.475 --> 10:26.282
The numbers don't, and the numbers would not make me feel better, but the numbers would be something of a readout.

10:26.322 --> 10:28.345
Like, oh, wow, I guess it's reaching more people.

10:28.385 --> 10:29.867
I'm not wasting my time.

10:30.928 --> 10:39.058
And so for me, this whole pitch at the beginning about how I feel a connection with you guys and the piano music playing in the background.

10:40.484 --> 10:54.461
It feels, from my perspective, extremely disingenuous because my wife and I don't feel any connection to anyone except for the very few people who send a card, the very few people who have called or came to visit last year.

10:56.229 --> 10:58.950
This is not, I don't know what he's talking about.

10:58.990 --> 11:04.951
Maybe it feels really good when you have millions of people and hundreds of thousands of people giving you money.

11:05.011 --> 11:06.191
Maybe then it feels great.

11:07.031 --> 11:08.232
I don't know what he's talking about.

11:08.572 --> 11:12.253
To all of you, and I just want to hear myself saying that out loud.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.093
I love knowing that I can get feedback from you.

11:15.153 --> 11:21.995
I love knowing that other people are gonna put in their own interpretations, ask more questions, and let me know that you're thinking.

11:23.390 --> 11:30.512
To the matter in hand, my guest today is an eminent American cardiologist, Dr. Peter McCullough.

11:31.393 --> 11:42.896
For people who've been following my content and who've been paying attention to a lot of what's going on, he'll be a familiar voice and face, very outspoken about everything to do with the so-called pandemic.

11:44.077 --> 11:50.259
Before we get into that conversation, and it is a fascinating conversation, let me remind you about how to support this channel.

11:51.038 --> 11:53.679
Basically, it's via patreon.com.

11:53.740 --> 11:59.383
Go there, look for me, part with a little bit of cash, about the price of a cup of coffee every month, and you become part of the family.

12:00.343 --> 12:10.769
You'll see all my new content ahead of time, and you get exclusive access to question and answer session, the occasional competition, all sorts of things that make it worthwhile.

12:10.789 --> 12:13.971
But it'll be made better and enriched by you being there.

12:14.631 --> 12:21.494
And just to let you know, the upcoming interview was filmed against a green screen, so after the titles, my office background will disappear.

12:23.055 --> 12:25.616
You'll be confronted with a coastal scene.

12:26.217 --> 12:30.539
We chose the background because, as you know, years ago I was involved in a series called Coast.

12:31.559 --> 12:33.440
We filmed at lots of coastal locations.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.742
Let me know if you spot which one this actually happens to be.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.984
Anyway, let's get down to it and let's hear from Dr. Peter McCullough.

12:46.744 --> 12:52.668
My guest today is Dr. Peter McCullough, whose face and voice will be very familiar to many.

12:53.509 --> 12:55.230
He's got his scarf on now.

12:55.270 --> 13:02.055
He was one of the most forthright voices questioning the official responses we all endured as the COVID story unfolded.

13:03.597 --> 13:07.860
He paid the price and continues to pay the price for his outspoken honesty.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.602
But thank you for joining me today, Doctor.

13:11.614 --> 13:12.794
So great to join the show.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.675
I think we're kindred, you know, I'm Scots-Irish.

13:17.576 --> 13:18.556
Excellent, that can only help.

13:18.576 --> 13:24.118
Yes, you probably can tell by my name, although we've lost the brogue over time.

13:25.158 --> 13:28.399
Well, we're still brothers under the skin.

13:28.699 --> 13:29.019
Excellent.

13:30.499 --> 13:35.641
There are so many areas, health-related matters that we could talk about even more broadly, but I think what

13:37.489 --> 13:43.892
I want to hear from you about today is the content of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

13:43.852 --> 13:53.796
's recent press conference detailing the soaring rates of autism detected amongst the American young.

13:56.217 --> 13:58.097
What's your reaction to the numbers?

13:58.137 --> 14:00.278
It's something like one in 30, I believe.

14:01.439 --> 14:04.020
These are stunning statistics and they're all

14:04.899 --> 14:09.523
disclosed in an April 17, 2025, CDC report.

14:09.543 --> 14:18.550
It has over 60 authors on it, chronicling a meteoric rise in the rate of autism spectrum disorder.

14:18.590 --> 14:24.615
So the CDC uses 16 sites across the United States where they gather information on autism.

14:24.675 --> 14:26.737
It's under our Research Institutional Review Board.

14:27.317 --> 14:29.018
They have lots of internal checks.

14:29.098 --> 14:30.739
It's not just codified data.

14:30.779 --> 14:34.240
They understand who's been referred for learning disabilities.

14:34.881 --> 14:36.081
This is the real deal.

14:36.181 --> 14:39.703
It's not an artifact of increased screening or detection.

14:39.723 --> 14:41.764
Since 2020 to 2022, they've noted another biannual

14:47.330 --> 14:49.353
jump in the rates of autism.

14:49.393 --> 14:53.197
We now are down to 3.2% of American children.

14:53.277 --> 14:54.759
This is a very solid estimate.

14:56.721 --> 15:05.332
The ranges can be less than 1% in Laredo, Texas to as high as 5.3% in California.

15:05.352 --> 15:06.433
So there's a tremendous range.

15:08.433 --> 15:20.721
And within that, when people hear the word autism, let's say, it's a spectrum disorder, so it can be of greater or lesser severity.

15:21.582 --> 15:27.566
Within this soaring proportion of youngsters being diagnosed with autism, how severe

15:28.627 --> 15:37.190
Because I've heard tell of, in some cases, we're talking about people who will never be able to function, never have what we would regard as normal adult lives.

15:38.190 --> 15:45.452
How many of that one in 30, or whatever the proportion is, are at the very, very damaged end of the spectrum?

15:46.212 --> 15:47.893
Right, so the number is about one in 31.

15:48.413 --> 15:52.434
And by the way, it's the same in Europe and the UK.

15:52.594 --> 15:53.275
It's the same.

15:53.335 --> 15:54.515
In fact, I just reviewed

15:55.245 --> 15:57.430
a paper through the pandemic from the UK.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.895
It'll be coming out of my Focal Points sub stack.

16:01.018 --> 16:03.403
The rate they had in the UK was over 9%.

16:04.741 --> 16:06.162
for autism spectrum disorder.

16:06.222 --> 16:07.422
So it's up there as well.

16:08.943 --> 16:16.665
The CDC report discloses over 60% of those children needed special needs education.

16:17.066 --> 16:22.468
So that's a proxy that they were not at the same learning level as normal peers.

16:23.308 --> 16:33.852
In the published literature, it's about a quarter of those with autism are severe to the point where there's repetitive behaviors, headbanging, uncontrollable shouting,

16:34.938 --> 16:40.424
you know, kind of guttural utterances, auditory processing.

16:40.464 --> 16:46.010
So you'll see the small children wearing the noise-canceling headphones if you go out in public spaces.

16:46.111 --> 16:48.213
It's almost certainly a child with severe autism.

16:48.653 --> 16:50.075
Trouble with toileting.

16:50.255 --> 16:54.340
Some actually, you know, never really learn how to use a toilet the rest of your life.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.381
So it's about 25% of that number.

16:57.114 --> 17:02.320
And you know, when I was a child, the rate was one in 10,000, and now it's one in 31.

17:03.121 --> 17:12.571
What's really disturbing to me is the medical orthodoxy, the mainstream medical establishment and the mainstream media seem unconcerned.

17:13.212 --> 17:15.334
The CDC seems unconcerned.

17:15.474 --> 17:17.156
In their April 17th report, 2025,

17:18.337 --> 17:27.940
When we got to the conclusions, they didn't say this is alarming, we need research, we need to stem the tide of this, find out what's the risk factors for this.

17:28.581 --> 17:33.382
Instead, they just concluded, oh well, we'll need more special needs education and resources.

17:35.363 --> 17:38.824
Okay, so let's investigate this a little bit first.

17:40.545 --> 17:41.625
Let me see here.

17:46.496 --> 17:55.120
So the CDC report, he says, quoted as one in 30 have autism spectrum disorder.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.461
Sorry, my pen wasn't open.

17:56.481 --> 17:57.322
And so it wasn't writing.

17:58.902 --> 18:07.507
And in 2020 to 2022, he also says there was another jump in the rate of autism in America.

18:07.947 --> 18:10.809
But there are tremendous ranges between different states.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.802
They both agree that it is a spectrum of disorders.

18:16.522 --> 18:22.404
Neither of them mentions the recently coined term by CHD, profound autism.

18:22.444 --> 18:38.451
You can see a number of videos on CHD's website that just recently published as they've tried to coin a new phrase that, well, you know, the guys that are banging their heads and are not toilet trained and are having diarrhea like 12 times a day, those are people with profound autism.

18:39.031 --> 18:39.972
That's a subset.

18:40.492 --> 18:56.022
And so here, we're actually saying that about a quarter of all people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, and you can see that the diagnosis varies quite greatly because in the UK, it's as many as 9% of the kids have autism.

18:56.202 --> 19:05.769
No wonder that's why there are so many kids with YouTube channels from the UK that say they're autistic, and even young adults that have YouTube channels that say that they're autistic.

19:06.934 --> 19:25.346
And it's scary because the question becomes what is autism if it's such a profound spectrum from people that, you know, like Polly Tommy's daughter can advocate for these people to have more awareness of them and we should make more room for them at the grocery store so that they can have jobs too.

19:27.047 --> 19:29.749
All the way to some parents who apparently like

19:31.354 --> 19:45.363
somebody like Brian Hooker is dealing with an adult child with what is essentially the behavioral repertoire of a toddler, but the strength of a man and who is still not toilet trained completely.

19:45.423 --> 19:48.225
Like that's a pretty profound difference.

19:48.425 --> 19:50.427
That's a pretty profound spectrum.

19:50.447 --> 19:56.210
That's just kind of like, you know, I don't think this is genuine.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.192
I think what this is, is a given script

19:59.498 --> 20:09.450
It is a well-studied narrative that all of these people are very good at saying, but haven't really thought about the consequences of their imprecision.

20:11.032 --> 20:15.837
It is the very similar thing to what was done with AIDS 30 years ago.

20:16.037 --> 20:18.640
If you'd done any research and reading about it, you would know that

20:19.619 --> 20:28.846
Basically, with an antibody test, any medical condition could, in theory, be a result of AIDS, including uterine cancer.

20:31.997 --> 20:36.140
And so this is a profound problem is what it is.

20:36.240 --> 20:54.433
This whole issue of all the language here that CHD is playing with a profound autism and he's talking about severe autism and actually saying that a quarter of all autism is this severe autism with repetitive behavior and sensory sensitivity.

20:56.072 --> 21:00.233
And again, remember that the CDC is unconcerned.

21:00.953 --> 21:06.094
It's the CDC's own report, but they only need more special needs education.

21:06.454 --> 21:08.895
The CDC, the CDC, the CDC.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.295
That's where we are right now.

21:11.315 --> 21:23.638
Now, I would just like to start off and make sure that we understand that the CHD, the Children's Health Defense, Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker and Polly Tommy,

21:24.670 --> 21:42.208
who I am actively accusing of being a sabotage organization that has never scored a touchdown on purpose, is now sort of sculpting a new, more specific narrative or a more specific set of semantics.

21:43.399 --> 21:51.172
around autism, which will allow them to say, well, you know, we knew there was a whole spectrum, but we were, the worst cases are profound autism.

21:51.212 --> 21:52.654
Well, what do you call SIDS then?

21:52.714 --> 21:54.598
Isn't SIDS even worse than autism?

21:56.058 --> 22:00.580
since Polly cured her autism, since Jenny McCarthy cured her kids autism.

22:00.620 --> 22:17.285
I mean, autism is not a death sentence, but SIDS is, and yet somehow or another, CHD has never bothered to speak out loud the idea that, you know, SIDS is probably just acute injury from intramuscular injection.

22:17.345 --> 22:21.226
Like, I don't understand how it's not more obvious.

22:22.287 --> 22:22.567
And so,

22:24.110 --> 22:30.713
Here we are trying to figure out what autism is, and we're trying to bring and understand what's happening here.

22:30.733 --> 22:39.738
We're trying to bring the average conservative populist voter in America to understand that autism is a very complex thing.

22:39.758 --> 22:51.384
You've never thought about it before, but let Peter McCullough, who already got you out of the pandemic with his outspoken stuff, why don't you let him advise you as to what autism is, bring you up to speed?

22:55.390 --> 23:02.851
What is the likely cause of the soaring rate of autism and other behavioral problems?

23:02.891 --> 23:03.232
What is it?

23:03.252 --> 23:08.092
You know, I recently gave a keynote speech on this at a major meeting.

23:09.093 --> 23:15.234
I'm an internist and a cardiologist, so I am seeing autistic young adults in my practice in increasing number.

23:16.274 --> 23:17.994
And I'm an epidemiologist.

23:18.054 --> 23:21.515
I study the distribution and determinants of disease.

23:22.376 --> 23:28.140
And I can tell you autism is not caused by a single exclusive factor.

23:28.440 --> 23:28.861
It's not.

23:29.661 --> 23:32.944
There are inputs and there are multiple studies to support this.

23:33.004 --> 23:36.026
So for instance, there are common genetic

23:37.116 --> 23:39.939
variants, no genetic mutations.

23:39.979 --> 23:44.823
There's no autism gene, but there are some genetic predispositions, but they're common in populations.

23:45.583 --> 23:52.209
Older adults, so men over 40, women over 35 conceiving children, that's a risk factor.

23:52.229 --> 23:53.270
It's a minor risk factor.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.512
Premature delivery of babies, that's a pretty big one.

23:56.853 --> 24:00.596
If a child is born before 37 weeks in a meta-analysis,

24:01.511 --> 24:05.552
about 20 percent become autistic when they grow up.

24:05.972 --> 24:12.615
They're not born with autism, but they, in a sense, convert to autism somewhere between the ages of two and eight.

24:13.715 --> 24:20.517
I think the biggest risk factor though, the biggest, most modifiable risk factor is combination vaccination.

24:21.477 --> 24:25.939
It was first described by Leo Kanner, a child psychiatrist in 1943,

24:27.452 --> 24:35.495
where one out of the 11 children he initially described with autism, they converted, they were normal, and they converted to autism after the smallpox vaccine.

24:37.627 --> 24:52.721
Obviously, I'm well aware of the fact that here we had Andrew Wakefield many years ago now who drew a link between the MMR vaccination programme that my children all went through and increased incidence of autism.

24:54.943 --> 24:57.885
It terrifies me now when I think about it, but myself, my wife and I,

24:59.086 --> 25:04.750
We didn't hesitate to get our children the MMR vaccine, and we listened to Dr. Wakefield.

25:04.850 --> 25:11.814
And just to make sure that you're following along, whoa, that was the wrong one, this one, that one.

25:12.595 --> 25:20.600
So he also listed old parents, he listed premature babies, but then they convert to autism from year two to eight.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.542
He said that all very fast, just make sure you heard it.

25:24.062 --> 25:41.471
He also said the biggest cause, the most dangerous one he thought was combination vaccines, which actually goes back to Brian Hooker's original audio that we got from 2013, where he said that his son received like five vaccines on one day when he had an ear infection.

25:42.132 --> 25:44.493
And so he got a super big dose of thimerosal.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.472
and that would be the mercury.

25:47.552 --> 25:56.880
So here it's interesting how these narratives over the course of these last 20 years are slowly starting to sort of weave together into one.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.583
But this one, he's now saying converted, like three times he says converted.

26:02.184 --> 26:13.013
So it seems to imply something that bothers me a lot, which is it seems to imply a relatively fast shift from non-autism to autism.

26:13.911 --> 26:41.258
which in my humble opinion has been something of a concern in the narrative because both Paul Offit and Mary Holland, longtime opponents on different sides of this argument, have been unable to articulate that the objection that Mary Holland has with regard to vaccines are stories about kids that are injured really acutely after injection.

26:41.758 --> 26:51.801
And so an easy way to do this would be a placebo trial where you randomly gave either a placebo or a vaccine and 30 days apart, you gave them the other one.

26:51.821 --> 26:55.822
And then we would have this solved because, you know, the placebo wouldn't cause anything.

26:56.022 --> 26:59.763
And the injections, if they did anything, would do something.

26:59.803 --> 27:03.304
And we'd have this answered and nobody would have to skip their vaccines.

27:03.724 --> 27:09.606
And there'd be no moral, you know, objection to letting some kids be vulnerable to measles and some kids not.

27:09.646 --> 27:10.366
It's just a month.

27:11.638 --> 27:14.379
And Mary Holland couldn't come up with the idea that, you know what?

27:14.939 --> 27:18.541
A lot of the kids that die after vaccines just kind of die.

27:18.721 --> 27:31.166
And so if we wanted to prove that some kids die and some kids, you know, they die from the vaccines, then we could do a placebo trial that was only like 30 days or 60 days long and all the kids would get their vaccines.

27:31.226 --> 27:35.828
It's just that some of them would get a placebo before the vaccine, some would get a placebo and then the vaccine.

27:36.248 --> 27:37.509
And then we would be able to see

27:38.865 --> 27:48.250
you know, between let's say two years and two months and two years and four months, whether any of these kids in any group, you know, have this SIDS thing.

27:51.332 --> 27:52.092
But they couldn't do it.

27:53.873 --> 28:06.580
And instead, we've already gotten right down to the original recycled story about MMR in the UK years and years ago with Paula Aitken,

28:07.463 --> 28:09.324
and the original paper in Lancet.

28:11.125 --> 28:17.528
We have one of the moms who has believed for over two decades that this guy is fake.

28:18.588 --> 28:33.736
And he moved to America and became rich with another woman by the name of Polly Tommy, who was on billboards in the UK at the same time, in her bra, swaying six million votes for prime minister.

28:35.854 --> 28:46.614
And then she moved to America with Andrew Wakefield after being in UK magazines saying that she cured her son with Andrew Wakefield and secretin injections.

28:48.483 --> 29:11.074
She went so far as to allow herself to be quoted in newspapers as saying that we with just to make sure it worked We withheld his treatment and he reverted So when we gave him the treatment he recovered again they actually told that story to a newspaper and yet she's still in America claiming she has an autistic child and

29:19.091 --> 29:25.414
being roundly ridiculed and disparaged across the piece by the medical orthodoxy.

29:25.474 --> 29:32.698
And now we look back at that time, at that story, and we just thank our lucky stars.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.260
My wife and I are the same.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.581
Our children received all the vaccines.

29:38.661 --> 29:40.963
I personally received all the vaccines.

29:41.823 --> 29:42.343
I traveled.

29:42.403 --> 29:42.924
I took more

29:43.800 --> 29:44.341
vaccine.

29:44.361 --> 29:46.402
So a few principles about vaccines.

29:47.323 --> 29:51.546
They are far safer when they're given individually as opposed to combinations.

29:51.586 --> 29:52.567
It makes sense because.

29:52.767 --> 29:56.150
OK, so there he repeated it again, and it's not a terrible argument.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.852
I would be willing to bet that Brandy Vaughn made that argument.

29:58.932 --> 30:02.635
I mean, you have to test medicines in combination, right?

30:02.675 --> 30:07.779
You would never just willy nilly suggest that people do take four medicines.

30:07.819 --> 30:12.503
But again, this is intramuscular injection, so it is obviously worse.

30:15.440 --> 30:27.264
But I do think it gets around the point, again, remember the analogy that I think works most aptly here is to think of intramuscular injection as a baseball bat to the head.

30:28.106 --> 30:38.173
And what he's arguing is is that, you know, when kids really get hurt is when they go to the doctor's office and they get hit in the head with the bat multiple times, you know, on both sides of their head.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.834
Then they come home with a real headache.

30:40.275 --> 30:44.758
Those are the those are the kind of, you know, doctor's visits we should try to avoid.

30:45.158 --> 30:51.883
And that's how ridiculous it should sound to you if you really understand the biology that they're trying to obfuscate here.

30:52.964 --> 30:57.887
As when you combine multiple different products in a single shot, you can evoke more

30:58.399 --> 31:01.841
inflammatory side effects, they're far safer.

31:01.982 --> 31:16.672
One of the things that we can say Reginald Perrin in the chat is asking, and I'll put it up here, babies have tiny muscles, maybe it's to do with I am injecting babies before placebos, before they're grown or whatever.

31:20.114 --> 31:26.877
What probably has more to do with is the fact that the blood-brain barrier isn't fully developed in a newborn baby.

31:26.937 --> 31:33.020
And so, a lot of these toxins, when they go into circulation, are free to go wherever they want to go.

31:33.080 --> 31:44.565
And that's, in a four or five-year-old kid, that's a much, much more, let's say, fortified, well-developed barrier, as is their liver and all this other stuff.

31:44.585 --> 31:47.046
So, it's an extraordinary combination of dumb.

31:49.665 --> 31:53.368
to be injecting newborn children or even in their first year or two.

31:53.468 --> 31:55.630
It's just extraordinarily dumb.

31:56.590 --> 31:59.733
And that's why I use that phrase, because it is.

31:59.773 --> 32:06.918
It makes no biological sense from a developmental perspective, all of the ways that an infant is vulnerable on purpose.

32:06.999 --> 32:12.203
The reason why, you know, it's just remarkable how silly it is.

32:13.544 --> 32:17.166
You could think, you should think of newborn babies

32:18.149 --> 32:27.871
a little bit more like you think of a baby marsupial or a baby mouse, if you've ever seen a baby mouse or a baby rabbit.

32:29.132 --> 32:30.292
They're completely naked.

32:31.772 --> 32:32.953
They're completely helpless.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.993
Their eyes are still basically closed.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.914
And when they open, it's too bright for them.

32:38.114 --> 32:40.894
And they more or less are seeking the warmth of their mom.

32:41.795 --> 32:42.835
And that's it.

32:44.215 --> 32:47.016
And in reality, a newborn

32:47.688 --> 33:09.076
Human is not that much more than a baby rabbit and the development of a human from the Physical perspective and a lot of ways is on a much longer trajectory through time Because that rabbit is supposed to be sexually mature in about nine months not in in like, you know 14 or 16 years and

33:14.164 --> 33:21.866
And so there's definitely all kinds of truth to Paul Thomas's argument that, well, we can give vaccines, we should just give them later.

33:21.926 --> 33:31.969
Yes, if you hit your child in the head with a baseball bat at six months versus two years, one could be potentially catastrophic.

33:32.029 --> 33:33.750
The other one, maybe it's okay.

33:37.625 --> 33:53.290
That's true, but it doesn't make that a, well, then let's consider when to hit our kids with a baseball bat, because hitting your kids with a baseball bat in the head is, I think, and we can all agree, is probably not a good parenting strategy.

33:56.811 --> 34:04.274
And that's the illusion that we can't seem to snap out of, and I think it's because these people agree not to snap out, maybe not him,

34:05.370 --> 34:15.154
but most certainly him because at one point in time in this narrative, he said out loud, if I could do it over again, I don't think I would give my kids any vaccines.

34:16.535 --> 34:17.576
He's never said it again.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.657
A lot of times that's what happens.

34:19.717 --> 34:22.598
Somebody says it and then they never say it again.

34:24.773 --> 34:36.243
I've seen a lot of that pattern, where people are daring to say it, you know, I'm on this, you know, church live stream or something, I'll say it, and then it'll go kind of viral on the internet, but really only in his followers, right?

34:36.283 --> 34:43.270
So nobody will actually hear it, and nobody will actually remind you that he used to say that, but he didn't really used to say it, he said it once.

34:45.412 --> 34:48.715
And that can be weaponized against anyone on the internet forever now.

34:49.514 --> 34:59.300
Because if you ever need proof or somebody thinks you need proof that Peter McCullough is a good guy and he thinks that, they can play that video even though he doesn't ever have to say it again.

34:59.380 --> 35:02.022
Just like they can play a video of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:02.062 --> 35:03.883
speaking out about this and that and the other.

35:03.903 --> 35:09.447
If he took the job now and signed on the dotted line or whatever.

35:12.096 --> 35:22.866
I mean, if you saw the press conference yesterday where Donald Trump was in front of the cameras for an hour and the four of these guys were standing behind him, I mean, that was remarkable.

35:26.609 --> 35:28.651
For when given later in life.

35:29.741 --> 35:33.803
So when you and I were children, we took the single measles shot, for example.

35:33.843 --> 35:34.823
I got it at age two.

35:35.344 --> 35:37.064
By age 20, I entered medical school.

35:37.084 --> 35:38.225
I didn't have any.

35:38.565 --> 35:41.466
The single measles shot.

35:41.486 --> 35:49.870
So there he's playing another limited spectrum of debate, a little hamster wheel toy there for you to think about, wow, maybe we should have given them separately.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.731
Maybe Andrew Wakefield was right.

35:56.593 --> 36:15.048
measurable immunity so I had to take another shot and then by age 28 I was a fellow and then he told a story about how he didn't have enough immunity well I guess they measured his antibody titer and so when he had to take a booster for it he's actually telling a story about needing to take a measles booster wow

36:20.011 --> 36:21.132
I mean, that's gross.

36:21.192 --> 36:23.834
I want you to hear that again, because that's remarkable.

36:24.034 --> 36:26.056
And I still didn't have any measurable immunity.

36:26.076 --> 36:27.938
By that time, all they had was the MMR.

36:27.978 --> 36:28.678
So I took two.

36:28.798 --> 36:32.201
They're safer when they're given individually as opposed to combinations.

36:32.241 --> 36:39.947
It makes sense, because when you combine multiple different products in a single shot, you can evoke more inflammatory side effects.

36:41.148 --> 36:44.131
They're far safer when given later in life.

36:45.216 --> 36:49.280
So when you and I were children, we took the single measles shot, for example.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.280
I got it at age two.

36:50.821 --> 36:52.562
By age 20, I entered medical school.

36:52.582 --> 36:55.305
I didn't have any measurable immunity, so I had to take another shot.

36:55.885 --> 36:57.787
And then by age 28, I was a fellow.

36:58.428 --> 37:04.353
Who checked his immunity when he was going into, what is he talking about?

37:05.566 --> 37:08.629
That has to be... Stop lying!

37:08.769 --> 37:10.370
That has to be a lie.

37:10.410 --> 37:12.192
There's no way.

37:12.272 --> 37:16.636
Nobody was checking if he had measles titer before he went into meds.

37:16.736 --> 37:18.237
That's ridiculous.

37:20.359 --> 37:22.381
And I still didn't have any measles immunity.

37:22.421 --> 37:24.282
By that time, all they had was the MMR.

37:24.302 --> 37:26.865
So I took two more MMR shots at age 28.

37:27.605 --> 37:32.790
Well, taking an MMR shot at age 28, in my estimation, is far safer.

37:33.630 --> 37:37.592
than blasting a child at a very early age when their brain is developing.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.773
You mentioned that... When their brain is developing.

37:40.833 --> 37:43.334
How long is the brain developing, Peter McCullough?

37:44.835 --> 37:50.477
Because by my neuroscience training, the brain is developing until about age 22.

37:51.757 --> 37:55.459
That's when the frontal cortex of the human starts to fully mature.

37:57.008 --> 38:11.915
The frontal cortex is that place where Richard Gage or whatever his name was, got the railroad spike, came out of the, you know, he was tamping dynamite into the stone and the tamping rod that he was tamping hit the dynamite.

38:11.955 --> 38:17.598
The dynamite went off and it went up into his eye socket and it took out his frontal cortex.

38:18.158 --> 38:20.779
And he was like this, it totally changed him.

38:21.540 --> 38:22.300
He lived though.

38:23.206 --> 38:24.908
just without a frontal cortex anymore.

38:24.948 --> 38:33.736
And from the anecdotal story of this one railroad worker, all the neuroscientists in the world tell a story about what the frontal cortex does.

38:34.837 --> 38:39.281
But that part of your brain is not fully developed until the very, very end.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.545
And so when, when would it be safe?

38:43.585 --> 38:43.866
He says 28.

38:43.906 --> 38:47.269
I mean, what is he really saying there?

38:48.370 --> 38:55.016
that it's safer to hit an adult in the head, at least, you know, it's going to be harder to, you know, oh my gosh.

38:55.457 --> 39:02.463
The factors, the genetic factors, the premature birth can play into it, but presumably in the last, during the last lifetime,

39:03.544 --> 39:18.634
those factors haven't necessarily changed for any radically identifiable reason, but it's the increase in the number of vaccination products that are introduced into babies, very young infants, that's the changed factor.

39:18.954 --> 39:22.537
And yet you say that the medical orthodoxy and the mainstream media

39:23.357 --> 39:52.911
just refused to to look at the elephant in the room and see it for what it well let's see can i point out what elephant in the room they're not looking at here and why i think that these two have to be colluding in in some sort of malevolent way because the way to win here would be for this guy to point out that they don't do some of the things at some of the frequencies and at some of the ages that we do in america

39:54.229 --> 40:08.840
because it is a very devastating thing to show an American that you know you guys are given eight shots before six months old and we don't do that and Norway doesn't do that and Sweden doesn't do that and it's all optional in the Netherlands and

40:09.878 --> 40:27.844
The list is long in the ways that we could specifically zero in on the absurdity of the American vaccine schedule, the way that Mary Holland could have zeroed in on the absurdity of the American schedule in comparison to other countries' schedules.

40:29.504 --> 40:38.107
Because what's going on here right now is that the viewers are allowed to assume that the world does it basically the same everywhere, right?

40:42.410 --> 40:53.015
If they do not point that out, you can rest assured that that is scripted because that is a ridiculously easy dunk.

40:54.135 --> 40:58.497
And it should be a dunk that any of these people have done for the last decade.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.659
It's the easiest of all the dunks.

41:02.785 --> 41:07.087
Are you worried that I'm advocating against vaccines?

41:07.367 --> 41:11.689
I just want the schedule of insert other Western country here.

41:12.349 --> 41:20.013
And you would be making the same argument that they made for the last 20 minutes without having to argue anything other than, are the Denmark people dying?

41:20.533 --> 41:22.474
Are the people in the Netherlands all dying?

41:23.034 --> 41:24.855
Are the people in Norway all dying?

41:24.895 --> 41:28.656
Then maybe we can, you know, chill on the 72 shots.

41:28.796 --> 41:29.457
Can we chill?

41:30.277 --> 41:34.641
on some of these, you know, earlier and earlier things, multiple dosing things.

41:35.061 --> 41:40.586
But no, they're not able to explain that incredible disparity.

41:41.427 --> 41:42.868
It's not just a subtle difference.

41:43.048 --> 41:44.850
It's an incredible disparity.

41:45.510 --> 41:53.297
And this clown, after five years, seems to be unaware that he could dunk on his American friend by just pointing that out.

41:54.538 --> 41:55.459
It's just remarkable.

41:59.191 --> 41:59.531
It's true.

41:59.551 --> 42:05.356
It started with the seminal observation by Wakefield published in Lancet in 1998.

42:06.697 --> 42:09.619
Again with the Wakefield?

42:10.360 --> 42:17.565
Is he aware that Wakefield published a paper with Peter Daszak on the measles in the 90s?

42:17.705 --> 42:19.026
I guess he's not, right?

42:19.066 --> 42:20.327
Because this is just nuts.

42:21.531 --> 42:22.252
Accepted it.

42:22.693 --> 42:23.334
People read it.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.997
They started to get some concern.

42:25.358 --> 42:26.960
And then it was several years.

42:27.060 --> 42:28.523
Matter of fact, it was over 10 years.

42:29.648 --> 42:37.633
where there was enough kind of political influence, I think, from the vaccine manufacturers and lobby, where ultimately that paper was withdrawn.

42:38.034 --> 42:42.036
After a decade of being a valid paper, authors were pressured.

42:42.076 --> 42:46.359
Wakefield himself says he was threatened with professional reprisal.

42:47.060 --> 42:48.360
This is common.

42:48.380 --> 42:50.042
Wait, I thought he lost his license.

42:50.842 --> 42:53.344
I thought that's the reason why we're supposed to feel bad for him.

42:54.284 --> 42:55.945
I thought that, I don't understand.

42:57.463 --> 42:59.507
for seminal observations.

42:59.747 --> 43:00.749
So this is very important.

43:00.769 --> 43:05.699
So in Semmelweis in the mid 19th century discovered that washing your hands

43:06.491 --> 43:12.213
prevented infections when doctors were doing female pelvic exams, women after they deliver babies.

43:12.994 --> 43:19.516
When he made that discovery, did the research like Wakefield did and published it, he wasn't accepted as a hero.

43:20.176 --> 43:26.799
Just like Wakefield, he was censored and debunked and decredited, castigated.

43:27.199 --> 43:29.920
He actually died 20 years later in a sane asylum.

43:30.481 --> 43:31.481
And then Lindner

43:31.894 --> 43:35.536
And others came forward and said, oh, yeah, you know, washing the hands is important.

43:35.576 --> 43:37.076
I think it was Lister, right?

43:37.216 --> 43:39.217
Isn't Lister the one who did that, too?

43:39.317 --> 43:39.637
I don't know.

43:39.697 --> 43:39.957
Anyway.

43:39.977 --> 43:40.357
Important.

43:40.738 --> 43:41.798
But it took 20 years.

43:42.058 --> 43:48.941
When Sir Austin Bradford Hill presented the data in 1949, unequivocally, that smoking caused lung cancer.

43:49.461 --> 43:52.963
He was wrongly ridiculed, rejected by the medical community.

43:53.343 --> 43:54.703
The doctors were smoking.

43:54.743 --> 43:55.564
Nurses were smoking.

43:55.604 --> 43:57.204
Doctors were advertising cigarettes.

43:57.284 --> 43:58.605
No, cigarettes were safe.

43:59.525 --> 44:00.746
Papers published on this.

44:01.758 --> 44:03.540
It went all the way to 1964.

44:03.700 --> 44:04.701
So what is his point?

44:04.762 --> 44:06.584
Is his point that marketing works?

44:06.784 --> 44:09.407
Is his point that an illusion of consensus works?

44:09.467 --> 44:21.261
I'm not really sure what his point is, because this seems to be a little bit different than, for example, the story of the guy in Greece.

44:22.449 --> 44:30.981
who figured out that ulcers in the stomach were actually bacterial infections that could be treated by antibiotics.

44:31.242 --> 44:34.226
And he got a Nobel Prize for it at some point, I think.

44:34.306 --> 44:38.653
But up until that point, surgeons were just cutting ulcers out.

44:42.878 --> 44:46.540
And it took like 10 years for that practice to stop.

44:46.660 --> 44:53.604
And that would be maybe a more apt example here, but I don't know if he's gonna get there, which is also an interesting thing.

44:53.805 --> 45:02.830
Luther Terry and the Surgeon General report where they called all the chiefs of medicine to Washington and said, listen, bad news, smoking causes lung cancer.

45:03.450 --> 45:08.293
So we're in the same situation now where Wakefield made the seminal observation in 1998, and here we are 2025,

45:11.451 --> 45:17.775
And you know what, the public seems to be far more aware of this and willing to recognize it than the medical community.

45:18.656 --> 45:24.199
Well, I hear what you're saying, and I understand it also to be the case that it's across the world.

45:24.259 --> 45:26.441
It's in Europe, it's in the UK, and so on and so on.

45:26.461 --> 45:34.206
But let's see, in America, your homeland, why aren't people terrified, frankly, by the prospect?

45:34.666 --> 45:36.667
Because one in 30 people

45:38.290 --> 45:45.634
Why shouldn't they be terrified by the prospect that we are given more injections earlier than any other Western country in the world?

45:47.055 --> 45:49.236
Why shouldn't we be more terrified of that?

45:51.017 --> 46:02.863
Why shouldn't we be more terrified of the idea that no one who seems to be kind of aware of the problem has been able to save any kids from an ever-expanding vaccine schedule in America?

46:02.903 --> 46:06.085
Why isn't that their focus?

46:08.001 --> 46:10.663
by scripted design.

46:11.323 --> 46:12.444
They are on a script.

46:13.244 --> 46:19.828
Affected in this way, and a quarter of those being so affected that they can't and won't live a normal adult life.

46:20.868 --> 46:22.449
That will change the fabric.

46:22.569 --> 46:25.131
Okay, let's end this discussion right now, right?

46:25.371 --> 46:31.074
Okay, so a quarter of the kids will never do a normal life.

46:31.154 --> 46:32.055
That's what he just said.

46:33.108 --> 46:35.969
I don't like that because I think that's part of the illusion.

46:36.049 --> 46:38.770
So I love old books.

46:38.950 --> 46:40.191
I collect old books.

46:43.051 --> 46:48.833
And every time I get an old book and read it, I'm so excited because I learned something.

46:49.013 --> 46:53.215
Because again, remember this history is real and it's still tappable.

46:54.281 --> 47:03.444
And so I thought I would try to find old discussions of the word autism, old discussions of the term autism.

47:03.724 --> 47:15.967
And on eBay, I was able to come up with a book called Infantile Autism, Proceedings from the Indiana University Colloquium.

47:16.027 --> 47:17.567
I didn't put my Indiana shorts on.

47:17.607 --> 47:19.148
I was going to put my Indiana shorts on.

47:19.208 --> 47:19.368
Shoot.

47:20.556 --> 47:25.020
And there's three doctors, Don Churchill, Gerald Alpern, and Marion DeMeyer.

47:26.401 --> 47:36.148
And I thought it would be very interesting because, of course, if we look at a book like this, I don't think my camera's going to do very well, but I'll just see.

47:36.849 --> 47:46.516
If we look at a book like this and we try to discern what it is that we are seeing here, what are some of the questions that we should be asking?

47:46.556 --> 47:47.157
Well, again,

47:48.783 --> 47:50.905
We should be asking about old parents.

47:51.365 --> 47:58.951
We should be, you know, maybe that was because there's only a very rare number of people having autism in 1968.

47:59.231 --> 48:03.415
This is before the huge increase in the vaccine schedule.

48:03.555 --> 48:03.895
And so,

48:06.428 --> 48:27.596
you know, these stories of conversion that he uses this, this, you know, very rapid loss of language and headbanging and this stuff that these people have described is, I guess what we should see described in this book, along with the loss of social behaviors and things like that, it must be just as catastrophic, right?

48:27.696 --> 48:30.977
If it's just rarer in the past,

48:32.443 --> 48:38.326
then we should see something and read something that we understand and are familiar with here.

48:38.346 --> 48:44.349
So I'm going to move this, get this over here, and then I will attempt to read from my screen.

48:44.389 --> 48:46.970
This might not work so well, but we're going to do it here anyway.

48:48.360 --> 48:54.363
And I want to read just the full word because the full word is basically giving you an idea of what they're trying to do here.

48:54.843 --> 49:10.591
And I assume that this full word will describe a catastrophic change in children that occurs coincidence with some kind of, you know, taking Tylenol or, I don't know, exposure to peanuts or something like that.

49:11.391 --> 49:21.936
So the most appropriate prologue for this colloquium volume is found in Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact, published by Leo Kanner in 1943.

49:23.857 --> 49:36.703
Based upon his own sharply penetrating clinical observations of 11 uniquely disturbed children, he wrote, the outstanding pathogenomic, I'm not sure how that

49:37.475 --> 49:38.255
Pathogonomic.

49:38.716 --> 49:39.816
I don't know what that word means.

49:40.697 --> 49:51.902
Functional disorder is the children's inability to relate to themselves in the ordinary way to people in situations from the beginning of life.

49:54.605 --> 50:14.654
Their parents referred to them as always having been self-sufficient, like in a shell, happiest when left alone, acting as if people weren't there, perfectly oblivious to everything about him, giving the impression of silent wisdom, failing to develop the usual amount of social awareness, acting almost as if hypnotized.

50:15.294 --> 50:23.358
This is not, as in schizophrenic children or adults, a departure from an initially present relationship.

50:25.383 --> 50:25.744
Sorry, what?

50:26.364 --> 50:32.529
This is not, as in schizophrenic children or adults, a departure from an initially present relationship.

50:32.609 --> 50:36.232
It is not a withdrawal from formerly existing participation.

50:36.713 --> 50:36.973
Huh?

50:38.584 --> 50:47.426
There is, from the start, an extreme autistic aloneness that, whenever possible, disregards, ignores, shuts out anything that comes into the child from the outside.

50:47.846 --> 50:58.289
Direct physical contact or such motion or noise as threatens to disrupt the aloneness is either treated as if it weren't there or, if this is no longer sufficient, resented painfully as distressing interference.

51:00.697 --> 51:20.867
In this landmark study, Dr. Kanner described the essential clinical features of early infantile autism and clearly differentiated it from other superficially similar psychotic states of early childhood, as well as from mental retardation and certain rare metabolic disorders.

51:21.387 --> 51:26.830
His proposed syndrome has successfully weathered the test of subsequent clinical research scrutiny.

51:28.234 --> 51:35.200
The condition remains today, almost three decades later, as elusive and enigmatic as it was when he first identified and described it.

51:35.721 --> 51:38.963
Dr. Kanner was among those initially invited to this colloquium.

51:38.983 --> 51:51.895
It is a great loss for the participants not to have had the opportunity to share his wisdom and sagicity, what a word, in the critical discussions which made up a most important part of this colloquium.

51:52.742 --> 51:54.348
That's a very hard word for me to say.

51:54.409 --> 51:58.002
I apologize for my lack of tongue there.

51:59.096 --> 52:04.080
His historic study has given powerful research impetus to the entire field of child psychiatry.

52:04.100 --> 52:16.912
It just dawns on me that one of the persons who could have said that autism is a myth a long time ago and helped us out here was Andrew Kaufman, who's supposedly a psychiatrist.

52:17.492 --> 52:23.417
I wonder if the Breggins, also psychiatrists, have ever thought about the idea that autism might just be

52:24.299 --> 52:26.426
a word that's being weaponized against us.

52:26.587 --> 52:29.256
Autism Spectrum Disorder might just be a mythology.

52:30.205 --> 52:32.626
This book seems to suggest that I might be right.

52:33.126 --> 52:43.691
The many investigations of infantile autism inspired by his work have not, up to the present, fully clarified the descriptive phenomenology of this condition, let alone its etiology long-term course of prognosis.

52:44.271 --> 52:56.896
Nevertheless, many of these efforts have contributed greatly to our better understanding of childhood schizophrenia, mental retardation, developmental sensory defects, and to the effects of social and cultural deprivation.

52:58.618 --> 53:05.482
They have permitted an elaboration of increasingly well-defined notions concerning normal as well as deviant developmental processes.

53:07.002 --> 53:15.627
They have repeatedly confronted the specialist in child development with the inescapable fact that certain sharp discontinuities in development can and do occur.

53:17.728 --> 53:25.652
That the relationship between infantile autism and superficially related adult psychotic conditions is not as obvious as might appear on the surface.

53:26.553 --> 53:36.418
Perhaps we should coin a new term for the adult condition which evolves out of childhood autism, that is adult autism, as suggested by colloquium participant Gottlieb.

53:39.747 --> 53:40.808
So interesting.

53:40.868 --> 53:52.053
This symposium was designed to provide an open and genial forum for the presentation and discussion of widely diversified clinical and laboratory investigations carried on by some of the most imaginative current workers in the field.

53:52.113 --> 53:59.837
Dr. Marion DeMeyer herself, a central organizer of the symposium, has been devoted to full-time research effort in the childhood autism for more than a decade.

54:01.039 --> 54:05.242
She has been joined in more recent years by Dr. Churchill and Dr. Alpern.

54:06.422 --> 54:09.224
Yes, Schizophrenia, 10 years ago, her colleagues.

54:10.025 --> 54:20.311
Center, which have ranged broadly from biological, neurological, metabolic, endocrine, neurophysiological, behavioral, psychological, social, and cultural aspects of autism.

54:20.371 --> 54:20.551
Wow.

54:21.889 --> 54:33.791
The broadly encompassing scope of this program, which is amplified in even more inclusive presentations on the symposium, attests to the difficulty of Sharp coning down on the central questions posed by this syndrome.

54:35.911 --> 54:47.653
In his introduction, Dr. Alpern notes that in planning this co-occum on infantile autism, the program committee aimed for depth of coverage of the most crucial issues facing researchers and clinicians.

54:47.773 --> 54:50.414
This they have handsomely achieved,

54:53.335 --> 55:05.759
Is infantile autism a clinical entity, a circumscribed group of entities, or perhaps a pseudopopulation at the end of a continuous distribution of the grossly disturbed?

55:09.700 --> 55:12.181
What happens to such children as they proceed through life?

55:12.281 --> 55:16.762
What can be done to affect in any substantial way the course of this disturbance?

55:17.847 --> 55:25.429
What are the sufficient causes of the grave functional deficits which characterize this condition, whether social, genetic, metabolic, neurologic, or psychological?

55:27.110 --> 55:40.174
Dr. Platt bringing a fresh analytic viewpoint to the approach of this lucid clinical problem could express only the hope that as yet unidentified and even unimagined organic factors might be found to provide the basis for a non-empirical treatment program.

55:40.987 --> 55:48.951
This hope is more than faintly reminiscent of the same optimistic one we have all heard concerning the etiology of adult schizophrenic disorders.

55:49.451 --> 55:57.555
In other words, they don't think they're going to get anywhere with adult schizophrenia any more quickly than they'll get anywhere with this infantile autism.

55:59.151 --> 56:07.513
It would seem unlikely that final answers to the difficult questions posed will even be given by isolated workers pursuing their own idiosyncratic bents.

56:08.174 --> 56:14.395
Rather, the complexities of the problem call for a large-scale collaborative effort between investigative groups.

56:14.455 --> 56:23.698
A first step in this direction will be achieved when consensus is reached concerning the minimum criteria demanded to identify and specify the syndrome or disorder.

56:24.454 --> 56:35.759
If this colloquium were to establish nothing more concrete than a general acceptance and widespread use of criteria such as are outlined in the adenum to this volume, it will have served a highly useful purpose.

56:36.679 --> 56:50.445
From the lively exchange which occurred between symposium participants, individuals, widely differing backgrounds, professional specialization, and theoretical basis, it is apparent that the colloquium served as much broader if less circumscribed purpose.

56:51.758 --> 57:10.912
It is to all of these tireless workers, as to Dr. Kanner, that this volume should be dedicated their obvious enthusiasm in sustaining a durable research effort concerning the condition whose diagnosis is difficult to substantiate, whose quantifiable biological tags are seemingly non-existent,

57:12.591 --> 57:27.000
whose response to therapy of whatever type and duration is so discouragingly minimal, and whose effects on sufferer, family, and even therapists are so devastating, commands our admiration and respect."

57:27.080 --> 57:36.446
So that's really, doesn't sound like kids banging their head on the wall and having diarrhea all day and screaming all day.

57:36.466 --> 57:39.148
It doesn't sound like that at all.

57:40.683 --> 57:43.425
I'm going to just keep reading because I do think it's important.

57:43.465 --> 57:46.407
I do think that we might be on to something here.

57:48.348 --> 57:52.191
And so here's the introduction by Gerald Alpern and planning this colloquium on infantile.

57:52.511 --> 57:53.591
Oh, we wanted to.

57:54.712 --> 58:03.398
There were some questions about the topics to be covered in the last three sessions, a unanimous resolve that the first session should be devoted to the description and classification of infantile autism.

58:04.861 --> 58:10.685
It may be worthwhile to analyze the reasons that the classification problem of autism looms so prominently.

58:10.885 --> 58:18.551
Other psychiatric labels, apparently as ill-defined, do at least exist peacefully without constant professional pressure for clarification.

58:19.594 --> 58:36.545
Why are we so concerned with the vagueness of an autism concept which is some 25 years old and which refers to a comparatively rare psychiatric occurrence when the common psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia, a term about 50 years old, has yet to reliably be defined?

58:36.985 --> 58:37.745
Hmm.

58:38.626 --> 58:42.088
Three separate factors seem relevant to the dissatisfaction with the autism label.

58:42.108 --> 58:44.910
The first factor is related to treatment success.

58:46.377 --> 58:53.879
Progress in the treatment of other psychiatric disorders must be considered impressive when compared to the achieved for autism.

58:54.459 --> 59:02.882
Electroconvulsive therapy chemotherapies have reduced significantly the number of patients incapacitated by the many psychotic states.

59:03.362 --> 59:10.444
Similar treatment gains, either on a preventative or restorative basis, can be cited for several of the disorders which produce mental deficiency.

59:11.044 --> 59:20.536
The ultimate goal of any psychiatric classification scheme is to aid in achieving sufficient understanding to allow treatment modifications.

59:20.576 --> 59:26.083
This suggests that if other psychiatric conditions on the poor treatment record we have in the field of autism

59:27.438 --> 59:35.226
had the poor treatment record we have in the field of autism, an equal fervor for nauseological considerations might exist.

59:35.286 --> 59:45.797
So in other words, because they think they can treat schizophrenia with these treatments, they think that that's why they're allowed to exist, whereas autism is already always argued about.

59:45.838 --> 59:47.980
So this colloquium is going to try to define it.

59:52.270 --> 01:00:06.378
So the definition among scientists, the first of these sessions, in addition, needs to communicate and discover the remedy of the etiology of all the final and less altruistic reasons investigators work for the definitions of childhood autism.

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:14.302
This reason, which must be honestly faced, involves the accolades accorded to those who successfully propagate a new definition or classification.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:37.651
I need to read this whole thing to you because it's really important that you see what's going on here and exactly how, what you see with Dr. Peter McCullough and what you see with CHD and profound autism and severe autism and one quarter is all severe and this, this is all part of this right here.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:48.229
The second reason underlying the common call for consideration of definitions relates to the basic tasks of scientific definitions, which will allow meaningful communication among scientists.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:01:03.080
In other words, if CHD has confused the definition of autism with vaccine injury and neurological injury due to inappropriate intramuscular injection of substances, then we're never going to escape.

01:01:03.928 --> 01:01:09.911
especially if autism was something that was real at some point in time, we're really never going to escape.

01:01:11.392 --> 01:01:16.914
Today, a reader may find the journal article of this statement as only definition of the experimental population.

01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:19.415
15 autistic children were the subjects of the study.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:25.918
The problem is that the reader cannot assume he knows what population of children the article's author has sampled.

01:01:26.359 --> 01:01:29.060
He might be reading about children with or without speech.

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:33.395
He might be reading about children with low or average or high intelligence.

01:01:33.415 --> 01:01:37.422
Do you understand that this is in the 50s and 60s?

01:01:37.462 --> 01:01:38.023
This is a 1968 book.

01:01:43.547 --> 01:01:51.509
The intellectual and communication levels of the child is frequently extremely relevant in our investigation, but these subject variables are often not studied or reported.

01:01:51.949 --> 01:01:56.610
We now seem acutely aware that we cannot excuse such lack of communication.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:05.412
In the past, we have tended to allow or justify such gross subject descriptions as a testimonial to the heterogeneity of the autistic population.

01:02:05.452 --> 01:02:05.832
It seems

01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:14.436
elementary to argue that the progress in autism will never probably occur as one investigator stands on the empirical shoulders of his publishing colleague.

01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:20.339
In order to be able to benefit from each other's printed experiences, however, we must all speak a common definitional language.

01:02:20.819 --> 01:02:24.461
We should not tolerate confusion generated by individuals being committed

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.065
to idiosyncratic definitions of autism, and here's why.

01:02:28.525 --> 01:02:38.958
In addition, our need to communicate and to discover and remedy the etiology of autism, there is a final, less altruistic reason for better definitions.

01:02:40.031 --> 01:02:47.993
This reason, which must be honestly faced, involves the accolades accorded to those who successfully propagate a new definition of the classification.

01:02:48.593 --> 01:03:01.577
An example I can give you from neuroscience is this trend a few years ago where studying face cells in monkeys was confounded as studying the circuits in autism because autistic kids don't know faces.

01:03:03.328 --> 01:03:15.815
I shit you not, but that's exactly what they're talking about here, is that there's so much fame to be gained by, you know, framing your experiments as relative to something like autism.

01:03:15.855 --> 01:03:17.155
We have to be aware of that.

01:03:17.556 --> 01:03:27.741
Like the discovery of a new celestial body or scientific breakthrough, a new definition or classification that becomes widely accepted can gain the originator his work and his theories increased stature.

01:03:30.595 --> 01:03:34.498
Sounds a little bit like the MMR scheme and Andrew Wakefield.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:47.068
This type of hindrance exists and each worker must attempt to control it in himself while the opportunity of the researchers seek reliable definitions to be incorporated into a useful classification scheme.

01:03:47.528 --> 01:03:50.571
Imagine if they pulled the same shit with virology.

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:58.809
We need to listen to each other with a detached objectivity that allows unbiased appreciation of each one's contributions.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:04.251
How we can successfully integrate the most productive aspects of all we learn is a problem.

01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:10.034
The most productive aspects of all we've learned during the pandemic are essentially ignored.

01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:16.657
We have made no progress since Mary Holland and Paul Offit took over the limited spectrum of debate.

01:04:16.737 --> 01:04:17.778
No progress at all.

01:04:22.711 --> 01:04:25.733
And the first session of three, and then we're going to go in here.

01:04:25.773 --> 01:04:29.955
So I'm going to look at the classifications of autism, and I'm going to go right here to.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:44.402
I mean, I just wanted you to see that when we're thinking about this very, very difficult problem.

01:04:50.350 --> 01:05:01.015
They're looking for common denominators, you know, they want, they want to understand if it's something to do with the nature of the, where, where, where can they get hints?

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:04.837
With respect to early infantile autism, there are three main issues.

01:05:06.462 --> 01:05:12.046
The first, is there any grounds for isolating the condition as one which differs from other psychological disorders?

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:21.192
So should we separate it from other crazy people, other broken brains, other mal-developed brains?

01:05:21.272 --> 01:05:21.712
I don't know.

01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:24.894
Are there grounds for differentiating the criteria?

01:05:24.934 --> 01:05:25.735
What should we use?

01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:29.718
Third, is the condition placed in a unique category of its own?

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:41.773
And so now, does this sound like a kid who goes to screaming and banging on the wall with pain and screaming, can't talk anymore, lost?

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:43.694
Does it sound like that to you?

01:05:47.517 --> 01:05:49.659
Does it sound like profound autism?

01:05:54.022 --> 01:05:55.703
I think this sounds like something else.

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.085
I think this sounds like a very, very different thing.

01:05:59.645 --> 01:06:20.807
extreme autistic aloneness a delay in the acquisition of speech together with abnormalities of language particularly the reversal of pronouns and echoing excellent rote memory and apparently obsessive desire for the maintenance of sameness i mean some of this stuff sounds familiar right but

01:06:22.142 --> 01:06:26.706
But you can reach that state of consciousness from different routes.

01:06:26.786 --> 01:06:29.969
There's no reason to try and explain it as all one thing.

01:06:30.009 --> 01:06:37.616
And if these children in the 40s and the 50s... You see, it's a different time.

01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:40.119
It's a different vaccine schedule.

01:06:43.752 --> 01:06:45.673
So what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen?

01:06:45.713 --> 01:06:52.615
What do you think is happening here when Peter McCullough tells us about a spectrum of disorders and these guys agree on it?

01:06:54.415 --> 01:07:09.160
What I'm suggesting to you is that autism spectrum disorder takes a very rare childhood disorder and tries to distort it as something that is growing in our society as a spectrum.

01:07:13.499 --> 01:07:14.300
And it's not true.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:22.705
It is being used to disguise the fact that intramuscular injection has never been an appropriate way to administer medicine.

01:07:24.466 --> 01:07:32.091
And it may be that even subcutaneous administration of things by a needle is also not a good way to administer medicine.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:32.692
It's possible.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:44.407
But this is definitely a malevolent narrative, a mythology that has been given to us, given to our parents, that we inherited from our parents.

01:07:45.368 --> 01:07:55.616
And now it's up to us, it's our responsibility as adults to make sure that our kids don't inherit it, that our kids understand that autism was something else.

01:07:56.836 --> 01:07:59.919
And they have now used social media

01:08:01.229 --> 01:08:08.552
to create this illusion that there is a whole spectrum of people just the way that they've done with the spectrum of gender or the spectrum of whatever.

01:08:10.613 --> 01:08:12.814
This is not real.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:22.738
This is an illusion created by an illusion by people agreeing to stick to a script, to echo back and forth a discussion that is hollow.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:25.880
Society.

01:08:27.485 --> 01:08:35.827
That will mean that everyone is daily encountering multiple people with these spectrum disorders that bar them from functioning normally.

01:08:37.228 --> 01:08:44.029
That's a prospect to be horrified by, that kind of societal change.

01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:47.810
It's existential to humanity, it really is.

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.851
Sociologists, historians,

01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:53.983
They should be alarmed at this point in time.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:59.586
Last night on CNN, Jake Tapper had on a mother of an autistic child.

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:06.991
And of course, in the United States, our media is in a sense opposition politics.

01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:12.154
So CNN is opposed to the current administration, including RFK.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:18.237
And this woman was stating, listen, my child doesn't have problems toileting.

01:09:18.297 --> 01:09:19.318
He's able to work a

01:09:20.558 --> 01:09:25.780
a low-level job, and the boy looked like he was about 20.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.681
He hasn't started dating yet, so there's been difficulties there.

01:09:30.221 --> 01:09:32.461
She goes, I'm not interested in what's causing this.

01:09:32.582 --> 01:09:34.922
I just want to know how to best manage this.

01:09:35.362 --> 01:09:40.324
So I do think there are some parents who are, in a sense, in this position now.

01:09:40.484 --> 01:09:45.145
They are not saving anyone from sudden infant death syndrome.

01:09:46.837 --> 01:10:08.848
They're not saving anyone from acute neurological damage or a permanent development, a development disruption, a permanent derailing of what would otherwise be a beautiful trajectory across time, just because you can't detect it.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:28.674
How do you know that your daughter shouldn't be a all-star soccer player and also a calculus genius if you gave her multiple injections before she was two?

01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:39.524
How would you know if your son is supposed to be an engineer and have some kind of math gift if you gave your son 10 injections before he was two?

01:10:42.028 --> 01:10:42.948
Let me flip it around.

01:10:43.228 --> 01:10:54.912
How would you know if your daughter wasn't supposed to be a gifted athlete if before she was two, you kept hitting her in the knees with baseball bats so she couldn't run around?

01:10:57.352 --> 01:11:02.194
How would you know if your daughter was supposed to be a piano genius if you never put a piano in front of her?

01:11:02.234 --> 01:11:06.115
Instead, you beat her hands with bats while she was two years old.

01:11:08.855 --> 01:11:10.416
So how are you supposed to know

01:11:11.983 --> 01:11:27.637
that these kids aren't hurt, aren't injured, aren't suffering, aren't just less than they would be, less remarkable than they would be, had we not intervened during this crucial time points in their lives.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.825
I would go so far as to say that the pain and psychological torture

01:11:37.788 --> 01:11:54.767
of a parent surrendering their child to the puncture of a needle is already possibly psychologically traumatic enough to have permanent changes on the mental trajectory across time that that person is.

01:11:54.887 --> 01:11:57.790
It's like when your mom

01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:05.856
slams you against the wall when you're 10 years old and starts beating you on your face repeatedly.

01:12:06.936 --> 01:12:11.219
And instead of telling her to calm down, your dad walks out of the room.

01:12:15.763 --> 01:12:24.129
So what we're dealing with here is a extremely malevolent, extremely malevolent tale.

01:12:26.055 --> 01:12:37.377
where no precision at all in terms of ranking the priority of messaging, ranking the priority of the problem, ranking what would be understanding what's going on.

01:12:38.138 --> 01:12:46.279
It's completely obfuscated here without any mention of the ridiculous vaccine schedule in America relative to his.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.961
And not mentioning at all the idea that the whole concept might be lost

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:57.330
Nope.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:01.015
It's not gonna happen, ladies and gentlemen, because these people are part of the trap.

01:13:01.595 --> 01:13:03.317
This is Team Robert Malone right here.

01:13:04.238 --> 01:13:06.301
I mean, this is Team Kevin McKernan right here.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.081
Now, and they're just scrambling.

01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:13.265
You know, autism is grossly under-researched.

01:13:13.445 --> 01:13:16.168
There's almost no major research programs.

01:13:16.228 --> 01:13:21.814
By this time, we should have, you know, 100,000 children in a large prospective cohort study.

01:13:21.834 --> 01:13:23.315
We should have huge randomized trials.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:24.116
Now, why is that?

01:13:24.156 --> 01:13:31.224
Well, because neuroscience has funded, to the tune of billions of dollars, research into particular genes.

01:13:32.589 --> 01:13:34.290
as a way of looking at autism.

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:41.193
So they did a lot of, you know, correlation studies, and they listed a bunch of genes, and then they made a bunch of knockout mice, and they did all that stuff.

01:13:42.473 --> 01:13:43.373
That's for sure.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:48.375
But that had nothing to do with autism, it was just argued.

01:13:49.376 --> 01:14:02.161
It was just, you know, the way that the grant would be written, the way that the grant call would be, you know, knockout mice, studies with with genes, you know, correlated with autism, here's a list, that's it.

01:14:03.442 --> 01:14:04.562
billions of dollars.

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:10.904
Just right dead center human genome projects type stuff and nothing more.

01:14:12.144 --> 01:14:15.965
There's almost no drug development at all to treat autism.

01:14:16.505 --> 01:14:18.065
There's the types of studies.

01:14:18.545 --> 01:14:23.786
But Andrew Wakefield used secretin to cure Pauly Tommy's kid.

01:14:24.446 --> 01:14:26.147
There's a newspaper article about it.

01:14:26.187 --> 01:14:27.227
So what is he talking about?

01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:28.107
It's already cured.

01:14:28.727 --> 01:14:29.167
Freaking.

01:14:31.788 --> 01:14:32.548
Are you kidding me?

01:14:35.492 --> 01:14:37.513
Where is that magazine for shit's sake?

01:14:39.714 --> 01:14:40.775
She cured her dog.

01:14:40.855 --> 01:14:41.896
She cured her son.

01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:44.857
Look, I have the magazine right here from 2008.

01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:47.399
She cured her son.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.501
What is he talking about?

01:14:50.521 --> 01:14:56.004
There's been studies of the microbiome and other strategies.

01:14:56.536 --> 01:15:01.020
Just a handful of autistic kids have been evaluated.

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.261
I can tell you this is existential.

01:15:03.402 --> 01:15:11.108
Remember that Paula Aitken's child that's 38 years old now that can put puzzles together and stuff, she cured his gut.

01:15:12.749 --> 01:15:14.250
His brain didn't come back.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.415
I don't know what this is, okay?

01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:25.920
I don't know what that Pauly Tommy article is eight years before this with Secretan and Wakefield and he's our new boy.

01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:35.846
And I don't know what this is, but I do think that this is a pretty honest book written by some pretty honest people.

01:15:37.546 --> 01:15:40.967
And at the time, these people didn't talk about converting.

01:15:41.768 --> 01:15:43.248
They didn't talk about SIDS.

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:47.589
They didn't talk about, you know, instant loss of language.

01:15:47.969 --> 01:15:49.530
They didn't talk about diarrhea.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.771
Didn't talk about head banging and screaming.

01:15:58.874 --> 01:16:20.022
It's an interesting difference that cannot be discounted because I believe autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:16:25.696 --> 01:16:29.146
It's being ignored by mainstream media.

01:16:31.331 --> 01:16:45.362
your agencies in the UK, it's the same all over, Japan, UK, Europe, in all Westernized societies that have accelerated mass combination vaccination, they are seeing these terrifying rises.

01:16:45.843 --> 01:16:55.971
By the way, the transgender crisis, which has really just been set on fire in the last few years, the vast majority of transgender young people doing this have autism.

01:16:56.894 --> 01:16:58.537
So what's that an expression of?

01:16:59.178 --> 01:17:02.503
Okay, so first of all, transgender is not...

01:17:03.658 --> 01:17:08.720
so much the atropine in the water and whatever else they've said, as it is the messaging.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:18.024
Because you can just go back before the pandemic to about 2018 or 2017 and just start surfing the internet.

01:17:18.144 --> 01:17:20.524
Try to find anybody talking about that.

01:17:20.965 --> 01:17:24.906
Try to find anybody encouraging children to think about it.

01:17:25.366 --> 01:17:31.029
Try to find anybody encouraging adults to think about kids, to get their kids to think about it.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:32.049
Because it's not there.

01:17:34.451 --> 01:17:48.102
that went from being absent to being prominent at the same time that Pierre Cori was writing his testimony for the suffocation of George Floyd.

01:17:51.038 --> 01:18:07.934
This is a remarkable set of circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, because these people have overplayed their hand and I can show you, I can demonstrate it with their actual own words in real time that these people are part of this.

01:18:08.674 --> 01:18:10.015
They are scripted.

01:18:10.636 --> 01:18:16.942
And even if Neil Oliver doesn't get it or Kim Iverson doesn't get it, Peter McCullough gets it.

01:18:20.479 --> 01:18:22.300
Why is there a correlation there?

01:18:23.141 --> 01:18:29.004
The studies show that autistic children, they have trouble communicating and fitting in with their peer groups.

01:18:29.725 --> 01:18:31.566
They feel ostracized.

01:18:32.526 --> 01:18:34.267
Many times they're suggestible.

01:18:35.568 --> 01:18:42.613
They appear to be influenced by this flood of pornography now coming into the schools.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:49.957
And when they're approached by a counselor and you suggest maybe they should change their genders, they tend to

01:18:50.512 --> 01:18:51.893
take this gender journey.

01:18:52.433 --> 01:18:54.215
And that is an autistic kid?

01:18:55.976 --> 01:18:58.618
I mean, this is some seriously mixed up shit right here.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:01.040
Wow.

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.081
I mean, wow.

01:19:03.854 --> 01:19:06.395
It has nothing to do with social media messaging.

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:07.655
No, it can't be that.

01:19:07.675 --> 01:19:13.716
It has nothing to do with Snapchat or TikTok or Instagram.

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:15.017
None of that stuff matters.

01:19:15.097 --> 01:19:16.297
Facebook, who cares?

01:19:16.797 --> 01:19:18.337
Twitter, who gives a shit?

01:19:19.138 --> 01:19:20.838
It's the porno in the schools.

01:19:24.299 --> 01:19:24.999
Wow.

01:19:25.019 --> 01:19:25.079
Wow.

01:19:25.819 --> 01:19:26.720
Holy man.

01:19:30.196 --> 01:19:33.857
But there's been multiple studies, a big study from the UK by Warrior and colleagues.

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:36.298
It couldn't be the movies coming out of Hollywood.

01:19:36.318 --> 01:19:38.899
It couldn't be the movies and things on Netflix.

01:19:38.979 --> 01:19:39.660
No, no, no.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.680
Nah, nah, it's not.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.140
Hulu.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:51.604
A large fraction of the drivers for a gender change are rooted in this now autism epidemic.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.503
It feels like it has, there are many facets to this.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:57.524
I don't even know what that means.

01:19:57.544 --> 01:20:02.948
There's an underlying anti-humanism about all of this.

01:20:03.188 --> 01:20:08.953
There's an, you know, the whole AI, the transhumanism, you know, the blending.

01:20:09.153 --> 01:20:12.956
I got a language challenge for you and I know it's going to be hard for you to take it.

01:20:13.056 --> 01:20:16.439
So I'm going to, I'm just going to say it out there and I'm going to start doing it.

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:21.643
And if it annoys you, it annoys you, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to use the word human anymore.

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:24.720
I'm not going to use it.

01:20:26.181 --> 01:20:34.366
I think that one of the reasons why they want us to use it is because then we think of ourselves as a species and I don't want to think of myself as a human.

01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:35.547
I'm a person.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:48.742
And what comes along with being a person is my own rights, my own thoughts, my own creativity, my own output, and my own limited time on earth to contribute to the future, to plant trees under whose shade I will never shelter.

01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:54.643
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm a person, you're a person, your kids are persons, and together we are people.

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:59.324
And people make up a society, not humans.

01:21:01.244 --> 01:21:03.304
Humans are experimental animals.

01:21:04.045 --> 01:21:05.145
Humans are numbers.

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:07.148
Humans are expendable.

01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:09.430
I'm a person.

01:21:10.391 --> 01:21:11.552
My daughter's a person.

01:21:12.593 --> 01:21:13.994
My sons are people.

01:21:17.097 --> 01:21:17.818
Let's do this.

01:21:18.098 --> 01:21:20.700
Let's break this slave speak one word at a time.

01:21:22.822 --> 01:21:30.049
Biology with technology speaks somehow to a lack of awe about what it is to be human and alive.

01:21:31.277 --> 01:21:49.444
And that we've even got to the point in the early part of this millennium, as it being a commonplace for so many people to be so negatively affected by a medical procedure that is driven by the appetite for profit more than by anything else.

01:21:50.385 --> 01:21:58.588
But there is this contempt that humanity is being changed and there's a shoulder shrug as though it doesn't matter.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:11.908
Well, in many ways, this new computer online kind of environment, almost a virtual environment that people can live is kind of conducive to those with autism.

01:22:11.948 --> 01:22:16.631
Remember, a fraction of those on the spectrum have what's called Asperger's.

01:22:17.092 --> 01:22:19.393
Asperger's is actually the name of a doctor, Dr. Asperger.

01:22:19.953 --> 01:22:21.975
They actually have exceptional abilities.

01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:31.053
So Asperger's exceptional abilities in computers or music or electronics or engineering, they're very, very talented people.

01:22:31.834 --> 01:22:33.796
So there's some convergence between.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:37.506
There's some convergence.

01:22:37.646 --> 01:22:39.346
That's what they want you to believe.

01:22:39.406 --> 01:22:41.107
There's some convergence.

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:43.967
So it has nothing to do with SIDS.

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:48.948
It has nothing to do with the neurological injury that Brian Hooker would not call autism in 2013.

01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:59.851
It has something to do with this spectrum of things that can even, if you're lucky, you can be a great blackjack player and card counter and also just be a little asocial.

01:23:01.152 --> 01:23:03.193
technological advancement that we're in.

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:10.557
Our generation has so far managed the greatest velocity of change of any generation in history.

01:23:11.017 --> 01:23:15.220
Remember, for generation after generation, people were paper and pencil.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.623
And outside of electrification, which occurred around 1910 in the United States, outside of that, we've gone from paper and pencil

01:23:22.615 --> 01:23:34.040
and telephones that were shared in a party line on the street, and phone booths, all the way to an entire computer in our hand.

01:23:34.881 --> 01:23:40.143
And we don't even need to go work outside the home because everything is brought into us.

01:23:41.024 --> 01:23:42.925
So there's a convergence here.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:44.125
I agree with you.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:49.027
But autism is a neuropsychiatric disorder, for sure.

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:51.909
And the children are born normal.

01:23:52.918 --> 01:23:56.440
The classic vignette is a child comes in for a well baby visit.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.460
They're perfectly normal.

01:23:57.961 --> 01:24:00.222
They get a blast of vaccines.

01:24:00.382 --> 01:24:06.045
And between the, in the United States, between 12 and 15 years, it's about 16 different products given at once.

01:24:06.085 --> 01:24:07.265
They're given in 12 and 16.

01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:10.647
Now goes home, gets very sick.

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:14.169
Uh, it gets a fee between 12 and 16 months.

01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:16.350
Did he say, or did 12 and 16 years?

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.010
That's weird.

01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:18.751
Look at this big boy.

01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:20.432
Look at this big boy.

01:24:20.872 --> 01:24:21.833
Such a good boy.

01:24:21.853 --> 01:24:23.675
Don't get mad at me for picking you up.

01:24:24.035 --> 01:24:25.156
He hates getting picked up.

01:24:25.676 --> 01:24:28.598
He's so, so hardcore about not being picked up.

01:24:29.219 --> 01:24:29.879
Okay, here we go.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:30.780
We're going to click it again.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.641
Let's resume this show.

01:24:33.082 --> 01:24:34.163
Hold on one second, Mikey.

01:24:34.923 --> 01:24:36.965
Ever and then has a seizure.

01:24:37.165 --> 01:24:38.606
It can result in one to two outcomes.

01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:39.847
One is sudden infant death.

01:24:39.927 --> 01:24:42.149
If the parents aren't around, the child can die.

01:24:43.219 --> 01:24:48.805
or if the child survives, then they appear from that point in time neurologically damaged.

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:52.428
They regress and it's almost immediate that parents report this.

01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:55.531
We know that the high fever is due to cytokines.

01:24:55.551 --> 01:24:58.414
These are inflammatory factors responding to the vaccines.

01:24:58.734 --> 01:25:01.998
They surge into the brain and they cause brain damage.

01:25:02.586 --> 01:25:12.577
And there are multiple papers, there's about over 200 peer-reviewed papers showing that the biological basis of autism is immune system dysfunction.

01:25:12.657 --> 01:25:14.158
Something is triggering the immune system.

01:25:14.219 --> 01:25:15.700
So the data fits.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.846
So in the United States, about three to 4% of children per year have a febrile seizure.

01:25:22.699 --> 01:25:30.024
My daughter had a febrile seizure about six days old or so, and we blame it on this.

01:25:31.365 --> 01:25:35.108
I see a question in the chat, with all this info, did you get your dog vaccinated?

01:25:35.188 --> 01:25:37.749
And I have a very practical answer for you.

01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:49.398
We have a wonderful vet who's totally down with everything that we want to do, but Mike is going to be a very big dog and for a great Pyrenee,

01:25:50.079 --> 01:25:51.944
He has a very high prey drive.

01:25:52.826 --> 01:25:57.398
He chases things, and more importantly, he does bite my son.

01:25:58.345 --> 01:26:04.711
It's play biting, but he uses his teeth and he's young and he barks and he can get angry at people.

01:26:06.393 --> 01:26:16.742
And in Pennsylvania, if he were to have an interaction with somebody and not have his rabies shot, you know, there could be all kinds of consequences to that.

01:26:16.822 --> 01:26:20.986
So he has had a rabies shot and he probably will have another one because it's required.

01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:24.048
But our vet will also check titers.

01:26:24.108 --> 01:26:26.630
I don't know what that means with regard to the rabies shot.

01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:31.172
And I'm not going to get into a discussion about whether it's real or not.

01:26:33.093 --> 01:26:39.257
Just suffice it to say that our vet is very understanding but there are laws in Pennsylvania and he's a dangerous dog.

01:26:39.317 --> 01:26:43.519
Like he's not a dog for unadvanced dog owners.

01:26:43.579 --> 01:26:49.663
I would never recommend that anybody get a dog like we now have if you don't know what you're doing because

01:26:51.696 --> 01:26:54.998
Mike as a young dog is a crazy dog sometimes.

01:26:55.078 --> 01:26:58.119
And he gets, he's got a lot of energy and a lot of instincts.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.941
He'll bark in the middle of the night if he hears something.

01:27:03.102 --> 01:27:11.386
I do think that last night we had him out on the porch and his leash was underneath the leg of a stool or a bench.

01:27:12.207 --> 01:27:15.909
And when I got up in the morning, he was still on the porch, but the bench was in the yard.

01:27:16.963 --> 01:27:21.387
So I think in the middle of the night, he just got loose and then came back.

01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:26.612
They are very, very advanced level dogs.

01:27:27.273 --> 01:27:30.716
Very, very much wild animals in some ways.

01:27:31.017 --> 01:27:33.219
Very, let's say, independent.

01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:35.921
You know, you can get him to come.

01:27:36.082 --> 01:27:36.682
He's great.

01:27:37.082 --> 01:27:37.862
He's a good dog.

01:27:37.902 --> 01:27:42.904
He shakes hands and whatever, and he smiles at you when you come home.

01:27:42.944 --> 01:27:44.185
He puts his teeth up and stuff.

01:27:44.745 --> 01:27:50.727
But, you know, he's got a lot of instincts of a dog, like a real wolf dog.

01:27:50.747 --> 01:27:52.908
You know, he's like a dire wolf, if you will.

01:27:53.388 --> 01:28:09.499
probably more real direwolf than what they're making and uh so we're really happy with them and most importantly i wish i could show you a video ruby is extremely happy with little mike um sometimes they play until they pass out together and it's just beautiful because

01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:18.084
You know, Mike is often super gentle with her, and she, you know, asks him to play sometimes, and it's just really a wonderful thing to see.

01:28:18.144 --> 01:28:25.809
So our soon-to-be 10-year-old dog, Ruby, has a new zest for life because of her little friend.

01:28:25.849 --> 01:28:29.551
And so the plan worked pretty well, and we're really happy with Mike.

01:28:29.592 --> 01:28:33.514
But I'm not at all encouraging anyone to get a Great Pyrenee.

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:34.235
Do not do it.

01:28:34.435 --> 01:28:34.955
Don't do it.

01:28:35.655 --> 01:28:37.357
Start out with a Liam Burger if you can.

01:28:38.626 --> 01:28:47.271
They're really hard to get, but if you get lucky, you know, you live in Belgium or something like that, or in the Netherlands, you can get one like we did, and they're just the best dogs ever.

01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:49.632
I love Mike too, but man, Liam Burgers rock.

01:28:49.792 --> 01:29:02.099
Of many causes, vaccines, infections, strep throat, what have you, a paper by Nielsen in Sweden, very important paper, showed if a febrile seizure occurs in a child before the age of nine,

01:29:03.067 --> 01:29:08.510
that there is a 40% chance that child will develop a neurologic disorder.

01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:18.476
You know, attention deficit disorder, autism spectrum disorder, various tics, seizures, motor disorders, the Swedish called the essence grouping.

01:29:19.296 --> 01:29:21.017
And so that now this makes sense, right?

01:29:21.057 --> 01:29:28.061
So if- Okay, so interestingly enough, in the third edition of the peanut allergy epidemic, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:29.322
decided that he had to write

01:29:30.034 --> 01:29:34.159
the forward to it, and Skyhorse Publishing wanted to do their own book of it.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:49.357
He writes the forward and he lists a whole bunch of things that are caused by the things, including, I learned a host of childhood epidemics, autism, ADD, ADHD, SIDS, OCD,

01:29:50.462 --> 01:30:01.913
ASD, which is autism spectrum disorder, narcolepsy, sleep and seizure disorders, neurodevelopmental delays, autoimmune diseases, and tics all began to rise in the early 90s.

01:30:01.973 --> 01:30:02.193
Huh.

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:04.835
This is a 2017 reprint of a 2010 book written by Heather Fraser.

01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:24.709
And it's an interesting thing to see that in 2017, Skyhorse Publishing decided to reprint this one.

01:30:25.985 --> 01:30:28.746
And in 2010, this book came out.

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:37.791
And in 2010, Skyhorse Publishing did not republish the history of the peanut allergy epidemic.

01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:47.795
But in 2010, they published the Andrew Wakefield book, Callous Disregard, which is the book that tells the story that includes Child 4.

01:30:49.212 --> 01:30:55.256
who is Colin, the son of Paula Aitken that I talked to on my stream a couple of weeks ago.

01:30:55.276 --> 01:31:11.086
A wonderful interview, a beautiful woman, a beautiful heart, and a really compelling story about how Andrew Wakefield has always been an operator, that Bill Deere, the journalist that outed him, was an operator, and that Paul Shattuck is an operator.

01:31:11.126 --> 01:31:16.569
They all wanted to find out how she cured her son's gut, and then they all left her alone.

01:31:18.812 --> 01:31:23.315
And it's because her kid doesn't fit this story that they wanted to tell.

01:31:24.276 --> 01:31:28.239
And they just pigeonholed him in and told him, told that it was all like this.

01:31:28.259 --> 01:31:32.822
So what's crazy is that this book that we just read told the same story, right?

01:31:33.823 --> 01:31:36.625
It tells a story about how people that define it,

01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:39.472
that come up with new theories about it.

01:31:39.913 --> 01:31:42.575
If those things catch on, then they become very famous.

01:31:42.595 --> 01:31:45.396
And that seems like kind of what this is, right?

01:31:45.817 --> 01:31:50.400
We're going to tell a story about the MMR and advocate for single vaccines.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.561
And it's going to go for a really long time.

01:31:52.602 --> 01:31:54.263
And we're going to sway some votes.

01:31:54.343 --> 01:31:58.906
And we're going to start a care home or two and a nonprofit or two.

01:31:58.946 --> 01:32:01.027
We're going to buy a ranch in Texas or two.

01:32:01.368 --> 01:32:04.570
And then we're going to recycle it for votes in America 10 years later.

01:32:07.543 --> 01:32:31.985
by redefining something that was extremely rare, had already a very loose definition and a disagreement on what it was, and confound it with acute neurological injury due to inappropriate injection of substances as medicine, and calling it something that it shouldn't be called.

01:32:34.574 --> 01:32:34.934
Hmm.

01:32:35.735 --> 01:32:37.957
Interesting times, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:38.017 --> 01:32:38.797
Interesting times.

01:32:38.917 --> 01:32:44.422
If 4% have a febrile seizure, 40% of them convert to a neurologic problem.

01:32:44.662 --> 01:32:48.705
It fits with this 3.2% and growing number.

01:32:48.745 --> 01:32:56.852
Now, of interest, it can't just be due to increased screening for autism because the other neurologic disorders are going up as well.

01:32:57.412 --> 01:33:07.416
So for instance, tics, which are readily identifiable facial motor disorders, they are also on the same rise as autism spectrum disorder.

01:33:08.136 --> 01:33:09.556
So that's really interesting, right?

01:33:09.596 --> 01:33:13.798
Because we already knew that almost 10 years ago.

01:33:14.658 --> 01:33:18.940
Actually, sorry, almost 15 or 16 years ago.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:20.980
Oh, wait, sorry.

01:33:21.521 --> 01:33:22.601
It's even earlier than that.

01:33:24.081 --> 01:33:25.102
How far should we go back?

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.422
Maybe go back to like 1988.

01:33:29.482 --> 01:33:33.546
I mean, I don't want to go back all the way to 1800, but we can go back to 1988.

01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:50.478
It's really interesting how long we've known this yet from a practical perspective, from a newborn child's perspective, it's gotten worse and worse and worse, even though all these people have known for so long.

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:52.380
Remarkable.

01:33:54.966 --> 01:33:57.048
Complacency around it is terrifying.

01:33:57.068 --> 01:34:08.819
I've used that word already, but the fact that these things are being observed at scale and the response is only, as you've outlined, for people voicing a desire to be able to cope with it.

01:34:09.933 --> 01:34:14.375
to address the symptoms, as it were, rather than to find the solution.

01:34:14.435 --> 01:34:27.120
And I've heard over and over again in the last few years, when I was paying attention to the COVID story and to what was being done by these gene therapies, that we're playing around with them.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.680
Everything comes back to the immune system.

01:34:29.261 --> 01:34:32.202
And I've heard the immune system described as like the Pacific Ocean.

01:34:33.596 --> 01:34:40.679
as it confronted the earliest navigators of incredible extent and incredible depth and were paddling around on the surface of it.

01:34:41.539 --> 01:34:55.145
And yet there's this arrogant determination to influence, affect the immune system via the vaccination programme to as yet non-understood ends.

01:34:55.945 --> 01:34:56.986
I find that terrifying.

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:01.132
Well, it's basically become like a religion.

01:35:01.212 --> 01:35:03.273
It's what we call vaccine ideology.

01:35:03.713 --> 01:35:04.093
And it goes.

01:35:04.473 --> 01:35:09.875
So it's a vaccine ideology, but they can't enunciate that the whole thing is bunk.

01:35:11.015 --> 01:35:15.576
He says that the immune system is like the Pacific Ocean and we're paddling around on top of it.

01:35:15.616 --> 01:35:18.097
And we think we know what happens when we do what.

01:35:20.318 --> 01:35:26.520
Is the ocean an adequate sort of metaphor for it, if you don't explain what that is?

01:35:28.643 --> 01:35:29.784
It's not really, you see.

01:35:30.544 --> 01:35:32.225
We're not really learning anything here.

01:35:32.245 --> 01:35:43.230
It's not really an apt analogy if you don't identify it as an irreducibly complex system that we are ham-fistedly claiming we have mastery over.

01:35:45.157 --> 01:35:46.418
Is it really that hard?

01:35:46.758 --> 01:35:52.522
Are these two guys really that bad with our native language that they couldn't come up with something better than what they just said?

01:35:52.943 --> 01:36:04.431
And that I, you know, some guy in the back of his garage can just pull things out from between my ears and spit them out and they sound infinitely better than what these two scripted clowns can say?

01:36:04.812 --> 01:36:09.475
There's no explanation for that other than them being on a script, sticking to a script.

01:36:11.617 --> 01:36:12.918
Because it makes them rich.

01:36:14.059 --> 01:36:18.581
And I'm not saying that these guys are doing it for that, although that's a nice bonus.

01:36:18.821 --> 01:36:26.103
They're doing it because they know they are part of the ruling elite and they're auditioning for higher and higher roles in it.

01:36:26.764 --> 01:36:34.026
It wouldn't surprise me if one of these people became governor of Texas or one of these people ran for a seat in parliament at some point.

01:36:35.247 --> 01:36:36.507
Hey, back to Edward Jenner.

01:36:37.605 --> 01:36:38.306
in the UK.

01:36:38.866 --> 01:36:43.888
I mean, the arrogance, you know, back then they had no test for smallpox.

01:36:43.908 --> 01:36:50.992
They couldn't confirm smallpox versus measles or tetrarysis rosae or any other rash.

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:59.256
So each time a vaccine was developed, they didn't even have a way of confirming the diagnosis of what they were vaccinating for.

01:36:59.876 --> 01:37:03.298
The same is true for measles, the same is true for polio.

01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:11.142
The hubris here is that, and how the ideology goes, is that mankind is vulnerable to infectious diseases.

01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:12.162
We're vulnerable.

01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:20.527
But through the brilliance of science and mankind can improve upon God's creation.

01:37:20.587 --> 01:37:22.688
This is the ultimate hubris.

01:37:23.108 --> 01:37:28.771
This was taken to such an extent and it's topical now, that Pope Francis who just died,

01:37:29.651 --> 01:37:34.793
He issued production of a coin, a papal coin, a 20-year-old coin.

01:37:35.753 --> 01:37:37.074
And this is during the pandemic.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:39.735
And it's a picture of a young boy.

01:37:39.755 --> 01:37:43.756
And he's about to receive the Eucharist, the body and blood of Christ.

01:37:44.597 --> 01:37:46.938
But instead, he's receiving a vaccine.

01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:49.819
This shows you.

01:37:50.889 --> 01:37:54.651
And there's always been money and power around vaccines.

01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:58.432
Even back to Jenner, he was at the right hand of the king.

01:37:58.993 --> 01:38:02.394
And we've seen Louis Pasteur and the incredible arrogance there.

01:38:02.554 --> 01:38:05.896
There was no confirmation that his vaccine ever prevented rabies.

01:38:06.676 --> 01:38:11.037
And how all these vaccines are developed early on is they're almost like a miracle.

01:38:11.077 --> 01:38:11.977
Here, this works.

01:38:12.077 --> 01:38:12.477
Take it.

01:38:13.098 --> 01:38:17.219
And in fact, during smallpox, people were forced to take it or otherwise be jailed.

01:38:17.279 --> 01:38:22.760
It led to the Imperial Vaccination League in the UK and then the Anti-Vaccination League.

01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:24.500
And there was tremendous protests.

01:38:24.881 --> 01:38:26.061
I mean, that's our legacy.

01:38:26.241 --> 01:38:31.522
So people say, well, you're surprised about protests over the COVID-19 vaccines and mandates.

01:38:31.842 --> 01:38:33.343
Well, we go back several hundred years.

01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:34.583
It was the same thing.

01:38:35.256 --> 01:38:36.096
It's astonishing.

01:38:36.116 --> 01:38:45.500
I saw that you had retweeted recently, I think, a post by the Vigilant Fox about aluminium.

01:38:45.821 --> 01:38:54.664
Scientists have found aluminium in the brains of children with autism at levels higher than almost any human brain tissue ever recorded.

01:38:54.924 --> 01:38:56.405
Now, this will be very interesting.

01:38:56.465 --> 01:38:58.566
This comment, I think you'll find very interesting.

01:38:59.358 --> 01:39:03.420
Aluminum is a known neurotoxin, and it's not supposed to be in the brain at all.

01:39:04.241 --> 01:39:07.803
How is aluminum at these levels entering the brain?

01:39:09.084 --> 01:39:12.205
Tell me, I understood the blood-brain barrier and so on.

01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:19.630
How is it coming to pass that there's this terrifyingly high buildup of aluminum in infant brains?

01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:25.153
Well, let me tell you, any metal that gets into the body and the bloodstream is typically bad news.

01:39:25.233 --> 01:39:28.735
And it readily gets into the brain, like lead, aluminum,

01:39:29.869 --> 01:39:34.653
gold, gadolinium, by the way, which is used for MRI scans.

01:39:34.673 --> 01:39:35.974
These are all forms of metals.

01:39:36.014 --> 01:39:37.054
They get into the brain.

01:39:38.035 --> 01:39:44.259
There's been a great concern that vaccines that there are trace amounts of mercury, thiomarosal, and aluminum.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:52.465
When we gave aluminum in high doses historically to dialysis patients, and I remember those years because I was practicing at the time,

01:39:53.626 --> 01:39:55.528
She tried to bind the phosphate in the GI tract.

01:39:55.548 --> 01:40:01.033
The aluminum went in the brain and aluminum toxicity in the brain causes more of a dementia picture.

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:03.515
The same is true with lead.

01:40:04.696 --> 01:40:10.482
I don't think it's necessarily mercury or aluminum in the vaccines, which are adjuvants that are causing

01:40:11.302 --> 01:40:33.472
uh you know autistic changes in the brain it's far more likely to be the cytokines and this wow well there you go that's a pretty bold statement he doesn't think it's the heavy metals brian hooker was wrong he got a very he went over a toxic toxic tipping point with the amount of thimerosal that he got from five vaccines while he also had an ear infection he just said that it was

01:40:34.332 --> 01:40:38.876
It's the cytokines that are produced, especially during multiple injections.

01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:39.277
Wow.

01:40:39.417 --> 01:40:47.525
Interesting, because that's going to dovetail very nicely with Brian Hooker's story that his kid had an ear infection and also got five vaccines.

01:40:47.585 --> 01:40:51.568
So it could be the cytokines that were produced by that crazy inflammation.

01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:53.650
Nothing to do with the metals, Brian.

01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:54.972
Sorry, you were wrong.

01:40:55.052 --> 01:40:56.073
Paul Offit was right.

01:40:57.674 --> 01:40:58.635
Acute febrile.

01:40:59.221 --> 01:40:59.781
episode.

01:40:59.861 --> 01:41:06.383
And believe it or not, some of this may be preventable with better education on how to manage a febrile seizure.

01:41:07.283 --> 01:41:18.165
So, you know, parents should have both acetaminophen or paracetamol and a nonsteroidal like ibuprofen available and be adept at using tepid baths.

01:41:18.525 --> 01:41:21.066
But we can't have the children get such a high fever.

01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:22.926
Holy shit.

01:41:26.027 --> 01:41:26.987
Holy shit.

01:41:29.949 --> 01:41:34.841
So vaccines might be OK if we knew how to manage febrile seizures.

01:41:37.833 --> 01:41:44.396
you know, maybe hitting a kid in the head with a baseball bat is OK as long as you're ready to handle the seizure that might result from it.

01:41:45.096 --> 01:41:46.056
Holy shit.

01:41:46.597 --> 01:41:48.037
To suffer a seizure.

01:41:48.697 --> 01:41:56.741
And here's the dilemma that we're in now is that many of us who understand this, we're at the age where we could become grandparents.

01:41:57.041 --> 01:41:57.721
It's very important.

01:41:57.741 --> 01:41:58.902
We could become grandparents.

01:41:59.382 --> 01:42:02.723
But now we know when we were parents ourselves, we didn't know.

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.365
And can you imagine the dismay

01:42:07.213 --> 01:42:19.382
and the angst that grandparents are going to have if their children go forward and allow these batteries of vaccines to be administered and their grandchildren develop autism.

01:42:20.102 --> 01:42:24.746
And then people say, you know what, we saw this coming, we warned you.

01:42:25.689 --> 01:42:30.210
And parents right now of autistic children had no warnings.

01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:31.871
I've talked to many of them.

01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:32.971
There's no warnings.

01:42:32.991 --> 01:42:35.312
They said, listen, we walked in, our doctor said to do this.

01:42:35.432 --> 01:42:37.032
We said, okay, we did it.

01:42:37.973 --> 01:42:50.536
And so historically in the United States, only 2.5% of Americans declined childhood vaccines, typically on religious or ethical directives like the Amish or the Mennonites and others.

01:42:51.116 --> 01:42:52.617
Now that number is up to 10%.

01:42:54.406 --> 01:43:07.854
So in a recent study by Mawson and colleagues from the Florida Medicaid program, 49,000 children in the Medicaid program cut at data at age nine, 10% of them had no Medicaid visits for a vaccine.

01:43:07.974 --> 01:43:10.736
So it's kind of a proxy for not receiving a vaccine.

01:43:10.776 --> 01:43:16.059
Now they could have gotten vaccines outside of a Medicaid visit, like at a school program, but it's a proxy.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.802
And the rate of autism in that group was 1.1%

01:43:23.465 --> 01:43:25.787
And the rate of autism in the vaccinated group was 2.9%.

01:43:26.648 --> 01:43:35.374
And among the children who had the most visits for vaccine administration, they had even higher rates of autism.

01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:40.478
And again, the autism that they're talking about depends on how they defined it.

01:43:40.578 --> 01:43:42.340
And this book already said it.

01:43:44.048 --> 01:44:00.906
This book already said it and I will read it again because I do think it's really important to understand that the second reason underlying the common call for consideration of definitions relates to the basic task of scientific definitions which will allow meaningful communication among scientists.

01:44:01.667 --> 01:44:08.731
Today, a reader may find in a journal article this statement as the only definition of the experimental population.

01:44:09.211 --> 01:44:13.874
Quote unquote, 15 autistic children were the subjects of the study.

01:44:14.934 --> 01:44:15.415
Unquote.

01:44:16.035 --> 01:44:22.939
The problem is that the reader cannot assume he knows what population of children in the author's article has been sampled.

01:44:23.059 --> 01:44:25.520
Sorry, I can barely read without my glasses.

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.441
I mean, I can read, but it's annoying.

01:44:29.298 --> 01:44:32.000
He might not be reading about children with or without speech.

01:44:32.381 --> 01:44:35.723
He might be reading about children with low, average, or high intelligence.

01:44:35.783 --> 01:44:46.272
The intellectual and communication levels of the child are frequently extremely relevant to our investigations, but these subject variables are often not studied or reported.

01:44:46.752 --> 01:44:58.201
And so in this particular case, I would argue that it's very likely that the subjects and the papers and the statistics that he is citing suffer from this exact

01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:00.789
Lack of specificity.

01:45:01.974 --> 01:45:03.935
We just agree that autism is real.

01:45:03.975 --> 01:45:08.556
We agree that people can study it and that people can check that box.

01:45:09.016 --> 01:45:10.557
And so we can do papers about it.

01:45:10.697 --> 01:45:18.459
And that is absolutely positively the problem here and how you can see that wittingly or unwittingly, these guys are trapped.

01:45:18.599 --> 01:45:24.101
The data we're discussing is cohesive, meaning it fits together scientifically.

01:45:25.021 --> 01:45:31.643
And the mainstream media and the medical orthodoxy cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this.

01:45:32.170 --> 01:45:34.692
It's going to consume us from a societal perspective.

01:45:35.933 --> 01:45:37.214
What does it take, after all?

01:45:37.895 --> 01:45:39.896
There's now RFK Jr.

01:45:40.657 --> 01:45:43.819
at the highest levels of the administration.

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.041
He is speaking about this.

01:45:47.102 --> 01:45:48.023
He has been concerned.

01:45:48.043 --> 01:45:51.145
He has been audibly concerned about all of this for decades.

01:45:52.466 --> 01:45:57.931
Surely now, in the United States of America, you would be expecting to see change.

01:45:59.349 --> 01:46:02.310
There appears to be complete acquiescence.

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:18.634
There was a recent paper in JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association, arguing that medical schools should intentionally recruit autistic applicants so we can have more doctors with autism, so they can relate to autistic patients.

01:46:19.795 --> 01:46:20.395
It's astounding.

01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:30.724
But do you have a sense, say with someone like Kennedy in the position that he now occupies, that you would see a sea change?

01:46:32.244 --> 01:46:44.748
Let's say in relation to the MRNA platform, would you expect to see that dealt with, withdrawn, suspended, or will that grind on remorselessly with the rest of the juggernaut?

01:46:46.988 --> 01:46:52.110
Usually, if we use the example of handwashing and smoking, it takes many decades now

01:46:52.802 --> 01:46:56.404
since the time of Wakefield's publication, those decades have gone on.

01:46:57.705 --> 01:47:02.747
But do you know even- It is not by accident that they keep mentioning Wakefield.

01:47:02.907 --> 01:47:06.029
It is not by accident that they keep mentioning Wakefield.

01:47:06.069 --> 01:47:12.633
And it's not by accident that they keep not realizing that Peter Daszak is his co-author on a measles paper.

01:47:13.453 --> 01:47:18.596
Even in the last month, in the major literature, New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA,

01:47:19.724 --> 01:47:28.495
They again cite Wakefield and say he's debunked and discredited and then he started all of this skepticism on vaccines.

01:47:29.445 --> 01:47:37.648
Well, listen, if his observations were so wrong and so scientifically invalid, why do they keep bringing him up?

01:47:38.349 --> 01:47:39.069
Well, precisely.

01:47:39.449 --> 01:47:40.950
But it's this inertia.

01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:56.856
If you've even got, as I say again, if you have someone like Kennedy in the position that he's in, with the attitudes and the understanding that he has long professed, if there won't be change under his bailiwick, then what does the future really hold?

01:47:58.375 --> 01:47:59.436
I completely agree.

01:47:59.897 --> 01:48:19.856
In my field in cardiology, for problems, emerging problems, we have what's called Bethesda meetings, Bethesda, Maryland, and it's the National Institutes of Health, the FDA, CDC, other agencies, industry, and we have, you know, it's usually well attended and there's a

01:48:20.796 --> 01:48:22.657
a schedule of presentations.

01:48:23.457 --> 01:48:25.298
These were all suspended during COVID.

01:48:25.318 --> 01:48:26.598
They've never been restarted.

01:48:27.118 --> 01:48:37.582
We need to start meeting, invite all the major players to the table, and start reviewing the data on autism, on vaccine safety.

01:48:38.442 --> 01:48:43.183
Don't forget the COVID vaccines are still being used.

01:48:43.223 --> 01:48:47.585
When I give big public programs, thousands of people attend, I ask a question.

01:48:48.465 --> 01:48:56.332
I asked, how many of you in the crowd know somebody who's been injured, disabled, or have died as a result of the COVID-19 vaccine?

01:48:56.352 --> 01:48:58.313
85% of people raised their hand.

01:48:59.234 --> 01:49:00.255
So the public knows.

01:49:00.295 --> 01:49:03.538
The public is actually not taking vaccines as adults.

01:49:03.578 --> 01:49:08.141
The only group that's taking vaccines because they're essentially forced into it are children.

01:49:08.822 --> 01:49:11.224
So we have 70 million children in the United States.

01:49:11.944 --> 01:49:15.387
We had 9 million actually take COVID-19 vaccines last year.

01:49:15.407 --> 01:49:16.168
It's probably more than

01:49:16.687 --> 01:49:17.607
than the adults did.

01:49:17.727 --> 01:49:24.429
In Brazil, they are forcing children starting at age six months to take COVID vaccines.

01:49:25.049 --> 01:49:32.830
And if parents decline, they get essentially a US $30,000 fine levied against them, or they get put in jail.

01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:43.112
And there's been published surveys of Brazilian judges who believe it's absolutely essential for public health for the children to be vaccinated against COVID.

01:49:43.492 --> 01:49:46.373
They don't care so much about the adults, just the children.

01:49:47.774 --> 01:49:58.542
Why or when will the, what is now I would say, consensus that these products were neither safe nor effective going to make any difference?

01:49:59.303 --> 01:50:08.369
Why are millions of American infants being given these products when we know, we absolutely know, that they don't

01:50:09.266 --> 01:50:13.087
prevent transmission because they were never tested for that in the first place.

01:50:13.447 --> 01:50:19.869
Wait, so is it more important that they don't stop transmission or is it more important that they're killing people?

01:50:20.869 --> 01:50:32.092
Is it more important that they don't stop transmission or is it more important that they're giving people autoimmune reactions on a scale and a breadth and a depth and a bouquet of different things that we've never seen before?

01:50:32.901 --> 01:50:40.685
and that all of these people knew would happen because transformation and transfection were studied technologies ever since Jesse Gelsinger died.

01:50:41.405 --> 01:50:46.908
And the people that were involved in this are people like Steve Hadfield and Robert Malone.

01:50:47.509 --> 01:50:56.073
And yet I'm supposed to believe that this guy is not on a script, that Peter McCullough is not on a script, they're just both getting together trying to crack this mystery?

01:50:58.414 --> 01:51:01.236
This is exactly the trap.

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:04.157
You are staring at the brick wall.

01:51:05.378 --> 01:51:13.085
It's only a question of whether you can smell the masonry and whether you'll put your hands up to feel the spiky surface of the bricks.

01:51:15.167 --> 01:51:21.674
Because you're so close to the brick wall that even a 10-year-old child could hit you in the back of the head and you would be bleeding from the bricks.

01:51:22.898 --> 01:51:38.607
That's how close all of us are standing to the brick wall when we engage with people like Peter McCullough, or Robert Malone, or Jane Ruby, or Dr. Drew, or we think that somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:51:38.667 --> 01:51:43.330
got there because of his incredible record of integrity.

01:51:48.871 --> 01:51:50.192
We are in a trap.

01:51:50.652 --> 01:51:51.873
Our kids are in a trap.

01:51:52.053 --> 01:51:54.995
And more importantly, the target is our grandkids.

01:51:55.855 --> 01:51:57.036
So we've got to wake up.

01:51:58.217 --> 01:52:03.500
We've got to apologize to our children for falling asleep at the wheel and we need to take control of our world again.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.821
I'm going to leave it there because I don't know.

01:52:06.182 --> 01:52:08.303
I don't need to hear the rest of these guys talking.

01:52:08.803 --> 01:52:14.227
And I'm going to skip a lot of what I was going to do as a wrap up because I don't want to end on a bad note.

01:52:14.247 --> 01:52:16.048
I just want to end on an objective note.

01:52:16.548 --> 01:52:19.471
I'm pretty sure that these guys are involved.

01:52:19.711 --> 01:52:22.453
I'm pretty sure it's important to understand Steve Bannon.

01:52:22.774 --> 01:52:27.037
I'm pretty sure it's important to understand the father of Brett and Eric Weinstein.

01:52:27.558 --> 01:52:32.802
I'm sure it's pretty important to understand Kevin McKernan and his father and brothers and his role in this.

01:52:33.363 --> 01:52:36.766
I'm very certain it's important to understand Robert Malone's role

01:52:37.239 --> 01:52:54.688
in the anthrax vaccine, in the whole narrative control during 9-11 and the anthrax afterward, I think it's a very, very good, it's a good hunch that Robert Malone knows that it wasn't Bruce Ivins and that they falsely accused him.

01:52:54.788 --> 01:52:56.189
And he probably knows who did it.

01:52:56.389 --> 01:52:58.970
Maybe it was even Stephen Hadfield.

01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:01.091
And I think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:53:01.371 --> 01:53:06.594
is the victim of a Truman show of the worst and most malevolent kind where he just wanted to,

01:53:07.134 --> 01:53:15.779
you know, maybe rescue America the way that it says in the epilogue of Don't Start the Revolution Without Me in 2008.

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300
I don't really know.

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:28.027
I do know for sure it's for all the marbles and that's why they told us this little silly story here about a novel virus that started in Wuhan and is still going around the world today.

01:53:28.507 --> 01:53:30.909
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:53:30.929 --> 01:53:32.370
It's a story about a background.

01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:41.216
It's a story that's only possible if they get away with using PCR as a non-specific indicator of something that is very specific when it's not.

01:53:41.856 --> 01:53:53.705
In other words, the fidelity implied by using PCR to find things has been so over-exaggerated to become accepted as the gold standard.

01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:55.730
It's really absurd.

01:53:56.011 --> 01:54:06.254
It's so absurd that you can actually say it as cleverly as using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

01:54:06.715 --> 01:54:15.638
And one of the primary reasons why Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan exist and have profited and enjoyed the pandemic is because it was their

01:54:16.258 --> 01:54:36.444
their job to curate this narrative from the very beginning, to tour the world, to talk to these people and make sure that they stayed on narrative, where they'd never figure out that RNA can't pandemic, that intramuscular injection is not medicine, and so they needed to make up myths like autism and gain-of-function research in order to make sure that people would never realize it.

01:54:37.458 --> 01:54:42.499
And transfection and transformation was always bad for healthy people, and these people knew it.

01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:51.262
They knew they couldn't make it pure because they were going to use the same shitty technology they used to make biologics, minus the purification step.

01:54:51.322 --> 01:54:59.444
And finally, the population pyramid is a real problem that all of these Western nations have, and they've been solving it with murder and immigration and liars.

01:55:01.414 --> 01:55:03.656
And if you're still here, thanks very much for being here.

01:55:03.776 --> 01:55:07.800
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

01:55:08.041 --> 01:55:08.922
You can capture it.

01:55:08.982 --> 01:55:09.843
You can sequence it.

01:55:09.903 --> 01:55:12.145
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:19.812
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.

01:55:19.852 --> 01:55:21.254
And I will see you again tomorrow.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:21.594
Thank you.

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:21.874
Thank you.

01:55:21.894 --> 01:55:22.175
Thank you.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.621
I think I want to go there.

01:55:27.142 --> 01:55:28.163
No, there.

01:55:28.663 --> 01:55:29.404
Something like that.

01:55:29.824 --> 01:55:32.986
No, that didn't work really yet either, and I still have to play this out.

01:55:33.787 --> 01:55:38.931
So I might just go over here to the wide side.

01:55:39.872 --> 01:55:41.814
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:42.374 --> 01:55:43.775
Thank you very much for being in the chat.

01:55:43.815 --> 01:55:44.516
I do read it.

01:55:44.996 --> 01:55:46.958
You know, it's just sometimes hard to keep up with.

01:55:49.122 --> 01:55:52.084
But I am seeing it and I will start to do that a little more often.

01:55:52.124 --> 01:55:52.504
I don't know.

01:55:52.524 --> 01:55:58.967
I got I got too many messages too much Too much to say To do the chat thing.

01:55:59.007 --> 01:56:01.348
So send me an email send me something on soapbox.

01:56:01.408 --> 01:56:02.609
It's good to see everybody here.

01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:12.454
Thanks for being here Thanks for everything for sharing for supporting I really do appreciate it an awful awful lot and

01:56:14.275 --> 01:56:14.835
It's a good show.

01:56:15.055 --> 01:56:15.536
Good show.

01:56:15.596 --> 01:56:16.356
I don't know what to say.

01:56:16.456 --> 01:56:18.478
Mark had a really great show this morning.

01:56:18.518 --> 01:56:19.358
He went on early.

01:56:21.119 --> 01:56:23.941
He had the fire early and I think it's a good show.

01:56:24.001 --> 01:56:25.282
If you didn't catch it, check it out.

01:56:27.142 --> 01:56:33.306
Mark has basically cracked this puzzle wide open with the book Germs, and I think it just... everything lines up.

01:56:33.606 --> 01:56:35.787
I don't know what to say when everything lines up like this.

01:56:35.887 --> 01:56:37.508
It's kind of, you know, I don't know what to say.

01:56:37.528 --> 01:56:50.416
I'm gonna see if I can convince Mark Kulak to come on a stream soon, and we're gonna enjoy together the Jay Bhattacharya interview of Robert Malone that occurred on his

01:56:52.758 --> 01:56:59.986
Illusion of Consensus podcast because that interview is actually way more interesting than I remember.

01:57:00.026 --> 01:57:06.493
I listened to it on the hardwood the other day and I could barely shoot at times because I couldn't believe what was being said.

01:57:07.194 --> 01:57:12.298
And it was a script, a script that, you know, Jay Bhattacharya seems happy to read.

01:57:12.918 --> 01:57:14.099
And so we are in trouble.

01:57:14.259 --> 01:57:15.420
America doesn't need help.

01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:18.422
But I think there are some patriots on the case.

01:57:18.842 --> 01:57:22.685
And I humbly submit that me and my family are five of them.

01:57:22.745 --> 01:57:23.905
Thank you very much for being here.

01:57:23.945 --> 01:57:24.586
See you again soon.
