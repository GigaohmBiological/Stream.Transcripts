00:04.795 --> 00:08.796
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

00:09.016 --> 00:10.556
That's a very nice compliment.

00:10.596 --> 00:11.256
Thank you very much.

00:11.296 --> 00:12.517
Can you hear me better now or not?

00:12.857 --> 00:13.757
Yes, much better.

00:14.497 --> 00:22.919
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

00:23.239 --> 00:26.800
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

00:26.820 --> 00:32.241
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

00:34.071 --> 00:35.852
And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.

00:35.872 --> 00:36.812
I don't wanna lie.

00:37.653 --> 00:38.633
I don't think I'm a liar.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.654
I try not to be a liar, I don't wanna be a liar.

00:41.214 --> 00:43.976
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

00:50.098 --> 00:55.721
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

00:55.981 --> 01:01.904
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

01:02.833 --> 01:06.995
Well, it's, I guess I would ask myself, like, I mean, I lie.

01:07.015 --> 01:09.736
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

01:09.756 --> 01:11.757
I really try not to.

01:11.777 --> 01:13.738
I try never to lie on TV.

01:13.778 --> 01:15.518
I just don't, you know, I don't like lying.

01:15.638 --> 01:18.720
I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.

01:19.880 --> 01:25.502
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

01:25.762 --> 01:31.665
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

01:32.594 --> 01:36.816
Well, it's, I guess I would ask myself, like, I mean, I lie.

01:37.417 --> 01:39.518
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

01:39.538 --> 01:41.519
I really try not to.

01:41.539 --> 01:43.500
I try never to lie on TV.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.281
I just don't, you know, I don't like lying.

01:45.401 --> 01:48.463
I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.

01:50.891 --> 01:53.575
A condition that we will not call autism.

01:53.736 --> 01:55.278
I don't like the word autism.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.221
He was vaccine damaged.

01:57.582 --> 01:59.024
He was neurologically damaged.

01:59.765 --> 02:02.449
A condition that we will not call autism.

02:02.610 --> 02:04.152
I don't like the word autism.

02:05.053 --> 02:06.055
He was vaccine damaged.

02:09.614 --> 02:11.494
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

02:11.514 --> 02:12.995
His name is J.J.

02:13.115 --> 02:24.500
Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD, and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

02:26.481 --> 02:32.705
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.466
He was neurologically damaged.

02:35.446 --> 02:41.570
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

02:43.251 --> 02:45.612
I'm delighted that there's so much laughter in the audience tonight.

02:45.973 --> 02:49.154
But just let me say this.

02:49.174 --> 02:50.155
They're laughing at you.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.716
They're not laughing with you.

02:56.078 --> 02:58.900
That interview at the time, it changed everything for you, didn't it?

02:58.920 --> 03:05.463
Well, it changed everything in the sense of I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at by most of the people.

03:05.703 --> 03:10.086
You're still obviously bitter about people's rejection of your ideas.

03:10.246 --> 03:11.766
No, absolutely not.

03:11.907 --> 03:20.991
What I am is frustrated at watching Orwell's 1984 unfold in front of our eyes by the day.

03:21.372 --> 03:25.514
That is frustrating because my children and your children... Thank you.

03:26.556 --> 03:32.843
I'm going to have to live in the timescale when the most basics of freedoms are being taken away.

03:33.684 --> 03:36.347
This is happening all over the world and it's coordinated.

03:36.607 --> 03:40.872
I mean, does anyone really think that George W. Bush is running America?

03:42.413 --> 03:45.394
He probably couldn't tie his shoelaces, never mind run a country.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.474
Tell me about the Project for the New American Century.

03:48.614 --> 03:49.174
Tell me about it.

03:49.455 --> 03:50.195
I know nothing about it.

03:50.395 --> 03:50.915
Exactly.

03:50.955 --> 03:51.735
Well, let me tell you then.

03:52.075 --> 04:03.898
In the 1990s, an organization was created in America called the Project for the New American Century, calling for a series of conquests of countries, one of which was Iraq.

04:04.138 --> 04:08.619
No, but honestly... You say to me... America is an open society, isn't it?

04:08.639 --> 04:09.399
Oh, please!

04:09.419 --> 04:10.259
It's not an open society.

04:10.859 --> 04:16.745
Well, I thought in my innocence that most Americans would know what was going on in America.

04:16.825 --> 04:20.969
But you know it all, and you see how preposterous it is.

04:21.169 --> 04:23.371
What, the fact that you think America's an open society?

04:23.691 --> 04:24.953
Absolutely ludicrous, Terry.

04:25.453 --> 04:27.275
I've never heard anything so stupid in your life.

04:28.296 --> 04:30.338
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

04:31.059 --> 04:31.959
David Icke, thank you.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.121
Good luck with your research.

04:33.141 --> 04:33.301
Pleasure.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.762
you you

05:03.736 --> 05:04.096
you

05:24.577 --> 05:26.618
so so

05:57.695 --> 05:58.796
and an

06:27.986 --> 06:28.947
There are no ethics.

06:28.987 --> 06:31.729
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

06:33.010 --> 06:37.954
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

06:54.957 --> 07:00.559
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

07:01.259 --> 07:04.721
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

07:05.101 --> 07:07.782
It's measles plus.

07:08.742 --> 07:13.444
I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

07:13.744 --> 07:15.745
It's just a big hassle in the end.

07:16.345 --> 07:21.707
But no, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality

07:28.512 --> 07:32.034
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

07:32.094 --> 07:34.636
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

07:34.656 --> 07:42.682
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.422
It can't.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.805
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

07:48.726 --> 07:52.809
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

07:55.009 --> 07:58.292
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

07:58.532 --> 07:58.992
It can't.

07:59.633 --> 08:03.396
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

08:04.296 --> 08:08.460
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

08:10.481 --> 08:11.022
Actually, J.J.

08:11.042 --> 08:17.667
Covey was insistent, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

08:20.993 --> 08:22.557
I think truth is good for kids.

08:22.997 --> 08:26.846
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

08:27.287 --> 08:28.930
We want everybody to feel good.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.255
That's not the way life is.

08:35.708 --> 08:56.068
Let me introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:57.209 --> 09:07.315
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

09:07.595 --> 09:13.719
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

09:13.759 --> 09:19.282
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

09:20.022 --> 09:28.369
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

09:29.850 --> 09:42.680
Particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

09:44.037 --> 10:03.345
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

11:05.819 --> 11:28.928
Gonna take a freight train Down at the station, Lord I don't care where it goes Gonna climb a mountain The highest mountain Jump off, nobody gonna know Can't you see?

11:31.249 --> 11:32.190
Oh, can't you see?

11:39.502 --> 12:08.443
Can't you see, can't you see What that woman's been doing to me I'm gonna find me a hole in the wall I'm gonna crawl inside and die Call me later now, a mean old woman

12:10.438 --> 12:15.660
Never told me goodbye Can't you see?

12:17.121 --> 12:19.962
Oh, can't you see?

12:20.562 --> 12:26.444
What that woman's done She's been doing to me Can't you see?

12:26.484 --> 12:27.445
Can't you see?

12:27.465 --> 12:30.386
What that woman's done She's been doing to me

13:02.853 --> 13:25.826
Gonna buy a ticket now As far as I can Ain't never coming back Ride me southbound All the way to Georgia now To the train and run out of track Can't you see?

13:28.527 --> 13:29.548
Oh, can't you see?

13:36.498 --> 13:37.739
Can't you see?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.361
Can't you see?

13:39.441 --> 13:42.003
What that woman, she been doing?

14:11.764 --> 14:12.965
Can't you see?

14:15.326 --> 14:16.346
Oh, can't you see?

14:17.626 --> 14:21.408
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me?

14:23.629 --> 14:24.949
Can't you see?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.011
Oh, can't you see?

14:29.711 --> 14:34.013
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me?

14:35.994 --> 14:37.054
Can't you see?

14:43.362 --> 14:48.644
Well, that woman, she been doin' to me Can't you see?

14:49.024 --> 14:59.649
Lord, I can't stand to see But that woman, she been doin' to me Can't you see?

14:59.849 --> 15:03.431
I'm gonna check the freight train Can't you see?

15:03.471 --> 15:06.472
Down at the station, Lord But that woman

15:11.722 --> 15:13.646
All the way to Georgia

15:49.612 --> 15:49.773
Hey.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.662
I can't seem to get it quite right.

16:03.722 --> 16:06.144
Maybe it's because I'm not really practicing.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.185
Sorry, I've been off the air so long.

16:08.205 --> 16:14.389
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a live broadcast coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

16:14.409 --> 16:15.470
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

16:15.991 --> 16:17.932
This is called Giga Ohm Biological.

16:17.992 --> 16:22.555
It is a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:22.615 --> 16:27.298
I used to be an academic biologist, a recovering hecatomagician, if you will.

16:27.758 --> 16:31.221
I know a lot about how the the sausage is made and

16:32.802 --> 16:36.004
Looks like the backlights are still on.

16:37.144 --> 16:45.710
You know, I have some rudimentary skills as a photographer and so sometimes I can see right away what's going on there.

16:45.750 --> 16:46.330
Sorry about that.

16:47.231 --> 16:55.236
Ladies and gentlemen, scrolling to that side of the screen are those people that are subscribed to GigaOMBiological.com in some way or another.

16:56.076 --> 17:13.190
I've added some other names on there if you've given before and you aren't on there and want to be please just let me know that's not a list that is exclusively composed of people that subscribe but for sure everybody that subscribes has a name there as of

17:14.051 --> 17:14.852
Couple days ago.

17:14.872 --> 17:22.598
And again, if you're not there and you want to be please just send me or V an email It's not that big of a deal.

17:22.658 --> 17:24.559
It's more of a question of how it's maintained.

17:24.579 --> 17:39.972
This is a one-man show In the sense of I am a father with a partner the mother of my children and we have a family of five and basically, I am able to do this because of them and

17:40.952 --> 17:42.734
and because of my supporters.

17:42.794 --> 17:47.719
I don't have a producer, an editor, a scripter, a reader, a recommender.

17:47.879 --> 17:51.742
I've got viewers, I've got supporters, and then I've got this stuff.

17:52.343 --> 17:55.366
A lot of it's out of a garbage can or off of Craigslist.

17:55.846 --> 18:05.715
Occasionally I buy something new, but basically you're looking at a one-man show, a one-man band, a one family

18:07.036 --> 18:22.127
information brief, and I think that's really important because in today's world of social media and modern media, there exists almost no one like that, even though everybody kind of pretends to be.

18:22.587 --> 18:29.592
Even Joe Rogan is supposedly just some musclehead who's so good at having conversations with people that Spotify

18:30.573 --> 18:34.677
saw a business opportunity to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.

18:34.737 --> 18:38.340
And that, quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, is just absurd.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.502
It's absolutely absurd.

18:41.322 --> 18:45.646
What we are dealing with here is an elaborate theater.

18:46.667 --> 18:50.150
There could be different parts of the theater that are funded in different ways.

18:50.290 --> 18:54.354
I don't have a control map of this grid.

18:54.474 --> 18:57.917
All I know for sure is that if you stay focused on the biology,

18:59.008 --> 19:06.131
don't take the bait on social media, that it becomes really obvious that so many people are being given a script.

19:06.611 --> 19:14.114
That's why they don't have any questions that differ from anybody else and why there's so much consensus across the board.

19:14.694 --> 19:17.355
No matter how far you look, how far you go,

19:18.395 --> 19:27.724
I want to start with a few things, but this is just a mishmash of stuff I don't even remember how many things I have queued up I don't I don't expect to be able to get through everything.

19:27.804 --> 19:29.445
I will letting you know.

19:29.525 --> 19:35.951
It's 1221 Eastern Standard Time I'm probably gonna drop off the air around 2 p.m.

19:36.572 --> 19:43.438
And so irrespective of where I am in that sequence I'm probably just gonna stop and start again tomorrow or later this afternoon and

19:44.838 --> 19:53.367
It's been very hard for me to get online, not because I couldn't find rock and roll to play, but because I'm referring to the computer with the music over there.

19:54.829 --> 19:59.674
It is more because it is very important at this stage to say something.

20:01.015 --> 20:23.089
meaningful and it's the right now show is such a show because that's really where social media tries to get you all the time and so if I click the button I want to have a good idea of how I want to counter the right now show which is social media I want to be able to throw a very succinct

20:24.042 --> 20:49.298
lifeline down into the cave and that's really what hit me today on the dog walk um is is social media is plato's cave and the people that are holding the puppets up in the shadows those those are the actual people on social media there aren't shadows on the wall joe rogan is the shadow on the wall robert f kennedy jr is the shadow on the wall

20:50.583 --> 20:52.446
Donald Trump is the shadow on the wall.

20:53.348 --> 20:55.492
Kamala Harris was the shadow on the wall.

20:55.533 --> 20:59.861
They all understand that they are shadows on the wall.

21:00.936 --> 21:05.421
And they all accept that they get to see certain things about what's behind the curtain.

21:05.441 --> 21:10.907
They get to know certain, you know, privileged information about how the sausage is made.

21:10.967 --> 21:17.634
But for the most part, they agree to be part of the shadows on the wall, Plato's cave.

21:17.654 --> 21:19.396
That's how we are being governed right now.

21:19.456 --> 21:20.798
And podcasts are that.

21:21.438 --> 21:22.880
Podcasts really are the cave.

21:24.475 --> 21:27.796
and the conversations that happen within podcasts, that's the cave.

21:28.456 --> 21:30.816
And so if you wanna get out, you just gotta get out like that.

21:31.937 --> 21:49.120
And if that means that we have to establish our own independent internet with independent websites that are just, you know, word of mouth, stream.gigaohm.bio and PeerTube, send people there, gigaohmbiological.com, send people there and let them figure it out.

21:50.882 --> 21:57.027
I think it's time to leave X. I don't have anything else other than my website, so X is really it.

21:58.248 --> 22:05.034
And in reality, I don't even think I'm visible on X anymore, and I'm probably just wasting my time being there.

22:06.880 --> 22:13.022
but it gives me some sense that this is still going on, that the show is still going on.

22:13.062 --> 22:15.023
And that's what's so important to see.

22:15.603 --> 22:22.246
The Right Now Show and all of its little satellite shows and all of the little hamster wheels that everybody is in.

22:22.746 --> 22:32.029
If you need hundreds of millions of people to be consumed, to lose all the time, because social media is not free.

22:32.069 --> 22:33.290
You pay for it with your time.

22:35.353 --> 23:03.348
Social media is not free you pay for it with your time And so if you're gonna do something profound with your life You only have a certain amount of free time to invest in what that is And I think my family We are pretty sure that this is the one of the profound things that we want to give back to our community and to the world if we can Using the internet against them as much as that's possible by trying to

23:04.924 --> 23:08.245
shed light succinctly on what's happening.

23:08.385 --> 23:11.927
The podcast universe is Plato's cave.

23:12.687 --> 23:29.953
And more importantly, it allows people to be put in all different little tiny caves that are all isolated from one another and move from different caves and really think that moving from cave to cave is solving some question or exploring the answers to some question.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.574
And so as long as you listen to Joe Rogan and

23:33.354 --> 23:39.498
a few other podcasts, you might be a pretty centrist, normal person keeping up with reality.

23:39.558 --> 23:42.220
And that's exactly the opposite of what's happening.

23:43.461 --> 23:45.842
And so I'm just going to try and show you what this is about.

23:45.922 --> 23:49.024
Trying to throw a lifeline down into the cave.

23:49.184 --> 23:50.045
That's the thing.

23:50.885 --> 23:51.526
Thanks for being here.

23:54.913 --> 23:55.174
The End

24:18.670 --> 24:19.511
Thank you.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.834
I appreciate that.

24:21.854 --> 24:22.615
That's very kind.

24:22.635 --> 24:23.296
And I welcome you.

24:23.316 --> 24:24.678
Welcome to those who are still with us.

24:25.098 --> 24:27.962
After Monday night football, we had Monday night football tonight.

24:28.002 --> 24:35.011
We had Georgia, Chicago versus Washington, or as Trump would call it, the hellhole bowl tonight.

24:36.152 --> 24:37.514
What a day for Donald Trump.

24:43.891 --> 24:44.271
You know what?

24:44.311 --> 24:50.199
He finally did something positive today, and I want to give him credit for it, because I know he's not the type to take credit for himself.

24:51.401 --> 24:57.188
Trump was in Israel and Egypt today to celebrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

25:01.263 --> 25:01.903
Sorry about that.

25:01.923 --> 25:02.703
That was a mistake.

25:02.763 --> 25:12.266
I was trying to figure out why that one text box is sitting on top, because it shouldn't have been.

25:13.206 --> 25:13.866
Sorry about that.

25:13.906 --> 25:15.966
Let me just fix that quick.

25:19.967 --> 25:20.487
Where is it?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.508
It should be right here, right?

25:22.708 --> 25:22.848
What?

25:26.380 --> 25:28.641
Why is that there?

25:28.941 --> 25:29.901
I don't see that one.

25:29.922 --> 25:31.242
So let me just, sorry about that.

25:31.822 --> 25:36.644
That was not choreographed correctly and it's distracting from the video.

25:36.724 --> 25:37.925
That's the one I want.

25:39.546 --> 25:43.927
So I click control there and then I send that to the back or what?

25:46.929 --> 25:47.189
There.

25:48.289 --> 25:50.910
So it should have gone to a transition like that.

25:51.010 --> 25:51.631
Anyway, here we go.

25:51.651 --> 25:51.831
Sorry.

26:04.261 --> 26:07.043
I appreciate that.

26:07.063 --> 26:07.824
That's very kind.

26:07.844 --> 26:08.504
And I welcome you.

26:08.524 --> 26:09.885
Welcome to those who are still with us.

26:10.305 --> 26:13.167
After Monday night football, we had Monday night football tonight.

26:13.207 --> 26:20.192
We had Georgia, Chicago versus Washington, or as Trump would call it, the hellhole bowl tonight.

26:21.533 --> 26:22.794
What a day for Donald Trump.

26:23.094 --> 26:23.455
You know what?

26:23.495 --> 26:25.356
He finally did something positive today.

26:25.376 --> 26:29.359
And I want to give him credit for it, because I know he's not the type to take credit for himself.

26:30.583 --> 26:36.409
Trump was in Israel and Egypt today to celebrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.813
All 20 Israeli hostages are home.

26:40.013 --> 26:49.023
So many magnificent clips could be taken from that, from the round of applause from the Knesset or the Senate of Israel or whatever that is to him.

26:49.643 --> 26:57.549
Apparently calling out Miriam Adelson about whether her loyalty lies with Israel or with America in Israel That was a weird one.

26:57.569 --> 27:04.214
There's all kinds of weird clips of Jared Kushner also taking a lot of credit and being given a lot of credit.

27:04.254 --> 27:06.816
So there's a magnificent level

27:07.797 --> 27:23.427
of material here to be disseminated on different sides and so that everybody in all these different caves sees a different collection of nonsense that they can then all try to, I don't know, come to an illusion of consensus about what the right answer is.

27:23.507 --> 27:30.191
And I guess Donald Trump is some kind of genius and knows the Middle East better than anybody else, better than Biden at least.

27:30.711 --> 27:36.375
And so this is the kind of extraordinary mythology that now apparently he's going to agree on.

27:37.421 --> 27:55.637
that the same guy who is incompetently destroying our democracy is now very competently putting together a deal that involves thousands of hostages and thousands of years of animosity and blood feuds and things like that.

27:55.697 --> 27:59.420
And he's just figured it out after bombing Iran and doing something.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.742
I don't know really what this guy thinks.

28:02.563 --> 28:10.407
I just know that this guy is a scripted actor and that's why whatever he purports to think is so ridiculous.

28:11.768 --> 28:13.389
That's about the best way I could say it.

28:14.798 --> 28:21.962
138 days, almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been released.

28:22.062 --> 28:32.868
And while we're only in the first phase of what will undoubtedly be a long and tricky process, the fact is the bombing has stopped, the hostages have been released, and Trump deserves some of the praise for that.

28:32.968 --> 28:37.751
And so I know it sounds crazy to say, but good work on that one, President Trump.

28:38.371 --> 28:40.972
Now maybe you can not invade Portland.

28:41.252 --> 28:41.933
Just an idea.

28:43.444 --> 28:50.728
I mean, while you're on a roll, Trump was in a celebratory mood today, posing for victory photos.

28:51.608 --> 28:53.589
A man of the moment.

28:53.829 --> 28:58.572
And you know, when he isn't double fisting McFlurries, he doesn't know what to do with his hands.

28:59.702 --> 29:01.644
Kind of does part of YMCA.

29:01.744 --> 29:03.986
I don't know where Zumba.

29:04.046 --> 29:07.349
I'm not sure what that is, but maybe he's trying to fly.

29:07.449 --> 29:16.017
But Trump took part in a signing ceremony, becoming the first US president to sign a ceasefire agreement with a Sharpie the size of a Subway sandwich.

29:18.221 --> 29:22.682
A lot of people were surprised that Trump was able to help get this ceasefire finally done.

29:22.702 --> 29:24.723
But I guess we probably shouldn't have been.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.364
This is a man who knows the Middle East better than anyone.

29:27.404 --> 29:32.145
Here he is talking about the close proximity between Iran and Qatar.

29:32.685 --> 29:35.686
Literally, you walk over from Iran to Qatar.

29:35.726 --> 29:37.206
You can walk in in one second.

29:37.766 --> 29:39.927
You go, boom, boom, and now you're in Qatar.

29:41.192 --> 29:44.354
God, I didn't know you go boom, boom when you're in Qatar.

29:44.955 --> 29:49.998
And then we looked it up, and it turns out the reason I didn't know it is because it's wrong.

29:50.098 --> 29:51.319
It's very, very wrong.

29:51.359 --> 29:53.861
You cannot walk from Iran to Qatar.

29:54.181 --> 29:55.182
You could swim 150 miles.

29:57.435 --> 29:59.537
But unless you're Jesus, you cannot walk there.

30:00.317 --> 30:03.840
Trump's been lobbying hard to try to win the Nobel Prize for Peace.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.603
He really wants that Peace Prize.

30:06.663 --> 30:10.906
So he's been talking pretty much nonstop about this for the past two weeks.

30:10.966 --> 30:17.331
And so it was with bigly disappointment that on Friday, the Nobel Committee made the following announcement.

30:17.772 --> 30:23.656
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2025

30:25.834 --> 30:28.525
to Maria Corina Machado.

30:28.746 --> 30:29.369
Nonsense.

30:29.971 --> 30:30.293
Bullshit.

30:30.313 --> 30:31.176
It's all bullshit.

30:32.725 --> 30:34.666
Come on, nobody likes a sore loser.

30:35.586 --> 30:37.527
I mentioned last week the Norwegian government.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.608
They have one, by the way, the Norwegian government.

30:39.628 --> 30:45.670
They was worried about Trump retaliating against them if he didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize.

30:45.750 --> 30:53.034
And the woman who did win, Maria Karina Machado, was maybe a little nervous about it, too, because she felt the need to call him about it.

30:53.334 --> 30:58.316
The person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me.

30:59.455 --> 31:03.496
and said, I'm accepting this in honor of you, because you really deserved it.

31:03.516 --> 31:05.276
A very nice thing to do.

31:05.477 --> 31:05.817
Yeah, yeah.

31:05.877 --> 31:09.838
That was a nice thing for the person who got the Nobel Prize to do today.

31:10.138 --> 31:11.738
I don't know why they gave this to me.

31:11.898 --> 31:13.919
It should have gone to you, Mr. President.

31:14.279 --> 31:18.120
So now Trump's focused on winning the prize next year, which is fine.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.520
Let him keep trying to make peace.

31:19.580 --> 31:19.840
Give it.

31:20.180 --> 31:23.401
I'm fine with coming up with prizes and trophies to motivate him.

31:23.621 --> 31:27.402
Give him the Nobel Reopen the Government and Leave Health Care Alone Prize.

31:32.512 --> 31:33.353
I have no problem with that.

31:34.273 --> 31:36.534
Speaking of health care, Trump got a physical on Friday.

31:36.714 --> 31:41.017
And good news, his blood pressure, cholesterol, and genius are all stable.

31:41.577 --> 31:48.221
His doctors say he's in excellent health and fully capable of continuing to make sure that millions of his fellow Americans aren't.

31:48.561 --> 31:53.064
Interestingly, the White House doctor left Trump's weight off the report.

31:53.304 --> 31:54.244
Usually, they put the weight.

31:54.364 --> 31:58.527
Instead of his weight, he wrote that Trump has a great personality, which is nice.

31:59.287 --> 32:04.549
It's also interesting to note that Trump got both the flu and COVID vaccines at his checkup.

32:04.949 --> 32:17.633
After all this, he got the flu vaccine, he got the COVID vaccine, he ate a whole bottle of Tylenol, and he washed it down with a gallon of red dye number two while RFK was screaming and crying and pounding on the door outside.

32:18.154 --> 32:28.177
And if you're wondering if it's hypocritical for Trump, who has denigrated these vaccines, to get them while his health officials make them difficult for the rest of us to get, the answer is

32:28.237 --> 32:29.798
See how confusing it is, right?

32:29.838 --> 32:42.748
Again, did Trump denigrate the vaccines or is his HHS secretary sometimes doing it in old videos or on certain podcasts but not in front of certain microphones or at certain times?

32:43.589 --> 32:52.476
And we're supposed to believe that what we see on our social media is an adequate representation of the reality of America and it's not.

32:54.554 --> 32:56.054
The truth is not getting out.

32:56.194 --> 33:03.636
The vast majority of Americans think that Donald Trump and his administration and specifically Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.956
are a unmitigated disaster.

33:07.156 --> 33:09.237
But that also doesn't make any sense.

33:10.557 --> 33:22.139
That suggests that the largest national apparatus of security and military and money and power is

33:23.203 --> 33:32.010
so vulnerable through its election system that somebody as ridiculous as Donald Trump can run for office and win.

33:33.070 --> 33:36.293
And there's nothing that any pity could do about it.

33:39.415 --> 33:43.718
That's the absurdity of this, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:43.798 --> 33:47.181
was able to sell bad ideas so successfully

33:49.155 --> 34:07.593
that he has a beautiful house, gets a half a million dollars a year, has this extremely successful multi-movie production company, and book company, and publishing company, and also non-profit, and he's a lawyer, and he does it all by telling lies.

34:11.277 --> 34:12.839
And we're supposed to believe that.

34:13.663 --> 34:30.879
that America is just so dumb or vulnerable or something out of control that somebody as, I don't know, I guess, silly, obviously unremarkable as Donald Trump or obviously unremarkable as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:31.399 --> 34:35.343
can be, despite our best efforts,

34:36.869 --> 34:41.493
able to rise all the way to Health and Human Services Secretary as a fraud.

34:42.073 --> 34:46.997
His entire career as apparently a fraudulent anti-vaxxer.

34:48.058 --> 34:51.641
But he made it all the way to HHS Secretary and got confirmed.

34:51.681 --> 34:52.382
Because why?

34:52.842 --> 34:55.584
Because he's so deceptive, I guess.

34:56.665 --> 35:01.389
Such a skilled orator with such deceptive

35:02.748 --> 35:07.051
coercive, enticing lies that nobody could resist.

35:07.131 --> 35:23.884
And now we're stuck with him there, just like Donald Trump, despite being such a creep and a terrible liar and a criminal and all this other stuff, he's just there anyway, nominating people to the Supreme Court and there's nothing we can do about it.

35:24.841 --> 35:34.088
because that's just a guy who's got control of the button, who's got control of the microphone, who has, you know, he's the commander in chief.

35:36.370 --> 35:38.271
Let's just hope he doesn't do anything dumb.

35:39.813 --> 35:43.456
And then this guy makes fun of it and says, that's exactly what's happening.

35:45.297 --> 35:52.803
And so now it has to become obvious that this is just an elaborate theater because there's no way that's possible.

35:55.589 --> 36:02.671
There's no way we're just kind of careening out of control with these guys with Jay Bhattacharya at the head of NIH.

36:02.711 --> 36:04.052
That's preposterous.

36:08.873 --> 36:10.914
But these guys seem to think it's totally true.

36:11.394 --> 36:11.834
It's real.

36:11.894 --> 36:13.235
That's how the system works.

36:13.335 --> 36:16.416
These guys got elected and now we're kind of effed.

36:20.293 --> 36:21.694
It's gotta be preposterous.

36:22.235 --> 36:25.218
It can only be seen as preposterous.

36:25.278 --> 36:26.940
We must snap out of this.

36:28.601 --> 36:29.502
Yes, it is.

36:30.263 --> 36:33.466
It's like if you found out Nancy Reagan was smoking crack the whole time.

36:34.909 --> 36:40.792
Today also happens to be Columbus slash Indigenous Peoples Day, which is a federal holiday.

36:40.852 --> 36:44.614
Although with the government shutdown, every day now is a federal holiday.

36:44.734 --> 36:47.295
We are on day 13 with no end in sight.

36:47.315 --> 36:50.797
A majority of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown.

36:50.857 --> 36:57.120
Republican leaders are still trying to blame Democrats for the shutdown, even though they control the House, the Senate, and the White House.

36:57.140 --> 37:03.364
It would be like Trump blaming January 6 on Joe Biden, which he actually did do yesterday.

37:04.364 --> 37:04.904
Look at this.

37:04.984 --> 37:10.568
The Biden FBI placed 274 agents into the crowd on January 6.

37:10.808 --> 37:17.191
If this is so, which it is, a lot of very good people will be owed big apologies.

37:17.332 --> 37:18.092
What a scam.

37:18.432 --> 37:29.759
Do something, President DJ D. Joe Biden planting 274 FBI agents in the crowd is diabolical, especially considering the fact he somehow did this two weeks before becoming president.

37:30.399 --> 37:36.244
For a brain-dead vegetable who couldn't even sign his own name, somehow Joe Biden was able to get a lot of stuff done.

37:36.304 --> 37:37.004
It's amazing.

37:37.425 --> 37:41.068
You know, those mass layoffs Trump has been threatening are happening.

37:41.108 --> 37:45.652
More than 4,000 federal employees were fired over the weekend, some by accident.

37:46.252 --> 37:49.235
The Department of Health and Human Services mistakenly fired.

37:49.255 --> 37:58.645
They sent home and then had to rehire hundreds of employees, including the leaders of the measles response team and the group working to contain the Ebola virus.

37:58.685 --> 38:04.551
More than half of the CDC workers fired on Friday were reinstated a few days later.

38:04.611 --> 38:07.695
And on behalf of those of us who work here at Jimmy Kimmel Live,

38:09.036 --> 38:32.612
Half of the sailors of the USS Roosevelt were fired, were dropped off at a harbor in Spain and the remaining sailors sailed off with the aircraft carrier and then had to turn around and come back because the aircraft carrier doesn't work without all those sailors.

38:33.567 --> 38:35.369
So it's just kind of a dumb story.

38:35.489 --> 38:41.875
Like this is a huge bureaucracy that can be closed for 10 days and nobody cares.

38:43.516 --> 38:51.464
It is a huge bureaucracy full of people whose job it is not to understand how insignificant they might be.

38:52.525 --> 38:54.506
And it has been that way for a long time.

38:58.070 --> 38:58.971
These people know it.

39:00.267 --> 39:04.631
The United States has been under a controlled demolition for some time already now.

39:05.471 --> 39:12.177
Almost all the wealth has been removed, our infrastructure is crumbling, and the dollar is almost worthless.

39:14.859 --> 39:22.345
And a lot of this needed that time, the five years, the six years of the pandemic.

39:23.459 --> 39:34.729
And they needed to have shitheads on the internet that were arguing about COVID and the spike and amyloidosis and whether or not it was a gain of function virus.

39:34.769 --> 39:42.756
They needed that because the real operation needed many years, the stripping of the wealth of America.

39:43.436 --> 39:49.882
Five more years of infrastructure crumble and local government embezzlement.

39:51.397 --> 40:01.541
and five more years of unregulated immigration that could be in any way distorted around the world.

40:03.362 --> 40:13.406
And in the meantime, we have a group of jesters in front of us, talk show hosts and podcast actors, and podcast actors on talk shows,

40:15.834 --> 40:26.178
that are telling us that certain things are happening and real debates are occurring and real arguments are happening and the country's roughly 50-50 split and it's not.

40:27.459 --> 40:33.201
That's an illusion that all of these people and even the nightly news is scripted to tell you.

40:33.221 --> 40:37.082
It's like 44, 46 and some undecided or something like that.

40:38.083 --> 40:43.505
When the trap is sprung, there will be virtually no one on the

40:44.648 --> 40:52.130
what should be a conservative, sort of sovereign, patriotic side of America.

40:52.490 --> 41:04.194
There will be nobody there because everybody else will have already turned against that idea that something is salvageable instead of in need of horrible correction.

41:05.202 --> 41:11.103
you know, opening the Constitution, maybe even separating into states, who knows what the plan is.

41:11.163 --> 41:13.764
The Amaro and the North American Union, I don't know.

41:14.224 --> 41:32.008
But for sure, the idea that the sovereign nation of the United States and the federal government could be reined in and trimmed back in such a way that it could still function, or maybe not, I don't know, any kind of

41:33.004 --> 41:36.726
Let's not open the Constitution argument, we'll be squashed.

41:38.988 --> 41:41.469
And the young kids are already kind of there.

41:41.529 --> 41:45.031
The young kids are already kind of there because of people like him.

41:45.831 --> 41:57.658
And that's the reason why we need this longer timeframe, because people are running in these hamster wheels, and the longer they run in the hamster wheel, the more they believe what's on the cage wall in front of them.

41:59.119 --> 42:00.240
Because that never changes.

42:02.042 --> 42:06.105
And so they run and they run and they run and they run and eventually they believe it.

42:08.167 --> 42:21.777
And so as long as we are arguing on the timescale of, you know, daily events and nightly talk show hosts and canceling or not canceling, we are arguing on the wrong timescale.

42:22.077 --> 42:26.240
And we are more importantly observing these people on the wrong timescale.

42:26.300 --> 42:31.384
And so it's very hard to see that they are just scripted actors, but if you just zoom out,

42:33.339 --> 42:36.803
And you look at a five-year timescale with regard to the pandemic.

42:36.823 --> 42:41.149
You look at a 10-year timescale with regard to the health freedom movement.

42:41.169 --> 42:49.819
You look at a 15 or 20-year timescale with regard to bioweapons and financial crimes.

42:50.911 --> 43:15.958
Now you can start to see how each of these layers of the controlled demolition of America is intertwined and built on top of one another and how it's almost impossible to see any of them and how they work together if you're fighting on the basis of social media, arguing with actors on social media, or think that somebody is gonna be a guest on a late night talk show and the truth is finally gonna get out.

43:23.614 --> 43:24.696
We've been there ourselves.

43:24.716 --> 43:25.697
Welcome back.

43:25.737 --> 43:31.584
This guy... I don't know.

43:31.604 --> 43:33.346
This is not the first time this has happened.

43:33.686 --> 43:36.189
He built his whole career saying, you're fired.

43:36.229 --> 43:37.731
He can't even do that right.

43:38.669 --> 43:47.034
And then we have our Secretary of Health and Human Services, who continues to spread medical misinformation, including this absolute beauty.

43:47.494 --> 43:55.039
This morning before I came in here, somebody showed me a TikTok video of a pregnant woman, 800 months pregnant.

43:55.279 --> 43:58.461
She is an associate professor at the Columbia Medical School.

43:59.501 --> 44:03.764
And she is saying F Trump and gobbling Tylenol

44:10.828 --> 44:12.910
The baby was in her placenta?

44:14.091 --> 44:16.092
No wonder she was gobbling Tylenol.

44:16.533 --> 44:22.838
Oh, so he's able to make fun of him getting the biology wrong.

44:26.482 --> 44:32.085
but I guess they both agree that there was a person on social media that there is a trend.

44:32.166 --> 44:32.586
I don't know.

44:32.646 --> 44:35.327
What is, what could the joke possibly be here?

44:35.868 --> 44:44.373
Remember a fraction of Americans, a very tiny fraction of Americans give a darn about what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:44.413 --> 44:44.613
says.

44:44.673 --> 44:50.097
The vast majority turn off the moment they hear Trump or him or any of these other people talk.

44:50.617 --> 44:55.340
They might not even ever hear them talk because they're not on these programs like this.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.351
And that's significant.

44:59.311 --> 45:04.654
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of NIH goes on lots of podcasts.

45:04.674 --> 45:06.154
They're on lots of podcasts.

45:06.174 --> 45:08.735
They're just not on late night talk shows.

45:08.775 --> 45:10.376
They're not on morning talk shows.

45:10.416 --> 45:25.563
They're on lots of podcasts that are on the internet and available to you on a programmed basis, served up to you by your following and your feed and your scrolling.

45:27.233 --> 45:30.837
And in the meantime, the majority of Americans are being riled up.

45:32.779 --> 45:34.200
Something is going to snap here.

45:37.304 --> 45:41.208
Just for reference, and I also noticed only the women in the audience were laughing at this.

45:43.237 --> 45:45.458
The baby does not live in the placenta.

45:46.159 --> 45:47.679
The baby lives in the uterus.

45:47.939 --> 45:53.222
But I'm glad our nation's top health official is getting his information from TikTok.

45:53.702 --> 45:58.665
In fairness to RFK, he isn't only confused about what happens beyond the vagina.

45:59.025 --> 46:01.807
He doesn't know much about the penis either.

46:02.007 --> 46:07.109
There's two studies that showed children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism.

46:08.150 --> 46:10.471
It's highly likely because they're given Tylenol.

46:11.131 --> 46:12.432
So, you know, none of this.

46:18.268 --> 46:26.353
But, you know, there's a tremendous amount of proof or evidence, I would say, as a non-doctor, but I've studied this a long time.

46:29.395 --> 46:32.037
As a non-doctor, he's studied this a long time.

46:32.937 --> 46:41.523
You know, as a non-pilot, I think planes should have windows that open so when we fly, we could get fresh air and talk to the birds and whatnot.

46:42.262 --> 46:56.655
So it's important to see that when we make statements around here, the statements we make are powerful because of how sharp they are from many different angles.

46:57.035 --> 47:08.686
And the primary one here would be how autism spectrum disorder or pandemics and gain of function have been used

47:09.605 --> 47:14.026
to be sure that virology as a science is never questioned.

47:16.266 --> 47:24.048
And it does actually go back to circumcision as a standard practice in American hospitals.

47:25.648 --> 47:38.771
It's a thing that, and in English hospitals, but it's a thing that we need to address as a nation and address it from the perspective of why it would have occurred.

47:40.473 --> 47:53.085
Why would there have been a mass movement to circumcise male children in America in an unreligious but rather public health context?

47:53.145 --> 47:54.586
How could that ever have happened?

47:55.407 --> 47:56.968
Is it true that it happened?

47:57.068 --> 47:58.430
Do you know if it's happened?

47:58.490 --> 48:01.272
Is it something that we can actually talk about?

48:01.553 --> 48:02.433
I think it should be.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.182
I think on a biological program it definitely should be.

48:06.623 --> 48:08.364
He's already gone over it.

48:08.624 --> 48:10.005
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:10.065 --> 48:20.293
has already sort of discredited questioning it because he did it in such a ridiculous manner, as ridiculous as saying vaccines cause autism.

48:20.634 --> 48:24.276
He also now wants you to believe that maybe it's circumcision in boys.

48:25.197 --> 48:42.200
gives them a vulnerability to autism with no one on any side in this theater ever talking about how ridiculous it is that this supposedly very leading progressive nation or whatever we are supposed to be beacon of hope in the world

48:43.081 --> 48:49.046
went to decades of circumcising little boys and where did all that go?

48:49.086 --> 48:51.828
Did we just cut it off and throw it in the garbage can?

48:51.888 --> 48:57.473
Is that what we were doing to make sure that the parents had an easy time keeping the penis clean?

48:57.553 --> 48:58.654
Was that the argument?

48:58.694 --> 48:59.674
Is that what we did?

49:01.816 --> 49:10.443
Or was it a national security priority where the vast majority of that foreskin was used as medical remnants in cell culture?

49:12.870 --> 49:20.155
Are hospitals still circumcising boys and then selling that tissue as medical remnants for cell culture?

49:22.057 --> 49:29.542
It's incidentally one of the few places where skin cells are so actively dividing in the infant.

49:30.623 --> 49:42.411
You know, what a great place, what a great thing to be able to do, to immediately take a large, growing cell, largely homogenous cell sample

49:44.028 --> 49:44.908
from an infant.

49:46.289 --> 50:01.556
And now, what if, for example, we were to take all the kids and all the men in America that grew up in, let's say, I don't know, the 70s, were born after 1970, and we were to just ask them, what percentage of your foreskin are you left with?

50:01.576 --> 50:03.817
And first of all, are you circumcised or not?

50:04.237 --> 50:06.378
Were you born in a public hospital or not?

50:06.778 --> 50:10.420
And then how about how much of your foreskin are you left with?

50:10.500 --> 50:13.161
Because there's, of course, all kinds of different

50:14.482 --> 50:17.284
you know, levels of circumcision possible.

50:17.424 --> 50:42.465
And if the circumcision was for the infant, then you would think that the removing of the least amount possible so that I guess the glands penis, that's the top of the penis could be, you know, exposed and cleaned, while at the same time, I would have assumed leaving the biologically functional, you know, covering that the foreskin is largely intact.

50:43.629 --> 50:46.690
That's kind of what I imagine would happen.

50:46.730 --> 50:56.153
But what if, for example, there was an entire generation of American men that if they were honest and they looked down, they would actually find out that they have no foreskin.

50:57.973 --> 51:04.556
That it was removed right from the edge, all the way around, so that there's nothing left.

51:06.076 --> 51:09.157
Because that would be a very different kind of circumcision.

51:10.370 --> 51:19.908
It would leave a very different set of scars and the penis itself would look very different because there would be no foreskin protection at any time.

51:22.389 --> 51:35.291
And so there could potentially be a very simple solution to this problem, a very simple, you know, almost like the, I don't know, the placebo vaccine thing where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:35.331 --> 51:39.792
and Mary Holland are on one side saying that they're never placebo tested.

51:39.872 --> 51:45.013
And now we have a Goldman Sachs lawyer selling a book saying that they're never placebo tested.

51:45.053 --> 51:50.554
And even Stanley Plotkin says that they're not placebo tested, but that's the stupid argument.

51:52.540 --> 51:59.542
That's the argument that, that, that claims that we know nothing about biology, so we can't have any intuition about it.

52:03.923 --> 52:06.364
And so it's just as absurd as this, right?

52:06.404 --> 52:09.305
Where they mention it in an absurd way.

52:09.405 --> 52:11.026
He makes an absurd joke.

52:11.046 --> 52:15.667
And the next thing you know, all of the real biology here is lost.

52:17.059 --> 52:25.441
The absurdity is in the fact that they can talk about it like that without saying, scratching their head and first asking, is that still happening?

52:26.701 --> 52:30.022
Because if it is, that would be an interesting thing to look at.

52:30.082 --> 52:40.905
Is it then, then I mean, think about that, but instead they just make a joke as if it doesn't matter because it's very important.

52:41.085 --> 52:46.606
It does matter because if we were doing it to girls,

52:48.396 --> 52:49.799
in any way, shape, or form.

52:49.819 --> 52:56.333
I don't need to describe anything like that, but if we were, I don't know, what if we were removing the ears of all children in America?

52:56.854 --> 52:57.516
Just one ear.

52:58.493 --> 52:59.934
you know, just one ear.

53:00.774 --> 53:18.381
And we found out that actually those ears were going to cell culture labs all around the United States and actually were responsible for a lot of the cell culture programs and cancer research programs, making them possible because we were taking these little baby's ears off

53:19.281 --> 53:25.309
while the cells in them were growing so fast and the cartilage was growing so fast.

53:25.329 --> 53:33.759
So there's such an ideal cell culture that we told a bunch of parents that, you know, it's easier to keep the ear clean if we remove the left ear.

53:33.799 --> 53:36.683
You can keep it cleaner and the left ear can really get infected.

53:40.646 --> 53:55.704
This is a crucial breaking point in the narrative right now, because again, sticking to the biology, you start to see that it is impossible that these scripted actors can be anything else but scripted actors.

53:58.206 --> 54:12.583
so deftly walking around what should have been an obvious like, wait, we're complaining about all kinds of, you know, rights for people to have their lived experience and their, their, their spectrum of gender.

54:12.643 --> 54:16.768
But these little babies, these little boys that this is just a joke.

54:20.202 --> 54:28.965
And wouldn't it be crazy if in America and England and Ireland and a few other English-speaking places, it just went on for a really long time?

54:29.405 --> 54:32.866
Wouldn't it be crazy if it was still going on in America right now?

54:32.886 --> 54:43.110
And by the way, I looked up these studies that RFK mentioned.

54:43.130 --> 54:44.731
They are shakier than his voice.

54:46.207 --> 54:52.010
These guys, they sit there, and they blather, and no one calls them out on it.

54:52.110 --> 54:56.172
Listen to Trump here talking about the amount of liquid in vaccines.

54:56.732 --> 55:00.374
It's something that's artificially, I think, induced something, whether it's

55:01.892 --> 55:09.002
the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass.

55:09.162 --> 55:11.325
I mean, we made fun of this the other day, right?

55:11.946 --> 55:16.673
And Jimmy Kimmel is scripted to make fun of it too, but it's not possible.

55:17.998 --> 55:43.728
that uh what is that that lady that sits behind him in the leather coat all the time is her name wiles or something like that are you telling me that this guy is such a an actor with 20 years of history of commercials and tv and reality shows that that he's that bad it's just it's not possible this is a dude playing a character

55:46.072 --> 55:48.274
And it makes that, that's what makes it possible.

56:00.708 --> 56:06.252
Does he really think you could pump two mason jars worth of vaccine into a six-pound infant?

56:07.033 --> 56:08.875
It'd be like a human water balloon.

56:09.975 --> 56:14.899
A dose of vaccine contains about 0.5 milliliters of liquid.

56:14.960 --> 56:18.602
Now, Guillermo, show everyone how much liquid that is.

56:18.923 --> 56:20.324
Let's get a tight shot of that.

56:20.584 --> 56:23.647
That is how much liquid is in a shot.

56:24.087 --> 56:24.968
It's 1 20th of a shot, OK?

56:28.075 --> 56:28.315
Right?

56:28.515 --> 56:29.196
Yeah, that's right.

56:29.456 --> 56:29.636
Right.

56:29.656 --> 56:38.962
So now, did that have any effect on you whatsoever?

56:39.403 --> 56:41.064
No, but I think I need another one.

56:41.744 --> 56:42.304
Funny, right?

56:42.625 --> 56:44.446
Ingestion versus injection.

56:45.246 --> 56:47.248
Why don't you get a needle out there, Guermo?

56:52.571 --> 56:53.832
The script is really bad.

56:54.372 --> 56:55.013
It's really bad.

56:57.489 --> 57:06.897
You know, it's very difficult to follow all the new information that supposedly links vaccines and circumcision to autism.

57:07.338 --> 57:11.341
But thankfully, the White House has released a new video that I hope will clear it all up.

57:11.902 --> 57:13.964
A message from the President of the United States of America.

57:14.329 --> 57:19.451
Hello everyone, this is your favorite president with an important announcement about circumcision.

57:19.931 --> 57:25.333
Some call it bris, the big snip, going sleeveless, chop suey, bababooey.

57:25.993 --> 57:33.275
I call it circumcision, and Bobby Kennedy, our smartest scientist after me, is saying circumcision is linked to autism.

57:33.935 --> 57:39.817
When I was circumcised as a baby, the doctor said, sir, sir, it's too big, it has to be circumcised.

57:39.897 --> 57:42.098
Think about how tasteless this is right now.

57:43.314 --> 57:49.139
Now, the thing that I think is most important to say right here is that that's what the flag is about.

57:49.199 --> 57:52.261
The rainbow flag with the triangle in it, that's what that's all about.

57:53.282 --> 57:58.386
And here they are talking about making a joke about the size of our president's penis.

58:02.189 --> 58:09.295
This is the heart of the Human Genome Project and the National Cancer Program.

58:12.064 --> 58:13.565
It's right at the heart of it.

58:16.166 --> 58:31.793
And potentially hundreds of thousands of children were essentially mutilated by the same system that also transfected some folk in the last five years under false pretenses.

58:33.015 --> 58:49.823
who also put together a fake health freedom movement to make sure that chronic fatigue syndrome would never really amount to any real resistance, that AIDS would effectively be something that could divide people rather than bring people together under an understanding of

58:50.624 --> 59:09.464
of what public health was being turned against us and how this prophecy, if you will, about how we were going to figure everything out once the physicists turned their focus to genetics and heredity, that we were a couple decades away from

59:09.964 --> 59:24.643
really being able to tweak everything and therefore we have to reorganize society and reorganize rules and we need the smart people to take control because we're about to have the keys to the car that is the evolution of the human species.

59:27.051 --> 59:33.176
And a lot of the people that are in front of us right now are still working under that script, working under that assumption.

59:33.196 --> 59:36.999
They just think the can has been kicked a few more years down the road.

59:37.380 --> 59:43.204
Maybe they've even be told the behind the scenes, all the, all the truths are already known, but that's all garbage.

59:47.168 --> 59:54.894
And to be making fun of circumcision in America and circumcision around the world in the Western world,

59:56.158 --> 01:00:01.666
is laughing in your face because the biology of it is very, very real.

01:00:02.607 --> 01:00:07.675
Circumcision and the fibroblasts that come from it.

01:00:09.042 --> 01:00:27.691
The cells that are taken from it and harvested from it are a source of, if not a primary source of, all of the experimentation, all of the cell lines that we are using in a lot of these labs and in a lot of these pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.

01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:29.572
This is a vital source.

01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:35.030
And the truth is out there.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:46.256
You can go see a Twib episode, and there's probably four or five clips that I've cut of Vincent Racaniello himself saying that, you know, a lot of these fibroblasts come from circumcision.

01:00:47.503 --> 01:00:55.989
just casually mentioning it, not mentioning that there might be a national security priority to get hospitals to do it.

01:00:56.029 --> 01:01:06.596
There might be a classified national security priority to feed that material to a certain, I don't know, Department of Energy subset of investigators.

01:01:06.776 --> 01:01:17.463
I have no idea, but I know for sure there is no public health justification for the years and years of circumcision of little boys in America.

01:01:19.984 --> 01:01:27.608
And he's making fun of it right now and making many of his viewers think about the penis of Donald Trump.

01:01:27.668 --> 01:01:29.569
Think about how distorted that is.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.550
That's what the flag is about.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.892
It's about your opinion of penises.

01:01:34.552 --> 01:01:37.794
Do you like yours or do you want someone else's?

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:41.075
Do you have one and like them or

01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:47.083
particularly like yours or do you not have one and really wish you did have one?

01:01:47.483 --> 01:01:48.784
That's what the flag is about.

01:01:49.424 --> 01:01:51.085
That's also what trans is about.

01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:56.507
Because I don't hear a lot of people other than talking about that.

01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:57.587
That's what that's about.

01:01:57.707 --> 01:02:00.308
It's about how you feel about penises.

01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:01.829
It's really weird.

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:11.050
You fly that flag in a school, you wear that flag as a pediatrician, you're saying that everybody can have their own opinion about penises.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:26.614
Whether you like yours, or you like other people's, or whether you believe that you were born with one but shouldn't have one, or born with one and should have one, or whether or not you like other people's better than yours, or as much, or it's just ridiculous.

01:02:28.499 --> 01:02:36.546
And yet we're playing right along because all of the actors that we see are not real people.

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:37.727
They're on a script.

01:02:38.048 --> 01:02:40.029
So nobody's looking for the answers.

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.871
Nobody's looking for the truth.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.273
Nobody makes intellectual progress.

01:02:44.353 --> 01:02:45.574
Nobody is growing.

01:02:46.475 --> 01:02:52.641
Nobody is really evolving as a person over time because they're actors.

01:02:54.855 --> 01:02:56.415
It wouldn't be fair to everyone else.

01:02:57.256 --> 01:02:59.116
So little baby me said, that's fine.

01:02:59.556 --> 01:03:00.356
Take what you want.

01:03:00.716 --> 01:03:01.777
I won't even notice.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:04.617
It's like plucking a feather from a fat goose.

01:03:05.658 --> 01:03:07.098
But it didn't hurt my brain.

01:03:07.478 --> 01:03:08.998
My sons got circumcised.

01:03:09.258 --> 01:03:09.799
Look at them.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:16.180
They didn't get the good autisms like the late great Rain Man played by Dustin Hoffman, who also played Captain Hook.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.481
Peter Pan wasn't circumcised.

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:23.442
The radical left had girls play Peter Pan on Broadway, which I was never a fan of.

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:24.842
Mary Martin.

01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:26.383
We hate Mary Martin.

01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:31.466
We love Sandy Duncan, even though she only had one eye because her mother gave her Tylenol.

01:03:32.166 --> 01:03:36.228
With that said, I am pleased to announce a brand-new trading card.

01:03:36.488 --> 01:03:40.810
Every single one has an actual piece of presidential foreskin.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.411
Trade it with your friends.

01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:44.212
Chew them like bubblegum.

01:03:44.812 --> 01:03:47.074
Just $799.

01:03:47.414 --> 01:03:51.556
Thank you for your attention to this matter and to my magnificent dong.

01:03:52.176 --> 01:04:01.001
To order your own piece of presidential penis, visit OwnTrumpsHog.com.

01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.502
That shows you where America is right now.

01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:07.364
It is a controlled demolition of American culture.

01:04:07.404 --> 01:04:15.268
And while he pretends to be part of the thinking majority on the left, it's really just all the same level of twisted

01:04:16.343 --> 01:04:25.971
perverted, distorted, contorted, and contradicting messaging that hides the truth in plain sight.

01:04:26.631 --> 01:04:35.018
That we are being changed into experimental animals, and that in fact, in a lot of ways, we have been experimental animals for some time.

01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:41.443
What the real truth is, ladies and gentlemen, what the real truth is, in my humble opinion... What time is it?

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:42.224
Game time!

01:04:43.294 --> 01:04:49.915
What the real truth is, in my humble opinion, ladies and gentlemen, is that these people are slavers and you have to see them as slavers.

01:04:51.275 --> 01:04:54.176
You try to imagine that slavery is over.

01:04:54.836 --> 01:04:57.757
You try to imagine that slavery doesn't exist anymore.

01:04:58.137 --> 01:05:00.017
And that's the biggest delusion of all.

01:05:00.877 --> 01:05:02.658
Because a slaver isn't racist.

01:05:03.418 --> 01:05:07.819
A slaver isn't... A slaver is actually very realistic.

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:09.679
It's me or you.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.761
It's you in the chains or me in the chains.

01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:18.804
It's my descendants ruling your descendants or your descendants or someone else's descendants ruling us.

01:05:20.364 --> 01:05:22.905
That's the attitude of a slaver.

01:05:25.366 --> 01:05:26.527
It's more like a dog owner.

01:05:28.908 --> 01:05:35.030
And you could be a nice dog owner or a shitty dog owner, but there's a relationship there.

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.312
And if you believe

01:05:40.222 --> 01:05:49.830
that slaving is a thing, then how it is accomplished, if it requires lying to your slave, that doesn't matter.

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.733
That's not morally somehow weird.

01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:54.414
You're a slaver.

01:05:56.736 --> 01:06:03.702
And I think one of the biggest illusions that they've cast on us is that slavery is over when in fact slavery is just being modernized.

01:06:10.606 --> 01:06:15.628
If you want to turn off the chat, you just have to double click on the screen and the chat should collapse.

01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:20.469
Thanks very much for being here, Raccoonter.

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.770
I'm sure you're a good guy.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:23.811
Lots of stuff on Twitch.

01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:30.573
This message that we have here at GigaOM Biological is for anyone, but it's not for everyone.

01:06:31.393 --> 01:06:37.495
There are lots of other messages on Twitch, lots of other games to play, so feel free to browse and come back later.

01:06:40.236 --> 01:06:46.039
If you don't know why the cheese is free on social media, you probably don't belong here.

01:06:46.719 --> 01:06:51.221
You're probably trapped in that illusion because you're not aware of what's really the truth.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.742
In about two generations, this whole opportunity will be gone.

01:06:56.023 --> 01:07:00.244
And these people that think on longer timescales, they understand that.

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:04.606
And they have one script, one cast in front of us,

01:07:05.707 --> 01:07:13.032
And as long as we fight with the people on stage or fight about what's on stage, things are going to keep happening the way they're happening.

01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:15.635
I want to make America real again.

01:07:15.695 --> 01:07:19.458
That means we've got to put a lot of different people in office.

01:07:19.558 --> 01:07:23.261
We have to put a lot of different people on our social media feeds.

01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:30.407
And we have to build our own social media websites akin to soapbox instances.

01:07:31.087 --> 01:07:47.166
like blue sky and and and donald trump's uh what is that thing called now i don't even remember um and also peer tubes and so that's what we're trying to do here at giga ohm biological um very very fun um autism spectrum disorder is a myth

01:07:48.848 --> 01:07:51.429
as are pandemics and gain of function.

01:07:51.449 --> 01:07:58.074
They are myths that are very convenient because they make it very difficult to question intramuscular injection as a methodology.

01:07:58.094 --> 01:08:04.518
They make it very difficult to question virology as a science and they make it very difficult to question

01:08:05.038 --> 01:08:23.884
public health as a reason, and they've put a lot of morons on the internet and provided them with sets and studios and staff in order to make sure that people don't figure this out and waste their time as much as possible on all kinds of stuff.

01:08:24.485 --> 01:08:33.168
And I got a few games to play tonight, or this afternoon, and I hope they'll be a little bit fun, add a little bit of stuff to the joke of this

01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:39.384
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to show our children the truth about social media.

01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:44.908
It's free because you pay with your time and your attention and your thoughts and your emotions.

01:08:45.128 --> 01:08:59.659
And you pay dearly because if you're going to contribute something to the world, to your kids, if you're going to build something together with your children and your community, you got to do it now with the free time that you have.

01:09:00.579 --> 01:09:02.160
because the time is running out.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.380
It's always been running out.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.801
Ever since you were a kid, you've been wasting your time.

01:09:06.161 --> 01:09:10.482
And America needs to focus right now or we are in very big trouble.

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:20.645
These people have been performing for quite some time and it's kind of, it's a crescendo in the theater and America is the center of it, but we're being used against the rest of the world.

01:09:20.725 --> 01:09:26.447
Not that dissimilar to how we were used against the rest of the world during COVID.

01:09:27.327 --> 01:09:29.208
The murder of real Americans.

01:09:31.018 --> 01:09:40.848
The murder of real Americans was used to represent the start of a multi-year biological event all around the world.

01:09:41.533 --> 01:10:00.963
people in Japan, people in Australia, people in New Zealand, were shown the American numbers and told that that was evidence that the lockdowns in their countries worked, that the masks worked, that Donald Trump and his administration were dropping the ball, and oh my gosh, look at the math in America.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:05.505
And all of these people are scripted actors, they've been put in place to do this,

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:09.067
And it doesn't necessarily mean that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:09.187 --> 01:10:11.709
knows all of the script.

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.932
It just means that behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:15.992 --> 01:10:19.595
are people who know enough of the script that they can keep him on it.

01:10:21.442 --> 01:10:22.903
Would you consider him a victim?

01:10:23.003 --> 01:10:23.224
No.

01:10:23.964 --> 01:10:29.209
Do I consider any actor a victim if they're on stage willingly reading the lines?

01:10:29.289 --> 01:10:29.929
No, I don't.

01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:42.881
And there's no way it's possible that he believes that he is a independent actor whose prayers have been answered because Donald Trump appointed him to HHS secretary.

01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:43.802
It's impossible.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.084
It's impossible that he believes that.

01:10:46.264 --> 01:10:47.305
Don't take Tylenol.

01:10:47.885 --> 01:10:48.525
Don't take it.

01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:50.186
With Tylenol, don't take it.

01:10:50.806 --> 01:10:51.526
Don't take it.

01:10:54.787 --> 01:10:56.287
And ask me how I know.

01:10:56.347 --> 01:10:58.008
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooley.

01:10:58.048 --> 01:11:00.088
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:11:00.608 --> 01:11:11.411
My research has been misrepresented by members of the group Panda out of South Africa and also members of the group Heart out of the UK, including Jonathan Engler.

01:11:12.692 --> 01:11:16.154
and Jessica Hockett out of Chicago, Illinois as far as I know.

01:11:16.754 --> 01:11:24.340
You can find my previous work as an academic on the National Library of Medicine's website PubMed under my last name with my first two initials JJ.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:32.706
I was also briefly a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense before I figured out that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, and

01:11:33.286 --> 01:11:53.238
Brian hooker are all frauds And I definitely know they tried to get me to be the lab leak cover-up guy But I tried to tell them that they were wrong and they ended up just publishing the book anyway And I think they kind of hoped that I would just go along with it But since I haven't the book is kind of an inconvenient problem because I'm listed as the first expert.

01:11:53.278 --> 01:11:58.561
I've also somehow or another run into jay Bhattacharya multiple times

01:11:59.696 --> 01:12:13.108
during the course of the COVID pandemic, and even been told by him three times in one weekend not to talk about Robert Malone anymore in 2024, right before he was appointed NIH director.

01:12:13.148 --> 01:12:18.213
He told me that he might likely be NIH director if Donald Trump were to get elected.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:31.192
And there he is, this guy who told me multiple times that he defers to me because I'm the biologist, multiple times said that he learned more from me about the biology of the pandemic than anybody else.

01:12:31.212 --> 01:12:40.796
He told me in person multiple times between 2022 and 2024, multiple times he's spoken to my wife.

01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:45.037
And those are not all random chance.

01:12:45.097 --> 01:12:47.378
I'm not in that book just by accident.

01:12:49.882 --> 01:12:56.633
I'm not responsible for everything that Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson and Jessica Hockett write about and say for nothing.

01:12:57.935 --> 01:13:02.558
It's because, unfortunately for them, I'm the one guy they didn't plan for at Witseed.

01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:08.661
I'm the one off-script dude that they haven't been able to get on script in six years of meddling.

01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:09.962
That's where we are.

01:13:10.022 --> 01:13:13.984
And I have Woodhouse 76, the substack, to show you.

01:13:14.404 --> 01:13:18.667
They have arguments with each other, and a lot of the ideas are derived from my work.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:23.930
And it's funny because I have phone messages from Jessica Hockett, the author of

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:25.331
Woodhouse 76.

01:13:25.671 --> 01:13:28.614
Shout out to Jessica, one of the shittiest Americans on earth.

01:13:28.994 --> 01:13:30.115
I hope you're listening to this.

01:13:30.195 --> 01:13:33.418
If you are, I'll be in Chicago in a few weeks.

01:13:33.438 --> 01:13:34.659
Hopefully we can see each other.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.901
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:50.311
I'm very excited to be here today because I'm starting to feel a momentum that I think might result in like months and months of programming because these people have just overextended themselves.

01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:51.032
They've simply

01:13:51.732 --> 01:13:58.976
Overextended themselves in a way that they are not gonna be able to pull out of anymore Whoops, I did that wrong.

01:13:59.016 --> 01:13:59.637
I want this one.

01:14:00.237 --> 01:14:12.384
There we go Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooley back on the front They're in big trouble because I don't think they ever thought they would need to sustain this for this long and what I mean by sustain it I

01:14:12.964 --> 01:14:20.166
I mean like all these people are still just going on in these corners of the internet where nobody really pays attention to them anymore.

01:14:20.546 --> 01:14:33.349
And the reason why they have to do it is because the cats that they are responsible for herding, the individual social media users that they are responsible for confusing,

01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:44.366
are vulnerable to figuring out what actually happened, because what actually happened is now available, and it wasn't supposed to be available.

01:14:46.968 --> 01:15:02.837
The truth about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and J. Bhattacharya, and Marty McCary, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Merrill Nass, and Robert Malone, and the anthrax vaccine, and bioweapons, and 9-11 were never supposed to become available.

01:15:03.561 --> 01:15:04.621
They just simply weren't.

01:15:06.782 --> 01:15:28.146
This was a carefully orchestrated, multi-decade theater that was designed to flip a shitty vaccine schedule into a new transfection-based gene investigation disguised as a vaccine program.

01:15:28.306 --> 01:15:30.386
And it failed, it failed miserably.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:39.348
It failed miserably because the campaign of worst case scenario actors was exposed largely by me.

01:15:39.849 --> 01:15:43.612
I know that sounds very crazy, but it actually seems to be true.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:51.961
The only kink in their armor is that I can explicitly

01:15:53.123 --> 01:16:11.697
to a detail, to a date, to a text, to a DM, explain and show and demonstrate that these people know the truth, but have been scripted not to say it and have accepted long before they met me the obligation to stay on script.

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:20.252
Many of them were actually scripted to come up to me and say nice things and give me their address or their phone number.

01:16:21.033 --> 01:16:29.058
To get me on a signal chat with other people that they said were trying to spread the right information and all of those were traps.

01:16:29.598 --> 01:16:31.860
Hamster wheels that wasted our time.

01:16:35.522 --> 01:16:41.706
And this was all supposed to end and everybody accepting the idea one way or another that there was a COVID.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:47.155
that there was a botched response, but that also something worked.

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:54.342
And if it wasn't for that darn DNA contamination, you know, this product would be quite spectacular.

01:16:54.382 --> 01:16:59.467
And we are still being set up for that pivot, albeit very off script.

01:17:01.567 --> 01:17:04.329
And so there's still a chance that they can make this work.

01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:12.074
There's still a chance that they can improvise this script back to where it was going to be, which is that there are problems with the previous vaccine schedule.

01:17:12.474 --> 01:17:19.619
There are problems with some of the previous vaccines on the schedule or their early administration or over administration.

01:17:20.059 --> 01:17:27.204
And those problems can all be resolved if we just slowly but surely, you know, figure it out.

01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:30.887
We get safe vaccines and some of them will probably include

01:17:31.907 --> 01:17:49.316
RNA, albeit we're going to have to figure out a way to get rid of that pesky DNA that was in there because we rushed it and we used these, you know, proven manufacturing techniques that we knew would fall short because we couldn't purify the RNA because anion exchange chromatography can't be used to do that.

01:17:51.769 --> 01:17:52.770
And so that's the trick.

01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:58.193
We have been watching a Star Trek episode, hoping that they were gonna figure it out.

01:17:58.694 --> 01:18:02.716
Hoping that if we tweeted the right thing that they would figure it out and that was never gonna happen.

01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:06.199
Boy, I don't know.

01:18:06.339 --> 01:18:09.721
Sometimes it's just, you know, I get lost in it.

01:18:09.761 --> 01:18:11.762
I can't believe it.

01:18:11.982 --> 01:18:16.686
I can't believe that it's so obvious, you know, with the timeline that if you just,

01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:28.559
show what all these people were doing, show all the podcasts that they've been on, show how little intellectual progress they made, then you can really see a national security theater.

01:18:28.599 --> 01:18:32.623
We've looked at the Barry Weiss thing, and it isn't what everybody says it is.

01:18:32.683 --> 01:18:34.385
It's much more malevolent than that.

01:18:34.525 --> 01:18:36.507
It's just governance by podcast.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:47.170
and the illusion of consensus that she is significant, or that her substack is significant, or that the purchase of it was significant.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:51.851
$100 million in today's American dollar is nothing.

01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:54.152
That's the reality of it.

01:18:55.052 --> 01:18:59.573
It buys you a nice house in three states, that's it, and a lot of headache.

01:19:02.816 --> 01:19:06.339
And so this national security theater is ongoing.

01:19:06.539 --> 01:19:23.454
And there's a small subset of Americans on social media that consider themselves conservative or have been fooled into believing that they're watching conservative social media think that it's some kind of Jewish conspiracy.

01:19:24.054 --> 01:19:28.158
And the left is, it's Jews, but it's not a conspiracy.

01:19:28.498 --> 01:19:29.819
It's all kind of the same.

01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:32.032
It's all kind of useless.

01:19:32.452 --> 01:19:39.237
It all kind of accepts the fact that Donald Trump is an independent actor, that J.D.

01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:53.486
Vance is an independent actor, that all the senators are independent actors, and it's a complex interaction between gentlemen and gentlewomen, and the press is all independent actors that are just trying to figure it out.

01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:59.270
And if they're all on a national security script, then nobody's looking for the truth.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:07.896
If they're all on a national security script, and everybody you see is on a national security script, then nobody's looking for the truth, including you.

01:20:09.837 --> 01:20:13.020
And that's why nobody ever talks about the murder and lies.

01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:15.101
That's why.

01:20:15.982 --> 01:20:28.491
That's why we have people across the board, from John Oliver all the way to Democracy Now, talking at length about Barry Weiss and her significance, when she has no significance at all.

01:20:29.861 --> 01:20:31.622
She's completely irrelevant.

01:20:32.222 --> 01:20:34.243
She's part of this show right here.

01:20:36.084 --> 01:20:46.830
Part of this show that's Jimmy Kimmel and Joe Rogan and all these people that go all the way back to the man show, have their connections with Harvey Weinstein and Tucker Carlson.

01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:49.131
It's all the same network.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:50.651
They all don't have to know.

01:20:51.072 --> 01:20:52.472
They don't all have to care.

01:20:52.893 --> 01:20:55.554
If they're all actors, none of them care.

01:20:58.436 --> 01:20:59.457
None of them care.

01:21:00.138 --> 01:21:00.878
Don't you see?

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:03.721
That's the prerequisite to being an actor.

01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:13.790
It used to be when I was a kid that you used to joke, or when I was in college, you'd joke about, I'm an actor and a singer and a dancer or a newscaster, right?

01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:15.492
That was the thing.

01:21:15.572 --> 01:21:16.893
You can do any of those things.

01:21:16.913 --> 01:21:21.517
You're a triple threat, actor, singer, dancer, triple threat.

01:21:23.039 --> 01:21:24.040
And you don't care.

01:21:24.861 --> 01:21:35.617
If the role is in a shitty movie, or in a guaranteed good movie, or a Quentin Tarantino movie, or a, you know, whatever movie, it's about getting in the business.

01:21:35.677 --> 01:21:37.159
It's about getting on film.

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.841
It's about getting your SAG card.

01:21:38.902 --> 01:21:40.985
It's about, you know, getting an agent.

01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:47.783
And almost all, if not all of these people can be considered that kind of thing.

01:21:47.823 --> 01:21:59.368
And at the very bottom, you have a whole row of people that I believe were recruited by a national security theater that was also coordinated as part of this podcast warfare.

01:22:00.902 --> 01:22:16.470
helped to populate the, you know, these real professional actors with people on a national security script with the ability to, and the knowledge and experience to, uh, improvise within that national security script.

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:29.376
And therefore the actors have an easier time reading their lines and an easier time believing that something significant is happening as a result of their work, which makes them even better actors.

01:22:39.302 --> 01:22:41.063
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:22:42.864 --> 01:22:43.584
And I have lied.

01:22:43.604 --> 01:22:44.624
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:22:44.644 --> 01:22:45.584
I don't want to lie.

01:22:46.085 --> 01:22:47.425
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:22:47.525 --> 01:22:48.566
I try not to be a liar.

01:22:48.586 --> 01:22:49.426
I don't want to be a liar.

01:22:50.006 --> 01:22:52.727
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:22:58.294 --> 01:23:08.543
And so I make the argument all the time that we've got to look at these people's track record and their lack of intellectual progress on any of the issues that they say are important.

01:23:08.623 --> 01:23:17.530
And that lack of intellectual progress is also incongruent with the idea that if you believe that, for example, aliens are kidnapping kids,

01:23:18.571 --> 01:23:46.690
Then you can't also just you know, go to a antique car show and and also I don't know be a basketball coach and also Sell Tupperware if you think that children in your community are being regularly kidnapped by aliens You can't believe those things and then act that way and with a lot of what we're dealing with right now We have people that claim to have been trying to fight an evil vaccine schedule for 25 years

01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:57.777
But that just doesn't really make any sense, because if you look at their work, and you look at their rhetoric, and you look at their sort of output, what have they done?

01:23:57.797 --> 01:23:59.157
What have they achieved?

01:23:59.858 --> 01:24:01.058
It doesn't make any sense.

01:24:01.279 --> 01:24:12.045
And then even worse, if you look at the people who are opposing them, this incompetence is, to a T, portrayed as skill.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:16.702
an inevitable sort of, I don't know, charlatanism.

01:24:17.402 --> 01:24:22.703
In other words, it is equally remarkable that somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:23.263 --> 01:24:31.525
can make zero intellectual progress in 10 years as a extremely financially successful liar.

01:24:32.185 --> 01:24:40.607
And at the same time, everybody who's opposing him or is in front of us opposing him for all of this time is unable to show

01:24:42.196 --> 01:24:43.117
that he's a liar.

01:24:43.157 --> 01:24:46.059
They just able to say that he's a liar.

01:24:47.841 --> 01:24:56.868
And so that lack of change, of progress, of discrediting, of, you know, at some point in time, right, a snake oil salesman's a snake oil salesman.

01:24:57.369 --> 01:25:06.276
The only way we can possibly be here where Paul Offit is sure for the last 12 years that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:06.336 --> 01:25:10.039
is a charlatan, that he's responsible for deaths in Samoa,

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.621
but he is health and human services secretary.

01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:19.022
The only way that narrative makes sense is as if it's a bullshit national security theater.

01:25:19.062 --> 01:25:21.043
That's otherwise that's ridiculous.

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:22.443
I'm sorry.

01:25:22.503 --> 01:25:22.944
That's it.

01:25:24.004 --> 01:25:28.225
That's the best way to see through social media and modern media.

01:25:29.385 --> 01:25:36.868
And most of the people in our democracy right now, whatever you want to call it as a hoax, it's a, it's actors.

01:25:36.908 --> 01:25:38.048
They're playing a role.

01:25:39.827 --> 01:25:41.488
And it's a national security role.

01:25:41.548 --> 01:25:43.910
It's a need to know basis role.

01:25:45.292 --> 01:25:48.374
And they've all accepted this need to know basis role.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:52.438
And it is because it's a, it's a us or them kind of thing.

01:25:52.498 --> 01:25:54.319
It's an us or them kind of offering.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.101
Either you're on the team or you're not.

01:25:56.521 --> 01:25:58.202
Pierre Corey made that choice.

01:25:58.303 --> 01:25:59.924
Peter McCullough made that choice.

01:26:00.705 --> 01:26:03.167
Mary Holland has made that choice a long time ago.

01:26:03.247 --> 01:26:05.408
Meryl Nass made that choice a long time ago.

01:26:05.889 --> 01:26:06.870
The, the,

01:26:08.615 --> 01:26:27.761
The heart of this, Brian Hooker made that choice a long time ago, because in 2013, the same year that Joe Rogan did the sci-fi specials, you know, Joe Rogan questions everything, and showed us a virologist that looked exactly like Robert Malone, Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism.

01:26:31.991 --> 01:26:33.653
That's really all you need to know.

01:26:34.173 --> 01:26:35.374
They're frauds.

01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:36.996
And this is for all the marbles.

01:26:37.036 --> 01:26:39.258
That's why there's a fraudulent health freedom movement.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.240
That's why all these people are so ridiculous.

01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:43.682
That's why social media is useless.

01:26:43.882 --> 01:26:44.603
Get off.

01:26:44.883 --> 01:26:46.925
It's just not, you're not gonna solve anything there.

01:26:46.945 --> 01:26:50.048
Here's the game.

01:26:50.148 --> 01:26:50.689
Here's the game.

01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:52.390
Let me switch down here.

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:53.091
This is the game.

01:26:53.111 --> 01:26:53.812
Ding.

01:26:59.332 --> 01:27:12.925
The game is how many subscribers on YouTube, put it in the chat, how many subscribers, you could say how many videos, you could say how long have they been on YouTube, anything like that, but how many subscribers is the game, go.

01:27:13.285 --> 01:27:20.492
I'll talk about my experience in the last 10 years of my life where I've been bouncing around from one war zone to another in very different ideological groups.

01:27:21.212 --> 01:27:38.008
and uh my experience being among these people people i never thought i could be friends with because of their political beliefs and overall i just want to give you guys a warning about something that maybe you don't know but something that will change your life if you do so i just got done watching re-watching the social dilemma on netflix it's documentary talking about

01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:43.731
The AI algorithm that controls what you're being fed on social media and your phones.

01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:44.632
How do we find out?

01:27:44.672 --> 01:27:46.373
Were you there during the Charlie Kirk shooting?

01:27:46.593 --> 01:27:47.873
No, you saw it online.

01:27:47.993 --> 01:27:52.515
Depending on your political beliefs, you are being given a certain view on that shooting.

01:27:52.655 --> 01:27:53.056
Oh, wow.

01:27:53.116 --> 01:27:54.896
Brother Spoon knows who he is.

01:27:54.976 --> 01:27:55.617
Hardcore.

01:27:55.697 --> 01:27:57.818
My son actually showed me this guy.

01:27:58.178 --> 01:28:00.139
And the shooter and his motives and all that.

01:28:00.899 --> 01:28:06.788
So we're going to get into that, but starting off, these are left-wing groups that I was with in Iraq and Syria for about two years.

01:28:07.228 --> 01:28:08.510
Did I go there because I was a left-wing?

01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:08.891
No.

01:28:09.271 --> 01:28:10.493
I'm not even in the U.S.

01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:10.794
right now.

01:28:10.834 --> 01:28:11.274
I don't vote.

01:28:11.795 --> 01:28:12.756
I'm not anything at all.

01:28:13.117 --> 01:28:13.698
I don't care.

01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:15.681
He's in the Philippines in case it matters.

01:28:17.245 --> 01:28:21.027
straight away from that stuff, but definitely wouldn't consider myself far left.

01:28:21.627 --> 01:28:27.549
Nonetheless, I spent a lot of time with these groups because they were the only ones fighting ISIS in Syria, definitely against radical Islam.

01:28:27.729 --> 01:28:31.851
Great people, people I thought I would never be friends with are our friends to this day.

01:28:32.851 --> 01:28:34.552
And then we get into Ukraine.

01:28:35.372 --> 01:28:36.633
What kind of groups do I mean in Ukraine?

01:28:36.773 --> 01:28:38.313
Jeez, all sorts.

01:28:38.734 --> 01:28:44.116
Well, I'll tell you what, you know, a lot of them are right wing conservative, you know, you see a lot of conservative values in Ukraine, but

01:28:44.892 --> 01:28:45.952
Let's look at the patch wall.

01:28:46.472 --> 01:28:47.293
Yes, YPG.

01:28:47.453 --> 01:28:51.374
Nobody's making any guesses on how many subscribers this guy has.

01:28:52.194 --> 01:28:54.035
Brother Spoon already disqualified.

01:28:54.055 --> 01:28:54.895
Aw, man.

01:28:55.755 --> 01:28:56.756
He spoiled it now.

01:28:56.876 --> 01:28:57.216
Darn it.

01:28:57.276 --> 01:28:58.576
That was supposed to be a game.

01:28:58.756 --> 01:29:00.757
That is the group that I was with in the YPG, the unit.

01:29:01.477 --> 01:29:03.137
But we also have a police patch from Ukraine.

01:29:03.658 --> 01:29:04.518
A SWAT team patch.

01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:07.959
These are people that I trained when I was working at TDI in Ukraine.

01:29:08.659 --> 01:29:10.180
As well as my old unit.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.781
My old unit had a mortar team in it that were anarchist.

01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:14.541
Antifa.

01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:16.999
They were in my unit in Ukraine.

01:29:17.139 --> 01:29:22.763
Now, I would like to remind you, first of all, not to forget that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:35.592
said during his campaign announcement for president, campaign for president, he said it multiple times, that one of his sons went over to Ukraine and worked as a machine gunner.

01:29:36.513 --> 01:29:38.855
Specifically said a machine gunner.

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:48.388
So I guess he used a machine gun and shot at Russians in Ukraine, just like this guy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:48.468 --> 01:29:49.349
told you that.

01:29:50.325 --> 01:29:53.266
When he started running for president, do not forget that.

01:29:53.406 --> 01:29:54.606
I was actually surprised.

01:29:54.646 --> 01:30:05.908
The first time I learned that was actually in Boston, in the audience, next to Mark Kulak, and who I think is basically a sellout, John Bodwin.

01:30:06.348 --> 01:30:10.569
And right behind us, one row back, was Meryl Nass and Abby Rockefeller.

01:30:11.129 --> 01:30:18.671
Meryl Nass and Abby Rockefeller had had John Bodwin over to their hotel room or their house for fricking breakfast.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:37.746
John Boedemann just casually mentioned that when he sat down next to us as if he's not like, he could be dumb, he could not know, but he's on Steve Kirsch's team, he's on Kevin McKernan's team, and there's no way that he can't know that Steve Kirsch is a fraud.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:42.009
There's no way that he can't know that Kevin McKernan is a scripted agent from

01:30:42.569 --> 01:30:52.810
the Human Genome Project and the Department of Energy and probably DITRA and certainly on the same team as Robert Malone who's got to be one of the biggest fraudulence Americans on this whole show!

01:30:56.431 --> 01:31:13.726
And so what I want you to see is that this guy with 1.38 million followers has orders of magnitude more people following him that aren't subscribed to him but see his stuff and YouTube is promoting him.

01:31:14.426 --> 01:31:18.349
There are hundreds of probably thousands of people like this.

01:31:19.198 --> 01:31:19.839
Is he real?

01:31:20.139 --> 01:31:20.500
I don't know.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:27.548
You watch some of his videos about his 10 year career as a foreign fighter and decide for yourself.

01:31:27.628 --> 01:31:34.176
It's an awful lot of footage for a guy who says that he went to be a foreign fighter but also is a YouTuber.

01:31:34.216 --> 01:31:37.120
So did he become a foreign fighter YouTuber?

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.602
Like is that his career?

01:31:40.101 --> 01:31:40.582
I don't know.

01:31:40.602 --> 01:31:42.583
I don't want to make any judgments.

01:31:43.144 --> 01:31:53.552
Just listen to his description, his horribly adolescent, if not childish description of what happens on social media.

01:31:53.652 --> 01:31:54.473
It's an algorithm.

01:31:54.993 --> 01:31:55.974
It's a program.

01:31:56.655 --> 01:31:58.636
It's, it's out of our control.

01:31:58.656 --> 01:32:03.020
It has nothing to do with actors on a script.

01:32:04.355 --> 01:32:08.900
in fighting alongside the police and the SWAT team of Ukraine.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:09.620
Can you believe it?

01:32:10.261 --> 01:32:13.224
Fighting one true evil, which was the Russian invader.

01:32:14.385 --> 01:32:15.086
What can I say about this?

01:32:15.939 --> 01:32:18.560
Well, you're going to meet a lot of people in this line of work as a foreign fighter.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.080
I've met a lot of different types of people.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:25.201
The funniest people that I've ever met were in these Lithuanian groups.

01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:26.962
Incredibly funny.

01:32:27.102 --> 01:32:28.742
And they give you everything.

01:32:28.862 --> 01:32:30.022
They'll get the shirt off their back.

01:32:30.222 --> 01:32:30.943
They will give it to you.

01:32:31.303 --> 01:32:32.163
That's how giving they are.

01:32:32.423 --> 01:32:33.943
Those are the types of people that are in those groups.

01:32:34.163 --> 01:32:38.064
And then we talk about the Ukraine side, the most courageous fighters you will ever find.

01:32:38.084 --> 01:32:39.305
Much more courageous than myself.

01:32:39.525 --> 01:32:40.045
That's Ukraine.

01:32:40.445 --> 01:32:41.065
Quite conservative.

01:32:41.725 --> 01:33:01.336
All things considered so I'm starting with that not only to give you guys a basis of what I know You know that this is a lesser-known fact about for fighting is the friendships you make along the way not sorts of fighting and all that It's it's the people that you never thought you could get along with You get along with and you become great friends with and you trust with your life and they trust you no matter your ideology I didn't go there.

01:33:01.597 --> 01:33:05.619
I didn't go to any of these because of an ideological reason I went there because there's an evil in the world.

01:33:06.019 --> 01:33:08.921
I think that goes for a lot of foreign fighters, but um look

01:33:09.741 --> 01:33:10.362
I don't even know.

01:33:10.422 --> 01:33:11.524
Does that make any sense?

01:33:11.584 --> 01:33:14.889
I didn't go to these places for any ideological reason.

01:33:14.929 --> 01:33:17.072
I went there because there's an evil in the world.

01:33:17.132 --> 01:33:17.794
Like, wow.

01:33:19.273 --> 01:33:22.095
I don't, it's, this is remarkable.

01:33:22.155 --> 01:33:27.518
It's hard to imagine that this is a real guy, but he could be just a real crazy guy.

01:33:27.538 --> 01:33:28.038
I don't know.

01:33:28.658 --> 01:33:31.500
The bigger thing that I want to talk about here is the shooter.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.462
You see a 22 year old dude, grew up in a middle high income family.

01:33:35.722 --> 01:33:36.762
He was politically motivated.

01:33:36.782 --> 01:33:38.123
I think it's pretty obvious at this point.

01:33:38.704 --> 01:33:39.984
He was, he seemed to be left-wing.

01:33:40.144 --> 01:33:46.628
He was a pretty normal kid, it seems like, but he fell into the wrong hands of falling into political extremism.

01:33:47.389 --> 01:34:00.099
And I want to say, you know, as myself, as a foreign fighter, I found in my hardest moments in life, the extreme groups, the groups that were militant, they were the ones who welcomed me with open arms.

01:34:00.399 --> 01:34:03.141
And I think that is one of the big reasons that that shooter did what he did.

01:34:03.462 --> 01:34:06.044
Why did he fall into this very, you know, I think we can all agree.

01:34:06.064 --> 01:34:11.167
And so now remember, okay, this guy accepts the Ukraine war, the Syrian war, something else.

01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:15.010
He says he's been there firsthand, seen it all, been there, done that.

01:34:16.088 --> 01:34:23.696
And now he's telling you that the shooter of Charlie Kirk and he understands him and he understands what happens in these extreme groups.

01:34:23.756 --> 01:34:24.797
It's pretty remarkable.

01:34:25.437 --> 01:34:33.605
Remember, this guy has orders of magnitude more reach on YouTube than any of the people that we've been chasing for the last five years.

01:34:33.705 --> 01:34:37.229
And in fact, it's a remarkable amount of reach for a guy who joined in 2021.

01:34:38.670 --> 01:34:40.951
extreme view on politics.

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:46.592
Well, he seemed to be kind of a... Sorry, 2011, because this is his son, apparently.

01:34:46.652 --> 01:34:48.072
I don't know exactly what this is.

01:34:48.572 --> 01:34:51.413
Guy Kitt, he seemed to be, you know, a recluse.

01:34:52.053 --> 01:35:00.315
Well, he found his connection, he found his group from people who have open arms saying, you join us, you're going to be so powerful, we're going to raise you up, we're going to pump you up.

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:03.095
And that's what these groups do, you know, for right and wrong.

01:35:03.255 --> 01:35:06.776
And I think that's what the shooter found in those communities was they'll bring him in.

01:35:08.004 --> 01:35:35.399
like a lot of other people and that brings me into my uh the second thing that i want to say a little warning to all of us we are divided i i don't know if you guys know how social media works how data collection works i know very much because of OPSEC because of communication warfare in ukraine in syria and iraq they track our gps facebook snapchat instagram they they track it um many many different apps every app they try and collect as much information as possible they know how long

01:35:35.859 --> 01:35:39.601
You're looking at a thumbnail, how long it takes for you to scroll on Instagram.

01:35:39.702 --> 01:35:41.002
They know what gender you are from it.

01:35:41.223 --> 01:35:48.627
Uber is going to know that on this day, at this time, you're probably going to go and ride to go and see your parents, you know, and they know what time you're going to go to church.

01:35:48.707 --> 01:35:50.789
They know all these different things about you.

01:35:50.809 --> 01:35:51.809
Now, what's it tell you?

01:35:53.510 --> 01:36:01.996
It tells you that there are people that are all at all different stages of the hamster wheel, and none of them are anywhere near getting out of the cave.

01:36:03.641 --> 01:36:06.763
Because they're just realizing that the data is being collected.

01:36:06.783 --> 01:36:10.445
They're not being told why it would be collected or what could be done with it.

01:36:10.826 --> 01:36:14.068
And they're certainly not being told that it's largely irrelevant.

01:36:16.989 --> 01:36:19.951
I mean, if they can target ads to you, who cares?

01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:23.133
If they know how long you look at a website, who cares?

01:36:25.515 --> 01:36:31.819
They're establishing the electronic infrastructure necessary to collect your medical data on a real time basis.

01:36:34.019 --> 01:36:36.660
They don't give a shit about apps.

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:44.324
They don't care about your videos or your content or your streaming content.

01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:45.804
That's not what they care about.

01:36:45.844 --> 01:36:49.806
They care about building an infrastructure that's fast enough and seamless enough

01:36:51.857 --> 01:36:54.618
to harvest as much medical data as possible.

01:36:54.798 --> 01:37:10.102
And then when the infrastructure has been built, the social pivot can be made in a number of ways with either currency or universal income or incentives in other fashion.

01:37:12.233 --> 01:37:23.057
But it's remarkable to me how many people think that we're building all of this internet infrastructure and data centers for videos and for streaming.

01:37:24.578 --> 01:37:40.364
We're building it so that we can attempt, attempt for the first time ever to connect the genetic data, the large population of Americans with their epic database

01:37:41.337 --> 01:37:42.077
medical data.

01:37:43.538 --> 01:37:59.963
And that is probably a real-time experiment right now happening behind the scenes in DITRA somewhere or some DITRA subcontractor who has a significant amount of genetic data harvested from the participating American universities that were

01:38:00.983 --> 01:38:28.974
had agreed to and sold their remnants to all of the PCR testing that they did over the course of the pandemic to these third parties who are now granted, let's say, de-identified access to the Epic database that they can then use AI to attempt to tie in the genetic data and signals that they have harvested to the genetic, to the medical data of those college kids.

01:38:29.935 --> 01:38:39.039
And so it's kind of like, you know, an iteration of teaching AI how to solve chess and then using AI to solve Go.

01:38:39.519 --> 01:38:44.081
Well, they're not going to be able to crack the human genome by just sequencing everybody.

01:38:44.121 --> 01:38:47.022
That's not, you have to think about it as the problem.

01:38:47.062 --> 01:38:58.147
And the problem is very complex because you need to sequence everybody and store that data in a common format that's accessible enough across the data set to be fed

01:38:58.807 --> 01:39:10.634
usefully into a machine learning algorithm over and over again that will eventually take over its direct access to the data as it solves the problem for patterns.

01:39:12.535 --> 01:39:24.922
Joshua Lederberg understood this, that we would need supercomputers that would include super data centers that would be able to hope to share and store the data and make it accessible to anybody to use it.

01:39:28.567 --> 01:39:46.232
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, they will spare no expense here in putting thousands of guys like this out there with all different flavors and all different spins that are all naive to why they're there or why they've risen or why their channel is so popular.

01:39:46.392 --> 01:39:47.572
That's all how it works.

01:39:49.096 --> 01:40:01.223
If Pierre Kory never really realized that he was set up for to be a fool until he got on stage with Dave Farina and Dan Wilson, well, then, you know, that's just how the theater works.

01:40:01.283 --> 01:40:02.924
And there's going to be some casualties.

01:40:03.444 --> 01:40:05.045
There's going to be some ego pain.

01:40:08.387 --> 01:40:10.989
Because none of them were supposed to be on stage this long.

01:40:12.096 --> 01:40:15.299
We were also already supposed to have moved on to guys like this.

01:40:15.399 --> 01:40:16.040
So here we go.

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.942
Next one, ladies and gentlemen, how many subscribers?

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:31.502
Last winter, a series of duels took place in an icy field in the no-man's land of the Russian-Ukrainian War.

01:40:31.842 --> 01:40:35.363
The backdrop was both stark and, for Ukrainians, appropriate.

01:40:35.743 --> 01:40:43.705
A field that would in summertime have been filled with bright yellow sunflowers was marked only by the dark, dry stalks jetting through the white snow.

01:40:44.065 --> 01:40:52.207
The duels on the Kursk section of the front took place not between soldier and soldier in the sense... So the interesting thing that I find here is that, um,

01:40:53.127 --> 01:41:13.217
There's a wide range of videos even on the largest platforms including the Wall Street Journal that are talking about drone warfare in the Ukraine right now at the same time where the best drone equipment in the market is going to become commercially unsellable in America.

01:41:13.817 --> 01:41:14.677
How convenient.

01:41:15.398 --> 01:41:17.659
So in other words, DJI

01:41:19.003 --> 01:41:35.330
The company that makes the best drones, the best GPS guided drones, the best camera drones, the best thermal drones, the ones that are used commercially in the United States for a wide variety of applications including mapping and commercial 3D mapping and all this stuff.

01:41:36.491 --> 01:41:38.692
These drones are going to become illegal.

01:41:39.412 --> 01:41:44.775
At the end of this year just because the trump administration I guess is just going to let them become illegal.

01:41:44.815 --> 01:42:05.748
They're not going to be usable In america anymore now, that means that you won't be able to sell them over here at the same time We've been being told for the last six months or so that ukraine is basically winning because they're using drones And the drones are being made by the hundreds and then being used as you know

01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:09.572
first-person view guided missiles.

01:42:10.092 --> 01:42:24.783
Instead of having to blanket a field with artillery, you can just carry an artillery shell with a drone directly to the tank you want to hit and crash the camera into the tank at precisely the place you want it to hit.

01:42:25.163 --> 01:42:27.105
And apparently they're all doing it over there.

01:42:27.705 --> 01:42:38.477
And there's all these people that are sending drones and they're rigging them all up and they have drone building factories and it could very well be real.

01:42:40.079 --> 01:42:45.225
But I find it very curious because my son and I, over the last few months, have been getting into this

01:42:50.205 --> 01:43:06.112
this FPV thing because I was a long time sorry I'm holding my hand up here I was turning off that alarm I've been a RC helicopter pilot and if you're familiar at all with RC helicopters you know that it takes a certain kind of person to

01:43:07.032 --> 01:43:27.934
endure that that level of of pain because an RC helicopter is basically an accident waiting to happen and it's a very relatively expensive and a great deal of meticulous work afterward and so the whole concept of RC helicopters attracts a certain kind of

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:29.696
I don't know, person.

01:43:29.756 --> 01:43:36.400
And you got to have a certain derangement syndrome that involves a lot of liking to tinker, but also hating to tinker.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.242
It's like that, you know, thing where you get really mad and you want to smash something.

01:43:40.282 --> 01:43:47.266
That happens all the time in a helicopter repair session, at least in my experience.

01:43:47.306 --> 01:43:56.352
And so only recently have helicopters become this thing where electronically and sort of size wise, they become manageable.

01:43:57.172 --> 01:43:59.433
But I've been into them for a very, very long time.

01:43:59.493 --> 01:44:04.696
And so this has been kind of a renewed interest of mine because of my son.

01:44:04.796 --> 01:44:22.384
And then to see this kind of narrative being portrayed on social media and nobody putting the connection together, that they're just going to take the availability of the largest consumer market in the world away

01:44:23.527 --> 01:44:47.833
from dji to make sure that all of these are shipped exclusively to ukraine i guess all of the fpv cameras that would be sold in america to um you know people that want to do this as a hobby they're not going to be available anymore but they're using them over in ukraine to blow up russians so it's an interesting thing because i thought china was supposed to be on

01:44:48.453 --> 01:44:49.594
the Russians team.

01:44:49.714 --> 01:45:04.481
So if the Ukrainians are using DGI drones and the Trump administration says that they can't be used in America because their proprietary software could be spy software and China won't let us see their software.

01:45:04.821 --> 01:45:06.642
So that means it's spy software.

01:45:06.682 --> 01:45:16.167
So we can't let them use it, but they're using it in Ukraine and Ukraine is apparently being allowed to use them by China.

01:45:17.182 --> 01:45:23.028
In fact, you can even find videos where the Ukrainians say that they call China and China thinks that they're Russian.

01:45:23.488 --> 01:45:26.772
And so they start explaining to the Russians how to avoid the drones.

01:45:28.033 --> 01:45:39.905
It's a remarkable show they're putting on right now because involved in it are YouTubers with 1.2 million subscribers and some kind of

01:45:41.454 --> 01:45:47.218
This guy's not a real dude.

01:45:47.859 --> 01:45:54.463
He's an actor who's been recruited to read on a YouTube channel and gets paid to read on a YouTube channel.

01:45:55.924 --> 01:45:57.205
That's what YouTube is.

01:45:57.866 --> 01:45:59.387
That's what social media is.

01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:08.155
And it's militarized in a wide variety of ways, but one of the ways that no one will acknowledge is it's militarized by actors.

01:46:08.336 --> 01:46:20.604
Actors on late night shows, actors on podcasts, and these podcasts represent little tiny microcosms of the warfare that's being waged on us.

01:46:23.089 --> 01:46:23.850
What time is it?

01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:25.031
Oh gee, it's 48.

01:46:25.431 --> 01:46:26.732
Ah, my goodness.

01:46:26.752 --> 01:46:31.176
That wasn't really the best way for me to have gone through that part.

01:46:33.177 --> 01:46:34.639
What do I have coming up here?

01:46:34.659 --> 01:46:39.262
I can't stress enough how this is just so true.

01:46:41.166 --> 01:46:44.067
We are really at a stage where it's right in front of us.

01:46:44.287 --> 01:46:55.589
And most important here is that in two generations, meaning after my kids have kids, the diversity that's currently present on the planet is not going to be there anymore.

01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:57.409
And they know that.

01:46:58.870 --> 01:47:00.150
I think they actually know that.

01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:06.071
I think they really got a lot of what they wanted already from COVID and from the university students that we left out to dry.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:17.208
I think one of the ways that we could start to break this bad biology 101 would be to reconnect with those university students that we left out to dry, those high school students we left out to dry.

01:47:17.688 --> 01:47:27.115
Show them that these national security actors are present on social media, are responsible for the Trump administration, but also responsible for the Biden administration.

01:47:27.516 --> 01:47:28.997
It is one malevolent show

01:47:29.477 --> 01:47:38.651
that is motivated by the inversion of our sovereignty as American citizens to experimental animal to serve the Human Genome Project priorities.

01:47:41.135 --> 01:47:52.279
If you want to help and you want to get off social media, one way to do it would be to download the PeerTube app on your phone and then you can have my work and that of Mark Kulak's right now on the same PeerTube.

01:47:53.040 --> 01:48:01.323
You can have it on your phone with no user data, no other random stuff being served to you, no ads, nothing.

01:48:01.783 --> 01:48:04.805
Chief Wuhan says that PeerTube is the antidote.

01:48:05.365 --> 01:48:09.006
I would just suggest to you that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:48:09.026 --> 01:48:10.747
Transfection of healthy humans is a crime.

01:48:11.247 --> 01:48:17.110
Biology is really the way out because RNA cannot pandemic and autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:25.274
You just have to kind of first start here instead of wherever they want you to start and you will be fine because they can't get here.

01:48:26.107 --> 01:48:28.149
They have to stay far far away from here.

01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:34.373
This is outside of their caves.

01:48:34.814 --> 01:48:37.736
It's kind of comical how many more slides are in this deck.

01:48:38.817 --> 01:48:42.560
So rest assured I'll be on tomorrow, but maybe even on later today.

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:45.462
I can't make any promises because my son is getting a new radio.

01:48:46.342 --> 01:48:49.785
And the sunshine is out and I haven't flown in a couple days.

01:48:49.825 --> 01:48:51.006
So we're probably going to go to the gym.

01:48:51.767 --> 01:48:53.428
And then we're going to do a flying session.

01:48:53.849 --> 01:48:57.192
And then I will make preparations for a morning show tomorrow.

01:48:57.232 --> 01:48:59.474
Hopefully 10-10 or 11-11.

01:48:59.814 --> 01:49:00.535
Thanks for being here.

01:49:00.555 --> 01:49:01.876
See you again soon.

01:49:37.808 --> 01:49:38.148
Yeah.

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.744
which we quickly got rid of.

01:50:23.946 --> 01:50:31.017
But now we've got the DNA, foreign DNA, that is protected by these lipid nanoparticles, so it can go straight to our body cells where it can potentially do damage.
