00:08.171 --> 00:11.376
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:12.478 --> 00:13.199
Stop lying!

00:45.503 --> 00:45.565
you

01:26.124 --> 01:27.865
Hold on ladies, there's a knot in the chain.

01:27.905 --> 01:32.729
Let me fix it real quick.

01:33.209 --> 01:33.990
Hold on guys.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.130
My dummy.

01:36.051 --> 01:38.573
I'm so dumb I forgot to put the shoulder straps on.

01:38.693 --> 01:40.354
Hold on.

01:41.675 --> 01:43.736
Hold on guys.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.139
Your shoulder straps, they're right behind you.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.341
You gotta pull them on down.

01:53.707 --> 01:54.367
Hold on, guys.

01:54.888 --> 01:55.648
It's showing empty.

01:55.848 --> 01:56.909
I think I know what's wrong.

01:57.529 --> 01:58.550
It ain't got no gas in it.

01:58.630 --> 01:59.450
Hold on.

02:00.191 --> 02:06.254
Something wrong with the thingamadoodle.

02:06.274 --> 02:08.195
Let me check it out real quick.

02:08.215 --> 02:12.617
Something's wrong with your seatbelt.

02:12.657 --> 02:14.538
I gotta come check it.

02:14.598 --> 02:20.802
Check the safety manual.

02:21.162 --> 02:21.422
Hold on.

02:21.482 --> 02:22.643
I got that manual over here.

02:26.852 --> 02:29.553
Hold on ladies, number one thing, I forgot the shoulder straps.

02:29.613 --> 02:33.735
Let me get it.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.837
I forgot to put the shoulder straps on.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.038
Let me get them real quick.

02:41.239 --> 02:42.119
I forgot something.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.059
I know what it is.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.480
I forgot the gravy.

02:44.540 --> 02:44.980
Hold on.

02:45.741 --> 02:51.183
Hold on guys, there's something wrong with the medulla abundata.

02:51.223 --> 02:52.084
Let me check real quick.

02:55.831 --> 02:59.432
Hold on, I gotta see what's wrong with the skin of my ring.

02:59.472 --> 02:59.952
Hold on.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.072
Let me check it out.

03:01.612 --> 03:08.613
Uh-oh, lady.

03:08.973 --> 03:09.814
Something's wrong, lady.

03:09.834 --> 03:10.914
Something's wrong with the chain.

03:10.954 --> 03:16.575
Gotta check it.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.435
My boss always told me, never forget that.

03:19.515 --> 03:21.876
But I'm always forgetting the shoulder straps.

03:21.916 --> 03:22.576
Number one tip.

03:22.636 --> 03:22.996
Hold on.

04:26.324 --> 04:27.064
Yeah.

05:14.166 --> 05:18.048
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:19.875 --> 05:20.576
And I have lied.

05:20.596 --> 05:21.638
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:21.658 --> 05:22.599
I don't want to lie.

05:22.619 --> 05:24.442
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

05:24.542 --> 05:25.584
I try not to be a liar.

05:25.604 --> 05:26.525
I don't want to be a liar.

05:26.565 --> 05:30.271
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

05:30.952 --> 05:32.074
I know many of our donors.

05:32.755 --> 05:34.738
Her donors took massive tax write offs.

05:35.238 --> 05:41.221
A lot of my write-off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.903
And she'll always allow it because the people that give her all this money, they want it.

05:45.523 --> 05:45.984
That's why.

05:46.464 --> 05:49.745
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.

05:50.206 --> 05:52.327
Hillary Clinton, and it's extremely complex,

05:52.887 --> 06:01.152
Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.

06:01.232 --> 06:05.674
But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.

06:06.255 --> 06:08.536
It's very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.

06:08.896 --> 06:12.859
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.

06:13.319 --> 06:20.463
I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett, and so did George Soros, and so did many of the other people that

06:44.044 --> 06:45.004
There are no ethics.

06:45.044 --> 06:47.766
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

06:49.067 --> 06:54.111
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

08:14.155 --> 08:18.419
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

08:18.459 --> 08:24.084
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

08:25.965 --> 08:30.109
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

08:31.470 --> 08:34.192
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

08:34.232 --> 08:35.854
But that's what we're in right now.

09:12.730 --> 09:16.992
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

09:17.032 --> 09:22.615
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

09:24.536 --> 09:28.678
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.740
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.401
But that's what we're in right now.

09:36.673 --> 09:42.682
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong.

09:43.504 --> 09:46.128
All that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

10:26.360 --> 10:48.323
testing one two test test one two testing one two download the peer tube app ladies and gentlemen it works like a charm um you got to find the little the little input window where you where you should put in your your stream to appear to platform search other platforms and then when you add enter in some words and it can't find it

You can put in the URL.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.423
They'll offer you another button.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.489
Then you click on that one and put in stream.gigaom.bio.

10:55.990 --> 10:59.376
And Bob's your uncle, ladies and gentlemen, and Bob is your uncle.

10:59.416 --> 11:00.799
Welcome to the independent bright web.

11:01.544 --> 11:03.125
We're trying to make America real again.

11:03.165 --> 11:21.230
We're trying to make the world of the internet real again by being real people on the internet, supported by real people on the internet and not sponsors and corporations and military industrial complexes acting through third party proxies.

11:22.151 --> 11:25.612
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the show.

11:25.672 --> 11:26.932
We have to fight.

11:26.972 --> 11:29.653
We don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

11:30.171 --> 11:31.792
We want everybody to feel good.

11:31.812 --> 11:34.193
That's not the way life is.

11:38.835 --> 11:41.296
I always think that there's two types of players.

11:41.356 --> 11:44.258
Players who love to win and players who hate to lose.

11:44.298 --> 11:44.878
Which one are you?

11:46.419 --> 11:46.839
I'm neither.

11:48.618 --> 11:49.098
Meaning?

11:49.919 --> 11:55.442
Meaning that, you know, I play to figure things out.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.923
I play to learn something, right?

11:57.943 --> 12:08.809
Because I think if you play with a fear of failure or you play with the will to win or that supersedes a fear of failure, I think it's a weakness either way.

12:09.918 --> 12:10.118
Right?

12:10.298 --> 12:16.799
Because if you play with the fear of failing, you'll have the pressure on yourself to play, you know, to capitulate to that fear.

12:16.879 --> 12:21.100
If you play with the sense of, I want to win, I want to win, then you have the fear of what happens if you don't.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.701
But if you find common ground in the middle, in the center, then it doesn't matter.

12:25.741 --> 12:27.681
You're not phased by either, right?

12:27.721 --> 12:33.143
And that enables you to really just stay in the moment, stay connected to it, and not feel anything other than what's in front of you.

12:33.223 --> 12:35.383
So, you know, I try to just be dead center.

12:36.011 --> 12:39.315
So a lot of people in general are afraid of failure.

12:39.355 --> 12:44.961
How did you become one of those people who doesn't seem to be afraid of failing?

12:44.981 --> 12:47.604
It doesn't exist.

12:47.724 --> 12:48.826
It's not existent.

12:48.846 --> 12:49.907
What the hell does that mean?

12:50.928 --> 12:52.450
Seriously, what does failure mean?

12:52.550 --> 12:54.972
It's not, it doesn't, it doesn't exist.

12:55.493 --> 12:56.995
It's a figment of your imagination.

12:58.052 --> 12:58.652
What does it mean?

12:58.672 --> 13:00.233
You're pulling a Jedi mind trick on me right now.

13:00.253 --> 13:00.573
I'm serious.

13:00.593 --> 13:01.014
Does it exist?

13:01.074 --> 13:02.995
I'm serious.

13:03.255 --> 13:08.358
I'm trying to think, how can I explain it?

13:08.378 --> 13:09.538
Let's use happy endings.

13:10.239 --> 13:13.260
Then we can relate this to failure, why it's not existing.

13:14.081 --> 13:15.982
Everybody talks about, everybody wants a happy ending.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.223
Now let's go to the reality of it.

13:18.243 --> 13:19.444
Let's look at a fairy tale story.

13:19.464 --> 13:20.344
Let's look at Snow White.

13:21.064 --> 13:22.065
She gets a happy ending.

13:22.085 --> 13:23.266
She finds Prince or whatever.

13:23.286 --> 13:23.826
She goes on.

13:23.866 --> 13:24.987
She lives happily ever after.

13:25.907 --> 13:26.848
I call bullshit on that.

13:28.246 --> 13:33.808
Two months later, the fact is, they had an argument, and he's sleeping on the couch.

13:34.208 --> 13:37.970
So the point is, the story continues.

13:38.670 --> 13:39.471
The story continues.

13:39.531 --> 13:46.493
So if you fail on Monday, the only way it's a failure on Monday is if you decide to not progress from that.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.035
So to me, that's why failure is non-existent.

13:50.896 --> 13:56.163
Because if I fail today, OK, I'm going to learn something from that failure, and I'm going to try again on Tuesday.

13:56.243 --> 13:58.226
And I fail, and I'm going to try again on Wednesday.

13:58.266 --> 14:01.911
So it doesn't exist.

14:03.069 --> 14:03.449
You know what?

14:04.150 --> 14:05.371
Should my ratings go in the tank?

14:05.451 --> 14:07.333
That's exactly what I'm going to say to the bosses.

14:07.353 --> 14:08.214
Hey, it doesn't exist.

14:08.294 --> 14:08.995
Yeah, but you know what?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.556
We should try it again on Thursday.

14:10.576 --> 14:15.481
If your ratings go in the tank, which they won't, but if they did, you had learned a valuable lesson.

14:15.501 --> 14:19.345
You had learned a bunch of ways of how not to make a show that sucks.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.489
So then the next one would be better than the last one, right?

14:23.914 --> 14:34.641
So are you telling me then, let's just say all the career statistics that you've compiled, they all still exist, still play for the Lakers, still, and all of that still happens.

14:35.121 --> 14:40.545
If you finished your career without a championship, you would not have looked at that as a failure.

14:41.485 --> 14:47.369
No, I wouldn't look at it as being extremely disappointed because I had a dream and I had goals that I wanted to accomplish, right?

14:47.847 --> 14:50.149
And if I don't accomplish those goals, I have to ask myself why.

14:51.010 --> 15:06.944
So from my position, the reason why I would not have accomplished those things is poor leadership, failure to communicate properly with my teammates to put them in positions to be successful, lack of preparation.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.407
All those things would be reasons why I don't win.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.466
If that was the case, and in my career, I have to sit and I have to analyze that.

15:15.546 --> 15:24.696
And then as I move and I evolve, you know, post-basketball into business or whatever, those same weaknesses are going to reveal themselves there, right?

15:25.057 --> 15:28.621
So if I don't learn from that, I'm going to struggle here too, right?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.423
So I can take those situations.

15:30.883 --> 15:36.646
and learn from those and have them, you know, make me a better person later in life.

15:36.686 --> 15:47.691
But if I don't take that stuff and apply that someplace else, then that is, that's failing, which to me is the worst possible thing you could ever have is to stop and to not learn.

16:06.055 --> 16:07.376
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

16:07.436 --> 16:09.818
Welcome to the show where RNA cannot pandemic.

16:09.858 --> 16:12.621
Transpection is a crime and autism is a myth.

16:13.541 --> 16:20.227
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga Home Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:20.287 --> 16:24.470
I'm coming to you live out of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:24.971 --> 16:28.053
The title of the show today is Between Two Phages.

16:29.395 --> 16:34.499
We need to get ourselves off of social media so that we can set the proper example for our kids.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.183
And we need to have the right arguments.

16:38.483 --> 16:43.828
So I really want to start with those right arguments every night, every afternoon.

16:43.888 --> 16:48.512
Whenever I do a show, I'm going to try to remind you that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

16:49.433 --> 16:53.655
It's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

16:54.115 --> 16:56.196
Virology is never questioned as a science.

16:56.636 --> 16:59.097
And public health is never questioned as a reason.

16:59.497 --> 17:03.558
They've done the same thing with the theater around pandemics and gain of function.

17:04.059 --> 17:08.160
And if we don't realize that this is all garbage, we're going to be in big trouble.

17:08.200 --> 17:13.202
More importantly, our kids aren't going to be able to see through this myth the next time it's brought forward.

17:13.602 --> 17:20.149
We need to explain why the cheese is free on social media, why the phones are free from our phone companies.

17:20.610 --> 17:29.999
We need to start explaining this stuff and I think one of the ways to break people out of the spell is to teach them the biology that all these people are ignoring.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.781
And that's what we're trying to do here at Gigaohm Biological.

17:33.821 --> 17:35.462
I'm really happy you could join me today.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.243
Welcome to Monday's show.

17:38.623 --> 17:41.164
We are going to try to do a full week this week.

17:41.344 --> 17:44.685
I don't really know how well that will go, to tell you the truth.

17:44.825 --> 17:45.366
I don't know.

17:46.146 --> 17:47.286
But I'm definitely going to try.

17:47.306 --> 17:48.927
I know there's a lot of material out there.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.067
Whoops, bad transition.

17:51.048 --> 17:52.268
I know there's a lot to do.

17:53.028 --> 17:56.610
It's really just a question of how to spend our time as wisely as possible.

17:57.611 --> 18:01.458
I can tell you that we have to show our children the truth about social media.

18:01.979 --> 18:09.112
We need to show them that social media, when they put enough actors on it, is simply a weaponized theater.

18:10.557 --> 18:15.958
And America especially needs to stay focused on this, like that eagle is staying focused.

18:16.919 --> 18:25.441
If we don't stay focused on the biology in America and try to get our kids off of social media, we will continue to take their bait.

18:25.621 --> 18:30.342
And if we continue to take their bait, loving our neighbors will be virtually impossible.

18:30.982 --> 18:32.423
That's what I think is happening here.

18:32.463 --> 18:39.370
This fifth generation warfare that I speak of is not just on the quote-unquote right.

18:39.450 --> 18:52.081
It's not just these wacky organizations and these wacky little movements that I have here that were big enough to get a logo or big enough to get a little coverage on social media.

18:52.141 --> 18:52.722
No, no, no.

18:53.122 --> 18:54.964
It's much more malevolent than that.

18:55.824 --> 19:00.248
What we are dealing with is a fake health freedom trap.

19:00.708 --> 19:07.274
And it is a trap that people who voted for Donald Trump, people that thought Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:07.314 --> 19:18.303
might be a good guy, or Peter McCullough might be a good guy, they fell for something much bigger than just Peter McCullough, much bigger than Donald Trump, or much bigger than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:18.343 --> 19:23.388
And in fact, all of the people who've fallen into the health freedom movement trap

19:24.068 --> 19:29.090
would be happy to look in the mirror and say, well, I don't believe in all of the people in the health freedom movement.

19:29.350 --> 19:33.451
Obviously, some of the people in the health freedom movement aren't to be trusted.

19:33.871 --> 19:39.773
You know, even the least of which, you know, most people can admit that Alex Jones is a bit of a hothead.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.674
But that's the point, ladies and gentlemen.

19:42.774 --> 19:43.894
That is the point.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.815
The health freedom movement was always a trap.

19:46.915 --> 19:49.075
It was always a trap.

19:49.236 --> 19:50.396
And that's the crazy part.

19:51.016 --> 19:54.557
Ladies and gentlemen, as a trap, hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

19:54.597 --> 19:58.838
This is Giga on Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

20:00.539 --> 20:06.660
The fact of the matter is, if it was always a trap, then they never had anything to offer us.

20:06.740 --> 20:19.664
Then the whole idea of vaccines cause autism, the whole idea that adjuvants can do things, the idea that there's a chronic, you know, disease epidemic in children, and they have an answer for it, or they have the explanation,

20:20.125 --> 20:22.089
has always been a trap.

20:22.991 --> 20:28.945
And now you need to expand your time horizon a little bit and try to think why.

20:30.154 --> 20:32.495
Why would they have put this trap there?

20:32.595 --> 20:38.418
Why would they have spent so much time and energy setting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:38.498 --> 20:46.222
up for where he is now, setting Donald Trump up for where he is now, putting all these people in place so that the pandemic would go as it did?

20:46.762 --> 20:48.483
Why would they have done that?

20:48.543 --> 20:52.245
And what are they gonna gain from it for 10 years or for 20 years?

20:52.705 --> 20:57.047
If you think of it like a military operation with a longer time horizon,

20:57.527 --> 21:19.817
and a longer expectation of outcome control, then you can start to see where we might be and why all these people that purport to be saving us from something are just rehashing a nonsense limited spectrum debate about a system that's largely controlled by blackmail.

21:21.155 --> 21:33.119
Can you imagine the scenario where somebody told you that that aircraft carrier and everything that happens on it is controlled by a combination of blackmail, drugs, and people with guns to their head?

21:35.994 --> 21:55.526
Can you imagine somebody trying to explain the workings of an aircraft carrier over a 24-hour period as being largely governed by people with guns to their heads, people that are being blackmailed by pictures and videos of them, and people that are willing to do it because they're either getting paid or they get drugs for free.

21:55.887 --> 22:02.651
Can you imagine a scenario where we would try to explain the workings of an aircraft carrier like that?

22:02.691 --> 22:03.672
Because right now,

22:04.452 --> 22:10.278
Social media has convinced us that our governments all around the world operate exactly like that.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.022
And that is absolutely absurd.

22:15.803 --> 22:24.071
And we've come to believe that because over the last six years, we have assumed... Ah, darn.

22:24.671 --> 22:26.833
Just past the memory point.

22:26.893 --> 22:27.374
There we go.

22:28.951 --> 22:39.755
We have assumed that we can tweet or Facebook post or signal chat our way to changing the script of the Star Trek episode we're watching.

22:40.916 --> 22:43.537
You know, where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:43.637 --> 22:47.038
and Donald Trump are on stage and they're running the spaceship?

22:48.179 --> 22:53.841
Where Laura Loomer's over there in the corner yelling and screaming and then the rest of the cast reacts to her?

22:57.150 --> 23:09.218
And we feel a part of it because somebody tweets something that seems to be related to us, or we get a few thumbs up, or we got a DM message with a smiley face from Peter McCullough on Instagram.

23:09.238 --> 23:11.840
So, oh my gosh, I feel so important.

23:14.762 --> 23:21.306
Social media has completely bamboozled us into believing we mean anything, have any contact with anyone.

23:21.326 --> 23:23.628
We have never been more alone in our lives.

23:25.768 --> 23:35.393
And the illusion of the urgency, the illusion of the mystery and the intrigue has all been created for us.

23:37.434 --> 23:49.421
And because we have participated in this choose your own adventure that's based on our phones, it's much more engaging than any even theater movie could be, even with the most gripping special effects.

23:51.142 --> 23:54.484
Because it appears as though we're interacting with it, but we're not.

23:55.612 --> 24:00.718
These people are on internet, on the social media specifically, to create that illusion.

24:01.559 --> 24:16.416
And if we don't see through it as adults and start to show our kids how it can be used against them, then the kids will grow up believing that social media is a pretty good substitute for a global town square where everybody gets equal spa- whatever.

24:21.314 --> 24:25.238
And so we are making an effort right now to break that mold.

24:26.039 --> 24:27.981
I'm going to swing over to the other side here.

24:28.721 --> 24:32.465
We are trying to make a break from this mold.

24:33.506 --> 24:39.271
And breaking from that mold means trying to build our own decentralized, federated,

24:40.012 --> 24:40.853
social media.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.376
That means that I'm paying for my own server.

24:43.436 --> 24:53.286
That means that I have a good friend that helps me maintain it and update it and make sure that it's running how it should be run, that the storage is paid for, that we have enough of that.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.468
And I'm learning along the way.

24:56.476 --> 25:03.180
but it's not something that if I can do it, that means a lot of people can do it because there's a lot more clever people on the internet than me.

25:03.200 --> 25:13.365
A lot more people that have built a lot more websites and put a lot of tech together and have even maybe maintained their own GitHub for some other app or some other program.

25:13.385 --> 25:16.227
And so all of those people are a potential energy source.

25:16.980 --> 25:31.529
that could be used to create thousands and thousands of more instances of PeerTube with thousands of different subjects, or historians, or analysts, or journalists, or teachers that could produce output for free.

25:32.129 --> 25:39.633
Sorry, don't produce output for free, but distribute it for free in a way that is safe, in a way that is private, or even better, anonymous.

25:40.754 --> 25:43.456
Because this is also part of the word games that they're playing.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.417
Do you want a private network?

25:46.650 --> 25:50.691
where there is identity and there is information, it's just protected?

25:51.171 --> 25:53.071
Or do you want an anonymous network?

25:53.531 --> 26:04.773
Because that's one of the things that our children are being actively targeted to not understand right now, is the idea that there are different ways for the internet to be free.

26:04.833 --> 26:13.155
And they want you to believe that eventually that the only way the internet can be free is if everybody's ID is on the internet, that we all know who everybody is.

26:14.295 --> 26:15.857
That's one form of freedom.

26:16.518 --> 26:27.311
The other form of freedom would be an anonymous town square, an anonymous bulletin board, somewhere where crazy ideas could be put up and people could talk about them and it wouldn't be offensive or wouldn't be scary.

26:27.371 --> 26:28.673
It's just the way things are.

26:29.986 --> 26:31.486
Yes, there are gray areas.

26:31.526 --> 26:33.047
Yes, there are things we have to do there.

26:33.087 --> 26:35.688
But keep in mind that this is the game they're playing.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.628
I'm not saying I've got an easy answer for it.

26:38.088 --> 26:40.869
I'm just telling you that they are gonna play a game.

26:41.009 --> 26:45.190
And the main game is that they want you to believe that there's a coin.

26:46.151 --> 26:50.252
And if you accept the coin, then the coin has two sides and it's also got an edge.

26:51.852 --> 26:54.473
And most of these myths are kind of like that.

26:55.678 --> 26:58.701
Nobody argues about whether there is even a coin.

26:58.741 --> 27:00.923
They accept the existence of the coin.

27:00.963 --> 27:02.745
They accept both sides of the coin.

27:03.125 --> 27:05.067
And they even accept that the edge is there.

27:06.868 --> 27:14.875
And you will see a lot of this stuff that we're dealing with, lab leak or natural virus, Republican or Democrat, it's all kind of the same thing.

27:16.077 --> 27:20.741
And the thinner the coin is, the more effective it is.

27:23.001 --> 27:24.482
And so this is for all the marbles.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.003
This is for the children of earth.

27:26.463 --> 27:30.105
This is for our children's minds and for their sovereignty.

27:30.165 --> 27:38.631
And so it is without a doubt, I am sure, without a doubt, I am putting, and my whole family is risking everything to try and spread this word.

27:39.611 --> 27:41.792
I said it to my wife on the dog walk today.

27:41.812 --> 27:42.713
I know

27:44.815 --> 27:46.216
that I can't save the world.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.038
I know that I can't even save the United States.

27:49.238 --> 27:51.520
I know that I can't even save Pittsburgh.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.782
But I do know I can save as many people as possible.

27:56.903 --> 28:11.373
And I know most importantly, I can help to try and set my kids generation up with the knowledge necessary to understand how all the adults around them got us here.

28:12.486 --> 28:13.807
because that's gonna be the trick.

28:14.347 --> 28:23.992
The trick, in my humble opinion, is going to, for us to be able to navigate to a point in the future where the kids can respect and trust us again.

28:25.669 --> 28:35.253
And the trouble is, is that even if we go full capitulation and say that, yeah, sorry, we kind of fell for Trump and for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:35.273 --> 28:46.718
and for these other people, it won't be enough for our kids to forgive where we ended up because we won't have the clarity of mind to explain to them why it's more complicated than that.

28:47.858 --> 28:54.581
But it is of utmost importance to understand that you and I and everybody didn't fall for just one person.

28:56.124 --> 28:58.385
We didn't fall for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:58.445 --> 29:20.536
We fell for Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Brian Hooker and Robert Malone and for all of these people that collectively seemed to represent a semi-coherent alternative set of ideas that was, by design, very easy to see, was more nuanced than what was on TV.

29:22.830 --> 29:28.295
And so we were trapped from the very beginning in 2020 by a very simple coin.

29:29.176 --> 29:31.779
You accept what's on TV or you don't.

29:34.201 --> 29:41.348
And so that coin was also very deceptive, but they used that on us for almost two years.

29:41.408 --> 29:44.350
Either you accept what's on TV, natural virus, or you don't.

29:44.410 --> 29:45.271
They're covering it up.

29:45.351 --> 29:45.952
It's a lab leak.

29:49.284 --> 29:50.705
And I fell for that coin.

29:50.785 --> 29:56.289
I believed wholeheartedly in that coin and I argued for flipping it over and over and over again.

29:59.411 --> 30:02.453
And it's been done to us over and over and over again.

30:02.493 --> 30:07.496
We keep getting played by these people who accept the existence of all of these coins and they're not real.

30:07.696 --> 30:08.897
There is no coin.

30:09.478 --> 30:11.199
That is the trick to understand.

30:11.239 --> 30:12.740
There is no coin.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.441
It's just murder and lies.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.242
There is no coin.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.844
It's just actors on podcasts.

30:20.526 --> 30:21.346
and then you can see it.

30:23.768 --> 30:29.651
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is indeed a dumb idea from the 1800s and we are going to read books about it.

30:30.471 --> 30:34.153
Mark already has them uploaded to his website.

30:35.314 --> 30:42.698
They very, very obviously lay out a case for the idea that intramuscular injection by hypodermic needle

30:45.123 --> 30:50.630
became widely used before anybody understood enough of our biology to know how silly it was.

30:50.830 --> 31:02.425
And we got all the way here because it's so silly, because it's so variable, unreliable, because it is so ridiculous.

31:04.980 --> 31:07.081
Transfection of healthy humans was a crime.

31:07.141 --> 31:31.327
And today that's one of the focuses of the show because again, remember the way that they avoid actually saying anything of report for you and your family is to never tell you that it was, and always has been old technology that has been recycled in a semantic sort of way by calling them gene therapies and all, you know, this technology that had never been widely used before.

31:32.819 --> 31:41.128
which everybody, everybody says has not been widely used before, and they're still saying it, but the problem is that's wrong.

31:43.291 --> 31:50.879
It has been widely used for 20 years on every academic bench in almost every biological discipline on earth.

31:51.823 --> 32:04.898
We have been transfecting cell cultures and plants and animals and you name it for decades, ever since the production of DNA and RNA and lipofectamine has been around.

32:04.918 --> 32:07.021
Lipofectamine is a product.

32:07.725 --> 32:20.796
that uses lipid nanoparticles produced in your own laboratory with centrifuges to transfect things, to make lipid nanoparticles loaded with DNA or RNA.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.759
This is a long, long, long ago.

32:25.231 --> 32:27.233
widely distributed technology.

32:27.293 --> 32:48.091
So when you have a health freedom movement composed of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Merrill Nass, and Mary Holland, and Brian Hooker, a 16-year genetics dude for the Department of Energy before he became an anti-vaxxer that didn't use the word autism in 2013 because he didn't like it, he didn't think it was an honest word.

32:49.732 --> 32:50.673
These are the people

32:52.108 --> 33:10.679
who have brought us all the way to 2025 without bothering to tell you that this is an old technology that, you know, people like Brian Hooker were using on his bench when he used to be a laboratory scientist for the Department of Energy for 16 years, transforming and transfecting plants for them to produce proteins for medicine.

33:14.850 --> 33:21.855
And so RNA cannot pandemic is a great phrase to use with somebody that thinks they're well-versed in biology.

33:22.315 --> 33:29.520
First challenge them to explain the wonderful discovery of DNA and why it's so important in evolution.

33:29.560 --> 33:39.607
And then ask them, how is it that RNA can pandemic if it has none of the chemical characteristics that DNA does that you just explained to me are so vital

33:40.387 --> 33:48.874
to its underpinnings of the process of evolution, then how in the hell could RNA accomplish anything like endemicity?

33:50.275 --> 33:51.055
Stop lying!

33:52.676 --> 33:56.119
And so autism is a meaningless word by design.

33:56.139 --> 33:58.981
Of course, anybody with autism will take offense to that.

33:59.081 --> 34:02.144
Anybody who knows anybody with autism will take offense to that.

34:02.684 --> 34:08.949
And quite frankly, I would suggest that that's kind of tough shit because a lot of these things are going to be hard for people to hear.

34:10.365 --> 34:12.507
And autism is a myth.

34:12.747 --> 34:34.383
Anybody that has autism and can talk to you about it already should understand that these kids that were featured by Wakefield, these kids that have gut dysbiosis and bang their head against the wall and have projectile diarrhea for several months or years of their lives are a more complicated case of something else

34:35.103 --> 34:36.283
than autism is.

34:36.403 --> 34:41.444
Nobody is complaining about getting a vaccine-injured kid that can count cards.

34:42.305 --> 34:50.846
Nobody's complaining about a vaccine-injured kid that just happens to be able to play the piano like Mozart, but can't talk or make eye contact.

34:51.427 --> 34:56.528
That's what I mean by autism is a meaningless word by design.

34:56.588 --> 34:57.928
You see, that's the point.

35:02.850 --> 35:07.391
And so again, I'm still going to beat this dead horse because it's vital to teach our children.

35:07.451 --> 35:10.352
And if you haven't heard me say it, I got to say it almost every day.

35:10.912 --> 35:13.873
These people are getting away with it because they're not talking about 2020.

35:14.273 --> 35:22.335
They're not talking about 2021, what they were doing and what bandanas they were wearing or whether or not their dogs were in a bubble suit.

35:22.755 --> 35:26.676
They want to talk about how the COVID shots are bad because that's part of this.

35:27.895 --> 35:36.861
The one thing that none of the people on the left or the right seem to be able to see is that PCR has become a gold standard and it never should have, could have, is.

35:38.141 --> 35:38.942
It can't be.

35:40.423 --> 35:53.371
PCR requires painstaking controls and repetitions in order to be used on the academic bench to prove the existence of anything or the presence of something.

35:53.411 --> 35:55.452
And it needs to be corroborated by other data.

35:58.630 --> 36:21.702
And in medical diagnostics since 2020, we have by consensus on both sides, including all the crazy people on Trump's team, started to use PCR to scan and diagnose for up to 18 viral signals at the same time in patients across the nation and around the world.

36:21.862 --> 36:26.665
And that by scientific definition is nonsense.

36:28.099 --> 36:35.920
None of those tests contain the necessary controls or replicate and triplicate to make any statements about anything.

36:38.058 --> 36:46.446
Never mind the idea that where are these signals in the background every day and all the other people that don't go into the hospital or the doctor and take a test.

36:46.866 --> 37:03.181
They don't know, they don't care because these tests are being used disingenuously to distort the idea, to erase the idea that there is indeed an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals on which a single primer,

37:04.062 --> 37:09.027
pair plus probe could easily be nonspecific.

37:10.869 --> 37:16.474
And so they need to make a bigger case for PCR as a diagnostic than yeah, it just works.

37:16.534 --> 37:24.281
I mean, there's a whole nother regulatory agency to be established just to regulate PCR diagnostics.

37:24.782 --> 37:27.504
They have become so ubiquitously used for nothing.

37:27.544 --> 37:28.045
They're dumb.

37:30.029 --> 37:40.281
And they're being used as if they are a hammer and a nail or, you know, a Torx wrench or a, or a Allen keys, you know, like really fine WeHa tools.

37:40.382 --> 37:41.142
No, they're not.

37:42.184 --> 37:43.125
They're not at all.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.010
I don't know if that's a good tool thing or not.

37:47.050 --> 37:48.051
Just the one that came to mind.

37:51.843 --> 37:55.064
And so this is perhaps the most heartbreaking part.

37:55.944 --> 38:01.325
Anyone, anyone, anyone on either side, nobody will talk about this.

38:01.445 --> 38:19.028
This right here, which you can see in this 2001 graph of the population pyramid with men on this side and females on that side with ages going up, is a population pyramid wherein built in is this large families after World War II,

38:21.192 --> 38:36.743
And when these people move from being very wealthy, tax-paying individuals with high salaries and good jobs and five houses, good for me, when they start pulling out of the system,

38:37.708 --> 38:50.939
when they stop paying taxes, when they start pulling out of the system, all kinds of weights and all kinds of gear ratios are gonna change inside of our complex mechanism, our socioeconomic system.

38:52.060 --> 38:57.365
And they have seen these gear changes coming for a very long time.

38:58.464 --> 39:10.368
And in fact, I am arguing that they have been putting people in place, narratives and ideas in place in mainstream media and in movies so that they would have the necessary ideas in mind.

39:10.388 --> 39:13.129
You know, like depopulation and that kind of stuff.

39:13.589 --> 39:16.670
So that people would never realize that actually behind

39:18.024 --> 39:34.664
behind this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was the results of a successful campaign which convinced people like my brother not to have any kids, which convinced a lot of people not to have more than two, maybe only have one.

39:35.512 --> 39:42.795
And so instead of being a population pyramid that would have spread out down over here like this, the population pyramid is already sharp here.

39:43.156 --> 39:50.179
We already have a potential collapse coming because a healthy population pyramid is like a pyramid.

39:51.212 --> 40:04.318
And in fact, you can see that this same anticipated rise in all cause mortality was simply unavailable to be misconstrued as spread in most countries in Africa and in places like that.

40:04.378 --> 40:05.878
So they couldn't really do it.

40:05.998 --> 40:15.723
Even India was missing this bump here at the top, which could have at least provided a brief signal that they could have misconstrued as COVID, but in America,

40:16.656 --> 40:25.222
in the UK, in Scotland, in Australia, in Japan, they had this signal in spades.

40:26.522 --> 40:27.403
So they pointed to it.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.582
And so they anticipated more people to come to the hospital.

40:33.622 --> 40:36.464
They anticipated more people to get pneumonia.

40:36.484 --> 40:39.146
They anticipated more people to need antibiotics.

40:39.226 --> 40:44.249
And so timed very well with this anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

40:44.990 --> 40:55.617
Tony Fauci said in 2017 that there definitely will be something in the next few years because we've seen it coming since around 1990 when Jonathan Couey was graduating from high school.

40:55.657 --> 40:57.078
Yeah, we've seen it coming.

40:57.098 --> 40:57.538
There it is.

40:57.658 --> 40:58.358
Oh my gosh.

40:58.399 --> 41:00.540
Look at those bars growing at the top there.

41:01.541 --> 41:07.608
It'd be a shame if we had to spare no expense in saving all of those people's lives, keeping them alive as long as possible.

41:07.648 --> 41:11.392
Hell, we might not even have enough hospital beds to do that.

41:16.798 --> 41:19.902
And so an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality

41:21.704 --> 41:30.187
was sculpted using murder and lies, manslaughter and lies, just lies that caused other people to kill people without knowing it or die without knowing it.

41:31.548 --> 41:32.909
Pitch it however you want to.

41:34.769 --> 41:36.450
This guy was part of fooling us.

41:37.751 --> 41:40.952
This guy remains actively part of fooling us.

41:41.032 --> 41:48.335
He is a scripted national security actor because we are being run by a false two-party theater.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.029
And I think my friend Mark is right.

41:52.150 --> 42:01.957
Even if you think that this is just a one party theater, you still believe that there's some super overarching authority that's controlling everything and you stand no chance.

42:04.119 --> 42:06.601
Maybe you think it's the bankers or something like that.

42:06.661 --> 42:08.622
This is not going to get us out.

42:09.585 --> 42:12.287
Because that means that nobody stands up.

42:12.347 --> 42:14.469
That means nobody takes responsibility.

42:14.509 --> 42:16.791
That means nobody takes action.

42:16.831 --> 42:18.553
And we need people to take action.

42:19.353 --> 42:21.235
And I don't mean take up arms.

42:21.415 --> 42:22.816
I mean take up action.

42:22.896 --> 42:24.678
Teach our children the truth.

42:25.799 --> 42:27.360
Teach our teachers the truth.

42:28.802 --> 42:30.243
Teach our neighbors the truth.

42:32.967 --> 42:39.913
And so anybody that has risen into clear view on both sides and clear view is trademarked here because I'm trying to make money off of it, although I don't know how.

42:41.274 --> 42:44.537
Our need to know basis scripted actors, obviously I'm joking here.

42:45.057 --> 42:46.338
This Trump shooting was fake.

42:46.358 --> 42:48.881
The only question is how much did Trump know beforehand?

42:49.261 --> 42:56.347
The only question is when they tell America that this is likely true, what will happen to America?

42:58.157 --> 43:07.036
What will happen to America if we end up getting into an argument about how much did Trump know about the staged shooting?

43:10.677 --> 43:18.465
What would happen to America if we found out that the second shooter that was somewhere on his golf course was staged and they never even addressed Butler PA again?

43:19.045 --> 43:23.710
What would happen to America if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:23.770 --> 43:29.135
was demonstrated definitively to be a scripted fraud who doesn't know what he's talking about?

43:32.213 --> 43:34.274
What would happen to the American public?

43:34.294 --> 43:42.937
What would happen to America in general, American communities, if Donald Trump was 100% discredited?

43:46.564 --> 44:02.658
Because that is potentially where we're going with Tulsi Gabbard at Director of National Intelligence, with Jay Bhattacharya at NIH, with these guys at FDA, with this Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:02.998 --> 44:03.819
at HHS.

44:03.859 --> 44:04.860
We are in big trouble.

44:04.900 --> 44:06.141
And it's very, very simple.

44:06.441 --> 44:07.021
It really is.

44:08.291 --> 44:14.594
There was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that you can even see in this short timescale graph.

44:15.074 --> 44:23.439
Much easier to see in the graphs that people like Denny Rancourt have been purporting to explain for the last five years, but lying about it.

44:24.219 --> 44:25.640
It's very, very simple.

44:26.140 --> 44:35.305
If you look at it from the all-cause mortality perspective, not only is there an anticipated rise visible, but you can see that pneumonia is what we lost control of.

44:36.260 --> 44:44.183
And we could lose control of pneumonia by just telling people that there's a such thing as a viral pneumonia for which antibiotics are inappropriate.

44:45.343 --> 44:57.587
That a low oxygen from this $5 Amazon device could be a sign that you have COVID and maybe a good way to supplement that would be with oxygen.

44:58.931 --> 45:23.247
One of the things that, of course, is in so many of these medical files, but so many of these people don't seem to point it out, including people like Scott Shara, including people like Pierre Corey, who pushed supplementary oxygen in the beginning of 2020, like Kyle Seidel in New York City, who was pushing supplementary oxygen up to 60 liters a minute.

45:24.448 --> 45:31.575
These are deadly concentrations of pure oxygen that would lead definitively to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

45:31.596 --> 45:37.041
The term comes from the toxic use of oxygen in the intensive care unit.

45:37.161 --> 45:39.484
It's in the textbooks.

45:41.815 --> 45:51.240
And this omission by everyone on all sides is equivalent to the omission by everyone of all sides on the scrutiny for the PCR.

45:51.700 --> 46:07.309
It's the same as the admission on both sides, the omission on both sides that transfection is an old technology, but both sides seem to be convinced that it's a new thing, a new gene therapy that is or isn't good or isn't it or isn't worth investing in.

46:08.770 --> 46:11.071
And now you can see what the coin does.

46:12.915 --> 46:19.421
And all of these coins have been handed to us and flipped over and over by these people on stage, and there is no coin.

46:19.501 --> 46:21.422
None of these people are flipping a coin.

46:21.923 --> 46:24.085
None of these people are winning coin tosses.

46:24.345 --> 46:25.706
It is a theater.

46:29.529 --> 46:33.273
And Casey's also shared some pretty concerning takes on vaccines.

46:33.593 --> 46:36.736
Like when she appeared with her brother on Joe Rogan's podcast and said this.

46:37.540 --> 46:41.802
It's like with vaccines, it's like, yeah, I bet that one vaccine probably isn't causing autism.

46:41.942 --> 46:46.083
But what about the 20 that they're getting before 18 months?

46:46.103 --> 46:48.344
Like, we don't look at it in synergistic, you know?

46:48.864 --> 46:50.445
And so that's a big problem.

46:50.925 --> 46:51.745
Yeah, that's not great.

46:51.885 --> 47:04.330
In fact, I will go so far as to say that that is the most obviously horseshit thing Casey Means has said since claiming that that smoothie was, mm, really good on the Meat Juice Farm cast hosted by what appears to be Pinterest's final boss.

47:06.394 --> 47:08.512
That feels really dangerous.

47:12.628 --> 47:15.410
And so I will make the point one more time, right?

47:15.450 --> 47:21.195
There's a very distinct goal with their method.

47:21.475 --> 47:24.738
And there is a very distinct effect of their script.

47:24.798 --> 47:30.823
And it's taken me five years of hard work to really feel as though we're getting close to seeing through it.

47:30.883 --> 47:38.909
Understanding how they've used the autism spectrum against us is very similar to how they use the gender spectrum against us.

47:38.970 --> 47:40.571
It's just, who's the target?

47:42.441 --> 47:57.104
And I think as easy as it is for us to dismiss the gender spectrum as kind of a bunch of nonsense, it was easy for the left to dismiss the idea that vaccines cause autism.

47:59.167 --> 48:19.935
And even if both of those dismissals are a bit short through the corner or a bit too simple to be intelligent, it is the enticing nature of their simplicity that made them very easy to fall for, especially because there are people on the internet and on mainstream media that are scripted to agree that these are

48:20.845 --> 48:23.567
the formulations of the questions that matter most.

48:23.667 --> 48:27.649
Instead of, for example, intramuscular injection maybe is the problem.

48:28.010 --> 48:36.575
Instead, we talk about vaccines, which is one of the most aspecific, inaccurate, broad terms in use today.

48:38.736 --> 48:42.418
It's a bit like a word like vehicle or tool.

48:43.764 --> 48:46.705
And it means very little unless you're very specific.

48:46.925 --> 48:50.287
And so if I say I have a tool in my hand, what do you know?

48:50.427 --> 48:51.107
Not very much.

48:51.167 --> 48:54.509
If I say I'm going to give you a vaccine, what do you know?

48:54.609 --> 48:55.329
Not very much.

48:55.389 --> 48:59.991
And that's by design because intramuscular injection is just dumb.

49:00.051 --> 49:01.752
It has no basis in biology.

49:02.574 --> 49:20.107
but it does have a basis in the inability of somebody who has been intramuscularly injected with a combination of substances to realize what has been done as a result, what has happened as a result, and how to connect them temporally because the effects tend to be smeared out.

49:22.869 --> 49:30.996
It's the best place to inject something into someone that you don't want to know

49:32.540 --> 49:33.540
the side effects of.

49:34.561 --> 49:47.226
Let's say, for example, you wanted to inject your kid with a truth-telling serum, but you didn't want him to know that it had any effect.

49:49.107 --> 49:54.269
The truth-telling serum might actually burn in the skin where there's lots of nerves.

49:54.989 --> 50:01.714
The truth-telling serum might taste like citrus and urine if you squirted it in the mouth.

50:02.175 --> 50:07.059
It might smell like urine if it was, you know, if you could smell it or spilled it.

50:07.419 --> 50:10.301
But if you inject it into their arm, it doesn't sting.

50:11.262 --> 50:12.543
They don't smell anything.

50:12.923 --> 50:23.572
And by the time they get sick from what you injected, they won't necessarily know what it's from and you'll already be talking to them and they'll already be telling you the truth about how they feel and about where they were last night.

50:26.952 --> 50:29.933
It's really about intramuscular injection being dumb.

50:29.993 --> 50:45.580
If you understand why that inconvenient truth might require Tony Fauci and Paul Offit and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Brian Hooker and all these people to be there while they got their act together.

50:47.661 --> 50:55.224
While they were able to organize a sort of mythology in a theater that would get us to give up our sovereignty willingly.

50:58.519 --> 51:05.306
I make light of it when I say that your children are trapped in a national security theater and cartoon chickens, but it's true.

51:07.268 --> 51:16.377
You can think of it like the ball in Indiana Jones coming running down the ramp of the cave, but it's not funny.

51:17.018 --> 51:18.079
That's what they did to us.

51:18.119 --> 51:22.263
You can think of it as the guy on that ride in the beginning of the show.

51:24.099 --> 51:34.048
By going on social media and saying it might be a lab leak, this might be a bioweapon, that's the same thing as saying, oh man, my boss always tells me to put those shoulder straps on, hold on one second.

51:36.391 --> 51:39.954
And so don't think for one second that that's not what was going on.

51:40.074 --> 51:44.118
Just the same, they're taking advantage of the fact there was two sides of a coin.

51:44.158 --> 51:47.121
Either you believe what's on TV or you don't.

51:50.091 --> 51:52.894
Either you think it's a lab leak or you don't.

51:53.395 --> 51:55.237
It's a natural virus.

51:55.737 --> 52:00.062
The coin doesn't exist, but once you start running, that's all you've got.

52:00.222 --> 52:02.345
It's really, really awful.

52:04.887 --> 52:06.408
So I do think this is vital.

52:06.468 --> 52:08.209
I do think these slides are vital.

52:08.269 --> 52:11.611
I do think that the way to fight this is to be able to say it succinctly.

52:12.432 --> 52:15.274
They are hiding that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea.

52:15.334 --> 52:20.197
They are hiding that virology is nothing but transfection and transformation in cell culture.

52:20.777 --> 52:33.406
And they are hiding the fact that public health doesn't have that much to offer us now that we have clean water and soap and we have good food and good hygiene and a good supply chain and this kind of thing.

52:34.289 --> 52:34.631
Yes.

52:35.755 --> 52:38.345
Yes, we need to improve what we put in our guts.

52:38.445 --> 52:38.827
Yes.

52:39.810 --> 52:41.471
You gotta stop eating fast food.

52:41.611 --> 52:44.692
Yes, you gotta stop eating things out of boxes and bags.

52:45.372 --> 52:51.035
Yes, you need to get outside more, but there are some truths that are more important than that.

52:51.175 --> 52:55.016
And as Mark Kulak has said, a lot of times it's just about priority.

52:55.036 --> 53:08.622
And if they can get you to put your priorities in the wrong place and think that most of the ship, most of the aircraft carrier is controlled by a combination of blackmail, drugs, and payment, then you're never really gonna understand

53:14.352 --> 53:17.514
This is the recommended childhood vaccination schedule in the United States.

53:18.055 --> 53:22.998
It's a monthly schedule that breaks down the age a child should be vaccinated for common infectious diseases.

53:23.658 --> 53:27.161
Here's measles at 12 months and polio starting at two months.

53:27.741 --> 53:31.744
Here's hepatitis B, recommended often before a baby even leaves the hospital.

53:33.062 --> 53:38.286
The reason why I'm showing you these blue videos today is because I want you to understand what we're up against.

53:38.346 --> 53:43.531
And when I say we, I mean the people that chose the red versus the blue.

53:43.631 --> 53:46.493
And there is, make no mistake about it, that's the trap we're in.

53:47.454 --> 53:55.880
The people that potentially could be confused enough to hate us are on the blue side.

53:56.080 --> 54:01.685
And they are the people who largely can't really process the idea that

54:02.640 --> 54:05.763
the truth is not available for free on TV.

54:05.843 --> 54:08.645
These are the people who trust most of the people they know.

54:09.206 --> 54:14.450
These are the people who think that there's very little, if any, fraud going on anywhere.

54:15.051 --> 54:19.695
Certainly not in the banks or in academia or in the government.

54:21.496 --> 54:26.681
And so, yes, we are in a pretty bad trap, but the trap was set for us.

54:28.843 --> 54:29.984
And it was many layered.

54:30.762 --> 54:34.163
It wasn't just gonna be, you know, oh, darn, you figured it out.

54:34.223 --> 54:36.624
You took his mask off and now you figured it out.

54:36.725 --> 54:39.506
No way, no way.

54:41.707 --> 54:51.471
And so this is what we are up against right now because this is what the majority, and I say that with a real, the majority of the country thinks this.

54:52.449 --> 55:01.765
that the vaccine schedule's okay, that Paul Offit's okay, and that there's no possible way that the vaccine schedule could exist.

55:02.777 --> 55:08.379
other than as if it really is the foundation of our modern society.

55:08.760 --> 55:15.302
All diseases that at one time came with a host of horrifying side effects, things like brain damage, paralysis, and even death.

55:15.923 --> 55:19.444
And so parents and pediatricians have followed these recommendations for decades.

55:20.104 --> 55:23.286
But in recent years, there's been a lot of confusion and concern.

55:23.866 --> 55:27.990
More and more parents are choosing to delay or even outright omit parts of the schedule.

55:28.531 --> 55:31.994
And to be fair, this can be very overwhelming.

55:32.755 --> 55:36.759
Why do young children need so many shots on such a tight schedule?

55:36.839 --> 55:37.460
Do you hear it?

55:37.820 --> 55:42.465
So they're already going to absorb a lot of the vaccine skepticism.

55:42.505 --> 55:45.508
They're even going to say that it's normal to be skeptical.

55:48.035 --> 56:06.779
because we have been walked into a trap, ladies and gentlemen, and if we don't pull out now, I mean really get out of the trap and admit that we were fooled, but point out that they are just as fooled, just slightly more of them, that's the problem.

56:08.099 --> 56:10.260
The lemmings are gonna get teeth soon.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.300
Let's break it down.

56:17.008 --> 56:20.009
Well, first of all, I think we do ask a lot of parents in this country.

56:20.229 --> 56:26.092
I mean, we ask them to give vaccines to prevent 14 different diseases in the first few years of life.

56:26.232 --> 56:29.814
That can mean as many as 25 shots during that time.

56:30.034 --> 56:34.636
Dr. Paul Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

56:34.756 --> 56:37.877
I think the skepticism or pushback is perfectly understandable.

56:37.897 --> 56:41.339
I think it would be amazing if people didn't push back a little bit on vaccines.

56:41.379 --> 56:42.319
It would be amazing.

56:42.559 --> 56:45.801
It would be amazing if people didn't push back a little bit.

56:48.473 --> 56:54.255
Isn't this the most remarkably disingenuous presentation you've ever, never seen?

56:55.276 --> 56:58.197
But this is where we are right now today in America.

56:59.157 --> 57:06.500
And because of social media, lots of our family and friends have no fricking clue that this is where they are already.

57:08.641 --> 57:10.681
And that's terrifying, ladies and gentlemen.

57:10.721 --> 57:12.122
We need to point this out.

57:12.162 --> 57:17.684
We need to pull our family and friends out of this mess because the doors are closing fast.

57:20.016 --> 57:28.468
Especially because we're talking about children as young as a day old, which makes giving them shots very scary, but also very necessary.

57:29.029 --> 57:31.853
Newborns are one of the most vulnerable populations in health care.

57:32.185 --> 57:34.686
Now, why are newborns so vulnerable?

57:34.726 --> 57:46.853
See, that's another thing that's just hilarious here because newborns are vulnerable because their gut wall isn't solid yet, because their blood-brain barrier isn't solid yet.

57:47.433 --> 57:59.220
So breastfeeding a baby is the best way to go about the first few months, if not years, if possible, for this simple reason.

58:01.323 --> 58:06.627
because a human baby comes out of the womb in less than fighting condition.

58:08.508 --> 58:18.555
And so, yes, they are vulnerable, but how can they justify intramuscular injection being a valid way of helping with that vulnerability?

58:20.194 --> 58:29.157
And it's that complete naivety, that complete lack of understanding that needs to be present and is present in all of these actors.

58:29.738 --> 58:39.802
And it's facilitated by the fact that deep down, Paul Offit knows that the only really good foolproof vaccines would be vaccines that you could eat.

58:40.382 --> 58:41.642
And he said it before.

58:42.923 --> 58:48.525
It's just that right now, you know, that would be ideal, but that's not the way things are.

58:52.847 --> 58:56.349
Their organs are still developing and their immune systems are brand new.

58:56.429 --> 59:00.893
When you're born, you're initially in a virtually sterile environment in the womb.

59:00.933 --> 59:03.455
But then when you pass through the birth canal and you're in the world, you're not.

59:03.775 --> 59:06.738
This means that babies are especially susceptible to certain diseases.

59:07.198 --> 59:09.800
Consider RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.482
There are 60,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations every year in the United States.

59:15.046 --> 59:16.567
for children who are infected with RSV.

59:16.587 --> 59:19.650
It's the number one cause of hospitalization in the United States.

59:19.910 --> 59:23.714
My guess is that the majority of kids that have RSV are not being breastfed.

59:25.495 --> 59:25.896
Maybe it's 100%.

59:25.936 --> 59:35.464
And so again, we're talking about fundamental biology that's left completely out of the discussion of childbirth and childbearing.

59:37.065 --> 59:39.788
Fundamental things just left out.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.583
And in case you're not aware, breast milk is just not milk.

59:45.743 --> 59:53.328
It can also pass gut bacteria to the baby and seed the original microbiome.

59:53.988 --> 59:54.529
Yes, sir.

59:54.869 --> 59:56.190
In under one-year-olds.

59:56.390 --> 01:00:00.733
Researchers have been working on a vaccine for this virus since the 60s.

01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:02.714
In 2023, it was added to the schedule for infants.

01:00:02.814 --> 01:00:07.938
And of course, as Catherine Organic in the chat has pointed out, there are antibodies which are passed

01:00:08.698 --> 01:00:10.279
with the breast milk.

01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:27.569
And many of those antibodies are aspecific antibodies for a wide range of different, let's say, motifs in nature that everybody has antibodies to that are supplemented by the breastfeeding.

01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:29.230
So again, here we are

01:00:30.803 --> 01:00:46.968
Not really saying part of the reason why this can exist, part of the reason why the justification for it does exist is because of this inversion or erasure of a lot of what was considered fundamental biology.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:01:06.622
I feel a lot of times in this discussion it's necessary for me to testify to the fact that we, my wife and I, my wife had our first two children in Norway and when we had our first kid we were given three days in a

01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:27.824
adjacent building that was a hospital hotel run specifically for new mothers and their families so that the husband and the wife could spend three days in a hotel where a midwife and coach of breastfeeding was available by the pull of a string.

01:01:29.861 --> 01:01:38.283
where they taught the husband how to be able to see whether there was enough breast in the mouth, whether the position of the tongue and the lips was okay.

01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:42.725
Because of course, women can't always see that depending on the size of their breasts.

01:01:42.805 --> 01:01:56.988
So it's a very remarkable investment in the first few days of parenting, including how to change the diaper, how to give a bath, you know, how hard can you push?

01:01:57.068 --> 01:01:58.009
How do they burp?

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:58.869
This whole thing.

01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:07.848
Can you imagine if you didn't have this, just think about how breathtakingly amazing it would have been to have it.

01:02:11.051 --> 01:02:20.241
Where you and your husband could have spent, or you and your wife could have spent three days in a paid hospital bed with

01:02:21.021 --> 01:02:44.147
you know, really enthusiastic midwives around that could have taught you, dad, how to change that newborn's diaper, could have taught you, dad, how to put that breast in the mom's mouth, could have taught you, dad, how to help this woman struggle with all kinds of things that she's never done before, all kinds of pressures that she's never felt before, and had all these professionals around to help you do it.

01:02:47.728 --> 01:02:49.028
And in America, we have this.

01:02:52.782 --> 01:02:56.083
And I don't think that that explanation is exaggerating at all.

01:02:56.843 --> 01:03:03.684
That's a pretty good approximation to the difference between having a baby in Norway where they don't talk to you about shots.

01:03:04.724 --> 01:03:06.725
They talk to you about breastfeeding.

01:03:09.605 --> 01:03:11.966
And America where they don't talk to you about shots.

01:03:12.006 --> 01:03:17.647
They just give them to your baby unless you're smart enough to know not to tell them not to do it.

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:23.486
Nobody asked us if Freddie should get a hep B shot and a vitamin K shot.

01:03:23.526 --> 01:03:26.169
They were doing it when I said, what are you doing?

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:32.034
And she kept going, finished that, and then told me what she did.

01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:43.645
Our experience in America has been nothing short of a medical nightmare, and we have perfectly healthy kids, and we are perfectly healthy parents.

01:03:46.246 --> 01:03:51.868
And so I have a quite, well, relatively in America, a pretty unique perspective on the trap we're in.

01:03:53.068 --> 01:03:59.650
Because I also tried to help this, what I now know to be a fake health freedom movement.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.111
I tried to help them get farther.

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:07.172
I tried to help them finally score a touchdown, you know, thinking that it was like a rugby scrum.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:12.914
And if we just had one or two more people pushing on our side, for sure, we would make progress.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.102
So we don't recommend it for five-year-olds.

01:04:18.142 --> 01:04:20.443
They tend to get a cold when they get an RSV.

01:04:20.643 --> 01:04:24.666
But under one-year-olds, many of them get hospitalized.

01:04:24.946 --> 01:04:26.587
This is Dr. Jim Campbell, by the way.

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:29.249
He's a vaccine expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics.

01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:39.195
We represent the children of the United States, and we want to make sure that what's recommended is what's appropriately recommended to protect children.

01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:44.118
It's interesting to think that there's no one out there protecting the children before birth.

01:04:45.245 --> 01:04:48.866
except for what, this pro-life movement that's against abortion?

01:04:50.607 --> 01:04:58.629
How come the pro-life movement that's against abortion isn't against vaccines, you know, in the first whatever months of development?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.310
Can you see any contradiction there?

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:03.990
Any like, wow, that's kind of wacky.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:04.970
I never thought about that.

01:05:05.091 --> 01:05:09.992
Yeah, it's all over the place, ladies and gentlemen, and it's all biologically based.

01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:12.520
biologically-based bullshit.

01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:16.764
Vaccines offer a safe way to train their new immune systems.

01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:22.789
And each part of this schedule, from the dosage to the timing, is curated to do that extremely effectively.

01:05:24.156 --> 01:05:28.097
Every single part of the schedule has been scrutinized by multiple medical organizations.

01:05:28.577 --> 01:05:33.419
So when deciding if and when a vaccine should go on the schedule, experts are looking at two main things.

01:05:34.259 --> 01:05:38.341
One is the disease burden, which is basically the impact of the illness on society.

01:05:38.581 --> 01:05:40.221
What we call the epidemiology.

01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:41.882
When do you see those diseases?

01:05:42.262 --> 01:05:49.184
And when would it be reasonable to give vaccines based on timing of the disease?

01:05:49.384 --> 01:05:51.025
So you want to make sure the child is fully immune.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.423
by the time they are most likely to get these infections.

01:05:54.723 --> 01:05:56.645
And two is the immune system itself.

01:05:57.326 --> 01:05:59.048
When can it launch the best response?

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:03.874
For example, babies are born with some temporary measles antibodies from their mom.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:09.360
If a vaccine is given too early, those maternal antibodies could prevent the baby from developing their own.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:11.663
In short, the vaccine doesn't work.

01:06:11.963 --> 01:06:16.586
While it's safe to give the measles vaccine earlier, experts have found the optimal time to give it in the U.S.

01:06:16.626 --> 01:06:20.509
is between 12 and 15 months, then again before a child enters kindergarten.

01:06:20.869 --> 01:06:23.571
And this method has been found to be 97% effective at preventing measles.

01:06:23.591 --> 01:06:26.693
This method has been shown to be 97% effective with a range of 67 to 100%.

01:06:26.873 --> 01:06:29.755
And again, this is a script reading person who doesn't understand

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:51.857
the endeavor of biology nearly well enough to say the things that she's saying with the certainty with which she's saying, you know, like extremely effective.

01:06:55.139 --> 01:07:03.045
Extensive research into these two factors, the disease burden and the immune response at various ages, are exactly why a child gets so many vaccines so quickly.

01:07:03.846 --> 01:07:09.490
But this has a lot of parents asking, couldn't all these shots overwhelm a child's very new immune system?

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:11.753
That's the biggest concern by far.

01:07:12.034 --> 01:07:15.619
There is no way to quote, overwhelm your immune system.

01:07:15.639 --> 01:07:18.804
Our immune systems, even the very new ones, are incredible.

01:07:19.338 --> 01:07:23.159
So overwhelming the immune system is kind of a straw man.

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:27.479
Although, you know, I don't know how to, some of those concepts that don't really make that much sense to me.

01:07:27.519 --> 01:07:30.860
So I don't use them very often, but it's kind of a false argument.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:36.101
It, it's suggesting that there is a immune system to teach.

01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:39.042
It suggests that they are able to teach it.

01:07:39.482 --> 01:07:44.482
And then it suggests that the only question is, is there a limit on what it can learn?

01:07:44.943 --> 01:07:47.243
And then the answer is no, there isn't.

01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:51.469
And so the coin is, you know, is there too much?

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:52.371
Is there a limit?

01:07:53.212 --> 01:07:53.953
Yes or no.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.477
And there is no coin.

01:07:57.617 --> 01:07:59.159
This is complete nonsense.

01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:04.106
They don't know how to augment the immune system of a newborn baby by injecting things into the muscle.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:23.962
And they certainly don't know that what they're doing is protecting these babies given the fact that, again, we have sanitation and clean water and soap and nutrition and hospitals and sterile stuff and one-time use needles and all this other crap that makes it very difficult

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:30.140
for anybody to really reconcile what was happening when people were sicker than they are today.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:40.667
But it certainly gets rid of the biggest causes and starts to focus on these public health based things as being extremely important.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:50.693
And they have no basis for this in evidence, no basis for this in the historical record, no basis for this claim.

01:08:53.154 --> 01:09:04.004
And in fact, I'm convinced now after a lot of book buying and book reading and archiving that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea that nobody bothered to check.

01:09:05.025 --> 01:09:12.351
Because for almost a generation, everybody thought that intramuscular injection seemed to be the best thing since buttered bread.

01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:15.554
And we've just kind of latched on and kept on that idea since.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:23.604
Maybe some of the people that are behind it understand that, but a lot of people don't because that's how lemmings work.

01:09:25.485 --> 01:09:32.950
This is how lemmings are sustained in the running direction that they're running, by just more lemmings on social media.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:37.713
Every day we wake up and just by breathing, eating, and touching various surfaces.

01:09:37.913 --> 01:09:41.575
We are exposed to thousands and thousands of antigens.

01:09:41.855 --> 01:09:43.436
All at once, all the time.

01:09:43.616 --> 01:09:46.418
Our body and our immune systems are ready for

01:09:46.889 --> 01:09:48.490
huge numbers of antigens.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:52.151
And it's an important part of what they do is surveil for those antigens all day long.

01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:58.073
Now, if our immune systems are so incredible, what's the big deal if we just let kids build immunity naturally?

01:09:59.174 --> 01:10:00.034
Isn't that better anyway?

01:10:00.354 --> 01:10:00.834
It is better.

01:10:01.314 --> 01:10:01.634
It's true.

01:10:01.895 --> 01:10:04.896
The problem with that is the price that you pay for natural immunity.

01:10:05.236 --> 01:10:07.257
Natural immunity is a gamble.

01:10:07.657 --> 01:10:10.378
And the risk of getting... And so here comes more of the truth.

01:10:10.518 --> 01:10:11.618
It is better, he says.

01:10:12.699 --> 01:10:13.939
But now there's a gamble.

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:31.970
So again, I hope you can see how the anti-vax movement in America, the health freedom movement in America, the vaccine skeptics are definitely set up to fail because the nuance is going to be available on this side.

01:10:34.537 --> 01:10:37.079
The nuance is already being taken up.

01:10:37.139 --> 01:10:40.062
The slack is being taken up on this side of the narrative.

01:10:40.082 --> 01:10:45.367
And it's been being taken up for years now while we were cheering Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:45.447 --> 01:10:53.734
on to try and get him to be vice president of Donald Trump, like this Skyhorse book was trying to script it back in 2008.

01:10:57.819 --> 01:11:02.841
infected with any one of these diseases heavily outweighs the risk of vaccines themselves.

01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:06.623
Polio led to paralysis in one out of every 200 infections.

01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:11.505
Before the vaccine, nearly half a million people died or were left paralyzed every year around the world.

01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:16.287
Chances are pretty good that this paralysis was because of intramuscular injection.

01:11:18.128 --> 01:11:20.949
Chances are really good that a lot of these pictures were staged.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:35.717
chances are really good that a lot of the technology that we are now using is just the next, the several generations down the road of what can we inject in people's muscles that won't really devastate their bodies?

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:47.806
Can we find anything that we can put in there that won't cause paralysis, won't cause autoimmunity, won't cause a almost endless myriad of toxicities?

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:55.953
Because those people in that video, in this video, are not debating about whether there's any toxicity at all.

01:11:56.373 --> 01:12:02.076
They were only debating how much the immune system could learn and whether we were pushing too much too early.

01:12:04.438 --> 01:12:17.846
And now they're showing you propaganda from the 1950s that the polio is a thing and that there is a vaccine and stuff and Vincent Reddick and Yellow and Paul Offit have been busy ever since they're postdocs.

01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:21.298
Hepatitis B can lead to liver cancer or cirrhosis.

01:12:21.898 --> 01:12:25.882
90% of infants who catch Hep B end up with a lifelong chronic infection.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.384
But not liver cancer!

01:12:30.306 --> 01:12:39.314
And the lifelong chronic infection is just the presence of a virus, a RNA or DNA signal, however they characterize it.

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:43.278
Adenoviruses are found in the liver all the time.

01:12:45.472 --> 01:12:52.079
That's why we used them a long time ago as a liver targeting thing, because that's where they ended up.

01:12:54.822 --> 01:12:59.507
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, the lies are deep, the webs we've woven.

01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:01.335
before the measles vaccine.

01:13:01.355 --> 01:13:04.417
There were 48,000 hospitalizations every year for measles.

01:13:04.457 --> 01:13:11.503
There were 500 deaths from measles, primarily pneumonia, dehydration, and to some extent encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain.

01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:14.525
Vaccines are on the schedule to remove the gamble.

01:13:14.785 --> 01:13:17.247
I think the term natural immunity is the wrong word.

01:13:17.607 --> 01:13:19.529
I think the term should be survivor immunity.

01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:21.110
because that would be more accurate.

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:24.952
Probably a better question is, is vaccine-induced immunity good enough?

01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:26.492
And the answer is yes.

01:13:26.852 --> 01:13:33.656
So you can delay or spread out shots, but all that means is more time a child is left unprotected.

01:13:34.016 --> 01:13:37.778
So it is a well-tested, well-hewn schedule, a delayed schedule.

01:13:38.198 --> 01:14:03.396
only puts children at increased risk so a delayed schedule is something that paul thomas of chd and rfk and robert malone and all these people has been advocating for some time it's actually also the thing that is codified in peter mccullough's book the vaccine myths or some other bullshit that they're trying to put out from chd it's all the same half measures which uh uh or

01:14:06.858 --> 01:14:10.320
Now this guy can very easily point to and debunk.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:21.306
And so every time you think you're going to be able to argue with your family and friends using the talking points very conveniently provided to you by the CHD website, you're going to lose.

01:14:21.926 --> 01:14:27.329
you're gonna lose because all of those talking points are by design failures.

01:14:27.409 --> 01:14:32.992
That's why Mary Holland has never made any progress except for in salary in the last 10 years.

01:14:33.432 --> 01:14:35.013
That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:39.315
hasn't made any progress except in salary and book sales in the last 20 years.

01:14:39.355 --> 01:14:42.236
That's why none of these people have actually saved anyone.

01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:47.199
That's why none of these people ever talk about the opioid epidemic in America.

01:14:47.719 --> 01:15:05.607
because these people are scripted actors they're not crusaders or patriots trying to save americans or save america or save america for their children like i am they're just not i don't know what i'm doing i don't know how to do it

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.421
That's why I seem desperate.

01:15:08.461 --> 01:15:12.685
That's why I say things off the cuff because I don't have a script.

01:15:13.186 --> 01:15:19.772
I don't know how we're going to get our kids out of this, but I do know that these people are the walls of the trap.

01:15:20.953 --> 01:15:24.917
Social media is the cage and we got to get out of it.

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:27.151
with no advantage.

01:15:27.512 --> 01:15:33.634
Though for some parents, it's not the amount of shots, but what's supposedly in them that leads to uncertainty.

01:15:34.195 --> 01:15:36.376
Vaccines are typically made up of five components.

01:15:36.736 --> 01:15:41.358
The most obvious one is the antigen itself, the thing that prompts your body to launch an immune response.

01:15:41.998 --> 01:15:47.781
Sometimes that's a weakened or dead version of the virus, and sometimes it's just a single protein from the virus.

01:15:48.101 --> 01:16:07.891
if you have for example a so that's supposed to drive us learned anti-vaxxers nuts because just a second ago they showed you that there was all kinds of other stuff in the in the vaccines and if you know anything about vaccines the virus and sometimes it's just a single sometimes it's a live components the most obvious one

01:16:08.402 --> 01:16:12.023
So you see, there's all kinds of stuff in here that they haven't tested.

01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:14.004
None of this stuff is placebo tested.

01:16:14.364 --> 01:16:23.966
They've got all kinds of stuff in there, like the mercury preservatives and the aluminum and stuff, the adjuvants and the excipients and the stabilizers and the manufacturing byproducts.

01:16:24.907 --> 01:16:26.307
Manufacturing byproducts?

01:16:26.347 --> 01:16:28.308
You mean like DNA contamination?

01:16:28.908 --> 01:16:30.088
Oh, wow.

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:30.988
Look at them all.

01:16:31.048 --> 01:16:32.709
They're just absorbing everything.

01:16:34.138 --> 01:16:41.782
It's almost like every hero that we could pull out of our card deck is going to be trumped by one of their heroes saying, no, that's stupid.

01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:47.546
And if you can see it, then you can understand that it's by design.

01:16:47.726 --> 01:16:49.207
It's still the same script.

01:16:50.487 --> 01:16:55.130
It's almost like the sparse pandemic document, but it has 10 more years on the back of it.

01:16:57.332 --> 01:17:08.310
We're all getting rolled into one burrito of bullshit, ladies and gentlemen, and if we don't pull our heads out soon, Chipotle's gonna close and we're gonna be swept up on the floor of that dead restaurant.

01:17:11.986 --> 01:17:15.968
One is the antigen itself, the thing that prompts your body to launch an immune response.

01:17:16.589 --> 01:17:21.131
Sometimes that's a weakened or dead version of the virus, and sometimes it's just a single probe.

01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:22.872
This is a SAG actor.

01:17:22.932 --> 01:17:26.754
This is no different than the girl that sits next to Sam Cedar.

01:17:27.455 --> 01:17:29.196
She auditioned for this spot.

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:30.637
You see what I'm saying here?

01:17:31.587 --> 01:17:33.488
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

01:17:33.568 --> 01:17:39.652
She is a skilled actor who knows how to say a script like she knows what she's talking about.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:52.219
Is this any different than somebody wearing Vulcan ears and telling you that time travel is possible as long as you're able to skirt the event horizon of a black hole and go to warp seven before the warp core melts down?

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.940
Is it any different than that?

01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:55.942
No, it's the same thing.

01:17:56.866 --> 01:18:03.078
Except this lady has a Twitter account and might actually put a smiley face reply to something that you tweet.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.222
That's the only difference.

01:18:06.903 --> 01:18:08.344
protein from the virus.

01:18:08.624 --> 01:18:15.850
If you have, for example, a viral vaccine, like the hepatitis B vaccine, that has one hepatitis B virus protein in it.

01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:24.598
Compared to when a child gets, say, strep throat, where they're exposed to between 25 and 50 antigens at once, a vaccine has way fewer.

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:30.883
But mounting confusion comes from these other ingredients in vaccines, constantly being cited as toxic.

01:18:31.343 --> 01:18:32.905
You have sort of this chemophobia.

01:18:33.365 --> 01:18:35.787
The minute you say the chemical name, like sodium phosphate.

01:18:35.928 --> 01:18:39.011
I mean, sodium phosphate, for example, may be a buffering agent in vaccines.

01:18:39.531 --> 01:18:44.656
And if you say that to people, they don't really know what it means and don't know that they pretty much drink sodium phosphate every day.

01:18:45.117 --> 01:18:46.358
Thimerosal, for example.

01:18:46.418 --> 01:18:51.563
Of course, drinking it is very different than injecting it into a muscle, but go ahead, tell me more.

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:53.324
has been making headlines recently.

01:18:53.805 --> 01:18:57.288
It's a preservative that's been used in all types of products since the 1930s.

01:18:57.868 --> 01:19:01.972
And it contains ethyl mercury, which sounds terrifying.

01:19:02.593 --> 01:19:07.017
But one, thimerosal was removed from all childhood vaccines in 2001.

01:19:07.557 --> 01:19:10.400
And two, extensive research into this has proven it's safe.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.264
You saw studies where children who got this thimerosal-containing vaccine

01:19:15.404 --> 01:19:18.670
that they didn't change your blood level of mercury, because it was a trivia.

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:23.960
You know, Catherine Organic, just to make sure you know, I think it was you who just said that.

01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:26.785
Who said it?

01:19:26.825 --> 01:19:27.246
Where is it?

01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:27.787
I just saw it.

01:19:28.863 --> 01:19:33.807
Oh yeah, Catherine Organic just said it, the last tweet there, or the last chat there.

01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:54.383
Mark Hulak found an interview in some magazine, and I'm sure it's on his archive now, where Paul Offit is being interviewed about vaccines, and then the question is presented to him, or posed to him, like, you know, if you had, you know, if things were a perfect world, what would the vaccine schedule look like?

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:55.664
And he said it would all be oral.

01:19:56.684 --> 01:19:57.345
He just said it.

01:19:58.396 --> 01:20:02.977
So don't think for one second that these people don't know what they're up to.

01:20:03.037 --> 01:20:05.498
They just think that they're telling a noble lie.

01:20:05.518 --> 01:20:06.698
It's for the greater good.

01:20:08.018 --> 01:20:10.179
Vaccine injury is extremely rare.

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:13.799
And the other side just thinks that vaccine injury is not extremely rare.

01:20:13.839 --> 01:20:14.460
It's just rare.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.480
We are in a trap, ladies and gentlemen.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.941
We are about to be completely imprisoned.

01:20:22.048 --> 01:20:25.350
by our own actions because we've been running toward the brick wall.

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:26.911
We're about to break our jaws.

01:20:28.091 --> 01:20:31.153
And no, there is no evidence that it causes autism.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.554
Dozens of studies have been done on this topic.

01:20:33.714 --> 01:20:36.556
There is no link between any vaccine and autism.

01:20:37.156 --> 01:20:39.457
24 studies have been done at this point.

01:20:39.657 --> 01:20:39.457
24.

01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:44.160
Vaccines have been proven millions of times over the course of decades to be safe.

01:20:45.761 --> 01:20:50.744
24 studies, but now the scripted actor says they've been proven millions of times to be safe.

01:20:51.245 --> 01:20:56.108
But there is autism, and all the people with autism have had intramuscular injection.

01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:04.155
The problem is that autism spectrum disorder is a mythology that has roped in all kinds of unrelated

01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:31.660
diagnostic conditions, diagnosed conditions, sets of symptoms under some meaningless umbrella to exactly prevent you from seeing that intramuscular injection's just a dumb idea that is so temporally disconnected from most of the toxicities that result from it that no one has ever realized that it's just a dumb idea from the late 1800s we should have stopped doing when we stopped using morphine like we were using then.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.881
All the diseases they aim to protect us from

01:21:34.841 --> 01:21:35.181
are not.

01:21:37.402 --> 01:21:38.862
In 2025, the U.S.

01:21:38.882 --> 01:21:41.583
recorded the most measles cases in 30 years.

01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:43.344
Three people have died.

01:21:44.304 --> 01:21:47.985
Outbreaks like this are directly related to dropping vaccination rates.

01:21:48.205 --> 01:21:50.846
When immunization rates start to fade, measles comes back.

01:21:50.946 --> 01:21:52.546
It's a highly contagious disease.

01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:58.448
And for that reason, it needs a very high rate of immunity, community immunity, herd immunity.

01:21:58.968 --> 01:22:00.329
Maybe you've seen this chart before.

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:03.392
It's the number of measles infections dating back to the 1950s.

01:22:03.592 --> 01:22:06.134
This is where the vaccine was introduced.

01:22:06.935 --> 01:22:12.099
Here's a similar chart for polio and HIV, a virus that causes meningitis.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:24.450
If we can continue to reduce the burden of disease for children through safe and effective vaccines, it's still a passion of ours to continue to find those.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:33.738
Now, remember, those graphs that they showed at the end are basically the graphs that Suzanne Humphrey supposedly uses to dunk on the polio vaccine.

01:22:33.998 --> 01:22:34.718
Stop lying!

01:22:38.199 --> 01:22:39.560
It's bad, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.601
It's very bad because the New York Times is doing it too.

01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:53.805
Earlier this month, the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced it would be cutting nearly $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine development.

01:22:54.338 --> 01:23:00.746
Experts say the announcement was riddled with false and misleading claims about the proven effectiveness of the vaccines.

01:23:01.086 --> 01:23:08.315
HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk and benefits for these respiratory viruses.

01:23:08.996 --> 01:23:11.159
And it's not just mRNA vaccines.

01:23:11.670 --> 01:23:16.653
The Trump budget proposal cuts more than $33 billion from Health and Human Services.

01:23:16.753 --> 01:23:24.057
Includes cutting nearly 40%, I'm going to say that again, 40% of federal funding allocated to the National Cancer Institute.

01:23:24.357 --> 01:23:25.858
That's nearly $3 billion.

01:23:26.758 --> 01:23:36.124
His cuts to scientific funding and grants and institutions broadly have thrown just a huge amount of possibly life-saving research into chaos.

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:41.575
Is any of this, is all of this, really going to make America healthy again?

01:23:41.595 --> 01:23:43.395
I doubt it.

01:23:44.035 --> 01:23:44.856
Obviously, I doubt it.

01:23:45.636 --> 01:23:51.738
But what it does do is reveal what Make America Healthy Again was really, is really, about.

01:23:51.758 --> 01:23:56.120
I feel about that movement the way I felt about the Department of Government Efficiency.

01:23:57.136 --> 01:24:00.077
I'm fundamentally sympathetic to what it is promising to do.

01:24:00.818 --> 01:24:11.242
Don't forget that in the first Trump administration, Peter Thiel was given a role very similar to what Elon Musk was doing with the Doge thing.

01:24:11.282 --> 01:24:12.402
Don't forget about that.

01:24:12.462 --> 01:24:15.023
That's just one of many things that you shouldn't forget.

01:24:16.204 --> 01:24:19.845
A Department of Government efficiency, an effort to make America healthy again.

01:24:19.945 --> 01:24:21.006
These are good ideas.

01:24:22.006 --> 01:24:23.507
Somebody should actually try them.

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:29.240
But Maha, like Doge, isn't even attempting to do what is promised in the name.

01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:32.022
So what is it attempting to do?

01:24:32.062 --> 01:24:33.183
What are its actual ideas?

01:24:33.523 --> 01:24:39.046
How did a pandemic that was largely ended by vaccines lead to this policy regime?

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:48.993
How did the president who presided over Operation Warp Speed, that was Donald Trump's great success, how did he become the president who appointed RFK Jr.

01:24:49.613 --> 01:24:52.135
to lead our most important health institution?

01:24:53.561 --> 01:25:01.650
How is it possible that five years after the COVID pandemic, experts now say that we are less prepared for the next pandemic than we were for the last one?

01:25:02.751 --> 01:25:06.755
My colleague, David Walsh-Wells has done incredible reporting on the pandemic.

01:25:07.155 --> 01:25:08.977
I got to go to the basketball court.

01:25:09.017 --> 01:25:12.781
So suffice it to say that if we listened to this, you would be shocked.

01:25:13.621 --> 01:25:16.122
to hear how on narrative they are.

01:25:16.322 --> 01:25:18.524
It's a natural virus.

01:25:18.584 --> 01:25:21.905
It's definitely not a lab leak, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:22.106 --> 01:25:25.828
Everything that you would imagine they would say about the COVID narrative, they say.

01:25:25.848 --> 01:25:27.588
I mean, they say it perfectly.

01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:31.431
They say it really perfectly.

01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:36.333
It's just remarkable how sure they are that what the TV told them is true.

01:25:40.054 --> 01:25:41.396
So David, I want to start with you.

01:25:41.716 --> 01:25:47.703
There's a quote from Michael Lewis, the writer, where he says, the problem with pandemics is that people want to forget them.

01:25:48.584 --> 01:25:51.627
So we're four plus years on from COVID's onset.

01:25:52.108 --> 01:25:52.708
What have we forgotten?

01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:55.571
I would say the biggest thing is the death.

01:25:55.592 --> 01:25:57.213
1.5 million Americans died.

01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:07.279
30 million people globally, tens of millions hospitalized, probably some number in the millions who are disabled by experience with COVID.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:21.567
And we now look back on the experience focused on all of these secondary questions, whether we close schools too long, whether we mask toddlers, exactly what kind of sterilizing immunity vaccines could deliver.

01:26:22.067 --> 01:26:23.248
And those are all important questions.

01:26:23.488 --> 01:26:25.249
You see how scripted I was?

01:26:25.469 --> 01:26:26.750
I was saying things like,

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:31.675
telling my viewers what sterilizing immunity was and how it could or couldn't be achieved.

01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:43.767
That is the script that I was supposed to be on all the way through the exclamation that see it's a lab leak and I and finally Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:43.787 --> 01:26:45.109
let me tell the truth.

01:26:48.672 --> 01:26:58.756
That's where I'd be if I wouldn't have snapped myself out of it, if I wouldn't have kept reading, if I wouldn't have kept buying books on eBay, if I wouldn't have kept asking, do I really know what I think I know?

01:26:58.776 --> 01:27:00.637
I would have never gotten this far.

01:27:00.697 --> 01:27:08.841
If all these people that have supported my family wouldn't have gotten their checkbook out and sent something, I wouldn't have gotten this far.

01:27:10.261 --> 01:27:14.103
But I am farther than almost anyone else has ever gotten.

01:27:16.052 --> 01:27:22.959
Because I think I can actually explain how America has been set up to fail.

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:34.269
How American politics has been inverted and distorted to the point where we will eat ourselves alive if we do not pull our heads out.

01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:40.195
The left has bamboozled exactly as much as the right has been bamboozled, but

01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:48.834
The way the trap is going to work is that the left is going to be dropped on the right, and together both will be annihilated.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:59.357
And the left will come screaming down on top of us with their feet first, thinking that they're going to land safely on us.

01:28:00.751 --> 01:28:05.535
When in reality, they are as part of the same controlled demolition that we are.

01:28:05.595 --> 01:28:07.416
It's just that they are on top.

01:28:07.496 --> 01:28:12.921
And from their point of view, it looks like they are at least in the better position than we are.

01:28:15.263 --> 01:28:18.565
It's very bad, ladies and gentlemen, I want to show you how bad it is.

01:28:20.967 --> 01:28:21.988
Should be asking them in any good.

01:28:24.431 --> 01:28:26.112
Let me cut to, then, mRNA.

01:28:26.312 --> 01:28:26.652
Okay.

01:28:26.692 --> 01:28:26.892
Sure.

01:28:27.032 --> 01:28:32.075
Because, like, I was a guy who did not want the COVID vaccine, but I do want research on mRNA.

01:28:32.095 --> 01:28:32.275
Sure.

01:28:32.495 --> 01:28:34.316
I don't think that that's crazy stuff.

01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:34.556
Right.

01:28:34.796 --> 01:28:39.038
In fact, when the next one comes along, I may want to be first on line for it.

01:28:39.219 --> 01:28:39.379
Right.

01:28:39.639 --> 01:28:45.682
So, I'm not... So, he's not... he's not on our team.

01:28:46.842 --> 01:28:51.665
And, in fact, this script was predicted by me three years ago.

01:28:53.823 --> 01:28:56.287
And I said Bill Maher would be one of the people that would do it.

01:28:57.588 --> 01:29:01.874
And it's exactly as I suspected that they're using this Huberman clown.

01:29:02.955 --> 01:29:13.557
this poser of a biologist, a poser of a neuroscientist who does not have an active lab anymore, just like Sam Harris doesn't have an active lab anymore.

01:29:13.577 --> 01:29:19.158
So you should call yourself a former neuroscientist, just like I call myself a recovering academic.

01:29:19.219 --> 01:29:25.480
These people are frauds and they are on a national security script because America is being undermined

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:39.709
on both sides so that our populace will never unite around a common vision of our future for our kids, but will unite around a common vision of why our country is so shit.

01:29:40.089 --> 01:29:49.515
But it'll be a, you know, one vision on one side and one vision on the other and two groups of people fighting, thinking that they're patriots.

01:29:49.595 --> 01:29:51.657
That's what we've been set up for.

01:29:54.713 --> 01:30:03.618
And if we can wake ourselves up and we can wake our neighbors up and we can explain what happened to us, we can explain that we didn't fall for Donald Trump.

01:30:03.979 --> 01:30:05.920
We didn't fall for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:22.569
We fell for a whole theater that included Bill Maher and included Huberman and Rogan and all these people that it's very easy to say that you dismiss them, just like it's very easy to say that you could always see through Alex Jones or you could always see through Laura Loomer.

01:30:22.609 --> 01:30:23.290
It doesn't matter.

01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:26.156
You chose a side.

01:30:29.759 --> 01:30:32.001
And if you chose a side, you're in the trap.

01:30:32.301 --> 01:30:38.666
If you chose a side, you're about to fight with the people in the trap because that's part of the design of it.

01:30:39.847 --> 01:30:49.334
Listen to these malevolent scripted national security actors who don't know what they're talking about, but definitely are committed to the script.

01:30:50.609 --> 01:30:55.674
Maybe next time, maybe on the next pandemic, I'll be the first in line for the next generation.

01:30:56.094 --> 01:30:59.857
That's exactly, exactly what they are scripted to say.

01:31:00.097 --> 01:31:03.380
I'm down with, I like Bobby too, but I'm not down with him cutting.

01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:05.422
I don't think that that's crazy stuff.

01:31:05.923 --> 01:31:10.166
In fact, when the next one comes along, I may want to be first on line for it.

01:31:10.747 --> 01:31:14.870
So I'm not down with, I like Bobby too, but I'm not down with him cutting that shit.

01:31:15.211 --> 01:31:15.451
Yeah.

01:31:15.491 --> 01:31:16.151
So, um,

01:31:17.032 --> 01:31:18.933
mRNA is in every single one of our cells.

01:31:19.093 --> 01:31:22.554
A DNA, RNA, RNA protein is kind of like the pathway.

01:31:22.594 --> 01:31:24.495
So mRNA itself is not bad.

01:31:24.715 --> 01:31:29.997
And the messaging around mRNA vaccines has led people to believe that anything that carries the letters mRNA is bad.

01:31:30.237 --> 01:31:34.118
We are all here and we would not be here were it not for mRNA.

01:31:34.859 --> 01:31:35.659
mRNA vaccines

01:31:35.939 --> 01:31:46.251
So that's a little bit like saying that, you know, all the thing about, you know, putting oil in the car is just stupid because our cars wouldn't work if we didn't put oil in them.

01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:49.435
All the cars on the road work because we put oil in them.

01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:56.503
So telling me that spraying oil on a car is dumb, boy, you don't know what you're talking about, man.

01:31:58.171 --> 01:32:01.412
That's like saying that, you know, computer code is computer code.

01:32:01.452 --> 01:32:03.493
Computers run on computer code.

01:32:03.533 --> 01:32:05.773
So computer code can't be bad.

01:32:05.833 --> 01:32:08.074
We wouldn't have computers without computer code.

01:32:13.796 --> 01:32:15.276
It's already bullshit.

01:32:16.937 --> 01:32:20.258
And of course it's going to get much worse because the impurity of the RNA

01:32:21.687 --> 01:32:23.669
versus the purity of the RNA, right?

01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:31.555
Because we're making a pure quantity of mRNA of RNA that would never exist in nature, but it's not a pure quantity.

01:32:31.595 --> 01:32:38.060
It's got all kinds of fragments of mRNA shit that get produced by this industrial process.

01:32:38.661 --> 01:32:47.968
And it's an analog because it's been chemically altered to be N1 methyl pseudouridine, which is not a natural base like pseudouridine is.

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:56.917
It's not a natural mRNA like any of these things could potentially, I guess, be made of regular mRNA.

01:32:56.937 --> 01:32:59.719
We just put it in places it doesn't belong and see what happens.

01:32:59.819 --> 01:33:00.900
No, no, no, no, no.

01:33:01.521 --> 01:33:10.309
He's got so little accuracy here that he's actually making the people that are listening to him simply dumber.

01:33:12.779 --> 01:33:24.203
because his nice, you know, banter and presentation and discussion with this other scripted jackass makes it seem like this guy's got our best interests in mind.

01:33:24.523 --> 01:33:26.144
He just wants us to understand.

01:33:26.484 --> 01:33:29.465
And since he's a Stanford biologist, we should just trust him.

01:33:29.545 --> 01:33:29.765
I mean.

01:33:30.145 --> 01:33:31.925
Are a relatively new technology.

01:33:32.426 --> 01:33:33.006
Controversial.

01:33:33.026 --> 01:33:34.946
A relatively new technology.

01:33:35.327 --> 01:33:36.007
Stop lying.

01:33:37.225 --> 01:33:37.866
It's not.

01:33:38.506 --> 01:33:50.539
It's old technology that is beyond the expiration date, beyond the limited applications have been used almost to exhaustion on the academic bench.

01:33:50.619 --> 01:33:52.081
This man is a fraud.

01:33:53.798 --> 01:34:01.581
because of their implementation during the COVID pandemic and indeed they're a new technology and we would not be here were it not for mRNA.

01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:09.043
mRNA vaccines are a relatively new technology controversial because of their implementation during the COVID pandemic.

01:34:09.463 --> 01:34:20.173
And indeed, there are people out there who either insist on or have evidence that they have vaccine injuries of some sort, and that has been the rationale for removing this $500 million of support for mRNA research.

01:34:20.753 --> 01:34:23.796
I'm gonna get some hate, I might get some love, doesn't really matter to me.

01:34:24.316 --> 01:34:31.843
What is important for me to say is that there is incredible work on non-COVID-related mRNA vaccines related to cancer.

01:34:32.023 --> 01:34:39.186
And non-COVID-related mRNA vaccines for cancer can work in a person who's already going to die.

01:34:39.926 --> 01:34:47.369
It can work as a limited form of understanding how to augment the immune system to a particular target and eliminate it.

01:34:47.429 --> 01:34:48.289
It can work.

01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:52.791
But those people don't turn back to their old selves.

01:34:52.831 --> 01:34:54.492
They don't live to be 110.

01:34:54.932 --> 01:35:00.514
They're not success stories except insofar as they were going to die acutely.

01:35:03.703 --> 01:35:10.147
This guy's lying just like the Human Genome Project lies when they say that they've completed the human genome.

01:35:10.167 --> 01:35:19.433
He's lying like they say when they have the full sequence of the virus that they found in the wild.

01:35:20.153 --> 01:35:21.074
He's lying.

01:35:21.194 --> 01:35:27.457
He doesn't even understand what he's lying about because he's only a scripted actor.

01:35:28.138 --> 01:35:31.540
And because he's one of these people that if you give him a book, he can learn it.

01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:34.690
and give him another book, he can learn it.

01:35:34.811 --> 01:35:40.375
He can follow a script and he can improvise even if the script is really big or, you know, he can jump around in it.

01:35:40.416 --> 01:35:41.937
He's a really bright guy.

01:35:42.397 --> 01:35:44.479
But what he is, is a script reader.

01:35:44.819 --> 01:35:50.645
He's not going to be able to tell you that, hey man, the Romulans, they're the same as the Vulcans.

01:35:50.685 --> 01:35:52.086
He's never going to say that.

01:35:54.178 --> 01:35:58.339
because it's not in the script, just like he's never going to say, you know, these are old technologies.

01:35:58.379 --> 01:36:02.660
Transfection is something that people have been using on the academic bench for years in mice and monkeys.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.181
And so to roll it out as and call it a vaccine is just ridiculous.

01:36:07.241 --> 01:36:08.101
It's disingenuous.

01:36:08.121 --> 01:36:09.321
We already had a name for it.

01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:15.823
And by the way, vaccine is a dumb word anyway, because it doesn't mean much if vaccines can be injected and inhaled and

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:22.616
and subcutaneous and intramuscular than what is a vaccine other than a tool or a vehicle, you know?

01:36:23.036 --> 01:36:28.086
And so this semantic game is being played by experts trained in the art.

01:36:30.401 --> 01:36:38.789
and related to neurologic conditions, and many genetic diseases, and many, many things for which we would be absolutely foolish to ignore the technology.

01:36:38.809 --> 01:36:39.770
Who's gonna hate you for that?

01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:41.951
Well, many people.

01:36:42.192 --> 01:36:46.515
And look, I've been a vaccine skeptic, I'm a skeptic of everything medical.

01:36:46.976 --> 01:36:49.818
Because everything medical, let me ask you one final question.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.741
How much do you think we know?

01:36:53.702 --> 01:36:54.682
Like if you had 100%,

01:36:56.684 --> 01:36:59.987
is everything we could possibly know about medicine and how the body works.

01:37:00.928 --> 01:37:03.510
My difference with a lot of people is they think we're like at 90%.

01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:06.132
I think we're at 20.

01:37:07.173 --> 01:37:09.335
I think we're at 10 at best.

01:37:09.355 --> 01:37:09.335
10!

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:11.577
And I'll give you a different answer.

01:37:12.057 --> 01:37:13.158
See how stupid it is?

01:37:13.678 --> 01:37:15.039
We made them say this.

01:37:15.854 --> 01:37:31.163
There is no doubt in my mind that these two monkeys have been scripted to say this because now they're going to go on to explain why that 10% that we do know is enough to justify all the certainty and Bravo that we show.

01:37:32.123 --> 01:37:34.705
Bravado, excuse me, right?

01:37:35.285 --> 01:37:44.931
All the certainty, all the, the, the, the arrogance that we demonstrate is all based on the idea that that 10% is apparently more than enough.

01:37:46.169 --> 01:37:56.536
It's more than enough for him to call himself a neuroscientist, more than enough for him to start a podcast and tell everybody about everything that he knows, because we know at least 10% of all the knowledge out there.

01:37:56.636 --> 01:37:57.717
Come on, guys.

01:37:58.298 --> 01:38:03.922
And I'm not trying to undercut the careers and trust in my friends who are physicians and scientists.

01:38:03.982 --> 01:38:05.082
I'm a scientist.

01:38:05.102 --> 01:38:06.343
I'm still tenured at Stanford.

01:38:06.403 --> 01:38:07.504
And I love science.

01:38:07.544 --> 01:38:08.245
I love medicine.

01:38:08.285 --> 01:38:12.228
And I believe in certain medications and supplements and nutrition and behaviors.

01:38:12.648 --> 01:38:14.009
I do think all of it's important.

01:38:14.449 --> 01:38:16.170
That hedging was fantastic.

01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:17.690
I gotta play it again, it's so funny.

01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.091
What a clown.

01:38:19.111 --> 01:38:19.511
What a clown.

01:38:19.551 --> 01:38:22.993
I mean, he's tenured at Stanford, but he doesn't even have a frickin' lab anymore.

01:38:23.073 --> 01:38:23.793
How can you explain that?

01:38:42.947 --> 01:38:50.934
How can he be on this different track of tenure professor where he gets to go on Bill Maher and be a podcast guy?

01:38:51.275 --> 01:38:54.958
Because we are being governed by podcast actors, that's why.

01:38:58.442 --> 01:39:00.844
And behaviors, I do think all of it's important.

01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:17.943
A good friend of mine, who's a chair of neurosurgery, perhaps one of the greatest neurosurgeons ever to live, I asked him, I said, what percentage of the information in medical school textbooks in the United States and elsewhere is inaccurate, is just false, and we know it?

01:39:18.163 --> 01:39:18.744
And he said,

01:39:19.605 --> 01:39:22.167
at least half, given the new information.

01:39:22.587 --> 01:39:31.372
And then a good friend of mine said to him in the same conversation, what do you think the impact of that is on human health and the treatment of disease, et cetera?

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:32.853
And he said, incalculable.

01:39:33.454 --> 01:39:36.335
We are still in our infancy of understanding.

01:39:36.576 --> 01:39:38.877
That is not to say we haven't made great discoveries.

01:39:39.037 --> 01:39:43.160
And I should say, it's not to say that the NIH is a failure, and elsewhere.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:47.543
is inaccurate, is just false, and we know it.

01:39:47.743 --> 01:39:51.786
And he said, at least half, given the new information.

01:39:52.186 --> 01:40:00.973
And then a good friend of mine said to him in the same conversation, what do you think the impact of that is on human health and the treatment of disease, et cetera?

01:40:01.033 --> 01:40:02.454
And he said, incalculable.

01:40:03.055 --> 01:40:05.937
We are still in our infancy of understanding.

01:40:06.197 --> 01:40:08.079
That is not to say we haven't made great discoveries.

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:09.380
And I should say.

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.163
So isn't it interesting that despite this statement,

01:40:14.116 --> 01:40:22.743
We are supposed to believe that there aren't fundamental, ridiculous things about the way that we do things.

01:40:24.124 --> 01:40:30.149
We've got most of the big things right, but you know, all the subtle details are in the last 90%.

01:40:30.349 --> 01:40:41.358
It's not possible that we're doing something, I don't know, like, you know, putting a quart of oil over the top of the engine, just to make sure that everything runs fine.

01:40:41.379 --> 01:40:42.980
You know, extra oil can't hurt.

01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:46.341
That's what he sounds like.

01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:51.088
He sounds like a mechanic that is pretty sure about 10% of the stuff in the car.

01:40:51.449 --> 01:40:53.552
And so he's pretty confident that he can fix it.

01:40:54.775 --> 01:40:58.077
It's pretty confident that not a lot's, oh wait, no, I'm sorry.

01:40:58.437 --> 01:41:06.862
It's incalculable how much damage that's doing to your car, but I'm gonna go ahead and pour that oil on top of the engine anyway.

01:41:06.922 --> 01:41:12.305
I'm gonna go ahead and put some sugar in the gas tank because maybe the gas needs to be a little sweeter.

01:41:12.625 --> 01:41:13.045
You know what?

01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:19.809
I think I'm gonna go ahead and put the Armor All, you know, squirt it right in the injector because who knows what will happen.

01:41:20.469 --> 01:41:23.771
Maybe there, I need some WD-40 in places that it's missing.

01:41:25.404 --> 01:41:30.729
This is the kind of bullshit, two-sided, that's ridiculous what he's saying.

01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:47.403
It's ridiculous that he thinks that with just 10%, which of course is a gross overestimate of what we know about our irreducibly complex biology, but it's enough to proceed.

01:41:47.523 --> 01:41:49.966
It's enough to push forward.

01:41:50.006 --> 01:41:51.247
It's enough to insist.

01:41:52.984 --> 01:41:58.025
That's how you can see that it's a scripted actor because his script doesn't make sense and he's reading it anyway.

01:42:00.466 --> 01:42:02.807
You know, that's how you, that's how you see it.

01:42:04.307 --> 01:42:09.589
And unless you are a biologist and you've been working hard on it for a long time, you're not going to see it.

01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:15.050
This is just going to be for 80% of the Western population that sees this video.

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:16.070
It'll just make sense.

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:17.251
It'll sound reasonable.

01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:21.652
It'll sound like two people that are kind of admitting that they didn't know everything.

01:42:23.456 --> 01:42:25.978
It's malevolence, ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:26.419 --> 01:42:29.001
It's not to say that the NIH is a failed endeavor.

01:42:29.061 --> 01:42:32.664
It has returned beautifully in many areas of science and medicine.

01:42:33.044 --> 01:42:39.089
I do think an audit and a revision of what we're doing, a careful audit and revision is great, but we can't just throw things out because of what they're called.

01:42:43.653 --> 01:42:47.016
It's a malevolent, malevolent place we are in, ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:47.397 --> 01:42:48.718
It's a very malevolent place.

01:42:49.719 --> 01:42:57.188
And so I got involved in the COVID sort of dissonance side of things because when I saw how they were using PCR and COVID, I realized it was a fraud.

01:42:57.369 --> 01:43:00.332
Like we run PCR on cannabis plants all day long.

01:43:00.352 --> 01:43:01.894
This is our bread and butter.

01:43:01.934 --> 01:43:04.458
We make tests that look for pathogens on cannabis like that.

01:43:05.258 --> 01:43:18.346
Now one thing that I'm gonna let this play without actually listening to him I could dissect this part of the interview because it's important for some of the things that he says But what I want you to understand and make no mistake about it This is how bad it is.

01:43:18.846 --> 01:43:32.014
This guy two days ago was at a cannabis genetics conference talking exclusively about cannabis virions and cannabis production and cannabis genetics and cannabis cannabis cannabis now

01:43:32.774 --> 01:43:40.857
Just like Mary Holland has pivoted to politics and electromagnetic radiation and all this other health freedom bullshit.

01:43:41.637 --> 01:43:46.258
Just like the Donald Trump stuff is always moving and kicking the can around and whatever.

01:43:48.079 --> 01:43:50.880
This guy is a scripted national security actor.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.881
He's helping to undermine the American civilian population with confusion.

01:43:57.482 --> 01:43:58.742
And he's scripted to do so.

01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:09.531
What you would hear here is a scripted, malevolent presence on the internet that is only served to the people who need it.

01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:21.484
But his role in the Human Genome Project, contrasted to his role since 2020 in this, marks this whole thing as a national security theater.

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:24.753
We were privileged to one part of it.

01:44:25.013 --> 01:44:32.563
The rest of the country was privileged to the part on TV and more mainstream media and their own social media feeds.

01:44:32.583 --> 01:44:33.244
It doesn't matter.

01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:39.433
This is a scripted, scripted actor.

01:44:41.553 --> 01:44:44.234
And it's terrible what he is scripted to say.

01:44:44.254 --> 01:44:47.395
They changed every single uracil out with pseudouridine.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.116
That completely changes the function of that RNA.

01:44:50.216 --> 01:44:51.496
Yep, pseudouridine.

01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:59.078
And he's going to repeat it over and over again and of course that's completely inaccurate because it's N1-methyl-pseudouridine.

01:44:59.118 --> 01:45:01.839
And the moment I bring up the volume, that's what he's saying.

01:45:02.827 --> 01:45:06.710
And that's what he said on podcast after podcast after podcast.

01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:17.197
And we just heard Bill Maher and the professor from Stanford talk about it without even the precision of using a pseudouridine as part of the not-so-perfect.

01:45:17.297 --> 01:45:19.819
No one's talking about the codon optimization.

01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:29.766
Nobody's talking about the three-dimensional structure and how that could change the tertiary structure of the protein that results because, you know, ribosomes also do some shit.

01:45:32.361 --> 01:45:39.683
Nobody's talking about the impurities like whatever driving sequence would have been used.

01:45:39.743 --> 01:45:44.784
Whatever sequence of promoter region would have been used to drive the plasmid copying.

01:45:45.264 --> 01:45:55.167
And the idea that they always knew that would be in there if they used recombinant DNA plasmids in a bacterial culture to manufacture the RNA.

01:45:55.267 --> 01:45:56.247
This guy knew

01:45:56.787 --> 01:46:06.914
that that process would result in a DNA contamination, an endotoxin contamination, and a tail of impure micro RNAs that would result from the noise.

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:10.056
He knew about all of that at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:46:10.076 --> 01:46:15.680
So he knew that even in its best form, transfection would not be appropriate for healthy humans.

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:23.685
And he also knew that due to the manufacturing choices that were made during the pandemic, there was no way in Sam hell that this would be a pure

01:46:24.385 --> 01:46:27.308
RNA, and so all of these other caveats applied.

01:46:27.708 --> 01:46:40.177
And yet it's only in 2023 that he started saying it, and in 2025 that he's been hailed as a hero on a podcast for saying that SV40, so I sequenced it, it showed up, it's actually in there.

01:46:40.498 --> 01:46:41.879
Well, no shit, Sherlock!

01:46:42.259 --> 01:46:48.824
You knew it would have been in there from the very beginning because you, like Mike Yeadon and Jonathan Engler and Maraber Malone,

01:46:49.284 --> 01:47:11.074
are all experts on the manufacture of protein biologics so you knew that they couldn't use anion exchange chromatography to purify the RNA from the DNA because that's not how chemistry works so these people are scripted actors that have brought a fake populist conservative movement to the brink of disaster

01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:22.552
while at the same time a similar set of coordinated scripted actors has brought the Trump derangement syndrome to a new crescendo.

01:47:23.905 --> 01:47:29.248
That's where America is right now as a result of people like Kevin McKernan.

01:47:29.628 --> 01:47:33.611
And these guys just said, oh, we're just gonna change all of them and then inject it and see what happens.

01:47:33.711 --> 01:47:40.895
And you know, you change that one methyl group in the course of trying to build DNA sequencers and your whole sequencer will fall apart.

01:47:41.195 --> 01:47:46.859
I mean, the enzymes are that sensitive to a single methyl group being placed on some of these pieces of DNA.

01:47:47.279 --> 01:47:52.242
You put 800 of them on the RNA that you're doing, you are in completely unknown territory.

01:47:53.242 --> 01:47:59.626
with how that RNA is gonna fold, how it's gonna be processed in the cell, the RNA interference pathways it's gonna kick off.

01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:17.138
And we're supposed to believe that he couldn't have said this in 2020, when he was primarily scripted to say that the FDA is in the way, and that the PCR test that the WHO is using isn't right, and it's not fair because they're overcycling, and he explained it to, you know, all these people for a couple years.

01:48:17.998 --> 01:48:18.639
Stop lying!

01:48:21.574 --> 01:48:45.302
So when I saw what they're doing like this is complete reckless insanity that they're doing and no one's no one's raising their hand about it Which is frustrating because you're in a field and you look around so frustrating that so many Americans were fooled so many Americans were injured that he went to a cannabis conference and spent the whole weekend presenting about the genetics of variants in care and in cannabis because you know

01:48:46.122 --> 01:48:55.626
I can't, he can't spend his whole time, you know, with all of his money and patents and sold companies and fat house on the Atlantic ocean.

01:48:55.946 --> 01:49:02.829
He can't possibly spend most of his time trying to save people from, from, I don't know, some mass poisoning.

01:49:02.869 --> 01:49:04.430
He's got to also run his business.

01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:08.212
You know, it's just a, his, his dissident thing is just a part-time thing.

01:49:08.232 --> 01:49:12.174
You know, it's not that the priorities, you know, I got to do other things.

01:49:12.214 --> 01:49:13.134
I got to keep,

01:49:13.314 --> 01:49:15.255
keep all these different balls in the air.

01:49:15.795 --> 01:49:21.817
If these people in the health freedom movement actually believed what they were fighting for, they would be all in.

01:49:21.877 --> 01:49:23.217
And they're not all in.

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:31.200
Somebody with one hundred thousand subscribers on Substack who retweets Robert Malone is not all in.

01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:37.662
Except if you mean like an operator all in, a national security scripted actor all in.

01:49:37.722 --> 01:49:39.223
None of your peers are talking about this.

01:49:39.503 --> 01:49:39.723
Right.

01:49:39.803 --> 01:49:41.684
And you're like, is everyone in on this?

01:49:41.724 --> 01:49:42.464
Like what's going on?

01:49:42.764 --> 01:49:42.844
And

01:49:44.249 --> 01:49:47.072
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth.

01:49:48.534 --> 01:49:49.515
It definitely is.

01:49:50.556 --> 01:49:53.219
They use non-specific PCR tests.

01:49:53.279 --> 01:49:54.040
That's how they did it.

01:49:55.501 --> 01:49:57.864
And it's been all murder and lies, basically.

01:49:58.985 --> 01:50:02.208
I'm actually going to escape for a second and put the real song on here.

01:50:02.268 --> 01:50:03.229
Hold on one second.

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:05.832
Because I really like chips.

01:50:06.855 --> 01:50:09.036
And so I had it muted, but I'm not going to mute it.

01:50:09.056 --> 01:50:13.199
I was going to play the old song, but today we're not going out with the regular song.

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:16.220
We are going out with a different song because I love chips.

01:50:17.281 --> 01:50:24.745
And it's Mike's birthday today, so I don't know why, but I just think this is Mike's birthday song.

01:50:25.205 --> 01:50:26.206
Mike is one year old.

01:50:27.627 --> 01:50:28.548
He's still growing.

01:50:28.588 --> 01:50:35.874
He's a tiny little dog, so I keep telling him, you know, you better go to sleep and grow because otherwise I'm taking you back to the store and getting a bigger dog.

01:50:36.955 --> 01:50:40.257
Ladies and gentlemen, it's for all the marbles, for all the children of Earth.

01:50:40.998 --> 01:50:42.620
Don't forget that there's a red trap.

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:57.967
um and it is completely nonsense and there's a blue trap and it's also completely nonsense but we're all in a trap and unfortunately right now current events make this this this side feel like

01:50:59.068 --> 01:51:00.429
They were less fooled than us.

01:51:00.509 --> 01:51:03.893
And so we're in a little dangerous position, but I do think there's common ground.

01:51:04.294 --> 01:51:06.056
Intramuscular injections, a dumb idea.

01:51:06.116 --> 01:51:07.898
Transfection was an old technology.

01:51:08.018 --> 01:51:09.139
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:51:09.159 --> 01:51:11.843
And autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:51:12.283 --> 01:51:14.626
And these anti-vaxxers tricked us with that.

01:51:15.106 --> 01:51:16.108
So thanks for being here.

01:51:16.508 --> 01:51:18.669
You guys are trapped in a national security theater.

01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:20.089
You don't need that reminding me.

01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:22.410
I'm going to see you guys tomorrow because tomorrow's Tuesday.

01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:23.590
Thanks for being here.

01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:25.391
Don't forget to download the PeerTube app.

01:51:25.411 --> 01:51:26.211
We're live there.

01:51:27.272 --> 01:51:32.653
If you look and try to put in the URL, you won't be able to do it until you are given a button.

01:51:32.794 --> 01:51:39.936
So look for other platforms and then put in stream.gigaohm.bio and then it will say it can't find the platform.

01:51:40.416 --> 01:51:44.598
And then if you look underneath, you will see a button that says enter URL.

01:51:44.638 --> 01:51:45.598
And when you click on that,

01:51:46.119 --> 01:51:49.896
Then when you put this in, Bob will definitely be your uncle.

01:51:50.096 --> 01:51:50.800
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:53:05.785 --> 01:53:08.990
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:53:09.391 --> 01:53:10.092
Stop lying!
