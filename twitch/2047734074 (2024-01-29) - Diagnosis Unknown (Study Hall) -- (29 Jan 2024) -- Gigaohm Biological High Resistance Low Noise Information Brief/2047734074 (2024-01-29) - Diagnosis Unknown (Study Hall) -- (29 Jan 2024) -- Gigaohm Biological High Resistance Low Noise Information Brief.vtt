WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hell's thing 1, 2, tells 2, 1, 2...

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
BEEP BEEP!

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
LAUGHTER

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Ahem...

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
That should be okay...

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Yes...

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
That should be just best...

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Ahem...

00:30.000 --> 00:42.000
I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
and I should point out that actually we are, in an interesting sense,

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
So, if I'm correct, you, Robert, have had COVID.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I've had COVID.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Technically speaking in the chat, I am Katniss.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's first, Kristi...

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I've been vaccinated.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You missed it by a hair, I'm afraid.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Alright, I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
and the data actually, shocking as this will be to some people,

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
at preventing people from contracting COVID when taken properly.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
So, aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't real,

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
and I have every reason to think it was, it certainly appears to be the genuine article.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity,

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
where through three different routes, COVID, vaccine, and ivermectin, we are protected,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
and you are doubly protected.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
So, I would just say that for anybody who's enthusiastic about the vaccines,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
if you're unconvinced by what we have to say about the hazard of them,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
one thing to consider is that the way to get society to herd immunity,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction, which ought to be our goal,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
the way to do it is to get people into this category one way or the other.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Whether that's through prophylaxis, whether it's through a vaccine,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
or whether it's because they've had COVID already.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
One could argue that if everybody just took ivermectin for a month,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
worldwide, really independent.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And someone will find the title that I have given in this episode.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I would ask them to stick with the episode.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm telling you why I titled this idea.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
I really believe that actually we have the capacity at any moment we decide to utilize it

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
to end the pandemic and that it is well within reach

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
should we choose to see what is in front of us.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
What I want is high morbidity.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I want people to complain.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
What I do, I go to Des Moines.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I live there for four years. I go to Des Moines.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I infect a couple of Sentinel cases in Des Moines.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I go to Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Annie Wershing was my friend in Chicago in the time before I moved to the Netherlands.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And we worked at the same bar called Shuba's.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
We spent about two years together as friends, whatever.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
We had a lot of good times with a lot of different people.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
It was a really interesting time in my life as a bartender and a high school teacher

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
and not really knowing what I wanted to be yet.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
And she moved to LA, met Steve in Chicago before she moved to LA.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
He's a voice actor.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
She had to take the shot to be on that set upstairs up there.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
And she got a pretty advanced brain cancer and died on January 29th, 2023.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm 100% sure it's because she was forced to be transfected and boosted in order to be on set in Hollywood.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
And they did it to a lot of people and they did it with a worst-case scenario narrative.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
They're all guilty.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm not going to do that.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm not going to do that.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm not doing that.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I'm not doing that.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm not doing that.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm not doing that.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I am not going to do that.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I've not done that.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I think I've never done it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I think I've never done that.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I think I've never gone.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I've never gone.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I think I've never gone.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I think I've never gone.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I think I've never gotten.

05:25.000 --> 05:50.000
This schedule for 60 minutes next is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I feel so nervous. Like what in the world, man?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Ooh, we had a little glitch there. We got to catch up on that one.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
There we go. I think that's good.

07:17.000 --> 07:46.000
So a little bit rusty here, a little bit rocky road here.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Sorry about that. We are getting another show in tonight.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
I thought I would do a little relaxing one instead of always trying to be so on point.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
Mark Housatonic did a wonderful short video today on his third channel on YouTube.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
If you haven't checked it out, I would highly recommend it.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
He may have cleaned it up and put it on some of his other channels.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
And if that's the case, then also make sure to check those out as well.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
That's a little loud to me, but we'll see here.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I can definitely see the brick wall at the back of the theater. I hope you can see it too.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
We are becoming more and more the biology that is much easier for them to ignore.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
The new pivot is to ignore us.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
So we're just going to keep doing the work that we're doing.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
We're just going to keep talking to the talk and walking the walk.

08:56.000 --> 09:05.000
If they can't keep up, they're not going to get rained on them because they're all stuck in the cave.

09:05.000 --> 09:14.000
So if we make our way out, and other people don't follow, I don't think we really have to worry about it too much yet.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
After we've mapped this all the way out, we can help the rest of the people get out of there.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
This stream is brought to you by a patch clamp physiologist, retired.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
A patch clamp physiologist is an expert of making giga-ohm seals with...

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
Borosilic and glass pipettes and making very high-resistance low-noise recordings from neurons.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Sometimes the live brain slices are even live animals, and so that's why we decided to call this the giga-ohm biological,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
high-resistance low-noise information brief.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
You can find me located at giga-ohmbiological.com and you can communicate with me at gigaohm.bio.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
At the website, you can find my confession at that link called Scooby,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
and you can find a way of supporting me in a number of different ways.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
A single link, a schedule, and then at the bottom there are ways to subscribe, either monthly, quarterly, or annually,

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
and it would just be wonderful if we could get enough people to do that,

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
so we could just keep this going two or three times a day.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
Right now, I think I can swing one, and soon we're going to have one plus a PDF once a week.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
I think sooner or later, every one of these is going to be up on sub-stack.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I did take the weekend off because we had a lot of basketball games,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
but we're going to get back in the groove again here.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
These are the supporters of giga-ohmbiological that make it possible.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
This list has not been updated in the last couple days,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
so don't be too ashamed or rather too upset if your name wasn't there yet,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
because that's just a matter of having too many things.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I just converted my garage for a new cat.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
A new cat, what does that mean?

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
A new cat is a little nicer than my new cat.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
You're going to tell me what a new what would you convert your garage for a new cat is.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
We're going to break this illusion of consensus.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We're in the fifth year. Don't forget to point that out to people.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, a new car, okay, yeah, yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
And I don't even know who can afford a new car nowadays.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That's pretty impressive.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
This was probably a conflated background signal.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Just remember that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
with the incentive augmenting the immune system.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Transmission in healthy humans is permanently negligent,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
and it is the 29th of January, 2024.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
This is the going biologically high-resistance low-noise information

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
we brought to you by a biologist.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
We're fighting against this faith in a novel virus that supposedly killed millions,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
but millions more were saved from.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
It likely came from gain of function, and therefore we'll come again.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
We can't tell this story to our kids, even if the TV wants us to,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
and the way to break this cycle is to teach them the biology that includes

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
there's no evidence for spreading New York City infectious clones are the only real threat.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
placebo batches were likely distributed in transmission and healthy mammals is dumb.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
You can remind them that the protocols were mostly murdered,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
gain of function is mostly mythology,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
and the scooby-doo that is being fooled into solving a mystery is real

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
because these people are spectacularly committed to lies.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, this is actually a separate room in the back of my garage.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
It used to be, I guess, a wood shop or something like that.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's got a lot of outlets.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
It's got its own separate heater and air conditioner,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
and it's kind of got a separate entry door with locks on both sides.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It's really like an add-on.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
It's a really weird, lucky thing to be in the back of my garage.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
I have a renting house in Pittsburgh that I had to take because I had to give up the house

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
that I was renting to own because I lost my position at the University of Pittsburgh.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
I've heard other stories of people losing their homes,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
but I think I've got the one real legitimate.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
Anyways, let me switch out of this one.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm just going to switch out of this one,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
and I will drop in the other one.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
So that's probably a copyrighted song, and something's going to get screwed up there.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I had that mixed in, correct.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And then, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
This is Giga Own Biological, a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
I am the biologist bringing you that show from the back of his garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
I am fighting against a few things.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm fighting against tyranny of the mind.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm fighting against misleading the young.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm fighting against this manipulation of our organized habits and opinions.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
And I believe that for quite some time, our society has been manipulated and led to believe in a mythology about public health

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
under the pretense that eventually they were going to shake up our world and start governing us by this mythology.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I believe we are at that pivot point right now.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
I believe we should have woken up much sooner that we were in this pivot point, but we did not.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And that is kind of a pity, but you know what can you do about it?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
We're here now, and we've got to make the best of it.

14:44.000 --> 14:52.000
The principle of informed consent has been ignored for the duration of the pandemic, and that can be one place to start with our young people.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
We can also start with just kind of analogy to try and convince them that this elaborate act that they saw in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
that was kind of like an emergency, kind of like a tornado drill, kind of like a weird, I don't know.

15:09.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, it seemed a little forced. And then also the drama between the public health officials and Donald Trump and them laughing behind him and stuff like this.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
This was all about creating this mystery that you were supposed to solve to try and figure out what were these people up to.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
Were they trying to hide anything and then getting into arguments in front of people that was all about this.

15:33.000 --> 15:52.000
So we know that this pandemic was created by a series of orchestrated plans over a long and a short time scale from seating scientific programs and peer reviewed publications to, to, to form the foundation of pandemic potential

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
to running government level exercises to respond to pandemic potential.

15:56.000 --> 16:16.000
And then to have this team of worst case scenario actors on TV and on social media from 2019 ready to go so that when the media and the narrative needed controlling that these people were already there as trusted voices in these alternative spaces.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
And I believe these are one of the reasons these people are a very important reason why a number of people were taken behind the scenes early on.

16:26.000 --> 16:38.000
You may not be aware of the fact that they rolled out the shots in Hollywood on Hollywood sets earlier than they rolled it out in other places.

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
It's similar to how it has been reported by certain people from behind the scenes that it was rolled out on movies.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
I mean, TV news sets.

16:49.000 --> 16:59.000
In other words, TV news programs and the people that participated and worked on staff were kind of more or less coerced into taking the shot.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
And they were coerced by two things. One, that they were essential workers.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
And number two, that they were being given very special batches of the countermeasure.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Most or all of them got Moderna. They did this on Hollywood sets.

17:15.000 --> 17:25.000
And in fact, I know from firsthand accounts that they did it at Hollywood parties over the Christmas season during 2020.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
I want you to think about that very carefully because not very many people know that.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
It's even possible that Annie took one of those shots because she was offered one of them in a situation like that.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
But for sure, all of the lowest level people on Hollywood sets were required to take the shot in order to even be on set.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Never mind masking.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
And so this enforced a narrative among people. It enforced a narrative among an entire culture.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
And that it shouldn't be underestimated how difficult it is to get past that.

18:04.000 --> 18:16.000
And that's why I do this thing with Star Trek because I really, I had always had the idea that I was going to do some kind of Star Trek episode

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
and make it about immunology. And then I was going to send it to Annie and it was going to stop this whole thing.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
And she was going to help and it was going to get on Instagram and it was going to be all this big deal.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
Total plan. It was all laid out. I knew what I was going to do.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
And it was too late but wasn't going to save her family. But, you know, I didn't know.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
And then it just got on the back burner and on the back burner and it never happened and never happened.

18:45.000 --> 18:54.000
And then suddenly I was reminded of the fact that I had this idea to do a Star Trek episode episode from the future.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Like a message from the future.

18:57.000 --> 19:08.000
And I got the recall because I found out that she was on this this Picard show where she was a Borg Queen who helped them travel back in time

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
to like reset the past so that the bad future didn't happen where Picard was like a bad guy.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
It was such a weird thing because then I was like, oh my gosh, that's kind of my idea.

19:20.000 --> 19:31.000
It was to call back from the future and say that somebody had taught the wrong immunology to the human race in order to ruin the Federation of Planets

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
before it could ever form.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
So bizarre.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And now she's gone.

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
All gone. Like just vanished. Just like Nathan. A whole beautiful family without a parent. Forever.

19:46.000 --> 19:53.000
Because of this. Because of bad ideas. Not because of the spread of an RNA.

19:54.000 --> 20:17.000
I am absolutely, absolutely serious when I say that I'm probably going to die crazy or angry or jaded unless something absolutely amazing happens in my lifetime.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
And I'm fine. I am totally fine with it taking the rest of my lifetime, me being 52 yesterday.

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
I am totally fine with it taking the most of the rest of my lifetime in order for this to reset itself.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
For us to go back to a time when our children could be innocent and biology was sacred.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
I am totally fine with that.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But I'm not fine with this not ever going back.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
I'm not fine with my kids growing up in a world with this kind of duality.

20:56.000 --> 21:12.000
This kind of lack of respect. Lack of reverence. I'm not going to allow it to happen and I hope you won't either.

21:12.000 --> 21:23.000
Lots of interesting things. Lots of interesting things happening. Some good, some bad, some questionable, some weird.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
We've talked about a lot of it and this is the most important part of it.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
They ignore this. All of them ignore this. You can call me a lot of different names.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
But in reality, this is the message that I care about.

21:39.000 --> 21:54.000
This is the message I want to give to our kids. This is the message that I'd love if we could get to college age kids before they take their HPV shot to stay on campus or something like that.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
Or actually there are quite a few universities that might make them take a COVID booster in order to be on campus.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
So I wanted to do a little recap here just to make sure to remind you number one.

22:07.000 --> 22:21.000
The last couple of days we did a couple Ralph Barrick videos where we showed that in 2007 it still seemed like he was trying to use coronavirus to kind of harness it as a biotechnology.

22:21.000 --> 22:41.000
And he saw it as a resource. He saw it as something that he could manipulate genetically so that he could control it.

22:41.000 --> 22:59.000
He could attenuate it and keep it attenuated. It could be a universal vaccine. He was looking at combinations of antibodies that could be universally prophylactic or universally neutralizing against these pathogens across lots of different subtypes.

23:00.000 --> 23:14.000
And he wasn't talking about it as a doomsday kind of problem. He was talking about it by a very tractable set of biological questions and a couple really firm ideas about how to tackle the problem.

23:14.000 --> 23:26.000
We could make fast, live attenuated vaccines using recombinant viruses that have their translation regulatory sequences altered.

23:26.000 --> 23:40.000
And we can also generate monoclonal antibodies from these recombinant viruses in vitro and then make those monoclonal antibodies and use them as prophylactic or as countermeasures.

23:41.000 --> 23:53.000
And so in 2007, all the way up to like 2016, he's pretty much talking about it as though it's not a big deal. And then around 2016, it starts to become this potential for pandemics.

23:54.000 --> 24:16.000
It starts to become this potential for catastrophe. And they start to have these discussions about the regulation of their work and almost protest too much about the regulation of their work and come up with pretty extreme examples of how in the worst case scenario,

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
regulation of our work could end up making a catastrophe much worse than it should have been if you wouldn't regulate our work.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
And this went on through 2018 and right up into the start of the pandemic. So what I wanted to-

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
What I want is high morbidity.

24:32.000 --> 24:45.000
As I point this out, one of the things that I wanted to remind you is that the second line here, the pre-narrative pre-coopted or pre-selected group of narrative controllers,

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
I wanted you to do a thought experiment with me. And I found a TV show that I think will help us. Actually, I shouldn't say I found it.

24:52.000 --> 25:03.000
One of your fellow viewers and GigaOM fans found this TV show and thought it would be a very relevant thought experiment for us to do in order to think about how,

25:03.000 --> 25:13.000
with a pre-selected group of narrative controllers, you could make a bunch of people believe something very, very wrong for a very, very long time.

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
So let's check this out. I think this is going to be a really instructive little thing. I'm probably not going to have to talk very much, so I'm going to enjoy my tea.

25:21.000 --> 25:32.000
I'm going to take some notes and every once in a while I might stop to say something. So if you have a particular question that you want answered and you don't mind typing it into the chat,

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
maybe every once in a while I can stop and answer something if it's a good question.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
Then it becomes a round saying there's probably good questions I'll ignore, but we can do a little Q&A too as we watch this video.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I think you're really going to enjoy it.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
There we go.

26:36.000 --> 26:47.000
Public health officials must race to solve the mystery to track the source of this deadly infection before it can kill again.

26:48.000 --> 26:56.000
All right, you see what I mean? This can be good. We're going to learn how public health was done before the pandemic.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Some of the names in this program have been changed.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
December, 1979.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
A cross town bus in Madison, Wisconsin.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
A young woman by all appearances in perfect health. Until.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Her collapse was sudden and terrifying.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Unconscious, barely breathing.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
The young woman lay sprawled out in the aisle.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
Responding within minutes, paramedics rush to the scene.

28:05.000 --> 28:14.000
And what they found concerned them.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
The young woman had a high fever. Her pulse was weak and her blood pressure was dropping rapidly.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
Fortunately, the University of Wisconsin Medical Center was only moments away.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
By the time they reached the emergency room, she was going into shock.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
The ER staff would have to work fast.

28:48.000 --> 29:07.000
They had no clues to work with.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
Only a driver's license with her name, Emily Murray, and her age, just 18 years old.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Because clues to her disease will be in her wallet.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
Meanwhile, her blood pressure was continuing to plummet.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
And an odd pink rash had appeared on her face and hands.

29:31.000 --> 29:39.000
As the ER team fought to stabilize her, throat and blood cultures as well as blood samples were sent off to the lab.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
The cultures would take 24 hours to grow.

29:43.000 --> 29:59.000
Emily was moved to the Intensive Care Unit, where she was placed on kidney dialysis and her vital signs could be closely monitored.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
She seemed to stabilize, and then her case took a strange turn.

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
The mysterious rash became more pronounced. It now covered her entire body.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Urologist Dr. Russell Chesney was called in.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
His first priority to bring her out of shock, to figure out what was going on.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
I knew that I had never seen anybody look quite like this.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
She had this rash, this sunburn rash, and it was spreading.

30:35.000 --> 30:48.000
It was something that was affecting all of her organs. She had bad lungs, she had shock, she had profound diarrhea, she had kidney failure.

30:48.000 --> 30:58.000
The sudden onset of Emily's symptoms and the bizarre red rash made Dr. Chesney suspect she had contracted a severe infection.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
There was no time to wait for lab results. He had to act immediately and aggressively.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Do you know where you are?

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
So we treated her with a very broad spectrum of antibiotics, kind of a shotgun approach, if you will.

31:15.000 --> 31:28.000
And we wanted to make sure that if this were an infection, that we were preventing it from spreading and that we were preventing the organisms from persisting.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
He's not thinking about transmission and thinking about her being sick from something that is interesting.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
Trying to find any possible clue to what had made her so sick.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
The parents really indicated that she hadn't been exposed to anything. There was nobody else in the family sick.

31:48.000 --> 31:57.000
She had some siblings and they were perfectly well. And the parents were perfectly well. Nobody was sick at school.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
And that's really intriguing.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
Examining Emily's chest x-rays, Dr. Chesney tried to understand what had happened.

32:05.000 --> 32:16.000
Her cardiac silhouette is not that full, it's narrow like we would see with shock. And she certainly doesn't have congestive heart failure or anything. There are no curly B lines.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
What he saw was perplexing. It didn't make any sense.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
The thing that was confusing to us and looking at her chest, it was clear she didn't have pneumonia.

32:27.000 --> 32:36.000
And she also didn't have a collapse of her lungs or anything like that. What she actually had was, she had hemorrhage from the lung.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
Emily's lungs were bleeding. It was hard for her to breathe.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
Dr. Chesney recognized this was a dangerous and potentially deadly complication.

32:47.000 --> 32:57.000
But Chesney had no idea what the cause was. The more he learned about her case, the more baffled he became.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Her symptoms seemed random, disconnected.

33:02.000 --> 33:11.000
It was the nightmare of any parent. That morning their daughter had left the house a healthy teenager.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Now she was hooked up to IV lines and monitors.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Put her on a vent. Holy shit, yeah.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Luckily, IV fluids and dialysis eventually began to help.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
I don't know why they're letting the parents see her and they're going to get sick.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
And their blood pressure started to rise to a safer level.

33:28.000 --> 33:37.000
And it stayed there for an hour or two and I felt comfortable in going home and trying to find out more about this.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
With the patient finally stable, Chesney could concentrate on the diagnosis.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
He sought a second opinion from his wife.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
Dr. Joan Chesney is the head of the infectious disease division at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine.

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
It would have been funny if they had went like, his wife is a competitive baker.

34:03.000 --> 34:13.000
The patient's high fever, diarrhea and dehydration were all classic symptoms of an infection.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
But she has a lot of other extra features that just don't make sense.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Well, one of the things she has is a rash that is spreading like crazy.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
Total body rash, angry looking. I really can't figure what's going on.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
To Dr. Joan Chesney, the symptoms sounded familiar.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I recommend cooking.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Does she have bright red eyes?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
A red rash and red eyes.

34:41.000 --> 34:47.000
It reminded Joan of a journal article she had recently seen by a doctor in Colorado.

34:47.000 --> 34:57.000
The article outlined a new syndrome called toxic shock, characterized by shock, a rash and multi-organ disease.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
The illness was linked to a toxin produced by the bacteria staphylococcus aureus.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
The disease was named toxic shock syndrome.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
In extreme cases, it could be fatal.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
The next morning, Joan Chesney came in to examine Emily Murray.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
In her 11-year studying infectious diseases, she had never seen anything like it.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
Blood vessels became inflamed when the bacteria released its toxins, causing a rash that covered Emily's entire body.

35:31.000 --> 35:42.000
In the journal article, the staph aureus bacteria was described as infecting the patient's bodies through an open wound.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
But Emily did not have any cuts or wounds for the bacteria to infect, so where had it come from?

35:49.000 --> 36:00.000
My biggest question was, is this toxic shock syndrome, as he described it, but I was very skeptical about the staph aureus, particularly because she didn't have any infection site.

36:00.000 --> 36:08.000
Emily did have many of the same symptoms. She even developed small hemorrhages in her eyes.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Chesney was determined to unravel this medical mystery.

36:12.000 --> 36:21.000
The other bacterial infections that can cause shock and multi-system disease, but they don't generally cause the rash or the red eyes.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
So it was one of those things that you just had a sixth sense that there was something not right about this.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Yeah, it is a staphylococcus infection, but they don't know where it comes from.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
The description of toxic shock syndrome.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But not completely.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Oh.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
Joan Chesney wondered if they were seeing the birth of a new and terrifying disease.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Oh, a new disease.

36:43.000 --> 36:50.000
You have to make yourself keep an open mind to the fact that it might be a new virus, it might be a new bacteria.

36:50.000 --> 36:58.000
We were wondering if it could have been some kind of chemical reaction that she maybe absorbed a chemical through her skin or take.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
Think about how different it is if they think she absorbed a chemical through her skin or it's the development of a new disease.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
One is potentially a Kim dot com billions of dead.

37:11.000 --> 37:21.000
And you should have been having PPE on and now you're an asymptomatic carrier that's going to kill everybody you come in contact with in the next two weeks or.

37:22.000 --> 37:35.000
Nobody's in danger and you're treating her completely incorrectly with a broad spectrum antibiotics that could actually make it worse.

37:35.000 --> 37:44.000
You see how weird that is that there's a those are very different things in a drug that nobody knew about.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Then just hours later, a second case appeared.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
19 year old Kaylee Wilson was rushed to the University of Wisconsin Medical Center.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Like Emily, she arrived in the ER.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
So now a second case will not be evidence for chemical exposure.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
Now a second case will be evidence for spreading pathogen, you see.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
And now what I want you to pay attention to it is the spread of bad ideas.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
It's not the spread of RNA that's happening here in this video.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
Are with a raging fever, extremely low blood pressure and a bizarre red rash.

38:24.000 --> 38:31.000
The ER staff pumped her with fluids desperately trying to raise her blood pressure.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Something's going on at the University of Wisconsin doors.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
I want to tell a very bad joke about it but I can't.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Joan Chesney was immediately notified.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
We see patients all the time who have very unusual presentations of some disease.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
But there's only one of them and we don't we often don't figure out what it is no matter how hard we try.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
But here we had two right, less than 24 hours apart.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Those of whom were very sick.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
The similarity between the two cases still can't be.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
Joan's experience with infectious diseases told her this couldn't be a coincidence.

39:12.000 --> 39:19.000
She recommended supportive treatment, massive amounts of oxygen, and a broad spectrum of antibiotics.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
Ooh, cheese had poisoning as really dangerous in Wisconsin.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Soon after Kaylee was admitted, Joan learned that a third-

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
That only really happens in bald people.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
...was being treated at a hospital just across town.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
This was no random event.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
1977 is widespread.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Well, this happened in 1977.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
I think the video started on the 9th.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
To say my heart rate doubled would be an understatement.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
It was scary.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
Joan knew it was time to bring in the director of the Wisconsin Department of Health, Dr. Jeff Davis.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Here we go.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
The fact that three cases were occurring in one community simultaneously certainly was of impact.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
We felt it was certainly unusual needed to be investigated right away.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Boy, he sure looks like a public health official, doesn't he? Just my goodness.

40:13.000 --> 40:21.000
And he's going to call up the oaster home in the Gopher State next door within a few hours, I'm sure.

40:21.000 --> 40:30.000
As chief epidemiologist for the state of Wisconsin, it was Dr. Davis's job to make sense of this outbreak.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
To figure out how these three cases were related.

40:34.000 --> 40:42.000
Had the young women all been exposed to something in common, what was the source of the illness?

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
Dr. Davis interviewed the three patients, asking about pets, allergies, dietary habits.

40:50.000 --> 40:57.000
Anything that might provide a link, a clue to the origin of this mysterious infection.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
We asked about a lot of activities.

40:59.000 --> 41:06.000
These were fairly far reaching, you know, where people shopped, you know, where they went, what their usual activities were.

41:07.000 --> 41:14.000
Davis then compared the interviews, looking for overlapping data, the one key point where the patient's lives intersected.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
What he found was absolutely nothing.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Was absolutely nothing.

41:20.000 --> 41:27.000
And they were from basically the greater Madison area. They didn't have anything in common.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
The mystery was growing, and unless doctors and public health officials could identify the source of the toxic infection.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
More young women could be in danger.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
A strange outbreak, a mysterious infection.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
This is a commercial break returning from commercial break.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
In Madison, Wisconsin, young women were being rushed to the hospital.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
In each case, the symptoms were the same.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
High fever, dangerously low blood pressure, signs of shock, and a bizarre sunburn like rash.

42:05.000 --> 42:18.000
As doctors struggled to keep the women alive, health officials worked round the clock to find the cause.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
Wisconsin state epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Davis combed through the women's medical records, searching for clues.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
What did these patients have in common?

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
The only thing they shared was that they were all young, and they were all women.

42:35.000 --> 42:42.000
It seemed like nothing. In fact, it was the beginning of an answer.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
So that's when I thought what differentiates women from men.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
And given their age, I thought that menstruation may be a factor.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
Unfortunately, the medical files had no record of menstrual cycles.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Dr. Davis would have to revisit the patients.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Emily Murray, the first, was in the best shape of the three.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Her kidneys were failing, and she'd been put on dialysis.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
But she was at least lucid enough to talk.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
Yes.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
Regular, since that time. Normal, monthly periods.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
Over the next day, the other patients told him the same thing.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
They had both been menstruating when they got sick.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
At last, Davis had found something all the patients had in common.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
But what did it mean? Was it even significant?

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
He shared his findings with infectious disease expert Dr. Joan Chesney.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
She was skeptical.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
My reaction was, well, Jeff, if you take any group of young women at one point in time,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
you know, significant number are going to be having their period.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
And he said, well, I know, but I just can't find anything else.

44:00.000 --> 44:06.000
But Davis's interviews uncovered another clue supporting his suspicions.

44:07.000 --> 44:14.000
One of the women had suffered similar but less severe symptoms a month before.

44:14.000 --> 44:20.000
The implications were frightening.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Had the young women taken a pain reliever that was contaminated,

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
a tainted batch of oral contraceptives.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Davis and Chesney wondered if other doctors in the area were seeing the same strange illness.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
It was time to get the word out, to get as many brains working on the mystery as possible.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
We found a real sense of urgency to let other people know as quickly as possible

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
and to see if people had seen it, not recognized it, to be sure we picked up any additional cases.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
Dr. Chesney presented her cases at a hospital conference on infectious disease.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Thank you all for coming.

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
We wanted to tell you about three patients that we've seen in the last two days.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
And we wanted to bring it to your attention so that if any of you saw a patient with this in the next few months

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
or if you've seen a patient with this over the last six months, please let us know.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
I'm sure it's not just going on here in Madison, but it's probably-

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
When she asked if anyone had seen patients with similar symptoms, a medical resident spoke up.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
Chesney, I saw a similar patient six months ago.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
He had treated a young woman in her teens a few months earlier.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
Dr. Chesney asked to look at the patient's records.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
We're all quite concerned about it right now.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Thank you again for letting us come today.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The bowl's just beginning.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
As she reviewed the file, Dr. Chesney saw all the telltale signs.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
Look, she was in shock at the time and she had a rash just like I told you earlier.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
In the red eyes you had mentioned to me.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
Um, evening is whether anybody recorded that she was having her period when all of this started.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
You find it?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Here it is.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
They did document that she was having her period at the time of her symptoms.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
This was yet another documented case of the mysterious illness.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Wisconsin was firmly in the grip of an outbreak.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
An outbreak.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Wisconsin's having an outbreak.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
The teenager was being admitted to the Wisconsin medical center.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
All these teen girls.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Like the other women when she arrived at the ER.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
She was disoriented and covered.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
How come these women aren't afraid of getting what these other women have?

46:36.000 --> 46:43.000
What if their menstruation cycles all sequence up and that is sync up and then they all get sick together?

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
Have you heard there's another teenager in the emergency room with a few scratch and shock

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and they'd like you to come now please.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Wow.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Hi Allison.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
My name is Dr. Chesney.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
This new patient was also menstruating.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
They all wear new balance shoes.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
That's what it is.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Oh my gosh.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Those will kill you for sure.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Dr. Chesney had been developing a theory about this.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
You want to see what I got for my birthday?

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Since the patients were all menstruating at the onset of illness,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
Chesney ordered a vaginal culture to test for bacteria.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
You know I like green.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Check those bad boys out.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Can you see them?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Those are those green.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
The culture was incubated on a growth medium.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Green Jordan 4s.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
They're pretty cool.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
24 hours later.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
It was placed in a reagent solution and identified as staphylococcus.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
You can't really see them.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Sorry.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
The bacteria associated with toxic shocks.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
There we go.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Staphylococcus.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
We got it.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
Joan Chesney's initial diagnosis had proven correct.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Exactly.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
And sure enough it was what we call a pure culture.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
That was the only bacteria that grew and it was a heavy growth.

47:49.000 --> 47:56.000
So that was our first clue, hard clue that maybe our thoughts were going in the right direction.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
For Dr. Jeff Davis, the epidemiologist, it was time to place the entire state.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Man I had Jordan 4s in high school.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I actually had a 35.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
I actually had a friend in high school and we had black and white ones.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Was it black?

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
He had black and gray and I had the red and white and then we like each traded a shoe.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
It was dope.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
A hundred physicians that Wisconsin was facing an outbreak of the deadly toxic shock syndrome.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
He requested information and sample cultures from any patients who displayed symptoms.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
It was important to get this letter out because they needed to learn about the illness.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
They needed to learn what was occurring.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
We made recommendations for laboratory tests to obtain them so that expanded their ability

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
to get the appropriate test.

48:45.000 --> 48:53.000
In a time before email, Davis's letter on toxic shock was distributed the old fashioned way by U.S. mail.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
But all across the state, physicians got the message.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Watch out for unusual cases.

48:59.000 --> 49:08.000
It was really that very, very unique combination of symptoms and signs that we tried to let people know about

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
and don't give them some penicillin and send them home because they won't be better in the morning.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
You need to get them to the hospital right away.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
The response was overwhelming.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Hospital statewide reported cases of the deadly illness.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Not just one or two, but hundreds of them.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
Young women all over Wisconsin were infected with toxic shock syndrome.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
And health officials had no idea why.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
In 1980, dozens of young Wisconsin women were coming down with the disease.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
This is like a return from menstrual toxic shock syndrome.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
From commercial.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
So what they're calling it now is menstrual toxic shock syndrome.

49:54.000 --> 50:00.000
Now, keep in mind how important it is that there's only like two people in this story

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
who essentially are controlling the narrative.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
Everybody else is going to call that lady with the glasses and ask her for her advice

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
about whether or not their case fits her description.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
Whether her case or whether their case fits into her category and what she's doing for it.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
So you see this pattern that happens very quickly already in this.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
It's a dramatization of what's something that supposedly happened in real life.

50:26.000 --> 50:37.000
What would happen if you had people in position already prepared to stay committed?

50:37.000 --> 50:46.000
What if you had that guy, the health director of all the state of Wisconsin ready to stay

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
committed to a respiratory pathogen spreading that was specific for women for some reason

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
and had an elaborate story to go along with it?

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
How long could he have made that go on?

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
If he would have even gotten that one doctor with the funny glasses, the lady, the wife

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
of the guy who originally treated the first patient to go along with it.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
How long then would that go on?

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
Now, if that lady had already been put in place at that hospital by previous assignment

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
and already knew that this was going to happen and it was designed to be this way

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
and that the worst case scenario was necessary to be accepted.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
How long could they make this go on?

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
How long could they confuse other doctors in the state?

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
Now, how long do you think it could go on if they had a test that wasn't specific for this?

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
But they told everybody that when it tests positive and you don't have the symptoms,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
you're just an asymptomatic carrier.

51:44.000 --> 51:50.000
How long do you think this could spiral out of control if you had a collaboration of TV

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
and social media?

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
How long would this spiral on if you had control of the highest levels of governments

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
around the world so that even across cultures and across languages,

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
the messaging would be very similar about toxic shock syndrome?

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
How long could you keep it going?

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Now, think about how long you keep it going if it was happening to both men and women,

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
old and young, and they said they knew nothing about it

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
and they kept insisting that they knew nothing about it

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
and that you created a rumor in the background that this could be even worse

52:31.000 --> 52:39.000
than the most natural virus because it could be a man-made laboratory virus.

52:39.000 --> 52:45.000
That's why I'm showing you this dramatization of a real-life mystery that needed to be solved

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
because those people were getting sick and one of the first assumptions they jumped to

52:50.000 --> 52:58.000
was a contagious new developing disease that they didn't need any protection from either masks or even gloves.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
It's extraordinary!

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
The local doctors were baffled.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
More cases were hearing across the state.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
And then, several weeks into the outbreak, the Wisconsin Department of Health learned

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
that three women in Minnesota had also been hospitalized with unusual symptoms.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
Epidemiologist Jeff Davis was baffled.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
Toxic shock syndrome is not contagious.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
How would it spread?

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Yeah, I've seen that dog game of werewolf. I really like that.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
I've got to cover that at some point.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I think it's important to see the event.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
Because clearly this was going on in a couple of states.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
At the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Dr. Bruce Dan was part of the investigation.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
To suddenly hear that women in Wisconsin and Minnesota were having the same symptoms,

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
and not just the same symptoms, very strange collection of symptoms.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
You don't have to be a really trained epidemiologist to realize you had a real epidemic on your hands,

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
and something very strange was going on.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Oh, the chalkboard.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Now they're going to solve the problem.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
It's a problem with the CDC's epidemiological intelligence service.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
I had a network, and this would be also a shock syndrome.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
You can subscribe and get on biological so I can afford to chalkboard it into this.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
If I had a chalkboard, this would be over.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
The investigators, the infectious disease experts who had seen years and years of disease,

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
especially in medical centers and universities where they get referred lots of very unusual cases,

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
who said, you know, we have never ever seen anything like this before.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
You guys are handling something.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Oh, I would ask for chalk.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
Not only that, but I would ask for the chalk that the Japanese physicists like to have.

54:44.000 --> 54:54.000
There's a special kind of hard-pressed chalk that physicists and math professors like hoard and covet.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
And I would only use that chalk if you got me a chalkboard.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Just to let you know, I wouldn't fool around.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
I mean, this would be Jurassic Park level chalkboard.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
You know, finest chalk, finest slate, the whole thing.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
Totally new, totally unrecognized as far as we're concerned.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
The CDC's investigative team rolled into action.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Yeah, then you're not using the right chalk.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
You've got to have this.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
You've got to have this.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
We've got to have this.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
We've got to have this.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Just to let the white chalkboard champs.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
For math professors.

55:25.000 --> 55:32.000
We needed to figure out whether this was a regional outbreak or a national outbreak.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Oh, my gosh, a national outbreak.

55:34.000 --> 55:41.000
I wanted to put out the word and ask people had they seen this illness in other locations

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
than Wisconsin and Minnesota.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Only two things were served.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
I'm not.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Toxic shock syndrome was dangerous and was spreading.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I definitely need a chalkboard to solve this.

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
On Sunday, February 8, 1980, Ronald and Jeanette Dulek were on their way to church.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
Geraldine, their 16-year-old daughter, was running late.

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
Oh, no, another teenager getting struck by the toxic.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
Oh, she's out on the floor, yo, right in the laundry.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
At St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Oh, now it's in Milwaukee.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
These people will figure it out.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Has Geraldine flickered in and out of consciousness?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
The ER staff charted her final thoughts.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
He's got a mustache.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
He's going to solve the problem from multiple high-risk symptoms.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
I always trust the doctor and the pilot with the mustache.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
And your temperature short to 106 degrees.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Doctor struggled to make a diagnosis until the attending physician received...

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Oh, that's Mrs. Letter.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
She's going.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
She's getting infected.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
He recognized his patient's symptoms as a textbook case of the brand-new epidemic.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Meeting with Geraldine's family, the doctor asked if she could...

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Fear the wind to force me if I grow a mustache.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
And it would also take me about six months, but...

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
She had.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
I could probably grow one, but...

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Their answer wouldn't have confirmed his diagnosis.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
That's great.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Toxic shock syndrome.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
He's got a nice contact with students in the Department of Health to get the latest information

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
on treatment.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
We were talking like two weeks now, I think.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
The balance.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Geraldine was given fluids to...

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
They still don't know.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
...and helped raise her blood pressure.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
She was also given...

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I have a 100% bare dollar.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
I have a 100% bare dollar.

57:36.000 --> 57:43.000
If Geraldine stood any chance of survival, treatment would have to take effect quickly.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
News of the 16-year-old's desperate condition reached Neil Rosenberg,

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
a male walking...

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Wow, this has got a funny-shaped laptop.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
He was intrigued by the mysterious illness.

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
When I first heard about Geraldine Dulac, it came not with a name, but fear in the voice

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
of an anonymous caller.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
I was sitting at my desk, looking for a story as I usually do when the phone rang.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
And it was a caller from China.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
And she told me that there was a new virus breaking out in China,

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
and the only thing that was working was Remdesivir.

58:17.000 --> 58:26.000
The person who said, the young woman, was seriously ridiculous.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
On the south side of Milwaukee, from a killer virus.

58:30.000 --> 58:37.000
Tracking the story, Rosenberg contacted Dr. Jeff Davis at the Wisconsin Department of Health.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
He learned the mysterious illness had a surprising connection.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
He gave me a graphic description of the symptoms.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
And at one point, I said, is there any common leak?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
He said, they were all menstruating.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
And that really threw me for a loop.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And I said, well, what do you think that means?

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
And he says, we really don't know, Neil.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
There's an airplane response there, right?

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
It means that their uterine wall was shedding.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
There should be some biological death.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
What do you think that means?

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm sorry.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
I love that movie.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Rosenberg's story made front page news.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
For Jeff Davis and the Department of Health, it also opened a floodgate.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
That article had a lot of information about toxic shocks in Rome.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
And I started getting a lot of phone calls.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
He needs a mustache.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
He's sweating where he shouldn't be sweating.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
I think he's not happy about being on camera that funny guy.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
A huge number of phone calls.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
And so that article had an extraordinary impact.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Hundreds of calls began pouring in.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Physicians called to report suspected cases.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
What are you talking about six months previously?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
There was a U.N. war game covering weaponized tampons.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
What the hell are you talking about?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
That can't be possible.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think that must be a joke.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
He's a funny guy.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Women call to share their stories of surviving about with the deadly syndrome.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Astonished by the response, Davis launched a case deck today.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Wow, those are complicated phones.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Health officials work non-stop gathering information.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
They had to find the link between toxic shock syndrome and menstruation.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Through scores of interviews, the team compared 35 confirmed cases of toxic shock

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
to a larger control group of healthy women.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
All the women, healthy or infected, lived in the same area.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
They were all about the same age and shared similar lifestyles.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I can confirm that looks like a Wisconsin girl to health.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
That looks like a Wisconsin host to me.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
With the participants.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Wow.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That's impressive.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Some of the women described feeling unusually sick.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I think I went to like high school with like 10 girls that looked like her.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That's great.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Every time they got their periods.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
But their symptoms had not escalated.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Unlike Geraldine Dulek.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Subdramal, predrome, syndromes, signs and symptoms that are, I can't do it,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
but that's what James Giordano would call that, right?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Predrome, signs and symptoms before the main.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
At St. Mary's hospital, the teenager was getting worse.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Her condition had been steadily deteriorating.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Finally, after 20 days in the hospital, she slipped into an irreversible coma.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Holy shit!

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
And on February 28th, Geraldine Dulek died from catastrophic organ failure.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I thought she was in good hands with the mustache

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
and the holy catastrophic organ failure Batman.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
How is that happening?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
How is it possible that that's happening?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's happening because there is a consensus about an unknown.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Please understand that these people are, well, what we're being shown is a

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
reenactment of people making bad decisions based on bad assumptions.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Not intentionally, just because that can happen.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But now imagine, imagine if you orchestrated it.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Just please try to imagine how powerful it would be if you orchestrated it with a few

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
well-rehearsed, very authoritative leaders

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
in very influential positions.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Wisconsin had lost its first victim to toxic shock syndrome.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
She would not be the last.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Wow.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Until 1980, the American public had never heard of toxic shock syndrome.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But now the rare bacterial infection was erupting in the Midwest.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
One teenager had already died in Wisconsin.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Now, the disease showed up in Iowa.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
On May 16th, 36-year-old Chris Lekock was rushed to the hospital.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Her liver and kidneys were failing.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The emergency room team worked hard to stabilize their patient.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Hard lungs and arm muscles.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
They call you in the hospital's infectious disease.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That's an ER doctor with a prosthetic arm.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That's dope.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Expert. Dr. Charles Helms.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Could also be an android, I guess.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
But I think it's probably a doctor with a prosthetic arm.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I get a call from Dr. Hingway, who was the resident on call in the intensive care unit,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
the medical intensive care unit, about a case that was really had him worried and concerned

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and wondered that infectious disease consults.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Dr. Helms had never seen anything like it.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It was as if the patient's entire body was shutting down, one organ after another.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's unusual to see a young, healthy person as she was.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Come in so desperately ill, particularly with so many systems of her body involved.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
As her condition got worse, Chris was moved to the intensive care unit,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
where she could be monitored.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
In addition to her liver and kidneys, her lungs were failing.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Perhaps of most concern to us here, her respiratory status, her ability to breathe and oxygenate her blood was...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Now it's interesting, I think to note that a lot of these, the toxic shock syndrome is basically like a cytokine storm.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I think that in current immunological lingo, this would be called a cytokine storm,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and this multiple organ failure would be a result of a cytokine storm.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That's my guess.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Do you even argue with me in the chat if you want?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
In dire straits.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Doctors rushed to intubate the patient.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
They put her on a respirator.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Her blood pressure was crashing.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Her organs weren't functioning.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
They were losing her.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Their only hope of keeping Chris alive was to raise her blood pressure, to get blood to her vital organs.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Despite the CDC's efforts, not all doctors were aware that a strange infection was on the move.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:41.000
If it was a bacterial infection, that she was on a sufficiently broad range of antibiotics to protect her while we figured out what was going on with her.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Chris Lekock was placed on life support in the ICU.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Her family sat by her side as she slipped into a coma.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So one of the things you should realize that happened during the pandemic is that people were told that antibiotics don't work on viruses.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And in this case, even though they're not absolutely sure what's going on,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I think they generally speaking because of the presence of this one protein,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I've decided that it's an indication of bacterial infection.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So they're putting these people on a broad spectrum antibiotic set.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But a broad spectrum antibiotic set for the unknown disease COVID was absolutely positively off the table.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And you have to see how devastating that was for outcomes and especially because it was a controlled narrative.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
People were there and they said it over and over again.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
They went on social media and said people shouldn't be overusing antibiotics on a viral syndrome.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Remember that because that was 2020 and 2021.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But Chris was not alone.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Toxic shock was now a national problem.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
At the CDC, the calls were streaming in.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Hundreds of girls were sick and some were dying.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Epidemiologist Bruce Dan tracked the outbreak.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It was happening nationally and it doesn't state all over the country.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Suddenly, young, previously healthy women who were going about their life,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
in high school, going to college, going to work, raising kids, selling, get ill, as if they had the flu.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And some of them would be dead in the next 12 or 24 hours from a totally unknown cause.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That's frightening.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The CDC task force kept running totals of confirmed toxic shock cases.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Reports were coming in from all over the country.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Nationwide, the death toll had risen to seven.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000
As the numbers kept pouring in, we got more and more calls saying we've seen another case and another case and another case.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
There's a lot of pressure to say we have to solve this very quickly.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Find the answer to stop this epidemic and save a lot of lives.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:09.000
The CDC put together an MMWR, a mortality and morbidity weekly report on toxic shock syndrome.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It wasn't alert to physicians at hospitals all across the country.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:23.000
The MMWR would help doctors make an early diagnosis of toxic shock patients.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It's basically the CDC's mechanism for getting information out to doctors, nurses, health officials across the country.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
It's also mechanism for getting information back in.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
The CDC's report arrived at the Iowa hospital just in time.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Dr. Helms recognized Chris Lekock's symptoms immediately.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It was textbook toxic shock syndrome.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Dr. Helms followed the CDC's recommendations.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Massive amounts of fluids and antibiotics to fight infection.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Massive amounts of fluids and antibiotics.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
The CDC could only watch and wait.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Back at the CDC, the numbers continue to rise.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
107 cases had now surfaced in 33 separate states.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Clearly, this was the beginning of a nationwide epidemic.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But what was causing it?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Your first hunch, if you want to play hunches, is probably maybe these are women who got a bad batch of some medication that women commonly take during their menstrual period for aches and pains and so forth.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
But you can't play your hunches when you're dealing with something like this. You have to do a real study.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And so the CDC launched a nationwide hunt to discover the cause of toxic shock.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
You've got the names of 50 women from their medical records in hospitals across the United States.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
How do you find them? How do you call them? Where are they now?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
For each patient, they needed to interview three control subjects.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:13.000
They had to develop a way of tracking and tracing 50 women across the United States to track down what was happening with toxic shock syndrome.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
They needed phone books and piles of phone records.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
They asked each of the patients for the names of three friends.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
They asked the patients for the names of three friends.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So it's not just a matter of making 200 phone calls, but maybe 400, 800,000 phone calls to get hold of all these people.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It took a huge amount of work and I'm very short time to do it.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
With the days passing and more women falling ill, health officials raised to get to the bottom of the mystery.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So we devised a questionnaire about 125, 150 questions asking everything we can think about about their current health status, medications they may be taking.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Certainly everything we can think about their menstrual period, do you wear pads or tampons?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Do you exercise during your period? Do you jog? Do you take showers? Do you take baths?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
What do you do unusual or not do unusual during your period?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
To get an idea of what would make the cases different than the controls?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Why did the one group of young women get toxic shock syndrome and get violently ill and other women were totally healthy?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It was clear to us that if you asked enough questions you would probably find out why women with toxic shock syndrome were different than other women.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Turns out the answer surprised us.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000
After weeks of medical detective work, the CDC investigators had found the common link.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
There was one thing that set the women with toxic shock apart.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
100% of them used tampons.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
What could it be about tampons that would cause this severe disease and cause women to die?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Somebody had it right in the chat in the beginning.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
The solution to one mystery was the beginning of the next.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:20.000
CDC investigators presented their startling findings to every tampon manufacturer in the country.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
We invited the tampon manufacturers to come to Atlanta to CDC to discuss with us.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
They called the tampon manufacturer.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Come and tell us what you guys know about this possibility and I'm sure you guys will be honest with us.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
First of all, to tell them what the results are or study with so they would be aware.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And secondly, to find out from them, tell us about tampons.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
How are they made? Where are they made? What are they made of?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The executives agreed to provide the CDC with the information.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But on one point, they were unequivocal.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
They had no intention of taking their products off the market.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
They believed the scientific proof was lacking.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Still, CDC investigator Katherine Shans felt the evidence linking tampons to toxic shock was clear enough.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The disease needed two things to occur.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000
One was the presence of staph aureus and actually an infection with staph aureus.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The other was the use of tampons.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And so the CDC went public with their findings.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
They needed to warn women about the potential threat.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
But the mystery was far from solved.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Dozens of questions still lingered.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Investigators needed to conduct a second study to determine why tampons were making women sick.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
What caused the infection?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Had specific brands become contaminated.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So we collected tampons to test them in the laboratory to see if any particular tampon, any brand, any style

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
from any kind of manufacturing location might be contaminated.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And though we looked at hundreds and thousands of tampons, you know, hundreds and thousands of hours of laboratory town to look for that,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000
we couldn't find any particular tampon that were contaminated with anything that would cause a disease.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The story of the outbreak made national headlines.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
All over America, women were confused and terrified.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
This was also under sort of a national spotlight.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And suddenly, not only do you have the spotlight on you from just your local colleagues, but the Director of CDC, the Surgeon General,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000
the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, and even the Presidential Office is looking very quickly at you to say,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
hey, this is a real problem. Are you guys going to solve it?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Throughout the summer and fall, the epidemic raged on.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And panic began to set in.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000
As more and more women found themselves in a battle with a mysterious disease, fighting for their lives.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
All across America, women were dying and helped.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Return from commercial break.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
As scientists raced to find answers, more patients were being rushed to the hospital.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Patients like 25-year-old Pat Kemp, the mother of two small children, she had early flu-like symptoms.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Now, she was in the ER, and her husband was worried.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Every 15 or 20 minutes I was allowed to enter into the emergency room.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Sorry for the recaps after commercials.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
You're supposed to be asking questions and not making funny comments, and then I could have something to talk about,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
but the funny comments are just making me laugh.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But I can squeeze it back.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
As Pat's condition deteriorated, Mike grew more concerned.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
To think that just a few days prior, she was the young, healthy mother of my children, and we were enjoying life

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and making plans for our future to see her in a hospital setting, looking totally unlike her normal self and fighting to take every breath.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:25.000
The medical community was now on high alert for patients who showed signs of toxic shock syndrome.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And Pat Kemp was a classic case.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Admitted to the ICU, Pat was treated with antibiotics to fight the infection, but her situation was grave,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
and Mike could see she had taken a turn for the worse.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000
It was so alarmed at how her coloring had changed, and later I understood that that was because her blood vessels were bursting under her skin,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
due to the toxins and the poison in her body.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And I said, well, doctor, what's the worst thing I can expect?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And he said, Mike, that's a good question to ask.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You know, my fear was, would she have lung damage or brain damage or some other organ that could be damaged by all this?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And he said, you know, that's a fair question, but our fight right now is just to try to keep her alive.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And at that point, it dawned on me just how critical she was.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Even as Pat Kemp lay on that hospital bed, the CDC was working around the clock to pinpoint the source of her infection.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Was it a style of tampon, one specific brand?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That's when investigators had a breakthrough.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000
In this particular study, one particular brand of tampon accounted for about two-thirds of all the cases.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And it was a brand of tampons and only about a fifth of women in the United States were using.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
So something was hardly risky about this tampon.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
The brand was a relatively new product that had been aggressively marketed as a super-absorbent tampon.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Hey, somebody got that one.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Millions of dollars per month. Nice! Well done, guys.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000
They told us that they had made changes in the composition of tampons over the last several years.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Prior to 1975, all tampons had been made of cotton and rayon.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And they had begun introducing high absorbency chemical materials into tampons to, obviously, to increase the absorbency.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
The FDA acted swiftly and pulled the brand from the shelves.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
When they did that, the number of cases of toxic shock syndrome dropped off dramatically.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And not surprisingly, if tampon is responsible for two-thirds of the cases, removing that tampon from the market, as quickly as you can, reduce the number of cases.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The CDC got the word out.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Tampons were directly linked to toxic shock syndrome.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Man, I flew from the Philippines and back when I was a kid, and I can still remember clear as day that that entire frickin' airplane was full of smoking.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And there were still, you know, ashtrays, and my mom smoked. I can remember it, wow.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But for Pat Kemp, it was already too late.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Despite the doctor's rapid diagnosis, she lay in a coma, unable to breathe on her own.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And I would spend the evening with her at the hospital.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
She squeezed my hand.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000
My one question is, once they develop this toxic shock syndrome, are they just kind of lost?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Are these people also still menstruating and using a tampon incorrectly?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And that's why they cascade out of control.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Or once they get into this scenario, are they, they kind of, it's a crapshoot, whether they can be pulled out of the nose dive?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
That's the only part I don't understand here.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Tears are rolling out.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
This can be rough, I see it in those tears where we're at.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Because of the blood vessels bursting in her eyes and so on.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
On September 6th, 1980, Pat Kemp lost her bat.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
No randomized control.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
No trials, no none.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Another victim of this terrible shock.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh wow, she died too, crazy.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But the story wasn't over.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Although one brand of tampons had been pulled from the shelves.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
More cases of the infection turned out really still around the country.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Women were getting sick while using other brands.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And no one knew exactly why.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Absorbency levels seemed to be a factor.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
As well as how long they remained inside the body.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:57.000
To alert the public, the FDA required tampon manufacturers to include information in their packaging about toxic shock syndrome.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And how to avoid it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
In Iowa, Chris Lekock spent weeks lying near death.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Finally, the aggressive antibiotic therapy kicked in.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Her body fought off the staph aureus bacteria.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Chris's doctor, Richard Helms, credits the research of the CDC for saving her life.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Chris was fortunate that she came in to a hospital in this country at that particular point in the evolution of American medicine.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Where we had a syndrome.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Where we had an approach to that syndrome.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And that syndrome included treatment of staphylococcus aureus.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Nearly a month after she was admitted, Chris Lekock was released from the hospital.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Today, she's still thankful for Dr. Helms' quick thinking.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
They saved my life.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
There's no doubt about it.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
They saved my life.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
They were on top of it.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
They had to try a lot of different things.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You have to realize that my kidneys failed.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I went into congestive heart failure.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I was being kept alive by life support.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And they kept me alive.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And I'm very, very grateful to them.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
They spent the one unfortunate year, hunt evidence.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But women like Chris, in the following years, simply worked too well.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
They became tiny incubators for disease.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
The perfect growth medium for the staph aureus bacteria.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Manufacturers went back to old-fashioned cotton and rayon.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And health officials got out the morning.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The need to change tampons regularly.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And watch for flu-like symptoms.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000
The outbreak taught larger lessons as well.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I think one of the lessons of toxic shock syndrome is that, just as much as we've learned about bioterrorism and anthrax lately, is that you need to have...

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
What did he say?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
As much as we've learned about bioterrorism and anthrax lately?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
This was from the 90s, right?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Remember, we could look up exactly when this show was.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I think one of the lessons of toxic shock syndrome is that, just as much as we've learned about bioterrorism and anthrax lately, is that you need to have a group of highly trained professionals who at a moment's notice can look into solve and fix an epidemic.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
One of the things about epidemics is you never know where they're going to happen or where they're going to come from.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
No, the story is from the 90s.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The TV shows from the 90s, I think, and they're talking about the 70s.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
You're right about it being later or earlier, but they're doing a reenactment of it now.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And this, I think, this show, I can look.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Let me see.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Maybe it'll be on the...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:25.000
No, it doesn't say it here.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000
But I don't think that I think this was really, like, you know, in the 90s and then they were reenactment.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
He is early detection and swift reaction.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Mike Kim and his wife, Sister Carol.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You've got to watch out for that.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
You've got to watch out for that.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Myself and my daughters and our family.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Our goal today is for the next generation of young women who are using feminine hygiene products today to please read the warning labels that are on the boxes of these products or inside on pamphlets and have an awareness that if you have any flu-like symptoms, you could be endangering your life and to remove the product and seek medical attention immediately.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That simple warning came 30 or 45 days too late to save my wife's life.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Today, nearly 20 years after the first outbreak, the numbers of syndrome cases caused by tampons have declined sharply, but they have not disappeared.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Hundreds of incidents are still reported each year.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Thanks to new diagnostic tools and early detection, many of those lives can now be saved.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That was fun.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Just for a quick close out here.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Don't forget that we're really trying to interrogate the infectious cycle.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And I believe that right now we are being sort of bamboozled by an illusion of consensus being created by a bunch of people that are in place.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:31.000
They're on purpose to make sure that we don't figure out the kinds of molecular biological tricks that could be used in order to seed the narrative of a pandemic to make sure that this pandemic potential is believed to have actually occurred so that they never have to say it again.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
They can just sound the alarm and then things are going to happen again.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I want to remind you that it is actually Robert Malone himself who told us this idea that these produces viruses.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
In most cases, a large fraction, if not the majority of the virus particles that are produced are defective.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Then I get for anything and I'm infectious. They just kind of float around.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And among other things, they interact with the immune system as does the live virus.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So we need to do the homework necessary to figure out why it is that the vast majority of particles in a coronavirus infection are non infectious and we are doing that work right now.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And more importantly, we're trying to put together a history of clones so that we can see how long these people have been so happy about being able to use clones to bridge this gap between things that we don't have infectious material to study.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Things that we can't culture and things that we can study.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And this is a review from 1994 and here they're already seeing the possibility of obtaining infectious clones and corresponding to the genomes of RNA viruses has greatly enhanced the potential investigations and that you can substitute things.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And they facilitate studies of viruses that are present only in low titers and infected cells or whose isolation is problematic.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And so we can go on and look at an article by Allison Tortura and Cina Bavari Allison Tortura being the last postdoc of Ralph Barrack before the pandemic.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And we can read all about reverse genetic systems and how handy they are for using CDNA concepts to create full length infectious clones allowing precise targeting of genetic manipulation and also the creation of near homogenous viral

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000
stocks that can't be that are near homogenous when compared to traditional viral stocks.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And that near homogeneity makes a very different story for what kinds of things could be in theory seeded when using infectious clones to do so.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
The signal would be different.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And so we're going to talk about viral packaging just very briefly just to say that the packaging and the making of new viruses for coronavirus versus flu for example is very different.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:05.000
One of the things that I'd like to point out and give you a hint about is the end proteins really a lot more important than you might think for the assembly of viruses and coronavirus in particular.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Here's a little diagram to remind you that influenza virus is a negative RNA and that means it needs to bring its own proteins with it and that little process of copying the genome of a flu virus seems to involve transport in and out of the nucleus

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:31.000
where a coronavirus actually doesn't transport in and out of the nucleus and does all of its work in double membrane vesicles that are budding off of the ER.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I suspect that according to this diagram and this seems to be the truth that subgenomic mRNAs are also assembled into viruses and that is the preponderance of viral particles expressing subgenomic RNAs.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And so in that case you can imagine very easily the most abundant subgenomic RNAs are the ones that are most likely to be packaged and that would be NME and S interestingly enough.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So if we keep working on this then what is the virus actually hijacking it's hijacking the machinery that already exists for putting things into vesicles and making exosomes.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
We want to also argue about RNA copying and whether or not it can be copied with the same fidelity as DNA.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I'm making the argument that it can't and trying to use this analogy of a audio cassette versus a CD one of which can be copied quite regularly and one of which cannot.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That scenario that kind of explains to me in an analogous way why a coronavirus is very difficult to culture and sustain in culture.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:53.000
But if you start with a DNA molecule an equivalent of it and you grow large quantities of it in either with using PCR or if you wanted to grow industrial sized quantities you might use E. coli like like an OVO did for its vaccine.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Then you can make lots of quantities of that DNA then you could use a commercial polymerase to change that into RNA.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And then you would have an extremely homogenous collection of really the sky's the limit how much you want to make of this genomic RNA that you can then apply to a cell culture and get it packaged into virus that you can then use to make models in the laboratory of disease.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
You can store it, you can go back to it.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And what I'm arguing is you can make enough quantities of it if you wanted to with enough investment with the standard techniques known to use for other biologics to make enough to distribute around the world.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And if you did that then you would have a signal that would be very homogenous and very detectable for PCR and for sequencing.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And so after a few times of talking this through with Kevin McKernan, Kevin McKernan has blocked me and then recently I caught this little comment where he says that he's not talking to me anymore but he's making fun of me.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And he says that it's just bio babble that coronaviruses circulate the globe every year that they hyper optimized the receptor binding domain to make it spread farther doesn't mention the fear and cleavage site.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:23.000
He says that he assumes that the virus originated in 2019 and he's claiming that prior circulation is an idea of his rather than mine says that the cloning hypothesis is chemtrail retarded.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:35.000
He says you just have to infect a few people or transfect a few people he says which is exactly what Giordano has said and what I've been saying for three years and he writes it here as though it was his idea.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Then he calls it a keystone cop hypothesis.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:49.000
He says leaking the virus is better for world governments and he doesn't do the math on excess deaths and he still hasn't done it and he doesn't care if it was a man.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Or if it was an iatrogenic murder fest.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:09.000
There was also a pandemic because coronaviruses circulate the globe every year according to this grad school dropout Steve or Eric Lander protege who worked for the human genome project and now as a cannabis genetics company.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Jessica Rose thinks it's a great idea back when I was telling this idea to the entire Steve curse steering committee they all didn't think it was a good idea but Jessica did Matt Crawford did.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And so it's very curious that this guy wastes his time trying to come against someone who's doesn't have a job has gotten laid off from a second job for telling the truth during the course of the pandemic was actually offered a paltry eight thousand dollars and a non disclosure

01:34:41.000 --> 01:35:00.000
agreement from Children's Health Defense and as a as a parting gift and I decided not to say anything and not to take that and the main reason being because then people like Kevin McCurnan could go on ad infinitum as they are on Twitter right now calling me a scammer or calling

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:13.000
me a liar or making up stories or or whatever and also then just speculate that maybe I took a hundred thousand dollars and I wouldn't be able to say anything because I would have signed an NDA.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And so I didn't sign an NDA and I can say whatever the hell I want to and according to CHD I'm worth eight thousand.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:30.000
My family's worth eight thousand my sacrifice to put my name in the Wuhan cover up book is worth eight thousand plus time spent.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Or at least according to some people in the management of CHD I should say because I know that I have lots of friends that I still love who work at CHD who are fighting for the same things that we are fighting for and that's why I'm not afraid.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
That's why I'm not worried because I know CHD will weather this storm and I know that CHD will come out on the other side of better organization.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
But something very very very wrong is a foot.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Something very wrong is a foot and I do need your help.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I do need your help fighting this because I am all alone in my garage in Pittsburgh with about forty five subscribers which turns out to be pretty close to like you know five hundred dollars a month.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And total so I need help.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000
We need to have a Brett Weinstein style support here where if I had a thousand subscribers we could make this work.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But we've got to be able to do this math and nobody else is doing it but us and he's a tonic live and Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson and Denny Denny Rancore and a few other people.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Everybody else isn't doing it. Everybody else is not talking about this stuff.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
They're just trying to make diffuse real again.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Robert Malone and Kevin McCurnan and Archmetic and Jessica Rose are all trying to make diffuse real again and I want to make RNA clones real again.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I want to make RNA real again. RNA biology real again. I want to stop this this charade where everybody's pretending to make a contribution to a tug of war and they're not even pulling on the rope.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:27.000
They're not asking relevant questions and they're arguing about irrelevant things by taking irrelevant positions and writing irrelevant books.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And it's got to be stopped. We cannot let them do this to our children.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:45.000
The double stranded DNA contamination is just a dumb focus point for what should be a 40 point objection to the wholly inappropriate use of transfection on healthy humans.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Never mind healthy young people. Never mind healthy children.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And the diffuse proposal and the discussion of what it means and whether these things were done or not is all a hoax.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And we're going to show it. We're going to talk about it. We're going to outline it. And then you're going to have to everyone is going to have to recalibrate what they think about the people that have been pushing this.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
What they think about the people that have been pushing this.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.720
pushing this. You're going to have to start really evaluating what you think

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.000
about the people who have been pushing this. You're really going to have to

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.360
think about what you think about the people who have been pushing this. This

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:35.560
idea of a of a worst case scenario being a gain of function bio weapon, the

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:41.040
people that picked us up on this road, the people who laid down this list,

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:48.080
these these people. It produces viruses. In most cases, a large fraction, if not

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.800
the majority of the virus particles that are produced are defective. And I

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.120
good for anything. They're not infectious. They just kind of float around. And among

01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.560
other things, they interact with the immune system as does the live virus.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.720
And so this is the lie that they told us for almost two years straight from the

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.560
TV all through social media arguing about the relevance of antibodies, arguing

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.480
about neutralizing versus non neutralizing antibodies, arguing about

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.440
antibodies from virus versus antibodies from infection versus antibodies from

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.960
the vaccine. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to wake up and apologize to our

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.520
children. It's not our fault that this happened. But if you listen to the wrong

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.880
people, you're going to hear the wrong things. And as you start listening to the

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.440
right people, you will start to be able to see the light. The intellectual

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.280
bright web is out there somewhere. The independent bright web is out there

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.280
somewhere. And I hope Gigo and biological is part of this light that's going to

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:56.320
prevent this lie from becoming the truth. But we cannot underestimate the the

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:06.160
the odds against us. We can't estimate the under estimate the odds against us. We

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.440
can't underestimate how many of these things are close to becoming true.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.680
How close we are to having a digital currency. How close we are to having

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.800
digital ID to be on the internet. We need to be aware of that.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.040
If we're going to get rid of this faith in a novel virus to make sure that our kids

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.120
don't get on this train, we need to be aware and we need to start talking.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.680
We need to start posting. We need to start blocking. We need to start muting. We need to start

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.920
coordinatedly promoting the people who have this message that we need to get to our kids.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.800
Message about the real history of epidemics and about sanitation and water treatment.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.640
The real story about novel coronaviruses and how RNA viruses are done in the laboratory.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:01.520
Real story about PCR, the real story about asymptomatic spread being a narrative

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.440
and the real story of gain of function. We can't let them get on this train and ride away.

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.440
Can't let them get on this train and ride away, ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:19.440
Here's just something to remind you, for example, that it was a plan. This is the sparse pandemic

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:26.960
document behind my head here where they talk about how the Corovacs side effects and the

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.960
rumors of them travel on the internet and start to disrupt the social sphere

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.080
a few years after the pandemic happens. This is all part of the story.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.240
The document you see over there, I believe, is from Alberta Health Services in Canada,

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:49.520
where they remind kids that their parents only have control and that is access to your health

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:57.120
information from ages 0 to 11. At 12 to 13, your parent or guardian can request access,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.960
can request access, but doesn't necessarily have it. So listen very carefully.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.600
Keep in mind, my AHS Connect is the only way to access your health information.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.280
Until you're 12 years old, your parent or guardian will be able to access your health

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.680
information through proxy access, a special permission granted to them by your health care

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:32.160
team. So the health care team is actually granting you permissions to have access to your kid's

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:40.800
medical records. What part about inverting your sovereignty to permissions? Is this,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.280
could this be any more spot on dead on balls accurate smack on point for what I've been saying

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.240
for the last three years that they were going to invert your freedom to permissions?

01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:01.600
Here is a Health Services Canada document saying that it is a special permission granted to the

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:08.320
parents of kids under the age of 12 to have access to their data and that at age 14 and beyond,

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.920
they don't have access anymore.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:21.680
I can't stress enough to you how important it is to see how far we are from winning,

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:32.080
how close this is to becoming a truth, especially in places like Canada and the UK and Australia

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:38.480
and New Zealand, which are going to be used as psychological bludgens to make sure that we accept

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:46.640
whatever they force on them. We've got to break this illusion of consensus. We've got to break

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.880
this faith in a novel virus. We've got to make sure our kids realize that this faith in a five-year

01:43:52.880 --> 01:44:01.200
continuous spread of a novel RNA pathogen is wrong. It is a lie. It is a conflated background signal.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:08.240
It is a conflated planted signal. It is a conflated noise signal. I don't know what it is.

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:16.560
But there is no way in God's green earth that without the use of clones and the making of quantities

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:23.120
of them that this molecular biology data is even close to true. Otherwise, it's all false.

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.480
And if it's even remotely close to true, if any of these signals are real,

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:33.760
it has to be a combination of background and planted. It has to be.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:43.040
Biology is the way out. Call for all pause on all childhood vaccinations in the United States,

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:47.280
at least for the first year of life to start with. If you want to be wimpy about it,

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.920
if you want to just get the conversation started. But I think it's very easy to say that it should

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:58.480
be stopped. I think using the word strict liability puts people on their heels because they don't

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.680
expect you to understand or use those words. But any lawyer worth their salt definitely knows

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.320
that strict liability is two words you don't say in front of a pharmaceutical company.

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.320
Investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events or

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:19.440
investigate the use of a coordinated effort of messaging to lie about mass casualty events.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:24.480
As Jessica Hawket seems to have uncovered in New York and in Chicago and in

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.960
her not in Chicago, in New York and in Italy with Jonathan Engler. And then of course,

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.480
I want to look into transfection. I want to look into the use of clones. But I don't think

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:41.920
you need to look very hard because that's the way RNA virology is done. So take back your sovereignty

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.840
of you and your children. Get out of the who get out of the UN and the CDC of the United States.

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.880
And if you want to know who these people are, you will see that they don't use the word

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.520
transfection. They don't talk about clones. And if they do, they say it's dumb. They make fun of

01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:01.040
the Scooby-Doo. They make fun of the idea that the government might use an elaborate hoax instead

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.240
of an actual bio weapon. And they make fun of the idea that you would object to all vaccines

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.560
because vaccines are some of the greatest things ever invented. And they don't talk about strict

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.600
liability at all, even when their father is a patent lawyer that used to work for the Kennedy

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:23.120
administration. Ladies and gentlemen, they are doing this because they know that as the population

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.320
decreases over the next couple generations, they will be losing the opportunity to collect this data.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.360
And so they want your kids and they want your kids kids. That's what this is all about.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:40.160
It's about their AI. It's about the idea that they've lied to one another and each other

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.360
about eventually all this stuff's going to come together and it's going to be one great big singularity

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:51.520
moment. It's a mythology, ladies and gentlemen. It is a mythology. They've been telling each

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.320
other for decades and it's not getting any closer to being real. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.720
stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:09.280
means necessary. This has been giga-owned biological where intramuscular injection in any combination

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.000
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, where transfection and

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.560
healthy humans is criminally negligent and where viruses are not patterned in tegrides.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:48:03.040
Hey ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. If you can, please take the time to share my

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:11.600
work on the internet anywhere where you frequent and if you can, please help me recruit people

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:20.800
that have the financial wherewithal to contribute $10 a month or to contribute $290 a year or

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:28.640
contribute $81 every three months to help my family keep this going. I do put a lot of work

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:33.680
into these streams. I put a lot of reading into these things and a lot of thought into it and

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:40.880
it's going to get a lot better if I can find the support and so without a doubt I'd like to thank

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:53.760
all these people. And thank you for watching and I will see you again tomorrow.

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:04.400
That was a nice one. Man, oh man, what could they do if they had a bunch of people in the right

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.080
places, right? What could they do if they had a bunch of people in the right places

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:15.360
controlling the narrative and making sure that everybody believed that there was a novel pathogen

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:23.280
and that RNA was the answer. Imagine what they could have done if they had a bunch of people in

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.760
in all the dark places in the internet pushing a worst-case scenario so that even if you tried

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:36.720
to figure out what was going on you'd only find bad news. Imagine if they had intercepted some

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.960
of the doctors that showed up in New York City very early and offered them fame and comfort to

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.240
do the narrative for them for a little while on social media to make sure that the worst-case

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:55.200
scenario was taken seriously and that the compliance numbers were as high as possible. Imagine what

01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.400
would happen if they made a bunch of really beautiful high-colored high-resolution computer

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:09.120
animated videos about the illusion of consensus about the the immunology surrounding the counter

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.640
measure and the immunology surrounding infection so that it would be very easy to spread these bad

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.880
ideas across the internet, across languages, across cultures. Just imagine what would happen if they did

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:34.000
that.
