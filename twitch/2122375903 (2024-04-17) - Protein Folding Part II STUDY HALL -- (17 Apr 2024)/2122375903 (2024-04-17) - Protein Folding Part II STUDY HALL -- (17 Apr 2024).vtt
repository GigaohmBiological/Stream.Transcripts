WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
go, I think this is going to work. Okay, so remember, we're getting into this faith in

00:06.360 --> 00:11.120
a novel virus, and they have faith in a novel biology, it's actually morphed into this faith

00:11.120 --> 00:17.160
in a novel virology, a virology, excuse me, that revolves around a gain of function RNA

00:17.160 --> 00:23.080
virus, it involves around particular, particular pieces of that RNA that made it extra special,

00:23.080 --> 00:29.120
it involves transfection working, but not working for being rushed, being adulterated

00:29.120 --> 00:33.700
or having chosen the wrong protein. That wrong protein is the spike protein that from

00:33.700 --> 00:40.320
very early on in 2020, here in the first year already, was being lambasted by many different

00:40.320 --> 00:46.840
people in the narrative and in the media about being a gain of function protein that the

00:46.840 --> 00:52.080
protein itself was the evidence. And then later the protein is a toxin later, the protein

00:52.080 --> 00:59.080
was causing amyloidosis, prion disease, etc. And so this whole, this whole mythology,

00:59.080 --> 01:05.920
this immuno mythology that they have, they have, they have seeded around the novel virus,

01:05.920 --> 01:11.460
has gotten quite, quite expansive. And the part that we're working on here with these

01:11.460 --> 01:15.480
two streams, the one that I just ended in the one I'm starting now, is understanding

01:15.480 --> 01:21.000
protein folding in the context of prion disease, so that we can get an idea of where they

01:21.040 --> 01:26.720
have exaggerated, where they have simplified, and how we can, how we can bring this back

01:26.720 --> 01:31.920
into a really reasonable focus where the sacred aspects of biology, the irreducible

01:31.920 --> 01:37.520
complexity of biology is met with a certain reverence that right now it's, it just is

01:37.520 --> 01:44.400
not given. So what we're really working with here is a faith in a novel biology, it's

01:44.400 --> 01:50.280
a mythology that covers for the expected damage as we transition into population wide testing

01:50.280 --> 01:57.040
of transfection technology. So they know that amyloidosis and prion disease and protein

01:57.040 --> 02:02.560
misfolding and this kind of damage are going to occur over time if they continue to transfect

02:02.560 --> 02:07.680
old people and young people alike. And they, they expect it to go up, they expect it to

02:07.680 --> 02:13.080
show up from already the, the people that have been transfected multiple times. And

02:13.080 --> 02:20.440
I believe this because it was also included in the spars pandemic narrative on page 48,

02:20.440 --> 02:25.920
you can find a little talk about how three years after the rollout of the, of the vaccine

02:25.920 --> 02:33.680
for spars, that a bunch of people develop some kind of, of, of crowds felt yock of disease

02:33.680 --> 02:38.040
and it was blamed on the, on the vaccine and a lot of people were upset. And it started

02:38.040 --> 02:44.880
to undermine the way that people felt about the public health system. It's in their little

02:44.880 --> 02:51.600
Rockefeller tabletop exercise called the spars pandemic, you can find it. And so without

02:51.600 --> 02:56.600
a doubt, what they learned from that tabletop exercise and others was that if they wanted

02:56.600 --> 03:02.000
to cover up for this, the easiest way to do it would be to see a lot of these potential

03:02.000 --> 03:07.360
worst case scenarios into the gain of function story in the beginning of the pandemic. So

03:07.400 --> 03:12.600
that by the time those things manifested, it would be too lost in that narrative of lab

03:12.600 --> 03:17.560
leak or natural virus. And the whole acceptance of a circulating novel pathogen would have

03:17.560 --> 03:24.240
already happened years earlier. And that's where we are right now. That's why, that's

03:24.240 --> 03:25.440
why we need to watch this.

03:30.280 --> 03:36.600
Guess it was me that was, it was clipping here. Somehow I have everything. Oh, I see it

03:36.600 --> 03:43.840
now. Sorry, I got it. I got it. I got it. It was a knob, a knob, a very knob that had

03:43.840 --> 03:50.880
been brushed by a looks like it got pulled by the headphone wire there. Now I see it. Now

03:50.880 --> 03:57.120
I know why my my my my levels were. So there, there was the little morbid title that I was

03:57.120 --> 04:02.520
going to use proteins and protein folding with a dead lady from MIT. That's this one. I'm

04:02.560 --> 04:11.880
going to get rid of this. And I'm going to bring up a new window from my word file here, part B.

04:13.560 --> 04:24.600
That would be this one. So we got the idea that maybe we could use those these cells as

04:24.600 --> 04:28.640
I'm sort of living test tube. And the reason why we would want to do that is there's no

04:28.640 --> 04:32.040
organism. So this is starting in the middle. I got to go to the front. Sorry about that. Here

04:32.040 --> 04:37.520
we go. So here we go. I'm going to put it at 1.5 speed. Hope you can handle it. I think that

04:37.520 --> 04:39.320
should be normal. Now we're used to it.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.080
Remember the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and I work at the Whitehead Institute at MIT. I work

04:44.080 --> 04:48.080
on a variety of different protein folding problems. And in my last lecture, I told you a video

04:48.240 --> 04:50.720
brought introduction to the problem for how it manifested. I think it's a little bit

04:50.720 --> 04:55.320
how it manifested in infectious diseases and more broadly how it is used by cancers to drive

04:55.320 --> 04:58.440
them in the living state. In this lecture, I'd like to tell you about a different aspect

04:58.440 --> 05:02.040
of protein pathology, another equally devastating aspect of protein folding and pathology, the

05:02.040 --> 05:05.000
neurodegenerative diseases, because all of these diseases are diseases of protein and

05:05.000 --> 05:09.960
swollen. This is a extremely vivid demonstration of the difference between the brain of a normal

05:09.960 --> 05:16.120
adult, a pine autopsy, versus adult who died of Alzheimer's disease. It's obviously devastating

05:16.120 --> 05:19.480
disease. And this is why the people who have these diseases lose their memory, lose control

05:19.480 --> 05:22.920
of functions. Okay, sorry. Diseases are really terrible.

05:23.640 --> 05:30.200
Now, this is a graph of what's happened to human longevity over the last couple hundred years.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.800
And it's really, I think this is the red and the black are just two different calculations.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.480
It's not so easy in the going back to the older days to calculate when exactly how old people

05:37.480 --> 05:40.680
lived on average. But these two very different ways of doing it came out with the same answer.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.640
And you can see that there's been the steady march of progress and it's just been amazing.

05:43.640 --> 05:52.200
Wait, where's the drop off for is World War I then going to be considered the flu? I thought

05:52.200 --> 05:57.560
the flu showed up on that one graph all by itself. It was just the flu not World War I or

05:57.560 --> 06:03.240
anything like it was just the flu. Remember? Holy cow. Now she says it's World War. So that's cool.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.160
This has been I think one of the glories of mankind to be able to do this and alter their

06:07.160 --> 06:11.160
own average lifespan. And it's been due to many different factors due to changes in public health,

06:11.160 --> 06:16.040
cleaner drinking water, due to refrigeration and preservation of food and cooking. It's due to

06:16.040 --> 06:20.360
the development of antibiotics, the development of vaccines, the development of anesthesia. So

06:20.360 --> 06:23.960
you could do surgery on people and correct illnesses that way. So anyway, this wonderful

06:23.960 --> 06:30.840
steady, steady progress of mankind is unfortunately in some ways of thinking about it a road to ruin

06:30.840 --> 06:35.160
because as we are curing these other diseases, as we're living longer and longer lives,

06:35.720 --> 06:39.960
we are finding that the incidents of neurodegenerative diseases are going out. These diseases used to

06:39.960 --> 06:45.480
be practically unheard of 100 years ago. Now there's a very large fraction of people around the world

06:45.480 --> 06:49.400
that are suffering from these diseases. And as we extend lifespan, it's getting worse and worse.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.560
There are 5 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease alone. And the same increase

06:53.560 --> 06:58.680
in disease is occurring for all of the neurodegenerative diseases across our globe. So unfortunately,

06:58.680 --> 07:03.000
with respect to neurodegeneration and it being a road to ruin, this is why I say a road to ruin,

07:03.960 --> 07:08.280
we're headed for neurodegeneration and right now there's no exit. We do not have a single therapy

07:08.280 --> 07:12.280
that really fixes these problems. So these are some of the common and uncommon neurodegenerative

07:12.280 --> 07:15.560
diseases you might have heard about Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, frontal temporal

07:15.560 --> 07:19.880
dementia, Huntington's ALS and Croissphal Yacob disease. And you can see these brown blobs

07:19.880 --> 07:24.200
inside of these cells. And those brown blobs are aggravated proteins, like those aggregates of

07:24.200 --> 07:29.880
Friday I showed you earlier. And as I said, there are all these neurodegenerative diseases

07:29.880 --> 07:33.800
are protein folding diseases and there's not a single therapeutic strategy that cures the

07:33.800 --> 07:39.000
underlying protein pathology. We have some things that address some symptoms in some of these diseases,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.320
but for the most part, we're pretty helpless against them. So I've been working on protein

07:43.320 --> 07:46.440
folding for a long time and I've worked on a lot of different organisms. And the one thing

07:46.440 --> 07:49.800
that my studies over the years have taught me is that this problem, as I mentioned earlier,

07:49.800 --> 07:55.400
is common to all organisms on earth. And so we got the kind of crazy idea that considering the

07:55.400 --> 08:01.640
eukaryotic tree of life, you see, plants, animals and fungi actually split from each other not that

08:01.640 --> 08:07.080
long ago in terms of evolution. So we thought we might be able to take advantage of this similarity

08:07.080 --> 08:12.280
and to study some of these really difficult, really complicated diseases. Yes, we will not be able

08:12.280 --> 08:16.440
to study many different aspects of protein folding neurodegenerative disease in a simpler

08:16.440 --> 08:20.760
organism. But if we could study some aspects of the precipitating, initiating protein pathology,

08:20.760 --> 08:24.040
the cellular pathology, not the complexity of the disease as a whole, but just the initiating,

08:24.040 --> 08:27.720
precipitating pathology from those proteins in a simple organism, we might be able to move

08:27.720 --> 08:31.000
much more quickly than we would if we had that we can find solely to working on these more complex

08:31.000 --> 08:37.240
organisms. So as I mentioned, one of the things we have in common with yeast is a wide variety

08:37.240 --> 08:41.080
of systems for controlling the protein folding problem. So we have chaperone proteins which

08:41.720 --> 08:46.280
interact with highly reactive proteins that are not quite finished folding and prevent just like

08:46.280 --> 08:50.680
human chaperones, prevent them. Their charges from interacting inappropriately with other partners

08:50.680 --> 08:55.160
and until they're ready and mature, protein chaperones do the same thing. But we also have

08:55.160 --> 08:58.200
protein modeling factors, things that can rest those protein aggregates when they start to appear

08:58.200 --> 09:02.280
apart. We have osmolites, we have things called leproteosome, which degrade proteins that are

09:02.280 --> 09:06.040
that are not properly folded, ubiquitin, ubiquitin ligases, and that entire system is just completely

09:06.040 --> 09:11.240
conserved from yeast to human cells. It's not just that. Lipid biology is actually quite highly

09:11.240 --> 09:14.680
conserved. There certainly are differences of lipid biology at least in human cells, but for

09:14.680 --> 09:19.240
example cholesterol, yeast use a very closely related lipid called regastrol for exactly the

09:19.240 --> 09:23.320
same reason that we use cholesterol to control the fluidity of membranes and to control the movement

09:23.320 --> 09:28.520
and density of proteins within those membranes. And they move packages of membrane-bounded proteins

09:28.520 --> 09:32.840
around the cell in very highly orchestrated ways, really the same way that a nerve cell will move

09:32.840 --> 09:36.280
dopamine around. The yeast cells will move things like mating factors around.

09:38.040 --> 09:43.240
So she says that we move dopamine around in little vesicles. That's all we do is

09:43.240 --> 09:49.240
neurotransmitters around in little vesicles. That's really sad because we know in the brain there are

09:49.240 --> 09:55.800
at least vesicles of RNA that are released of the arc protein, which cause local actin skeleton

09:55.800 --> 10:01.240
remodeling to be possible in neighboring cells that weren't necessarily activated by the same

10:01.880 --> 10:09.480
genetic or neuronal signal that the postsynaptic neuron was. And so the postsynaptic neuron can

10:09.480 --> 10:15.240
release virus-like particles that contain the mRNA of the arc gene cause arc protein to be

10:15.240 --> 10:22.600
expressed locally at that synapse and cause remodeling of that local arc protein cytoskeleton

10:22.600 --> 10:28.520
in that neuron that was never activated by the synapse or the signal that came into the postsynaptic

10:29.160 --> 10:34.200
neuron. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm quite certain of it. So it's really funny,

10:34.200 --> 10:40.760
almost to the point of being a little bit... Why did you say that? If you say that like we

10:40.760 --> 10:47.720
move dopamine around these yeast proteins move all kinds of stuff around in their vesicles.

10:49.480 --> 10:55.560
We know that there's extracellular signaling between tissue using extracellular vesicles

10:55.560 --> 11:01.160
called exosomes. I'm sure she knows it too. She's got to know it. And if she doesn't, it's because

11:01.160 --> 11:07.000
of the intense compartmentalization of biology. Sosomes and peroxosomes, these are very complex

11:07.000 --> 11:09.880
organelles that are involved in doing very complicated functions. Some of them are involved in degrading

11:09.880 --> 11:13.320
proteins. Some of them are involved in a wide variety of metabolic actions that have to be

11:13.320 --> 11:17.640
segregated from the normal cytoplasm. These cells have both of those. They have autophagy. This

11:17.640 --> 11:22.200
is a process by which the cell actually directs its degradation and eating machinery to eat up

11:22.200 --> 11:25.720
protein aggregates and get rid of them. Apoposis, a programmed form of cell death.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.760
Cell cycle, very complexly regulated cell cycle, regulated very, very differently bacteria,

11:30.760 --> 11:33.640
but in yeast and humans regulated in very much the same way. And in fact, studies of that cell

11:33.640 --> 11:37.240
cycle work extremely important for our understanding of cancer. And why cancer cells start to replicate

11:37.240 --> 11:41.320
uncontrollably, study them in yeast to provide its key insights. We have mitochondria, the

11:41.320 --> 11:44.760
energy factory of the cells, and mitochondria do amazing things in yeast and human cells.

11:44.760 --> 11:48.040
But they also are a place where reactive oxygen species are generated and can do a great deal

11:48.040 --> 11:51.400
of damage. And then there's a whole variety of signal transaction pathways. Again,

11:51.400 --> 11:56.280
these key pathways that control growth and development in us, but control responses to the

11:56.280 --> 11:59.720
environment, responses to other cells, and responses to internal and external stresses,

11:59.720 --> 12:04.680
those same signaling pathways have been controlled, have been preserved rather in yeast and higher

12:04.680 --> 12:10.040
eukaryotes. So, calcinarism, example, map kinases, G-coupled protein receptors,

12:10.040 --> 12:13.880
all of these were first developed long ago in eukaryotic life, and greatly greatly elaborated

12:13.880 --> 12:17.080
in us. We have many, many more G-coupled receptors than a yeast cell has, for example.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.360
But the basic machinery and the basic concepts and the basic ways in which those signaling pathways

12:21.400 --> 12:25.000
drive processes inside the cell are similar. So, we got the idea that maybe we could

12:25.000 --> 12:28.760
use those yeast cells as our living test tube, and the reason why we want to do that is there's

12:28.760 --> 12:34.200
no organism on Earth that we can manipulate and get to tell us its secrets better than yeast.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.160
It has an absolutely unrivaled toolkit, and it really derives from brewers back about 150 years

12:39.160 --> 12:42.520
ago wanting to make better beer, and wanting to understand that organism and how to manipulate it,

12:42.520 --> 12:47.560
and it's taken off from there, and it's just amazing. Massive, massive numbers of people have

12:47.560 --> 12:52.120
been building and developing technologies that allow us to knock out every gene in the genome,

12:52.120 --> 12:55.480
or overexpress every gene in the genome, make point mutants wherever we want in the genome,

12:55.480 --> 12:58.440
and so that's just something we can't do in any other organism at this level today.

12:59.160 --> 13:05.320
So, here's how we set things up. We have yeast cells that are growing on, in the top row there,

13:05.320 --> 13:09.000
they're growing on glucose medium. In the bottom portion of the panel, they're growing on lactose

13:09.000 --> 13:14.360
medium. We have a gene that will turn on whenever we give the cells lactose, and so we make a

13:14.360 --> 13:18.840
recombinant form of that gene that now, well, instead of making the proteins that these cells use for

13:18.840 --> 13:24.200
lactose utilization, they make different proteins that misfold in human diseases, like alpha-synuclein,

13:24.200 --> 13:29.480
A-beta, TVP-43, and TIN-TIN-FUS. And you can see that we've built, for synuclein here, we've

13:29.480 --> 13:32.680
shown you all three different strains that are expressed in a protein at different levels,

13:32.680 --> 13:35.960
and are exhibiting different levels of toxicity, just by the fact that they can't grow very well,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.920
and we've then done that with all of those different disease proteins, and we've matched them so that

13:38.920 --> 13:43.320
they have the same level of toxicity. So, same level of toxicity from different proteins,

13:43.320 --> 13:47.640
what I said is just some non-specific protein aggregation mess. It turns out that it's not,

13:47.640 --> 13:51.400
but when those proteins misfold inside of the yeast cell, they go into the cell, they interact

13:51.400 --> 13:55.160
with the same kinds of highly conserved constituents that they interact with in a neuron, and they do

13:55.160 --> 13:59.640
bad things in a very specific way. So, here's an example of a phenotype that glob over there

14:00.520 --> 14:04.680
is protein nitration, and it's happening all of the cells at the same level of toxicity,

14:04.680 --> 14:08.200
the nitration damage is happening really only in the cells that are expressing

14:08.200 --> 14:11.960
alpha-synuclein. That's really interesting, because in the human diseases that are known to be caused

14:11.960 --> 14:15.480
by the misfolding of alpha-synuclein, and that is Parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy,

14:15.480 --> 14:20.520
Lewy body, dementia, and nerve-brain iron accumulation, they too show very high levels of very specific

14:20.520 --> 14:24.600
protein aggregates with nitration. So, very unique and very specific cellular pathologies directly

14:24.600 --> 14:29.800
related to the human disease. So, here's our cells, we've got this gene that we can turn on with

14:29.800 --> 14:33.160
galactose, anaerobic galactose, and we've hooked it up to GFP, just so that we could see what was

14:33.160 --> 14:37.480
happening to it in the cells, as they were either healthy or a guy. And when we had just one or two

14:37.480 --> 14:40.440
copies of the protein in the cells, they would find, and the protein went out to the membrane,

14:40.440 --> 14:45.560
which is where it should belong. And if we had more, one extra copy, we started seeing things

14:45.560 --> 14:49.400
going along, and then if we had two extra copies, it went even worse, this does not look good,

14:49.400 --> 14:53.640
they said protein conglomerates here in aggregation, type some type of aggregation, and then those

14:53.640 --> 14:58.520
cells grow fine, those cells grow slowly, and those cells die. Very, very strong dosage difference,

14:59.080 --> 15:01.720
and what's really interesting about that, is that's true in man as well.

15:02.040 --> 15:07.480
So, it's really important for you to understand that there is one gigantic caveat here, which I

15:07.480 --> 15:17.880
find almost disturbing. Green fluorescent protein is a massive protein, native to jellyfish that

15:17.880 --> 15:24.520
glows in the dark green. If you attach that massive protein to alpha-synuclein, I would be

15:24.520 --> 15:29.960
willing to bet that that cartoon up there is wrong, the GFP is a lot bigger than alpha-synuclein.

15:32.040 --> 15:36.760
Could be wrong, you look it up yourself and find out if I'm right or wrong, or whether that cartoon

15:36.760 --> 15:43.480
is right or wrong, but the point is, is that GFP is not small, and overexpressing GFP in any cell

15:43.480 --> 15:52.280
line, or in any mammal tissue will result in cell death. Because that level of GFP is toxic,

15:52.280 --> 15:58.280
if you can see it like this, it's already a lot of molecules, a lot of molecules of GFP in order

15:58.280 --> 16:05.400
to see that signal. If it starts to make these kinds of, these kinds of, uh, punctate sort of

16:05.400 --> 16:13.960
constructs of, of, of the cell is, is putting this GFP into vesicles to get rid of it, to keep it,

16:13.960 --> 16:22.440
to keep it compartmentalized, so it's already beyond toxic levels. And she is very conveniently

16:22.520 --> 16:30.200
ignoring that fact, because there are no controls here with, with just GFP, right, to show what

16:30.200 --> 16:35.560
GFP toxicity looks like, but I can guarantee you, I can tell you from experience that GFP

16:35.560 --> 16:43.400
toxicity is real. Over expression of GFP causes toxicity is very, very real, and that is toxic

16:43.400 --> 16:50.440
levels already in the middle. And anybody that's used GFP to label neurons in a mouse brain could

16:50.440 --> 16:55.160
tell you that anybody that's used GFP as a label for anything can tell you that because if you get

16:55.160 --> 17:04.440
a good good signal, you also get dead cells. It's extraordinary. And this is the kind of science

17:04.440 --> 17:10.040
that passes for knowledge creation at this time. This is how we got here. This is, you know, how

17:10.040 --> 17:19.960
many years ago is this eight? Just the basic principle of this is silly because the GFP is not

17:19.960 --> 17:27.720
just a glow in the dark tag. It's a 10,000. It's a huge thing. Let's just, I'm just going to look

17:27.720 --> 17:37.800
it up because I don't know. Green, fluorescent protein, and there will probably be a Wikipedia

17:37.800 --> 17:48.680
page right there. Green fluorescent protein has a wavelength blah, blah, blah. Natural protein is

17:48.680 --> 17:55.800
238 amino acids. It's 27 kilodultans. And then let's look up alpha synuclein.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.720
140 amino acids. So what is it bigger?

18:12.520 --> 18:21.560
238. No, it's bigger. 140 by 238. So it's roughly twice the size of it, you see? So this is not the

18:21.560 --> 18:27.720
right, this is not the right cartoon. It's a much bigger protein. And she is pretending that that

18:27.720 --> 18:33.160
much bigger protein has no effect on whether the cells are healthy or not. It's all the alpha

18:33.720 --> 18:43.000
synuclein. That's it. That's impressive.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.360
Things that have just one extra copy of the wild type of synuclein protein will get early onset

18:48.360 --> 18:51.320
Parkinson's disease. And if they have two extra copies, they'll get even earlier, more virulent

18:51.320 --> 18:56.840
form of the disease. So this unusual, I mean, ask yourself, why does it need to be tied to GFP?

18:56.840 --> 19:01.400
If you know that alpha synuclein is being expressed by the cells, why can't you stain for it? Why do

19:01.400 --> 19:09.480
you need to tie it to GFP? When GFP is a gigantic toxin, a gigantic toxic protein at high fluorescent

19:09.480 --> 19:16.200
levels, it's extraordinary. Extreme sensitivity to exactly how much protein you're making was

19:16.200 --> 19:19.800
certainly, was certainly reminiscent of what was happening in man. So how can we get a better idea

19:19.800 --> 19:22.840
of what's going on here if there's anything really deeper involved? Well, we do something

19:22.840 --> 19:28.600
called screen first, you could do a control for the GFP. Meaning we screen every gene in the genome

19:28.600 --> 19:31.720
for what makes cells better or worse. We can take with these, we have libraries,

19:31.720 --> 19:34.520
every gene in the genome, we can turn them up or turn them down and see how that changes

19:34.520 --> 19:38.520
the disease manifestation. And in these cells that have the four copies where they're just

19:38.520 --> 19:42.120
playing frankly dying of the disease, we can screen for chemical compounds that might rescue them.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.640
And studying those compounds might tell us something about the disease mythology.

19:45.640 --> 19:52.920
So I love the fact that she uses mite, but it's exactly how science is done. You declare

19:53.720 --> 20:00.040
a rough shot experiment, a suitable model for a disease, and then you go for it.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.360
That's what she did just there, right? She said, this is a pretty suitable model for disease.

20:04.360 --> 20:10.600
Why don't we use the four copy version for a model of disease and we'll screen compounds

20:10.600 --> 20:14.840
on it? Holy cow, that'll pay for at least two postdocs in five years of my lab.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.280
Compounds that might rescue them. And studying those compounds might tell us something about

20:18.280 --> 20:23.160
the disease mythology. So screening is a lot like panning for gold. You go through a whole

20:23.160 --> 20:25.960
lot of stuff and you look through it, you look through it and you look through it and you find

20:25.960 --> 20:28.760
nothing for a while, and then all of a sudden you get these and then get some gold. And you get,

20:28.760 --> 20:33.000
so out of the 6,000 genes in the yeast genome that we studied, only about 60 or 70 of them in

20:33.000 --> 20:35.880
our initial studies seem to matter with respect to alpha-snooplane. And the genes that we got out

20:35.880 --> 20:38.840
of our alpha-snooplane screens were completely different than the genes we got out of our

20:38.840 --> 20:41.320
beta screens and completely different than the ones we got of our proteins in the screen.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.760
And they told us something about the biology. Because for example, the largest class of genes

20:44.760 --> 20:47.560
we got were genes that were involved in busgal trafficking, moving those numbering bounded,

20:47.560 --> 20:52.520
proteinaceous compartments around the cell. And so when I showed you these protein conglomerations

20:52.520 --> 20:57.800
or these aggregated forms of protein in this cellular model of the alpha-snooplane pathology,

20:57.800 --> 21:02.520
it turns out that when we got that result, the genes that saved the yeast cells from that pathology

21:02.520 --> 21:05.080
were genes that were involved in moving little vesicles around. We thought, well,

21:05.080 --> 21:09.080
gee, I wonder if those things actually have something to do with vesicle trafficking. And so

21:09.080 --> 21:12.120
when we look at the level of the electron microscope, which allows a much, much higher

21:12.120 --> 21:16.520
resolution of the cell, you can see that, yes, these little vesicles that are packed with proteins

21:17.160 --> 21:20.840
depending on how much the alpha-snooplane we're expressing, we get more and more of these protein

21:20.840 --> 21:23.560
aggregates. And then we did something called immuno-electron microscopy.

21:23.560 --> 21:30.200
This is absolutely terrible, right? You know, if this is the same cell model that she's looking

21:30.200 --> 21:36.120
at under the microscope here, under the electron microscope, she has no idea whether this is from

21:36.120 --> 21:40.040
the alpha-synuclein or whether it's from the overexpression of the GFP, or whether the

21:40.040 --> 21:52.680
combination of both would do it. I just can't, I can't really fathom how bad this is. I got to

21:52.680 --> 21:57.240
believe that these papers have some controls or something in them, but I'm scared that they don't.

21:58.040 --> 22:02.280
We attached a label to an antibody against the alpha-synuclein and against a protein involved

22:02.280 --> 22:05.160
in vesicle trafficking, and we found that they were there together. So these blobs, these green

22:05.160 --> 22:09.720
blobs here, are actually blobs, not just of aggregated cineuclin, but aggregated cineuclin

22:09.720 --> 22:13.720
enmeshed in vesicles that are not moving around the cell and getting to the places they're supposed

22:13.720 --> 22:16.680
to be. And when that happens in a nerve cell, it's really disastrous because that's one of the

22:16.680 --> 22:19.960
major ways in which a nerve cells communicate with each other. That's so good for a yeast cell

22:19.960 --> 22:24.600
either. Anyway, this finding that alpha-synuclein blocks vesicle trafficking has not been corroborated

22:24.600 --> 22:29.080
by many other laboratories. And to cut a long story short and move on to the very final stage of

22:29.080 --> 22:32.360
this talk, we found that there were parallel effects, we moved back and forth between these

22:32.360 --> 22:37.400
two neurons, and we found that there were parallel effects. We moved back and forth between yeast

22:37.400 --> 22:42.280
and neurons, and you've got to be very careful when biologists are claiming to be able to do things

22:42.280 --> 22:46.440
like that. Not just vesicle trafficking, but bursts of reactive nitrogen species, as I showed you in

22:46.440 --> 22:50.840
that protein block, mitochondrial dysfunction, and perturbations in middle line homeostasis. So

22:50.840 --> 22:54.040
at least at this early, very simple cellular level, there's a lot of similarities there.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.440
But we really needed to be able to show that the genes we found in yeast, and the genes that

22:58.440 --> 23:02.040
saved the yeast cells, those same genes would matter to a neuron. So we actually looked at,

23:02.040 --> 23:05.480
in a couple of different systems initially, one was this wonderful nematode system,

23:05.480 --> 23:08.520
it was a worm, it's a simple little worm, but it's got lots of different kinds of neurons,

23:08.520 --> 23:13.000
and in fact it's got the same kind of neurons, dopaminergic neurons, that are adversely affected

23:13.000 --> 23:16.760
in Parkinson's disease. And we could actually peer through, wire up those cells to express

23:16.760 --> 23:19.960
alpha-synuclein, and mire them up so that they were green, they glow green, we could actually

23:19.960 --> 23:23.800
study them in a living worm, and we could see that when the worms were expressing alpha-synuclein

23:23.800 --> 23:27.240
in those cells, you can see how some of them are disappearing over there. It's a true neurodegenerative

23:27.240 --> 23:31.880
model in the nematode. And our genes that rescue the yeast cells also rescue that nematode.

23:31.880 --> 23:36.440
And the same thing happened when we took neurons from rat brains, the midbrain region of the rat,

23:36.440 --> 23:40.600
which is the corresponding region that's affected Parkinson's in humans. So that was pretty encouraging.

23:40.600 --> 23:46.040
Next thing we did was to screen a chemical lab. Of course there she said that she's taking embryonic

23:46.040 --> 23:51.880
rat neurons from a particular brain region, and then she's culturing them and using them as a model as

23:51.880 --> 23:58.760
well. Just be clear, this one looks like it has a GFP-only stain, so this one looks like it's GFP

23:58.760 --> 24:03.560
only, this one looks like it might be, then alpha-synuclein, I got to get this alpha-synuclein

24:03.560 --> 24:09.800
plus GFP. I mean, it seems like that's a better experiment than the one she showed us, at least

24:09.800 --> 24:13.800
there's some evidence there was a control there. So you could assume that maybe there was a control

24:13.800 --> 24:19.160
back there where I was losing my mind, but I'm not sure. I don't know. I hope so.

24:19.240 --> 24:42.600
So we're doing here is taking a human protein, expressing it in C. elegans, and then having those

24:42.600 --> 24:51.240
neurons die. Is that really surprising? Alpha-synuclein would be a protein that would be foreign

24:51.240 --> 24:55.480
technically, right? However, they got it in there, however they put it in there and be interesting to see

24:57.240 --> 25:03.080
to think about, what did she say she did with this? Six hits from yeast screen validated in both

25:03.080 --> 25:07.480
nematode and neuron models, so the midbrain region of the rat. Which is the corresponding region that's

25:07.480 --> 25:11.000
affected Parkinson's in humans. So they want to be used to rescue the yeast cell, also rescued

25:11.000 --> 25:15.560
that nematode. And the same thing happened when we took neurons from rat brains in the brain region

25:15.560 --> 25:20.120
of the rat, which is left. And the same thing happened. So supposedly they expressed alpha-synuclein,

25:20.120 --> 25:24.920
and then those those, but overexpression of protein doesn't necessarily is not surprisingly

25:24.920 --> 25:30.600
toxic. That's normally toxic. So I'm still curious as to where this is going. A corresponding

25:30.600 --> 25:34.280
region that's affected Parkinson's in humans. So that was pretty encouraging. Next thing we do

25:34.280 --> 25:38.840
is to screen a chemical library. And this again is something that is so much easier to do in yeast.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.360
We asked whether we could find compounds that would fix more than one problem. I told you there

25:42.360 --> 25:45.320
lots of different things going on. There's a cascade of pathology that gets kicked off by those

25:45.320 --> 25:48.760
misfolded proteins. And can we find one that compounds that can fix more than one of those

25:48.760 --> 25:54.040
problems? So and the next question was can we use yeast genetics to find a target? So why would

25:54.040 --> 25:59.880
this matter? Well, we could screen through. Can we use yeast genetics to find the target? So you

25:59.880 --> 26:05.000
see what she's doing here. She's developing the same kind of screening techniques across genome

26:05.000 --> 26:11.720
libraries that would eventually be employed by the actual project on humans. He just

26:11.720 --> 26:18.600
need the computing power in the data facility. And this is at MIT Whitehead. It's at the same

26:18.600 --> 26:22.840
institute that developed all the stuff for the human genome project. It's at the same institute

26:22.840 --> 26:30.280
from which the patents that that Kevin McCurnan built his his many companies from came from.

26:30.600 --> 26:40.600
And so we're talking about all the same basic mythology, which is designed to make you think that

26:40.600 --> 26:46.200
on the basis of studying disease and public health that that they're they're developing

26:46.200 --> 26:51.160
techniques to help people when in reality they are developing techniques, which will ultimately

26:51.160 --> 26:57.080
be used to mine the human population for as much medical and genomic data as possible.

26:57.160 --> 27:01.080
And of course, they have to start with something simple that has all the basic parts of our

27:01.080 --> 27:06.200
cellular physiology like yeast. And if they can do it in a single-celled organism like yeast,

27:06.200 --> 27:11.480
then they can eventually expand to a multicellular organism and eventually to us. That's what this

27:11.480 --> 27:16.920
is all about. Did it that screen through 500,000 chemical compounds asking for which ones were

27:16.920 --> 27:21.960
able to rescue these cells? That kind of a screen which took us several months would take, I don't

27:22.120 --> 27:26.040
know, maybe a hundred thousand years if you were using a mouse. And also probably, I don't know,

27:26.040 --> 27:29.480
billions and billions of dollars. We did it much more cheaply, much more easily, much more rapidly

27:29.480 --> 27:33.400
in these cells. And of course, you heard Ray Kurzweiler say that we're not going to do this in mice

27:33.400 --> 27:42.680
or in people. We'll do it in synthetic computerized people, synthetic biology and in silico biology.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.640
The other reason why it mattered was that these cells offered, as I mentioned earlier, they are

27:47.640 --> 27:51.640
unparalleled genetics. And so we're actually able to take advantage of that genetics to figure out

27:51.640 --> 27:55.720
what those compounds were doing to save the cell and then go back into neurons and ask

27:55.720 --> 27:59.240
whether those same compounds would work in the neurons and would those compounds fix the same

27:59.240 --> 28:03.960
pathologies that are taking place in the neurons. And it worked. So we screened 500, 50,000 compounds.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.560
Simply asked for restoring growth. We've got a lot of genes, don't know which one is the right one

28:07.560 --> 28:11.320
to try to go after. We just looked for something that would have stored growth. And we've only

28:11.320 --> 28:14.200
dissected a few of these compounds so far, but they merely raid vascular trafficking defects,

28:14.200 --> 28:17.640
they merely rate mitochondrial defects, and they work the ones we've tested in nematode,

28:17.640 --> 28:22.440
react, and human neurons. So the final piece of the story is to turn towards human

28:22.440 --> 28:26.520
IPS cells made from patients that have one of these diseases. This has been one of the most

28:26.520 --> 28:30.600
exciting aspects of revolutionary aspects of biology in terms of being able to devise better

28:30.600 --> 28:35.560
treatments for patients. And so this is interesting because this is one of the technologies that I

28:35.560 --> 28:39.000
think when I was going into neuroscience, what I thought was kind of cool was that they're going

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
to do is they're going to take cells from the patient, they're going to induce them to form

28:43.720 --> 28:49.240
the tissue that you want to study in the laboratory that you think would have in

28:49.240 --> 28:55.320
genetic similarity to the patient in question. And then you could do your screening on the

28:55.320 --> 29:00.120
preparation that was made from the patient's cells, but never need any patient sample other

29:00.120 --> 29:04.920
than that. I thought that was kind of a cool idea in theory.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.080
Skin cells from a patient can actually de-differentiate those skin cells into an embryonic surge state

29:09.080 --> 29:13.480
and then re-differentiate them into neurons. And another amazing technology that's been developed

29:13.480 --> 29:18.200
recently by many other investigators has been the ability to surgically genetically edit

29:18.200 --> 29:22.040
those cells such that you have corrected just the mutation that's responsible for that person's

29:22.040 --> 29:26.760
disease. And so you have absolutely genetically identical cell types here. The only difference

29:26.760 --> 29:32.520
between them is the difference that causes the disease. Well, there you go. That's what CRISPR

29:32.520 --> 29:38.280
now can do or they say can do with a lot of off-target side effects. But even Jessica Rose says the

29:38.280 --> 29:41.880
plan is to use CRISPR for personalized medicine. She announced it on our last

29:43.480 --> 29:48.360
substack as well as trying to speculate as to whether they're not already CRISPR-ed you in the

29:48.360 --> 29:53.880
shot. But definitely they will in the future. It was like a big announcement. But the idea that

29:53.880 --> 29:59.480
we should resist or that there was something to be stopped was not in that substack. It was actually

29:59.480 --> 30:05.160
she was sure that CRISPR was part of the plan in the future of personalized medicine and genetic

30:05.160 --> 30:11.160
modification of humans. Well, that's really great. And here it is already 10 years ago. They're

30:11.160 --> 30:14.760
talking about this stuff and they knew that this was the plan. They knew this was the way they were

30:14.760 --> 30:19.080
going to go and they slow walked us there. And I think that this MIT professor was probably part

30:19.080 --> 30:25.560
of it. They have to get you to believe that protein folding is a, you know, criticality.

30:25.560 --> 30:32.760
And it's a criticality upon which all of these pathologies depend. And then they get you to believe

30:32.760 --> 30:37.400
that because that's what they're focused on. Everything they look at has a play. And so in this

30:37.400 --> 30:42.840
case protein folding has that role. And so then you can ask whether or not you have any pathologies

30:42.840 --> 30:45.000
that are different between them and whether any of the things you've discovered earlier

30:45.000 --> 30:50.840
work against those pathologies except the cells looked pretty much identical. So how do we figure

30:50.840 --> 30:54.360
out what pathologies might be happening? Because after all these pathologies only manifest themselves

30:54.360 --> 30:57.960
in terms of human disease, even if people have these terrible mutations, they only manifest at

30:57.960 --> 31:03.480
the ages of 40, 50, 60. Yeah, so if you get all of academic biology to work on IPS cells for 10

31:03.480 --> 31:08.920
or 15 years, then at the same time you get all of biology to develop very, very, very,

31:10.120 --> 31:19.720
how do you say it homogenized and optimized techniques for using and leveraging IPS cell

31:19.720 --> 31:26.600
technologies. And that could very well include using them as medical technologies, medical

31:27.400 --> 31:32.440
interventions, even longevity, this kind of thing. And you don't have to have any academic

31:32.440 --> 31:40.840
biologists be aware of that. You just have to have the ongoing infrastructure to make sure that

31:40.840 --> 31:47.080
the remnants from all the hospitals and all the world that can produce IPS cells are always available

31:47.080 --> 31:51.560
and are always flowing and are always coordinated and are always there. And that's the way it is.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.080
None of that material goes to waste. It's way too valuable. And because it's not going to be

31:59.080 --> 32:05.080
there forever, we're not always going to have 350 million people in America and 100 million

32:05.080 --> 32:08.920
people needing a hospital every year. We're not going to have that forever. They don't plan to

32:08.920 --> 32:15.480
have that forever. So they need to gather all this data now. Seven years old. But we had the ability

32:15.480 --> 32:19.160
to go back to these cells and remember what we had learned from these cells and looked for

32:19.160 --> 32:23.400
those same pathologies arising in these cells long before they started to die. So long before

32:23.400 --> 32:26.440
this has started to die, we saw problems in the same problem in the vascular trafficking,

32:26.440 --> 32:31.800
the same problems in nitrosative damage, nitroic mitral stress. And when, and they did not happen

32:31.800 --> 32:35.240
in our Newton corrected cells, so that made us allow us to know that yes, not only were those

32:35.240 --> 32:38.920
pathologies happening, but those pathologies were due to the mutation that was causing that person's

32:38.920 --> 32:43.880
disease. And then we went back and we asked whether or not our compounds could rescue those cells

32:43.960 --> 32:48.600
and they could, at least the first few that we've tried have. And we then used yeast genetics,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.800
as I mentioned, a lot of complicated experiments I won't take you all through. But we used yeast

32:51.800 --> 32:55.560
genetics to figure out what the target of the compound was. And lo and behold, it turned out

32:55.560 --> 32:58.600
to be a very, very highly conserved ubiquitin ligase. You can see this is a cartoon of the

32:58.600 --> 33:02.920
different domains of the ubiquitin ligase in the yeast cell known as RSP5 and in human cells known

33:02.920 --> 33:08.120
as NED4. And basically every domain is conserved. And this is really an interesting kind of protein

33:08.120 --> 33:12.360
defined because the ubiquitin ligases are very large complex family in humans. There are about

33:12.360 --> 33:15.480
700 of them in humans. There are about 300 of them in yeast. And they've been very,

33:15.480 --> 33:18.680
very difficult for pharmaceutical companies to target when they take the protein out of the cell

33:18.680 --> 33:21.960
and try to do what they have done traditionally over the years to try to find chemical compounds

33:21.960 --> 33:25.240
that will alter the function of the protein in a purified system. And that is because the biology

33:25.240 --> 33:30.520
of these proteins really only manifests within the context of a living cell where all the proteins

33:30.520 --> 33:33.480
are very, very close together and crowded and moving around and changing their conformational

33:33.480 --> 33:38.120
states. That's where you see that this protein particularly matters. And this protein is very

33:38.120 --> 33:41.960
complicated when it would have been impossible to find without the kinds of simple chemical genetic

33:41.960 --> 33:45.960
methods that we use. So it really demonstrates I think pretty strongly that the power of phenotypic

33:45.960 --> 33:49.720
screens, if you're looking for compounds that really have very special properties, properties that can

33:49.720 --> 33:53.880
correct the disease pathology and the power of chemical genetics to figure out how those targets

33:53.880 --> 33:57.960
work. Now this is really only the beginning whether this will ever turn out to be a therapy or not,

33:57.960 --> 34:01.000
we don't know. But what it has done is showed us that this ubiquitin ligase plays a very key

34:01.000 --> 34:04.600
central role in the way that pathology, that cellular pathology is manifested in lots of different

34:04.600 --> 34:10.600
ways. And so it's certainly a useful tool. We're finding more and more of the genes that we found

34:10.680 --> 34:14.600
in these cells are useful tools in understanding the biology. And we hope one day maybe this will

34:14.600 --> 34:19.080
be a way of finding therapeutic compounds. But what I do believe is that we need these diseases

34:19.080 --> 34:22.840
are very, very difficult and we need to try every trick in the book. And so something as unconventional

34:22.840 --> 34:29.320
as this, maybe it could provide one key. So we're pursuing the same sort of strategy with

34:29.320 --> 34:33.800
Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Many other people are pursuing other very

34:33.800 --> 34:37.400
strategies. But the reason I concentrated on showing you what happens with one particular

34:37.400 --> 34:41.720
protein was that, remember that idea that maybe you could alter this HEAC response and

34:41.720 --> 34:45.000
and soup up a HEAC response in these neurodegenerative diseases and take care of the protein folding

34:45.000 --> 34:48.760
problem? Well, our work with cancer told us that might not be a good idea. It might make those

34:48.760 --> 34:52.280
the brain cells much more susceptible to cancer. So that's why we're going after individual proteins

34:52.280 --> 35:00.440
in these diseases. So the first and final thing I want to say is that this work is all thanks to

35:00.440 --> 35:04.360
the extraordinary group of people in my laboratory who've been working with their whole hearts and

35:04.360 --> 35:10.680
souls over the last. So I wonder if you can already notice that one of the shocking things for me

35:10.680 --> 35:17.240
is that we've never really got to prions. In this two part lecture, we never really got to prions

35:17.240 --> 35:23.000
and what prions are and what prion misfolding is. We never got to aggregation or this kind of

35:23.000 --> 35:27.880
thing, which is also thought to happen with some of these proteins. So it's really curious to me

35:27.880 --> 35:33.640
because over expression of alpha synuclein being some kind of toxic thing is not very surprising to

35:33.640 --> 35:40.200
me. Any over expression of a protein could potentially be toxic. I just find a lot of this

35:40.200 --> 35:47.800
stuff to be. I'm sure that there's some good science there. And I'm also sure that there's a

35:47.800 --> 35:52.520
lot of exaggeration, especially with regard to prions. So I think tomorrow we're going to take one

35:52.520 --> 35:58.040
last look at her and prions. And then we're going to move on to the main literature of the Nobel

35:58.040 --> 36:04.520
Prize by Stanley Pruser. And we're going to do our little short course on prions and protein

36:04.520 --> 36:10.120
folding and where we are then and where we are now. And see why it is, for example, that Google

36:10.120 --> 36:15.720
Fold hasn't told us how prions work yet, even though Google Fold has supposedly figured out how

36:15.720 --> 36:22.120
protein folding works or it's really, really good. It's quite shocking. And when you see it

36:22.920 --> 36:30.600
from stepping back, it's really very easy to see how overextended they are. And you know,

36:30.600 --> 36:37.160
that's the way it is. They have told us lots of stories about what artificial general intelligence

36:37.160 --> 36:43.560
is going to do. And what it really is is a story about that they tell each other in private meetings.

36:43.560 --> 36:49.160
It's a story about how they have to use this resource while it's available. And as we ramp down

36:49.640 --> 36:54.600
the reproductive rate of our global population and dissolve national borders,

36:54.600 --> 36:59.320
we want to be sure that we collect the data from all of these last generations of a crowded

36:59.320 --> 37:06.840
Earth. Ladies and gentlemen, don't let this new world order, this little lie, become something

37:06.840 --> 37:11.800
that you pass on to your children, make sure that you tell them the truth about the sacred biology

37:11.800 --> 37:16.760
of the world, the reverence that we should have for it. Do not let other men with machines control

37:16.760 --> 37:22.280
your kids and stop all transfections in humans, because they are trying to eliminate the controls

37:22.280 --> 37:28.600
with many needs necessary. I'm sorry for a little bit of disorganization today, not a lot of slides,

37:28.600 --> 37:34.200
just a couple study halls today. I cut it in the middle, hopefully so that peer tube can handle

37:34.200 --> 37:37.800
it a little better. But I think it's probably going to fail on the second one. We'll see.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.440
And then we'll have tested the system a little bit more. Thank you very much for joining me.

37:43.400 --> 37:48.360
You will see me again tomorrow. Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

37:48.360 --> 37:52.920
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb transfection and healthy humans

37:52.920 --> 37:58.360
is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

38:05.320 --> 38:11.320
And I'm wearing my Brooklyn number 11, which is actually Kyrie Irving. Kyrie Irving one,

38:11.400 --> 38:17.560
he was on the Brooklyn. When he was on the nets, did not take the transfection,

38:17.560 --> 38:24.120
he kept himself part of the control group. So although I do think that Kyrie Irving is a jersey

38:24.120 --> 38:30.760
worth having, I actually think this is the Kyrie Irving jersey worth having, because for me this

38:30.760 --> 38:38.360
is when he was standing up for the biology. And so shout out to Kyrie and I will see you guys again

38:38.360 --> 38:40.360
very, very soon.
