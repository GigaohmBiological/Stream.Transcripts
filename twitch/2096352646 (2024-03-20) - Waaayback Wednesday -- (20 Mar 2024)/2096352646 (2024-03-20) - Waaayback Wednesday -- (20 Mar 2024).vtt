00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:51.680
Watching here for some registration that everything is working there we go

00:51.680 --> 00:59.640
I see somebody in the chat great give me a second here is this okay two three

00:59.640 --> 01:03.240
does that look okay give me some kind of sound check ladies and gentlemen

01:03.240 --> 01:10.160
Professor Binder is tomorrow tomorrow at the same time tomorrow yes tomorrow

01:10.160 --> 01:15.720
tomorrow is Thomas Binder good good good here we go here we go here we go

01:15.720 --> 01:19.600
don't forget to register at broken science dot org five by five good to see

01:19.600 --> 01:22.040
Andy

01:29.640 --> 01:49.280
don't forget you can go and watch it at stream dot giga home dot bio you'll be

01:49.280 --> 01:54.360
about 30 seconds behind which means technically speaking it won't be news

01:54.360 --> 01:59.240
anymore but it would be great if somebody would at least check to see if

01:59.240 --> 02:03.080
it's working there I should also be available now on YouTube and I'd

02:03.080 --> 02:08.280
rumble if anybody wants to go do that and you know get a star from the teacher

02:08.280 --> 02:11.280
that would be a worst case

02:17.000 --> 02:25.040
yeah I missed that yesterday I was so I was so annoyed that I didn't see that I

02:25.040 --> 02:30.960
got the email of course and I just totally spaced I missed Mr. Sparkles and

02:30.960 --> 02:36.520
that was a it was probably a good chat if you got notes on what he asked feel

02:36.520 --> 02:39.680
free to send them to me in the chatter in an email because I wouldn't mind

02:39.680 --> 02:43.720
knowing I can probably find that video but it won't be upright away that's the

02:43.720 --> 02:47.720
problem I think truth is good for kids we're so busy lying we don't even

02:47.720 --> 02:51.960
recognize the truth no more than society we want everybody to feel good

02:52.040 --> 02:59.200
that's not that's not the way life is but you can tell if someone's lying you

02:59.200 --> 03:04.480
know you can sort of feel it and people and I have lied I'm sure I'll lie again

03:04.480 --> 03:08.440
I don't want to lie you know I don't think I'm a liar I try not to be a liar I

03:08.440 --> 03:14.520
don't want to be a liar I think it's like really important not to be a liar

03:21.960 --> 03:31.160
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic stop lying

03:52.960 --> 04:00.520
hmm if that is happening and more people notice that let me know and I'll get to

04:00.520 --> 04:07.440
Emily and see what's up with that this is so crazy I feel so nervous like what

04:08.440 --> 04:18.720
you know what happened there didn't have that queued up correctly somehow

04:18.720 --> 04:29.840
don't try to fool around with the colors a little bit see if the slides

04:29.840 --> 04:34.400
become a little more visible for our mobile humanoids people looking on

04:34.400 --> 04:39.560
smaller screens need a little more contrast so I have been advised that

04:39.560 --> 04:44.480
maybe we should try something different some tweaking things a little bit hopefully

04:44.480 --> 04:47.720
I won't hurt anyone's eyes if you can follow me for a while you're here at the

04:47.720 --> 04:55.240
top of the way where we are staying focused on the biology we are definitely

04:55.240 --> 04:58.600
not taking debate on TV and social media and we are certainly loving our

04:58.600 --> 05:04.000
neighbors the way this works is that there are some very generous people who

05:04.000 --> 05:08.800
have decided to subscribe to my sub stack or to my website have just

05:08.800 --> 05:14.280
donated money some people have even sent checks and this just keeps the the meal

05:14.280 --> 05:19.760
turning and a lot of people a lot of people like Suf spider and other spend

05:19.760 --> 05:26.240
time sharing my work Pamela shares my work and it really gets far and that's

05:26.240 --> 05:33.240
how this thing works we are based at GigaOMbiological.com but we have kind of

05:33.240 --> 05:38.680
spread out now a little bit we have this new thing going that's based at GigaOM.bio

05:38.680 --> 05:48.160
and stream.gigaOM.bio and those are our federated sort of our own versions of

05:48.160 --> 05:53.280
social media without all the algorithms it's just us as a little group we are

05:53.280 --> 05:59.280
now on four street or four places simultaneously and we have everything

05:59.280 --> 06:03.720
just a little bit more organized so that it's good and easy for people to

06:03.720 --> 06:08.640
help that want to help and those that have taken that step already are listed

06:08.640 --> 06:12.360
here some of these people to get listed first are there because they've made a

06:12.360 --> 06:16.640
donation or sent a check and not subscribed and I don't I don't want to

06:16.640 --> 06:20.600
leave anybody out of this the only people that I can't really list are on my

06:20.600 --> 06:25.760
sub stack the people that subscribe to that sub stack is a weird thing like

06:25.760 --> 06:30.440
that I'm gonna look into it I don't know if everybody on sub stack wants to be

06:30.440 --> 06:34.880
listed and when you subscribe on the website I can just kind of assume you

06:34.880 --> 06:38.280
don't mind your name being here and if you did you would say it in an email some

06:38.280 --> 06:42.560
people have and they're they're listed as pseudonyms or they're listed as funny

06:42.560 --> 06:47.080
names or just initials because this is the independent bright web we don't

06:47.080 --> 06:53.000
have corporate sponsors we aren't taking money from anybody but people that are

06:53.000 --> 07:01.320
parents teachers plumbers what have you and I just got to check this to see

07:01.320 --> 07:08.600
what the heck this is I think this video is gonna stop for a second and I'm gonna

07:08.600 --> 07:22.600
close this because I don't think okay that's great I am happy about that okay

07:22.600 --> 07:28.840
here we go go back to this series set I had to check that email I apologize yeah

07:28.840 --> 07:33.520
this is the independent bright web it's funded by people like you I am

07:33.520 --> 07:39.080
literally just a guy in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania rents

07:39.080 --> 07:45.760
his house from one of these these weird organizations that's you know loosely

07:45.760 --> 07:50.080
it's like an LLC and it's tied to a couple big piles of money that of course

07:50.080 --> 07:59.040
ultimately are just praying on the change and mortgage rates and the low

07:59.040 --> 08:02.680
rates that were around you know when was it even a year ago you could still get

08:02.680 --> 08:07.400
a mortgage for zero this whole illusion is sustained through your active

08:07.400 --> 08:13.400
participation if you believe that this is just a bunch of random processes that

08:13.400 --> 08:17.520
determines the fact that these prices are going up if you think that all this

08:17.520 --> 08:21.880
stuff that's happening in Ukraine is total chaos and we're just trying to

08:21.880 --> 08:27.280
respond to it that I'm afraid you are part of this you know entrapped you are

08:27.280 --> 08:31.280
entrapped in this idea that the truth is available on television that the truth

08:31.280 --> 08:36.120
is available on social media as long as you skillfully use television as long

08:36.120 --> 08:41.880
as you skillfully used social media you can get at the truth is the fundamental

08:41.880 --> 08:48.160
illusion it's the fundamental illusion that they don't want us to they don't

08:48.160 --> 08:54.640
want us to dispel and unfortunately for me in order for this illusion to really

08:54.640 --> 09:00.240
crack it didn't it didn't even really crack during 9-11 and after even though

09:00.240 --> 09:05.080
I was definitely aware of the fact that whatever was told to us in the mainstream

09:05.080 --> 09:10.280
media whatever they agreed upon on talk shows was not what happened who they

09:10.280 --> 09:15.560
said was behind it was not who was behind it but it still didn't dawn on me

09:15.560 --> 09:22.440
that this was actually a a collective limited spectrum of reality basically

09:22.440 --> 09:28.160
that that is wholly constructed by a group of people that agree on the story

09:28.160 --> 09:33.600
and if you have a group of people that agree on the story and study it and

09:33.600 --> 09:38.800
understand it but then also as Karl Rove said intimately understand their

09:38.800 --> 09:45.280
role in crafting it in the first place I think Karl Rove I don't have the quote

09:45.280 --> 09:50.000
but Karl Rove sorry this is Giga oh and biological a high-resistance low noise

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
information stream brought to you by a biologist my name is Jonathan Cooey

09:53.000 --> 09:56.200
you're coming to you live from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania at 124 in the

09:56.200 --> 10:00.160
afternoon I'm gonna try and come to you more often in the afternoon because it

10:00.160 --> 10:06.280
gives me more time where I am least committed to my family and most able to

10:06.280 --> 10:12.080
spend as much time and energy on this and at the same time take at least away

10:12.080 --> 10:17.920
from my family which right now as you can probably imagine is in need of of

10:17.920 --> 10:26.960
both parents as we we I don't know canoe through this these rapids it is I always

10:26.960 --> 10:31.400
a place to start when I say I'm human just like you I wore my old hat today

10:31.400 --> 10:36.440
that I used to wear all the time in Norway and I was actually a picture that

10:36.440 --> 10:41.320
I use a lot that's going around where I'm wearing a it's a alpine low or

10:41.320 --> 10:48.120
something like that fleece but it's black and it's this hat I'm making like

10:48.120 --> 10:53.320
Mr. Burns hands and I've used that a lot because it's one of these things it was

10:53.320 --> 10:56.840
on a website in Norway and it's it's a picture that was taken on a white

10:56.840 --> 11:01.600
background by some photographer right before the Moses won the Nobel Prize

11:01.600 --> 11:04.880
they were thinking already that they might win it and so they were already

11:04.880 --> 11:09.600
the Institute was already you know getting their act together on the website

11:09.600 --> 11:13.280
and and you know doing the things you do when you're becoming a very successful

11:13.280 --> 11:17.960
Institute like they were anyway long story short I wore this hat because I

11:17.960 --> 11:21.320
found it while I was cleaning stuff up and I thought it was funny and I didn't

11:21.360 --> 11:28.360
take it off I apologize so this way out biology yes and we are I guess this is

11:28.360 --> 11:32.640
just going to be a thing where we're going to try and we're going to try and

11:32.640 --> 11:37.520
broadcast as often as we can as long as we have something useful to say I think

11:37.520 --> 11:42.080
on Wednesdays or on Thursdays depending on how we we manage the schedule tomorrow

11:42.080 --> 11:50.520
I have the honor of interviewing Dr. Thomas Binder from Switzerland many of

11:50.520 --> 11:55.440
you will know him from social media as a early outspoken critic of the whole

11:55.440 --> 12:00.320
concept of a pandemic he's a cardiologist and maybe even a respiratory

12:00.320 --> 12:06.040
physiologist over there and I think that's going to be really fun and so

12:06.040 --> 12:09.640
depending on when we have interviews when I can schedule them Wednesday or

12:09.640 --> 12:14.560
Thursday I'm going to try and go use one day to go back in time look at an old

12:14.600 --> 12:20.720
video and see if we can see how clearly it is that they have been laying down

12:20.720 --> 12:26.680
this narrative of possibility laying down this concept of pandemic potential

12:26.680 --> 12:32.280
that's never really manifest and in fact in all the examples that they use that

12:32.280 --> 12:37.560
purport to show us this potential these are absolute opposite they're the

12:37.560 --> 12:43.400
example of the exact opposite where despite the expectations you know it

12:43.400 --> 12:46.840
doesn't really go that far and it does hurt people but whatever these

12:46.840 --> 12:55.200
phenomenon are it is not something that yeah that requires much how can I say

12:55.200 --> 13:01.120
it it doesn't require much substantiation so long as these five people on the

13:01.120 --> 13:06.240
panel all agree that that is a danger and that we don't have to debate it and

13:06.240 --> 13:11.600
instead we should ask these questions about that assumption and that is the

13:11.600 --> 13:18.520
trick that I've been trying to convey with this idea that we have been tricked

13:18.520 --> 13:23.760
into solving a mystery we've been made to feel as though we are sleuths solving

13:23.760 --> 13:29.520
a mystery on coming to understand it ourselves despite what the ruling

13:29.520 --> 13:34.040
class would like us to know despite what the ruling class would like us to think

13:34.040 --> 13:38.720
we've figured it out that they covered it up and I've been trying to explain

13:38.760 --> 13:46.520
that as a as a very I think useful technique for understanding or a useful

13:46.520 --> 13:52.720
analogy for understanding how it is that they got all of us on the red side and

13:52.720 --> 13:56.880
on the blue side on the labor and on the Tories or whatever it is whatever country

13:56.880 --> 14:03.520
you're in these what should be arguing factions have sort of come together to

14:03.520 --> 14:08.920
accept the fact that there was a novel virus that appeared in 2020 that was

14:08.920 --> 14:14.640
really a mystery as to where it came from and I think that the sort of 50 50 or

14:14.640 --> 14:21.760
51 49 consensus is that it probably came from a lab and it's not controversial on

14:21.760 --> 14:27.480
either side of the debate to have that opinion and that's where you need to

14:27.480 --> 14:32.320
really rub your chin and be like okay so how did we get here again and and and

14:32.320 --> 14:38.880
assume that it's by design because that is how we are being governed and once

14:38.880 --> 14:42.840
you see it that way and you understand that all of these people are in on it

14:42.840 --> 14:49.400
then by the pretense itself once you are you know this is my control group badge

14:49.400 --> 14:54.080
but if let's say you know okay here you go Jonathan here's your badge and now

14:54.080 --> 14:57.560
that you have this and you're in on the little secret you know like on the

14:57.560 --> 15:02.080
Simpsons where you get the the car you park underneath the parking garage and

15:02.080 --> 15:05.440
it's super nice and you take an elevator somewhere else and all this other stuff

15:05.440 --> 15:11.920
what were they called the the it was not the Freemasons but it was what were they

15:11.920 --> 15:15.920
called does somebody know when you know and you type it into the chat I'm gonna

15:15.920 --> 15:21.240
be very angry and happy at you at the same time the stonemasons that's what

15:21.240 --> 15:26.960
they were called anyway and you didn't get it in the chat in time or he once you

15:26.960 --> 15:32.520
get in is sort of involved in this stone cutters oh we got it oh dang it

15:32.520 --> 15:37.000
that's right so once you got involved or once you get involved and if it's in

15:37.000 --> 15:41.080
the national security way or I don't know it's a secret society I don't give a

15:41.080 --> 15:45.680
darn what it is there could be lots of different schemes by which they make

15:45.680 --> 15:51.960
people really believe they are members of a club and once you believe like I

15:51.960 --> 15:58.280
think Mandy of the CDC believes that she is a member of a club you will you

15:58.280 --> 16:03.680
will spout lies confidently knowing that all those people back there are gonna

16:03.680 --> 16:10.720
back you and it's all because you've been made to believe that the badge that

16:10.720 --> 16:14.720
you've been given or the you know the position that you've been given the

16:14.720 --> 16:20.320
business cards you've been given the meetings you've been in the hands you've

16:20.320 --> 16:28.960
shaken you believe that and by all means I am arguing that our bureaucracy is

16:28.960 --> 16:36.160
controlled by people who are either simple enough or are complacent enough

16:36.160 --> 16:45.440
or are willing to toe this you know look away doctrine where you don't know what's

16:45.440 --> 16:47.880
happening over there and it doesn't matter because you know it's for the

16:47.880 --> 16:55.200
greater good you know they the ends justify the means and that's how they

16:55.200 --> 17:00.280
do it some people need a badge some people need rank some people need I don't

17:00.280 --> 17:13.280
know I guess psychedelics in a podcast some people need I don't know but we are

17:13.280 --> 17:18.880
being manipulated by this mechanism and this mechanism is not simple it is made

17:18.880 --> 17:27.520
up of people people that are willing to coordinatedly create the illusion of

17:27.520 --> 17:36.120
reality that is useful to their people above them and even if they are you

17:36.120 --> 17:41.720
know all they did was agree to talk about bears and nothing else let's just say

17:41.720 --> 17:46.800
that for example let's just pull that out of nowhere and say that somebody from

17:46.800 --> 17:57.320
2021 until basically now whenever they make an appearance they don't talk about

17:57.320 --> 18:04.120
much else other than bears there's sort of an invited expert on bears and then

18:04.120 --> 18:09.920
you have another person who since about 2021 has only been talking about Ivermectin

18:09.920 --> 18:16.160
and nothing else then you have another one since 2021 is really only been talking

18:16.160 --> 18:21.800
about the mRNA technology and the shot and then you have somebody else since

18:21.800 --> 18:27.000
2021 that's only been talking about hydroxychloroquine and then you have

18:27.000 --> 18:33.520
another person and so none of those people are able to integrate across the

18:33.520 --> 18:38.360
whole story none of those people are talking about protocols being particularly

18:38.360 --> 18:42.600
deadly or raising all cause mortality in a way that might confuse some people

18:42.600 --> 18:46.800
nobody's talking about what the financial incentives to call anything

18:46.800 --> 18:51.120
covid did including you know the protocols stick to it and there's no

18:51.120 --> 18:58.000
malpractice what what in the world can you conclude from that pattern other

18:58.000 --> 19:03.240
than to say that we are being controlled and manipulated by these people who are

19:03.240 --> 19:09.000
very carefully not questioning the cardinal narrative of a novel virus that

19:09.000 --> 19:12.760
killed millions that millions more were saved from the likely kind of game from

19:12.760 --> 19:19.200
function came from gain of function and will come again it has to be it's the

19:19.200 --> 19:23.320
only real logical conclusion to come to otherwise all of these people would

19:23.320 --> 19:30.840
eventually sing in harmony instead of forming these kind of spontaneous

19:30.840 --> 19:34.400
rivalries that don't really matter because their rivalries that don't

19:34.400 --> 19:40.800
question the cardinal you know the the main idea that they are trying to entrap

19:40.800 --> 19:46.040
our children with this mythology of a novel virus that was on somebody's shoe

19:46.040 --> 19:50.240
as they walked out of the laboratory and then they went to a wet market it got

19:50.240 --> 19:54.840
in a puddle underneath the raccoon dogs cage which was then butchered and sold

19:54.840 --> 19:59.280
distributed as meat on the street and then all these people got sick and then

19:59.280 --> 20:03.440
it went boom all around the world on an airplane traveling thing for New

20:03.440 --> 20:05.720
Year's

20:09.960 --> 20:14.920
I think these people were put in place before the pandemic and it frustrates me

20:14.920 --> 20:20.280
a lot that I can't adequately convey how important that is to understand because

20:20.280 --> 20:28.960
it it it so nicely expands the scope already of the operation to understand

20:28.960 --> 20:35.360
how long these people have known that something was going to happen how long

20:35.360 --> 20:38.520
they have known maybe not something was going to happen but they were already

20:38.520 --> 20:41.480
involved in the things that were happening they were already thinking

20:41.480 --> 20:46.720
like Karl Rove thinks which is you have to understand that we create history and

20:46.720 --> 20:52.640
then you you know study it you study what we did you try to figure out what we

20:52.640 --> 20:56.360
did and why we did and that's that's historians discovering history but we

20:56.360 --> 21:00.600
are history that's what something like that Karl Rove said and I think that

21:00.600 --> 21:07.320
that's what these people believe and it sounds crazy but that's the reason why

21:07.320 --> 21:14.780
the press secretary of the United States president right now can go on the

21:14.780 --> 21:21.160
camera and say that she herself is a historic figure and I think that's

21:21.200 --> 21:27.720
really where you see how we've all because so much of how we think of our

21:27.720 --> 21:33.920
place in the world rather than with humility and reverence we we we think

21:33.920 --> 21:38.280
of ourselves as primal or or whatever the right word is you know central

21:38.280 --> 21:44.280
everything orbits around around us and that creates a very different kind of

21:44.280 --> 21:51.320
society that is very much more chaotic and unmoored than anything that any any

21:51.320 --> 21:56.760
religion crazy or not would create in my imagination we're really we're really

21:56.760 --> 22:00.760
at the precipice here where for some reason we don't understand that this

22:00.760 --> 22:05.840
car is careening out of control some people just seem to think that everything is

22:05.840 --> 22:12.520
fine and it's definitely not and COVID really brought that into focus no one

22:12.560 --> 22:16.560
can exercise informed consent anymore because very few people can adequately

22:16.560 --> 22:22.480
describe reality and why they object to you know this going forward because

22:22.480 --> 22:26.920
their description the description of reality that they would that they would

22:26.920 --> 22:33.920
recite would be pretty far off from what reality actually is think about the

22:33.920 --> 22:38.520
average persons right now the skilled TV watcher the skilled social media

22:38.520 --> 22:44.680
user never followed or even heard of this movement of people that just

22:44.680 --> 22:48.160
thinks anti-vaxxers are crazy and that's really all they've ever thought about

22:48.160 --> 22:55.720
think about what their model of disease in the world is think about what their

22:55.720 --> 23:04.200
model of why they have to wash their hands is think about their model of it's

23:04.240 --> 23:09.520
spectacular think about that little girl on the on the on the couch right

23:09.520 --> 23:13.480
here those how many of those people do you see when you go to Costco how many

23:13.480 --> 23:16.360
of those people do you see when you go to Giant Eagle how many of those people do

23:16.360 --> 23:25.680
you see when you go to H.E.B. that are just absolutely scientific questions I

23:25.680 --> 23:31.280
think are very hard to get a handle on and the reason for this is that in late

23:31.320 --> 23:36.560
modernity which we're living in there's simply too much knowledge for any

23:36.560 --> 23:42.960
individual human to understand and so you know and so the the and so in this

23:42.960 --> 23:47.400
world of extreme hyperspecialization where it's narrower and narrower

23:47.400 --> 23:51.400
subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are

23:51.400 --> 23:54.760
the string theorists talking about how great string theory is the cancer

23:54.760 --> 23:57.880
researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer the quantum

23:57.880 --> 24:01.360
computer researchers are just about to build you know quantum computer there

24:01.360 --> 24:04.680
will be a massive breakthrough and then if you were to say that all these fields

24:04.680 --> 24:08.520
not much is happening people just don't have the authority for this and this is

24:08.520 --> 24:13.680
somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge than you would have

24:13.680 --> 24:19.120
had in 1800 or even in 1900 you know 1800 Goethe could still understand just

24:19.120 --> 24:23.480
about everything where 1900 Hilbert could still understand just about all of

24:23.520 --> 24:29.040
mathematics and and so the sort of the sort of specialization I think has

24:29.040 --> 24:35.400
made it a much harder question to get a handle on now one of the things I would

24:35.400 --> 24:39.880
like to drop in here sorry is that yesterday when I was talking to Matt

24:39.880 --> 24:43.600
Briggs I wasn't I didn't get to this slide but I had it queued up and I kind

24:43.600 --> 24:47.720
of just got into the conversation a little too much to I didn't have a real

24:47.720 --> 24:50.800
plan on a no-card which maybe I should have had but I kind of thought I was

24:50.800 --> 24:53.560
going to go back to the slide set and I didn't I think it was because I

24:53.560 --> 24:58.320
chickened out on the timing I wanted it to be you know recorded long enough so

24:58.320 --> 25:03.360
I made a little mistake there because this this little piece with Peter Thiel

25:03.360 --> 25:10.720
is so cool it's so important to see it because what he's saying here is both

25:10.720 --> 25:15.400
truthful and disingenuous at the same time it's disingenuous because of the

25:15.400 --> 25:23.240
words he chooses but if you understand what I think is the truth then you can

25:23.240 --> 25:28.360
hear the truth in what he says and so you know given that they could have a

25:28.360 --> 25:32.600
reflective conversation after this where it could be clarified or that they had

25:32.600 --> 25:36.960
a reflective conversation before this before they had this meeting then when

25:36.960 --> 25:41.800
they speak of things like knowledge it will be really easy to hear this for

25:41.800 --> 25:50.040
what it is he's he's bamboozling the the skilled social media user who thinks

25:50.040 --> 25:54.120
that knowledge is knowledge and when he says hyperspecialization creates all

25:54.120 --> 25:57.440
this knowledge and then we can't understand because there's too many

25:57.440 --> 26:03.160
specialties it just it makes perfect sense to the gas station attendant it

26:03.160 --> 26:08.080
makes perfect sense to the to the high schooler that's that's working at at

26:08.120 --> 26:13.760
Wendy's before they go off to college next year and they think wow I really

26:13.760 --> 26:17.880
understand this guy and this makes perfect sense but to the to the stone

26:17.880 --> 26:23.360
cutters in the audience they could actually hear this to a stone cutter they

26:23.360 --> 26:29.680
hear wow so he's just admitting that that what we do in academia is is we

26:29.680 --> 26:35.680
foist all of these untested unproven models that have never been verified

26:35.840 --> 26:41.040
onto people so that they're absolutely juggling models of reality in every

26:41.040 --> 26:48.080
little corner of their world and by taking knowledge and dividing it into

26:48.080 --> 26:56.680
ever smaller academic fields we have been able to take reality of people and

26:56.680 --> 27:03.280
essentially replace all of what might be common sensical interpretation of

27:03.280 --> 27:09.240
reality with untested unverified models which purport to recapitulate

27:09.240 --> 27:14.640
reality but actually don't and leave you vulnerable for misinterpreting what's

27:14.640 --> 27:18.320
going on and more importantly not understanding at all what's really

27:18.320 --> 27:24.280
happening and I think that's where we are I think that's why there are many

27:24.280 --> 27:28.480
people in academia who are still savable because they probably have felt

27:28.480 --> 27:33.760
this their whole career this extreme incongruence between the way that

27:33.760 --> 27:38.520
funding is doled out the way that grant applications are evaluated the way

27:38.520 --> 27:44.440
that that no hypotheses are used to create the illusion of progress and

27:44.440 --> 27:52.400
understanding the way that significance is used as a substitution for for

27:52.400 --> 27:59.120
verification and now I'm just starting to work with this toolkit so I'm gonna

27:59.120 --> 28:02.720
make some mistakes but I do think that conceptually speaking I've got a pretty

28:02.720 --> 28:08.360
good handle on where we're gonna try and go with this and it I think it's a

28:08.360 --> 28:14.280
really really good goal to trying to get young high school kids to understand

28:14.280 --> 28:22.600
this fundamental reasoning problem that has plagued academic science for many

28:22.600 --> 28:32.120
decades now and when abused when used disingenuously or used irresponsibly or

28:32.120 --> 28:37.440
ignorantly so that means you might not know that you you've been a part of this

28:37.440 --> 28:43.240
machine you might be like me and at least in retrospect I don't think we did

28:43.240 --> 28:52.280
terrible science the trouble is is that we were still very much trying to

28:52.280 --> 28:56.280
understand a very complex thing and trying to keep up with people who were

28:56.280 --> 29:03.320
doing this stuff and so I have a model in my paper but the model does explain the

29:03.320 --> 29:06.400
pattern and make predictions that have so far come true so that's also

29:06.480 --> 29:13.120
interesting right it does it does suggest that that there is science out

29:13.120 --> 29:22.360
there to be found which legitimately purports to test a model use a model to

29:22.360 --> 29:28.040
make predictions that are then tested by making measurements and and that I

29:28.040 --> 29:34.320
think is is what we might see as the goal with this stream is to identify you

29:34.320 --> 29:37.720
know science that does that and maybe more importantly use the science that

29:37.720 --> 29:42.600
doesn't as examples and throw these examples out there weekly so that we can

29:42.600 --> 29:46.360
see these papers for what they are we can identify what is the model that

29:46.360 --> 29:50.280
they're playing with what is the model that the question purports so that's

29:50.280 --> 29:58.120
something that I was writing down earlier and that is by accepting their

29:58.120 --> 30:02.800
questions as relevant we unconsciously assume the models made implicit by the

30:02.800 --> 30:08.400
question does that make sense by accepting their questions as relevant we

30:08.400 --> 30:14.160
unconsciously assume the models made implicit by the question so if you do

30:14.160 --> 30:19.880
it right the enchantment works really well basically you ask a question and by

30:19.880 --> 30:30.120
the person listening taking that question as being valuable then the model of

30:30.160 --> 30:34.480
reality implied by the question is accepted by the person who thinks about

30:34.480 --> 30:40.320
the question that's how I'm envisioning I'm imagining that this enchantment goes

30:40.320 --> 30:45.160
and so I'm I haven't gotten to the point where I got a lot of great examples but

30:45.160 --> 30:51.560
where did this virus come from is a question that when you start answering

30:51.560 --> 30:59.680
it in your head your brain already has to build the cognitive infrastructure if

30:59.680 --> 31:06.920
you will that will support the reality where there is a virus and it came from

31:06.920 --> 31:13.800
somewhere and then if you're also supplied with reasonable possibilities

31:13.800 --> 31:19.320
then those also fall neatly into the little cognitive model that your brain

31:19.320 --> 31:26.880
automatically makes in order to understand the question and that's what I

31:26.920 --> 31:31.640
think is really cool about this little idea here where did the virus come from

31:31.640 --> 31:35.480
what is the model is implied well the model that's implied is pandemic

31:35.480 --> 31:39.000
potential it's gain a function potential it's viral spread its viruses are

31:39.000 --> 31:48.360
dangerous I still have a call but it's mostly because I'm not drinking I'm

31:48.360 --> 31:56.400
just talking talking so think of it this way what question could we formulate in

31:56.440 --> 32:04.160
order to imply the model that autism is genetic like a question like what

32:04.160 --> 32:08.960
genes can be correlated with autism might already imply that autism is

32:08.960 --> 32:14.720
caused by genes and so if you put out a grant call that says what genes can be

32:14.720 --> 32:20.880
correlated with autism or we are looking for trying to identify genes

32:20.880 --> 32:25.760
something like that here already by getting those academic scientists to

32:25.800 --> 32:30.120
process that question and to produce you know a whole grant proposal based on

32:30.120 --> 32:36.040
that question you have already gotten them they have to cognitively they must

32:36.040 --> 32:42.560
assume this this basic model and that is they have to consider okay so if it's

32:42.560 --> 32:46.560
if it's genetic then how am I gonna go about figuring that out see that's the

32:46.560 --> 32:52.560
whole point and so the magic is not what they tell you it's the magic of what

32:52.560 --> 32:59.280
they get you to ask and Mark has said this really well from the opposite side

32:59.280 --> 33:04.560
which is also why this clicked so well in my head just now is that Mark has

33:04.560 --> 33:10.680
often said they get us to ask the wrong questions and that's what's the beauty

33:10.680 --> 33:14.560
of it when you ask the wrong questions and what do you do you actually

33:14.560 --> 33:19.560
subconsciously you accept the model of reality that is implicit in the

33:19.560 --> 33:29.080
question what gender is my child there it is it's implicit in the question oh

33:29.080 --> 33:34.720
my gosh do you see it and so if you play along with that then you've

33:34.720 --> 33:39.240
automatically accepted that model of reality and that model is what gets gets

33:39.240 --> 33:44.240
foisted on you when somebody gets you to ask the right question I know it's

33:44.240 --> 33:48.000
nothing more than narrative shaping but it's narrative shaping not by telling

33:48.000 --> 33:53.440
you stories like like this guy's talking it's by getting tricking us into

33:53.440 --> 34:00.520
asking the wrong questions and that's magic I think it's really cool I'm sorry

34:00.520 --> 34:04.720
but you can tell and they do it with lying you know you can sort of feel it

34:04.720 --> 34:10.520
in people and I have lied I'm sure I'll lie again I don't want to lie you know

34:10.520 --> 34:14.320
I don't think I'm a liar I try not to be a liar I don't want to be a liar and so

34:14.320 --> 34:24.000
now listen to the second part of Peter Thiel's statement right the political

34:24.000 --> 34:28.920
cut I have on the specialization is always that that if you analyze the

34:28.920 --> 34:32.920
politics of science the specialization should make you suspicious it should

34:32.920 --> 34:36.960
because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on and it's presumably got

34:36.960 --> 34:40.720
an easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be you

34:40.720 --> 34:44.080
know a little bit suspicious and that's that's that's sort of my starting my

34:44.080 --> 34:48.640
starting bias and so there he just says it right out flat he just says that you

34:48.640 --> 34:52.920
can lie because the specialization allows it and there's no incentive to call

34:52.920 --> 34:57.720
people out on it the incentive is to be nice the incentive is to let everybody

34:57.720 --> 35:02.240
have their own little model of reality that they get to test out into you know

35:02.240 --> 35:07.760
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are important for attention and so then the

35:07.760 --> 35:11.880
whole model of attention is wherever acetylcholine receptors are then that

35:11.880 --> 35:15.320
must be where we have to study them because they're involved in attention

35:15.320 --> 35:18.560
because people pay attention better when they smoke cigarettes and nicotine

35:18.560 --> 35:24.720
stimulates acetylcholine receptors think about that that's not a terrible model

35:24.720 --> 35:29.400
of how how attention could be regulated in part by acetylcholine but once you

35:29.400 --> 35:34.800
start spinning that wheel and always grabbing it on those those three

35:34.800 --> 35:41.200
handholds that have it becomes unbreakable that that no hypothesis is

35:41.200 --> 35:46.600
always the same straw man as as Matt Briggs described it yesterday which no

35:46.600 --> 35:52.040
one ever described it to me as before but it is and if somebody had told me that

35:52.040 --> 35:56.520
a long time ago I think formulating grant proposals would have been a lot

35:56.520 --> 36:03.480
easier for me unfortunately but I still had this idea that the no hypothesis had

36:03.480 --> 36:07.480
to be some useful already understood thing that you were trying to change

36:07.480 --> 36:14.920
into the new thing yeah it's tough it's it's a real interesting place that

36:14.920 --> 36:22.280
we're in and I do think that one of the the key ways to to formulate this in a

36:22.280 --> 36:28.320
nutshell oops I wanted to do this and this was supposed to be off did you see

36:28.320 --> 36:32.720
that I can put that chat up there now Jessica was in there last night and it

36:32.720 --> 36:37.640
was up there is anybody on there now can anybody chat now yay got my star for

36:37.640 --> 36:46.000
the day is that you okay good that's great so I do think these are a good way

36:46.000 --> 36:50.840
to start I do think these things still really are some succinct ways of getting

36:50.840 --> 36:54.200
people to think about them in the right way ask the biggest questions that they

36:54.200 --> 36:58.880
can ask because the spread I have bad ideas has always been scarier than the

36:58.880 --> 37:07.440
spread of any RNA molecule tonight today

37:07.760 --> 37:15.400
I have this little thing here we are gonna do a way back movie this afternoon I

37:15.400 --> 37:18.200
think it's two o'clock I think I've got time I don't have to go to basketball

37:18.200 --> 37:26.160
till four and I'm calling it way back Wednesday because it's Wednesday and it

37:26.200 --> 37:29.560
would be normally throwback Thursday or something like that so we're calling

37:29.560 --> 37:34.720
it way back Wednesday and I'm gonna escape out of here and I'm gonna put this up

37:34.720 --> 37:43.560
wait where did it go oh I didn't turn hold on one second

37:46.920 --> 37:54.080
that's it great and I gotta set it up hold on I thought I had this already

37:54.080 --> 38:01.680
queued up my bad but I think I know what's it at 1.39 perfect here we go

38:01.680 --> 38:09.160
pause it sorry Goofy's my fault here comes see me oh no you don't see me there

38:09.160 --> 38:16.800
you see me here we go this is a movie that was on CNN in 2017 believe it or

38:16.800 --> 38:22.760
not 2017 I'm running it at 1.4 speed in case anybody has any trouble with it I

38:22.800 --> 38:26.840
apologize we can't possibly watch it at regular speed it's an hour and 37 minutes

38:26.840 --> 38:31.880
if I'm gonna stop it at all we'll be there too long thank you very much for

38:31.880 --> 38:41.720
joining me 62 humans plus more I guess on other platforms fingers crossed I just

38:41.720 --> 38:46.720
don't want to open all of those other things I don't have my my sidekicks here

38:46.720 --> 38:50.160
anybody to help me let me go full-screen with this

39:04.800 --> 39:08.720
they signed Jacob does a health warning following a worldwide outbreak of a

39:08.720 --> 39:12.120
mysterious form of pneumonia you can take just virus cells kill me I'm gonna

39:12.120 --> 39:15.920
figure out how to get those chats to come over here I just haven't gotten to it

39:15.920 --> 39:18.880
there's a couple different ways to do it but I haven't figured it out

39:18.880 --> 39:24.280
promise I'm working out of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak spread widely and cannot

39:24.280 --> 39:32.120
be contained in the pandemic must be taken seriously a big outbreak of a deadly

39:32.120 --> 39:34.940
Ebola virus has killed all the Ebola outbreak that started the West African

39:34.940 --> 39:38.360
country of Guinea has now spread people know nothing there's no kill they don't

39:38.360 --> 39:41.080
have the resources to actually do that for life governments around the world

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
they're considering new measures happening from the New York City health

39:43.080 --> 39:47.800
department temperature reading from last night the U.S. Department of Agriculture

39:47.800 --> 39:50.880
confirmed another case of bird flu one and a half million state turkeys have

39:50.880 --> 39:53.920
been killed to prevent the spread of it is really critical that being controlled

39:53.920 --> 39:59.400
you have to respond to the challenge three latest victims of the new respiratory

39:59.400 --> 40:02.400
virus called MERS have come from Middle Eastern countries they believe it

40:02.400 --> 40:08.080
originated in bats or camel causes pneumonia and rapid kidney failure as a

40:08.080 --> 40:11.080
Zika virus continues to affect people across the globe

40:28.440 --> 40:34.300
the unseen enemy wow nice I forgot that that was the name of it it just

40:34.300 --> 40:39.980
is stored in 2017 CNN hard drive you can almost hear the biological chatter

40:39.980 --> 40:46.900
ha it's like a low-run job in science we're supposed to make a safer we suddenly

40:46.900 --> 40:50.620
seem more vulnerable to outbreaks

40:52.780 --> 40:57.580
but we like it or not I will this globalizing okay maybe I'll slowly true for

40:57.580 --> 41:01.980
markets and for production but it's also true for behaviors for diseases so

41:02.820 --> 41:06.940
because of our mobility secondly we are far more people and we're also living

41:06.940 --> 41:11.420
more and more in very crowded cities that's fantastic from the perspective of

41:11.420 --> 41:18.540
a virus because in no time it can infect hundreds of thousands of people over

41:18.540 --> 41:22.260
the last three decades they've been about 30 newly emerging diseases that have the

41:22.260 --> 41:28.140
potential to 30 times you've heard nothing it's not a matter if there will be

41:28.140 --> 41:33.660
what look at that did you see who that is it can infect hundreds of thousands of

41:33.660 --> 41:35.900
people

41:35.900 --> 41:40.340
over the last three decades have been about 30 newly emerging diseases that have

41:40.340 --> 41:49.460
the potential to be pandemics who's that guy Larry brilliant epidemiologist the

41:49.460 --> 41:55.580
hell is that all about wait till you see this I'm just gonna do Larry brilliant

41:55.580 --> 42:06.060
on you on Wikipedia watch this you know who he is anyone you're not gonna

42:06.060 --> 42:12.980
believe it if you don't know it's pretty impressive here it comes

42:13.780 --> 42:20.380
no don't do that goofy stuff he is an American epidemiologist technologist

42:20.380 --> 42:24.220
philanthropist and author who worked with their huge World Health Organization

42:24.220 --> 42:30.900
from 73 to 76 to help sell successfully eradicate smallpox he's a patent

42:30.900 --> 42:37.060
holder and was the inaugural director of google.org the charitable arm of

42:37.060 --> 42:43.020
Google he's related to the school foundation which is one of the primary

42:43.020 --> 42:48.740
funders of the UPS news hour I mean it's just extraordinary down here you will

42:48.740 --> 42:56.380
see that he said after the swine flew outbreak in 2011 that's the one that

42:56.380 --> 43:02.780
that Mark von Rancz from the from Belgium oversaw and then gave a

43:02.780 --> 43:06.660
presentation about the Chatham House that I've shown a couple times expressed

43:06.660 --> 43:10.220
concern that the public was not suitably concerned by the threat posed by

43:10.220 --> 43:15.460
infectious diseases this led brilliant and several colleagues contributing to

43:15.460 --> 43:22.020
the creation of the film contagion and then he gave a commencement speech at

43:22.020 --> 43:29.260
the Harvard School of Public Health I mean are you kidding me that's the guy

43:29.260 --> 43:34.900
who made a movie in 2017 as an epidemiologist

43:34.900 --> 43:43.780
yeah on CNN okay it's not a matter if there will be a global pandemic

43:44.500 --> 43:50.100
matter when and which virus and how bad the world changes around us at

43:50.100 --> 43:56.180
increasing speed we cause a lot of that change migrating to cities stripping

43:56.180 --> 44:00.700
the earth of its resources and altering primeval jungle we are seeing whole

44:00.700 --> 44:04.740
entire ecologies is this you can see with your eye and that which you can only see

44:04.740 --> 44:09.740
with a microscope one system after another oh Gary look at that oh my gosh

44:09.740 --> 44:14.460
she's been there for so long for its opportunities for viruses and bacteria

44:14.460 --> 44:19.220
to seek out new home do you remember how important she was on Twitter in 2020

44:19.220 --> 44:25.260
like this lady was out there early on spokesperson extraordinaire almost as

44:25.260 --> 44:32.980
mouthy as the person who moved from Georgetown to Saskatchewan named this

44:32.980 --> 44:38.300
was oh my gosh a rasmus or whatever wow almost caused new havoc including

44:38.300 --> 44:43.780
disease for human beings when contagion happens life alters in an

44:43.780 --> 44:48.660
instant Daniel Hayes I actually believe that the Revolutionary War was not one

44:48.660 --> 44:52.180
by us and that we didn't actually escape I don't I don't I think that's

44:52.180 --> 45:01.380
actually probably true and yeah I I don't know I I think at this stage we

45:01.380 --> 45:05.620
just have to assume that we don't know anything about about real history I

45:05.620 --> 45:11.300
mean you know I just think you have to assume that we don't feel safe we lose

45:11.300 --> 45:13.620
trust

45:13.620 --> 45:16.740
fear spreads very quickly when you have an infectious disease outbreak

45:16.740 --> 45:20.060
communication is so much more pervasive people know what's happening in another

45:20.060 --> 45:24.500
part of the world so much more quickly so much more vividly than ever before so

45:24.500 --> 45:28.620
the contagion of fear moves faster than the contagion of the pathogen the

45:28.620 --> 45:33.900
disease itself and the fabric of society starts to deteriorate so what are they

45:33.900 --> 45:37.020
doing there are they saying that that's what they want to happen or that's

45:37.020 --> 45:41.520
what happens because when SARS was released and went around the world and

45:41.520 --> 45:46.100
infected 10,000 people and I guess killed 700 it didn't tear the fabric of

45:46.100 --> 45:54.300
society mirrors didn't tear the fabric of society did polio tear the fabric of

45:54.300 --> 46:00.420
society back in the 50s I don't think it did especially since we definitely

46:00.420 --> 46:07.740
know that DDT was being used back then but nobody blamed that for anything I

46:07.740 --> 46:12.940
mean it's just bizarre right it's bizarre how when you look back on it how

46:12.940 --> 46:18.100
can you not see this as propaganda this is not this is not us a film trying to

46:18.100 --> 46:24.340
inform you about objective truths about nature even the music choice belies its

46:24.340 --> 46:29.540
motives there's something that destroys the soul of a community

46:30.540 --> 46:37.420
that happens when an epidemic is out of control it's not just the large number

46:37.420 --> 46:42.780
of casualties in the death which are itself unthinkable but it's what it does

46:42.780 --> 46:47.660
to us the social fabric of this is still Larry Brilliant driving around his car

46:47.660 --> 46:51.980
telling stories we're in the car with Larry Brilliant and he's telling us

46:51.980 --> 46:56.620
stories about what pandemics do to people is that weird or not how did I

46:56.620 --> 47:07.420
choose that so well holy weird-owness the war lasted for 14 years I think this

47:07.420 --> 47:12.020
is an Ebola doctor remember vividly everything I saw

47:15.860 --> 47:19.260
sometimes you're playing at night when the place is dark you can see this

47:19.260 --> 47:25.180
blood flying like boats of lightning across this car you physically see them

47:27.580 --> 47:33.820
my father will bundle all of us up and we hear the opposite direction so he's

47:33.820 --> 47:37.020
confusing war with no disease I come from this way because you hear the sound

47:37.020 --> 47:42.020
coming and you see the soldiers going that way to go and fight it so you know

47:42.020 --> 47:48.540
you have to go the other way so they're gonna confuse war and now look at Ebola

47:48.540 --> 47:55.420
so how you want to protect yourself you have an enemy you cannot hide from you

47:55.420 --> 47:59.900
cannot run from Ebola how come you never get it there where you want to go who

47:59.900 --> 48:05.740
are you gonna run talk is it really so easy to approach Ebola you know like

48:05.740 --> 48:10.020
just drive up and put some plastic on for a while and then take it off and you

48:10.020 --> 48:15.660
don't get Ebola I mean I know it's supposed to be something different

48:15.660 --> 48:22.340
Ebola is transmitted to what it affluence bodily fluids okay I got you

48:22.340 --> 48:29.580
this is an invisible Ebola first surfaced in West Africa in a remote rural

48:29.580 --> 48:33.700
community but in our increasingly connected world this is Morgan Freeman

48:33.700 --> 48:37.800
stay in the countryside the virus quickly found its way this voice is like a low

48:37.800 --> 48:43.740
rent Morgan Freeman it's so weird into the region's largest cities and health

48:43.740 --> 48:48.060
systems that were completely unprepared I mean if I slowed it down to normal

48:48.060 --> 48:51.240
speed it would be Morgan Freeman like a cheap version I got you there from

48:51.240 --> 48:55.380
air school two years ago the reason why I'm here is by default because I was the

48:55.380 --> 49:03.300
only one available nice boy these these bio-engineered viral particles are

49:03.300 --> 49:08.580
pretty dangerous and I got one day training to get prepared for this

49:13.740 --> 49:22.420
so you don't have to worry use your mission on August I want to end the

49:22.420 --> 49:26.880
following morning your ambulances line up out of gifts and we potato true we're

49:26.880 --> 49:36.600
not prepared before we then knew it we're already overwhelmed with so many

49:36.600 --> 49:51.960
patients you should give me that or that impression I was in Hades because

49:51.960 --> 49:55.900
it was a mixture structure the patients are vomiting leading and having

49:55.900 --> 49:59.320
diarrhea on the floor and Morgan will see two three brothers I've already died

49:59.320 --> 50:04.300
and the bodies are still there that would they remove her now one thing I find

50:04.380 --> 50:09.100
interesting and I again what I'm what I want to start doing as an exercise in a

50:09.100 --> 50:14.300
way of focusing and being objective is to ask this question out loud what model

50:14.300 --> 50:19.220
of reality are they are they foisting on us here and the model of reality that

50:19.220 --> 50:26.380
they seem to be foisting on us is that if you get Ebola it is devastating but

50:26.380 --> 50:30.540
it's transmitted through bodily fluids so I guess they're vomiting on the floor

50:30.540 --> 50:36.940
and stuff and so that vomit must have virus in it right and so it should be

50:36.940 --> 50:42.540
relatively abundant in these patients and relatively abundant in their fluids

50:42.540 --> 50:48.460
and therefore it should be quite easy to isolate to characterize yada yada yada

50:48.460 --> 50:56.060
yet they never do it and this is the objection that these that these these

50:56.060 --> 51:00.220
people that go all the way back to those that question the AIDS virus and the

51:00.620 --> 51:06.460
the sort of narrative around that it's the same skepticism that applies here and it is

51:06.460 --> 51:12.860
justified skepticism you just have to be aware of that and think about it about

51:12.860 --> 51:17.900
the model that they're implying here so that you see where the skepticism comes

51:17.900 --> 51:22.300
from and why it is is pretty well founded

51:22.380 --> 51:31.580
now again don't get me wrong I'm not saying that there isn't an Ebola I'm

51:31.580 --> 51:35.020
saying that it is likely that it didn't come from the bush meat that these

51:35.020 --> 51:40.780
people ate or were exposed to that's not how it works Ebola might very well be

51:40.780 --> 51:46.620
something that was was made manufactured cloned from the wild and then deployed

51:46.620 --> 51:51.100
in the same place that they found it to see what it does

51:51.180 --> 51:55.900
there's a million different explanations for it that don't involve some kind of

51:55.900 --> 52:03.500
spectacular magic of a RNA virus that replicates with high fidelity and

52:03.500 --> 52:07.820
and people just barely escape from having everybody you know

52:07.820 --> 52:11.340
the story they will tell you is that airborne Ebola is the most

52:11.340 --> 52:15.580
dangerous idea in the world and that if airborne Ebola was to get on an

52:15.580 --> 52:18.940
airplane in land in New York City we would have a disaster

52:18.940 --> 52:25.260
why do they tell that story why have they been telling that story

52:25.260 --> 52:30.620
I would kind of at this point come to a reasonable conclusion that the reason

52:30.620 --> 52:34.780
why they've been telling us that story specifically using New York

52:34.780 --> 52:39.180
as an example is because they were planning to use New York as an

52:39.180 --> 52:43.020
example and Jessica Hockett is is on it like a

52:43.020 --> 52:48.860
hot knife through butter it's it's impossible not to see it

52:48.860 --> 52:54.780
if you just look and then if you if you line up all the narratives that they've

52:54.780 --> 52:59.180
told us before all the stories that they've told it's kind of weird right that

52:59.180 --> 53:02.780
every time they bring up Ebola and then they talk about airborne Ebola

53:02.780 --> 53:07.740
they talk about airborne Ebola in New York City

53:08.460 --> 53:12.940
and how many people have you heard say that I've heard quite a few people

53:12.940 --> 53:18.860
tell that exact exact set of hypotheticals in three days time

53:18.860 --> 53:23.260
the entire unit was full meanwhile there was two patients within

53:23.260 --> 53:27.180
outside again and they are begging every time we go to

53:27.180 --> 53:30.380
the get their begging to come in there's a serious situation

53:30.380 --> 53:33.900
we have 35 best they already have some of the one patients on the one

53:33.900 --> 53:41.100
you don't have beds for you facing a group of people see that

53:41.100 --> 53:45.980
that I'm totally down with I'm very down with the idea that this

53:45.980 --> 53:50.220
could be an energy weapon or deployment of some other

53:50.220 --> 53:54.140
toxin because again what are they doing they're

53:54.140 --> 53:57.180
treating these patients they're not testing and characterizing and

53:57.180 --> 54:00.460
culturing the virus and trying to see if they're related to each other

54:00.460 --> 54:05.660
none of that's happening here you can see that right that's very clear

54:05.660 --> 54:09.740
right these people could be could have been sprayed with or

54:09.740 --> 54:13.900
exposed to anything and they're being treated like they have Ebola

54:13.900 --> 54:17.740
their symptoms are similar trying to give them fluids antibiotics and other

54:17.740 --> 54:20.620
medicines

54:21.980 --> 54:26.540
and then it never ends and it never ends what

54:26.540 --> 54:30.140
as you are walking out a new patient is walking in

54:30.140 --> 54:33.100
and then when you go home and come back the following morning

54:33.100 --> 54:36.460
they're selling it there for a night

54:41.100 --> 54:44.460
what is the model of reality being implied here

54:44.460 --> 54:47.900
keep asking that question

54:51.260 --> 54:55.180
I think we all underestimate it absolutely everybody

54:55.180 --> 54:58.300
I know that one case of Ebola is an emergency

54:58.300 --> 55:07.020
every new case can give rise to more cases so it's really act now okay later

55:07.020 --> 55:10.060
right now the World Health Organization and other doctors are saying it is out

55:10.060 --> 55:14.380
of control so I do think that the the model of Ebola that's being implied

55:14.380 --> 55:17.500
here is that Ebola has the potential to sustain itself

55:17.500 --> 55:22.060
indefinitely and to circulate around the globe and it's only because

55:22.060 --> 55:26.460
of a very firm and controlling response

55:26.460 --> 55:30.300
that quarantines these people and gets them out of their villages and stops

55:30.300 --> 55:34.380
the spread of the virus has that been so far avoided but

55:34.380 --> 55:39.500
if that should happen that this is something that will kill

55:39.500 --> 55:42.780
lots and lots of people that's what's being implied here and make no

55:42.780 --> 55:46.220
mistake about it they have not shown you any evidence for that they haven't even

55:46.220 --> 55:50.140
shown you evidence of it spreading anywhere

55:50.860 --> 55:53.660
they just showing you a bunch of sick people and telling you that there's

55:53.660 --> 55:56.700
more and there's more and there's more sick people so you could do that with

55:56.700 --> 56:00.700
more and more deployment of something too

56:03.980 --> 56:10.140
and so we've got to be very very careful here because we are being played

56:10.300 --> 56:14.780
and we have to be very skeptical of the biology that we are being played with

56:14.780 --> 56:21.340
I think this is one of the key one of the key angles that they use

56:21.340 --> 56:25.980
mythology to to control us with in this area of West Africa is the worst

56:25.980 --> 56:29.260
outbreak ever that they've recorded in this part of the world it's unprecedented

56:29.260 --> 56:32.940
for several reasons one first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak

56:32.940 --> 56:36.220
secondly it is the first time that three countries are involved this is a Dutch

56:36.220 --> 56:42.380
man you can hear it is accent I just say that because there is a

56:42.380 --> 56:48.780
there is an interesting subculture of extremely rich right that we're

56:48.780 --> 56:52.700
talking about here and there is a natalone's

56:52.700 --> 56:55.900
connection there why is there a natalone's connection there because

56:55.900 --> 57:00.540
the Dutch East Indies company was one of the first

57:00.540 --> 57:07.180
weaponized piles of money and if you imagine the possibility that that

57:07.180 --> 57:13.180
or descendants of it still exist and descendants of those families that

57:13.180 --> 57:17.420
controlled those weaponized piles of money still exist

57:17.420 --> 57:22.540
that's I believe what we're dealing with I don't know how many people or families

57:22.540 --> 57:25.420
it is but we're talking about you just have to

57:25.420 --> 57:29.100
imagine if you had a lot of money back then

57:29.100 --> 57:33.980
and you were able to continue as like have a linked bloodline how much money

57:33.980 --> 57:36.940
would you have now

57:39.900 --> 57:43.820
that's what we're dealing with multi-generational wealth that is

57:43.820 --> 57:47.660
basically completely under our radar as we have paid attention to Coca-Cola

57:47.660 --> 57:53.980
and Walt Disney and that multi-generational wealth is now

57:53.980 --> 57:58.220
as always competing for the control of the world but now

57:58.220 --> 58:04.940
since the the theater is out in the open

58:04.940 --> 58:08.700
since really anybody that's paying attention can figure out that Ukraine

58:08.700 --> 58:12.700
isn't Ukraine and that Biden isn't Biden and the Trump isn't Trump and that

58:12.700 --> 58:16.860
you know nobody is who they say they are if they're on TV

58:16.860 --> 58:22.460
and they're they're all players

58:22.940 --> 58:29.500
wrangling for increased ranked inside of this ruling class

58:29.500 --> 58:33.660
once you realize that and we realize that you are not in that club and that's

58:33.660 --> 58:37.900
why these people act so smug because they know they've got the badge

58:37.900 --> 58:43.340
they've got the badge it's under their coat or it's it's in their pocket

58:43.340 --> 58:46.860
the little challenge coin or whatever it is they were given

58:46.860 --> 58:50.700
their little Freemason ring their their tattoo I don't know

58:50.700 --> 58:55.340
maybe it's different for every group but whatever it is they all know they've

58:55.340 --> 59:00.300
got a position on the hypothetical arc or a position in a bunker somewhere

59:00.300 --> 59:06.220
whatever it is they've been told imagine how powerful it would be

59:06.220 --> 59:10.460
if you took somebody to a elaborate underground base and said look there's

59:10.460 --> 59:17.500
your name on the door if you join us if you do what you're told at least you

59:18.380 --> 59:22.700
when the stuff really goes down you've got a place with us here

59:22.700 --> 59:26.140
and then two weeks later they bring another dude downstairs and put his name

59:26.140 --> 59:29.340
on that door and give him the same song and dance and now

59:29.340 --> 59:33.900
suddenly you have a bunch of people that will do whatever you ask them to do

59:33.900 --> 59:38.140
say whatever you need them to say on network news

59:38.140 --> 59:42.700
think about how easy that is that's like a reality tv show weaponized

59:43.180 --> 59:47.980
to rule a country but now for everybody they do it differently maybe they

59:47.980 --> 59:51.420
do it with drugs in a camera with somebody with a girl in a camera with

59:51.420 --> 59:56.060
somebody with with whatever in a camera with somebody

59:56.060 --> 59:59.420
gambling you know you name it

59:59.980 --> 01:00:04.300
just like you don't need one explanation to explain what happened around the

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.020
world during the pandemic they could have done it different in

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.420
England than they did it in America than they did it in

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.300
Australia than they did it in the Netherlands

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.820
and almost certainly they did

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.740
and when you watch a film like this and you hear a Dutch guy talking about

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.780
Ebola then you should see already that it's a very limited

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.700
connectivity pattern here

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.980
both and certainly it's the first time that we have outbreaks in

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.500
capitals in capitals this could explode into a really mega crisis

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.460
I think so and it is already a mega crisis I really thought how can this

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:46.540
epidemic be controlled in the usual way when there are so many

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.580
outbreaks different places the three countries in West Africa that

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.180
are affected by the Ebola outbreak have some of the worst health indicators

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.900
in the world they're not enough doctors they're not enough nurses

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:04.300
it is a system that is understaffed underfunded and where the infrastructure

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.180
is very very old

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.860
let's go back to 1976 when you were a younger man

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.860
and you actually co-discovered this virus it was in Zaire

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:18.300
now the Democratic Republic of the Congo and they said that there was a mysterious

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.140
epidemic this was very lethal high mortality there were

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:27.580
nuns who had died a small group would go to the mission where the

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.740
epidemic had started apparently they asked the volunteers and I think I was

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.100
about the first one to raise my hand

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.140
although I had absolutely zero experience in doing this

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.340
our mission was to one to put in place some basic measures to contain it

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.060
and using quarantine that's what we thought and

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.220
two to find out how is this transmitted because

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.460
that's the key to stop epidemics to know exactly what the risk is how is

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.700
it transmitted it's really a detective work

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.180
so we tested whole villages talk to the population

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.060
and then have a very primitive questionnaire

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.420
how old where have they been have they traveled

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.940
and so you could imagine that there were very few survivors

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.900
very few and then you can imagine a scenario then

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:29.180
keep in mind where this guy is unwittingly taking part in this to a

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:33.580
certain extent because he has been asked by his grant

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.740
committee or by his his grant funding agency

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:43.500
to learn how come up with strategies to

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:49.020
answer the question of how is this virus transmitted

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.460
and so because he is interested in the answer to that question

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:59.100
he will participate gladly in this what he sees as a scientific endeavor to

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.380
try and understand how this virus is transmitted

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:07.100
he has already accepted the existence of the virus

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.220
he's already accepted its origin must be just nature

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.940
or that that's not a question that he's being paid to ask

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:21.180
and so a combination of getting people to focus on just one

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.580
question rather than bigger questions just this one

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.260
and making their salary and livelihood dependent on it their fame and

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:33.900
fortune their status dependent on it a film

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.300
see it

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:43.100
indeed the so what we call case fatality rate

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.300
was over 90 percent

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.220
nearly all of us come from animals made we're also an animal we're

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.620
touching the fish but she didn't eat it so during the outbreak we started

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:13.020
collecting samples from all kinds of animals

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.500
and even to blood from pigs because a number of pigs had died

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.380
at the beginning of the epidemic so we said you never know

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.820
but we didn't find it and why did they think that the virus would be in the

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.140
blood

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:33.740
isn't that a giant assumption and how are they testing for it

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.380
what do you think

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:42.460
I almost bet dollars to donuts they were testing for antibodies to it

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.820
what do you think about them apples

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:49.900
they could have been doing PCR but I don't know maybe they did maybe they

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.740
did that let's let maybe he'll say it

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:56.380
any trace of Ebola my boss at the time the fan battalion had always told me

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.540
watch out for the for the bats and it became a bit of a joke

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:05.900
but the old man was right because the only reservoir that we think

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.100
were Ebola's hiding are some kind of food eating bats

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:18.300
oh here we go on a bike it's George Gao on a bike nice

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.460
GC on a bike yo look at that I gotta go back to GC on a bike

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.660
that's GC on a bike look at GC on a bike

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.740
I really like to read all these you know science fixings

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.820
I realize science really fantastic fantastic something new

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:42.460
oh so this is why I'm working on the emerging or emerging bacteria and

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.580
viruses I think for the Ebola when you put all the data together

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.860
a transmission or a GG on a bike cycle is clear

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:56.060
so definitely it's from bats and then you have a intermediate host

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.180
it could be some memos in that in that African region

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.700
and then for the home of these I could also be directed from bats

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.580
to humans

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.380
you can see Ebola, SARS and MERS all these virus they are from bats

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.980
so bats are very serious problem

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:22.140
if we look around the world so I got a story about bats when we moved to this

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:29.980
is funny when we moved up to uh kadot wisconsin where I basically grew up from

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.260
what grade would it have been fourth grade or so

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:39.500
which is where my father also grew up and so I had almost all of my father's

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.980
significant school teachers including his history teacher basketball coach who

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.180
wasn't coaching basketball anymore but still history teacher

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.140
his algebra teacher and his civics teacher

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:57.100
and maybe that's it but oh no and it's chemistry teacher I think

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.700
but anyway the point is I was a Wisconsin boy my whole life I graduated

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.700
from high school up there from a high school graduating class of like 80

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:12.700
some kids and when we moved up to that hometown

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.780
we bought a house across from the catholic church

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.660
and it was kind of a house that it was in need of repair so we got it kind of

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.740
cheap when we bought the house believe it or not there was a

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.260
small helicopter in two parts in the living room the living room wasn't that

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:37.340
big the helicopter was that small um and the bats in the in the attic

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.260
had crapped so much that you couldn't see

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.940
the rafters in the attic when you went up there

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:51.260
so my father and I using like really not even masks but just bandanas

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.220
shoveled all that out which just tried to imagine the dust that was involved

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.980
in that um and then also before we did that of course

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.620
we had to put buckets of open pneumonia up there

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.260
ammonia up there to try and get the bats out but

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.700
there were hundreds of them up there and we had multiple

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.300
of them in the house during the course of trying to drive them out

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.660
um and in retrospect I feel really bad because

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.740
um I mean it was a spectacular number of bats like I

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.100
I think it was part of might have been part of the reason why we got the house

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.060
so cheap but anyway uh and I didn't get any viruses from that so little brown

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.460
bats are not dangerous apparently at least not in

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.860
Wisconsin you can see that bat populations are

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.700
being severely successful bandanas are totally magical

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.380
some of them because they live in the upper tiers of rainforests

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.900
and feed on wild fruit but the upper tiers of the rainforests are getting

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.220
the most impacted yes we did put all of that in the

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.020
garden so we didn't we that was the same place

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.700
that we we you know wrote took all the sod off of it wrote

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.900
until the day and it was uh yeah definitely

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.700
my dad knew what he was doing when that was that that was definitely an

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.860
opportunity of this heat increase an increased uv radiation

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.740
add to that that humans are encroaching into the rainforests

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.420
into bat habitats precious caves they're very shy creatures

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.900
they do not seek you out no matter what vampire movies you ever saw

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.740
as humans encroach we see more and more bat populations starving

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:22.940
and coming into human habitation areas to feed on our agricultural production

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.740
and in the process they're passing their virus on

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.580
to other animals and to humans

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.020
we are imposing changes in the microbial world

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:38.860
willy nilly thoughtless and we do so at our peril

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.820
we have dramatically increased our contact with animals in a variety of

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.580
ways through deforestation industrialization of

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.500
agriculture and vastly increased consumption of animals

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.980
so in one sense there are less animals because we're deforestating

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.100
but then deforesting but then deforesting drives

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:01.180
those animals into us somehow where they weren't

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.420
before because they had their own space and

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.620
and don't just it don't animals just die when you take away

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.220
acres and acres of forest they don't just all move into the part of the

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.340
forest that's left i mean that's not how it works right

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.500
otherwise there would be parts of the amazon that were just

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.420
crowded with animals what is this it doesn't even

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.140
make sense

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.660
hiv spread out of africa from a few monkeys and chimpanzees to infect

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:31.260
millions of people on every continent

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.940
sars jumped from a bat to a civic cat so he's listing it now and now he's

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.500
listing it hold on here and actually increased our contact with animals

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.980
in a variety of ways through deforestation industrialization of

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:47.900
agriculture and vastly increased consumption of animals

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.580
hiv spread out of africa from a few monkeys and chimpanzees to infect

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.940
millions of people on every continent

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:58.700
and so here we are right in 2017 where the

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.300
narrative that cnn is pushing is that bushmeat

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.380
is aids it's the exact same narrative that that

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:10.220
Brett Weinstein started out with at the beginning of the pandemic

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:15.340
that aids is bushmeat and brick and cove it must be bushmeat and even if it

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.740
isn't we should definitely control bushmeat

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.300
and they were advocating for it multiple shows we got to close these

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.980
crazy markets they've gotten these places i mean it's just insane

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.140
and that's how they were talking again

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.460
basically getting us to ask the wrong questions making us sure we're never

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.380
gonna get out of the cave sars jumped from a bat to a civic

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.100
cat to a villager in china to more than 30 countries

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.300
in a matter of weeks you don't think that's what wasting disease

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.700
in in deer is all about

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.180
i mean that that's something quite frankly i think is just to try and

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.860
discourage people from taking part in hunting anymore to make it

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.660
less and less attractive you know you know how many

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.980
how many deer do you have to show on tv with wasting disease how many

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.340
how many news reports do you have to do before some people are just like maybe

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.820
i'm not going to go hunting this year because i don't want to take a chance

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:15.660
with that

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.300
animal and human health are completely linked

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.140
in the 21st century 75 percent of all new infectious diseases

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.060
have come from animals 75 percent what does that even mean

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:33.420
in other cases three out of four like mosquitoes

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.500
if anyone had sat down and done you know a fantasy

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.700
hit parade of emerging boys she's getting quite a quite a

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.620
starring role in this isn't she diseases that might come to the america's

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:49.660
from africa or from asia zika would never have even been on the list

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:54.140
zika laris originated in africa and had never been off the african continent

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.540
until started making its way across asia and south pacific

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.940
ending up in french polynesia and yap

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.580
the app is a small place that most people have never heard of

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.900
but when zika hit it 70 percent of the population got infected

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.420
that was really quite startling if anybody had been paying attention

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.180
but they weren't zika jumped from the south pacific to brazil

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.980
in 2013 two years before it was identified there

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.420
the timeline corresponds to an increase in travel between the south pacific and

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.620
brazil including visitors who attended a pre-world

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:33.260
cup soccer tournament a confederation cup

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.900
someone was carrying the zika virus and some mosquitoes that that individual

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:45.660
absorbed the virus and that's the beginning of this saga

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.260
and that's also the alnino weather event

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:53.260
provided the necessary ingredients that's also something there right what is

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.060
the model of reality that's implied here the model of

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.300
reality that is implied is that people carrying the virus

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:05.020
carry it in such a uniform distribution in their blood

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:10.940
that a mosquito size drop of their blood will eventually contain that virus

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:15.580
and then can be transmitted by it

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.860
say what wait

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:26.140
attended the pre-world cup soccer tournament

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.020
the confederation cup

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:35.580
someone was carrying the zika virus and some mosquitoes that that individual

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:39.980
absorbed the virus and that's the beginning of this saga

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:47.020
what how is that what that's that's extraordinary if you think about it

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.340
i mean that's really extraordinary because i'm not really sure that mosquitoes

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:56.220
bite like lots of people now i'm no entomologist

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:01.340
but if a mosquito bites until it's full and then flies away and i have an itchy

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.660
bump i think that mosquito goes off to lay eggs

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:10.700
am i wrong here i mean mosquitoes don't live for like you know

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:16.140
months and months and months they can't live more than a season right

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.820
i mean let's just be ridiculously naive about it when we're not

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:23.580
mosquitoes don't live that long they get eaten by everything that they

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:26.700
they fly past

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:32.380
and some birds eat their weight and mosquitoes every day

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:36.140
mosquitoes don't bite like animals all over the place they don't go from

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.940
into a concert and bite 17 people that what is she talking about

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:45.820
but that's the model of reality that she gives us

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:50.460
a model that makes predictions that can't be verified that won't verify you

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:53.900
know they won't if you just turn your imagination long enough to entertain

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.980
it

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.540
and that's the beauty of what i'm learning from the broken science initiative that

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.180
this way of thinking about how knowledge is created

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:09.580
through the use of model verification using models to make predictions and then

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.460
see if those predictions come true and if they don't

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.780
change the model in an intelligent thoughtful way

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.180
which tries to encompass that new observation

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.820
as we were talking about with map Briggs yesterday

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.740
if you have a model that recapitulates the past but you crank it forward and it

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:33.340
can't make useful predictions something might be wrong with it

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.660
and so if she explains the Zika virus as spreading by a

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.180
mosquito carrying something from victim to victim

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.860
then that's a certain model that makes certain predictions that

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:53.100
i'm sure mosquito scientists would tell you are it cannot be true

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.220
and yet they're allowed to get away with it because of this extreme

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.340
specialization well i'm just a mosquito guy so i don't want to correct a

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.540
virologist i'm just a mosquito guy i make my

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.140
i get my grants by their diseases so i wouldn't want to correct them on

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:14.700
mosquito basic biology do you see how this works

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.380
and then undoubtedly the El Nino weather event

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.820
provided the necessary ingredients rainfall and drought

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.700
that fundamentally changed the conditions on the ground and allowed for

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.740
the spread of this virus

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.460
so more mosquitoes spread it all over the place so in the unlucky people who got

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.020
bit by mosquito that bit somebody else that sucked just

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.380
enough of the virus out of them but not enough blood to make eggs so then they

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.300
bit somebody else holy cow

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.500
only weeds and mosquitoes

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.580
that's like a birth defect in my mind that's like a developmental disorder

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:13.580
then how does that happen from a virus

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:32.940
and now we are being forced to ask questions that give us the wrong model

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.860
of things in our head we are asking the question of how

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.940
how do we stop this virus how do we prevent this this

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.260
this suffering from happening but we talked to to

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.820

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.540
i can't remember but we talked to the guy who wrote the book about this this is

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:56.540
this was all a weird story they were telling

01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.540
and we don't know if it was because of herbicides or insecticides or

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:04.300
chemical spill or what i don't know what they did

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.660
i mean just they wanted to give people and they wanted to give

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.700
uh start with the idea that that pregnant women could be vaccinated

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.220
that pregnant women could be injected with things in order to prevent disease

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:20.940
in the baby and so that whole concept had to be rolled out somewhere where

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.740
they could just bully the population with a narrative

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.180
so they did it there they do it in Africa that's what i think you have to

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:31.020
see this as they tell us these stories they've told us

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.980
these stories you know Stephen Hatfield has told us these

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.060
stories about Ebola but it's not really the stories

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:43.980
they're not these are not truthful people they are part of a ruling elite

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:49.020
which tell us stories so that we they have a grip on our understanding of

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.620
reality a full grip on our understanding of reality

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:57.660
it is very similar to what dullis said when the United States

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:01.260
populists everything they believe is a lie

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:05.420
then we will finally be in control that that's that's where we are

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.900
and that's what the unique opportunity of covid and the pandemic is for all of

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:14.300
us we can turn to our children we can turn to the young adults around

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.340
us and say you know there's an alternative way to see what happened

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.540
over the last four years and there's still time to learn from it

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:25.260
there's still time for us to collectively put our pants back on

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:30.540
and and get to work building a republic that we can all be proud of

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.860
that's founded on moral principles that are anchored in some

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:41.340
reverence for the sacred some understanding that what we are is

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:47.660
is more than a than a clock more than a fancy machine

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:52.460
and i'm all about beautiful things and intricate mechanisms and all this

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:57.260
other stuff but what life is is not an elaborate

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:01.020
clockwork although that can be a useful analogy we're not

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:04.940
trying to understand parts of that pattern integrity

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:08.620
it is not a useful analogy when trying to understand

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.100
what the whole of life is and how it works

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.580
and that's unfortunately what they are

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:20.860
messing with us here they want us to accept simple models of reality and

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:24.460
simple models of our relationship to the world

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:31.180
biologically so that we will accept their simple model of medicine

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.940
and and accept that our our bodies essentially are broken

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:40.700
they're vulnerable and they're weak and it has nothing to do with what we are

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:44.220
eating nothing to do with what we are exposed to nothing to do with what we're

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.780
not doing it has all to do with vulnerabilities

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:54.620
just because nature is mean that's the big model of reality that this

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:59.340
this movie seems to be starting out with showing with Ebola and now Zika

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.780
and we'll see how it goes forward

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:15.420
and so the average skilled tv watcher when they listen to this woman is not

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.900
thinking about is it really a virus has she been misled

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:23.340
by governments around the world into thinking that this is something that it

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:28.140
isn't so that they can do their thing

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.820
that's what i'm thinking that's what you should be thinking but that's not

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:38.300
what people who saw this in 2017 thought that's not what

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:45.100
a high school teacher of biology in 2017 would think that's not what a

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:49.420
wannabe state senator in pennsylvania would think if he saw this into or she

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.620
saw this in 2017 what do you i mean come on

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:57.980
you see the magic of this these people are insistent

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:03.740
as an enchantment that they are either under or they are casting

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:17.820
oh

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:51.100
In 2015, the Zika virus suddenly spread across Brazil, primarily through the bite of one

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.380
type of mosquito.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:57.820
The medical establishment only began to comprehend Zika's danger, as the number of babies born

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.660
with the birth defect microcephaly started to dramatically increase.

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:31.460
Now, notice very carefully here that, notice very carefully here, can you see if I got

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.440
a box out there?

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:43.780
If you notice carefully here, they are amplifying this idea that, ooh, we saw a signal that there's

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:44.780
microencephaly.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.580
I called some other people, and I was on this chat group, and we all agreed that there was

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.540
more microencephaly.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:58.260
What I need you to see clearly here is that that did not happen in COVID, and anything

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:03.340
that did happen at the beginning of COVID, any agreement like that, any who we called

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:09.340
other doctors, and coincidentally, we're done with what?

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:13.820
With the team worst-case scenario.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:19.100
The best agreement that we have across early 2020, across most doctors, is that nothing

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.220
happened.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:29.060
And so it is an extraordinary thing that now, when we have signals like doctors apparently

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:37.060
all agreed that there's some kind of new rise in cancer, we ignore it.

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:44.980
We have all of these embalmers saying that, well, it's getting a lot harder to get these

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:49.220
dead bodies to perfuse, we don't care.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.460
What is going on then?

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.700
You have to only see it as what it is.

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.380
It's purposeful governance.

01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:01.900
It is a limited spectrum of debate, and some of those subjects are not within that limited

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:02.900
spectrum of debate.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:08.820
And if they are, they are controlled in such a way so that they don't move the ball of

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:14.820
the novel virus that killed millions, that millions more were saved from, that will come

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.740
again because it was gain of function.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:24.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it, but I think it's going to be

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.740
a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:32.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:47.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:52.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:59.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:04.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:10.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:15.740
I think it's going to be a very difficult time to do it.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:21.740
Since the alarm went sounding around the world from Brazil, we have seen almost every day

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.740
another revelation about this virus.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.740
What we now know is that this is a very dangerous virus.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.740
We grossly underestimated it.

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:35.740
It is malaria in that it is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause enormous outbreaks.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.740
It is HIV in that it is sexually transmitted.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:44.740
It's worse than all of the above as we come to understand what this virus actually lives on.

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.740
Where does the virus go in a pregnant woman?

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.740
Wait, what?

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:51.740
It goes into this tiny forming creature, the fetus, and it feeds on it

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.740
and reinfects back into the mother's bloodstream over and over again.

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:58.740
What is it feeding on in that fetus?

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740
Baby brain cells.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740
Wow!

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:05.740
Every single part of the brain of that developing child is damaged.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:10.740
The Zika virus affects its victims in a completely different way from the Ebola virus.

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:15.740
It feeds on the baby's brain.

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:19.740
She said it feeds on the baby's brain.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740
Oh my gosh.

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.740
That can't be right.

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:27.740
That cannot be possibly substantiated in the literature.

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.740
There is no freaking way.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:33.740
Oh my gosh.

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.740
Oh, that is really alarming.

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:42.740
Some epidemics grab our attention, while others, in spite of the larger number of victims remain more hidden.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.740
I need to know more about the Zika virus.

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740
I will admit it.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.740
I've got to read the literature at least, so I know what they claim it does, but that seems pretty.

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.740
She said it was eating baby's brains.

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740
Wow!

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740
How does it get all the way there?

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.740
The brain is a pretty privileged place.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.740
I'll run it back.

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.740
And it's malaria in that it is trans...

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.740
What we now know is that this is a very dangerous virus.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.740
We grossly underestimated it.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.740
It is malaria in that it is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause enormous outbreaks.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.740
It is HIV in that it is sexually transmitted.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:23.740
And it's worse than all of the above, as we come to understand what this virus actually lives on.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.740
It lives on.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:30.740
As the virus go in a pregnant woman, it goes into this tiny forming creature, the fetus, and it feeds on it.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.740
And re-infects back into the mother's bloodstream over and over again.

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.740
And what is it feeding on in that fetus?

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.740
Baby brain cells.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:40.740
Wow!

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.740
I mean, why does it meet the mom's brain then?

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.740
What is going on here?

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:49.740
Did we really let them get away with this?

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.740
Holy cow!

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:55.740
And so, every single part of the brain of that developing child is damaged.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.740
The Zika virus affects its victims.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.740
Yeah, viruses eat things.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.740
Yes, that's right. They definitely eat them.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.740
They think they're in common.

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:03.740
Is how fast they can move.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:04.740
They move fast, too.

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:05.740
Man, they've had some.

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:06.740
While spearing others.

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.740
I mean, the speed of a mosquito.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:09.740
Let's grab our attention.

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.740
While others, in spite of the larger...

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.740
Or a one-night stand, I guess.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:20.740
They need to go full shaft.

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:24.740
They still get them walking.

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.740
Here we go.

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:32.740
2014 influenza outbreak.

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.740
We're inside of Minnesota.

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.740
It's a beautiful town.

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:41.740
To me, it's like Mayberry RFP.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:45.740
To me, it's like Mayberry RFE, Opie Taylor's town.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.740
Minnesota is where Ulster Home is.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.740
It's a princess.

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:49.740
It was sick.

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.740
And the chief brought her here because of the healing waters.

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.740
When we moved here, it just felt like home.

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.740
I think we got lucky.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.740
The good Lord just gave us two good kids.

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:05.740
Sarah was always the princess of Shannon's opposite.

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.740
She was a tomboy.

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.740
She loved skateboarding.

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.740
And she loved video games.

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.740
Shannon, she's a complete surprise.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.740
Sarah was almost 16.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.740
And I was 40.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.740
She was at a joy.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.740
Right from the get-go.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.740
She was a joy for everybody.

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.740
We were a tight family.

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.740
Her first line up by herself.

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.740
Oh, my gosh.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.740
I remember when she got a permit.

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.740
She was just so tickled.

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.740
She goes by herself.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.740
I saw her so proud of her.

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:35.740
Oh, my gosh.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:36.740
Oh, my gosh.

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:37.740
Somebody's driving.

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.740
I don't have to pay these parents.

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.740
They missed their daughter.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.740
And they were told their daughter was killed by the flu.

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:45.740
So what are they going to do?

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.740
She was in her senior year of high school.

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:50.740
She came home Wednesday night.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.740
Couldn't possibly be being mistreated at the hospital.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.740
That was Wednesday.

01:31:54.740 --> 01:32:00.740
And Thursday, she does seem to be, you know, baseline for being sick.

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.740
But she wasn't getting better.

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.740
And that's when Terry and I agreed that we've got to take her.

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:08.740
And I took her that Sunday to go to the hospital.

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:09.740
We waited two hours.

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:10.740
It was that pack.

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.740
That's when I knew there was a big epidemic of flu going on.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.740
And she's sitting next to me and she's got her head on me.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.740
And I took to selfie.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.740
Senator Mom saying we're still waiting.

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.740
The doctor said it was just a flu that I had to run this course.

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:25.740
They gave her some cough medicine just for comfort.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.740
And Terry went to the hospital.

01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.740
Well, I got her back up in her bed.

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:34.740
Here we go.

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:35.740
Are these the real messages?

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740
I don't know.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.740
It could be.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:38.740
I guess.

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:39.740
Come on.

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.740
I don't know.

01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.740
It's good brainwashing if it's not, right?

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:46.740
I mean, this is propaganda extraordinaire.

01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.740
It's about five o'clock in the morning.

01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:51.740
I was sitting in the living room and I heard her moving around upstairs.

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:52.740
I thought, wow.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.740
She's getting out of bed.

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.740
I got up and I went to the coffee.

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.740
I mean, if you say sepsis in the in the chat, right?

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:01.740
That's what we're talking about here.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.740
I just to remind you, I can put the chat of the other one up.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.740
Let's see who's in there.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:08.740
I'm in the chat testing peer to base solar flare.

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.740
Nice work way to go.

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.740
If you say that in the chat, sepsis, that's the point, right?

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.740
If you say it's a virus and antibiotics don't work on virus,

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.740
you know, it's a virus.

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:19.740
That's the point, right?

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:22.740
If you say it's a virus and antibiotics don't work on viruses,

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:26.740
then there's a whole host of things you have just ruled out.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:31.740
There's a whole host of things that will now kill you if you're wrong.

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.740
That's the best way to put it.

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:38.740
If you rule out anything that antibiotics,

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.740
antibiotics won't work for what ails you and you're wrong.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:50.740
There are lots of things that antibiotics can fix that will kill you.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:53.740
Is that making perfect sense?

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.740
If antibiotics are necessary, rather, let me say it again,

01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:03.740
if you decide that antibiotics are not necessary and you're wrong,

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:08.740
there is a whole list of things that antibiotics can help with

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.740
that can also kill you.

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:16.740
I can make her and I saw in my peripheral that she got up and she went into the bathroom.

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.740
She tapped on the shower curtain and I said,

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.740
you want to take a shower?

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:20.740
And she nodded.

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:21.740
Yes.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:22.740
I said, okay.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.740
I was filling the water up and all that got about so full,

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.740
she laid back that her knees kept buckling and you know,

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:31.740
she could push it on the end of the time to keep herself from sliding under it.

01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:33.740
See the thing I'm going to say something else here.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:36.740
I'm never going to get through this video in time for basketball.

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.740
The thing that I'll say here is what I find very interesting about the attack on

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:47.740
the wellness company is that it sort of in a way ends up to be an

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:52.740
indirect attack on what they're actually selling or started selling,

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:54.740
which is what?

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:57.740
It is the Z shield,

01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:03.740
which is Dr. Zelenko's argument that he made in this video from his phone

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:08.740
in his car before he died where he said, Hey,

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:10.740
this is a national security secret here.

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.740
But you know, zinc and a zinc ionophore is all you need for all of these RNA viruses.

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.740
He made a little video of it that I'm sure I have on my hard drive somewhere that I

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:26.740
didn't find for this because I didn't realize it was going to, I would want it so quickly.

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:30.740
But I assure you that video is there and more importantly, I assure you that that's what

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.740
Z shield the product is.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:39.740
It's a green tea extract, which purportedly has the molecular property of being a zinc ionophore

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.740
to allow zinc into cells.

01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:43.740
Apparently, I don't know how that works.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.740
But that's what I'm told.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.740
It can transport zinc or help zinc it in.

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:53.740
Then there's zinc and there's some other, I don't know, St. John's root or wart or something in there.

01:35:53.740 --> 01:36:07.740
The point is, is that that debate in reality ends up throwing shade attention on the debate

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:11.740
about there being a need for novel treatments.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.740
There being suppression of novel treatments.

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:20.740
And so you get people again, whether you approach it from the perspective of skepticism of the

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:26.740
wellness company or the idea that the wellness company is trying to help people, you're still

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:33.740
asking a question that gets you to accept a model where there is a novel virus that does

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.740
need probably, or at least that it's a relevant question, do we need new treatments for it?

01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.740
Were these new treatments effective?

01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.740
What did they do?

01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:46.740
And the crazy part about it is, is that there might be a kernel of truth in there.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:51.740
That's the part that I'm going to go all the way back to Zev himself, who's the only person

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:57.740
that I would consider in that group of people and those following as being the person I'd

01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.740
want to think about listening to.

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:03.740
When I look at the videos of Zev, when I listen to what he said about the transfection and

01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:09.740
when I listen to what he says about RNA viruses in general, his insistence was that zinc is

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:17.740
a primary limiting factor when it comes to fighting or repelling these RNA-based viruses,

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:24.740
because the enzymes that degrade them, that can repel them, that can activate them, that

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:30.740
work, I guess, with toll receptors and whatever.

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.740
There's a lot of zinc-related processes there that you don't want to be short on it.

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.740
You want to make sure you've got enough of it, and that was his argument.

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.740
And so I find it very interesting that we're spending an enormous amount of time on these

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:49.740
fake social platforms, asking what I think are probably irrelevantly parallel questions

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:57.740
to what we need to be asking, which is, is this fundamental statement that Zev Zelenko made

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:04.740
right before he died, from his car in a mobile phone video, that it was a national security

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:12.740
secret priority to tell everybody that basically zinc plus quesareton, or zinc plus this green

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:18.740
T extract, was a pretty good countermeasure against most RNA viruses, especially those

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:23.740
that are transmitted by aerosol, and infect your lungs.

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.740
I just find it very curious.

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:33.740
And so these people probably have been bamboozled into believing that their daughter

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.740
definitely had flu, so there's no reason to give her antibiotics.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.740
And she probably died of sepsis.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.740
She probably died, and they're going to say it.

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.740
What does sepsis do? It's a multi-organ failure thing. Ready?

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.740
Nice our eyes.

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.740
And...

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:59.740
And around the wall, and we'll tear you up, so that she's not breathing, and I can run

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:04.740
down, and I still remember her on the floor.

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.740
Mom giving her CPR.

01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.740
I never had to do that before.

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.740
I never had to do that before.

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:16.740
Is she really crying? I'm starting to not even believe this.

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:19.740
All I could do is dial 911.

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.740
Oh, we needed that.

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.740
911, what's going on there?

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.740
My daughter's 17 years old.

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.740
She's not breathing.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:28.740
She's not breathing.

01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.740
Okay, I'm setting the turn.

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.740
Help me now, just stay online with me, okay?

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.740
Please.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:34.740
Please.

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:35.740
Please.

01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:36.740
Please.

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.740
Come over here.

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.740
I don't remember.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.740
He kind of died past him.

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.740
I just remember a pair of blue heads that kneeled down on the other side of her.

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.740
And he told me they'd take over, and I stepped away.

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740
Even when the...

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.740
I don't doubt that her daughter died.

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:49.740
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.740
It just was weird.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:54.740
It looked like she was kind of manufacturing that emotion, you know?

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:57.740
You might do that for a TV show, and it's just unfortunate.

01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.740
But it felt like that to me, sorry.

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.740
You know, I waved at the helicopter.

01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:04.740
You know, everything's fine.

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.740
I had no clue.

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:16.740
Now we have more sound effects and stuff.

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.740
I mean, come on, come on.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:26.740
You know, they told us that you didn't make it, and I said,

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:27.740
I want to see her.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:31.740
And they said, you never recognize her for what we've had to do to her.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:35.740
Because the flu actually killed all of her organs long before she actually died.

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.740
See?

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.740
I told you.

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.740
I still think she had to be coming home.

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.740
Sepsis is a great call.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.740
I think that was really a great call.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.740
And then you have...

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:52.740
And then what is really crazy is, again, my studious chat is already on it.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:58.740
Of course, Paul Merrick is being kind of overshadowed by a lot of the people he travels with.

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:04.740
And people are poo-pooing his treatments for sepsis.

01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:07.740
And it's just...

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.740
I think Paul Merrick is one of the good ones.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:17.740
I think Paul Merrick has been upstaged by a number of people because that was what their job was.

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:22.740
And he's too humble of a guy to say anything he probably didn't even notice it.

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.740
I like Paul a lot.

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:29.740
And I think he's a very kind-hearted man.

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.740
And I know that he's aware that there's a lot of liars out there.

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:41.740
And I do really think that he's one of those dudes who just needed to be in the background.

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:43.740
And so that's where he has been.

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:50.740
I mean, not that he's not putting everything on the line or hasn't been fighting and traveling around the world doing the best he can.

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.740
I'm just saying that he hasn't been on Tucker Carlson for a reason.

01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:58.740
Will he be on Jimmy Dorr?

01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.740
I doubt it.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:05.740
You know, will Paul Merrick be tapped for NIH head?

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.740
I definitely doubt it.

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.740
You know, that's what I mean.

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.740
Being in the world as a parent is losing their child.

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.740
This is the most unnatural thing to happen to a human being.

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:22.740
And you stand next to it and you think, goodness, I am there to prevent this from happening.

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:25.740
And sometimes I cannot.

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:29.740
And sometimes I don't know why I cannot.

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:32.740
That sounds also out of German, okay.

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.740
The question of how and why one particular person may die from-

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.740
Listen to this music.

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:42.740
The million dollar question that we absolutely need to tackle.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.740
It is surprising how much we still need to learn about flu.

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.740
A disease which causes worldwide epidemics every year.

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.740
I find that extraordinary.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:54.740
So she wants to find out why some people die and some people don't.

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.740
And she imagines that it has nothing to do with the treatment.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:01.740
She assumes it doesn't.

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:06.740
And in fact, is asking the question based on the idea that it must be genetic.

01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:15.740
It must be a sum total of their genetic and physiological background that means they're going to survive or it's going to be asymptomatic.

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:29.740
You see, they're laying down the whole narrative that this girl was just an unfortunate random congruence of like, you know, bad genes and bad flu virus sequence.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:33.740
And that flu virus sequence happened to be really not the one that she needed.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.740
Wow.

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:38.740
Our little raspiness in her chest. The flu tells came back positive.

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.740
I actually remember saying, okay, it's just the flu. Like it was never a deal.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:46.740
It spreads across the globe, hospitalizing three to five million.

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:50.740
Within 24 hours, she would contribute to it.

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740
Look at this.

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.740
She's using 200,000 every year.

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.740
What?

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:58.740
As they were coding her.

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:01.740
The baby girl scarlet and pronounced dead.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:06.740
Are these all people that didn't get antibiotics that should have had them? Ask that question.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:11.740
Have we been doing this every year?

01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:18.740
I'm actually wondering now.

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.740
The majority of the adult insurance patients have some thing that we call a risk factor.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.740
They're a weak immune system before they have diabetes or obesity.

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:30.740
Pregnant women have a risk for both themselves as well as the child.

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.740
Okay, we know these factors.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:35.740
Jessica Hockett thinks that, too, that the flu shot actually does this.

01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:42.740
I agree that even the most healthy, young, unhappy, playful person is taken away from this planet within a couple of days.

01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:44.740
Every year.

01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:47.740
What a story she tells herself.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.740
Nice.

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.740
But what experts are really afraid of is a new strain of flu.

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:53.740
That's how I want to raise my kids.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:54.740
Can I show you?

01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.740
And you can help me if you want to donate, you know, a million dollars.

01:44:58.740 --> 01:44:59.740
That's what I would do with it.

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.740
I would start a biology school out in the wild of Pennsylvania.

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.740
But what experts are weird bikes and hunting?

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.740
When the police...

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.740
The population hasn't been exposed to before.

01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:11.740
Please fund me.

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:15.740
One that almost no one will have any immunity against.

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:20.740
When we think about the threat of a disease spreading around the world is a pandemic threat.

01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:23.740
Obviously airborne infections are at the very top.

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:31.740
Things like SARS and flu are something that we know is difficult to control because of the way it spreads through aerosol.

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:36.740
Most people become infectious with the flu before they even have symptoms.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:37.740
No immunity.

01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:45.740
But it can travel clearly across the world with an infectious disease incubating in them without them even knowing that they're sick yet.

01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:51.740
In 2009, a new flu emerged, H1N1, also known as swine flu.

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:58.740
We now know it first appeared in the U.S. in the pig industry, initially infecting people at state and county fairs.

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:04.740
In a little over a year, swine flu infected around 1.3 billion people.

01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:08.740
It was the most common shared experience on Earth.

01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:16.740
Fluent poses a strong pandemic threat because it has the ability to be both very contagious and very deadly.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:24.740
You're really not wrong, right?

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:28.740
And there's this place in Lausanne, Switzerland called the Chateau.

01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:33.740
And they have their own beer and they also have their own pizza.

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:50.740
And while I was studying in Lausanne as a grad student, visiting Henry Markham's lab and staying with Rodrigo in Sonya,

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:55.740
the second time I was there while those were the days.

01:46:56.740 --> 01:47:07.740
And the EPFL in Lausanne is just this technical university in Switzerland on the shore of Lake Geneva.

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.740
And they have this little bar and they made pizza.

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:24.740
And I can't say, I think honestly, if I was given one last hour in time to spend with my best friend and wife.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:30.740
Before everything vanished.

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:41.740
Without a doubt, I would go back to an evening at the Chateau in Lausanne and be able to order an apology and pizza and have some kind of beer that they would have on tap and

01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:45.740
hands it across the table from her.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:53.740
And I don't know that that's, I want my sons to be able to have that trip.

01:47:53.740 --> 01:48:06.740
I want my sons to be able to also experience pizza on a on a terrace in Italy and understand that they are at the peak of civilization.

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:12.740
And appreciate how sacred it is where we are.

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:19.740
The rich history and how long it took us to wake up. That's what I see coming.

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:27.740
But it's going to take a lot of pain and it's going to take a lot more action than my own, a lot more action than this stream.

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.740
But I'm really happy you guys are here.

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.740
Wow.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:40.740
What we're most worried about right now is this bird flu that we know is highly pathogenic.

01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.740
Bird flu.

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:44.740
Bird flu.

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:50.740
Currently this deadly new bird flu doesn't spread easily between people.

01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:54.740
I mean, that's part of the script, right? Listen to what he says.

01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:59.740
The age five and one kills between 50 and 60% of the people it infects.

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:03.740
Well, where does that statistic come from? You know, they make that statistic.

01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:08.740
He might even be just pulling it out of his back pocket.

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:13.740
Currently this deadly new bird flu doesn't spread easily between people.

01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:18.740
But it is spreading rapidly among wild birds in poultry.

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:23.740
Experts are afraid this could be a pandemic threat.

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.740
It's a live poultry market. So the birds are alive.

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:34.740
And when they're sold, they're sold alive because people value the fact that it's very fresh meat.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:40.740
Why do they value that? Well, because it tastes better because it's healthier.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:46.740
And you know, a live animal has a lot longer keep, right?

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:49.740
If you had like 10 chickens and you wanted to sell them over a week,

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:53.740
it would be a lot better than butchering them on Monday and then selling them until Friday, right?

01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.740
I mean, come on. This is just absurd.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:08.740
So you buy your chicken or your duck alive and then it is killed and cleaned and emptied, of course, eviscerated.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:14.740
The viscera go into some of these buckets here and then the birds are put in hot water

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:20.740
and then put in these drums where these little plastic tubings help get rid of the feathers.

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.740
And then when the birds have been defethered, eviscerated and cleaned,

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:28.740
then they're cut up and they're given back to the person who bought it.

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:33.740
The issue here is that the water is the same to clean all the ducks and chickens.

01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:41.740
The other issue is that these people are waiting in viscera feathers and the water that serves to clean them.

01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:45.740
So there's really a lot, a lot of virus here.

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:49.740
A lot of virus here and those people don't die.

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:54.740
The vast majority of them are fine for generations.

01:50:54.740 --> 01:51:00.740
So what are they really talking about here? There's virus here. Let's show me it. Quantify it.

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:05.740
They won't do that, but they will voice that model of reality on you.

01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:10.740
And that's where I really think we've upped our game a little bit because the model of reality

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:15.740
that this guy has accepted and is foisting on us because we're listening to him

01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.740
explain what he does and what his questions are about the world.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:26.740
We are accepting his assumptions and his assumptions are a model of reality.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:31.740
And so if you see those assumptions as a model of reality and then use it to make predictions

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:37.740
with your imagination about what that model predicts about reality and about the future,

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:42.740
you can then very easily see, but this guy doesn't understand reality because his model

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.740
doesn't make any verifiable predictions.

01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:49.740
Oh, I'm getting good at this.

01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:53.740
In 2011, when the Pasteur Institute started monitoring the wash water,

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:58.740
18% of the water samples were positive for H5N1.

01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:03.740
Water samples monitored by what PCR? So here we are again,

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:08.740
laying down a narrative based on assumptions that this is a high fidelity test,

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:13.740
a high fidelity way of tracking these RNA signals.

01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:18.740
These RNA signals that are super deadly concentrated in these places,

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.740
but we can just walk around here.

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:26.740
We don't need to protect ourselves from viruses that we're not even native to.

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:31.740
Think about how much contradiction is in this picture alone.

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:38.740
As he was looking down, almost describing it fearfully, now he's just gone down into the soup

01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:40.740
and it's totally okay.

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:43.740
It's fine. Who cares? Look at this.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:47.740
66% of samples were positive.

01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:50.740
We know that bird food is very, very deadly.

01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:53.740
And we know swine food spreads very quickly.

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.740
What we worry about is if those...

01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:00.740
The best part of meat preparation like this is I don't see any refrigerators.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:04.740
You know?

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:08.740
To re-assore and then we could have a new strain that literally could spread as quickly

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.740
as the swine food did but have the mortality rate of bird food.

01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:15.740
That's the big fear that we have now literally created the Petri dish that we all

01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:19.740
worried about and both of those viruses are sitting in there at the same time.

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:24.740
See, they use the illusions. They use the cartoons that they want you to see.

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:25.740
One of them.

01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:31.740
They have foist a model of reality on you that because of the urgency and because of their

01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:37.740
agreed consensus on what questions are important to ask, we accept the model.

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:41.740
And that model is what they want us to pass on to our children.

01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:42.740
Holy mess.

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:44.740
Risks. We face.

01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:46.740
This is an issue of human lives.

01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:50.740
It should be thought of in the same way that we think of terrorism protection against

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.740
national disasters against national defense.

01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:59.740
This is a human security issue and it is also an economic security issue.

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:02.740
The outbreak of SARS could trigger a global downturn.

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:06.740
Fear of the SARS virus has caused serious financial damage to businesses and cities,

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.740
even in entire countries.

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.740
During the Haida SARS, nobody was going to restaurants.

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:11.740
People didn't want to go shopping.

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:15.740
At one point at the peak of the SARS crisis, a travel in Hong Kong was done by 80%

01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:17.740
and retail sales were done by 50%.

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.740
Businesses can run out of money.

01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:24.740
Estimates of the impact SARS have been an economic impact of around 40 billion or so.

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:31.740
If a global pandemic took place, you're looking at an economic impact measured in the trillions of dollars.

01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:35.740
2017, ladies and gentlemen, CNN Productions.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:38.740
Not tens or hundreds of billions.

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.740
It has such a big impact on business and life.

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:53.740
You hope the world has the capacity to see an outbreak mobilize forces and contain it, right?

01:54:53.740 --> 01:55:00.740
Unfortunately, we rarely do that, especially if the outbreak occurs in a poor country.

01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:03.740
Well, here we are in Liberia.

01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:04.740
That's Sierra Leone.

01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.740
And this is the border crossing.

01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:07.740
Do you see security?

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.740
Do you see any military?

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.740
Do you see anything that would stop someone from coming across this border?

01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:18.740
And then it not only spreads beyond the borders of the original country has occurred with Ebola in West Africa,

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:24.740
but it crosses seas, it crosses continents, and that constitutes a pandemic.

01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.740
It's funny because Denny Rancore has lots of evidence that COVID couldn't really cross borders,

01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.740
even if they were wide open like that.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:35.740
Endemic is your worst case scenario.

01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:40.740
So you failed to control the outbreak, and that constitutes a pandemic.

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:43.740
Endemic is your worst case scenario.

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:46.740
So you failed to control the outbreak.

01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:49.740
Endemic is your worst case scenario.

01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:53.740
I didn't think I was going to find this kind of gold here.

01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:56.740
And believe it or not, endemic is the word.

01:55:56.740 --> 01:55:59.740
You don't understand what kind of clip is being made here.

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.740
Are you ready?

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.740
Because this is, this is, this is crazy.

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.740
Because what is the fear and of endemicity?

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:12.740
But it crosses seas, it crosses continents, and that constitutes a pandemic.

01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.740
Endemic is your worst case scenario.

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:23.740
So what she's saying here is exactly the yin and yang of what Brett Weinstein said for the first two years of the pandemic.

01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:24.740
What did he say?

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.740
That we need to still understand that zero COVID is possible.

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:38.740
That was the whole argument for the masks, for the lockdown, for the justification of it because we could still get to zero COVID.

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.740
That was the justification for using Ivermectin because it was 100% prophylactic.

01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:52.740
So if we had two vaccinated people and a person who was prophylactically protected, we didn't need to wear masks, but we could still get to zero COVID.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:54.740
Do you see?

01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:01.740
And in 2017, she was already laying down the model of reality where a virus can break.

01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:11.740
But if we respond quick enough, like we do with Ebola, then it won't spread and pandemic avoided.

01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:37.740
And so this narrative of pandemic control, epidemic control near misses and pandemic potential has been repeatedly built up from Ebola through Zika, through SARS, with ever increasing implications for what happens if the next one gets under the door.

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:45.740
And Demicity is the worst case scenario.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:58:04.740
That is the worst case scenario that team leader Brett Weinstein was advocating vigorously to avoid by using the phrase zero COVID is a goal for a very long time.

01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:10.740
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:16.740
You failed to control the outbreak. You failed to control the epidemic and you failed to control the pandemic.

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:24.740
And now that micro is a permanent feature in the biological landscape that humans are living in.

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:36.740
So your behavior determines the outcome. If we would just cooperate, if we would just follow public health directives, this kind of thing could be avoided, but there is a danger.

01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:46.740
There is a danger. If we don't follow public health directives, there is a danger that a virus will become endemic.

01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.740
And then what?

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.740
Well, that's the worst case scenario.

01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:54.740
First example of that is HIV.

01:58:54.740 --> 01:59:02.740
We started off with tiny outbreaks in a handful of places and the world responded completely incorrectly.

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:12.740
It became pandemic and now endemic. So we have 37 million people living infected with HIV and there is no country on the planet without this virus.

01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:16.740
Before the devastation of AIDS, we could have avoided smallpox.

01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.740
Smallpox killed 500 million people in the 20th century alone.

01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:25.740
More than all the wars in that century combined.

01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:33.740
Whenever an infectious disease truly catches hold, it forces health workers to make impossible choices about the public's freedom and rights.

01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.740
I was the youngest person in the smallpox team.

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:44.740
And I was certainly the only person in the history of the United Nations recruited from the name Corioli Baba Ashram.

01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:55.740
We had eradicated smallpox in much of British. It was a big state in the middle of India.

01:59:55.740 --> 02:00:01.740
And we were about to do our victory dance and then suddenly, across the border, we started getting new outbreaks.

02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:04.740
And they all came from one place, a place called Tathanabir.

02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.740
First place we went to was the railway station.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.740
And it was a scene from the worst nightmare you ever had in your life.

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:18.740
There were dozens of people stretched out near the tracks in the waiting room on the cement dead from smallpox.

02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:21.740
It smelled from the...yeah.

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.740
The Tathanagar was the home of the Tathan iron and steel company.

02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.740
So I just went to the company's house. It was almost midnight when I got there.

02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:35.740
I said, I need cheaps. I need managers. I need doctors. I need vaccines.

02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:40.740
The next day I had 100 cheaps. We set up training programs.

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:45.740
We used maps to develop a strategy and we took the 100 cheaps and we built our little army.

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.740
We were doing great in 2000 cases of smallpox.

02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:57.740
We were stopping the disease in Tathanagar, but still, as we're vaccinating everybody, the trains were carrying people away.

02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.740
We're still exporting smallpox.

02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:01.740
We closed the railway station.

02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:05.740
Did you see how they were doing it? That's variation.

02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:13.740
That's technically speaking, not intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system.

02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:18.740
That was inoculating the skin, which is called variolation.

02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:24.740
It's interesting, right? Interesting, very interesting that that's in the video, but they don't say it.

02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:31.740
Close the buses. We quarantined the city of 600,000 people. Nobody could leave the city unless they were vaccinated.

02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:38.740
Of course, Larry is leaving a tail in that entire area around Tathanagar in less than six months.

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.740
Chief mythologist without a doubt.

02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:48.740
Coming back, we traced it to a tribal group called the Ho Tribe.

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:53.740
So I went and visited the members of that tribe and I said, well, you've got to take smallpox vaccine.

02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:55.740
You've got to stop this transmission.

02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:59.740
And he said, I won't take it. I do whatever God's will is.

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:03.740
If I'm to get smallpox, I'll get it.

02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:06.740
After a while, more cases kept coming out from the Ho community.

02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:13.740
And we all agreed that we were going to have to forcibly vaccinate these Ho tribesmen.

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:26.740
In the middle of the night, we went out into the villages, into the jungle, and we surrounded them and pulled them out of their houses and vaccinated them.

02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:32.740
And then after we had broken into their house, pulled them out of bed, forcibly vaccinated them.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:42.740
This dignified tribal elder looked at me and reached over to the vine, and there was one fruit, a cucumber, a kind of gourd.

02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:47.740
He pulled it off, and he cut it, and he put it on a leaf, and he offered it to us to eat.

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:53.740
He said, I don't like what you did. I think you're wrong. But that's over now.

02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:56.740
Now I see that you are a guest in my house.

02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:58.740
The only thing I have to offer is this cucumber.

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.740
And so you ask yourself, were we right?

02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:10.740
We did a lot of things that, in their individual...

02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:17.740
Did he report the absolute drop off of smallpox? Did no one else die?

02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:22.740
I mean, that's the story he's implying, but he didn't say it yet.

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:30.740
Keep that in mind. Did this forest vaccination campaign result in a complete eradication of smallpox?

02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:32.740
Or did people keep dying for a while?

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:39.740
Listen, if I put the harshest light of truth on it right now, I would be begging to find an alternative way to do it.

02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:43.740
And I asked myself, did I exaggerate the importance of what I did?

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:52.740
Did I place myself above some kind of moral compass? Did I quit too early trying to find a way to accomplish the same thing?

02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:58.740
But that's sort of between me and God and me and my conscience.

02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:03.740
Smallpox has been eradicated, and I'm thrilled about that.

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:11.740
Ooh, it's hard for me to take that seriously. Wow. Ooh, geez.

02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:23.740
The only disease ever eradicated, is that what it said? Sorry, I'm going to go back.

02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:28.740
The idea... Oh, no, smallpox.

02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:45.740
The idea of night raids or forcible vaccination today is just unthinkable.

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.740
There's a few big things that are very different.

02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:54.740
Internal politics, global politics, extremism, the whole issue of human rights, you have to be transparent,

02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:59.740
because the wrong information can actually contribute to the spread of a disease.

02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:00.740
Oh, boy.

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.740
I'm particularly interested in that.

02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:04.740
The wrong information can contribute to the spread.

02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:07.740
The way that rumors replicate and spread are very similar to how viruses spread.

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:15.740
They need a host to them, because the wrong information can actually contribute to the spread of a disease.

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:18.740
I'm particularly interested in looking at rumors.

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.740
Rumors?

02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:21.740
Rumors replicate and spread...

02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:28.740
Rumors replicate and spread are very similar to how viruses spread.

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:32.740
Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Wow!

02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:35.740
That is some rich stuff right there.

02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:40.740
To be transparent, because the wrong information can actually contribute to the spread of the disease.

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:44.740
I'm particularly interested in looking at rumors.

02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:49.740
The way that rumors replicate and spread are very similar to how viruses spread.

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:53.740
They need a host, they need to be supported to stay alive and thrive.

02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:54.740
Oh, there we go.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:56.740
Okay, hi.

02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:01.740
Rumors have been around since Man Existed, but I think right now what's changed with technology,

02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:05.740
particularly social media and the internet, is the global spread and the speed.

02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:09.740
I mean, look at Twitter. You need 140 characters or something.

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:14.740
And that's all you need to spread some of the rumors and perceptions that we're certainly tracking.

02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:21.740
And one of the things we found is that rumors thrive.

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.740
There's Alex Jones.

02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:28.740
Not for nothing that Alex Jones is there. That's not by accident.

02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:32.740
CNN is promoting Alex Jones in a movie.

02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:35.740
Really?

02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:41.740
Genetically modified, lab made virus in 2017. That sounds crazy.

02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.740
See it now?

02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:50.740
And one of the things we found is that rumors thrive in times of uncertainty.

02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:55.740
They thrive in times where people need an answer or eager for an answer.

02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:01.740
The old model of how you respond to an infectious disease outbreak is you issue some sort of, you know,

02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:04.740
firm warning to the public and tell them what they shouldn't do.

02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:10.740
That doesn't work anymore because people are responding to rumors on Twitter or Facebook

02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:16.740
and they want to engage and they want to challenge and they want to have their own opinions about what's going on.

02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:29.740
When an epidemic occurs, there is a clinical management, but it's also the reactions of society.

02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:35.740
And managing that can be as important as actually dealing with the epidemic itself.

02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:37.740
Okay, good afternoon everybody.

02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:40.740
This is the third meeting of our Task Force on Ebola.

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:44.740
And then John, would you like to give an update because where we are with the epidemic?

02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:47.740
I'm very worried and to be honest.

02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:51.740
President Ellen Johnson-Salith likened the outbreak to a war.

02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:54.740
Cases in death continue to surge, riots are breaking out.

02:07:54.740 --> 02:08:00.740
As Ebola continued to spread across West Africa, the government's implemented massive quarantines.

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:02.740
Distrust exploded.

02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:05.740
Security forces locked roads with scrap wood and parked wire.

02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:10.740
We were forced open in isolation, war hundreds clashed with the police who fired light rounds and teared us.

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:18.740
Liberia has tried, we've used our own resources, but obviously we have limitations and we hope that the international communities see this,

02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:20.740
and so the international catastrophe.

02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:24.740
Two Americans who have been infected will be set home for care in Atlanta.

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.740
The opposite people in this debate, the few individuals, before they saw that last time.

02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:31.740
It became infected whilst working as a nurse in East DC, I really am.

02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:34.740
The news photographer for NBC just diagnosed with Ebola.

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:38.740
Much like the other Americans before him, he will be flown back to the United States for treatment.

02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.740
That's him?

02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.740
If that was real, right? Think about that.

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:45.740
Think about how crazy that is.

02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:52.740
That somebody who's sick would be flown back to the United States with a disease that could potentially kill billions.

02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:57.740
For that reporter, it's so important that they come home.

02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:01.740
They couldn't go to a local hospital or they couldn't fly the medicine there.

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:05.740
Think about the incongruence of that.

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:07.740
What does that even mean?

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:14.740
I thought that their whole model of this was they were looking down from that bridge and they were saying,

02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:20.740
Look, they're just the problem is those people are just swimming in the parts of those birds.

02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:22.740
And so there's just virus everywhere.

02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:24.740
And then they went down there with no mask.

02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:26.740
This is the same thing.

02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:31.740
These people got infected with something that could potentially kill a city.

02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:33.740
And so they flew him home.

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:34.740
What?

02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:35.740
Right?

02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:36.740
No, he's from the States.

02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:37.740
Oh, he's here.

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:39.740
Oh, he's in there.

02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:41.740
Oh, my God.

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:49.740
In a repeating pattern, the world only really started to pay attention to the Ebola epidemic when foreign workers began to fall sick.

02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:51.740
The international response is continuing to ramp up.

02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:55.740
We're going to create an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa.

02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:59.740
Fast food, a billion euros across Europe will be galvanized.

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.740
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to join in extending health care professionals.

02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:07.740
We're going to continue to come to the Ebola epidemic when foreign workers began to fall sick.

02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:09.740
There are 84 flights a week leaving these affected countries.

02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:12.740
First time the Ebola virus is in the United States.

02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:15.740
It's almost done to them contracted Ebola in Liberia before flying to Dallas, Texas.

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:17.740
He's flying on his exit floor so he could leave Liberia.

02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.740
Why not just shut down the flights and secure the border?

02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:20.740
The travel ban may make sense.

02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:22.740
We should not be allowing these folks in.

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:32.740
As of today, one case came from Liberia.

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.740
One.

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740
I'll be more.

02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:36.740
Still riding in the car with this guy.

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.740
They say, let's close the borders.

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.740
Nobody from Africa will be allowed in.

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:43.740
They don't even know they're Western.

02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:45.740
The Eastern South Africa is.

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:48.740
Nobody from Africa should be allowed in and close our airports.

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:58.740
I mean, that's a combination of ignorance and arrogance that could create ruination for our economic system, our financial system.

02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:02.740
We're laying down the narrative of what could happen.

02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:05.740
The worst case scenario is our entire economy collapse.

02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:11.740
And who would want that to happen?

02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:14.740
Who would be in a position to take advantage of that?

02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:21.740
Now, I'm going to end this video here because it is two hours in.

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:27.740
I want to see if peer tube does it and there's about 50, 30 minutes left.

02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:35.740
So I'll watch this either later tonight or I'll see what's in here and maybe just get some highlights out of it.

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:39.740
Thank you very much for joining me this afternoon for this throwback Wednesday.

02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:48.740
I do want to make sure that I give a shout out to the Broken Science Initiative one more time.

02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:52.740
This current slide here, this was a way back Wednesday.

02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:56.740
We went back to a CNN movie from 2017.

02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:58.740
We watched the first hour of it.

02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:12.740
And I think it was a pretty good insight into how this potential, pandemic potential has been laid out as a narrative and slowly built in its potential from Ebola to Zika to SARS to Mares.

02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:14.740
They ramped it up behind the scenes.

02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:15.740
They ramped it up on TV.

02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.740
They ramped it up on social media.

02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:19.740
They ramped it up in bureaucracies.

02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:21.740
They ramped it up with NGOs.

02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:26.740
And this has been a building narrative that everybody has agreed has got to be true.

02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:37.740
And that illusion of consensus has now been exponentially ramped up with regard to the response to this SARS-CoV-2 and COVID fiasco.

02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:38.740
That's where we are.

02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.740
That's what I really think is happening.

02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:47.740
And I think we are starting to really shed light on it by realizing what models these people are giving us of the real world.

02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:59.740
And then if you just use your imagination, use what you know, use the biology that we know to try and use that model to predict something, a measurement, an observation in the future.

02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:06.740
You're going to find that most of the models that have been foisted on us are absolutely ridiculous and can't be verified with prediction.

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.740
And in fact, we saw that in this video.

02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:17.740
People standing over complaining about how much of virus was down there and how the bird flu could kill 50% of everybody that gets infected.

02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:23.740
And then they went down there with shorts and short sleeves and no masks on.

02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:26.740
So what story are they telling themselves?

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:36.740
If the Ebola people that get infected get flown home to their home countries, how serious are they really taking this pathogen?

02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:47.740
It's incongruency, ladies and gentlemen, and it shows that the model of infectious disease that they've been foisting on us, they don't even believe it themselves.

02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:58.740
They're just so inept that they don't realize how their daily lives are just one big contradiction, but I think we can break that illusion.

02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:00.740
I'm really excited about it.

02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:11.740
The illusion of there being a badcave virus, you know, the illusion that there are petri dishes that we need to be afraid of.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:18.740
Illusions that there are mouse colonies that are humanized and therefore super dangerous.

02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:25.740
The molecular biologist like Ralph Barrett might stitch something together that could kill a billion people.

02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:32.740
This is the worst case scenario. The illusion of consensus is about that and we cannot pass this mythology on to our children.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:34.740
Thank you very much. I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:46.740
Thank you.
