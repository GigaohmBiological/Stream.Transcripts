WEBVTT

00:12.997 --> 00:15.098
Testing 1-2, I am a little bit late.

00:19.060 --> 00:25.242
Testing, test, test, testing, testing.

00:25.302 --> 00:25.802
That's better.

00:27.503 --> 00:29.124
Testing 1-2, test.

00:35.366 --> 00:36.286
Good to see everybody.

00:36.987 --> 00:39.868
As usual, left-hand monkey wrench pulling in first.

00:43.844 --> 01:08.782
Wanted to start the stream today with a little bit of an immediate an immediate segment first segment here Let me just pop in here and let me see if I can do This yes I finished reading this book the other day And it's an interesting book the book is from I

01:14.068 --> 01:14.769
It is from 1968.

01:15.770 --> 01:23.437
The first printing was in May 1968 and there have been 13 printings before 1970 apparently.

01:26.500 --> 01:38.392
It's an interesting book because one of the contentions that myself and others in my immediate circle have been making is this is about more than money.

01:39.226 --> 01:43.550
This is about more than pharmaceutical profits.

01:43.990 --> 01:46.332
This is about something much bigger than that.

01:47.533 --> 02:06.349
A second, third order human genome project kind of thing might be part of it, but just a total governance of the world by a sort of network of thought control, a network of preconceived notions, a network of theaters that

02:06.989 --> 02:12.314
that essentially can govern people because they have defaulted to that.

02:13.655 --> 02:18.099
We have accepted social media, and by accepting social media we are using it now.

02:18.219 --> 02:32.291
So instead of getting our news from cable TV, which might have been bad, we are now getting our news from social media, which can be tailored to show each of us a different image of reality.

02:32.351 --> 02:34.173
And that means that essentially with

02:34.893 --> 02:46.462
the proper tuning and training, it is possible that that these basic programs could see patterns in behavior and human behavior that could be weaponized against us.

02:46.502 --> 02:48.603
And these patterns won't be very complex.

02:51.525 --> 02:57.310
And so this idea of what is it really is it all for all the marbles, what does that really mean?

02:57.330 --> 03:03.074
And I feel like I've often not backed my statement up with with

03:05.390 --> 03:07.191
Well, recently gained knowledge.

03:07.352 --> 03:15.538
I mean, I've had this notion in my head for a while as somebody who understood that 9-11 wasn't what they told us it was.

03:17.880 --> 03:31.471
But I think taking it seriously now for the last five years as the state of the world, taking it as seriously as a heart attack, I've been reading a lot.

03:32.172 --> 03:34.494
Because as I said on my bike a long time ago,

03:36.814 --> 03:37.915
That's about all I can do.

03:38.095 --> 03:40.817
I mean, I love biology and I can read stuff.

03:41.738 --> 03:46.482
So I'm gonna put on a pair of readers and I'm gonna read you chapter 3.

03:47.887 --> 03:50.750
of this book because I think it's pretty relevant.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.492
Oh, these are dirty, but I don't want to waste time cleaning them right now.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.595
So I should be able to just slide this over here.

03:56.675 --> 03:57.115
Yes.

03:57.335 --> 03:58.316
This is chapter three.

03:58.356 --> 03:59.237
What is being done?

03:59.257 --> 04:08.666
Um, I think this is interesting, uh, because I want you to again, take, take this from the idea that

04:12.333 --> 04:33.530
at these tables, at these dinners, at these campouts, at the Bohemian Grove, at Bilderberg group meetings, at all of these places, the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, they have all talked about the management of the population problem.

04:34.310 --> 04:49.276
and talked about it in a way that I don't think that many young kids are really used to thinking about it or hearing people think about it and certainly a lot of us even aren't really aware of how it was talked about in the 50s and in the 40s and in the 30s.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.116
It was a, I mean,

04:53.874 --> 05:00.036
This is describing what is not being done about the population bomb.

05:00.136 --> 05:03.017
Remember, that's the name of this book, The Population Bomb.

05:03.057 --> 05:06.538
And the idea is that only kids are dying of starvation.

05:09.999 --> 05:22.263
The idea is that we're spending all of our time on mid-age diseases, and we don't care anything about kids, and the population is exploding, and we're running out of

05:23.672 --> 05:32.413
So it's a really, really dark narrative about the Earth being overrun by people if we don't do something about it.

05:34.226 --> 05:36.107
So the ship has hit the rocks and is sinking.

05:36.808 --> 05:38.328
The passengers scream for help.

05:38.369 --> 05:41.330
Some jump overboard and are devoured by circling sharks.

05:41.450 --> 05:44.192
A group of distinguished scientists is on board.

05:44.272 --> 05:46.774
One of their numbers suggests that they go help man the pumps.

05:46.934 --> 05:47.954
Oh no, shout the others.

05:48.475 --> 05:49.875
That might hurt the captain's feelings.

05:49.935 --> 05:51.436
Besides, pumping is not our business.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.177
It's outside of our field of competence.

05:53.398 --> 05:55.159
Well, that's an interesting...

05:55.959 --> 05:57.560
you can guess what they do.

05:57.620 --> 06:11.488
They appoint a committee to study the problem, the subcommittees on marine engineering and navigation, they announce that the passengers that in two or three years the committee will produce a wonderful report which will be acceptable to the passengers, the captain, and the streamline ship.

06:12.358 --> 06:27.680
stream steamship line not so passive are the politicians some jump up to say that the passengers don't understand the political realities of the situation you know like the 5d chess others more progressive politicians

06:28.721 --> 06:29.922
Sorry, I can't read this morning.

06:30.663 --> 06:33.605
What I decided to do is read the screen and then I don't really need these.

06:34.205 --> 06:41.931
Other more progressive politicians grab thimbles and start bailing, stopping every few seconds to accept praise for their valiant efforts.

06:42.392 --> 06:49.497
That about sums up the situation on the population control front in the United States and the rest of the world.

06:50.418 --> 06:56.963
People in positions of power have either ignored the problem or have recommended solutions that are inadequate in scope or proven failures.

06:57.694 --> 07:00.916
The Catholic Church recommends the rhythm method of contraception.

07:01.416 --> 07:05.898
Unfortunately, people who practice this method of contraception are commonly called parents.

07:06.858 --> 07:16.003
Even under the most carefully controlled conditions, women using this technique run a 15% risk of pregnancy each year they use it.

07:17.598 --> 07:19.358
With the pill, comparable rates are less than 1%.

07:19.478 --> 07:21.539
Of course, there's no downsides to the pill.

07:22.159 --> 07:26.400
Of course, under normal conditions, the failure rate is much higher, about 25%.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.560
In short, the rhythm method doesn't work.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.181
The irrelevant description of it as a Vatican roulette is, alas, accurate.

07:34.761 --> 07:40.362
As Vatican roulette is to family planning, so family planning is to population control.

07:40.823 --> 07:42.723
Family planning doesn't work either.

07:43.928 --> 07:45.732
So that's another interesting thing.

07:45.772 --> 07:47.856
I don't know where my phone is, but I can hear it making noise.

07:48.561 --> 07:49.442
I should probably find it.

07:50.362 --> 07:59.690
The failure of family planning in the field of population control is brilliantly outlined by Kinsey Davis, Kingsley Davis, in a recent article in the magazine Science.

07:59.710 --> 08:06.855
He points out that things that make family planning acceptable are the very things that make it ineffective for population control.

08:07.336 --> 08:16.303
By stressing the right of parents to have the number of children they want, it evades the basic question of population policy, which is how to give societies the number of children they need.

08:17.222 --> 08:24.707
By offering only the means of couples to control fertility, it neglects the means for society to do so.

08:25.088 --> 08:33.314
Or, as Justin Blackwell once said, family planning means, among other things, that if we're going to multiply like rabbits, we should do it on purpose.

08:34.254 --> 08:36.396
One couple may plan to have three children.

08:36.456 --> 08:38.017
Another couple may plan seven.

08:38.437 --> 08:42.861
In both cases, they are a cause of the population problem, not a solution to it.

08:44.221 --> 08:57.047
Above all, remember that planned, well-spaced children will starve or vaporize in a thermonuclear war or die of plague just as well as unplanned children.

08:57.747 --> 09:00.669
This book was so awesome, I couldn't hardly put it down.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.890
Like, I started reading it and I ate it up like a sandwich.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.271
It's hilarious.

09:06.044 --> 09:12.049
The story in the UDCs, that's, I think, I want to read that last one again.

09:12.069 --> 09:18.915
Or as Justin Blackwelder once said, family planning means, among other things, that if we're going to

09:19.662 --> 09:21.502
We are going to multiply like rabbits.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.823
We should do it on purpose.

09:23.523 --> 09:26.363
One couple may plan to have three children.

09:26.463 --> 09:28.364
Another couple may plan seven.

09:28.784 --> 09:33.865
In both cases, they are a cause of the population problem, not a solution to it.

09:34.425 --> 09:46.227
Above all, remember that planned, well-spaced children will starve or vaporize in a thermonuclear war or die of a plague just as well as unplanned children.

09:49.008 --> 09:49.749
This is a great book.

09:50.229 --> 09:53.332
The story in the UDCs is depressingly same everywhere.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.753
People want large families.

09:54.793 --> 09:57.796
They want families of a size that will keep the population growing.

09:58.437 --> 10:03.522
Family planning is all too often used to lock the barn door after the horse is stolen.

10:04.102 --> 10:12.406
Davis reports that among 5,196 women seeking assistance in rural Punjab, India, two-thirds were over 30.

10:12.506 --> 10:19.050
Since many were married before they were 15, it is hardly surprising that more than half of them already had six or more children.

10:19.810 --> 10:31.855
Similarly, the president of Hong Kong Family Planning Association pointed out that at least in the early years of their program, the patients who received assistance were usually about 31 years of age and had six children.

10:32.575 --> 10:43.100
It is important to remember that even if a woman in the UDCs had actually the number of children they wanted, the results would still be demographic catastrophe.

10:43.820 --> 10:48.242
See, they describe it very clearly in this book over and over and over again.

10:49.226 --> 10:54.651
that we are gonna have a demographic catastrophe if we don't stop having this many kids.

10:55.412 --> 11:02.259
Family planning is important from the point of view of health and welfare of individuals, but it does not control population.

11:03.099 --> 11:03.920
Is that where it stopped?

11:03.980 --> 11:05.882
Yeah, populations, period, yes.

11:06.923 --> 11:08.184
I think it gets a little better yet.

11:10.154 --> 11:13.456
I think UDCs is underdeveloped countries in case you didn't catch on to that.

11:13.936 --> 11:18.118
The current birth control programs in the underdeveloped countries have their base in family planning.

11:18.158 --> 11:21.280
Their goals are expressed in almost all cases in lowered birth rates.

11:22.421 --> 11:28.444
Pakistan aims to reduce its birth rate from 50 to 40 per thousand in 1970.

11:29.144 --> 11:31.105
India aims, there's my phone.

11:31.145 --> 11:31.966
Thank you very much.

11:32.286 --> 11:33.046
Thank you very much.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.948
Can't see who's giving me the, thank you very much.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.720
But remember the critical thing is the balance between birth and death rates.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.987
With death rates around 10 to 20, I guess that's percent, it is clear

11:50.880 --> 11:52.241
10 to 20 per thousand probably.

11:52.561 --> 11:57.903
It is clear that even achieving these goals could not by any stretch of the imagination be called population control.

11:57.923 --> 12:02.886
People would still be multiplying like rabbits and the population doubling every 30 to 40 years.

12:02.946 --> 12:10.649
So they use this laboratory animal analogy all the time, multiplying by rabbits.

12:10.689 --> 12:15.792
Let's take a look at family planning in India, a country whose government has been more than a decade ahead of ours.

12:17.429 --> 12:22.793
in recognizing that population size is a matter for governmental concern and action.

12:23.513 --> 12:27.716
The Indian government has had an official birth control program since 1951.

12:28.096 --> 12:28.616
Interesting.

12:29.277 --> 12:40.364
In the early years of their program, they did a lot of experimenting with the rhythm method, although millions of Catholic couples could have given them the word on its efficiency, but recently they've gotten down to business.

12:41.044 --> 12:47.228
When I was in Delhi in 1966, posters said that use loop for family planning were much in evidence.

12:47.288 --> 12:53.953
The kind of loop, of course, refers to different kinds of plastic devices which are inserted into the womb to prevent conception.

12:54.573 --> 13:04.340
These inner uterine devices, IUDs, not to be confused with UDCs, are one of the main tools of family planning in India.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.823
Others are the simple and harmless marrow sterilization operation, the vasectomy,

13:09.583 --> 13:11.744
and the distribution of rubber sheaths.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.266
I guess they didn't use condoms as a word back then.

13:15.707 --> 13:24.852
In early 1968, Joseph Lieveld reported that only a small number of Indians, 335 districts, had on hand a complete task force for birth control.

13:25.922 --> 13:33.128
And one of the few districts is Karya, an area in which each family village has assigned to it a family planning worker.

13:33.168 --> 13:38.893
But after having active family planning workers in the district for eight years, the birth rate is higher than the national average.

13:38.993 --> 13:39.754
Nice work.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.556
I wanted to, there was something else in here.

13:42.596 --> 13:47.481
I just want to screw through the, move the Indian women, India.

13:48.072 --> 13:49.413
What about vasectomies?

13:51.634 --> 13:57.217
Recently, there was talk in India of compulsory sterilization for all males who are fathers of three or more children.

13:57.777 --> 13:59.618
See, India is way ahead on this stuff.

13:59.678 --> 14:00.538
That's kind of cool.

14:03.442 --> 14:11.564
They might make a good partner if, you know, if you wanted to pull off an operation where you were going to try and, you know, get some population control in a place where there is none.

14:12.164 --> 14:16.285
Can you imagine the pick-a-bob attempt to sterilize 40 million males?

14:16.385 --> 14:17.905
What the hell is he talking about?

14:19.005 --> 14:23.706
Can you picture the probable results of a government attempt to sterilize 40 million males?

14:24.226 --> 14:32.328
What a problem it would be in our country with its relatively informed populace and efficient transport and communication system.

14:34.124 --> 14:34.424
Huh?

14:35.945 --> 14:42.969
Imagine such an attempt in India where the difference between castration and sterilization would almost be impossible to explain.

14:43.629 --> 14:53.415
As one might expect, the principal Indian official thinking in such tough-minded terms has recently ended up in a less influential position in a government shuffle.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.863
So they have a big problem because Hindu people say it's a sin to prevent children from being born.

15:06.324 --> 15:08.185
Oh boy, they have a problem in India then.

15:10.803 --> 15:32.706
Anyway, I'm gonna let you get a copy of this book and read it because it's really good I wanted to see there's Japan and that's what I wanted to see it is often quoted the off-quote examples of Taiwan and Korea are countries undergoing a Demographic transition where the whole of family planning programs was at most very small furthermore their growth rates have been slowed not brought to zero and

15:33.499 --> 15:38.043
Japan lowered its growth rate dramatically, but not through conventional family planning.

15:38.103 --> 15:47.691
A modern industrialized nation with a highly efficient agriculture, Japan was faced after World War II with a series of cramped islands with no opportunity to expand.

15:48.252 --> 15:53.376
Both government and industry in Japan supported the program of population control.

15:54.637 --> 16:00.763
Its dramatic halving of the birth rate was achieved originally through sanctioning of abortion.

16:01.977 --> 16:06.701
Abortion is a highly effective weapon in the armory of population control.

16:07.341 --> 16:13.787
It is condemned by many family planning groups which are notorious for pussyfooting around about methab...

16:16.661 --> 16:26.311
which are notorious for puss of footing about methodology, despite their beginning 60 years ago as revolutionary social pioneers.

16:26.451 --> 16:30.035
The United Nations, for instance, does not include abortion in family planning.

16:30.075 --> 16:34.880
Quite the contrary, UN justifies family planning as a method of combating abortion.

16:36.092 --> 16:45.015
Recently, Japan's industry, feeling the competition from other Asian countries with cheap labor pools, has withdrawn its support from the population control picture.

16:45.735 --> 16:47.976
Japan's growth rate is now rising again.

16:48.096 --> 16:54.539
At any rate, the situation in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan are in no way equivalent to those in underdeveloped countries.

16:54.619 --> 17:02.682
We would be foolish in the extreme to count on similar sequences of events taking place in other parts of Asia, Africa, or Latin America.

17:03.302 --> 17:03.662
Here we go.

17:04.747 --> 17:09.171
What is the government of the United States doing in the area of population control?

17:09.471 --> 17:14.476
It is bailing the sinking ship with a very small and leaky thimble.

17:15.537 --> 17:19.661
Six federal agencies are involved in one way or another with family planning.

17:23.584 --> 17:31.887
It would be interesting to trace what these agencies have become, because the Department of Health and Education and Welfare, I guess, got split up.

17:32.588 --> 17:40.251
Office of Economic Opportunity, National Science Foundation we know of, Department of Interior, Department of State, and the agency fellows that we all know of.

17:40.871 --> 17:44.513
Agency for International Development maybe became USAID, I don't know.

17:45.113 --> 17:50.516
The total spent by the agencies in 1967 for birth control and family planning activities was $33 million.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.356
$18 million by those, 9, 5, 1.

17:54.983 --> 18:00.424
These expenditures may seem impressive, but they can be put into perspective easily.

18:00.544 --> 18:11.647
For 1968, the entire proposed budget of the health, education, and welfare is about $13.2 billion, and the birth control planning part is less than one quarter of 1%.

18:13.207 --> 18:19.269
Again, the population budget of all the agencies would not buy more than a dozen sophisticated military jets.

18:19.869 --> 18:24.290
It's roughly the same amount as the government appropriation for rat control.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.968
Listen to the language here.

18:28.228 --> 18:32.930
Listen to the way that these people think about the problem, the severity of the issue.

18:33.730 --> 18:36.752
They really want you to see that there's only one choice.

18:36.812 --> 18:38.432
We gotta stop this.

18:40.133 --> 18:46.576
So it's less than a drop in the bucket, not even a good micro drop since so much of it is frittered away in family planning.

18:46.676 --> 18:49.717
Little is done on population control on a world scale.

18:51.636 --> 18:55.608
Here's what Senator Gruning from Alaska had to say before the Senate, May 3rd, 1967.

18:58.433 --> 19:09.479
At my request, Executive Agency spokesman reported to the Government Operations Subcommittee on Financial Foreign Aid Expenditures concerning their activities and efforts to implement President Johnson's mandate.

19:09.499 --> 19:21.706
Their reports were disappointing and in no respect implemented President Johnson's mandate for new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world resources.

19:22.611 --> 19:30.004
They revealed that progress in implementing any programs was painfully slow, and that existing programs were inadequately funded and staffed.

19:30.565 --> 19:32.809
For example, the subcommittee found that even

19:34.008 --> 19:42.673
that while 1,100 persons in the Agency for International Development worked on food problems, no more than 11 worked on population problems.

19:42.693 --> 19:45.134
Nevertheless, there has been some slight progress.

19:57.827 --> 19:59.749
And so you can see what this book is all about.

19:59.769 --> 20:06.516
This is just a, you know, they're talking about organ transplants and harvesting, you know, there's not enough organ transplants.

20:06.576 --> 20:10.200
It might become history unless action is taken on the population front soon.

20:10.641 --> 20:14.044
Human organ transplants will become a historical curiosity.

20:15.446 --> 20:16.347
This book's crazy.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.507
They've been thinking like this for a really, really long time.

20:21.567 --> 20:25.249
Their excuse is that this is a crisis that needs averting.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.730
The crisis, of course, is the population problem.

20:28.770 --> 20:34.913
The crisis is this thing that they made up this mythology about endemicity in order to manage.

20:37.194 --> 20:41.715
They rolled out fake tests or useless tests.

20:41.955 --> 20:44.937
They rolled out a lot of placebo.

20:46.189 --> 20:48.871
not a lot of transfections but a lot of placebo.

20:48.911 --> 21:03.178
That's how they made the manufacturing quota and the entire illusion is still sustained on all sides because they're still finding their ghosts with their tests and we're still playing Ghostbuster like that.

21:03.919 --> 21:05.960
All the people on our side are still playing

21:06.938 --> 21:09.640
Ghostbuster just like they did in 2020.

21:10.461 --> 21:16.645
And you got to wake up and see it or our children will be enslaved by them and their show.

21:18.891 --> 21:19.791
Not doing very well here.

21:19.831 --> 21:21.072
There's crap on the table.

21:21.132 --> 21:21.872
I don't know what's going on.

21:21.892 --> 21:22.972
There's sand on the table.

21:23.393 --> 21:33.356
So there was like a background signal of irreducible complexity that's there every day, everywhere, that they want you to ignore and believe that their test finds something.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.097
And in reality, it is as simple as this cartoon.

21:36.777 --> 21:45.500
If the background is represented as black, and you don't know what that background is, and then they tell you, oh, we found something.

21:46.658 --> 21:49.439
and it's that black thing, but they tell you it's the red thing.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.182
And the red thing has a fear and cleavage site, and the red thing has HIV inserts.

21:54.222 --> 21:57.383
The red thing is the most infectious thing ever.

21:58.524 --> 22:00.464
And then they start tracking it all around.

22:00.604 --> 22:10.049
All they did was, in this cartoon, change what was black to red, and it's only changed to red because you chose to use their tests.

22:11.092 --> 22:16.997
And the thing about it is, is this was timed perfectly with a biological phenomenon that they all knew was coming.

22:17.838 --> 22:26.985
They've looked at this chart, the population pyramid of every country in the West, every country in Africa, they're watching this all the time.

22:28.206 --> 22:37.814
Because if we have just enough hospital beds in America to serve this population from top to bottom,

22:38.905 --> 22:56.828
then when this little bump here ages out and shifts from being a very good, high tax paying group of individuals to a very sick, very lazy, very low tax paying, drawing down type population,

22:57.549 --> 23:14.500
the economics, the socioeconomic structure of America will change quite drastically, especially if these younger adults aren't making comparative salaries to these crazy people with five houses and, you know, drinking $12,000 bottles of wine.

23:16.561 --> 23:22.425
And so you just need to see that even in this pyramid in 2010, you could see this disaster coming.

23:23.803 --> 23:42.786
You could see that what is a, you know, a 3 million male bar, it looks like 5 million or 4 million female bar here at 75 to 79 could potentially be as high as 8 or 9 million if we keep all these people alive that long.

23:44.047 --> 23:52.468
If we manage, if they manage to stay alive and enjoy their pontoon boat for that long, enjoy their vacation houses for that long, where are we then?

23:53.783 --> 23:59.106
How much Medicare is spent?

23:59.166 --> 24:02.707
How much social security gets paid out?

24:03.308 --> 24:10.311
That is the inflection point that was conveniently right around 2019, 20, 21, 22, just conveniently.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.376
And so you can just let it play out.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.977
You can just see these bars growing.

24:22.017 --> 24:23.197
You can see them growing.

24:23.237 --> 24:27.379
That is an expected rise in all-cause mortality.

24:27.419 --> 24:28.139
It's right there.

24:28.199 --> 24:28.839
It's happening.

24:29.599 --> 24:30.760
You can see them growing.

24:31.621 --> 24:39.683
That expected rise in all-cause mortality was the biological signal that they misconstrued as a crisis.

24:40.383 --> 24:49.766
And the special, special, special thing about this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is it didn't need to be that dramatic.

24:53.820 --> 25:02.722
In order to get this signal right here that you see in America, and I would assure you, I assure you, I assure you, please check this yourself.

25:04.823 --> 25:09.364
There are very few countries in the world that have a signal like America does.

25:10.664 --> 25:14.185
And the reason that is, is because this happened in America.

25:15.302 --> 25:27.306
The murder, the lies, the murder and lies that are belied by this graph happened almost exclusively in America and a couple other key places.

25:27.446 --> 25:28.707
One of them being Scotland.

25:28.867 --> 25:39.791
Anywhere where their population pyramid had an especially special signal or they had some ulterior malevolent motives for wanting to get rid of the old people.

25:40.680 --> 25:53.990
But they did it, and they did it in a lot of places, but in America in particular, and then told everybody around the world that your lockdown is going better than ours because we can't figure it out here in America.

25:54.231 --> 26:08.682
And there were Americans and international meddlers online making sure that that murder and lies, that sculpting of an anticipated rise in all cause mortality, you can actually see it in this graph.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.941
was sculpted using murder and lies.

26:14.081 --> 26:19.584
And those murder and lies, after hard work and study, you can figure it out.

26:21.885 --> 26:24.367
Doctors should have been able to figure it out by now.

26:25.814 --> 26:30.276
But for some reason, at least on social media, it seems like doctors can't figure this out at all.

26:30.336 --> 26:46.865
They just can't get to the point where they understand that simply giving people supplementary oxygen under the fear that they might need it, that it might help if they have a pulse ox of 96 or below like the FLCCC recommended.

26:52.515 --> 26:53.976
And again, remember, it's a list.

26:54.096 --> 27:18.508
It's a long list of things that if you send these messages out into the ether, into corporate hospitals, and you get even a majority of doctors to follow along with this general idea, especially the one that you don't use antibiotics on a viral syndrome, and right now, most of the things that'll probably come in here are viral, we will have murder and lies.

27:20.799 --> 27:25.901
And now you add all these other things in here and it is just an absolute mess.

27:27.841 --> 27:29.382
And nobody's looking back on it.

27:30.102 --> 27:35.964
Nobody is gonna turn around and look in the rear view mirror because that is the goal.

27:36.784 --> 27:49.148
To teach this to our kids that pandemics are real, that vaccines can save us, that these questions are all worth asking and they are not.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.124
There are better questions to ask.

27:52.184 --> 27:53.945
There's better biology to research.

27:55.005 --> 27:57.586
And I don't know what to tell you.

27:57.626 --> 27:59.007
I think it's very, very simple.

27:59.767 --> 28:00.888
RNA cannot pandemic.

28:00.948 --> 28:03.369
Intramuscular injection is not a form of medicine.

28:03.929 --> 28:07.191
Transfecting healthy people was never a good idea.

28:07.371 --> 28:10.432
And they definitely knew better.

28:10.992 --> 28:15.935
And the population pyramids are actually the biology, the signal that they took advantage of.

28:16.937 --> 28:18.078
It's that simple.

28:19.079 --> 28:22.723
Once you understand that, you don't need to ask where the flu went.

28:23.784 --> 28:25.506
But this is all scripted, right?

28:25.546 --> 28:27.128
These people are all scripted.

28:27.589 --> 28:30.472
And it's not like they got a book and they're just following it.

28:30.512 --> 28:36.959
They get little hints, they get little tips, they get little, you know, here's another sponsor.

28:37.079 --> 28:38.881
And by the way, don't say that again.

28:41.890 --> 28:49.014
And also, there are more malevolent people out there that are more malevolently scripted.

28:49.154 --> 28:52.716
Otherwise, there would be a better explanation.

28:52.796 --> 29:02.662
There's no better explanation for that if you see this man wasting so much time with this woman on a podcast like this.

29:03.666 --> 29:09.481
This can only be explained by these two being some form of government NATO agent.

29:09.601 --> 29:12.389
I don't really know because she's Canadian and Israeli.

29:13.496 --> 29:19.500
I don't really know because he's worked for the Department of Energy since he dropped out of college.

29:19.560 --> 29:24.003
So it's hard to say, you know, but he's had clearance for a while.

29:24.503 --> 29:28.086
This lady clearly has an interesting set of passports.

29:29.047 --> 29:30.748
And that guy's a clown, right?

29:30.808 --> 29:34.971
So the only way to explain this and all the others, right?

29:35.851 --> 29:44.617
Because Tommy has had Robert Malone on his podcast alone and together with other people like countless, I don't even know how many times for sure.

29:45.037 --> 29:48.919
And at least twice he was on there with Stephen Hatfield.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.822
Those are some of the most remarkable videos I've ever downloaded from Rumble.

29:57.105 --> 29:58.345
It's all scripted bullshit.

29:59.526 --> 30:00.767
All scripted bullshitters.

30:02.313 --> 30:08.498
And we are now having really scripted bullshitters at the head of the FDA.

30:08.939 --> 30:13.082
And it is terrifying for the simple fact that we saw this coming.

30:13.162 --> 30:21.369
Mark Kulak in Boston, Massachusetts of Housatonic ITS and I have seen this weird signal.

30:22.270 --> 30:28.014
in the background and then in the foreground about intellectual property, about the FDA.

30:29.816 --> 30:31.817
It just became weirder and weirder.

30:31.857 --> 30:38.062
And at some point we had this, I felt the need to send an email to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:38.122 --> 30:45.928
and say, dude, did you know that Bret Weinstein recorded a podcast with you and then didn't release it for 14 months?

30:45.968 --> 30:48.850
Did you know that Bret Weinstein's dad worked with your dad?

30:50.523 --> 30:57.866
Could it be that Bret Weinstein is meddling with you because he didn't release that podcast for 14 months?

30:57.926 --> 30:58.847
Did you know that?

30:59.247 --> 31:00.147
That's crazy.

31:00.888 --> 31:05.650
And for me, that was a really big deal because I still believed that Bobby Kennedy was a good guy.

31:05.670 --> 31:10.012
I still believed that I was having an impact on the book and that I was figuring things out.

31:10.772 --> 31:22.840
And when I saw that Bret Weinstein had kept this recording until February of 2023, having recorded it in November of 2021, when I was in a signal chat with him, you see?

31:23.721 --> 31:25.422
So I was really pissed.

31:25.482 --> 31:30.365
I was like, man, Bret Weinstein was in the signal chat with me and I was teaching him all this stuff.

31:30.405 --> 31:32.767
And that guy interviewed you and he didn't even tell me.

31:33.507 --> 31:36.728
And then he didn't release it until 14 months later.

31:37.368 --> 31:41.550
And so I tried to explain all of this to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:41.570 --> 31:45.932
in an email, and he replied in about an hour after I sent the email with, thank you.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.175
It's all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

31:54.215 --> 31:56.916
It's all scripted bullshitters with scripted bullshitters.

31:57.096 --> 31:58.156
It's horrible.

32:00.640 --> 32:05.184
But it's also great because now we can finally see it and the realization can come.

32:05.204 --> 32:08.847
You don't have to, you know, you don't have to make any leaps of faith.

32:08.887 --> 32:21.258
You just have to do the research on your own to look at the patterns, make a calendar for yourself and see what they were up to and how their rhetoric did not change in the way it would if you were genuine.

32:22.639 --> 32:24.941
You will see the same pattern as I see.

32:26.022 --> 32:27.303
You will see scripted bullshit.

32:29.355 --> 32:32.336
And so where did that scripted bullshit get us by design?

32:32.376 --> 32:37.238
Well, it got us to accept PCR as a diagnostic standard all around the world, and that was achieved.

32:37.919 --> 32:41.260
It got us to accept sequencing as a high-fidelity measurement.

32:41.320 --> 32:48.563
And so there are very few professionals that would be willing to argue if somebody said, well, I found this sequence in your laboratory.

32:49.813 --> 32:58.618
Intramuscular injection has been proven beyond question as a great methodology in medicine, and that's quite terrifying, I have to say.

33:01.140 --> 33:06.503
The RNA has obviously huge military potential, of course, more than a nuclear bomb.

33:07.503 --> 33:15.288
RNA could potentially wipe out billions of people, and even somebody as intelligent, as bright as Sam Harris is definitely convinced.

33:16.416 --> 33:21.819
And solving America's health problems is going to be complicated because it's not just intramuscular injection.

33:21.859 --> 33:29.903
It's also you know petroleum-based dyes and and glyphosate and and and all the toxins in in

33:30.925 --> 33:32.467
in the food and processed food.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.050
And so, you know, RFK Jr.

33:35.310 --> 33:39.235
as Health and Human Services Secretary, already a huge win.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.737
And that's really where they've gotten us.

33:42.098 --> 33:43.399
That's what we believe, right?

33:43.439 --> 33:49.586
And I am now very convinced that the United States was the victim of a Trojan horse.

33:50.427 --> 34:03.295
And that Trojan horse was scripted by these two guys, Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, probably both working for the same weaponized piles of money or government agencies, or maybe they're double or triple agents for all I know.

34:04.776 --> 34:12.740
Brett Weinstein is a bit of a clown in this, but he's definitely a great example of the kind of people that they have used throughout the pandemic.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.582
And it would explain a lot of the roster of the people that

34:16.202 --> 34:17.702
currently playing for this team.

34:19.283 --> 34:37.266
It is a team of go-getters and it's a team of people who want certain things and that's independent of you know whatever the truth is or whatever justice is or whatever a future with freedom and justice means to them.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.567
They have some other goals and that might be a farm or a

34:41.447 --> 34:47.550
or a, I don't know, fame or, you know, to be as big as Joe Rogan or whatever these people want.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.272
So, it's all different things.

34:51.012 --> 34:57.536
You know, some people probably also just needed a girl or a guy and that solved all their problems too.

34:57.576 --> 35:01.398
But whatever it was, I just want to point out a couple things, okay?

35:01.438 --> 35:02.839
I just want to be really frank about it.

35:07.341 --> 35:08.822
The vast majority of Americans

35:10.479 --> 35:19.643
believed that Trump was actually shot at by a guy who went to the same high school as my son goes, and I think that's a lie.

35:20.604 --> 35:29.168
I don't know what parts of it are true and what parts of it are fake, but I know that their absolute disinterest in Matthew Crooks

35:30.595 --> 35:45.104
who lives four blocks away or supposedly lived four blocks away from my house, who had a video, a BlackRock video at the high school that was supposedly on social media or Discord or something like that.

35:45.144 --> 35:45.965
We know nothing.

35:46.903 --> 35:51.706
We know nothing about the surgeon who fixed Trump's ear to perfection.

35:51.987 --> 35:53.608
And we know nothing about a scar.

35:54.188 --> 35:58.951
We know nothing at all because Trump wasn't shot.

35:59.011 --> 36:03.555
That was a social media orchestrated stunt.

36:04.895 --> 36:10.398
and they were demonstrating the power of social media and how easily they control a narrative like that.

36:10.438 --> 36:23.064
And one of the ways they did it was they had people like Brett Weinstein do a few podcasts about multiple shooters and had a few other, you know, Bush League level people do some stuff about multiple shooters.

36:23.124 --> 36:24.865
And then that climbed up the chain.

36:24.925 --> 36:32.829
And before you know it, you have people on the left laughing about the idea that they're talking about multiple shooters or that maybe the Secret Service was in on it.

36:32.869 --> 36:33.710
That's ridiculous.

36:34.895 --> 36:40.681
to the right saying that there were even people in a hangar somewhere far away with a drone or something like that.

36:42.462 --> 36:42.763
And so

36:43.991 --> 37:09.379
The thing you need to see is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as a Health and Human Services Secretary, is a massive distraction, not only for you on the right or us on the right or us on the conservative populist right, but the people on the left that are into trans rights and think that some of these trans high school kids are legit and should be throwing a softball for nine games straight or something like that.

37:09.459 --> 37:13.060
Like, look, it's a distraction.

37:14.417 --> 37:15.917
And how do you know it's a distraction?

37:17.398 --> 37:22.619
Because Trump's administration did not submit a budget this fall.

37:24.860 --> 37:28.481
Please understand how absurd that is.

37:29.621 --> 37:37.903
Not only is it absurd, but think about how absurd that is that the media hasn't even covered it.

37:39.537 --> 37:41.502
He's not a first term president.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.834
He's had four years to plan his triumphant return.

37:46.673 --> 37:56.476
He's had four years to scout out who he wants in what places or to get people who know and plan it out so that when he got in, he could hit the ground running.

37:56.536 --> 38:00.077
Yet they did not submit a budget.

38:00.137 --> 38:08.120
Instead, you heard a lot about Elon Musk and, and, and, and Donald Trump, you know, having some kind of bromance problems or whatever.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.080
You heard a lot about Israel.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.061
You heard a lot about everything else.

38:12.661 --> 38:17.244
but the simple fact that the Trump administration did not submit a budget.

38:18.665 --> 38:21.047
That is just rank incompetence.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.471
That's like saying, I need to take over the ship.

38:28.591 --> 38:29.792
I need to take over the ship.

38:29.912 --> 38:31.073
I need to take over the ship.

38:31.113 --> 38:34.195
And so then, yeah, you know, they, they let you take over the ship.

38:34.255 --> 38:34.335
Okay.

38:34.355 --> 38:35.155
What are you going to do?

38:35.276 --> 38:36.656
Steady as she goes.

38:37.977 --> 38:38.738
You don't have any better.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.118
Nope.

38:39.138 --> 38:40.319
Steady as she goes.

38:42.022 --> 38:45.243
I'll be at the captain's table at 18... 1800 hours.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.103
I expect steak.

38:51.806 --> 38:53.126
And yet, what are we fighting about?

38:53.186 --> 38:54.226
Whose case he means?

38:54.667 --> 39:01.009
Are we fighting about the mRNA or whether we shouldn't do the... This is the problem.

39:03.350 --> 39:06.651
The ship is still going to be run into the rocks.

39:07.850 --> 39:10.511
America is still going to be controlled, demolished.

39:10.591 --> 39:13.273
Nobody is taking the foot off the pedal at all.

39:18.295 --> 39:21.877
And we are still trying to debate whether there's something good happening?

39:25.159 --> 39:27.920
Our Secretary of Defense is a mega joke.

39:29.521 --> 39:35.464
And the only reason why anybody watching this show might not be aware of it is because of your skillful use of social media.

39:35.984 --> 39:37.325
Because the rest of the world knows.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.361
and the rest of the world is being shown.

39:43.301 --> 39:59.427
And so while we lounge around in our little bubble on X or on Telegram or on Locals or listening to the Bret Weinstein podcast and typing into the chat, way to go Bret, you just are such a great guy.

39:59.447 --> 40:06.450
The Trump administration did submit a budget and also Bret Weinstein doesn't seem to be aware of that either.

40:06.490 --> 40:09.151
So what kind of citizen is this asshole really anyway?

40:10.387 --> 40:13.891
Does he even know anything about how the government works?

40:15.753 --> 40:20.679
Do any of these people understand what happens when the National Guard is sent somewhere?

40:20.739 --> 40:22.141
Are they just allowed to do whatever?

40:22.161 --> 40:25.485
Do they just fall under the command of local police?

40:26.417 --> 40:33.902
What has the media told you about the use of National Guard in particular states in those deployments?

40:33.922 --> 40:35.183
What have they told you about that?

40:35.223 --> 40:41.567
Have they informed you at all about what the Guard can do and can't do and under whose orders they're under?

40:41.607 --> 40:44.088
Because if they haven't, then what are they really doing?

40:47.310 --> 40:51.293
Other than showing you pictures and telling you stories,

40:53.567 --> 40:56.976
Even Nicole Shanahan says it's the CIA on our streets.

40:59.463 --> 41:00.646
How come it's always the CIA?

41:21.775 --> 41:25.864
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

41:26.514 --> 41:29.996
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

41:30.256 --> 41:31.297
But this one is pretty cool.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.379
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.382
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

41:38.982 --> 41:41.444
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

41:41.484 --> 41:46.487
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

41:46.767 --> 41:49.208
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

41:49.228 --> 41:51.450
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

41:53.200 --> 42:02.288
the masks, or behind, you know, proper testing, or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right, this technology that has never been used widely.

42:02.808 --> 42:04.649
None of that is over.

42:04.770 --> 42:08.593
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were

42:09.093 --> 42:13.075
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

42:13.335 --> 42:15.976
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

42:16.456 --> 42:20.638
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

42:20.678 --> 42:23.739
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

42:25.100 --> 42:32.763
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

42:33.223 --> 42:34.664
All of that was on a global basis.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.182
But you can tell if someone's lying.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.585
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

42:42.408 --> 42:43.109
And I have lied.

42:43.129 --> 42:44.150
I'm sure I'll lie again.

42:46.594 --> 42:50.279
So the thing about that slide is, I want to play that again.

42:52.546 --> 42:55.267
the masks or behind, you know, proper testing.

42:55.567 --> 42:59.149
If you listen to what Mary Holland is saying here, she said this this year.

43:01.170 --> 43:02.150
She's number one.

43:02.210 --> 43:06.833
She's reciting the entire narrative, including the fact that she had it.

43:07.513 --> 43:09.794
And since she had it, she could travel.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.900
She was only sick for two days.

43:12.940 --> 43:18.501
She took ivermectin, giggle, giggle, and she was fine, but that gave her natural immunity.

43:18.541 --> 43:28.183
And since she could travel, she's actually implying that she tested positive for seroprevalence and that allowed her to travel, even though she took ivermectin.

43:28.623 --> 43:32.684
And so supposedly the virus didn't replicate or something like that.

43:34.964 --> 43:40.525
The other thing that you need to hear and make sure you hear it, because I was trying to say it earlier in my introduction,

43:42.554 --> 43:44.875
People were not murdered everywhere.

43:46.436 --> 43:50.259
This idea that there was a narrative that was everywhere is true.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.701
But that narrative was a little different depending on where you were.

43:55.162 --> 44:02.666
And in America, we were told that people were dying because of Donald Trump, that because of people were dying because the FDA was in the way of testing.

44:02.686 --> 44:03.747
We didn't have enough tests.

44:03.827 --> 44:05.128
That's why people were dying.

44:05.188 --> 44:07.429
So people that had it were spreading it around.

44:07.929 --> 44:09.610
All of these narratives were told.

44:09.750 --> 44:11.612
And then the results,

44:12.540 --> 44:29.150
that I've shown you in those CDC's own numbers, those results where they just seem to have lost control of pneumonia for a couple of years, those results, and especially the beginning of them in 2020 and 21, were shown around the world as how not to do it.

44:30.571 --> 44:39.717
And where those numbers weren't found, it was said that masks were effective, or their lockdowns were effective, or they had tests before us, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

44:40.851 --> 44:45.796
And if you remember, there was only one exception to that hamster wheel, and that was Sweden.

44:46.316 --> 44:51.221
Everywhere else, it was just obvious that there was a pandemic or that the lockdowns worked.

44:52.723 --> 44:55.525
And so Mary Holland is telling you a story

44:56.542 --> 45:10.576
implying that people died everywhere, but people were only really murdered in America and in Scotland and in a couple other places, but none of which have been documented so easily and well as Scotland and America.

45:10.636 --> 45:19.205
And those two places may have been enough to terrify the rest of the UK, to terrify the rest of the English-speaking world, to terrify everyone.

45:21.203 --> 45:33.183
And so now you really need to reconsider, would Mary Holland really say all of these words out loud in front of a crowd of people if she wasn't scripted to do so?

45:34.142 --> 45:38.424
or behind the six foot distancing, the two meter distancing, or behind these shots, right?

45:38.465 --> 45:40.486
This technology that has never been used widely.

45:41.006 --> 45:42.847
None of that is over.

45:42.967 --> 45:51.272
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

45:51.532 --> 45:54.193
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

45:54.674 --> 46:00.297
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity having had it for two days.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.898
I took ivermectin, I was fine.

46:02.758 --> 46:10.960
Um, and so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

46:11.401 --> 46:14.722
All of that was on a global basis.

46:14.742 --> 46:18.663
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

46:20.443 --> 46:21.183
And I have lied.

46:21.363 --> 46:22.224
I'm sure I'll lie again.

46:22.244 --> 46:23.184
I don't want to lie.

46:23.644 --> 46:25.004
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

46:25.104 --> 46:26.145
I try not to be a liar.

46:26.185 --> 46:27.025
I don't want to be a liar.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.306
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

46:36.909 --> 46:45.336
uh from where i'm sitting there's a whole bunch of covid in condition that we will not call autism i don't like the word autism um he was vaccine damaged he was neurologically damaged

47:07.299 --> 47:10.061
condition that we will not call autism.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.763
I don't like the word autism.

47:12.644 --> 47:13.624
He was vaccine damaged.

47:13.644 --> 47:19.709
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

47:21.511 --> 47:22.211
And I have lied.

47:22.231 --> 47:23.272
I'm sure I'll lie again.

47:23.292 --> 47:24.233
I don't want to lie.

47:24.713 --> 47:26.055
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

47:26.175 --> 47:27.195
I try not to be a liar.

47:27.236 --> 47:28.076
I don't want to be a liar.

47:28.657 --> 47:31.379
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

47:33.436 --> 47:41.966
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

47:45.891 --> 47:51.498
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

47:52.159 --> 47:58.722
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and it's measles plus.

47:58.822 --> 48:04.384
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

48:04.684 --> 48:06.625
It's just a big hassle in the end.

48:09.793 --> 48:22.983
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

48:23.043 --> 48:25.545
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

48:28.852 --> 48:29.332
Actually J.J.

48:29.372 --> 48:35.997
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

48:36.758 --> 48:37.258
Actually J.J.

48:37.298 --> 48:43.922
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

48:44.703 --> 48:45.203
Actually J.J.

48:45.223 --> 48:51.808
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

48:57.857 --> 49:18.268
I don't care how you get there.

49:18.288 --> 49:21.010
I don't care what you do to get there.

49:22.891 --> 49:23.571
The goal is to win.

49:28.267 --> 49:29.236
What time is it?

49:29.256 --> 49:29.983
Game time!

49:30.145 --> 49:30.266
Hoo!

49:36.437 --> 49:37.638
Hey, good morning, everybody.

49:37.718 --> 49:38.599
Welcome to the show.

49:38.639 --> 49:39.760
We're going to get right to it.

49:40.381 --> 49:44.925
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

49:45.506 --> 49:48.929
I know I'm coming in the middle of your day, and I apologize for that.

49:49.049 --> 49:54.694
I know that we're all trying to figure this out as our dollar is worth less every day.

49:56.116 --> 49:57.697
I know we're trying to figure this out.

49:57.797 --> 50:01.201
One of the ways you can get some more time back is to get off of social media

50:01.741 --> 50:04.683
That's one of the only forms of non-compliance that really matters.

50:04.783 --> 50:11.268
So much of this narrative was only possible because we were on social media, and I really, really regret not seeing that earlier.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.990
In tradition, we will not call autism.

50:14.211 --> 50:15.351
I don't like the word autism.

50:15.431 --> 50:15.772
I know.

50:16.452 --> 50:16.732
Brian.

50:16.913 --> 50:17.593
...vaccine damage.

50:17.653 --> 50:18.674
Brian, Brian, Brian.

50:19.414 --> 50:25.579
Autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

50:26.039 --> 50:30.762
Virology is never questioned as a science and public health is never questioned as a reason or an answer.

50:31.783 --> 50:36.426
And you could say the same thing for pandemics and gain of function and a lot of other things.

50:37.881 --> 50:45.768
And if you don't start to understand this trap, understand why the cheese is free on social media, your children will be enslaved.

50:46.869 --> 50:48.071
That's the best I can put it.

50:48.851 --> 50:54.577
There's lots of illusions out there, including that Google Fold thing that doesn't really seem to know anything about prions yet.

50:55.678 --> 51:00.722
Gigabomb Biological is the biology that they ignore they being the people that seem to have

51:01.463 --> 51:06.605
I've decided they want to be part of the ruling elite, and so they've sold out our grandkids.

51:07.526 --> 51:10.187
Gigo Home Biological and my family is not part of that.

51:11.707 --> 51:20.291
We are not doing anything here but putting it all on the line, and that's what we do here at Gigo Home Biological.

51:20.911 --> 51:21.592
This is a

51:23.629 --> 51:26.611
family of five in America, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

51:26.631 --> 51:29.893
It's a stream for America and for the world.

51:29.953 --> 51:35.896
We have family in the Netherlands that are also trapped inside of a more advanced version of the same trap.

51:36.797 --> 51:39.558
If you are here, you are at the top of the wave.

51:39.578 --> 51:40.639
You've been here for a while.

51:40.719 --> 51:48.924
If not, you might really need to be reminded on how to stay focused on the biology, not take their bait on social media and love your neighbor.

51:49.804 --> 51:52.265
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cui.

51:52.905 --> 51:54.866
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

51:54.906 --> 51:56.127
You can find me on PubMed.

51:56.267 --> 51:58.388
You can find me in the Wuhan cover-up book.

51:58.868 --> 52:03.950
You used to be able to find me around Jay Bhattacharya at some barbecues, but not anymore.

52:03.970 --> 52:10.713
You used to see me on a YouTube channel called JC on a Bike, but for now I've kind of put that to rest.

52:11.473 --> 52:12.513
They gave me a strike.

52:12.553 --> 52:13.514
I want to make sure I don't

52:14.614 --> 52:34.882
endanger that catalog of videos and so I'm now streaming under a moniker called JC in the woods which is a channel that I opened up during the pandemic but never put any put any videos on it and so you could find me there on YouTube if you're lucky and look for it I'd appreciate if you do that I make this a little bit more resilient even inside of their own network

52:36.876 --> 52:40.800
And again, I've said it before, how this works is I've got about 110 subscribers.

52:42.161 --> 52:49.549
They have given me a monthly donation and you can do that on the website giggleandbiological.com.

52:49.929 --> 52:54.914
I also have a few people that give me a larger donation every month that basically makes those ends meet.

52:56.356 --> 53:08.505
And if you're interested in downloading some of the things to help you think about this stuff, including our biology 101 recommended textbooks, please go to the link stuff at gigaombiological.com and find that.

53:08.985 --> 53:10.006
And there are other links there.

53:10.066 --> 53:11.487
We won't talk about those for now.

53:13.108 --> 53:16.371
I also want to give a shout out to my friend Mark Kulak.

53:17.071 --> 53:18.772
at houstatonicits.com.

53:19.033 --> 53:25.238
Great work, great website, always a new link there.

53:25.558 --> 53:31.302
He's been working hard to catalog the people that are involved in this, and I think he's done a pretty good job.

53:31.342 --> 53:33.244
Certainly he's done a lot better than anybody else.

53:34.405 --> 53:37.688
And that makes him part of what I call an independent bright web.

53:38.448 --> 53:42.894
a group of Americans that's out to figure it out.

53:43.315 --> 53:53.389
A group of Americans that is willing to call each other out, to help each other out, to check each other out, to back each other up, and also working on their own thing.

53:54.781 --> 54:07.346
In no way, shape, or form am I trying to say that what I do would ever cover what Joe's does or would ever cover what Mark does, but it's a spontaneous sort of harmonizing.

54:07.386 --> 54:09.687
A lot like bluegrass music, I think.

54:09.727 --> 54:13.529
Independent Brightweb could be thought of as really good bluegrass music.

54:14.369 --> 54:16.832
just a bunch of good musicians getting together and jamming.

54:17.813 --> 54:30.508
And we don't even really need to get together because our work stands out in contrast to a team of performers with elaborate costumes and effects all on the same script.

54:31.108 --> 54:33.529
It's not just a few of these guys, it's hundreds of them.

54:33.569 --> 54:41.793
And once you realize that, it starts to become obvious who Joe Marshall is, who Mark Kulak is, and I think who Jonathan Cooley is as well.

54:41.853 --> 54:46.155
We are all Americans, and we are all free of a script.

54:47.396 --> 54:50.738
Free of a script, at least given to us by sponsors.

54:52.478 --> 54:54.679
Free of a script given to us by Rumble.

54:54.779 --> 54:59.702
Free of a script given to us by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

55:01.035 --> 55:02.416
That's where I think we are.

55:02.956 --> 55:06.939
Free of a script that these people were all obviously on.

55:08.300 --> 55:10.901
Very free of a script.

55:11.021 --> 55:13.303
Very, very free of a script.

55:14.883 --> 55:17.845
And that's why we've fallen out of the control of these people.

55:17.905 --> 55:22.588
That's why it really seems as though they've lost control.

55:22.628 --> 55:23.589
Because they actually have.

55:24.569 --> 55:42.327
um today i want to look at i don't know why that's so loud sorry about that i uh i really want to look at this this podcast um the number seven podcast of the FDA which was three or four days ago two days ago i don't know when it was but

55:43.007 --> 55:48.912
It is quite extraordinary because as I've said, and Mark has said before, there's this myth.

55:49.713 --> 55:52.315
I haven't said it as a myth yet, but I'm going to say it today.

55:52.515 --> 55:53.636
It's the title of this show.

55:54.176 --> 55:56.758
Personalized medicine is a myth, and it's always been a myth.

55:56.918 --> 56:01.742
And they've been talking about personalized medicine for a long time in the context of genetics.

56:02.363 --> 56:05.225
So fixing people's genes problems.

56:05.265 --> 56:10.409
That's why they interchange the idea of rare diseases are

56:11.590 --> 56:16.451
They use the word disease to describe rare diseases, which are actually genetic.

56:18.052 --> 56:19.272
I don't know what the right word would be.

56:19.352 --> 56:21.233
I'm gonna turn this music down.

56:22.173 --> 56:38.877
They use the word, the words rare disease to describe things where a single protein is missing or malforms or, and that, that is an enchantment.

56:38.957 --> 56:40.858
That is a semantic enchantment.

56:42.295 --> 56:51.823
You have to see that because it is disguising the idea that they are interested primarily in genetic abnormalities.

56:52.443 --> 57:07.456
Because genetic abnormalities are one of the few perhaps legitimate handholds that they can get on the irreducible complexity that is our genome or polygenome or whatever it is that we have in ourselves.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.994
And if you've never heard me use the word polygenome before, well, there we go.

57:12.014 --> 57:13.535
Now we're making some progress here.

57:14.716 --> 57:22.241
And so before I do this, though, I think somebody gave me some homework a while ago, and I think I want to work on that homework first.

57:23.422 --> 57:25.544
So I'm going to go to a video from 2013.

57:26.064 --> 57:30.867
And for some reason, I couldn't get this video to insert directly into my slide deck.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.489
So I'm going to briefly step out of

57:36.290 --> 57:39.531
PowerPoint and I'm going to open this video separately over here.

57:42.651 --> 57:45.052
And then put it on the screen over there.

57:46.432 --> 57:51.393
Now the video that I'm going to watch is a video of Tony Bark.

57:52.913 --> 57:57.034
And Tony Bark is a, let me just get that up there quick.

57:57.614 --> 57:57.714
What?

58:02.982 --> 58:04.124
I just want to open it.

58:04.364 --> 58:05.485
Oh, I see, I dragged it.

58:07.488 --> 58:12.574
I'm speaking today with Dr. Toni Bark, who practices family medicine in Chicago.

58:13.255 --> 58:18.201
I learned about Dr. Bark after hearing her speak at Autism One in Chicago this past May.

58:18.221 --> 58:21.865
I was very eager to interview her about her talk at A1.

58:23.089 --> 58:30.098
Dr. Bark has been- Okay, so A1, Autism 1, some kind of meeting about autism in 2013.

58:30.158 --> 58:33.582
This is an interview from July 26th.

58:34.343 --> 58:36.586
An outraged academic.

58:36.666 --> 58:40.130
Now, the thing that I find so cool about Tony Bark

58:41.739 --> 58:49.306
is that actually Tony Bark was the head of Rush Medical School's ER.

58:49.746 --> 58:55.471
So Rush Hospital, Rush Medical Center is attached to Rush Medical School in Chicago.

58:55.511 --> 59:00.656
Chicago's an interesting city because it has five medical schools in it.

59:00.696 --> 59:04.019
It has University of Illinois Chicago, it has Loyola,

59:05.240 --> 59:15.011
University, it has Rush Medical Center, which is Rush University, it has Northwestern University, and it has the University of Chicago on the south side.

59:15.191 --> 59:22.279
All of those are fairly decent schools and certainly from a perspective of local

59:24.358 --> 59:26.999
local reputation, none of them have a bad one.

59:27.039 --> 59:30.381
It's not like they're the same as going to the Caribbean or something like that.

59:30.901 --> 59:39.064
And nobody that was applying to med school, maybe you might say that UIC is the least competitive of those, and that might have changed since I applied.

59:39.764 --> 59:41.925
But all of those schools were on my radar.

59:41.985 --> 59:45.467
I just didn't apply to the University of Chicago or to Northwestern.

59:46.347 --> 59:48.328
I didn't think I could get in the University of Chicago.

59:48.348 --> 59:49.688
I didn't want to go to Northwestern.

59:49.708 --> 59:56.950
So I was primarily focused on Loyola and on Rush and on UIC because I thought those were schools that I could get into.

59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.151
And it cost a lot of money back then to apply.

01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:04.552
And so you couldn't just throw your application out to 10 schools every year.

01:00:05.972 --> 01:00:07.152
But I know Rush.

01:00:08.193 --> 01:00:10.633
And actually, my first choice would have been Rush.

01:00:11.053 --> 01:00:12.274
I got interviewed at Rush.

01:00:15.635 --> 01:00:23.599
And for her to be the head of their ER means that she was absolutely a badass.

01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:26.040
Like not a TV doctor.

01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:35.725
This is not a backcountry doctor who claims to be an expert in anthrax because she wrote a blog or because she trekked through Africa.

01:00:37.306 --> 01:00:41.668
Because Rush Medical Center is very, very close to Cook County Hospital.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:43.930
And if you know anything about TV,

01:00:45.796 --> 01:00:54.259
And you know anything about the show ER, where all these handsome, beautiful, famous people made their debut on television?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.622
ER is made in the theme of, or under the pretense that it's Cook County Hospital.

01:01:02.572 --> 01:01:05.693
Rush Medical Center is right across the street as far as I remember the map.

01:01:05.754 --> 01:01:06.814
It's very, very close.

01:01:07.614 --> 01:01:10.616
It's a very, very, very, very, very busy place.

01:01:10.656 --> 01:01:29.024
You cannot be at all, even remotely faking it to make it, which I am arguing a lot of the people that have been put in front of us over the last five years are exclusively doing, that Vinay Prasad is exclusively doing, that Marty Makary is exclusive.

01:01:29.044 --> 01:01:30.605
They are faking it to make it.

01:01:32.698 --> 01:01:41.805
And in 2013, I believe this video is going to, beyond a shadow of doubt, prove to me that Tony Bark was not faking it to make it.

01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:44.947
Tony Bark was a giant.

01:01:45.728 --> 01:01:51.833
And to have her become skeptical of vaccines was a major problem.

01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:56.000
So let's see what we got here in this interview.

01:01:56.081 --> 01:02:02.545
Note, don't forget that Tony Bark was eventually interviewed by Infowars and then died soon after.

01:02:03.646 --> 01:02:06.408
Not that dissimilar to Brandy Vaughn.

01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:21.480
In fact, I think in this video, I'm gonna be listening for cues on why Brandy Vaughn's unique background as a Merck pharmaceutical representative

01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:27.088
would have jived really well with Tony Barks already.

01:02:27.668 --> 01:02:33.130
You can see 2013, this is going to be a couple, three years before Brandy really hits her stride.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:42.392
I think Mark is exactly right when he makes the conjecture that Brandy Vaughn only really became dangerous after she met Tony Bark.

01:02:43.912 --> 01:02:45.713
And Tony Bark died in March of 2020.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:03:02.799
She maintained a private practice in homeopathy for more than 15 years, and she also teaches in a master's program in medical disaster planning at Boston University.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:09.885
In 2012, Dr. Bark became the second vice president of the American Institute of Homeopathy.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.304
And so I'm really excited to hear what you have to say.

01:03:13.324 --> 01:03:25.741
And A, one, you described yourself as an outraged academic because of the full control, not just influence, the pharmaceutical industry has over our health care.

01:03:26.471 --> 01:03:32.334
I don't even really think that was that good of an introduction because I think she should have said that she was in attending at an ER.

01:03:33.174 --> 01:03:34.535
I think you should have started there.

01:03:34.595 --> 01:03:42.118
If you start with, she's the president of homeopathy, you don't get the idea that she's put her hands inside of gunshot wounds.

01:03:44.419 --> 01:03:49.502
And I don't think that's a, I mean, it's not that lady's fault maybe, and maybe she's just really humble, but for me,

01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:59.083
That one dot, even if it was just for two years, that one dot as a professional just blows my mind.

01:04:02.344 --> 01:04:03.344
It just really does.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:09.026
It blows my mind because an ER is a very, very special place to be a doctor.

01:04:10.466 --> 01:04:13.367
And my guess is, is that Pierre Corey's never done it.

01:04:13.627 --> 01:04:18.088
My guess is, is that a lot of these doctors have never done ER work.

01:04:21.874 --> 01:04:22.674
And there's a reason.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.115
I really do think there's a reason.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.836
And it ain't because they didn't watch ER when they were teenagers.

01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:42.362
And because of this massive power and wealth that the pharmaceutical industry has, how likely is it that government officials would even acknowledge that this is true, let alone do anything to stop it?

01:04:43.243 --> 01:04:49.105
And in that same regard, is there any real oversight when it comes to medicine in America?

01:04:51.658 --> 01:04:53.440
Uh, big, big question.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.263
So, um, I have to say, I'm going to start backwards.

01:04:57.303 --> 01:04:58.604
Is there any real oversight?

01:04:59.385 --> 01:05:06.551
Theoretically, there's some oversight and I, and I suppose with enough death caused by one drug.

01:05:07.172 --> 01:05:13.777
The sink will go in and out because this is 2013 when, you know, we didn't have all this fancy stuff we have now.

01:05:13.957 --> 01:05:16.479
So, but it's not me and it's not the video.

01:05:16.499 --> 01:05:16.900
You'll see.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.242
One procedure at some point,

01:05:19.738 --> 01:05:24.203
There's oversight, but we know that it can take 100,000 deaths, right?

01:05:24.243 --> 01:05:26.506
I mean, we know what happened with Vioxx and Avandia.

01:05:28.348 --> 01:05:30.391
The biggest problem is that the

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:38.447
the agencies which are supposed to be looking at the industry.

01:05:38.487 --> 01:05:47.150
And you know, and this isn't just in the pharmaceutical industry, this is in gas and oil, this is in banking, this is in the food, food chain, you know.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.530
So she already mentioned Vioxx there, right?

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.071
Now remember that Brandy worked for Merck selling Vioxx.

01:05:57.413 --> 01:05:58.093
I'm just saying.

01:05:59.448 --> 01:06:03.713
that controls our food, again, going back to the FDA.

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:18.151
I'm sure it's in other industries, but anything that there's a regulatory body, there's going to be corruption at a very high level and in a very big way, because there's billions of dollars at stake in these industries.

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:21.941
that I just mentioned, all of them.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:29.706
But my concern and my focus, of course, is looking at the pharmaceutical industry, although food relates quite closely.

01:06:30.847 --> 01:06:41.875
I've heard whistleblowers from the FDA speak, and it certainly sounds like the FDA is basically a rubber stamp machine for the pharmaceutical industry to approve new drugs that are going to make a lot of money.

01:06:42.796 --> 01:06:46.619
We know that it takes whistleblowers to come forth and say, look,

01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:57.057
you know the FDA has been approving we know that from studies and post surveillance there's been many many deaths but one of the key issues is that

01:06:58.992 --> 01:07:01.896
There's a whistleblower protection for federal workers.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:16.654
I mean, yes, there was a law passed last December in 2012 that finally, finally gave whistleblower protection to federal workers with the caveat of federal workers that have to do with any of the health regulatory agencies.

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:30.537
So while we're all excited that finally there's going to be some whistleblower protection for people in the federal government, it wasn't whistleblower protection for people at the FDA, CDC, NIH, HHS.

01:07:30.937 --> 01:07:36.120
They only got military whistleblower protection, which is very little, if any.

01:07:37.818 --> 01:07:54.113
And so we don't have whistleblower protection, so it's very tough for somebody, a government official, to come forward at the HHS and any of its bodies, including the FDA, and say that this kind of monkey business is going on, there's been so many deaths.

01:07:54.393 --> 01:07:58.597
And so that's a problem, that creates a big impediment, and that's there for a reason.

01:07:59.077 --> 01:08:03.161
Those whistleblower protections are not there for that very purpose.

01:08:03.976 --> 01:08:14.039
to make it more difficult for people at the regulatory agencies to come forward with news that there are some malfeasance going on.

01:08:14.359 --> 01:08:21.862
And, you know, so is there a regulatory, I don't really know how much regulation there really is.

01:08:21.922 --> 01:08:23.262
I think there's more politics.

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:26.123
We know in order to get a drug approved.

01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:28.684
Now, I just want you to think about something for a second.

01:08:28.744 --> 01:08:32.045
Mark showed us a few pictures of Tony Bark and pictures with,

01:08:33.105 --> 01:08:34.426
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:35.627
and Mary Holland.

01:08:35.767 --> 01:08:40.371
And I've shown you videos of Mary Holland in 2015 on Democracy Now!

01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:46.796
arguing that one or more of the components untested in the MMR injured her son.

01:08:48.438 --> 01:08:52.181
And so she's not anti-vaccine, she just wants vaccines properly tested.

01:08:54.258 --> 01:09:06.933
Does it sound like Tony Bark is ahead of her at all in 2013 here just already about how the FDA could have been corrupted by all the money that's available and then corrupting the FDA could destroy the FDA?

01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:14.202
because destroying the FDA is required in order to get personalized medicine through.

01:09:14.282 --> 01:09:16.083
You have to neutralize the FDA.

01:09:16.123 --> 01:09:30.127
You have to put people in the FDA that will no longer act on its mandate of regulating medical devices and food and whatever as safe and effective and what's on the label is what's in the box.

01:09:30.627 --> 01:09:33.968
If you put people in charge of the FDA that no longer enforce that,

01:09:34.688 --> 01:09:38.411
or create exceptions to that, then you don't need to ruin the FDA.

01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:39.552
You don't need to destroy it.

01:09:39.612 --> 01:09:47.618
But they were creating skepticism in the FDA by corrupting it, by genuinely corrupting it on purpose.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.141
Everybody hates the FDA.

01:09:52.941 --> 01:09:57.805
You either hate it because it's corrupt or you hate it because whatever it makes you do is in your way.

01:09:57.865 --> 01:09:58.846
It's too many papers.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:10.190
And now, I don't know if you can imagine it or not, but I heard somewhere that like some of these applications to the FDA can be 800,000 pages long.

01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:34.430
And this is getting into like, you know, the push to get vitamins and supplements into the FDA approval process, which means, you know, you have a vitamin, you want 6 million minimum to get approved.

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:39.797
And, you know, this is basically making it so sperm owns the market share of everything.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:42.018
And so there's a lot of politics involved.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:48.683
Will government officials come forward to say that there's problems and that we have a problem, that vaccines could be causing a problem?

01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:52.006
It's very tough for any kind of government official to do it.

01:10:52.286 --> 01:11:01.313
We've seen senators, we've seen congressmen come forward and say we have a problem, but we also know that they're not going to get funding from the pharma consortium

01:11:02.179 --> 01:11:04.260
if they create problems for pharma, right?

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:21.564
So if you're from New Jersey, let's say, or Illinois, anywhere where there's a headquarters of Merck or Glaxo or Abbott or Baxter, any of these companies, and you're making a problem for them, you're not going to get funding in your campaign, you know, and they'll make it really clear to you.

01:11:21.664 --> 01:11:22.664
So it's very hard

01:11:23.263 --> 01:11:25.164
for our legislators to come forward.

01:11:25.184 --> 01:11:29.546
It's even harder for people in the FDA, CDC, NIH to come forward, because they'll lose their job.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.407
They don't have whistleblower protection.

01:11:31.707 --> 01:11:32.287
It's their life.

01:11:32.447 --> 01:11:35.609
It's their life, you know, the way they make their living at stake.

01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:50.315
And we know that, especially looking at Peter Doshi's work at Johns Hopkins, you know, there was an article about Peter Doshi and his whole consortium at the university, and he's a postdoc fellow, very brilliant.

01:11:52.617 --> 01:11:54.118
In 2013?

01:11:54.158 --> 01:12:01.500
I don't know if you know who Peter Doshi is, but this is definitely a very, very big red flag that she was murdered.

01:12:02.481 --> 01:12:13.085
Peter Doshi was a very big problem at the beginning of the pandemic because he had a platform, he had respect, and he said some things that shouldn't have been said, but he didn't question the real narrative.

01:12:14.445 --> 01:12:17.767
but just the fact that she mentions Peter Doshi means I have homework to do.

01:12:17.907 --> 01:12:19.709
Wow, that's cool.

01:12:20.029 --> 01:12:31.457
Who's saying that why do we allow drug companies to, you know, when they come forward to try to get a drug approved, to just present whatever they want out of their research, just the positive notes out of their research for their drug.

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:32.738
They don't have to present the whole picture.

01:12:32.778 --> 01:12:36.901
So there could be numerous studies with many deaths and many problems, but they don't.

01:12:37.321 --> 01:12:39.322
Just remember, right, this is 2013, which makes it roughly

01:12:44.964 --> 01:12:45.845
It's a long time ago.

01:12:48.346 --> 01:12:49.567
It's a long time ago, guys.

01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:57.012
All they have to do is present what they want.

01:12:57.032 --> 01:13:01.234
It's not obligatory to present everything, all their research.

01:13:01.635 --> 01:13:03.696
And Peter Doshi is trying to change that, which would help.

01:13:05.213 --> 01:13:05.613
Thank you.

01:13:06.954 --> 01:13:16.218
Now, you make it very clear that there is no science behind the claim that studies show no link between vaccines and autism.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:19.839
And I'd just like you to explain what you mean by that.

01:13:20.399 --> 01:13:31.204
Yeah, I mean, anybody with a master's in statistics, in public health, in any medical science has to know

01:13:34.588 --> 01:13:37.610
that there's a definition of the term attributable rate.

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:53.120
And what those studies and what the CDC said and the AAP that published that paper, the claim was, now we have another study showing no link between autism and vaccines, which means they're saying the attributable rate of autism to vaccines is zero.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.902
That's what they're saying, that the attributable rate, that's a term, it's got a definition.

01:13:57.202 --> 01:13:59.404
The definition has a mathematical equation.

01:13:59.424 --> 01:14:02.826
The mathematical equation- Oh my gosh, you see a problem.

01:14:05.304 --> 01:14:09.868
I'm almost breaking down right now because I did not expect it to be this good.

01:14:11.309 --> 01:14:15.172
I am freaking out a little bit because you see what this is.

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:18.635
She says there is no science.

01:14:20.696 --> 01:14:21.777
There is no science.

01:14:24.699 --> 01:14:33.446
You know that that's exactly the line that Robert F. Kennedy uses to say there is no science saying that vaccines are safe and effective.

01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:45.277
She says there is no science supporting the idea that vaccines don't cause autism and she's using a statistic or a term called attributable rate.

01:14:48.778 --> 01:15:03.744
I've never heard Jessica Rose or Matt Crawford or Chris Martinson or Brett Weinstein or Dowd or Malone or meh, nah, I've never heard any of them.

01:15:05.238 --> 01:15:29.586
Mary Holland Never heard Brian hooker say that Attributable rate For attributable rates is the the Rate of the disease or the impediments that but let's say the disease or syndrome in the exposed group minus

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:34.878
the rate of that disease, the same disease, in the unexposed group.

01:15:34.918 --> 01:15:36.981
And that's the numerator part of the equation.

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:38.383
The denominator is something else.

01:15:38.443 --> 01:15:45.633
But in the numerator, it's the rate of the disease of the exposed minus the rate of the disease in the unexposed, right?

01:15:47.338 --> 01:15:55.347
Well, that means you have to have a study that looked at the rate of autism in the unexposed, meaning vaccine unexposed.

01:15:55.627 --> 01:15:56.888
You can make other claims.

01:15:57.189 --> 01:16:01.634
So that study, that last study that came out, can make a claim such as

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:12.437
you know, increasing antigens does not increase likelihood, increasing exposure to different antigens does not increase likelihood of autism.

01:16:12.477 --> 01:16:15.219
They can make that claim because that's what they looked at.

01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:18.682
They cannot make the claim that vaccines are not related to autism.

01:16:18.802 --> 01:16:19.923
They didn't look at that.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:23.966
They can't, it's, you know, this is a definition that is set in, it's a standard.

01:16:23.986 --> 01:16:26.267
You can't wiggle, there's no wiggle room for that.

01:16:26.467 --> 01:16:30.670
Does that sound like a lot of what James Lyons-Weiler says or,

01:16:31.731 --> 01:16:59.511
or or or no right it doesn't at all this is nothing like what does Suzanne Humphries ever no no that's it the AI says no um i just have it plugged into the microphone what about Robert Malone has he ever said no oh man it's it's really it's crazy i i i can't think of anybody else who's said wow nuts stop lying

01:17:01.058 --> 01:17:01.638
definition.

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:09.262
And anyone who's got a master's or a PhD, who studies statistics, public health, will tell you that's true.

01:17:09.282 --> 01:17:09.943
There's no balloon.

01:17:09.983 --> 01:17:10.883
This is the definition.

01:17:10.923 --> 01:17:12.924
You have to meet the definition to make that claim.

01:17:14.385 --> 01:17:22.209
The problem is if people read it, the media picks up on the news, which is, oh, another study that proves there's no link between autism and vaccines.

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:24.371
They don't bother to look at what it is.

01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:28.253
And so people in research might read it and just believe

01:17:29.053 --> 01:17:58.310
you know they don't bother to read the study but if they read the study they'd be like oh well they didn't really look at that they didn't look at the unexposed so they can't make a claim about attributable rate of autism to vaccines you can't attribute zero autism to vaccines because you didn't look at the rate of autism to the non-vaccinated you just can't make that claim it is it is it violates basic very basic rule of public health statistics okay thank you

01:17:59.537 --> 01:18:06.179
I'm speaking with Dr. Tony Bark, who has a private practice in homeopathy in Chicago.

01:18:06.459 --> 01:18:14.322
And I would just like, first of all, to ask you, how does your practice of medicine differ from most conventional medical doctors?

01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:27.452
Well, first of all, you wait 10 minutes to see me and then spend two hours with me, as opposed to waiting two hours for the doctor and spending 10 minutes with them if you're lucky.

01:18:27.712 --> 01:18:28.892
And I just want to preface it.

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:29.472
I'm an MD.

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:30.972
I'm a licensed medical doctor.

01:18:31.572 --> 01:18:34.813
My focus is classical homeopathy and nutrition.

01:18:34.993 --> 01:18:42.775
And I do something called Schiena, which is a reflex biofeedback looking at the autonomic nervous system and actually balancing the autonomic nervous system.

01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:46.336
My initial appointments are two hours.

01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:49.777
They often go over, sometimes two and a half to three hours.

01:18:50.937 --> 01:18:53.898
My follow-up appointments are typically an hour to an hour and a half.

01:18:54.839 --> 01:19:08.723
And I focus on looking at what is going on with the patient, what was going on in their life when their illness or disease started, and figuring out what pushed their system out of whack, out of balance.

01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:13.386
The goal is to get them off their medications.

01:19:13.446 --> 01:19:24.629
They come to my office, usually on a lot of drugs, not doing any better, because they're on all these meds, and they're still anxious, or they're still depressed, or they have severe autoimmune disorders.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.430
And they're not any better on all the suppressive medication.

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:31.590
And so I get people off their medication.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:32.470
We have to wean.

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:35.771
A lot of that is weaning carefully, because some drugs you can't just stop.

01:19:36.311 --> 01:19:39.852
But it's looking at the patient, and no stone goes

01:19:44.094 --> 01:19:55.304
I look at what the emotional thing was, you know, what was going on in your life emotionally, socially, environmentally, nutritionally, what kind of meds were given to you, what was going on when you developed this disease or this illness.

01:19:55.725 --> 01:20:01.290
If it's a kid, you know, I talked to the, you know, if they adopted a child, what do they know about the prenatal care or the,

01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:06.553
parents of genetic origin, if it was a mother, if I see a mother who carried the child, what was your pregnancy like?

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.455
What was the child like initially?

01:20:08.755 --> 01:20:10.656
Did they receive vaccines day one of life?

01:20:10.676 --> 01:20:12.618
Did you get a vaccine while you were pregnant?

01:20:12.658 --> 01:20:14.419
You know, what kind of drugs were you exposed to?

01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:16.981
So I call myself a medical investigator.

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:21.564
I, you know, I'm investigating what's going on.

01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:23.205
That's fantastic.

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:30.050
And underneath chronic, all chronic disease and all chronic pain is

01:20:31.249 --> 01:20:33.690
some amount of autonomic dysfunction.

01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:40.873
And I can address the autonomic dysfunction very first day in my office with my scanner device.

01:20:41.493 --> 01:20:49.316
So if they're in a hyper fight and flight and there's insomnia and anxiety associated with it or numbness and tingling, I can get rid of that pretty quickly.

01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:53.812
And then what I do is I do homeopathy.

01:20:53.852 --> 01:20:58.234
I figure out something, a remedy specific for that person based on the whole picture.

01:20:59.394 --> 01:21:00.695
And I look at their diet.

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:07.357
Because I look at, a lot of times, if you're taking certain medications, it's going to make you deficient in certain minerals.

01:21:07.537 --> 01:21:13.219
It's going to make you deficient in or require higher doses of certain vitamins for certain reactions in the body.

01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:20.042
And it can also, if you've got autoimmunity, chances are you've got very open, tight junctions.

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.570
Uh, leaking, you know, it could be leaking some thyroid.

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:24.871
Wow.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.651
Open tight junctions.

01:21:26.691 --> 01:21:35.815
And then she doesn't focus on the gut right away, but she tells you there are other tight junctions that could be leaky and causing problems.

01:21:36.295 --> 01:21:36.956
Dang.

01:21:37.876 --> 01:21:39.097
This is wicked bad.

01:21:39.457 --> 01:21:40.137
Wow.

01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:54.885
The blood brain barrier could be breached by the lack of vitamin D can do that exposure to heavy metals like mercury, lead, aluminum, some of which we get in our environment on a daily basis, some of which we get from vaccines and drugs.

01:21:56.365 --> 01:21:57.946
And so I look at the whole picture.

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:01.348
So two hours often isn't even enough time.

01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:07.331
And a lot of people who come in from out of town to see me will schedule a daily appointment for three days in a row and then leave.

01:22:07.851 --> 01:22:09.752
And so when they leave, they've left.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:12.334
They're a whole lot better already by the time they leave.

01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:16.457
And we follow up in Skype, or they fly back in.

01:22:16.857 --> 01:22:19.739
So that's how I practice.

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:26.223
It's very holistic, but it's also very personalized because no two patients are the same.

01:22:26.243 --> 01:22:30.365
Now, you might think that, oh, wow, but she's saying personalized medicine.

01:22:30.465 --> 01:22:35.309
But you need to draw back and realize that the

01:22:36.658 --> 01:22:57.411
multi-decade long human genome project operation had a forward-facing brochure level that they showed you on mainstream media and that Francis Collins played the primary face up for a while and then it had the national security part of it

01:22:58.649 --> 01:23:08.156
And the national security part of it is still rolling on long after they've declared, well, we finished it, or we finished it, or we really finished it this time, or now we're really finishing it.

01:23:09.437 --> 01:23:14.640
It's still rolling on because it is a national security priority.

01:23:16.261 --> 01:23:26.789
Because they're looking at the population pyramid and they're seeing that around the world, there is a once in a multi, multi, multi-generational opportunity to collect

01:23:27.748 --> 01:23:40.235
an unprecedented amount of data if we can build the infrastructure to collect it, if we can build the social and economic network to collect it, to mandate collecting it.

01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:49.501
And this was already 13 years or at least 10 years after the Human Genome Project was declared done.

01:23:51.104 --> 01:23:58.274
And then I guess Craig Ventner bought a sailboat and went collecting DNA in the ocean.

01:23:59.095 --> 01:24:08.828
This is a very dangerous person that when meeting with Brandy Vaughn, I guess made a very, very dangerous little

01:24:10.024 --> 01:24:15.769
I don't know, I don't know, but I know this lady's dead and I know Brandy Vaughn's dead.

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:18.712
I know they were both on InfoWars.

01:24:18.872 --> 01:24:26.199
I know they were in lots of pictures with Bobby Kennedy and with Mary Holland and with James Lyons-Weiler.

01:24:26.259 --> 01:24:34.527
I know James Lyons-Weiler made a memorial video for Tony and said at the end of the video, I love you, Tony.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:47.873
It's very dark where we are right now, but it's also dark in the sense of we're coming to the opening in the tunnel, finally.

01:24:48.614 --> 01:24:57.803
If you allow this, your brain to come to the logical conclusion of what happened here and how we got here.

01:24:58.826 --> 01:25:00.667
American history is available for you.

01:25:00.747 --> 01:25:01.487
It's right there.

01:25:01.728 --> 01:25:03.048
It's right there in front of you.

01:25:03.068 --> 01:25:03.929
...are exactly alike.

01:25:03.989 --> 01:25:12.854
While they might have certain underlying commonalities, they all have their own individual story and react differently to stress.

01:25:13.594 --> 01:25:15.295
Okay, that sounds wonderful.

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:34.245
Along the same lines, there's been huge coverage everywhere in the media about Paul Offit's latest book, Do You Believe in Magic?, in which he attacks alternative and complementary medicine, which I find so funny.

01:25:34.986 --> 01:25:36.627
You know, how many people?

01:25:36.847 --> 01:25:37.928
I don't have that one.

01:25:38.288 --> 01:25:39.529
Oh, do you believe in magic?

01:25:39.549 --> 01:25:40.390
I'll have to get that book.

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:45.313
Die on a daily basis from prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs.

01:25:45.793 --> 01:25:46.894
And we have no deaths.

01:25:47.014 --> 01:25:50.637
You know, like in the last few years, there's been zero deaths from the things he's talking about.

01:25:51.017 --> 01:25:55.020
And hundreds of thousands of deaths from prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:03.966
Are you telling me that Paul Offit in 2013 was already on everybody's radar as the opposite of, I don't know,

01:26:05.023 --> 01:26:07.226
alternative medicine, that's pretty remarkable.

01:26:07.707 --> 01:26:11.872
And procedures, you know, I mean, my God, procedures that are never approved.

01:26:12.052 --> 01:26:15.216
But of course, remember, Paul Offit was in front of Congress.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:17.499
Wow.

01:26:19.301 --> 01:26:20.042
So long ago.

01:26:20.998 --> 01:26:24.622
procedures aren't approved by the FDA, you know, but they're done all the time.

01:26:24.682 --> 01:26:27.765
Doctors do all kinds of surgical procedures, even if there's no controlled studies.

01:26:28.386 --> 01:26:35.533
So, do you believe in magic is a great title for talking about Western pharmaceutical medicine.

01:26:35.573 --> 01:26:36.254
Do you believe in magic?

01:26:36.394 --> 01:26:39.798
They all come with the side effect of the very things they're trying to achieve.

01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:42.661
So, an anxiolytic causes anxiety with long-term use.

01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:45.362
and that causes depression with longterm use.

01:26:45.683 --> 01:26:53.647
You know, um, statins will drive your LDL particle size smaller and denser, which increases your likelihood for a heart attack.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:57.329
Oh, she knew about statins in 2013.

01:26:57.789 --> 01:26:59.550
You gotta be shitting me.

01:27:01.211 --> 01:27:02.131
Oh my gosh.

01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:04.092
That is fricking remarkable.

01:27:04.112 --> 01:27:06.594
You know, all these drugs that,

01:27:07.406 --> 01:27:08.708
that do one thing, actually.

01:27:08.828 --> 01:27:17.220
I mean, Aseem Malhotra, the advisor for Maha, who was like, you know, a cardiologist, didn't even know about statins.

01:27:22.899 --> 01:27:23.780
have the same side effect.

01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.241
Look at these.

01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:28.606
Bisphenates come with a risk of fracture, of jaw and thigh fracture.

01:27:28.666 --> 01:27:38.498
You're taking it for osteoporosis, which has been marketed as this new disease in the last 30 years, and it's causing an outbreak of spontaneous fractures.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:40.701
I love that.

01:27:40.901 --> 01:27:42.202
I love that Paul Offit did this.

01:27:42.262 --> 01:27:43.382
It brought such attention to it.

01:27:43.402 --> 01:27:44.823
I think it's backfiring on him.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.405
I mean, he is not an industry outsider.

01:27:47.425 --> 01:27:48.746
He's an industry insider.

01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:50.367
He wants to sell his book.

01:27:50.828 --> 01:28:00.234
He's had the luxury of having these jobs where he's going to pay huge amounts of money for being a spokesperson for the industry.

01:28:00.995 --> 01:28:04.677
And I think people who kind of didn't know who he was and

01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:08.672
Maybe he thought he was a good guy.

01:28:08.692 --> 01:28:09.912
He's promoting vaccines.

01:28:09.992 --> 01:28:12.933
And read his stuff and say, who the hell is this guy?

01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:16.013
I mean, my father, who is pretty sharp.

01:28:16.073 --> 01:28:18.674
I mean, my father's really sharp in terms of health care and stuff.

01:28:18.854 --> 01:28:19.714
But he'd never heard of him.

01:28:19.914 --> 01:28:22.255
And he's like, oh my god, I read this article from this doctor.

01:28:22.315 --> 01:28:23.615
He's so way off base.

01:28:24.475 --> 01:28:27.136
He's talking about vitamins and minerals killing people.

01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:29.476
He said, my dad's been taking vitamins.

01:28:29.616 --> 01:28:29.936
My dad's 88.

01:28:30.737 --> 01:28:31.057
My mom's 86.

01:28:32.717 --> 01:28:33.277
Phenomenal.

01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:35.798
They have very, you know, hypertension.

01:28:35.818 --> 01:28:36.098
That's it.

01:28:36.118 --> 01:28:37.098
They both have hypertension.

01:28:37.118 --> 01:28:42.219
My dad takes the lowest amount of meds, you know, because of his hypertension.

01:28:42.239 --> 01:28:44.859
It's kind of a little frightening, right?

01:28:44.899 --> 01:28:48.200
Because we know that right before she died, I think her parents died.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.120
I don't know the exact time frame.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.480
It's, this is crazy.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.321
They have their own homeopathic kit.

01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:55.081
They use their own vitamins.

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:56.841
My dad's been taking vitamins since he was 16.

01:28:56.881 --> 01:28:58.902
I know this is anecdotal, but I have to tell you that

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:03.704
I measure people's intracellular levels of vitamins, minerals, and cofactors.

01:29:03.724 --> 01:29:05.224
And there are people who are deficient.

01:29:05.524 --> 01:29:14.388
We see iodine deficiency all the time, B12, vitamin D, glutathione, low glutathione, especially in kids on the spectrum.

01:29:14.948 --> 01:29:16.469
And they do much better.

01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:18.230
Oh, and magnesium and potassium.

01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:27.394
I mean, I have a lot of patients who do so much better with the addition of vitamins or minerals or supplements.

01:29:28.646 --> 01:29:33.388
And he is so outrageous that good, good for him.

01:29:33.428 --> 01:29:38.810
Because honestly, I think he brought a flashing neon sign over his name and people are looking at him and going, really?

01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.890
Huh?

01:29:40.131 --> 01:29:41.051
What's your background?

01:29:41.212 --> 01:29:42.632
Oh, you're an industry insider.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:43.973
You might have something to gain from this.

01:29:44.293 --> 01:29:46.274
So she's been slapping him around since 2013.

01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:54.958
That's pretty remarkable.

01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:57.179
I need a Tony Bark t-shirt or something.

01:29:58.906 --> 01:30:02.949
Okay, I'm continuing my talk here with Dr. Bark.

01:30:03.389 --> 01:30:12.596
And finally, I would just like to ask, as a physician, knowing the doctors that you know, do doctors really believe everything is fine?

01:30:12.996 --> 01:30:22.763
Or do they privately acknowledge that medical decisions, including what vaccinations are given, are being dictated by the companies making a profit from them?

01:30:25.665 --> 01:30:26.806
That's a good question.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:27.687
And

01:30:28.385 --> 01:30:45.331
You know, I don't know the answer other than there are certainly doctors who I see their belief in medicine, in modern medicine and the pharmaceutical industry as a religion, because they take things at face value.

01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:50.193
And I talked to enough doctors to know that they'll say things adamantly.

01:30:50.673 --> 01:30:53.574
And then when I question them, they actually don't know the research.

01:30:53.634 --> 01:30:55.714
They don't understand how the drug works.

01:30:58.362 --> 01:30:59.343
I'll point that out to them.

01:31:00.383 --> 01:31:08.609
And when I tell them that there is this level of corruption, they actually, a lot of doctors are very clueless about that.

01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:13.472
Now, there's plenty of doctors who are sharp, who see the corruption, who get it.

01:31:14.312 --> 01:31:23.778
But I would say a lot of doctors, a lot of people go into medicine because they want a nice, steady, consistent job.

01:31:23.838 --> 01:31:25.399
They don't want to have to think too much.

01:31:30.487 --> 01:31:41.236
The practice of medicine, if you're a clinician and you have a busy clinic, and especially if you specialize, it's a lot of reflex behavior on the part of the doctor.

01:31:41.256 --> 01:31:42.317
You have this, you get this drug.

01:31:42.537 --> 01:31:43.498
You have this, you get this drug.

01:31:43.538 --> 01:31:47.081
You have this, oh, you have this, it doesn't follow that flow chart, so we'll do this instead.

01:31:47.141 --> 01:31:52.105
Now, of course, there's creative doctors and there's doctors who think, but you don't have to think to be a doctor.

01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:53.847
You don't have to analyze and have critical thought.

01:31:54.341 --> 01:31:55.882
She is very big problem.

01:31:56.863 --> 01:31:59.064
She is a giant problem.

01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:01.085
And I mean that really seriously.

01:32:01.166 --> 01:32:02.967
You don't have to have critical thought.

01:32:03.167 --> 01:32:09.151
You have to have a very good memory in order to pass medical school and boards, but you don't have to have much in the way of critical thought.

01:32:09.171 --> 01:32:09.891
And, um,

01:32:11.641 --> 01:32:13.502
A lot of doctors don't have to.

01:32:13.623 --> 01:32:16.264
You actually don't have to have a lot of critical thought either.

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:27.553
If Robert Malone and other people have been providing a script with a couple different alternatives to discuss and a couple dumb questions to repeat, you don't have to have any critical thought either.

01:32:28.325 --> 01:32:28.865
critical thought.

01:32:28.885 --> 01:32:31.787
They order a lot of tests for anything that comes their way.

01:32:32.187 --> 01:32:48.478
They can't discern what's going on and they don't want to know what's going on in terms of corruption with drug companies and studies because if they knew, they would have to do something to change the way they practice or they'd be ego dystonic, right?

01:32:48.518 --> 01:32:52.200
They would be like, oh, I can't continue to practice this way because

01:32:53.174 --> 01:32:53.674
It's wrong.

01:32:54.494 --> 01:32:56.575
And if they admit that, that means they have to make changes.

01:32:56.635 --> 01:33:01.417
And there's just a lot of people who can't change.

01:33:01.437 --> 01:33:02.557
You know, they can't make changes.

01:33:02.597 --> 01:33:03.378
It's too disruptive.

01:33:03.418 --> 01:33:04.198
It's too stressful.

01:33:04.658 --> 01:33:08.359
They don't, you know, if for them change is scary and it's just too much work.

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.240
I've literally had doctors tell me, I don't want to know.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.821
I don't want to know the whole thing about the vaccines.

01:33:12.841 --> 01:33:14.922
Cause if I knew I had to change the way I practice and I don't.

01:33:14.942 --> 01:33:15.682
There you go.

01:33:16.862 --> 01:33:20.444
What a horrible truth that is to realize that adults are like that.

01:33:21.311 --> 01:33:23.554
You want to believe that they're not, but they are.

01:33:23.734 --> 01:33:28.920
That's the real truth.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.864
In 2013, she was already wiping the floor with these people.

01:33:32.284 --> 01:33:37.891
I've had other doctors tell me, you know, I know there's problems, but I don't have the time to get involved.

01:33:38.211 --> 01:33:40.875
So those are the people that don't connect.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.062
how you eat affects how you feel.

01:33:46.122 --> 01:33:55.088
They don't believe that what you put in your body affects you, except unless, oh, of course, unless it's a patented pharmaceutical drug, then they believe in it.

01:33:55.388 --> 01:34:00.311
So there's a lot of disconnection going on, but people in our society are disconnected.

01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:04.533
I think doctors- How's that for a nice explanation for why they're disconnected?

01:34:04.573 --> 01:34:10.917
You think that a pill can have effects, but you don't think the food that you put in your mouth in the same hole has any effects?

01:34:12.257 --> 01:34:19.259
you know, probably represent the same amount of disconnection as somebody who's in the corporate world.

01:34:19.399 --> 01:34:27.161
I think in order to work in large corporate entities, you know, where anything that big loses its moral compass, you have to be disconnected.

01:34:27.581 --> 01:34:29.501
You have to be, or you'd be egotistonic.

01:34:29.561 --> 01:34:32.242
You would have a problem with how you behave in the world.

01:34:32.802 --> 01:34:35.503
that you're contributing to problems.

01:34:36.664 --> 01:34:52.752
I don't think anyone consciously wants to contribute to problems but they can remain unconscious because if they're man would this lady be a problem if she had like a popular podcast or something you know if she was like Sam Bailey and all over the internet with a great camera

01:34:53.757 --> 01:34:58.442
And good lighting, boy, she would really fricking be a problem.

01:34:58.782 --> 01:35:01.365
They'd have to change how they practice and they don't want to have to do it.

01:35:01.425 --> 01:35:15.821
So I think like any other field, especially in the groups of people who like comfort and maybe don't want to be too analytical and think out of the box, so it might be even a higher percentage, we're going to have a lot of doctors

01:35:16.201 --> 01:35:17.042
who don't want to know.

01:35:17.062 --> 01:35:17.602
They don't know.

01:35:17.622 --> 01:35:18.542
They don't want to know.

01:35:18.763 --> 01:35:22.865
And then you're going to have the radicals who went in because they wanted to change the world and help the world.

01:35:23.225 --> 01:35:23.906
And they know.

01:35:23.926 --> 01:35:26.727
And they're very frustrated with the system.

01:35:26.807 --> 01:35:27.988
And they think the system sucks.

01:35:28.628 --> 01:35:32.651
But those are the more radical types of personalities in medicine.

01:35:33.071 --> 01:35:34.692
And they're not as common.

01:35:35.553 --> 01:35:40.596
And I think that maybe you tend to see them more in certain places than others and in certain practices than others.

01:35:40.996 --> 01:35:42.757
But they're certainly not the cushy specialists.

01:35:42.817 --> 01:35:43.657
I can tell you that much.

01:35:45.216 --> 01:35:49.762
They're more, you know, the primary care, and they're maybe at the county hospitals, and they know the problems.

01:35:49.823 --> 01:35:57.253
I mean, there's plenty of doctors who get that the pharmaceutical industry is really who's footing all the bill for research at institutions these days.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.336
It's not the government like it used to be 30 years ago.

01:36:02.745 --> 01:36:06.486
Yes, there are NIH grants, and there are less and less available.

01:36:06.606 --> 01:36:08.906
And it's drug company money that funds departments.

01:36:09.266 --> 01:36:11.967
And if you don't produce what they want you to produce, you don't get funded.

01:36:12.427 --> 01:36:14.927
So it's a problem.

01:36:14.967 --> 01:36:16.287
We have a big problem.

01:36:16.508 --> 01:36:18.668
We have a big problem in our system.

01:36:19.268 --> 01:36:19.788
It's bad.

01:36:20.088 --> 01:36:22.929
And it's leading to the illness, the chronic illness.

01:36:23.329 --> 01:36:24.149
We're colluding.

01:36:24.209 --> 01:36:25.669
The industry is colluding.

01:36:26.409 --> 01:36:29.490
Doctors and hospitals are colluding with the industry.

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:37.997
and the chemical industry and the food industry to create constant and long-term patients.

01:36:39.319 --> 01:36:43.983
Now I'd just like to ask Dr. Bark a little bit specifically about autism.

01:36:45.685 --> 01:36:49.589
Autism seems to be just one factor in the decline of our children's health.

01:36:50.549 --> 01:37:06.961
Do we need to stop talking about it as a separate issue, but also raise attention for the alarming increases in so many conditions from diabetes, seizure disorder, asthma, allergies, bowel disease, all the things that are plaguing our children.

01:37:07.001 --> 01:37:10.624
Do we need to look at all of these things as one issue?

01:37:10.644 --> 01:37:18.370
I think we should look at all of these things

01:37:20.103 --> 01:37:20.864
as one issue.

01:37:21.024 --> 01:37:23.766
And the reason I say that, there's power in numbers.

01:37:24.366 --> 01:37:25.307
That's one reason.

01:37:26.028 --> 01:37:30.071
But it's becoming a thicker and thicker society, right?

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:35.735
So we've got a lot of autoimmune disease.

01:37:35.815 --> 01:37:38.777
I mean, the immune community is mind-boggling, in fact.

01:37:39.658 --> 01:37:41.740
Why is there such a trend?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.781
And I see autism and

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:54.586
You know, it's on the same spectrum as for an obsessive-compulsive disorder, sensory, and a great of issues and pervasive, right?

01:37:55.267 --> 01:38:05.375
And so it really behooves us to band together as concerned parents, concerned academics, concerned people in the society.

01:38:05.815 --> 01:38:07.997
Why do we have such a sick society?

01:38:08.037 --> 01:38:12.681
You know, this isn't, you know, it's not, um,

01:38:13.517 --> 01:38:17.518
You don't have genetic outcomes like this statistically overnight.

01:38:17.538 --> 01:38:18.498
That's ridiculous.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:23.339
There are genetic predispositions to how you express being toxic, right?

01:38:23.419 --> 01:38:27.600
So, you know, there might be a genetic predisposition to how you express autoimmunity.

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:31.261
Some families will all have colitis, you know, also colitis or Crohn's.

01:38:31.641 --> 01:38:35.461
Other families will have asthma and eczema and psoriasis.

01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:38.982
And other families might have, you know, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

01:38:39.742 --> 01:38:42.743
So there's genetic, you know, predispositions.

01:38:43.263 --> 01:38:50.686
It almost seems like she's kind of hypothesizing that everything is basically an autoimmune disease, which I don't think is too far off.

01:38:51.707 --> 01:38:57.249
But you can still tell that from a biological perspective, she's not talking about a holobiont yet.

01:38:57.289 --> 01:39:00.671
She's not talking about polygenomic, you know,

01:39:01.738 --> 01:39:10.830
animals or talking about the idea that we're bigger than just our body or more complicated than just our genes.

01:39:11.331 --> 01:39:13.594
She's still kind of stuck there, which is okay.

01:39:14.194 --> 01:39:14.775
It's okay.

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:14.935
It's 2013.

01:39:16.926 --> 01:39:23.267
And I don't think very many people in 2013 were free of that place, that bad biology.

01:39:23.347 --> 01:39:33.469
So even in the context of that bad biology, she is pointing out so many of the things that if you don't see, these are all parts of the hamster wheel we're still in.

01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:42.170
Statins, and toxins, and vaccines, and the corrupt regulatory agencies.

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:46.231
It's the exact same hamster wheel, but it ain't her anymore.

01:39:47.725 --> 01:39:48.265
Forget that.

01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:50.007
You need to have environmental triggers.

01:39:50.387 --> 01:39:52.229
Why do we have to have environmental triggers?

01:39:52.629 --> 01:40:03.639
You know, the environment including not just the air and the water and the soil, but definition, things that are injected into us that have all kinds of crap in them that aren't studied with true placebos.

01:40:03.939 --> 01:40:08.703
We can't make a risk-benefit assessment because, you know, the risk, you can't make a risk-benefit assessment.

01:40:09.644 --> 01:40:13.107
And vaccines don't ever get compared to real placebos, right?

01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:15.609
So how can you make a risk assessment in that?

01:40:16.169 --> 01:40:34.122
Drugs that are- So she was saying the placebo argument in 2013, that means it goes even back farther, that nobody came up with the 30-day short-term trial to make sure that nobody is, you know, having an abrupt change from being healthy to not being healthy from vaccines.

01:40:35.443 --> 01:40:36.764
I find that pretty shocking.

01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:46.271
I find that absolutely amazing because it sounds like that sounds like a talking point that we can use and stand on for a long time.

01:40:46.371 --> 01:40:48.352
So we'll take that one, Tony.

01:40:48.732 --> 01:40:49.112
Thank you.

01:40:49.132 --> 01:40:52.353
We're not talking about GMOs and make America healthy again, are we?

01:40:52.373 --> 01:40:53.794
No, we're definitely not.

01:41:07.366 --> 01:41:10.428
that mice and rat models are not good with GMO.

01:41:10.568 --> 01:41:12.089
It's not just the, it's not the pesticide.

01:41:12.129 --> 01:41:16.931
It's actually the GMO grain itself is much worse for these laboratory animals.

01:41:17.412 --> 01:41:19.453
Oh, so it's not the pesticides.

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.354
It's that's so interesting.

01:41:21.394 --> 01:41:23.555
So that's so interesting.

01:41:24.356 --> 01:41:26.137
The pesticide laden food.

01:41:27.197 --> 01:41:28.578
So we have, um,

01:41:31.334 --> 01:41:40.398
We have a lot of what I would call microglial activation, probably from vaccination, but probably... Microglial activation, that's the immune system in the brain.

01:41:40.418 --> 01:41:49.862
Vaccination and a combination of things, but...

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.661
and can cause inflammation and activation of the microglial, which is the brain's immune cells.

01:41:59.062 --> 01:42:04.543
And when they're chronically activated, there's a lot of destruction and oxidative damage that happens in neurons.

01:42:05.003 --> 01:42:14.165
And oxidative damage, the reason that the brain cells and the nervous system in general is so predisposed to oxidative damage is that it's 60% fat.

01:42:14.865 --> 01:42:17.626
And fat's very susceptible to oxidative damage.

01:42:17.646 --> 01:42:18.866
You get lipid peroxidase.

01:42:20.087 --> 01:42:20.387
So,

01:42:22.122 --> 01:42:33.747
That is why the neurological system is so sensitive and declines in people that are exposed to environmental toxins that are greater degree than other systems in the body.

01:42:33.767 --> 01:42:33.907
This is 2013.

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:35.548
By definition, it seems she couldn't have met Brandy until 2014 or 15.

01:42:35.588 --> 01:42:36.769
This lady has it all in her bag already.

01:42:57.535 --> 01:43:01.996
She's already got such a successful practice that people fly in for three days.

01:43:07.577 --> 01:43:15.219
Because the government is embedded with the industry, with the food industry, with the gas and oil, the fracking industry.

01:43:15.479 --> 01:43:18.859
This is who is our government.

01:43:18.879 --> 01:43:21.160
You know, the government, we elect our official

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:35.614
Whether it's at the, you know, it's your local hill, or if you don't push this bill through.

01:43:36.154 --> 01:43:39.918
There next election cycle, so it comes down to.

01:43:42.323 --> 01:43:47.725
are basically representing, they're not representing our voice, they're representing industry's voice.

01:43:47.825 --> 01:43:56.668
And industry's voice is very happy with having a sick society because that makes those chronic customers, right?

01:43:56.768 --> 01:43:58.809
We are captive audience.

01:43:58.949 --> 01:44:05.832
You know, if people eat GMO and they become chronically ill, then they need medication and they need it chronically.

01:44:07.743 --> 01:44:11.426
That's a win-win situation for investors and the board, right?

01:44:11.546 --> 01:44:18.992
For whatever company, especially if you happen to have subsidiaries of your company, which is involved in food and it's involved in drugs and chemicals.

01:44:19.492 --> 01:44:21.514
I mean, it's really a win-win for the industry.

01:44:22.134 --> 01:44:24.476
And it's a lose-lose for society.

01:44:24.676 --> 01:44:26.457
And society is asleep.

01:44:27.518 --> 01:44:33.403
Either they feel like they can't change this or they're asleep and are very unaware of the

01:44:34.455 --> 01:44:39.338
control that all these industries have in running our government at the state and federal level.

01:44:40.659 --> 01:44:55.928
But a lot of us aren't asleep, and a lot of us aren't aware, and that's why I feel, you know, the Canary Party, some of these organizations, the Canary Party is a political party, it's great, and we need to get everybody involved and say we're going to elect our own officials to run for office, and they're not going to kowtow to

01:44:56.874 --> 01:45:04.419
to the pharmaceutical industry, or to Monsanto, or to the... She was gonna have people run for office?

01:45:08.682 --> 01:45:10.724
Well, that'll surely get her killed.

01:45:10.744 --> 01:45:12.085
You know, they're not.

01:45:12.385 --> 01:45:14.046
They're gonna work for us.

01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:17.169
Can you imagine if she ran for office?

01:45:17.749 --> 01:45:23.173
The people who are tired of being indentured servants to the pharmaceutical industry.

01:45:23.732 --> 01:45:24.773
That's who they're going to work for.

01:45:25.013 --> 01:45:26.274
And that's really what we need to do.

01:45:26.334 --> 01:45:37.862
So it's beneficial for all these chronic diseases that are becoming more and more prevalent, that are new, of the autoimmune disease that we see our children suffer from.

01:45:38.122 --> 01:45:43.746
It's really beneficial that we look at all of them under an umbrella and say, these are man-made diseases.

01:45:43.946 --> 01:45:48.890
They're being caused by our industry's interests and not our own interests.

01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:51.051
And so we need to change something.

01:45:51.071 --> 01:45:53.193
And that's the only way we're going to get at it.

01:45:53.962 --> 01:45:57.805
And you know, that's a lot different than a big top tent of health freedom, isn't it?

01:46:01.328 --> 01:46:07.513
That's a lot different than rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear, isn't it?

01:46:10.976 --> 01:46:12.818
And this is in 2013.

01:46:12.918 --> 01:46:13.518
She's dead.

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.021
And she's in photos with them.

01:46:18.142 --> 01:46:19.543
She was on stage with them.

01:46:19.583 --> 01:46:22.866
And when they took photos with her, she was in the middle.

01:46:26.052 --> 01:46:36.499
Her Instagram ends with pictures with these meddlers that I have declared to be meddlers before I ever thought of or knew of Tony Bark or Brandy Vaughn.

01:46:37.619 --> 01:46:39.400
I think they were both killed.

01:46:40.001 --> 01:46:49.707
Kind of along the same line as far as we are in an epidemic of autism, as much as officials won't admit it and how dire this is for society.

01:46:49.747 --> 01:46:51.048
Well, how can they not admit it?

01:46:51.168 --> 01:46:53.949
I mean, if you're a boy in New Jersey, it's one out of, what, 27?

01:46:55.531 --> 01:46:57.432
One boy out of 27 has autism.

01:46:57.472 --> 01:47:01.855
How do officials not, who doesn't admit we're in an epidemic?

01:47:01.875 --> 01:47:05.016
I mean, that makes no sense to me.

01:47:05.497 --> 01:47:08.818
When I was a child, it was one in 20,000.

01:47:09.039 --> 01:47:11.520
In the 60s, it was like one in 20,000, then it went to one in 10.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.142
Why is she still on the same, saying the same things that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:16.202 --> 01:47:19.324
said in his confirmation hearing, unless this is by design?

01:47:21.825 --> 01:47:22.706
It's a hamster wheel.

01:47:23.379 --> 01:47:26.960
You run really hard in it, and it doesn't go anywhere.

01:47:29.922 --> 01:47:34.824
If you don't run in their hamster wheel, or they can't make you a part of their hamster wheel, you get killed.

01:47:36.904 --> 01:47:38.125
Or at least they try to kill you.

01:47:38.145 --> 01:47:38.125
10,000.

01:47:38.605 --> 01:47:45.328
And then we had this huge jump after the happy was introduced day one of life into one in, what, 2000.

01:47:45.668 --> 01:47:52.491
I mean, that was that first giant jump that we saw, like, in the early, late 80s, early 90s.

01:47:54.388 --> 01:47:56.570
Who can say this is not an epidemic?

01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:58.292
To say that it's recognized better, really?

01:47:58.312 --> 01:48:00.294
Then where's all the autistic adults walking around?

01:48:00.394 --> 01:48:06.641
Really, if it's recognized better, and there's always been one in 27 men in New Jersey who are autistic, where are all those adults?

01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:10.365
You know that he ran for president on that.

01:48:10.485 --> 01:48:11.907
Where are all the adults?

01:48:17.529 --> 01:48:21.471
Ladies and gentlemen, I think they killed Tony Bark and I think they killed Brandy Vaughn.

01:48:21.491 --> 01:48:22.231
That's what I think.

01:48:22.471 --> 01:48:23.592
I'll be back in a second.

01:48:24.152 --> 01:48:24.952
Thanks for joining me.

01:48:25.493 --> 01:48:30.635
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:48:30.735 --> 01:48:31.435
Thanks for being here.

01:48:31.495 --> 01:48:34.877
See you soon.

01:49:08.085 --> 01:49:13.903
You might get hurt in New York I'll keep it here in my heart

01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:40.133
I'm going to Rochdale, take my rider by my side.

01:49:40.153 --> 01:49:46.896
Built that whole house because it's on the riverside, yeah.

01:49:47.116 --> 01:49:50.698
Oh, my baby, Lord, I said, you better stop me driving.

01:50:05.422 --> 01:50:21.879
Ž My baby good boy Ž Ž See my baby Ž Ž Tell her hurry up Ž Ž Ž I ain't yet known my right mind Ž Ž Since my bride Ž

01:50:53.864 --> 01:50:55.585
I'll keep them satisfied

01:51:23.091 --> 01:51:23.678
Yeah!

01:52:02.626 --> 01:52:03.112
See me

01:52:35.064 --> 01:52:38.968
Squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg.

01:52:38.988 --> 01:52:44.133
Squeeze it so hard I fall right out of bed.

01:52:44.833 --> 01:52:51.199
Just squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg.

01:52:51.639 --> 01:52:54.082
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about.

01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:37.359
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:53:37.839 --> 01:53:39.599
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:42.380
Isolation, what was it?

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.760
Isolation and purification.

01:53:45.481 --> 01:53:46.221
Of the virus?

01:53:46.301 --> 01:53:46.521
Yes.

01:53:47.761 --> 01:53:49.522
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:53:56.323 --> 01:53:58.805
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:53:59.465 --> 01:54:04.328
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:54:04.888 --> 01:54:07.130
I don't understand what the issue.

01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:12.713
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

01:54:13.794 --> 01:54:14.954
No, it depends on how they used it.

01:54:15.395 --> 01:54:15.695
Okay.

01:54:16.495 --> 01:54:18.637
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

01:54:21.786 --> 01:54:23.750
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:29.841
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:54:29.921 --> 01:54:31.945
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.620
And we are on the back half.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.141
This is the second half of the show.

01:54:42.221 --> 01:54:42.941
Welcome to it.

01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:48.442
It is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:54:48.482 --> 01:54:51.923
My name is Jonathan Couey, coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:54:51.983 --> 01:54:52.743
Happy to be here.

01:54:52.763 --> 01:54:57.044
If you don't know, my website is gigaombiological.com.

01:54:57.064 --> 01:54:58.444
You can find a way to support the stream.

01:54:58.464 --> 01:55:01.305
You can also send an email to gigaomhq at proton.me.

01:55:02.385 --> 01:55:07.728
And my wife will send you a notification that will be somewhat timely in the sense of either there's going to be a stream or not.

01:55:07.768 --> 01:55:12.191
But generally speaking, I'm trying really hard to make a 10.10.

01:55:12.751 --> 01:55:13.792
It doesn't really happen.

01:55:13.852 --> 01:55:16.793
Then I try to make 11.11 and that usually doesn't happen either.

01:55:16.813 --> 01:55:18.134
But I get in before 12.

01:55:19.515 --> 01:55:22.277
And if you can share, please share stream.gigaom.bio.

01:55:23.257 --> 01:55:25.739
because that is the website and host that we pay for.

01:55:25.779 --> 01:55:31.984
And also you can download lower resolutions of the stream and even an audio, I think.

01:55:32.064 --> 01:55:34.647
And if not, you can download a 480p version.

01:55:35.147 --> 01:55:40.511
It'll download really quick and then you can watch it offline, which is, I think, the way that this should be done.

01:55:40.591 --> 01:55:50.920
More importantly, you can find a particular episode that you really like, download that one and send that to your family and friends over email without ever having to send them to YouTube or Rumble or any of these other hellholes.

01:55:52.461 --> 01:55:53.642
Thank you very much for being here.

01:55:53.662 --> 01:55:58.586
I told you I wanted to look at this today, so I'm going to take it over over there.

01:55:59.607 --> 01:56:00.748
Busy week at the FDA.

01:56:00.988 --> 01:56:03.450
Yeah, we're going to talk about the three big panels.

01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:07.233
We heard from cell and gene therapy experts, patients, advocates.

01:56:07.753 --> 01:56:12.457
We heard from experts in infant formula and what things FDA should know about infant formula.

01:56:12.717 --> 01:56:16.280
And finally, we actually held our first CEO listening session.

01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.021
And you and I are going to go on the road next week.

01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:20.343
We're going to be in California and the week after in Boston.

01:56:20.663 --> 01:56:23.309
and we're gonna listen to CEOs to hear their concerns.

01:56:23.349 --> 01:56:30.325
So today- So the confidence with which this guy talks suggests that he was put in place.

01:56:33.444 --> 01:56:39.386
The confidence with which all three of these people talk suggests that they were put in place.

01:56:39.766 --> 01:56:43.687
These are not serious professionals in serious professional positions.

01:56:43.767 --> 01:56:50.330
These are not serious people with serious visions for the post that they purport to occupy.

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:54.111
These are magnificent posers.

01:56:56.212 --> 01:57:12.941
And they are the same kind of magnificent poser that you must see occupies the White House because otherwise he would have spent four years of the Biden administration planning for the budget that he was going to submit when he got into office.

01:57:12.981 --> 01:57:22.687
But instead he submitted no budget, which means that the budget that the government is currently running on is exactly the same as the budget ran on last year.

01:57:24.281 --> 01:57:29.445
you know, when the Biden administration was in charge and spending was at record levels.

01:57:34.108 --> 01:57:53.543
And if you don't see that for the malevolent, the malevolent lack of professionalism, a malevolent lack of foresight, a malevolent lack of actually any, any skills at all in the administration, you should, you, you really, I mean, you're just lost.

01:57:55.492 --> 01:58:01.694
because it's irrelevant who the surgeon general is.

01:58:01.754 --> 01:58:08.815
It's irrelevant if Elon Musk is gonna go to Mar-a-Lago for a barbecue now or ever again.

01:58:10.676 --> 01:58:18.978
If we have a president and an administration that can occupy the White House for five months and not submit a budget in their second elected term.

01:58:22.062 --> 01:58:27.068
We have a guy who's talking about cryptocurrency, but didn't submit a budget.

01:58:30.031 --> 01:58:41.544
It's supposedly a guy who likes knows all about business and a Mashner negotiator and has had all kinds of successful real estate and other business, you know, but he didn't submit a budget.

01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:52.903
His chief of staff is one of the most successful lobbyists ever to perform in Congress, and yet they didn't submit a budget.

01:58:56.164 --> 01:59:04.308
Supposedly, the last administration was occupied by a zombie guy who might be a, I don't know, a robot or a clone or something like that.

01:59:04.809 --> 01:59:12.653
And instead of submitting a budget, they just let Congress default on what that zombified president had proposed.

01:59:12.693 --> 01:59:15.314
You know, the one that had a vice president named Harris.

01:59:19.031 --> 01:59:21.994
And right now, these people are at the head of the FDA.

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.075
And what are they gonna do?

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:28.160
They're gonna tell you a story about how personalized medicine is already here.

01:59:31.543 --> 01:59:32.944
I guess we're gonna talk about all three of these things.

01:59:32.984 --> 01:59:34.906
Yeah, this is a listening FDA.

01:59:34.946 --> 01:59:37.649
We are on a listening tour and we're getting some really good ideas.

01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:39.350
It was a really energizing week.

01:59:39.370 --> 01:59:42.633
I just have to say, I mean, just to see all the great energy and ideas.

01:59:42.694 --> 01:59:44.075
I mean, I'm really excited about it.

01:59:44.502 --> 01:59:45.543
And this place run.

01:59:45.664 --> 01:59:49.409
An energizing week, like stop lying.

01:59:49.869 --> 01:59:51.251
I mean, stop faking it.

01:59:53.494 --> 01:59:56.839
These people have faked it until they made it.

01:59:56.979 --> 01:59:59.843
And now they're going to fake it because they made it.

02:00:03.735 --> 02:00:05.176
You gotta be angry about this.

02:00:05.196 --> 02:00:06.697
You gotta be upset about this.

02:00:06.757 --> 02:00:10.579
There was a Trojan horse exercise worked on us, an operation.

02:00:11.299 --> 02:00:16.342
And now we have a drug addict Truman show at the head of HHS.

02:00:17.383 --> 02:00:20.244
We have a DARPA employee at the head of CDC.

02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:24.547
We have a bunch of other people in government that we don't even know their names.

02:00:25.127 --> 02:00:26.728
And then we have these two people.

02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.349
Plus,

02:00:30.091 --> 02:00:36.110
a guy from Turkey at the head of CMS and a guy from India at the head of NIH.

02:00:38.547 --> 02:00:41.410
I need like a siren sound, an air raid siren.

02:00:41.590 --> 02:00:47.975
It's like 24 seven, like new announcements come out, you know, new approvals get released.

02:00:48.256 --> 02:00:50.658
And so it's just so energizing to be here.

02:00:51.178 --> 02:00:52.639
Beautiful day on the campus today.

02:00:52.699 --> 02:00:53.860
So great to be with you guys.

02:00:54.001 --> 02:00:54.381
Yeah.

02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:59.105
So let's start with maybe cell gene therapy because I think, you know, Vinay did a great job moderating that.

02:00:59.145 --> 02:01:00.847
There were a lot of great people in the room.

02:01:00.907 --> 02:01:03.549
We had the entire HHS leadership there as well, which is

02:01:03.948 --> 02:01:07.209
So powerful to see all the agencies talking about this issue together.

02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:08.870
You don't really see that often.

02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:10.550
But what were some of your takeaways?

02:01:10.610 --> 02:01:14.472
Well, the first success was we had 25 speakers and we stuck to time.

02:01:14.752 --> 02:01:16.873
So that was always a success.

02:01:16.913 --> 02:01:20.534
But we had, you know, 23 experts and we had our internal speakers.

02:01:21.235 --> 02:01:25.579
who came in and they basically told us different perspectives of cell and gene therapy.

02:01:25.599 --> 02:01:28.622
You have researchers who are doing the laboratory science.

02:01:28.642 --> 02:01:41.514
Now remember, cell and gene therapy essentially came to a screeching halt when a whistleblower by the name of Robert Wallace Malone blew the whistle with some chick by the name of Stolberg at the New York Times.

02:01:41.955 --> 02:01:43.256
How about Jessie Gelsinger?

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:53.064
And if you're following Mark Kulak's work, you already know that Stolberg was in front of Robert F. Kennedy not too long ago asking questions.

02:01:53.124 --> 02:01:55.105
It's all like it's one big show.

02:01:57.947 --> 02:01:58.667
Robert Malone.

02:02:00.488 --> 02:02:06.592
And now after the pandemic, of course, you know, this is all just normal because lipid nanoparticles are great.

02:02:08.233 --> 02:02:12.935
But don't worry, they're going to cover all of that in this wonderfully insightful podcast episode.

02:02:13.096 --> 02:02:13.676
It's crazy.

02:02:15.527 --> 02:02:16.928
Absolutely crazy.

02:02:16.968 --> 02:02:19.449
That underpins chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

02:02:19.469 --> 02:02:21.130
You have Carl June and Crystal McCall.

02:02:21.450 --> 02:02:37.379
You've also got this gentleman came from UC Berkeley who is one of the pioneers of individual patient bespoke, like custom tailored for that patient, gene editing delivered to a baby with a particular deficiency.

02:02:37.759 --> 02:02:45.661
And there was a big milestone announced this week, a big milestone day for the FDA and for this family and for gene therapy.

02:02:46.381 --> 02:02:47.341
Baby- KJ.

02:02:47.481 --> 02:02:47.921
KJ.

02:02:48.402 --> 02:02:56.763
So baby KJ was discharged from CHOP Hospital in Philadelphia after a custom- What hospital in Philadelphia?

02:02:56.904 --> 02:02:57.344
CHOP?

02:02:57.484 --> 02:02:59.924
Is that the same place where Paul Offit's been working?

02:02:59.984 --> 02:03:04.705
Is that the place where that billboard went up outside of CHOP?

02:03:05.145 --> 02:03:06.886
And then he kind of pissed off

02:03:08.366 --> 02:03:17.009
Paul Offit had some fake anti-vaxxer come and knock on the window of ZDogg's frickin' show in 2018.

02:03:17.429 --> 02:03:18.350
Isn't that weird?

02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:20.571
This timing is all strange.

02:03:20.671 --> 02:03:23.311
The people that are in the play are all strange.

02:03:23.371 --> 02:03:24.892
It's all like the same show.

02:03:25.852 --> 02:03:30.314
Gene editing therapy for a very rare genetic defect-based disease.

02:03:31.134 --> 02:03:33.035
in infancy, and it's really the first ever.

02:03:33.475 --> 02:03:34.176
It's the first ever.

02:03:34.256 --> 02:03:39.298
And the FDA was able to tailor the regulatory policy to enable this to happen.

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:46.241
Tailored the regulatory process in order to enable this to happen.

02:03:46.421 --> 02:03:47.121
Stop lying!

02:03:48.102 --> 02:03:51.123
Tailored the approval process.

02:03:51.303 --> 02:03:53.944
What in the hell is he talking about?

02:03:55.765 --> 02:03:56.526
Oh my gosh.

02:03:58.885 --> 02:04:02.866
I mean, Marty, you've talked a lot about this idea of plausible mechanisms and pathways.

02:04:03.006 --> 02:04:11.588
Custom gene editing therapy for a very rare genetic defect-based disease in infancy, and it's really the first ever.

02:04:12.028 --> 02:04:15.769
It's the first ever, and the FDA was able to tailor the regulatory policy.

02:04:15.789 --> 02:04:20.611
And so again, we are talking about, oh shoot, rare genetic disorders, right?

02:04:20.671 --> 02:04:22.071
That's the whole point here.

02:04:22.611 --> 02:04:25.752
It's what Mark did a little story about

02:04:27.227 --> 02:04:27.527
Where are we?

02:04:27.547 --> 02:04:29.708
I'm Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad.

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:53.662
What Mark did a little talk about a couple of days ago, and I tried to add on to that, that this idea of a rare disease, I understand especially well, because a lot of neuroscience is motivated under the pretense that there are certain rare diseases and disorders in childhood, most of them result in kids that die very early, that have some

02:04:55.182 --> 02:04:59.387
potential to contribute to our understanding of kids who don't die.

02:05:00.168 --> 02:05:07.417
So if I can be so bold as to say that autism is, interestingly enough, kids that don't die.

02:05:08.278 --> 02:05:14.024
And so that's why we focus on kids with autism, because we don't want to focus on the kids that die

02:05:14.912 --> 02:05:18.935
because then we'll figure out that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea.

02:05:18.995 --> 02:05:22.358
Then we'll figure out that a certain percentage of people actually die from it.

02:05:22.838 --> 02:05:42.073
Instead, what these people have been exclusively focused on for a very long time is of course autism without ever being able to define it, without even bothering to define it, without ever suggesting that autism is not a specific enough term to describe acute injection injury.

02:05:46.024 --> 02:05:59.291
And so now we've gone through the whole spectrum now where the predictions that we made a couple of years ago about the FDA being the target, we just thought they were gonna burn everything down to the studs because that's what all these people were saying a couple of years ago.

02:05:59.771 --> 02:06:12.758
It turns out they were just gonna put foreign invaders into these posts and to change the very way that these agencies enact or enforce their mandates.

02:06:15.287 --> 02:06:18.268
And so now safe and effective isn't even part of the mandate.

02:06:18.328 --> 02:06:18.608
Why?

02:06:18.668 --> 02:06:20.289
Because it's an individual thing.

02:06:20.349 --> 02:06:21.889
We couldn't judge.

02:06:22.090 --> 02:06:25.651
There is no safe and effective for an individual medicine.

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:35.655
And of course, these two traders, these two foreign placed meddlers, saboteurs, liars are gonna say exactly that.

02:06:39.776 --> 02:06:43.057
I just have to say, I mean, just to see all the great energy and ideas.

02:06:43.117 --> 02:06:44.498
I mean, I'm really excited about it.

02:06:44.946 --> 02:06:47.027
And this place runs, like, 24-7.

02:06:47.467 --> 02:06:55.049
Like, new announcements come out, you know, new approvals get released, and so it's just so energizing to be here.

02:06:55.569 --> 02:06:58.249
Beautiful day on the campus today, so great to be with you guys.

02:06:58.390 --> 02:07:03.491
Yeah, so let's start with maybe Celgene Therapy, because I think, you know, Vinay did a great job moderating that.

02:07:03.531 --> 02:07:05.231
There were a lot of great people in the room.

02:07:05.291 --> 02:07:07.952
We had the entire HHS leadership there as well, which is

02:07:08.348 --> 02:07:11.609
so powerful to see all the agencies talking about this issue together.

02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:13.270
You don't really see that often.

02:07:13.330 --> 02:07:14.970
But what were some of your takeaways?

02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:18.891
Well, the first success was we had 25 speakers, and we stuck to time.

02:07:19.171 --> 02:07:21.272
So that was always a success.

02:07:21.312 --> 02:07:29.975
But we had 23 experts, and we had our internal speakers who came in, and they basically told us different perspectives of cellogene therapy.

02:07:30.015 --> 02:07:35.736
You have researchers who are doing the laboratory science that underpins chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

02:07:35.756 --> 02:07:37.357
You have Carl June and Crystal McCall.

02:07:37.717 --> 02:07:40.698
You've also got this gentleman, came from UC Berkeley.

02:07:40.938 --> 02:07:45.300
So one of his gifts is that he can remember things and he can remember people's names.

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:46.660
He can remember lists of things.

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.242
Again, like Brandy, or sorry, Tony Barks said, you just need to be able to remember things to be a doctor.

02:07:52.763 --> 02:07:54.203
You don't need any critical thinking.

02:07:54.243 --> 02:07:56.244
And this guy seems to be very good at that.

02:07:56.284 --> 02:08:01.146
And that might be a very beneficial thing for someone who's required to stay on a script.

02:08:05.218 --> 02:08:17.463
who is one of the pioneers of individual patient bespoke, like custom tailored for that patient, gene editing, delivered to a baby with a particular deficiency.

02:08:17.783 --> 02:08:25.726
And there was a big milestone announced this week, a big milestone day for the FDA and for this family and for gene therapy.

02:08:26.426 --> 02:08:27.387
Baby... KJ.

02:08:27.527 --> 02:08:27.747
KJ.

02:08:28.447 --> 02:08:41.737
So baby KJ was discharged from CHOP hospital in Philadelphia after a custom gene editing therapy for a very rare... So this is really gross because again, remember we mentioned Jesse Gelsinger.

02:08:41.777 --> 02:08:46.640
Jesse Gelsinger was also attempting, they were attempting to edit a gene in his liver.

02:08:48.701 --> 02:08:53.925
And the reason why they're attempting to edit a gene in his liver is because that's apparently where the enzyme is.

02:08:54.065 --> 02:08:54.326
No.

02:08:55.393 --> 02:08:58.615
It's because that's where the lipid nanoparticles reliably go.

02:08:59.675 --> 02:09:24.029
And so unfortunately, many, many years later, after Jesse Gelsinger has long been dead, they're going to tell you exactly the same lie that they told you back then, which is that, you know, lipid nanoparticles and transfection might be pretty handy for a liver based disease because that's where they end up going anywhere, anyway.

02:09:28.113 --> 02:09:32.855
genetic defect-based disease in infancy, and it's really the first ever.

02:09:33.275 --> 02:09:33.975
It's the first ever.

02:09:34.075 --> 02:09:39.137
And the FDA was able to tailor the regulatory policy to enable this to happen.

02:09:39.398 --> 02:09:43.199
I mean, Marty, you've talked a lot about this idea of plausible mechanisms and pathways.

02:09:43.219 --> 02:09:45.500
So tell us, is this an example of that?

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.722
Yeah, it's basically the spirit of the plausible mechanism pathway.

02:09:50.263 --> 02:09:52.144
You can't expect to do a trial.

02:09:52.564 --> 02:10:05.271
You can come up with a mechanism of action that is plausible and also suggests safety based on the mechanism and based on other studies that can be extrapolated to this particular gene.

02:10:05.331 --> 02:10:10.714
So we are actually just telling you what we are, they are telling you what we already told you.

02:10:10.795 --> 02:10:13.136
I just didn't understand that they were just going to do it.

02:10:18.447 --> 02:10:20.190
I didn't understand that they would just do it.

02:10:20.250 --> 02:10:23.856
I thought they would have to discredit the FDA and destroy the FDA.

02:10:24.257 --> 02:10:25.559
But actually, of course they didn't.

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:30.548
They just had to put their people in there and change the discourse.

02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:32.331
Bespoke.

02:10:35.895 --> 02:10:37.336
What did he say the other day?

02:10:37.416 --> 02:10:39.297
Oh, there's that one word that he used the other day.

02:10:39.337 --> 02:10:39.877
I can't remember.

02:10:39.997 --> 02:10:40.917
Maybe somebody can remember.

02:10:40.937 --> 02:10:41.878
It was so ridiculous.

02:10:42.218 --> 02:10:44.419
An editing tool in this location.

02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:47.560
And the result is a pretty impressive.

02:10:49.081 --> 02:10:54.083
And the FDA was able to tailor the regulatory policy to enable this to happen.

02:10:54.403 --> 02:10:57.945
I mean, Marty, you've talked a lot about this idea of plausible mechanisms and pathways.

02:10:58.005 --> 02:11:00.586
So tell us, is this an example of that?

02:11:00.606 --> 02:11:04.728
Yeah, it's basically the spirit of the plausible mechanism pathway.

02:11:05.288 --> 02:11:08.350
You can't expect it to... That's... Oh, damn it.

02:11:08.610 --> 02:11:08.990
Sorry.

02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:10.571
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:11:10.631 --> 02:11:12.152
I'm annoyed because I have it now in.

02:11:12.752 --> 02:11:16.194
And before, the other video I didn't have in, so then it wasn't really working.

02:11:18.757 --> 02:11:23.320
I'm Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad, Sanjala, Jane, Nagpal, great to see you.

02:11:44.394 --> 02:11:50.756
So what I'm trying to say is that this isn't any different than the basic ethics that they used with Jesse Gelsinger.

02:11:50.776 --> 02:11:52.317
It was a plausible idea.

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:57.518
His life was shitty enough that I guess it's plausible.

02:11:57.558 --> 02:12:01.360
We might as well try this because worst case scenario, he's not gonna die.

02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:09.902
And yet that's exactly the same rationale that you use in extreme cases.

02:12:09.922 --> 02:12:11.603
Now we're talking about a baby.

02:12:12.927 --> 02:12:15.889
And they're really happy that they finally get to play with babies.

02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:22.574
Maybe because one of the arguments they made to the parents was that Jesse died because he was old.

02:12:23.715 --> 02:12:27.178
And if we could have got to Jesse early enough, the edit would have taken.

02:12:30.678 --> 02:12:31.919
I, yeah, that's right.

02:12:32.019 --> 02:12:32.600
Equipoise.

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.303
Related to this particular gene editing tool in this location.

02:12:38.004 --> 02:12:43.728
And the result is a pretty impressive outcome where the baby went home after.

02:12:43.748 --> 02:12:48.452
A pretty impressive outcome that the baby went home alive.

02:12:49.315 --> 02:12:53.300
We'll have to check in on him again in a few years and see if he's still alive and kicking.

02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:54.642
Maybe he'll be a chess player.

02:12:55.723 --> 02:12:58.747
That sometimes can be fatal because of this gene defect.

02:12:58.987 --> 02:13:03.993
So my understanding is this baby is born and by all accounts, the delivery is normal and the parents didn't suspect anything.

02:13:04.013 --> 02:13:05.315
But a few days after the baby's born,

02:13:05.595 --> 02:13:06.596
The baby is lethargic.

02:13:06.897 --> 02:13:09.900
I'm Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad, Sangela, Jane.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:10.881
I don't know why that happened.

02:13:10.901 --> 02:13:11.842
Great to see you guys.

02:13:12.883 --> 02:13:14.024
Busy week at the FDA.

02:13:14.245 --> 02:13:18.129
Yeah, we're going to talk about the three big things, quite healthy and normal.

02:13:18.409 --> 02:13:25.517
Doctors start to draw blood tests and they find that the ammonia level is off the charts high, suggesting a problem with protein breakdown.

02:13:25.917 --> 02:13:26.437
in the liver.

02:13:26.537 --> 02:13:36.403
They actually sequence the baby and they discover he has a carbamoyl phosphatase deficiency and they have a particular genetic mutation in the baby that's responsible for this condition.

02:13:36.463 --> 02:13:38.584
He remembers scripts.

02:13:38.684 --> 02:13:40.465
He's really good at it.

02:13:43.896 --> 02:13:46.818
In a world just a year ago, what do you do for a baby?

02:13:46.838 --> 02:13:53.765
You restrict the protein intake, you follow the ammonia level, you gradually try to wean him up on protein, you give him nitrogen scavenging drugs.

02:13:54.105 --> 02:13:58.949
I mean, you really just kind of treat the... These are three people that are paid six-figure salaries.

02:13:59.009 --> 02:14:03.213
This might be her primary job besides coordinating the farmer's market every week.

02:14:03.713 --> 02:14:04.853
the symptoms of the disease.

02:14:04.873 --> 02:14:05.934
You don't treat the root cause.

02:14:06.634 --> 02:14:08.555
And... With a big risk of liver failure along the way.

02:14:08.575 --> 02:14:11.435
And even with that, 50% of the babies are dead in a month.

02:14:11.595 --> 02:14:15.177
You know, it's a terrible condition, you know, even with those things.

02:14:15.197 --> 02:14:18.137
Yeah, and the liver failure will inevitably proceed.

02:14:19.338 --> 02:14:22.239
What these researchers did... Inevitably proceed.

02:14:22.279 --> 02:14:26.520
You see, this is a script that he's running, and now that's why he's got his hands on his knees.

02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:27.861
This is gross.

02:14:45.914 --> 02:14:50.377
antibodies against the gene delivery system because it is a sort of a virus derived product.

02:14:50.697 --> 02:14:56.020
But this lipophilic delivery, we don't have, we've not yet seen evidence of autoimmunity against it.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.263
So you can... But that's absolutely absurd because phospholipid autoimmunity is a disease.

02:15:01.323 --> 02:15:02.324
It's a known thing.

02:15:02.364 --> 02:15:04.645
You can also develop autoimmunity to the peg.

02:15:05.166 --> 02:15:06.967
That's freaking bullshit.

02:15:07.287 --> 02:15:13.451
And the fact that he quantified, qualified it by saying we have not yet seen... Stop lying!

02:15:15.299 --> 02:15:16.040
Stop lying!

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:17.020
That's crazy.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.162
That is some crazy shit.

02:15:19.562 --> 02:15:20.702
He is on a script.

02:15:21.083 --> 02:15:30.769
This guy is a malevolent player in a place in the government where he should not be because we are under attack.

02:15:32.739 --> 02:15:50.878
dose a kid many many times with different doses so that i think that's one advance it goes presumably to the liver edits the gene and now the baby he has declared that we can dose children multiple times with phospholipids and rna inside of them because of this

02:15:51.974 --> 02:16:02.142
He's saying that's an advance, but you just got through telling us that you had tailored the approval process because there can be no studies here.

02:16:02.182 --> 02:16:07.767
You can't learn anything because this is a bespoke tailored specifically for this patient.

02:16:08.127 --> 02:16:15.093
Then how the hell do we gain all this general knowledge about the non immunogenicity of the carrier?

02:16:17.711 --> 02:16:27.795
This guy is the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluations and Research at the FDA, and he is a lying, incompetent, traitorous fool.

02:16:30.708 --> 02:16:36.412
the baby's able to tolerate a lot more protein, and the ammonia level has fallen, the baby's healthy and discharged, and we see good clinical outcomes.

02:16:37.072 --> 02:16:44.177
What we don't have yet is this baby has been very vulnerable, so we haven't yet done a liver biopsy to prove that the gene is edited.

02:16:44.558 --> 02:16:53.004
I suspect at some point they will want to do that when the baby's healthy and strong, just to confirm that what we're seeing is in fact the reality that the gene has been properly edited.

02:16:53.504 --> 02:16:54.465
Now, what are the lessons here?

02:16:54.665 --> 02:16:59.007
One, FDA rapidly made available this product to this baby and the family.

02:16:59.627 --> 02:17:01.988
This product to the baby and the family.

02:17:02.028 --> 02:17:04.509
The FDA made this product available.

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.390
The FDA, the FDA, the FDA.

02:17:06.930 --> 02:17:08.611
If this kid dies, then what?

02:17:11.352 --> 02:17:13.433
If this kid dies, he won't die from this.

02:17:13.494 --> 02:17:18.236
He'll die of the flu or he'll die of something else because he was immunocompromised, I assure you.

02:17:18.836 --> 02:17:22.618
And they're going to get all the data they can possibly get from this kid after he dies.

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:29.652
We have allowed a drug to be given that can only be given to this baby.

02:17:29.973 --> 02:17:32.014
It is like a suit you had a tailor make.

02:17:32.114 --> 02:17:33.755
Speaking of which, we should talk about suits.

02:17:34.035 --> 02:17:36.497
It's a suit you had a tailor make for one person.

02:17:37.177 --> 02:17:46.923
And the question that we're going to face at FDA is how can we do this for many, many kids, everyone getting an individual therapy, and the usual regulatory thinking has to go out the window.

02:17:46.983 --> 02:17:47.443
That's right.

02:17:47.463 --> 02:17:52.206
The usual regulatory thinking has to go out the window.

02:17:54.724 --> 02:17:56.465
I mean, can I get an amen?

02:17:57.886 --> 02:18:02.989
Can I get a long distance high five from my brother, from another mother in Boston?

02:18:03.069 --> 02:18:06.991
Because this is exactly what we both predicted was gonna be done.

02:18:07.031 --> 02:18:09.092
We just thought they were gonna burn it down to the studs.

02:18:09.593 --> 02:18:14.976
No, they're just gonna have farmer's markets and put an Indian and an Englishman in charge.

02:18:16.415 --> 02:18:19.157
Did I hear correctly that it took about a week to approve this therapy?

02:18:19.177 --> 02:18:22.900
Yeah, I mean, we accelerated this as rapidly as possible.

02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:31.287
I think one of the reassuring things... I mean, he was looking at it under his, you know, he got the, he got his little microphone.

02:18:31.427 --> 02:18:35.070
It took me a whole week to figure it out, but I got it figured out now.

02:18:36.488 --> 02:18:36.828
Wow.

02:18:37.569 --> 02:18:44.214
That I heard at the meeting was that the FDA got a lot of praise for bringing this very quickly to the patient.

02:18:44.334 --> 02:18:55.123
And kudos to the career staff here that were hand-holding the family and the researchers along the way and involved and doing what we want to see more of at the FDA and that is

02:18:55.543 --> 02:19:09.611
custom tailoring a regulatory process to the condition based on the need, the unmet need in particular, and the individual situation and the relative safety profile of the intervention.

02:19:09.811 --> 02:19:16.595
And treating root causes rather than just masking the symptoms, which is a philosophy that you extend across all sorts of regulatory thinking.

02:19:17.336 --> 02:19:20.358
Oh my gosh, do you hear what he just said?

02:19:21.018 --> 02:19:22.119
Rare diseases

02:19:22.899 --> 02:19:45.424
treating them the symptoms of them is so old school it's so dumb we should instead try to treat the problem which is the genetic problem there's no moral discussion here at all this is now being like with a with a with a cognitive shell game trying to equate

02:19:46.363 --> 02:20:04.093
you know, like treating symptoms, you know, like they do with a lot of people when they're, when they're mid middle age adults, where they don't try to treat the underlying cause, you know, like lack of exercise or poor diet or whatever, you know, they just treat this symptoms.

02:20:04.613 --> 02:20:08.415
Now he goes all the way to saying that we do that with babies too.

02:20:08.455 --> 02:20:12.498
You know, these babies with these genetic syndromes, we just treat the symptoms.

02:20:12.558 --> 02:20:14.819
We never try to change the genes.

02:20:16.624 --> 02:20:33.114
stop lying wow i'm gonna play that again because i don't know if it's made an impression on you like it made on me but that is a freaking remarkably shitty thing for him to say being at fda including food and and the issues that are more discussed in the

02:20:33.174 --> 02:20:49.341
Kind of a big win for medical science, custom tailoring a regulatory process to the condition based on the need, the unmet need in particular, and the individual situation and the relative safety profile of the intervention.

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:57.024
And treating root causes rather than just masking the symptoms, which is a philosophy that you extend across all sorts of regulatory thinking at FDA, including

02:20:57.384 --> 02:20:59.805
Treat the root causes, finally.

02:21:00.385 --> 02:21:03.867
Why would we let these genetic experiments go to waste?

02:21:04.247 --> 02:21:07.508
We have the opportunity to fuck around and see if it'll work.

02:21:10.149 --> 02:21:13.210
Food and the issues that are more discussed in the news.

02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:15.071
Kind of a big win for medical science.

02:21:15.591 --> 02:21:16.451
Yeah, absolutely.

02:21:16.471 --> 02:21:17.092
And so that's just.

02:21:17.472 --> 02:21:19.993
It's not a win for medical science, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:20.013 --> 02:21:21.513
It's a win for bad biology.

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:25.875
This is the most malevolent thing I ever thought I would see on a Tuesday.

02:21:27.498 --> 02:21:31.551
I have goosebumps all over my legs right now because I was so stupid.

02:21:31.571 --> 02:21:32.935
I didn't watch enough of this video.

02:21:32.955 --> 02:21:34.179
I already thought it was pretty good.

02:21:36.914 --> 02:21:38.114
One of the stories we heard yesterday.

02:21:38.334 --> 02:21:45.136
And then we hear from people who are developing CAR T cell therapies that have resulted in the cure for historically incurable leukemias.

02:21:45.176 --> 02:21:54.278
Oh yeah, leukemias and stuff like that to completely different things where you can pull bone marrow cells out and play with them in addition and put them back into a body.

02:21:54.838 --> 02:21:57.799
Not talking about gene therapy for a fricking baby!

02:21:58.439 --> 02:22:01.622
But you know, he just juggles all these things because that's how he does it.

02:22:01.662 --> 02:22:08.788
It's just a big web of stupid simple and stupid complex and dumb simple.

02:22:11.158 --> 02:22:28.980
And because he's so good at memorizing a script, you know, you know, like somebody who's got like 20 years experience working on the robotics of molecular biology might be able to just spit out a bunch of terms and a bunch of collaborators and a bunch of papers and a bunch of discoveries and make it seem like it would be a hopeless task.

02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:32.982
for you to try and figure out how much of a lie the Human Genome Project is.

02:22:33.362 --> 02:22:49.009
This guy can also spray around a bunch of terms and make it seem like he's just a really precocious expert in everything, when in reality he is scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan to destroy the mandate of the FDA.

02:22:50.638 --> 02:22:59.844
from people whose own children or loved ones suffer from genetic diseases for which there is not yet a cure, but they're in vigorous pursuit of the cure.

02:23:00.384 --> 02:23:05.047
And I think we learned a lot at FDA about things that we could perhaps improve upon.

02:23:05.508 --> 02:23:09.710
We also got some reassurance that we had been going in the right direction, I think, on some of these issues.

02:23:10.251 --> 02:23:11.611
We at the FDA?

02:23:11.691 --> 02:23:13.593
You just joined the FDA.

02:23:13.673 --> 02:23:17.015
How is it already we, this kind of shit?

02:23:22.708 --> 02:23:43.435
You know what's really sort of shaped some of my thinking, if I'm being very honest in sort of how I think about regulation is, you know, the real question you need to ask is if they use CRISPR to insert this, how do they know that it accidentally didn't insert somewhere else in some of those liver cells and then knock out a gene that wasn't already knocked out?

02:23:46.296 --> 02:23:48.737
How do they know that some other change hasn't been made?

02:23:48.757 --> 02:23:48.777
I,

02:23:51.754 --> 02:23:53.196
I have a couple different ideas.

02:23:53.456 --> 02:23:56.099
One is that this story is bullshit.

02:23:57.220 --> 02:24:03.227
That they didn't actually do what they said that they did, but they're trying to tell you that they did so that they can claim it was successful.

02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:07.092
You know, it could have been a mosaic liver, for example.

02:24:07.152 --> 02:24:19.723
The kid could have had the phenotype, but it could have been mosaic, so that some of the cells are expressing the good gene from an X chromosome, and some of them are expressing a bad gene from the other X chromosome.

02:24:19.763 --> 02:24:24.407
And so, some of his liver cells are deficient in the enzyme, and some of his liver cells aren't.

02:24:25.268 --> 02:24:30.872
And so then maybe in that scenario, you have the disease, but you don't really have the disease.

02:24:30.952 --> 02:24:36.575
And so then, you know, the editing of a disease, you know, there, there are lots of ways that this could be trickery.

02:24:36.595 --> 02:24:42.299
There's also lots of ways that that kid could live to be six years old and then die.

02:24:42.339 --> 02:24:47.202
And they could just tell you it had nothing to do with this, which I think is far more likely the case.

02:24:48.072 --> 02:24:59.858
When you have to break bad news to a family and the person comes back with a response of, gosh, is there anything that we can do?

02:25:00.499 --> 02:25:06.522
When you have to give that bad news and you don't have any tools in the toolbox to be able to offer.

02:25:07.563 --> 02:25:09.404
So it just is so heartbreaking.

02:25:09.464 --> 02:25:13.126
It's the hardest thing about being a doctor is giving bad news to parents.

02:25:13.986 --> 02:25:23.631
If we just had gene therapy, if we had, at every hospital, somebody like Robert Malone using retroviruses to cure genetic diseases, that would just be kick-ass.

02:25:25.372 --> 02:25:26.913
It has an impact on you.

02:25:27.073 --> 02:25:31.215
I mean, emotionally, it, I mean, there's no training in medical school for this.

02:25:31.315 --> 02:25:36.718
It's the hardest part of being a doctor, I think, is breaking bad news, especially when it's surprise bad news.

02:25:37.438 --> 02:25:42.121
And you can't help but ask yourself, is there anything in the world that can be done

02:25:43.161 --> 02:25:49.623
still maintaining our mission to safeguard public safety that we should be thinking about.

02:25:49.763 --> 02:25:54.064
Why does it take 10 years or more on average for a drug to come to market?

02:25:54.964 --> 02:26:02.967
These are questions I think that we are asking as we ask ourselves, what processes here can we rethink and do smarter?

02:26:03.547 --> 02:26:07.188
Well, Marty and I are both oncologists, so we both had a lot of these kind of discussions.

02:26:07.868 --> 02:26:11.829
exactly as you say, it is heartbreaking for the doctor.

02:26:12.029 --> 02:26:15.270
Cancer is one of the shittiest fields in medicine.

02:26:15.870 --> 02:26:31.654
The idea that there are different groups of cancers with different, you know, causes and all that stuff is what allows all of that money to be spent on something that is probably just the dysregulation of cell division by toxic exposure or something like that.

02:26:31.734 --> 02:26:34.235
I'm pretty sure it's not parasites.

02:26:34.935 --> 02:26:36.738
Although I could be wrong, I'm open to that.

02:26:37.278 --> 02:26:49.115
I guess these guys don't think it's parasites and I'm sure they don't think that ivermectin and something else can cure all the cancers that it's apparently curing in our little circle.

02:26:50.677 --> 02:26:51.979
And for the patient and the family.

02:26:52.461 --> 02:26:57.606
when you get in situations where they'd be willing to try, you know, whatever options are out there.

02:26:57.766 --> 02:27:12.139
And I guess one other point to make here is that, you know, sometimes I see people say, how do you reconcile your philosophy on the COVID-19 booster shots where we've written about the need for randomized studies, but also a baby like baby KJ, where we're saying you're never gonna get a randomized study and it's okay.

02:27:12.359 --> 02:27:13.900
And the answer is just look at the differences.

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:16.082
One, a healthy 20 year old kid.

02:27:16.222 --> 02:27:18.784
He's using his stance on

02:27:19.645 --> 02:27:34.859
randomized control trials for the COVID booster shot as an argument for his understanding of the nuance of approving or facilitating the approval process for this unique bespoke therapy.

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:36.201
Stop lying.

02:27:36.801 --> 02:27:38.162
Stop lying.

02:27:41.311 --> 02:27:50.190
healthy person who has no medical problems, the burden of proof for such a kid is very high that they would benefit from an additional dose of a product.

02:27:50.819 --> 02:27:51.599
And sample size, right?

02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:52.180
And sample size.

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.542
And there's many, many millions of these healthy, you know, millions of people are healthy.

02:27:56.282 --> 02:27:59.384
Baby KJ, just one, you know, up 50% mortality rate.

02:28:00.124 --> 02:28:01.585
No ability to do a randomized.

02:28:01.605 --> 02:28:02.386
It's not even possible.

02:28:03.206 --> 02:28:10.330
Did anyone suggest, oh, you really should have done a randomized controlled trial for, you know, this gene therapy before you gave it to baby KJ?

02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:11.171
Thankfully, no one did.

02:28:11.511 --> 02:28:13.393
But I guess I just want to explain our philosophy.

02:28:13.573 --> 02:28:19.258
We're going to be flexible based on the condition, the frequency, how dire things are, how unique the situation is.

02:28:19.578 --> 02:28:20.559
That's not a departure.

02:28:20.579 --> 02:28:21.640
That's not an inconsistency.

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:22.821
That's just medicine 101.

02:28:23.041 --> 02:28:28.025
And I think it's a good harmonization of common sense and the gold standard of science, right?

02:28:28.105 --> 02:28:29.126
It just makes sense.

02:28:29.246 --> 02:28:30.748
Yeah, big theme, common sense.

02:28:31.028 --> 02:28:34.171
And so hopefully we can see more.

02:28:34.291 --> 02:28:35.512
It just makes sense.

02:28:36.953 --> 02:28:37.874
It just makes sense.

02:28:41.783 --> 02:28:43.084
More innovation in that space.

02:28:43.124 --> 02:28:44.285
We'd like to move it along.

02:28:44.325 --> 02:28:49.969
I think it's an amazing expert panel that I just absolutely loved and soaked every minute of.

02:28:50.029 --> 02:28:53.411
So I would encourage people to look at that FDA expert panel.

02:28:53.631 --> 02:29:01.016
Maybe just add one more thing about the expert panel before we move to the next topic, is that we also had the secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., came.

02:29:01.316 --> 02:29:02.777
We had Mehmet Oz come from CMS.

02:29:02.797 --> 02:29:04.399
We had Jay Bhattacharya come from NIH.

02:29:04.879 --> 02:29:09.322
I think I have never seen at FDA the NIH director, the CMS director,

02:29:09.822 --> 02:29:13.845
and the HHS secretary and the FDA commissioner all in the same place at once.

02:29:14.366 --> 02:29:16.748
So advocates not only got to say what they thought.

02:29:16.768 --> 02:29:19.710
Think about how much of a poser this guy is.

02:29:20.171 --> 02:29:24.114
He's been paying attention to the FDA for 20 years and I've never seen anything like this before.

02:29:24.154 --> 02:29:25.315
It's like never before.

02:29:25.375 --> 02:29:26.856
We're really doing a great job here.

02:29:27.436 --> 02:29:30.379
I have to say for myself, I think I'm doing a really great job.

02:29:30.459 --> 02:29:34.603
So great job that I'm willing to sit with my legs crossed and crush my balls.

02:29:34.843 --> 02:29:40.449
We should do better at FDA, but also what CMS could do about making payment for gene therapies where

02:29:40.868 --> 02:29:49.732
The gene therapy may cost $2 million, but that condition will be cured, and the health care system may save $4 or $5 million in lifetime health care expenditure.

02:29:50.052 --> 02:29:51.793
How do we pay for that in a regulatory environment?

02:29:52.073 --> 02:29:53.233
Dr. Oz was able to comment.

02:29:53.774 --> 02:29:56.015
What about somebody brought up the issue of organ transplant?

02:29:56.035 --> 02:29:59.816
How do we... Dr. Oz was able to comment?

02:29:59.936 --> 02:30:01.537
I mean, what does that even mean?

02:30:02.517 --> 02:30:03.738
What does that even mean?

02:30:08.237 --> 02:30:11.639
Former Turkish military commander was able to comment.

02:30:11.759 --> 02:30:14.461
What the... Increase organ supply.

02:30:14.481 --> 02:30:18.063
Well, of course, you know, tissues falls under FDA, but organs falls elsewhere.

02:30:18.123 --> 02:30:19.804
But we had Bobby Kennedy to listen to that.

02:30:20.164 --> 02:30:30.631
So we really assembled, you know, the audience you most want if you are somebody who's concerned about these things, so people could directly appeal to the relevant stakeholders.

02:30:30.871 --> 02:30:39.418
And I love that approach, right, a coordinated research, approval and payment strategy around a new therapy, because it's been so clunky.

02:30:39.478 --> 02:30:50.286
It's been so sort of, you know, parsed out and not streamlined that you have these situations where you have this great irony of

02:30:51.087 --> 02:31:01.355
a health care system that spends over $4 trillion, and yet a kid with a rare condition will be told, there is a treatment, but you can't have it because it's not covered.

02:31:01.956 --> 02:31:03.377
And so that makes no sense, right?

02:31:03.417 --> 02:31:06.859
In a modern world, we should be able to fix that problem.

02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:11.343
And it's not a matter of simply, oh, the insurance company is bad, they need to pay.

02:31:11.583 --> 02:31:15.846
Well, it's a broader strategy of how we make sure that there's access.

02:31:16.727 --> 02:31:20.909
And that includes financial affordability to a lot of these therapies.

02:31:20.929 --> 02:31:23.831
So that was a part of the expert panel yesterday, a great expert panel.

02:31:24.431 --> 02:31:24.832
I loved it.

02:31:24.992 --> 02:31:25.492
Learned a lot.

02:31:25.552 --> 02:31:29.634
This is sort of the exciting, fast growing area right now.

02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:32.116
And I think laboratory life sciences.

02:31:33.422 --> 02:31:36.364
So I got a lot out of it, and I'm glad we did it.

02:31:36.925 --> 02:31:39.486
Laboratory life sciences, what is that?

02:31:39.506 --> 02:31:41.468
That was a weird little comment.

02:31:41.768 --> 02:31:51.375
Hopefully, it lets people know this is a priority area for us, for you, for CBER, and hopefully we'll see more cool stuff coming, not just Baby KJ.

02:31:51.975 --> 02:31:57.359
And I think the secretary spoke with Baby KJ's parents, and maybe the doc, and the doctor.

02:31:57.379 --> 02:31:58.240
And the doctor, Chop.

02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:00.962
Yeah, and shared some of that conversation.

02:32:00.982 --> 02:32:02.303
And he had to say Chop again.

02:32:03.814 --> 02:32:05.537
Conversation at the expert panel.

02:32:05.557 --> 02:32:06.078
That was cool.

02:32:06.178 --> 02:32:06.859
That's amazing.

02:32:06.999 --> 02:32:10.024
Well speaking of babies, I think we should talk about infant formula

02:32:13.083 --> 02:32:14.263
That's why we love Sangela.

02:32:14.904 --> 02:32:20.086
So this is part of a broader initiative we have across kind of HHS around Operation Stork Speed.

02:32:20.486 --> 02:32:24.108
But Marty, maybe share a little bit about kind of why we're even talking about baby formula.

02:32:24.128 --> 02:32:31.511
Well, there's been I don't know why we're talking about baby formula either other than it's poison and that the whole idea of baby formula is just retarded.

02:32:32.031 --> 02:32:34.112
I understand that there are people who might need it.

02:32:35.123 --> 02:32:42.208
But I had, was fortunate that my wife and I gave, my wife gave birth to our boys in Norway.

02:32:42.808 --> 02:32:56.278
And the way Norway does it, in order to make it possible for most women to become successful breastfeeding moms, which of course is the most convenient way to be a mom, because then you don't need to make bottles.

02:32:57.058 --> 02:32:59.260
You don't need to carry a bunch of shit around.

02:33:00.821 --> 02:33:03.723
And also you bond with your baby in a way that

02:33:04.366 --> 02:33:08.148
quite frankly, I don't think any man could ever even imagine.

02:33:10.009 --> 02:33:16.953
And so that bond is completely not present if you're bottle feeding from birth.

02:33:17.033 --> 02:33:25.857
And so in Norway, just to give a good segue here, they have what is effectively a very nice hotel attached to every hospital.

02:33:27.278 --> 02:33:32.721
And after your first baby, they give you three days in that hotel with

02:33:34.359 --> 02:33:57.548
double room bed with enough beds for your kids to stay with you if you have a kid but no you wouldn't but that's what happened the next time because we asked for it but the first time for our first baby for Cherka we were in this hotel for three days now that meant that 24 hours a day

02:34:00.137 --> 02:34:11.361
If you had to change the diaper, if the baby wouldn't stop crying, if you couldn't get the baby to latch onto your breast, if there was any problem at all, you could pull a string and a nurse or a midwife would come to the room.

02:34:13.162 --> 02:34:20.225
And the most important thing was is that when those nurses and midwives came to the room, they taught the dad as much as they taught the mother.

02:34:23.007 --> 02:34:31.014
And for breastfeeding, that's actually really important because when a mom is all alone trying to figure out how to get it to work,

02:34:32.068 --> 02:34:40.875
If there's nobody in the room that has any coaching at all, has been told anything about what they're looking at or how to help, then how can they be expected to help?

02:34:40.915 --> 02:34:44.618
Are you supposed to watch a YouTube video and find out how to help your wife breastfeed?

02:34:45.159 --> 02:34:52.184
Given the fact that your wife might have giant breasts for the first time in her life, or might have the same breasts she's always had.

02:34:52.224 --> 02:34:52.805
You don't know.

02:34:54.906 --> 02:34:56.588
And so every woman is different.

02:34:56.688 --> 02:34:57.929
Every child is different.

02:34:57.949 --> 02:35:00.030
And for the first three days of that,

02:35:00.828 --> 02:35:02.268
Pretty terrifying adventure.

02:35:02.989 --> 02:35:10.931
Where they're having this little black kind of oily poop that comes out before they start the regular milk pooping.

02:35:11.871 --> 02:35:13.992
You have a nurse there to tell you what it is.

02:35:14.992 --> 02:35:19.754
And to hold your hand and to show you how hard you can push on a little baby.

02:35:20.834 --> 02:35:24.275
And the reason why I'm getting so caught up in it is because it was awesome.

02:35:25.233 --> 02:35:29.255
The only reason why I was such a good dad was because of that.

02:35:29.936 --> 02:35:31.637
Because I could also help my wife.

02:35:32.317 --> 02:35:37.880
I could see whether the baby was latched or not, and whether the breast was far enough into the mouth.

02:35:39.721 --> 02:35:43.243
You can't learn that without a nurse teaching it to you.

02:35:45.285 --> 02:35:50.968
And so, this, this breaks my heart.

02:35:52.546 --> 02:35:56.229
almost no innovation in the baby formula space since 1998.

02:35:57.670 --> 02:36:09.520
With the exception of adding selenium, the FDA has not updated its recipe for what you must include in baby formula for it to come and get sort of.

02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:10.461
And there's one recipe?

02:36:10.641 --> 02:36:11.642
There's one recipe.

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:13.243
The government issues a recipe.

02:36:13.283 --> 02:36:13.624
I see.

02:36:13.924 --> 02:36:17.707
This is what needs to be, you know, these are the criteria of the ingredients.

02:36:17.847 --> 02:36:23.749
When you say recipe, you mean kind of like you need to have X amount of this vitamin or these nutrients in these quantities?

02:36:23.789 --> 02:36:24.089
Is that a fact?

02:36:24.109 --> 02:36:26.230
It gets very wonky into the complexity.

02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:28.031
But yes, exactly, the ingredients.

02:36:28.291 --> 02:36:31.252
And so that is called a monograph, technically.

02:36:31.692 --> 02:36:35.114
And that's been sort of this system of regulatory approval.

02:36:35.534 --> 02:36:45.978
Well, if you have an idea to use a different fatty acid or a different non-seed oil alternative, then you

02:36:46.718 --> 02:37:04.242
you don't meet the recipe and so therefore it's very hard to come to market you have to almost submit it as a new drug and run a like a phase three clinical trial and run the whole thing so it's like we have got to promote and you know that's why i really like sixth girl in the chat because that is also something that

02:37:05.350 --> 02:37:19.754
It's just heartbreaking to think that women are coached and even economically motivated by, the doctors might be economically motivated by their hospital administration to encourage a C-section.

02:37:21.055 --> 02:37:31.318
And as Six Girls so wonderfully points out, if you have a C-section, then all the changes that occur during birth, they don't happen.

02:37:34.608 --> 02:37:42.513
And instead, you're the victim of an incredibly invasive and powerfully damaging surgery where they cut through your abdominal wall.

02:37:47.215 --> 02:37:58.762
And so, it is just an absolute abomination that a C-section is done for any other reason than the acute danger of a live birth.

02:38:01.084 --> 02:38:05.809
America is broken, ladies and gentlemen, broken in a very, very severe way.

02:38:09.352 --> 02:38:10.833
And we need to come to terms with it.

02:38:11.414 --> 02:38:15.858
These people are not going to, these people are put in place to make sure that we never even see it.

02:38:18.427 --> 02:38:36.928
more innovation, so there's more competition, there's more types of baby formula, and we can meet the demand that moms have in America to have baby formula with no seed oil, baby formula without corn syrup, baby formula without added sugar, baby formula without heavy metals.

02:38:37.168 --> 02:38:38.690
There is now an increased awareness.

02:38:39.671 --> 02:38:46.015
not just in the nutrition science community that we heard about, that we heard from in that FDA expert panel.

02:38:46.175 --> 02:38:52.319
Maybe a broader point here is that, you know, there are definitely probably ways to make a baby formula that's not good.

02:38:52.639 --> 02:38:54.400
Baby's not going to gain weight, not going to grow healthy.

02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:55.821
So there are lots of ways to mess it up.

02:38:56.181 --> 02:39:02.866
but we are not even close to having the audacity, like we have the audacity to claim that we have the perfect recipe.

02:39:03.127 --> 02:39:04.208
We don't know that to be true.

02:39:04.608 --> 02:39:09.372
It's very plausible that we can improve baby formula in many different ways through these sorts of substitutions.

02:39:09.852 --> 02:39:12.534
FDA doesn't know, you know, so I think we do have to allow that.

02:39:12.634 --> 02:39:22.302
Well, and we're also seeing that moms are buying baby formula from other countries because they feel those products are healthier or don't have some of these ingredients, and so I think there's a lot of desire for us to...

02:39:25.034 --> 02:39:27.155
He's what, the associate director of what?

02:39:29.816 --> 02:39:37.299
To think about this, and I don't know, I learned, I think there's a lot of desire for us to think about this.

02:39:37.379 --> 02:39:39.860
And I don't know, I learned so much.

02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:48.163
I mean, the fact that, you know, there were studies presented from the 1980s that were really compelling, and yet we really haven't acted on some of those findings.

02:39:48.183 --> 02:39:50.543
I saw that, it was like, oh my gosh, this study's amazing.

02:39:50.583 --> 02:39:53.084
And then it was like 1984 or something.

02:39:53.144 --> 02:40:00.445
It's like, how do we not, I assumed it just came out because it was so mind boggling, but I don't know if you're referring to the study on visual acuity.

02:40:00.465 --> 02:40:06.446
Yeah, it was a visual acuity study done with rhesus monkeys, and it looked at the seed oils, right, and it compared.

02:40:06.526 --> 02:40:08.487
It wouldn't surprise me if Vinay is gay.

02:40:08.547 --> 02:40:10.247
I mean, that's a lot of these people.

02:40:10.287 --> 02:40:11.227
That's Peter Thiel.

02:40:11.447 --> 02:40:14.968
I mean, you know, it doesn't seem to bother Elon Musk at all.

02:40:15.828 --> 02:40:18.111
I mean, it doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump at all.

02:40:18.191 --> 02:40:19.933
He hangs out with all kinds of gay people.

02:40:19.993 --> 02:40:20.393
It's fine.

02:40:23.797 --> 02:40:31.125
Not that I have any issue with gay people, but I mean, if you're going to pretend to be this macho whatever, why hide it?

02:40:35.430 --> 02:40:38.191
What about Peter Thiel is not hiding it.

02:40:38.291 --> 02:40:40.232
He's always hiding it that he's a gay man.

02:40:40.332 --> 02:40:42.532
All these people are hiding that they're gay men.

02:40:42.993 --> 02:40:45.353
And yet what is this rainbow shit all about?

02:40:45.413 --> 02:40:47.214
I'm sorry, I'm going to go off here a little bit.

02:40:47.674 --> 02:40:49.355
What is this rainbow shit all about?

02:40:50.135 --> 02:40:51.976
What is this rainbow shit all about?

02:40:52.156 --> 02:40:53.656
Let's think about it for a second.

02:40:53.736 --> 02:40:55.817
It's about whether or not you like penis.

02:40:57.718 --> 02:40:59.958
It's about your opinion about penises.

02:41:00.138 --> 02:41:01.599
Either you like them or you don't.

02:41:01.659 --> 02:41:04.700
You would like to have one or you would like to play with one.

02:41:06.189 --> 02:41:06.609
That's it.

02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:08.350
That's what that's all about.

02:41:08.410 --> 02:41:13.213
The rainbow flag with the little corner, you know, that's got the pink and the black shit in there.

02:41:13.613 --> 02:41:16.595
It's all about that because that's the same with trans, right?

02:41:16.635 --> 02:41:21.177
You're either, you think you're supposed to have one or you think you're not supposed to have one.

02:41:23.198 --> 02:41:27.521
And so you make it, they make it all about this, you know, it's gender and no, it's really not.

02:41:27.561 --> 02:41:28.681
It's just about one thing.

02:41:28.741 --> 02:41:32.524
It's about your preference for or about penis.

02:41:32.784 --> 02:41:33.164
That's it.

02:41:36.266 --> 02:41:57.294
So for me, this is starting to become beyond disingenuous now, when we have these kinds of people posing as biologists, posing as moral authorities, posing as really having thoughtful questions, when we can't even get down to brass tacks and actually talk about what these things are really about.

02:41:57.334 --> 02:41:58.854
And that's what that is really about.

02:41:59.254 --> 02:42:00.795
That's the biology of it.

02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:07.101
These people are magnificent frauds.

02:42:09.462 --> 02:42:12.464
Oil, to see how that impacted visual acuity.

02:42:12.564 --> 02:42:16.986
And you saw that safflower oil actually had kind of lower visual acuity than the soy oil.

02:42:17.086 --> 02:42:20.408
And so there's a lot of discussion about the right kind of fats and seed oils.

02:42:20.488 --> 02:42:24.470
And my takeaway was, well, you know, not all seed oils are equal, right?

02:42:24.490 --> 02:42:27.112
So there's different compositions of the fats and have different impacts.

02:42:27.192 --> 02:42:31.014
And there's the ratio of the omega-3s and the omega-6s.

02:42:31.094 --> 02:42:33.435
And so, I mean, there's a lot we can learn from that.

02:42:33.675 --> 02:42:39.461
It's amazing that the visual acuity... It's definitely not about families and kids.

02:42:39.561 --> 02:42:43.845
That's the most important thing to see about this fake rainbow flagship.

02:42:44.987 --> 02:42:46.949
It's not about families and kids.

02:42:47.149 --> 02:42:48.870
Pride is about yourself.

02:42:49.827 --> 02:42:51.428
And you're having pride about what?

02:42:51.808 --> 02:42:56.249
You're having pride primarily about your opinion about penises.

02:42:56.909 --> 02:42:58.670
And it doesn't matter what your opinion is.

02:42:58.730 --> 02:42:59.750
You have pride about it.

02:42:59.790 --> 02:43:00.450
You like them.

02:43:00.891 --> 02:43:01.571
You want one.

02:43:02.011 --> 02:43:02.811
You collect them.

02:43:03.251 --> 02:43:04.192
You wish you had one.

02:43:04.492 --> 02:43:05.612
You wish you didn't have one.

02:43:06.352 --> 02:43:06.772
That's it.

02:43:07.213 --> 02:43:08.333
That's what pride is.

02:43:08.373 --> 02:43:11.654
You have pride in your stance about penises.

02:43:13.993 --> 02:43:26.318
say on an eye chart, was lower for the primates fed when their mothers in pregnancy were eating safflower oil, low in omega-3s.

02:43:27.774 --> 02:43:39.864
And when the babies had the same safflower oil, low in omega-3s, and so one of the experts said, think of omega-3 as important for brain health, and omega-6 is more important for body health.

02:43:40.465 --> 02:43:50.833
And so there's actually this incredible data that shows that the types of fats consumed in pregnancy and in childhood affect your visual acuity.

02:43:51.093 --> 02:43:52.615
And there's a whole science to it.

02:43:52.635 --> 02:43:55.257
And when I read the paper about the photoreceptors in the retina,

02:43:55.917 --> 02:44:00.142
And, you know, one of the precursors of one of those molecules is linoleic acid.

02:44:00.923 --> 02:44:04.848
But I mean, how do I how did I not learn about that in medical school?

02:44:04.888 --> 02:44:06.730
We I mean, never once did we talk about seed.

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:09.253
How did I not learn about that in medical school?

02:44:09.293 --> 02:44:11.375
Not once did we talk about seed oils.

02:44:11.456 --> 02:44:15.941
It sounds like the same shtick that Casey and Callie Means are pushing.

02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:21.412
It's almost like they're all on the same malevolent, shitty script, oils.

02:44:21.472 --> 02:44:28.615
And how have we not tried to improve upon formula development and giving people, and giving consumer different options that are all, you know, safe?

02:44:28.895 --> 02:44:31.616
Because these regulatory guidelines have been pretty rigid, right?

02:44:31.636 --> 02:44:36.318
And just kind of putting out that monograph to your point, but there's so much more evidence now that we can build off of, right?

02:44:36.338 --> 02:44:39.639
So seed oil was a big piece of it, talking about the sugars.

02:44:39.739 --> 02:44:42.260
And so lactose came up, you know, I know lactose is

02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:43.401
kind of used a lot.

02:44:43.421 --> 02:44:47.304
There are a lot of infant formulas out there that are lactose reduced or lactose free.

02:44:47.324 --> 02:44:54.169
You know, what surprised me was that the expert, I think it's a war on the sacredness of life.

02:44:56.471 --> 02:45:00.814
I mean, you can say it's a war on God, but what is God other than the sacredness of life?

02:45:03.176 --> 02:45:07.640
You can go to an extreme and not step on bugs, like a Buddhist does.

02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:08.961
And I don't think that's crazy.

02:45:10.256 --> 02:45:13.477
Try not to harm anything through your whole life.

02:45:13.537 --> 02:45:14.658
I don't think that's nuts.

02:45:14.698 --> 02:45:18.339
I think that's an extreme view, but I don't think it's crazy.

02:45:20.941 --> 02:45:23.442
It's a lot better than whatever bullshit is happening here.

02:45:25.363 --> 02:45:28.864
It's a war on the sacredness of life.

02:45:30.365 --> 02:45:32.606
Life is now expendable.

02:45:33.466 --> 02:45:37.968
Life is just, it's just, it's nothing.

02:45:39.755 --> 02:45:42.137
And it's certainly not irreducibly complex.

02:45:45.499 --> 02:45:54.424
It's said that there are more infants who are consuming lactose-reduced or lactose-free formula than maybe what is medically necessary.

02:45:54.484 --> 02:46:00.729
And I think some of that comes out of how these products are being marketed to families to say, hey, this is gentler on the stomach.

02:46:00.769 --> 02:46:04.371
And so you have babies out there that- Which is not a substantiated claim.

02:46:04.511 --> 02:46:04.711
Right.

02:46:05.151 --> 02:46:05.371
Yeah.

02:46:05.432 --> 02:46:05.612
Right.

02:46:06.383 --> 02:46:11.126
So there's babies out there getting a lactose-free formula who probably could get a lactose formula.

02:46:11.326 --> 02:46:20.612
They've been, in some ways, a bit captured by the narrative that lactose-free is better, but it likely is not better, particularly if you can tolerate lactose, right?

02:46:20.632 --> 02:46:20.792
Correct.

02:46:20.812 --> 02:46:29.838
A lot of experts had commented, I think, that lactose is a very good, powerful, complex carbohydrate, important for infants in their development.

02:46:30.558 --> 02:46:32.819
And so you've got to get carbohydrates somehow, right?

02:46:32.879 --> 02:46:34.560
So I mean, fat, it can be a source.

02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:38.583
But also, a lot of people do not like the idea of corn syrup.

02:46:40.224 --> 02:46:41.324
This is not natural, right?

02:46:41.364 --> 02:46:48.048
This is not how in cavemen, you know, delivered babies, they didn't immediately give the babies corn syrup, right?

02:46:48.108 --> 02:46:52.391
So we have to think about what did they give their babies?

02:46:58.374 --> 02:46:59.195
It's despicable.

02:47:01.946 --> 02:47:05.927
not just what makes sense in a maturing nutrition science field.

02:47:06.647 --> 02:47:09.488
We didn't get the recipe perfect in 1998.

02:47:10.728 --> 02:47:12.449
And it's like, OK, we don't need to touch it now.

02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:13.749
We're good for the next 1,000 years.

02:47:14.109 --> 02:47:15.490
No, the field is evolving.

02:47:15.970 --> 02:47:17.530
We have a lot of learnings in that space.

02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:20.971
We heard from those experts at the infant formula roundtable.

02:47:21.718 --> 02:47:32.641
And the corn syrup piece is interesting, right, because as you know very well, you know, the impact on those added sugars early in life sets you up in the trajectory for a longer term chronic conditions, obesity, diabetes, all of that.

02:47:32.661 --> 02:47:38.842
And that was a lot of what the panelists were talking about is we have to get this right early on, that early nutrition is really important.

02:47:39.402 --> 02:47:42.203
And I just, the marketing piece of it on the labeling and the guide.

02:47:42.463 --> 02:47:47.728
Early nutrition is very important because you are a pattern integrative of the trajectory across time.

02:47:47.768 --> 02:47:52.072
And the earlier you get knocked off trajectory, the worse the outcome will be over time.

02:47:53.873 --> 02:48:03.201
And they're not, they're simply not saying that we have a biological mechanism for the passing along of nutrition and microbiota.

02:48:04.843 --> 02:48:08.546
Yes, bacteria are also passed along via breast milk.

02:48:10.799 --> 02:48:12.099
These people are monsters.

02:48:12.179 --> 02:48:30.085
They're either unwitting participants and absolute gunners just trying to do what they're told, because it's great to have a job at the FDA and I don't give a shit because I'm just climbing the ladder, or they're much worse because they know that they're engaged in an elaborate lie.

02:48:30.145 --> 02:48:34.387
They know they're engaged in sabotaging the FDA's

02:48:35.928 --> 02:48:39.770
long-standing mandate of evaluating whether something is safe and effective.

02:48:39.810 --> 02:48:41.992
What it says on the label is what it actually does.

02:48:42.032 --> 02:48:44.153
They're not talking about that at all.

02:48:44.573 --> 02:48:48.916
They're talking about all the times when, you know, that's not really possible.

02:48:51.037 --> 02:48:57.321
And all those times are genetic examples because this is the next stage of the human genome project.

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:01.802
I mean, sea oils is one part, the lactose is another piece.

02:49:02.182 --> 02:49:09.185
Another thing that surprised me was this, they were saying there were claims that this is basically equivalent to human breast milk, right?

02:49:09.225 --> 02:49:16.908
And some of these things are not actually, well, substantiated, or there were other claims around this formula can stop your baby from crying in 24 hours, right?

02:49:16.948 --> 02:49:21.030
Things that have no basis in kind of what the, in science or anything that's in the formula.

02:49:21.050 --> 02:49:22.210
That's right, most experts say that.

02:49:22.270 --> 02:49:23.251
She might be a dupe.

02:49:24.045 --> 02:49:27.406
It looked like they weren't very comfortable with that comment about breastfeeding.

02:49:27.446 --> 02:49:29.387
Didn't you see that in Prasad's eyes?

02:49:29.427 --> 02:49:30.007
That was cool.

02:49:30.247 --> 02:49:33.688
That breast milk is better for a baby than formula.

02:49:34.328 --> 02:49:45.812
And of course, that needs to come with the important footnote that some women cannot produce breast milk physiologically or for other reasons are not able to breast feed their babies.

02:49:46.032 --> 02:49:52.394
And so that's when we need to acknowledge that we need good infant formula options out there.

02:49:52.833 --> 02:49:56.494
Breastfeeding should be encouraged and supported, but can't be mandated, obviously.

02:49:56.534 --> 02:49:58.494
And that's what the CDC has been doing for a long time.

02:49:58.574 --> 02:50:03.256
Actually, in the CDC, I think it's the Healthy People 2030 goals.

02:50:03.636 --> 02:50:07.157
There are goals for increasing breastfeeding rates in the United States.

02:50:07.177 --> 02:50:11.878
That's been a longstanding sort of goal of the CDC.

02:50:12.058 --> 02:50:19.440
There's also the issue of the supply chain getting, when you have fewer options and less product competition,

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:21.763
You can run into infant formula shortages.

02:50:22.023 --> 02:50:24.687
Exactly, and of course that's what happened a few years ago.

02:50:25.353 --> 02:50:29.595
I think you have about four major players who control about 70 to 80% of the market.

02:50:29.655 --> 02:50:31.156
And so we need to see more options.

02:50:31.316 --> 02:50:32.097
See more options.

02:50:32.137 --> 02:50:39.341
At the same time, we want to encourage those companies to keep producing high quality infant formula because we don't want to see another shortage.

02:50:39.401 --> 02:50:43.883
Because there's a saying I know we use in the operating room a lot.

02:50:43.903 --> 02:50:44.364
You've heard it.

02:50:44.924 --> 02:50:46.425
Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

02:50:46.445 --> 02:50:52.208
So if we create these very stringent- Do they say that in the operating room?

02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:53.629
That doesn't sound great.

02:50:54.469 --> 02:51:01.011
standards by which now that infant formula issue, the shortage, there was also a contamination issue.

02:51:01.031 --> 02:51:02.572
Of course, that's serious and separate.

02:51:02.832 --> 02:51:15.677
When you have a just you don't have a lot of competition on the market and you have this supply chain that's sort of narrow, what you could see is that it becomes flimsy where it can be disrupted.

02:51:16.337 --> 02:51:18.679
with a single, you know, event.

02:51:19.499 --> 02:51:23.422
But the real story is, why don't we have more infant formula products on the market?

02:51:23.442 --> 02:51:30.628
Yeah, I mean, a misuse of government and regulation is always to overregulate a space where you're not really sure you're optimized.

02:51:30.668 --> 02:51:31.849
You know, that's always a misuse.

02:51:31.889 --> 02:51:32.309
That's right.

02:51:32.549 --> 02:51:33.670
Perfect could be the enemy of good.

02:51:33.730 --> 02:51:40.035
Of course, when people didn't have infant formula, they were using things that were terrible for babies, right?

02:51:41.158 --> 02:51:45.101
I don't even want to say them, but they were alternatives that no baby should be getting.

02:51:45.161 --> 02:51:51.547
And every year, there's some babies who suffer because the infant formula, people dilute the powder too much, for instance, and that can be quite dangerous.

02:51:52.087 --> 02:51:55.670
So there are clearly some important safeguards that need to be in place.

02:51:55.690 --> 02:52:02.136
But also, we can't pretend that we have, as Marty says, the perfect infant formula in 1998, and it can never be improved upon.

02:52:02.216 --> 02:52:02.736
Great points.

02:52:02.956 --> 02:52:03.477
Great panel.

02:52:03.797 --> 02:52:05.038
Encourage everybody to watch it.

02:52:05.198 --> 02:52:08.161
Again, FDA expert panel on infant formula.

02:52:08.841 --> 02:52:10.342
And this should be up now.

02:52:10.402 --> 02:52:12.143
I think we just posted it on our social media accounts.

02:52:12.223 --> 02:52:13.943
It's called Operation Stork Speed, by the way.

02:52:13.963 --> 02:52:15.024
YouTube good.

02:52:15.404 --> 02:52:15.884
Stork Speed.

02:52:15.904 --> 02:52:16.825
Now the CEOs.

02:52:17.345 --> 02:52:18.485
And they were the last to enter the room.

02:52:18.505 --> 02:52:19.386
They were just here last night.

02:52:19.566 --> 02:52:28.429
So this is our third event this week, and it was a CEO... I mean, they're patting themselves on the back for having three events and a podcast.

02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:29.390
Wow, they're busy.

02:52:30.966 --> 02:52:54.222
Roundtable sort of listening session with CEOs from pharmaceutical manufacturers big and small I mean we had the big some of the big players were in the room But some of the small players in the room people usually from the DC, New York area next week We're gonna on the west coast and then we're gonna go back to the northeast in Boston and then we might go to Atlanta by the end of the summer and We had how many people were there like 55 or 60 people like more seem like more.

02:52:54.242 --> 02:52:55.063
Yeah, maybe it's close to 70.

02:52:55.163 --> 02:52:55.183
I

02:52:55.983 --> 02:52:56.344
70 people.

02:52:56.544 --> 02:52:59.366
And we, you know, met with everyone there.

02:52:59.666 --> 02:53:06.812
We let everyone have the microphone, went around the room, and everyone gave one or two points that they thought the FDA could do a better job.

02:53:06.852 --> 02:53:07.713
Now, what were the ground rules?

02:53:07.753 --> 02:53:13.717
Of course, no one was about to talk about their specific medical product or their specific thing that they're working with the FDA on.

02:53:14.018 --> 02:53:17.961
It was about high-level, you know, pan-company kind of concerns.

02:53:18.461 --> 02:53:20.123
And we heard a lot of things in different domains.

02:53:20.703 --> 02:53:26.126
communication, ways in which it could be improved between the FDA and between the reviewers and then the company.

02:53:26.426 --> 02:53:28.347
And a lot of those points, I thought, were fair points.

02:53:28.367 --> 02:53:36.751
Yeah, they said like a five-minute call could save them two months of back and forth with letters or uncertainty or how do we do the application or what do you want in this clinical trial design.

02:53:37.411 --> 02:53:41.173
Very good points about increased communication could help innovation.

02:53:41.613 --> 02:53:45.597
But I want to double click into that because I think we experience this every day, right?

02:53:46.097 --> 02:53:49.981
Does anyone else gag a little bit when she says I want to double click into that?

02:53:50.021 --> 02:54:01.432
Do you want to stand up from your chair and kind of just like, I don't know, put your palm quite hard into her forehead so that maybe that chair tips over and falls out of the window?

02:54:03.095 --> 02:54:07.556
if I have a question, instead of me emailing you, I'm just gonna walk down to your office and it's much faster, right?

02:54:07.696 --> 02:54:15.897
And so I didn't realize that you have this interaction where sponsors are waiting, I think that, I can't remember the number now, but it was- Up to 90 days.

02:54:15.977 --> 02:54:16.517
Up to 90 days.

02:54:16.537 --> 02:54:17.918
There's a tiered system of communication.

02:54:17.978 --> 02:54:24.659
Yeah, where just, you know, they have a clarifying question that, to your point, could have been answered in two minutes, five minutes, and then 90 days goes by.

02:54:24.699 --> 02:54:31.100
And then to your ultimate question about why does it take 10 years, it's these little incremental kind of steps that they add up over time.

02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:31.900
They add up.

02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:36.642
So companies and developers deserve an instant response to their questions.

02:54:37.142 --> 02:54:41.623
And of course, we can't let them abuse it where they're calling five times a day with every little detail.

02:54:41.643 --> 02:54:46.065
But a couple quick response communications would go a long way.

02:54:46.105 --> 02:54:46.585
So we're going to work.

02:54:46.625 --> 02:54:51.386
So it doesn't sound like they're going to address any of the problems that, you know, Tony Bark identified in 2013.

02:54:51.806 --> 02:54:54.027
They're just going to make things work faster.

02:54:54.047 --> 02:54:54.947
Work on that.

02:54:55.167 --> 02:54:56.008
We're going to work on that.

02:54:56.108 --> 02:54:56.668
And then another

02:54:57.208 --> 02:55:02.571
big theme that came up was the CMC, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls processes.

02:55:02.951 --> 02:55:07.913
Now, this is sort of the nitty-gritty of how things are actually made and the quality testing that goes into FDA.

02:55:08.354 --> 02:55:13.436
And, you know, there's a depth of quality testing here that I don't think I fully appreciated.

02:55:13.676 --> 02:55:18.619
For instance, when you take a pill and you split it, you assume that half the active ingredient is in both halves of the pill.

02:55:18.959 --> 02:55:26.583
But we have people here whose job is to ensure that that's true, even if it's split in a different direction, that, you know, the active ingredient didn't precipitate to one corner or the other.

02:55:27.103 --> 02:55:29.325
So he didn't know anything about how the FDA worked?

02:55:38.134 --> 02:55:40.655
He didn't know anything about how the FDA worked.

02:55:58.024 --> 02:56:02.487
The products that we have in this country have to be the highest quality, sterility when necessary.

02:56:02.747 --> 02:56:04.028
We need to take these things into account.

02:56:04.048 --> 02:56:04.788
They are important.

02:56:05.309 --> 02:56:10.932
At the same time, I'm sure the industry has a point that our paperwork is at times overly bureaucratic.

02:56:10.952 --> 02:56:12.553
Too many forms and too much, you know.

02:56:12.613 --> 02:56:13.694
Pages and pages of forms.

02:56:14.675 --> 02:56:16.337
100,000 pages sometimes.

02:56:16.397 --> 02:56:17.698
Some applications have been 100,000 pages.

02:56:17.978 --> 02:56:23.063
And people say that's the reason why we can't review fast, because it's 100,000 pages.

02:56:23.103 --> 02:56:25.426
But then you say, well, why does it have to be 100,000 pages?

02:56:25.826 --> 02:56:30.170
We have to introduce a radical, innovative concept called the page limit.

02:56:31.111 --> 02:56:32.412
Yeah, we really do.

02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:42.820
I mean, I think that it's important to be, to have information available if you want to dig deeper, but to routinely read, you know, you say 100,000, but I've heard some applications are 800,000 pages.

02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:44.921
800,000 page applications to the FDA says this traitor.

02:56:44.941 --> 02:56:45.221
Not 100,000.

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:48.444
I've heard 800,000 page application to the FDA.

02:56:48.464 --> 02:56:49.624
I want these people in jail.

02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:02.983
I want them run out on a rail.

02:57:04.506 --> 02:57:09.435
I want them to be the victim of repeated rotten vegetable rain.

02:57:11.119 --> 02:57:11.960
This is gross.

02:57:14.345 --> 02:57:26.209
And it's this crazy perpetual dog chasing its own tail because the companies don't want to be stuck in a gotcha moment where a reviewer might say, oh, where's this information?

02:57:26.629 --> 02:57:30.671
So they figure just include 100 percent of every single thing they have.

02:57:30.791 --> 02:57:32.091
You know, it's like a medical chart, really.

02:57:32.171 --> 02:57:37.673
You know, sometimes when you get when you get the medical chart from the outside hospital and it tells you all these notes on what have you.

02:57:37.773 --> 02:57:45.320
Have you ever thought about the possibility, Vinay, that they would submit an 800,000-page application so that the FDA couldn't review it?

02:57:46.681 --> 02:57:58.532
And that if the FDA put a rubber stamp on an 800,000-page application, then that could set up a system where, effectively, applications couldn't be evaluated?

02:57:58.852 --> 02:58:03.297
And so that might not have anything to do with the FDA and their onerous requirements.

02:58:04.244 --> 02:58:15.027
But you seem to be very convinced, despite your lack of experience in what the FDA does, you seem to be very freaking convinced that it's all the FDA's fault.

02:58:15.628 --> 02:58:16.408
Stop lying!

02:58:17.128 --> 02:58:18.568
Stop lying!

02:58:21.489 --> 02:58:23.110
America, we are under attack.

02:58:27.403 --> 02:58:30.784
or she may have eaten six weeks ago and the blood pressure was on a Tuesday.

02:58:30.984 --> 02:58:33.105
It's not usable, it's just too much information.

02:58:33.245 --> 02:58:33.865
That's right, yeah.

02:58:33.885 --> 02:58:41.347
It's like the presentation in the emergency department where they take you all the way around the barn at the very end and has pancreatitis.

02:58:41.387 --> 02:58:43.507
You're like, okay, you could have started off like that, yeah.

02:58:43.747 --> 02:58:53.570
I think that's why I heard some of the CEOs are really supportive of us using AI in some of those administrative review kind of tasks where you can kind of help summarize many of those 100,000 pages.

02:58:53.650 --> 02:58:55.491
And of course, this week was the big rollout.

02:58:55.511 --> 02:58:56.631
For Elsa, yeah.

02:58:57.211 --> 02:59:04.714
So Elsa is our AI powered scientific review tool that the scientific reviewers use, food inspectors.

02:59:05.235 --> 02:59:09.657
And so they use that to help them with the scientific review.

02:59:09.757 --> 02:59:13.518
And sometimes it's summarizing a lot of that background information.

02:59:13.939 --> 02:59:15.399
Also, you know, our reviewers.

02:59:15.519 --> 02:59:18.821
It means that our experts are training in AI is what it means.

02:59:20.742 --> 02:59:25.005
It's probably not a private, it's probably a privately contracted AI.

02:59:25.085 --> 02:59:28.307
It's so, oh my goodness is it so malevolent.

02:59:30.211 --> 02:59:39.034
are very good at double-checking, sometimes triple-checking all of the data and making sure it is formatted or they reformat it into certain tables.

02:59:39.574 --> 02:59:56.059
And that was another piece of feedback we got in the CEO forum is the data in the tables could benefit from a standardized format where they are not spending a tremendous amount of time taking data and putting it in an FDA format when we have a tool that can do that.

02:59:56.559 --> 03:00:02.341
And then I think the third big category that came up was endpoints, control arms, randomization, when you need it, when you don't.

03:00:02.901 --> 03:00:04.881
And earlier in this video, we talked about baby KJ.

03:00:05.202 --> 03:00:09.503
And let's say, hypothetically, you have a child with an enzymatic deficiency.

03:00:09.843 --> 03:00:13.224
You know exactly what the gene is that's implicated in that.

03:00:13.604 --> 03:00:21.086
you deliver targeted gene editing, you see that the enzymes are corrected, the levels all start to normalize, and then later you biopsy the tissue and show the gene is edited.

03:00:21.466 --> 03:00:23.886
I think in those cases, we're gonna be complete.

03:00:23.926 --> 03:00:30.608
He's talking about a hypothetical situation that has never happened, but it might soon happen with baby KJ.

03:00:31.468 --> 03:00:36.069
And if other people are able to do this, then this is the script.

03:00:37.034 --> 03:00:41.322
This is the Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, human genome script.

03:00:41.862 --> 03:00:43.986
This is how they get rid of the FDA.

03:00:44.407 --> 03:00:48.915
By making this argument, by making this argument with these scripted bullshitters.

03:00:50.276 --> 03:00:51.936
America is under attack.

03:00:51.976 --> 03:00:55.937
...satisfied that scientifically you've proven that this baby is better off as a result of the therapy.

03:00:56.237 --> 03:00:58.138
N of one equals approval.

03:00:58.778 --> 03:01:09.681
But there are also cases, to push back a little bit on the industry, where some people went a little too far and told anecdotal stories about products, where somebody has a disease that deteriorates slowly.

03:01:10.021 --> 03:01:11.741
But of course, there's a range of presentations.

03:01:11.761 --> 03:01:14.442
Of course, some people will deteriorate faster and some slower.

03:01:14.922 --> 03:01:19.843
They administer a product that they say is responsible for a slower deterioration.

03:01:20.383 --> 03:01:22.386
But in that case, it's very difficult to know.

03:01:22.786 --> 03:01:23.487
Is it the product?

03:01:23.827 --> 03:01:26.451
Did you just happen to find somebody whose disease is progressing?

03:01:26.491 --> 03:01:32.177
So this is fake pushing back because this still presumes that there are cases where this is 100% valid.

03:01:33.579 --> 03:01:34.801
These people are monsters.

03:01:35.321 --> 03:01:36.042
They're liars.

03:01:36.262 --> 03:01:39.726
They're put in place with a script that's probably written by Kevin McKernan.

03:01:40.669 --> 03:01:42.432
and Robert Mueller.

03:01:43.193 --> 03:01:47.479
The same script writers that got Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:50.444
and the fake health freedom movement as far as it's gotten.

03:01:50.965 --> 03:01:52.767
But that was all the farther they're gonna go.

03:01:53.348 --> 03:01:54.811
This is the real Trojan horse.

03:01:57.168 --> 03:02:00.430
biological correlates along the way, it's harder for us to know.

03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:02.892
And maybe in those cases, N of one isn't enough.

03:02:03.432 --> 03:02:08.076
So this is sort of the nuance of science and regulation and understanding cause and effect.

03:02:08.616 --> 03:02:11.498
You got me thinking, if when I deteriorate, if I wanted to.

03:02:11.998 --> 03:02:19.403
It's certainly not, it's definitely not the subtleties of safe and effectiveness, right?

03:02:19.443 --> 03:02:22.285
It's definitely not the subtleties of safe and effective.

03:02:24.844 --> 03:02:27.106
We are at three hours, ladies and gentlemen.

03:02:27.246 --> 03:02:31.651
Mary Holland is a liar and her spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required.

03:02:31.911 --> 03:02:38.118
Or behind, you know, proper testing or behind the six foot distancing, the two meter distance, or behind these shots, right?

03:02:38.158 --> 03:02:40.160
This technology that has never been used widely.

03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:42.521
None of that is over.

03:02:42.621 --> 03:02:50.947
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

03:02:51.207 --> 03:02:53.869
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:58.512
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

03:02:58.572 --> 03:03:00.953
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin.

03:03:00.973 --> 03:03:01.574
I was fine.

03:03:02.975 --> 03:03:10.619
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

03:03:11.099 --> 03:03:12.560
All of that was on a global basis.

03:03:13.380 --> 03:03:15.362
All of that was not on a global basis.

03:03:15.422 --> 03:03:16.842
All the murder was in America.

03:03:16.882 --> 03:03:19.184
A lot of the economic destruction was in America.

03:03:20.020 --> 03:03:23.903
Mary Holland is a traitor to our grandchildren, without a doubt.

03:03:24.684 --> 03:03:37.774
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist where using their tests to find their ghost doesn't make you their ghost's real or you a ghostbuster.

03:03:38.235 --> 03:03:39.556
Thanks very much for joining me.

03:03:39.616 --> 03:03:40.877
I will see you again tomorrow.

03:03:40.997 --> 03:03:43.659
RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb.

03:03:44.179 --> 03:03:48.383
Transfection in healthy people was always a crime and the population pyramid is.

03:03:49.497 --> 03:03:52.179
It is the biological effect that you were not aware of.

03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:54.221
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

03:03:54.261 --> 03:03:54.882
Don't give up.

03:03:54.922 --> 03:03:55.583
Don't stop.

03:03:55.603 --> 03:03:56.363
I won't either.

03:03:57.024 --> 03:03:57.524
See you soon.
