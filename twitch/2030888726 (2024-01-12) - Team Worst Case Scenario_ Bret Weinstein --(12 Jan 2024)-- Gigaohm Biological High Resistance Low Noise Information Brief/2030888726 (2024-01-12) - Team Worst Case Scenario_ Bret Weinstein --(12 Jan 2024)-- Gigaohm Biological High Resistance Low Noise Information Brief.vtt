00:30.000 --> 00:47.720
garden variety human 953 Jeffrey how are you sir if I could get a sound check

00:47.720 --> 00:50.460
from one of you two characters I don't know if you're watching or just

00:50.460 --> 01:00.540
listening and we will get started watch her be yellow five by five says

01:00.540 --> 01:12.860
doubt ale and so does Jeffrey great great good I say good

01:12.860 --> 01:15.660
audios

01:43.860 --> 01:52.060
and I also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooey who some of you will know

01:52.060 --> 01:58.500
from his lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a bike journal

01:58.500 --> 02:03.300
club on a bike that he also has advanced a version of this hypothesis so I don't

02:03.300 --> 02:08.340
claim it to be unique I do think I arrived at it independently

02:09.180 --> 02:15.820
oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa oh timeout JC on a bike JC on the

02:15.820 --> 02:24.020
bike it's JC on the bike it's JC on the bike yeah well I'm wise enough to know

02:24.020 --> 02:30.660
when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one look at round it's JC on

02:30.660 --> 02:35.900
the bike who says Vader didn't study music in college

02:38.340 --> 02:59.460
where you know I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to so that's the best I

02:59.460 --> 03:06.180
can do without I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic

03:29.460 --> 03:48.020
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a

03:48.020 --> 03:51.940
worst case scenario I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing

03:51.940 --> 04:02.580
with essentially a worst case scenario I think it's a great question antibodies

04:02.580 --> 04:07.140
wouldn't necessarily cause MHC to be presenting foreign proteins that is

04:07.140 --> 04:14.700
true however maybe cells making antibodies that aren't supposed to make

04:14.700 --> 04:20.260
antibodies would still be a combination that would risk autoimmune disease that's

04:20.340 --> 04:25.020
a great question though Jeff okay but actually they're kind of cheating when

04:25.020 --> 04:29.700
they're calling these things vaccines and you know anything with really rapidly

04:29.700 --> 04:33.340
fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year you know Canada saying

04:33.340 --> 04:39.820
nine months is as actually JJ Coe's insistence and I think he's right on

04:39.820 --> 04:44.540
calling them transfections rather than the vaccines

04:44.540 --> 05:10.300
he's scheduled for 60 minutes next he's going on French British Italian Japanese

05:10.300 --> 05:18.620
television people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing

05:41.300 --> 05:47.500
or what I want is high morbidity I want people to complain so what do I do I go

05:47.500 --> 05:50.300
to Des Moines ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen I have nothing

05:50.300 --> 05:53.860
against Des Moines I live there for four years I go to Des Moines I infect a

05:53.860 --> 05:59.060
couple of Sentinel cases in Des Moines I go to Seattle I infect a couple of cases

05:59.060 --> 06:04.220
there I go to North Carolina I go to I gotta admit I don't know really how we

06:04.220 --> 06:12.820
differentiate from myocytes and endothelial cells all these cells where

06:12.820 --> 06:17.900
the transfection is most likely to be to occur and so if it's most likely to

06:17.900 --> 06:21.620
occur in cardiac capillaries then cardiac capillaries are directly

06:21.620 --> 06:28.700
opposite cardiac myocytes so I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying

06:28.700 --> 06:31.060
that anywhere where there's a capillary bed you're gonna get

06:31.060 --> 06:36.620
transfection and most likely that means overwhelmingly endothelial cells and

06:36.620 --> 06:40.900
then maybe in the heart maybe in the liver and other capillary beds but I

06:40.900 --> 06:47.940
think the the whole point of of transfecting endothelial cells is also in

06:47.940 --> 06:53.540
that same small area you're gonna also have platelets and other things where

06:53.540 --> 06:57.660
you just don't want to transfect those cells that's the problem so it's all

06:57.660 --> 07:02.700
there it's all up for grabs it it's definitely all part of the the

07:02.700 --> 07:07.260
possibilities that they're they're trying to obscure

07:07.260 --> 07:12.260
and as a consequence of doing that what I do is I create a schism between the

07:12.260 --> 07:17.100
polis and the public health system I fracture the integrity of trust and

07:17.100 --> 07:22.500
reliance upon the population and its government

07:27.660 --> 07:50.500
I have no reason not to engage with the amazing poly on Twitter I always let

07:50.500 --> 08:00.420
people disappoint me before I stop that I do have some some rules of engagement

08:00.420 --> 08:06.820
but certainly Paul is seems to be one of these people who understands the kind

08:06.820 --> 08:09.980
of monster we're up against

08:50.500 --> 08:58.420
I'm gonna talk about this a little bit tonight I want to bring this up a little bit tonight

09:20.500 --> 09:34.540
I would say be careful with disrupting human cellular evolution I don't know

09:34.540 --> 09:39.940
what kind of human cellular evolution you're describing but that's a pretty

09:39.940 --> 09:43.300
bold statement then I can disrupt anything they'd love for us to believe

09:43.300 --> 09:47.340
that they have screwed up things for the people that have been

09:47.340 --> 09:56.060
multiply transfected I think we have a whole host of possibilities I agree but

09:56.060 --> 10:01.940
the bricks are visible ladies and gentlemen I see the bricks the tables and

10:01.940 --> 10:07.380
chairs have been moved out of the way and they're not playing anymore I mean

10:07.380 --> 10:19.540
this is just just a rod mass right now I would have to agree that they

10:19.540 --> 10:24.540
hepatitis B at birth is one of the most despicable things that we do here in

10:24.540 --> 10:32.260
America I don't think the vitamin K shock can really be argued for either the idea

10:32.260 --> 10:36.740
that a newborn is born short of vitamin K and therefore it benefits from an

10:36.820 --> 10:42.900
injection of it is is pretty big assumption I used to be a patch client

10:42.900 --> 10:46.700
physiologists that's where the name Giga on biological comes from this is Giga

10:46.700 --> 10:50.380
on biological high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by

10:50.380 --> 10:57.460
a biologist you can find me at Giga on biological.com and Giga home dot bio you

10:57.460 --> 11:02.020
can find my confession at the Scooby link you can find a place to support with

11:02.020 --> 11:08.020
one-time donations a way to watch the brief you can download my stream deck

11:08.020 --> 11:12.700
the new one will be available next week you can leave me a voicemail or email

11:12.700 --> 11:19.620
and you can become a subscriber and I need that right now and so if you can

11:19.620 --> 11:25.620
and haven't please do join this ever-growing list of subscribers I believe

11:25.620 --> 11:37.580
there are something close to 90 live subscribers and I need about 900 if I

11:37.580 --> 11:44.420
have 900 I think I can do two or three shows a day and go absolutely bananas

11:44.420 --> 11:49.860
and produce PDFs and all the all the other stuff that I tried to do a couple

11:49.860 --> 11:53.980
years ago and I first jumped out of this plane I'm gonna be jumping out of this

11:53.980 --> 12:00.540
plane again it and so that means subscribers we need them and we need

12:00.540 --> 12:05.820
people to share the work so if you've got a Twitter if you've got a Facebook if

12:05.820 --> 12:11.580
you've got these different places start getting more active with sharing the

12:11.580 --> 12:16.980
work of Giga on biological so that we can get this on the air as many times as

12:16.980 --> 12:22.300
possible so that I can do more substacks where we have the full transcript

12:22.300 --> 12:26.700
available so I can put some subtitles in and use all my time during the day for

12:26.700 --> 12:32.740
this that would be the plan and then we'll see how much productivity we can get as

12:32.740 --> 12:38.100
we try to break this faith in a novel virus I think we've got about a year to

12:38.100 --> 12:42.940
establish something that can break this and get this information out there about

12:42.940 --> 12:47.860
a conflated background signal and get this idea out there that intramuscular

12:47.860 --> 12:50.900
injection many combination of substances with the intent of augmenting

12:50.900 --> 12:59.380
the immune system is dumb this is the faith we're trying to break ladies and

12:59.380 --> 13:04.060
gentlemen don't let anyone fool you this is what they are protecting along with

13:04.060 --> 13:08.300
the vaccine schedule of course that none of the serious ones will actually

13:08.300 --> 13:12.820
question so these are the leads we're gonna follow these leads and we're gonna

13:12.820 --> 13:18.300
keep following these leads until we break the story wide open we think it's

13:18.300 --> 13:22.620
already broken wide open but we gotta we gotta break it and that means stop

13:22.620 --> 13:26.860
all vaccines exactly gray Southwick

13:41.420 --> 13:44.980
good evening ladies and gentlemen this is giga home biological a high

13:44.980 --> 13:48.500
resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist it's

13:48.500 --> 13:54.220
January 12th 2024 my name is Jonathan Cooey and I'm coming to you live from

13:54.220 --> 14:00.100
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania from the back of my garage it is 1006 thank you very

14:00.100 --> 14:10.860
much for joining me I hope that we can find a way for everybody to come

14:10.860 --> 14:15.980
together under a banner some banner another I don't know whose banner we

14:15.980 --> 14:21.060
should come up that's the wrong one whose banner we should come under we

14:21.060 --> 14:26.620
don't need to come under any banners we don't have to be out any teams as long as

14:26.620 --> 14:33.700
we're fighting for the same thing I personally think as long as we are

14:33.700 --> 14:38.460
fighting for the same team all of our energies and all of our work should be

14:38.500 --> 14:44.500
naturally synergistic and so I really can get frustrated by the idea that we

14:44.500 --> 14:49.900
are being coaxed into believing that we've got to accept some kind of you know

14:49.900 --> 14:54.060
well I've got the best podcast so I guess I've got to do something about it I

14:54.060 --> 14:58.780
guess I've got the best platform so I guess I'm the hero everybody's looking

14:58.780 --> 15:10.700
for and this default this default idea that this is a spontaneous rise of

15:10.700 --> 15:16.380
dissidents who finally broken through because of their expert ability the

15:16.380 --> 15:24.660
master teachers have risen to the top of the internet slime to really elevate

15:24.660 --> 15:30.300
the discourse and so the narrative that we're being fed right now is people

15:30.300 --> 15:34.740
like Brett Weinstein because of their unique abilities to communicate these

15:34.740 --> 15:40.860
complex ideas in biology they have risen to the stage where they are given 45

15:40.860 --> 15:46.060
minutes with Tucker Carlson because he has the skills and the requisite

15:46.060 --> 15:51.460
knowledge and the master teaching ability to be the guy who rises to that

15:51.500 --> 15:55.980
occasion and so it's not his fault that he's so good it's not his fault that he's

15:55.980 --> 16:04.100
so skilled and this is an illusion Brett Weinstein did not rise to this occasion

16:04.100 --> 16:08.060
he was placed there just like he was placed there before the pandemic just

16:08.060 --> 16:13.060
like he was placed there when he was given the five hundred thousand dollar

16:13.060 --> 16:20.940
settlement for leaving evergreen this is not a man who has suffered it is a man

16:20.980 --> 16:26.140
who has been placed in front of these these these microphones and in front of

16:26.140 --> 16:32.260
these cameras repeatedly in order to insert him as an authority on social

16:32.260 --> 16:38.700
media and it shouldn't be underestimated how however organic it may seem that

16:38.700 --> 16:44.100
Joe Rogan has risen to prominence as a man with a hundred thousand dollars

16:44.100 --> 16:51.500
Spotify contract to interview people while he smokes illicit substances you

16:51.500 --> 16:59.660
can't see that as anything other than a non-organic fully fake implantation of

16:59.660 --> 17:04.400
someone who is there to bring you messages even if it says lame as embedded

17:04.400 --> 17:10.940
embedded advertisements for his sponsors but if his sponsors are people

17:10.940 --> 17:20.220
that want to harvest your DNA it's a little weird and so I think that's where

17:20.220 --> 17:24.300
we're getting to at this stage that's where people like amazing Polly have

17:24.300 --> 17:27.740
been way ahead of me on and other lots of other researchers have been way ahead

17:27.740 --> 17:38.700
of me on how this whole this whole orchestra of of bros with shows is

17:39.100 --> 17:49.420
is used to to propel a sort of and define a limited spectrum of debate and then you

17:49.420 --> 17:54.820
know fuel a very lively discussion within it and so I think the pandemic was

17:54.820 --> 18:01.020
created by these people these people who were willingly participating before the

18:01.020 --> 18:05.540
pandemic in a general you know the idea that you know we need influencers on our

18:05.580 --> 18:12.140
team we need influencers on the inside on these these media platforms to make

18:12.140 --> 18:16.820
sure that the states message the rulers message the influencers message the

18:16.820 --> 18:22.700
message of these weaponized piles of money is properly curated and we're

18:22.700 --> 18:26.460
gonna put these family friends we're gonna put these these trusted

18:26.460 --> 18:31.180
individuals we're gonna put these groomed individuals in place so that their

18:31.180 --> 18:35.020
credibility supersedes any of these people that are out of our control any

18:35.020 --> 18:43.140
of these people that are actually spontaneous heroes and so I think one of

18:43.140 --> 18:46.940
the curious things to look at with regard to how these people have

18:46.940 --> 18:52.780
risen is always look at who the people around them that they rise past often

18:52.780 --> 18:57.580
times that actually give them a hand as they pass thinking that that person after

18:57.580 --> 19:02.860
their helped up is gonna help them up that's typically not what happens though

19:02.860 --> 19:09.460
with these with these people that are being artificially raised and now keep

19:09.460 --> 19:14.020
in mind that behind the scenes they are artificially raised by the algorithms

19:14.020 --> 19:21.860
and so their opinions their ponderings their podcasts their declaratives their

19:21.860 --> 19:27.580
questions are amplified to millions of people and so when they ask wow I wonder

19:27.580 --> 19:35.220
who did this that is what everyone hears and what everyone heard and so when

19:35.220 --> 19:39.300
Brett Weinstein wonders aloud I wonder how much damage how much damage will be

19:39.300 --> 19:43.020
done by this pandemic and whether it came from a I mean there are definitely

19:43.020 --> 19:50.100
viruses they definitely jump and of course they can make them in laboratories

19:50.100 --> 19:53.580
we've seen it I mean they're very arrogant sometimes it's eventually a

19:53.620 --> 19:57.860
mistake is gonna be made I mean they that's for sure and then this is genetic

19:57.860 --> 20:05.340
stuff and so if Brett Weinstein has the opinion or sports the opinion or is

20:05.340 --> 20:19.580
coached into the opinion or or asked to forward the opinion then what happens

20:20.060 --> 20:24.460
the illusion of consensus gets established because he's talking to Joe

20:24.460 --> 20:32.860
Rogan he's talking to Eric Weinstein he's talking to to Lex Friedman and these two

20:32.860 --> 20:36.620
guys are agreeing and I saw him on the last podcast also agreeing with somebody

20:36.620 --> 20:41.380
and I heard I heard Michael Osterholm on Rogan's podcast so I mean obviously

20:41.380 --> 20:46.060
gain a function laboratory bio weapons is a real possibility even if they just

20:46.060 --> 20:53.140
want to whisper it and right after that I mean right after that on Joe Rogan's

20:53.140 --> 21:06.540
podcast I mean yeah I don't know they talked about prions and deer and so the

21:06.540 --> 21:13.060
illusion of consensus the worst case scenario of a gain a function bio weapon

21:13.060 --> 21:17.140
the illusion of consensus was created by discussions and pondering and

21:17.140 --> 21:26.900
wonderings out loud created by hinting created by casual mentioning dropping

21:26.900 --> 21:34.060
hints here and there if you go back through these hours and hours and hours

21:34.060 --> 21:39.340
of podcasts and commentaries and and interviews you will find endless

21:39.340 --> 21:46.380
references hints to the Scooby-Doo to the question of is this a real pandemic

21:46.380 --> 21:54.140
from a from a animal market or is this a real pandemic from a laboratory the

21:54.140 --> 21:58.660
question actually doesn't need is this a real pandemic because of course both

21:58.660 --> 22:03.340
questions asked that is this a real pandemic from a laboratory or is this a

22:03.340 --> 22:10.220
real pandemic from nature and so the only right answers are this is a real

22:10.220 --> 22:17.020
pandemic and that is that is the magic spell that they have cast on us that is

22:17.020 --> 22:23.460
the reason why we need to be so upset vaccines until we invent really important

22:23.460 --> 22:28.900
ones you know until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone you know and you

22:28.900 --> 22:33.220
know it's not it's you know measles plus and okay I can tolerate what you think

22:33.220 --> 22:37.660
about measles because you know not that many people die from it it's just a

22:37.660 --> 22:44.700
big hassle in the end but no one when we have this new pandemic that is you

22:44.700 --> 22:53.380
know got 75% mortality and it's not it's not it's there'll be no pretense of

22:53.380 --> 22:57.460
being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it

22:57.460 --> 23:02.700
has to be and this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one

23:02.700 --> 23:11.460
condition or another I mean so so remember what I'm trying to suggest here

23:11.460 --> 23:20.100
that if if what I I hypothesize is true actually happened it was quite an

23:20.100 --> 23:24.740
elaborate plan many of these people would not have known that there was

23:24.740 --> 23:27.980
going to be a pandemic before the pandemic was declared but they would have

23:28.020 --> 23:32.940
known that they were being intentionally placed in positions of influence and

23:32.940 --> 23:36.860
that they were working together that maybe the algorithm was even being

23:36.860 --> 23:42.260
gamed in their favor so that social media would elevate their opinions make

23:42.260 --> 23:45.820
sure that their opinions got in front of more people's eyes than the average

23:45.820 --> 23:52.140
person's opinion on purpose was a Democratic National Committee I don't

23:52.140 --> 23:57.780
know was it was at a banking system or pharmaceutical conglomerate or a criminal

23:57.780 --> 24:05.700
syndicate run by a foreign nations I don't know maybe multiple groups were

24:05.700 --> 24:12.940
involved in the taking advantage of what was certainly seen as a potential

24:12.940 --> 24:19.500
plan because remember that people in the government the people in Tony Fauci's

24:19.500 --> 24:26.780
neck of the woods Tony Fauci's meetings already understood and have heard many

24:26.820 --> 24:32.140
talks like like Ralph Barracks talk about how you make money from a pandemic they've

24:32.140 --> 24:37.580
been selling the idea for many many years that this was possible that doesn't mean

24:37.580 --> 24:44.620
that they did it it does mean that all of them would be in a intellectual

24:44.620 --> 24:52.260
financial career position that if and when the who did declare such an

24:52.260 --> 24:56.780
emergency that they would be likely to enact a worst-case scenario plan and

24:56.780 --> 25:04.620
stick to it for quite some time and so we don't know when they could have

25:04.620 --> 25:08.260
called the bluff when they could have said oh no wait it's wrong we don't know all

25:08.260 --> 25:15.660
of those things because this is a crime and it is a crime scene it is a potential

25:15.660 --> 25:20.400
that was set up for a long time in people's minds inside of the government

25:20.440 --> 25:26.440
inside of secret meetings inside of of all of these bureaucracies through their

25:26.440 --> 25:33.240
intense drilling over a couple decades that this was a possibility events with

25:33.240 --> 25:37.240
badges and with plushies

25:39.440 --> 25:43.800
seeding mass casualty events with complications expected for

25:43.800 --> 25:47.400
transfection this is especially important and was done probably most

25:47.400 --> 25:53.520
succinctly and well in New York City and New York State where the vast

25:53.520 --> 26:00.440
majority of the world's narrative was again seeded not unlike 9-11

26:03.360 --> 26:10.120
in addition I believe that they have a series of little teams that work

26:10.120 --> 26:15.240
together to see this worst-case scenario narrative work together in the sense of

26:15.240 --> 26:19.000
being antagonistic to one another question one another's motives question

26:19.000 --> 26:23.760
one another's conclusions offer alternative opinions but also a little

26:23.760 --> 26:32.080
bit of support to one another in other words a fake set of of spontaneously

26:32.080 --> 26:38.880
assembled gum shoes very much like the same spontaneously assembled group of

26:38.880 --> 26:44.800
people called drastic on Twitter that I got so sucked into early on not so

26:44.800 --> 26:48.680
different than the group of streaming people that I got sucked into streaming

26:48.680 --> 26:52.620
with for almost a month and a half in the beginning of the pandemic from March

26:52.620 --> 26:59.880
until April and all of these people are interconnected all of these people on

26:59.880 --> 27:06.640
this what I can only term amorphously as T Morse case scenario are connected by

27:06.680 --> 27:12.320
themselves calling each other out as bad guys by themselves suing one another

27:12.320 --> 27:17.080
by themselves serving one another apparently and and even though they

27:17.080 --> 27:23.360
both have lawyers they can't seem to get anything to go anywhere people that

27:23.360 --> 27:30.320
have been on 60 minutes the same 60 minutes that had Peter Dasek on more

27:30.320 --> 27:36.280
than once to tell us of pandemic potential in badcapes over the course

27:36.360 --> 27:42.720
of the last 20 years ladies and gentlemen it can't be seen any other way than an

27:42.720 --> 27:48.240
elaborate scheme to get our children to believe that pandemic potential is

27:48.240 --> 27:52.520
real and that therefore they have to surrender their sovereignty to the who

27:52.520 --> 27:58.920
in order to prevent a absolute disaster

27:59.920 --> 28:11.000
oh that's the wrong one this is the one I want to get myself tanny resume and so

28:11.000 --> 28:17.200
making this response a declared crisis of national security priority whatever

28:17.200 --> 28:25.680
HHS prep act activated asper office of whatever all these things turned on

28:25.760 --> 28:31.680
activated that meant that all these participants once they were really

28:31.680 --> 28:35.400
taken in they're only allowed to say certain things and they know what they

28:35.400 --> 28:42.440
can't say and I think I've discovered or identified rather a pretty distinct

28:42.440 --> 28:46.960
pattern and that they don't question the existence of a novel virus they don't

28:46.960 --> 28:50.880
question the fact that a millions of people were killed by it they don't

28:50.880 --> 28:55.480
question the fact that millions more were saved from it just how the majority of

28:55.480 --> 29:00.680
those people were saved they don't question the the danger of gain of

29:00.680 --> 29:05.520
function research in these RNA viruses and they don't question the idea that

29:05.520 --> 29:09.800
another virus will come again they just want different things to happen next

29:09.800 --> 29:18.640
time they want more freedom next time and so the toxicity of the virus and the

29:18.640 --> 29:23.280
toxicity of transfection has been confounded successfully in the population

29:23.320 --> 29:29.640
as a whole and in the young in particular and we need to break this illusion that

29:29.640 --> 29:35.520
is our job that is what we have to do because the mystery virus equals excess

29:35.520 --> 29:42.320
deaths is a an equation that we were made to believe by world leaders by people

29:42.320 --> 29:46.400
at the CDC and on the news and also all the virologists still believe it and

29:46.400 --> 29:53.480
it's just not true unless you do the math unless you take into account that

29:53.480 --> 29:57.640
there were do not resuscitate orders in New York City that brought about this

29:57.640 --> 30:02.920
event right here unless you take into account the use of ventilators that

30:02.920 --> 30:06.920
brought about this event right here the lack of antibiotic use that brought

30:06.920 --> 30:11.720
about this the poor use of steroids that brought about these events the use of

30:11.720 --> 30:16.280
remdesivir and medazalam that brought about these events the increase in opioid

30:16.280 --> 30:19.880
deaths that nobody cares about the brought about these deaths the deaths

30:19.880 --> 30:24.880
certificate fraud that brings about these deaths the COVID deaths the

30:24.880 --> 30:28.720
financial incentives that bring about these deaths down here the COVID deaths

30:28.720 --> 30:34.960
not the real deaths the ones that they labeled track and trace mass closures

30:34.960 --> 30:38.480
mandates all these things that Brett Weinstein said should have just been

30:38.480 --> 30:44.000
stricter and done better and then we would have zero COVID now he actually

30:44.000 --> 30:52.920
believed that never mind the PCR fraud the lateral flow test fraud and likely

30:52.920 --> 30:59.680
sequencing fraud again I do not want to diminish the value and the expertise of

30:59.680 --> 31:03.320
our national health care societies and international exercise like the WHO and

31:03.320 --> 31:09.200
the CDC however they think those are our bodies that are built for peace time and

31:09.200 --> 31:13.280
not for war and we're at war right now with this virus and and one of the main

31:13.320 --> 31:17.200
issues that we've seen is that they initially came out all the national

31:17.200 --> 31:20.920
health care societies came out with recommendations that focuses on

31:20.920 --> 31:25.800
supportive care only which is generally you give Tylenol for fever you treat

31:25.800 --> 31:29.320
symptoms you might give a little hydration nutrition and you give oxygen

31:29.320 --> 31:33.440
and ventilators for for support when they can't breathe and and that's

31:33.440 --> 31:37.680
reasonable for viral syndrome but this thing is different number one number two

31:37.680 --> 31:42.320
that strategy is failing I don't think I need to spend a lot of time showing

31:42.760 --> 31:46.680
how badly that's filled in the mortality and morbidity rates of this disease

31:46.680 --> 31:50.360
are unprecedented I've been doing critical care for a decade and a half I

31:50.360 --> 31:54.240
do not see mortality rates associated with any severe illness that I see in

31:54.240 --> 31:59.160
this this one and so that's a very bold statement and I don't think he's

31:59.160 --> 32:04.720
necessarily lying when he makes that statement but it is a statement that is

32:04.720 --> 32:11.720
based on confusion it is a statement most likely based on being told

32:12.040 --> 32:19.120
that this is what needs to be said because if the lockdowns don't continue

32:19.120 --> 32:24.080
if the compliance does not increase then we're gonna have a big problem and so

32:24.080 --> 32:28.480
it could very well be that in this video at this time Corey thought he was

32:28.480 --> 32:35.480
doing what he had to do even if he was telling or exaggerating or it's not

32:35.480 --> 32:41.720
quite totally and keep in mind that this could have been an aerosolized

32:41.720 --> 32:45.640
toxin of some kind that when he was in New York City he was experiencing but

32:45.640 --> 32:54.240
according to the notes and his own notes he got there after the 20,000 people were

32:54.240 --> 33:01.400
dead after the big peak that we're seeing right here is when he came to to

33:01.400 --> 33:07.680
New York and so it's very very interesting right that this peak is over

33:07.680 --> 33:14.760
and then he shows up and so what did he see when he was in New York what could

33:14.760 --> 33:19.400
he have seen when he was in New York were these it's just a real curious

33:19.400 --> 33:24.240
situation because again this is a man who in the end after saying what he said

33:24.240 --> 33:29.320
here and then the heat of the moment saying that none of these protocols are

33:29.400 --> 33:37.240
working then he became hyper fixated on Ivermectin as a novel treatment for

33:37.240 --> 33:42.880
this novel virus rather than antibiotics steroids when necessary or when

33:42.880 --> 33:49.680
appropriate fluids and and and vitamin C and vitamin D and zinc and all these

33:49.680 --> 33:57.120
other things that they were also advocating for at some point and so it's

33:57.120 --> 34:03.160
a very curious way that this narrative is played out because remember the point

34:03.160 --> 34:07.520
is is that they dragged it out for four years ladies and gentlemen four full

34:07.520 --> 34:16.520
years have expired this is three full years ago and so we're supposed to have

34:16.520 --> 34:20.080
woken up since then we're supposed to have figured a lot out since then but it

34:20.080 --> 34:27.880
doesn't really seem like we have because all of these people who got it

34:27.880 --> 34:36.160
wrong who have exaggerated or overstated what happened in order to fulfill the

34:36.160 --> 34:41.440
role they're in in order to to do what they needed to do to say what they were

34:41.440 --> 34:48.580
told to say millions of people transfected themselves thousands of people

34:48.580 --> 34:52.420
took themselves to the hospital after a positive test and got themselves on

34:52.420 --> 34:56.560
Remdesivir because they didn't know better because these people didn't know

34:56.560 --> 35:04.900
better including myself right behind my head here we're all responsible for

35:04.900 --> 35:08.540
perpetuating this worst case scenario this idea that there was a gain of

35:08.540 --> 35:14.220
function virus and so I don't know maybe JC on a bike maybe JC on a bike is

35:14.260 --> 35:20.100
really healthy but I'm not really healthy so I'm pretty scared that's what I did

35:20.100 --> 35:24.900
JC on a bike rides his bike to and from work to a medical school every day

35:24.900 --> 35:29.340
probably eats really well lives in the woods I don't have any of those advantages

35:29.340 --> 35:38.100
maybe I need the transfection that's what I did I made absolutely a year's worth

35:38.180 --> 35:44.900
of mistakes but those mistakes were the result of other people around me all of

35:44.900 --> 35:49.740
these people that were in contact with me behind the scenes talking to me behind

35:49.740 --> 35:56.180
the scenes trying to convince me that I was wrong about natural immunity I was

35:56.180 --> 36:02.100
wrong about previous immunity to previous coronavirus I was wrong about T cell

36:02.180 --> 36:08.420
immunity to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase is most conserved epitopes I

36:08.420 --> 36:13.140
was wrong about all that stuff that's crazy man I don't know those that sounds

36:13.140 --> 36:20.220
pretty complicated I'm pretty scared of the spike protein but the spike protein

36:20.220 --> 36:26.380
is so I was convinced by other people that I was wrong people came to my house

36:26.380 --> 36:36.320
to convince me I was wrong and so I became confused and afraid that maybe I

36:36.320 --> 36:43.100
gave the wrong advice to people maybe I'd put people in danger maybe I didn't

36:43.100 --> 36:47.580
know what I was talking about why would so many prominent people call me and

36:47.580 --> 36:49.980
tell me I didn't know what I was talking about if I didn't know what I was

36:49.980 --> 36:58.020
talking about I'm just I'm just a reader we are four years into this bad idea

36:58.020 --> 37:04.500
stuff here ladies and gentlemen I've met them all they've talked to me offline

37:04.500 --> 37:13.180
all of them on my phone on signal and a lot of these people are responsible for

37:13.180 --> 37:18.980
me not figuring it out earlier for not getting to where I am now much earlier

37:18.980 --> 37:24.660
and Brett Weinstein is a big one of those Yuri Dagan is another one of those

37:24.660 --> 37:28.780
everybody in drastic was one of those people that kept me on the lie on the

37:28.780 --> 37:38.540
hook for the whole first year and then sucked me back in again when the

37:38.540 --> 37:43.860
diffuse proposal was debated and debated and debated I tried to ignore it gosh

37:43.860 --> 37:56.340
did I try to ignore it and so he seated the Scooby-Doo by having Yuri

37:56.340 --> 38:02.940
Dagan on his stream I seeded the Scooby-Doo by reviewing Yuri Dagan's paper and

38:02.940 --> 38:07.740
getting it published I seeded the Scooby-Doo by by reviewing Dan's paper

38:07.740 --> 38:12.180
Dan Saratkin's paper and Carl Saratkin's paper and getting that paper published

38:12.420 --> 38:16.900
I seeded the Scooby-Doo by reviewing Mona's paper and getting the paper about

38:16.900 --> 38:25.060
the Mo Young miners in 2012 getting that paper published and I did it

38:25.060 --> 38:28.620
enthusiastically because I thought I was getting the truth out because people had

38:28.620 --> 38:33.740
convinced me that this was the mystery to solve where did this virus come from

38:33.740 --> 38:38.100
who's responsible for it did they make it I think they did was it serial

38:38.100 --> 38:45.980
passage and ferrets that's how they got us ladies and gentlemen and that's my

38:45.980 --> 38:52.020
unique perspective that's the reason why I can be so helpful because I can show

38:52.020 --> 39:03.220
you how dumb I was how taken I was and I was taken

39:03.220 --> 39:08.380
ladies and gentlemen these people took us it wasn't an accident it wasn't a

39:08.380 --> 39:13.940
it wasn't just a serendipitous oops I guess I got that part wrong oh man it

39:13.940 --> 39:18.020
was my commitment to masks a little too good oh shoot should I have not

39:18.020 --> 39:21.820
buckled down on lockdown should I have said that kids should go back to school

39:21.820 --> 39:27.900
earlier these aren't mistakes ladies and gentlemen they're not innocent

39:27.900 --> 39:33.900
mistakes being made by somebody who just happens to have a platform these are

39:33.900 --> 39:38.980
mistakes being made by someone who's given a platform put there on purpose to

39:38.980 --> 39:44.980
make sure that the limited spectrum of debate could be established that debate

39:44.980 --> 39:48.700
being was this was a lab leak or a natural virus which would then make

39:48.700 --> 39:53.980
everybody accept which would make everybody accept that there was a

39:53.980 --> 39:58.500
pandemic virus circulating around the globe right now as we speak is only

39:58.500 --> 40:08.500
question of where did it come from they did this to us and that's why in the

40:08.500 --> 40:16.620
last podcast him and Heather we're so sadly almost pathetically begging for

40:16.620 --> 40:25.580
for some I don't know remittance please stop bothering us we didn't do

40:25.580 --> 40:31.020
anything wrong you guys are jealous we just have a bigger platform than you and

40:31.020 --> 40:38.340
it's not our fault we put ourselves on the line a long time ago it was kind of

40:38.340 --> 40:45.900
sad actually and what's sad about it is is they don't understand they don't

40:45.940 --> 40:52.580
understand that those two years that they want to ignore 2020 and 2021 are

40:52.580 --> 40:58.460
when hundreds of thousands of people took the shot and thousands of people

40:58.460 --> 41:02.420
died in our hospitals of protocols that were inappropriate for true their

41:02.420 --> 41:12.380
treatment and these people still ignore those that math they still ignore that

41:12.380 --> 41:17.260
math they still ignore those those ciphers that they don't want to tally

41:17.260 --> 41:21.300
that up they don't want to subtract that from all cause mortality they don't

41:21.300 --> 41:26.540
actually want to know what Denny has to say they just want that one figure that

41:26.540 --> 41:31.700
seventeen million figure from the shots because they don't want to question the

41:31.700 --> 41:42.260
novel virus let's watch this video and you can see what I mean we're gonna

41:42.260 --> 41:47.900
start here at the lab leak hypothesis but notice that there are as an

41:47.900 --> 41:53.780
introduction and then why biology is beautiful the why biology beautiful part

41:53.780 --> 42:02.140
is well he tries really hard to convince you that he was a biologist since he was

42:02.140 --> 42:08.540
a little kid but I don't think he's as convincing as I've heard other people

42:08.540 --> 42:16.980
anyway then Boston dynamics and robots being self-critical it's you know

42:16.980 --> 42:21.300
that's a little bit like forced and I don't want to put you through all of that

42:21.300 --> 42:25.860
because that's like 23 minutes I'm gonna go past the theory of close calls as

42:25.860 --> 42:30.540
well because it's a little bit vague and again you know I don't want to listen to

42:30.540 --> 42:34.780
too much of this I just want you to hear the lab leak hypothesis part and then

42:34.780 --> 42:38.900
maybe Joe Rogan and censorship I'm not sure but let's just listen to the lab

42:38.900 --> 42:44.100
leak part and we'll see where we get what percent probability would you

42:44.100 --> 42:52.780
currently place okay so by the way this is June 25th 2021 and he had Robert Malone

42:52.780 --> 43:00.820
and and Steve Kersch on his podcast on June 11th so this is exactly two weeks

43:00.820 --> 43:07.740
later on the Lex Friedman podcast lab leak hypothesis here we go Brett Weinstein

43:07.740 --> 43:14.540
the hypothesis that COVID-19 leak from the Wuhan Institute of virology so I

43:14.540 --> 43:20.780
maintain a flowchart of all the possible explanations and it doesn't break down

43:20.780 --> 43:27.860
exactly that way the likelihood that it emerged from a lab is very very high if

43:27.860 --> 43:31.700
it emerged from a lab the likelihood that the lab was the Wuhan Institute is

43:31.700 --> 43:38.900
very very high the there are multiple different kinds of evidence that point

43:38.900 --> 43:43.300
to the lab and there are is literally no evidence that points to nature either

43:43.300 --> 43:47.380
the evidence points nowhere or it points to the lab and the lab could mean any

43:47.380 --> 43:53.220
lab but geographically obviously the labs in Wuhan are the most likely and the

43:53.220 --> 43:57.420
lab that was most directly involved with research on viruses that look like

43:57.420 --> 44:03.020
COVID that looked like SARS-CoV-2 is obviously the place that one would start

44:03.020 --> 44:11.460
but I would say the likelihood that this virus came from a lab is well above 95 percent

44:11.460 --> 44:15.780
we can talk about the question of could a virus have been brought into the lab

44:15.780 --> 44:19.700
and escaped from there without being modified that's also possible but it

44:19.700 --> 44:26.580
doesn't explain any of the anomalies in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 could it have

44:26.580 --> 44:32.060
been delivered from another lab could Wuhan be a distraction in order that we

44:32.060 --> 44:36.580
would connect the dots in the wrong way that's conceivable I currently have that

44:36.580 --> 44:41.220
below one percent on my flowchart but I think very dark thought that somebody

44:41.220 --> 44:46.700
would would do that almost as a a political attack on China well it depends

44:46.860 --> 44:51.660
I don't even think that's one possibility sometimes when Eric and I talk about

44:51.660 --> 44:57.620
these issues we will generate a scenario just to prove that something could could

44:57.620 --> 45:01.220
live in that space right it's a placeholder for whatever may actually

45:01.220 --> 45:05.540
have happened and so it doesn't have to have been an attack on China that's

45:05.540 --> 45:11.540
certainly one possibility but I would point out if you can predict the future

45:12.020 --> 45:18.740
in some unusual way better than others you can print money right that's what

45:18.740 --> 45:24.460
markets that allow you to bet for or against virtually any sector allow you

45:24.460 --> 45:33.700
to do so you can imagine a simply a moral person or entity generating a

45:33.700 --> 45:37.620
pandemic attempting to cover their tracks because it would allow them to bet

45:37.620 --> 45:43.460
against things like you know cruise ships air travel whatever it is and bet

45:43.460 --> 45:52.820
in favor of I don't know sanitizing gel and whatever else you would do so am I

45:52.820 --> 45:55.860
saying that I think somebody did that no I really don't think it happened we've

45:55.860 --> 46:01.540
seen zero evidence that this was intentionally released however were it to

46:01.540 --> 46:04.740
have been intentionally released by somebody who did not know did not want

46:04.740 --> 46:09.060
it known where it had come from releasing it in Wuhan would be one way to

46:09.060 --> 46:13.380
cover their tracks so we have to leave the possibility formally open but

46:13.380 --> 46:17.700
acknowledge there's no evidence so and the probability therefore as well I tend

46:17.700 --> 46:25.500
to believe maybe this is the optimistic nature that I have that people who are

46:25.500 --> 46:30.660
competent enough to do the kind of thing we just described are not going to do

46:30.660 --> 46:35.420
that because it requires a certain kind of I don't want to use the word evil

46:35.420 --> 46:40.980
but whatever word you want to use to describe the kind of this regard for

46:40.980 --> 46:46.060
human life required to do that you're just that's it's just not going to be

46:46.060 --> 46:50.620
coupled with competence I feel like there's a trade-off chart where

46:50.620 --> 46:55.140
competence on one axis and evil is on the other and the more evil you become

46:56.140 --> 47:02.660
the crappier you are at doing great engineering scientific work required to

47:02.660 --> 47:06.700
deliver weapons of different kinds whether it's bio weapons or nuclear weapons all

47:06.700 --> 47:10.980
those kinds of things that seems to be the lessons I take from history but that

47:10.980 --> 47:16.300
doesn't necessarily mean that's what's going to be happening in the future but

47:16.300 --> 47:21.700
to stick on the lab leak idea because the flow chart is probably huge here because

47:21.740 --> 47:26.340
there's a lot of fascinating possibilities one question I want to ask is what

47:26.340 --> 47:31.420
of course I hope you don't think that I think that he's a some kind of MIT AI

47:31.420 --> 47:36.060
professor right I mean it also plays guitar in his car and stuff like that

47:36.060 --> 47:41.380
like this is a this is also some kind of elaborate hoax I don't know what he is

47:41.380 --> 47:47.380
but you know if if it's if they're related somehow they're they're

47:47.380 --> 47:56.140
related through this same social media network of bros with shows and this

47:56.140 --> 48:00.700
this this guy schtick really never convinced me from the very very

48:00.700 --> 48:06.020
beginning I thought it was it was baloney I mean he ticks all the boxes

48:06.020 --> 48:14.180
right he's jujitsu and guitar and AI and MIT and it's like okay okay okay I give

48:15.180 --> 48:21.580
up you know chess master whatever else that's great I mean you know none of us

48:21.580 --> 48:25.340
can match up to this guy so that's great and then give him a really great

48:25.340 --> 48:29.860
podcast and have all these guys come on it and totally legitimize him by having

48:29.860 --> 48:35.220
Joe Rogan give him a watch live on team on stream I mean it's just it's all it's

48:35.220 --> 48:42.540
all part of the same show these people have been elevated to be able to orchestrate

48:42.540 --> 48:46.460
the thought of all these different demographics that overlap on the

48:46.460 --> 48:50.580
internet and and bros with shows is the best way to describe what these people

48:50.580 --> 48:58.500
do with evidence for natural origins look like so one piece of evidence for

48:58.500 --> 49:04.380
natural origins is that it's happened in the past okay so remember what's

49:04.380 --> 49:07.820
happening here right remember what's happening here what are we doing what

49:07.820 --> 49:13.780
are we doing we are establishing this we are establishing this worst case

49:13.780 --> 49:19.980
scenario right that's what they're talking about here that's what they're

49:19.980 --> 49:23.180
talking about here they're talking about worst case scenario and trying to

49:23.180 --> 49:26.980
establish the consensus that oh my gosh I mean if they were fooling around with

49:26.980 --> 49:30.860
a virus in a laboratory we could really be in big trouble that's what they're

49:30.860 --> 49:45.340
that's what they're doing here be keenly aware of that and that was the magic

49:45.340 --> 49:49.820
of what happened here that was the magic of what was done to us because when we

49:49.820 --> 49:54.620
watched this in real time we were trying to keep up to not because either of

49:54.620 --> 49:59.900
these two guys is a is a is a conversational genius but because we were

49:59.900 --> 50:09.140
trying to figure out the mystery we were trying to solve the mystery that

50:09.140 --> 50:12.740
these guys were framing as a limited spectrum of debate and then having a

50:12.740 --> 50:16.700
well maybe not lively this discussion but other people were having lively

50:16.700 --> 50:24.460
discussions about it that that viruses have jumped oh they do jump they so like

50:24.460 --> 50:29.740
that's one like that's possible to have happened you know so that that's a sort

50:29.740 --> 50:34.660
of like a historical evidence like okay well it's possible that it have it's

50:34.660 --> 50:38.940
not it's not evidence of the kind you think it is it's a justification for a

50:38.940 --> 50:43.260
presumption right right so the presumption upon discovering a new

50:43.260 --> 50:47.580
virus circulating is certainly that it came from nature right the problem is

50:47.580 --> 50:51.980
the presumption evaporates in the face of evidence or at least it logically

50:51.980 --> 50:57.140
should and it didn't in this case it was maintained by people who privately

50:57.140 --> 51:01.420
in their emails acknowledge that they had grave doubts about the natural

51:01.420 --> 51:06.500
origin of of this virus is there some other piece of evidence that we could

51:06.500 --> 51:12.780
look for and see that would say this increases the probability it is natural

51:12.780 --> 51:18.060
origins yeah in fact there is evidence you know I always worry that somebody is

51:18.060 --> 51:25.100
going to make up some evidence in order to reverse the flow boy well let's say

51:25.100 --> 51:28.540
I am a lot of incentive for that actually there's a huge amount of incentive on

51:28.540 --> 51:34.540
the up so there's a huge amount of incentive to make up information about

51:34.540 --> 51:42.180
a natural virus imagine how amazing it is to say this out loud without laughing

51:42.180 --> 51:49.740
that there isn't there isn't and much much much much greater incentive you

51:49.740 --> 51:57.420
just described all these people who were interested in in profiting from a

51:57.420 --> 52:08.780
pandemic so is the is the idea to create fake evidence of a natural pandemic to

52:08.780 --> 52:14.220
cover up a manufactured one is that what he thinks is the most likely idea

52:14.220 --> 52:22.140
instead of just faking a manufactured one and making fake evidence for

52:22.140 --> 52:27.260
manufactured one you know like a diffuse proposal that never got funded and

52:27.260 --> 52:32.340
never it was it just happened to be on a on a server somewhere that some guy

52:32.340 --> 52:36.220
found and then released in a couple different places and Veritas covered

52:36.220 --> 52:41.700
it and now it's uh it's uh evidence of a lab leak because obviously they did

52:41.700 --> 52:51.380
this experiments I mean they got me to say that they came to my house and got me

52:51.380 --> 52:59.700
to say that live on my own stream that oftentimes grant proposals are written

52:59.700 --> 53:03.940
with the idea that the knowledge that some of these experiments have already

53:03.980 --> 53:07.980
been done the pilot experiments have already confirmed that they need to do

53:07.980 --> 53:14.380
more of these experiments and there will be a significant result and so in theory

53:14.380 --> 53:19.980
if you have a a grant proposal with experiments in it wouldn't be crazy if

53:19.980 --> 53:24.980
some of those experiments had already been done some of the preliminary methodologies

53:24.980 --> 53:31.260
already set in motion so I said that on my stream and I got quoted in Bobby's

53:31.260 --> 53:38.900
book the stream where somebody came to my house from drastic and made me

53:38.900 --> 53:45.980
encouraged me to come back on side and keep fighting for the origin story

53:45.980 --> 53:49.980
rather than against the transfections

53:52.740 --> 54:01.140
ladies and gentlemen I want to tell this story because I want it to be a beacon

54:01.220 --> 54:07.380
of hope for people to see that it's never too late to say oh my gosh I can't

54:07.380 --> 54:14.020
believe I went along with this it's never too late to admit that you really got

54:14.020 --> 54:17.460
it wrong from the beginning and you should have never been pushing the worst

54:17.460 --> 54:23.300
case scenario and if you were saying that it was a lab leak you should have

54:23.300 --> 54:31.620
been saying that that doesn't matter because whatever this RNA pathogen is we

54:31.620 --> 54:37.620
have previous immunity that's relevant to it it's not a novel never before seen

54:37.620 --> 54:43.580
everybody's vulnerable situation like they said it was like Brett is still

54:43.580 --> 54:49.660
saying it is when we have a novel pathogen we have to assume that it came

54:49.660 --> 54:54.580
from nature there are novel pathogens there are novel RNA pathogens for which

54:54.580 --> 55:01.940
we have no immunity is what Brett believes make sure you hear that because

55:01.940 --> 55:06.100
it wasn't just masks that he got wrong it wasn't just lockdowns that he got

55:06.100 --> 55:11.660
wrong it's fundamental biology that he got wrong fundamental immunology that he

55:11.660 --> 55:20.340
got wrong and like many many many many of us the fundamental virology because

55:20.340 --> 55:26.700
you assume that the cartoon that you were given is real you assume that well I

55:26.700 --> 55:30.540
mean I've worked with the denoviruses before so I know that

55:30.540 --> 55:35.700
transfection works so why can't there be coronaviruses in the wild I guess

55:35.700 --> 55:46.140
there are they have nature papers about them takes a long time to break free

55:46.140 --> 55:50.740
ladies and gentlemen their hand why everybody's got a cloud their way the

55:50.740 --> 55:54.060
powers that lied to us about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq why didn't they

55:54.060 --> 55:58.620
ever fake weapons of mass destruction interact whatever force it is I hope

55:58.620 --> 56:02.660
that forces here too and so whatever evidence we find is real it's it's the

56:02.660 --> 56:06.940
competence thing I'm talking about but okay go ahead sorry well we can get back

56:06.940 --> 56:11.300
to that but I would say yeah that the the giant piece of evidence that will

56:11.300 --> 56:16.380
shift the probabilities in the other direction is the discovery of either a

56:16.380 --> 56:21.060
human population in which the virus circulated prior to showing up in Wuhan

56:21.060 --> 56:24.540
that would explain where the virus learned all of the tricks that it knew

56:24.540 --> 56:30.980
instantly upon spreading from Wuhan so that would do it or an animal population

56:30.980 --> 56:36.460
in which an ancestor epidemic can be found in which the virus learned this

56:36.460 --> 56:41.220
before jumping to humans but I point out in that second case you would certainly

56:41.220 --> 56:45.980
expect to see a great deal of evolution in the early epidemic which we don't

56:45.980 --> 56:51.380
and so we didn't see that indeed there was a paper a preprint by Alina Chan

56:51.380 --> 56:57.900
that came out in April of 2020 that I covered on my bike a couple different

56:57.900 --> 57:02.940
times exclaiming that this was extraordinary that the virus wasn't

57:02.940 --> 57:08.900
changing at all the same sequence kept being found everywhere reported

57:08.900 --> 57:13.460
everywhere with very few changes which didn't really make complete sense to me

57:13.460 --> 57:19.740
at the time but I knew it was wrong and then Alina Chan's paper came out and

57:19.740 --> 57:24.460
it showed that every time they sequenced the first SARS virus during that leak

57:24.620 --> 57:29.860
or whatever it was there were 50 or 60 amino acids on average that were

57:29.860 --> 57:39.260
different and in these sequences a total of 10 changed over six months where it

57:39.260 --> 57:47.020
was per patient 10 to 12 amino acids 50 amino acids changed in six months or

57:47.020 --> 57:50.620
something crazy like that you have to go back and see your paper which is

57:50.620 --> 57:56.220
never really been published it's always remained a preprint which is also odd

57:56.220 --> 58:01.580
while she is now a broad Institute research fellow with a semi-permanent

58:01.580 --> 58:07.780
position working on artificial chromosomes selling books about the

58:07.780 --> 58:17.620
lab leak let's continue let's see so there almost has to be a human population

58:17.620 --> 58:21.620
somewhere else that had the virus circulating or an ancestor of the virus

58:21.620 --> 58:24.820
that we first saw in Wuhan circulating and it has to have gotten very

58:24.820 --> 58:29.260
sophisticated in that prior epidemic before hitting Wuhan in order to

58:29.260 --> 58:34.180
explain the total lack of evolution and extremely effective virus that emerged

58:34.180 --> 58:39.140
at the end of 2019 so you don't believe in the magic of evolution to spring up

58:39.140 --> 58:42.180
with all the tricks already there like everybody who doesn't have the tricks

58:42.180 --> 58:47.300
they die quickly and then you just have this beautiful virus that comes in with

58:47.300 --> 58:52.260
spike protein see now the problem with it again is that these guys are not

58:52.260 --> 58:56.340
engaging their imagination in a sufficiently sophisticated way and

58:56.340 --> 59:01.060
it's especially disappointing for somebody like Brett who claims in this same

59:01.060 --> 59:06.100
interview earlier that he's been a biologist since he was a kid but

59:06.100 --> 59:09.620
apparently his appreciation for the complexity of life

59:09.620 --> 59:13.860
is not really that deep

59:15.780 --> 59:21.940
it's extraordinary when you think about the idea that an RNA molecule curled

59:21.940 --> 59:26.980
around some proteins and wrapped in a lipoprotein coat

59:26.980 --> 59:33.940
is capable of going through an evolutionary process where selective

59:33.940 --> 59:38.420
pressure is acting in such a way to craft an ever better

59:38.420 --> 59:43.620
virus it's an extraordinary hypothesis that has

59:43.620 --> 59:50.020
no basis in reality at all especially in the idea that this RNA molecule is

59:50.020 --> 59:54.660
capable of hijacking our cells machinery to make more viruses as if

59:54.660 --> 59:58.420
cells don't already make things like viruses and otherwise this wouldn't even

59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.140
be possible

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:06.740
and so intracellular communication is completely discarded even though they

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.940
know they should know that exosomes is a whole field of investigation

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.420
they're involved in cancer and in in transplant research and all kinds of

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.180
other things that's very likely what lipkin was

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.100
working on so all of these threads are alive and well

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:30.020
at this time as well this time is june 25th 2021

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:36.900
june 25th 2021 it's like two and a half three and a half

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:42.180
year two and a half years ago yeah

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.420
when lots of people still could have been saved but we're not even close to

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.140
coming to say that transfections should not be used

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.580
on college age kids here we're not going to say that in this

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.660
interview we're going to keep scaring people about the worst case scenario

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.380
talking about the worst case scenario which is

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:05.300
again a function viral lab leak it's the mythology they want our children to

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.860
grow up with and accept and the through mutation

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:15.620
and selection just do like the ones that succeed

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.700
and succeed big are the ones that are going to just spring into life with the

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.540
tricks listen to how unsophisticated and

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:28.100
ridiculous his ideas of evolution are what

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:33.780
mechanisms are possessed by a lipoprotein coated RNA molecule

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.980
that allow rapid evolution sudden emergence

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.860
of new forms what is he talking about

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.820
i don't think he's very smart

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:57.380
uh i'm actually not i'm actually surprised at how bad this is going

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.220
well no that's that's called a hopeful monster

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.060
and hopeful monsters don't work it's to the job of

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.220
becoming a new pandemic virus is too difficult he laughed at two very

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.820
difficult steps and they both have to work one is the ability to infect a

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.380
person and spread in their tissues uh sufficient to make an infection

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.060
and the other is to jump between individuals at a sufficient rate that it

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.940
doesn't go extinct for one reason or another

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.700
those are both very difficult jobs they require as you describe

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.180
selection and the point is selection would leave a mark we would see

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:35.620
evidence that it was in animals or humans we would see both

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.980
right and we see this evolution interest of uh

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:42.820
of the virus gathering the tricks up yeah you would see the virus

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.940
you would see the clumsy virus get better and better and yes i am a full

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.940
believer in the power of that process in fact i believe it

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.860
what i know from studying the process is that it is

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.300
much more powerful than most people imagine that what we teach

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.340
in the evolution 101 textbook is too clumsy a process to do what we see it

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.860
doing and that actually people should increase their expectation

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.620
of the rapidity with which that process can produce

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:15.220
um just jaw-dropping adaptations and so he's actually suggesting that

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.860
random evolution is the primary mover of life

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.220
it can't be any other thing that explains how these things happen it's

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.900
just miraculous how this simple mechanism explains

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.340
everything and i don't believe that for a second

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.020
there are very complicated mechanisms of evolution at play that include

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.820
endogenous viral exchange of genes

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:42.740
hulkai i mean it in the list is endless it's not random mutation

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:48.580
and selection for random mutations it's much more complicated than that

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.380
it's epigenetics it's all kinds of things that he's not even remotely

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.660
capable of integrating into his very very tiny

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.180
and simple version of evolution and it's a very macro idea

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:10.020
he hasn't done any of the the legwork necessary to bring evolution down to

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:13.220
the level of a molecule wrapped in lipoprotein

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:18.020
and and to try and abstract from that what is possible at this

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.740
size scale and at this sophistication level what is possible and what isn't

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.660
he hasn't even recognized that there has to be a limitation as to how much

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.940
evolution can occur in a system purported to be

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:36.340
dependent on an RNA dependent RNA polymerase that makes an error every

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.060
10,000 bases copying a genome that's supposed to be 30,000

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.620
bases long making incomplete copies of that genome

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.620
hundreds of thousands of times more often than making a full copy successful

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.420
from beginning to end and yet somehow or another producing

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:59.300
a output which is sufficiently accessible

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:04.820
by environmental pressures to evolve

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.060
these are the kinds of things that Brett Weinstein doesn't talk about these are

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.820
the kinds of complex issues that Brett Weinstein doesn't talk about i got no

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:17.140
notes in front of me i'm just trying to illustrate how

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.180
unsophisticated of a biologist this guy is how

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.820
much of a snake oil salesman he is and how you can know for sure

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.740
that he is part of team worst case scenario he's not an innocent bystander

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:33.220
just bumbling around saying the wrong things that just happened to help all

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:38.580
of the weaponized piles of money that are trying to enslave our children

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.780
that said we just don't see evidence that it happened here which doesn't

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.020
mean it doesn't exist but it means in spite of immense pressure to find

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.180
it somewhere there's been no hint which probably means it took place

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.580
inside of a laboratory so inside the laboratory

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.580
gain a function research on viruses and i believe

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.820
most of that kind of research is doing this exact thing that you're

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.740
referring to which is accelerated evolution and just watching evolution

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:15.220
do its thing and a bunch of viruses and seeing what kind of tricks get

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:20.660
developed the other method see now that doesn't happen with RNA

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.660
viruses you can't do that with RNA viruses because

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:29.700
by definition as they replicate they become less and less replication

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:36.340
competent and they fizzle out that's why you can't culture

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:41.140
this whole notion that they are cultured and sustained indefinitely so that they

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.220
can be sent around the world and everlasting samples

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:51.300
and sold or given away or whatever is is all a sham

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:55.540
a DNA clone is made and then RNA is generated from that DNA clone that's why

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.580
they can do all these things that's how they store all these things they don't

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.260
store the RNA you think they could just freeze it

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.860
unfreeze it a bunch of times and store it in that way all the time

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.940
and then send it around the world and they would still have sars or banny if

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.340
they were storing it in an RNA form

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:19.140
you can't store RNA at minus 80 for 10 years with freeze

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:25.380
thaw cycles but you can do it with DNA

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.340
come on guys we got to wake up and apologize to the people that killed

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.580
that got killed apologize to the people that died apologize to the people that

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:39.620
lost loved ones for not being able to articulate this

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.100
earlier

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:50.820
is engineering viruses so manually adding on the tricks

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.540
what which do you think we should be thinking about here

01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:00.100
so mind you i learned what i know in the aftermath of this pandemic

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.940
emerging i started studying the question you know i would say

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:09.460
based on the content of the genome and other evidence in publications from

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.820
the various labs that were involved in in uh

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.220
generating this technology a couple of things seem likely

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:23.140
this sars covid 2 does not appear to be entirely the result of

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:29.220
either a splicing process or serial passaging it it appears to have both

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:33.940
uh things in its past or it's at least highly likely that it does

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.020
so for example the fur and cleavage site looks very much like it

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.860
was added in to the virus and it was known that that would increase its

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.820
infectivity in humans and increase its tropism

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:54.100
the uh rixie actually said over and over and over again in 2020 and 2021

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.420
that the fur and cleavage site made it the most

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.460
transmissible and infectious virus in history

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.460
the most transmissible and infectious virus in history

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:16.980
its team worst case scenario they were set up to make sure everyone thought

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.060
that it was from a lab that we solved the mystery

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:27.060
and claimed victory and blamed the people that the scooby-doo narrative

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:33.380
unmasked for us that these caped crusaders would

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:39.940
unmasked for us people like tony fauci and peter day sack

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.060
and ralph barrack

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.380
it couldn't have been china think about how many of these people say it

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.180
couldn't have been china it might have been an attack on china but it couldn't

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.900
have been china

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.620
was china not aware that we had this crazy

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:05.940
WHO plan was china not aware that the entire western world was set up to

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:10.660
genuflect to the who should a pandemic be declared

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.260
china wasn't aware that we were trying to get ready to

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:18.980
to to shift over to transfection and that maybe our

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:24.420
we were we were a little too aggressive too too ready to do it

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.780
so china couldn't have faked something to make us

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.300
double guess what was going on to panic

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.420
it couldn't have been china it had to have been people in the united states

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.460
how are people like robert malone and

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.460
bret wine steve and steve curse so convinced that china has nothing to do

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.260
with this i don't know if china had anything to do with it but i find it

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.180
pretty impressive how certain they are

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.100
the

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.180
virus appears to be excellent at spreading

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.940
in humans and minks and ferrets

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.900
and minks and ferrets are very closely related to each other and ferrets are

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.340
very likely to have been used in a serial passage experiment

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:10.100
the reason being that they have an ace-two receptor that looks very much like

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.740
the human ace-two receptor and so

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.100
were you going to passage the virus or its ancestor

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.700
through an animal in order to increase its infectivity in humans which would

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.380
have been necessary ferrets would have been very likely

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.460
it is also quite likely that humanized mice were

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.860
utilized humanized mice was something that was so

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:37.460
prevalent in these two years and it's so annoying because there's only one

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.740
paper in all this w i v history where they used humanized

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.860
mice for one experiment in the paper and they didn't enrich

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:54.020
the virus on humanized mice they just used humanized mice to

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:59.620
see if it could use the human ace-two receptor

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.620
so they're getting two things mixed up here again why are they getting these

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.660
two things mixed up here because they want to

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.300
because that's the idea they're trying to confuse you about the difference

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:16.180
between pandemic potential and the potential

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:21.300
to use a natural virus that you find in a

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:27.780
a bad cave and use animal uh animal passage or

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:34.020
or a cell culture to enrich two pandemic potential

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:39.380
and these two things right here have never actually been proven the

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:44.260
the ferrets you know aerosolizing the flu thing that was a pretty

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:51.380
showy paper that didn't really demonstrate that they did what they did

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:57.460
there's no specific sequence before and after the enrichment

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.180
and then a definitive dissection of the part of the virus that made it

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.220
aerosolizable

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:12.420
or what made it aerosolizable was the charges of the of the proteins on the

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.580
outside of the size of them or something there was nothing there in that

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:24.340
2011 and 2012 paper of aerosolizing avian flu or it just wasn't there

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:30.100
but ferrets were purported to be used and he also said that the fear and cleavage

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.260
site seems to be of added so stitched in

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.780
later on we would find that there are potential endonuclease sites which

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:42.980
also indicate stitching or perhaps a clone

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.820
and if the endonuclease sites indicate a clone then now we have all the evidence

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.380
that we need that it was a laboratory produced

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:54.420
RNA that was distributed around the world to be

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:59.460
indicative of the signal that could be misconstrued as a pandemic but none of

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:06.260
these things can produce a pandemic because that's not the way RNA works

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:13.060
but they needed people like Lex and Brett Weinstein and others

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.940
to have intellectual limited spectrum of debate conversations

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:22.660
about these things to make it seem logical that huh

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:27.300
I guess gain a function does happen I guess they do do it I guess it could be

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.740
I guess it could be I guess he knows more than I do

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.180
wow that's really interesting

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:38.260
so the environment that makes and ferrets are very closely related to

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.300
each other and ferrets are very likely to have been used in a

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:45.620
serial passage experiment the reason being that they have an ACE2 receptor

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:49.220
that looks very much like the human ACE2 receptor and so

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.580
were you going to passage the virus or its ancestor

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.180
through an animal in order to increase its infectivity in humans which would

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.780
have been necessary ferrets would have been very likely

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:03.940
it is also quite likely that humanized mice were

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.780
utilized and it is possible that human airway tissue

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.620
was utilized I think it is vital that we find out

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.060
what the protocols were if this came from the Wuhan Institute

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.620
we need to know it and we need to know what the protocols were

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.940
exactly because they will actually give us some tools that would be useful

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.540
in fighting SARS-CoV-2 and hopefully driving

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:28.020
into extinction which ought to be our priority

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.860
it's a priority that does not it is not apparent from our behavior

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.700
but it John Stewart did his rant about Wuhan

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:40.820
on Colbert a week before this podcast think about how extraordinary this is

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:45.540
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for that fun fact

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.940
because again the Scooby-Doo narrative was seated

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:54.900
they had a team of people they had maybe many teams

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.900
of people maybe teams in different countries in different languages

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:06.820
all of whom were coached very specifically what to say and not to say

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:11.780
enticed encouraged

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:17.460
tipped off given some special information

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:23.140
remdesivir might work you'll be a hero if you tell everybody

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:29.220
ivermectin also it might work you'll be a hero if you tell everybody

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.060
lots of different ways that egos can be massaged

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:39.860
the comfort can be offered i was offered a day trading scheme

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.700
among many other things

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:53.620
unbelievable these people really is it should be our objective if we

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.900
understood where our interests lie we would be much more

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.380
focused on it but those protocols would tell us a great deal

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.180
if it wasn't the Wuhan Institute we need to know that

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.100
if it was nature we need to know that and if it was some other laboratory we

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.540
need to figure out who what and where so that we can

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.140
determine what is what we can determine about about what was done

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.660
you're opening up my mind about why we should

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:23.460
investigate why we should know the truth of the origins of this virus

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:27.940
so you're opening my mind about why we should investigate and learn the truth

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:31.620
about the origins of the virus does that sound like

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:38.180
doesn't that sound a little bit like a scooby-doo to you

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.980
i'm starting to understand why we need to solve the mystery

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:47.140
thanks Brett you're really starting to convince me and my

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:53.140
viewers that we really need to solve this mystery

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:59.540
so for me personally let me just tell the story of my own kind of journey

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:05.060
when i first started looking into the lab leak hypothesis

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:11.300
what became terrifying to me and important to understand and obvious

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.500
is the sort of like Sam Harris way of thinking

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:21.700
which is it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly virus will eventually happen

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:26.420
my mind was it doesn't even matter so is he referring to Brett's

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.580
eighth podcast where Sam Harris says that when a pandemic

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.900
eventually happens with 75 mortality we won't be able to tolerate

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:39.540
anti-vaxxers is he referring to that

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.700
is it that much of a tight enchantment

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.300
do they expect you to be watching all these things i think they do

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.180
i think that's who he's talking to i think that's how

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.700
magnificent this is how scripted it is

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:57.700
how dumb they think we are if it happened in this case

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.660
it's obvious there's going to be happening in the future

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.860
so why the hell are we're not freaking out about this

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.260
and COVID-19 is not even that deadly relative to the possible future viruses

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.420
it's this the way i disagree with Sam on this but he thinks about this way about

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:16.020
AGI as well about artificial intelligence it's a different

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:20.340
oh artificial intelligence is also a danger to the entire world

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:24.180
wow interesting what an interesting phenomenon and what an interesting

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.780
perspective to take what an interesting idea to

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.020
seed

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.860
print discussion i think but with viruses it seems like something that could

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.780
happen on the scale of years maybe a few decades

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:42.020
AGI is a little bit farther out from me but it seemed the terrifying thing

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.180
seemed obvious that this will happen very soon

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.380
for a much deadlier virus as we get better and better

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:53.540
at both engineering viruses and doing this kind of evolutionary

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.340
driven research gain and functional research

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.700
so they're getting better and better at it it's getting cheaper and cheaper

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:04.740
it's becoming easier and easier soon and a high school biology teacher

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:08.740
is going to be doing this on the bench with high school students

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:13.380
and then just flushing it down the sink that's how easy this is that's how

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.260
cheap it's going to be

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:21.700
AI is also going to become cheaper

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:28.260
and AI is going to be more accessible and more powerful as it evolves

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:33.620
we're going to have to surrender to that too

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:39.300
okay but then you started speaking out about this as well but also started

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.740
to say no no we should hurry up and figure out the origins now

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.580
because it will help us figure out how to actually

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:52.580
respond to this particular virus how to treat this particular virus

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.260
what is in terms of vaccines in terms of antiviral drugs in terms of

01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:01.380
just and although the the the number of responses we should have

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.300
okay again this is a novel virus so we need to know where it came from so that

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.980
we can figure out what to do with it because we don't know we have no idea

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:13.940
we have no concept of what to do so this is part of the worst case scenario as

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:18.980
well because the worst case scenario requires all previous strategies to be

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:24.180
hopeless and useless and pointless because it's novel

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:29.540
again the illusion of consensus that's being laid down here

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:36.180
in June 25th 2021 these people wittingly or unwittingly are responsible for

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.700
the deaths of thousands

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:47.460
they are responsible for confusing millions of people around the world

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:52.660
and because these videos are still watched they're still responsible for

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:56.900
confusing millions of people around the world

01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:01.940
to make sure that fear uncertainty and doubt is the rule

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:07.460
and so that this mythology will be what our children pass on to their grandchildren

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:12.260
and these people are responsible they are not playing on our team ladies and

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.660
gentlemen

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:22.180
i still am much more freaking out about the future

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:25.940
maybe you can break that apart a little bit

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:35.220
which are you most focused on now which are you most freaking out about now in

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.900
terms of the importance of figuring out the origins of this virus

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:43.140
i am most freaking out about both of them because they're both really

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.340
important and you know we can put bounds on this

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.740
let me say first that this is a perfect test case for the theory of close calls

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.460
because as much as covid is a disaster it is also a close call from which we

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.420
can learn much you are absolutely right if we keep

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.940
playing this game in the lab it's not very indifferent not

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:06.500
unlike what paul katrel says you know that it was a red dragon event

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.940
that we can learn from it the next time it's going to be worse it's all

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:16.820
again laying down well if this wasn't the worst case scenario we were lucky

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:22.980
and next time it with this just underscores the potential is there

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:28.180
so don't you see how important it is that the worst case scenario still is

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.620
a potential it doesn't need to be met here

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:36.260
if it's not met now during these circumstances in new york

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:41.140
the jessica hockett is identified as no evidence of spread

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.100
that people have identified as no evidence of spread in

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:51.140
italy and other places these signals according to bret weinstein at this

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:57.220
time were the way that they were because of lockdown

01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.700
because of the strict measures that were taken

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:08.100
and he he is responsible for telling that story

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.980
telling the story that the lack of that that that covered up

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.580
the lack of evidence of spread that covered up the malfeasance that were

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.260
the protocols that were in new york

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.860
because at that time he had a platform he was waxing intellectual about what

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.180
was going on and this is how he was waxing intellectual about it

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:36.020
lab leak worst case scenario we don't know what's going on

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:43.060
and so all bets are off i'm wearing a bandana and glasses good for you guys

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:51.220
and he wants to take no responsibility for that he wants you to forget

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:55.860
that the reason why all the teachers in pennsylvania that watched his podcast

01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:02.820
were not at all worried that maybe those kids need to be in school

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.660
maybe we're making a big mistake here

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.620
maybe we should be better leaders as adults

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:16.660
and use common sense and advocate for the sacred biology that i was raised

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:20.180
with in the common sense that my grandma raised me with no

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:25.460
because of influencers like him because we were trapped at home

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:30.500
and because it wasn't just him but it was lots of other people

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:36.740
on every social media platform by design pushing the worst case scenario the

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.900
the possibility it's just the possibility

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.020
if it wasn't this time it will be next time

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.940
as we get ever better at making these things and it becomes cheaper as Lex

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.860
said don't you hear it

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:56.500
they want you to tell this story to your kid they want you to explain it to your

01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:04.420
kid and we win when we don't we win when we explain away

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:10.580
these lies if we are not if we are especially if we do it under pressure

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.540
and when we are told that a virus is going to leap from nature

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.740
any day and that the more we know the better we'll be able to fight it we're

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:20.820
going to create going to leap if we are especially if we do it under pressure

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.780
and when we are told that a virus is going to leap from nature

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.900
any day and that the more we know the better we'll be able to fight it we're

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:30.820
going to create the disaster all the sooner

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:35.140
so yes that should be an absolute focus the fact that there were people saying

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.740
that this was dangerous back in 2015

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.660
otto tell us something the fact that the system bypassed a ban and

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.740
offshored the work to china otto tell us this is not a chinese failure this is

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:51.380
a failure of something larger and harder to see

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.820
but i also think that there's a there's a

01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:01.140
clock ticking with respect to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID the disease that it creates

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:05.220
and that has to do with whether or not we are stuck with it permanently

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.220
so if you think about the cost to humanity of being stuck with influenza

01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:13.380
it's an immense cost year after year and we just stop thinking about it because

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.660
it's there some years you get the flu most years you don't

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:20.020
maybe you get the vaccine to prevent it maybe the vaccine isn't particularly

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.300
well targeted but imagine just simply doubling that cost

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.380
imagine we get stuck with SARS-CoV-2 and its descendants

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:34.420
going forward and that it just settles in and becomes a fact of

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:38.500
modern human life that would be a disaster so is he

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:43.460
is he seeding a narrative about a novel virus that leaked from a

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.580
laboratory and became endemic that we had to have countermeasures

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:53.540
and new protocols and new behavior forever

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:59.380
was he seeding a narrative of a laboratory leaked gain a function

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:04.260
virus that inadvertently because we didn't react in time or with strong

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:10.260
enough stringent enough measures became endemic but it was a potential

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.100
situation we could have avoided

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:20.180
do you hear what i'm hearing i hear worst case scenario

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:24.340
and i hear worst case scenario being hyped up as an opportunity to avoid if

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.860
we would just get our heads out

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:35.940
ladies and gentlemen this is not a man making honest mistakes trying to guide

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.020
his viewers and those people that listen to Lex's podcast

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.540
safely through the dark cave of the pandemic

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:50.500
this is a man who is being paid comfort and fame and promises of

01:28:50.500 --> 01:29:00.580
membership in some club to serve the purpose of crafting this limited

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.860
spectrum debate that i call the scooby-doo

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:08.740
solving the lab leak narrative has made everybody believe that there's an

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:12.260
ongoing pandemic and that has trapped our children in believing

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.980
that these things were all necessary that all these

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.740
adults were doing the right thing

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.980
we have to dispel these lies ladies and gentlemen and we don't have that much

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.780
time to do it

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:31.540
we don't have that much time to do it

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:43.700
we don't have that much time to do it ladies and gentlemen

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:54.900
oh i have that the wrong slide sorry

01:29:54.980 --> 01:30:00.340
um we don't have that much time to do it

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:07.780
these books are all out there the mythology is well documented

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.260
the stories are well documented the quotes are well documented people's

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.860
claims are well documented

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:21.620
and so we've got big big work to do but there's a little tricks inside of this

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.540
book there's little pieces inside of this book that we can use

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:29.620
it's not perfect i can't claim perfection i didn't

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:34.820
i wasn't able to convince robert f Kennedy jr that there was no pandemic

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:39.540
that rna can't do it i wasn't able to convince him

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:45.060
i i got a chance to pitch it once in an email

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:49.940
and then i got seven and a half minutes to try and hastily explain it

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:55.620
on a podcast with him and then he gave the floor to robert melone for 35

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.700
minutes and then to maryll nass for 10 more minutes

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:04.580
and then to jessica rose for five minutes and then to test lorry for five more

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.900
minutes

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:16.580
what was going to be a podcast of me presenting to bobby turned out to be a

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.220
presentation me giving an elevator pitch to robert melone and maryll nass and

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:28.180
jessica rose and test lorry and so exploring the idea of what a clone

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:32.580
was and how it could be used in the many different ways that it could be used

01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:37.620
either a spike protein alone a protein alone or a whole complement of proteins

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:42.420
including an RNA dependent RNA polymerase

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:47.860
but we know and we know how long we've been saying it we know what the

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.940
reaction of all these people was

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:59.940
we know what the reaction of all these people was

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:05.220
it's the biology that everybody ignores the only one that's ever used the word

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:09.460
infectious clone is david martin and he's been using it for

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.340
replication

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:21.940
defective infectious clone and he uses it in a way to imply that because they

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:28.500
can engineer replication defective infectious clones

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:34.100
then there are replication competent infectious clones ones that can pandemic

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:41.380
and go bananas and that a replication defective clone could

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:50.580
revert to replication competent and so pandemic potential is reinforced

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:55.380
in david martin's story about infectious clones where as in my story of infectious

01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.740
clones infectious clones are a way of overcoming

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:07.620
limitations of RNA replication and the sort of shadowy

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:13.860
non high fidelity nature of RNA replication

01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:18.500
and for some reason after years almost two years of explaining it all these

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.420
people just seem to ignore it much in the same way that they ignore

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:29.460
the fact that john bodewin and and and uh then he ran core

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:40.020
and jessica hocket and jonathan angler have all found pretty strong evidence for

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:46.420
no evidence of spread pretty strong evidence of mass casualty events being

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.740
misconstrued as the original seeding event of

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:54.900
what should have been spread but wasn't

01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:02.900
and so just like all these people go to as far as romania

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:10.020
in order to curate this narrative it's the same people

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.700
it's the same people who are curating this worst case scenario narrative and

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.780
making sure that as little as three days ago robert melone said

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:26.660
this is a laboratory leak

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.980
and try as i might i can't seem to get denny rancor to complain at all about

01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:37.300
any of the people that he had breakfast with in romania despite the fact that

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:43.780
none of them seem to be able to tweet or to state out loud that there's no

01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:47.780
evidence of spread i don't care if denny says it in

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.540
a million interviews i don't care if denny says it on

01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:56.420
alex jones what's important is that this guy doesn't say it

01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:01.460
to his million followers what's important is this guy doesn't say it to his

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:05.300
million followers what's important is this woman doesn't say it to her million

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.860
followers

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.100
none of them say it even though they all met denny they all saw his

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:18.100
impressive they all did a sub stack but they all don't say it they keep not

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:23.140
saying it and when brett was on tucker he didn't say it either

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.980
he said 17 million people were killed by the shot

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.980
but he didn't say 500 000 people were killed by opioids in the last two and

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:33.620
a half years

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:39.140
and that that might be a confounding factor in all this excess death we

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.500
don't really know what's going on no no no all kinds of certainty

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.740
here

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:50.340
in 2020 and 2021 there's nothing to see there according to all these people

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:54.500
because they don't want to do this math they don't want to talk about there's

01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:00.020
being zero epidemiological evidence of spread because of this math

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:08.180
they don't want you to talk about the huge medicare costs that were avoided

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:19.220
they don't want to talk about strict liability for all of these pharmaceutical

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:23.620
products they don't use the words they don't want to talk about how the vicp

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:27.460
and the cicp are actually fundamental violations

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:31.300
of your seventh amendment right in that we could just throw a million

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:38.100
you know 50 cases in every state single cases of vaccine injury

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.540
only one of them has to get to a federal circuit and only one federal circuit

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.300
has to say oh you're right it's a violation of your seventh

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:50.100
amendment ability to sue for damages that's a pretty dumb law we should get

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:56.340
rid of that law boom there goes struck but nobody's

01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.820
using that strategy nobody's using that strategy

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:05.540
everybody's using the administrative kangaroo court that pays for claims that

01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:12.580
aren't even valid all hours are paid even when you lose

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:18.020
so what lawyer is not going to do that that's the best deal in law

01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:21.140
and all the people that are using that right now don't talk about strict

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.780
liability at all they don't use the words and they don't talk about

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:30.980
seventh amendment being a possible way of attacking it they just don't

01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:35.380
now that is interesting because you know it could be

01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:38.180
lawyers can see it as a violation because

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:41.380
or not a violation but a conflict of interest because they know that they

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:44.820
can get more money for their client they might be able to serve their

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:48.340
client better if they use the cicp or the vicp

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.780
then if they went the seventh amendment way and then the case got dismissed they

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.580
would get nothing

01:37:55.060 --> 01:38:02.420
and so it's very easy to see a poor family with medical bills wants to get

01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:05.700
some money doesn't want to pay any lawyers to do it

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:10.340
and a lawyer gets paid if he goes that way well then you know there it is

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:13.620
the system is set up for this never to happen and everybody that gets

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.180
elevated and it's going anywhere isn't letting it happen

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:23.060
either you could at least talk about it

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.340
so we know how it was done it's a teamwork case scenario

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:35.140
and a strict sort of rule on what you can talk about it what you can't talk

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.620
about it so that the virus spike protein and

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.540
transfection could be confounded

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:45.620
and so that our children will be trapped in this new world order forever

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:51.140
once the lie becomes truth they will be right one more

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.580
one more college season maybe

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.820
one more year where they bring back the masks and the kids comply

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:08.180
is it right now is it this year that they're going to fundamentally destroy

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:11.860
the fabric of america based on the fault line that they've dug so deep

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:17.940
is that the reason why the pandemic scooby-doo laid right on red and blue

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:25.860
raid laid right on fox news and msnbc fault lines i think so

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.980
and so we need to work on amend making amends with our neighbors and our

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:36.420
friends and our family we need to close these gaps before they are exploited

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:43.140
and they will be exploited because this is the plan to the lie to become truth

01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:49.460
for our kids to get on this train where vaccination is magic and it's the greatest

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:54.660
thing since buttered bread where novel viruses can jump just like bryer

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.660
just like you heard Brett say to Lex of course they could jump they do it all the time

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:06.500
a symptomatic spread is real and gain a function research is too we can't let them

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.140
get on this train ladies and gentlemen we cannot let them get on this train

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.380
you got to get our kids off this train right now

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:26.580
i was going to do that but i think i'm just going to do this one really quick and then

01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:30.260
we're out that's it i guess i'm only skipping three slides

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.700
so this is where we are right ladies and gentlemen we are in year five of an ongoing

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:42.340
RNA viral pandemic and we need to crack this biology RNA cannot do that

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.060
the no-virus people were correct the RNA cannot do that

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:55.060
we need to secede that we need to seed that to those people like Steph and Lanka

01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.740
we need them back in the forefront of talking about this stuff so that we can start to push

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:08.980
this ball forward this faith in a novel virus has to be broken and then once we break this one

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:15.140
we can start working on the rest of the vaccine schedule as an illusion especially the vaccine

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:22.340
schedule in America the one that nobody talks about ladies and gentlemen we need to do it we

01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:29.140
need to do it now the faith is is an illusion it's a background signal at best at best it's a

01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:38.740
background signal at worst it's all lies probably somewhere in between but we need to call for

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.660
a pause on the childhood vaccination schedule we need to call for strict liability and all

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:48.820
pharmaceutical products we need to investigate this as an orchestrated mass casualty event

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:55.780
theater being misconstrued as evidence of a pandemic we need to investigate the possibility

01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:00.980
that transfection was used to see the molecular signal we need to take back sovereignty over

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:06.500
our bodies and those of our children and we need to get out of the who get rid of the cdc

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:13.060
get out of the un for now i think at least out of the seat out of the who and get rid of our cdc

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.940
as it stands how to see the medlers they won't talk about childhood vaccinations at all

01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:26.020
they won't talk about strict liability they won't talk about the deadly protocols no one's

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:31.140
talking about them still including Brett Brett won't apologize for not speaking out against

01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:36.980
remdesivir Brett won't apologize for not speaking out sooner against transfection Brett's not gonna

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:42.180
apologize for any of that stuff to do with masks and lockdowns and the developmental damage

01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:47.300
that kids were done the young kids that had to wear masks because he thought it was a great idea

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:54.900
just like just like Stephen Hatfield thought it was a great idea to lock down and put masks on

01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:01.860
kids so did Brett Weinstein they don't use the words clone or transfection to explain anything

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:07.300
they attack people instead of ideas and so they didn't talk about any of the ideas that we're

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:13.220
talking about they just talked about themselves and about their suffering and their perceived

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:20.900
censorship and they refuse to summarize across the entire show and you can see that very clearly

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:25.620
in that Lex Friedman interview where he says the boy i've always been very scared that they're

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:35.540
gonna manufacture evidence about a natural virus now why would they need to do that if viruses

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:42.980
exist and there's 1.7 million viruses waiting to jump why would they need to manufacture

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:52.020
evidence about a natural viral zoonosis why would there be so much incentive for them to fake that

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:59.060
and no incentive for them to fake the bioweapon no incentive to fake the bioweapon lab leak

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.420
it's an elaborate psychological operation

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:16.900
that features winning and unwitting participants that have been acting out an elaborate Scooby-Doo

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:24.100
mystery solving event where they argued and debated with an unlimited spectrum which made you accept

01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:32.020
the existence of that pandemic virus so that over the next few years they could shift our children

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:37.700
and their children into a new system of governance that would allow the collection of all of their

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:45.220
genetic and molecular cellular whatever data they can get because they need to give this data to

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:54.260
their coming artificial general intelligence which again Lex Friedman is there to so succinctly

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:59.860
seed into the narrative while they're talking about the pandemic it's coming ladies and gentlemen

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.140
please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:12.180
by any means necessary and that's a fact i really think it's true i think we've cracked it

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.340
they're trying to eliminate the control group and intramuscular injection of any combination

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.460
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is a dumb

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:26.100
transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent in viruses or not patterned

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:32.180
integrity sorry i've been gone for the last couple days um we are having to reorient

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:39.700
everything in the household and in the process of the day because um giggle and biological is

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:47.940
once again become my day job and that means i'm my and my family of five is fully dependent on the

01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:56.820
subscriptions on the support and on the sharing of my work um so one-time donations one-time

01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:02.420
subscriptions whatever you can afford would be great um we're gonna up the the ante a little

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:11.060
bit starting next week um hopefully with regular pdfs and regular journal clubs and other things

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:18.260
because again this is gonna be if possible um a full-time gig for me now it's the way it has to

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:24.580
be at this stage um and going forward i'm just going to jump out of this airplane and see

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:31.140
what catches me we've got 92 subscribers right now i think i need about 900 to sustain this

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.900
so if you can uh you can find me here at giggleonbiological.com

01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.820
you can also find me at giggleon.vio you can also find a number to call an email to call

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:48.500
and i don't get many messages i don't get many calls and i usually answer or reply to all of

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:54.500
them um so take a chance leave a message um you might even get me live and i just might answer

01:46:55.140 --> 01:47:03.140
um anyway uh there's where you can subscribe um if i had 900 of these guys or 900 of these guys

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:11.300
we'd be we'd be unstoppable um so let's that that's what i want to do um we've got 90 some odd right

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:16.980
now here and that are listening and sharing the work and i can't thank all of them enough for having

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:25.860
the guts to do it um for having the commitment to do it my my family my wife my kids um we all

01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:32.660
thank you very very much and uh i will see you again tomorrow long weekend got a lot of work to do

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:39.060
um i actually had to switch one of my computers out of the rig and it it just it did not work

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:45.060
um so i've been spending a day and a half trying to get an old Macintosh to talk to a couple things

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:49.780
that i probably shouldn't have updated whatever it's a long story um thank you very much for joining

01:47:49.780 --> 01:48:00.260
me and i'll see you again tomorrow this is gonna work here like that

01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:07.540
i believe that is much more likely it's a lab leak
