WEBVTT

00:03.054 --> 00:03.255
you

00:40.862 --> 00:46.480
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

00:47.159 --> 00:59.385
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, and okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because, you know, not that many people die from it.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.686
It's just a big hassle in the end.

01:02.286 --> 01:08.289
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality, and it's not,

01:14.633 --> 01:17.976
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.597
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

01:22.038 --> 01:42.152
Introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:43.328 --> 01:51.850
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment.

01:53.971 --> 01:55.532
I think truth is good for kids.

01:55.972 --> 01:59.793
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.873
We want everybody to feel good.

02:01.893 --> 02:04.274
That's not the way life is.

02:06.775 --> 02:10.636
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:12.486 --> 02:13.206
And I have lied.

02:13.226 --> 02:14.247
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.947
I don't want to lie, you know?

02:16.067 --> 02:17.047
I don't think I'm a liar.

02:17.147 --> 02:18.168
I try not to be a liar.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.048
I don't want to be a liar.

02:19.628 --> 02:22.389
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

02:24.689 --> 02:27.830
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.111
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:32.132 --> 02:32.512
Isolation?

02:32.552 --> 02:32.832
What was that?

02:32.852 --> 02:36.033
Isolation and purification.

02:36.053 --> 02:36.673
Of the virus?

02:36.813 --> 02:36.993
Yes.

02:38.253 --> 02:40.574
Well, you isolate a virus by, um...

02:43.686 --> 03:09.078
uh... finding the virus which causes a disease you purify a virus by making a lot of I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus I don't understand what the issue they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different no it depends on how they used it can you explain the process of hiv isolation

03:12.278 --> 03:14.239
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

03:14.319 --> 03:20.341
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:20.421 --> 03:22.481
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:27.203 --> 03:29.464
It's literally turning into a worst-case scenario.

03:29.484 --> 03:32.585
The latest data tells us that we're dealing with, essentially, a worst-case scenario.

03:42.685 --> 03:45.447
He is the life of parties he has never attended.

03:47.648 --> 03:51.691
If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.

03:51.711 --> 03:55.613
When in Rome, they do as he does.

03:57.274 --> 04:00.136
He is the most interesting man in the world.

04:02.758 --> 04:08.541
I don't always ruin things, but when I do, I prefer the great reset.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.823
Stay awake, my friends.

04:21.556 --> 04:24.518
Senator Mendoza is one of the most respected citizens in this state, McBain.

04:24.898 --> 04:30.782
And yet you ran his limo off a cliff, broke the necks of three of his bodyguards, and drove a bus to his front door?

04:30.822 --> 04:34.404
Captain, I have proof that he's head of an international drug cartel!

04:34.484 --> 04:36.146
I don't wanna hear it, McBain!

04:36.506 --> 04:41.209
You're outta here!

04:42.830 --> 04:44.191
That makes two of us.

05:26.343 --> 05:53.641
Any minute now My ship is coming in I'll keep checking the horizon And I'll stand on the bow And feel the waves come crashing

05:57.412 --> 06:17.392
Crashing down, down, down on me And you say, be still my love Open up your heart, let the light shine

06:21.696 --> 06:32.510
Don't you understand I already have a plan I'm waiting for my real life to begin

06:52.054 --> 07:13.785
Suddenly nothing happened But in my dreams I slew the dragon down this beaten path Up this cobbled lane

07:21.980 --> 07:47.003
footsteps once again and you say just be here now forget about the past your mask is wearing thin let me throw one more dice I know that I can win

07:49.577 --> 08:02.302
I'm waiting for my real life to begin Any minute now My shipper's coming in

08:18.390 --> 08:44.189
I'll keep checking the horizon And I'll check my machine I'm sure to be that call It's gonna happen soon Soon, oh so very soon

08:46.716 --> 09:05.011
It's just the times are lean And you say, be still my love Open up your heart, let the light shine in Don't you understand?

09:05.652 --> 09:13.479
Oh, I already have a plan I'm waiting for my real life to begin

10:02.176 --> 10:13.766
On a clear day I can see See for a long way On a clear day I can see See for a long

10:49.563 --> 11:08.361
It's a beautiful day out here.

11:26.781 --> 11:30.923
I swear Solar Flare 9 comes in and says, nice intro today.

11:30.963 --> 11:34.465
And then I blew the sound transition to this first slide here.

11:34.525 --> 11:35.986
Thank you very much for the compliment.

11:36.586 --> 11:37.487
Welcome to the show.

11:37.547 --> 11:39.048
Good to see everybody in the chat.

11:40.048 --> 11:43.190
Sorry, I missed the 11.11 start time as usual.

11:43.350 --> 11:46.692
It's just trying to juggle all these things in the background.

11:46.772 --> 11:51.294
And since I don't have my four assistants, my family's not here right now.

11:51.314 --> 11:54.456
You know, I'm making the sandwiches and also

11:55.751 --> 11:57.364
putting the chickens out and this kind of thing.

11:58.706 --> 12:04.689
It's very easy to realize how much my wife does when she's not here and how well I have it.

12:05.570 --> 12:09.232
And so I'm very thankful for that and that they can have that time away.

12:10.993 --> 12:19.917
Again, it's also partly due to the support that people provide this stream that my family is able to be over there for a little while with my wife's family.

12:20.118 --> 12:22.399
And so thank you to all of you for that as well.

12:23.119 --> 12:26.941
If we invest money in anything besides rent, it's actually that.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.024
And so, yeah, if...

12:41.357 --> 12:42.858
So anyway, here we are.

12:42.878 --> 12:51.003
We're still trying to get the word out about the basic gist of the narrative being wrong, that there was no evidence of spread in New York City or really anywhere in the world.

12:52.224 --> 13:09.335
Infectious clones are the only real thing we need to understand about virology and placebo batches and how they were likely used and the whole idea of transformation and transfection that even Bret Weinstein still can't seem to dedicate more than a sentence to.

13:10.939 --> 13:19.465
when in reality understanding transfection and transformation is at the heart of our inability to have exercised informed consent when it would have mattered.

13:20.505 --> 13:27.910
And informed consent was also not possible because we weren't being told the truth about what was happening.

13:27.970 --> 13:35.655
I'm gonna slip out of here for a second and restart again just to make sure that we get a smooth video here.

13:37.136 --> 13:39.838
So they fooled us into solving the mystery of the

13:40.979 --> 13:51.419
of the origins of the virus and commitment to those lies about that are where we are right now and they did it with weaponized piles of money they did it with social media they did it with

13:52.259 --> 13:58.922
with programming social media to create this and reinforce the limited spectrum of debate.

13:59.602 --> 14:05.964
And that limited spectrum of debate allowed us or sort of coerced us into accepting the existence of the novel virus.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.685
And that's where we are today.

14:07.725 --> 14:09.486
We're accepting that mythology.

14:10.066 --> 14:17.389
And anybody that doesn't accept that mythology is just attributed bad motives or, you know, white supremacist or something like this.

14:17.429 --> 14:18.169
And that's where we are.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.291
And it's these weaponized piles of money that aren't recent developments.

14:23.371 --> 14:29.920
They are weaponized piles of money, the largest of which descend from weaponized piles of money like the Dutch East Indies Company.

14:31.422 --> 14:34.527
And the British version of that as well.

14:37.958 --> 14:43.028
I find it always really curious that very few of these historians ever mention the Dutch East Indies Company.

14:43.048 --> 14:47.816
It's always the other one, the British East Indies Company or whatever that one was.

14:48.498 --> 14:50.581
There were two and they competed with each other.

14:51.949 --> 14:54.910
And the Dutch one was also a giant pile of money.

14:54.930 --> 14:59.751
So we've got to show as many people this history as we can while we're showing them the future.

15:00.492 --> 15:12.095
Or at least the future that these futurists like Ray Kurzweiler and Metzel and these kinds of people have planned for us.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.202
And yeah, we have to learn the history of the vaccination program.

15:20.243 --> 15:22.064
We have to learn the history of the AIDS virus.

15:22.084 --> 15:24.605
We have to learn the history of chronic fatigue syndrome.

15:25.086 --> 15:43.197
We have to learn the history of Judy Mikovits and learn the early history of Robert Malone and the people that he studied retroviruses with or we're never gonna be able to take back power from these charlatans because they inherited the power from their mentors and those mentors had power over our family.

15:43.678 --> 15:44.958
And so if we wanna take back

15:45.899 --> 16:12.247
the charlatans power we're gonna have to look back into the history of where they got it not only do we have to understand the mythology and how it is contradictory to everything we know about biology but we have to understand why these people were necessary for us to be bamboozled this time and why these people are actually what fifth generation warfare is it is the combination of these people

16:13.691 --> 16:20.063
and these people that makes fifth generation warfare possible, that actually makes it happen.

16:21.969 --> 16:29.234
And if we're going to make gentle the life of this world, we're going to have to break all of these illusions about our history, all of these illusions about what we know.

16:30.134 --> 16:47.386
And we're going to have to break them with our children by our side, with their hands in our hands, as we show them this illusion of consensus that extends into our history and how America as a republic has been usurped a long time ago by traitors with

16:48.246 --> 16:52.048
with loyalties to other powers.

16:54.189 --> 17:09.217
And as we set our children off into the future as young adults, we're going to be sending them off into the future either where they understand how this illusion is created, they understand how this illusion of consensus is weaponized against us, or they don't.

17:11.175 --> 17:20.097
And so I think it's a really crucial time in American history for us to stay focused on the biology and the history, to stay focused on not taking their bait on social media.

17:20.177 --> 17:23.738
Case in point was this past weekend and Love Your Neighbor.

17:23.778 --> 17:28.280
Now I'm not saying at all that what happened this past weekend is fake.

17:28.320 --> 17:35.642
What I'm saying is, is that they've shaken our understanding so much that our default assumption is that it's fake.

17:36.962 --> 17:37.962
That's a bad one.

17:38.402 --> 17:40.023
That's a really bad assumption.

17:41.030 --> 17:51.638
Unfortunately, we don't want to be in a scenario where we're assuming that everything is fake because then they can get away with anything with the combination of, well, it might be fake and incompetence.

17:53.199 --> 17:56.161
That's why we've got to realize that there are things we can know.

17:57.383 --> 18:00.205
And we need to spread the word about what we know each week.

18:01.505 --> 18:18.676
Spread it all the time, because the more you spread it, the more likely it is that this thing is going to become a self-sustaining jogger knot, where we can help other people join the independent bright web and fight against this illusion on the internet, the illusion on social media.

18:19.116 --> 18:19.957
And that's what it is.

18:20.037 --> 18:22.138
It's an illusion, the entire thing.

18:22.298 --> 18:26.481
YouTube, Facebook, Gab, Discord.

18:27.361 --> 18:40.626
Twitter, X, whatever you want to call it, is one of the most amazing examples of how we were told that the town square is X. You know, the town square is X. No, I'm sorry, it's not.

18:40.686 --> 18:50.090
And we need to have a serious paradigm shift about that in our young people so that they understand the breadth and the depth of how social media has been weaponized against us.

18:50.150 --> 18:51.751
It's not a random algorithm.

18:52.491 --> 18:54.252
It's not a random algorithm.

18:54.292 --> 18:56.573
And the illusion is sustained when you believe that.

18:57.333 --> 19:22.189
when you think that your posts go viral by accident when you think that people rise because they're just lucky and so you just keep playing the lottery hoping that you're gonna win you've got to engage in non-compliance especially on social media and i'm gonna try and lead the way i haven't been on twitter today yet and i don't know if i'm gonna be again um i don't know we've got to be careful ladies and gentlemen because it's ramping up

19:51.935 --> 19:52.656
I tell you what.

19:54.594 --> 20:06.485
What a crazy place we are in when, as host of this broadcast, I feel necessary to say that if we start with the default that everything is fake, we may be in a very dangerous position.

20:06.565 --> 20:11.410
But of course, with respect to the pandemic, everything wasn't fake.

20:13.411 --> 20:15.854
With respect to the pandemic, everything wasn't fake.

20:15.894 --> 20:16.614
People died.

20:17.235 --> 20:18.216
People were murdered.

20:19.571 --> 20:24.873
People were given 60 liters a minute of supplementary oxygen before they were put on ventilators.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.595
People were given ventilators when they could talk.

20:28.715 --> 20:30.636
People were given remdesivir.

20:32.516 --> 20:43.461
But understanding how this illusion was used against us to create the assumption that something novel was there despite all of this murder is at the heart of this illusion.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.903
And so starting with the default that everything is fake,

20:49.028 --> 20:50.049
is not what we've done.

20:50.489 --> 21:05.223
We started with the default that this was a lab leak, and we have settled after four and a half years on the idea that a lab leak, irrespective of whether it could happen and be detectable, would not result in a pandemic, because RNA can't do that.

21:06.155 --> 21:08.136
But I'm a human just like you.

21:08.776 --> 21:13.619
And so I made a lot of mistakes in this pandemic thinking I was doing the right thing.

21:14.359 --> 21:21.602
But the important thing to realize is over the course of my record, over the last four and a half years, I have a record of integrity.

21:21.662 --> 21:22.283
I've corrected.

21:23.211 --> 21:27.814
I've criticized the people that were supposedly on my team when I thought it was necessary.

21:28.614 --> 21:37.120
And it has resulted in me basically being a soloist in this attempt to escape from this matrix.

21:38.021 --> 21:49.148
So in that idea, I want to start with a... Oh, see, and now I screwed this up too.

21:49.628 --> 21:50.308
Gosh, darn it.

21:53.823 --> 22:00.267
I really need a little intern in here that can do this for me and get this focus up to speed right away.

22:00.287 --> 22:02.509
And I don't even have my curtain down.

22:02.529 --> 22:08.632
I have my curtain up because the drums are back there.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.033
Hold on one second.

22:10.354 --> 22:11.975
My cord is not going to let me do this.

22:12.475 --> 22:13.235
My bad.

22:13.315 --> 22:14.396
This is so annoying.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.597
Lucky.

22:19.997 --> 22:23.741
The curtain is on a magnet so it can be brought in real easy.

22:26.864 --> 22:27.385
There we go.

22:27.405 --> 22:42.260
I'm gonna start the show today with a clip from The Matrix because I want you to understand a little bit what I think is a crucial moment that we're at right now where I think we can actually pause the program.

22:43.737 --> 22:51.241
And so what I'd like to do is start with this little movie, and then let me just kind of give you an idea of what I mean here.

22:51.561 --> 22:56.484
And I'm sure it's not going to take a lot of explanation.

22:56.524 --> 22:58.545
I'll get rid of the moving stuff here for a second.

23:05.048 --> 23:06.049
Wait, what's going on here?

23:07.619 --> 23:08.421
Did I start with that?

23:08.481 --> 23:09.102
Oh, yeah, sorry.

23:09.162 --> 23:14.232
So, you know, intraoscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

23:14.272 --> 23:17.218
Transfixion in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.952
And RNA cannot pandemic.

23:20.453 --> 23:23.455
I've already said this once in the introduction, but I will say it again.

23:24.616 --> 23:27.439
Weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about this.

23:27.499 --> 23:29.441
And by arguing about it, we've accepted it.

23:29.661 --> 23:39.310
And all sides of the narrative were coordinated and controlled and amplified in such a way that it was very difficult for any of us to escape this argument in 20 and 21.

23:41.272 --> 23:50.560
And because we all engaged in this argument with or without our willing participation, we engaged in this argument and therefore we accepted its premises.

23:50.620 --> 24:07.415
And that's the magic trick, of course, that Noam Chomsky talks about when he says that the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum.

24:08.331 --> 24:20.982
And that is very similar to a statement made in 1924 in a book by Edward Bernays, where he says, the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element of democratic society.

24:29.210 --> 24:30.491
The Matrix is a system, Neil.

24:32.421 --> 24:33.882
That system is our enemy.

24:34.522 --> 24:36.883
When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

24:36.943 --> 24:43.705
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save.

24:44.125 --> 24:49.247
But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.

24:49.307 --> 24:53.749
You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

24:54.569 --> 25:00.592
And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

25:03.131 --> 25:04.251
Were you listening to me, Neo?

25:05.192 --> 25:06.692
Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

25:07.413 --> 25:07.713
I was.

25:07.893 --> 25:08.353
Look again.

25:10.214 --> 25:10.574
Freeze it.

25:14.356 --> 25:20.378
And so here he's talking about how people that are in the Matrix and aren't ready to be unplugged are part of it.

25:21.378 --> 25:27.061
Now, what you need to see is on Twitter and on Facebook, you don't see what your friends and your family see.

25:27.761 --> 25:32.223
And what they see is an illusion of consensus that's created by those programs.

25:33.410 --> 25:50.125
an illusion of consensus that despite the fact that they also follow you, despite the fact that they also get your posts, they are seeing an illusion of consensus that leads them to conclusions that include their friend is probably not totally on board with reality.

25:51.772 --> 26:18.523
And so, although this is a Hollywood representation of this kind of a control mechanism and it involves elaborate bodies and big apparatuses and robots carrying and controlling them, you can think very usefully about how your phone controls the conscious thoughts of your children, controls the conscious thoughts of your family.

26:20.441 --> 26:30.044
Very similarly to this, because when your phone, when your kids look at their phone, they see a consensus that isn't composed of their brothers and sisters and their mom and dad.

26:30.824 --> 26:41.407
They see a consensus that could be composed of hundreds of their peers, or even worse, what they imagine is hundreds of their peers.

26:44.372 --> 27:03.563
And so when this show talks about stopping the program, what you see is we have an opportunity right now to stop this program, to show people exactly how it has been weaponized against us right now in this instance of time.

27:04.444 --> 27:06.625
And if we stop the program right now,

27:08.550 --> 27:10.652
And we get this program to stop.

27:11.132 --> 27:13.634
Sorry, I'm looking at the camera, but I'm waiting for that thing to stop.

27:13.694 --> 27:27.265
If we stop the program right now and show people where we are, show people all these different people and how they're connected to one another and how implausible it is for them to have the position that they have.

27:28.274 --> 27:50.463
with the opinion that they have, with the track record that they have, with the career trajectories that they have, you will see that we are currently at a place in the story where there's so many contradictory narratives, so many characters have come together that should never have come together, that we can actually show it to people and say, pause the program.

27:52.244 --> 27:54.144
Let me show you what's going on right now.

27:54.204 --> 27:55.585
We can show that to people.

27:56.869 --> 28:17.877
And I've been trying to do it with pictures like this and descriptions of how these different groups of people are organized around ideas because I've tried to show people how, because of my intense engagement since I've been trying so hard to solve the Scooby-Doo mystery, I'm one of the few people who's experienced the level of contradiction that I have.

28:19.167 --> 28:31.856
Most people have not engaged with so many people across the spectrum trying to understand and communicate with them to really get a feel for how these people are working together.

28:32.937 --> 28:42.624
Because otherwise it just seems like they have disparate ideas or they disagree on things because their background is different or because they come from different perspectives or they're trying to save a different career than the other guy.

28:43.956 --> 28:54.420
And those are all lies, and they become very clear once we've realized who's not talking about 2020 and who's saying the shots are bad and contaminated with double-stranded DNA.

28:55.601 --> 28:56.801
Still to today.

28:58.542 --> 29:06.025
And once you realize that, you can see that these people were organized into a various lollapalooza of liars, different stages.

29:07.093 --> 29:10.516
And they've been all performing with one goal, to mislead the young.

29:10.536 --> 29:12.758
And I'm not talking about young, like kids.

29:13.258 --> 29:28.892
I'm talking about college age kids and young parents, people 30 and under, that still don't have the adult experience necessary to understand that other adults will lie, cheat, and steal when it's for all the marbles.

29:30.049 --> 29:38.837
when there are ladders that you climb where you're not allowed to look down, ladders that you climb where there are curtains, you're not allowed to look behind as long as you keep climbing, it's fine.

29:39.478 --> 29:42.761
There are people in the United States who really still believe.

29:43.181 --> 29:55.252
There are people that work in universities that really still believe that the vast majority of people in government and in corporations don't cheat, don't lie, and would never steal in order to get ahead.

29:57.116 --> 30:07.801
And it is in this pretense that we have naively assumed that all of those people over there would never lie and cheat and steal in order to rise up in the power structure of governance.

30:09.502 --> 30:11.883
But it's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

30:11.923 --> 30:20.126
And so as long as they stay committed to the idea that we have to fear free-range RNA molecules, they can basically say whatever they want to.

30:20.887 --> 30:21.447
And they have.

30:26.502 --> 30:42.831
And so very recently we've had this huge crossover where Steve Kirsch has now amplified Andrew Kaufman, who was identified as the ringleader of the no-virus people in February of 2020 by none other than Kevin McCairn.

30:45.700 --> 30:50.764
my own personal clown show that I think is based in Japan, but who knows?

30:50.964 --> 30:55.567
I mean, it's at this stage, you know, impossible to understand.

30:55.607 --> 31:01.411
So there's been a little freak out of silence on the internet since this video was released.

31:02.091 --> 31:19.361
which basically indicated that the daughter of Sasha Latapova had been a longtime influencer of, let's say, ill repute on the internet before the pandemic, and in fact was amplified by none other than Alex Jones in 2019.

31:19.421 --> 31:23.484
And it becomes more and more of a twisted narrative when you realize

31:24.224 --> 31:42.240
the extent to which Sasha Latapova has been involved in crafting the dissident narrative when she appeared in front of Craig Pardecoper for the Bad Batches, when she appeared to take over the narrative of Catherine Watt about the legal aspects of things and distilled it down to the DOD as killing Americans.

31:45.151 --> 32:01.157
And it becomes very, very curious that all of these people in this network that we're looking at have made recent appearances on Alex Jones in the last three or four years, that Alex Jones has returned to Twitter, the, what are we calling this?

32:01.478 --> 32:14.583
Main street town hall, whatever, and is now being lauded as kind of a guy who can see around corners by people like Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone, who now say that they've been following him for years.

32:18.905 --> 32:26.209
And so it becomes very frightening when we look back and we see that her daughter was busy with really disturbing videos.

32:27.289 --> 32:32.952
Somebody making disturbing videos of her already several years before the pandemic.

32:33.012 --> 32:38.495
Almost like they are testing the internet with podcasts and with influencers.

32:38.975 --> 32:40.556
Here she is pretending to OD.

32:41.776 --> 32:51.787
Um, which is not really something that, um, I would say a particularly great parent would allow to exist, be created, nevermind still be on the internet today.

32:51.807 --> 33:03.219
Um, so it's a very, very disturbing place we're in because again, this is a girl who, if you just pause this here, um, we are talking about what, who these people.

33:04.497 --> 33:10.639
Milo, Laura Loomer, I don't know who Briggs is, look at his face, Copper Cab.

33:10.719 --> 33:15.521
So this is a network of people orchestrated and funded.

33:15.541 --> 33:18.923
I don't see Mark Kulak in that picture.

33:18.943 --> 33:24.445
I don't see Jonathan Cooley in that picture, but I do see the daughter of Sasha Latupova.

33:25.405 --> 33:31.828
And if you listen to this video in particular, you hear things that I think are beyond reproach.

33:32.908 --> 33:43.154
You hear things about her when she's pointing the gun at the screen, that she says things like, oh, I'm going to the gay parade, you know, just in case, this is how you do it.

33:44.014 --> 33:50.918
And you can see her later shooting guns and saying things like, this is for you, Hitler, this is for you, Trump.

33:52.178 --> 33:53.299
And that's very odd.

33:53.379 --> 34:00.846
She's also talking in the beginning of the video, which I find the creepiest, about recruiting people to do bad things in America.

34:00.946 --> 34:03.888
Particularly, I think she says Discord or something like that.

34:04.408 --> 34:13.016
Which is odd because that may be where this kid from Bethel Park, just down the street from me, was actually recruited on Discord.

34:13.336 --> 34:15.818
Although they say he had no social media presence at all.

34:16.979 --> 34:19.421
If he was on Discord, it wouldn't be on his phone, you see?

34:21.417 --> 34:38.764
So we're in a very interesting place when this is, these are the words of Sasha Latupova's daughter sometime during the pandemic because, and it's really likely that Sasha was filming this video because there's at least one photograph of Sasha and her daughter in this outfit with these guns, it looks like.

34:39.504 --> 34:41.505
Certainly at this place, it seems to be.

34:41.585 --> 34:49.268
So let's just play one minute of this so that we recall why we did the show two days ago and why it might be useful for you to see it if you haven't.

34:53.317 --> 34:55.039
It's federal agent Clyde Cohen here.

34:55.119 --> 34:56.501
Now, I know I'm not in uniform right now.

34:56.521 --> 34:57.862
That's because I'm going undercover.

34:57.982 --> 35:02.967
In light of all the recent false flag shootings, you might be wondering, how do I get on in on the action, you know?

35:03.068 --> 35:06.051
What do I gotta do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

35:08.575 --> 35:10.416
I might get in on that action.

35:10.876 --> 35:20.419
Lucky for you, citizen of the United States, and Biden's Build Back Better bill, because he loves you so much, absconded in the 10,000 pages federal false flag subsidization program.

35:20.519 --> 35:24.260
For example, if you're thinking, you know what, maybe I don't have the nerve to do something crazy.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.561
We'll give you all the SSRIs and fluoride you need.

35:26.581 --> 35:28.982
You're thinking, where do I get the money for these fancy guns?

35:29.182 --> 35:30.162
Where do you think these like

35:30.462 --> 35:32.784
So this person, this persona, has been in development for years.

35:45.356 --> 35:49.017
Her position on the internet has been in development for years.

35:49.337 --> 35:51.298
And her mom is Sasha Latapova.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.499
Now, why is this important?

35:52.519 --> 36:10.005
Well, because unlike myself, who got seven minutes to spit out as much as he could, and then Robert Malone took 40 more minutes, and Meryl Nass took 10 more minutes, and Jessica Rose took 10 more minutes, and then a very confused Tess Laurie took five minutes.

36:12.230 --> 36:28.005
Sasha Latupova in 2023, remember the mom of Soph, who was featured on Alex Jones two or three times in 2019 as our American hero kid, was featured by Children's Health Defense no less than three times in 2023.

36:29.686 --> 36:35.792
Once with meddler and longtime, I believe, deep state liar, Meryl Nass.

36:37.150 --> 36:47.373
And then with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was gonna give me an hour on his podcast until he saw the slide deck, and then they decided that they had to bring other people on board.

36:48.073 --> 37:05.138
But Sasha Latupova needed two hours in 2023 to make sure that her message and her role as an American thought leader, which was later promoted on Epoch Times by a little podcast with the American thought leaders in the corner here,

37:06.363 --> 37:18.361
So in 2023, there was a pretty big plug for this woman to become some kind of patriot on the pseudo neoconservative side of the Kennedy thing.

37:21.403 --> 37:27.929
And the same people that are promoting Kennedy, like Brett Weinstein, were also on Alex Jones a couple weeks ago.

37:28.349 --> 37:31.111
Robert Malone, also on Alex Jones a couple weeks ago.

37:32.412 --> 37:36.035
Peter McCullough, and all of these people are doing the circuit.

37:36.216 --> 37:39.378
David Martin was recently on Alex Jones.

37:39.438 --> 37:45.964
David Martin was just covered on the Jimmy Dore by Mark Kulak last night.

37:48.154 --> 37:52.756
And so you can see this network of human beings being promoted and promoting each other.

37:53.456 --> 38:09.502
And then you can see in concert their amplification on foreign media, the amplification of these personas that are created to create the illusion of consensus that something's going wrong in America, that Americans have lost it.

38:09.542 --> 38:12.263
And all around the world, that's the message that's being sent.

38:16.089 --> 38:26.038
And that's why I really despise Sky News and the way that they do it, because they're not worried about their ally, America, being undermined from within.

38:26.078 --> 38:32.504
The UK is not worried about their ally, America, being undermined from within.

38:32.604 --> 38:34.686
Something is going just fine, apparently.

38:35.086 --> 38:38.549
And the only thing's wrong is that these lefties are losing it or something like this.

38:39.730 --> 38:47.398
The real message, the real effect is the idea of America is being destroyed around the world using this concert of liars.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.564
I was interviewed on May 18th by this person named Gabe Mason.

38:55.346 --> 39:00.491
And I was emailed yesterday that he's sorry, decided he's not going to go forward with his new project.

39:00.531 --> 39:02.713
He's not going to publish that video after all.

39:03.550 --> 39:10.496
I guess he's pretending that he didn't see that I already published that video and commented on it.

39:12.258 --> 39:13.319
It's extraordinary, right?

39:13.359 --> 39:21.366
Because I was also, right after the red pill, I was interviewed by Dr. Lee Merritt on June 27th.

39:21.426 --> 39:24.989
It's now July 17th and there's still no release of the video.

39:26.390 --> 39:30.314
Now she could be a good guy and the people that release her videos are not, I don't know.

39:32.079 --> 39:40.122
But I realized in looking into her after the video, because I don't have, it's the only one I never made a recording of, something got screwed up here.

39:40.182 --> 39:46.065
So I've been asking for the raw footage from her, but I haven't been offered a link or anything that way yet.

39:46.665 --> 39:53.808
She said a week ago or more that she was editing the video and she loved it and she was taking notes, but I still haven't seen it.

39:54.605 --> 39:56.205
I still haven't been given a link of it.

39:56.905 --> 40:12.569
And I noticed in looking into her, it's hard to find where her podcast is, but it isn't hard to find that she was promoted as a COVID misinformation doctor by NPR, which is, you could see that as a promotion, non-promotion.

40:14.689 --> 40:24.191
I mean, it seems like they're telling you that that's misinformation, but they're telling millions of people her name, telling millions of people where to find her and who's promoting her.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.731
that what right wing media is promoting her.

40:28.771 --> 40:32.354
They named all of it, Blaze News or Daily Wire or whatever.

40:32.434 --> 40:47.764
How am I supposed to see it when people interview me on May 18th because they're supposed to be trying to do a brand new project and they've got 90 videos on YouTube and now they've decided they're just not going to release the video anymore.

40:49.468 --> 40:52.891
How am I supposed to see it when somebody's really excited to interview me?

40:53.732 --> 40:56.474
And I don't really say a lot of ums and ahs.

40:57.575 --> 41:00.137
There's not a lot of pausing in the way that I talk.

41:00.537 --> 41:02.459
And so I don't know what editing needs to be done.

41:02.499 --> 41:12.107
Maybe you gotta paste on a beginning and an ending, but I think from June 27th to July 17th is enough if you make your primary living by podcasting.

41:12.127 --> 41:12.908
I don't understand.

41:15.805 --> 41:22.328
I want to be optimistic here, but I'm not very optimistic because we didn't talk about infectious clones in that interview.

41:22.348 --> 41:29.011
We didn't talk about my red pill conference speech or presentation in that interview at all.

41:29.131 --> 41:30.792
We talked about all kinds of other things.

41:33.615 --> 41:36.959
And so I'm very frustrated because this has happened many times before.

41:37.039 --> 41:53.158
Jessica Hock had hooked me up with a bunch of people from Panda after I'd already left Panda because Panda felt yucky to me when Mary the virologist and Jennifer the virologist, Jennifer the virologist was recently on Steve Kirsch's VSRF show.

41:54.924 --> 41:58.625
I had left Panda in a couple of weeks after the third time I presented to them.

41:59.005 --> 42:17.712
But the crazy thing is, is that Jessica Hockett tried to bring me back to Panda, tried to get me to log into the Slack again, and tried to get me to write something with these two guys that eventually wrote one of the worst virology reviews ever made, and claimed that they cited me in it.

42:19.992 --> 42:20.733
Stop lying!

42:23.578 --> 42:40.662
We have V. John Health, who promoted Robert Malone several times, who promotes Gerd van den Bosch like every week, and has had Kevin McCairn, Charles Rixey, and Christine Grace on as experts about amyloid and the lipid nanoparticle and lab leak.

42:41.202 --> 42:45.243
And it's just a joke that they tried to promote me, but not really.

42:45.283 --> 42:48.724
They're promoting this ridiculous Joe Lee

42:49.972 --> 42:51.813
I can explain everything hypothesis.

42:51.853 --> 42:58.315
He's just like, it's just like Marc Giraudeau, but with a different sales pitch and a different solution.

42:58.395 --> 43:08.258
He thinks it's some kind of chaining up of antibodies and antigens and Marc Giraudeau thinks it's bolus and injecting wrong.

43:13.419 --> 43:14.720
Room temperature coffee, great.

43:16.246 --> 43:39.152
I don't know, you might be surprised or not surprised that very recently the guy who said that the ACE2 affinity in SARS-CoV-2 was orders of magnitude higher than the ferret in early 2020 and has testified many, many times about how this has to be a lab leak because my modeling data shows that the ACE2 affinity is way beyond normal.

43:45.270 --> 44:01.907
And so I think it's really significant that although I am listed in this book on the acknowledgements page as being one of the guys that this was really necessary,

44:03.517 --> 44:06.319
Um, really, really necessary, right?

44:06.679 --> 44:07.999
Jonathan Cooey, right there.

44:08.079 --> 44:08.780
There's my name.

44:09.260 --> 44:30.091
This book would not have been possible without the expertise and invaluable insights provided by Jonathan Cooey, Gavin DeBecker, his head of security, Merrill Nass, Francis Boyle, Paul Thacker, Brett Weinstein, Lee Smith, John Jekielek.

44:30.151 --> 44:30.711
Who's that?

44:30.791 --> 44:32.692
That's frickin' Epoch Times.

44:34.306 --> 44:36.267
Ellen Dewar, I've never met her.

44:36.367 --> 44:37.827
Derek Harvey, never met him.

44:37.947 --> 44:48.871
Stephen Quay, oh yeah, the guy from Australia who just showed that the, you know, was just on Vajon Health and demonstrated very early on that the Ace Two had crazy affinity.

44:49.831 --> 44:53.075
So then we go Andrew Huff, oh wow, that's great.

44:53.816 --> 44:57.880
Jeffrey Sachs, oh that's the guy who speaks more at the Vatican than anybody else.

44:58.961 --> 45:04.888
Ah, Richard Ebright, the guy who said in the end of 2020 in November that we would kill 250,000 college students if we went back

45:07.651 --> 45:13.653
without some kind of controls or mandates on how we do things at colleges.

45:14.134 --> 45:17.315
And Annie Jacobson, I think she might be okay.

45:17.355 --> 45:22.637
Hal Gold, Alex Yoska, and Stephan Kinzer.

45:22.697 --> 45:30.220
Now, as far as I know, none of these people in this list, except for me, worked on the book on a daily basis.

45:31.758 --> 45:36.921
Unless there was another group of people working on the book on a daily basis besides the one that I was a part of.

45:37.502 --> 45:38.062
None of them.

45:38.102 --> 45:39.203
They were all readers.

45:39.883 --> 45:43.766
They all got, you know, got asked things or they're quoted in it.

45:45.327 --> 45:47.068
But they weren't working on it every day.

45:47.108 --> 45:50.850
They didn't have access to the document for many, many months or something like that.

45:50.890 --> 45:52.571
They were given access at some point.

45:52.591 --> 45:53.832
They were quoted at some point.

45:54.232 --> 45:56.194
They were asked to read the part that they're in.

45:56.634 --> 46:00.977
The only person on this list, the only one, is me.

46:02.432 --> 46:03.193
Is that a big deal?

46:03.333 --> 46:07.856
No, I don't think so because Bobby doesn't think I'm anybody and no one's talking to me anymore.

46:07.956 --> 46:09.877
So I guess it's not that big a deal.

46:09.937 --> 46:13.139
I just want you to understand why I think it's a big deal.

46:13.199 --> 46:18.803
Why it feels like to me, I've actually seen the alien that everybody else says they're seeing.

46:19.503 --> 46:21.665
That's why I think it's really important I was over here.

46:22.830 --> 46:30.793
So I think it's really important to see this video and to understand that even then, in this video, I didn't understand that Robert Malone was working against us.

46:30.853 --> 46:34.915
I didn't understand that Meryl Nass was working against us or Jessica Rose.

46:35.015 --> 46:36.255
I thought this was flattery.

46:36.796 --> 46:45.059
I thought this meant that my hypothesis was so important that Bobby wanted all of these people to comment on it.

46:47.260 --> 46:52.482
And even after this video occurred, I still didn't see what they did to me.

46:53.484 --> 46:56.446
I was frustrated, but not for the reasons that made sense.

46:57.386 --> 47:13.295
And now here we are in 2024, and Robert Malone is giving us the skinny on the avian flu, and Children's Health Defense, who publishes his book, Sky Horse Publishing is gonna publish his Psy War book that's coming out in September.

47:14.936 --> 47:17.818
Children's Health Defense and Brownstone Institute

47:19.019 --> 47:26.226
are writing articles about about gain of function in avian flu and about how gain of function is ultimately the danger.

47:27.308 --> 47:28.349
So the avian flu

47:30.060 --> 47:41.943
narrative in the dissident circles are being buttressed on one side by a reasonable Robert Malone and on the other side by a little bit of a hysterical Brownstone Institute and CHD.

47:42.423 --> 47:53.605
And that's pretty extraordinary because CHD let me go because I was interfering with their ability to interact with their partners, I presume to be the authors of the books like Robert Malone.

47:54.878 --> 48:11.404
And now the Brownstone Institute and Robert Malone continue to bookend the narrative by talking about and telling us what we saw and what happened and where we should find our information on Twitter about Donald Trump's attempted assassination.

48:12.324 --> 48:18.166
Robert Malone specifically says here, then put your big boy girl pants on and get ready to act.

48:18.246 --> 48:21.807
I cannot predict what is about to happen, but it's not gonna be a gentlemanly disagreement.

48:22.267 --> 48:23.388
They want civil war.

48:24.520 --> 48:34.328
And the platform they want us to use to find out when to start the civil war is Elon Musk's X, because this is the platform, because of this platform, we know what we know.

48:38.451 --> 48:47.459
And so I think it's really important to see that what Edward Bernays talked about is now visible if you just pause the program.

48:48.604 --> 49:09.297
and see that podcasts and groups of liars are being used to manipulate society, manipulate opinions, manipulate the questions that we ask, to manipulate people into believing that they are actually being heard and that their concerns are being taken forward by other leaders.

49:10.298 --> 49:16.202
When in reality, they did to Byron Bridle exactly what Bobby did to me with that book.

49:17.577 --> 49:32.767
And that the other side of the coin is that people like Twiv are doing it to lots of people in academia and doing it to lots of people on the other side of this narrative that never really found their way to a dissident position.

49:33.467 --> 49:35.469
with regard to the pandemic and what happened.

49:35.509 --> 49:41.355
They still think that it was just a bunch of bad decisions put in place and put in motion by Trump.

49:41.395 --> 49:43.917
And that's a simple enough explanation for them.

49:44.298 --> 49:50.223
And the dark web is now recruiting and using other people to talk about Mike Yeadon and everything else.

49:50.704 --> 49:58.031
And these people are all part of the same mechanism that is manipulating our opinions, manipulating what questions we ask.

50:02.950 --> 50:14.874
manipulating what questions our children ask as they look at their phone and see an illusion of consensus that has nothing to do with what their parents think, nothing to do with what their grandparents think.

50:17.634 --> 50:29.438
And the way that they've done this is with this incredible network of people that get together and ask questions and agree that these questions are the right questions to ask.

50:30.492 --> 50:31.832
and they get together on others.

50:32.012 --> 50:45.035
And they, you know, it doesn't matter what stage you go to, the UK, Australia, or America, the Joe Rogan podcast, or any of the people underneath him.

50:45.835 --> 50:47.895
It's just one pyramid of liars.

50:51.796 --> 50:57.437
And that pyramid is most aptly visible in my experiences on Twitter.

50:59.924 --> 51:02.867
most aptly visible with my experiences on Twitter.

51:02.907 --> 51:04.709
That's my testimony here.

51:06.170 --> 51:13.858
And so I really find it compelling if you really just inspect what's going on here.

51:13.898 --> 51:23.947
When you see that Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan, two people that should never be, never have been together in this narrative, were recently promoted in March.

51:24.788 --> 51:35.935
on the LifeSite News as being experts in prions, and he presented in Australia, or at least on Zoom to Australia.

51:36.395 --> 51:43.039
And then Kevin McKernan is also promoted, and his video is promoted in the same article.

51:45.816 --> 51:48.618
And so they might not be able to show this everywhere.

51:49.058 --> 51:58.023
Kevin McCarran has no chance of being an expert in America because it will immediately burn him and burn them.

51:58.163 --> 52:02.706
So he can be an expert in Australia because again, they see a different stage.

52:05.461 --> 52:08.864
And LifeSite News, that's already a place where only we go.

52:09.665 --> 52:17.452
And so putting them together in this article brings together two of these liars, these narrative curators from 2020.

52:17.532 --> 52:25.980
Two people that were already podcasting daily with other podcasters in February of 2020.

52:26.040 --> 52:26.460
Think about this.

52:28.885 --> 52:36.768
Think about how implausible it is that this guy up here was the one who said that Andy Kaufman had to be opposed.

52:36.808 --> 52:50.173
This guy up here said amyloid and prion disease is being caused by the spike protein, which is a gain of function incapacitating agent in 2020, and was sure of it, that a billion people could die.

52:51.654 --> 52:56.816
And this guy over here was sure that it's not really a novel virus, it just is, but the PCR works great.

52:58.516 --> 53:05.219
And I'm even using PCR to test the weed, because I'm afraid that the government's going to think that old people are getting sick from the weed.

53:05.279 --> 53:07.280
And so I got to already have this stuff going.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.342
So that's why I'm sequencing stuff in the weed.

53:12.223 --> 53:12.503
That was 2020.

53:12.963 --> 53:18.286
Now in 2024, they're together in a LifeSite article as experts on prions.

53:19.226 --> 53:21.087
And it's extraordinary.

53:21.147 --> 53:23.028
Now we have Kevin McKernan.

53:24.446 --> 53:44.371
the the human genome project long time deep state operative working for the government since his dad did probably and Charles Rixey one of the meddlers in my personal story that actually showed up at my freaking house with a woman and a toddler

53:46.181 --> 53:56.734
stayed overnight, did a stream with me that later, supposedly, Robert Malone sat Senator Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy down and said, you got to watch this stream.

53:57.155 --> 54:02.281
And as a result of that, Robert F. Kennedy hired me and Charles Rixey to work on this red book.

54:03.607 --> 54:27.826
Now, just recently on the 14th and the 11th of July, it came to my attention because of Wolfgang that here's Kevin McKernan retweeting Charles Rixey talking about pandemic insurance and mentioning Nick from Panda and talking about metabiotic.

54:27.846 --> 54:29.247
Now, what I see here,

54:30.379 --> 54:40.308
Is Kevin McKernan basically indirectly saying that Metobiota and the front man of that, Nathan Wolfe, are legitimate virologists?

54:40.629 --> 54:48.256
They're also saying that Peter Daszak is a legitimate virologist because Hecal Health Alliance was doing things that was legitimate.

54:50.697 --> 55:00.000
And so Peter Daszak and Nathan Wolf are two central masterminds in the calamity that has occurred.

55:00.160 --> 55:08.763
And Charles Rixey, my personal little clown show meddler that usually is coordinating and sometimes even apparently staying in Japan.

55:09.323 --> 55:20.227
I don't know if he took his wife or his woman and his daughter there, but his staying in Japan with Kevin McCairn, a guy who I streamed with earliest of early of early, five weekends in a row.

55:21.877 --> 55:29.163
with another guy by the name of Paul Cottrell, who's still attached to the meddler of all meddlers, George Webb, today.

55:30.284 --> 55:33.126
These two guys now are tweeting each other as if, yeah, it's cool.

55:34.187 --> 55:35.028
It's totally cool.

55:35.128 --> 55:36.949
I agree totally on what you're talking about.

55:36.989 --> 55:45.276
It's the pandemic insurance game for real viruses, and Metalbiota was working on real viruses, and EcoHealth Alliances was working on real viruses.

55:45.756 --> 55:46.557
Stop lying!

55:48.218 --> 55:49.559
Stop lying!

55:53.817 --> 55:55.338
How do you explain this picture?

55:56.379 --> 55:58.500
Is it really just because I'm such a creep?

56:00.122 --> 56:03.824
Or is it because none of these people are legitimate actors?

56:03.904 --> 56:07.267
They are all participants in the narrative curation.

56:08.388 --> 56:14.732
They are all part of this, I hate the term deep state, but it's the only one that is broad enough.

56:14.832 --> 56:20.877
It is part of this intelligence operation, this military operation, whatever the hell this national security operation is.

56:22.153 --> 56:28.679
It is coordinated across five eyes countries with the idea of control demolishing the idea of America.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.683
Ahmed Malik is in on this.

56:33.063 --> 56:37.347
That's why he's so late to the party that he didn't do anything in 2020 or 2021 or 2022.

56:37.447 --> 56:38.328
And it might've mattered.

56:42.807 --> 56:49.453
Philip Buchholz is a guy who did testing very early on and then said that, well, the DNA contamination isn't that bad.

56:49.493 --> 56:51.895
I'd still give it to my parents, just not my daughter.

56:52.876 --> 57:02.726
And collaborated very hard with Kevin McKernan on the sequencing of the transfections, which we still call vaccines.

57:03.752 --> 57:13.118
Matthew Crawford claims over and over in his Bitcoin chat group that he tried to help me start a business, tried to help me write a book, and was doing everything for my family.

57:14.019 --> 57:14.799
Stop lying!

57:16.340 --> 57:26.307
He wanted me to start a business where people with Bitcoin could buy shares in collectibles that would be stored in airport lockers for shit's sake.

57:28.001 --> 57:36.466
Jessica Hockett befriended me and got me bamboozled by a bunch of people in, in, in Panda that wrote the worst virology thing ever.

57:36.506 --> 57:38.527
And then when I called them out on it, they blocked me.

57:38.547 --> 57:39.307
They didn't call.

57:40.268 --> 57:42.989
She didn't send me one of her charming voice messages anymore.

57:43.029 --> 57:43.870
She just blocked me.

57:46.209 --> 57:49.971
George Webb, the ultimate meddler, the guy with Paul Cuttrell.

57:50.371 --> 58:05.799
There's little Christine Grace, the lady that sent two emails to my employer saying that I was disparaging her when all I did was say that she went on Vajon Health and gave the shittiest presentation I've ever seen with the shittiest slide deck ever used.

58:07.500 --> 58:11.182
And she did it in coordination with Kevin McCarran and Charles Rixey.

58:12.645 --> 58:21.551
I see Joe Lee here, the guy with the big idea about spikes and antibodies making big chains that are resulting in autism.

58:22.291 --> 58:26.094
I see Simon Godek here who just blocked me for no reason.

58:26.154 --> 58:27.475
I just invited him to talk.

58:28.736 --> 58:31.377
I see Robert Malone's blocked me and unblocked me several times.

58:31.838 --> 58:37.962
Jessica Rose, the one that pointed out that there was no VAERS signal before the pandemic, but now there's a great big VAERS signal.

58:38.905 --> 58:46.328
and then made a living on that one story for four years straight while she was surfing on three continents.

58:46.608 --> 59:00.455
There's Adam Gardner, the guy that was selling ivermectin before it would have even seemed logical for somebody with his sketchy background to be selling ivermectin, and now he's still involved with the former feds and still meddling.

59:01.275 --> 59:17.221
This guy over here, Robin Martinati, is the guy who kept the lid on Mike Yeadon for like two years on Telegram and was like the moderator and curator of Mike Yeadon's Telegram and basically was a controller of him.

59:18.282 --> 59:23.984
That's why they split off and Mike Yeadon made his own Telegram thing because that dude flipped out on me one day.

59:27.383 --> 59:42.245
The entire story is here, all the way back to Yuri Dagan, who's one of the dudes who's in Drastic, who actually got to interview on Bret Weinstein's podcast in 2020 about the possibility of a lab leak before I even knew who Bret Weinstein was.

59:50.649 --> 59:55.958
And now we see that Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey are exactly the same.

59:56.559 --> 01:00:00.605
They believe in exactly the same things, that Peter Daszak is a wizard.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:17.164
that Metobiota was a crazy, impressive company doing crazy, impressive biology, and the combination of these two existing is sufficient evidence to say for sure that this was a laboratory-created virus that's spinning around the world.

01:00:17.324 --> 01:00:18.345
That's the agreement.

01:00:18.965 --> 01:00:26.492
Even if Kevin McKernan doesn't say it, just by retweeting him and blocking me, that's where we are.

01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:35.594
And so once you see it, once the matrix stops, once you stop the program and realize that when you look around, all these people are working together and they have been.

01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:41.299
And the reason why it's become so obvious right now at this point in time is basically the red pill.

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:49.166
Because it was that weekend that suddenly Steve Kirsch had to have Andy Kaufman on.

01:00:52.129 --> 01:00:53.130
It was that weekend.

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:58.964
that all of this stuff started to happen, that they all lost their minds.

01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:10.318
It was that month that the ruse of Engler and Neal and Hudson and Hockett was exposed.

01:01:10.978 --> 01:01:17.863
When I was also simultaneously shelling all of these anonymous accounts, we just don't need to listen to them.

01:01:18.363 --> 01:01:24.587
There's no reason to listen to anybody who isn't putting their own life and liberty on the line.

01:01:26.226 --> 01:01:31.608
And you have to realize that these anonymous accounts are necessarily part of this theater.

01:01:31.628 --> 01:01:34.929
They are weaponized against us to create the illusion of consensus.

01:01:35.009 --> 01:01:42.271
If one of these meddlers tweets and three other anonymous accounts go, go get them, then the illusion of consensus is right there.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:54.384
And that's how we've all been fooled inside of these little groups, inside of these threads, in these endless message chains.

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:58.806
The weaponized piles of money convinced us what to argue about, what questions to ask.

01:01:58.926 --> 01:02:02.407
And as a result, we accepted the presuppositions of those questions.

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:06.429
And we are still being manipulated by that theater of lies today.

01:02:10.065 --> 01:02:10.666
you

01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:25.718
So what was mitobiota really?

01:02:25.798 --> 01:02:27.599
What can we do to understand this?

01:02:27.639 --> 01:02:28.639
I think we gotta go back.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:29.939
I always think we gotta go back.

01:02:30.019 --> 01:02:33.661
So it's always handy if the PBS NewsHour did a show.

01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:36.542
So let's see what the PBS NewsHour did.

01:02:36.682 --> 01:02:41.724
Finally tonight, the work of a scientist who spends his days tracking killer diseases.

01:02:44.945 --> 01:02:47.966
A nondescript office building in downtown San Francisco

01:02:48.359 --> 01:02:53.221
may seem like an unlikely headquarters for one of the world's most prominent virus hunters.

01:02:53.881 --> 01:03:04.386
But it's where Stanford University biologist Nathan Wolfe has set up his war room to monitor and study new and potentially deadly viruses emerging around the globe.

01:03:05.006 --> 01:03:08.707
It looks like we're going to release an Ebola finding on Monday.

01:03:08.867 --> 01:03:14.750
The 41-year-old Wolfe is the founder and director of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.531
The mission sounds simple, but it's not.

01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:18.566
Who was that?

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.107
Who was that?

01:03:32.159 --> 01:03:38.023
It's a mix of high-tech detective work and old-fashioned, on-the-ground epidemiology research.

01:03:38.563 --> 01:03:44.047
And it's the subject of his new book, The Viral Storm, The Dawn of a New Pandemic Age.

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:46.449
I sat down with Wolf in his office.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:51.232
What we're looking at is this interface between human and animal populations.

01:03:51.712 --> 01:03:59.378
And we're trying to basically catch the really early stages of these pandemics, the moment at which, frankly, the pandemic is born or an epidemic is born.

01:03:59.838 --> 01:04:06.726
And I always joke that- So how is it possible already with this five minutes, three minutes, one minute of video?

01:04:07.787 --> 01:04:09.189
I don't believe a word he's saying.

01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:10.670
I think he's completely fake.

01:04:13.013 --> 01:04:18.279
But Charles Rixey thinks that this is a real virologist and probably responsible for it.

01:04:20.916 --> 01:04:22.537
Do you see the ridiculousness of it?

01:04:22.597 --> 01:04:29.220
Now go watch Peter Daszak on 60 Minutes from 2003 or whenever it was.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.942
And then watch Peter Daszak when he's on 60 Minutes a few years later again.

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:44.968
And tell me you don't see the same ridiculous joke where the illusion, where the illusion of pandemic potential is being created.

01:04:46.476 --> 01:04:56.326
Does it surprise you that it's being created on PBS NewsHour years before the pandemic by somebody who is intimately connected with Vice President Biden?

01:04:59.348 --> 01:04:59.809
It shouldn't.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:08.698
What should surprise you is the insistence on the idea that this is a legitimate, this is legitimate evidence that COVID is real.

01:05:09.602 --> 01:05:22.131
that this guy is legitimate evidence that COVID is real is what exposes Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey and that whole crew of people as being full of shit.

01:05:23.232 --> 01:05:28.516
And all you gotta do is stop the program and see it for what it is because that is the moment we're at.

01:05:29.389 --> 01:05:33.311
It is a moment where the contradiction is too great.

01:05:34.071 --> 01:05:38.233
And let me make sure that I am reminding you again of what I'm talking about.

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:40.995
I am talking about this particular slide right here.

01:05:42.795 --> 01:05:45.317
Where Charles Rixey on July 11th.

01:05:46.687 --> 01:05:48.269
has tweeted directed evolution.

01:05:48.329 --> 01:06:03.264
Now an 18 month old project of Pfizer doing gain of function research for money is just like EcoHealth Alliance was doing the predict program included EHA and metal biota funded by a Biden who sold pandemic insurance.

01:06:03.304 --> 01:06:04.705
And then here's him agreeing with him.

01:06:04.745 --> 01:06:04.825
Yeah.

01:06:04.845 --> 01:06:10.411
And the pandemic insurance game is where Nick Hudson was from and why he's crying about it now.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:24.608
That's extraordinary, ladies and gentlemen, because let's watch Middle Biota's president or founder on PBS NewsHour.

01:06:24.788 --> 01:06:25.289
He's not real.

01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:30.072
Finally tonight, the work of a scientist who spends his days tracking killer diseases.

01:06:33.295 --> 01:06:41.561
A nondescript office building in downtown San Francisco may seem like an unlikely headquarters for one of the world's most prominent virus hunters.

01:06:42.227 --> 01:06:52.712
But it's where Stanford University biologist Nathan Wolfe has set up his war room to monitor and study new and potentially deadly viruses emerging around the globe.

01:06:53.332 --> 01:06:57.053
It looks like we're gonna release an Ebola finding on Monday.

01:06:57.193 --> 01:07:03.076
The 41-year-old Wolfe is the founder and director of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative.

01:07:03.596 --> 01:07:05.917
The mission sounds simple, but it's not.

01:07:06.477 --> 01:07:08.278
So what we're looking for here.

01:07:08.398 --> 01:07:10.039
Potentially deadly viruses

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.050
Watch that lady right there.

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.590
Can you see my mouse?

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:21.071
Watch this lady.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:22.291
See that lady right there?

01:07:23.032 --> 01:07:23.372
Watch.

01:07:23.392 --> 01:07:26.092
They're gonna show her again.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:30.514
It looks like we're gonna release an Ebola finding on Monday.

01:07:30.654 --> 01:07:36.535
The 41-year-old wolf is the founder and director of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative.

01:07:37.055 --> 01:07:39.376
The mission sounds simple, but it's not.

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:43.157
Detect pandemics and stop them before they spread.

01:07:43.843 --> 01:07:55.986
How Wolf and his team do that is a mix of high-tech detective work and old-fashioned... Wolf and his team do that is a mix of high-tech detective work and old-fashioned... See that lady?

01:07:56.066 --> 01:07:57.486
...epidemiology research.

01:07:58.026 --> 01:08:03.527
And it's the subject of his new book, The Viral Storm, the Dawn of a New Pandemic Age.

01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:05.868
I sat down with Wolf in his office.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.694
What we're looking at is this interface between human and animal populations.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:18.921
And we're trying to basically catch the really early stages of these pandemics, the moment at which, frankly, the pandemic is born or an epidemic is born.

01:08:19.301 --> 01:08:27.388
And I always joke that if you go to Ocean Beach here in San Francisco, you'll always see people running up and kissing their dogs.

01:08:27.428 --> 01:08:29.410
And that's a moment of cross-species transmission.

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:32.291
Oh my gosh, what an idiot.

01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:35.952
I only hear Rick Bright's voice when I hear him talking.

01:08:35.992 --> 01:08:40.834
So now they're gonna show bits of the movie Contagion, which is also handy, isn't it?

01:08:40.914 --> 01:08:44.636
The average person touches their face three to five times every waking minute.

01:08:45.056 --> 01:08:48.898
In between, we're touching doorknobs, water fountains, and each other.

01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:56.541
A much more serious but fictional cross-species transmission was the focus of this summer's thriller, Contagion.

01:08:57.219 --> 01:09:00.921
in which millions died from a virus found in pigs and bats.

01:09:01.481 --> 01:09:03.822
Wolf was a technical director on the film.

01:09:04.382 --> 01:09:14.247
In the real world, viruses, the microscopic pathogens that invade and destroy host cells, have been jumping from animals to humans for ages.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:21.370
But with the huge increases in modern air traffic, an outbreak in one country

01:09:22.393 --> 01:09:27.017
Of course he has a biohazard sticker on his Mac.

01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:27.998
Of course he does.

01:09:28.118 --> 01:09:29.560
Look at air traffic network.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.043
They're showing you how it's gonna happen.

01:09:33.363 --> 01:09:38.548
The challenge that we face right now is we're so interconnected that these viruses can spread

01:09:39.329 --> 01:09:39.970
in a day.

01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:41.692
You're absolutely right.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:49.422
Interacting with dogs, I mean it's already, there's lots of evidence out there that people who have pets have far fewer allergies.

01:09:49.882 --> 01:09:56.290
It's just absurd to say that when you kiss your dog it's a cross-species transmission event.

01:09:56.811 --> 01:09:57.291
But again,

01:09:58.032 --> 01:10:04.174
Remember, this is supposed to be a serious virologist, according to Charles Rixey and Kevin McKernan.

01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:06.775
And Kevin McCairn, and all these people.

01:10:07.235 --> 01:10:11.976
Very serious virologists worth funding to the tune of millions of dollars.

01:10:12.116 --> 01:10:14.037
Don't you see how ridiculous it is?

01:10:16.061 --> 01:10:17.662
I hope you can see it around the world.

01:10:17.682 --> 01:10:20.725
You know, they can go from Central Africa, Southeast Asia.

01:10:20.745 --> 01:10:21.726
They can get to Tokyo.

01:10:21.766 --> 01:10:22.867
They can get to New York City.

01:10:23.187 --> 01:10:24.288
That's crystal clear.

01:10:25.269 --> 01:10:37.519
That global interconnectedness was highlighted in recent years with the SARS outbreak in 2003 and more recently with the H1N1 swine flu virus started in Mexico.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.870
it quickly infected millions.

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:50.353
And that swine flu was the one where we watched the video from the Netherlands where they're like, yes, 35,000 or 35 million doses were ordered and he shows the phone.

01:10:52.313 --> 01:10:53.794
It's all the same scam.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:54.694
And then there's AIDS.

01:10:55.294 --> 01:11:01.576
At a 2009 TED talk, Wolf pointed out that millions of lives could potentially have been saved

01:11:02.156 --> 01:11:07.019
if the AIDS virus had been discovered when it first crossed from chimps to humans.

01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:11.341
This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville, Congo.

01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:15.323
At this time, there were thousands of individuals, we think, that were infected with HIV.

01:11:15.924 --> 01:11:22.988
If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point, why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus?

01:11:24.869 --> 01:11:30.972
At his headquarters, Wolf has assembled a team of savvy young computer gurus who comb the Internet.

01:11:31.423 --> 01:11:37.964
using sophisticated algorithms to search for the digital clues that could indicate the outbreak of a disease.

01:11:38.854 --> 01:11:44.315
People, if they're sick, they'll search on a certain kind of symptoms, or at least a number of them will.

01:11:44.615 --> 01:11:54.358
So at every moment, whether people are searching or tweeting or texting, people are increasingly sending off massive amounts of data.

01:11:54.818 --> 01:12:04.740
Is he arguing for the idea that Palantir, for example, might be able to scrape the internet for signals that would indicate early signals of a pending pandemic?

01:12:06.749 --> 01:12:07.850
It sounds like that to me.

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:16.054
It sounds like they're talking about scraping internet data for signals that indicate pandemic potential, which is an extraordinary thing.

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:23.339
It's not really the same as using metagenomic sequencing to look into the background noise, which is what I think they also do.

01:12:24.119 --> 01:12:32.583
So this is another interesting side to put to this, where again, remember Kevin McCurden and Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn and everybody else.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:40.746
I think also Robert Malone and the whole Nine Yards would say that Nathan Wolfe is a legitimate dude who got legitimate money to do legitimate things.

01:12:40.886 --> 01:12:44.208
Give us potential clues into what they're doing, what they're thinking.

01:12:46.394 --> 01:12:52.819
But to really understand what viral threats are lurking out there, Wolf has to get out... Look at how dirty he is.

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:57.042
His shoes are so dirty.

01:12:57.342 --> 01:12:59.143
Look how fake that is.

01:12:59.203 --> 01:13:00.504
Look how fake that is.

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:06.529
That dude needed knee-high boots, but Nathan Wolf didn't need knee-high boots.

01:13:06.569 --> 01:13:07.910
He could go out there in dress shoes.

01:13:10.404 --> 01:13:16.429
But to really understand what viral threats are lurking out there, Wolf has to get out of the office.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.852
Speak French with this guy for a second.

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:21.454
You just pretend like you understand.

01:13:21.474 --> 01:13:21.814
He's...

01:13:30.856 --> 01:13:33.437
This is the national security operation right here.

01:13:33.838 --> 01:13:47.505
It was started years ago with performances by people like Nathan Wolf that went on TED Talks, that went in front of the UN, that went in front of lanyard-covered audiences.

01:13:51.487 --> 01:13:59.411
Wolf and his colleagues have been trekking through dense jungles in West Africa and parts of Asia, studying the close interactions between humans

01:13:59.983 --> 01:14:01.684
and the animals they hunt and eat.

01:14:02.345 --> 01:14:12.192
The unhygienic conditions in which the bushmeat, or wild game, is captured, prepared, and eaten allows blood, bodily fluids, and viruses

01:14:12.588 --> 01:14:14.509
to pass between hunter and prey.

01:14:14.989 --> 01:14:21.632
We've been working, say, in parts of Central Africa for over 10, 12 years, just working with these populations year in and year out.

01:14:21.652 --> 01:14:28.535
And we're able to document this sometime, literally to watch these viruses as they're jumping over from animals into human populations.

01:14:28.916 --> 01:14:37.520
We see novel retroviruses, so viruses that are in the same broad family as HIV, moving over into these hunters from animals that they've hunted.

01:14:38.635 --> 01:14:46.999
Wolf's team has collected more than 200,000 blood and tissue samples from animals, hunters and their families in Africa and Asia.

01:14:47.605 --> 01:14:51.647
field labs Wolf describes as excellent catch in the chat.

01:14:52.287 --> 01:15:11.695
It's definitely true that the Defense Intelligence Agency created a 501 c3 called the global viral forecasting Institute, which is what became metabiotic and so you can see it for what it is there the ties to Ukraine and to the Biden family go to this metabiotic and go to this sort of

01:15:12.867 --> 01:15:14.508
construction of a narrative.

01:15:14.588 --> 01:15:19.109
Now, I don't know if they were making molecules over there that they would later detect.

01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:28.752
I don't know if they were making the small protein toxin that they released or whatever the story is and whatever was made over there in Ukraine or not made over there.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:38.716
The illusion that this stuff was happening is what creates the illusion of pandemic potential, but they probably weren't doing anything but renting office space.

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:41.591
That's what you need to see.

01:15:42.352 --> 01:15:52.480
If they brought diplomats over there and pretended to carry suitcases with shit in them, it would just create the illusion of pandemic potential in Ukraine.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.483
Create the illusion of bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

01:15:56.923 --> 01:16:02.288
The illusion of bioweapons, of laboratories is very easy to create and amplify.

01:16:02.328 --> 01:16:04.850
And it seems like to me, that's what they did.

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.820
We never saw any evidence of the labs.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.441
We were told that the Russians went in there because of the labs.

01:16:11.241 --> 01:16:12.822
We were told the labs were there, why?

01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:14.003
Because of metabiota.

01:16:14.083 --> 01:16:23.827
So Nathan Wolf, again, is a guy who apparently is so smart, so brilliant, that he was given this high of a role in the national security state.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:25.308
And I just think- Stop lying!

01:16:25.328 --> 01:16:26.608
I just think that's crazy.

01:16:26.668 --> 01:16:29.409
There's no way in hell that guy is in that role.

01:16:29.429 --> 01:16:30.830
Viral listening posts.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:38.352
Those samples are continuously analyzed by scientists for signs that new pathogens are crossing over to humans.

01:16:39.338 --> 01:17:01.430
A lot of the places that you identify as sort of the petri dishes for future threats are also places with tiny gross national products, places that just getting through the day is a big enough threat, much less worrying about tiny viruses and future threats that are somewhere out there in the forest.

01:17:02.099 --> 01:17:04.060
Look, I think this is a really pivotal point.

01:17:04.201 --> 01:17:05.181
We'll sit with these populations.

01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:08.103
They say, look, yes, we understand animals get sick and die.

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:09.164
We see sick animals.

01:17:09.544 --> 01:17:11.726
We also know that we can acquire some of these illnesses.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:15.228
Our family members have been hunting and butchering all their lives.

01:17:15.849 --> 01:17:19.051
You know, this is our primary source, at least for now, for animal protein.

01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:27.016
As a virologist, I didn't sort of expect that I would come to advocating for focusing on rural poverty and protein alternatives.

01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:28.638
And so this is a really pivotal point.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:29.738
We'll sit with these populations.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.239
They say, look,

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:32.640
Yes, we understand animals get sick and die.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.721
We see sick animals.

01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:36.282
We also know that we can acquire some of these illnesses.

01:17:37.023 --> 01:17:39.784
Our family members have been hunting and butchering all their lives.

01:17:40.385 --> 01:17:43.607
You know, this is our primary source, at least for now, for animal protein.

01:17:43.987 --> 01:17:51.892
As a virologist, I didn't sort of expect that I would... In 2011, he's talking about our primary source of protein being animal protein?

01:17:51.932 --> 01:17:52.272
Wow.

01:17:52.952 --> 01:17:55.314
And that it might not be that way forever?

01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:00.811
Seems like he's read in on a little bit more than virology.

01:18:02.672 --> 01:18:17.697
Seems like the source of the pandemic, you know, pandemic potential being Peter Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance and Nathan Wolf and Metobiota seems based a lot on a PBS NewsHour portrayal of him.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:22.456
rather than the real biology that he engaged in or didn't engage in.

01:18:22.556 --> 01:18:32.339
I find it very, very interesting that Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey are essentially pushing the same bullshit narrative.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.240
It's extraordinary.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:42.262
After four and a half years that these two traitors to America are coming together on Twitter.

01:18:42.863 --> 01:18:44.143
Let me go back because that wasn't over.

01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:51.475
literally to watch these viruses as they're jumping over from animals into human populations.

01:18:51.855 --> 01:19:00.537
We see novel retroviruses, so viruses that are in the same broad family as HIV, moving over into these hunters from animals that they've hunted.

01:19:01.557 --> 01:19:07.758
Wolf's team has collected more than 200,000 blood and tissue samples from animals, hunters.

01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:13.059
He claims to find retroviruses moving from the animals to these people, and I think that's got to be a lie.

01:19:13.099 --> 01:19:14.180
I've not seen the paper.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.180
And their families in Africa and Asia.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.347
Field labs Wolf describes as viral.

01:19:19.367 --> 01:19:23.349
What you do get with those samples, though, are our DNA.

01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:29.191
And so they might have sampled the animals, but I bet you they sampled all the people in these places to listening posts.

01:19:29.851 --> 01:19:36.694
Those samples are continuously analyzed by scientists for signs that new pathogens crossing over to humans.

01:19:37.679 --> 01:19:59.791
A lot of the places that you identify as sort of the petri dishes for future threats are also places with tiny gross national products, places that just getting through the day is a big enough threat, much less worrying about tiny viruses and future threats that are somewhere out there in the forest.

01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:02.422
Look, I think this is a really pivotal point.

01:20:02.562 --> 01:20:03.542
We'll sit with these populations.

01:20:03.562 --> 01:20:06.443
They say, look, yes, we understand animals get sick and die.

01:20:06.483 --> 01:20:07.524
We see sick animals.

01:20:07.884 --> 01:20:10.085
We also know that we can acquire some of these illnesses.

01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:13.586
Our family members have been hunting and butchering all their lives.

01:20:14.187 --> 01:20:17.448
You know, this is our primary source, at least for now, for animal protein.

01:20:17.788 --> 01:20:27.252
As a virologist, I didn't sort of expect that I would come to advocating for focusing on rural poverty and protein alternatives in Central Africa, but that's part of the problem.

01:20:28.413 --> 01:20:48.324
the significance of wolf's work is reflected in the organization supporting it the department of defense the national institutes of health and the school and gates foundations which also fund the news hour school foundation and the gates foundation that also fund the news hour and school foundation also funds

01:20:49.341 --> 01:20:53.824
The VSRF of Steve Kirsch, so now you know.

01:20:54.365 --> 01:20:59.529
Almost every time there's one of these outbreaks, it's a new virus from animals that jump into humans.

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:10.457
What keeps him up at night, and the reason why there's been so much interest in his work, is the threat of a super killer virus that's both easily transmittable and lethal.

01:21:11.017 --> 01:21:13.299
These viruses mutate at an incredible rate.

01:21:13.659 --> 01:21:18.123
So something which is highly transmissible but not very deadly could become very deadly.

01:21:19.304 --> 01:21:35.431
When H1N1, the so-called swine flu, was on its way racing around the world, one of the dangers is that it would get into some pig or some duck or even a person that was simultaneously infected with another strain of flu, for example, something like H5N1.

01:21:36.852 --> 01:21:39.914
and that these viruses would actually sort of mix and match genes.

01:21:40.214 --> 01:21:48.380
If that happened, there was that small probability where we would get a virus that had the capacity to spread effectively and had the capacity to kill.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.862
And that's the thing that obviously we're all afraid of.

01:21:51.822 --> 01:21:55.725
Wolf says too much attention is placed on responses to outbreaks.

01:21:56.351 --> 01:22:00.092
and more funding and research needs to be placed on early detection.

01:22:00.772 --> 01:22:07.534
Pandemic prevention, this is increasingly something that people are recognizing as an issue, but it's gonna take some time for the resource.

01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:12.696
Even the term pandemic prevention makes you accept pandemic potential.

01:22:15.537 --> 01:22:25.240
If I say leprechaun prevention, and you think that leprechaun prevention is something that should be in the phone book, then you accept that leprechauns exist.

01:22:26.129 --> 01:22:31.791
It's incredible how what this was done in 2011 when we were not paying attention like we are now.

01:22:32.351 --> 01:22:39.074
We had no idea that this was the level and the depth that they would go to for all the marbles, how long they would plan it.

01:22:39.114 --> 01:22:40.134
But this is how long.

01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:45.156
That's why Tony Fauci is where he was for as long as he was.

01:22:45.857 --> 01:22:48.818
See it for what it is, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:50.783
This is to catch up.

01:22:51.103 --> 01:22:55.866
We need, you know, basically hundreds of millions of dollars to do this work.

01:22:55.926 --> 01:22:57.586
Really, at the end of the day, billions of dollars.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.167
And I just think it can't be reiterated enough.

01:23:00.628 --> 01:23:04.189
These are not the kind of things that should be cut when it comes time to cutting budgets.

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:09.852
If so, we're just sitting there, bullets are dodging left and right, and we're basically ignoring the shooters.

01:23:10.595 --> 01:23:12.176
The book is The Viral Storm.

01:23:12.216 --> 01:23:13.357
Nathan Wolf, thanks a lot.

01:23:13.937 --> 01:23:14.378
Thank you.

01:23:14.898 --> 01:23:15.458
Thank you.

01:23:15.719 --> 01:23:17.560
Okay, so let's watch the next video.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.643
I think it's from a little bit... I think this is the TED Talk that they just showed there.

01:23:24.305 --> 01:23:29.008
Gremlin outbreak avoidance means not feeding things after midnight and also avoiding water.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:39.239
Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin, and I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer.

01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:40.820
Beloit, Wisconsin?

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.222
Mark, tell me there's something about Beloit, Wisconsin.

01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:46.604
What about Beloit, Wisconsin?

01:23:47.144 --> 01:23:47.905
Holy shit.

01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:49.946
What about Beloit, Wisconsin?

01:23:49.966 --> 01:23:53.589
Did we just, you just covered something about Cory in Beloit, Wisconsin.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:55.410
Now he's, this looks like a recent one.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.253
This looks like around the same time as the book because he doesn't have curly hair.

01:23:59.293 --> 01:24:00.094
There's an earlier,

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.242
Ted Talk where he has curly hair, so I might have gotten these two mixed up.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.029
Oh my gosh, I'm going to play that again.

01:24:07.129 --> 01:24:09.474
He was recently in Beloit, Wisconsin.

01:24:26.095 --> 01:24:33.459
Recently, I visited Beloit, Wisconsin, and I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer, Roy Chapman Andrews.

01:24:34.039 --> 01:24:41.463
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History... That was where the famotidine trial was handled by Robert Malone.

01:24:41.523 --> 01:24:42.744
That's fantastic.

01:24:42.824 --> 01:24:47.006
It's right south of Madison, Wisconsin, where Pierre Cory

01:24:47.866 --> 01:24:48.387
was working.

01:24:48.447 --> 01:24:50.728
It's just an interesting thing that he mentions Beloit.

01:24:51.068 --> 01:24:56.391
Andrew's led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions, like here in the Gobi Desert.

01:24:56.731 --> 01:24:57.832
He was quite a figure.

01:24:58.072 --> 01:25:01.454
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.

01:25:02.671 --> 01:25:07.953
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin, I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.

01:25:08.693 --> 01:25:17.597
And I'm here to tell you, if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED, it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of 1,000 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.

01:25:18.677 --> 01:25:19.518
Don't try that one.

01:25:21.018 --> 01:25:22.899
At the end of the lecture, they asked me... Why?

01:25:24.537 --> 01:25:32.384
Why would Nathan Wolf of Meadowbiota be lecturing a thousand middle school students?

01:25:34.425 --> 01:25:39.830
I mean, that's really a big problem for me.

01:25:40.591 --> 01:25:42.092
Why would that be happening?

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:51.204
because he's such a great virologist, like Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey seem to agree about?

01:25:51.224 --> 01:25:56.228
I asked a number of questions, but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.

01:25:56.288 --> 01:26:01.131
There was a young girl who stood up, and she asked the question, where should we explore?

01:26:01.151 --> 01:26:13.940
I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over, that for the next generation, they're gonna have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore.

01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:16.241
But is that really the case?

01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:20.353
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth?

01:26:21.508 --> 01:26:25.530
sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.

01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:28.991
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Biring.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:33.373
So Biring set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease.

01:26:33.853 --> 01:26:40.075
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.

01:26:40.635 --> 01:26:49.699
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known, bacteria at the time.

01:26:50.719 --> 01:26:53.200
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:27:17.086
He called it the virus Latin for poison and in sort of uncovering viruses By rank really opened this entire new world for us We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information all other forms of life combined and so there's more background DNA and RNA from viruses and

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:22.871
than all the other DNA on earth, which is a pretty bold statement.

01:27:22.931 --> 01:27:26.360
And it means that the background is far from zero.

01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:32.511
like many, many, many orders of magnitude far from zero.

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:36.855
So we're already putting out a picture that's very different.

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:53.990
He's got a picture of bacteriophages here, but he's not being very specific in terms of the idea that bacteriophages have much more proof of existence than some of the RNA viruses and retroviruses that are claimed by the national security state and public health.

01:27:54.170 --> 01:28:07.320
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world, things like the eradication of smallpox, the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer, which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:18.247
And Byron's discovery... So he's arguing for an HPV vaccine, which we already know from the movie Vaxxed 2 is one of the most abhorrent

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:21.351
vaccines on the schedule.

01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:36.402
And it's actually really awful to think that the vaccine is also be given to boys because they might transmit this virus sexually and give their mate uterine cancer, which is just absolutely absurd.

01:28:37.102 --> 01:28:44.648
But here he is in front of a lot of adults telling them that this is the way it is and that there's an illusion of consensus that this is the way it is.

01:28:44.948 --> 01:28:46.369
This was not something that occurred 500 years ago.

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:52.554
It was little over a hundred years ago that BioRank discovered viruses.

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:59.179
So basically, we had automobiles, but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.423
We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world.

01:29:04.944 --> 01:29:15.052
Things like deep sequencing, which allow us to do much more than just sort of skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species, but to look at entire metagenomes.

01:29:15.632 --> 01:29:19.573
the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on, and around us.

01:29:19.994 --> 01:29:20.954
Metagenomes.

01:29:21.014 --> 01:29:27.856
We can just look at everything and then use our computers and my really smart interns to figure out what we're looking at.

01:29:27.936 --> 01:29:35.299
You know, like shred all the newspapers up in the world and then find interesting novels in that big pile of shredded novels.

01:29:35.979 --> 01:29:36.619
and newspapers.

01:29:55.006 --> 01:30:03.971
And just to give you a sense of how this works, imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you, and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:09.034
The first thing that we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information.

01:30:09.674 --> 01:30:13.916
And if we started looking into that genetic information, we'd see a number of usual suspects out there.

01:30:13.956 --> 01:30:21.601
Of course, a lot of human genetic information, but also bacterial and viral information, mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.

01:30:22.401 --> 01:30:34.024
And more than 220 EUA authorized PCR tests were rolled out at the beginning of the pandemic and said to define the pandemic on this background.

01:30:35.304 --> 01:30:37.304
But none of them were ever tested on this background.

01:30:37.324 --> 01:30:43.826
They were tested on a water control and on a positive control in a pure sample.

01:30:44.586 --> 01:30:46.006
Never on this background.

01:30:46.767 --> 01:30:48.327
Never on this background.

01:30:49.761 --> 01:30:55.846
And so the idea that there might be false positives on this background was completely never even a question.

01:30:57.047 --> 01:31:10.237
And the guy that was intimately involved in making sure that question was never asked was Kevin McKernan, who was part of organizing this paper about the primers of the WHO test being wrong.

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:18.124
And none of those people in four and a half years have ever bothered to point out that Nathan Wolf says that the background is pretty loud.

01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:22.941
And these viruses mutate so fast.

01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:29.769
I mean, my goodness, this whole background is changing constantly like a genetic kaleidoscope.

01:31:29.849 --> 01:31:34.854
But, you know, it's pretty simple to roll out a few PCR tests and figure out what's going on.

01:31:37.738 --> 01:31:38.478
Stop lying!

01:31:41.735 --> 01:31:43.896
We'd also see something very, very surprising.

01:31:44.677 --> 01:31:53.363
As we started to look at this information, we would see that about 20% of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before.

01:31:53.763 --> 01:31:56.545
No plant, animal, fungus, virus, or bacteria.

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.627
Basically, we have no clue what this is.

01:32:00.925 --> 01:32:09.999
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter.

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.263
We know it's not anything that we've seen before.

01:32:13.344 --> 01:32:14.205
It's sort of the equivalent.

01:32:14.225 --> 01:32:15.867
I mean, he's like a real thought leader.

01:32:16.983 --> 01:32:23.751
And Charles Rixey and Kevin McKernan agree that he's really a thought leader and probably partially responsible for the pandemic.

01:32:23.912 --> 01:32:27.916
Ultimately, if not intellectually, also biologically responsible.

01:32:28.557 --> 01:32:30.940
That's how extraordinary it is that they...

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:55.051
retweeted each other and and it's it's really the narrative breaking of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information and there's a lot of it if you think 20 percent of genetic information your nose is a lot uh biological dark matter if we looked at your gut up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter in your gut it's even worse

01:32:55.771 --> 01:32:56.812
And who works there?

01:32:57.472 --> 01:33:00.675
Oh, that's that lady who's talking shit on her book.

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:03.316
And she sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in the gut.

01:33:03.777 --> 01:33:10.422
And she's a part of over 200 clinical trials on investigating probiotics.

01:33:10.462 --> 01:33:11.803
But she's all on our team.

01:33:12.383 --> 01:33:13.724
She's definitely on our team.

01:33:13.764 --> 01:33:15.525
That's why she spoke in front of the Senate.

01:33:16.126 --> 01:33:16.626
That's right.

01:33:16.826 --> 01:33:17.647
She's on our team.

01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:20.209
That's why she speaks at CHD conferences.

01:33:20.249 --> 01:33:21.049
She's on our team.

01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.650
That's right.

01:33:22.446 --> 01:33:22.686
Sure.

01:33:23.006 --> 01:33:31.953
And even in the relatively sterile blood, around one to two percent of this information is dark matter, can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything that we've seen before.

01:33:33.634 --> 01:33:35.836
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact, right?

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:45.923
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new, but as they've become more and more accurate, we've determined that this information is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life.

01:33:46.949 --> 01:33:56.180
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy, there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists.

01:33:57.181 --> 01:34:04.129
That buried in this life are signatures, in this genetic information, are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.

01:34:05.185 --> 01:34:08.288
that as we explore these... Okay, now listen very carefully.

01:34:08.348 --> 01:34:23.100
This is the central bullshit of metabiota, the central bullshit of virology, the central bullshit that Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey are now coordinatedly reinforcing on Twitter as of July.

01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:31.206
Listen very carefully because it will never be said better than this Rick Bright wannabe said it in this video.

01:34:31.467 --> 01:34:32.447
Ability that exists.

01:34:33.632 --> 01:34:39.938
Hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life.

01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:47.384
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological... So there's a hypothesis that he's arguing now.

01:34:47.444 --> 01:34:49.026
What is the hypothesis about?

01:34:49.086 --> 01:35:00.476
It's about what this biological dark matter that metabiota has identified in your nose and identified even more of in your gut, what it actually is.

01:35:02.335 --> 01:35:08.419
And of course, his really exciting possibility is that it's as of yet undiscovered life forms.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.062
But of course, what do we think it is here at GigaOM Biological?

01:35:13.122 --> 01:35:20.067
We think it is unadmitted, unidentified exosomal signaling.

01:35:21.068 --> 01:35:24.430
Healthy cells communicating with other healthy cells.

01:35:26.084 --> 01:35:36.390
and healthy cells of fungi communicating with other cells and bacteria, and we don't know.

01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:51.458
But it is far less likely for it to be, as of yet, unidentified, whole phylogeny of life forms, as opposed to being signals generated by the life forms we already know are here.

01:35:53.311 --> 01:36:19.553
And so, MetaBiota's primary goal is to make sure that this biological dark matter never, ever, ever is questioned as being generated by the life forms we already know, but is a potentially undiscovered source of new phylogeny of life, which is not a very parsimonious hypothesis to pursue.

01:36:21.331 --> 01:36:33.962
Listen to him say it very carefully here, because this is the idea that Kevin McKernan, Charles Rixey, Kevin McCairn, Jessica Rose, Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:34.002 --> 01:36:34.582
all believe in.

01:36:35.363 --> 01:36:40.547
We've determined that this information is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life.

01:36:41.553 --> 01:36:50.782
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy, there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists.

01:36:51.783 --> 01:36:58.749
That buried in this life are signatures, in this genetic information, are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.

01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:21.893
that as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's, and G's, we may uncover a completely new class of life that, like BioRank, will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology, that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us, or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with, or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.

01:37:22.774 --> 01:37:34.137
I'm pleased to announce that along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF, we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.

01:37:35.217 --> 01:37:43.119
A little over a hundred years ago, people were unaware of viruses, the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

01:37:43.919 --> 01:37:50.021
A hundred years from now, people may... He said it again, and Alper and others discovering prions is on there.

01:37:50.081 --> 01:37:51.021
That's handy, isn't it?

01:37:52.128 --> 01:37:54.509
one of the only other things that needs to be on there, right?

01:37:54.549 --> 01:37:55.709
Viruses, prions.

01:37:57.829 --> 01:38:04.371
A marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses.

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:05.731
A new class of life.

01:38:06.191 --> 01:38:19.194
What they're doing is expanding the definition of life to include things that aren't pattern integrities, to steal a term most aptly used and defined by my hero, Buckminster Fuller.

01:38:22.006 --> 01:38:23.188
A real biologist.

01:38:23.568 --> 01:38:25.110
A real naturalist.

01:38:25.331 --> 01:38:29.536
A real appreciator of the irreducible complexity all around him.

01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.483
That's what they're doing here.

01:38:34.523 --> 01:38:35.404
That's what he did.

01:38:35.504 --> 01:38:36.886
That's what they do.

01:38:37.507 --> 01:38:38.969
They cast an enchantment.

01:38:41.499 --> 01:38:43.401
They are not doing real science.

01:38:43.441 --> 01:38:44.823
They are casting an enchantment.

01:38:44.863 --> 01:38:58.179
And now we're supposed to believe from Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey, that these enchanters like Peter Daszak and Nathan Wolf were real bona fide fricking virologists that are ultimately responsible for the pandemic.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:08.983
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet, and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.

01:39:09.723 --> 01:39:14.945
BioRank and its kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers.

01:39:15.385 --> 01:39:17.426
People like that young girl from... He's reading!

01:39:18.922 --> 01:39:21.843
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this.

01:39:22.663 --> 01:39:26.065
Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.

01:39:26.885 --> 01:39:31.047
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.

01:39:31.747 --> 01:39:35.288
There are unknowns all around us, and they're just waiting to be discovered.

01:39:36.188 --> 01:39:36.529
Thank you.

01:39:44.492 --> 01:39:48.133
Right before that, he gave a presentation to 1,000 middle school students.

01:39:50.273 --> 01:39:51.874
Now this is after the pandemic.

01:39:51.934 --> 01:39:55.377
This is during the pandemic, much older Nathan Wolf, 10 years later.

01:39:55.418 --> 01:39:56.398
Let's see what he's got to say.

01:39:56.418 --> 01:39:57.239
Welcome to FI ThinkPod.

01:39:57.519 --> 01:39:58.460
My name is Francisco.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.361
And I'm Aziz.

01:39:59.821 --> 01:40:04.806
And at ThinkPod, we speak about the smartest ideas and the biggest challenges facing the world right now.

01:40:05.186 --> 01:40:09.450
Have you ever considered the possibility that actually Soph is responding for Sasha?

01:40:11.477 --> 01:40:18.792
or somebody who worked for SOF or ran SOF or is involved with that whole persona is actually responding for Sasha.

01:40:19.273 --> 01:40:21.638
Sasha's not wasting her time on substacks.

01:40:22.802 --> 01:40:24.203
and comments, there's no way.

01:40:24.944 --> 01:40:32.410
And a lot of those comments are so adolescent and over the top that it leads me to believe that it's maybe her daughter.

01:40:32.811 --> 01:40:41.058
And what's really funny about it is, is oftentimes there's like things like my brilliant daughter, my brilliant daughter, my super smart daughter, too bad my daughter's smarter than you.

01:40:41.478 --> 01:40:45.181
It kind of sounds like maybe her daughter's the one who's doing it.

01:40:45.221 --> 01:40:47.223
I mean, at this stage, who cares?

01:40:47.403 --> 01:40:49.225
It's just obvious that Sasha is a,

01:40:49.725 --> 01:40:54.735
and not a patriot and definitely a meddler and probably has been a meddler since she came to the country.

01:40:55.176 --> 01:40:58.583
We speak about where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.

01:41:02.568 --> 01:41:10.831
Today our guests are the virus hunter himself, Dr. Nathan Wolf, Chairman of MetaBiota, and the CEO of MetaBiota, Ms.

01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:11.511
Nita Madhav.

01:41:11.892 --> 01:41:18.554
We talk about the Global Infectious Disease Index, the breakthrough tool developed in partnership with the FII Institute.

01:41:18.934 --> 01:41:25.197
And we ask, what are the lessons we can learn from COVID to prevent a future pandemic causing a global shutdown?

01:41:25.777 --> 01:41:32.445
So Nita, we talked about the Global Infectious Disease Index over the past few months and you guys have worked together to develop a breakthrough tool.

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:39.294
Can you talk to us a little bit about the tool that we've developed together and then the insights that you hope and believe that it will help people extract?

01:41:39.653 --> 01:41:51.516
Yes, so the Global Infectious Disease Index that we built together encompasses a few different components that you don't always see together when you're looking at this type of infectious disease data.

01:41:52.056 --> 01:42:03.739
So we've included data on endemic diseases, the top five, including HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, and low respiratory tract infections, along with

01:42:04.219 --> 01:42:13.423
a tracking tool that we have that uses AI to detect early signals of epidemic threats that are emerging and could pose a threat.

01:42:13.463 --> 01:42:14.303
Of course it does.

01:42:14.323 --> 01:42:23.407
And on top of that, we've also added the country systems information to look at how health systems rank compared to global norms and other indicators.

01:42:24.047 --> 01:42:30.750
And then the fourth component is the ranking, the performance metrics of how well a country is doing

01:42:31.150 --> 01:42:37.518
with its infectious disease burden compared to what its health systems would suggest how they should be doing.

01:42:38.079 --> 01:42:47.511
What would you say are some of the most significant lessons learned from this pandemic that would help us avoid falling into the same traps in a future pandemic, God forbid?

01:42:48.038 --> 01:43:03.485
We've learned from this pandemic that there are new features that are really necessary in order to be able to appropriately capture these viruses and extinguish them before they become substantive.

01:43:03.685 --> 01:43:06.347
And I would say it's just a few of those failures.

01:43:06.587 --> 01:43:12.990
One of them would be that the pace at which we've responded to this virus is sort of a human pace.

01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:18.714
and effectively we will need to move to something much more like a machine pace.

01:43:19.155 --> 01:43:20.496
Oh yeah!

01:43:20.536 --> 01:43:22.717
We can't wait for people to make decisions.

01:43:22.737 --> 01:43:29.923
We're gonna have to automate everything so that when the screen lights up, pandemic, that everybody around the world acts faster than they did now.

01:43:30.424 --> 01:43:34.587
So their AI and a little network, oh my shit, this is terrible.

01:43:35.147 --> 01:43:38.150
A group of people sitting around looking at data and deciding what to do.

01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.411
we need always-on monitoring systems.

01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:53.535
So if you look at how long it took us, say, in the United States to develop a diagnostic that was capable of detecting COVID accurately, there's no need for that.

01:43:53.575 --> 01:43:59.877
There's technology that permits us to diagnose any virus easily and with full information.

01:43:59.977 --> 01:44:04.538
And those should be always looking for viruses in the population such that when

01:44:05.058 --> 01:44:08.582
you do have an epidemic, it's not like you have to race to ramp up a system.

01:44:08.782 --> 01:44:11.464
The other thing would be silos and integration.

01:44:12.205 --> 01:44:19.853
For example, there's really no common language with which the WHO can speak with vaccine manufacturers,

01:44:20.513 --> 01:44:34.990
And the way that we think of this is that in the future there likely will be some sort of, think of it as a platform, almost like an IT tool that permits the same set of underlying model data, monitoring data, which could be informed by new technologies.

01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:58.353
to be shared and communicated between policymakers and local health and vaccine manufacturers in such a way that permits the public health response and even the financial response to feel like a coordinated system working in concert as opposed to a number of different features sometimes working at odds with each other.

01:44:58.601 --> 01:45:02.805
I mean, there's some other features, but I think those are some primary features.

01:45:03.025 --> 01:45:09.531
Another way to think of it, and those features will move us from a situation where I consider it like a sledgehammer.

01:45:09.791 --> 01:45:21.421
When you think of how we've deployed lockdowns and quarantine, or even vaccination, it's in some ways, you know, relatively not particularly refined.

01:45:21.641 --> 01:45:25.442
And what we really want to be is in a position where we can use a scalpel.

01:45:26.263 --> 01:45:38.467
And so I think those three areas will help to move our monitoring systems away from blunt use of response tools to a much more custom, specific use of those tools.

01:45:38.487 --> 01:45:41.628
And you can imagine a world where you have limited vaccines.

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:44.309
They're deployed very specifically in such a way that

01:45:45.049 --> 01:45:55.696
individuals that, you know, how do you stretch your vaccines to make the impact of each jab greatest in the context of lowering the epidemic?

01:45:56.176 --> 01:46:05.002
And just taking into account vaccination rates or disease mortality, those are probably not sufficient to do a truly optimized system.

01:46:05.307 --> 01:46:15.734
I just wanted to add to what Nathan was saying on the concept of the always-on system, that part of that too is the decision-making around how to respond.

01:46:16.394 --> 01:46:22.758
And that a lot of times there doesn't seem to be the frameworks for making those decisions that are already in place.

01:46:23.119 --> 01:46:34.086
And with the tools such as the index and other tools that allow us to anticipate what the threats might be, this can actually be something that's done ahead of time, where there can actually be

01:46:34.466 --> 01:46:44.172
a recipe book of how are we going to respond if this happens or that happens and so the the type of planning that can be done ahead of time I think is something that we can really learn from in this pandemic as well.

01:46:44.676 --> 01:46:47.318
So you've both mentioned an automated always-on system.

01:46:47.678 --> 01:46:50.941
We've had other pandemics in previous decades and years.

01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:53.623
Why haven't we learned from those instances?

01:46:53.883 --> 01:46:55.784
Why is it something that now we're looking for?

01:46:55.804 --> 01:47:01.408
So he's definitely accepted the presupposition that we've had pandemics before, even though we really haven't.

01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:06.552
And that's already part of this extraordinary illusion, the illusion of consensus.

01:47:06.592 --> 01:47:07.673
To develop these solutions.

01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:14.893
I mean, I think one answer to that is it's quite good news that the technology continues to change.

01:47:15.373 --> 01:47:24.955
For example, the kind of modeling work that NIDA has done within our organization is stuff, some of which would have been computationally impossible 10, 15 years ago.

01:47:25.015 --> 01:47:26.235
You can talk more about that.

01:47:26.295 --> 01:47:28.496
But another one is molecular diagnostics.

01:47:29.116 --> 01:47:37.603
So the ways in which we can diagnose illnesses with individuals have changed our ability to conceive of the right monitoring system.

01:47:37.623 --> 01:47:42.027
And I'll give you an example, which is cell-free nucleic acids.

01:47:42.708 --> 01:47:53.698
So we now, rather than having to take cerebrospinal fluid and a liver biopsy, nasopharyngeal swab, et cetera, et cetera, in order to know all of the microbes in an individual,

01:47:54.378 --> 01:47:59.321
You can effectively do a liquid biopsy or a cell-free nucleic acid from blood alone.

01:48:00.001 --> 01:48:07.665
You can use the little bits of genetic information to extrapolate and know basically all of the microbes present in an individual.

01:48:08.305 --> 01:48:16.009
And so that technology, which is very recent, last five to 10 years, and it's colleagues and collaborators of ours, Geoswab, et cetera, et cetera.

01:48:16.069 --> 01:48:23.633
I have a hard time believing that the lie about sequencing

01:48:24.969 --> 01:48:50.294
and the technology of sequencing has progressed so far that where we couldn't really sequence a whole human genome very well until very recently, and certainly not very quickly, to now saying that we can take a blood sample and we can know what all the microbes are in that person, is that not any different than what that lady for Theranos was saying she could do?

01:48:51.215 --> 01:48:52.335
How is that any different?

01:48:53.038 --> 01:49:11.994
Taking the fragments of biological material in blood and analyzing all the potential diseases someone has is just as magnificent as saying that we can just take the bits and pieces of DNA and blood and find out all the microbes that are present in somebody.

01:49:12.034 --> 01:49:13.155
That could be possible.

01:49:14.016 --> 01:49:23.181
But it just seems like something that this guy doesn't know the biology and doesn't know the limitations of it like somebody like Kevin McKernan surely does.

01:49:24.062 --> 01:49:37.730
And it's extraordinary because he's really making bold statements not that dissimilar from Elon Musk the other day who says that because we can put wires in the brain and read data that we can read and write the brain, which is just absurd.

01:49:38.752 --> 01:49:46.102
Just because we can detect this huge, bright background signal doesn't mean that we can use PCR to figure out what it all is.

01:49:47.264 --> 01:49:52.391
Especially if half of it is coming from the animals that we think they are preying on.

01:49:53.092 --> 01:49:53.933
It's ridiculous.

01:49:54.153 --> 01:50:02.477
In order to know all of the microbes in an individual, you can effectively do a liquid biopsy or a cell-free nucleic acid from blood alone.

01:50:03.138 --> 01:50:10.802
You can use the little bits of genetic information to extrapolate and know basically all of the microbes present in an individual.

01:50:11.002 --> 01:50:21.468
And then also have a blood sample that would give you a much better picture of the person and the person's biological status rather than the microbiome.

01:50:22.208 --> 01:50:27.114
And so you could say you're collecting a blood sample for one thing and then it becomes a remnant after you use it.

01:50:27.154 --> 01:50:28.816
The remnant can be sold to anyone.

01:50:31.087 --> 01:50:34.269
That's what they did with all the PCR tests at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:41.715
And during all of this testing at universities, they sold the remnants, which had the genetic samples of all these students.

01:50:41.755 --> 01:50:42.936
They sold the remnants.

01:50:43.016 --> 01:50:45.378
The remnants went into the private market.

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:54.065
And so that technology, which is very recent, last five to 10 years, and it's colleagues and collaborators of ours that have discovered and invented that technology.

01:50:54.825 --> 01:51:08.943
If you live in a world where to get all of the viruses from an individual, you would effectively have to put them in a blender, is not conducive for conceptualizing a world in which you could know all the viruses within a population all the time.

01:51:10.184 --> 01:51:32.135
But once you have that technology, you start thinking to yourself, well, if you sampled effectively, could you reach a point in the future where perhaps a particular government or city might know effectively the vast majority of viruses and the vast majority of citizens all the time?

01:51:32.655 --> 01:51:45.186
And if you, just for a moment, think about a world that is like... So how would you differentiate between monitoring all the viruses and all the people in Pittsburgh versus monitoring the genetic changes of all the people in Pittsburgh over time?

01:51:45.686 --> 01:51:47.408
How would you differentiate between that?

01:51:47.448 --> 01:51:52.392
How and which of those biological signals do you think would be stronger in that sample?

01:51:52.432 --> 01:51:58.177
Because from my perspective, having somebody's blood sample gives you a huge bright signal about their

01:51:58.757 --> 01:52:02.482
their medical data and their genetic data and their immunological state.

01:52:03.664 --> 01:52:10.053
And very, very, very, very, very little information on their microbiome, especially what's on their skin or in their nose.

01:52:12.631 --> 01:52:30.806
And so an extraordinary bait and switch is happening here where he's basically selling the same bamboozling lie about what we can do with a blood sample and what we would do with it, which is figure out all the bad guys in your body instead of what is most useful for, which is sampling you.

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:43.511
that, how profoundly different it is from the world that we just experienced over the last year or so.

01:52:43.571 --> 01:52:52.584
And I think some of those features would have been very difficult to conceive of or it would have been too theoretical in the absence of some of these new technologies.

01:52:53.325 --> 01:52:58.911
I think technology plays a role, and it's going to figure into it even more prominently.

01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:03.857
And we've also seen the acceleration of various kinds of developments in diagnostic tools.

01:53:03.977 --> 01:53:09.303
I mean, we've got to remember, Ray Kurzweiler points it out all the time, that there's an exponential curve that we're on.

01:53:09.343 --> 01:53:11.845
And at some point, all disease is just going to be cured.

01:53:12.646 --> 01:53:13.026
Bang!

01:53:13.507 --> 01:53:15.168
We're like 10 years away from it.

01:53:15.828 --> 01:53:22.473
I often don't respect the exponential curve like these futurists do, but they're sure the exponential curve is on the way up.

01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:24.734
And vaccines, therapeutics.

01:53:25.455 --> 01:53:33.360
But I think one thing that we've often seen after a lot of previous epidemics and pandemics is what's been called the cycle of panic and neglect.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.003
So you see, you know, when we're in the midst of an event, there is this huge panic.

01:53:39.063 --> 01:53:40.184
Everybody is responding.

01:53:40.544 --> 01:53:41.605
And then the event is over.

01:53:41.925 --> 01:53:45.607
And then it goes to this, you know, falls into a little bit of neglect.

01:53:45.907 --> 01:53:46.948
Funding goes away.

01:53:47.088 --> 01:53:50.690
And so, you know, I think what we want to do is get out of that cycle.

01:53:50.730 --> 01:54:01.537
And I think COVID pandemic devastating as it's been, I think it is a game changer in the sense that it will move us out of that and really propel the change we need to see.

01:54:02.108 --> 01:54:04.329
I have a question tying onto the neglect part.

01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:09.811
We've seen vaccination rates in developed world, almost proliferation entirely.

01:54:10.111 --> 01:54:14.373
But in a developing world, there's a lack of access to vaccines, particularly in remote areas.

01:54:14.913 --> 01:54:24.377
Do you feel like this is going to create issues with other COVID variants or will create further issues downstream in terms of expanding that division between developed and undeveloped?

01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:36.427
Look, it's a virus that's constantly mutating and exploring the genetic space that it has in the context, not in a conscious way, of course, but that's how selection is working.

01:54:37.047 --> 01:54:51.494
So the greater number of cases there are, the higher the probability that there will be a variant which is capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity, for example, or it has a different mortality profile that may be more deadly.

01:54:52.294 --> 01:55:03.904
So, part of limiting cases is to decrease the financial and health burden associated with it, but it's also just to decrease the potential for the emergence of new variants.

01:55:04.525 --> 01:55:15.555
And again, as we think to the future, which is how we as an organization and both of us as scientists and entrepreneurs focus, it's really about future.

01:55:16.415 --> 01:55:19.176
Scientists and entrepreneurs, he said.

01:55:19.276 --> 01:55:23.318
Wow, that's incredible to even say that word in this context.

01:55:23.558 --> 01:55:31.301
And even the, certainly the inequality features have been very well discussed, so I won't, you know, acknowledge those and just move on.

01:55:32.021 --> 01:55:48.844
But you could imagine a future where within countries and even between countries, there's an optimal distribution of vaccines, which may always be limited, in order to achieve objectives, which in this case would probably be to limit transmission on a global basis.

01:55:48.904 --> 01:55:55.185
And that may very well, in the future, work along axes that are different than developed and developing.

01:55:55.205 --> 01:55:57.766
And right now, again, it's the sledgehammer.

01:55:58.006 --> 01:55:59.986
And even the way that we're deploying the sledgehammer

01:56:01.146 --> 01:56:07.207
as you've noted, sort of unequal, unfair, unreasonable, and probably not effective.

01:56:07.888 --> 01:56:24.171
One thing that, you know, relates to some of the work that we've done on the index, but broadly with some of the topics you guys mentioned about tracking viruses, how should bio data be shared and are there any privacy concerns where should citizens give up their privacy to make more accessible data available to scientists?

01:56:25.046 --> 01:56:32.532
Well, this is always a trade-off and something that we look very closely at and really take very seriously.

01:56:33.053 --> 01:56:36.015
All of the data that we use is actually anonymized.

01:56:36.035 --> 01:56:38.217
There isn't really that private information in it.

01:56:38.557 --> 01:56:44.082
But as we now see that there's trends in the internet.

01:56:44.102 --> 01:56:46.784
There's no private information in your blood sample.

01:56:46.904 --> 01:56:49.106
Wow, that is spectacularly lame.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:55.565
of things and personal devices, and the trend is really heading towards this very personalized data.

01:56:56.005 --> 01:57:07.254
And it's something, as we're applying AI tools, as we're mining that data, it's something where these protections do need to be in place, and it's something that needs to be taken seriously.

01:57:07.274 --> 01:57:18.523
I think that the first step is really to acknowledge that these issues and limitations are there, and then look to how to best balance the global public good with

01:57:18.883 --> 01:57:19.964
the privacy concerns.

01:57:20.604 --> 01:57:23.647
Maybe just to add to that, there's so much low-hanging fruit.

01:57:23.787 --> 01:57:34.696
It's such a non-optimized system that there's plenty of gain that we can get with data that's... Another thing to say is there's no need in any of the work we do for human genetic data.

01:57:35.236 --> 01:57:43.443
So anonymized data, non-human genetic data, it's not that we actually... What I think you need to understand is that they don't need that.

01:57:46.039 --> 01:58:01.174
I think it's very likely that with repeated sampling from these students at the University of Illinois or these students at the University of Ohio, that they could use that data and go back to samples that are also in the EPIC database.

01:58:02.095 --> 01:58:10.082
It's very likely that a lot of these hospital databases of these big corporations are already invested in trying to populate the genetic data

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:13.065
of the patients in their systems.

01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:25.496
Whether that's a secret thing or a black ops thing or whatever, there's little doubt in my mind that the Epic database behind the scenes has as much genetic data as possible.

01:58:26.617 --> 01:58:35.104
Don't forget that one of the things in this Trump narrative is that that guy didn't have any social media presence, they identified him by DNA.

01:58:35.967 --> 01:58:36.447
the shooter.

01:58:36.947 --> 01:58:38.088
They identified him by DNA.

01:58:38.108 --> 01:58:47.772
Well, how would they have that unless it was already being sampled regularly from everybody in public health and everybody in these public or private databases?

01:58:49.013 --> 01:58:55.936
If there's collaboration between the national security state and these corporations that run our hospitals, then we're already there.

01:58:56.832 --> 01:59:07.110
And de-identifying this data becomes irrelevant if, behind the scenes, there's a national security priority that allows them to do it anyway.

01:59:08.191 --> 01:59:27.780
And there's almost no doubt in my mind that there is a national security priority that would be behind Metalbiota, behind EcoHealth Alliance, and behind their illusion of pandemic potential, which is designed to coerce people unwittingly into jumping into this system, whether they know it or not.

01:59:29.226 --> 01:59:41.179
PCR tests, the sequencing, this was all done under the guise of studying something outside of you, taking blood samples or saliva samples every week.

01:59:41.219 --> 01:59:42.260
This is ridiculous.

01:59:42.841 --> 01:59:50.889
You are giving up, we were giving up our data long ago and they've been sampling it long ago because the Human Genome Project admitted it.

01:59:51.630 --> 02:00:04.796
When they actually said they were done, what they were done with was a restriction enzyme map of a single genome, which gave them landmarks to look at across other genomes so that they could start comparing across genomes.

02:00:05.196 --> 02:00:12.960
But they were in no way, shape, or form ready to start saying they were sequencing whole genomes and getting useful information out of them.

02:00:15.970 --> 02:00:23.694
They don't know how to read Chinese, so they can't take a Chinese encyclopedia and start translating in random places.

02:00:23.734 --> 02:00:29.496
What they got to do is look for landmarks and see what landmarks are shared across different encyclopedia sets.

02:00:29.556 --> 02:00:30.017
That's it.

02:00:31.397 --> 02:00:33.038
Are there the same number of volumes?

02:00:33.078 --> 02:00:35.239
Do the volumes always divide in the same place?

02:00:35.599 --> 02:00:39.061
That's about all they're doing right now with regard to genomes and mapping.

02:00:40.157 --> 02:00:45.281
And yes, they zero in on specific signals sometimes and they spend lots of money on specific signals.

02:00:45.802 --> 02:00:55.490
But the way that they exaggerate the fidelity with which we investigate these signals in virology and in human physiology is absurd.

02:00:55.951 --> 02:00:58.092
And this guy is a great example of it.

02:00:58.653 --> 02:01:05.759
I think we can make a tremendous amount of progress in making these systems much more optimal without having to sacrifice privacy.

02:01:06.561 --> 02:01:15.970
I have a quick question referencing to some of your... And so it keeps becoming about privacy and about free speech, free speech and privacy, free speech and privacy.

02:01:16.391 --> 02:01:19.374
It's never about informed consent where people can say no.

02:01:19.814 --> 02:01:23.978
And it's never, ever, ever, ever, ever about the biology.

02:01:24.058 --> 02:01:25.800
The biology is just assumed.

02:01:26.741 --> 02:01:28.783
And the worst case scenario is always assumed.

02:01:41.997 --> 02:01:45.881
Think back about 15 years ago in the context of climate.

02:01:47.263 --> 02:01:56.253
15 years ago, climate was something that probably was discussed mostly at earth sciences, or it was seen as an atmospheric phenomena.

02:01:57.294 --> 02:02:09.520
The reality that we recognize now is that it's a profound human phenomena that transcends institutions, whether you're a CEO or a central banker or someone doing public health.

02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:12.301
This is an issue which is vital.

02:02:12.421 --> 02:02:14.282
It's a fundamental systemic risk.

02:02:14.342 --> 02:02:17.644
Did he just mention all the governing factors of our world here?

02:02:17.684 --> 02:02:18.564
What was that all about?

02:02:18.945 --> 02:02:21.046
Seen as an atmospheric phenomena.

02:02:21.986 --> 02:02:34.310
The reality that we recognize now is that it's a profound human phenomena that transcends institutions, whether you're a CEO or a central banker or someone doing public health.

02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:37.091
This is an issue which is vital.

02:02:37.211 --> 02:02:39.951
It's a fundamental systemic risk that humans face.

02:02:40.552 --> 02:02:46.914
We see pandemics in the same way for reasons... Okay, so let's just leave it right there.

02:02:46.954 --> 02:02:47.754
I'm not even gonna do it.

02:02:47.894 --> 02:02:48.934
I'm not even gonna do it.

02:02:48.954 --> 02:02:49.554
Let me just move.

02:02:51.775 --> 02:03:01.338
Let me just move a slide because I do, I should have repeated a slide here that I didn't repeat because I really want to be sure I'm hitting home what is happening here.

02:03:01.438 --> 02:03:03.098
What actually we just watched.

02:03:03.218 --> 02:03:03.518
Okay.

02:03:04.078 --> 02:03:09.000
Now, first of all, just a little, just a little joke here, right?

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.040
Just a little joke here.

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:11.160
Just something to think about.

02:03:11.981 --> 02:03:15.722
Um, so who was that lady in the video?

02:03:16.742 --> 02:03:16.862
Um,

02:03:19.013 --> 02:03:23.875
I'm sort of not convinced, but I'm kind of sort of weirded out.

02:03:25.255 --> 02:03:27.556
The only, the best frame that I could get is that one.

02:03:27.596 --> 02:03:41.201
The best picture of Li Min Yan is that one that I could find where you can kind of see the facial shape and whether the eyebrows and nose are similarly rounded or not, but one's smiling and one isn't, one's looking in the camera and isn't it.

02:03:41.721 --> 02:03:44.682
But it's very strange that that woman

02:03:45.362 --> 02:03:47.363
Was in the video, but wasn't in the video.

02:03:47.703 --> 02:03:52.226
And she likes the same kind of glasses, although she does part her hair on the different side.

02:03:54.447 --> 02:03:55.687
And there's a few other things.

02:03:55.727 --> 02:03:58.649
That lady's got a wedding ring, so I don't know what that means.

02:04:00.490 --> 02:04:01.890
Anyway, it's just curious, right?

02:04:01.930 --> 02:04:03.451
Because Li Min Yan is gone.

02:04:04.172 --> 02:04:05.452
We don't hear from her anymore.

02:04:05.512 --> 02:04:09.494
She was really big in 2020, but not big anymore.

02:04:09.534 --> 02:04:10.975
Yeah, and there's no wedding ring in this one.

02:04:12.947 --> 02:04:15.710
You know, it could be a reversed frame, it could just be nothing, right?

02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:17.531
I mean, I'm just throwing that out there.

02:04:17.932 --> 02:04:26.840
What I'm not throwing out there though, and what is very real, is that these two gentlemen have decided to coordinate messaging on Twitter.

02:04:27.661 --> 02:04:32.886
These two gentlemen who have meddled with my family, and meddled with my work,

02:04:33.892 --> 02:04:39.055
and I believe done a very big dishonor to my work.

02:04:40.016 --> 02:04:43.898
And essentially they are traitors to America and to our children.

02:04:45.339 --> 02:04:57.047
And they are agreement here in recent July tweets that somebody like Metalbiota and Nathan Wolf are legitimate virologists

02:04:57.927 --> 02:05:04.050
who are ultimately behind the pandemic, responsible for the pandemic, maybe even caused it.

02:05:04.610 --> 02:05:15.536
Peter Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance, Metobiota, the labs in Ukraine, and that guy being the ultimate deep state operative.

02:05:15.616 --> 02:05:18.457
That is, of course, absurd.

02:05:19.298 --> 02:05:23.540
And the reason why it's absurd is because these are the same people.

02:05:25.202 --> 02:05:29.911
that were promoted in 2017, 18 and 19 before the pandemic started.

02:05:30.392 --> 02:05:37.084
These are the same people that were put in place and that have been in place for many, many years perpetuating this narrative.

02:05:37.884 --> 02:05:54.953
And their same people have been touring the world, perpetuating this narrative, making sure that we never usefully question the existence of novel viruses, that we never usefully question the existence of a vaccine schedule, just whether or not we rushed a new component of it out.

02:05:56.601 --> 02:06:13.225
That's why this Human Genome Project employee and beneficiary of its IP, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, was put on podcasts early in 2020, just like Kevin McCarran was, just like Paul Cottrell was, just like George Webb was.

02:06:13.325 --> 02:06:16.966
These people were all out there, not spontaneously like myself.

02:06:18.194 --> 02:06:34.260
just naively on my bike doing Journal Club until the pandemic started, which there is more than ample evidence of, but instead just deciding to be a podcaster and already aware of the fact that Andy Kaufman was a no-virus bad guy.

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:42.047
and that the main thing we needed to argue about was where did this gain-of-function incapacitating agent come from?

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:48.373
Who released this dangerous new virus and how is it going to evolve over the next five years?

02:06:48.413 --> 02:07:00.724
They all agreed on it because this was the illusion of consensus that the national security state needed in order to coerce our families into taking transfection and transformation as just therapeutics.

02:07:02.031 --> 02:07:08.312
And they agree on it now on social media about the worst case scenario, likely being a gain of function virus.

02:07:08.332 --> 02:07:10.393
And if it wasn't this time, it will be next time.

02:07:10.493 --> 02:07:11.673
Are they trying to kill us?

02:07:12.313 --> 02:07:13.113
Oh my goodness.

02:07:13.173 --> 02:07:19.935
And the way they're getting away with it is not talking about what them themselves, this team of meddlers was doing in 2020 and 2021.

02:07:20.095 --> 02:07:23.696
And that's what they were doing.

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.264
They were driving around the internet trying to find people, wandering souls, looking for the truth.

02:07:33.324 --> 02:07:39.670
And they picked them up in their imaginary cars and drove them around saying, come on, get in the car, man.

02:07:39.710 --> 02:07:41.151
We're trying to find the truth too.

02:07:41.631 --> 02:07:42.192
Climb in.

02:07:43.173 --> 02:07:44.274
This is Pierre Cory.

02:07:44.714 --> 02:07:45.675
This is Robert Malone.

02:07:45.735 --> 02:07:47.977
And in the backseat, that's Jessica Rose.

02:07:48.017 --> 02:07:51.080
And we're all trying to solve the same problem you are.

02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:51.881
Come join us.

02:07:54.161 --> 02:07:59.226
Or maybe they said, this is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and this is CHD, and we're trying to solve the mystery.

02:07:59.266 --> 02:08:00.367
You should join us.

02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:06.573
But in reality, none of them were going to usefully question the existence of the virus.

02:08:06.733 --> 02:08:11.838
None of them were going to usefully question the existence of the vaccine schedule as being criminal.

02:08:13.039 --> 02:08:18.264
They just want freedom of choice and the freedom to talk about this stuff.

02:08:20.066 --> 02:08:29.168
just not the, they don't want to talk about the director of USAID or they don't want to talk about the director of DITRA and the connections that Robert Malone has to these people.

02:08:29.209 --> 02:08:35.290
They don't want to talk about the textbooks that Stanley Plotkin has written with Offit.

02:08:35.690 --> 02:08:41.432
They don't want to talk about Hilary Koprowski and his contributions to American history of public health.

02:08:41.772 --> 02:08:46.513
They don't want to talk about the Barr family and their contributions to recent American history.

02:08:46.533 --> 02:08:49.114
And they definitely don't want to talk about Joshua Lederberg

02:08:50.666 --> 02:09:03.880
and how his contributions to our rhetoric about genetic engineering has resulted in terms like gene therapy and resulted in terms like pandemic potential or pandemic prevention.

02:09:04.441 --> 02:09:11.128
These are all enchantments that are just basically semantic lies, semantic bamboozlement.

02:09:12.028 --> 02:09:15.392
And that's why they don't want to talk about our precise use of language.

02:09:16.013 --> 02:09:32.152
They don't want to talk about our precise use of language, like when we say RNA cannot pandemic, because it makes it very hard for them to use their enchantment against us when they're forced to pass through the dispelling language of gigaohm biological.

02:09:33.439 --> 02:09:53.107
That's why Robert Malone has so desperately tried to ignore me since we were forced to meet in the spring of 2022 on the podcast of Bobby Kennedy, and where him and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose coordinated the bamboozling of me for another year.

02:09:53.487 --> 02:09:55.828
He worked on retroviruses with all the kings.

02:09:56.348 --> 02:10:13.009
He also investigated packaging sequences, which likely means he understands that these are just exosomes and exosomal communication is real and it's being misconstrued as virology so that they can understand and study something of us that they otherwise would have to get consent to study.

02:10:14.230 --> 02:10:19.112
He's definitely suffered a lot since he's been so ethically superior his whole life.

02:10:20.053 --> 02:10:29.577
And despite all of this suffering, he eventually came to be working as a private contractor for DITRA, DOD, a lot of different big pharmaceutical companies, the WHO.

02:10:30.137 --> 02:10:37.083
and even chaired NIH study sections and given away or supervised the giving away of $50 billion worth of grants.

02:10:37.463 --> 02:10:45.590
He won't touch Judy Mikovits because she comes from the same line of mentors, the same line of narrative curators.

02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:54.136
And he won't really talk about Herit because he used to work with him and because they already made a movie together, which is laughably absurd.

02:10:54.357 --> 02:10:55.838
And we will watch that at some point.

02:10:56.198 --> 02:10:58.140
He's just the most interesting man in the world.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:05.489
That's all he is, according to Mickey Willis' video that I showed earlier in the show.

02:11:05.850 --> 02:11:07.752
They created this illusion of the pandemic.

02:11:07.792 --> 02:11:08.954
They definitely created it.

02:11:08.994 --> 02:11:11.617
These people created the illusion of the pandemic.

02:11:12.098 --> 02:11:15.122
These people helped sustain the illusion of the pandemic.

02:11:16.641 --> 02:11:18.302
And this is an ongoing thing.

02:11:18.342 --> 02:11:21.903
It's an ongoing worst case scenario narrative that we still have to argue about.

02:11:22.323 --> 02:11:30.146
The worst case scenario is, is that they rushed these shots and they're contaminated and we've hurt millions and millions of people around the world.

02:11:31.947 --> 02:11:32.907
And we probably have.

02:11:34.748 --> 02:11:45.692
And we've probably also bamboozled millions of children around the world into believing that that background signal that Nathan Wolf called biological dark matter doesn't exist.

02:11:46.872 --> 02:11:51.534
Or that the hypothesis that it's all viruses outside of us has already been confirmed.

02:11:52.514 --> 02:11:53.274
And these are lies.

02:11:53.814 --> 02:11:54.615
Stop lying!

02:11:55.675 --> 02:11:56.395
They're just lies.

02:11:57.416 --> 02:11:58.636
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:11:59.236 --> 02:12:00.157
It is that simple.

02:12:01.057 --> 02:12:04.958
And the faith about RNA being pandemic potential is a lie.

02:12:05.038 --> 02:12:06.759
Transfection is real, that's for sure.

02:12:08.103 --> 02:12:15.507
They cannot grow RNA in a dish and sustain it forever, even if the NIH tells you that, but what they can do is sequence stuff.

02:12:16.027 --> 02:12:17.828
And what they can do is make DNA.

02:12:19.569 --> 02:12:23.912
And maybe they can only make short sequences of DNA, but they can enzymatically connect them together.

02:12:23.952 --> 02:12:30.035
And so if they make short sequences and grow them in bacterial culture, they're real and they will be fairly pure.

02:12:30.635 --> 02:12:35.278
And if you combine them with, I'm just going to escape out of here really quick and, and start it again.

02:12:38.476 --> 02:12:40.597
and advance a little faster through here.

02:12:40.637 --> 02:12:41.897
Hopefully the memory cleared.

02:12:43.157 --> 02:12:49.779
You can also grow them and you can combine them with RNA polymerase or put them in cell culture or electroporate animals or give them to your friends.

02:12:50.239 --> 02:12:52.660
And you can call them infectious clones if you want to.

02:12:53.520 --> 02:13:05.844
But the reality is, is that the way you make them, the way that they are made, the way that they start with a synthetic DNA sequence and forever after that are synthetic, they do not recapitulate whatever signal has been purported to be found in the wild.

02:13:06.823 --> 02:13:25.194
But they do make the opportunity for that sequence to be made in the same way that all other biologics are made in mass quantities by any of the pharmaceutical company giants that we have on Earth that make biologics like venom or like monoclonal antibodies.

02:13:26.095 --> 02:13:31.717
And so the virology people call this infectious DNA and RNA, they call them infectious clones.

02:13:32.197 --> 02:13:33.317
But that's just a lie.

02:13:33.357 --> 02:13:45.821
It's a semantic enchantment, which covers up the fact that RNA and RNA virology is very simply synthetic DNA and RNA in quantity applied to cell culture or animals.

02:13:45.881 --> 02:13:48.422
It's transfection and transformation in animals.

02:13:48.482 --> 02:13:48.822
That's it.

02:13:50.233 --> 02:13:55.617
Virology as it stands is not pandemic potential in a dish.

02:13:56.497 --> 02:14:06.284
It is not Ralph Baric and Metobiota and Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak having no respect for Mother Nature.

02:14:06.384 --> 02:14:06.865
It is not.

02:14:06.905 --> 02:14:07.986
It's just synthetic

02:14:08.686 --> 02:14:12.489
biology, and it is the most simple synthetic biology.

02:14:12.829 --> 02:14:23.616
They created the illusion of consensus that this synthetic biology would lead to bioweapons, would lead to the worst-case scenario being a pandemic of a bioweapon, and that is an illusion.

02:14:24.096 --> 02:14:40.325
They have been creating for years and years and years, and that's why, in retrospect, a guy like Nathan Wolfe looks like such a clown, and why it is so ridiculous that Kevin McKernan and Charles Rixey want us to believe that that's the guy at the center of this mess.

02:14:40.825 --> 02:14:55.324
It is exactly the same bullshit reason why they won't admit that synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA in quantity is not only possible, but that's the only thing you would need in order to create the molecular illusion of a pandemic with extremely high fidelity.

02:14:57.622 --> 02:15:04.306
They don't want you to know that virology is just transfection and transformation in laboratories.

02:15:04.906 --> 02:15:17.773
They don't want you to know that so much that they are willing to commit murder and lie about it in the United States and around the world so that the illusion of pandemic potential will be created on the backs of that murder.

02:15:18.753 --> 02:15:19.734
That's what they've done.

02:15:19.754 --> 02:15:22.275
That's what they've done.

02:15:22.295 --> 02:15:24.757
That's what they've done.

02:15:24.777 --> 02:15:27.038
That's what they've done.

02:15:28.663 --> 02:15:29.435
That's what they've done.

02:15:30.759 --> 02:15:31.980
And that's why they ignore this.

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:36.623
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:15:36.743 --> 02:15:40.746
RNA cannot pandemic and transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:15:41.286 --> 02:15:44.728
And that's how we've been bamboozled by these weaponized piles of money.

02:15:44.768 --> 02:15:48.531
We've accepted the limited spectrum of debate imposed upon us.

02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:54.575
Please, ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:15:55.115 --> 02:16:00.579
If you like what you saw, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support my family and my work.

02:16:01.279 --> 02:16:06.421
And otherwise, wow, why is it always doing that to me?

02:16:06.781 --> 02:16:11.842
And if you want to share the video after the live stream is over, please share stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:16:11.882 --> 02:16:22.005
It takes about 20 minutes and then the stream is live there with no censoring, no login, no nothing, just watching on our own provided Peertube website.

02:16:23.045 --> 02:16:30.249
that clips are starting to be loaded up to and that Mark Kulak has started to load some of his episodes up in.

02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:37.893
Ladies and gentlemen, keep pushing, keep the constant pressure on, and if you can, please share my work in places you haven't.

02:16:38.393 --> 02:16:40.834
Please send emails to your family and friends.

02:16:41.274 --> 02:16:46.137
I think this is a really good one to share with them because we are attempting to stop the program.

02:16:47.177 --> 02:16:54.926
If we stop the program, if we pause it right here and people see how these meddlers line up just like this, they're lined up right now.

02:16:56.228 --> 02:16:57.309
I think it's really important.

02:16:57.389 --> 02:17:02.295
I think it's really the time and the place where these things are lining up right now.

02:17:02.875 --> 02:17:07.520
And thank you very, very, very much for being here and I'm going to see you guys again tomorrow.

02:17:40.316 --> 02:17:42.379
I think I got to clear my desktop or something.

02:17:42.679 --> 02:17:47.667
The memory gets like bogged down with my big slide decks and all the stuff and whatever.

02:17:47.707 --> 02:17:49.489
But anyway, thank you very much for being here.

02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:50.571
I'll see you again tomorrow, guys.
