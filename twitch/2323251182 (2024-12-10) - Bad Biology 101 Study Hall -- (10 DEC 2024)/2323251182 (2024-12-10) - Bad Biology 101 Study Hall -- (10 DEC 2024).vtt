WEBVTT

01:32.134 --> 01:32.454
I'm here.

01:32.474 --> 01:35.256
I'm going to give you everybody a couple seconds to uh join up.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.197
Good to see you guys

01:37.332 --> 01:39.753
Good morning, Christy, Jason, Brother Spoon.

01:40.713 --> 01:45.074
And of course, number one on the list, left hand, Monkey Wrench again wins the money.

01:46.434 --> 01:48.555
He knew I was coming on, I think he could see it.

01:50.455 --> 01:52.895
Anyway, ooh, new notifications.

01:52.976 --> 01:55.556
Well, I don't know, we'll see how long that rides.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.037
Not a long introduction this morning.

01:58.817 --> 02:03.558
We're gonna try and save that for Mondays when we have to get everybody in the right mood to

02:04.983 --> 02:07.824
to appreciate the Meddler Circus.

02:08.725 --> 02:13.347
And then today we are doing actually Bad Biology, as you can see in the title.

02:13.387 --> 02:14.307
I hope I changed that.

02:15.788 --> 02:17.409
So I'll be here in a second.

02:49.417 --> 02:52.340
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.

03:11.280 --> 03:11.360
do

03:38.840 --> 03:41.921
You know, it's funny you would say that.

03:42.421 --> 03:44.902
We are going to talk a little bit about evolution today.

03:46.342 --> 03:50.884
We are going to talk about Bad Biology 101 and evolution because of DNA.

03:52.124 --> 03:59.787
I've discovered a new argument to make that is definitely not my own, but I haven't found all the people who have made this argument before me.

04:01.267 --> 04:04.308
But I think a lot of what's going on here is enabled

04:07.648 --> 04:14.152
by the ability of these people to use the sort of a, it's like an intellectual checkmate.

04:14.192 --> 04:15.493
Hi, my name is Jonathan Cooley.

04:15.513 --> 04:17.293
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage.

04:17.313 --> 04:20.575
I usually come to you as GigaOM Biological, a little news brief.

04:21.556 --> 04:30.460
But on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm gonna try and establish a pattern where I also come and discuss either some aspect of what I think should be a new Biology 101, or which,

04:33.806 --> 04:36.387
it's starting to become obvious that that's not going to be so easy.

04:37.127 --> 04:52.273
And it's something that's more of a project ongoing and a lot can be learned and developed from the angle of trying to see the bad biology that's present now because there's so much of it.

04:53.133 --> 04:59.856
And more importantly, so many of the ideas that the new biology will essentially break because if you start

05:01.092 --> 05:17.494
by understanding biology fundamentally, not as evolution because DNA, but you start understanding it as life as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, then you can start to imagine and process

05:19.483 --> 05:25.708
the living, breathing world outside of your, in your garden, you can start to process it in a different way.

05:25.728 --> 05:40.860
Because right now, because of the way we've been raised and because of the way that we've been taught about Biology 101, we and our imagination, and this is something very important that I hope I can, that I can revisit many times over the coming weeks.

05:43.142 --> 05:46.045
Your imagination can only work with the tools that it's given.

05:47.515 --> 06:00.203
And that's what is so magical about the current, you know, our generation being exposed to the level of and the sophisticated level of media that we are exposed to.

06:01.444 --> 06:16.334
Movies with CGI that can fool people are an exceptional tool with regard to arming people's imagination with sets of ideas which, if incorrect, can allow them to move forward

06:17.110 --> 06:25.659
You know, if you operate with logic on those ideas, then you can start to create all kinds of things that aren't real because the assumptions upon which they're based are false.

06:27.060 --> 06:32.746
And this is actually where we left off with Matt Briggs'

06:34.888 --> 06:46.979
probability course where we were just starting to understand how logic is a useful tool, but if applied incorrectly or without

06:48.661 --> 06:59.830
understanding that induction is ultimately what you need to be using, logic can be easily applied and get you nowhere, or even worse, get you into a very, very deep cave, and that's where I think we are.

07:01.531 --> 07:07.696
Just one very succinct way of saying how deep of a cave we're in, it could be that in

07:09.017 --> 07:12.879
in 15 years, intramuscular injection will be laughed at.

07:13.780 --> 07:31.030
Not that we let our kids on the internet and let them have social media or let them have violent video games, but actually we might be most ashamed of the fact that we let this horrible idea become accepted as a generally

07:32.110 --> 07:36.131
you know, understood fact that you can inject people with stuff.

07:36.691 --> 07:40.272
And that's a reasonable way of augmenting their health.

07:41.892 --> 07:53.535
I think we can get to the stage where young people and future, you know, parents of the next generation will be armed with a biology that will

07:55.393 --> 08:24.065
enable them to avoid, oh wow, I can't speak, avoid enslavement by these people who are pushing this bad biology that includes bad medicine and bad food and all kinds of bad advice that they're now gonna slowly back out of as if the people that are backing us out of it have just risen out of nowhere but are not part of the imprisonment that we are in.

08:24.997 --> 08:28.679
And that's why these ideas aren't going to be discussed except for by a few people.

08:29.440 --> 08:36.364
Maybe even just me and Mark Kulak of Hesotonic ITS will ever discuss the principle.

08:36.564 --> 08:48.952
And, you know, a few of the guys in my introduction, like Uwe Altschner, will discuss that if RNA cannot pandemic, this may be the single most important three words we pass on to our kids.

08:50.606 --> 08:59.774
If using intramuscular injection to administer medicine to healthy people is wrong, this may be one of the most important ideas that we pass on to our kids.

09:00.255 --> 09:16.710
And certainly, if the Human Genome Project has just begun, then the recent history of it and of science in general, if looked at under a different lens, should reveal

09:18.752 --> 09:34.259
the naked truth that the evolution because DNA mythology has enabled this creation, this giant false library of knowledge to be created based on that assumption.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.060
And that's a huge assumption.

09:37.100 --> 09:42.783
I mean, it's a huge assumption that again, remember that even the Olympic torch

09:44.073 --> 09:47.996
in Salt Lake City was the shape of a DNA molecule.

09:48.156 --> 09:53.199
And the DNA molecule was laser beamed into the middle of the Olympics of Athens.

09:53.399 --> 10:00.943
And there was a giant virus and all kinds of sick people in a hospital at the Olympic Games in London.

10:01.004 --> 10:04.426
These are all, they're narratives.

10:04.486 --> 10:11.250
They were narratives that were laid down and seeded and given to people behind the scenes to see, don't you think?

10:13.154 --> 10:18.477
that dignitaries take into Olympic games and told, look what you can see from above.

10:18.897 --> 10:19.678
Did you notice that?

10:20.438 --> 10:21.079
That's what's coming.

10:22.079 --> 10:22.860
And then it comes.

10:23.420 --> 10:37.248
Imagine the kind of influence and power that you could create if over the course of a decade or so, you brought certain people into what they thought was behind the curtain.

10:38.334 --> 10:51.863
and saw how the sausage was made or, you know, it's like when the curtain of Wizard of Oz is opened up and you see all the knobs and the place where he's speaking into and you realize that almost all of the effects are just, you know, what he does from his board.

10:54.245 --> 10:58.968
This is the kind of thing that I think they've been doing for a long time, bringing people in.

11:00.236 --> 11:02.378
bringing, letting people into the inside.

11:02.418 --> 11:11.564
There's this really famous photo with like Tom Brokaw and Judy Woodruff and, and an Annenberg lady and the old Bill Gates.

11:11.984 --> 11:18.769
And, and, and, you know, the, the, you know, the photograph I'm talking about that those people were brought in then.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.432
And they don't need to be brought in on everything.

11:22.632 --> 11:24.934
What they need to be brought in on is the idea.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.295
And this is very key.

11:26.495 --> 11:28.817
If you can imagine it, close your eyes and imagine.

11:29.548 --> 11:32.713
that there's a big velvet green curtain.

11:34.495 --> 11:36.077
And first they show you the curtain.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.086
Then they open it a little bit and you see that there's all kinds of activity back there.

11:42.667 --> 11:46.032
And people come out of the curtain and tell you what's behind the curtain.

11:48.547 --> 12:11.369
then they can also take you behind the curtain and let you see what's behind because for a long time they could just let you meet people who have been behind the curtain you can see them coming out from behind the curtain but you yourself are not allowed behind the curtain and then only years later are you allowed behind the curtain to see that actually behind the curtain there's a several other circular curtains

12:12.705 --> 12:20.195
on stage behind and on those circular curtains when you see behind them there are certain tables and they have all kinds of computers on them and stuff.

12:21.317 --> 12:28.967
And so you only after you are taken to the third level of because you did first you didn't even know the green curtain existed.

12:30.834 --> 12:42.573
And then for a long time, you were just mystified because now that you knew that the green curtain existed, you get to go to Bulls games and you get to sit in the, in the sky box and people, you know, do favors for you and stuff.

12:42.613 --> 12:45.258
And you get some phone numbers that work and you get free parking.

12:46.598 --> 13:01.305
But then when you see the curtain gets opened and you start meeting people coming out of the curtain, that's a whole nother five years of indoctrination and Truman show, you know, coordinated lying to you, setting up what to expect when you get behind the curtain.

13:01.345 --> 13:08.369
So that when you get behind the curtain, you also already see something that your imagination has already been prepared to see.

13:11.345 --> 13:15.706
And if this starts already when you're a child, that evolution is real.

13:15.806 --> 13:17.247
And here are the dinosaurs.

13:18.687 --> 13:23.469
And here are these super smart scientists who discovered DNA before you were even born.

13:24.209 --> 13:27.230
And here are all the Nobel Prize winners that have been given out.

13:28.850 --> 13:34.012
And here's your teacher telling you because he heard from her and they learned together and they want to...

13:37.352 --> 13:39.374
And it's all really based on logic.

13:39.735 --> 13:57.214
It's a gigantic scaffolding of knowledge that for the most part is an illusion because the founding, the principle of it, this DNA evolution because DNA, this doesn't work.

13:58.157 --> 14:02.358
It's not as an acidic idea as they present it as.

14:02.398 --> 14:11.179
They present it as though once we discover DNA, we have conclusive evidence that evolution is real.

14:11.619 --> 14:20.401
And so we need to think on these cosmic timescales and the change that we're looking for, we'll never actually see because it's on those cosmic timescales.

14:20.881 --> 14:26.802
And if we don't find evidence of those cosmic timescales in the rocks, well, then you're just gonna have to take our word for it.

14:27.182 --> 14:33.765
And if the rocks don't match up with even the cosmic scales that we do say we see in the rocks, we'll just scale everything up different.

14:34.225 --> 14:38.286
So these are all parts of the same toolkit.

14:40.847 --> 14:49.931
And they are logically linked all the way back down to this fundamental assumption that evolution is real because we found DNA.

14:52.324 --> 15:07.602
And I think if we approach biology from a different perspective, you will see that the idea of evolution is insufficient to explain the sacred irreducible complexity that we have to acknowledge if we approach it correctly.

15:08.646 --> 15:31.753
that the reason why I never made it in academic biology is because I couldn't square the circle with regards to why are we asking so many dumb questions, so many compartmentalized questions, so many questions that are basically just add-ons to already a long series of questions that seem to have petered out in usefulness a long time ago.

15:32.953 --> 15:36.054
Why do I have to follow in the footsteps of your mentor's mentor?

15:37.810 --> 15:43.494
because I studied with you, but in lots and lots of ways, that's how this goes.

15:43.534 --> 15:52.961
And so I wanted to take the time today, first of all, to take an example just out of the blue of academic biology being represented on the internet.

15:53.201 --> 15:58.165
And of course, I'm gonna choose one of the worst examples of how it's being represented.

15:58.285 --> 16:02.188
Here we have an example of a nonprofit actually,

16:02.968 --> 16:08.152
run by a Columbia professor or retired Columbia professor with a wife that works at Merck.

16:08.653 --> 16:16.639
And she actually worked at Merck for over 20 years on ivermectin, which is really interesting about Vincent Rackin-Yellow.

16:18.909 --> 16:29.675
And so the first video that we're going to study hall today and try to approach the bad biology idea is a video from Twiv.

16:30.235 --> 16:31.576
And we're not going to watch the whole thing.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.037
Don't get too worried.

16:33.457 --> 16:35.679
And then we're going to move on to another video, which

16:37.220 --> 16:39.741
I feel like I should frame right now, just before we get to it.

16:41.182 --> 16:43.904
You may remember a woman by the name of Hannah Fry.

16:43.964 --> 16:46.386
She's a redheaded lady from the UK.

16:47.126 --> 16:56.893
And she was in this very dubious BBC documentary where they, right before the pandemic, and it was in some town that started with an S.

16:58.414 --> 17:00.356
like, you know, Sanderberry or something like that.

17:00.496 --> 17:07.481
And she did a BBC documentary where they simulated an epidemic in this small town with a phone app.

17:08.041 --> 17:11.564
And everybody got all excited about participating in a BBC show.

17:11.964 --> 17:18.949
But then also, curiously enough, at the beginning of the pandemic, one of the first places that COVID-19 broke out was in this same town.

17:19.890 --> 17:22.092
I know somebody is going to remember that.

17:22.132 --> 17:24.413
So the Bloomberg

17:25.638 --> 17:35.785
Originals is a very highly produced set of films that are, you know, episodes and like little podcasts that are being put out with different hosts.

17:35.885 --> 17:41.168
And they're always women or I don't know what, I don't know if that matters.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.809
The two that I've found so far are women.

17:43.890 --> 17:48.293
And one of them is Hannah Fry and she's doing AI and how AI is very scary.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.415
It's going to take over the world and learn how birds talk and this kind of thing.

17:52.450 --> 18:03.716
And then there's this other lady, something Chan, who is doing, you know, how biology is being broken or all new rules of biology are being written.

18:04.156 --> 18:06.977
And so that video is what I want to watch today.

18:07.017 --> 18:12.920
But I'm bringing that video up not to bring up Hannah Fry, even though I think Hannah Fry is such an interesting character.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.221
And it's so interesting that

18:14.781 --> 18:26.905
Bloomberg Originals, making videos for YouTube and for the internet about these new transhuman topics, has chosen Hannah Fry to host one of these series.

18:26.965 --> 18:28.666
And that series is about AI.

18:29.526 --> 18:33.027
And it is equally comical as the one we're going to watch today.

18:33.448 --> 18:36.369
So first, in this Bad Biology,

18:40.540 --> 18:41.641
Bad Biology.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.562
Oops, that's not how I wanted to do it.

18:43.602 --> 18:44.783
I wanted to do it like this.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.926
This Bad Biology study hall.

18:48.406 --> 18:50.688
I want to watch a TWIV episode in just the beginning.

18:51.448 --> 18:55.311
I'm going to turn down the volume for a second, but just realize at the beginning what's happening here.

18:55.331 --> 19:02.497
This is a Columbia professor who is running a nonprofit in America with a studio in New York City.

19:03.470 --> 19:15.594
and asking for donations from viewers on YouTube when I can almost, I mean, I would bet dollars to donuts that this guy is fully funded by large sources of money.

19:16.194 --> 19:20.836
That's how they have the money to have a separate studio location.

19:21.896 --> 19:32.062
And all their fancy cameras and all their stuff and probably people running the stream and editing it for them All of that stuff is possible because they're getting a lot of money.

19:32.102 --> 19:38.806
That's not cheap It's just like, you know people who have rumble come to their house and build them a studio.

19:38.866 --> 19:47.772
That's not cheap That's big money being well big money relative to simple humans like you and me it's big money being thrown at these people and

19:48.352 --> 19:51.534
And in order for that to happen, you know, they have to do certain things.

19:51.614 --> 19:51.814
So.

19:52.594 --> 19:54.315
Support micro TV.

19:54.795 --> 20:02.639
It's time for our annual, our annual, our annual fundraising drive as if there's some kind of PBS news hour or something like that.

20:02.699 --> 20:10.182
Now, me on the other hand, I just want to know, want you to know that there are only a few supporters right now who are responsible for keeping the lights on here.

20:10.722 --> 20:11.883
And then about 110 people that give me $10 a month.

20:15.222 --> 20:17.523
And so we're not making money here.

20:18.003 --> 20:19.544
We're running on fumes.

20:20.065 --> 20:21.445
I'm not begging for money.

20:21.525 --> 20:35.112
I'm asking for people that appreciate what I'm doing and have the means to think about helping for a little while because we are going to eventually get to the stage where we do have our own nonprofit.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.814
And I do think at some point we're going to be able to

20:39.568 --> 20:42.109
we're gonna be able to stop asking for money in this way.

20:42.969 --> 20:44.830
But these guys are shamelessly doing it.

20:44.930 --> 20:47.710
And more importantly, these guys are all people that have jobs.

20:47.890 --> 20:58.614
They all have, many of them have tenure track positions and they're happy to take a stipend from MicroTV because they do a podcast and that's cool.

20:59.514 --> 21:00.634
That's what's happening here.

21:02.335 --> 21:03.275
And so be aware.

21:04.395 --> 21:06.679
to our quality quorum for today.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.083
I'm your host, Dr. Mark Martin.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.955
And he will say in a minute that he does it for himself.

21:15.055 --> 21:16.996
It's not for the world.

21:17.416 --> 21:27.982
He's not doing it to save the world or to teach children or to break a mythology that he thinks might be dangerous to his kids.

21:28.282 --> 21:29.043
That's what I'm doing.

21:29.063 --> 21:30.424
I don't think I'm gonna save the world.

21:30.864 --> 21:37.588
But I think we need somebody to try to seriously nudge the football because we have a serious problem on our hands because

21:38.388 --> 21:53.258
It has become very obvious to me that the assumptions that we make in academic biology are going to be the cage in which the brains, the minds, the souls of our grandchildren will be enslaved.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.281
next year and wanted a luxe selfie with a flash.

22:00.301 --> 22:02.122
So these guys are writing out their scripts.

22:02.142 --> 22:03.663
He takes it very seriously.

22:04.963 --> 22:12.866
And again, it's partly because somebody like Vincent Racaniello has convinced them that this is really a very, very important role.

22:13.466 --> 22:23.270
And Vincent Racaniello believes that he is, and he says it regularly, he titles his podcast Earth's Virology Professor.

22:25.652 --> 22:34.341
I don't, I mean, that's, that is some bold statement right there for a guy who has really done nothing but cell culture for his whole life.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.302
It's really extraordinary.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.932
They're looking for antimicrobial things.

22:45.992 --> 22:48.394
So not antiviral stuff, but antimicrobial.

22:51.314 --> 22:53.236
Oh, I still have morning eyes here.

22:53.296 --> 22:54.877
I apologize.

22:55.298 --> 23:00.363
Yeah, Pig Hooey.

23:00.783 --> 23:01.844
Pig Hooey, that's right.

23:01.884 --> 23:05.328
Pig Hooey is the one who actually got me into that.

23:06.048 --> 23:07.309
I'm just going to skip this part.

23:07.349 --> 23:08.390
You don't need to see this.

23:09.291 --> 23:34.332
um yeah pig hui is a i don't know if it's a youtube channel or whatever but she was awesome and she really did that well and think about this think about this that's five years ago she made those videos very very early because of course that documentary happened before the pandemic so someone could come out very early in 2020 and be like huh what in the heck happened here and she indeed did

23:34.972 --> 23:47.102
So this is, again, one of those things where if you don't keep looking back and keep adding things to the calendar and reminding yourself of all the things that happened and keep it straight in your head, it can very easily get lost.

23:47.202 --> 23:52.066
And, you know, I don't even remember how long a time that's been, but it is imperative.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.528
It is imperative that we preserve this history.

23:55.308 --> 24:04.358
especially the history that's still available to us, because that's one of the tricks of history that everybody, you know, casually acknowledges.

24:04.718 --> 24:11.185
Number one, the victors, the victorious right history, but number two, even the history that we're given can be

24:12.706 --> 24:14.549
you know, successive victors.

24:14.869 --> 24:25.724
So in other words, we could have had a different history available to us until let's say 1800 and then somebody became powerful behind the scenes and slowly but surely that history was changed.

24:26.405 --> 24:28.768
And it would take a lot of scholarship

24:31.556 --> 24:38.828
a lot of scholarship to figure that out, or AI provided with the right texts and programmed in the right way.

24:39.569 --> 24:44.738
But again, that's just suggesting a hypothetical way that we could use their technology against them.

24:45.863 --> 25:11.782
We could use AI to analyze the way that human knowledge has changed over time by feeding it historical books and try to see if the AI or a objectively open source AI could analyze that and point to crucial time points and crucial inflections in our perceived understanding of our world that might cue us into very

25:13.106 --> 25:24.892
Important time points in our history where these changes were made and I think quite frankly Mark Kulak stumbled on something very very interesting the other day.

25:24.912 --> 25:26.553
I think it was only yesterday.

25:26.613 --> 25:37.218
I just saw the video yesterday Today rather of the idea that Sorry, I'm stumbling around here

25:38.937 --> 25:40.739
you know, that's what you happen when you don't have a script.

25:41.239 --> 25:50.868
When Teilhard de Chardin came in and out of favor in the Catholic Church, specifically with the head honcho.

25:51.929 --> 26:02.138
And I find that a very interesting theme that we're going to come back to again all the time in the new Biology 101, because I do think that's part of the way that this

26:03.393 --> 26:19.086
this full court press has been maintained and actually even sustained and maybe even one of the most important parts of the full court press that we as young children could never have been aware of because it happened before our time.

26:20.127 --> 26:29.675
The switch in the way that the Catholic Church defended the sacred irreducible complexity of nature fundamentally changed before our birth.

26:32.148 --> 26:47.698
And it can be at least indirectly, broadly seen in some of the condemnation or lack thereof of the writings and philosophy of Desjardins by different popes.

26:47.738 --> 26:53.161
I think it's just a cool little thing that, you know, who else is doing things like that besides Mark Kulak?

26:54.482 --> 26:58.624
Okay, so I think you already see the interesting,

27:00.782 --> 27:09.528
Well, the interesting distraction you're gonna have to ignore in order to process what I want you to process, which is, I want you to process this guy as a biologist.

27:10.208 --> 27:28.400
And I want you to process this guy as a biologist who has a foundational set of ideas, which form the toolbox with which his imagination constructs his model of reality.

27:29.753 --> 27:56.616
Almost said that dead on I really am trying to convey the idea that if you gave Children the idea that birds were gods and that feeding the birds was the equivalent of the best kind of worship you could do and if you took care of the birds that everybody would be Living great and then everybody was living great and that they you know when they met other people those people just fed other birds

27:57.722 --> 28:16.653
very quickly this kind of interpretation of the world could take hold, and there could be a whole generation or two or three of people who successfully pass this interpretation on to their offspring by teaching them, as long as the teachings

28:17.728 --> 28:24.914
let's say, made accurate enough predictions about the future that it made sense to follow those ideas.

28:25.034 --> 28:31.119
And so for a lot of things, that's what's so interesting about evolution because DNA.

28:32.239 --> 28:37.604
And it is so enticing because it answers this question.

28:40.250 --> 28:56.144
that Erwin Schrodinger says, of course, just because we don't know how to explain all things with physics and chemistry, it doesn't mean that eventually we won't understand how to explain all things, including living things, with physics and chemistry.

28:56.665 --> 28:57.105
And DNA

28:58.556 --> 29:14.040
represents that chemistry, that aperiodic crystal, as this guy called it, which can bridge the gap between the sacred irreducible complexity that heretofore we just accepted as part of who we are,

29:15.643 --> 29:28.261
to something that can be dismantled and understood and harnessed and optimized by human hands because the truth has been revealed to us by God.

29:30.182 --> 29:34.584
You see, and that's where these two guys come into play.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.445
That's where this comes into play.

29:36.485 --> 29:51.871
Because if God has revealed to us evolution, because DNA, then these guys are making the argument that it's our Christian duty to take what we know and make the best of it.

29:55.185 --> 30:09.091
And it may be that some of the smartest people and the wisest people are the people who can take humankind to the next step where we evolve as a species.

30:11.673 --> 30:20.717
If you say that we all become Christ, or you say we all become gods, or we transcend God, I don't know what's the, you know, it's all different words to say different things.

30:20.777 --> 30:34.582
Now, I want you to listen to this guy and think of him as a biologist, think of him as a child, and then how he got to the stage where he is now an adult who sees the world like he describes it.

30:34.602 --> 30:36.383
And I think he's pretty good at describing it.

30:36.423 --> 30:39.604
That's why I find this such an interesting exercise.

30:42.498 --> 30:46.421
So I'm going to, of course, have to take it back a little bit and we're not going to watch the whole thing.

30:46.481 --> 30:48.103
I just want, it's just an exercise.

30:49.224 --> 30:59.932
I want you to be able to see the, and hear how people's whole, whole world is based on the assumptions.

31:01.153 --> 31:01.694
Viruses.

31:03.038 --> 31:08.229
I recently came across an article by Carl Zimmer about the social lives of viruses.

31:08.890 --> 31:11.896
That is, how they might interact with one another.

31:12.698 --> 31:13.780
Fascinating topic.

31:15.169 --> 31:19.673
So it is a genuine honor to welcome Sam Diaz-Munoz.

31:20.174 --> 31:24.058
So we're talking about how viruses socially evolve, I guess.

31:24.198 --> 31:32.085
And so I guess this guy purports to study how viruses interact and how they influence each other's evolution.

31:32.666 --> 31:39.072
And so again, the entire assumption is that all of these things are real.

31:40.908 --> 31:47.653
that synthetic DNA and RNA can be put in cell culture, so I guess we can do virology.

31:48.374 --> 32:04.686
And because all these people agree, all these departments agree, all these people that are attending this conference agree, everybody that has a poster agrees, everybody in my lab agrees, all the people that studied with him agree, all the people that studied with her agree, and all the people that studied with their mentors agree.

32:06.067 --> 32:07.829
So who the hell are these people to question?

32:12.728 --> 32:16.251
And so I just implore you, open your mind, listen.

32:16.291 --> 32:20.154
This is just so cool because I can hear myself in him.

32:21.555 --> 32:22.836
I can hear myself in him.

32:22.896 --> 32:23.876
He has a wonder.

32:25.638 --> 32:27.879
He has a wonder for what he sees around him.

32:27.919 --> 32:34.564
And then suddenly you can hear him trip up and be completely, well, I guess evolution because DNA.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.685
So that's how we do it.

32:36.686 --> 32:37.566
It's fantastic.

32:37.827 --> 32:38.147
Here we go.

32:41.604 --> 32:43.945
Sorry, I'm gonna get an, oh yeah, I can do it this way, can't I?

32:44.526 --> 32:45.246
I gotta remember that.

32:49.028 --> 33:05.498
Of the University of California Davis to the podcast to discuss the work their research group does exploring co-infection, viral genetic exchange in RNA viruses, and most importantly, building a community of researchers that study the social lives of viruses.

33:06.839 --> 33:08.440
Welcome to the Quality Quorum, Sam.

33:09.841 --> 33:10.781
Thank you so much, Mark.

33:10.882 --> 33:12.282
I really appreciate the invitation.

33:12.302 --> 33:14.263
It's an honor for me to be on the podcast.

33:14.984 --> 33:16.564
Oh, I really enjoy doing it.

33:16.584 --> 33:18.385
It's therapeutic for me, let's face it.

33:18.625 --> 33:21.127
I mean, for one, that guy works on phages.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.527
He doesn't work on viruses.

33:22.567 --> 33:29.771
But somehow or another, he's not very... I could have shown that in the beginning, but I chose not to because I didn't want to talk too much about that.

33:31.111 --> 33:43.097
It's an interesting point that somebody says there's a phage toy behind him, because actually he works on phages, which we all know that even the no-virus people like Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan acknowledge that there are definitely bacteriophages.

33:43.177 --> 33:48.460
Even Mark Bailey said, yes, there are bacteriophages when he was in the fake argument with Kevin McCarran.

33:49.561 --> 33:57.805
So it's interesting because he is very imprecise about when he's talking about phages and when he's talking about viruses, and he always says viruses.

33:59.633 --> 34:00.674
It is extraordinary.

34:00.734 --> 34:04.515
I've watched several of these shows that he's hosted.

34:04.535 --> 34:08.076
He's got like 64 or something like that now, and he's wondering if he'll make it to 100.

34:08.137 --> 34:11.298
And it is extraordinary, really.

34:13.578 --> 34:23.002
He uses the word viruses a lot, and phages very little, even though that's what he works on, and it would be more precise to describe them almost always as phages when he's talking.

34:24.009 --> 34:26.110
Um, and then there was something else.

34:26.590 --> 34:26.851
Uh, yeah.

34:26.871 --> 34:28.371
Well, anyway, let's just go on.

34:28.972 --> 34:29.752
I'm really selfish.

34:29.772 --> 34:30.913
That's why I do the podcast.

34:30.953 --> 34:39.817
It's for me, but I am delighted you're here because as I mentioned to you, I have used the Zimmer essay actually in my classes.

34:40.879 --> 34:48.545
And you've been kind enough to give some other links to other articles of interest that I'll put in the show notes that for other people who are interested.

34:49.046 --> 34:58.894
And to me, it's not a surprise because if microbes, bacteria and archaea can interact with one another in ways both positive and negative, why not viruses?

34:59.914 --> 35:04.078
And I had a little hint about that and we haven't discussed this with satellite viruses.

35:04.858 --> 35:06.340
We don't have to talk about them at all.

35:07.358 --> 35:14.320
But I think the best way to start is to kind of talk a little bit about your background in transition to microbiology.

35:15.380 --> 35:15.761
Sure.

35:16.401 --> 35:22.203
Yeah, I have what some would call a pretty unorthodox path to microbiology.

35:22.623 --> 35:24.083
I went from monkeys to monkeys.

35:24.563 --> 35:29.965
So please tell me that somebody heard him say your transition to microbiology.

35:30.105 --> 35:33.146
Please tell me somebody heard him say that.

35:41.724 --> 35:55.352
I grew up in Puerto Rico, liking to camp, liking to hike, really being around nature, being on the beach and snorkeling, diving, all that stuff.

35:55.632 --> 35:59.074
And I was very interested in animals.

36:00.035 --> 36:05.418
I, you know, I was, it was the Discovery Channel back when it actually aired, you know,

36:06.328 --> 36:07.109
real documentaries.

36:08.430 --> 36:11.212
And, and, you know, I was fascinated by all of that.

36:12.392 --> 36:23.400
And so I did know I had the experience of going to Mona Island, which is off the western coast of Puerto Rico, sometimes called the Galapagos of the Caribbean.

36:24.181 --> 36:26.803
It's, it's, it's very, it's a really amazing place.

36:26.843 --> 36:29.385
And I had the opportunity to work on some sea turtle research.

36:30.746 --> 36:41.954
And I remember I was there with Carlos Diaz, who's a longtime researcher, and sitting there on the boat and having this moment where I said, Carlos, is this your job?

36:41.974 --> 36:43.295
Do you get paid for this?

36:44.476 --> 36:45.837
And he was like, yeah, I'm a biologist.

36:45.857 --> 36:46.517
This is what I do.

36:46.577 --> 36:47.938
And that's when the light bulb went off.

36:48.158 --> 36:51.060
And then I really wanted to pursue biology.

36:52.541 --> 36:56.064
So I studied my bachelor's at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez.

36:56.772 --> 37:04.000
on the West Coast, and then there became interested in animal behavior through some internships as well.

37:05.107 --> 37:10.691
research experience for undergraduates, which if there are undergraduates listening, please look those programs up.

37:10.871 --> 37:11.731
They are amazing.

37:11.951 --> 37:17.715
My intro bio teacher told me, look up these experiences, you get paid, you do research, have a fabulous summer.

37:18.095 --> 37:18.896
And I did too.

37:19.496 --> 37:21.257
Went to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.

37:21.537 --> 37:27.101
Shout out to Linda Schaffner for giving me the opportunity with my questionable essay and application.

37:28.041 --> 37:33.104
But yeah, and the other one at the Colorado Boulder at the Mountain Research Station.

37:34.721 --> 37:39.348
And then I went to Cal Berkeley to study animal behavior.

37:39.368 --> 37:41.011
I worked in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology.

37:41.031 --> 37:48.583
And yeah, I was advised by Dr. Leslie Lacy, was a fantastic mentor, showed me

37:49.955 --> 37:51.516
science from the beginning to the end.

37:51.816 --> 37:54.538
I had a very, again, atypical grad student experience.

37:54.638 --> 38:01.282
I, you know, was taught how to fund my projects, how to come up with my projects, you know, from a very early moment.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.144
And so this involves chasing monkeys through the forest.

38:05.165 --> 38:08.347
But not for any reason.

38:08.927 --> 38:12.470
The reason I was very interested in cooperative male parental care.

38:14.066 --> 38:25.192
I was interested basically in, I think, the unifying theme in all of my research, which is hard because it's pretty varied, is how do interactions between individuals affect reproduction.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.761
which is which is sort of that social component.

38:30.122 --> 38:44.049
And so in the field that I was trained in behavioral ecology, which is a subset of animal behavior, we basically assume that the and we should try to test that behavior has some genetic basis, right?

38:44.229 --> 38:49.432
And that if an interaction leads to higher fitness, you know, basically, you

38:50.697 --> 38:56.921
give more offspring out, you produce more offspring, that is, that then that behavior should be favored, right?

38:57.081 --> 39:12.552
And so I think one thing that I want to emphasize is that when I studied animals, the whole disciplinary framework and the theoretical framework, in fact, the mathematical, when I say theoretical, I mean, there's some serious math behind this.

39:13.867 --> 39:23.732
did not really ascribe any cognition or communication or intention to the animals, which people can think because they're animals.

39:24.333 --> 39:32.337
We basically assume that, you know, what, what is, we basically assume that animals were sort of bags of genes, and that they took actions and stuff.

39:32.977 --> 39:37.539
But but we're really counting the genes and seeing what happened as a result of those actions, right.

39:37.899 --> 39:40.941
So that's really the basis of the field.

39:41.855 --> 39:43.436
Okay, so how's that?

39:46.177 --> 39:48.277
Behavior has a genetic component.

39:49.058 --> 39:49.678
Does this work?

39:49.718 --> 39:52.159
Yeah, so behavior has a genetic component.

39:53.179 --> 39:54.380
That's the assumption they make.

39:54.560 --> 39:59.021
Actually, then at the end, you know, selection would then act on the genes.

39:59.061 --> 40:03.523
But at the end, he says the math is done based on the idea that they're a bag of genes.

40:06.522 --> 40:10.465
And so what he's doing is what all these biologists do.

40:10.545 --> 40:12.006
They take a bunch of animals.

40:13.847 --> 40:21.132
They separate them using some, you know, here's all the animals that he collects, all the males that are raising animals, right?

40:21.392 --> 40:22.132
Raising babies.

40:23.533 --> 40:28.517
And he collects all of these and he takes all their genes and he makes a big map of them.

40:28.537 --> 40:31.799
And he gets a map for each monkey.

40:32.779 --> 40:39.743
And then he tries to see if he says, oh, well, these guys all had five babies and they interacted with each other.

40:39.803 --> 40:44.025
And these guys all had five babies and they didn't interact with each other.

40:44.605 --> 40:46.486
And then tries to separate them.

40:46.906 --> 40:48.567
Two arbitrary groups are made.

40:49.367 --> 40:56.051
And then he sees if they can find any correlations between, you know, the groups.

40:56.271 --> 40:58.312
In other words, did they get lucky?

40:59.534 --> 41:24.593
Did they select the right 12 monkeys over here and the right 12 monkeys over here so that when they go over here and look in the genes, there's some kind of segregation on GABA receptors or some kind of segregation on a subtype of AMPA receptors so that they can say, look in the brain, synaptic genes are selected against when animals don't sociologically and the genes are found in the brain and the brain's responsible for social behavior.

41:26.254 --> 41:27.856
This is how ham-fisted it is.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.707
And it all starts with the idea that this is just evolution.

41:32.348 --> 41:39.051
He worked at Cal Berkeley at the Museum of Vertebrate Biology, chasing monkeys to look for cooperative male parental care.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.311
And what did he say?

41:40.351 --> 41:52.977
I had a very atypical graduate experience because I was taught how to frame my question and write my grants very early, which means that he was told how the system works.

41:56.656 --> 42:04.878
He was given an insight into how you can use the argument of evolution because DNA to get lots of money.

42:05.358 --> 42:14.201
We want to look for genes that segregate with behavior that are interesting to the overclass, like parental behavior, like male cooperation.

42:16.673 --> 42:25.137
And so we're gonna do monkey studies in the wild that look for genes that are associated with monkey cooperation or monkey evolutionary success.

42:25.177 --> 42:26.698
Do you see what we're dealing with here?

42:30.520 --> 42:35.783
He doesn't know any better because he has been brought up to understand the world in this way.

42:35.843 --> 42:45.448
And his imagination is powerful as it is after having grown up camping and scuba diving and surfing and whatever else he said he did, hiking.

42:49.980 --> 43:02.288
And so like me, like I was, it's very easy to be trapped in that world where all this stuff makes sense because evolution is real and DNA explains it all.

43:03.749 --> 43:19.379
And the Human Genome Project is probably the biggest crack in the armor that if we understand what happened and didn't happen, what was accomplished and what wasn't accomplished, and understand it as well as we possibly can, I think that is going to set our kids free.

43:20.913 --> 43:31.900
It's not a small task, because of course there are layers of people, layers of curtains, and we're all on the outside of it.

43:33.901 --> 43:42.987
And people have been coming out and pretending that they're, you know, crusading against this, you know, or fighting against it, or know what's behind the curtain for a long time, and we've been believing them.

43:44.648 --> 43:48.511
So this is going to be a long, long, arduous process to get us out of this.

43:53.213 --> 43:53.874
But we're going to do it.

43:57.136 --> 44:00.418
OK, so how do we get to microbes?

44:00.758 --> 44:09.124
Oh, by the way, if you're interested in what type of monkeys I was studying, which I think even though this is a microbial, can I sneak in a macro here?

44:09.604 --> 44:09.844
Sure.

44:09.864 --> 44:14.247
Yeah, as you can see on this slide, I studied tamarin monkeys.

44:16.398 --> 44:22.601
And they are, there's not really a scale in that picture, but they are about squirrel size.

44:22.741 --> 44:29.724
They are tiny, but they have fascinating, fascinating social lives, which you can read about.

44:30.625 --> 44:33.066
But how do we get to, how do I?

44:33.286 --> 44:38.568
I mean, to Solar Fire's point, it can't be always the survival of the fittest.

44:38.628 --> 44:41.850
If you just do the simple math of evolution in your head,

44:43.601 --> 44:52.424
There would have to be necessarily lots and lots of single examples of incredibly good genetic something or other that never gets passed on.

44:57.585 --> 45:08.729
How many examples have we been given in film of idiot savants, they used to be called, where people are very socially inept, very, very socially inept.

45:09.961 --> 45:18.885
and almost handicapped, but have some gift like in music or gift in math or gift in memory.

45:21.566 --> 45:26.128
And this inevitably doesn't result in a whole, you know,

45:27.776 --> 45:46.312
It doesn't result in a whole bloodline of people who become progressively better at doing dates on a calendar or become progressively better at every possible aspect of music or go atonal because those traits don't get passed on, because those people don't have kids.

45:47.533 --> 45:48.654
And that happens a lot.

45:50.848 --> 45:53.189
where even if they have kids, their kids get killed.

45:53.910 --> 45:58.913
We're not talking about now, where almost everybody's kids live to have kids.

45:58.973 --> 46:03.956
And so we have this opposite kind of evolution, lack of evolution, lack of selection.

46:05.037 --> 46:10.380
But in the old days, you could have plenty of great kids and half of them could die of disease.

46:10.820 --> 46:13.702
Half of them could die of, I don't know,

46:15.009 --> 46:18.754
getting killed in a battle, getting robbed and killed.

46:18.814 --> 46:22.819
I don't know what happened back then, but it wasn't like today.

46:22.839 --> 46:25.943
I'm not saying people were eaten by velociraptors, but you know.

46:30.168 --> 46:34.590
And I don't remember why I was saying this, but it will come back to it.

46:35.611 --> 46:37.451
Google Scholar came out when I was in grad school.

46:38.232 --> 46:40.033
And so I had keyword searches.

46:40.153 --> 46:42.374
I would search for cooperation, evolution of cooperation.

46:42.754 --> 46:45.575
Most of the time I would get theoretical papers.

46:45.755 --> 46:46.556
And touche.

46:46.796 --> 46:47.996
I mean, that's it.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.937
You see, I'm still trapped in it as well.

46:50.017 --> 46:52.118
Thank you for making that point, Soothspider.

46:52.178 --> 46:53.239
It's absolutely true.

46:53.999 --> 46:55.340
There you had me arguing.

46:55.360 --> 47:00.064
I was arguing again, but then also using the model of inheritance.

47:01.365 --> 47:04.328
But that's where we need to get with this new biology.

47:04.368 --> 47:20.502
We need to somehow have a way of arming our imagination with the ability to understand the concept of inheritance without falling victim to the enticing belief that

47:21.465 --> 47:44.254
because there seems to be a lot of evidence for inheritance that that process might be something that we could take over or influence in a way that wouldn't be malevolent, dangerous, disrespectful to the sacred biology that's been given to us.

47:44.294 --> 47:45.715
That's, I think, a great point.

47:45.795 --> 47:46.095
Thank you.

47:48.390 --> 47:52.593
I would get something about different animal societies, stuff like that.

47:53.613 --> 48:05.941
And then, around the, you know, the aughts, 2000 somethings, I started getting hits for papers that are about bacteria.

48:08.142 --> 48:10.303
And I was immediately skeptical, I have to say.

48:10.624 --> 48:15.066
So so I, I was not a microbial convert at that point.

48:15.267 --> 48:15.287
I

48:17.381 --> 48:25.406
I thought microbes, the way, I unfortunately did not have a wonderful microbiology teacher like you in university.

48:27.148 --> 48:30.110
I did not, I thought microbes were in the lab.

48:31.190 --> 48:33.132
That was sort of my conception.

48:33.632 --> 48:43.839
And so one of the things that I'm trying to allude to what's happening here and what Microbe TV does is that they blur the line very well

48:44.744 --> 49:04.758
and very hard, they're focused on blurring this line that I'm trying to establish as a hard line, where there are things that could be characterized as pattern integrities, and then there are things that are not pattern integrities, and things that are not pattern integrities can only be produced by pattern integrities.

49:04.858 --> 49:10.102
They can't be something that exists on their own and evolves on its own.

49:11.658 --> 49:16.362
And in that context, then, there's no such thing as a molecular pathogen.

49:18.963 --> 49:27.870
And they are trying to blur the line between bacteria and these RNA pathogens that they call viruses.

49:28.610 --> 49:36.917
They're trying to blur the line between the known part of the pattern integrity of bacteria that is the phage,

49:37.841 --> 49:51.551
They're trying to blur that also as a evidence of this pathological pattern integrities outside of bacteria and us and all this other stuff that can be very easily qualified as a pattern integrity.

49:51.591 --> 49:53.192
It's like, you know it when you see it.

49:54.693 --> 49:56.694
We can work hard to try and define it.

49:56.714 --> 50:00.197
And I think that's one of the fundamental sort of first

50:01.465 --> 50:24.798
first order tasks at hand with regard to redefining a new biology 101 is to really adequately bring people to be able to understand what a pattern integrity is and give them enough of a understanding of it so that their imagination can always apply a screen and immediately go, yeah, that qualifies, that doesn't, that qualifies, that doesn't.

50:27.372 --> 50:34.915
And that's the trick here, because once we get to that stage, then we can start to already then apply that as we move forward.

50:36.716 --> 50:38.817
And we'll start with a completely different outlook.

50:38.857 --> 50:43.159
I really think it's a absolutely shoe-in.

50:43.179 --> 50:44.139
I mean, we can do it.

50:45.060 --> 50:49.962
And even people like this guy can be, at least from the biological perspective, awakened.

50:51.047 --> 50:57.329
If their paycheck depends on them not being awakened though, eh, you know, I've said this before and I will say it again.

50:57.349 --> 51:14.473
I had just arranged at the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 or end of 2019, I had just arranged to have like a quarter million dollars worth of equipment freely donated to me while, you know, given to me on endless loan.

51:15.693 --> 51:15.833
Um,

51:16.610 --> 51:34.757
from a company in Germany that co-organized some of the computer equipment to be loaned to me from Harvard so that I could build a setup like I had in the Netherlands or like I had in Norway and do the experiments that I was doing there here in Pittsburgh.

51:35.357 --> 51:44.181
And if they would have just let me keep working instead of sent me home or, you know, tried to make me go downstairs to the front door and go through the front door and

51:45.074 --> 51:50.578
get my temperature taken like I was supposed to, I would have probably never been here.

51:51.378 --> 51:52.699
I'd still be there right now.

51:54.140 --> 52:01.084
And I don't know, if I was put to the task of having to take the vaccine or not for my job, I probably would have quit then.

52:02.965 --> 52:08.109
But it would have been a very different world, a very different place, and I would have had a very different idea of what was going on.

52:08.549 --> 52:13.572
And I wouldn't have cared a lick about what was going on with the virus, because I was allowed to go to work anyway.

52:14.761 --> 52:16.127
and I loved my work.

52:23.154 --> 52:46.115
I don't know, if this guy loves his work, if he loves his colleagues, if he has a good time, if there's a social network that's there that everybody agrees we're doing important stuff or fun stuff or interesting stuff and then they go and discuss it with other people and they say it's interesting and they go to the same meetings and they all get to go out to dinner together and take group photos at the table.

52:51.937 --> 52:56.401
We've got to break the kids of it before they're already this deep.

52:56.481 --> 53:01.185
That people who studied microbes didn't have anything to do with nature.

53:01.545 --> 53:09.312
And so I had sort of separated those things early on in my training and sort of wasn't aware or interested in it.

53:10.393 --> 53:13.415
And so that's where my skepticism came from.

53:13.435 --> 53:14.616
I'm like, well, what is this?

53:17.085 --> 53:21.346
But the other thing that happened, so but these papers were published in high profile journals.

53:21.366 --> 53:32.329
So of course, I was, you know, curious, and then started looking more into it, and then found a whole tradition of, of people using microbes as study systems to study evolution, right?

53:32.349 --> 53:38.211
So then stumble upon the Lenski experiment, right, all that stumble across.

53:39.513 --> 53:48.913
Bruce Levin's work, so many people, and I find out that there are so many people who have made this transition from studying macros at one point and then finding out, oh,

53:50.256 --> 53:51.857
Minecrafts are actually amazing.

53:51.877 --> 54:03.783
And so one of the assumptions that you can hear here, and just for the sake of the exercise that we're trying to do, I'm trying to bring you to work your, get your mind around hearing it and seeing it.

54:03.903 --> 54:08.826
And so I'm going to play that back again, just to make sure I get the right part of this clip.

54:10.306 --> 54:12.087
I want that.

54:12.348 --> 54:12.948
Oh yeah, sorry.

54:12.968 --> 54:13.628
I got to resume.

54:14.869 --> 54:16.730
For studying evolution and ecology.

54:17.922 --> 54:18.582
Can I stop you?

54:18.602 --> 54:25.526
I found a whole tradition of people using microbes as study systems to study evolution, right?

54:25.566 --> 54:29.228
So then the StumbleUpon-Bolinski experiment, right?

54:29.388 --> 54:33.850
All that, Stumble across Bruce Levin's work.

54:34.150 --> 54:35.051
So many people.

54:35.471 --> 54:47.297
And I find out that there are so many people who have made this transition from studying microbes at one point and then finding out, oh, microbes are actually amazing for studying evolution and ecology.

54:48.656 --> 55:12.181
And so that bridge is huge because that's, of course, the bridge that is enabled by evolution because DNA and enabled by the idea that if we start here under the assumption that even though we don't have the tools now, we will eventually be able to explain life through a combination of physics and chemistry.

55:14.815 --> 55:16.236
Evolution because DNA.

55:16.296 --> 55:28.905
Now he's talking very clearly about how this has influenced his understanding of things to the point where he's created a whole career based on assumptions.

55:29.925 --> 55:41.253
Based on assumptions that the social biology and the evolution of bacteria, the way that bacteria change over time,

55:43.021 --> 55:52.583
is a direct homologue of how the human species would change over time, how monkeys change over time, how it's all the same.

55:52.643 --> 55:54.543
It's just on different timescales.

55:56.284 --> 56:08.526
And what this does is completely discounts the irreducible complexity that may not be present at the level of a bacteria, even though bacteria may be a pattern integrity of sorts.

56:10.464 --> 56:14.885
It's clearly not a pattern integrity with the same level of complication that a mammal is.

56:16.286 --> 56:23.148
And even this part of the new biology 101 is missing from the bad biology 101.

56:24.588 --> 56:35.812
Just heard him say it, that he's fine with moving from monkeys to bacteria because he can study the exact same principles on a much smaller and more tractable scale.

56:38.280 --> 56:42.202
So does he see the irreducible complexity of the monkeys that he was studying?

56:43.563 --> 56:44.344
Of course he doesn't.

56:45.724 --> 57:01.473
And he doesn't see it because evolution, because DNA, because when they start by explaining it to you in high school as molecules and cells and tissues, and they build from the bottom up, you're unable to see that

57:03.993 --> 57:18.206
That's like introducing you to the fine art of Formula One car racing by first teaching you about tires, and then about wheels, and then about axles, and then about steering wheels.

57:21.349 --> 57:25.673
I mean, it's not explaining how we got there.

57:25.833 --> 57:28.796
It's not bringing you to understand what was involved.

57:32.352 --> 57:34.935
and it takes out the irreducible complexity of it.

57:34.975 --> 57:45.926
There's no way to put into a textbook how we got from finding fire as a pretty useful thing to know how to create, to being able to build a Formula One car.

57:49.793 --> 58:05.100
And there's going to be no useful way to get from the rudimentary, ridiculous understanding of the irreducible complexity of biology as evolution because that's not going to get us anywhere for the very simple fact that it's an assumption.

58:05.240 --> 58:11.522
It is not a proven, you know, evidential fact of reality.

58:12.403 --> 58:17.525
But all of academic biology functions under that pretense.

58:20.402 --> 58:31.332
eyes to the listeners and viewers that we've said several times on this podcast that when you bring in and I call it different faces and voices, but it can be disciplinary as well.

58:31.853 --> 58:32.834
You can get two

58:35.350 --> 58:37.693
narrow in your views in a particular area.

58:37.753 --> 58:43.460
This is what I think you suffered from in your own microbiology course, if you don't mind my saying.

58:44.161 --> 58:50.389
However, what I find is when people come to a field from outside of it, they bring new interesting questions.

58:51.360 --> 59:01.448
look at the way that molecular biology was essentially fertilized by a large number of quantum physicists and created the field of what you and I would call molecular biology today.

59:01.789 --> 59:02.169
What?

59:02.649 --> 59:03.730
Did you hear that?

59:04.731 --> 59:06.493
How's that for spectacular?

59:07.173 --> 59:16.815
Because that's also what happened in neurobiology during my time, almost 20 years of chasing tenure, was that neurobiology became neuroscience.

59:16.875 --> 59:23.456
And the main way that it became neuroscience was bringing in physicists and mathematicians to make models.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.557
Holy cow.

59:30.317 --> 59:34.718
That is, that is, that is amazing.

59:35.538 --> 59:35.798
Okay.

59:37.284 --> 59:46.331
He just told you what we were just talking about, that microbiology was founded by physicists that were left over from the Manhattan Project.

59:46.471 --> 59:50.414
Thank you very much, Housatonic Live, Mark Kulak.

59:50.575 --> 59:56.379
You see, I can repeat that clip for sure, my friend.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:14.330
So, in fact, you mentioned people like Bruce Levin and one of my... There are so many people who've made this transition from studying microbes at one point and then finding out, oh, microbes are actually amazing for studying evolution and ecology.

01:00:15.536 --> 01:00:29.442
Can I stop you for just a second because I want to emphasize to the listeners and viewers that we've said several times on this podcast that when you bring in, and I call it different faces and voices, but it can be disciplinary as well.

01:00:29.962 --> 01:00:30.943
You can get two

01:00:33.456 --> 01:00:35.798
narrow in your views in a particular area.

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:41.563
This is what I think you suffered from in your own microbiology course, if you don't mind my saying.

01:00:42.283 --> 01:00:48.509
However, what I find is when people come to a field from outside of it, they bring new interesting questions.

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:59.498
Look at the way that molecular biology was essentially fertilized by a large number of quantum physicists and created the field of what you and I would call molecular biology today.

01:01:00.572 --> 01:01:06.398
So in fact, you mentioned people like Bruce Levin and one of my personal microbial heroes, Rich Lenski.

01:01:06.879 --> 01:01:13.546
They were not trained as microbiologists, but they learned to use microbes to answer the questions that interested them.

01:01:14.247 --> 01:01:19.072
So I want to emphasize again, different faces and different voices really matter.

01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:25.514
happens in the lab, it matters in the lab, it matters in society, of course, and we see evidence of it every day.

01:01:25.854 --> 01:01:46.060
So we are here where we are today because, I assume Mark is not here, we are here because physicists have enabled us to rely on the false assumption that we are going to

01:01:47.443 --> 01:01:53.705
be able to explain all of life with a combination of physics and chemistry, and therefore we're going to be able to model it.

01:01:53.765 --> 01:01:55.045
We're going to be able to use math.

01:01:57.366 --> 01:02:08.869
That enticing illusion is what has allowed our almost complete enslavement by the mythology of viruses and public health.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:11.670
And that's where we are.

01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:13.591
It's fantabulous.

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:34.099
The Human Genome Project, it's all, and the Special Cancer Virus Program, and the Manhattan Project, and nuclear bombs, and I mean, it's all one big, it's all one big mythology that they have governed us with for a couple generations now, maybe many more generations.

01:02:34.139 --> 01:02:34.960
That's the point.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.844
And so like I started the thing with, you know, if they take you behind the curtain, one of the ways they can take you behind the curtain is tell you some of this biology.

01:02:48.587 --> 01:02:53.751
and tell you how it's, you know, we understand that it's not, you know, but here's how the game is played.

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:54.332
Here you go.

01:02:54.432 --> 01:02:55.813
We'll make you chair of this.

01:02:55.853 --> 01:02:57.014
We'll make you chair of that.

01:02:57.514 --> 01:02:58.935
And they can easily do this.

01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:03.539
They have done this and they have been doing it for a while because they have mentors.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.202
The mentors can screen these people over years.

01:03:09.504 --> 01:03:11.145
This guy's clearly not a threat.

01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:12.326
They can give him tenure.

01:03:17.278 --> 01:03:19.359
And it's not to say that he's a bad guy.

01:03:19.419 --> 01:03:21.180
It's not to say that he's a good guy.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.181
It's not to say that he's smart or dumb.

01:03:23.742 --> 01:03:37.569
It's to say that when groups of people get together with a very common shared set of ideas, you know, if they can make you believe absurdities, then they can also get you to commit atrocities.

01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:40.651
Is that Voltaire?

01:03:46.946 --> 01:03:49.569
And you're just showing me yet another example in your own life.

01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.152
Yeah, no, I, I 100% agree.

01:03:53.232 --> 01:04:04.843
I think diversity is just, uh, uh, from a, from a disciplinary perspective and from a conceptual perspective is really important in biology, but it's also important in science and in the enterprise of science.

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:10.709
And I think that is, that is, um, one thing that, that has been.

01:04:11.869 --> 01:04:14.270
really made my career very interesting.

01:04:17.032 --> 01:04:22.935
Okay, now, no reason other than I think I want to get going and keep this moving, so I'm going to do the next video really quick.

01:04:22.955 --> 01:04:25.716
This is the video from Bloomberg Originals.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:29.518
You can find these Bloomberg Originals on YouTube and elsewhere.

01:04:29.618 --> 01:04:30.899
They're very highly produced.

01:04:31.419 --> 01:04:33.340
They have a different host.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.363
I'm watching one about the new biology or breaking the rules of biology.

01:04:39.403 --> 01:04:40.263
We're just going to watch it.

01:04:40.283 --> 01:04:41.384
I'm going to try not to stop it.

01:04:42.365 --> 01:05:04.581
But keep in mind, one of the reasons why I chose to watch this is because another host of another series on Bloomberg Originals that's covering AI is actually Hannah Fry, who, thanks to the chat, I remember now is a tip that I was given or found or led to by a person by the name of Pig Hui.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:10.286
And you can find that set of videos where, again, Hazelmere!

01:05:10.426 --> 01:05:11.067
Hazelmere!

01:05:11.387 --> 01:05:12.909
Did anybody ever put that in the chat?

01:05:12.949 --> 01:05:14.050
I think it's called Hazelmere.

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:24.520
Hazelmere in the UK, before the pandemic, did a BBC documentary where they simulated an epidemic in the town using a phone app.

01:05:24.981 --> 01:05:25.901
And then the

01:05:26.942 --> 01:05:28.784
the outbreak of COVID happened there as well.

01:05:29.864 --> 01:05:33.167
Anyway, this video is a part of that series.

01:05:34.828 --> 01:05:38.971
And this one has a different host, but it's a creepy video.

01:05:40.232 --> 01:05:42.413
A lot of the video is nonsense.

01:05:42.573 --> 01:05:46.536
And so I wanna say what I think is nonsense right away.

01:05:49.498 --> 01:05:51.160
Obviously, that's not a very great title.

01:05:52.321 --> 01:05:54.182
There are some things we take for granted.

01:05:55.143 --> 01:05:57.304
Life is finite and organic.

01:05:59.325 --> 01:06:06.949
But what if everything we know about being human, from how we come into the world to how we departed, were about to be radically transformed?

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:13.593
New ways of creating life that move baby-making into the lab, defying the laws of reproduction.

01:06:13.673 --> 01:06:14.773
That's not real.

01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:16.034
That was funny, though.

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:21.517
Once incurable diseases cured using digital replicas of our bodies that copy us right down to our cells.

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:28.285
And as we confront the inevitability of death, the promise of digital eternity beckons.

01:06:29.928 --> 01:06:36.840
We find ourselves on the brink of a future where the very essence of what it means to live and die may change forever.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:53.725
So first of all, I think it's important to see that all the hosts they choose are very okay with really long, dramatic shots of themselves being used as part of the documentary.

01:06:53.765 --> 01:07:00.570
Now, obviously I'm on screen all the time, so you could make that argument about me in theory, but I'm live.

01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:06.174
I'm, you know, varying degrees of clean.

01:07:06.854 --> 01:07:07.795
And more importantly,

01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:11.727
There's not a dramatic pause here.

01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:13.308
I'm not going in slow motion.

01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:17.029
I'm not wearing, you know, I'm goofing.

01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:26.431
So for me, I see the same thing with the Michaels lady that I've looked at before.

01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:32.132
I see the same thing with a lot of the people that are in the purported health freedom movement.

01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:39.394
There are people who don't mind the spotlight, don't mind the, you know, notoriety.

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:47.490
And then there are other people that are in that movement that long ago just were tired of it and wanted out.

01:07:48.684 --> 01:08:07.368
And I actually, after five years of being a part of this and running into the walls that I've run into, can much, much, much more easily empathize with the people that have decided that they're done, that they put in their time, they did their appearances, and they gave their talks.

01:08:11.735 --> 01:08:13.416
The people that were going to hear them are going to hear them.

01:08:13.436 --> 01:08:14.716
They need to get on with their lives.

01:08:15.397 --> 01:08:26.402
And then there are other people who decided that they could make or are going to make a pretty lucrative life speaking out against this.

01:08:26.462 --> 01:08:29.844
Not necessarily winning, but speaking out against it.

01:08:29.884 --> 01:08:34.806
And I think that's what bothers me most here.

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:51.746
is that what we're really working against is the combination of this extremely elaborate exaggeration about what's to come and what's already here and blurring the lines between, you know, implications and mythologies.

01:08:51.806 --> 01:09:01.592
Like, you know, if they said, you know, X, Y, and Z, therefore A, B, and C, and that therefore is completely wrong,

01:09:03.275 --> 01:09:28.572
Then they can tell one kind of story and that's the kind of story that they have often told about this stuff Like X Y & Z being being evolution because DNA and then all these other things Well, then there must be genes for autism then there must be genes for Alzheimer's disease And if it's not that then they must inherit something else maybe they they inherit a protein that misfolds, you know, I mean I

01:09:31.826 --> 01:09:41.370
little improvising there, maybe that's a little ham-fisted, but I need people to understand how far away we are from solid ground in this bad biology.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:50.975
We are very far, much farther away than I ever imagined, even though I did have a gut feeling that looking for genes for a lot of these things was a cop-out.

01:09:54.918 --> 01:10:02.019
Reproduction is being unbound from biology's old rules, expanding the paths to parenthood in ways you wouldn't believe.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.821
The first major technology that disrupted what we know of reproduction was IVF.

01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:15.182
Now, IVG, or in vitro gametogenesis, has created possibilities far beyond what IVF offered.

01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:20.123
The possibility to turn any cell in your body into a sperm or an egg.

01:10:21.724 --> 01:10:27.508
My first introduction to IVG was from the person who developed the technology, Shinya Yamanake.

01:10:31.591 --> 01:10:38.997
He, at that time, had told me that it could be possible to change a skin cell into a sperm or egg cell.

01:10:39.437 --> 01:10:44.521
I thought it was going to be really far into the future, and I was surprised at how quickly we're at this discussion now.

01:10:46.465 --> 01:10:48.146
Development now is dynamic.

01:10:48.206 --> 01:10:49.346
It's not just one way.

01:10:49.706 --> 01:10:56.589
You can take normal cells like a blood cell or a brain cell that are fully committed to just.

01:10:56.729 --> 01:11:03.191
Now, in the same sense that I tried to express earlier, that people are using bacteria to model.

01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:15.195
To model processes as homologous to what they say are processes that happen and higher order pattern integrities.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:33.504
And a very similar thing can be seen in this kind of a video where the line between what animal they're using or what model they're using in order to achieve what they claim they're achieving and how easily we can move up the chain of complexity and continue to achieve that.

01:11:35.445 --> 01:11:42.832
One rudimentary example of this might be that the cuckoo clock that I have upstairs that was made in Philadelphia in 1924 is sufficiently

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:50.857
complex that my kid would probably only break it.

01:11:50.977 --> 01:12:04.042
But if I went in there and was careful, I might be able to troubleshoot some things that weren't working right and fix them, including make the bird peep again or make the wheels turn better or this kind of thing.

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:11.704
But I would have no hope of opening this watch and fixing its automatic movement.

01:12:12.365 --> 01:12:13.665
No hope of doing that.

01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:22.610
And so everything that I understood about the clock upstairs, some of those same principles might be at work inside of this watch.

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:30.035
But because this watch is smaller and it has other things going on and it does things in other ways, it winds itself, whatever.

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:35.818
Then there are things that I can't do here, even though I know everything about the cuckoo clock upstairs.

01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:37.739
And they do the same thing.

01:12:37.779 --> 01:12:40.181
They keep track of time and display it with hands.

01:12:43.177 --> 01:13:05.408
And so in biology, there are lots of times where they're going to be able to do rudimentary experiments with cuckoo clocks and claim that they understand how time is kept, but they aren't going to be able to tell you squat about the Swiss watches that everybody wants to understand, claims to understand, because they understand how a broken cuckoo clock makes noise.

01:13:09.032 --> 01:13:22.356
And these are inadequate analogies, but they're analogies that are starting to get closer to trying to express the point of what happens in these various biological circles where you get all these ideas going.

01:13:22.396 --> 01:13:27.517
That's the same thing with regard to, I don't know where the book is now, because they're all mixed up.

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:28.357
I moved them all around.

01:13:28.918 --> 01:13:30.198
But with regard to prions.

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:51.219
prions are almost entirely based on protein folding and protein-based signals in bacteria and yeast and assumed to be homologs of the stuff that happens in Krausfeld-Jacobs disease.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.162
And that assumption fuels the entire field

01:13:57.756 --> 01:14:00.758
That assumption is made because somebody was given a Nobel Prize.

01:14:00.838 --> 01:14:04.059
Curiously enough, a very good friend of Hilary Koprowski.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:16.906
And so what we're seeing here now is the blurring of the line for the average Joe, the average YouTube user, and making it

01:14:17.782 --> 01:14:37.790
likely that they will assume that, well, if they can do it with cuckoo clocks and with quartz clocks bought from Target, then I guess they can probably fix the smallest watches, or they can fix a train watch from the 1900s.

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.471
You know, this is a bad analogy, but you get my point.

01:14:41.468 --> 01:14:42.569
I hope you get my point.

01:14:42.689 --> 01:14:48.534
If you've ever taken apart a cuckoo clock and fixed it, which I have, it's not that complicated of a device.

01:14:48.634 --> 01:14:57.341
And the parts are so big and the way that they turn and interface together and how easy you can see it, there are lots of things you can troubleshoot.

01:14:58.022 --> 01:15:04.568
You can put oil in the right places and stuff like that, but fooling around on a real watch is not something you can do.

01:15:05.632 --> 01:15:20.098
And so I implore you to understand that they can use synthetic DNA and RNA and play around with cell cultures and create all kinds of model systems that they claim are homologous in many ways to ourselves.

01:15:20.298 --> 01:15:21.919
And stop lying.

01:15:22.099 --> 01:15:23.099
This is wrong.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:32.083
It's not to say that we're not learning something about bacteria from that guy's experiments, but we're not learning anything about ourselves.

01:15:33.544 --> 01:15:42.351
We're not learning anything about evolution because DNA, and we're not testing anything with regard to evolution because DNA.

01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:46.715
We are fundamentally starting on that assumption and then working as though, what?

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:52.660
The math is applied as if we are a bag of genes.

01:15:57.864 --> 01:15:59.366
And so that's what you see here.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.471
the idea that we are a bag of jeans.

01:16:02.551 --> 01:16:07.513
And so anything that we learn from any other bag of jeans can be applied to this bag of jeans.

01:16:08.014 --> 01:16:10.135
Your kid is just a bag of jeans in the end.

01:16:13.296 --> 01:16:16.498
Doing one thing and then say, you can go back to school.

01:16:16.658 --> 01:16:23.221
You can go back up the chain, become developmentally something much younger, a stem cell, and then go down a different path.

01:16:24.756 --> 01:16:27.619
Stem cells are like blank pages that can be rewritten.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:34.387
In the case of IVG, they take a new path to become reproductive cells, the building blocks to make a baby.

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:37.530
All of these technologies are unnatural.

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:39.472
Chemotherapy is unnatural.

01:16:40.093 --> 01:16:41.574
Eyeglasses are unnatural.

01:16:42.495 --> 01:16:43.316
It's not natural.

01:16:43.336 --> 01:16:44.578
So do you see how they do it?

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:50.674
Unnatural defines a broad spectrum of things.

01:16:50.794 --> 01:16:56.297
And, you know, because those are things are unnatural, then these unnatural things are fine.

01:16:56.958 --> 01:17:00.340
It's no more, no more dangerous than eyeglasses.

01:17:01.841 --> 01:17:02.561
Stop lying.

01:17:03.001 --> 01:17:06.783
I mean, that's some, that's some incredible, that's some incredible stuff right there.

01:17:06.803 --> 01:17:08.284
Unnatural versus unnatural.

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:13.127
For me, it's ethically unnatural or unethically unnatural.

01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:14.208
It's all unnatural.

01:17:17.563 --> 01:17:17.823
Wow.

01:17:17.843 --> 01:17:17.943
Wow.

01:17:37.409 --> 01:17:40.671
And so it's always framed as a societal problem.

01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:51.557
There are these few kids that have Angelman's disease, and Angelman's disease can be, you know, traced to a specific gene being screwed up.

01:17:52.538 --> 01:18:06.546
And so because Angelman syndrome kids are kind of sort of like socially disabled, and so they're kind of like other disorders, and this one has a gene, then I guess everything has a gene.

01:18:08.894 --> 01:18:23.299
It's the same, it's the same bait and switch illusion, whatever you want to call it, that they start on this assumption and there's a whole, you know, bouquet of reasons why reality is the way it is.

01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:29.861
And they say, well, I guess we're just going to see what brand of tires they raced with and assume that race cars are race tires.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.742
And if they chose the wrong brand, then that's the reason why they lost.

01:18:34.762 --> 01:18:36.523
We're not going to worry about anything else.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.361
Just what tires they're having.

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:43.363
I mean, again, not great analogies, but I'm just pulling them out of the air.

01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:49.586
For that person who doesn't make their own gametes to have a baby that's biologically related to them.

01:18:50.006 --> 01:18:50.466
AB mark.

01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:58.190
Again, look at how mystifying it is.

01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:05.614
How important do you feel if they set up that level of a shot for you?

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.303
There's lights in front of her, there's two or three people.

01:19:10.943 --> 01:19:13.004
Somebody's saying, action.

01:19:13.024 --> 01:19:20.786
Neutrogamedogenesis is almost like a science fiction technology to the general public.

01:19:22.907 --> 01:19:27.289
But this is achievable using scientific models in the lab.

01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:32.711
So it's reasonable to predict that this can be achieved using human cells.

01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:33.631
So did you hear?

01:19:36.181 --> 01:19:39.364
She said it in the most obtuse way possible.

01:19:40.285 --> 01:19:43.107
She could have just said, we can do it with simple shit in the lab.

01:19:43.948 --> 01:19:50.153
So hopefully someday we'll be able to do it with the most complex pattern integrity on earth.

01:19:54.737 --> 01:19:55.577
It's wonderful.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:59.701
I'm gonna replay it again just because I think that's a really great shot.

01:20:01.642 --> 01:20:02.964
Technologies like this,

01:20:03.712 --> 01:20:10.735
Using scientific mitochromatogenesis is almost like a science fiction technology to the general public.

01:20:12.856 --> 01:20:23.341
But this is achievable using scientific models in the lab, so it's reasonable to predict that this can be achieved using human cells as well.

01:20:24.983 --> 01:20:35.808
Technologies like this hit upon a very common refrain, which is once we get a new ability to do something radical, it also creates a lot of uncertainty.

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:47.794
If IVG becomes viable in humans, it paves the way for a future where infertile couples could have children with their own DNA.

01:20:49.995 --> 01:20:53.117
Older women could conceive, extending the biological clock.

01:20:54.598 --> 01:20:57.660
Same-sex couples could have a child related to both parents.

01:20:59.042 --> 01:21:05.085
And in the most radical change of all, a person could have a baby with themselves, no partner or sperm.

01:21:05.465 --> 01:21:14.469
Think about how awesome it would be if you had a baby that was yourself and raising it like it was just an asshole and there was nothing you could do about it.

01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:16.110
And you were the worst parent ever.

01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:20.332
And no matter what you did, it didn't matter because that little kid just hated you.

01:21:20.812 --> 01:21:24.854
And was the, I mean, it is just comedy what they're talking about here.

01:21:24.974 --> 01:21:27.115
And it is so irreverent.

01:21:30.538 --> 01:21:41.866
It's exactly Teilhard de Chardin's argument that, you know, once this is revealed to us, we have an obligation to future generations to use this knowledge.

01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:46.850
For egg donor necessary.

01:21:48.447 --> 01:21:54.911
In the past with IVF, the main issues were, should unmarried couples be able to use IVF?

01:21:55.131 --> 01:21:57.792
Should gay couples be able to use IVF?

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.534
Today, that's not really so much the issue.

01:22:00.734 --> 01:22:04.276
Now the basic question is, how can a gay couple use IVF?

01:22:07.637 --> 01:22:12.200
Now the idea is, of course, that you'd make an egg from one and a sperm from the other, but they can't do that.

01:22:13.254 --> 01:22:29.905
They can only do it with very simple models in the laboratory, but now they're doing a whole highly produced video by Bloomberg Originals with a little logo in the corner here to tell us that we're on the doorstep of doing this.

01:22:30.005 --> 01:22:40.492
Is this any different than Ray Kurzweil are telling us that if you make it to 2040, there will be no disease on earth and you will have made it to the point where you can upload your consciousness?

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:41.833
Is that any different?

01:22:45.182 --> 01:22:49.565
This bad biology can be broken and our kids will see right through this garbage.

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.726
We have the opportunity to do it.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:54.407
It's this generation.

01:22:54.607 --> 01:22:55.608
It's this time.

01:22:55.768 --> 01:22:56.428
It is us.

01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:57.249
We can do it.

01:22:58.493 --> 01:23:00.374
is what does it mean to be infertile?

01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:07.335
If you have skin cells, but no sperm or eggs, technically, under the right conditions, you are still fertile.

01:23:07.996 --> 01:23:14.517
Those very categories are being reinterpreted and reimagined, and the foundations of ethical debate are getting a little bit shaky.

01:23:14.738 --> 01:23:25.260
No, the definitions of those words are starting to get shaky, because fertile doesn't mean fertile anymore if you say that you can use molecular biology to create a zygote.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:26.981
That's not fertile.

01:23:29.022 --> 01:23:30.202
You see what they're doing here?

01:23:30.222 --> 01:23:31.703
This is the same game.

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:34.763
And they want you to fight this game.

01:23:34.823 --> 01:23:43.685
They want you to fight this game, because if you fight this game, you'll be sucked into another game, which is really cool, which was also seeded during the pandemic.

01:23:47.286 --> 01:23:52.607
And it's a game that I didn't really understand until, until the hat arrived.

01:23:53.747 --> 01:23:58.108
And when the hat arrived and I put it on and I looked in the mirror

01:23:58.925 --> 01:24:09.509
and saw the hat, it immediately became, I mean, it like snapped into my head like, I don't know, like in one flash.

01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:17.993
And what snapped in my head was, oh my gosh, if you fight for this, then you're fighting for evolution because DNA.

01:24:19.273 --> 01:24:22.294
You're fighting for genes, our behavior.

01:24:22.314 --> 01:24:23.855
And that's what you heard that guy say.

01:24:25.216 --> 01:24:30.879
that we assume that animal behavior has some genetic component and selection acts on those genes.

01:24:31.259 --> 01:24:35.841
And so we did the math based on them being a bag of genes that their behavior reflected.

01:24:36.802 --> 01:24:41.344
And then they look for correlations across the genome for the behavior that they thought they were selecting for.

01:24:41.384 --> 01:24:43.865
And if they found it, they published it, p-values done.

01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:51.729
So there is no understanding for the differences between these pattern integrities.

01:24:51.749 --> 01:24:53.430
There's no intentional,

01:24:54.463 --> 01:25:03.346
attempt to try and quantify the differences between the levels of complexity that are surely present outside of our door.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:13.449
But instead, there is a concerted effort to make sure that we assume that the biology of one is the biology of all because of DNA.

01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:18.911
Man, oh man, I think we're really, this is a good discussion.

01:25:18.951 --> 01:25:20.212
I'm happy with this.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:20.952
I like it a lot.

01:25:22.546 --> 01:25:23.967
There have been cases in the U.S.

01:25:24.007 --> 01:25:30.013
about people who propose to remove sperm from people in a terrible car accident who are now brain dead.

01:25:30.173 --> 01:25:31.094
Can you see the hat?

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:31.594
Sorry.

01:25:31.614 --> 01:25:34.837
Post-mortem or after death reproduction.

01:25:35.278 --> 01:25:39.962
That's not a medical or scientific disadvantage, but certainly that's socially disruptive.

01:25:42.202 --> 01:25:45.123
I got the blacked out one, but they also make a nice green one with white.

01:25:45.143 --> 01:25:45.503
It's crazy.

01:25:45.943 --> 01:25:51.584
If we can someday have babies developed entirely in a lab, we need to be ready to answer some new questions.

01:25:52.264 --> 01:25:53.384
Are they someone's child?

01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:54.584
Someone's sister?

01:25:55.145 --> 01:25:55.805
Someone's brother?

01:25:57.645 --> 01:25:59.905
We used to think that we knew what a womb was.

01:26:00.686 --> 01:26:05.346
We used to think that it was pretty clear, but when I say uterus, you know what I'm talking about.

01:26:05.807 --> 01:26:07.607
Today, it's not that clear.

01:26:08.857 --> 01:26:22.244
Through IVG, if you create a sperm or an egg, you have to do a test to make sure that it's safe to use in the clinic, to make sure that you're not gonna transfer into a woman's uterus something that could actually go wrong.

01:26:22.864 --> 01:26:26.126
So you have to create an artificial womb-like environment.

01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:27.387
You can't just put it in a dish.

01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:29.208
That's not like a real human body.

01:26:29.628 --> 01:26:34.811
So all the research we're talking about of IVG, it needs accompanying technology

01:26:35.371 --> 01:26:39.914
But could those other technologies like the artificial womb be used for other things?

01:26:44.037 --> 01:26:48.160
Artificial womb technology is currently being developed to help premature infants.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.484
I mean, they're always showing you babies that are somehow or another attached to something.

01:26:53.504 --> 01:26:58.447
They're not just babies in the arms of their mom or babies in swaddling clothes.

01:26:58.508 --> 01:27:01.450
It's always babies on ventilators or babies in boxes.

01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:02.951
It's pretty impressive.

01:27:04.372 --> 01:27:04.632
Again,

01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:24.097
giving young people the incorrect tools to understand their world, the incorrect tools in order to protect themselves from this enslavement by mythology, this Truman Show that they are creating using mythology about biology.

01:27:24.957 --> 01:27:25.677
It's wonderful.

01:27:25.758 --> 01:27:26.878
We can break this.

01:27:30.106 --> 01:27:30.806
and survive.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:38.429
But one day, if this technology is perfected, lab-made embryos from IVG could be grown outside the human body.

01:27:40.929 --> 01:27:46.711
The mission and purpose of my work is to solve the problem of extreme prematurity.

01:27:48.272 --> 01:27:58.435
How can we recreate that magical maternal womb so that these babies can survive and thrive?

01:28:02.659 --> 01:28:06.482
there is a great Life magazine cover with the Beatles on it.

01:28:06.842 --> 01:28:08.343
And it was the mid-60s.

01:28:08.643 --> 01:28:14.187
And in that issue was an obscure article about the artificial placenta.

01:28:14.567 --> 01:28:19.471
So the idea occurred to really innovative scientists many decades ago.

01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:23.374
But in the last two decades, the work has accelerated.

01:28:23.534 --> 01:28:32.140
And we're at a point where we are approaching clinical translation to actually use this technology in human infants.

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.536
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

01:28:35.716 --> 01:28:42.661
They have been working with the FDA to begin a clinical trial of safety of their device.

01:28:43.301 --> 01:28:48.265
We are not far behind, approximately three to four years away.

01:28:48.565 --> 01:28:55.789
Can we go from the embryo to a fetus to a live-born baby completely outside the womb?

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.972
I've learned in my work never to say never.

01:29:00.092 --> 01:29:02.374
However, I don't think that's possible.

01:29:06.613 --> 01:29:14.218
Some may think that the artificial womb concept is firmly in the world of science fiction.

01:29:15.479 --> 01:29:21.924
I think that it's a little bit risky to just have that level of confidence, so we shouldn't be caught off guard.

01:29:23.814 --> 01:29:28.257
There is no master conductor saying, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, we're gonna put it together.

01:29:28.377 --> 01:29:30.919
Rather, different teams are doing their own thing.

01:29:31.559 --> 01:29:41.286
Once the technology develops in one area, another technology develops somewhere else, then magically, simultaneously, they might be put together in a very surprising way.

01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:48.872
Imagine the scenario of ex vivo gestation, gestating a baby outside the body.

01:29:50.043 --> 01:29:54.047
Everybody in the world, every human being has a birth mother.

01:29:54.808 --> 01:29:57.630
This would be a child that does not have a birth mother.

01:29:57.730 --> 01:29:58.411
Does that matter?

01:30:00.953 --> 01:30:12.664
It's an incredible thing to agree so much on the idea that that's a good question that you would make a documentary about it with this much, this high a production level.

01:30:12.724 --> 01:30:14.066
That's what's extraordinary here.

01:30:15.029 --> 01:30:18.810
That's what you need to see about this series and also the series with Hannah Fry.

01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.591
It is amazing what they are trying to do to our kids.

01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:27.732
And I don't mean, I don't mean to say that they're trying to do that to our kids.

01:30:27.792 --> 01:30:40.496
I mean, they're trying to, as it said in the chat, they're trying to have us teach our kids a comic book science that they will be enslaved by and teach it to them on the basis that, well, we all experienced the pandemic.

01:30:40.516 --> 01:30:41.416
We made some mistakes.

01:30:41.456 --> 01:30:44.117
Sorry, babe, but medicine is going great.

01:30:47.662 --> 01:30:52.946
Technology may cure infertility and bring us into the world in new ways, but it won't stop there.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:57.709
It will accompany us through every stage of our lives, in sickness and in health.

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:07.155
The reason we're not going to stop developing AI is because it has immense potential for doing good, in particular in an area like healthcare.

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:14.620
So already in North America, about 200,000 people a year are killed by doctors giving a bad diagnosis.

01:31:15.754 --> 01:31:23.478
Now, if you take difficult cases and you give them to normal doctors, the doctors will get about 40% of them right.

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:27.500
Surprised they're advocating for AI in public health.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.581
Extraordinary, right?

01:31:28.761 --> 01:31:37.826
Extraordinary how these things all overlap into different series with different hosts produced by different people that includes all Hannah Fry from Hazelmere.

01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:44.376
If you give them to the combination of a doctor and an AI system, they get about 60% right.

01:31:44.717 --> 01:31:52.007
In a few years' time, I believe what it'll be is the AI system will give a diagnosis and the doctor will just check it to make sure it's not silly.

01:31:52.748 --> 01:31:54.730
But the AI system will be doing the heavy lifting.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:56.373
And it will be much better.

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:12.721
But that has nothing to do with the training of doctors or the changing of the way that we take care of ourselves or the bad model of biology that these doctors are using to try and diagnose these patients.

01:32:13.202 --> 01:32:17.346
Instead, what they're doing now is making a mockery

01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:38.699
trying to make a mockery of what a doctor used to be by pulling the wool over our eyes and making us believe that AI is somehow so smart, when what we should be thinking is, holy shit, are doctors so bad at their job that the majority of them can no longer diagnose complex medical conditions because their training is so bad?

01:32:41.363 --> 01:32:46.624
because the AI is trained only on successful confirmed diagnoses.

01:32:46.745 --> 01:32:51.526
So how's the AI gonna make the mistakes that badly trained doctors are gonna make?

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:59.748
Do you see that huge right in your face bait and switch where it's actually AI is much better than doctors, humans just suck.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:09.591
It couldn't be that for the last 40 years, we've been training doctors like crap and passing along a model of biology that makes them

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:11.827
inept at their job.

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.790
Oh baby, are we crushing this?

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:17.071
It is wonderful.

01:33:17.451 --> 01:33:24.377
Could soon get even better at not just diagnosing, but treating us with the help of a digital copy of our bodies.

01:33:25.958 --> 01:33:29.981
A digital copy of our bodies, that's nice.

01:33:30.001 --> 01:33:31.482
What is a virtual twin?

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:39.128
So virtual twin is a complicated concept to build, but very straightforward to understand.

01:33:40.523 --> 01:33:49.845
The idea is to use the basic same laws of nature that govern the products around you and build that exact copy on the computer.

01:33:49.865 --> 01:33:49.925
See?

01:33:50.465 --> 01:34:08.008
So if the particle physicists that established molecular biology, according to the guy from TWIV, if the particle physicists that came from the Manhattan Project, if those guys established a false set of assumptions upon which biology is based,

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:11.837
It's kind of like evolution because DNA.

01:34:11.857 --> 01:34:16.582
I mean, did you hear him?

01:34:16.682 --> 01:34:18.864
I got to play it again because that's just incredible.

01:34:19.925 --> 01:34:21.206
I got to make sure that I get it right.

01:34:28.294 --> 01:34:30.315
So these guys have also said that, right?

01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:35.118
That if they just had enough data and they had the rules right, they could simulate reality.

01:34:35.158 --> 01:34:36.439
They could predict the future.

01:34:36.959 --> 01:34:48.045
They could, what these guys are purporting to do, create a virtual you, a virtual reality that would make accurate predictions because all the laws were there and we had enough computing power to do it.

01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:51.127
That's not dissimilar to what he's describing here.

01:34:51.327 --> 01:34:52.168
It's extraordinary.

01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:53.228
Listen.

01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:56.090
What is a virtual twin?

01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:03.875
So Virtual Twin is a complicated concept to build, but very straightforward to understand.

01:35:03.915 --> 01:35:15.983
The idea is to use the basic same laws of nature that govern the products around you and build that exact copy on the computer so we understand how it will behave.

01:35:17.264 --> 01:35:22.267
For example, if we crash a car, we know how the metal bends, how the glass shatters.

01:35:22.868 --> 01:35:26.250
We now apply that same methodology to the human body.

01:35:28.484 --> 01:35:29.525
That's perfect!

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:32.347
It's exactly!

01:35:32.587 --> 01:35:44.655
We work with a lot of pediatric hospitals because in the cases of rare diseases like congenital heart defects, it's very hard to get treatments for those because we have no data.

01:35:44.675 --> 01:35:46.056
How would we know we would get it right?

01:35:46.256 --> 01:35:50.879
That's exactly why in these other industries, they build the virtual twin.

01:35:50.899 --> 01:35:57.284
They can't wait to know how a plane is going to fly through a tornado before they can build a plane that can survive a tornado.

01:35:58.104 --> 01:36:00.487
they use the virtual twin to be able to do that.

01:36:01.048 --> 01:36:06.314
Again, thinking as though those are equivalent pattern integrities.

01:36:06.354 --> 01:36:08.717
An airplane in the air is not a pattern integrity.

01:36:10.737 --> 01:36:16.620
So applying those models to life is just absurd, but these guys are fine with doing it.

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:27.185
Molecular biology was established by guys who didn't have jobs, because as Housatonic Life showed us, these same physicists had nothing to do.

01:36:27.645 --> 01:36:30.627
So they went right to the Department of Energy, where they already were,

01:36:31.467 --> 01:36:35.050
and founded the idea of the Human Genome Project.

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:37.951
The idea set that is the foundation of it.

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:47.457
That even though we don't know how to do it now, someday soon we will have all the laws of physics and chemistry that we need to understand the aperiodic crystal that is life.

01:36:47.877 --> 01:36:49.078
This is a lie.

01:36:50.919 --> 01:36:54.682
And we are being governed by the mythology that supports this assumption.

01:36:56.082 --> 01:36:59.565
I don't know if they really believe they're eventually going to crack that code,

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:11.532
or if they're just using the incredibly enticing nature of this idea to enslave us and a lot of people even at the highest levels of this illusion.

01:37:12.894 --> 01:37:14.035
Lots of people believe it.

01:37:15.516 --> 01:37:21.523
I think a lot of these people in this documentary absolutely believe what they're saying and they think it's important and it's real.

01:37:26.539 --> 01:37:42.169
These virtual twins would be programmed with everything about each person's body, our medical history, how we respond to medication, and even the unique shape and condition of our organs, taking the guesswork out of medicine and ensuring better outcomes for even the most complicated cases.

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:49.193
What they're really making the argument for there is if they're going to approach to understand the genome and listen carefully.

01:37:49.213 --> 01:37:53.216
Just make sure I have everybody's attention.

01:37:54.724 --> 01:38:06.192
in order to understand the genome, they are going to need to make as detailed a model of you as they can in order to correlate it with your genome.

01:38:07.914 --> 01:38:20.423
No different than going out in the wild and catching a bunch of monkeys like that guy talked about in the first video, and then doing their genotype and trying to correlate between the behavior you observed in the wild and the genes you collected back in the lab.

01:38:22.182 --> 01:38:28.092
They want and need to do this for every human because the Human Genome Project made this obvious to them.

01:38:29.814 --> 01:38:36.145
That after all that work and all that technological devotion and development, the end result is that holy crap.

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:41.613
We can only sequence very short pieces and we can't be really sure about those pieces.

01:38:42.013 --> 01:38:44.014
And it's going to take us forever to do the whole thing.

01:38:44.054 --> 01:38:48.837
And we still only have solved the puzzle of where did the building parts come from?

01:38:48.877 --> 01:38:55.761
We have no read on how this aperiodic crystal governs the change of the pattern integrity across time.

01:38:57.261 --> 01:38:59.623
But they couldn't tell us that in the Nature article.

01:39:01.118 --> 01:39:10.240
They couldn't tell us that we're still missing huge pieces to the puzzle to understand how the hell this DNA molecule could possibly explain life, nevermind evolution.

01:39:11.581 --> 01:39:17.182
Instead, they went all in and said, we found it, we did it, obviously evolution.

01:39:19.623 --> 01:39:21.043
And that's how we're here right now.

01:39:22.004 --> 01:39:30.386
It's been accelerated because of the pandemic and the mythology that the pandemic enabled them to throw at us with coercion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

01:39:34.008 --> 01:39:38.612
We're kind of on the cusp of the industrial revolution for the human body.

01:39:39.392 --> 01:39:40.293
We don't have to guess.

01:39:40.653 --> 01:39:48.059
You can test a crazy idea on the virtual twin, but by the time you get to the human, you can get it right the first time.

01:39:49.989 --> 01:39:55.196
Steve first began working on a virtual model of the heart when his daughter Jessie was born with a rare disease.

01:39:55.537 --> 01:39:57.640
I bet Plantonics is going to love this one.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:04.269
So when Jessie was born, we learned that she had this very rare congenital heart defect.

01:40:04.309 --> 01:40:05.651
They weren't very optimistic.

01:40:07.671 --> 01:40:08.952
How did this affect your life?

01:40:09.392 --> 01:40:11.213
You know, I've been a patient my whole life.

01:40:11.654 --> 01:40:13.935
I got my first pacemaker when I was two years old.

01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:24.923
That experience really made me want to be involved in pediatric medical care because I saw the impact he was able to have on me.

01:40:25.823 --> 01:40:27.284
So, what was the lightbulb moment?

01:40:27.544 --> 01:40:36.288
I remember thinking, I work in this world where if you can create a 3-D image of it, we can then bring it to life and you can test it on it.

01:40:36.588 --> 01:40:37.888
Why can't a doctor do that?

01:40:38.569 --> 01:40:42.270
And at that moment, my two worlds collided.

01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:53.435
This struggle as a father to be able to help her doctors understand what to do, and this professional demand to simulate life, and that was the birth of the project.

01:40:55.083 --> 01:40:57.305
Professional demands, you know, that's what it is.

01:40:57.325 --> 01:40:58.846
Professional demands.

01:40:59.327 --> 01:41:11.818
If the professional demands are that the NIH has a grant call for genetic causes and genetic models of autism, then biologists all around the United States are going to find a way to meet that call.

01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:18.224
And after a couple, three generations, we are where we are.

01:41:18.444 --> 01:41:18.764
That's it.

01:41:19.004 --> 01:41:19.425
It's easy.

01:41:21.274 --> 01:41:31.584
Living Heart Project was an attempt to see if we knew enough to actually build an entire virtual twin of the heart like we can for an entire, say, commercial jet.

01:41:31.924 --> 01:41:34.587
And it turned out within a year, we had it fully working.

01:41:36.989 --> 01:41:41.351
ultimately going into pediatrics, you know, no one wants to research on children.

01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:56.479
So knowing that, you know, on the horizon is something that we could simulate, you know, a hundred, a thousand cases where there's really only one individual and figure out how to help that one individual without, you know, putting them in any danger.

01:41:56.919 --> 01:41:59.280
Do no harm is our first, you know, our first tenet.

01:42:00.928 --> 01:42:07.715
Steve, you recently faced an incredible twist of fate where this technology also saved you.

01:42:08.496 --> 01:42:09.157
What happened?

01:42:10.318 --> 01:42:20.229
Inside my own head was a tumor that had grown to be much larger than anyone would want, larger than a golf ball, right in the center of my head.

01:42:20.914 --> 01:42:24.276
Anyone hearing about a diagnosis like this would be devastated.

01:42:24.296 --> 01:42:28.898
Did knowing that this technology existed make you feel more hope?

01:42:29.778 --> 01:42:48.947
Especially in the setting of this specific kind of tumor, which the approach is often non-invasive, and knowing that his surgeon would be able to use similar technology to see what's going on inside his head without actually seeing what's going on inside his head.

01:42:51.892 --> 01:43:00.499
The tumor invaded a space called the cavernous sinus, which carries a lot of the nerves that go not just to the eye, but to the rest of the face.

01:43:01.039 --> 01:43:06.524
They were going to have to avoid all of those really delicate items.

01:43:09.066 --> 01:43:18.654
The virtual twin would allow them to not only preserve all of those things, but to get the entire tumor out, they were able to get it all.

01:43:19.955 --> 01:43:21.616
Again, this is the bait and switch.

01:43:21.716 --> 01:43:23.416
This is the shell game that they're playing.

01:43:23.516 --> 01:43:40.243
Making an anatomical model of the brain to guide a surgery is incredibly different from making a model down to the molecule or down to the cell of the brain and its function in order to store it in a computer so that when you're dead, you can be represented again.

01:43:40.803 --> 01:44:00.109
but they are blurring the line between these two because they want you to think that we are on a natural progression from graphic surgery tools and anatomically accurate 3D models to the ability to use genes, hear it carefully ladies and gentlemen, use genes to get to the 3D model.

01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:05.411
That's what they think they're going to be able to do, that if they make enough virtual

01:44:06.469 --> 01:44:16.556
virtual human representations of other humans and correlate that to their genome, then eventually they're going to be able to see how it is that the genome encodes that.

01:44:18.838 --> 01:44:22.000
They are preparing us to become the experimental animals.

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:25.663
We may already be the experimental animals and our children will be these.

01:44:28.224 --> 01:44:30.106
Holy man, can you see it?

01:44:35.373 --> 01:44:39.837
How does it feel that this technology that you invented saved both of your lives?

01:44:40.177 --> 01:44:45.902
First, you saved your daughter's life with this technology, and then your daughter saved you.

01:44:46.142 --> 01:44:52.828
We were able to turn a particularly threatening challenge to our life into something that really has transformed it.

01:44:52.848 --> 01:44:53.789
I don't know how it saved him.

01:44:53.849 --> 01:44:54.990
I can't put it into words.

01:44:55.407 --> 01:44:56.808
Why isn't this everywhere?

01:44:57.468 --> 01:45:03.150
Why is it taking so long for this technology to get into hospitals and into doctors' hands?

01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:06.271
The medical field is inherently conservative.

01:45:06.612 --> 01:45:09.953
We're still faxing medical records around and things like that.

01:45:11.192 --> 01:45:13.593
see what's going on and do no harm is our first.

01:45:13.733 --> 01:45:20.056
Understand what to do and this professional demand to simulate life and that was the birth of the project.

01:45:20.076 --> 01:45:21.696
Professional demand to simulate life.

01:45:21.736 --> 01:45:25.478
So they simulated her heart to do a surgery then they simulated his brain.

01:45:25.618 --> 01:45:26.799
I see now.

01:45:26.819 --> 01:45:27.359
Yeah.

01:45:27.399 --> 01:45:29.300
That's not the same thing.

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:31.861
But I can guarantee you that's what they're planning.

01:45:31.881 --> 01:45:37.183
First you saved your daughter's life with this technology and then your daughter saved you.

01:45:37.458 --> 01:45:39.901
We were able to turn... Oh, I like that.

01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:40.823
That could be a book.

01:45:41.063 --> 01:45:42.305
From sheep to lab rats.

01:45:42.365 --> 01:45:43.706
Ooh, I like that a lot.

01:45:43.746 --> 01:45:44.588
I might steal that.

01:45:45.148 --> 01:45:46.931
I can't put it into words.

01:45:47.011 --> 01:45:48.393
I might steal that.

01:45:48.433 --> 01:45:49.274
That's a good one.

01:45:49.794 --> 01:45:50.856
Maybe that's the Biology 101 book.

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:57.583
The medical field is inherently conservative.

01:45:57.943 --> 01:46:00.245
We're still faxing medical records around.

01:46:00.325 --> 01:46:01.706
Unbelievable nonsense here.

01:46:02.026 --> 01:46:03.107
Unbelievable nonsense.

01:46:03.127 --> 01:46:06.169
And so the modernization of the medical system takes time.

01:46:06.449 --> 01:46:10.572
If people knew that they could expect better, it will go faster.

01:46:10.592 --> 01:46:17.857
Because when people start to ask for this technology is when doctors will start to say, well, okay, let me look into this.

01:46:18.277 --> 01:46:19.598
What are the possibilities there?

01:46:20.258 --> 01:46:20.799
Ultimately,

01:46:21.761 --> 01:46:29.111
Our ability to manage our own health care is very much tied up in our understanding of how our bodies work.

01:46:29.452 --> 01:46:34.258
When we have a question, we have to go and ask our doctor, can you tell me what to do?

01:46:34.839 --> 01:46:36.521
But if we can capture all that knowledge,

01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:38.683
into a virtual twin.

01:46:38.943 --> 01:46:44.431
I can actually eventually play those what-if games and then I can use my doctor as a consultant.

01:46:44.711 --> 01:46:50.018
I've spent the last week exploring the options for how to cure my disease.

01:46:50.719 --> 01:46:51.681
This is what I think.

01:46:52.241 --> 01:46:53.904
Let me show you the work that I've done.

01:46:56.798 --> 01:46:58.259
Sounds like the patient all the doctors hate.

01:46:58.279 --> 01:47:04.323
If virtual twins in the metaverse can store every bit of data about our bodies, could we do the same for our life experiences?

01:47:05.164 --> 01:47:11.127
Will we finally realize the elusive dream of immortality through avatars that know us better than we know ourselves?

01:47:14.410 --> 01:47:17.051
What about at the end of life and the concept of digital eternity?

01:47:18.412 --> 01:47:23.416
So in digital systems, you can take it- This is Ray Kurzweiler's nonsense, right?

01:47:23.496 --> 01:47:24.516
Uploading your consciousness.

01:47:24.576 --> 01:47:25.417
Exactly the same way.

01:47:26.314 --> 01:47:28.635
And digital systems are basically immortal for that reason.

01:47:29.336 --> 01:47:33.538
As long as you remember the connection strengths in a neural network, you can just get rid of all the hardware.

01:47:33.778 --> 01:47:38.981
If you build new hardware and put the same connection strengths in, and it's digital, it will behave exactly the same way.

01:47:39.322 --> 01:47:40.742
See, so there's the assumption.

01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:44.385
The assumption is amazing because a pattern integrity is like a...

01:47:45.265 --> 01:48:12.689
The the surface of a lake in some in some senses and so what he's suggesting is if you just had All the all the the measurements of all the surface of the lake then you could simulate it and it would run But that's not the way it works at all A human is not is not the echo of a cave Where if you just make the same cave somewhere else out of the same material and yell into it, it'll be the same echo

01:48:15.751 --> 01:48:22.833
A human's not a basketball court if you paint it right and treat it with the same, you know, it's not the same as an airplane.

01:48:23.273 --> 01:48:29.375
If you have the same materials and you build an airplane in France the same way you built it in America, it'll be the same airplane.

01:48:31.595 --> 01:48:43.679
A pattern integrity by definition is a something that has a trajectory through time that cannot be captured by a snapshot of synaptic weights in the brain.

01:48:45.182 --> 01:48:51.668
The synaptic weights of my brain are changing in real time right now, just like yours are, as you listen.

01:48:52.970 --> 01:49:04.200
You can't simulate that by taking a snapshot of it and then recreating it in a computer, no matter how wonderful your computer skills are, and no matter how perfect your computer system is.

01:49:06.122 --> 01:49:08.745
Because it's missing the four-dimensional aspect.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:17.064
It's missing the reincorporation of new molecules, the consumption of energy, the production of waste.

01:49:17.124 --> 01:49:18.065
It's all not there.

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:24.029
There's no homeostasis captured in the weights of synaptic weights in the brain.

01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:26.831
These people are crazy.

01:49:30.987 --> 01:49:34.249
So you think AI can realistically give us a form of immortality?

01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:37.852
Chatbots can be immortal, but immortality is not for people.

01:49:37.892 --> 01:49:39.153
People are analog systems.

01:49:39.693 --> 01:49:45.417
Nobody can replicate you without precisely replicating all your hardware, which is impossible.

01:49:45.437 --> 01:49:47.359
So, for example, I lost my father at a young age.

01:49:47.399 --> 01:49:48.139
Oh, he does say that.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:53.923
If I could speak to some digital version of him that felt like him, I think I'd want to do that.

01:49:53.943 --> 01:49:54.584
Why would you want that?

01:49:54.884 --> 01:49:57.106
In order to do that, you'd need to train up

01:49:58.143 --> 01:50:00.945
a chatbot on lock, which is impossible.

01:50:01.085 --> 01:50:03.687
So for example, I lost my father at a young age.

01:50:04.087 --> 01:50:09.811
If I could speak to some digital version of him that felt like him, I think I'd love to do that.

01:50:10.071 --> 01:50:11.492
Wow, why?

01:50:12.252 --> 01:50:14.313
What a terrible idea that is.

01:50:18.036 --> 01:50:25.881
What a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible way to desecrate the sacred memory of your father.

01:50:28.646 --> 01:50:29.767
Can you see the theme here?

01:50:32.288 --> 01:50:33.689
Today is a very busy day.

01:50:34.029 --> 01:50:37.571
I think I'm going to cut it short here because this feels like a really good place to end it.

01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:38.551
But they're going to go on.

01:50:38.611 --> 01:50:39.592
This video goes on.

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:40.532
There are other episodes.

01:50:40.932 --> 01:50:43.734
We're going to look at some of the Hannah Fry one at some point.

01:50:45.515 --> 01:50:46.936
Anyway, I hope you found this useful.

01:50:46.976 --> 01:50:56.641
I think we're going to be able to do this a lot to try and make some progress, get some words down, and get some pieces together that will help assemble this

01:50:57.381 --> 01:51:06.935
this ladder that we can use to climb out of the cave of this bad biology, this ladder of ideas that will form the foundation of a new biology.

01:51:07.516 --> 01:51:11.822
Maybe one of the most useful ways to find out or identify what those ideas are

01:51:12.683 --> 01:51:30.173
are to do exercises like this where we have a study hall and we listen to a very high level production of the message and the plan and the intention and the ideas that descend all the way from Desjardins to now.

01:51:31.054 --> 01:51:35.356
And we're hearing all kinds of aspects of it in real time.

01:51:35.896 --> 01:51:38.318
And so if we can, and we can tie all these together,

01:51:39.730 --> 01:52:00.949
in such a way as to throw them off the boat all together, all at once, then we will be able to move forward with our children and present them with a new way of seeing the irreducible complexity of biology right outside in our gardens and from it develop a natural reverence for the sacred.

01:52:02.911 --> 01:52:05.153
And our children will naturally seek God on their own.

01:52:07.284 --> 01:52:16.127
That's what I find ultimately the most beautiful conclusion of the work that I have been offered to do that has fallen into my lap for one reason or another.

01:52:16.167 --> 01:52:31.031
This concept of a new Biology 101 that at the end of the class, the average kid, the average young adult will approach the world with a reverence that will ultimately lead to them seeking God themselves.

01:52:33.723 --> 01:52:46.171
seeking higher spiritual explanations, and more importantly, seeking higher spiritual goals to contribute to the real noosphere, which is the continuous consciousness of people across generations.

01:52:47.272 --> 01:52:48.512
That's what really matters here.

01:52:49.633 --> 01:52:54.356
The continuous consciousness of people across generations, and that's what these people are after.

01:52:54.376 --> 01:52:57.158
They want to break that chain.

01:52:58.194 --> 01:53:03.882
so that they can replace it with the system of imprisonment that this mythology represents.

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:10.071
I don't know what to say other than I thought I had a really productive show.

01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:14.052
I think I'm gonna try and do it a lot.

01:53:15.033 --> 01:53:20.019
First of all, I'm gonna try to establish a pattern of five days a week at 10 o'clock in the morning every day.

01:53:20.579 --> 01:53:27.487
And then within a week or two, maybe even next week, I'm gonna try and do Tuesdays and Thursdays where I also start with Matt Briggs' class again.

01:53:28.008 --> 01:53:31.152
Today I won't be able to do it because this afternoon we have a number of appointments.

01:53:32.461 --> 01:53:36.984
and it just doesn't fit in, but this schedule is ultimately the most important thing that I have.

01:53:37.784 --> 01:53:46.069
And so please accept my humblest apologies for not sticking to it this week, but next week I think we're gonna be on it, but definitely I'm gonna be here again tomorrow.

01:53:46.509 --> 01:53:50.271
I know I was late today at 11.11, so that should be the pattern that you should expect.

01:53:50.752 --> 01:53:51.632
I'll either be on at 10.10 or 11.11.

01:53:53.613 --> 01:53:59.258
or otherwise 1313, because that's one o'clock in the afternoon military time, not because 13 special.

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:05.423
And yeah, let's try to break this illusion of us being a bag of genes.

01:54:06.144 --> 01:54:08.286
And thank you very much for joining me.

01:54:08.986 --> 01:54:11.288
This has been a presentation of GigaOM Biological.

01:54:11.328 --> 01:54:13.710
If you want to see the replay, go to stream.gigaom.bio.

01:54:14.631 --> 01:54:31.804
where this will be in the biology 101 category and if you want to communicate with me maybe stream.bio or gigaohm.bio is maybe the place and if you want to support this work which I would very much appreciate and so would the few people that are floating this boat because I don't think they can do it forever and don't want to.

01:54:34.386 --> 01:54:42.612
I would really like it if we could just get to the stage where we had enough of very small contributing subscribers so that this thing would be self-sustaining and I wouldn't have to

01:54:44.059 --> 01:54:56.309
I wouldn't have to have people like I have now, which I'm very appreciative to and I don't want to mention names because they are all humble enough not to want to be mentioned, but there's only a few of them and they know who they are and I'm very grateful to them.

01:54:56.789 --> 01:55:04.315
But I'm also very grateful to the 130 subscribers or so that are there every month and have been there, some of them since the very beginning.

01:55:05.464 --> 01:55:07.467
It's just an extraordinary privilege I have.

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:13.455
And it's provided by you guys so thank you very much, and there's not going to be a play out in these Tuesdays and Thursdays.

01:55:14.075 --> 01:55:20.524
So people complain about the long introduction so I'm going to do the long introduction on Mondays and Fridays, and.

01:55:21.685 --> 01:55:26.889
a reasonably short introduction Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or at least that's what we have in the works right now.

01:55:26.949 --> 01:55:27.909
So I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:31.572
Tomorrow is Wednesday, so I will see you for a Wayback Wednesday.

01:55:32.172 --> 01:55:40.878
We're going to actually watch the old original stream with me and Kevin McKernan when I first interviewed him and see what we can find in that interview.

01:55:40.918 --> 01:55:42.039
So I look forward to doing that.

01:55:42.059 --> 01:55:43.319
That'll be tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.942
Thank you very much for joining me, and I will see you again, like I said, tomorrow.

01:55:48.643 --> 01:55:50.144
Repeating myself like a monkey here.

01:55:51.178 --> 01:55:53.549
Good night, good afternoon, good evening, good morning.

01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:54.131
See you later.
