WEBVTT

04:11.000 --> 04:14.080
I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.960
I bet you kids are starving.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
Groovy!

04:16.960 --> 04:18.640
So, wait! That's for me!

04:21.440 --> 04:23.680
Hey, what's this?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.640
Scooby-Booze was here.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.640
The whole turkey!

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
Go on!

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
Whoo!

04:30.640 --> 04:32.640
Well...

04:32.640 --> 04:34.640
Scooby, here we go!

04:41.000 --> 05:04.840
Are we doing the stand to join the city of the age?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.840
Yes, two days ago.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.840
One side state your seat.

05:08.840 --> 05:13.840
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.520
This is Giga on Biological, a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
by a biologist.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.120
It's the 3rd of October, 2023.

05:22.120 --> 05:28.960
You don't understand Mr. Brown.

05:28.960 --> 05:34.960
The bottom is a holy weapon.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.440
Yes.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.800
Thanks very much for the compliments for yesterday's show.

05:38.800 --> 05:44.720
I have to admit that after screwing up a time, all I had to do was really sit there and

05:44.720 --> 05:49.440
then watch the fire go out, basically.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.520
It was wonderful because I think we really saw two people meet and discuss something

05:54.520 --> 05:57.840
that they both had very strong views about it.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.960
I do think that Peter was a little bit freed by that discussion.

06:01.960 --> 06:12.600
I saw a little bit of weightless thought on the show because I thought it was wonderful.

06:12.600 --> 06:19.760
Because I do think that Peter has been trapped, Peter has been pinched, Peter, you can see

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
his heart broken.

06:20.760 --> 06:28.600
I just don't see Peter as the same way that I see other people in this mess.

06:29.600 --> 06:37.640
I see a good guy there and like Pierre Cori, actually, I see people that came out the earliest

06:37.640 --> 06:43.600
are actually very visually distressed because they are holding back.

06:43.600 --> 06:50.880
They were pigeonholed or co-opted, you know, people and students came to them and said,

06:50.880 --> 06:56.080
you know, I know you can see the brick wall at the back of the theater if you want to

06:56.080 --> 07:00.280
keep doing what you're doing, then you better follow our instructions because now's the

07:00.280 --> 07:08.560
time to do what you're told and, you know, in a way, we are the ones who have to free

07:08.560 --> 07:14.560
those people because we have to make room for them to come out, we have to make room

07:14.560 --> 07:19.920
for them to bring forth the truth because the truth is definitely out there.

07:19.920 --> 07:27.240
I can feel it and there's people just waiting to break this narrative, but they need to

07:27.240 --> 07:34.600
feel safe and that means Cori and Peter McCullough, these people need to feel like there's enough

07:34.600 --> 07:41.800
of us before they're going to come full across the line and say, hey, you know what, we got

07:41.800 --> 07:49.720
phone calls, people came to my house and this is all that crap.

07:49.720 --> 07:57.480
I think it's possible, I think it's actually really possible, I'm starting to almost believe

07:57.480 --> 08:04.120
it when I wake up in the morning and I can tell you when you start to believe something

08:04.120 --> 08:09.280
when you wake up in the morning, it's a really special thing.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.600
I've started to have hope when I wake up and it's weird because it's been a while since

08:14.600 --> 08:19.480
I've been able to wake up like that, so I hope that you also are starting to feel a little

08:19.480 --> 08:28.720
shift in the uncertainty, a little increase in the, I don't know, in the cacophony that

08:28.720 --> 08:35.320
should be there of people screaming and yelling about why we need to back the truck up, so to speak,

08:35.320 --> 08:43.480
not take the bait on TV and social media. I find the crickets rather relaxing if you want my honest

08:43.480 --> 08:49.480
truth. I miss them in the winter time and I definitely miss them in the spring when it's warming

08:49.480 --> 08:53.240
up to sit outside, but they're not there yet and I don't even remember as a kid when they first

08:53.240 --> 08:58.760
came, but it always feels like they're coming later and later, but at least they're there now.

08:58.760 --> 09:05.000
I really like the ones that sit up in the tree and make the really harsh every once in a while,

09:05.000 --> 09:10.840
they're really cool. I have no idea what those are, at our old house we used to be able to hear

09:10.840 --> 09:15.320
frogs in the trees too, but there are no frogs here in the city, at least I don't really hear

09:15.320 --> 09:20.520
them, not like I did out there. So we're here tonight to kind of discuss the Scooby-Doo, I don't

09:20.520 --> 09:26.600
have a guest, I don't have a super big plan, I have some videos lined up, and if you want to

09:26.600 --> 09:31.880
throw in some mean comments in the chat or something like that I'll block you, and if you want to

09:31.880 --> 09:38.520
throw in some questions I'll try and answer them. Good to see everybody in the chat, I'll try and

09:38.520 --> 09:43.480
read some stuff, I see Pamela's here and I'm really happy to see her, I see Marcus here,

09:44.920 --> 09:50.680
a lot of the same people that are here every night, and so I don't know what you guys are doing here,

09:50.680 --> 09:55.240
but thanks a lot for making this happen, I hope you guys are tweeting it out or

09:55.240 --> 10:01.960
Facebooking it or whatever the hell you do. It is not a matter of what is true that counts,

10:01.960 --> 10:07.800
but a matter of what is perceived to be true, this is something that was first said by,

10:08.840 --> 10:12.440
at least I know that, it's a particular quote as coming from Kissinger,

10:13.960 --> 10:20.920
and we have been thinking about this people map, trying to sort out how it is that we were

10:20.920 --> 10:27.480
brought to understand, I have a lot of stuff in my throat tonight, I apologize, but I think

10:27.480 --> 10:35.480
that's a good sign like things are moving. How did we get here where we thought that there was a

10:35.480 --> 10:43.400
magical new sequence of RNA that was capable of disrupting a planet, and indeed became

10:43.400 --> 10:49.720
convinced worldwide that this was true? I think that the way to look around now is to really just

10:49.720 --> 10:54.440
evaluate people on whether they're being honest about this, if they're not using the word

10:54.520 --> 11:01.080
transfection yet, and they're on TV and whatnot, you can pretty much bet that they've been instructed

11:01.080 --> 11:07.560
not to, and so I don't blame anybody for that, I'm just saying that I think that's where that

11:07.560 --> 11:13.160
problem sits, and I think that more and more people are coming to realize, at least in the

11:13.160 --> 11:21.160
United States, that the immunization schedule in the United States is absurd, and indeed, I think

11:21.160 --> 11:30.040
at some point, I think one of my best predictions is that this above statement here is going to

11:30.040 --> 11:36.520
become common knowledge in five to ten years at max, but it could be as short as six months.

11:39.960 --> 11:47.800
Automobile noise is not so great as crickets. I really think that this is the right way to

11:48.680 --> 11:54.760
think about this for now, because what it does is it really describes the absurdity,

11:55.720 --> 12:01.960
and that's how you want these bench immunologists and these people who are trapped inside of what

12:01.960 --> 12:11.000
we've been calling the immunomethology, that they need to understand why it is, they need to ask

12:11.000 --> 12:16.200
that question, how can you say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

12:16.200 --> 12:21.560
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb? Try to make that make sense to me,

12:22.360 --> 12:27.720
and then you can draw that very simple picture of the immune system that I've drawn a couple times,

12:28.520 --> 12:38.040
and I think I drew also on Amadmalaik's podcast, which I think will come out maybe tomorrow,

12:39.480 --> 12:45.400
and I think that's my strategy for the next month or so as we move to Halloween,

12:45.400 --> 12:54.920
and through to Thanksgiving, is to try to get people drilled in on that diagram and on that

12:54.920 --> 12:59.080
pitch so that we can also describe how

13:02.760 --> 13:09.880
kids left the game on. I have to get up and turn that off. The way that we can describe this at

13:09.880 --> 13:14.280
the Thanksgiving table, the way that we can describe this to our family and friends over the holidays,

13:14.280 --> 13:18.840
this has to be our strategy. This is the next window of opportunity for us to,

13:19.800 --> 13:25.880
and we're not going to be able to convince everyone. What we're looking to be is ready for that one

13:25.880 --> 13:32.280
person who you hear at the table with some questions, who's able to not completely just keep their

13:32.280 --> 13:40.280
mouth shut, that after dinner, when everybody's, you know, commiserating and loosening the button

13:40.760 --> 13:46.360
on their pants, you can sit down with football and say, hey, I heard what you said at the dinner

13:46.360 --> 13:52.680
table, you know, I've been watching this show and you can tell them where Giga Home is and we can,

13:52.680 --> 13:59.480
we can get them there because this is how we do it. And then in the next six or eight months,

13:59.480 --> 14:06.280
if there's enough of a movement, enough movement of the needle, then people who were good from the

14:06.280 --> 14:13.800
beginning, who were co-opted by force, who were co-opted by national security priorities,

14:14.440 --> 14:20.680
by dudes in suits, some of those people might feel the courage to finally come forward and say,

14:20.680 --> 14:26.920
hey, you're right. This was, we got to do something because that's what we really need to break this,

14:26.920 --> 14:32.440
that's what we really need. And this, I think, is the way to think about it and the way to try and

14:32.520 --> 14:39.720
bring it. If you can understand why this is the right way to say it, or if you can understand

14:39.720 --> 14:47.160
why this is a good way to say it, then you will also be able to explain in a pretty succinct way

14:47.160 --> 14:53.560
why it's a good way to say it. And that's the key to it is that's the key to being able to teach

14:53.560 --> 14:59.080
this, even if you're not a master, but you can make this argument to an immunologist. And if they

14:59.080 --> 15:04.600
know the immunology, they should also know that what you're saying makes sense, wasted too much

15:04.600 --> 15:10.360
time on that, I apologize. So we're trying to go through this people map, and we've been spending a

15:10.360 --> 15:16.200
lot of time watching old videos, and I think it's really paying off, because we found lots of leads,

15:16.920 --> 15:23.880
and we've tipped things in different directions. That little shift down there was not meant so much

15:23.880 --> 15:33.800
as a day gone on RFK Jr. as a promotion of Peter McCollum to the green zone. After my discussion with

15:33.800 --> 15:44.440
him and Denny Rancur, I really feel as though, I guess it's, I don't know how to say his French

15:44.440 --> 15:52.760
last name, but I know his first name is Denny, and it should be really Denny. He is really such a

15:52.760 --> 16:01.080
wonderful orator about this stuff. But I think that one person in particular has made it very clear

16:01.080 --> 16:11.640
that we still need to iron out a little bit of not necessarily what what Denny says or how he says

16:11.640 --> 16:19.320
it, but what he really means and what his data has with respect to looking at all cause mortality

16:19.320 --> 16:26.920
and where the excess all cause mortality comes from. And so we do have work to do, but I think

16:26.920 --> 16:31.400
it's really nice because we've really made this connection, and it's easy for me to pick up the

16:31.400 --> 16:38.600
phone and call Denny. And so we're trying to come up with a sort of succinct way to ask him useful

16:38.600 --> 16:43.800
questions that will really get him to to nail down what his data shows and what his data doesn't,

16:43.800 --> 16:51.720
and maybe even help to him to interpret it in a more biologically relevant way and an

16:51.720 --> 16:58.600
epidemiologically relevant way, given the, given the parameters of the narrative. I don't even know

16:58.600 --> 17:04.200
if I said anything there, I could have been all bullshit. We've also been looking at these

17:04.760 --> 17:10.680
individuals. I did not hear the live broadcast today, but it's my understanding that there was a

17:10.680 --> 17:18.440
live broadcast involving George Webb today, where he was talking about a rassness lab. And I also

17:18.440 --> 17:26.360
mentioned myself and Mark again, we have made very clear connections between George Webb, Robert

17:26.360 --> 17:32.520
Malone, Paul Catrell, and here at funded boss, not all four of them together playing poker, but

17:32.520 --> 17:39.160
rather they're all united by Robert Malone in a very weird way. And Robert Malone has associations

17:39.160 --> 17:50.120
with or has essentially promoted all of these people. And they have promoted him. And this is

17:50.120 --> 17:58.600
really a key sort of observation that might not have happened. Hadn't Mark and I been insistent

17:59.240 --> 18:11.960
about sort of calling Dr. Paul Catrell the fake, what would he say, Dr. Bus Rider MD,

18:11.960 --> 18:20.360
that he is. Now, I don't really want to disparage anyone or to say bad names or make fun. I guess

18:20.360 --> 18:28.840
we can make fun. And so if we make fun of the tall tales and the the tales of woe that that

18:28.840 --> 18:34.680
Paul Catrell shared at the beginning of the pandemic, right mixed in in the context of,

18:34.680 --> 18:39.080
you know, taking secret messages from Taiwan that included that only Remdesivir worked,

18:39.880 --> 18:48.360
and being aware of all of the basic accepted parameters of a red dragon. And also, I don't know,

18:48.360 --> 18:55.000
being being aware of the the other receptors that would claim to bind the spike protein later

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
on in the narrative he was on CD 147 before anyone else, for example. So it's just very strange that

19:03.560 --> 19:09.960
as this little wall of people starts to get flashlights shined on them from the wrong angles,

19:10.520 --> 19:16.840
you start to see the scenery behind them for what it is. And it's starting to appear

19:17.560 --> 19:25.800
as though a lot of this has to do with with the value of intellectual property, the value of stocks,

19:26.360 --> 19:34.840
trading, you know, company values, futures, the value of companies in the future, the value of

19:34.840 --> 19:41.560
patent pools, a lot of stuff that is not anything to do with whether there's a dangerous novel virus

19:41.560 --> 19:51.240
around or not. So we also had these two guys on yesterday as a council fire. I think I have that

19:51.240 --> 19:56.840
here. Yeah. And we're going to try and do a council fire every Monday. I'm trying to figure out if

19:56.840 --> 20:01.160
we're trying to schedule Monday's council fire. We're going to try and have two people on that

20:01.160 --> 20:06.120
haven't met each other before and have a little discussion about the pandemic. And hopefully,

20:06.920 --> 20:11.800
hopefully we'll set some kind of precedence where people will find that exciting and fun and that

20:11.800 --> 20:16.440
I don't have to do anything because all I have to do is say go and those two can have a conversation.

20:18.040 --> 20:23.480
And it's a virtual one and I'll just stoke the fire behind, which I think could work out really well.

20:25.560 --> 20:33.960
So today's show is a little bit about this consensus that I feel like is is really now centered around

20:36.440 --> 20:41.800
it should have been and it should have been centered around how this happened and why they lied.

20:42.680 --> 20:48.440
But instead, the consensus has been forced around the mystery of the

20:49.640 --> 21:00.280
mystery of the origins of the virus. And I find it just sad really that the Nobel Prize

21:00.280 --> 21:04.920
in 2023 in physiology or medicine has been awarded to these two.

21:07.480 --> 21:14.200
For a wide variety of reasons, not the least of which is what Peter McCullough said last night

21:14.200 --> 21:22.680
on our program. And that is that there are some thousands of patents, patented processes,

21:22.680 --> 21:28.440
patented items, patented technologies, patented machines, patented processes

21:28.520 --> 21:36.600
that are involved ultimately in making the 1 billion doses of vaccine that were given out

21:36.600 --> 21:44.200
or whatever it is, 13 billion doses and the 14 million lives that were saved by the vaccine

21:44.200 --> 21:52.280
according to one account. Now the real bummer of this is, is that there is really no honesty

21:52.360 --> 21:59.960
about the biology anymore at all. Did they award them because the RNA lasted even longer than they

21:59.960 --> 22:06.280
thought and the results were even better than they thought they would be? Because it's odd to me that

22:08.680 --> 22:17.160
well, it's odd to everyone, but really not because Robert Malone knew this was a possibility because

22:17.160 --> 22:25.240
we know that from their earliest writings in 2020, especially Jill's writings. We also know

22:25.800 --> 22:31.640
that when he came out, he was talking about being the inventor of this and he still is talking about

22:31.640 --> 22:37.720
being the inventor of this. Gary Cole Wiseman get the Nobel and not for inventing mRNA vaccines

22:37.720 --> 22:43.800
because I did that. But for adding the pseudo-uridine that allowed unlimited spike toxins to be

22:43.800 --> 22:48.200
manufactured and what could have been a safe and effective vaccine platform

22:49.560 --> 23:01.000
if safely developed could have known. So I'm not really sure if Robert Malone understands

23:04.760 --> 23:11.240
what this really does for him, but once and for all it becomes very obvious that

23:13.800 --> 23:19.960
if you're not going to say it out loud, right, that they're bad and that we shouldn't have used

23:19.960 --> 23:28.360
them and that it's not safe if safely developed. What is he talking about? Of course, you know what

23:28.360 --> 23:34.280
he's talking about. He's talking about exactly what he said. We said he was going to do two years ago.

23:34.280 --> 23:43.000
Be sure that this vaccine will not cause long-term. Now the trick here is to realize what they said

23:44.040 --> 23:49.320
because again, going back in time, you can see what they said and if what they said doesn't

23:49.320 --> 23:55.080
jive with what we know in the biology and doesn't jive with what they're now saying,

23:56.120 --> 24:03.880
then they're liars. And if there's anyone that you can watch talk about their science and know

24:03.880 --> 24:11.400
that they're lying, it's this Drew Weisman guy in my humble opinion. It is very frightening to me

24:12.280 --> 24:19.320
how literally smiles. It's very frightening to me how little enthusiasm he has. It's very frightening

24:19.320 --> 24:28.120
to me how little depth there ever is anytime he ever speaks. I've watched hours of him talking

24:28.200 --> 24:34.920
and it never goes past high school level biology. It's almost comical. It says if there's really no

24:34.920 --> 24:42.520
magic at all in RNA, there's nothing complicated to understand about how RNA and ribosomes add up

24:42.520 --> 24:52.600
to proteins. It is extraordinary. And if you want him to distill down the complex pattern

24:53.320 --> 24:58.680
integrity that your body is, that your little cells are individually

25:00.120 --> 25:06.280
and listen to him talk about it in a ridiculously simple, what are we calling it? Dumb simple

25:07.080 --> 25:12.840
in a dumb simple way. So that you think that this just has to work, listen to what he said.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.880
This is like before it's like two years ago.

25:18.760 --> 25:23.720
Negative impact in humans. Like that's one of our big questions that we hear a lot.

25:24.680 --> 25:28.040
So the first is to understand what the vaccine

25:29.400 --> 25:37.160
how so how can we be sure that this vaccine will not cause long term negative impact in humans. Like

25:37.160 --> 25:43.160
that's one of our big questions that we hear a lot. So the first is to understand what the

25:43.160 --> 25:50.120
vaccine is. The mRNA in the vaccine is identical to the RNA in your cells.

25:51.240 --> 25:58.760
So the RNA in your cells isn't causing long term adverse events. So the RNA in the vaccine won't

25:58.760 --> 26:08.120
either. The RNA is degraded probably within a week. It's completely gone. The lipid nanoparticles

26:08.120 --> 26:15.960
contain four types of fat. Two of the fats are identical to what's in our cells. They're physiologic.

26:17.160 --> 26:27.400
The other two are present at incredibly low levels. They are gone within 24 to 48 hours. They're just

26:28.360 --> 26:36.040
the body degrades them. They're gone. So nothing of the vaccine is left after days to a week or so.

26:36.040 --> 26:42.520
The question that comes from then how do you get a long term adverse event? Well you can't

26:42.520 --> 26:50.520
from any components of the vaccine because they're gone. The mRNA does not integrate into the DNA.

26:50.520 --> 26:57.480
It doesn't affect the DNA. It doesn't change the DNA. It doesn't mutate the DNA. It does nothing to

26:57.480 --> 27:05.880
the DNA. So that's one of the social media myths that you have to throw out. It doesn't do anything

27:05.880 --> 27:18.040
to the DNA. It's just hard to imagine how it could have long term effects. 90% of adverse events

27:18.040 --> 27:25.560
the vaccines happen in the first six weeks. We haven't seen anything. 15 million people have

27:25.560 --> 27:36.680
gotten the vaccine already. The only DNA. But so it's just hard to imagine how it could have

27:36.680 --> 27:43.240
long term effects. 90% of adverse events the vaccines happen in the first six weeks.

27:44.760 --> 27:52.200
We haven't seen anything. 15 million people have gotten the vaccine already. The only really

27:52.200 --> 28:00.440
serious adverse event is this anaphylaxis like reaction that we're seeing in about one in 100,000

28:00.440 --> 28:07.160
people. Other than that there really nothing you know 15 million people have been injected.

28:07.160 --> 28:13.000
It's spectacular because he's not reading it. He just talks like this. This Nobel Prize winner

28:13.000 --> 28:21.320
this is as fast as he processes. Even late at night this is as fast as he goes. Even when he knows

28:21.320 --> 28:26.360
he's about to win the Nobel Prize. Even when he's saving he's making more money than he ever

28:26.360 --> 28:37.800
imagined. This is how fast he talks. This is the energy level. You know why? Because there's no

28:37.800 --> 28:44.760
real science in what he's done. Is he a chemist? You know like what what did he do? He figured out

28:44.760 --> 28:54.920
a way to change all the uracils to pseudo uridine like like that's it. We tried a bunch of them.

28:54.920 --> 29:01.240
One of them was really good. One of them caused the least inflammation so we used that one.

29:02.120 --> 29:10.600
Boy aren't we smart. Even the whole idea of using MRNA as a vaccine is not like clever.

29:11.560 --> 29:19.480
I mean I don't want to be a creep but it's not clever. The idea would be of course okay I'll use

29:19.480 --> 29:26.760
MRNA and if the MRNA encodes a foreign protein for like a virus then maybe the immune system will

29:26.760 --> 29:32.920
make a response to it. Well it's pretty in-depth. You're really smart until you think about the

29:33.000 --> 29:39.880
immune response coming in and creating a possibility for autoimmunity.

29:41.960 --> 29:46.840
Until you think about where the transmission occurs and what might happen if it occurs in

29:46.840 --> 29:58.200
X tissue. And so this is the kind of thing the kind of ridiculously dumb really dumb simple stuff

29:58.200 --> 30:01.560
that they were throwing at us from the very beginning. In consensus

30:04.280 --> 30:11.960
not only is it simple for you to understand mouth breather but everybody on social media and

30:11.960 --> 30:21.480
everybody on TV agrees. So how can you possibly go against this illusion of consensus no matter

30:21.480 --> 30:30.840
how dumb it is. No matter how dumb simple it is. It's got four different fats. This MRNA is

30:30.840 --> 30:36.440
the same as your MRNA. He hasn't even gotten to the fact that they're supposed to be protein

30:36.440 --> 30:45.880
expression. The MRNA will be gone in a week or so. So the whole concept of how is the immune

30:45.880 --> 30:52.200
system activated. How is this different than an infection. How is this different than how does

30:52.200 --> 30:58.520
this differ throughout the body. None of these questions are asked. None of them are answered.

30:58.520 --> 31:06.120
None of them are implied or even acknowledged by this Nobel Prize winner. Boy is he really

31:06.120 --> 31:12.600
understand what he's doing doesn't he. He understands it so well he can barely talk about it in depth

31:12.840 --> 31:19.080
which makes the perfect stooge for this kind of operation.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.200
I mean it's terrible to think but you know

31:32.600 --> 31:37.320
a guy that I used to work for named Edward Moser and a woman that I used to work for named

31:37.320 --> 31:42.520
Maybread Moser won the Nobel Prize in 2012 was it.

31:47.720 --> 31:54.760
And that was for a lifetime of work and awarded to another person that they had studied under

31:55.560 --> 32:08.120
John O'Keefe for discoveries over 20 years which led to a pretty reasonably compelling

32:08.120 --> 32:17.560
understanding of how the hippocampus might and code experience somehow. Certainly it's the

32:17.560 --> 32:23.400
most insight that we've purported to have in any part of the brain ever really besides the

32:23.400 --> 32:31.480
visual cortex. And now they're giving Nobel Prizes away for chemistry experiments.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.680
Chemistry experiments that led to profit I guess

32:38.600 --> 32:43.960
with no measurable benefits I guess because the only measurable benefits are

32:44.920 --> 32:47.160
increased all caused mortality Denny.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.080
I mean that's what we see.

32:53.240 --> 32:59.160
So it's still an illusion of consensus because there are people who believe this and say it

33:00.040 --> 33:12.040
and recited to each other in zoom calls on live streams, on talk shows, on news broadcasts,

33:14.840 --> 33:23.560
perfect. Isn't it funny how news broadcasts lately they've added more people and what

33:23.560 --> 33:29.880
they're doing there is they're creating an illusion of consensus. It's four people in agreement

33:29.880 --> 33:37.800
about something so harder for you to disagree with. If it's just one person standing there you

33:37.880 --> 33:44.520
can get in an argument with that guy. Oh whatever whatever Tom Brokaw you don't know what you're

33:44.520 --> 33:50.440
talking about but once it's three people and they're all going yeah yeah that's right oh yeah

33:50.440 --> 33:58.840
you're right too and yes you too Ellen then it's much harder it's subconsciously much harder

33:59.640 --> 34:05.560
to disagree. They figured that out it's a very powerful trick.

34:06.680 --> 34:14.520
Conversations where people come to agreement are mystifying our magical can be enchantments

34:15.640 --> 34:20.840
especially when they are amplified especially when they are repeated especially when they seem

34:20.840 --> 34:24.200
to occur between all these different people.

34:24.520 --> 34:32.040
I mean this kind of nonsense it's just extraordinary what he says in this video

34:33.480 --> 34:42.920
it's the same and yourselves. So the RNA in yourselves isn't causing long-term adverse events

34:42.920 --> 34:50.920
so the RNA in the vaccine won't either. The RNA is degraded probably within a week it's completely

34:50.920 --> 34:56.840
gone. I mean isn't it kind of absurd to think that the gears and the cooking clock

34:57.640 --> 35:02.840
all work together perfectly and none of those gears cause any problems.

35:03.640 --> 35:10.600
So if we just throw like 50 more gears into the clock and shake it around a little bit

35:10.600 --> 35:13.560
the clock will still work fine and nothing will go wrong.

35:13.560 --> 35:22.600
I mean it doesn't even make any sense if you actually understand what biology is as far as

35:22.600 --> 35:32.600
a cell and tissues and organs and an organism is but I mean if you just you know if you understand

35:32.600 --> 35:40.120
biology like a I don't know like a bad eighth grader then maybe you can have this kind of

35:40.200 --> 35:47.880
interpretation where it's just all the same but I mean you know the sugar and the flour

35:47.880 --> 35:54.120
and the yeast and the whatever you put in your bread is in there so if you add a little bit more

35:54.120 --> 36:00.040
it's not going to be a big deal it'll still be bread come on. I mean is this a joke?

36:00.040 --> 36:10.600
That that kind of thinking doesn't work for a bread recipe how in the hell does it work for

36:10.600 --> 36:13.240
RNA in ourselves? Are you joking?

36:16.120 --> 36:22.600
Holy shit numbers. The lipid nanoparticles contain four types of fat.

36:23.560 --> 36:28.360
Two of the fats are identical to what's in our cells they're physiologic.

36:29.080 --> 36:39.240
The other two are present at incredibly low levels they are gone within 24 to 48 hours

36:39.240 --> 36:42.680
they're just the body degrades them they're gone.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.560
They're gone as in they're undetectable.

36:48.840 --> 36:54.280
I have no idea if the body degrades them kids have bad reactions to peg all the time.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.920
I mean it's just extraordinary the kind of arrogance that's here.

36:58.920 --> 37:03.720
So nothing of the vaccine is left after days to a week or so.

37:05.320 --> 37:10.760
The question that comes with how do you get a long-term adverse event? Well you can't from any

37:10.760 --> 37:18.760
components of the vaccine they're gone. The mRNA does not integrate into the DNA it doesn't

37:18.840 --> 37:25.960
affect the DNA it doesn't change the DNA it doesn't mutate the DNA it does nothing to the DNA

37:26.840 --> 37:32.920
so that that's one of the social media myths that that you have to throw out that it doesn't

37:32.920 --> 37:42.920
do anything to the DNA but so you know it's just hard to imagine how it could have long-term effects

37:43.480 --> 37:48.360
90% of adverse events the vaccines happen in the first six weeks.

37:49.880 --> 37:55.080
We haven't seen anything 15 million people have gotten the vaccine already.

37:55.720 --> 38:03.640
The only really serious adverse event is this anaphylaxis like reaction that we're seeing in

38:03.640 --> 38:10.760
about one in a hundred thousand people other than that there really nothing you know 15 million

38:10.760 --> 38:16.680
people have been injected that's that's a lot of people and if we were going to see an unusual

38:16.680 --> 38:25.080
adverse event you know if would you care about something that occurred less than one in 15 billion?

38:29.320 --> 38:33.640
I don't have better I have worse ads than that with the lottery right? Exactly.

38:34.520 --> 38:41.800
Yeah I mean that's a guy who's been convinced I think by someone that that nobody's being hurt

38:45.400 --> 38:51.160
and that he's just convinced that anti-vax people and are crazy people and they can be dismissed

38:52.120 --> 38:54.840
there's no real other way to interpret it he's too

38:56.920 --> 39:02.200
he's too inarticulate and slow not to be inarticulate and slow just like he is

39:03.160 --> 39:09.000
and I think he's just a pawn in this you know he's no he's not sophisticated enough to know

39:09.800 --> 39:15.160
how bad he just sounded there as a biologist I mean it's clear right you would never

39:15.720 --> 39:18.760
no biologist worth their salt whatever say those words

39:20.920 --> 39:29.000
I mean it's just absurd to me and and that's really where we are there's so many people out there

39:29.880 --> 39:32.120
that

39:33.480 --> 39:40.920
they carry a the calling card of a biologist and they just aren't biologists they don't get it

39:42.200 --> 39:47.080
they don't start with the fact that all life on earth is patterned integrity

39:48.040 --> 39:49.560
they don't even know what that means

39:51.400 --> 39:56.520
and they don't start with this idea that there is a complexity at the heart of life which is

39:59.240 --> 40:06.600
it's not dissectable anymore and we can't really simplify it anymore there is a barrier there that

40:06.600 --> 40:15.400
we don't really understand yet because it's too much it's way beyond clockwork and try as we might

40:16.280 --> 40:20.920
that clockwork is going to be impenetrable for us for a very long time and we shouldn't

40:21.560 --> 40:30.040
we shouldn't be enticed by these liars who have been trying to make us believe that

40:32.280 --> 40:36.760
I don't know maybe that's appropriate the sirens but trying to make us believe

40:37.720 --> 40:45.800
that these walls of of mystery these walls of sacred are going to come down very very soon

40:45.800 --> 40:52.360
like in the next five years we're almost there we're going to be able to implant things in your

40:52.360 --> 41:00.040
head and make you smarter it's just ridiculous and it is ridiculous to say that we can inject

41:00.040 --> 41:04.840
some RNA in your arm and augment your immune system and it's absolutely ridiculous

41:06.440 --> 41:13.800
and the idea that this guy is a biologist and he believes the sales pitch that he just gave

41:13.800 --> 41:21.160
is ridiculous something is completely and totally incongruent it's like a pirate who can't swim

41:21.160 --> 41:31.080
it doesn't have a ship I mean then what do you do if this guy gave a biology 101 class without

41:31.080 --> 41:39.480
notes I guarantee you you and I would both know immediately that it's a scam that's the trick

41:39.480 --> 41:47.400
give me a whiteboard and a marker and a room full of guys like him and ask me any question you

41:47.400 --> 41:56.600
want try your hardest that's where we're at here some of these players know that everybody that

41:56.600 --> 42:04.040
they're talking to gives them exceptional credit and so the default is if he's really talking very

42:04.040 --> 42:09.800
simple then it must just be that he thinks that I don't know and so I'm going to be respectful and

42:09.800 --> 42:17.640
not cut him off I'll just let him say stuff and I've had that happen a lot of times on my show where

42:17.640 --> 42:25.000
people start with like you know you know there's a in a way kind of Denny did it last night Denny

42:25.000 --> 42:34.680
was pretty expansive pretty in-depth explained why there was a seasonal component to all cause

42:34.680 --> 42:41.480
mortality but I would assume that that Peter knew that I certainly understood it but maybe that was

42:42.680 --> 42:47.800
you know not understood he already did it for the the audience as well I guess I get that

42:48.840 --> 42:53.640
but we're really talking about some serious baloney here and this goes on you know what our

42:53.640 --> 43:00.360
biggest enemy is in America this is where frankly we know that when we go back remember

43:00.360 --> 43:07.640
that in the context of the rollout of the vaccine where people like the Nobel Prize winners we're

43:07.640 --> 43:14.120
saying that the RNA lasts for a few weeks that nothing is couldn't be safer that all these

43:14.120 --> 43:21.000
components are natural and the other ones are disappearing in no time and that it's protecting

43:21.080 --> 43:28.920
everyone and all sort of stuff at the same time that that illusion of consensus was going on

43:29.480 --> 43:36.040
on television and social media there was an another illusion of consensus going on can't trust the

43:36.040 --> 43:42.520
unvaccinated now is the time to do what you're told this is not the biggest enemy is in America

43:43.320 --> 43:49.400
our fellow Americans frankly we know that we can't trust the unvaccinated now is the time to do

43:50.200 --> 43:57.800
what you're told this is not about freedom or personal choice no screw you freedom apologize

43:57.800 --> 44:04.040
for every variant to come walking around warfully unvaccinated that's iconic

44:05.240 --> 44:13.160
I'm patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us vaccinated

44:13.160 --> 44:18.040
person having a heart attack yes come right on him we'll take care of you unvaccinated guy you

44:18.040 --> 44:24.200
gobbled horse goo rest in peace wheezy you unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals

44:24.760 --> 44:30.200
we're over running emergency rooms in intensive care units leaving no room for someone with a

44:30.200 --> 44:37.560
heart attack or pancreatitis yush muk this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated f*** them f***

44:37.560 --> 44:45.800
their freedom I want my freedom to live you have to be conscious of what happened and remember

44:45.800 --> 44:51.640
exactly how it happened because again there are people who haven't woken up from that spell

44:53.160 --> 44:59.560
there are people who haven't woken up from that spell and think that people who didn't get vaccinated

44:59.560 --> 45:06.440
are still selfish and still lucky that the virus didn't get them still lucky

45:08.120 --> 45:13.800
that they managed not to kill anybody with their selfishness that's what people think

45:14.760 --> 45:22.120
I've heard them say it I've asked them so they have really created the biggest rift

45:22.120 --> 45:29.080
cognitive rift that could be created with regard to this mythology and we are at a very

45:29.080 --> 45:33.880
dangerous tipping point of course with the election in America coming up next year

45:35.240 --> 45:38.200
do you ever think we will find the origins of SARS-CoV-2

45:39.080 --> 45:47.560
what do you think Amy would we find the origins no why is that because we didn't find the origins

45:47.560 --> 45:55.960
of SARS-CoV-1 we found viruses that have pieces of the thing all in one cave but this didn't come

45:55.960 --> 46:04.920
from one cave so no so you think we should keep looking Amy why

46:09.080 --> 46:13.240
I'm asking you I'm just asking I don't under I don't know what the point is

46:14.120 --> 46:21.320
I don't know what the point is to keep looking so first of all as Eddie Holmes has stated numerous

46:21.320 --> 46:28.120
times by the time by the time we got there we the virus has changed so significantly that

46:28.120 --> 46:33.160
it would be hard to even be to determine that it was the origin

46:33.240 --> 46:38.840
I don't see the point in this exercise

46:41.640 --> 46:46.280
that's why Eddie is not a proponent of surveying bats for their viruses right

46:48.440 --> 46:53.800
yeah that's why he says by the time you do it it's all changed yeah but right so what the

46:53.800 --> 46:58.840
point of this exercise so for SARS-CoV-1 it took 10 years to do that they found they found pieces

46:58.840 --> 47:04.840
of the original virus right right but they didn't find the virus no but it's okay you could

47:04.840 --> 47:11.240
find pieces which put together would give SARS-1 so 10 years they found pieces that put together

47:11.240 --> 47:17.160
you could get SARS you could get parts of SARS-CoV-2 it didn't take 10 years yeah but that was in

47:17.160 --> 47:23.320
lough and you know so what how do you know that it didn't it didn't come over the border in the

47:23.400 --> 47:31.880
in on somebody's shoe or in some truck that was bringing some I don't know papayas who knows you

47:31.880 --> 47:36.840
want to frozen food packages came in with SARS-CoV-2 on it that's what China says

47:40.440 --> 47:41.080
Scooby-Doo

47:43.480 --> 47:48.040
when when we in the in the White House when Debbie Birx and I proposed

47:48.920 --> 47:57.000
the 15-day shutdown followed by a 30-day shutdown you may not remember but that was when the

47:58.200 --> 48:05.240
meat packing freezer trucks were parked in front of Elmer's hospital because they I remember because

48:05.240 --> 48:11.320
Paul Catrell was telling us he could see him out his window I remember because Paul Catrell was

48:11.320 --> 48:16.920
telling us almost nightly about it and bragging about how he was in New York so he knew better

48:17.000 --> 48:24.520
than anybody even though he was on the bus to like med school or whatever it was not really

48:24.520 --> 48:29.960
med school but at the stuff you do before med school but I but George Webb says like med school

48:29.960 --> 48:35.320
and doctor and doctor and med school and med school and med school and medical school and medical

48:35.320 --> 48:39.960
school and medical school and medical school and Paul Catrell medical school well I wasn't medical

48:39.960 --> 48:48.600
schools before medical school that's how it's done that's how it's been done for three and a half

48:48.600 --> 48:55.480
years now these people are liars they are spectacularly committed to the lie and anybody

48:56.120 --> 49:05.400
that is onto them or onto the plan has been co-opted by force comfort money drugs I don't know what

49:05.400 --> 49:15.480
professional standing fame travel but I assure you ladies and gentlemen that Pierre Corey for example

49:16.120 --> 49:22.920
is not faking it when he first came out on Brett Weinstein's podcast and was telling the story

49:22.920 --> 49:29.720
about how no one would let him treat anybody in Wisconsin so he went to New York and when he

49:29.800 --> 49:39.240
got to New York what did he meet he met the setup when he got to New York what did he meet he

49:39.240 --> 49:48.920
met the setup he met the setup that was being mystically created in New York with a series of

49:48.920 --> 49:57.560
orders and changes in human behavior never before seen do not resuscitate orders no treating of

49:57.560 --> 50:05.400
pneumonia I mean the list is absurd and included in that is probably probably probably

50:07.240 --> 50:14.040
some doctors that were there and were recruited to tell parts of the story

50:15.400 --> 50:21.960
to tell specific parts of the story and make sure that those parts of the story were amplified

50:22.040 --> 50:30.040
and that they would be amplified if they did or you can disappear or you can be cast out or you

50:30.040 --> 50:35.880
can never practice medicine again or we can do any number of things to you because this is a

50:35.880 --> 50:43.320
national security issue we don't know how bad this virus is going to be remember Peter McCullough

50:43.800 --> 50:51.560
and Pierre Corey were acting at the very beginning of the pandemic so if there was an infectious

50:51.560 --> 50:58.680
clone in the places where people were getting sick or if they were just naive enough

51:00.120 --> 51:06.200
to believe that the illusion of consensus on television and the illusion of consensus in

51:06.200 --> 51:11.960
their meetings with their administrators and the illusion of consensus that they saw in social

51:11.960 --> 51:19.320
media that they decided that that respiratory disease might actually be a new one

51:20.600 --> 51:26.680
that that PCR test might actually be identifying a new one and therefore I better be careful

51:27.960 --> 51:34.200
because rumor has it it might be a lab virus and if that's the case you might not want to get this

51:34.200 --> 51:39.480
one do you not think that that was going on behind the scenes I most assure you it was

51:40.360 --> 51:41.560
because I was part of it

51:45.320 --> 51:48.920
this is where we are at this is how extraordinary things are

51:50.680 --> 51:56.680
because there is an illusion that was set from the very beginning used behind the scenes to scare

51:56.680 --> 51:59.800
people into being less brave

52:02.200 --> 52:07.400
scaring people behind the scenes at congress scaring the people behind the scenes in secret

52:07.400 --> 52:11.400
meetings scaring people behind the scenes at ground zero

52:14.520 --> 52:19.240
and that's how you get people on board that's how you co-opt

52:22.840 --> 52:28.360
you get them as part of the actual national security operation

52:30.680 --> 52:31.880
co-opt them as leaders

52:32.280 --> 52:37.880
now this guy's not aware of all that going on because he's also being used

52:40.760 --> 52:46.200
I think he's been used for a very very very long time and eventually he must have become aware

52:46.200 --> 52:50.520
that he's being used but I think it's one of those lookaway doctrine type things

52:52.120 --> 52:59.080
where he knows that the governing powers of the world have been using him and others to do this

52:59.160 --> 53:05.400
but you know they're going to take care of my family if I shut my mouth and just keep doing this

53:06.120 --> 53:11.720
they're going to take care of my family that's where we're at this is for all the marbles there's

53:11.720 --> 53:17.800
no more games and so you can start thinking of you should have started thinking of people's behavior

53:17.800 --> 53:25.080
in this context a while ago it's for all the marbles a few lies here and there when everybody

53:25.080 --> 53:30.840
else in the whole world is telling lies it's pretty enticing

53:35.640 --> 53:43.080
how to put the bodies in there because the morgues were overflowing the same thing was seen in boston

53:43.080 --> 53:50.520
in front of mass general and the Brigham so when you have a tsunami of cases where you have to shut

53:50.600 --> 53:58.120
it off immediately you can't say let's wait x number of months until we get a vaccine or let's

53:58.120 --> 54:03.080
wait x number of months until we do this when you're running out of hospital beds and you're

54:03.080 --> 54:08.200
running out of ventilates you got to do something draconian because otherwise there would have been

54:08.200 --> 54:18.040
a lot more lives lost however you've got to balance that and continually testing whether

54:18.600 --> 54:22.440
it's still worth luck you could even see the AIDS

54:23.400 --> 54:31.640
AIDS thing as a as a test run of this operation let's try it with the gays because nobody cares

54:31.640 --> 54:36.280
about them nobody's gonna speak up for them we'll do this practice epidemic

54:38.280 --> 54:45.320
and then the real one is this one and it's all the same nonsense we had to shut it down you see his

54:46.200 --> 54:51.800
his arm movement there we had to just shut it down because there was a tsunami of cases

54:52.760 --> 54:58.600
a tsunami of cases created by panic on television and a nonspecific PCR test

54:59.400 --> 55:06.360
and liars on tv liars on social media liars that were coordinated and committed

55:07.000 --> 55:17.640
coordinated to a lie about bioweapons about vaccine leaks about AIDS vaccine leaks about

55:18.920 --> 55:27.080
what was it uh i don't know d oh i can't even remember anymore it's just so crazy how much of

55:27.080 --> 55:35.800
these these narratives all weave together now from this in retrospect uh retrospect is always

55:35.880 --> 55:42.920
2020 hindsight is always 2020 and it is just extraordinary what you can see if you look back

55:42.920 --> 55:50.520
the pattern is there and it is crystal clear they wove this story from the very beginning

55:50.520 --> 55:54.680
and they used it from the very beginning when it was necessary in the beginning they used it to

55:54.680 --> 55:59.960
scare people when it was necessary they used it in the beginning to get everybody in line

56:00.040 --> 56:08.440
and now they're using it to perpetuate the need to perpetuate the danger to perpetuate the threat

56:09.160 --> 56:15.560
no not dissimilar to what they did with the war on terror but now this one affects everybody

56:17.960 --> 56:23.320
it doesn't matter what country you're in it doesn't matter what songs you sing it doesn't

56:23.320 --> 56:31.400
matter what church you go to or what books you read you need to fear this and you need to fear

56:31.400 --> 56:39.560
climate change king down the initial lockdown reason was a life-saving reason how long you close

56:39.560 --> 56:46.920
the school how long you do you know you diminish activities on the outside has to be a dynamic

56:46.920 --> 56:53.960
process which you've got to evaluate in real time now is the risk benefit still in favor

56:54.600 --> 57:01.000
of restriction or is the risk benefit leading much more towards loosening up and that's what's

57:01.000 --> 57:06.200
going to be interesting because we're going to go back and examine that is worth things done

57:06.200 --> 57:14.680
too long or not but the initial decision to lock things down unequivocally saved a lot of lives

57:14.680 --> 57:23.800
no doubt about that not even close what did he just say lock things down unequivocally

57:23.800 --> 57:31.160
but the initial decision to lock things down unequivocally saved a lot of lives no doubt about

57:31.160 --> 57:40.760
that not even close it's a pretty extraordinary statement and when he says it and people listen

57:40.920 --> 57:47.000
and agree and an audience like that it's an illusion of consensus not that is similar to

57:47.560 --> 57:56.680
studio audience laughter in a sitcom that's also of course true with covid right we are all

57:56.680 --> 58:02.200
only as healthy as our neighbor is on our street and our city and our region and our nation and

58:02.200 --> 58:07.480
globally and did we solve that like did we actually manage to vaccinate everyone in the world no

58:08.040 --> 58:13.640
so highlighting water as a global commons and what it means to work together and see it both

58:13.640 --> 58:17.640
out of that kind of global commons perspective but also the self-interest perspective because it

58:17.640 --> 58:21.640
is it does have that parallel it's not only important but it's also important because we

58:21.640 --> 58:27.000
haven't managed to solve those problems which which had similar attributes and water is something

58:27.000 --> 58:31.480
that people understand you know climate change is a bit abstract some people understand it really

58:31.480 --> 58:36.840
well some understand it a bit some just don't understand it water every kid knows how important

58:36.920 --> 58:40.280
it is to have water when you're playing football and you're thirsty you need water

58:40.280 --> 58:44.280
so there's also something about really getting citizen engagement around this and really

58:44.920 --> 58:49.160
in some ways experimenting with this notion of the common good can we actually deliver

58:49.160 --> 58:53.960
this time in ways that we have failed miserably other times and hopefully we won't keep failing

58:53.960 --> 59:01.560
on the other things but anyway i'm not even really sure what that was

59:01.880 --> 59:08.920
but they want the water of course that's one of the resources. Hi everyone Dr. Mandy Cohen

59:08.920 --> 59:14.440
from CDC and wanted to tell you about some new data that was just released by the CDC

59:14.440 --> 59:21.000
which adds to the evidence that vaccinations during pregnancy helps protect patients and newborns

59:21.640 --> 59:26.280
today i'm going to answer a few questions about getting vaccinated when you're pregnant first

59:26.280 --> 59:34.040
question when during pregnancy should a person get a COVID-19 flu and RSV vaccine

59:35.160 --> 59:41.640
so the COVID and flu vaccines are recommended for everyone over six months and that includes

59:41.640 --> 59:47.960
moms who are pregnant you can get a COVID or flu vaccine at any point during pregnancy

59:48.600 --> 59:54.920
for the RSV vaccine you can get that vaccine if you are between 32 to 36 weeks pregnant

59:55.720 --> 59:59.880
what is this necklace can you tell me what this is

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.560
and the second question i really have is this is not dissimilar to Drew Weisman

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.240
this is a person who in all the videos you'll ever find she doesn't get past eighth grade level

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:24.280
biology like all of them if you go back and look at Fauci when he was younger

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.760
or you look at interviews from the 90s he actually talks fairly in depth about the failures of

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.200
vaccines and why they didn't work for HIV and the complexity of HIV and the complexity of

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:45.240
virology the complexity of the immune system and its challenge to recognize a changing viral target

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.000
and so he's able to at least articulate why it is that he was having so much trouble and why he was

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.040
failing all the time with coming up with a cure

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:02.520
now we've dumbed simple it's so much that there's nothing to really argue about because it's so dumb

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:10.600
simple just get it it's fine we have data that shows just get it it's fine you know there wasn't

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.160
data before now there's data what are you gonna argue there's data we have data that shows

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.560
we have p values that show

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.640
and this is the kind of coercion that's going to go on and on and on as they try to mislead the

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:33.000
younger the next and the next years i don't know we've got to really

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.720
i think we've really got to think hard about what's coming up in the next few months and be

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.360
really aware of of how far they're going to push it because this is this is a person without the

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:55.960
expertise to be where she is and that's on purpose because the people that are actually running this

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.320
wanted exactly like that and we have to come to understand what's going on here you really do

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.800
get vaccinated during pregnancy you pass on your antibodies to your baby and they are born with

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.880
some protection through your vaccination this is great news for keeping yourself as healthy as

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.080
possible during pregnancy and to protect the health of your baby and what they're saying there is

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.680
antibodies right they can detect antibodies that's all they're talking about it antibodies equal

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:36.280
immunity so mom makes antibodies to vaccine mom is immune antibodies show up in breast milk

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:46.920
mom passes immunity on to baby mom could also pass antibodies which make the baby very sick when

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:55.960
she is exposed to the RNA and the proteins of the virus in question and that is not

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.000
a rare event it's happened often with RNA viruses in the past

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:10.760
and so without precedence a single observation for a short period of time is enough to dismiss

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:18.360
all of previous assumptions in biology all in previous basically theories in biology or

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:26.200
hypotheses in biology about how to respect the sacredness of the developing fetus inside of a

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:35.880
pregnant woman and moving the shot to the third drymaster is simply insufficient given what we know

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.800
it's a wonderful wonderful thing though to hear these people really

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:56.280
because they're just so off they're just so off they wouldn't pass a year 2019 graduate school

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:05.240
basic entry exam at a whiteboard ever none of these people would that's the extraordinary thing

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:14.520
you know they would get they would go like dna his tres his RNA and then RNA becomes protein

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:25.480
that's how stuff works and cells are surrounded by lipids and ribosomes make proteins and sometimes

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:33.640
the ribosomes are in a er which stands for endoplasmic reticulum and dna stands for deoxyribal nucleic

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:41.800
acid so i'm really smart and it's it's it's ridiculous and they treat

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:52.280
they are purposefully speaking in these terms as if it's it's obviously beyond your pay grade to

01:04:52.280 --> 01:05:01.400
be told anymore so that's how i'm going to talk to you and it's it's exactly how this was pulled

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:07.400
off an illusion of consensus from the very beginning led by fauci and others

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:17.000
an illusion of consensus that also had this undercurrent of a lab virus and the undercurrent of a lab

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.240
virus was able to mystify people behind the scenes scare people into falling in line with the

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:32.840
with the national security priority and it took a very long time before that was going to be

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:38.280
questioned because the only person that was only people that were really questioning it were who

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.240
the people that said there were no viruses at all

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:52.440
and so the illusion of consensus was very powerful it kept almost everyone almost everyone from

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:58.200
questioning the concept that there could be an RNA sequence that could do this

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.000
all of us

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:10.520
now that's what's impressive it's not the idea the idea is silly but it's impressive that they

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:19.480
were able to convince us all that a RNA molecule endowed with the right sequence is capable of

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:27.480
circling the globe for years and disrupting everything that we knew as our global economy

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:36.440
disrupting our health care systems and fundamentally changing how we think about our place on the

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:44.920
planet it's just absurd and yet they've done it and they're sustaining it by misleading all of the

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:51.080
young because there are very few kids that watch this program there are very few kids that understand

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:57.720
this there are very few kids that really get it i don't even know if my kids fully get it and they

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:06.040
hear it every night at the table from me i don't know do we need to listen to the rest of that lady

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.880
do you want to hear that maybe you want to hear that

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.120
this is great news for keeping yourself as healthy as possible during pregnancy and to protect the

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:29.480
health of your baby next question is getting vaccinated for covid flu and rsv during pregnancy

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:36.520
safe for me and my baby another great question and one a lot of people are asking the answer is

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:43.720
yes getting the covid flu and rsv vaccine during pregnancy is safe for you that is extraordinary

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:53.560
they are man wanted that to pause that's really extraordinary getting vaccinated for covid 19

01:07:53.560 --> 01:08:00.920
flu and rsv during pregnancy safe for me and my baby and the answer is yes that is just

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:08.120
that's all you need to know the sacred is gone you know the one nine months where you're not

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:17.080
supposed to do anything you don't even put makeup on are you joking are you joking

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:25.000
but you know why not she probably believes that Drew Weissman is not a liar

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:32.120
Drew Weissman knows how his Nobel Prize winning mRNA works and he says it's only in there for a

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:39.880
few days and it's just the same as every mRNA that we have and it's only four fats and the

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:49.320
other two that aren't are natural are gone in days maybe hours and she probably believes that too

01:08:51.080 --> 01:09:00.680
that's the whole reason why this works because their biology is so shallow that they bought it

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.520
and I know it seems crazy that the Nobel Prize winner would have that level of but but it's

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.680
evident to go watch his videos try to find one if you find a good one send it to me

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.440
find me the most complex lecture that you can find Drew Weissman giving

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:29.160
it'll be the same as Mandy there's nothing it is just comical these people are are something

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:37.480
being used to govern us I don't know who's winningly and unwittingly involved but we are

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:43.640
being governed by an elaborate mythology being pushed by people who are either too

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:52.600
unsophisticated to know don't want to know don't mind not knowing knowing that they're on the

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:01.240
winning team and some of them are probably eugenics eugenicists some of them are probably worse

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:11.000
but a lot of them are just in it to win it and they've been told who the winning team is going to be

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.520
and it's pretty obvious to them that they might be right so they said what the hell

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.880
the sales pitch is really easy if you don't do it the next person I offer it to is going to do it

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:29.560
it's just that I've never gotten that offer mark use eugenics never gotten that offer no one's

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:36.120
ever shown up with suitcase full of money and four wheelers and a deed to a farm

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.160
but if they did I would ask for two of everything

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.920
and if I got it I don't know what I would do

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.480
I'm sure that all these people have been offered something

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:55.240
if not just you know you can be the famous CDC director

01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:02.120
pregnancy safe for me and my baby another great question and one a lot of people are asking

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:08.200
the answer is yes getting the COVID flu and RSV vaccine during pregnancy is safe for you

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.360
and your baby the vaccines have not been linked to any increased risk of negative effects during

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:20.040
pregnancy or for the baby and the good news is when you get vaccinated during pregnancy

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:25.240
you pass on your antibodies to your baby and they're born with some protection through your

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:35.480
vaccination so you know not a real great biology lesson there but it's a great sales pitch

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.000
and that sales pitch is for this right the sales pitch is for a virus that's definitely worth

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.560
emergency use authorizations and a virus that's dangerous enough that's definitely

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:57.560
means that shutting down saved so many people and that's transfecting people to a spike

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:04.840
protein saved so many people and it's the illusion of consensus that this is true

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.360
that has gotten us here that made it possible

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:20.600
and the laughter that you hear signifies the story of the of the worst-case scenario

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:28.520
that was percolating in the background that this is a lab leak bio-weapon vaccine gone wrong

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:35.800
de attenuating virus that was the word i was looking for before de attenuating virus

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:43.800
so it was an attenuated virus and it was made to be a it was made to be a an AIDS vaccine

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:49.000
and then it like got out and now it's totally like reverting and now once it reverts it's going to

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.040
be like flying AIDS and if you remove the illusion of consensus the whole story sounds stupid

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:11.320
because in RNA molecule with a couple extra amino acids like PRSS in the final protein or

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:25.480
whatever a protein with four extra amino acids is not going to endow an RNA molecule with the

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:32.600
ability to replicate perfectly to suddenly not travel the way it has always traveled to way

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:40.200
is a is a barely a phantom of a signal in biology

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.840
so it's extraordinary to me that as we make progress in this narrative

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:54.120
and we see through these this elaborate show what it really comes down to is this illusion

01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:00.040
of consensus of the virus we had to do something that the mRNA was pretty useful but it could have

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.960
been damn well better and because this was likely a gain of function virus this will most certainly

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:15.640
come again they're even pushing now that old narrative about the idea that that you don't want

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.280
to get infected at all because every time you get infected it's an added you know added again

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.760
and added again and added again and so what does that narrative do that narrative almost

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.920
without saying it suggests that you should get vaccinated over and over again to avoid

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:39.320
get infected over and over again infection in that model is defined by what PCR

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:49.000
is defined by what symptoms so it's all circular logic of nonsense as long as you believe in the

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.840
virus as long as you believe that something special is circulating you need a laugh track

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.800
because if you don't have a laugh track nobody will follow along nobody will believe you and the

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:11.640
laugh track is created by social media and the promotion of the wrong people promotion of people

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:17.480
that will provide the track laughter or more importantly warm question the script

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:30.360
they created an illusion of consensus around a virus around the need to do something drastic

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.760
because you know it's a freaking lab leak most likely we can't tell everybody this

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.960
because when we tell everybody this they'll panic

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:46.840
and so you need to shut your hole about it until next year and then next year we'll roll that out

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.120
where you know they're going to fight about it in front of congress and we'll leak some emails

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.560
and it'll slowly become obvious but we can't tell everybody in February that this is a lab leak

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:06.440
or we'll have bedlam so we're going to control up this we're going to ease it into them

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.880
and this easing in will result in them convincing themselves and maybe this was a lab leak so we

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:21.240
better done do what we better listen do what we're told and that incongruency was seen in their

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.520
behavior if you say it's a natural virus but we got it locked down like right now

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:34.600
or we're not going to save any lives that doesn't really make sense that's how I saw it if it's a

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.800
natural virus from a bad cable what do we got to worry about nothing really

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.240
and we have previous immunity so you know I don't really see the panic but if it's a lab leak maybe

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:53.320
that's why they're panicking that made sense to me and it wasn't until three years later that I

01:16:53.320 --> 01:17:02.360
learned enough virology and more importantly read enough about the molecular biology in virology to

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.160
understand what their claims were and once you understand what their claims were

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.840
you can understand how in the context of previous virology and virological limits

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.880
their claims didn't make any sense unless they use clones

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.960
and that's when this illusion of consensus became very obvious to me because once I started talking

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:34.600
about clones most of these people started ignoring me started attacking me started saying I was a

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:41.560
divider started saying whatever and whatnot because this illusion of consensus was about to be disturbed

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:48.120
because I was pointing out that we've been fooled into solving this mystery by all these people

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:58.360
and in so doing we allowed this change in how we think to occur because you know we bought into

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:07.720
the novelty of this whole thing as long as there's a new the virus then all bets were off that was

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:15.720
the sales pitch but it's a new virus so we don't know I mean it's a new car we don't know how fast

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.280
it'll go or how it works or whether you put gas in it or not I mean it's a whole new thing

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.320
we have no idea how it works we don't even know if it's got doors

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.000
and since this new car is out there you're gonna have to stay in your house not drive for a while

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.600
until we we see where this thing spreads it's a new car we don't know anything about it it's not a

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.560
very good analogy except for the idea that it's a new virus that we don't know anything about

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:51.320
our immune system that has been building immune memory to all the RNA that we've ever been

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:57.080
exposed to all the self-replicating RNA we've ever been exposed to now suddenly there's a new one

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:06.360
and it's so new that everybody's vulnerable it was just the worst story ever and then along with

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:12.120
that they dumbed out our immunology they made sure that everybody bought into the

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.480
i-m-m-u-n-i-t-y that's what I got body's anti-crap

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:26.280
antibodies equal immunity was the illusion that I've been trying to dispel since 2020

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.520
with a slide that said exactly that should go back to one of those old slides that sometime

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:41.160
and see how far on we were and so then on this scooby-doo we are you know we ventilated people

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:47.640
whoops we ventilated people were emdesivir medazalam untreated pneumonia

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.440
and so rolling in flu deaths as covid deaths doesn't increase all cause mortality

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:04.920
you've got to kill people that's what the protocols did that's what the extra opioid deaths did

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:11.320
that's what all the extra deaths that they did you've got to spread them out as much as possible

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:19.080
everything goes up and then the excess deaths equal covid and now what we really need to get

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.840
Denny Rancour to understand that and be able to articulate that quickly and succinctly

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:31.640
because he's really close and he said it to Peter McCullough isn't it strange that the excess

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.280
deaths are exactly equal to covid almost like they're telling us a story because that's what

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:46.040
they are doing the music from the game is surprisingly appropriate tonight it's almost like i got a

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:52.360
sound guy back there i don't know if you can hear that you might not be able to hear that

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:59.800
so they've lied to us about this pandemic potential but even worse they've created an illusion of

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:08.440
consensus about it and the illusion of consensus about gain of function in the background is

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:15.560
ultimately what keeps everybody pinned to the narrative it's really the faith this is like the

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:23.320
you know the the mystery of all the mysteries and belief that we can

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:32.680
endow viruses with pandemic potential that we can endow viruses with pandemic potential is the faith

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:43.480
because that is a baby sized version of the faith that we can change the human genome we can

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:51.480
make personalized medicine we can cure genetic diseases we can take control of our destiny

01:21:53.160 --> 01:22:01.960
it's a little tiny microcosm of that little little seed version of that idea we can do this

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.640
soon we'll be able to do it for everything

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:16.600
kymeric viruses are so 2020 we're making kymeric fake synthetic bacteria now

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:24.680
soon we're going to make synthetic organisms made of silicon all these other stories that they will

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:33.000
tell us this is the beginning this is like the little gateway drug idea we can stitch together

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.760
RNA and make it pandemic that's the faith

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.760
and the illusion of consensus that got us here is this idea that we've got to figure out whether

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:52.360
it's a natural virus with this incredible superpower or whether it's a lab virus with this incredible

01:22:52.360 --> 01:23:00.840
superpower and that mystery completely obfuscates the idea that we have always known that RNA can't do

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:07.240
this and that's what made it so hard to study RNA viruses for so long in the lab

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.760
and the only way we've been able to kind of overcome it is to make these RNA sequences

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:22.280
from scratch or with synthetic recombinant mechanized methodologies and then if we you know do some

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:32.440
laboratory experiments it seems to kind of do stuff and move around and transmit from an animal

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:37.960
to an animal if we take stuff out of one animal and squirt it in the other animal

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.600
an illusion of consensus ladies and gentlemen

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.600
it's really a conflated background single it doesn't matter whether it's an endemic virus

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.680
a background coronavirus if you want to call it that protocols are murder and

01:23:52.680 --> 01:24:00.840
transmission is not medicine if you want to call it an infectious clone release because you really

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.880
are convinced that there was a real molecular signal and lots of people identified around the

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.480
world this is the way it was done if you want to call it a transfection agent release i think

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:18.360
that's also a very valid way to call it because again using RNA to express protein in in cells

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.280
where it's not normally expressing it is called transfection and so if you spray it in people's

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.080
lungs or put it on their skin or put it in their food or whatever they would have done with it

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.120
if that RNA ends up transcribing protein sorry being translated into

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:45.720
what you know transcribed if it makes protein then you've

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.640
transfected that animal that human that whatever and so again it's it doesn't really matter what

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:59.160
you call it as long as you call it something as long as you say that the protocols were murder

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:07.720
and that that transfection is in medicine it's totally okay but no viruses discounts

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:16.200
the many many many many many many many many many many known synthetic options for

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.760
transfection and transformation it ignores that we can really make

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.040
adenoviruses like little particles that have stuff inside of them we can make those we can't

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:35.960
make them with great purity but we can make those we can make lipid nanoparticles in small nanoparticles

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:43.480
and and other lipid droplets that contain RNA in them and that can allow transfection

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.800
and in the coming week I think I've just been gifted a whole truckload of of new ideas and

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.640
things to talk about this week and a lot of it has to do with these ideas these

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.800
the concept of transfection has been patented more than you know

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:08.920
and the number of patents that are involved in this patent pool which likely underlies this

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.400
release of military technology to the world of pharmaceutical industries

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.760
change in patent law all this stuff is happening behind the scenes while we're arguing about is

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:31.320
there a virus or not and while we're arguing about you know whether it was a lab leak or a natural

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.200
virus or whether they're no virus people and that's all that's silly doesn't matter at all

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.080
the protocols for murder transfection isn't medicine and they are trying to reorganize

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.040
the intellectual property space around the entire biopharmaceutical industry

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:56.440
and that reorganization is expressing itself and is visible in the way that the pandemic

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.080
technologies have been rolled out and the way the the direction of this entire

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:08.360
industry is going and we're going to be able to expose it we're going to be able to show it

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.360
and so we're going to be able to see how this had to have been planned it's an orchestrated

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:21.960
pivot and the pivot may be a couple different parties that are involved in responding to the

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.840
pivot but it's more than likely that all the parties involved are aware that the pivot is

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:35.000
going to happen and it's not isolated to this one thing but it is one one of one of the things

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.520
that many of the dissident characters that we've been following for three years have to be involved

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:51.320
in it's almost impossible that that's not the heart of of what is really happening here with

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.840
with all these people maps that we've been watching and thinking about

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:05.720
so it was definitely a a orchestrated novel virus idea that's spread around the world by

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:11.160
incentive spread around the world by previous drilling and pre-programmed responses

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:19.880
spread around by fear and rumor about a lab leak and the potential of what a lab leak could do

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:26.440
versus what a regular virus would do and the perpetuation of the worst-case scenario idea that

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:32.360
we know nothing we can do nothing we have nothing and this thing's going to kill 3.4 percent from

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:40.520
everybody that infects and that illusion only needed to last for so long in so many people in

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:46.520
order for this to have occurred it only had to be perpetuated for so long on tv in order for this

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:53.000
to occur and now we're here and if we're going to get out we have to actively free

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.640
our fellow citizens from this illusion as many of them that are willing to take a lifeline

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:11.560
and so over the next coming weeks we are going to re-examine we are going to re-examine immunology

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:17.960
101 a few times we are going to get good at making a few simple diagrams together

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:25.800
and we are going to get good at elevator pitches about this lying scenario we're going to collaborate

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.280
hopefully with michael yeden and a few other people we're going to have council fires on every

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:38.040
monday that we can and uh we're going to keep bringing people together and trying to create a

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:47.080
new consensus that isn't an illusion because we are at a time point where um

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:56.520
um our our governance the people that are that believe themselves are currently are in control

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:04.600
of world governance are making changes and they're making changes for a wide variety of reasons

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:11.480
and we need to go in eyes wide open and the first thing is we need to get out of this cave

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.640
whoa what's this why didn't they play something isn't right

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:24.680
but that didn't work right what in the heck

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.920
why didn't that work that's strange we try that again

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.960
there we go so you can visit gig ombiological.com

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:54.040
if you scroll down from the front page you can find a place where you can subscribe at various

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.280
levels if you really want to support the stream um but the best way to do it is to share

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:05.000
um you can also join the conversation there at gig omb.bio um it's kind of like a

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.800
twitter but just for us um but it's accessible to everybody and uh you can support my work there

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.680
if you feel the need to donate one time or would like to donate one time that's one place to do

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:23.160
it as well and i thank everybody that has done it in the past um intramuscular injection of any

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:27.880
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb short way of saying

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:34.920
that for now his transaction is not immunization so Nobel prize was awarded we knew that was

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.560
going to happen we predicted it um step all transfections and humans because they're trying

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.360
to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:53.880
and that is the show don't forget to share the broken science initiative um and uh yeah

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.200
this has been gig ombiological high resistance low noise information stream brought to you by

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:08.280
biologists my name is Jonathan Cooey thanks very much um we're going to try and get a weekly

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:16.440
rhythm where we do journal club where we do a question and answer kind of open forum kind of

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:24.760
thing where we do a council fire and where we do the fire hose kind of thing like this and where

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:33.640
we do watch along so it should be like five kinds of shows or five kinds of daily streams

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:39.560
which will make it a little easier for me to keep the pace up um but it also keep it a little variable

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:46.200
and then after all this talk i just wanted to put my money where my mouth is and let you know that

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.280
it's taken me a long time to figure out how to do it and and what the story will be but i think

01:32:52.280 --> 01:33:02.360
we finally got it and so on the halloween i will be streaming for on and off most of the day

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:09.320
um certainly after work hours i can't remember what day it is during the week

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:22.120
and i will be streaming to you live from a from a from the deck of the starship

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:29.240
enterprise and i think halloween is the Tuesday night okay so it'll be like after five on Tuesday

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:35.160
i'll probably be streaming for like five hours from the enterprise as a kick off of that star

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:45.080
track that i promised you a long time ago so look forward to that see you soon
