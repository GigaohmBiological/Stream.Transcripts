00:34.178 --> 00:47.708
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

00:47.848 --> 00:54.914
I don't know crash the dollar I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value we have left.

00:55.114 --> 00:58.176
I don't know But I know for sure

00:58.561 --> 01:16.009
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

01:18.127 --> 01:24.872
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:25.292 --> 01:28.335
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:28.415 --> 01:37.862
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:37.882 --> 01:44.487
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:20.033 --> 02:48.030
I've been selling my soul Working all day Overtime hours For bullshit pay So I can sit out here And waste my life away Drag back home And drown my troubles away It's a damn shame What the world's gotten to For people like me For people like you Wish I could just wake up And it not be true But it is

02:49.466 --> 02:54.752
Oh, it is living in the new world with an old soul.

02:59.227 --> 03:21.623
Rich man north of Richmond Lord knows they all just want to have total control Want to know what you think Want to know what you do And they don't think you know But I know that you do Cause your dollar ain't shit And it's taxed to no end North of Richmond North of Richmond

03:30.387 --> 03:45.141
Wish politicians would look out for miners And not just miners on an island somewhere Lord, we got folks in the street Ain't got nothing to eat And the obese milking welfare

03:46.002 --> 03:53.852
Well, God, if you're five foot three and you're 300 pounds, taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds.

03:54.053 --> 04:02.043
Young men are putting themselves six feet in the ground, because all this damn country does is keep on kicking them down.

04:03.294 --> 04:11.562
Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to for people like me, for people like you.

04:11.602 --> 04:15.205
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.

04:15.646 --> 04:16.346
But it is.

04:16.847 --> 04:18.328
Oh, it is.

04:19.089 --> 04:25.155
Living in a new world with an old soul.

05:08.078 --> 05:16.366
I've been selling my soul, working all day, overtime hours for bullshit pay.

05:46.968 --> 05:48.969
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

05:50.029 --> 05:54.771
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:56.191 --> 05:57.892
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:59.548 --> 06:00.250
It's embarrassing.

06:24.861 --> 06:26.162
Good morning, everybody.

06:26.322 --> 06:35.789
It is 1018 from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where your consciousness is still the prime real estate that these charlatans are competing to occupy.

06:36.830 --> 06:46.638
Don't forget the kind of enchantment that was cast on us with cartoons and crazy drawings and oversimplified models of how the world works.

06:47.218 --> 06:51.542
These are how these charlatans have managed to maintain power over us.

06:52.242 --> 06:54.783
since our parents, but it's not just these guys.

06:55.684 --> 06:57.065
It's also these guys.

06:57.545 --> 07:03.168
You've got to realize that we've been had by social media in a way that was exactly the opposite.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.669
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

07:05.689 --> 07:08.351
I used to be an academy magician trying to chase tenure.

07:09.091 --> 07:11.633
I spent 20 years as a patch clamp physiologist.

07:11.653 --> 07:22.501
GigaOM Biological's name is derived from the high resistance, low noise seal that I use to record from individual and groups of neurons in the brain slices of mice and monkeys.

07:23.162 --> 07:31.708
And I bring the ability to read and think deeply about how biology has been contorted.

07:32.645 --> 07:38.330
to represent something rather than an incredible complexity that we just barely can scratch the surface of.

07:39.150 --> 07:48.858
Science has been used to create the illusion that we have a high-fidelity understanding of ourselves and the biology that defines us, and that's definitely not true.

07:49.879 --> 08:09.892
And through the course of the journey of waking up during COVID, I went from being an Academy magician thinking that tenure was the ultimate touchdown that I could score for my family and for my life's work to believing that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:10.552 --> 08:17.657
Transpection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

08:17.717 --> 08:18.558
It's that simple.

08:19.198 --> 08:35.610
And if we start to force people to argue about this, we can also, I think, get people to usefully reflect on the idea that the mystery virus doesn't explain what has happened over the last five and 10 years where public health has started to be distorted in such a way so that

08:36.431 --> 09:05.186
A mystery virus or the illusion of it could be created by a whole long list of bad ideas that included things as diabolical as high flow supplementary oxygen given to people who read as having a low pulse ox on some $5 device sold on Amazon, all the way down to motivated financial incentives that led to PCR fraud, lateral flow test fraud, track and trace fraud, masks, closures, mandates, and even death certificate fraud.

09:06.046 --> 09:19.275
all to try and use and take advantage of the opening that was created by this national security operation that even needed to use opioid deaths and an extraordinary rise in them to create this illusion.

09:19.876 --> 09:35.066
And this illusion, of course, is not backed by any epidemiological evidence of spread, and it's not backed or challenged usefully by any lawyers that can speak of strict liability or what the Seventh Amendment might or might not mean with regard to some of the laws.

09:35.746 --> 09:37.707
that underpin these emergencies.

09:39.468 --> 09:55.718
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to do a new consensus about the fact that a national security state or a global group of weaponized piles of money would definitely, most definitely, most definitely would use murder and lies in order to cover up the following statements.

09:56.278 --> 10:01.959
They would use murder and lies to cover up the fact that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

10:02.439 --> 10:10.021
They would use murder and lies to cover up the fact that the vaccine schedule in the USA was always criminal enterprise even before the pandemic.

10:10.581 --> 10:22.543
And yes, they would use murder and lies to get us to teach our children that RNA and viruses are dangerous, but RNA cannot pandemic, so they needed to murder and lie about it in order to

10:23.343 --> 10:26.967
in order to try and seed that illusion for another generation or two.

10:27.988 --> 10:43.343
And I am making the very bold statement that a lot more people than we imagined in 2020, and in 2021, and in 2022, many more people than we imagined are involved in sustaining this illusion.

10:43.383 --> 10:44.524
It's not just

10:45.305 --> 10:49.788
It's not just the people down here that were on the PBS NewsHour and on BBC.

10:50.328 --> 11:04.736
It's also the people over here that have a career of serving the interests of the national security state by sustaining the illusion of the danger of bioweapons and the danger of gain-of-function viruses.

11:05.436 --> 11:09.637
and even natural pandemics potential that is found in bat caves.

11:09.697 --> 11:16.098
And so what we did was we spent a lot of time trying to support these people in a war against these people.

11:16.638 --> 11:19.018
And that was exactly the trap that we fell into.

11:19.038 --> 11:32.861
We got in the chair, we put on the goggles, we grabbed the, oh, sorry, we got in the chair, we grabbed the goggles, we grabbed the joystick, and we thought we were aligning with these people in order to fight against these people, and that was actually the trap.

11:33.783 --> 11:35.424
Getting in the chair was the trap.

11:35.464 --> 11:37.266
That's what social media represents.

11:37.306 --> 11:57.623
And incidentally, that's really what Aldous Huxley was warning us about way back in 1962, that there would be a new kind of totalitarianism where this limited spectrum of debate that people like Noam Chomsky more recently have very, very succinctly described would be used to reinforce the suppositions of the state.

11:58.103 --> 12:01.406
And we would just get run by these actors.

12:01.506 --> 12:02.166
And I think,

12:02.967 --> 12:05.090
a good way to think of them as acolytes.

12:05.290 --> 12:09.556
They are the ruling oligarchy and they're highly trained acolytes.

12:09.736 --> 12:11.559
They will quietly perform the show.

12:12.360 --> 12:17.447
The show that we've been watching and thinking we're participating in, even though really we're just the audience.

12:18.499 --> 12:20.441
I've called it a Lollapalooza of liars.

12:20.501 --> 12:21.982
Boy, was I invested in it.

12:22.022 --> 12:25.825
I thought Twitter was the place to go where we could fight back against the empire.

12:26.425 --> 12:35.193
And if I just tweeted the right tweet or posted the right video that the viral avalanche of the resistance would finally start, but that's not true.

12:36.133 --> 12:43.539
And for over a year, we've been able to say it very succinctly, like you see here on the right, but still these people in their coordinated

12:44.881 --> 12:48.625
theater have decided that this biology is worth ignoring.

12:50.823 --> 12:58.330
And I think this is just evidence that weaponized piles of money have used their acolytes on social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

12:59.011 --> 13:03.935
And by participating in the argument, we are accepting the premise of their narratives all the time.

13:04.596 --> 13:15.926
And although this was kind of used on us for many, many decades, social media and our acquiescence to it has allowed this to become weaponized in a way never before even

13:16.867 --> 13:19.728
It's probably exceeding all of their expectations.

13:19.788 --> 13:21.988
That's what I really think that where we are.

13:22.048 --> 13:27.029
We may be exceeding, the possibilities may have exceeded their expectations.

13:27.989 --> 13:30.850
And that's a pretty scary place if you think about it.

13:31.450 --> 13:37.371
That social media may have actually exceeded what?

13:37.511 --> 13:37.951
What?

13:38.232 --> 13:39.092
Come on, really?

13:39.392 --> 13:39.972
Sorry about that.

13:40.872 --> 13:45.994
Social media may have actually exceeded their expectations in terms of what they've managed to accomplish with it.

13:46.655 --> 14:08.365
And so I think it has become more and more apparent to me that although I am very much committed to teaching biology come this fall when the school starts in a week or two, it has also got to be a regular steady pressure needs to come from all angles against social media as the default.

14:09.025 --> 14:12.268
communication medium, the default news medium.

14:12.308 --> 14:14.170
We cannot allow this to continue.

14:14.710 --> 14:22.077
We cannot allow this sort of illusion that somebody like Elon Musk has come to our rescue by buying Twitter and making it free.

14:22.117 --> 14:24.279
This is absolutely not what happened.

14:25.139 --> 14:28.242
And over the last few days, I've been trying to collect evidence of that.

14:28.302 --> 14:28.863
And I think

14:29.563 --> 14:50.321
It has just become extraordinary to me how many examples in 2020 and 2021 you can find of these people advocating for the idea that at least Twitter is free, or at least on Twitter things are getting done, or I was getting things done on Twitter until Twitter blocked me, or something to this effect.

14:50.842 --> 14:55.066
And I can't emphasize how important it is to see

14:55.666 --> 14:58.871
that Twitter played an exaggerated role.

14:58.911 --> 15:06.581
It was much more important than Facebook, much more important than some of these other low-rent kind of platforms.

15:07.478 --> 15:17.264
social media platforms that showed up as a part of the schism of the censorship that was enacted in 2021, supposedly.

15:17.764 --> 15:25.129
This theater that drove certain people to other alternative social media platforms is still not the main operating weapon.

15:25.169 --> 15:27.971
The main operating weapon really feels like Twitter.

15:28.411 --> 15:32.815
Because on YouTube, it's always been okay, certain things and certain people.

15:33.216 --> 15:36.459
That's why there's so many videos of Robert Malone still up on YouTube.

15:36.799 --> 15:39.382
We have a lot of work to do, ladies and gentlemen.

15:39.542 --> 15:44.927
Yesterday or the day before, the day before that, I can't remember how many days I have been off the air.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.169
I tried to point out how

15:48.642 --> 16:05.925
It is possible, if you do an accurate and thorough search for what these people were doing in 2020 and 2021, you can find a track record that suggests that these people were put in place and played an active role in the seeding of what I've called the Scooby-Doo narrative.

16:06.525 --> 16:12.651
about whether or not this is really a novel virus or whether or not it's really a natural virus or a lab-leak virus.

16:13.211 --> 16:20.638
And these debates, as well as the debates about what is a PCR positive or false positive, these were all hamster wheels.

16:21.259 --> 16:27.004
And they were very well-designed hamster wheels that were hard for both academagicians or

16:27.725 --> 16:39.794
academic biologists and doctors to see through, but also very difficult for, of course, the average Joe who's not an expert or perhaps a professional biologist in some regard.

16:40.214 --> 16:50.762
And so it really became a very intricate trap that was seeded and controlled by people that, in retrospect, have very dubious connections with regard to their parents,

16:51.562 --> 16:56.605
to the actual biosecurity state that everybody says is responsible for this.

16:56.665 --> 17:09.353
So Kevin McKernan, for example, his father was involved in microarray technologies, which were really, really important in the early progress made in the Human Genome Project and in sequencing technology in general.

17:09.813 --> 17:13.375
And in fact, understanding the shortcomings of

17:15.134 --> 17:34.694
potential methodologies for sequencing before and after the introduction of microarray technologies can really give you a good basic introduction into how different levels of fidelity have been gained incrementally as we've tried to go from saying we're going to do it to actually doing it and how far we actually got.

17:34.754 --> 17:38.778
Because, of course, nature and Kevin McKernan and

17:39.398 --> 17:55.904
and Mark Lander and all these other people like Francis Collins would love you to believe that we have sequenced the human genome and that that means that we basically get it and that we have all the tools necessary, we have all the landmarks necessary, and it's just a matter of, you know, doing the work.

17:56.345 --> 18:02.367
And this is absolutely positively incorrect, but again, that is what explains why Kevin McKernan

18:03.067 --> 18:22.408
dropped everything to start sequencing his marijuana to see if COVID was there or not, and also seemingly dropped everything to become a online performer, especially with regard to podcasts, and especially with regard to Twitter, which he says in almost all of his podcasts is the place where the truth is coming out.

18:24.416 --> 18:38.442
So not unlike that, of course, we watched a 60 Minutes episode that also kind of seeded some of those narratives, like that the misinformation was on Twitter and that the misinformation about the upcoming vaccine was on Twitter.

18:38.782 --> 18:45.185
And so all over the world, we were somehow or another being urged, don't go to Twitter, go to Twitter.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.045
This is where it is.

18:46.445 --> 18:50.267
Oh my gosh, the whole debate about whether or not Twitter is good, I guess I better log in.

18:51.161 --> 19:04.107
And of course, who did he go, who did Robert Malone get censored by besides, you know, supposedly getting censored by YouTube by, uh, indirectly by Brett Weinstein losing his, his, his monetization.

19:04.187 --> 19:08.709
But of course he got censored by LinkedIn and LinkedIn is owned by who?

19:08.889 --> 19:12.891
Well, I think it's owned by at least partially by Peter Thiel.

19:14.639 --> 19:30.456
And so now you start to see if you get censored on LinkedIn and then you go to Gab and Locals, which Locals is also owned by Peter Thiel, and then you complain about it on Twitter, which is owned by Peter Thiel's friend, Elon Musk, who's supposedly saving us or did or whatever.

19:31.016 --> 19:36.781
you can start to see very easily how these people, private-public partnership with the U.S.

19:36.821 --> 19:40.485
government saying they're censoring us, and at the same time, who are they censoring?

19:40.885 --> 19:49.293
Well, they're censoring the people that Peter Thiel and Elon Musk would like you to have to pay attention to with regard to the alternative narrative in the Scooby-Doo.

19:51.420 --> 20:06.428
So it becomes very clear if you start to repetitively go over and over and realize that the only podcasts that are virtually uncensored on YouTube from July, 2021 with Robert Malone, they're all there except for one.

20:07.267 --> 20:18.894
The Bret Weinstein podcast, particularly the recording with Steve Kirsch had to go to rumble, but this one from a month later is up and hundreds of others are up.

20:19.614 --> 20:22.636
Even some with Paul Cutrell are up on YouTube.

20:24.297 --> 20:27.319
And so the censorship in retrospect becomes fake.

20:27.839 --> 20:30.781
The censorship in retrospect becomes public promotion.

20:31.932 --> 20:38.974
And it becomes a public excuse for him to whine about being censored and then for everyone to wonder why is he being censored?

20:40.454 --> 20:53.217
And that's not any different than the opposite side of the coin where you have this guy who was pandering to a different audience with a different set of assumptions like natural viruses and pandemics are everywhere and duh, we're doctors.

20:54.157 --> 20:59.298
And now he's still in 2024 talking about his unique experience with a strange disease.

21:00.239 --> 21:06.802
It's really similar to the disease that everybody else described four years ago, even though I guess it's evolved quite a bit.

21:06.862 --> 21:13.985
And spike protein, that's supposed to be the toxin, has changed quite a bit, although we really haven't bothered to characterize exactly how and why it would matter.

21:15.946 --> 21:21.608
And so they have all these hamster wheels spinning, but the problem is, is that they don't all spin together.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.169
They can't, by definition.

21:23.609 --> 21:27.931
If you're spinning in this hamster wheel, you can't know that these others exist.

21:29.963 --> 21:41.026
And so no one who is following ZDogg can be brought to understand what Robert Malone is saying because that would be the ultimate in cognitive dissonance.

21:41.086 --> 21:47.348
And so they just avoid Robert Malone and it's very easy to do it because social media makes it very easy to do it.

21:48.817 --> 22:04.522
And so the weaponized choose your own adventure of social media that we were led to believe is a very organic process that just involves, you know, spontaneous viral events and spontaneous rising of the influencers with the best ideas.

22:04.902 --> 22:05.262
And that's...

22:05.902 --> 22:07.543
That's absolutely wrong.

22:08.043 --> 22:10.785
All of these people were put in front of us from the very beginning.

22:11.206 --> 22:35.202
And if we don't take the power back from these charlatans, but we continue to allow them to set the debate and to decide what to discuss and what to argue about, then we are just sitting in that chair, hanging onto the joystick, wearing goggles, thinking, fooling ourselves into thinking that the right combination of pedal pushes and joystick movements is going to save the republic.

22:35.242 --> 22:35.762
And it won't.

22:36.482 --> 22:46.227
It won't because of this illusion of consensus that's created by Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig from the very beginning when they first wrote the paper about the PCR test together.

22:46.727 --> 22:54.630
And George Webb and Jessica Rose from the very beginning when George Webb was on 60 Minutes and Jessica Rose came out about VAERS.

22:56.171 --> 23:05.135
Robert Malone and ZDogg are no different than one another because they both believe in the idea that there's pandemic potential in nature and in laboratories.

23:07.748 --> 23:17.441
So this new consensus about why they would murder and lie about it and what they're covering up with the murder and lies, we really need to think very carefully about it.

23:17.861 --> 23:23.609
I think we need to think very carefully about it in the same way that if we're going to ask the right question, what would we ask?

23:23.689 --> 23:24.811
The question we would ask

23:26.601 --> 23:29.001
And I think I actually blew it the last time I did a stream.

23:29.021 --> 23:36.583
The question we would ask, and this is most important, I haven't formulated this yet, and I think I said it in the last stream, but I probably said it an hour and a half in.

23:37.463 --> 23:51.526
The right question is, if science and biology have been malevolently simplified, if they have been malevolently distorted,

23:52.921 --> 24:22.019
and used against us with the P value thing, and with the funding thing, and with the overemphasis of genetics thing, and with the lies about how far we're gonna get in the next 10 years thing, and the lies about pandemic, and the next logical conclusion, the next logical sort of train of thought would be where in our society are these things most malevolently damaging our children?

24:23.507 --> 24:37.690
Where are these false assumptions, these mythologies, these socially engineered impetuses, where are these lies most malevolently impacting our children?

24:38.210 --> 24:39.751
Yes, fast food is terrible.

24:40.491 --> 24:42.491
Yes, plastic bottles are terrible.

24:43.031 --> 24:45.872
Yes, pollution in the ocean is terrible.

24:47.092 --> 24:49.053
But as a biologist and as a father,

24:50.031 --> 24:59.214
I think it's very, very important to understand that the vaccine schedule in America in particular has got to be seen as a criminal enterprise.

24:59.294 --> 25:04.135
It is a current ongoing crime.

25:04.255 --> 25:07.076
It should not be allowed to go on anymore.

25:07.136 --> 25:13.018
And one of the priorities I think should be to bring awareness to this.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.959
And the same time that we bring awareness to the fact that our,

25:18.278 --> 25:26.862
basic acceptance of the food industry in America has gone so far that the FDA essentially permits them to poison us.

25:27.302 --> 25:45.549
And this wicked combination is something that at least has to be on the list of the most malevolent ways that broken science, that the broken healthcare system or public health mythology has been most malevolently used against our children.

25:45.789 --> 25:46.890
Us, what are we going to do?

25:48.226 --> 25:51.329
You have every opportunity as an adult to turn it around.

25:51.369 --> 25:52.911
You can start eating well today.

25:52.971 --> 25:55.574
You can start drinking more water and less cola today.

25:55.974 --> 25:57.716
You can start exercising today.

25:57.776 --> 25:59.738
If you didn't do 10 sit-ups today, do them.

26:00.098 --> 26:02.821
If you've never done pushups in the last 20 years, do some.

26:04.343 --> 26:06.045
And then try tomorrow to do more.

26:07.267 --> 26:19.594
And at some point, if you actually keep that pattern going, you'll be doing 50 sit-ups a day, and you'll be doing 30 push-ups a day, and you'll be doing jump rope for 10 minutes a day, and you'll feel better than you did 30 days before.

26:21.555 --> 26:30.540
But ladies and gentlemen, children and babies cannot, and young parents are honestly not yet equipped to protect themselves from the

26:32.492 --> 26:40.664
the national security state that needs them to accept the vaccine schedule before and after the pandemic as just being default the best idea ever.

26:41.943 --> 27:01.673
and Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland and Brett Weinstein and the Brownstone Institute, none of these people are actually making any useful progress in terms of educating our children and young parents to swiftly turn this cruise ship around.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.914
Now, is it possible that there are people who are trying?

27:04.954 --> 27:05.915
Yes, I think there are.

27:05.955 --> 27:08.016
I think there are people who are trying.

27:08.036 --> 27:10.377
And I think Mike Eden might be one of them.

27:20.174 --> 27:21.135
It's manslaughter.

27:21.216 --> 27:23.699
OK, well, then for the doctors, it's manslaughter.

27:23.739 --> 27:27.724
But for some of these national security operatives, it's murder.

27:29.427 --> 27:31.750
Anyway, I don't want to debate that too much.

27:31.810 --> 27:32.431
I get the point.

27:32.511 --> 27:36.236
And if we're debating that, then we're talking about the right thing, which I think is very important.

27:37.557 --> 27:41.799
Because our way of life and our families and our kids future is under attack.

27:42.739 --> 27:45.100
And that means we need to understand it very well.

27:45.861 --> 27:51.063
I'm going to go full screen with this and there is some beginning part with like music and stuff.

27:51.123 --> 27:54.584
And because I don't have all day to do this, I will fast forward.

27:54.604 --> 27:58.626
I think I've gotten to the right part where the music is over and now they're going to introduce the dude.

27:59.546 --> 28:00.907
I've never watched this guy before.

28:00.947 --> 28:01.987
I'm unaware of him.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.752
I've heard the name before, but honestly, I'd never watched him.

28:07.812 --> 28:08.916
It's just one of those things.

28:11.761 --> 28:29.533
I find myself wondering, and I think Mark Kulak of Housatonic Live finds himself wondering too, really, how many other people really are there that just by the nature of social media and the control mechanisms built within it that we have been permanently separated from one another pretty effectively up until now?

28:31.234 --> 28:34.736
Or really, is there very little in terms of people to connect to?

28:35.617 --> 28:37.138
Shout out also to Joe Marshall.

28:37.158 --> 28:39.119
He's done a couple of really good videos lately.

28:39.460 --> 28:41.401
So if you haven't checked out the Liberty Perspective,

28:42.296 --> 28:43.778
on Rumble, please do that.

28:43.998 --> 28:49.162
And Mark Kulak of Mark Housatonic Live is now also on Twitch.

28:49.202 --> 28:54.347
So if you're watching on Twitch, you can of course immediately look for him and follow him as well if you haven't already.

28:54.367 --> 28:56.969
Okay, I didn't want that, sorry.

28:56.989 --> 28:58.410
I am so happy to be here with all of you.

29:09.813 --> 29:10.974
And I totally mean it as well.

29:11.334 --> 29:16.557
In the expensive bit at the beginning that most of you were too cheap to pay for, but it was really worth it, I can tell you.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.899
Seriously, they got the best of me.

29:19.919 --> 29:22.000
This is just the kind of, the leavings.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.641
But I'll try.

29:23.661 --> 29:37.450
No, these moments are really special because I suspect that almost everyone here finds themselves living in a situation where they can't say the shit that we're gonna say to each other tonight

29:38.635 --> 29:40.599
and the pub and the bits in between.

29:40.659 --> 29:44.908
We can finally, we're finally free to be ourselves.

29:46.594 --> 29:47.475
And most of us can't.

29:47.595 --> 29:52.098
I mean, I can't talk about the stuff that I talk about here at home.

29:52.598 --> 29:53.659
I can't live this double life.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.381
I think most of us have the same experience.

29:56.661 --> 30:07.448
We've got one foot in normie world where we have to sort of feign an interest in whoever's going to be elected in some kind of irrelevant thing that's going on on TV.

30:08.189 --> 30:15.994
And the real, true world where we know that Taylor Swift is a bloke.

30:21.538 --> 30:23.800
See, now this is already for me disappointing.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.602
I swear, I'm being serious when I say I haven't watched this.

30:27.803 --> 30:39.752
This is disappointing to me because essentially he is suggesting, it's kind of weird that he's doing this in a church, he's kind of suggesting that you don't have to tell the truth all the time.

30:40.112 --> 30:44.435
We all live lives of lies where we put on a disguise or a face.

30:47.398 --> 30:49.339
Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but I don't.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.041
I tell the truth all the time.

30:52.221 --> 30:54.723
All my neighbors know exactly what I'm up to.

30:56.084 --> 31:04.990
Some of them react kind of weird, but they all knew that I was working for Bobby when I was working for Bobby, and they all know that I think Bobby's a creep now.

31:06.010 --> 31:12.316
Or at least they know that I think that Bobby is somehow part of a system that we are all in need of checking out of.

31:12.356 --> 31:14.278
And that's what I say to them.

31:14.318 --> 31:17.301
And they don't necessarily go, oh, yeah, OK.

31:17.321 --> 31:20.344
They all look a little concerned and whatever.

31:20.404 --> 31:26.170
But I don't put on a front, especially if somebody asks me.

31:26.611 --> 31:29.373
And so this already kind of disappoints me because,

31:30.174 --> 31:38.324
I think that's part of the reason why assholes are getting away with being assholes, because quite a few people aren't willing to say it.

31:40.606 --> 31:41.908
And I think it's a real shame.

31:43.029 --> 31:44.811
And we know about the dinosaurs as well.

31:46.093 --> 31:48.055
We've got their number, haven't we?

31:48.135 --> 31:49.436
We know about the dinosaurs.

31:50.171 --> 31:52.593
Oh, yeah, yeah, darling, we love your little triceratops.

31:52.913 --> 31:54.734
Yeah, it didn't exist, didn't exist.

31:55.695 --> 32:01.599
I'd like to get to know, I mean, I kind of feel I know you already, and I've met quite a few of you before.

32:02.220 --> 32:06.123
Hands up who's been to a previous live Deling pod.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.604
Oh, so there are quite a few newbies, that's good.

32:09.684 --> 32:12.666
But welcome back to the ones who've been there before.

32:13.446 --> 32:19.669
Hands up if I have burned you on social media, if I've flamed you.

32:20.349 --> 32:27.673
As I always say, I'm really sorry, because you know this, I am so much nicer in real life.

32:28.493 --> 32:31.876
And so here again, you can kind of see something suspicious here.

32:31.916 --> 32:36.079
He's not at all suggesting that social media is a bad place.

32:37.020 --> 32:47.069
He's asking if you've interacted with him on social media and sort of kind of indirectly encouraging anyone who hasn't or would like to, to seek him out on social media.

32:48.850 --> 32:50.992
Then I am online.

32:51.993 --> 32:54.375
Online, I take no prisoners.

32:55.737 --> 33:00.681
And the reason I take no prisoners is because you bloody deserved it.

33:01.482 --> 33:02.523
You shouldn't be wrong.

33:02.583 --> 33:05.865
If you say wrong things and annoying things to me, you get burned.

33:05.885 --> 33:12.391
In real life, I'm like a kitten, like a lovely, sweet little... I'm not just a kitten.

33:13.131 --> 33:16.434
I'm actually a British shorthair kitten.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.455
You know how cute they are.

33:17.475 --> 33:20.918
They've got little grey faces, little round faces.

33:20.938 --> 33:22.079
They're lovely, lovely.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.240
I'm like one of those.

33:24.255 --> 33:25.155
How many people?

33:25.615 --> 33:30.076
I can't help but to point out that there are a lot of cat people on the bad side.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.297
I am a dog person.

33:34.037 --> 33:34.977
We have no cats.

33:35.117 --> 33:39.958
No problem with them, but I find it an interesting signal.

33:41.038 --> 33:44.419
Even if it's irrelevant.

33:44.459 --> 33:51.060
The reason why I find it an interesting signal is for me it's especially interesting because drastic started doing that actually.

33:51.900 --> 34:02.487
It was a couple people in drastic and Kevin McKernan that started posting cat pictures as a way of throwing off the Twitter algorithm.

34:02.547 --> 34:05.489
I think that was in 2021, but it might've been as late as 2022.

34:07.478 --> 34:12.684
Luigi Warren was a guy, original OG member of Drastic who started doing that.

34:13.145 --> 34:18.070
And at the same time, that was when I started to follow Kevin McKernan and he also did it.

34:18.591 --> 34:23.236
So it's just interesting that here we are in 2024 and now he's talking about himself as a cat.

34:23.336 --> 34:23.817
It's weird.

34:24.317 --> 34:24.497
Yeah.

34:29.935 --> 34:36.799
You jest, you hand-putter-uppers, but I'll bet there are some people who are from the intelligence service.

34:36.879 --> 34:43.584
And I would like to say, I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable, whoever you are.

34:44.864 --> 34:46.345
Well, I mean, only a bit.

34:47.106 --> 34:48.707
But I would like to say to you one thing.

34:49.682 --> 34:53.223
When you get home after this uncomfortable evening.

34:53.583 --> 35:01.044
He's addressing intelligence officers in the audience and they're uncomfortable in the audience.

35:01.124 --> 35:08.685
This is pretty arrogant and also pretty theatrical.

35:09.445 --> 35:14.126
The whole introduction here has been pretty theatrical, if I can be so bold.

35:15.026 --> 35:18.127
Go and find a Bible, if you've got one.

35:19.525 --> 35:27.108
and read about a character called Saul, who was doing what you're doing now.

35:27.228 --> 35:35.691
He was on his way to Damascus to persecute some decent people, and something happened.

35:36.231 --> 35:39.312
And I hope that one day the same thing happens to you.

35:45.014 --> 35:45.134
Now,

35:48.294 --> 35:57.803
I had planned one of the more completely out there podcasts I did, not quite Jesse Saboto level, but almost.

35:57.863 --> 36:01.006
I don't know, was it, what was her name, Catherine somebody?

36:03.405 --> 36:09.769
She deals with the really dark stuff, you know, adrenochrome and sort of, you know, Satanism and blah, blah, blah.

36:10.469 --> 36:24.176
And she had on this website, on her website, this really good prayer that totally covered everything, that warded off all the kind of evil that was going to, you know, potentially oppress her, you know, when you talk about this stuff.

36:24.617 --> 36:31.781
And Dick, Dick the other day met this, well, about a year ago now, met this man, I hope he's here, but I bet he isn't.

36:32.481 --> 36:43.736
who goes around sprinkling salt around the whole area where people like us are going to meet, and it keeps the evil out.

36:45.851 --> 36:50.176
And I, I mean, I don't know about you, I do genuinely believe in this.

36:50.236 --> 36:54.561
I mean, I don't just sort of say it as a kind of comical affectation.

36:55.122 --> 37:02.211
I genuinely believe, in fact, who believes as well, that we are fighting above all a spiritual battle right now.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.784
Yeah, I'm surprised by it.

37:06.844 --> 37:07.945
It's about 50-50, I'd say.

37:08.005 --> 37:10.688
I think it is a battle between good and evil.

37:11.109 --> 37:16.694
And I used to feel slightly embarrassed about mentioning subjects like Christianity.

37:18.456 --> 37:27.925
I'm not embarrassed at all anymore because I think that this stuff is real and that one should talk about it.

37:28.863 --> 37:29.985
So what is the stuff?

37:30.005 --> 37:38.896
You see, this is the part where I really think that GigaOM Biological and a few other podcasts maybe are the only ones that get it right.

37:38.956 --> 37:44.824
Because it is the ASH experiment, it's the Milgram experiment, it's

37:46.644 --> 37:50.586
It's some kind of captor syndrome or kidnapped.

37:50.906 --> 37:59.129
You feel like you've been under somebody else's control or captive or you've submitted or whatever explanation you have for it.

37:59.249 --> 38:07.632
It is ultimately comes down to the fact that groups of people have coordinatedly lied to us over many years.

38:09.898 --> 38:18.207
And they've lied to us with the intention of confusing us, with the intention of creating fear and uncertainty and doubt.

38:20.789 --> 38:24.033
And so when somebody like this says, do you think it's a spiritual battle?

38:24.053 --> 38:27.156
But then he doesn't define the battlefield.

38:29.668 --> 38:46.397
when faiths as generations old can all agree that the father of lies is a synonym for Satan, is a synonym for the devil, kind of makes lies pretty bad, right?

38:48.518 --> 38:56.543
And in reality, this is the part about it that frustrates me the most, is that I really think from the perspective of teaching our children,

38:57.950 --> 39:10.147
You can start on YouTube and look at Mr. Beast with them and show that Mr. Beast is only giving away prizes to people that live in his hometown or people that are working for him or people that are related to people who are working for him.

39:10.827 --> 39:15.514
And nobody who's just randomly subscribed to him is getting any attention or money or anything at all.

39:17.065 --> 39:20.067
It's an illusion and they're allowed to do it because it's social media.

39:20.107 --> 39:32.414
You're allowed to get 20 people together to lie about being contestants on Mr. Beast's YouTube competition where they're gonna stay on an island for three days and see who can survive without food or some shit.

39:34.595 --> 39:44.601
And just because you can see it with Mr. Beast doesn't mean that it's easy to see it when somebody like Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and their guests decide to do it.

39:46.630 --> 39:50.857
When the guest on ICANN being interviewed by Dell is doing it.

39:53.441 --> 39:55.825
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

39:55.885 --> 40:00.853
is being advised by people who are doing it to him, and so he ends up doing it wittingly, unwittingly.

40:01.974 --> 40:12.101
However you want to describe the world or explain what you see at the foundation of it has to be that people have agreed to participate in this theater.

40:12.181 --> 40:24.169
And if this guy has agreed to participate in the theater, which right now, I mean, at least 50 50, because of all the crap he said so far, he doesn't seem to be lowering any ladders.

40:24.209 --> 40:30.073
He just wants everybody to make sure we agree on what, where we are and what the trap looks like.

40:32.853 --> 40:40.358
And oftentimes when somebody wants you to agree on what the trap looks like, they are actually not trying to free you from it.

40:42.920 --> 40:47.983
I'm always trying to find more parts of the trap, more angles on it, more doors that are closing.

40:48.483 --> 40:55.548
And these people are already pretty certain for four years that they know exactly what the trap is composed of and they know exactly how to get out.

40:55.608 --> 40:58.530
But you know, we can wait for a little while before we actually do anything.

40:59.230 --> 41:00.030
I was going to

41:01.144 --> 41:06.126
print out this long prayer and read it.

41:06.146 --> 41:09.228
I mean, it really covered everything.

41:09.248 --> 41:13.050
I mean, you'd have gone home, and you'd have been absolutely safe, and you wouldn't have been attacked by demons at all.

41:15.231 --> 41:20.793
But then it meant getting the printer working, and actually, I think it's probably take up all the evening anyway.

41:20.813 --> 41:23.575
So let's just do a quick one before we start.

41:23.715 --> 41:28.037
I'm just going to say, our Father, which art in heaven,

41:28.737 --> 41:33.779
Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

41:34.519 --> 41:39.901
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.

41:40.481 --> 41:43.242
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

41:43.702 --> 41:47.504
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever.

41:48.204 --> 41:48.504
Amen.

41:48.524 --> 41:54.186
And I'm sorry for any non-Christians that I've embarrassed with that, but I think the Christians will know what I mean.

41:54.226 --> 41:56.107
We kind of need these things.

41:56.167 --> 41:56.887
I think that they,

41:59.113 --> 42:13.510
They, whenever you say a prayer, whenever you say a psalm, as I do every day, you are sort of slightly tipping the balance towards the side of the good and against the side of evil.

42:14.684 --> 42:23.066
And I think that my guest, who you're about to meet in a moment, might even agree with me on some of this stuff.

42:23.386 --> 42:26.907
One more question before I get him on stage and before we get the show rolling.

42:27.708 --> 42:41.491
How many people here have been brought along by their wife or whoever, and are sitting there going, who are all these crazy people?

42:41.932 --> 42:42.312
What am I?

42:43.172 --> 42:43.252
One.

42:45.037 --> 42:45.877
Two, three.

42:48.478 --> 42:53.480
Well, I hope that we succeed tonight in red-pilling you, or at least taking you some of the way with us.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.820
I mean, I think, come on in, the water's lovely, isn't it?

42:57.581 --> 42:57.901
Right.

42:59.201 --> 43:01.342
I think we should get the show on the road.

43:03.823 --> 43:10.405
By beginning with the magic words, welcome to the Deling Pod.

43:11.894 --> 43:17.336
And I know I always say this, but I'm really excited about my special guest.

43:18.336 --> 43:21.198
Welcome to the Deling Pod, Mike Uden.

43:21.218 --> 43:35.763
There's a couple of weird times where they really use the camera specifically cut to his hands.

43:36.423 --> 43:38.264
They even cut to that handshake, which

43:39.679 --> 43:41.400
It could just be them messing with us.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.041
It's also just strange.

43:43.221 --> 43:43.581
I don't know.

43:43.741 --> 43:53.027
I find it very strange, those kinds of cuts, knowing what I know and we all know about how hand signals don't mean anything until they mean something, right?

43:53.967 --> 43:54.888
Which side do you want?

44:07.365 --> 44:28.871
Now, Mike, I would suggest that one reason that we love you, Mike, is, and they do, we do, is that I would guess there are quite a few people here tonight, the reason they did not take the death jab was because of you.

44:29.512 --> 44:30.692
Hands up if that's the case.

44:32.253 --> 44:33.314
I still think that's true.

44:33.374 --> 44:35.917
I think he probably saved more people than anybody else.

44:35.937 --> 44:38.039
I wish I could have helped more people not take it.

44:39.861 --> 44:41.363
Well, yeah.

44:41.383 --> 44:42.164
Do you see?

44:42.284 --> 44:45.007
He's already, he almost cried right there.

44:46.181 --> 44:58.250
So even if he drops some balls in this interview and we have to correct them or we can expand on them, understand that I still think that Mike Eden is Mr. Sparkle.

44:58.310 --> 45:06.056
And I still think that if anything, he is emotionally and mentally exhausted from being assaulted on all sides from all these people.

45:06.096 --> 45:09.479
I mean, Sasha Latapova was one of the last people to get in touch with him.

45:09.879 --> 45:11.000
And that's just gross.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.241
I don't wish that on anybody.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.862
It was right at the beginning, wasn't it?

45:15.162 --> 45:31.187
I think the first time I more or less said don't do it was an open letter that I wrote with Wolfgang Bodarg to the European Medical Medicines Agency and it was 1st of December 2020 and that was the day my life changed.

45:32.088 --> 45:35.389
I've been annoying on Twitter and lots of people have

45:36.049 --> 46:01.221
I think they do a pylon, and then make things, and I'm not, I wasn't used to what was happening, couldn't deal with it, but it was the day after I published that, the BBC put on someone who'd formerly fronted Newsnight to interview a woman from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and then they, on Woman's Hour, lied to the public to say, I'm a conspiracy theorist.

46:01.281 --> 46:03.242
She said, I'm going to name him, Dr. Mike Eden.

46:03.722 --> 46:04.463
Complete rubbish.

46:04.983 --> 46:11.106
Here's the lady from the Royal College to tell you, not only is it safe to be jabbed, but you must go and get jabbed if you're pregnant.

46:12.827 --> 46:15.909
Anyway, I managed to get them to take that all down.

46:16.469 --> 46:18.630
Because I said, if you don't, I'm actually going to sue you.

46:19.391 --> 46:29.796
But I think that's when I realized that basically the establishment is not going to tolerate me doing this.

46:29.896 --> 46:33.939
And I think it took about another three months before I realized

46:35.297 --> 46:44.726
rather spooky thought that a few months previously, someone had held a meeting where they decided whether to murder me or censor me.

46:45.707 --> 46:53.093
Because several people, people like President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, PhD chemist, I'm pretty sure he was murdered.

46:53.574 --> 46:58.178
There's been an exceptionally large number of African MPs that all died in the first six months of 2020.

46:59.939 --> 47:14.130
And basically, the people who are running this, we won't see them, but the people who are near to us, the idiots, people who work for the secret services, if you think you're serving your country.

47:15.151 --> 47:20.335
Do you really think the people running this are going to let you keep the money that you earn?

47:20.835 --> 47:26.498
for ratting on your colleagues and helping destroy the society that you live in, you really are stupid.

47:26.838 --> 47:32.141
If you think this is just an ordinary job of work, you haven't woken up yet, so you're not very intelligent after all.

47:33.095 --> 47:40.438
So when people have said, oh, you're very brave speaking out, I react badly.

47:40.498 --> 47:49.121
Because I've said, if you think it's scary what might happen if we speak out, you've got to look at what's going to happen if you don't.

47:50.182 --> 47:50.782
Much worse.

47:51.302 --> 47:58.205
And once I realized how bad this is, and it didn't take, it took me about another six months to cross back to God.

47:59.706 --> 48:00.707
one vivid night.

48:01.727 --> 48:14.599
But once I realized how bad it was, I thought, if they do me in for speaking truth, it's probably better than if I undo that rather than just creep around and hope to survive another six months longer in Hunger City.

48:16.721 --> 48:18.822
My wife has advised me not to swear, so I'm not going to.

48:18.862 --> 48:23.644
But I was pretty gritty about that, and I have no fear whatsoever.

48:23.764 --> 48:35.029
And I urge all of you to get over any embarrassment you may have and any fear you may have, because the controllers have made sure that people like James and I have a limited reach.

48:35.289 --> 48:39.211
I think the tech censorship is unbelievably effective.

48:39.711 --> 48:40.651
I mean, you wouldn't believe it.

48:40.671 --> 48:42.072
And that's why they don't need to do anything.

48:43.810 --> 48:56.919
And Mike is right, but he's also not fully understanding and I still think it's hard for a lot of people to see it if you haven't actually run into these people over and over and over again and had it done to you over and over and over again.

48:57.500 --> 48:58.480
And I feel.

48:59.441 --> 49:13.672
some humbleness in the fact that since 2020, there have basically been group after group after group of people that has agreed to lie to me in some weird concerted way to try and fool me into a hamster wheel.

49:14.472 --> 49:22.418
And for many, many years, I was essentially running in hamster wheels that were constructed by other people that I trusted.

49:23.519 --> 49:28.523
And every time I weeded out another set of these liars, another group showed up.

49:29.650 --> 49:40.356
And it turns out that there were an extraordinary number of people that were, wittingly or unwittingly, co-opted or not, participating in this narrative curation.

49:40.816 --> 49:42.637
And Mike Eden was not one of them.

49:42.697 --> 49:49.181
He never felt like one of them because he was talking about everything that he thought was important, including immunity.

49:49.781 --> 50:00.871
He was one of the first people to start talking about the idea that, OK, there are RNA viruses, but they're not so dissimilar from one another that our immune system hasn't already cracked this puzzle.

50:01.251 --> 50:09.698
And it would be crazy to think that we need to reorient the immune system of millions of people for something that

50:10.439 --> 50:21.952
He was very good at asking the right questions and one of the only ones besides Wolfgang Wodach and another guy by the name of Knut Witkowski, who was asking the right questions in 2020.

50:22.333 --> 50:26.157
The rest of them, like, I mean, you can go all along the gamut.

50:26.197 --> 50:27.639
Most of them weren't speaking out.

50:27.699 --> 50:28.420
Most of them were

50:28.820 --> 50:31.042
wearing bandanas and woodshop goggles.

50:31.142 --> 50:35.265
Most of them were trying to see if they could get in on the repurposed drug train.

50:35.746 --> 50:43.972
Most of these people were not usefully questioning the fundamental principles and premises of the narrative at all and never have.

50:45.193 --> 50:47.255
Mike Eden has done it consistently.

50:47.534 --> 50:53.736
Because they know that what we say, that's like throwing a skimming stone across the lake.

50:53.816 --> 50:56.357
We might think we'll get nine jumps if we do it well.

50:56.877 --> 50:59.578
They've worked it out to be like two and a half and then it will stop.

51:00.038 --> 51:03.599
But the people in this room, you are the secret weapon.

51:03.940 --> 51:10.822
Now remember, that's partially correct that when they censor Mike Eden, his message never gets out.

51:12.122 --> 51:14.623
Even when other people try to get it out, it doesn't get out.

51:14.683 --> 51:15.363
That's true.

51:15.824 --> 51:16.764
But even worse,

51:17.910 --> 51:32.772
is the artificial elevation of people like Robert Malone, of people like Meryl Nass, of people like Bobby Kennedy, of the elevation of particular people that are actually in the reality

51:33.593 --> 51:59.054
part of this limited spectrum of debate, part of this controlled opposition, playing a role, agreeing not to question the really important places where the broken science of our culture is most malevolently affecting our children's future and their potential to have liberty and to exceed the potential of their biology.

51:59.918 --> 52:02.299
It's just not being actively done.

52:02.419 --> 52:11.704
We are not actively seeking to change the system in the places where it is most malevolently misaligned for our children.

52:11.844 --> 52:15.345
They're not even asking those questions, not even remotely.

52:16.006 --> 52:20.768
And instead they are using the broken system to justify destroying it.

52:21.687 --> 52:27.211
And that's, again, something that I think Mike Yeadon sees and speaks out very clearly about.

52:27.591 --> 52:32.235
The way that we stop this, the way that we stop the enslavement is to stop engaging in this system.

52:32.694 --> 52:42.038
your family that isn't here, your friends that aren't here, work colleagues that aren't here, or listening to us, you are the only contacts who know the truth.

52:42.758 --> 52:44.098
Media will never tell them the truth.

52:44.118 --> 52:46.439
They'll never hear from me.

52:47.520 --> 52:50.121
So bluntly, if you don't do it, we're going down.

52:50.181 --> 52:57.284
If you do do it, they will lose, because they require consent, or at least just not protesting.

52:57.624 --> 52:59.344
So that's all it will take.

52:59.384 --> 52:59.665
Well said.

53:01.125 --> 53:10.808
Once you've learned one really significant thing that's just like so obviously awful, it's a crime against humanity, then people protesting, oh, what about this?

53:10.868 --> 53:11.529
What about that?

53:11.869 --> 53:15.490
So for me, it came from my professional experience and training.

53:16.110 --> 53:26.714
I looked at these things called vaccines and I thought, I can find multiple, independent, unnecessary, obvious mechanisms of toxicity.

53:27.674 --> 53:34.017
Multiple, independent, unnecessary, and obvious.

53:34.817 --> 53:37.438
And so I wrestled with this for ages.

53:38.338 --> 53:48.000
Now remember, that is in contrast to somebody like Kevin McKernan, who would argue that it's really just the double-stranded DNA and the contamination that we got to solve.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.081
And then transfection works great.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.441
Like Buck, what is his name?

53:54.462 --> 53:57.602
Buckhalter would argue the exact same thing.

53:57.642 --> 54:00.583
He even argues worse that the double-stranded DNA

54:01.403 --> 54:06.069
doesn't make transfection bad for his parents, it just makes it a little questionable for his daughter.

54:06.570 --> 54:13.680
And so one of the things at the heart of this is what Mike Eden is explaining right now, this idea that this

54:15.836 --> 54:18.899
the problems that are solved and not solved.

54:19.119 --> 54:20.821
And there are no problems solved.

54:20.881 --> 54:29.430
I mean, even Robert Malone is a disgruntled guy who claims that Peter Akullis lied to him and told him that they had solved the localization problem.

54:29.770 --> 54:32.793
And that was the reason why he took two doses of Moderna.

54:33.294 --> 54:35.456
So these people are caught now.

54:36.499 --> 54:58.951
They are caught in their inconsistency and their lack of integrity over four years where Mike Eden, although his opinions have wavered and he's gone in and out of the idea of viruses and whatever, his fundamental principles and his fundamental basis for objecting to this still ultimately spins back to the idea that they suddenly wanted to inject it in pregnant women.

54:58.991 --> 55:01.132
It spins back to the idea that this

55:01.952 --> 55:06.994
that the design of this methodology applied to healthy people doesn't make any sense.

55:08.435 --> 55:09.975
That's why I love Mr. Sparkle.

55:10.255 --> 55:17.858
It was like someone like me sat in a room and worked out how to manufacture these things.

55:18.398 --> 55:26.001
And then other people would persuade large chunks of the population of the planet to have this thrust into their arms.

55:26.061 --> 55:29.423
And so, you know, I was well on my way back to gold at that point.

55:30.143 --> 55:36.026
Because if that isn't evil, I'm really not sure that we should just expunge the word from the dictionary if that doesn't fit.

55:36.546 --> 55:44.690
So Mike, can I pause you there, because you went straight from the kind of foreplay to the money shot in all that.

55:45.091 --> 55:45.831
And I respect that.

55:45.971 --> 55:50.173
I mean, you are basically batshit crazy, like me.

55:50.233 --> 55:54.195
I mean, you don't pull your punches.

55:56.456 --> 55:57.197
You talk about the

55:59.147 --> 56:00.628
bad things.

56:00.808 --> 56:07.714
Why is that useful in his mind to call each other batshit crazy?

56:08.955 --> 56:10.276
Why is that useful?

56:11.097 --> 56:15.600
How is that not more likely neurolinguistic programming about lab leaks?

56:16.381 --> 56:18.763
Like, what is going on here?

56:18.903 --> 56:21.345
Vaccines, which aren't vaccines, we know.

56:21.365 --> 56:26.309
Can you just briefly tell us the bad constituents?

56:27.170 --> 56:28.091
So what are they then?

56:28.711 --> 56:35.355
Some people say, we're not even sure that the things they've told us are in it are in it, and that's fair enough.

56:35.855 --> 56:38.277
We can only deal with what they've told us they're doing.

56:38.717 --> 56:45.962
So put simply, these are genetic gene-based products like messenger RNA.

56:46.402 --> 56:50.725
It contains a piece of code for your body to manufacture something.

56:51.964 --> 56:54.705
And we're told it's a spike protein, but it doesn't really matter what it is.

56:54.805 --> 57:01.746
The point is, your body is exquisitely sensitive to what belongs in it and what is foreign.

57:02.706 --> 57:05.047
We all know about tissue rejection if you have a transplant.

57:05.587 --> 57:06.367
Same principle.

57:07.468 --> 57:14.889
So when you inject it with this bit of code, your body will then go, OK, boss, you told me to make the thing that is encoded.

57:16.029 --> 57:18.050
It's a non-human protein.

57:19.011 --> 57:24.557
So your body will manufacture a non-human protein, your immune system will go, hold on, that doesn't belong in here.

57:24.577 --> 57:37.492
And every single cell in your body that has taken up a blob of that material and made the foreign protein will be detected and destroyed by your immune system.

57:39.130 --> 57:40.611
There's no way out.

57:40.671 --> 57:42.412
That's like immunology 101.

57:42.652 --> 57:45.314
It's the first lesson, self and non-self.

57:45.574 --> 57:50.937
So that's one thing, that there are various toxic lipids that I think are intrinsically dangerous.

57:51.738 --> 57:55.160
Oh yeah, and then the... I shouldn't laugh.

57:55.380 --> 58:01.744
But the formulation, you may have heard that they're wrapped in lipid nanoparticles, just blobs of grease, a very special grease.

58:02.484 --> 58:05.746
I happen to know this, so when I saw it, it was like, oh my god.

58:06.246 --> 58:16.272
The particular lipids that they use are known to accumulate in the abdominal organs of animals, in particular, the ovaries.

58:17.032 --> 58:25.898
So I went searching and found a paper like nine years old, lipid nanoparticles accumulate in ovaries, an unrecognized reproductive harms risk.

58:27.358 --> 58:32.840
So if you combine the first two things, I've got five more, but you know, and others have got another three or four.

58:33.240 --> 58:42.564
So these things, sorry to shock you so early, but that's what made me absolutely certain that what's happening is, you know, whatever.

58:42.604 --> 58:44.405
There's no way it's just to make a bit of money.

58:44.425 --> 58:45.665
It wasn't a mistake.

58:46.005 --> 58:48.446
You know, it's like someone's coming after us.

58:48.466 --> 58:52.028
I don't think we should let them.

58:53.008 --> 58:54.689
So you think it's,

58:57.515 --> 59:04.398
And so I think it's important to say that Mark Kulak and I have a little bit more nuanced way of saying this.

59:04.959 --> 59:06.339
They're not coming after us.

59:06.920 --> 59:15.644
They are inverting our sovereignty so that they can use us and our children and our children's children as experimental animals without having to pay a dime for it.

59:17.405 --> 59:24.548
And without us even asking questions, because it will essentially be under the guise of the vaccine schedule and personalized medicine.

59:24.609 --> 59:25.429
That's what's coming.

59:27.150 --> 59:32.231
And it goes right along with digital IDs and digital currency and all this other stuff.

59:32.271 --> 59:34.252
It's all part of the same show.

59:34.652 --> 59:38.612
And most of that, of course, is what Mr. Sparkle is going to get right.

59:38.652 --> 59:44.274
But I'm just trying to keep up with this and make sure that we don't drop the ball on any of this stuff.

59:44.734 --> 59:46.514
He says that a code makes a protein.

59:46.554 --> 59:48.595
Don't forget that it's a non-human protein.

59:48.635 --> 59:49.995
It's not even a viral protein.

59:50.851 --> 01:00:01.311
because they've codon optimized it and they've changed a significant number of bases to this base that can wobble codons so that even if you have the

01:00:02.486 --> 01:00:20.055
theoretically correct sequence, and only that sequence in your lipid nanoparticle, it won't be read with high fidelity by the ribosomes, because the ribosomes will make errors because of the chemical alterations that you've made, and because of the codon optimization that you've done.

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:23.997
And so the protein that comes out is actually rather unpredictably

01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:25.859
I'm going to be folded.

01:00:25.919 --> 01:00:35.213
It's going to be different because again, all the RNAs are not the same and they're not pure, even though that's the assumption that was kind of made in that rudimentary explanation.

01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:40.901
The RNAs are definitely not pure because Kevin McKernan came on my stream in 2022 and talked about that.

01:00:41.301 --> 01:01:04.663
it's just a smear and so the protein that would be produced would always be a smear of fragments that again would have a much higher propensity for a bouquet of outcomes wherever they were expressed rather than some kind of limited set of outcomes that again the Scooby-Doo mystery has wanted us to believe you know it's just clotting or it's just

01:01:06.585 --> 01:01:08.626
I don't know, amyloid or something like that.

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:12.108
No, we're talking about an almost unlimited bouquet of potential.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:25.516
Because wherever these, these particles go, they have the potential to damage chemically, things like your mitochondria, but they also have potential to damage you as a result of improperly activating your immune system.

01:01:27.257 --> 01:01:30.419
And so accumulating in the ovaries is even a very, very

01:01:32.498 --> 01:01:45.146
simplified version of what somebody like Byron Bridle was trying to explain in 2021, where it's not only the ovaries, it goes lots of places, including the bone marrow, which can't be, can't be good.

01:01:45.186 --> 01:01:46.988
And again, I'm not critiquing Mike.

01:01:47.468 --> 01:01:52.191
I'm just trying to augment him, especially because he's on this goofy podcast with this goofy dude.

01:01:56.241 --> 01:01:57.122
You think it's obvious.

01:01:57.522 --> 01:02:10.354
So you come from a farmer background, but presumably from the kind of more of the sort of production side rather than the kind of in a lab.

01:02:11.246 --> 01:02:14.488
tinkering with formulae side of it.

01:02:14.508 --> 01:02:25.795
I was a research scientist, really, so I would say I managed to do for a living what I... I mean, make sure Solar Fire 9... Of course, Pamela is correct.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:37.702
One of the assertions that I'm making is that placebo batches could have been used to fool thousands of people into thinking that, wow, I got a transfection, I didn't feel a thing.

01:02:38.362 --> 01:02:39.763
I got two and I didn't feel a thing.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:53.480
And because of the way that subsequent activations are where the danger would be, it makes really good sense that somebody would get a placebo and then get a live one.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:04.951
And then because they only got one live one, they never really had the kind of adverse reaction they would have or more likely to have if every one of those doses were an active transfection.

01:03:06.485 --> 01:03:23.554
And I think that because of the cheap and easy possibility that would also allow them to manufacture many more doses if half of them could be placebo, it would allow them to very easily disguise the data collection

01:03:25.043 --> 01:03:40.574
and very easily encode essentially into the distribution a very detailed observation of dosage and exposure and all this other stuff, knowing where the placebos were that no one else knew where they were.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:47.919
And so everybody that's even administering these shots would have experienced weeks where there were placebos at their location.

01:03:47.959 --> 01:03:52.683
And then as a result, then I'm like, wow, it's really rare that people have an accident.

01:03:53.789 --> 01:04:01.176
And so I don't think you can underestimate how it could even be that 75% of the shots produced were placebo.

01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:03.238
What motivation do they have?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:10.926
How many people are actually gonna go out and get the requisite test that will describe whether or not something happened after that injection?

01:04:11.366 --> 01:04:11.767
Nobody.

01:04:12.663 --> 01:04:14.125
Nobody was gonna check it.

01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:24.601
So there was no reason for them not to roll out even 75% placebos in order to make sure they could pay close attention to where they rolled out the hot ones.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:51.183
And no one, not one person has even considered how easy it would be to do this, how few people would be required to do it, and how the capability of the entire national security apparatus that is supposed to be responding to this crisis would be necessarily increased by orders of magnitude simply by a few people agreeing, oh yeah, I never thought about that.

01:04:51.663 --> 01:04:56.926
Jay's right, we should just use placebo in half these doses and it'll be very easy to meet the quotas.

01:04:57.774 --> 01:04:58.597
Stop lying!

01:05:00.345 --> 01:05:04.046
do for a hobby, which I like to tinker with mechanical things.

01:05:04.086 --> 01:05:10.509
But that's also where what we just see Zardog saying, that that's also where all these other ingredients come in.

01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:27.675
Because if you start to speculate about the other things that are in the shot, you are definitely not speculating about the possibility of them using mass placebo to get everybody to believe that the shot is harmless, that transfection is harmless, that transfection worked.

01:05:30.356 --> 01:05:40.390
And if there's nothing really to save us from except for bad protocols and bad ideas, then the transfection, even if it was a placebo, could be perceived to work.

01:05:41.581 --> 01:05:49.507
You see them apart, work out how they work and when they're broken, why that is and how to fix them.

01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:56.252
Those are exactly the same questions as I was trying to deal with in research pharmacology.

01:05:56.432 --> 01:05:57.352
How does the body work?

01:05:57.813 --> 01:05:58.974
What's different in disease?

01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:01.175
What could you do to try and fix it?

01:06:01.235 --> 01:06:06.099
And so all I'm doing is applying those skills to looking at the vaccines.

01:06:07.259 --> 01:06:10.182
And because of my training in mechanistic toxicology,

01:06:10.862 --> 01:06:12.163
how things harm you when they do.

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:17.947
I feel like I'm looking over the shoulder of the person who made them, thinking, what were you trying to do?

01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:21.009
So I am 100% certain.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:26.493
I've also, a couple of years ago, I called out three of the four.

01:06:27.134 --> 01:06:33.899
Remember, one of the people that we know that did some experiments of some kind on supposedly batches of

01:06:34.879 --> 01:06:45.389
of the shot was some guy in Japan named Kevin McCarran, and he supposedly didn't find any signal of phosphate in some of these, which is a placebo.

01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:55.940
Or maybe it's just a lipid nanoparticle with no transfection, and so then you have a sort of control, right?

01:06:57.014 --> 01:07:07.766
a control group that would be very useful to a pharma company that was trying to develop a long-term plan on how to use transfection effectively, or was trying to transition into personalized medicine based on this theater.

01:07:09.195 --> 01:07:18.562
this theater that all the hot lots are hot, and all the lots are hot, and they're trying to kill us, and maybe it's in multiple things, but nobody, no one thinks about placebo.

01:07:19.142 --> 01:07:19.743
Nobody.

01:07:19.823 --> 01:07:25.066
It's weird, because it would be the easiest way to do it, and the most foolproof way to do it.

01:07:25.447 --> 01:07:31.611
People who I believe are responsible, at least on paper, for these materials inside the drug companies.

01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:38.196
In practice, it probably isn't them, but I know the senior vice presidents or executive vice presidents of three of the four companies.

01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:39.757
personally.

01:07:39.857 --> 01:07:40.498
It pains me.

01:07:40.518 --> 01:07:41.959
These are former colleagues.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.981
This part is especially compelling.

01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:47.303
I really think it is especially compelling.

01:07:47.643 --> 01:07:50.785
I saw a clip of this already where he seems to name names I think here.

01:07:51.586 --> 01:07:59.692
And so I wrote to them to tell them what you're doing wrong and you need to resign or debate me or injunct me.

01:08:00.012 --> 01:08:03.835
Speaking of syringes, Jason, I have a

01:08:05.609 --> 01:08:06.269
I don't know what to say.

01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:33.406
I have an uncle who is in the perfume business and in early 2019, because the metal seals on top of perfume bottles and the pumps of perfume bottles, a lot of those small disc parts, which form the interface between the glass bottle and the metal parts of the pump, those parts are all interchangeable with injectable bottles.

01:08:34.449 --> 01:08:43.132
And in 2019, all of that sort of factory infrastructure just disappeared from availability for wholesale production.

01:08:44.892 --> 01:08:55.676
He couldn't make stuff because they couldn't order the parts for the bottles because all of that capacity had for some reason been reserved.

01:08:56.416 --> 01:09:02.838
And only in retrospect, did he tell me that story in a swimming pool last year when we were there in the summer.

01:09:04.514 --> 01:09:15.078
And because I was there, I actually gave my ACIP meeting statement I gave from his basement, because we happened to be there for vacation that day.

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:18.879
And I wrote it on my way to his house in the car with the family.

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:22.781
So it was weird because that was a really interesting weekend.

01:09:22.801 --> 01:09:26.622
We had a lot of frank discussions about what I was doing for a living and why I was doing it.

01:09:27.362 --> 01:09:31.344
And he just told me this story of how he wasn't able to make a new product because

01:09:31.864 --> 01:09:33.806
he couldn't get the pieces.

01:09:34.787 --> 01:09:42.834
All of those factories had essentially been co-opted for something else that he later found out he assumed was the production of the transfection.

01:09:43.514 --> 01:09:44.836
And so they needed the bottles.

01:09:45.356 --> 01:09:48.579
They have to make the bottles, but they don't need to put anything in them.

01:09:48.699 --> 01:09:49.700
Saline is safer.

01:09:51.772 --> 01:09:52.232
didn't do any.

01:09:52.853 --> 01:09:57.576
One of them, one of them resigns, leaving their golden handcuffs on the table.

01:09:58.497 --> 01:10:04.480
One of them, a guy called Mitai Manon, left Johnson & Johnson without, without reason, just left.

01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:05.561
What do you think he was?

01:10:05.981 --> 01:10:07.002
I'm pretty sure I did it.

01:10:07.543 --> 01:10:08.263
Full of shame?

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.144
I think he didn't realize.

01:10:10.444 --> 01:10:11.965
I think he was so high.

01:10:12.726 --> 01:10:14.467
I think he'd not even thought about it.

01:10:14.487 --> 01:10:15.628
Well, that's a result.

01:10:16.248 --> 01:10:16.989
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:21.532
But the other two, I'm afraid, James and Mene, you know what you're doing.

01:10:22.132 --> 01:10:46.809
So even if in practice, I mean he just said James and Minnie that's pretty hardcore and Even if he gets things wrong, I have never had any other feeling other than Mike Eden is actually Stepping out actually as far as he possibly can do without feeling like he's really risking his life and now Maybe he's come to some

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:53.715
piece that they're probably not going to offer him, but I think that's a very risky thing to do.

01:10:54.015 --> 01:10:57.598
It could just be the military is doing it and the drug companies are white labeling them.

01:10:58.259 --> 01:10:59.119
That's certainly possible.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.885
But in your days when you were in Big Pharma, you

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:13.299
believe, which I don't think you do now, you believed in vaccines as a basically good thing.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.681
You don't now, do you, at all?

01:11:15.761 --> 01:11:16.522
No, exactly.

01:11:16.582 --> 01:11:19.043
So I was programmed like we all are.

01:11:19.283 --> 01:11:22.765
I had had nothing to do with vaccines professionally, knew nothing about them.

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.406
Interestingly, the vaccine

01:11:25.367 --> 01:11:26.968
research and development work.

01:11:27.188 --> 01:11:33.350
As far as I can tell in pharma, it's always on a different site from the so-called small molecule works.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.871
It's like, oh, I think I've got an idea why that might be.

01:11:36.231 --> 01:11:38.312
So I've been bumping into them in the coffee queue.

01:11:38.812 --> 01:11:40.893
And I would have worked it out.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:53.497
But because it was in a place hundreds or thousands of miles away, and I had no reason to be involved professionally, I just rolled up and got my jabs, had my children injected.

01:11:55.168 --> 01:11:56.209
That's pretty hardcore.

01:11:56.289 --> 01:12:03.272
In retrospect, he realizes that the vaccine parts of these companies are never in the same buildings as the rest of the buildings.

01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:07.014
They're never even in the same town sometimes, he says.

01:12:08.995 --> 01:12:21.942
And before the pandemic, like Jonathan Cooley of GigaOM Biological, I had no idea that there were people that were fighting the vaccine schedule in America as criminal.

01:12:23.004 --> 01:12:30.667
I had no idea that this fight went back to the 80s and early 90s, and that there were two movies called Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2.

01:12:30.727 --> 01:12:34.709
I had no idea when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:34.769 --> 01:12:35.790
called me in April of 2022.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.550
I had no idea.

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:40.672
I had not seen Vaxxed.

01:12:45.434 --> 01:12:51.777
And so I still gave my kids their shots when we moved from our dream little house that we lost

01:12:52.836 --> 01:13:04.083
as a result of me losing my job, to moving to this new school district that we're now in, I gave my kids their required shots to go to the new school.

01:13:06.004 --> 01:13:13.008
And then two weeks later, I watched Vaxxed, because one of the good people inside of CHD was like, wait, what, you haven't seen that?

01:13:13.048 --> 01:13:14.389
You don't even know what I'm talking about?

01:13:14.609 --> 01:13:17.190
Oh my gosh, you don't, what are you working here for?

01:13:20.452 --> 01:13:21.253
And so Mike Eden,

01:13:23.226 --> 01:13:32.089
Peter McCullough, Jonathan Cooey, I think are the only three people right now who are saying, don't take a vaccine again.

01:13:32.269 --> 01:13:33.329
All of them, just stop.

01:13:33.389 --> 01:13:34.990
If you have kids, don't do it.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:36.730
Peter McCullough said that.

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:38.831
I think Mike Eden is saying that right now.

01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:41.091
And Gigo and Biological is definitely saying that.

01:13:45.813 --> 01:13:50.114
So yeah, I think just a little observation.

01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:52.255
Let's just see if this rings true.

01:13:54.269 --> 01:14:02.095
There's only one category of products from the biopharmaceutical industry that you cannot question or challenge.

01:14:02.395 --> 01:14:03.276
It's vaccines.

01:14:03.957 --> 01:14:12.663
You can challenge individual drug categories like statins or an individual compound like atorvastatin or Lipitor.

01:14:13.524 --> 01:14:15.626
People may not like you, but you can do it.

01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:17.347
You don't automatically get fired.

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:26.614
But if you raise a question about a jab, you will find your professional body will fall on you, even if your professional body is architecture.

01:14:27.235 --> 01:14:35.101
Now, if you see what he's pointing out here, he's pointing out that these limited spectrums of debate about, oh, statins, cholesterol is good for you.

01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:36.662
You need cholesterol.

01:14:37.082 --> 01:14:40.525
These things were set in motion and put in place

01:14:43.098 --> 01:14:52.386
so that the general populace could be engaged in a limited spectrum of debate where we argued about broken science.

01:14:53.267 --> 01:15:02.115
And we argued about how p-values don't mean anything and that randomized control trials without enough people in them can be used to create the illusion of something that isn't real.

01:15:03.656 --> 01:15:09.602
But then we never bother to ask the real important question, which is where would that system

01:15:10.447 --> 01:15:12.829
be most malevolently used against us.

01:15:13.769 --> 01:15:16.711
And that's the vaccine schedule, and especially in America.

01:15:17.652 --> 01:15:18.953
And that's what Mike is saying.

01:15:19.013 --> 01:15:22.595
That's what Peter McCullough has had the courage to say, and not very many other people.

01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:26.078
And I would include in that not very many other people.

01:15:27.159 --> 01:15:28.279
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:28.319 --> 01:15:29.100
has never said it.

01:15:30.021 --> 01:15:31.622
Merrill Nass has never said it.

01:15:32.509 --> 01:15:33.809
Mary Holland has never said it.

01:15:33.849 --> 01:15:44.072
And it may be because they're afraid of the legal consequences of saying that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal, even if you just compare it to other Western countries, they can't say it.

01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:49.294
And it's probably because their money comes from people who don't want them to say it.

01:15:50.868 --> 01:15:57.191
It's not because their money comes from autism moms and autism dads that are trying to save other children around them.

01:15:57.871 --> 01:15:59.732
It's not coming from those people.

01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:01.493
Their money comes from somewhere else.

01:16:02.354 --> 01:16:17.821
Otherwise they would just be fighting for what they were supposed to fight for and were fighting for to some extent before the pandemic, before Mary Holland took over CHD, before Merrill Nass had anything to do with the organization.

01:16:19.261 --> 01:16:21.642
when it was Brian Hooker and Laura Bonham.

01:16:24.343 --> 01:16:35.446
And so I don't know what's going on right now, but I do know that the places that we thought the fight was being fought were actually controlled from within, sabotaged from within.

01:16:37.147 --> 01:16:42.988
Mike Eden is one of the few truth tellers out there, and Bobby, he did well in October of 2020, he did.

01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:44.609
He did really well.

01:16:46.667 --> 01:17:04.564
But instead of using his platform to say that the national security state will murder people and lie about it in order to protect the scam that is public health and vaccine schedule and the fear of disease, he made it about free speech and freedom.

01:17:08.018 --> 01:17:08.398
Darn it.

01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:40.842
They have this era in mind for them.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:42.764
I don't think they've ever... See?

01:17:43.645 --> 01:17:48.512
When they were first invented, they had this era in mind for them.

01:17:49.393 --> 01:17:52.196
That's a giant statement because what is he talking about?

01:17:52.637 --> 01:17:54.560
He's talking about man and his future.

01:17:55.595 --> 01:18:21.600
The book from 1953, where Julian Huxley and Hilary Koprowski and Joshua Lederberg and others write essays about how nations are holding us back and that we need global governance and a forward-thinking, long-term thinking vision for what to do as a human species and how to better take control of our heretofore random evolution.

01:18:24.864 --> 01:18:34.256
And so it is with no doubt in my mind that I agree with Mike Eden that the whole idea of vaccines and public health has always been a scam.

01:18:34.316 --> 01:18:41.506
And that's why you can write a book about how most of these diseases went away with sanitation and nutrition and better water and whatever.

01:18:42.668 --> 01:18:51.370
And they rolled out those vaccines at the same time that that happened, at the same time that they took away DDT, at the same time that all of this stuff is happening.

01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:56.371
They lied to us about the magic of one particular thing that we're not allowed to question.

01:18:56.811 --> 01:19:00.832
And it has been going on since our parents were children.

01:19:00.892 --> 01:19:10.114
That's why it's so dangerous because we inherited this charlatanism, this mythology from the people that gave it to our parents.

01:19:11.087 --> 01:19:12.729
That's why it's so hard to see through.

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:15.753
It's like our parents still believe in Santa Claus.

01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:21.299
It would be really hard for us not to, especially if they work together to keep creating the illusion.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:29.930
And in this case, it only takes the national security state doing it and the TV and media getting ever better at convincing us.

01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:32.015
ever been useful.

01:19:32.536 --> 01:19:43.081
I think the very first idea, some clever people, maybe it was the 17th century, thought in the future, it'd be quite useful to be able to access the bodies of the people.

01:19:43.981 --> 01:19:46.283
And I think they've always been for that.

01:19:46.363 --> 01:19:47.763
I don't think it goes back that far.

01:19:47.823 --> 01:19:49.884
I think it actually goes back to a few people.

01:19:49.964 --> 01:19:54.607
I think the idea maybe started in some places in

01:19:55.387 --> 01:19:58.010
In the uk, but there's a lot of people in america.

01:19:58.050 --> 01:20:10.183
There were a lot of thinkers in america A lot of these ideas were developed in america Um, and so we we need to make sure that we own that part of this history See now i'm a completely crazy conspiracy theorist.

01:20:10.503 --> 01:20:12.245
Yeah, but thing is

01:20:14.674 --> 01:20:21.219
I sincerely believe what I just said is true because nothing else fits quite as well as that.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.881
That's what scientists do.

01:20:23.181 --> 01:20:31.488
It's certainly a better explanation for what Stephen Hadfield was doing in Rhodesia and why Meryl Nass was involved in Ebola all those years ago.

01:20:31.548 --> 01:20:33.129
It's because it's all one theater.

01:20:33.169 --> 01:20:38.013
It's an ongoing theater and that's why people who were read in through their dad

01:20:38.854 --> 01:20:42.417
You know, people who have grown up in these families, that's why they're in it.

01:20:42.497 --> 01:20:49.262
That's why Jeff Bezos exists, or Robert Malone exists, or a lot of these people's dads, like Kevin McKernan.

01:20:49.283 --> 01:20:58.410
They all explain why these people are in, because they are part of an ongoing plan to invert our sovereignty under the pretense of pandemic potential.

01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:01.571
looking for fit, and now that wasn't fit.

01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:03.271
But everything fits with that story.

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:05.851
What was the particular thing?

01:21:06.191 --> 01:21:15.453
So quite early on you were, these things are bad because they're being rushed out and vaccines normally take much longer to bring out.

01:21:16.153 --> 01:21:19.974
Any medical product would take longer than they were taking.

01:21:20.074 --> 01:21:20.994
Yeah.

01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:23.875
So you smelled a rat there.

01:21:25.049 --> 01:21:35.223
But what was it that made you go full Delingpole, as it were, and made you realize that all vaccines, what was the prompt?

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.426
I don't think I got there in one go.

01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:44.452
Yeah, I mean, I initially just focused on we were being lied to.

01:21:44.652 --> 01:21:45.993
I knew people on the TV.

01:21:46.173 --> 01:21:52.258
I've been around long enough that people who were in public health positions would appear on your television.

01:21:52.358 --> 01:21:55.100
I probably worked with them at some point 30 or 40 years ago.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.063
And you get to recognize whether people are telling you lies on the telly.

01:21:59.723 --> 01:22:03.626
And so from the earliest time, like in February or January of 2020, it was like,

01:22:04.887 --> 01:22:06.369
Why are you lying to me, Pat?

01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:16.021
I say to people, once you spot the authorities lying to you, making one serious lie, why would you believe anything else they ever said?

01:22:16.942 --> 01:22:22.769
So from that earliest point, I was highly attuned to what are they up to?

01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:31.155
But the thing that pushed me into being very concerned about the vaccine was, because I just thought they're never going to do this.

01:22:31.195 --> 01:22:33.056
They're telling us it'll be around the end of the year.

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:35.478
I remember saying to my wife, it'll take five or six years.

01:22:36.279 --> 01:22:38.100
Because that's how long it takes.

01:22:39.161 --> 01:22:43.904
I have friends in manufacturing who've spent longer in manufacturing than I have in research.

01:22:44.324 --> 01:22:51.469
And they've said that development of the methods alone to work out whether you've got what you say after all the steps of manufacture,

01:22:52.149 --> 01:23:03.584
Takes about two years just the methods right if you've decided to make something It will take you two years before you've got all of the tests and methods Validated and agreed the whole thing was done in 11 months.

01:23:03.664 --> 01:23:06.948
It's clearly nonsense so they either made them beforehand or

01:23:07.637 --> 01:23:17.605
which means it was nothing to do with a so-called infectious disease event, or to help with the torpedoes and just threw whatever they wanted into the vials.

01:23:18.245 --> 01:23:19.386
Neither of those are acceptable.

01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:31.556
So I knew that once I realized they weren't actually going to authorize them, which they didn't really, the idea that we have that our regulators have authorized them, that's not true.

01:23:32.697 --> 01:23:35.058
They're not even classified as medical products.

01:23:35.839 --> 01:23:39.601
They are classified as covered countermeasures in the states.

01:23:40.701 --> 01:23:42.782
And they are not authorized by the FDA.

01:23:42.822 --> 01:23:48.625
They are dispensed according to the Health and Human Services Secretary, which is part of the Department of Defense.

01:23:49.085 --> 01:23:50.226
So they're not medical products.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.407
But in 2020, I thought they were.

01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:58.910
And so when I could see they were going to run out, they were coming at us, I thought, this can only be malign.

01:24:00.151 --> 01:24:01.251
But you know what that means?

01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:02.172
The fact that you

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:08.205
Difficult, tricky Mike Yeadon who just won't take any shit.

01:24:09.642 --> 01:24:25.026
If it took you until now to work out that vaccines don't work, never have worked, ever, does that not mean that there could be lots of people working in the pharmaceutical industry who remain that ignorant?

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:26.226
Oh, I'm sure that's true.

01:24:26.547 --> 01:24:31.268
I think without the stimulus of this event, and it's felt like a PhD.

01:24:31.888 --> 01:24:33.288
My PhD was done in three years.

01:24:33.328 --> 01:24:34.949
We went four and a half years in.

01:24:35.731 --> 01:24:37.873
and I'm still learning, so yeah.

01:24:38.153 --> 01:24:39.954
I feel exactly the same way as Mike.

01:24:42.116 --> 01:24:57.947
I feel like I've done probably more work exploring wider than I did in my PhD because my PhD was of course focused on acetylcholine receptors in a particular mouse, in a particular brain region, in a particular set of neurons.

01:24:59.008 --> 01:25:03.411
And I was challenged to focus on that razor sharp question

01:25:04.537 --> 01:25:14.120
And so I read a lot about those details, but nothing about nearby, well, comparatively little about questions that weren't directly related to my own.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:32.646
And over the course of reevaluating my fundamental understanding of biology and trying to factor in what public health really can be and can't be and what the vaccine schedule can be and can't be has been a long and arduous journey.

01:25:33.433 --> 01:25:45.780
that people like Kevin McCairn or people like Kevin McKernan or people like Charles Rixey will never engage in because again, they are being paid by this apparatus, by this national security.

01:25:47.331 --> 01:25:59.635
They are being paid comfort and fame to not question these places where I would say, if science is broken, where is it most malevolently being used against our future?

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:13.978
And Mike Yeadon has very succinctly identified the vaccine schedule as an ongoing narrative that was probably from the very beginning understood and pushed with the current era in mind.

01:26:14.038 --> 01:26:15.799
It is a spectacular statement.

01:26:16.019 --> 01:26:21.263
And I'm sure most of my colleagues still think what I thought was true, they still think it's true.

01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:24.565
They still believe in vaccines, and they still believe in the COVID?

01:26:25.726 --> 01:26:26.186
Probably.

01:26:26.206 --> 01:26:28.388
I mean, it's just utterly bizarre, isn't it?

01:26:28.488 --> 01:26:30.849
It's just, yeah, I don't know.

01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:33.872
Mostly, I sense people just want to move on, move on.

01:26:33.892 --> 01:26:42.298
So if you can't move on, this is act one of a multi-act play that, if we let them, finishes with total loss of freedom.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:46.981
Digital totalitarian tyranny, and it's so easy.

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:47.361
Enslavement.

01:26:47.421 --> 01:26:55.468
Just dispense with money and give you only digital money, which most of you are using only digital money unless you've heeded the call to only use cash.

01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:57.890
So digital money is so convenient.

01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:02.974
All they need to do is blow up cash, which they could do in one of half a dozen ways, plausibly.

01:27:03.654 --> 01:27:11.761
And the other one is make it a requirement you carry and present digital ID, a single global new format of digital ID.

01:27:13.282 --> 01:27:14.323
That's all they need.

01:27:14.383 --> 01:27:18.485
If they've got those two things, they can say, Mike, we just heard there's a pandemic.

01:27:18.725 --> 01:27:26.549
And don't worry, in 90 days, the pharmaceutical industry will have a jab and you will be taking it or your digital ID will become invalid.

01:27:26.929 --> 01:27:29.930
And without that, you won't be able to spend any of your digital money or move.

01:27:30.571 --> 01:27:32.331
Now, remember, he's explaining it.

01:27:32.411 --> 01:27:35.693
But the reality is, is that none of us are ever going to accept that.

01:27:36.453 --> 01:27:37.354
It's for our kids.

01:27:38.328 --> 01:27:56.916
And the way that they will do it is with a lie about anonymity on social media and artificial intelligence fakes on social media being something that requires the government to step in and start to making sure that only real people are on the internet and that

01:27:57.516 --> 01:28:06.500
and that these AI videos and these AI imposter things can be accurately identified and tracked from the people that make them.

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:15.184
And make no mistake about it, if you're playing with AI right now, you are being monitored and your activity is being monitored, and that data is being collected.

01:28:15.244 --> 01:28:16.004
That's for sure.

01:28:16.564 --> 01:28:23.047
Because AI is definitely a military program that is being released in a limited functionality set for you.

01:28:24.537 --> 01:28:36.567
to convince you of its relevance, to convince you that it is out there and actively engaged in something that can be more easily explained by simple programming and artificial elevation.

01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:39.409
So that's what I've said to people.

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:42.432
Elon and Twitter will be unified with an ID push.

01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:43.373
Absolutely.

01:28:43.613 --> 01:28:46.235
Substack will require the same ID to log in.

01:28:46.856 --> 01:28:47.496
Absolutely.

01:28:47.536 --> 01:28:48.517
All of this.

01:28:48.777 --> 01:28:49.498
Absolutely.

01:28:50.663 --> 01:29:01.414
PeerTube will never require an ID, but if your internet provider requires a digital ID, then we're really in trouble.

01:29:01.815 --> 01:29:04.558
I think signing up for and using

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:10.078
Digital ID is the entry door to the global murder machine.

01:29:10.238 --> 01:29:12.541
And if you stay outside of it, there's a chance.

01:29:12.821 --> 01:29:16.165
If you enter it, you can't leave, because now everything is tied.

01:29:16.926 --> 01:29:21.411
Literally, you won't be able to move, access cash, fill your car, do anything.

01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:23.072
They'll say, beep your digital ID.

01:29:23.232 --> 01:29:23.913
Oh, it's not valid.

01:29:23.933 --> 01:29:24.974
What do you mean it's not valid?

01:29:25.034 --> 01:29:26.156
Oh, you haven't had the latest jab.

01:29:26.776 --> 01:29:30.960
So, and all the jabs coming at us are mRNA-based.

01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:37.467
I know for certain they are designed to injure, kill, and reduce fertility in survivors.

01:29:38.267 --> 01:29:41.190
So, I'm sorry, if you weren't there already, I noticed there weren't…

01:29:43.052 --> 01:29:45.595
a full wave of hands, I thought.

01:29:45.615 --> 01:29:52.503
I thought more people would be maybe as far down the rabbit hole as I am, but it's so simple to see it, isn't it?

01:29:52.603 --> 01:29:54.485
It's given to few, Mike, I have to say.

01:29:55.446 --> 01:29:56.527
Very few people who are

01:29:57.665 --> 01:30:02.826
quite this batshit level.

01:30:03.066 --> 01:30:03.586
We're probably a 10.

01:30:04.046 --> 01:30:06.967
Where were you in normy land?

01:30:07.647 --> 01:30:08.367
Complete normy?

01:30:08.687 --> 01:30:15.349
I was, apart from my climate change thing, I've just been rereading Watermelons.

01:30:16.169 --> 01:30:21.030
I'm trying to do a revised edition, which everyone's waiting for because I'm being really slow and it's annoying.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:31.631
And I read the last chapter that I wrote in one of the revised editions from 10 years ago, and it said...

01:30:32.697 --> 01:30:44.819
There is a cabal of very rich people who want to kill you and enslave you and stuff.

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:48.760
But when I wrote it, I was kind of writing it jokely.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.381
I kind of didn't really believe what I was writing.

01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:56.462
So I would say that I was pretty much a normie in those days.

01:30:57.822 --> 01:31:00.502
One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you... I was even more normie than you.

01:31:00.522 --> 01:31:04.483
41 years of listening to BBC Radio 4 in the morning.

01:31:05.403 --> 01:31:06.163
41 years!

01:31:07.644 --> 01:31:12.345
I was a teenager for God's sake, buying the times in my 20s until my early 60s.

01:31:13.745 --> 01:31:16.145
And I watched the news like five nights a week before I sleep.

01:31:17.525 --> 01:31:20.706
I don't think you could have found a much more normie person than me.

01:31:22.426 --> 01:31:23.447
I salute you.

01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:24.727
I really salute you.

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:25.747
The thing is...

01:31:31.242 --> 01:31:41.606
Half my family, my dear wife, who from the earliest days when I was saying, you know, this and that, she would say, she said, I believe you, but how come no one else is saying it?

01:31:42.166 --> 01:31:45.947
And it's only later we realized that people were frightened or censored.

01:31:46.587 --> 01:31:47.888
Sounds like my wife, Bela.

01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:53.135
It's good to have a good friend in your corner, never mind a best friend.

01:31:53.256 --> 01:31:57.422
But people who aren't close to me, I've got family all around the world.

01:31:57.662 --> 01:32:05.814
The ones that are not in this country, to a man and a woman, all think and have said to each other, Mike has literally lost his mind.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:06.615
Yeah.

01:32:07.646 --> 01:32:12.650
And I mean, I've spoken to some of them, and I've explained very clearly in writing and verbally.

01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:16.433
And it's just, no, no, you're completely crazy, Mike.

01:32:16.794 --> 01:32:20.016
I never thought my brother would lose it completely like you have.

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.938
But, you know, well, good luck.

01:32:23.159 --> 01:32:24.120
That's my sister Jane.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:24.941
She emigrated in 79.

01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:27.743
And she's been multiply jabbed.

01:32:27.763 --> 01:32:29.124
There you go.

01:32:29.965 --> 01:32:31.106
I have a brother like that.

01:32:31.186 --> 01:32:33.648
My parents think I'm nuts.

01:32:34.497 --> 01:32:35.717
I've lost my mind or something.

01:32:35.757 --> 01:32:37.558
I'm an egomaniac or something like that.

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:37.938
I don't know.

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:41.778
And it's frustrating, right?

01:32:41.818 --> 01:32:58.441
Because it isn't their fault if groups of people on the internet and groups of people on TV are put in front of them by artificial military programs.

01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:03.242
And that limited spectrum of debate is reinforced by four people agreeing.

01:33:04.705 --> 01:33:15.132
than like the Ash Experiment or the Milgram Experiment or whatever all these other examples of this kind of effect are.

01:33:15.433 --> 01:33:16.473
They don't stand a chance.

01:33:19.776 --> 01:33:30.163
And so the only way to free them is going to be love and kindness and understanding and objective, calm,

01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:37.330
What I've been doing over the last year is not the way we're going to get to new people.

01:33:38.731 --> 01:33:42.993
By calling out bad guys and saying how bad they are, we're not going to get to new people.

01:33:44.274 --> 01:34:01.622
We need to point out objectively what has been wrong for the last four years, what people have been getting wrong for the last four years, and how if you just reorient your understanding and reverence for your own biology, it becomes very obvious where broken science

01:34:02.952 --> 01:34:10.888
where the broken academic system that we have in America and around the world, where the broken funding system

01:34:12.478 --> 01:34:16.121
is most malevolently being used against our children's future?

01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:18.003
That's the question we need to ask.

01:34:18.563 --> 01:34:21.526
Yeah, I wanted to move on to the really depressing stuff a bit later on.

01:34:22.707 --> 01:34:25.749
I thought what we'd do is just cover off the vaccine things.

01:34:25.769 --> 01:34:31.814
Because there'll be some people here who this is the first time they've encountered you.

01:34:32.215 --> 01:34:33.636
So they want the benefit of your wisdom.

01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:39.000
I was given a list of questions, some of which I'm not going to ask, some of which are quite rude.

01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:41.462
I'm not going to answer those.

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:42.523
You won't be able to shock me.

01:34:42.583 --> 01:34:43.844
I'm no longer shocked.

01:34:43.884 --> 01:34:44.544
They were rude about me.

01:34:44.604 --> 01:34:45.645
One was picking a fight with me.

01:34:45.785 --> 01:34:46.966
And I don't give a fine.

01:34:47.206 --> 01:34:50.187
If people don't like what I'm saying or don't believe me, that's fine.

01:34:50.728 --> 01:34:52.249
Go off and do whatever you want.

01:34:52.689 --> 01:34:54.710
I don't get anything from you believing me.

01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:59.393
So I broadcast and then you do with it what you will.

01:35:00.114 --> 01:35:03.496
One of the questions was from somebody saying,

01:35:05.439 --> 01:35:12.883
My office is full of pregnant women and only one has had a stillbirth or whatever.

01:35:13.003 --> 01:35:16.625
How do you explain that given that it's supposed to be making everyone infertile?

01:35:16.905 --> 01:35:18.706
I never said it was making everyone infertile.

01:35:19.266 --> 01:35:23.288
In fact, I said early on that I thought it was very...

01:35:24.614 --> 01:35:39.632
Although there are these multiple, independent, unnecessary, and obvious mechanisms of toxicity, no one could say, apart from the people actually doing it, and maybe not even them, how many people, what percentage of people it would harm.

01:35:40.373 --> 01:35:44.336
So, for example, we know alcohol is poisonous.

01:35:44.456 --> 01:35:48.278
If you take an amount equivalent to one glass of wine, most of you will be okay.

01:35:48.458 --> 01:35:50.039
Some will be a little tipsy and others not.

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:56.784
If you take a bottle of scotch worth of alcohol, most of you will be severely ill and some might actually die.

01:35:57.404 --> 01:36:00.226
So we've established, have we not, that there's a dose-response curve.

01:36:00.846 --> 01:36:01.826
Same with this material.

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:08.390
I have no way of knowing whether they thought one in a thousand would die or one in three.

01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:11.491
So I've never said that everyone will be infertile.

01:36:11.611 --> 01:36:17.234
And so we're not asking the right question, which is, again, we can go back, and this is for Mike specifically.

01:36:17.294 --> 01:36:18.115
Mike, think about it.

01:36:18.915 --> 01:36:31.791
if you just got through saying 10 minutes ago that they could never have gotten through all of the processes necessary to successfully manufacture these products, or they either started it early.

01:36:33.066 --> 01:36:36.327
then in either case, you're dealing with a scenario where what?

01:36:36.967 --> 01:36:45.211
The production, you said it yourself, could never have met the billions of doses that these Moderna people are talking about.

01:36:45.951 --> 01:36:50.372
Remember when there was a leaked conversation that the guy from Moderna said, we're gonna need a billion doses.

01:36:50.412 --> 01:37:02.297
And then everybody's like, but no one, not even this experienced pharma exec seems to understand that, well, one way they could meet that quota really easy without risking a damn thing.

01:37:03.999 --> 01:37:06.061
is to release placebo batches.

01:37:06.121 --> 01:37:16.028
Now man, oh man, it's kind of unfortunate because placebo batches would explain exactly why in many, many doctor's offices around the world, there nobody noticed anything.

01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:17.470
Come on.

01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:27.638
What I did say is they are establishing this technology and it will be used in the future repeatedly in order to erode the population.

01:37:27.938 --> 01:37:29.279
That's what I said in early 21.

01:37:29.499 --> 01:37:32.742
And I still think that's true three and a half years later.

01:37:33.516 --> 01:37:36.297
Yeah, that's why they're opening factories to make mRNA.

01:37:36.358 --> 01:37:45.862
The manufacturing potential, or sorry, the manufacturing capability exists if they're not actually making it.

01:37:46.503 --> 01:37:59.850
If the vast majority of what they're making is just placebo, just bottles with stuff in them that they're going to get people to perform the ritual, just the same as making masks and getting people to wear them was just getting them to perform the ritual.

01:38:00.939 --> 01:38:08.882
And this ritual is designed to convince people that this technology that Robert Malone invented is indeed finally coming to fruition.

01:38:11.623 --> 01:38:24.888
We gotta be very careful because we can escape if we can accurately articulate the truth or accurately articulate the most parsimonious explanation, which is murder and lies,

01:38:25.788 --> 01:38:27.489
placebo, etc.

01:38:48.215 --> 01:38:49.356
and I wish I wasn't right.

01:38:49.676 --> 01:38:50.916
And this could be different, right?

01:38:51.116 --> 01:38:57.059
We're in the fifth year, so the placebos could have only been now or in the beginning.

01:38:57.099 --> 01:39:01.161
Now that they have only willing takers, there's far less risk.

01:39:01.861 --> 01:39:14.907
The people that are using their transfections now are people that believe the transfections can't hurt them and are very likely not to connect an injury to the transfection already because they are participating.

01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:37.986
And so by rolling out the placebo in 2021 and 2022, when the most skeptical people were still actively being coerced successfully into taking the jab, those jabs were the ones that needed to bleed placebo because those people were much more likely to connect the jab to the injury.

01:39:39.502 --> 01:39:58.220
But now that we're four years in and the only people who are taking it are taking it from doctors who believe, and they believe because they believe they already took it, then these people are the least likely to connect a disconnected by time injury or allergy to the transfection once they make them hot.

01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.020
Do you see it?

01:39:59.841 --> 01:40:01.323
Holy shit, we've got him.

01:40:01.763 --> 01:40:03.646
But no one has rebutted it.

01:40:03.726 --> 01:40:10.253
So what I'm saying is so simple that if I was wrong, I would have some scientists writing to me or just publishing.

01:40:10.814 --> 01:40:12.416
This guy's come up with these mad ideas.

01:40:12.456 --> 01:40:13.156
This is why he's wrong.

01:40:13.457 --> 01:40:14.158
No one's done that.

01:40:14.938 --> 01:40:15.859
So there you go.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.064
Well, thank you for dealing with that one, because it's something a lot of us get.

01:40:20.565 --> 01:40:25.771
Those of us who were saying early on, don't take the vaccine.

01:40:27.393 --> 01:40:28.614
We get it thrown in our face.

01:40:29.175 --> 01:40:34.161
Well, you said that half the world would be dead by now, and they're not.

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.042
No, I never said that.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.844
And they're disappointed, aren't they, that more people haven't died?

01:40:37.924 --> 01:40:40.786
Because they're happy because it means that we're wrong.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:42.227
That's the most important thing.

01:40:42.247 --> 01:40:42.647
Exactly.

01:40:42.847 --> 01:40:47.491
But there's no getting away from the fact that people were lied to because there was not...

01:40:48.257 --> 01:40:50.058
pandemic, in my view, not a virus.

01:40:50.258 --> 01:40:52.278
There was no public health emergency.

01:40:52.878 --> 01:41:01.601
All the laws were changed to facilitate these dangerous materials to get approval, emergency use authorization.

01:41:01.981 --> 01:41:08.163
If that's the case, and the manufacturing capability was not there, or was preconceived,

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:31.205
then either way you look at it, the only way, and the easiest way, and the most foolproof way, and the cheapest way to assure that over the course of this operation, transfection and transformation would essentially be accepted as working, but having been rushed, would be to use placebo batches and then complain about double-stranded DNA contamination.

01:41:32.321 --> 01:41:36.625
be very clear about this, I think we are on the bullseye here.

01:41:37.086 --> 01:41:47.176
And then they were just lying to you about that because it was going around the back of our military countermeasures allowed in a public emergency, in a national emergency.

01:41:47.756 --> 01:41:50.399
And this goes back like 25 years, 50 years.

01:41:50.419 --> 01:41:52.721
It's like there's no getting away from it.

01:41:53.462 --> 01:42:03.269
It goes back to the Human Genome Project, when they realized that there was no way in hell they could sequence one genome effectively mapping the human genome.

01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:07.032
They probably found more variation than they've ever revealed.

01:42:07.112 --> 01:42:08.974
It's probably still remaining secret.

01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:13.897
They've found landmarks that they have misconstrued as being understanding.

01:42:13.937 --> 01:42:18.861
They've found maps and made maps that they've misconstrued as sequencing the whole genome.

01:42:19.798 --> 01:42:33.565
And even though they've made much progress since they declared they finished, they haven't still succeeded in generating the kind of fidelity of understanding that all academic biologists assume is already there.

01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:50.889
And that is the disturbing part of this, is that that level of mythology and what has been achieved or hasn't been achieved by the Human Genome Project is the giant lie that underpins all of academic biology and all of public health.

01:42:52.190 --> 01:43:17.511
If you understand what they haven't accomplished or have accomplished with the human genome and how far we have come and haven't come, you will understand that so many of the funding schemes, so many of the intellectual hamster wheels that entire universities, entire departments are stuck in are based on the idea that I guess we sequenced the whole genome and we know what all these genes do and so we might as well study them now.

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:20.053
Fortunately,

01:43:20.851 --> 01:43:23.993
The mounting horror is, and then now I'm completely relaxed about it.

01:43:24.053 --> 01:43:37.101
It's like, okay, I've got used to the fact there's 0.01% of humanity have spent their entire life, like mom and grandma and granddad and great-grandfather before them, working out how to lasso us useless eaters.

01:43:37.681 --> 01:43:44.865
And this is one of the things they're doing, and I am blessed to be able to spot this particular part of the in-dimensional chess game.

01:43:45.005 --> 01:43:46.406
It's like, okay, that's what they're doing.

01:43:47.927 --> 01:43:53.110
This is a question you're bound to get asked a lot, but understandably.

01:43:55.111 --> 01:43:59.774
Somebody said, my children and grandchildren were all vaccinated.

01:44:01.215 --> 01:44:07.138
Have you come upon any ways of undoing the damage of these?

01:44:07.558 --> 01:44:08.459
No, I haven't.

01:44:08.559 --> 01:44:11.140
This isn't an area that I've looked at in particular.

01:44:11.681 --> 01:44:16.664
I'm not a medical doctor, I'm a PhD scientist, so I haven't.

01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:17.885
I don't know.

01:44:21.047 --> 01:44:25.630
But these recent jabs are not like previous material.

01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:27.591
Previous materials were plausible.

01:44:28.312 --> 01:44:31.294
If you believed in the virus causes the disease story,

01:44:32.296 --> 01:44:35.340
the design of the old style vaccines, I think made sense.

01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:41.206
Now, I think in this sense, I would agree with Mike Eden, but you have to be a little bit more biologically precise.

01:44:42.047 --> 01:44:48.574
If a bacterial infection or pathogenic infection produces a toxic protein or the

01:44:49.975 --> 01:45:09.987
the glycoprotein produced by the bacteria during an infection like tuberculosis or something like that is a toxic protein for which antibodies can be formed, then it's not a terrible idea because again, those antibodies are formed during the natural exposure to that pathogen as well.

01:45:10.487 --> 01:45:30.582
But I think that that idea, which is not terrible in immunology and probably maybe even applied to something like the smallpox virus when it was done by a variolation in the skin, that I think there is a possibility that there's some real biology at the basis of this, but it has to do with our bodies dealing with

01:45:33.038 --> 01:45:55.648
damage-associated molecular patterns, not molecular patterns associated with particular bad guys, particular toxins are remembered, particular bad combinations of amino acids that are nasty enzymes or that are nasty binding proteins are mapped and remembered by the immune system as foreign signals that can be tissue damaging.

01:45:56.775 --> 01:46:17.512
And I think we have to start to reorient our understanding about the challenge that the immune system faces, and where that challenge comes from, and not start with their default, which is that there are all these unique pathogens, and until you meet them, your immune system is completely naive to them, and therefore you're completely vulnerable to them.

01:46:17.892 --> 01:46:19.554
And that foundational myth

01:46:20.074 --> 01:46:24.199
is where this public health mythology rests.

01:46:24.279 --> 01:46:35.632
That's where we break it because, again, the ability to sequence stuff and look in the background for all kinds of bad guys is part of the toolbox that was essentially provided

01:46:36.232 --> 01:46:43.036
by the Human Genome Project, provided to people like Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak by the Human Genome Project.

01:46:43.076 --> 01:46:50.079
And so they went on to take these deceptive tools and to use them as high fidelity measuring sticks.

01:46:50.139 --> 01:46:51.300
And that's ridiculous.

01:46:51.400 --> 01:47:00.545
And that, that is the heart of the new biology we all need to learn as we reorient and try to extricate ourselves from this mythology.

01:47:01.478 --> 01:47:07.641
That's because they told us that they grew up some of that organism and they weakened it or killed it with heat or chemicals.

01:47:07.661 --> 01:47:09.642
But that was all a lie as well, wasn't it?

01:47:09.682 --> 01:47:10.402
Yes, it was.

01:47:10.442 --> 01:47:13.303
But it's because the infectious agents aren't there at all.

01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:15.605
You've read that book, haven't you?

01:47:15.645 --> 01:47:18.866
The one that tells you about how they made smallpox.

01:47:19.066 --> 01:47:25.229
So now we're starting to talk about how the infectious agents aren't there and I think we're getting into very dangerous territory.

01:47:26.529 --> 01:47:30.011
And the reason why I think we're getting into very dangerous territory is very, very simple.

01:47:32.461 --> 01:47:38.579
because our gut barrier and our lung barrier and our skin barrier are real barriers.

01:47:38.679 --> 01:47:40.183
And if they are breached,

01:47:41.727 --> 01:47:54.618
then the bacteria in symbiotic relationship with us in our gut, in symbiotic relationship with us on the surface of our skin, in symbiotic relationship with us in our nasal passages, in our mucosa, etc.

01:47:55.198 --> 01:48:04.866
Those symbiotic bacteria are producing toxins which our body can tolerate, but not in large quantities and not if they go systemic.

01:48:07.409 --> 01:48:22.461
So it is impossible to underestimate how we can generalize across sickness and illness that has to do with fever and chills and nausea and headache as a breach of a barrier.

01:48:23.842 --> 01:48:29.526
And that's why so many of these things share very common symptomologies.

01:48:29.606 --> 01:48:34.470
A severe flu with chills and then fever

01:48:36.809 --> 01:48:38.432
and sweating and cold sweats.

01:48:38.492 --> 01:48:43.079
Those things happen when bacterial toxins breach your lung barrier.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:50.832
But curiously enough, the exact same symptomology set was evoked by the repeated

01:48:53.015 --> 01:48:55.097
breaking of the skin barrier on my leg.

01:48:55.838 --> 01:49:07.228
Twice I have had my eczema allow things through, which have essentially given me all of the symptoms of what you could call COVID or the flu or whatever.

01:49:07.309 --> 01:49:08.069
I got chills.

01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.830
I had fever.

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:10.331
I had cold sweats.

01:49:11.893 --> 01:49:12.794
I wasn't hungry.

01:49:15.103 --> 01:49:17.366
I wanted to sleep and wrap up.

01:49:17.446 --> 01:49:29.439
I woke up and the muscles felt great to stretch out, exactly like what I used to call flu, exactly how I got sick when I was riding my bike in 2019, but I never attributed it to a novel virus.

01:49:29.499 --> 01:49:34.084
I attributed it to breathing the smoke of automobiles every morning and every afternoon.

01:49:37.093 --> 01:50:01.081
But now suddenly all things are attributable to viruses that can be described by sequencing reactions based on technology from the fraudulent human genome project and based on experimental methodologies that are simply DNA and RNA synthetically created and then transformed and transfected into cell cultures and animals.

01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:02.882
And that is called virology.

01:50:03.806 --> 01:50:16.370
And that illusion was created by people like David Baltimore, who is a direct descendant of, of course, Joshua Lederberg, one of the granddaddies of this thinking.

01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:18.491
And that's what this is about, these ideas.

01:50:19.761 --> 01:50:45.630
It's as Mike pointed out earlier, these ideas and where they were seeded and by whom they were seeded is what is most important for us to figure out right now because it is the continual mentoring of these ideas onto young people, the passing along of the mythology that they now want us to do for our children so that everybody in the world accepts transfection as having worked and having saved us from a gain-of-function virus.

01:50:48.638 --> 01:50:49.699
And vaccines are great.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.543
And they'll be even better in the future because of this wonderful new technology.

01:50:55.063 --> 01:50:55.604
Vaccines.

01:50:56.284 --> 01:50:57.705
No, I don't think I've read that one.

01:50:58.146 --> 01:50:58.946
From corpses.

01:51:01.448 --> 01:51:01.749
Really?

01:51:01.929 --> 01:51:04.030
Yeah, sort of from plague ships.

01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:07.994
And they sort of got the pustules from the dead bodies.

01:51:08.054 --> 01:51:11.697
Sounds like they really thought that it would work, even though it's a gross thing to do.

01:51:11.997 --> 01:51:14.058
But as I say, I don't need to.

01:51:14.159 --> 01:51:16.120
I'm not trying to be right about everything.

01:51:17.321 --> 01:51:25.083
But I'm confident enough about a small number of things that is absolutely no doubt that, you know, whatever.

01:51:26.443 --> 01:51:27.844
If we let them, the worst will come.

01:51:28.284 --> 01:51:32.805
Do you think that any vaccine has worked for anyone ever?

01:51:33.625 --> 01:51:36.166
I think it's unlikely.

01:51:36.366 --> 01:51:39.606
Why would I even want to be absolutist about such a statement?

01:51:40.066 --> 01:51:45.768
Scientists, politicians, politicians make absolute statements even though everything is vague.

01:51:47.175 --> 01:51:53.717
scientists are expected to make digital answers, whereas they recognize most things are vague.

01:51:54.117 --> 01:51:55.658
So I think it is unlikely.

01:51:55.778 --> 01:51:58.039
And so it is really a system of lying.

01:51:58.959 --> 01:52:04.280
And you can see it as grant writing or you can see it as abstract writing.

01:52:05.341 --> 01:52:11.803
But what it is, is essentially agreeing to play this game where we all know that I'm oversimplifying everything I'm trying to explain.

01:52:12.714 --> 01:52:22.308
We know that my experiment isn't really asking a meaningful question because the null hypothesis is pretty dumb and has a lot of assumptions that haven't been tested.

01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:28.818
And yet, because the goal is to participate in the system, it's to learn how to do that.

01:52:29.755 --> 01:52:46.689
then there are lots of tenured professors who are very good at cutting this imaginary sausage into ever thinner slices as they extend their career into the future without actually making any meaningful progress on the big ideas that they claim to be addressing.

01:52:48.072 --> 01:52:56.142
and instead they're focused on a few moving parts and then they give presentations about how those moving parts are the most important moving parts of all.

01:52:56.903 --> 01:53:01.068
I can give you a great example from any one of the things that I've ever done in my career.

01:53:01.108 --> 01:53:03.651
Let's just go with small conductance potassium channels.

01:53:04.212 --> 01:53:06.073
It's one of the first papers I ever published.

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:12.437
I worked for a guy, bless his heart, by the name of Khaled Huwamad, who took me off the street, taught me to patch clamp.

01:53:13.157 --> 01:53:14.598
We went through 9-11 together.

01:53:14.638 --> 01:53:23.784
He shaved his beard and didn't want to come into the university because he was afraid that the 9-11 would result in all the Muslims being rounded up and put in camps.

01:53:24.684 --> 01:53:25.645
And he was terrified.

01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:28.493
And he's not in science anymore.

01:53:28.533 --> 01:53:34.280
He's got a successful Tunisian restaurant in Michigan, I believe.

01:53:35.221 --> 01:53:40.868
But what a great mentor he was from the perspective of telling me what it was that science does.

01:53:40.968 --> 01:53:42.010
He knew it was a game.

01:53:43.171 --> 01:53:51.940
It was a game where you had to stake out your own little intellectual space that was significantly different enough from other people that you didn't encroach on anyone.

01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:59.748
And what we were doing was SK channels, small conductance potassium channels, that are slow in their activation.

01:53:59.788 --> 01:54:05.915
And so they actually can be seen as determining whether a neuron can fire, or whether a neuron goes,

01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:15.697
And so from college perspective, from the grant writing perspective, S K channels are the potassium channel.

01:54:15.717 --> 01:54:22.803
That's responsible for deciding the ability of a neuron to send a high frequency signal or a low frequency signal.

01:54:23.123 --> 01:54:32.692
And if you think about it from the perspective of symphony, that essentially essentially S K channels are the controllers of the symphony, the tempo.

01:54:34.676 --> 01:54:50.548
And so we wrote all of our grants, wrote all of our abstracts, wrote all of our discussions under the idea that SK channels, among hundreds of channels in neurons, are the most interesting target for stroke research.

01:54:50.588 --> 01:54:58.714
They're the most interesting target for particular kinds of pharmaceutical targets or whatever the argument would be.

01:55:02.679 --> 01:55:23.986
And this kind of, of, of intense focus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of incredibly smart people having been essentially unable to see that transfection was being misconstrued here as something that healthy people should definitely get on board with.

01:55:24.666 --> 01:55:31.848
And that it would be as simple as using a placebo in order to trick people into thinking that this had successfully worked.

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:36.121
It's not a very, very difficult story to understand at all.

01:55:36.141 --> 01:56:01.846
And if you think about the billions of dollars at stake, the generations of children that could be used as experimental animals until the population is reduced to a more sustainable level according to their plans, then the easiest, most foolproof way to do it would be with placebo batches and then to agree to argue about the people that are injured, to put people like Epi-Girl, Jessica Rose out there to complain about it.

01:56:02.796 --> 01:56:05.038
and then get her on as many podcasts as possible.

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:17.887
And then to have some guy who used to speak in front of the WHO about fit and finish technologies and vaccine to come out and say that he invented this stuff and he was skeptical and maybe we should be skeptical too.

01:56:20.289 --> 01:56:24.312
But I could be surprised and find that there were tetanus, for example.

01:56:24.372 --> 01:56:26.033
Does the tetanus vaccine work?

01:56:26.293 --> 01:56:26.774
I don't know.

01:56:27.314 --> 01:56:27.914
Could it work?

01:56:27.995 --> 01:56:28.835
Yeah, probably could.

01:56:29.556 --> 01:56:31.157
Because tetanus has a toxin.

01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:54.700
And this is where it becomes dangerous because the places where this kind of augmentation has a chance to work, again, are where the biological story involves a toxic protein that gets produced when a barrier is broken and a bacteria is able to replicate inside of the barrier.

01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.661
But I've not researched that one because it's not

01:56:57.981 --> 01:57:11.210
Or bacterial proteins break the barrier, because that happens a lot in the gut with a particular kind of class of bacterial protein that can cause systemic inflammation, even if the bacteria themselves aren't in.

01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:18.355
It can be a leaky gut and the bacterial proteins that aren't supposed to be in circulation that can cause this long-term inflammation.

01:57:18.395 --> 01:57:23.178
Again, nothing to do with pandemic RNAs, just to do with

01:57:23.959 --> 01:57:26.583
the consequences of the biology of our own system.

01:57:26.703 --> 01:57:30.068
Against an organism, but against a toxin, apparently.

01:57:33.694 --> 01:57:34.555
Yeah, exactly.

01:57:34.635 --> 01:57:36.475
I'm not promoting anything.

01:57:36.515 --> 01:57:44.778
Maybe if the tetanus gel was delivered by the prong, by the horn of a magical unicorn, then it might work.

01:57:45.319 --> 01:57:46.779
Anyway, I think it's unlikely.

01:57:46.799 --> 01:57:47.940
I think it's unlikely.

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:49.920
I heard you hint.

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:56.523
Again, people often, they want me to say absolute things, and I say, why do you want me to say it?

01:57:56.923 --> 01:57:58.444
Because you're Dr. Mike Eden, former

01:57:59.224 --> 01:58:00.646
Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer.

01:58:01.086 --> 01:58:06.032
So you want me to say something I'm not 100% sure of because other people will believe it.

01:58:06.072 --> 01:58:07.774
It's like, get out of here.

01:58:07.915 --> 01:58:09.116
That's not what I'm going to do.

01:58:09.537 --> 01:58:14.643
So I'm absolutely certain acute respiratory illnesses are not infectious or contagious.

01:58:15.063 --> 01:58:34.131
In fact, I think acute respiratory illnesses in this context could have been caused by the overuse of supplementary oxygen to the tune of even 60 liters a minute, as Kyle Seidel said on his YouTube channel, as Pierre Cory described in his testimony in the Senate and on his Substack.

01:58:34.191 --> 01:58:35.092
This is a problem.

01:58:35.973 --> 01:58:37.874
There's 100 years of evidence to say that.

01:58:38.595 --> 01:58:40.856
And I've not persuaded my wife completely of this.

01:58:41.236 --> 01:58:42.557
But I am sure of it.

01:58:42.977 --> 01:58:46.860
So when they tell you there's bird flu going around, it's like, no, no, no, there isn't.

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.961
They may well be ill, but they're not.

01:58:49.421 --> 01:58:53.604
Poor little sweetie pie is not going to cough up some pathogen and make you sick.

01:58:54.424 --> 01:58:55.085
It's a psyop.

01:58:55.745 --> 01:58:56.706
It's an absolute psyop.

01:58:57.006 --> 01:58:59.187
You're more likely to catch dolphin influenza.

01:58:59.807 --> 01:58:59.967
Wow.

01:59:01.869 --> 01:59:04.931
So I'm certain about that, because I've read the bloody literature.

01:59:04.951 --> 01:59:16.260
I've read the hundred years of literature that says that attempts to transmit people who've got colds, they put them in rooms with people who didn't have colds, and then follow them for several weeks.

01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:19.542
And they did the same experiment by putting two healthy people in a room.

01:59:20.203 --> 01:59:23.886
And the question was, how many of the recipients in each case would get sick?

01:59:24.226 --> 01:59:26.407
And you'd be pretty sure, wouldn't you, that if colds were

01:59:27.488 --> 01:59:33.875
transmissible that more people would get cold symptoms in the next few weeks if they sat for an hour or two with someone with a cold.

01:59:34.315 --> 01:59:34.736
They don't.

01:59:35.557 --> 01:59:36.258
It's been published.

01:59:36.378 --> 01:59:39.921
But Steve Kersh said that his positivity went around his house.

01:59:41.523 --> 01:59:47.229
Steve Kersh testifies to the strangeness of it and says that after his wife got sick, he tested positive.

01:59:49.002 --> 01:59:57.750
And so we again, we have a limited spectrum of debate being reinforced by people that we were told for three years by an organization like Twitter.

01:59:58.210 --> 02:00:04.096
Essentially, Steve Kirsch is a good guy because Malone and Brett Weinstein say so.

02:00:04.116 --> 02:00:05.317
40 times.

02:00:06.097 --> 02:00:09.000
So, sorry, that's your mental model.

02:00:09.961 --> 02:00:10.341
It's wrong.

02:00:11.402 --> 02:00:12.843
So you can't catch a cold?

02:00:13.164 --> 02:00:13.264
No.

02:00:14.437 --> 02:00:33.340
And I think that's a very dangerous thing to say because I believe that within the biology that they have misconstrued as HIV and retroviruses is a scenario where your immune system uses retroviruses to communicate between cell types, not just cytokines and interleukins.

02:00:34.261 --> 02:00:37.023
but also more likely genetic signals.

02:00:37.763 --> 02:01:04.061
And so if you took a sample from a related primate and put it into a human, there is a non-zero chance that retroviral signals from their own immune system would be present and that those retroviral signals would be overlapping enough so that a catastrophic dysregulation of your own immune system could occur as a result of the intramuscular injection of retroviruses sourced from a related to, but not the same primate.

02:01:06.022 --> 02:01:17.446
Once they discovered that there was this layer of the immune system that they inadvertently discovered by making a hepatitis vaccine and giving it to gay people, they called it HIV.

02:01:17.986 --> 02:01:20.547
They said that retroviruses were outside of you.

02:01:21.502 --> 02:01:28.429
And they built this biological scheme called the Baltimore scheme that describes all of these things that are outside of you.

02:01:28.849 --> 02:01:40.841
Even though years later, it comes to find out that there are correlates of all these special viral enzymes in our own cells, actively doing things that we don't really want to pay any attention to by giving grant money to them.

02:01:41.222 --> 02:01:44.285
And instead, we're going to invest in all that stuff that's outside of you.

02:01:47.273 --> 02:01:54.399
This is really the fundamental inversion of our irreducible complexity upon which public health is based.

02:01:54.519 --> 02:01:55.941
And this is how we will break them.

02:01:55.981 --> 02:02:04.088
We will teach our children that every detail that we know of the body is now an extra gear.

02:02:05.088 --> 02:02:10.053
We still don't understand how works in concert with the other gears to produce us.

02:02:12.266 --> 02:02:20.574
And when people think, when people think, oh no, well you say that, Dr. Ian, but I know that I had a cold and I definitely caught it from the guy in the office.

02:02:21.395 --> 02:02:23.076
I have thought about this.

02:02:23.136 --> 02:02:32.305
See, the other thing that's possible then, right, is that highly immunologically incompatible people, when your immune system is signaling,

02:02:33.388 --> 02:02:52.988
My immune system would make perfect sense to me if my immune system, when exposed to something, would have a signal that it could send to the people that I'm closest to, the people that I spend the most time with, my family, so that their immune system would be activated in a way to avoid illness, to avoid exposure, to avoid fever, whatever.

02:02:54.693 --> 02:03:09.445
And in the scenario where that signal is being sent out, but your immune system isn't as related to mine as it is, or as aligned with that signal, then you could develop symptoms as a result of being exposed to my actively signaling immune system.

02:03:10.831 --> 02:03:17.112
And of course, we are told, no one has ever asked the question of, is there a signaling in that regime?

02:03:17.812 --> 02:03:28.395
Even though we know that menstrual cycles of entire frat houses, or not frat houses, but sorority houses can be in sync between roommates or even hallways.

02:03:29.475 --> 02:03:35.516
We know that when you kiss someone, a lot of times it's just like, yee, and other times it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe it.

02:03:35.576 --> 02:03:39.497
She's a smoker, but somehow or another, kissing her still,

02:03:40.714 --> 02:03:41.374
tastes good.

02:03:42.495 --> 02:03:43.315
That can happen.

02:03:43.896 --> 02:03:56.322
And it's because of biology that nobody wants to discuss that's there, where our immune systems are communicating to one another, where our biology is being evaluated subconsciously by the chemical interactions of our bodies.

02:03:57.682 --> 02:04:00.143
It's not just DNA to RNA to protein.

02:04:01.524 --> 02:04:03.625
It's a lot more complicated than that.

02:04:03.665 --> 02:04:05.386
But of course, if they told you that,

02:04:06.553 --> 02:04:09.736
then you would never buy the illusion of understanding.

02:04:09.756 --> 02:04:19.905
You would never buy into the idea that they have almost all the problems solved or the idea that Kurtzweiler puts forward that in 40 years or 20 years, there will be no disease.

02:04:19.945 --> 02:04:24.449
And if you can just make it that far, you're essentially going to make it to immortality.

02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:25.871
Stop lying.

02:04:27.683 --> 02:04:34.786
It's not incumbent on me to come up with an explanation, right, for how they do work, given I've shown you that you're being lied to.

02:04:35.087 --> 02:04:38.088
But I just think it's easier if I give you some suggestions.

02:04:38.968 --> 02:04:51.134
Common colds are sufficiently common that if you have one, it's not that unlikely that someone known to you, family member or friend, will also get a cold in the next short period of time.

02:04:51.294 --> 02:04:52.675
And that doesn't mean spread.

02:04:53.375 --> 02:04:54.976
And that's a very valid point.

02:04:55.965 --> 02:05:01.327
And when that happens, the person who got it second thinks they got it from you.

02:05:01.607 --> 02:05:04.849
It's consistent with contagion, but it isn't.

02:05:06.089 --> 02:05:14.313
The other one is, whatever it is that causes these acute symptoms, I think there will be an environmental contribution.

02:05:14.653 --> 02:05:18.415
Maybe it's too hot, too cold, too dry, too much pollen, or whatever it is.

02:05:19.495 --> 02:05:32.733
Or any number of toxins that are in the soaps that you use, the products that you use, the food that you eat, the air that you breathe, the car that you drove behind, or the stuff that you put on your face.

02:05:33.054 --> 02:05:36.478
You and that person you think you got it from shared some of that environment.

02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:38.019
or some of the food.

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.062
So I think it's coincidence and shared environments.

02:05:42.122 --> 02:05:45.183
That's what explains contagion.

02:05:45.584 --> 02:05:46.484
And then here's the other one.

02:05:46.504 --> 02:05:51.647
Oh, well, you say that it was all put on, but I had the worst flu I'd ever had in my life in 2020.

02:05:51.687 --> 02:05:53.688
So how do you explain that?

02:05:54.329 --> 02:05:55.349
And for a while, I couldn't.

02:05:55.409 --> 02:05:57.070
But I go, I can explain that.

02:05:57.670 --> 02:05:58.331
I can explain it.

02:05:59.811 --> 02:06:03.712
Most of us have something called influenza, it's like a description.

02:06:04.373 --> 02:06:10.474
Quite rarely in our life, I've had it twice, I'm 64, and I've asked around and most people it's like one to three.

02:06:11.695 --> 02:06:14.715
I just don't understand how that's even a statement you can make.

02:06:15.816 --> 02:06:16.616
I'm an American.

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:20.017
As an American, I went to work when I was sick.

02:06:20.837 --> 02:06:22.980
I ignored my symptoms when I was sick.

02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:24.902
I rode my bike to work when I was sick.

02:06:24.942 --> 02:06:26.744
And by the time I got to work, I felt okay.

02:06:27.164 --> 02:06:28.426
And I worked feeling sick.

02:06:28.466 --> 02:06:38.417
And then I went home because when I'm, when I want to take a day off and I only have two weeks vacation as a postdoc, then I use those sick days for vacation as well.

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:40.660
Get 25 of those.

02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:47.321
So for me, it's odd because I can't remember.

02:06:47.461 --> 02:06:48.962
I can remember being sick in 2019.

02:06:49.582 --> 02:06:52.363
I remember it because my wife made fun of me.

02:06:53.423 --> 02:06:54.944
Like, you're sick like that again?

02:06:54.964 --> 02:07:06.828
Like, it's just because you're smoking and because you're riding your bike in the cold winter, and it happened last winter, it's happening this winter, it happens every winter, because you're riding your bike in the cold.

02:07:07.873 --> 02:07:09.635
And we both agreed it must be the case.

02:07:09.675 --> 02:07:10.075
That's it.

02:07:10.135 --> 02:07:10.656
That's done.

02:07:11.456 --> 02:07:13.798
But I've been sick like that before.

02:07:13.818 --> 02:07:16.661
At least, I just didn't think it was quite as bad.

02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:20.704
But I couldn't name the times that I had been sick like that before.

02:07:20.724 --> 02:07:25.569
I'm sure I had the flu when I was playing basketball in my junior year because I remember

02:07:26.329 --> 02:07:32.732
Really thinking about whether or not I could play one of those games and we were having such a good basketball year that it just like what?

02:07:33.213 --> 02:07:34.974
I'm not gonna play that would be ridiculous.

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:39.016
I might miss the best game of our of our high school season.

02:07:39.996 --> 02:07:49.241
I Got at least be on the bench and available So Americans and I suspect a lot of other Western countries in general aren't making a detailed

02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:53.091
you know, diary about, oh boy, I really felt bad today.

02:07:53.691 --> 02:07:56.733
My fever was this and my pulse ox went from this and that.

02:07:57.134 --> 02:08:01.416
And I decided to take some aconitia and blah, blah, blah, and keep some diary.

02:08:01.456 --> 02:08:07.720
And then years later, just be able to flip back to the two pages where the red mark is because I had flu.

02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:11.322
It seems bizarre to make that comment.

02:08:11.883 --> 02:08:14.985
You don't remember how many times you were sick in that way?

02:08:15.365 --> 02:08:15.825
No way.

02:08:17.086 --> 02:08:23.111
Just imagine now, let's say you've had three and you're 60 and you get flu in 2020.

02:08:23.752 --> 02:08:26.594
What's the chances it will be the worst flu you've ever had?

02:08:26.754 --> 02:08:31.097
It could be milder to what you've had before, about the same, worse.

02:08:31.878 --> 02:08:33.800
And I think it's just throwing the dice.

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:43.044
And I think a significant minority of people who had flu in 2020 legitimately could say, because it was true, this was the worst flu I'd ever had.

02:08:44.285 --> 02:08:45.125
So you see?

02:08:45.345 --> 02:08:48.187
I think there are lots of people in 2018 that would say it.

02:08:48.207 --> 02:08:50.588
I think there were people in 2009 that would say it.

02:08:51.028 --> 02:08:54.170
I just don't think this expands beyond anecdotal.

02:08:54.190 --> 02:08:56.251
50,000 to 70,000 people die every week in America.

02:09:01.139 --> 02:09:04.603
100,000 people every year for the last four years have been killed by opioids.

02:09:05.884 --> 02:09:16.174
And so a few anecdotal cases of the worst flu ever doesn't mean that every year, if you wanted to, you couldn't interview people and find people that said, yeah, that's the worst flu I've ever had.

02:09:17.075 --> 02:09:20.178
It just would be less some years than other years.

02:09:20.538 --> 02:09:21.219
That's the expert.

02:09:21.319 --> 02:09:24.302
And that means no matter how many times you hear that anecdote,

02:09:25.365 --> 02:09:31.008
And however true it is, it provides you with no evidence whatsoever there was something new in the environment.

02:09:31.908 --> 02:09:32.829
It's funny that, you know.

02:09:33.049 --> 02:09:41.193
Especially not with the flu jabs being pushed, especially not with the horrible lack of regulation of our food supply.

02:09:41.213 --> 02:09:48.176
Anyway, so I have now satisfied myself about viruses and colds and flu and contagion.

02:09:49.137 --> 02:09:51.018
When people say, what's about black death?

02:09:51.098 --> 02:09:51.838
It's like, I don't know.

02:09:52.018 --> 02:09:53.759
I don't give a monkeys about black death.

02:09:54.479 --> 02:09:55.760
I'm not going to think about that.

02:09:56.581 --> 02:09:57.361
What's measles then?

02:09:57.441 --> 02:09:57.782
I don't know.

02:09:58.342 --> 02:09:58.662
Next.

02:09:59.643 --> 02:10:02.144
It's not my job to provide education for the world.

02:10:02.185 --> 02:10:03.666
I've told you, you're being lied to.

02:10:04.166 --> 02:10:04.686
Exactly.

02:10:04.746 --> 02:10:15.233
It's not our goal, and the onus is not on us if we say that these people are actively lying to us to have a

02:10:18.519 --> 02:10:21.720
a sealed, what is the right word?

02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.101
A open and shut case on what actually happened.

02:10:26.462 --> 02:10:33.644
We're not supposed to, this is exactly the analogy I've used many times where you call the police and say, hey, somebody was breaking into my home.

02:10:34.144 --> 02:10:37.945
The 911 operator doesn't ask you, well, what is their motivation?

02:10:38.005 --> 02:10:39.306
Why did they break into your house?

02:10:39.326 --> 02:10:40.266
What are they looking for?

02:10:41.947 --> 02:10:43.547
What do they intend to do after?

02:10:44.328 --> 02:10:45.548
Where are they going to go next?

02:10:47.674 --> 02:10:59.606
And in this scenario where a couple generations of the biosecurity state has essentially been working to build a narrative about vaccines and public health.

02:11:00.498 --> 02:11:15.567
so that our sovereignty could be inverted and that our children could be turned into experimental animals and that they would use murder and lies and placebos and people like Robert Malone and Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:11:16.207 --> 02:11:22.111
and all the people they could, Pierre Kory, Jessica Hockett, the

02:11:22.831 --> 02:11:25.973
any group that they could co-opt like Heart or Panda.

02:11:26.653 --> 02:11:38.479
All of these things, if they rose on social media to see many people's eyes or to get into many people's ears, it was by design because that's how we are controlled.

02:11:38.959 --> 02:11:46.423
Social media is not a random, spontaneous group of good ideas rising to the top.

02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:48.410
It is not.

02:11:48.550 --> 02:12:05.024
It is a very carefully controlled environment where you are sitting in a chair with your feet on the pedals and your goggles on and your hand on a joystick and you think you're flying a TIE fighter against the Empire by joining up forces with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:12:05.084 --> 02:12:08.187
and Robert Malone to fight against Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak.

02:12:09.611 --> 02:12:10.952
You must disconnect.

02:12:23.701 --> 02:12:26.223
Let's hear that again.

02:12:27.204 --> 02:12:29.725
It's not my job to provide education for the world.

02:12:29.765 --> 02:12:39.572
I've told you you're being lied to about COVID and you're being lied to about bird flu and they're trying to persuade you to give up your freedom and let them stab toxins in you.

02:12:39.932 --> 02:12:40.713
Isn't that enough?

02:12:41.673 --> 02:12:42.674
Well said.

02:12:43.715 --> 02:12:46.397
Well said, Mr. Sparkle.

02:12:48.925 --> 02:12:55.733
So you've actually gone halfway to answering my next question, which is basically, have you now moved into the no virus camp?

02:12:56.374 --> 02:12:57.355
Yeah, I think it's...

02:12:59.542 --> 02:13:08.387
And that's unfortunate because that's not the biological, the biological evidence is there, that there is a signal at this size scale.

02:13:08.948 --> 02:13:25.618
So there is no way to get around the fact that there is a signal at this size scale, that the signal is very ubiquitous across healthy tissues and cancerous tissues, across fungal rhizomes and the roots of deciduous trees.

02:13:26.966 --> 02:13:29.509
and the bacteria that form nodules on their roots.

02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:33.353
This is all, these are all signaling regimes that are in the background.

02:13:33.393 --> 02:13:39.779
And that's not even talking about the earliest identified version of this kind of signaling regime.

02:13:39.819 --> 02:13:41.401
And that is the bacteriophage.

02:13:42.975 --> 02:13:59.042
found by none other than people like Joshua Lederberg who are at the heart and soul of the mentality of the the idea set that we are being coerced into passing on to our children just in the same way that our parents were coerced into passing it on to us.

02:13:59.862 --> 02:14:00.763
Just tell us why.

02:14:02.083 --> 02:14:05.085
I was helped by somebody who had recently made the transition.

02:14:06.225 --> 02:14:10.287
And he said, you don't have to go into a position of saying, I don't believe in viruses.

02:14:10.307 --> 02:14:17.091
You can say, because it's true, that there is no convincing evidence for the presence of them.

02:14:18.392 --> 02:14:22.275
I've not seen any convincing evidence for the presence of them.

02:14:22.875 --> 02:14:26.358
Now again, don't force me to do the religious bit.

02:14:26.838 --> 02:14:31.302
I really am afraid of that because again, you can choose the old papers and you can

02:14:33.303 --> 02:14:36.666
use the methodologies to show that the methodologies are wrong.

02:14:37.327 --> 02:14:47.376
You can culture cells and make them produce viral-like particles, or break down if you get rid of them, or plate them too thickly, or allow them to grow past the capacity of the plate.

02:14:47.917 --> 02:14:55.124
And that can be misconstrued as, see, there are no viruses, there are no exosomes, there's no communication at this size scale.

02:14:55.524 --> 02:15:05.508
There are no signals like arc in the brain that pass from neuron to neuron so that genes that are expressed in one neuron can be expressed in neighboring neurons without that neuron needing to be activated.

02:15:07.269 --> 02:15:14.671
And those are all real biological phenomenon that have been misconstrued as virology in the Baltimore scheme.

02:15:17.012 --> 02:15:23.715
And I'm afraid that the no virus trap is exactly that, that if you get there, then you're not going to ever usefully pivot

02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:28.314
to questioning the human genome project and the illusion created using it.

02:15:28.394 --> 02:15:43.885
You're never going to pivot to the illusion that was created by virology, which actually covers up the effectiveness, the effective experimentation using synthetic DNA and RNA to transform and transfect cell cultures and animals and calling that virology.

02:15:44.656 --> 02:15:49.559
And so if you say there are no viruses, you're not saying the same thing as there's no virology.

02:15:49.679 --> 02:16:08.972
And I'm saying there is definitely virology and the vast majority, if not all of it is based on the misconstruing of testing DNA and RNA transfection and transformation on cell culture and animals with bona fide discussion and, and experimentation on viruses, which it is definitely not.

02:16:10.697 --> 02:16:35.457
And if you don't usefully question this and you just settle on, I guess it's nothing, then you will never question the foundation of the biosecurity state, the foundation of the human genome project, the foundation of all biologic production in pharmaceutical companies, which is synthetic DNA, recombinant DNA, bacterial cultures reproducing it.

02:16:35.617 --> 02:16:37.999
And then the commercial conversion of that to RNA,

02:16:39.059 --> 02:16:40.920
And that technology is well-developed.

02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:45.142
And so they could seed any PCR positive they want.

02:16:45.162 --> 02:16:48.343
They could seed any sequence they want and claim they found it.

02:16:49.764 --> 02:16:53.966
And you don't need to have a pandemic virus.

02:16:54.006 --> 02:16:55.667
You don't need to have a pandemic RNA.

02:16:55.687 --> 02:16:57.328
You don't need to have a gain-of-function RNA.

02:16:57.368 --> 02:17:02.970
All you need to do is have the capacity to make enough DNA in a pure enough quantity to detect it.

02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:06.612
Enough DNA to make a pure enough quantity of RNA to inject it.

02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:15.714
to apply it to a cell culture, to apply it to an animal, and then detect the proteins that are produced and call that a model of infectious disease.

02:17:16.654 --> 02:17:28.678
Or be too naive to know that that's all you're doing in your experiments as you produce your PhD, as you write grants and you learn to perform this ritual over and over and over again.

02:17:29.938 --> 02:17:31.399
And people tell you you're great for it.

02:17:32.301 --> 02:17:34.925
do swear that viruses don't exist.

02:17:34.945 --> 02:17:36.527
It's like, I'll just tell you what I just told you.

02:17:36.547 --> 02:17:37.869
I've seen no evidence for them.

02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:42.576
And they belong in the same category as goblins under your table, leprechauns, and unicorns.

02:17:43.729 --> 02:17:45.530
Although some people think unicorns existed.

02:17:45.570 --> 02:17:46.771
Well, be careful about that.

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:47.912
Yeah, I have to be a bit careful.

02:17:48.072 --> 02:17:48.813
A lot of these things.

02:17:49.253 --> 02:17:55.919
In fact, I'm now going to block my copybook by saying, of all the conspiracy theories you hear, I rule out none of them.

02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:57.540
Right?

02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:03.685
Because the trouble is, whenever I've gone in close to look at them, the bloody things have come true.

02:18:04.846 --> 02:18:06.087
I'm glad you said that, Mike.

02:18:06.107 --> 02:18:08.529
I'm going to ask you about... I'm really upset about the dinosaurs.

02:18:10.097 --> 02:18:12.279
There's a few coming up.

02:18:12.299 --> 02:18:13.279
Don't you worry about that.

02:18:13.659 --> 02:18:17.562
So yeah, because lots of people get really worked up about the no virus.

02:18:17.702 --> 02:18:21.745
They're either team terrain or they're team virus.

02:18:21.805 --> 02:18:22.806
I don't join anything.

02:18:23.406 --> 02:18:23.946
Hamster wheel.

02:18:23.966 --> 02:18:26.768
It's staggering to me in retrospect that I had a career in corporate.

02:18:27.089 --> 02:18:28.349
How the hell did I manage that?

02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:29.090
Hamster wheel.

02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:31.812
I think it's because I'm inherently quite a nice person.

02:18:32.132 --> 02:18:32.652
I don't like to

02:18:34.653 --> 02:18:47.698
or if I knew I was going to have to do something like ending a project that I knew would upset people, I would work really, really hard to try and smooth over it, smooth over the water, try and find some other focus for their attention and so on.

02:18:47.718 --> 02:18:49.999
So that's how I managed to do it, I think.

02:18:50.159 --> 02:18:53.460
Because if I'd been more disagreeable, my own internal processes of

02:18:54.020 --> 02:19:00.024
I don't tend to join things, I would not have managed to become, I'm not that good a team player, so I put it on.

02:19:01.325 --> 02:19:05.148
And the reason I don't join things is, it's so constraining.

02:19:05.768 --> 02:19:11.452
So if you join Team No Virus fully, there's like six edicts or whatever, things you have to.

02:19:11.652 --> 02:19:18.917
There you go, now he's saying it, and remember, they were that way from the very beginning, so it's clear that that was part of the show.

02:19:21.158 --> 02:19:30.222
And so he can say he's kind of on their team, like I can say I'm kind of on their team, but their team was a trap and that was part of it, especially Andy Kaufman.

02:19:30.682 --> 02:19:34.143
And he admitted it by going on Steve Kirsch's podcast this year.

02:19:34.603 --> 02:19:34.923
Yes.

02:19:35.083 --> 02:19:40.225
And I don't like that because what happens if I wake the next day and think, I've thought of something else that doesn't fit.

02:19:40.826 --> 02:19:41.106
It's like.

02:19:41.886 --> 02:19:42.846
then this is what happens.

02:19:43.107 --> 02:19:47.909
I think people end up, they've jumped from one lily pad to another to another.

02:19:48.289 --> 02:19:49.650
And what you should do is think.

02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:53.551
Don't join anything, just be nice, but think.

02:19:53.751 --> 02:19:54.392
That's all you should do.

02:19:54.652 --> 02:19:56.633
Actually, it's something I need to mention.

02:19:56.653 --> 02:20:00.915
I've only learned in the last three weeks, and so you probably won't have heard it.

02:20:02.095 --> 02:20:03.356
But it all fits when I say it.

02:20:04.403 --> 02:20:11.806
You know that there was a team hero, the alternative media people, not me, people who are 100 times more famous around the world.

02:20:12.847 --> 02:20:16.048
I won't mention them at this particular point, but you all know who I'm thinking.

02:20:16.108 --> 02:20:21.250
So many doctors who are- Robert Malone, Pierre Kory, Meryl Ness.

02:20:23.411 --> 02:20:27.193
All these American doctors that had to go to Australia and testify.

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:28.620
Americans.

02:20:29.882 --> 02:20:38.769
And as soon as they were a hundred times more famous around the world, I won't mention them at this particular point, but you all know who I'm thinking, so many doctors who are Americans.

02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:41.391
Yes, he says.

02:20:42.552 --> 02:20:44.294
Yes, Dowingpole says.

02:20:44.314 --> 02:20:44.374
Yes.

02:20:47.406 --> 02:20:50.992
And now we have two UK people telling us that it was America.

02:20:51.613 --> 02:20:52.394
America did it.

02:20:52.494 --> 02:20:55.799
It wasn't anybody in the UK collaborating with people in America.

02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:58.163
It wasn't traders in America.

02:20:58.183 --> 02:20:58.884
It was America.

02:20:59.847 --> 02:21:16.355
And so rather than being a ally of America and saying, wow, America is really being undermined from the inside by people who are collaborating with people who are undermining the UK from the inside and people who are undermining Canada from the inside, they don't say anything like that.

02:21:17.016 --> 02:21:19.557
They say that there's lots of people, doctors in America.

02:21:20.638 --> 02:21:27.721
And as soon as the pandemic arrived, they came up with early treatment for COVID-19, didn't they?

02:21:28.102 --> 02:21:29.562
And they pushed and pushed and pushed.

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:34.204
First, I thought... He's right about that.

02:21:34.384 --> 02:21:41.048
Most of those early treatment people were Americans, but there was a French guy who pushed hydroxychloroquine and a few others.

02:21:42.708 --> 02:21:43.729
But he's right about that.

02:21:45.490 --> 02:21:51.313
And we've actually said that Pierre Cory, it's an admission that he was so hardcore on ivermectin.

02:21:51.753 --> 02:22:02.919
It is an admission that Brett Weinstein was like parading around the idea that he had the secret formula that when combined with bandanas and woodshop goggles he was just as good as vaccinated for shit's sake.

02:22:04.724 --> 02:22:06.205
then later when I realized there wasn't.

02:22:06.225 --> 02:22:09.006
So I thought, why are they pushing this stuff?

02:22:09.046 --> 02:22:14.709
I thought, they're pushing harmless placebos on the worried well, and they're providing a boon.

02:22:14.729 --> 02:22:16.990
Worried well is a phrase that

02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:22.101
James Giordano used back in 2017.

02:22:22.961 --> 02:22:26.442
I'm worried about people that use the words worried well.

02:22:26.462 --> 02:22:28.563
The structure that really is a pandemic.

02:22:28.603 --> 02:22:33.744
I thought, why would these clever people be going out of their way to sell you this stuff?

02:22:33.844 --> 02:22:42.247
What about these clever people that went out of their way to say that the PCR test that the WHO was rolling out wasn't right because it was rushed or because it makes primer dimers?

02:22:43.382 --> 02:22:52.885
And those people included Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig, who I both am sure are bad guys, but also included Thomas Binder and this guy, Michael Yeadon.

02:22:52.905 --> 02:23:03.508
They were both on that paper that didn't say that PCR testing was bad, but said that the way the WHO was advocating to do it was methodologically unsound, which is very, very different.

02:23:06.148 --> 02:23:08.309
Unfortunately, it's much worse than that.

02:23:09.395 --> 02:23:20.238
One of the center stage drugs that they want you to take, ivermectin, is one of the most violent fertility toxins I've ever come across.

02:23:20.658 --> 02:23:21.638
Bingo!

02:23:23.459 --> 02:23:30.321
And of course, that has already been said by people like Tim Truth and many other people have posited this.

02:23:30.401 --> 02:23:35.682
It was one of the reasons why people think it makes sense that they would distribute it in Africa.

02:23:39.833 --> 02:23:49.080
Very, very, very, very interesting assertion because of course it also cures cancer and Parkinson's disease and all these other things that these doctors say it does.

02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:56.686
But none of those doctors are ever willing to come out and say that anything that cures cancer might not be appropriate to use in a healthy person.

02:24:00.046 --> 02:24:10.613
Bret Weinstein was arguing for the continuous prophylactic use of ivermectin, not a once in a season exposure for parasites, prophylactic use.

02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:19.326
And I didn't know this, because like you, you probably didn't think to do the deep research, and I didn't.

02:24:19.946 --> 02:24:38.084
So someone contacted me a few weeks ago with a bloody great dossier of papers that go back from its discovery, and there's unquestionably around the doses you're being required, you're being suggested to take in rats and rabbits, and in some limited studies in humans,

02:24:38.804 --> 02:24:45.426
It reduces the ability to conceive and to grow babies to term.

02:24:46.147 --> 02:24:47.167
And doesn't it fit?

02:24:48.127 --> 02:24:48.827
Doesn't it fit?

02:24:49.468 --> 02:24:50.028
Why did this?

02:24:50.408 --> 02:24:53.029
There's nothing that's major.

02:24:53.889 --> 02:24:56.872
on the world stage that's accidental, I'm afraid.

02:24:57.112 --> 02:24:57.433
Yes.

02:24:57.613 --> 02:24:58.434
That's the problem.

02:24:58.754 --> 02:25:01.316
Nothing that's major on the world stage is accidental.

02:25:01.356 --> 02:25:02.918
So what is the PCR test then?

02:25:03.358 --> 02:25:11.767
In my humble opinion, as exposed by what happened on on college campuses around the United States, there was a pre-planned

02:25:12.447 --> 02:25:19.572
Already they knew what they were going to do because a PCR testing regime gets you one thing and one thing more than anything else.

02:25:20.192 --> 02:25:27.477
It gets you an unlimited supply of genetic samples that are classified as medical remnants.

02:25:29.358 --> 02:25:31.280
You know the shit they throw away at hospitals?

02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:39.345
If it's to an individual patient and they anonymize it, they can sell that to any biotech company that wants to buy it for a sample.

02:25:42.708 --> 02:25:54.414
That's why they encourage children, parents in America to circumcise their kids so that people like Vincent Racaniello have fibroblasts to work on in their cell cultures.

02:25:55.454 --> 02:25:56.915
It's medical remnants.

02:25:58.956 --> 02:26:06.740
You don't get any medical remnants of foreskin from young babies if you don't actively encourage parents to circumcise their children.

02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:09.201
But once they do it, it becomes a medical remnant.

02:26:10.114 --> 02:26:12.774
that the hospital can sell for profit.

02:26:13.935 --> 02:26:32.918
And PCR testing every single college kid every week was a repeated excuse to create a medical remnant that contained information about their genome, about their microbiome, about their immune system, and anything else that could be extracted from such a sample.

02:26:34.958 --> 02:26:38.699
And they knew this because medical remnants were already a source of a lot of data.

02:26:40.052 --> 02:26:44.293
I used to make recordings from the medical remnants of people who were getting a glioma removed.

02:26:47.274 --> 02:26:51.155
And technically speaking, they didn't even need to give permission because it was a medical remnant.

02:26:52.035 --> 02:26:54.315
It was de-identified and I got human brain.

02:26:56.036 --> 02:27:04.318
And if you think for one second that the opportunity to collect data en masse was missed, you're sorely mistaken.

02:27:05.103 --> 02:27:32.950
And in fact, I have come to believe from my work on a couple cases about PCR testing, that actually it is very, very likely given the fact that so many of these PCR tests were only looking at a single amplicon, that in reality, the whole point of doing a PCR test was to create the medical remnant that could be used for full genome screening, to make a lot of restriction enzyme maps of a lot of people over and over and over again,

02:27:33.976 --> 02:27:44.561
and then to take that data and see if AI or some kind of machine learning algorithm could use the data they collected and interface with any number of medical databases that are available, including Epic.

02:27:47.943 --> 02:27:53.305
Someone like Joshua Lederberg already knew back in the day that we were gonna use computers to sort through this data.

02:27:53.365 --> 02:27:58.748
He was famous for having advocated for the application of machine learning to biological data.

02:27:59.912 --> 02:28:06.777
And so we are talking about a multi-generational set of ideas that is being executed exactly as Mike Eden has said.

02:28:07.337 --> 02:28:20.006
That the vaccine schedule was seen as a way that over generations we could invert our sovereignty and convert these children to experimental animals without them even knowing it, without us having to pay a dime, with them coming to us.

02:28:21.527 --> 02:28:28.912
And at the same time, we'll have opened the door to whenever we want to meaningfully reduce the reproductive population of the world, we could do it.

02:28:30.089 --> 02:28:39.816
And ivermectin is just one way, one example of how this could be done if people agree to lie to you about these fundamental biological phenomena.

02:28:40.357 --> 02:28:44.540
And so now you know there's nothing major on the world stage that's accidental.

02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:47.722
Who put ivermectin there?

02:28:47.742 --> 02:28:49.164
Well, the perpetrators did.

02:28:50.353 --> 02:28:51.514
And why did they put it there?

02:28:51.574 --> 02:28:56.776
Robert Malone was seminal in identifying it using the domain program of DITRA.

02:28:57.376 --> 02:29:02.358
He identified ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and remdesivir.

02:29:03.278 --> 02:29:04.559
Why not name names?

02:29:04.619 --> 02:29:06.139
We know what Americans did it.

02:29:06.919 --> 02:29:12.922
It's like, if you don't get jabbed and avoid impacts on your fertility, a good chunk of you will take ivermectin instead.

02:29:13.942 --> 02:29:19.868
It gets worse, and then I'll stop talking about this because I haven't written about it yet, but it's on my mind.

02:29:20.268 --> 02:29:24.092
There are lots of other supplements that the worried will take.

02:29:25.073 --> 02:29:29.157
And again, I had thought it was mainly a money-making business.

02:29:29.892 --> 02:29:33.574
All right, a money-making business, they'll sell you K2 or whatever it is.

02:29:33.834 --> 02:29:35.675
And there's loads of things I've never heard of.

02:29:35.695 --> 02:29:37.596
You look in the so-called health foods.

02:29:37.896 --> 02:29:43.138
Niacin, acetylcysteine.

02:29:45.079 --> 02:29:46.380
I mean, the list is endless, right?

02:29:47.139 --> 02:29:49.721
My wife will often ask me, what will this do?

02:29:49.741 --> 02:29:51.062
I've said, I've never heard of it.

02:29:51.602 --> 02:29:53.643
I was originally a biochemist and toxicologist.

02:29:53.663 --> 02:29:54.404
I've never heard of it.

02:29:54.424 --> 02:29:55.685
I have to look it up.

02:29:55.725 --> 02:29:56.145
It's real.

02:29:56.185 --> 02:29:56.765
It does exist.

02:29:57.546 --> 02:30:04.110
So I thought they were just flogging benign placebos to the worried whale just to steal money off them.

02:30:05.231 --> 02:30:06.712
Unfortunately, it's not so.

02:30:07.192 --> 02:30:16.939
Many of the supplements, including most of the really famous ones, hamper the elimination from your body of ivermectin.

02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:22.340
So if you're a person that thinks, well, I'm going to take care of my health and not have to take care of my health.

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:25.041
Wow, what a weird, that's an interesting statement to make.

02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:29.823
So a lot of the other supplements make it harder for you to deal with ivermectin?

02:30:29.943 --> 02:30:30.903
Whoa.

02:30:31.003 --> 02:30:32.323
It's ivermectin that'll protect me.

02:30:32.343 --> 02:30:37.525
And I've got all these other supplements, and those supplements stop your body eliminating ivermectin.

02:30:37.605 --> 02:30:39.665
It's a negative drug-drug interaction.

02:30:40.025 --> 02:30:40.505
Yikes.

02:30:40.966 --> 02:30:42.846
OK, that's something I've never heard before.

02:30:42.886 --> 02:30:43.346
That's new.

02:30:43.406 --> 02:30:45.247
This can't be coincidence, folks.

02:30:46.187 --> 02:30:47.568
And it's not a coincidence.

02:30:48.148 --> 02:30:49.828
So don't take anything.

02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:56.550
Honestly, just don't take pharmaceutical products, said the guy that works in the pharmaceutical industry.

02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:56.670
Wow.

02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:58.291
Don't take pharmaceutical products.

02:30:58.371 --> 02:31:00.692
Again, now we're saying something meaningful.

02:31:01.932 --> 02:31:03.573
That's fantastic, Mike.

02:31:03.853 --> 02:31:04.353
I mean, again.

02:31:09.898 --> 02:31:14.381
Obviously, find a trusted doctor, because you can't trust most doctors.

02:31:14.701 --> 02:31:17.243
I'm not saying throw your prescriptions away, but seriously.

02:31:17.443 --> 02:31:19.704
You can't trust doctors because they are fooled.

02:31:19.784 --> 02:31:21.065
Make sure you understand that.

02:31:21.105 --> 02:31:27.710
We want to make sure that we go with compassion, that we approach people with the idea that they can also wake up just like we did.

02:31:28.890 --> 02:31:38.497
It's often very easy, especially for a guy like me who's super fired up, to forget that two and a half years ago, I didn't know any of this stuff.

02:31:39.077 --> 02:31:46.222
Two and a half years ago, I was still arguing with people on the internet about whether this was a gain-of-function virus or not, or whether the spike protein was important.

02:31:47.984 --> 02:31:50.086
And so we've got to remain humble.

02:31:50.166 --> 02:31:51.267
We've got to remain humble.

02:31:51.307 --> 02:31:53.408
There were people who were years ahead of us on this.

02:31:53.768 --> 02:31:57.251
If any of you are on chronic medications, find an enlightened doctrine.

02:31:57.771 --> 02:32:00.373
Evaluate whether that on balance is the right thing for you.

02:32:00.654 --> 02:32:02.015
Because my hunch is it's not.

02:32:03.866 --> 02:32:06.588
I'm going to chuck out my stash of ivermectin.

02:32:06.728 --> 02:32:09.030
I think loads of people have got ivermectin.

02:32:09.050 --> 02:32:12.892
We threw it out just in recent days, and we threw out all of the supplements.

02:32:13.473 --> 02:32:16.355
In our particular case, we're not trying to have children.

02:32:16.715 --> 02:32:24.660
But there were several of these health supplements that the papers specifically showed were what's called PGP.

02:32:25.461 --> 02:32:27.183
PGP, P-glycoprotein.

02:32:27.504 --> 02:32:33.051
P-glycoprotein inhibitors and ivermectin is secreted using P-glycoprotein pathways.

02:32:33.491 --> 02:32:34.453
And it was like, oh my God.

02:32:34.493 --> 02:32:41.081
And we have ivermectin in the bathroom cabinet and all the PGP inhibitor supplements in the kitchen cupboard.

02:32:41.702 --> 02:32:42.863
And we threw them all in the bin.

02:32:43.624 --> 02:32:43.904
Wow.

02:32:44.124 --> 02:32:44.384
I know.

02:32:44.404 --> 02:32:48.986
Do you think there are any pharmaceutical products that are okay?

02:32:49.006 --> 02:32:52.888
I mean, for example, where are you on aspirin and paracetamol?

02:32:53.588 --> 02:32:54.568
I wouldn't take those either.

02:32:54.909 --> 02:32:56.049
But then I knew they were dangerous.

02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:57.790
We were all told, were we not?

02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:58.970
Have you not heard this phrase?

02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:03.452
If they were launching aspirin today or paracetamol today, never get approved.

02:33:04.032 --> 02:33:05.433
We've all heard that, I think.

02:33:06.073 --> 02:33:12.458
And at one point, maybe still now, you can't buy more than a certain number, two boxes or something.

02:33:13.359 --> 02:33:15.821
So there's a recognition that they are quite dangerous.

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:18.363
And I don't think they're useful either.

02:33:18.383 --> 02:33:20.564
Do you not get headaches?

02:33:21.285 --> 02:33:22.386
Ah, that's the one thing.

02:33:24.847 --> 02:33:30.569
I don't, luckily, but my wife does, and she said the only thing that removes it is aspirin.

02:33:30.909 --> 02:33:32.129
You see, this is the bug factor.

02:33:32.149 --> 02:33:32.529
That's fine.

02:33:33.089 --> 02:33:33.669
Aspirin!

02:33:34.009 --> 02:33:34.609
Ha ha!

02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:43.792
You don't have to go all religious about it, but I would think the default position should be not to reach for medicines when you feel unwell.

02:33:45.712 --> 02:33:51.601
I take a regular painkiller because I manage to get myself into a stupid situation where I have chronic, quite severe pain.

02:33:52.582 --> 02:33:59.452
And I would say that the medicines that are closest to nature are probably the safest.

02:33:59.913 --> 02:34:01.335
So the pharmaceutical industry

02:34:02.296 --> 02:34:12.601
was taken over at the turn of the 19th, 20th century by the Rockefeller School of how can we use the oil industry's products to make things.

02:34:13.101 --> 02:34:17.283
That was one of many ways to use petrochemicals.

02:34:18.643 --> 02:34:22.465
But prior to that, most things were based on herbal remedies.

02:34:22.885 --> 02:34:30.428
And there were lots of anti-inflammatories from plants and pain relievers from plants and so on, things that can dry your secretions from plants.

02:34:31.188 --> 02:34:34.749
And people have known about these things for hundreds of thousands of years probably.

02:34:35.189 --> 02:34:43.933
So used with care under the direction of someone who's been around the block, that is the medicine woman or the witch doctor or whatever, I think

02:34:44.793 --> 02:34:46.114
Yeah, those are probably OK.

02:34:46.154 --> 02:34:52.100
They're probably more likely to work and have been designed by, I call it, God or nature.

02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:56.543
I don't mind how that happened, but they're real natural things.

02:34:56.864 --> 02:34:59.566
And I know creationists would say, God put them there for our use.

02:34:59.586 --> 02:35:01.648
Well, you know my theory on this?

02:35:02.108 --> 02:35:02.249
No.

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:18.701
It goes back to the Tower of Babel, that the fallen angels wanted to make war on God.

02:35:19.801 --> 02:35:26.743
And so they created a sort of simulacrum, a sort of bastard version of heaven on Earth.

02:35:27.583 --> 02:35:30.864
So God provided all these things, these natural things which work.

02:35:31.464 --> 02:35:33.944
And all they can do is invert it and subvert it.

02:35:36.585 --> 02:35:42.967
so that you get sort of chemical simulations made from petroleum products or whatever.

02:35:43.387 --> 02:35:45.328
And they're not like the real thing.

02:35:45.688 --> 02:35:51.490
So basically what I've just said might marry up somewhat with your... It's totally true.

02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:53.931
You're absolutely right.

02:35:54.111 --> 02:35:57.612
And I think there are a small number of products that belong to that category.

02:35:58.273 --> 02:36:01.794
And you have to go and look at each one to see whether they've been inverted.

02:36:03.435 --> 02:36:09.020
or not, but yeah, general rule of thumb, take as few prescription medicines as you possibly can.

02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:19.569
You can't get a health, you can't get a solution to it, to a disorder or an illness, something that's ailing you, from taking chronically a medicine.

02:36:19.629 --> 02:36:22.512
I just, it's not, we're too complicated for that.

02:36:22.812 --> 02:36:25.654
Hey, we're too complicated for that.

02:36:25.674 --> 02:36:27.856
I like it.

02:36:30.100 --> 02:36:32.562
I'm gobsmacked by the ivermectin thing.

02:36:32.582 --> 02:36:34.943
I mean, that is a real, that's a real shock.

02:36:34.983 --> 02:36:43.968
But I think what it shows is Albert Pike's famously said, you know, when they want a hero, we will supply them.

02:36:44.648 --> 02:36:54.314
So during the whole pandemic, the fake pandemic, there were various,

02:36:56.212 --> 02:37:00.134
freedom fighters that you've hinted at, particularly American.

02:37:00.695 --> 02:37:09.300
There's no reason to believe that he is not one of these people, just like Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein, I'm almost sure, are one of these people.

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:15.264
There's no reason to believe that this guy isn't as well because he's risen quite well in social media.

02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:16.885
He says,

02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:19.770
batshit crazy and stuff like that.

02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:27.512
He's undermining his own credibility and undermining his own ability to reach out to new people by acting like that.

02:37:27.552 --> 02:37:32.133
I don't care if it's irony or some weird British humor.

02:37:32.213 --> 02:37:36.274
It's not helping his ability to save new people.

02:37:36.934 --> 02:37:40.395
And it's not helping Mike's ability to save new people.

02:37:40.515 --> 02:37:48.020
doctors who emerged apparently as heroes for our side, that they too were questioning the system and they were fighting back.

02:37:51.642 --> 02:37:56.525
The ones that get prominence are always working for the enemy, aren't they?

02:37:56.545 --> 02:37:57.746
See, that's the point.

02:37:58.347 --> 02:38:03.490
Without naming individuals, there are certain people who I would have regarded professionally as my peers, pretty much.

02:38:06.218 --> 02:38:09.299
Well, yeah, and some in England as well.

02:38:12.601 --> 02:38:13.341
What was he saying?

02:38:16.743 --> 02:38:17.803
Is he saying McCullough?

02:38:18.463 --> 02:38:20.264
Because I would point to Pierre Corrie.

02:38:20.324 --> 02:38:23.005
Pierre Corrie is the one who testified in front of the Senate.

02:38:23.446 --> 02:38:30.369
Pierre Corrie was the witness for the George Floyd trial that helped edify the idea that he was killed by the cops.

02:38:31.289 --> 02:38:37.135
Pierre Cory is the one who told the story about pulse ox numbers being low and them running out of oxygen.

02:38:37.215 --> 02:38:42.880
Pierre Cory is the one who had to fly down to Australia a couple times to testify about what happened in America.

02:38:43.341 --> 02:38:51.989
The same story that was used to justify the lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand that were told, you know, because we locked down, we don't have the kind of disaster that America does.

02:38:53.391 --> 02:38:55.573
I think this Bellingcat guy is not helping us.

02:38:56.372 --> 02:38:59.454
Well, yeah, and some in England as well.

02:39:00.174 --> 02:39:07.719
And they've grown large organizations, the purpose of which is now absolutely clear to me.

02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:14.483
They've grown large organizations like Heart, probably like Panda.

02:39:14.883 --> 02:39:17.445
At least Panda is being actively undermined.

02:39:17.485 --> 02:39:20.106
It feels a lot like the Jiki Leaks,

02:39:21.655 --> 02:39:44.433
Account is somehow aligned with has a controlled op to to heart and panda Especially because Jiki leaks doesn't think that Robert Malone is possibly a part of this doesn't think that Steve Kirsch or or Jessica Rose could possibly be a part of this even though their roles as epi girls and epi guys was

02:39:45.875 --> 02:39:49.157
amazingly well described in the Spars pandemic document.

02:39:49.197 --> 02:40:05.768
And so I've come to the conclusion that most of these anonymous accounts are actually being run or coordinated with these artificially elevated people like Robert Malone, Meryl Ness, Pierre Kory and Sasha Latupova and all these people.

02:40:05.788 --> 02:40:07.649
They're all part of the same bullshit illusion.

02:40:08.741 --> 02:40:13.784
I think that the guy that is interviewing him because of his connections to Bellingcat are also probably part of the illusion.

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:28.891
They're all traitors and they're loyal to the crown or to globalist interests or weaponized piles of money that are giving them comfort and fame in order to perpetuate narratives on social media.

02:40:29.211 --> 02:40:32.794
That person asked me to join as chief scientist, and my instincts were, no.

02:40:33.394 --> 02:40:34.795
See, I just said I didn't join things.

02:40:35.116 --> 02:40:41.881
Also, I didn't like the idea of being involved in money making out of this crisis, because lots of people are doing that.

02:40:42.141 --> 02:40:47.345
And it just immediately, it's going to alter your motivations.

02:40:47.565 --> 02:40:50.647
If you could do something and make a million or do something else and not

02:40:51.604 --> 02:40:53.285
I'm afraid human beings will lie.

02:40:53.305 --> 02:40:55.007
They just do.

02:40:55.027 --> 02:40:59.370
So don't put yourself in a position where... People will lie.

02:41:00.211 --> 02:41:08.878
And we as a culture most fundamentally have moved from when I was a child where lying wasn't considered cool.

02:41:09.679 --> 02:41:13.062
Where lying to get ahead was not considered cool.

02:41:13.482 --> 02:41:16.685
Where fake it until you make it did not exist.

02:41:19.704 --> 02:41:25.507
The Western culture's sort of fundamental principles of success are now based on fake it till you make it.

02:41:26.807 --> 02:41:28.508
Theranos was fake it till you make it.

02:41:28.868 --> 02:41:30.629
And guess what else was fake it till you make it?

02:41:30.949 --> 02:41:32.250
The Human Genome Project.

02:41:35.251 --> 02:41:37.912
There's a benefit from you doing one thing and not another.

02:41:37.972 --> 02:41:44.155
Then that allows me to move with my own thoughts and have things land on me.

02:41:44.575 --> 02:41:45.036
So yeah.

02:41:47.202 --> 02:41:52.525
I was booted off almost every internet platform quite quickly, certainly during 2020.

02:41:53.145 --> 02:41:57.768
LinkedIn just didn't even bother to ban me or temporarily ban me.

02:41:57.788 --> 02:42:02.251
Literally, I would try to log in one day and it was gone.

02:42:02.891 --> 02:42:03.831
So, yeah.

02:42:04.192 --> 02:42:06.173
So, are you telling me you're not control opposition?

02:42:06.966 --> 02:42:08.567
No, apparently not.

02:42:08.907 --> 02:42:09.967
But you would say that, of course.

02:42:10.167 --> 02:42:10.668
Yes, of course.

02:42:10.828 --> 02:42:17.710
I mean, I can't appear as myself on the internet anywhere except on Telegram.

02:42:17.851 --> 02:42:20.552
How many people have used Telegram as a messaging app?

02:42:21.872 --> 02:42:23.813
I never use it, ever.

02:42:24.593 --> 02:42:25.013
Maybe 20%?

02:42:25.734 --> 02:42:31.036
Is he going to tell the story about the fact that actually a guy by the name of, what's his name?

02:42:31.096 --> 02:42:32.657
I got to look at the slide again.

02:42:32.677 --> 02:42:34.217
His name is?

02:42:36.835 --> 02:42:37.856
Robin Martinati.

02:42:37.956 --> 02:42:51.352
Robin Martinati was actually his gatekeeper and controlled his original telegram group for like two years before he finally made his own telegram group after realizing that that guy was basically gatekeeping for him.

02:42:52.954 --> 02:42:55.457
That is a definite nasty man.

02:42:57.256 --> 02:43:00.677
I also busted him big on Twitter before he blocked me.

02:43:00.797 --> 02:43:01.377
Here's the point.

02:43:01.697 --> 02:43:26.685
I mean, you are a concentrated sample of the population who's already wide awake, and only a fifth of you have even... And they're all on a separate social media platform so that all the people that are running those military programs have you already voluntarily segregated into the dissidents and the sheep, the people they know they can lie to and the people they know they have to work extra hard to lie to.

02:43:27.793 --> 02:43:49.772
And so by Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and all these other fake dissidents actively telling us to go to Locals, go to Rumble, go to Telegram, we were being encouraged to show all of our controllers how we stood on things and vote by changing and choosing a different social media platform.

02:43:53.404 --> 02:43:57.111
And it seems like he's still kind of buying into that illusion now.

02:44:05.342 --> 02:44:08.924
So I've got like 23,000 followers.

02:44:09.544 --> 02:44:12.226
I had like 100,000 on Twitter quite early on.

02:44:12.786 --> 02:44:24.313
And yet my peers who are saying similar things like, don't take the vaccines, there is a plot, but they're pushing and flogging ivermectin, for example, have 10 times the number of subscribers.

02:44:24.693 --> 02:44:25.574
How did that happen?

02:44:26.394 --> 02:44:31.836
since my numbers, I think, are being, I know they're being restricted by either AI or humans.

02:44:32.176 --> 02:44:33.116
In fact, maybe both.

02:44:33.156 --> 02:44:44.179
Has any of you, do any of you remember a news story early in 2020 to the effect the British government had hired 20,000 people to work with the 77th Brigade?

02:44:44.199 --> 02:44:44.979
Does anyone?

02:44:44.999 --> 02:44:45.320
20,000 people.

02:44:48.277 --> 02:44:51.300
So it doesn't sound like to me here, this is the problem.

02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:59.949
You see, if those 20,000 people on social media are weaponized against America, they're not doing anything to UK people.

02:44:59.989 --> 02:45:01.611
They're weaponized against America.

02:45:03.373 --> 02:45:08.759
Then is it really Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak?

02:45:09.926 --> 02:45:16.011
You know the guys that Jikki Leaks and Charles Rixey and all these people want us to focus on?

02:45:16.491 --> 02:45:32.244
Is it really them then if 20,000 people in the UK needed to be hired in order to create an illusion of consensus on social media to support a biological phenomenon that could be described as a out of control, unrestricted bioweapon?

02:45:34.045 --> 02:45:34.726
Stop lying!

02:45:35.486 --> 02:45:38.329
These people were all put in place to create this Scooby-Doo

02:45:39.554 --> 02:45:40.775
and we're still not free of it.

02:45:41.896 --> 02:45:42.696
That's just the UK.

02:45:42.716 --> 02:45:44.097
There were people in America.

02:45:44.157 --> 02:45:45.558
There were people in Canada.

02:45:57.228 --> 02:46:01.953
And most of them we are paying attention to right now as dissident heroes.

02:46:02.634 --> 02:46:10.522
The obvious ones are people like Jessica Rose, but there are more recent ones like Ahmed Malik or William Mackus who have been added.

02:46:11.650 --> 02:46:20.672
People that play a role in reinforcing the strict, limited spectrum of debate that doesn't usefully question the foundational mythology.

02:46:20.852 --> 02:46:25.994
Motorcycles, and so I have an identity that's relevant to that, are for YouTube.

02:46:26.554 --> 02:46:37.337
So I'll sometimes comment below YouTube videos, and if they get anywhere close to my area of expertise, I can write it, press enter, and it appears, refresh the screen, gone.

02:46:38.574 --> 02:46:40.196
repeatedly in front of me.

02:46:40.856 --> 02:46:44.819
So that's either an automated system or it's a human.

02:46:45.179 --> 02:47:07.297
And so you can see the censorship and you can have him complain about the censorship, but I assure you the censorship is a small drop in the bucket compared to how important it is that my brother will never get his brother by social media put in front of his face, even though we're related.

02:47:08.439 --> 02:47:14.723
My parents can go on social media all they want and social media will never say, Hey, your son is in Pittsburgh.

02:47:14.743 --> 02:47:16.084
Do you want to see what he's up to?

02:47:19.286 --> 02:47:31.574
But it's more than likely that they've seen some of these liars that I've been identifying over the last four years, wittingly or unwittingly seeing them as either good guys or bad guys because social media put them in front of them rather than me.

02:47:33.792 --> 02:47:40.216
Even though it makes algorithmic sense, if you believe in algorithms, that my brother should have a hard time avoiding my posts.

02:47:41.617 --> 02:47:44.918
People went to high school with me, should have a hard time avoiding my posts.

02:47:45.419 --> 02:47:48.280
But that's not what social media is based on.

02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:50.462
Social media is a governance organ.

02:47:50.542 --> 02:47:51.883
It is a governance tool.

02:47:52.263 --> 02:47:59.367
It is a military program designed to put the heroes that they want you to rally behind in front of your eyes and into your ears.

02:48:01.875 --> 02:48:12.184
Sometimes I get annoyed and I write saying, if you are a 77th Brigade person who just deleted that comment, can you look your children in the eyes when you go home?

02:48:12.764 --> 02:48:15.426
Can you hold your own gaze in the mirror?

02:48:16.627 --> 02:48:26.236
Are you really stupid enough that you think whoever's paying you is going to let you keep your ill-gotten gains while you destroy the society that you're living in?

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:28.417
They don't have children because they can't get girlfriends.

02:48:29.358 --> 02:48:37.961
But you know what, on two or three occasions, censorship had diminished on that platform for a day or so afterwards.

02:48:37.981 --> 02:48:45.643
So it's like either a prayer worked and the AI, chat GTP, felt chastised, or a human thought, blimey, he's right.

02:48:46.023 --> 02:48:46.343
Either way.

02:48:47.224 --> 02:48:51.605
So I can't even write anonymous comments online.

02:48:52.645 --> 02:48:54.246
I'm not on the, you know,

02:48:55.166 --> 02:48:58.893
Everything is, if I write something on Twitter under H Cimiez,

02:49:00.343 --> 02:49:01.343
There's no point in knowing that.

02:49:01.623 --> 02:49:04.445
Who the hell cares what H. Simeon thinks?

02:49:06.086 --> 02:49:13.691
I can put controversial but provable statements in a very popular thread where other people are reading and replying to other people's comments.

02:49:13.711 --> 02:49:16.773
So we're still really talking a lot about the censorship.

02:49:17.674 --> 02:49:19.215
We're about three hours in.

02:49:19.275 --> 02:49:24.679
I'm going to cut it here and then I'm going to watch the rest of this myself and see if we need to do another episode tomorrow.

02:49:26.299 --> 02:49:29.721
We got a lot of work to do over the next few days, like eight or nine days.

02:49:29.861 --> 02:49:40.727
My kids' school starts next week, in the middle of the week, but I will actually kick off my biology class and my statistics class on Monday following.

02:49:40.767 --> 02:49:44.889
So it'll be the last, I gotta look at this calendar here to see where that is.

02:49:46.445 --> 02:49:51.708
But that's when we're going to start, because that's when I can guarantee you that I can be here every day at 10 o'clock.

02:49:51.748 --> 02:50:01.272
And I think if we're going to do a school or a course or a mini course, that I need to be able to show up every day at the same time and have some consistent, you know,

02:50:02.192 --> 02:50:19.567
Work being done and right now because my kids are home and because I missed them for five weeks while they were in the Netherlands and because I only have a few more days with them I'm trying to juggle my schedule and optimize it in such a way so that I can help with them all being at home but more importantly that I can spend some time with them while they're still home all day and

02:50:19.947 --> 02:50:34.570
before school starts and then dedicate the time once school starts exclusively you know eight hours a day or six hours a day or seven hours a day during the week during the day to producing multiple shows one will always be a biology class of my own

02:50:35.511 --> 02:50:36.031
curriculum.

02:50:36.051 --> 02:50:45.013
And then the other one that I'm going to do right away in the afternoon is I'm going to start with class one of Matt Briggs' Substack series.

02:50:45.874 --> 02:50:51.015
It's basically a basic statistics course, a broken science kind of statistics course.

02:50:51.055 --> 02:50:57.276
And I will just follow those lectures and take notes and discuss them with the chat and with you as a second course.

02:50:57.757 --> 02:50:58.837
And so we're going to try and do

02:50:59.897 --> 02:51:03.499
daily stuff, but I don't know how many days are going to be class and how many days aren't.

02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:06.641
But whenever we do class days, there will be two classes.

02:51:06.681 --> 02:51:19.609
There will be a biology class that is my curriculum and a statistics class that is essentially us study hauling Matt Briggs's online sub stack that you may or may not be aware of.

02:51:19.649 --> 02:51:20.690
And if you're not, you can find it.

02:51:21.150 --> 02:51:21.891
So I'll do that.

02:51:22.572 --> 02:51:23.333
I'll do that now.

02:51:23.393 --> 02:51:31.782
And I think it's a good idea also from the perspective of PeerTube to give the capacity of the server enough time to catch up with where we are.

02:51:31.863 --> 02:51:37.669
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we need a new consensus about what a national security state would and wouldn't do.

02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:52.699
And I think a national security state would definitely use murder and lies in order to protect the vaccine schedule as the criminal enterprise that it is, and to convert us to believing that RNA can pandemic, but also transfection can save you from it.

02:51:53.179 --> 02:52:04.807
And I think we need to teach our childrens that transfection was always criminally negligent in healthy humans, that RNA cannot pandemic, and the vaccine schedule in America and around the world needs to be paused as part

02:52:05.931 --> 02:52:13.878
of a real reawakening to the irreducible complexity that we are and a more healthy reverence for it.

02:52:14.438 --> 02:52:19.262
Ladies and gentlemen, if you liked what you saw, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support this work.

02:52:19.703 --> 02:52:23.446
If you want to share it, please share from https://gigaombiological.com

02:52:24.887 --> 02:52:34.354
stream.gigaohm.bio because that's our own website and you don't need to log in and you can just share the links and you can even download from there, including the audio.

02:52:34.694 --> 02:52:36.015
We're still working on Funk Whale.

02:52:36.035 --> 02:52:39.538
I haven't heard from Ted whether that's working or not, but I think you can already download the audio.

02:52:39.998 --> 02:52:41.019
Anyway, thanks for joining me.

02:52:41.059 --> 02:52:41.759
Thanks for being here.

02:52:41.779 --> 02:52:42.980
I hope it wasn't too long.

02:52:43.621 --> 02:52:49.805
And, uh, worst case scenario, I see you tomorrow, um, for the rest, second half of that that needs to be addressed.

02:52:50.245 --> 02:52:52.347
Otherwise, please share this stream with Mike Eden.

02:52:52.387 --> 02:52:53.067
Give a shout out.

02:52:53.768 --> 02:52:57.511
Um, I think there's more to be addressed because he didn't talk about the PCR yet.

02:52:58.171 --> 02:53:02.834
Um, and he does make some mistakes with regard to, uh, false positives.

02:53:02.874 --> 02:53:04.275
And so maybe I'll just have to clip it.

02:53:04.315 --> 02:53:04.676
We'll see.

02:53:05.036 --> 02:53:06.057
Thanks very much for joining me.

02:53:06.097 --> 02:53:06.877
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:53:07.578 --> 02:53:07.818
Whoops.

02:53:09.906 --> 02:53:11.603
My volume needs to go down.

02:54:35.506 --> 02:54:37.053
Thanks for everybody being in the chat.

02:54:37.113 --> 02:54:39.423
Thanks for being on Soapbox when I'm not.

02:54:39.544 --> 02:54:39.845
Thanks for
