WEBVTT

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
each one of us.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
And we will all die.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
It's the effect of sin in our lives, we can't escape it.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
But I'm also

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
discouraged.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
And there's a little bit of me that's angry.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
I was driving to work the other day and I just screamed.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I missed my dad.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
And in my opinion, he was murdered by the medical machine.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
There was something unique about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, COVID-19, the crisis,

18:52.000 --> 19:02.000
by which the hospitals, almost exclusively, were the venue of death.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
That's a powerful thing for him to say.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
When he came on my stream, he wasn't really totally there yet, I don't think.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
When he came on our stream, he didn't want to really do that thought experiment

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
about whether the hospitals could have caused it all

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
and that the protocols could have caused it all.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Now, there is a little trap there.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
And the trap is, is that the story of that particular man and his father

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
was the hospital in Texas preventing him from getting Ivermectin.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Now, why do I say that's a trap?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm not trying to be a shit.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
I'm trying to point out that the one thing that never seems to catch on,

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
that never seems to catch fire, that nobody's ever making a documentary about,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
is remdesivir.

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
Don't we have a lot more documented cases of remdesivir use?

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
And don't we know that remdesivir helped no one?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm still really confused about this, because in my understanding of everything

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
that I've been able to read, remdesivir, in all the trials that it was used,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
for Ebola, for whatever else that it was used for, it never worked.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
I've always hurt people.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
And so part of what I thought was so annoying about this Brian artist guy,

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
when he came out and said that remdesivir, and there's venom in the shots or something like that,

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
he had a great message about remdesivir that was essentially destroyed

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
because he also said that there was venom and snake venom and something,

20:50.000 --> 20:58.000
and stupidters his show, and then everything else that he said about remdesivir went down the toilet with him.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
And since then, nobody's been able to accurately articulate in the dissident movement

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
how bad remdesivir was in Ebola trials and how ridiculous it would be to use it

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
and how many people behind the scenes of this apparatus seem to be really keen

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
on sneaking it in as early as possible before there was anything else effective.

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
This is extremely curious now that, again, when we have all of this possible cordwood to stack up,

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
literally anybody that had remdesivir could in theory get in on this,

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
because all of them are likely going to have a medical chart that says,

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
well, we gave him remdesivir and then his kidneys filled up and he got pneumonia and then he died,

21:47.000 --> 21:54.000
or those things happened and he escaped anyway, but anybody that was given remdesivir,

21:54.000 --> 22:02.000
in my humble opinion, might should be encouraged to sue the government for being given a poison,

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
whereas not allowing someone to have Ivermectin in the hospital is a little grayer of an area.

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
But forcing people, forcing doctors, encouraging doctors, requiring doctors to use a protocol that included a poison

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
that you could identify as a poison by going into the literature and reading is highly dubious,

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
and the fact that nobody's making a show of this yet is also highly dubious,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
where we have all these people suing about Ivermectin not being allowed in hospitals,

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
and it's like all these anecdotal cases of I wanted Ivermectin for my mom, but she couldn't get it.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
What about all the people who didn't want their kid, their loved one on remdesivir or on a ventilator?

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
And don't we have the added bonus of the fact that the government told them to do it,

23:02.000 --> 23:09.000
that makes it even more like reason to pursue the justice?

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
I get that, you know, doctors not, people not being able to get the medicine that they want,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
but I'm just telling you, there's a trap here.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
There's a trap here, there's a trap here, and there are obvious reasons why it's got to be a trap.

23:25.000 --> 23:37.000
I don't say there's anybody bad here, nobody's bad, but what I'm saying is that the algorithms

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
and the people that control and use the algorithms to control us just need to elevate the wrong stories

23:44.000 --> 23:52.000
and let those wrong stories catch on because we have so much empathy for everyone that has suffered,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
and when these stories catch on then what ends up happening is the Scooby-Doo gets sustained

23:57.000 --> 24:07.000
because this limited spectrum of debate that's not meant to include things like remdesivir or the opioid crisis

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
is carefully curated by things like this.

24:11.000 --> 24:19.000
If this thing goes viral, it's great and it's awesome that Peter McCullough is saying that it's crazy

24:19.000 --> 24:30.000
how everybody died in a hospital, take it one step further and say everybody died from a hospital protocol

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
because if you went into the hospital but your doctor could still do whatever they wanted,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
it probably wouldn't have mattered, but that's not what happened, they went into a hospital

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
and then they had a very strict sheet because it's a novel virus for which we have no idea what to do

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
except for this protocol.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
That we don't need to be injected into these darkest issuance.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I would like to.

24:55.000 --> 25:07.000
You would remember or recall a Dr. Birkholt who replicated some of the work of Dr. Kevin McKernan

25:07.000 --> 25:18.000
using his primers and actually also adding a little nanopore sequencing to show that these DNA fragments were indeed in the Pfizer shot

25:18.000 --> 25:26.000
and we stopped that video unfortunately after he was done lecturing and we didn't watch the question and answer

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
and I regret that now so I'm going to show you one bit of it right here.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
It's only two minutes and it will shock you.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
Whoops.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
That we don't need to be injected into these darkest issuance.

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
I would like to do that and I will not get it unless I get a batch and find out that it's free of DNA and then I'll take it myself.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
But I don't have any way of compelling that to happen.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
So it was just basically a way to save money by doing it in such volume that way.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
So first he said that if he could show that it had no DNA and he would take it.

26:06.000 --> 26:15.000
So he disagrees with my main slide which is the transfection is not immunization.

26:15.000 --> 26:24.000
So in the best case scenario, perfect RNA, perfect LNP, perfect quality control, that's all that's in there.

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
I still think that transfection is absolutely a ridiculous idea for medicine.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Never mind an immunization in a healthy animal.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Never mind in a healthy human.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
Never mind in a person who wanted to live a long healthy life.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
He says that if it doesn't have any DNA and he'd be fine to take it.

26:49.000 --> 26:59.000
I need you to hear that because that is a very large cruise ship size disagreement between me and Dr. Burke Halter.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
Or Burke, I think it's Buckhalt, Buckhalt, sorry, Burke Halter, I don't know why I said that.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Where's my play button?

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
You got to be careful I'm going to advance the slide here, here we go.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I think nobody thought about it.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
I think it was reasonable to use the E. coli to blow up the plasma to make the stuff.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
And then the pieces of the DNA are of a very uniform and small size.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
That's evidence that they took efforts to try to chop it up.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And then they knew about it.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah, they knew it.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And they took efforts to chop it up.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
They just didn't get it all out.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
But having said that, I guess that they just didn't think about the hazard for genome modification.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Because it's not all that expensive to add another process to get it out.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, that's what I'm saying.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I can't get inside their mind.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
I don't rush too much, and that's what I'm saying.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
We've heard testimony of these subsequent, you know, variant, subsequent boosters, et cetera, et cetera.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Or leading to maybe not scientific yet.

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
But at least collateral mileage that it apparently, these things are causing death and disability later on.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And also the aging process, which you heard about.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
There's a lot of suspicious associations.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
But that seems to me that before we can, in South Carolina,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
give this new vaccine of whirl around here.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
Seems to me that our people ought to be able to look at that, Mr. Chairman,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and see whether or not it's got this DNA.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
And if it does, fine, tell everybody it's got the DNA and the problems associated there with.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Then you got informed consent.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Correct.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Okay.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
But without that, we didn't have informed consent.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I'm not really happy about that, Mr. Chairman, and do what I can to try to help.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Knowing what I know.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
Knowing what I know now about this, I would still have recommended it to my elderly parents.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Okay.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
But I probably would not have given it to my daughters.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
And I feel like my consent was not as informed as it should have been.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen, that's in in a nutshell right there.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
He would have given it to his parents, but maybe not to his daughters.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
I'm sorry.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
This is not an expert.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
This is not a biologist.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
This is a gene jockey.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
It's somebody who knows how to bake on a laboratory bench.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
But as far as understanding biology, as far as really understanding.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
What he's talking about.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
He doesn't understand what transfection is.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
He doesn't understand what transfection challenges your body to do in the best case scenario.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Otherwise, he wouldn't recommend it to his parents or his daughters.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
To anyone.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
You must hear it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
You must see it.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
And that's why he will be elevated if necessary.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
I suspect that Kevin McCurnan would say very similar things.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
We are not dealing with people who are on our team.

30:18.000 --> 30:26.000
We are dealing with people who are posing as dissidents to control the spectrum of debate

30:26.000 --> 30:34.000
and to participate in what appears to be a fairly, fairly dissident discussion within that spectrum.

30:34.000 --> 30:44.000
They are performers.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
On the subject of vaccines, it seems to be a great interest of yours.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
I challenge you to make that debate me on it.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm going to tell you just what my position is.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
My position is not any science.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
My position is exactly aligned with the National Academy of Science and the Institute of Medicine.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
People don't know my position because people call me an anti-vaxxer, but I'm not.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I'm pro-vaccine.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I had all my children vaccinated.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
I believe that vaccines should be tested.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Safety tested.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
People don't know.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
You cannot sue a company that makes vaccines that injures you.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
No matter how egregious the injury is, no matter how negligent that company was, no matter how toxic the ingredient.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
Furthermore, they're completely insulated, so there's no incentive for them to make vaccines safe.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Furthermore, they're also exempt.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
They're the only medicine that's exempt from safety testing.

31:45.000 --> 31:53.000
So now, one of the 72 vaccines currently given to our children, mandated, has ever been tested against a placebo.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
That means nobody knows what the risk profile is, and nobody can say with a scientific certainty,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
that vaccine is averting more problems than it causes.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
And I don't think that we ought to be mandating medical interventions for unwilling Americans unless we know

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
precisely that that vaccine is going to end up helping people rather than hurting them.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
The Institute of Medicine is the ultimate arbiter of vaccine science, according to Congress and HHS.

32:24.000 --> 32:35.000
And the Institute of Medicine has time and again in 1991, 1994, 2011, 2014, has scolded and rebuked

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
and screamed at CDC for not doing safety testing on any of these vaccines.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
And we've seen vaccine schedule, I had three vaccines when I was a kid.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
My children got 72.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
It changed into 89, and if you were born prior to 89, you're a chance of having a chronic disease.

32:55.000 --> 33:01.000
Rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, autism, food allergies, is 12%.

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
If you were born after 89, it is 54%, according to HHS.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
And nobody's explaining, where is it all coming from?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Where's all the autism coming from?

33:14.000 --> 33:23.000
If it's not vaccine, I is in my generation, 1 in 2,500 kids in autism, and this generation, 1 in 34.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
CDC is supposed to tell us where the diseases are coming from.

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
I is in my generation, 1 in 4, 100 kids at food allergies, peanut allergies, and 1 in 10 today.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And guess what?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Look at the vaccine inserts.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
All the 400 diseases that are now epidemic in our children.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
All right.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
So, we're...

33:47.000 --> 33:56.000
Okay, so you've heard that before probably, but I like to play it because some people like to play it and say that that means that he's four vaccines and he's not really against it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Other people will say that while he realizes that when they're tested, they won't be...

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
They won't test...

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
Or they won't pass the testing, and so there are no safe vaccines.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
Now, as we move forward, this bait on TV is going to get worse and worse and worse.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
They're putting out bait now with regard to Israel and Palestine.

34:20.000 --> 34:27.000
Even I have been somewhat tempted to tweet about things that I shouldn't tweet about.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Because it's...

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
It's loss of focus.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
And with regard to what we're doing here, I want to stay focused on the biology as much as I possibly can.

34:41.000 --> 34:49.000
And a person that went on my radar very early in Canada was Byron Brittle.

34:49.000 --> 35:01.000
He was the guy who originally released the Japanese description of the bio-distribution data that they had in their pharmacovigilance study.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
And he was the one who first let loose the idea that the lipid nanoparticle wasn't contained in the arm,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
but went around the body and went all different places.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
And of course, we know that Byron Brittle didn't have to lose his career and they didn't have to burn him.

35:17.000 --> 35:28.000
Because Peter Kullis said it in 2022 while he was accepting or doing his Canadian little Nobel Prize tour.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
The Gardener Awards.

35:32.000 --> 35:43.000
And he admitted very specifically that he had burned five postdocs on that project and the fifth postdoc threatened to quit if he didn't let her switch her project.

35:43.000 --> 35:55.000
But Byron Brittle lost his career and faced a lot of public scrutiny in 2020 or early 2021 for revealing the Japanese document.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
And it turns out, of course, he was 100% right, the document wasn't a lie.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
And they knew that already from a long time ago, the lipid nanoparticle people knew it.

36:07.000 --> 36:18.000
Peter Kullis knew it, but he just assumed it was fine because the Pfizer said it was 95% effective, so he just had a scotch.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
So I just want to watch a little bit of this video. It's like an hour and a half long, so we're not going to watch the whole thing.

36:25.000 --> 36:34.000
But I want to watch his introduction. I want to watch, listen to him tell his story and his position on vaccines and what he does.

36:34.000 --> 36:43.000
And I want you to hear the very similar parallels to what Bobby just said and often says about his position on vaccines.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
And then we'll wrap it up.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
Hello, I am Sherry Strong. I'm the Alberta Provincial Director for Children's Health Defense Canada.

36:54.000 --> 37:03.000
And for those of you who've been following us for the last three years, this is I haven't done an interview for quite a long time for various reasons.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
And I'm back into it with a very exciting guest, Dr. Byron Brittle.

37:09.000 --> 37:24.000
And he is an associate professor of virology, viral immunology in the Department of Pathology in the University of Guelph and through the Ontario College as well.

37:24.000 --> 37:34.000
And he, if you, if you search for him, you're going to find two things. You're going to find a fake page that is defamatory.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
Don't, don't take it too seriously, but to go.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
That's right.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Leave a comment at the end.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
That's right.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Send them a message.

37:42.000 --> 37:51.000
He actually had a page, believe it or not, that we think was made by, made by that Rasmussen chick.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
And she made a, she made a page of Byron Brittle.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
That was defamatory to him that had a header that had a pug.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
And because it had a pug dog there, that was the one clue that we had that it might be her.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
And she's also moved from Georgetown to somewhere in Canada.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
At the start of this pandemic to take residency as a virologist up there at some vaccine thing.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm pretty sure it was her.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
It's her name is Angela, Angela Rasmussen.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, she's a real winner.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So I would recommend that.

38:27.000 --> 38:37.000
And also if you type in the words, if you look at the keywords for which he's known oncology, cancer, therapeutics in unit therapy.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
Oncolytic, viral therapy, translational oncology and clinical studies.

38:43.000 --> 38:51.000
So is there anything Byron that I've left out in that brief introduction that you think is relevant to our viewers?

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
Just, no, nothing that you've left out, just two things.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Points of clarification for your viewers.

38:58.000 --> 39:08.000
So some people here that, that I work at the Ontario veterinary college, and this often comes up in court cases where I serve as an expert witness and opposing council.

39:08.000 --> 39:15.000
Tries to make it seem like I'm just a veterinarian and only know about animal health and couldn't know anything about human health.

39:15.000 --> 39:23.000
I actually love it if opposing council in court cases bring that up because it allows me to provide this explanation.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
A, I'm not a veterinarian.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
B, my research is primarily focused on human health.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
So it's centered on that.

39:31.000 --> 39:42.000
So I can tell you, I see in the chat that Albert has dropped in that after the Japanese document, that's when curse said he then called up Weinstein and Malone and did the dark horse podcast.

39:42.000 --> 39:54.000
So that's really curious because I've had the feeling, I've had the feeling from the very beginning that Byron was somebody that needed controlling.

39:54.000 --> 40:02.000
And I actually had the privilege, excuse me, I'm burping, drinking a big bottle of water.

40:02.000 --> 40:11.000
I had the privilege of presenting to a group of people in Canada in which Byron Bridal was sitting.

40:11.000 --> 40:23.000
And at the end of the talk, he actually made a comment that I thought was really, he gave me a compliment about my talk and then he said, you know, I'm really excited that you brought up this replication.

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
Replication and competent fraction because I'd never thought of it before, but I've made vaccines before.

40:31.000 --> 40:43.000
And when you make an AV vaccine, you know, you set the requirements for the purity of the particles that are produced.

40:44.000 --> 40:58.000
And we had real trouble reaching our desired levels of particle purity because there were so many replication in competent partial genomes packaged in these.

40:59.000 --> 41:07.000
Identivirus particles. It's a real challenge for viral manufacture. It's a great point, Jonathan.

41:07.000 --> 41:27.000
So that was just another, another sort of green check next to Byron Bridal on my, on my whiteboard because, you know, when you're asked to respond to certain things when you're when you're shown new ideas and you react in what is a genuinely

41:28.000 --> 41:45.000
a genuine learning behavior. I don't really want the right way to say it is, but you can tell when people are genuinely thinking along with you or whether they're thinking against you or whether they're trying to obfuscate what idea you're trying to convey.

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
And in the two times that I've interacted with Byron, I've never gotten that feeling.

41:53.000 --> 42:02.000
I've always gotten the feeling that he's listening, that he's humble, that he just assumes that, you know, probably somebody's got something to say. They probably have something he can learn.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
He's a really good guy.

42:04.000 --> 42:13.000
The reason why I'm at the Ontario Veterinary College is because it allows me to do much more advanced translational research than what I could do if I was associated with a medical school.

42:13.000 --> 42:30.000
So I did my postdoctoral training in medical school. And in fact, so what a lot of people wouldn't know because this isn't shared anywhere is I actually had competing offers from two different universities to hire me originally as an assistant professor.

42:30.000 --> 42:37.000
And one of them was the University of Ottawa where they wanted to embed me in their medical school because they need more immunology expertise.

42:38.000 --> 42:50.000
But I specifically decided on the Ontario Veterinary College because this is the thing, this is the interesting thing, almost all biomedical research that we would say is human focused.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
It deals with research with rodents, rodent models, mice, and rats.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
So I often, jokingly refer to myself as an expert in terminology as well.

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
And so the whole point is I can do that research at a medical school and where I'm currently located at the Ontario Veterinary College.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.000
So I can do all of that, you know, vermin based human focused research.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
But more, and I can get access to human samples, right?

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Because we don't usually do research directly with human beings, right?

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
But I can certainly get samples from hospitals just as if I were associated.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I, that was the one project that was really sad to lose.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
I had started a project in Rotterdam where I was getting glioma patient neocortex.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
So real human brain material out of a live human brain that I could record under a microscope.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
And that was pretty crazy.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That was some pretty crazy stuff.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
That was some fun times.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It was a medical school.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
But this is the thing.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
We have an animal cancer center and we have an animal hospital.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
And so this presents a different type of patient, right?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Veterinary patients.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
And these veterinary patients are what I would call...

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Well, you know, vets are also really highly paid.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
If you get to be a vet for a pharmaceutical company or something like that, I mean, you know, Bob's your uncle.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Gee whiz.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
We sometimes call highly advanced translational models of disease.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
They have spontaneous diseases exactly like we do, right?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
They develop spontaneous cancers.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
They get infected.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
They, you know, get infectious diseases just like we do.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
They share our genetic diversity and they even share our very specific environmental influences.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
So that's very important to understand.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
And so the idea being that if we do, when we do research in these advanced translational models,

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
we should have greater success translating that success into human clinical trials

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
and things of benefit to people than if we try and make that giant leap

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
that usually happens at medical schools going from rodents directly into people.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
And then the second thing is you mentioned that website.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
So I just want to point out a point of clarification.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Yeah, indeed, it's highly defamatory.

45:04.000 --> 45:12.000
It was developed within 24 hours of me giving sort of an infamous radio interview.

45:12.000 --> 45:21.000
And I, and my understanding is that it's illegal because it's actually a form of impersonation,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
which is illegal.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
The name was used and the people who run this site pretend to be me.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
There's also a defamatory Twitter account that was done at the site made at the same time.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
And that's called not Dr. Byron Bridal, but then has, does the Twitter or X handle has,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
hashtag Byron Bridal.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So again, impersonation.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And I just want to point out there's a lot of stuff in there.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
But if anybody ever wants, like that's the thing you listeners have to understand.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
The people that have defamed me that way, the people accused me of providing misinformation

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
over the past couple of years, not one of them, not one single person, not one human being on this planet,

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
has ever engaged in a discussion with me and allowed me.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
In fact, that entire website was designed after a nine, this is crazy, after a nine minute radio interview

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
where I was talking to a lay audience.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
And yet these people are critiquing the words that I use there still to this day.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
They're still critiquing that.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
And out of that, I may be talking about seven minutes.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
So they're taking seven minutes of me talking to a lay audience

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
and they're critiquing it like it's hardcore science.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It's absolutely ludicrous.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
But the point being that I can rebut, and I have rebutted over time in different public areas,

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
every single comment, every single smear that is in that website.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
And I would contend that if anybody wants to believe what's on the website or anything on the website

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
or anything that I've said, ask the people that are pushing that messaging

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
to have a public discussion with me, and it'll become blatantly obvious who the real expert is

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
and who actually understands what they're talking about.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Well, they don't disclose who they are.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
So do you know who they are? Do you know if it's a pharma company, if it's government funded?

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
I have no idea. Honestly, I have no idea.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
That's something, if any of your listeners actually have IT expertise

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
and are able to figure out who's behind any of this, that would be incredibly helpful

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
because that website and the people who are behind this and the people behind the Twitter account.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
So I have no way to contact, for example, Elon Musk.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
But this Twitter account, not Dr. Byron Bridal, if anybody has the ear of Elon Musk

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
and could figure out what the source is, who's doing this, it'd be fabulous

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
because the same people are attacking all of my colleagues around the world

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
who are also sharing hardcore scientific truths backed by the overall weight

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
of the primary scientific data, right?

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
These people are attacking and defaming us and destroying our careers.

47:59.000 --> 48:04.000
For me, many other scientists and many physicians across the world.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Yeah.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
So let's talk a little bit about your story.

48:09.000 --> 48:17.000
So you, what I've gathered is that you were a believer in vaccines.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
And what point did you start to question the COVID vaccine?

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
Yeah. So just to clarify, yeah, I absolutely was a believer in vaccines

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
and I'm still a believer in vaccines. This is the thing.

48:31.000 --> 48:38.000
I will defend to the bitter end the, the, the elegant concept of vaccination.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
And what I mean by that is, you know, I actually contacted Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
and had a conversation with him because you know what?

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
When I was teaching voxenology in university, I actually used him as an example

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
of a classic anti-voxer. And when I came to realize all these concerns

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
and all these concerns developed over the past few years,

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
I, I wanted a conversation with him.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
First of all, I wanted to apologize to him.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
So I did that first with him privately.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
And then I publicly announced this apology multiple times.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
And here I'm happy to do so yet again, because what people need to realize, you know,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
he's been labeled sort of a lifelong anti-voxer.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
I'm a voxenologist. I've been labeled remarkably an anti-voxer somehow.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I still am developing novel vaccines.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Like right as we speak, I have a project, research project ongoing right now,

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
where I'm developing a cancer vaccine right as we speak.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
And I've continued to publish on, on vaccine technologies and ways to optimize

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
vaccines and vaccine safety all throughout these past few years.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
But here's the thing.

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
So my philosophy is exactly like what I, what JFK, Jr.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
shared with me in our private discussion, right?

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
Which is that we're both very much like he's very much pro vaccine.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
I've always been pro vaccine, but specifically we're pro safe and effective

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
vaccines. And now we've heard that mantra ad nauseam.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And this is the thing.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
I was prior to 2020, I was living in kind of my own quiet world of research

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
where I was doing a lot of preclinical research.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
So I do work research at the early stages of developing ideas,

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
literally brand new vaccination strategies, brand new vaccines.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
And then if we have early success with that, I try and get people to get excited

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
and take that then into the translational research pipeline and ultimately

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
into human clinical trials.

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
And indeed, one of my vaccine technologies did go into four human clinical trials.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
But when I become aware of because everything do with COVID-19 fell right

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
within my wheelhouse, right?

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
We're talking about SARS Coronavirus 2, which is a causative agent of COVID-19

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
and the proposed miracle solution was the vaccines.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And so all the science fell in my wheelhouse.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
And I saw early on that we were going way off track with the science.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
And I've got many, many, many concerns about these to the point where I even

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
hesitate to call them vaccines.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
I don't fall under the traditional definition of a vaccine in the United States.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
In Canada, technically speaking, they do fall under our definition of a vaccine,

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
but we have a specific definition of an ideal vaccine,

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
and there is far from being an ideal vaccine as one can possibly get

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
while still trying to keep them under that umbrella term.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
And the reality is from a regulatory perspective,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Ike would contend very strongly that these are not,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
you should not have been regulated as vaccines,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
but rather as gene therapies.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
And in fact, they are much more similar to what we call prodrugs.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
And I could explain to your audience if you want what that means later,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
but prodrugs, not vaccines.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
And so at the end of the day,

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm a person who follows the science.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
Early on, I was so excited as a vaccinologist that vaccines were going to save the world

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
from this terrible disease.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Now, first of all, it's turned out to not be as terrible as disease

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
as we originally thought.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
Much less so, in fact, much less dangerous than we originally had labeled it.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
But nevertheless, I was excited about the vaccines.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
And so I monitored the development of these early treatment strategies

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
where all kinds of physicians were repurposing drugs and using combination strategies,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
things like Ivermectin and hydroxylchloroquine,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
and all kinds of other supplements, right?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Vitamin D, and vitamin C, and zinc, et cetera.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
And it was kind of like his battle.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
It was kind of like his 50-50 battle.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
There were papers coming out supporting it.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
There were papers coming out that were contending that these things weren't helpful.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
And I was okay with that because, again, I'm a vaccinologist,

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
and I thought this is great.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
And I had received funding that was very difficult to obtain

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
from my provincial government and our federal government

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
And I did make six different COVID-19 vaccines,

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
but I've abandoned that research because of the concerns that developed.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And this is the thing.

53:12.000 --> 53:20.000
So when doing this, I started looking very critically at the papers

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
because we couldn't have approved the use of these shots without,

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
if there were an array of effective treatments available.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
And so I started looking at the papers.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
And when it came to the drugs of chloroquine,

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
and especially the hypermectin, I saw that trials were designed.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
They had fatal, I would contend, fatal flaws in their design.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
Okay, so this is surprisingly on narrative.

53:49.000 --> 53:58.000
Again, he calls, he calls, he's still a fan of vaccines.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
He calls RFK Jr.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
He has a conversation.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
He's working on novel vaccines for cancer.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
He's written papers about optimizing vaccines and vaccine safety.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
They're both pro-vaccines.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
They just want safe and effective vaccines.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Now, the real question is what if there are zero safe vaccines, right?

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
That's the question we're asking all the time.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
And that's why we start with that slide in the beginning that says

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
there are no safe vaccines.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
So these aren't vaccines, he says.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
They should have been regulated like gene therapies.

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
So that kind of implies they're not vaccines because they're not safe.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
He's a vaccine fan.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
He has in no way shape or form considered the possibility

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
that previous vaccines also haven't been tested.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Also have been foisted on the population.

54:47.000 --> 54:54.000
Either too early or too often.

54:54.000 --> 54:59.000
And so I'm very, very curious by this.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
But staying with his.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
My gut feeling is that he's a totally ridiculously honest man.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
He just spits the truth.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
And that's why it sometimes comes out in the wrong order.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
It comes out like almost awkwardly.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
And here he says, you know,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I got some of that good old fashioned grant money to develop

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
COVID vaccines.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
And he developed six different ones.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
But he abandoned all that research now because of all the problems.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
But that's a pretty interesting admission.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
It gives him some street cred in terms of, you know, he was fully on board

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
and now he, he, he, he, he's decided this is crazy.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
Which means even more likely that he needed to be controlled.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
He needed to be overshadowed.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
So instead of having Byron Bridal on every newscast in the United States

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
and having him go completely viral because of what he was doing in Canada.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
We put Steve Kersch and Robert Malone on the, on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

56:10.000 --> 56:17.000
And then Peter Teal and Elon Musk and, and Mark Zuckerberg and,

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
and his wife made that go viral instead of Byron Bridal.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
Problem solved.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Look at the timeline.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Look who went viral and who didn't.

56:35.000 --> 56:42.000
Who started a national and, and global tour, not Byron Bridal.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
No, no, no, not Byron.

56:45.000 --> 56:54.000
Robert Malone and Steve Kersch did.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
Such that it seemed like they were almost intentionally designed

56:58.000 --> 57:04.000
to show a lack of efficacy for Ivermectin.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
And this shocked me when I saw that.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
And so when I ruled out the studies that I, that had fatal flaws,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
what was left was a very strong support for these things.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
That was one of the early indicators to me, sort of yellow flag.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
You know, what's going on here?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Why are these shots being pushed so hard?

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
Because as much as I love vaccines, I recognize what the rules were around this

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
and why we were fighting so hard against these treatments.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I really believe we could have done much better.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
And a lot of lives could have been saved had we implemented them and not,

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
and not stopped and encouraged preventing their implementation.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
And then one final comment, and I'm happy to go into any details in terms of

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
what exactly my concerns are with the COVID-19 shots.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
But what I have done, Sherri, is I've now gone back because a lot of people have

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
requested me to do so.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
And I've started looking at clinical trials with other shots.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
And I remember, you know, I know that people like RFK,

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
the junior, for example, have expressed concerns about these.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I never looked into it in any detail.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
And when I started looking in detail at some of these historical clinical studies

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
for these shots, I was aghast at how many of them had poor designs,

58:18.000 --> 58:26.000
improper control groups implemented, and so on, such that I would contend

58:26.000 --> 58:34.000
that Big Pharma has sort of ruined how clinical vaccinology is practiced.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
And it really concerns me.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
So I'll defend the theoretical concept of ideal vaccine.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
And an ideal vaccine, by the way, our gold standard is to try and simulate

58:46.000 --> 58:53.000
and replicate a naturally acquired immunity against any kind of pathogen, right?

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
And so if clinical studies are done properly,

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
if the proper experimental designs and a long enough term assessment of the safety profile,

59:04.000 --> 59:12.000
and there's very transparent revealing of the data,

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
and a sufficient number of analyses being conducted,

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
and they all show that a particular vaccine is truly safe

59:21.000 --> 59:27.000
and truly effective such that the risk, there's never zero risk with any medical intervention.

59:27.000 --> 59:35.000
So such that at the end, I'm convinced that the benefits of that particular vaccine

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
outweigh the potential risks associated with the disease-for-given population,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
then I'll support it, no problem.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
And it will continue to do so.

59:43.000 --> 59:50.000
But it's clinical, practice clinical vaccinology, it needs to be fixed.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
And what a lot of people don't understand, Sherry, even though people have accused me over the past...

59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Does anyone know if he's always had this tick, this facial tick on the right side of his face?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Just curious.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
A few years, as a vaccinologist of being an anti-vaxxer,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
my colleagues don't seem to have realized I stood up and expressed my concerns early on

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
because I was trying to save the field of vaccinology.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I saw that we were headed towards a debacle with these COVID-19 shots,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and if that were the case, a lot of people in the public were going to lose trust

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
in the process, right?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The process, the regulators, and how these things are approved

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
and the research that's done to evaluate safety and effectiveness.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And I knew that this would drive vaccine hesitancy

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and not only against COVID-19 shots, but against any historical vaccines,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and potentially any future ones as well.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And lo and behold, what do we see happening throughout the world?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
We see massive concerns with ever-rising vaccine hesitancy.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And you know what I say to that?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I say anybody who has developed this vaccine hesitancy has had every right to do so

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
because our regulators and public health officials have shown over the past few years

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
that they cannot be trusted.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And the onus is now on them to regain trust,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and the only way I see that they can regain trust is by fixing how clinical

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
vaccinology is practiced.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Right.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Well, in full transparency, I'm one of those people who has zero trust

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I am a proponent of my backgrounds in holistic nutrition.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So I'm a believer that we were made by our creator beautifully

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
to actually fight disease,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
which I've come to believe is mostly poisoning,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
environmental toxicity and poisoning of the human, you know, of us,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I will just say.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And so I'm interested in a quick comment with what you just said there.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It's very important.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So you've nailed a very important thing, right?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You've demonstrated far more insight than the vast majority of our public

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
health officials and health regulators in that I agree with you 100%.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
It always seems to me, I always feel silly saying this,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
but unbelievably in this day and age,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
this is actually a profound statement.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And that is basically what you said, right?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Which is that our immune systems do work.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
They work naturally.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And they work without as historical patent law,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
which you kind of would often use the term hand of man intervention,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
right, can lead to modifications to something that can then make it

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
worth conferring a patent.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So I like to say that our immune system can't function without the

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
hand of man manipulation.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And we call it naturally acquired immunity.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And for some reason, everybody threw that concept right out the window

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and that is something that I fought very heavily for.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Because I experienced that.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I don't know when because I didn't get particularly sick,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
but I got tested and I had evidence of very robust,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
broad-based, naturally acquired immunity.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And so I went to my, you know, I wasn't allowed to go to my

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
university because I didn't get the shots.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And I was aghast.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm like, you do understand that the intent behind a vaccine is to

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
induce an immune response where we attempt, we try to simulate a

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
naturally acquired immune response.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
That's the gold standard.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And we virtually never reach that gold standard.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So I've got that gold standard.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And you do realize, right, I tried saying to these administrators at

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
my university, when you get, like you have a piece of paper showing

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
somebody certified, two needles going into your shoulder.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But we know there's such a thing as low responders and non-responders.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So somebody could be carrying around that certificate,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
that piece of paper, right?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And for all we know, they could be a non-responder.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So they haven't mounted an immune response whatsoever against SARS

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
coronavirus, too.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But you or I could be holding up a piece of paper showing are

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
naturally acquired immunity, for example.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But they were deemed safe and somebody like myself was not.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It's phenomenal.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So you've nailed it.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So I just want to point out that the faith doesn't seem to really

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
be in danger here.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
There is definitely SARS-CoV-2, the virus, and COVID-19,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
the disease, and people needed to be safe from it.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And people died from it.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And he doesn't seem to be at all aware of the protocol changes

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
that were made, especially in the United States, that were,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that allowed the numbers to be conflated.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So he also hasn't touched the PCR yet.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And so again, the faith is not necessarily in danger here.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But if I can cut by some slack, there's no way in hell he was ever

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
going to be where we are now, given where he was in 2020 and how

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
he was treated since then.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
He's probably faced more pressure than practically anyone else,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
except for maybe Peter McCullough, Pierre Corey, maybe few people

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
had their head that high that early.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You know, Knutwitskowski did, but he disappeared.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Wolfgang Wodock spoke out early.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
He disappeared.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Some people got hammered and, and by room got hammered.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So he pretty much just had to find a handhold on the ship and hold

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
on for dear life where he was going overboard.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
So the idea that he would already be up in the crow's nest going,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
no, no, Lando, you know, whatever.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I mean, come on.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
That's not possible.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So I don't, I'm not critiquing him at all, but he hasn't gotten to the

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
stage where he's been able to see, he's in Canada though.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So, you know, Denny's up there.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
You know, there's hope.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I mean, I think he's obviously a guy who could get there because he's,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
he's still on the awakening path is his reality is definitely shaken.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And the other thing is I totally agree.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Nutrition is very important for the immune system.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And I won't go into details, but you know, classic examples,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
vitamin D, which remarkably was declared as fake science by our formal

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Federal Minister of Health, Patty Hadd.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But it is easy to declare vitamin D a fake science because of the way

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
that vitamin D metabolism works in your body.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You can't just take extra vitamin D and it all goes in and everything is fine.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
You know, like you're missing some oil.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So you just add some to your car, put the dipstick back in and check to make

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
sure it's good and now you're good.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
That's not how vitamin D works in your body.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Even though it is portrayed that way because you can buy vitamin D in a bottle.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And now I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I can tell you all the

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
pharmacokinetics of vitamin D off of my cuff here.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But I will tell you that it isn't as simple as you're low on vitamin D.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
You should take some more.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And here's the pill.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It is a very complex hormone, basically.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And the natural way that you acquire and modulate DNA or DNA vitamin D is

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
it's important that that system be properly engaged in any way that you try

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
to bypass that system or to augment it with supplementation does not necessarily

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
have the guaranteed outcome of just elevation of activated vitamin D.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
That's what you should know.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I hope I've said that well enough.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Drew, that is ludicrous.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I can tell you, so I'm doing research in this area right now Sherry.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And I can tell you the average Canadian is well below the ideal circulating

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
concentrations of vitamin D.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
At vitamin D very quickly, it's such a critical cog in how the immune system

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
works.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I like to use the analogy of a racing car.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
So our body.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
T cells, T cells basically don't work without vitamin D.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I mean, you could just say that.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's like a racing car.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
The immune system is like the engine.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And if you don't have vitamin D, it's like you have a.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I wonder if you've watched that rumble with false pandemics with Dr.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Meryl Nast and Dr. Wolfgang Lodock because I've watched it.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And I'm.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I would go so far as to say I should almost do a study hall now that you've

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000
dropped it in there because because it is a very, very obvious video when you

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
watch it with with the right eyes.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
What's going on?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Let me just put it in my list.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I have a running list here of of for study hall candidates.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I'll just add it in as long as you dropped it in.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I'm going to add it in right now.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And I will hit save and then I will get back to this.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Sorry.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
A cylinder misfiring in that engine, right?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So you don't need to be a genius to know if you take that car to the starting

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
line of a race and a cylinder is misfiring, it is not going to be performing

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
optimally.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And so I agree, not only vitamin D, but all the other critical nutritional

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
components that our immune system relies upon.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
If we are at all deficient in those, our immune system is not functionally

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
optimally.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And if we focused in this country on optimizing the concentration of all

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
these important metabolites that our immune system.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
No one, no one, and I know that I've not mentioned this enough.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
But no one.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I mean, no one.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And he should be saying it.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
He works at a veterinary college.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But I know for a fact that I've had several different veterinarians,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000
several different ranchers, several different people insist that

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
giggle and biological needs to regularly say the word selenium.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Because livestock are supplemented with selenium because they know if they

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
don't, they'll get sick.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
They'll get infections.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Their immune system won't be worth garbage.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And selenium is these trade, one of these trace minerals that's getting

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
harder to harder to find in your vegetable aisle.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Selenium.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000
To all of my viewers that have ever sent me a selenium link.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Including Eddie in, in, in Canada and many others.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Thank you for doing it.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm sorry.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I haven't mentioned it more.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Vitamin D is really important.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I think a lot of these trace minerals, especially selenium and a couple

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
others, are also absolutely crucial.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
But then you can't just tell people, you know, go ahead and eat, eat

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Wendy's and Burger King and box cereal in the morning and then just

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
supplement your selenium and vitamin D and you'll be fine.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And I really think that that's the temptation here.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Certainly in America.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And I know he's not really saying that, but that's the message that

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
ends up coming out.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And the first and foremost, the message should be you eat like

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
garbage and you don't exercise.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You got two big problems you need to fix.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And how you can monitor whether or not your change in diet and

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
exercise is having a legitimate effect on you as to maybe look to

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000
see if you're getting enough selenium and vitamin D.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But we don't talk like that.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
We don't think like that.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
We don't coach people like that.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
We just tell them to buy that bottle and that bottle and take two of

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
those and one of those every day and you'll be fine.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's the how to function properly.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
We would generally be a much healthier population.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Our health care costs would go down.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
We would suffer less from infectious diseases.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
There'd be fewer cancers and fewer chronic diseases.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So I agree with you a hundred percent.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Well, and when I work with clients, the first thing I do is not

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
work on nutrition.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I work on them to stop poisoning themselves.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So, you know, it's optimal nutrition.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's just part of how we were actually designed or evolved

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
whatever your belief system is.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But part of that is we have to stop poisoning ourselves.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So I want to actually kind of transition a bit to

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
translational oncology, cancer, your study in cancer.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I just want to briefly tell you a story.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
When COVID hit.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
In May, 2020, a friend reached out to me and she said,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
my sister-in-law is a doctor research scientist and on the

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
board of one of these pharma companies.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Producing what will be a vaccine that she's saying,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
we're all going to have to take to return to normal life.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And she said she wouldn't be taking it.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So I checked in a year later in May, 2021.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And she said she's waiting to find out whether she's going to be

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
fired because she knows that none of them went through proper

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
phase three trials and she knows as a scientist and doctor that if

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
she takes any one of them, the shots that are out in the market,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
it will bring back her cancer and kill her.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
So we, and when I started to share that, I was vilified, you know,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
just said that's, you know, BS, all that kind of stuff.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But we're now seeing, you know,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
being anecdotal, anecdotal.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I imagine.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So my anecdotal stuff going on.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000
My wife's sister, Femka, was in complete remission from ovarian

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
cancer at about 55 years old in the start of the pandemic.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And in 2020, she was vaccinated once and then right at the start

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
of 2021, she was vaccinated again.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And by the end of 2021, I believe she's had, she had three shots or

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
four and then was dead.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Now I could have the timeline slightly wrong, but I am absolutely

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
sure she had four shots.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And on the fourth one, I came back with a vengeance.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
She was gone.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I also know for sure that I had a friend who was forced to take it

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000
on the set of Hollywood Star Trek and got advanced brain

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
cancer probably from this stupid

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
transfection that she was forced to take to do what she loved to

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
do.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I know that my mother-in-law was forced to take the vaccine just

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
to see her husband who was forced to take the vaccine to be in

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
the hospital.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And then he died of a urinary tract infection.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Because there weren't enough people in the hospital to care for him.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And his wife was not able to go in.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
My mother-in-law was not able to go in there.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I guess he's my stepfather-in-law.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
The case died in the hospital too because people of the pandemic

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
were behaving like people of the pandemic.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I don't often share these things because, you know, everybody

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
lost people during the pandemic.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
But basically, my wife lost three because she knew my friend Annie

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
too.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I mean, these are all just people that did what they were told,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
did what they had to do.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
In the Netherlands, people are just, they just do it.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
They didn't call up and ask, you know, Jay, what should we do?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Because the narrative on television, because the illusion of consensus

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
on television, other countries, was even worse than here.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
In America, they knew they had to break us in half

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and get us to fight about this.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Because that's all that works to govern America.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
In the Netherlands, they didn't break anybody up.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
There was no need to break things up.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
They've got 15 different parties over there and they got a nice little

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000
consensus going and almost nobody went against it.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That happened in Norway too.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Most of the neuroscientists that I know in Norway just went along with

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
it and think that Jay is a nutcase now.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Colleagues of mine for years, who used to respect me.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
We are talking about a full global inversion of the way that people think

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
about the sovereignty they have over their bodies.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
A full global inversion of the way that people think about immunology.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Even if they never understood it in the first place, they're sure they understand it now.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And their understanding is based on whole cloth mythology.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I'm going to cut them off here because I don't know really where the best place to end is.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I don't know how many more stories they're going to tell.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They're going to go into the cancer, into the SV40 and all this other stuff.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I don't really think we need to do that right now.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I'll watch it again on my own.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And if it turns out to be something that I think you guys need to see,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
then I'll bring it back up.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
So that was Byron Bridal, one of the heroes of the pandemic.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Spoke out very early and likely needed to be controlled and it's likely that people were put in front of him

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and that people were queued onto the scene specifically to take the spotlight away from this whistleblower,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
who had found the document from Japan and started telling everybody the lipid nanoparticle is not going to stay where they said it was.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And that's a big problem.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And so then they decided to bring out Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and make a big deal about them

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
and start making them go viral instead of buy room.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And then buy room basically disappeared.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's how it works.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
The show must go on, ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And there is a spectacular commitment to lies that cannot be disrupted.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And that's what these people have been doing from the very beginning.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That's why Byron Bridal's never been on the podcast of Brett Weinstein.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Never been on Joe Rogan, but Robert Malone has.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Even though Byron Bridal's the guy who came out first, Byron Bridal's the whistleblower,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
but no, he hasn't been on any of these intellectual dark web shows at all.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Robert Malone's been on the Tommy podcast more times than Byron Bridal's been on any American podcast ever.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000
That should tell you all you need to know.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And so the narrative that we've been telling and the way that we're explaining this is that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus said to be detectable by a non specific PCR test for RNA viruses applied to a low prevalence population.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And intentionally correlated with poor or detrimental health protocols through financial incentives that enable the larger percentage of all cause mortality than normal P and I to be prioritized as a national security threat composed of vaccine preventable deaths.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And then there they could justify rolling out the vaccine with haste and lying about it.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
The US was ready with this plan to respond to a coronavirus pandemic and that plan is in motion today.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It is very possible that NIAID funded infectious RNA clone was used to see the pandemic around the world so that the molecular biology would be sound and that there would be a limited spread of an identifiable pathogen that would have an RNA signature that was predictable

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
that the natural coronavirus swarm cannot sustain that signal. That's the reason why I posit that an infectious clone may have been used to create it.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The reason why they would create a signal like that is to guarantee their justification for it can for inverting our individual sovereignty to basic granted permissions.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So one of the ways that they accomplish this the most important aspect of this is this lie about gain of function viruses in bat caves and in laboratories and on lab benches where they stitch pieces together.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The reason why this consensus is important because it is not only a consensus about the existence of gain of function but it is a consensus about what was the worst case scenario.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
If there is a consensus about what the worst case scenario was then there is a consensus that they just did what they thought was right.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
They did what they had to do given the consensus worst case scenario.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And that justifies the behavior of people that were wittingly and unwittingly involved in the narrative control and the seeding of the Scooby-Doo.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:33.000
If you have to lie to these people or this whole worst case scenario could possibly come true.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And again that's why these people are all involved and I have been naive enough not to know that even Huberman is a member of this group and is sponsored by the people they are sponsored by but I just didn't see it.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:01.000
They created this illusion of consensus and it is illusion of consensus that was also created because they had this graph down here as the one they showed on TV and they did not teach you the all cause mortality which is in the light blue.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
They use this graph on PBS NewsHour and they only showed you the red.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that graph is the graph that corresponds to the faith that there was a novel virus that millions died and were saved gain a function is real and a virus will come again.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And so again on television they told you that the mystery virus was causing all the excess deaths and they told you the excess deaths were the red curve down here.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And in reality you needed to look at this curve and then try to subtract all the things that we knew were odd but not the virus.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And if we had done that accurately from the very beginning we would have subtracted many do not resuscitate orders we would have subtracted many poorly ventilated people.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:04.000
People that didn't receive antibiotics, people that didn't get steroids when they needed people that were put on remdesivir, people that died of opioid deaths and all the death certificate fraud that took place because of the financial incentives in place.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So this conversion of all cause mortality to a national security priority was done using these bad ideas and then called a mystery virus.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And the way that you avoid this math being done is that you do not talk about PCR fraud you do not talk about lateral flow test frauds and lateral flow test being made in China and shipped all around the world to track the pandemic everywhere but in China.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You don't talk about the variances and the sequences you don't talk about RNA infectious clones you don't talk about the quasi species genetics or incompetent fractions like biorom bridal might.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000
You don't talk about RNA fidelity limits and you don't talk about homology between coronavirus proteins.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You just talk about the faith that there was a novel virus that millions have died and millions were saved.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Getting a function is real and a virus will come again. That's the only thing you talk about and you don't avoid testing it by not doing the math.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That's it. It's really simple.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:26.000
It's an illusion of consensus.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So let's just break it out as best we can. I'm going to get rid of that spinning G.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So a transfection in its purest form is wholly inappropriate for healthy humans. That's the first place to start.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Upscaling from nanograms to kilograms was predicted to be a source of huge problems in 2020.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And we even made fun of rants and yellow about it because he was joking about it on one of his Twitter streams.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Sorry, Twib streams where he was talking to all those brilliant retired virologists.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And he thought, wow, isn't it cool how they went from nanograms to kilograms? That's just amazing.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:20.000
RNA was impure. That means impure antigens are produced. It means shortened antigens are produced, which is a whole bunch of unknown effects.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The RNA was codon optimized, which means that it could go through the ribosome in an unpredictable way, which would result in misfolding.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Misfolding could be amyloid, could be prion. I don't know.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000
It could also just be a misfolded spike protein that misrepresents epitopes that would be relevant for the virus or for anything,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
but they're not relevant for anything if they're misfolded.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:52.000
The mRNA was chemically altered, meaning that the uracils were replaced with n-methyl-sudo-uridine.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
This causes premature stop codons. It can also cause wobble-based substitutions.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000
The premature stop codons can result in very short RNA sequences, which can be interfering RNA.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000
They can also interfere with microRNAs, which are still a very poorly understood signal in the cell, but definitely a physiologically relevant one.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Making short RNAs is also not a great thing.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:29.000
If the chemically altered RNAs are also interacting with endogenous RNAs and causing those to break or interacting with them and causing those to be regulated differently,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that could also be a whole bunch of other things that we don't understand as possible coming from just that one number five.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:47.000
The protein produced, therefore, because of 3, 4, and 5, is uncharacterized and highly variable with all sorts of unknown consequences,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000
because it's misfolded, because it could be shortened, because it has all of this, actually from 1 through 5.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
The LNP was never tested in humans for long and short-term effects.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It's not that I think the LNP is necessarily going to be a source of extra disaster, but it's definitely possible that it's also poisonous, right?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's just pretty small dose of LNP. I'm not really worried about LNP as much as I'm worried about the RNA and its expression.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Endotoxins from process 2 are highly immunogenic. Those are particles, anything, proteins, nucleotides, anything from remnants of the bacterial culture that isn't adequately removed by quality control

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000
are going to be immunogenic and are not going to be desired immune responses, very toxic.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And then finally, if there are double-stranded DNA fragments from process 2, these could also be, in theory, a problem.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:03.000
One caveat here is that if those small DNA fragments go into a cell that's not really dividing and not really growing,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.000
it's not really clear the likelihood of it getting to the nucleus, and if it got to the nucleus, it's not really clear

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.000
whether anything would be expressed, and if it integrated, it's not really clear. If it went into a somatic cell that wasn't dividing and didn't plan to divide,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000
it's not really clear what would happen. And again, remember that this assumes that it gets there

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.000
and that it's fine and that there aren't a million different enzymes that just get rid of it

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
because we are surrounded by RNA and DNA all the time.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:51.000
So, it's also very tricky to gauge what's going on here if you focus on number 9 and start running around with your hair on fire because of number 9.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And I want it to be very clear that that's the point I'm trying to make here.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
There's no reason to run around with your hair on fire. I'm trying to get out of it. That's weird how that works.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:11.000
There's no reason to run around with your hair on fire just because of number 9. Just remember that.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And so there was a novel virus, millions died, gained a function, and a virus will come again as the illusion of consensus we are trying to break.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And that illusion of consensus extends from 2019 forward about this novel virus that's spread around the world and changed to different variants

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and, you know, lockdowns killed some people, but man, oh man, this virus was bad.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:43.000
This illusion of consensus needs to be broken so that our children are not permanently misled into believing that, you know, we didn't know anything and all this illusion,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
this immunomethology is real.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:30:00.000
We need them to understand the history of the last three years, to understand that people were coerced, lied to, and bamboozled into behaving this dumb.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Doctors were bamboozled and terrified into behaving this dumb. They were threatened to behave this dumb.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And there were people that, despite all of that, still were able to stand up.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Those are our leaders. Those are the people we should be looking to for guidance in the future.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And so, yes, let's break the illusion of consensus of this laboratory leak by starting to explain to people that it was likely a conflated background signal that this faith is a lie.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
We've gotten fooled into spending so much of our mental energy on this question.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:57.000
When in reality, it could have been an endemic background that they just told us something about as if it was never there to begin with and started testing for it and said the testing was evidence of a pandemic.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The protocols were murder. That's for sure. And transfection is not medicine.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I do think that there is a pretty reasonable chance that an infectious clone was used to seed the pandemic to make sure that there was no doubt when Sohomish County man was sequenced.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
There was no doubt that they were going to get the sequence to match the one in Wuhan.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And there was no doubt that if doctors in Iran sequenced some of their severe patients that they would get a culturable virus and it too would sequence positive for the Wuhan strain, that trick, which is a molecular biologically genius trick, could be done with very little cost

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and very little magic by using infectious clones.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And once you understand that, then you understand it's not a crazy idea, it's more of an obvious plan.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And you can call it a transfection agent because that's what it is.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:07.000
They transfected people with an infectious clone so that they express this RNA and when they looked for it, they could find it and that there would be enough there to sequence.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And the only way that would work or they would be almost guaranteed to get the right sequence is a clone because a natural virus would give you a consensus sequence which would almost certainly be different from patient to patient, but not if they were all infected with the same clone.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And that's what this trick was all about. The no-virus people from the very beginning, actually Andy Kaufman had it pretty right, he was talking about exosomes and talking about viruses not having the fidelity that virology claimed they had.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And then at some point it turned all around and it was about isolation and it was about purity and it was about very specific experiments and very specific papers and he didn't want to talk to anybody that wouldn't accept their premises first.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And so they made no friends, they made no connections, they made no network, and instead they isolated themselves under the pretense that they were the ones who had the truth.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And if you didn't want to accept the truth, then they didn't want to talk to you. And that's the game they're still playing today.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The faith is a lie and you can tell these players because they stop talking about the PCR fraud, they've stopped talking about all the variant fraud, all the death certificate fraud, the RNA purity fraud, the protein folding, the

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:42.000
transfection in general, and natural immunity. The no-virus people actually don't talk about natural immunity either because the no-virus people don't think that the immune system responds to pathogens.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a time point where human diversity is at its peak for the next 30 years.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And so there is a concerted effort by the people that rule us to invert the way we think about our sovereignty and more importantly, they want to invert the way that your children think about their sovereignty because they don't need ours.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It's too late for us. They need our kids, kids. And I can't stress enough how this is a game of generations and it is a game for all the marbles.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So if you want to win, you got to learn the biology. One of the best ways to learn the biology is try to understand this statement backwards and forwards.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Intermuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Transfection is not immunization, ladies and gentlemen. Please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary. Thanks for any means.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'm going to see you guys again tomorrow night. My voice feels pretty good, so I guess I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Thank you guys for being here.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Vilma, good to see you. You haven't been here in a while. Pamela, always, always a pleasure.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I'm really happy you're here, Albert. Good to see you.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Diana Dezik, Jeff from Earth. As always, don't forget to follow Jeff from Earth's Instagram.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Pam, good to see you here. Left hand, monkey wrench.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000
We did miss Moderna tonight, or we did end up showing up. I don't know if he was here tonight or not.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Think all just good to see you, man. Jan and Reno, yo, yo, yo, what up?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I'm glad you appreciate the screen, man. I'm really happy. Please share my work. Thank you very much. There he is.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Moderna is here. All right, guys. Thanks very much. I will see you tomorrow.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Bye.
