WEBVTT

00:09.849 --> 00:12.570
Run into the tunnel.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.192
You have to go as fast as you can.

00:19.913 --> 00:21.474
You can trust me.

00:21.994 --> 00:24.635
It's real.

00:25.035 --> 00:27.416
It's real.

00:27.536 --> 00:29.417
Full speed, Kevin.

00:31.237 --> 00:32.418
Into the wall.

00:33.258 --> 00:34.179
The tunnel, I mean.

00:44.743 --> 00:46.365
Six years back, I asked one question.

00:46.385 --> 00:47.666
I never got an answer from anyone.

00:47.746 --> 00:49.728
Do you know anyone that died from COVID?

00:50.388 --> 00:53.871
It's the fog of antibodies war, the procrastination of the fall of the dollar.

00:54.232 --> 00:55.073
You're getting fuked up.

00:55.173 --> 00:58.316
I don't know what that means, dude.

00:58.896 --> 01:02.099
From where I'm sitting, there's a whole bunch of COVID brain going around.

01:03.251 --> 01:05.472
Do I know anyone that died from a heart attack?

01:05.512 --> 01:09.214
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:09.254 --> 01:13.936
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:14.056 --> 01:20.138
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:32.394 --> 01:43.947
Happy birthday to you.

01:47.751 --> 01:50.554
Happy birthday to you.

01:59.742 --> 02:01.804
Happy birthday to you.

02:01.884 --> 02:05.487
Happy birthday to you.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.955
Hey, what the hell is G-code?

02:35.995 --> 02:37.416
I don't know what G-code is.

02:37.516 --> 02:39.598
Can somebody explain what G-code is?

02:40.138 --> 02:43.240
I just have that up there, like, to represent the collecting of genomes.

02:43.420 --> 02:44.401
I don't know what G-code is.

03:01.244 --> 03:06.771
Oh, so they're just 3D coordinates.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.593
That's kind of cool.

03:07.853 --> 03:08.554
I didn't know that.

03:08.634 --> 03:09.836
Well, nice.

03:26.556 --> 03:32.199
So can you just see the mill head moving around in 3D space when that goes by?

03:32.259 --> 03:38.522
Like you just can't stop visualizing the... All the liquid being shot and whatever.

03:59.192 --> 04:01.534
Hey, happy birthday, Cheryl.

04:01.554 --> 04:04.556
Just wanted to say that from Pittsburgh to you.

04:04.636 --> 04:05.457
Happy birthday.

04:05.517 --> 04:07.578
Thanks for taking care of my really good friend.

04:07.598 --> 04:11.301
Yeah, CNC is really cool actually.

04:11.321 --> 04:23.510
You know, I met a guy in college who was gonna be a mold maker because in the nineties, the way we made all the stuff we throw away was with molds and mold makers and selling molds and stuff.

04:23.550 --> 04:27.573
Apparently like the mold for toys and stuff like that is a really valuable piece of,

04:28.494 --> 04:48.978
of steel and so anyway uh welcome to the show everybody happy birthday Cheryl um i i don't know where my levels are i can't really hear very well i gotta turn that up a little bit there we go i can hear it better now um let me see what was i gonna do for an opening i think i was just gonna go for a flash

04:51.351 --> 04:52.832
Yes, that's correct.

04:52.892 --> 04:53.953
Good morning, everybody.

04:53.993 --> 04:54.833
Welcome to the show.

04:54.873 --> 04:57.014
What a long, strange trip it's been.

04:57.094 --> 04:58.795
One of my friends is at HHS.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.576
One of my friends is at NIH.

05:01.657 --> 05:09.602
And a bunch of my colleagues and people that have messed with my family are actually behind them, which is really remarkable.

05:10.142 --> 05:16.365
I managed to take a selfie with a lot of these creeps because they were trying to absorb me for many years.

05:16.406 --> 05:18.026
That's how I got so close to them.

05:18.066 --> 05:20.248
That's why they're so happy in some of these pictures.

05:20.848 --> 05:38.405
because some of them are actually unwitting participants in this fake anti-vaxx movement, this fake health freedom movement that has been set up by the DNC to make Trump look like some kind of real guy, when in reality it's just all one big theater and these actors were put in place

05:39.005 --> 05:55.476
to curate a narrative to make sure any damage from transfection that's the covid vaccine that they would never call what it's supposed to be called was a transfection that the damage from that could be blamed effectively on the novel virus that's one of the reasons why all of these people

05:56.918 --> 05:59.720
were dancing around the spike protein for so long.

05:59.760 --> 06:05.425
Jessica Rose, Kevin McCairn, Richard Fleming, all these clowns.

06:06.026 --> 06:08.488
It was one big bad theater.

06:09.108 --> 06:14.993
One of the best ways to see this ridiculous theater is to pay attention to the guy in the upper right.

06:15.054 --> 06:16.955
He's got a wonderful podcast.

06:17.736 --> 06:23.221
He spends his time giving the mic to the most important patriots in America, including

06:23.821 --> 06:39.912
the 5 post-secondary degree having Jessica Rose, and the wizard of the Human Genome Project himself, Kevin McKernan, who I am declaring as one of the biggest traitors in American history, at least in the American history that I've lived through.

06:39.932 --> 06:45.036
And I will spend the rest of my life trying to explain why that's correct.

06:46.703 --> 06:52.245
I think you can find a lot of really good information at houstatonicits.com.

06:52.406 --> 06:59.629
That is one of the best sort of conglomerations of an archive that there exists on the internet.

06:59.669 --> 07:09.333
Anybody that's ignoring that and instead pushing Whitney Webb's books or, I don't know, some story about a guy

07:10.666 --> 07:13.888
A guy with mice in his basement needs some help.

07:13.948 --> 07:15.769
I'm gonna try and get Ned to make a book with me.

07:16.729 --> 07:18.210
And really it is them.

07:18.410 --> 07:23.333
They created the illusion of consensus by sticking to that limited spectrum of debate.

07:23.413 --> 07:24.693
They being these guys.

07:25.614 --> 07:28.415
These are some of the primary problems in America right now.

07:28.455 --> 07:32.017
It's all one spectacular commitment to lies.

07:32.538 --> 07:34.218
That's really how they do it.

07:34.259 --> 07:34.899
Maybe I should just...

07:36.741 --> 07:38.042
Drop in another thing here.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.324
It's a spectacular commitment to lies.

07:40.384 --> 07:43.807
The lies about antibodies and how they block the spike protein.

07:44.308 --> 07:55.078
Lies about a transfection and how the transfection, if it's injected in the right place, will spit a bunch of RNA out and that RNA will find its way to a dendritic cell.

07:55.618 --> 08:18.051
and the dendritic cell will pick up the mRNA and know exactly what to do with it you know because that's what dendritic cells do they follow uh lipid nanoparticle cased RNA instructions um and and and so here's a cartoon showing you that and it's absurd because of course the real reason why we are here is because gain of function

08:19.011 --> 08:26.976
and virology and public health crises are a mythology that they still need us to teach to our children.

08:27.176 --> 08:33.060
They still need us to accept this mythology and to pass it on to our children.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.482
Otherwise, their whole trap won't work.

08:37.463 --> 08:39.304
It's a multi-generational trap.

08:39.864 --> 08:46.609
And these people were put in place to make sure our kids, our kids would accept a narrative about a novel virus

08:47.665 --> 08:57.212
and that any damage from the last five years is a human folly, mistakes made, but not the transfection.

08:57.893 --> 09:08.681
In fact, the goal that these people have is to make transfection a replacement for what will soon be declared a not-so-perfect vaccine schedule.

09:09.542 --> 09:10.563
And they will admit this.

09:10.764 --> 09:12.205
They are going to admit this.

09:12.245 --> 09:13.286
That's part of the plan.

09:14.248 --> 09:15.509
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

09:15.529 --> 09:19.654
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:19.734 --> 09:20.535
It's the 6th of May, 2025.

09:20.575 --> 09:22.077
May Pym Fortayin rest in peace.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.801
RNA cannot pandemic.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.482
Intramuscular injections are dumb.

09:28.522 --> 09:29.722
Transfection is a crime.

09:30.183 --> 09:34.205
And the population pyramid is a real problem that they are managing right now.

09:34.625 --> 09:38.627
If you want to support this stream, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do it.

09:39.367 --> 09:45.550
If you want to be notified by my wife before this stuff goes on, please send an email to GigaOMHQ at proton.me.

09:46.050 --> 09:51.073
And you should get a notification around an hour, a half an hour, or 15 minutes before I go on.

09:51.913 --> 09:56.659
And if you want to share this stuff, please go to stream.gigaohm.bio and do it there.

09:56.679 --> 10:02.926
If you want to communicate with me, of course, hit me by email or go to gigaohm.bio and communicate with all of us.

10:03.967 --> 10:05.869
Those last two links there.

10:07.003 --> 10:24.759
um these last two links right there are our own social media it's decentralized federalized social media those are github available codes that you you too could make your own soapbox you too can make your own um

10:25.379 --> 10:51.949
Peertube instance and that Peertube instance will be followable on an app like Mastodon or something like that And I thought I would show that to you because I don't know if people are aware of that And so I'm gonna pull my phone down now and just take the risk that that cameras on and it's of course It's not because I'm charging my headphones Plug this in I apologize For the seemingly

10:53.349 --> 11:19.408
Amateur hour here, but I don't have a crew so you know when I do this stuff I got to fire up this one-man band all by myself and sometimes I forget to turn on the GoPro Okay, so you have a phone like I have a phone you might not have pretty kids on the front like I do But I do want you to see that there is this app and if you see it right there this app right there It's called Mastodon and Mastodon is just kind of like

11:21.365 --> 11:24.846
It's just kind of like Twitter or something like that.

11:24.946 --> 11:29.027
It's just the difference is you have to figure out what you're following.

11:29.107 --> 11:32.128
So you can be on any server in the universe.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.369
And this music is going to fade even farther away.

11:36.489 --> 11:39.130
I apologize for not being such a great DJ there.

11:40.251 --> 11:40.851
Let me test this.

11:43.274 --> 11:51.003
But what you can do, of course, once you realize how the following is going, that you'll get a notification whenever I go live because it'll just pop up in here.

11:51.063 --> 11:55.549
Now, I don't see it at the moment, so I guess, you know, it's a little slow.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.753
You'll get a link though, and this link will be to the latest show.

11:59.373 --> 12:01.794
Now it's not going to be perfect because I don't maintain that.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.856
It just sends you the same picture all the time and it tells you when it's live.

12:06.316 --> 12:07.677
But that link is the right link.

12:07.897 --> 12:09.798
So even though it's going to give you that, right?

12:09.878 --> 12:15.000
It's always the same thumbnail because PeerTube is kind of a weird thing that I haven't played around with too much.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.462
I change the thumbnail after I present.

12:18.062 --> 12:20.363
And sometimes I don't do it until the next morning like today.

12:21.183 --> 12:22.724
Um, so let me just, yeah.

12:23.385 --> 12:43.339
Um, so, uh, with regard to how to follow on the soapbox, how to follow, you can follow the peer tube instance, and you can also follow this, the soapbox instance, all by following those at, you know, giga ohm, whatever, whatever, or in the case of me on, on, um,

12:44.932 --> 12:46.114
So that's that one right there.

12:46.194 --> 12:46.874
See that?

12:47.155 --> 12:48.837
That's me on the soapbox.

12:49.297 --> 12:51.280
At JJCooey at GigaOM.bio.

12:51.720 --> 12:59.189
And so if you follow that on Mastodon from a server in Austria, it might be a little slow, but you'll eventually get the stuff that I put there.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.711
And it's not perfect.

13:00.831 --> 13:01.953
I know it's not perfect.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.296
But you can...

13:05.575 --> 13:06.896
you know, load things like this.

13:06.936 --> 13:10.297
When you load me, then it'll go there and it'll find all the things that I did.

13:10.337 --> 13:17.501
So it's, again, we can make this as beautiful and as free as we want.

13:17.621 --> 13:20.622
It's just a question of how many people are willing to invest in it.

13:20.662 --> 13:21.263
How many people

13:22.063 --> 13:38.997
are really genuinely interested in building a free internet, because if you resign to putting your stuff on Rumble, your stuff on YouTube, your stuff on BitChute, your stuff all over the place, that might work, but it always leaves you behind their programming.

13:39.697 --> 14:05.563
8-ball and more importantly it leaves our followers in the lurch because if you're on YouTube and you watch me and over here on this side are the most tempting thumbnails that the YouTube algorithm can put there based on your previous viewing then the odds of one little dead space getting a click one little oh I don't like this guy getting a click is very very high

14:06.365 --> 14:16.149
And more importantly, them finding me again on the same platform is almost zero, of course, because now the algorithm is scoring me as, oh, you don't really like him.

14:17.230 --> 14:34.077
And so you've got to see, we will never escape this trap, and more importantly, our children will never escape this trap, if we allow our children to grow up and to build their adult world network on these platforms.

14:35.151 --> 14:38.674
So I'm trying to think in longer time horizons, and this is the thing that I see.

14:38.774 --> 14:44.199
I need to encourage my kids to build their own peer tubes and to link them together.

14:45.140 --> 14:54.288
I need to encourage high schools to build their own peer tube and then link them together with other high schools, which will also show their students

14:55.074 --> 15:07.421
that representing the school on YouTube is fine, but we can also have our own instance that our own IT department can take care of, that our students can manage and learn programming while following the GitHub.

15:09.862 --> 15:21.308
We must take back control of this medium, which at its start was free, and now because we've acquiesced to using their platforms, their social media, we will never escape.

15:21.748 --> 15:22.729
It's impossible.

15:23.936 --> 15:24.616
That's the trick.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.197
I really think we've got to do it.

15:26.237 --> 15:29.399
That's why GigaOM is doing it in both ways.

15:29.439 --> 15:31.040
And that's why we're going to continue to do it.

15:31.080 --> 15:39.964
And at some point, some of our stuff on our streams are only going to be available here for the simple statement that, you know, this is what we're paying for.

15:39.984 --> 15:41.545
This is why we're paying for it.

15:42.045 --> 15:46.267
Because we don't want people to be going to YouTube to find us.

15:46.307 --> 15:47.848
We don't want people to go to Twitch.

15:50.037 --> 16:02.162
As good as Twitch has been for me, because I can do whatever I want there, Twitch is a absolutely awful place to bring your kids for what exists there, for what people do for streaming there.

16:02.603 --> 16:11.346
It's really not what we want our children to be spending their time on, but it is a place where I can stream a live stream, and so I do.

16:12.167 --> 16:12.907
Welcome to the show.

16:14.068 --> 16:15.348
What the hell was that?

16:16.649 --> 16:18.229
I don't know what happened there.

16:18.269 --> 16:18.990
Hold on one second.

16:20.694 --> 16:23.776
There is an auto transition that we do not want.

16:25.097 --> 16:29.561
Okay, so what we've got here... Hello, hello, hello.

16:29.641 --> 16:30.161
What you doing?

16:30.622 --> 16:31.543
Did I not put it in yet?

16:32.403 --> 16:33.424
Oh, I didn't put it in yet.

16:33.504 --> 16:34.024
Oh, great.

16:34.085 --> 16:35.125
So I got to insert this.

16:35.185 --> 16:36.326
Hold on one second.

16:36.446 --> 16:37.968
Still making slide deck.

16:39.489 --> 16:40.730
That's why it moved so quick.

16:42.171 --> 16:42.491
Let's see.

16:42.511 --> 16:43.812
Would that be in the 4k?

16:45.093 --> 16:46.494
No, it's back there.

16:46.754 --> 16:47.675
Yeah, that's where I was.

16:48.856 --> 16:49.116
Come up.

16:49.717 --> 16:49.917
That one.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.661
Send playback automatically.

16:54.001 --> 16:54.601
Format.

16:55.602 --> 16:56.562
Send to the back.

16:58.103 --> 16:58.924
Slideshow.

16:59.144 --> 16:59.804
Current slide.

17:00.585 --> 17:01.646
Welcome to the show, everybody.

17:02.046 --> 17:03.307
This is Giga Home Biological.

17:03.367 --> 17:11.511
I want to start with a video from 2007 to remind you of the connections that, to remind you of the connections that, that

17:14.591 --> 17:19.814
Jeffrey Sachs has to people like Peter Hotez to the UN for how long?

17:19.834 --> 17:22.316
The 21st century is to improve global health.

17:22.696 --> 17:30.581
Life expectancy is 78 years in the United States, but the average newborn will not make it to 40 in some of the world's poorest countries.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.782
There are many reasons for this disparity.

17:33.123 --> 17:37.126
Infectious diseases kill millions of people throughout the third world each year.

17:37.506 --> 17:43.010
Malaria claims up to 3 million lives every year and infects up to 650 million people.

17:43.551 --> 17:45.652
HIV-AIDS also kills 3 million every year.

17:46.073 --> 17:49.275
And 90 percent of these cases are in developing countries.

17:49.796 --> 17:56.281
Neglected tropical diseases like hookworm and yellow fever also cause an enormous burden that only the poorest have to bear.

17:56.841 --> 18:02.068
Many of the leading killers have been contained in first world countries and are easily treatable.

18:02.549 --> 18:06.575
The problem of global health is not only a matter of disease and medicine.

18:07.035 --> 18:11.641
Issues of poverty, infrastructure, and the environment are all inseparable.

18:12.122 --> 18:15.365
Fortunately, more funding than ever is being devoted to this fight.

18:15.866 --> 18:17.247
Some progress has been made.

18:17.668 --> 18:23.393
Vaccines and other technologies are being developed that could one day eliminate the worst diseases.

18:23.914 --> 18:30.761
Also, mortality of children under five has dipped below 10 million a year for the first time since a statistic

18:32.031 --> 18:33.133
So this is 2007.

18:33.533 --> 18:34.695
This is Charlie Rose.

18:34.735 --> 18:41.544
This is somebody that a lot of, let's say, older adults watched, mature adults watched, voting adults watched.

18:41.744 --> 18:46.310
And it was thought to be a very smart and insightful program.

18:47.231 --> 18:52.234
And it was one of the few ways where the narrative could be set and controlled.

18:52.314 --> 18:56.197
And so it was a very, very important TV show at the time.

18:56.637 --> 18:58.058
And in 2007, you can clearly hear it.

18:58.458 --> 19:06.263
They're talking about solving world hunger and they're talking about solving disease in the third world, primarily with vaccines.

19:06.443 --> 19:16.410
They're not gonna be talking about clean water and sanitation directly, you know, like toilets and proper water treatment and not getting poop in your mouth.

19:17.332 --> 19:20.553
These are all things that are so important.

19:22.213 --> 19:42.439
Understand that even in America, if you just started to regularly not wash your hands and regularly touch things and put them in your mouth, touch stuff and put it in your mouth, walk through the subway and put it in your mouth, go into the bathroom and touch everything and then put that hand into your mouth, eventually you would get something.

19:44.209 --> 19:50.334
You would have a stomach infection of some kind where your microbiome would be thrown off, where you'd get diarrhea.

19:51.235 --> 19:55.559
You could get any number of parasites, like Giardia.

19:57.821 --> 20:09.911
Understand that simply having reliable clean water, not having to make it, having reliable clean water in which to bathe and the soap to bathe with,

20:11.564 --> 20:16.868
having washing machines for our clothes, having toilets with water in them.

20:19.250 --> 20:24.374
This is a huge, huge advance from shitting in a bucket.

20:26.255 --> 20:35.142
And people don't really understand how technologically speaking, a water-filled toilet can keep poop out of your mouth.

20:39.045 --> 20:40.767
It's a remarkable thing.

20:41.937 --> 20:45.459
that the biology of this illusion is so very, very simple.

20:46.900 --> 20:58.608
And it is only a spectacular commitment to the lie, to the mythology, to the big story that has allowed this narrative to be given to us, that we grew up believing in this.

21:00.209 --> 21:01.610
That's how magical this is.

21:01.670 --> 21:07.934
And as easily as we were raised to believe it, we can raise our children to understand that lie.

21:08.902 --> 21:12.443
but it's gonna require a little history and a little biology and a little reading.

21:13.168 --> 21:14.069
has been recorded.

21:14.589 --> 21:18.252
But for now, large scale improvement remains theoretical.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.674
Joining me now are four experts in the field of global health.

21:22.295 --> 21:25.597
Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

21:25.957 --> 21:41.529
Until 2006, he was director of the United... So he's at Columbia University where Mary Holland is at the time, and Mary Holland will kind of sort of burn her faculty position at the University of Columbia to become the fake anti-vax queen of America.

21:43.988 --> 21:47.011
That's gonna happen about five years after this, right?

21:49.674 --> 21:52.917
Columbia, where his wife also works.

21:53.677 --> 21:56.620
His wife is named Sonia Ehrlich and she is the most...

21:57.591 --> 22:00.613
frequent author of a guy by the name of Peter Hotez.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.873
I don't know if you know who that is.

22:01.913 --> 22:03.194
The Nation's Millennium Project.

22:03.454 --> 22:08.357
Tanya Villafana is the director of the Portfolio Management System at the Malaria Vaccine Initiative.

22:08.737 --> 22:13.180
Her organization recently announced a successful trial vaccine for malaria.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.441
And Veneman is the executive director of UNICEF.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.703
Peter Hotez is the president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute.

22:19.083 --> 22:22.065
He is an expert on neglected tropical diseases.

22:22.525 --> 22:25.627
And once again, my co- And the father of an autistic child.

22:28.502 --> 22:29.862
Our host is Sir Paul Nurse.

22:30.222 --> 22:35.644
He is a 2001 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and the President of Rockefeller University.

22:36.644 --> 22:51.208
The President of Rockefeller University used to be Joshua Lederberg, a wonderful book with an interesting title, Genes, Germs, and Medicine, The Life of Joshua Lederberg by Jan Sopp.

22:51.608 --> 22:53.908
See if you can find this book in your local library.

22:53.948 --> 22:54.689
I've been reading this.

22:54.729 --> 22:55.849
This is magnificent.

22:57.130 --> 23:01.212
Get ready, ladies and gentlemen, by new biology 101 ain't screwing around.

23:03.212 --> 23:05.393
I used to have all of them here for this conversation.

23:05.713 --> 23:07.214
Let me just start with this issue.

23:07.594 --> 23:12.096
I mean, what is the state today of global health and how do we measure?

23:12.156 --> 23:22.960
So Paul nurse is from the UK working with Jeffrey Sachs to lay down a narrative about public health that can be used 10 years later to destroy America.

23:24.827 --> 23:48.346
And the plan is to put a few people in the government that will be privy to this plan and understand exactly how America would need to be undermined using public health, discrediting the FDA through 10 years of corruption, and then putting a guy in there who's connected to the foundation of the FDA by his father.

23:49.349 --> 23:52.851
That plan to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:53.091 --> 24:00.074
as close to the White House or in the White House as possible is gonna be laid out in a book just one year after this video.

24:00.134 --> 24:07.518
A book titled, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me by Jesse Ventura, published by Skyhorse Publishing.

24:07.998 --> 24:14.521
In the epilogue of this book, Bobby Kennedy as an independent presidential candidate ends up helping Jesse Ventura win.

24:14.941 --> 24:16.882
And then Jesse Ventura gets shot

24:18.496 --> 24:21.736
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I guess, becomes president and saves the world.

24:25.834 --> 24:30.675
It'd be really weird, right, if Jeffrey Sachs was like a good buddy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:30.715 --> 24:46.279
and also was like the head of the Lancet Commission for COVID and also kind of talked with Peter Daszak and all these people and believes that they're real and also like is a good buddy of all the people at the UN and is the most frequent speaker at the Vatican.

24:46.639 --> 24:50.100
That would be super weird if it was 2007 when he's on with some UK guy

24:53.662 --> 24:56.977
talking about the same thing on charlie rose when

25:02.333 --> 25:06.575
You know, Charlie, this is a very interesting problem because it's so multifaceted.

25:07.315 --> 25:08.716
It's, of course, a medical problem.

25:08.936 --> 25:14.198
We have these major diseases you just listed, malaria, TB, AIDS, for example.

25:14.838 --> 25:17.799
We have some idea of how we may treat them.

25:18.519 --> 25:21.040
But we know that there's new ways we can develop.

25:21.260 --> 25:23.221
So part of this is a scientific problem.

25:23.241 --> 25:24.381
Part of it's a medical problem.

25:24.641 --> 25:26.482
So we could clean up the water.

25:26.602 --> 25:28.183
We could give them toilets.

25:29.699 --> 25:46.105
make sanitation we could also vaccinate them i mean we could use them as experimental animals and and squirt them full of shit and see what happens we could sequence them you know and can use all these different populations the same and it could be a really great opportunity all right or we could you know

25:47.159 --> 25:53.649
give them better food, teach them some agriculture, help them build an infrastructure so that they don't get so much poop in their mouth.

25:53.689 --> 26:02.283
But nah, why would we do that when we could use them as experimental animals for decades and tell everybody that the earth and mother nature is trying to kill them?

26:04.073 --> 26:15.579
But part of it is also a straightforward health economic problem and how we apply that in the developing world, because it is different, quite different circumstances to how it is in the United States.

26:15.919 --> 26:18.781
And I don't think we always fully understand the sort of drivers

26:19.221 --> 26:22.564
that we have to appreciate if we're going to sort out this problem.

26:22.924 --> 26:34.255
And then there's a third issue, which is all to do with even if we actually solved the scientific, the medical problems, if we worked out the economics, how do we actually deliver that on the ground?

26:34.295 --> 26:37.597
I mean, with the infrastructures often in very weakened conditions.

26:37.638 --> 26:41.661
So I think we have to think about this with a range of issues

26:44.223 --> 26:49.407
Not simply a scientific one, not simply an economic one, not simply a developing one on the ground.

26:50.127 --> 26:57.412
Because it's not a simple thing to convince the earth that intramuscular injection is a good idea.

26:58.393 --> 26:59.894
It's not a simple thing at all.

26:59.994 --> 27:07.479
So we're going to have to find lots of ways to demonstrate that intramuscular injection is essentially medicine.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.942
One of the ways to do it would be to work in the third world.

27:13.450 --> 27:24.118
and not to fix the water problem, not to fix the sanitation problem, but to use intramuscular injection to fix the problem.

27:26.320 --> 27:33.946
And as long as you do them in the right order, essentially you could give them clean water in a couple of years and say it was the vaccines.

27:35.607 --> 27:37.909
And it's not that dissimilar to what happens in Africa.

27:38.789 --> 27:50.318
It's not that dissimilar to what Luke Montagnier was arguing when he would argue with Tony Fauci that, you know, when you give them clean water, you show them a little agriculture and you make sure that they don't get so much poop in their mouth.

27:50.759 --> 27:53.101
It tends to, you know, kind of make the AIDS go away.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.664
Whatever it was or is.

27:59.309 --> 28:00.530
Luke knew the truth.

28:00.610 --> 28:02.632
Luke also knew that he couldn't tell the truth.

28:02.772 --> 28:04.854
And that's why he's still being used today.

28:05.215 --> 28:09.299
That's why CHD is still waving a flag with Luke's face on it.

28:09.339 --> 28:12.382
Because they don't want you to know that Luke Montagnier knew the truth.

28:13.363 --> 28:16.486
They want you to think that Luke Montagnier knew the truth about prions.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.257
I'd like to get a sense of that overall picture.

28:23.297 --> 28:27.100
I wonder if Geoffrey could kick us off with just putting it all in perspective for us.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.400
Well, thanks, Paul.

28:28.540 --> 28:34.944
I thought both summaries were perfect, that we're making a lot of progress.

28:35.124 --> 28:38.826
So this is not a spontaneous conversation.

28:38.846 --> 28:40.667
This is a scripted conversation.

28:40.727 --> 28:47.531
So I wonder if Geoffrey could start reading his lines now, is what Paul Nurse, the Nobel Prize laureate, said.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.803
should look up what he won a Nobel Prize on.

28:51.304 --> 29:02.091
An amazing amount of disease and death that still occurs every year that just could be controlled massively if we put our attention to it.

29:02.672 --> 29:11.978
So the good news is, as you said, Charlie, that the number of children under the age of five who are dying every year of infection

29:12.839 --> 29:14.880
has dipped below 10 million.

29:15.500 --> 29:23.602
That's good news because in 1990 it was about 13 million deaths and it's come down even though the numbers of children have gone up because of population growth.

29:24.182 --> 29:33.205
So that sounds good but on the other hand all of a sudden you think 10 million children dying of things like malaria or measles

29:34.165 --> 29:48.177
or other infections, diarrheal disease or respiratory infection that can be controlled by an antibiotic or a vaccine or something as simple as a bed net or a dose of anti-malaria medicine.

29:48.297 --> 30:01.268
Now keep in mind, Jeffrey Sachs, in my humble opinion, is there to present the best of the ideas in a way that doesn't really reveal their plan.

30:02.526 --> 30:06.510
They don't plan to give out bed nets before they give out injections.

30:06.590 --> 30:09.934
They don't plan to clean up the water before they give out injections.

30:10.354 --> 30:14.799
They don't plan to do anything else before they give out injections.

30:14.859 --> 30:15.780
And he knows that.

30:16.361 --> 30:17.582
Hotez knows that.

30:18.143 --> 30:19.024
They all know that.

30:21.599 --> 30:30.042
Wonderful thing is we have these powerful technologies and we see in many parts of the world that these diseases have gotten completely under control.

30:30.563 --> 30:40.967
And at the same time, we have nearly 10 million deaths per year of young children from what should be completely controllable causes.

30:41.547 --> 30:45.208
And what Paul says is really the point.

30:45.628 --> 30:47.369
The deaths are occurring in places

30:47.529 --> 30:48.969
Mark is in the chat.

30:49.250 --> 30:49.950
Hello, Mark.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.890
I just mentioned that about five minutes ago.

30:51.950 --> 30:56.932
The wife of Jeffrey Sachs is indeed the most frequent co-author of Peter Hotez.

30:56.972 --> 31:02.133
Her name is Sonia Ehrlich Sachs.

31:02.173 --> 31:04.054
I have a slide coming up in a little while.

31:04.074 --> 31:05.294
This is of extreme poverty.

31:05.914 --> 31:07.875
So we have to face the basic question.

31:08.979 --> 31:19.866
How do you have our powerful techniques like vaccines or medicines or bed nets reach the poorest of the poor because they can't afford them on their own, their government.

31:19.926 --> 31:25.489
And Sonia is also a professor at Columbia for sustainable development or some crazy shit like that.

31:25.829 --> 31:30.774
are also impoverished because they try to collect taxes from people who have no money.

31:31.394 --> 31:37.660
And so the question is, can the rich world and the poor world work together to solve this problem?

31:38.020 --> 31:43.946
The rich world and the poor world working together to solve problems is code for globalism and the UN.

31:45.825 --> 31:47.186
So why are we doing this?

31:47.266 --> 31:49.126
Why is he there already in 2007?

31:49.446 --> 31:54.808
You can watch that whole thing if you look it up on Housatonic ITS.

31:55.008 --> 32:02.591
You can find that video on YouTube because Mark has archived it also on Rumble and on Peertube.

32:02.611 --> 32:04.892
So you know, anyway, I don't want to watch that whole one.

32:04.912 --> 32:09.634
I have another video in mind and I do have to get off before 12 because I have an interview with Dan Cohen today.

32:10.374 --> 32:11.895
This is for the Human Genome Project.

32:11.915 --> 32:13.896
That's why we have a fake anti-vax movement.

32:13.936 --> 32:16.698
That's why Jeffrey Sachs was back there all that long ago.

32:17.138 --> 32:19.680
That's why they've recruited Peter Hotez all that long ago.

32:21.841 --> 32:23.923
And you can see it clearly.

32:25.283 --> 32:27.525
What's really frightening is you can see it clearly.

32:28.585 --> 32:31.047
Number one, watch for all the fakes.

32:31.107 --> 32:31.867
There's Polly.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.969
She is an absolute fake.

32:35.290 --> 32:36.210
Where?

32:36.250 --> 32:37.991
That's Katherine Austin Fitz.

32:38.131 --> 32:38.572
Not good.

32:40.642 --> 32:52.350
um where are we going there's mike eden not good oh yeah not good not good oh not good oh my gosh i mean really really is it not obvious now

32:53.510 --> 32:55.711
What we're dealing with here, this is in 2022.

32:55.811 --> 32:58.151
At this time, I am working for Bobby to write the book.

32:58.171 --> 32:59.591
I am now a scientific consultant for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:00.552 --> 33:01.212
in this 22 video.

33:01.252 --> 33:01.972
Just so you know.

33:01.992 --> 33:02.872
Yeah, just so you know.

33:20.765 --> 33:23.968
Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University.

33:23.988 --> 33:29.674
He's the president of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

33:30.795 --> 33:40.084
He's the winner of the 2015 Blue Planet Prize, a bestselling author and a chairman of the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission.

33:40.644 --> 33:45.169
The commission was announced as I recall, I think in June of 2020 by Richard.

33:45.189 --> 33:45.509
That's right.

33:46.812 --> 33:51.158
And then your joining the commission happened in November 2020.

33:52.340 --> 34:03.855
And you assembled a task force for the prestigious medical journal, 190 year old medical journal to determine the origins of COVID-19.

34:05.589 --> 34:09.650
I mean, you hand selected, I think, a number of them, of the commissioners.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.311
OK, so I just want to stop it here for a second.

34:12.331 --> 34:16.153
I am going to play this video for a little while so that we can discuss what he says.

34:16.293 --> 34:20.734
But I want to put it into context why I think this video is so vital to understand.

34:21.414 --> 34:31.078
What I am trying to say, what I want everyone to understand when I'm broadcasting to the earth is that America is currently being undermined from within.

34:31.138 --> 34:35.099
We are being undermined by a fake anti-vax movement.

34:36.192 --> 34:41.076
And that fake anti-vax movement is essentially the Human Genome Project.

34:41.196 --> 34:52.444
It's essentially a group of meddlers, most of them from the Democratic Party or from the left who have previously worked in the Obama administration or in the Clinton administration.

34:52.484 --> 35:03.932
These operatives, like Robert Malone, like Merrill Nass, like Kevin McKernan, these operatives are responsible for curating a narrative

35:04.963 --> 35:20.146
that is very beneficial to the Human Genome Project, very beneficial to the collecting of medical data for the goals of the Human Genome Project by design, because that is a national security priority under the Department of Energy.

35:21.686 --> 35:30.448
These actors were put in place to make sure that transfection, when it was rolled out under the guise of an investigational vaccine, would be

35:31.983 --> 35:42.273
free from blame and that a novel virus would instead be blamed for the damage that was done or the selection of the spike protein from the novel virus that is the damage that was done.

35:43.374 --> 35:52.883
And very specifically, people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., like probably Wolfgang Wodach, Mike Eden,

35:55.907 --> 36:05.416
Peter McCullough, Sukrit Bhakti, and Thomas Binder, any of those people were real in 2020.

36:05.856 --> 36:17.786
They would need to be the focus of these people's attention in order to make sure that their skepticism in 2020 was aimed at something relatively harmless.

36:18.692 --> 36:25.555
As long as Wolfgang Wodach is not heard at all and nobody talks to him, it's fine.

36:25.735 --> 36:26.435
And that's what they did.

36:27.336 --> 36:39.161
As long as Mike Eden stays focused on natural immunity and overlap with other coronaviruses, then at least the novel virus will be accepted and we'll just censor him.

36:40.183 --> 36:49.265
As long as Peter McCullough is focused on VAERS and focused on cardiac and focused on hydroxychloroquine, that means there's also a virus.

36:49.305 --> 36:49.965
So that's fine.

36:50.505 --> 36:51.906
We'll just keep him on narrative.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.186
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:54.246 --> 37:05.409
is focused on human rights and free speech and lockdowns being totalitarian, then he's also accepting the novel virus.

37:05.449 --> 37:06.629
And so that's totally fine.

37:06.669 --> 37:09.330
And we need these people to make sure that he never gets past that.

37:10.453 --> 37:11.513
Same with Thomas Binder.

37:11.973 --> 37:16.175
He was willing to go to a freaking insane asylum to try and save his country.

37:16.575 --> 37:22.657
And so for sure, he is now being ignored by all these people because he says there's no virus.

37:22.717 --> 37:25.357
He believes that RNA cannot pandemic.

37:25.778 --> 37:27.178
He knows that we've got it right.

37:29.625 --> 37:35.809
And Sukrit Bhakti was even brought on a stream with me specifically to say that RNA cannot pandemic.

37:35.849 --> 37:38.551
And since we've decided that, we don't need to talk about it anymore.

37:39.031 --> 37:43.214
Again, likely directed by somebody attached to these people.

37:44.355 --> 37:45.656
And he's also been in jail.

37:47.157 --> 37:50.159
He also knows that he can't just say what he wants to say.

37:51.700 --> 37:58.124
The only reason why I can say what I want to say is because I didn't sign an NDA when CHD fired me.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.581
and offered me $8,000 to sign an NDA.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.886
That's why I can call Mary Holland out.

38:07.026 --> 38:08.628
I can call Meryl Nass out.

38:08.768 --> 38:17.737
I can call this book out as an elaborate hoax written by more than 10 people, for goodness sakes.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.701
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:21.693 --> 38:24.175
We are in big trouble in America and we need help.

38:24.215 --> 38:31.160
We need to come together and understand that the right, the conservative right in America has been hijacked by these people.

38:32.081 --> 38:39.386
And it could be that because these people aren't sophisticated enough, they've been put under too much pressure that they don't really understand it.

38:40.407 --> 38:45.250
But you need to come to the place where you can accept that some of them do.

38:46.931 --> 38:47.372
At least,

38:48.450 --> 38:54.253
two or three of those people understand that they're telling a story, but that's how we govern these people.

38:54.893 --> 38:56.034
And so they're fine with it.

38:59.176 --> 39:09.521
If you see it how I see it, then you really have Clinton and then Obama and Biden, Obama and Biden and Trump, which is really just Clinton and Biden, and then Trump, which is really just the Clinton again.

39:15.563 --> 39:17.785
It's just all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

39:17.925 --> 39:29.133
And at the heart of it is a fake anti-vax movement that has its roots in the UK with Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy and Paul Shattuck and Brian Deere.

39:29.633 --> 39:30.634
It's all one show.

39:32.836 --> 39:35.458
And they recycled it and amplified it over here.

39:35.918 --> 39:41.602
And just like in the UK, where it was worth 6 million votes in America, it was worth millions of votes.

39:41.802 --> 39:42.403
And they knew that.

39:43.206 --> 39:46.930
And they put it all behind one guy named Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

39:48.251 --> 39:50.713
That's why you've never heard of her.

39:50.994 --> 39:53.676
And that's why she is working for CHD.

39:54.137 --> 39:56.959
That's why she is on Joe Rogan, not saying it.

39:58.101 --> 40:04.367
Not saying that intramuscular injection is dumb or that RNA cannot pandemic, or that we should just stop.

40:08.274 --> 40:09.876
And that's because she's on their team.

40:09.916 --> 40:11.198
You can see it in this video.

40:11.238 --> 40:19.770
She's not comfortable being called a hero by Brandy because she knows that she's working against Brandy, just like Polly knows that she's working against Brandy.

40:19.790 --> 40:21.513
And that's why they've never said her name.

40:21.533 --> 40:24.417
A couple of very busy weeks for you, right?

40:25.103 --> 40:26.164
Yeah, very much so.

40:26.284 --> 40:39.533
I showed you that instead they promote this guy who knew all about the lab leak, all about the fear and cleavage site in February of 2020 because he's on the same team briefed by narrative curators Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

40:39.873 --> 40:46.177
That's why he pronounced COVID, COVID for so long, like the only other guy on earth who said it that way, Robert Malone.

40:47.918 --> 40:54.220
And so we have been doing a show about this, trying to teach people the issue at hand.

40:54.760 --> 40:55.921
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

40:55.941 --> 40:57.341
This is Gigaohm Biological.

40:58.741 --> 41:05.844
The most important thing that I can ask you to do is to try and keep your eyes clean.

41:07.064 --> 41:10.327
And think of your mind as an eyeball, or two eyeballs.

41:11.028 --> 41:16.813
And you would not let the tiniest little hair, speck of dust, or sand into your eye.

41:16.833 --> 41:30.124
And you need to think of this whole day, and this whole year to come, and the rest of your life, as your mind being an eyeball.

41:31.328 --> 41:40.817
And social media is like some kind of, it's sand and dust and wind and dry air and pollen.

41:42.158 --> 41:46.162
And every time you go like this, you're just flicking it in your eye and now you've got to get it out.

41:47.023 --> 41:47.583
Oh yeah, I got it.

41:48.144 --> 41:48.845
And then you do this.

41:49.365 --> 41:50.326
And that's all it is.

41:51.667 --> 41:56.492
You've got to get off social media and choose every single thing that you watch.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.712
You gotta maybe build your own peer tube or build your own soapbox.

42:02.692 --> 42:08.877
And for sure you have to start getting your friends to follow each other on an app like that.

42:09.417 --> 42:10.258
And see if it works.

42:10.458 --> 42:11.259
You gotta do it.

42:11.379 --> 42:12.440
We need this now.

42:31.263 --> 42:32.364
What a great idea, Mark.

42:33.285 --> 42:35.166
I mean, if they did, that would be wonderful.

42:35.206 --> 42:36.928
Ladies and gentlemen, my name's Jonathan Cooey.

42:37.908 --> 42:45.314
You can find the work I did as an academic biologist by searching my last name and JJ on PubMed.

42:45.334 --> 42:53.741
You can also find a lot of my work represented on the Woodhouse 76 sub stack written by Jessica Hockett and sometimes Jonathan Engler.

42:54.582 --> 43:00.467
They usually use my arguments in a watered down sort of way to have fake conversations with Claire Craig or Pierre Corey.

43:01.207 --> 43:04.690
Um, lately they're talking about there are no genuine vaccines.

43:04.770 --> 43:06.912
Boy, that's a smart statement, isn't it?

43:07.332 --> 43:09.234
There are no genuine vaccines.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.675
What is a genuine vaccine?

43:10.695 --> 43:13.037
Does it have a trademark on it or it really works?

43:13.538 --> 43:15.359
What kind of bullshit is that?

43:17.581 --> 43:19.723
Mike Eden should be ashamed of himself.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.507
on his island in Cyprus or wherever the hell he lives.

43:24.867 --> 43:36.434
And you know, faking that she's friends with Jay Bhattacharya, when we all know actually that the only guy who's had many barbecues with him in California over the last three years is really me, thanks to Greg Glassman, which is really nice.

43:36.474 --> 43:37.355
I was happy to meet him.

43:37.835 --> 43:40.957
He's a pleasant guy.

43:42.538 --> 43:44.059
He's not exactly, you know, if you,

43:45.160 --> 43:46.521
put a bunch of knives on the table.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.682
He's not exactly the sharpest one, but whatever.

43:48.742 --> 43:50.662
You know, NIH is not that big of a job.

43:51.503 --> 43:57.705
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist where we are seeking the truth together.

43:58.506 --> 43:59.606
Bob's a good buddy of mine.

43:59.626 --> 44:01.187
Biology is the way indeed.

44:01.747 --> 44:04.829
This is for all the grandchildren of Earth.

44:04.869 --> 44:07.571
That's why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

44:08.031 --> 44:14.095
And we need to understand it from the perspective of biology that Jeffrey Sachs doesn't understand.

44:14.235 --> 44:21.240
Jeffrey Sachs understands evolution because DNA believes it, because this is the way to enslavement.

44:21.260 --> 44:25.262
This is the way to all the marbles, in a sense.

44:25.322 --> 44:31.026
But we need to understand that they've taken a background and told an elaborate mythology about it.

44:32.128 --> 44:42.912
And the reason why they had to do that, ladies and gentlemen, is because, for real, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

44:43.872 --> 44:49.034
So they had to make up an elaborate mythology which justified it.

44:50.875 --> 44:57.537
And we actually inherited part of that mythology from our parents, because that mythology has been going around for a long time.

44:58.851 --> 45:18.517
but never like it's been going around now because now they have added a crucial step to the mythology, which is that they claim that they can test for this stuff with extremely high fidelity using a science on a background, which could never do that.

45:20.503 --> 45:29.747
PCR, the way that they use it as a diagnostic, cannot pull a high-fidelity signal from the irreducibly complex background.

45:30.507 --> 45:31.468
It simply cannot.

45:32.108 --> 45:40.172
Yet there is an illusion of consensus around the world, through governments and bureaucracies, that these nonspecific tests are actually useful diagnostics.

45:40.232 --> 45:43.013
And what that has done has created the illusion

45:45.430 --> 45:49.434
When RNA cannot pandemic, an intramuscular injection is dumb.

45:49.474 --> 45:59.964
And so that's why they had to tell you this lie and create this elaborate illusion using PCR to convince you that intramuscular injection works for something.

46:02.126 --> 46:06.270
To get your children to accept transfection as a medicine.

46:07.852 --> 46:08.853
This is no joke.

46:13.243 --> 46:27.186
And so the heart of this, which is not, it's not questioned by Jessica Rose or Meryl Nass or Robert Malone or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:27.306 --> 46:39.328
or Jay Bhattacharya or Marty McCarty or President Donald Trump, that PCR works, that the ghosts are real and that there are Ghostbusters.

46:39.868 --> 46:42.809
And one of the biggest Ghostbusters is Kevin McKernan.

46:45.151 --> 46:57.097
This is where America is right now, where no one will admit that placebos have always made the vaccine schedule safe, and certainly made the rollout of transfection safe.

46:57.938 --> 47:01.200
And none of them will touch the PCR test again.

47:01.680 --> 47:07.183
Because by revisiting the PCR, we will revisit the FDA's role

47:08.527 --> 47:20.494
to assure that medical devices are safe and effective, which they did not do for the PCR tests and still aren't doing because it is kind of an illusion of consensus that it worked for five years.

47:21.014 --> 47:23.536
We must free our children from this trap.

47:25.737 --> 47:32.761
Because our children that go to college are using their tests to find their ghosts and still believe that they are ghost busting when they do it.

47:36.903 --> 47:39.084
RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb.

47:39.124 --> 47:42.845
Transfecting healthy people is a crime and the population pyramid is a real problem.

47:44.365 --> 47:53.467
In 2002, a guy by the name of Pim Fortuyn was killed in the Netherlands and I moved there about five months after it happened as a PhD student.

47:53.967 --> 48:00.589
And so I heard from a lot of people what Pim Fortuyn meant to everyone in the Netherlands.

48:00.649 --> 48:03.930
And maybe the most important thing in my humble opinion about Pim Fortuyn

48:05.819 --> 48:09.082
He wanted out of the EU and the Euro.

48:10.244 --> 48:18.793
Pim Fortuyn wanted out of the EU and the Euro and he was about to become the Prime Minister of the Netherlands in 2002.

48:18.853 --> 48:20.815
And on May 6th, he was shot.

48:28.502 --> 48:33.863
Just after the murder, the first people gather at the house of Pim Fortuyn at the GW Burgerplein in Rotterdam.

48:34.544 --> 48:37.524
Some are planting flowers at the house.

48:37.544 --> 48:42.185
The suspect, a 32-year-old man from Harderwijk, is an employee of Vereniging Milieu Offensief.

48:42.606 --> 48:45.746
An action group that fights against bio-industry and bond-fuckery.

48:46.146 --> 48:48.467
He remains silent until today.

48:48.927 --> 48:51.868
An action group that fights against bio-industry and bond-fuckery.

48:55.489 --> 48:57.770
So I know it's only one side at a time.

48:57.910 --> 49:00.371
So they're explaining that this is the guy who killed him.

49:01.251 --> 49:03.091
He's kind of an animal rights activist.

49:03.131 --> 49:06.513
He doesn't like lab animal testing and stuff like that.

49:06.593 --> 49:10.134
Now, the interesting thing is, is that Volker van de Graaff

49:10.914 --> 49:13.035
is actually free in the Netherlands now.

49:13.115 --> 49:23.779
He served his sentence, whatever it was, 10 years in prison for killing a politician that was about to be prime minister in cold blood on the street.

49:24.360 --> 49:28.161
Although it's weird because there were two different kinds of bullets found in the guy.

49:28.721 --> 49:34.304
It's almost like there were, you know, a guy to do it and then a guy to make sure that he did it.

49:36.185 --> 49:36.905
I shit you not.

49:37.998 --> 49:44.406
This happened five months before I moved to the Netherlands, so if you want to know why I was woken up, it was because of this.

49:44.947 --> 49:49.934
Because I went over to the Netherlands knowing, or thinking in my head, that the euro was a trap.

49:50.905 --> 50:01.652
that giving up the Gilder was a terrible idea because if you had 13 currencies, it would be a lot harder for a central bank of one of those to screw up or to ruin the rest of them.

50:01.692 --> 50:08.517
But if you have one central bank for all of those countries, now you don't have control over your own monetary system.

50:08.537 --> 50:09.358
That's bizarre.

50:09.778 --> 50:18.544
And I thought a country as small as Holland that was trading with the world for so long would understand that as a central pillar of their sovereignty.

50:18.884 --> 50:20.005
But they apparently didn't.

50:20.345 --> 50:46.025
but Pim Fortuyn did and he got shot and that guy is now jogging free in the Netherlands he rides the train around and people make selfie videos where they call him a murderer and he has to live with that for the rest of his life but he's jogging around free in the Netherlands after having killed a guy that in a in a week would have been the prime minister think about that 2002

50:49.520 --> 50:56.204
Harderwijk is an employee of Vereniging Milieu Offensief, an action group that fights against bio-industry and bond-fuckery.

50:56.584 --> 50:58.205
He remains silent to this day.

50:59.105 --> 51:02.307
In the city hall, a condolence register will be opened on the same evening.

51:02.687 --> 51:13.513
It's important to understand that they didn't understand in the Netherlands how important he was until he was dead, because thousands of people came to Rotterdam to mourn him.

51:13.873 --> 51:15.494
Our leader shot himself.

51:15.994 --> 51:17.875
Democracy no longer exists in the Netherlands.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.241
Democracy doesn't exist in the Netherlands anymore.

51:23.182 --> 51:24.702
That's what this Rotterdammer says.

51:26.643 --> 51:32.226
In 2002, remember, he was going to be prime minister.

51:32.246 --> 51:35.587
He can't understand it.

51:49.491 --> 51:54.363
White people, black people, Dutch people were sad, like broken.

51:55.204 --> 51:59.555
Five months afterward, I was still talking to people that would spontaneously break down about it.

52:04.366 --> 52:07.708
And they didn't even, they couldn't even see it for themselves.

52:07.949 --> 52:12.972
I was the first person to say it in a cafe in the Netherlands in front of all these people.

52:12.992 --> 52:21.579
You don't actually think that a fricking animal rights activist killed this guy when you guys are about to go into the Euro, do you?

52:22.519 --> 52:23.180
Come on.

52:24.461 --> 52:25.642
That's pretty convenient.

52:27.663 --> 52:30.005
And they just, the table was silent.

52:31.837 --> 52:43.040
PhD students and a couple professors were just like dumbfounded by the new American who just got off the plane, was having his first floutje of beer, and just said, dudes, come on, wake up.

52:57.372 --> 53:01.757
Last week I had my last interview for the story and I was still talking about it.

53:01.817 --> 53:02.778
About what?

53:02.798 --> 53:07.083
Well, the only thing that can still go wrong is when you get shot in the head.

53:07.143 --> 53:13.531
And he said, the whole country can be there for you, but you only have to be in the middle of nowhere.

53:15.166 --> 53:17.828
20,000 people spontaneously did a march the next morning.

53:17.848 --> 53:20.450
Some people were there crying for three hours

53:44.395 --> 53:51.119
after they put their flowers down, they had to bring in tents so people could cool off and port-a-potties.

53:51.139 --> 53:53.020
They had no idea this was gonna happen.

53:56.042 --> 53:59.164
The Netherlands could have fallen apart in 2002, you know that?

53:59.264 --> 54:02.426
The whole EU could have fallen apart in 2002 if the Netherlands would have decided not to do it.

54:02.446 --> 54:02.967
Think about this.

54:13.414 --> 54:17.797
Those are grown men crying on film, on TV.

54:17.817 --> 54:20.959
This is a man we're not going to find again.

54:37.984 --> 54:39.825
What do you think about his ideas?

54:40.345 --> 54:43.867
And she's going to say I wasn't for his ideas.

54:43.887 --> 54:45.247
But he didn't earn this.

55:01.297 --> 55:03.758
Also at the Rotterdam City Hall it remains busy the whole week.

55:04.058 --> 55:09.099
The condolence register is signed by about 70,000 people.

55:09.159 --> 55:13.780
Pim Fortuyn is re-elected by the Rotterdam City Council on Wednesday.

55:13.940 --> 55:17.441
In a special meeting, among other things, Ronald Soerissen speaks behind Fortuyn.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.562
I just wanted to play this so you know some of this history.

55:27.642 --> 55:29.963
So this is the day before the murder here.

55:31.204 --> 55:38.448
Pim Fortijn, the grootste partij met around 38 commerce seats.

55:38.968 --> 55:42.530
So he's probably going to be, Warschijnlijk is probably prime premier.

55:42.710 --> 55:50.435
So he's going to be prime minister, I guess it's premier, in the 6th of May, and then he's dead.

55:51.115 --> 55:57.637
So then the next day they say that the electorate was gonna give the keys to the cat house.

56:00.538 --> 56:03.279
They almost gave the keys to the cat house to this guy.

56:05.360 --> 56:12.522
As far as I can read that, that's like going from saying, yep, I guess he's gonna be prime minister to basically just making fun of the fact that he's dead.

56:16.504 --> 56:17.264
It's remarkable.

56:19.164 --> 56:20.525
In cold blood on the street.

56:24.178 --> 56:24.638
And why?

56:24.658 --> 56:26.319
It was because of the EU.

56:26.479 --> 56:30.920
While Bobby is focused on ending the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies.

56:31.400 --> 56:35.281
It was because that guy was going to lead the Netherlands out of the EU.

56:35.941 --> 56:38.702
And one of his biggest campaign promises was that.

56:40.523 --> 56:46.924
Now, on the flip side, you can be dominated by social media, where you don't need to kill anybody anymore.

56:46.964 --> 56:48.445
You just need to make them invisible.

56:49.488 --> 56:56.234
and show everybody everything that you want them to see to make their 39,000 thoughts a day almost useless to them.

56:57.195 --> 57:00.178
And that's what they are doing, and they are putting the message on every side.

57:00.659 --> 57:11.068
The Democrats want the data, Biden wanted the data, the Cancer Moonshot wanted the data, and now the Trump administration wants the data, and they have Bobby in there to say it.

57:11.449 --> 57:14.652
And she would have said it with Bobby if she'd and Bobby would have gotten in.

57:15.990 --> 57:22.217
So whichever way the lemmings want to run, it's always over the cliff that they already had prepared for us.

57:22.317 --> 57:26.241
Because on either side of the track are people pushing us that way.

57:28.964 --> 57:34.850
Because there aren't Democrats and Republicans, there's just a ruling elite that wears different hats.

57:36.652 --> 57:38.594
And they can change their hats whenever they want to.

57:39.156 --> 57:56.192
I am going to assemble the best technologists and scientists in the world and we will use the latest in AI and computation to examine the health records databases of our nation and those other nations who are also on a quest to solve chronic disease.

57:58.554 --> 57:59.575
She says it right there.

57:59.736 --> 58:00.997
They're going to make a database.

58:01.037 --> 58:02.038
That's the whole plan.

58:03.817 --> 58:11.662
Because these people were put in place, because this is an operation, and it's an ongoing one that started in the Clinton administration or earlier.

58:14.604 --> 58:19.728
Maybe when we've had our first CIA director as president is when this all started, for all I know.

58:19.768 --> 58:21.129
That seems the best to me.

58:21.669 --> 58:22.590
George H.W.

58:22.630 --> 58:22.890
Bush.

58:24.251 --> 58:26.692
Right around the time that the Vaccine X was signed, right?

58:27.553 --> 58:28.353
Right after Reagan.

58:28.714 --> 58:29.094
See that?

58:32.936 --> 58:33.497
Do you see that?

58:34.676 --> 58:36.297
It's one continuous show.

58:38.779 --> 58:42.962
And I was happy in 2000s to assume that the Bushes were bad.

58:43.983 --> 58:45.764
Did I really think that the Clintons were good?

58:46.464 --> 58:47.485
I guess I just didn't know.

58:48.666 --> 58:51.067
And then George W. Bush, obviously bad.

58:53.969 --> 58:56.231
Then Barack Obama, obviously good.

58:56.891 --> 58:58.793
Then Donald Trump, obviously bad.

59:00.486 --> 59:04.908
Then I guess Joe Biden was, he's just an old sweet guy, so he's obviously good.

59:04.928 --> 59:07.209
He just likes smelling little girls' hair or something.

59:07.669 --> 59:09.329
And then Donald Trump, obviously bad.

59:09.369 --> 59:10.310
This is all one show.

59:11.550 --> 59:18.373
All one continuous show where every single one of these people is interested in the same thing, bioweapons.

59:19.113 --> 59:20.114
Why bioweapons?

59:20.194 --> 59:21.054
Why genes?

59:21.634 --> 59:23.455
Why genes, germs, and medicine?

59:24.235 --> 59:25.676
I ask Josh Lederberg.

59:27.517 --> 59:30.579
Because that's the whole frickin' plan.

59:31.439 --> 59:34.361
That's the whole friggin' plan.

59:35.261 --> 59:45.447
Since Hilary Koplowski and Herman Muller and Joshua Lederberg and Julian Huxley wrote this collective book, had that meeting.

59:46.007 --> 59:46.968
It's been the plan.

59:49.409 --> 59:52.751
And that's why Kevin McKernan is here now, why Robert Malone is here now.

59:52.791 --> 59:54.012
They need people that are

59:55.418 --> 01:00:00.060
that are intimately connected to this narrative in a way that they can't get out of.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:17.447
Through their father, through Bob Gallo and Murray Gardner, through the anthrax vaccine, through NATO, through the 100,000 Genomes Project equivalent in the UK, from Gavi and Salbi, from MIT.

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:28.790
And so it's, you know, easy to believe it's Bill and Melinda Gates and the United Nations.

01:00:29.771 --> 01:00:32.432
But then we don't connect Jeffrey Sachs to the United Nations.

01:00:34.193 --> 01:00:36.074
We don't connect him to the World Health Organization.

01:00:36.114 --> 01:00:38.656
We don't connect Robert Malone to the World Health Organization.

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:42.378
We don't connect Herod von den Bosch to the World Health Organization.

01:00:43.978 --> 01:00:46.100
We don't connect Robert Malone to Merck anymore.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:46.660
He's fine.

01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:53.076
We don't connect anybody to Gabby, even though they work there.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:53.656
We don't connect.

01:00:53.676 --> 01:00:54.256
What is this?

01:00:56.017 --> 01:00:57.357
It's because of social media.

01:00:58.817 --> 01:01:18.523
It's because even though those connections exist, even though people like Mark Kulak can do program after program after program, and GigaOM Biological can do program after program after program, because of this, the impact that we have on everyone's 30,000 thoughts a day is almost nil.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:27.283
And that's why I'm gonna say it every day, you gotta get off of social media, you gotta make your own social media, or they will continue to get away with this.

01:01:27.343 --> 01:01:33.128
These people who understand the power of social media and understand the power of the programming.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:44.998
And if you call it an algorithm, then it seems like nobody's responsible for it, when in reality, they are very responsible for it as a military program, and they are using it to control us.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:54.597
More specifically, they have taken control of the conservative right, effectively neutered it, and used it to put their operative in the White House.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:02:10.740
A continuous set of operatives, of puppets, that have been in the White House, as they have progressively taken control of the conservative narrative, and it ultimately has come to this health freedom nonsense, which will allow them to implode it all.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.121
We're gonna beg for it to be imploded.

01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:13.941
That's their plan.

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:16.810
and we're gonna fight each other about it.

01:02:18.191 --> 01:02:21.971
And then they're gonna be able to say, see, they can't handle the truth.

01:02:23.732 --> 01:02:25.772
Nobody is in this narrative by chance.

01:02:26.252 --> 01:02:28.213
No one is in this narrative by chance.

01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:33.714
This podcast will reveal no one is in this narrative by chance.

01:02:33.774 --> 01:02:43.996
And yes, she does work with the, she is the number one co-author of Peter Hotez, that's her name, Sonia Ehrlich-Sacks, the wife of,

01:02:44.984 --> 01:02:52.389
of Jeffrey Sachs, again, Jeffrey Sachs being the guy from Columbia and the UN and the Sustainable Goals and all that stuff.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:57.412
So let's listen to this.

01:02:57.432 --> 01:03:05.658
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

01:03:18.588 --> 01:03:22.470
I am going to have to cut it off early, though, because I do have to interview with Dan at 12.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:26.854
So I got about, let's say, 20 minutes of this.

01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:29.816
But that's all we're going to need, because by 20 minutes, you're just going to love it.

01:03:34.839 --> 01:03:35.480
Hey, everybody.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.182
I'm really delighted today to have an old friend.

01:03:39.195 --> 01:03:46.578
To talk to us, Jeffrey Sachs is the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University.

01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:52.261
He's the president of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

01:03:53.381 --> 01:04:02.666
He's the winner of the 2015 Blue Planet Prize, a bestselling author, and a chairman of the Lance's COVID-19 Commission.

01:04:03.226 --> 01:04:07.748
The commission was announced, as I recall, I think in June of 2020 by Richard.

01:04:07.768 --> 01:04:08.088
That's right.

01:04:09.406 --> 01:04:13.748
and then you're joining the commission happened in November, 2020.

01:04:14.928 --> 01:04:18.210
And you- So I'll just explain again what this means.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:34.077
I believe that people like Bobby Kennedy and Jeffrey Sachs and all of these operatives that I've shown you on previous slides were put in place to make sure that the murder and lies would be misconstrued as a virus.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.978
And the way that we would come to believe it

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:50.571
is that a mystery of a lab leak coverup would be solved on social media, that the truth would be let free on X, and that that's what the Scooby-Doo is.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:59.058
It's a cartoon from my childhood where a group of teenagers drive into random towns and encounter some kind of mystery.

01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:06.444
It's always a monster that ends up having their mask pulled off, and it's revealed to be some guy in the town that was in the show earlier.

01:05:07.554 --> 01:05:21.707
The point is, is the monsters are never real and always the resolution of the story is that these pesky kids solved something and otherwise the bad guy would have gotten away with ripping off some business or stealing some artifact or whatever it is.

01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:30.516
In this case, we're supposed to believe that Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak and the Wuhan lab and the Chinese government are all getting away

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:47.650
with covering up a lab leak that nobody wants to take responsibility for, that China don't want to take responsibility even though they did it, and Fauci doesn't want to take responsibility even though he funded it, and he funded it over in China with an agent because Obama made it illegal in America.

01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:54.374
And that's why Tony Fauci and Rand Paul had an argument, and that's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:54.434 --> 01:05:58.497
and CHD put this book out and tried to get me to be one of the experts in it.

01:06:00.117 --> 01:06:05.299
And had I gone for it and stayed on that narrative, I would probably be on Joe Rogan by now.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:15.963
Instead, we have the traitor Kevin McKernan going on big podcasts saying it's Charles Rixey that helped with this book because I think that was probably the original plan.

01:06:18.544 --> 01:06:22.206
To get me and Charles Rixey in there and then to promote Rixey and not me.

01:06:24.363 --> 01:06:26.688
just like they do all the time with everybody else.

01:06:26.728 --> 01:06:33.243
They put somebody in front of them to let STEM stand in front and the shoe salesman slash Marine would be the guy to do it.

01:06:34.414 --> 01:07:02.128
That's why right now in 2025, Kevin McKernan is still telling that story because that lie is necessary to sustain this one, the lie about a lab leak, this one, the lie about a lab leak that the UN sustainable development guy from Columbia, the same university where Mary Holland comes from, is gonna convince this guy that it was really a lab leak and that he didn't understand at first, but he sure does now.

01:07:02.528 --> 01:07:04.029
These people are liars, boy.

01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:24.125
And so this guy can go on thinking that he's a crusader and he's about to become president and it's all gonna be on the back of a health freedom movement that has wrapped as much environmental toxicity and autism and electromagnetic radiation all into one big campaign bundle.

01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:31.687
And he's the perfect guy to campaign on those things because he's built a track record of being all of those things.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:37.373
And so here comes UN guy gonna give him the final story that he needs to finish his book.

01:07:40.914 --> 01:07:37.373
2002.

01:07:41.194 --> 01:07:44.415
Sorry, 22.

01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:53.618
For the prestigious medical journal, 190 year old medical journal to determine the origins of COVID-19.

01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:59.080
You hand selected, I think a number of them, of the commissioners or?

01:08:00.021 --> 01:08:05.943
but most notoriously, Peter Dayzak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance.

01:08:06.964 --> 01:08:14.727
And to be chairman of the task force, Dayzak was essentially forced to recuse himself in June of 2021.

01:08:15.487 --> 01:08:22.150
And then you shut down the commission altogether in September of 2021.

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:27.872
And then you did something incredibly courageous,

01:08:29.085 --> 01:08:37.729
which was to publish an article at PNAS, which has gotten a tremendous attention.

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:43.653
I'm sure you're getting a lot of both negative and positive blowback from that.

01:08:45.053 --> 01:08:58.060
But essentially saying that your belief is that the best evidence is that the COVID-19 virus came from a Chinese lab

01:08:59.485 --> 01:09:03.768
but that it was based upon US funded technology.

01:09:04.889 --> 01:09:09.253
And I would have to agree with you on that, having done a lot of research on it myself.

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:15.618
But let's talk about how you got involved in it in the first place.

01:09:16.599 --> 01:09:18.580
Were you approached by Richard Horton?

01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:21.603
Yeah, so Bobby, great to be with you.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.405
Really fun and an important topic.

01:09:25.066 --> 01:09:27.928
A really fun and important topic, he says.

01:09:28.308 --> 01:09:33.211
So the funny thing is, remember the video that I showed you with Peter Hotez?

01:09:34.612 --> 01:09:40.576
The video I showed you with Peter Hotez and Charlie Rose that Mark used the tonic archive for us.

01:09:40.596 --> 01:09:43.198
That video is from 2007 and now we're in 2022.

01:09:43.358 --> 01:09:44.819
Just don't forget that, please.

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:45.159
Here we go.

01:09:52.389 --> 01:10:00.311
Let me just fill out a few of the details and just correct a little bit of the detail on that.

01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:09.934
Because to put it clearly, I'm chairing a commission for the Lancet called the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.

01:10:10.454 --> 01:10:14.215
It's issuing its report in mid-September.

01:10:14.736 --> 01:10:16.136
So the commission continues.

01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:18.937
Within the commission, I established

01:10:19.893 --> 01:10:25.177
It's a commission to find out what happened with the virus, but look at this graph behind me here, right?

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:38.227
The red that you see here over 2013, hopefully you can see my arrow, all the way to 2020, this red right here, see it behind me?

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:41.370
That red is deaths by pneumonia.

01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:46.634
I am suggesting that they murdered people by treating pneumonia differently.

01:10:47.648 --> 01:10:51.210
in 2020 and continuing to treat it differently until the end of 2021.

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:54.912
And then they started treating it the same again.

01:10:54.932 --> 01:10:57.613
And that's why the numbers went right back to baseline.

01:10:58.774 --> 01:11:06.498
The changes in the protocols were many, many, depending on where you were, what hospital you were in and what they told you to do.

01:11:07.018 --> 01:11:08.579
It could be supplementary oxygen.

01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:10.540
It could be a premature ventilation.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.960
It could be over-ventilating.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.601
It could be remdesivir.

01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:14.642
It could be midazolam.

01:11:14.682 --> 01:11:16.543
It could be not using antibiotics.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:22.431
because it's a viral syndrome, and sticking to that like glue.

01:11:23.733 --> 01:11:29.925
And that would be enough to create this signal, which shown on the background of all-cause mortality isn't that high.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:40.159
especially when you realize that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality in the population pyramid built in that they knew was coming for decades.

01:11:40.199 --> 01:11:44.382
And that's why this guy knew this was coming for decades.

01:11:44.502 --> 01:11:57.271
This guy in 2007 was already pushing that narrative on Charlie Rose because they knew that in 20 years, there was going to be a signal from the population pyramid of a lot of old people dying.

01:11:57.732 --> 01:12:00.434
And they could sculpt that using murder and lies

01:12:00.894 --> 01:12:11.462
to create a mythology that would get the vast majority of the earth to permanently believe that intramuscular injection was medicine, when in fact it's not.

01:12:13.123 --> 01:12:14.324
That's the whole story.

01:12:14.344 --> 01:12:20.309
11 task forces.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:24.343
So some were on how to respond to the pandemic.

01:12:24.403 --> 01:12:28.126
Some were on the financial crisis that emerged around the pandemic.

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:33.510
Some were on other issues about public health.

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:39.194
But one of them, one of the task forces was about the origins.

01:12:39.714 --> 01:12:47.940
And that's the task force where I asked Peter Daszak to chair and essentially to... Did you hear it?

01:12:49.502 --> 01:12:50.683
He says it correctly.

01:12:50.763 --> 01:12:55.705
Now, maybe he's just a UN guy, so he pronounces everybody's name correctly, but he said Dashek.

01:12:57.425 --> 01:12:58.606
I've never said Dashek.

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:00.387
I've said Dashek my whole life.

01:13:00.707 --> 01:13:01.827
Always say Dashek.

01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:03.188
I never say Dashek.

01:13:06.429 --> 01:13:07.089
He knows him.

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:10.691
You know, like Andrew Wakefield knows him.

01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:12.492
Organize the task force.

01:13:12.552 --> 01:13:15.033
So for each of these 11 task forces,

01:13:16.363 --> 01:13:36.961
I designated a public health expert or diplomatic or financial expert and then gave them or requested of them, since this was all on volunteer time on everybody's part, to organize a group of international experts to work on this.

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:49.206
I was chair right from the beginning of the process, which was the middle of 2020, just as the pandemic was reaching the first half year.

01:13:49.866 --> 01:13:57.670
And it was around that time, Richard Horton and I talked and thought that a commission would be a good idea.

01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:06.134
By the way, not only to review all that happened, we didn't know how long this would last, but also to make some recommendations along the way.

01:14:06.754 --> 01:14:20.289
of how to try to keep this under control, how to make sure that there was health equity for desperately poor people who needed access to medicines or hospitals or protection or face masks or whatever it is.

01:14:20.849 --> 01:14:23.813
Richard Horton asked me to head this and to organize it.

01:14:24.153 --> 01:14:25.434
The commission itself is

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:43.503
40 public policy leaders from around the world, former president of the UN General Assembly, former president in a European country, several scientists, many financial experts, and so on.

01:14:43.803 --> 01:14:46.985
But for me and for us in our discussion today,

01:14:47.769 --> 01:14:51.392
One part of this assignment was so where'd this come from.

01:14:52.193 --> 01:14:57.397
And I can tell you with at the beginning of my engagement in this issue.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:02.241
Well, even from the beginning of the pandemic itself I.

01:15:03.021 --> 01:15:10.547
assumed this came out of nature the same way that SARS apparently came out of nature in 2003-2004.

01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:17.733
In the case of SARS, best guess is that it... He's looking at a script right down here.

01:15:17.773 --> 01:15:20.656
I mean, I see him looking down right over to this side.

01:15:20.696 --> 01:15:24.079
So he's looking at a set of notes, a set of talking points for sure.

01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:28.142
It really was an animal sold in a wet market in China.

01:15:28.943 --> 01:15:31.285
that was carrying that virus.

01:15:31.645 --> 01:15:37.951
MERS, which is another coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, was carried by camel.

01:15:38.552 --> 01:15:44.077
I assumed, okay, this is yet another one of these so-called zoonoses.

01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:46.800
And I thought, who knows a lot about that?

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.384
I think the assumption should be that every time they tell you there was a zoonosis, they're releasing something.

01:15:52.816 --> 01:15:56.658
and tracking where it goes and using the excuse of an outbreak to do so.

01:15:56.698 --> 01:16:03.182
That's why they release really dangerous things like Ebola in Africa where they are fairly sure it's not going to hop on a plane.

01:16:04.343 --> 01:16:07.344
They wouldn't spray Ebola into the subway to see how it worked.

01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:09.986
Come on guys, this is too easy.

01:16:10.911 --> 01:16:15.252
but the guy who's looking at these viruses in the wild, Peter Daszak.

01:16:15.312 --> 01:16:24.655
So I asked him, well, you're around this, you know what's going on in China, why don't you establish the task force?

01:16:25.135 --> 01:16:34.517
So it's interesting for me, I was not in any way on the lab leak side of things at the beginning.

01:16:35.078 --> 01:16:35.978
In fact, I thought,

01:16:36.678 --> 01:16:37.999
that doesn't sound right.

01:16:38.619 --> 01:16:52.109
And so he's actually enacting the part of the person who was a sure sure it was natural and coming over to the lab leak side the actual scooby-doo objective.

01:16:53.476 --> 01:17:03.161
The actual objective of the Scooby-Doo is to get everyone on both sides of the narrative to eventually accept that this possibility is real.

01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:07.583
And even if it wasn't this time, it could be the next time.

01:17:07.663 --> 01:17:08.944
That's all they need.

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:13.246
They don't need you to absolutely believe that COVID came from a lab.

01:17:13.606 --> 01:17:16.948
They need you to believe that that possibility isn't ridiculous.

01:17:17.048 --> 01:17:17.769
That's it.

01:17:18.269 --> 01:17:20.030
That's the mythology of it.

01:17:22.321 --> 01:17:23.862
And that's what his job is.

01:17:24.162 --> 01:17:40.150
He's a very reasonable guy from the UN with a wonderful resume and a long time Columbia professor who's gonna reasonably, I used to think it was natural, but now that Peter Daszak has lied to me, I'm pretty sure it's probably not.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:46.253
I remember explaining in a very learned way to a good friend of mine, no, no, no, that's not right.

01:17:46.293 --> 01:17:49.434
This is a natural sometime in the spring of 2020.

01:17:51.232 --> 01:18:04.176
So what we're talking about, Bobby, is my education also, because I... There would be no reason for him in the beginning of 2020 to know that it was natural.

01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:06.117
There would be no reason at all.

01:18:07.237 --> 01:18:14.780
So this story does not ring true from a guy who was on Charlie Rose talking about infectious diseases

01:18:15.931 --> 01:18:21.260
almost 20 years before this to be saying that he was sure it was natural.

01:18:23.382 --> 01:18:48.252
It's just absurd not to watch this story very close up by some of the principles involved in making the case that it's from nature, from the swan, which is the one that is featured in, say, the New York Times stories in the last few months about the scientists finding the origins and so forth.

01:18:48.713 --> 01:18:51.294
And I can tell you that over

01:18:52.114 --> 01:18:57.616
the period of two years, I was lied to so many times.

01:18:58.617 --> 01:19:01.838
Dashik told me so many things that were not true.

01:19:02.658 --> 01:19:05.439
It was the opposite of true.

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:11.962
So Dashik, the former co-author with Andrew Wakefield about measles in the gut.

01:19:14.423 --> 01:19:17.604
The 60 Minutes featured zoonosis hunter.

01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:21.546
lied to Jeffrey Sachs.

01:19:22.506 --> 01:19:27.209
And so I went from thinking it was a natural virus to being pretty sure it's a lab leak.

01:19:27.449 --> 01:19:29.910
You know, the same guy that Andrew Huff

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:39.331
who has a book with CHD and Children's Health Defense, a red book, which I don't have on my, somebody's gotta send me that book.

01:19:39.371 --> 01:19:40.052
I don't have that book.

01:19:41.052 --> 01:19:49.916
Andrew Huff told Robert Malone on a podcast that at some point in time, Peter Daszak asked him if joining the CIA would be a good idea.

01:19:55.798 --> 01:19:57.879
That's just, that's just real.

01:19:58.819 --> 01:19:59.740
That really happened.

01:20:01.701 --> 01:20:02.602
That really happened.

01:20:06.344 --> 01:20:07.144
Transparent.

01:20:08.365 --> 01:20:13.228
I had to tell him, well, you can't head this task force.

01:20:13.448 --> 01:20:18.452
And even later, soon after that, you can't even be on the commission.

01:20:18.812 --> 01:20:23.655
So I didn't disband the commission, but I did take him off of the task force.

01:20:24.355 --> 01:20:24.656
And then,

01:20:27.204 --> 01:20:28.525
And it keeps coming, by the way.

01:20:29.306 --> 01:20:35.752
The task force members were dishonest to me after I was completely clear with them.

01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:40.256
I want to know what your potential conflicts of interest are.

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:43.860
Are you involved with EcoHealth Alliance, with Daschig?

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.283
Are you involved with Wuhan Institute of Virology?

01:20:47.363 --> 01:20:54.890
Are you involved with NIH in a way that we should understand that there may be a potential conflict for you?

01:20:55.391 --> 01:20:58.113
And Bobby, none of them told the truth.

01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:02.478
Maybe that's not shocking, but it was surprising to me because

01:21:03.482 --> 01:21:10.304
These are, some of them, people that I've known, I would say personal friends in some cases, for 20 years.

01:21:10.784 --> 01:21:17.986
They absolutely did not tell the truth when I asked them clearly, explicitly.

01:21:18.387 --> 01:21:21.087
So that was one part of the story, my growing, oh,

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:29.959
dismay, consternation, that something is really, really.

01:21:30.039 --> 01:21:38.784
He's really having too much fun telling everybody that we're screwed because these people collectively lied to me about virology.

01:21:41.525 --> 01:21:42.486
Think about this.

01:21:45.588 --> 01:21:46.448
Wrong about this.

01:21:47.008 --> 01:21:48.729
And then on the other side, as

01:21:50.154 --> 01:22:11.524
those who follow this story, and you are certainly among the lead in that, the Freedom of Information Act and leaks one by one were demolishing the premises of the natural spillover.

01:22:12.485 --> 01:22:15.206
The FOIA requests and the leaks

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.492
We're destroying this narrative.

01:22:18.552 --> 01:22:21.354
The FOIA requests were so important.

01:22:22.674 --> 01:22:24.055
The FOIA admissions.

01:22:24.655 --> 01:22:32.419
You know, the same FOIA that Christine Massey apparently has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that nobody's got SARS-CoV-2 anywhere.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.840
They don't have it at all.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.521
It's just a sequence.

01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:36.562
Well, no kidding.

01:22:37.782 --> 01:22:39.683
That's why they have to make infectious clones of it.

01:22:39.723 --> 01:22:44.426
That's why they need to manufacture a synthetic DNA and send that around from a central location.

01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:55.758
but none of those people have ever managed to figure it out because they're telling the same bullshit narrative that, that Sachs is telling, except his, his foyers were good.

01:22:56.258 --> 01:22:57.960
Christine Massey's foyer is bad.

01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:01.623
Story, but also revealing the

01:23:03.368 --> 01:23:03.668
Utter.

01:23:04.549 --> 01:23:06.330
Thank you, Christy, for mentioning that.

01:23:06.451 --> 01:23:11.935
I tried to find the video of Kevin McCairn talking to Jeffrey Sachs.

01:23:12.015 --> 01:23:19.821
I know exactly what day it happened because when I was invited to join that interview, I decided to go camping with my family instead.

01:23:20.482 --> 01:23:24.225
It was almost like I thought they chose that weekend because they knew I couldn't do it.

01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:29.285
Um, because I told them that I couldn't do that weekend already in the beginning of the week.

01:23:29.325 --> 01:23:31.566
And they just went away, went and did it anyway.

01:23:32.027 --> 01:23:41.893
And the him and Rick C had a, an apparently private zoom meeting that they couldn't record with Jeffrey Sachs that I missed out on, but you know, it's cool.

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:47.257
And there's no evidence of that in his stream record that I can find, but it definitely happened.

01:23:47.297 --> 01:23:50.819
I know exactly what day it happened on too, because.

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.922
Something, you know, happened in my family that I can put pictures with.

01:23:56.082 --> 01:23:59.543
transparency and misdirection that the U.S.

01:23:59.603 --> 01:24:05.484
government was leading basically from the start, so we were not hearing the truth.

01:24:06.304 --> 01:24:08.705
Again, why am I surprised?

01:24:08.985 --> 01:24:14.346
But it's dismaying to see it come out step by step in this way.

01:24:15.066 --> 01:24:24.068
And what is absolutely clear to me is that there are

01:24:25.307 --> 01:24:30.831
two viable hypotheses about the origin of this.

01:24:31.251 --> 01:24:32.012
See what I meant?

01:24:33.132 --> 01:24:36.194
You don't have to believe that this virus came from a lab.

01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:42.739
You just have to accept that that is a possibility that's worth considering, and maybe worth considering banning.

01:24:42.779 --> 01:24:44.680
You know, like, gaiter function should be banned.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.162
That's exactly what's happening here.

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:53.446
It is a mythology, and you buy into it hook, line, and sinker when you say, ban gaiter function.

01:24:55.106 --> 01:25:00.269
And one of them is out of a lab and there's nothing outlandish about it at all.

01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:06.472
And in fact, like you said, I think it's the odds on explanation.

01:25:07.252 --> 01:25:08.213
I don't speak for those

01:25:08.652 --> 01:25:10.473
whole commission in that regard.

01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:15.036
What the commission sees is that there are two viable explanations.

01:25:15.116 --> 01:25:35.809
But I can tell you two years into this, with all the deceit, deception, lying that I've seen, the scientists on the guanan market side vastly overstating or misdirecting the gaze and the absolute absurd

01:25:36.843 --> 01:25:41.266
He's laughing way too much if millions of people are dying from this.

01:25:41.306 --> 01:25:43.827
He's laughing way too much if it's a world crisis.

01:25:43.867 --> 01:25:50.891
He's laughing way too much if so many people don't respect him and are just lying to him, even though he's the big Jeffrey Sachs.

01:25:52.072 --> 01:25:53.032
It's just absurd.

01:25:53.833 --> 01:26:01.117
And you might not have been able to see it, like I couldn't see it in 2022, but you damn well better be able to see it now or your kids are in big trouble.

01:26:03.095 --> 01:26:14.785
sad, worrisome, frightening unwillingness of the US government starting with NIH to look closely at the lab hypothesis.

01:26:16.487 --> 01:26:17.808
It's really very telling.

01:26:18.028 --> 01:26:21.391
So that's just how's the NIH supposed to look at that?

01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:22.412
I don't get that at all.

01:26:22.452 --> 01:26:22.992
That's weird.

01:26:24.386 --> 01:26:24.926
the scene.

01:26:25.406 --> 01:26:29.008
I started on the other side, but I watched very closely.

01:26:29.308 --> 01:26:52.398
And like all of us, I've been an avid reader of the drip, drip, drip of information that has been pried out of the hands of NIH, because they're pried out of the hands of NIH, as opposed to leaked in a very controlled manner through very controlled people at a very controlled rate, so that the mythology would make sense to everybody.

01:26:52.418 --> 01:26:53.539
You don't want to go too fast.

01:26:54.872 --> 01:26:57.115
Come on, guys, please tell me you can see this.

01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:58.377
They're not talking.

01:26:58.778 --> 01:26:59.799
They're not forthcoming.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.061
They're not being honest.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.964
Fauci's not telling it like it is.

01:27:04.246 --> 01:27:07.491
By drip, the story's coming out, and it's a very worrisome one.

01:27:08.888 --> 01:27:23.891
You know, my approach to this was different than yours because I approach with this enormous skepticism that I've cultivated that basically has grown unwillingly in me since 2005.

01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:27.312
So I'm watching Fauci very carefully.

01:27:28.832 --> 01:27:31.533
Watching Fauci very carefully since 2005.

01:27:31.633 --> 01:27:34.714
Can you hear the narrative?

01:27:35.394 --> 01:27:36.134
Who's the bad guy?

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.541
Who's the bad guy in the Scooby-Doo mystery?

01:27:40.181 --> 01:27:43.842
Watching the journals and how they've devolved.

01:27:43.882 --> 01:27:59.867
And in fact, in 2004, Richard Horton made the statement that the scientific journals, particularly the Lancet, had devolved into propaganda vessels for the pharmaceutical industry.

01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:01.808
And Marsha Engel

01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:12.175
at the same time publish her book, who's a long time publisher of the New England Journal of Medicine, basically saying there's nothing in the journals that you can believe anymore.

01:28:13.395 --> 01:28:18.237
So much of our revenue comes from pharma.

01:28:18.537 --> 01:28:29.181
And now the Lancet is owned by Alisavir, which is a very, very wealthy company that's getting, basically pharma is its partner, and China.

01:28:30.336 --> 01:28:39.104
And throughout the pandemic, we watched Horton do all of these kind of underhanded things where he had to retract articles.

01:28:41.867 --> 01:28:52.316
They published the article on Remdesivir that allowed them, even the World Health Organization was saying, this stuff is poison, it doesn't work, it has no efficacy.

01:28:54.090 --> 01:29:00.397
He published the article for Fauci that allowed Fauci to then go get approval for this very, very deadly drug.

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:07.162
He did, he had to do the, um, uh, the retraction on the circus ear studies.

01:29:07.902 --> 01:29:13.224
Uh, he tried to discredit hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and any kind of early treatment.

01:29:13.924 --> 01:29:20.626
I so admire your integrity on this issue and your willingness to publicly change your mind.

01:29:21.126 --> 01:29:24.547
Oh, he's got the integrity to publicly change his mind, does he?

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.641
What about you, Bobby?

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:44.794
You got the public integrity to change your mind publicly and admit that I told you and taught you the reality at the end of this book, that they didn't need a virus, that they could put this sequence anywhere they wanted to find it because that's all they have is the ability to make DNA and RNA.

01:29:44.834 --> 01:29:46.034
They can make it fairly pure.

01:29:46.094 --> 01:29:48.676
They can make as much as they want and they can put it in places.

01:29:48.876 --> 01:29:50.518
And that's all virology is.

01:29:53.208 --> 01:30:03.571
It's just an elaborate hoax based on the rudimentary technologies provided to us by the Human Genome Project that have been made cheaper and cheaper.

01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:05.451
That's it.

01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:08.432
It's in the book, though.

01:30:08.712 --> 01:30:10.932
It's just not the theme of the book.

01:30:11.112 --> 01:30:12.573
It's in the book because I'm in the book.

01:30:12.753 --> 01:30:21.755
Because they couldn't not put me in the book because they had all their eggs in the idea that I would stay in the book instead of say that the book is bullshit and say that CHD is bullshit.

01:30:22.403 --> 01:30:23.404
which is what I'm saying.

01:30:24.005 --> 01:30:31.131
Because it's a fake anti-vax movement, just like it was a fake pandemic, just like 9-11 was not real.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:39.880
It's all one malevolent show to invert our sovereignty into experimental animal status.

01:30:44.484 --> 01:30:45.706
And they're all in on it.

01:30:45.766 --> 01:30:47.027
It's one big show.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.730
Basically, the left, the DNC, this neocons have been in charge for decades now.

01:30:56.352 --> 01:30:57.875
Eight presidents or something like that.

01:30:59.198 --> 01:31:01.899
which is, you know, so admirable.

01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:10.983
My father's, one of his favorite quotes was from Aspless, which was, you know, the only, it's not a crime to make a mistake.

01:31:11.043 --> 01:31:15.145
Essentially the only crime is not admitting that.

01:31:16.165 --> 01:31:17.746
Not admitting that you made a mistake.

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:26.530
Bobby, you need to admit before you die that you made a mistake selling out America and not just saying that intramuscular injection is dumb back when Brandy explained it to you.

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.291
Around 2017, you could have said it.

01:31:29.691 --> 01:31:31.711
In the movie Vaxxed, you guys could have said it.

01:31:32.211 --> 01:31:35.992
Any time in the last 10 years, you and Mary Holland could have said it on stage.

01:31:38.713 --> 01:31:41.034
Not there's no safe vaccine.

01:31:41.754 --> 01:31:43.334
That doesn't cut it.

01:31:43.955 --> 01:31:51.097
Not that vaccines should be a choice or that religious exemptions are worth, none of these things cut it.

01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:56.078
After 15 years of trying to lead this movement,

01:31:57.113 --> 01:32:00.174
You've been leading this movement for your own purposes.

01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:00.734
That's it.

01:32:02.055 --> 01:32:05.936
And it is very, very well described in this book.

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.338
You did it.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:14.099
You know, the Great Sin is Pride.

01:32:15.146 --> 01:32:18.929
And that gets us in so much trouble when people are unwilling to change their minds.

01:32:18.949 --> 01:32:21.452
So I know that most people.

01:32:22.072 --> 01:32:29.619
The Scooby-Doo link on my website is the website where the place on my website, where I admit freely that I was fooled by a lot of people.

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:39.988
And I'm still trying to figure out who knew they were fooling me and who was just doing it for money or because they were told to, or because they also trusted the same liars that I trusted.

01:32:41.716 --> 01:32:47.940
I think that this man is probably the victim of one of the greatest Truman shows ever executed in modern history.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.902
I think he's been meddled with since his dad and his uncle were murdered.

01:32:53.683 --> 01:32:59.266
And they have been using him as a political pawn, positioning him to be where he is right now.

01:32:59.926 --> 01:33:04.609
And it's people like Jeffrey Sachs and Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland that have done it.

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:11.969
And if he's not sophisticated enough to see it because he's too busy doing push-ups and swinging from chains, I don't know what to tell you.

01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:14.631
He's not who he says he was.

01:33:14.852 --> 01:33:16.653
Who come from your and my background.

01:33:18.615 --> 01:33:22.599
They have put these people in place and they have gotten us to believe anything.

01:33:24.873 --> 01:33:32.796
I'm particularly interested in what they got us to believe with regard to the rise in expected deaths and that there was just a novel virus and not murder and lies.

01:33:32.936 --> 01:33:36.138
I'm very interested in how they convinced this guy to do it.

01:33:38.319 --> 01:33:51.144
I'm very interested to understand whether he could still be freed from this Truman Show, brought to understand that he was used, that his ego was used, that his desire to be in office was used, that he was manipulated by the Clintons.

01:33:52.148 --> 01:33:54.870
and by these other organizations, the DNC.

01:33:55.410 --> 01:34:01.414
I mean, one of the biggest private donors to the DNC before the pandemic was Steve Kirsch, and now he's behind him too.

01:34:02.635 --> 01:34:04.016
That's not by accident.

01:34:04.116 --> 01:34:13.362
One of the most prominent and outspoken praisers of Peter Hotez was Robert Malone and his wife, Jill Glasspool Malone at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:34:13.402 --> 01:34:16.865
Ladies and gentlemen, it's all one malevolent show.

01:34:18.257 --> 01:34:27.479
And it's all one malevolent show to cover up murder and lies in America that were used around the world to pretend that RNA can pandemic, that there was something happening.

01:34:28.359 --> 01:34:33.961
America and the death in America was used to justify the lockdowns around the rest of the world.

01:34:35.601 --> 01:34:42.643
And all of these organizations that have popped up as a result of COVID are all, all sabotaged.

01:34:43.257 --> 01:34:53.786
They all have at their heart, somebody that is attached directly to Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan is on that script either given to them or contributed to it.

01:34:53.826 --> 01:35:05.237
I was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine that he received that could have samarasol, samarasol is the mercury containing organic preservative that they used.

01:35:05.937 --> 01:35:13.504
in vaccines and still use in some instances, but he had a very, very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines.

01:35:14.164 --> 01:35:24.933
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

01:35:25.093 --> 01:35:26.635
I don't like the word autism.

01:35:27.535 --> 01:35:28.556
He was vaccine damaged.

01:35:30.238 --> 01:35:32.520
That's Brian Hooker back when he used to say it right.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.757
That's Brian Hooker back when he knew that intramuscular injection was just stupid.

01:35:39.758 --> 01:35:51.644
And now, Brian Hooker, with the help of Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has assisted in making PCR the standard diagnostic around the world when it's bullshit.

01:35:52.285 --> 01:35:59.609
But it does establish a wonderful remnant stream for the Human Genome Project to start collecting the data that they've always told us they needed.

01:36:00.089 --> 01:36:04.892
And this team worst case scenario, all these people were put in place to make sure that that happened.

01:36:05.572 --> 01:36:07.533
And of course they get their book deals for it.

01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:19.097
Of course they get their little care homes and they get their $250,000 a year salary and they get all their travel paid for free by the nonprofits that they are fellows from.

01:36:19.457 --> 01:36:20.477
Of course, that's true.

01:36:21.778 --> 01:36:22.558
Lots of benefits.

01:36:22.598 --> 01:36:25.059
You can go surfing whenever you want to now.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.483
We can think our way out of this, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:29.503 --> 01:36:31.545
We just got to learn the biology that they lied about.

01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:41.756
We just have to understand the population pyramid and the signal that they knew was coming and how little murder would be required in order to sculpt it into something else.

01:36:42.858 --> 01:36:46.999
We need to understand that there's people that we can blame for this.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:57.323
There are people that are connected intimately to the founding of the FDA and this legal space that they are now trying to destroy, along with the rest of anything that was good in America.

01:36:58.342 --> 01:37:07.289
There are a lot of things keeping- That's the reason why Health and Human Services Secretary Bobby Kennedy was on this salesman's show.

01:37:08.049 --> 01:37:23.421
That's why he has behind him somebody who was on the cover of a newspaper saying her son was cured by something that Andrew Wakefield injected in him and then recycled the whole thing in America a few years later.

01:37:23.581 --> 01:37:24.922
Oh no, wait, he's not cured.

01:37:24.962 --> 01:37:26.564
I still have an autistic kid, totally.

01:37:27.024 --> 01:37:27.665
Totally, I do.

01:37:28.573 --> 01:37:30.374
I totally still have an autistic kid.

01:37:33.235 --> 01:37:35.315
And behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:35.455 --> 01:37:38.056
is Andrew Wakefield, Polly, Tommy, and all these people.

01:37:38.096 --> 01:37:41.777
And behind this guy's appointment are the same people.

01:37:42.418 --> 01:37:43.118
He's a puppet.

01:37:43.838 --> 01:37:46.339
I've had lots of conversations with him.

01:37:46.399 --> 01:37:49.680
This guy is way in way, way, way over his head.

01:37:50.575 --> 01:37:59.143
That's why when he was on my podcast before he knew what they had plans for him, that he was so, so easily saying, well, you're the biologist, Jay.

01:37:59.163 --> 01:38:00.384
You're the biologist, Jay.

01:38:00.404 --> 01:38:01.265
You're the biologist.

01:38:01.325 --> 01:38:02.426
I defer to you, Jay.

01:38:03.727 --> 01:38:04.968
That's why he's on Blaze.

01:38:07.191 --> 01:38:07.951
On Blaze.

01:38:08.976 --> 01:38:10.457
He's going where he's told to go.

01:38:10.518 --> 01:38:15.442
He's not saying to his secretary, I want to be on NBC News and get this out to the masses.

01:38:15.502 --> 01:38:18.265
I want to be on NBC News and tell everybody the truth.

01:38:18.305 --> 01:38:23.770
He's going where he's told because he's just a guy in a mouse suit at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:38:25.712 --> 01:38:30.997
And that's what they've done to Bobby too, standing behind Donald Trump like some kind of mannequin.

01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:36.094
Ladies and gentlemen, murder and lies, you can figure it out.

01:38:36.594 --> 01:38:38.855
The opioid crisis, you can figure it out.

01:38:39.616 --> 01:38:40.836
These are all slave speak.

01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:44.418
All these mythologies need to be dismissed, dispelled.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:48.084
You have to get rid of all of them because they're all mythologies.

01:38:48.124 --> 01:38:49.784
Intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:38:49.804 --> 01:38:51.544
You don't need to use the word vaccine.

01:38:51.564 --> 01:38:53.525
That's part of their trap.

01:38:54.045 --> 01:38:56.025
Autism is another one of those enchantments.

01:38:56.085 --> 01:38:59.406
That word, once you start using it, you're already trapped.

01:39:00.066 --> 01:39:02.786
Once you start using the word vaccine, you're already trapped.

01:39:02.846 --> 01:39:06.807
Intramuscular injection is dumb and autism complicates that idea.

01:39:06.947 --> 01:39:10.868
Autism is a never, an endless basket of bullshit.

01:39:11.348 --> 01:39:15.311
Virology is just applications using synthetic DNA and RNA.

01:39:15.351 --> 01:39:19.854
And once you understand that, you can see why the no virus people are so full of crap.

01:39:22.136 --> 01:39:28.560
And all of these are dependent on you not understanding the definition of these words and not understanding the definition of these concepts.

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:36.706
And instead accepting the definition of the words as they define them, and then trying to argue your way out of it.

01:39:37.864 --> 01:39:41.210
That will never work, especially not on social media.

01:39:41.571 --> 01:39:46.400
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen, and I will definitely see you tomorrow.

01:39:47.222 --> 01:39:48.244
Tomorrow I'll be here again.

01:39:48.264 --> 01:39:48.765
Thanks.

01:40:28.314 --> 01:40:31.295
Please share the stream everywhere you can, ladies and gentlemen.

01:40:32.095 --> 01:40:44.680
We are really dependent on new people finding the stream so we can get new subscribers and make this a sustainable operation instead of something running on the fumes of credit cards and the fumes of a few donations.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.742
I know it sounds like whining, but I believe this is what we need to do together.

01:40:51.603 --> 01:40:57.285
I think we have the best show on the internet, dammit, and more people need to watch it.
