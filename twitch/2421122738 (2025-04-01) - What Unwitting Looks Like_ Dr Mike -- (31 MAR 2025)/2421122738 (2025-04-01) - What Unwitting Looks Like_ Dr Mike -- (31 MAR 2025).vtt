WEBVTT

00:00.262 --> 00:00.322
Oh.

00:19.415 --> 00:21.997
Neptune, eighth planet from the sun.

00:22.557 --> 00:23.438
A mystery now.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.980
We hope to have close-up photos from Voyager 2 in 1989.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.643
We do have them!

00:30.763 --> 00:32.044
They're my home screen.

00:32.424 --> 00:42.451
Miss Hoover, once again, the lesson plan I prepared would have covered this topic much better, but I can see... Miss Hoover.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.392
It's Tuesday, Lisa.

00:44.632 --> 00:45.773
Taco Tuesday.

00:46.334 --> 00:46.554
Oh!

00:58.338 --> 01:05.343
Oh no, I'm about to become another mopping statistic.

01:09.506 --> 01:11.508
There's only room for one of us, Ethel.

01:29.895 --> 01:31.676
Bart, that's your sixth taco.

01:31.916 --> 01:36.258
You know, Whitman says, if anything is sacred, the human body is sacred.

01:36.458 --> 01:36.959
Seven.

01:55.504 --> 02:00.106
Trust me, it's real.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.007
It's real.

02:02.147 --> 02:03.967
Full speed, Kevin.

02:25.339 --> 02:29.441
think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:31.242 --> 02:31.942
And I have lied.

02:31.962 --> 02:33.002
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:33.022 --> 02:33.963
I don't want to lie.

02:34.443 --> 02:35.804
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:35.904 --> 02:36.944
I try not to be a liar.

02:36.964 --> 02:37.805
I don't want to be a liar.

02:38.385 --> 02:41.106
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:43.336 --> 02:45.257
the specialization should make you suspicious.

02:45.937 --> 02:52.179
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

02:52.619 --> 02:54.580
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.121
And that's sort of my starting bias.

03:20.712 --> 03:23.436
You don't know my

03:54.206 --> 04:02.372
Take this message to my brother You will find him everywhere Wherever people live together

04:24.947 --> 04:37.221
Tired in poverty's despair Are you telling me the things you're gonna do for me?

04:37.782 --> 04:45.511
I ain't blind and I don't watch what I think I see Taking it to the next beat

06:43.874 --> 06:44.916
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

06:45.156 --> 06:45.597
I'm an MD.

06:45.617 --> 06:46.358
I'm a physician.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.768
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

06:51.788 --> 06:52.990
I do molecular biology.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.654
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

07:15.993 --> 07:17.914
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:17.955 --> 07:19.255
This time could be different.

07:19.295 --> 07:21.077
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:21.097 --> 07:27.682
We're still trying to take back the power from these charlatans, these acolytes of the charlatans, I guess you could call them.

07:28.782 --> 07:35.748
The illusion of consensus that these people have created, the illusion of consensus that these organizations have created.

07:36.428 --> 07:41.094
Brownstone Institute just paid for a trip for a lot of these people to go to Spain.

07:41.734 --> 07:48.662
Ladies and gentlemen, your consciousness is their prime real estate and they are playing you like a fiddle.

07:49.964 --> 07:52.447
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

08:12.190 --> 08:18.114
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:18.174 --> 08:19.054
It is April 1st.

08:19.094 --> 08:20.915
This is not an April Fool's stream.

08:20.955 --> 08:22.916
I'm not going to try and fool you about anything.

08:23.457 --> 08:30.381
In fact, I'm just going to try and deliver a succinct message about how they've been able to control the narrative and all the questions asked.

08:31.161 --> 08:54.703
so that after five years it's still only on this little tiny corner of the internet where you can hear someone say it as succinctly as RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injections or dumb transfection was a crime and the population pyramids are a real problem that needed solving let's do it ladies and gentlemen if you need to support the stream would like to we would like you to support the stream gigoandbiological.com is the place to go

08:56.078 --> 08:59.539
We did not get very many more views or followers since Kim Iverson.

08:59.579 --> 09:05.200
However, Kim Iverson just had Tom Cowan on, so maybe there's an opportunity to get on there again.

09:05.260 --> 09:08.401
Ladies and gentlemen, you hear the voice of Jonathan J. Cooey.

09:09.121 --> 09:11.321
I am chief biologist at Gig Owen Biological.

09:12.021 --> 09:18.803
I have presented my ideas to lots of places since losing my job at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

09:18.823 --> 09:19.563
You can find the

09:20.492 --> 09:26.635
the evidence of my long academic career on the Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

09:27.895 --> 09:31.697
You would be able to see lots of evidence of my work on this, too.

09:32.337 --> 09:34.118
You can see it on PubMed there, actually.

09:34.719 --> 09:44.323
With regard to COVID-19, where you can't see it, for example, is on the Panda website or on the Panda Rumble channel, because I presented there three separate times in 2023.

09:46.724 --> 09:58.615
or 2022, I think it was 2023, and those all got lost somehow because Nick Hudson, I guess, isn't very good at keeping the good presentations separate from the bad ones.

09:59.536 --> 10:05.301
The NCI is just really good at collecting thousands of hours of useless testimony,

10:06.082 --> 10:20.443
and uh not really sorting through what's important and what's not written not trying to figure out what happened just trying to create a historical document if you will the wellness company you know they're just trying to help people by selling little kits with zippers and uh

10:21.384 --> 10:30.307
The Children's Health Defense is really all about rising and resisting people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

10:30.407 --> 10:37.150
So far, they've scored so many touchdowns, it's hard to really list them all, other than to just say they've sold a lot of books.

10:38.270 --> 10:46.573
I helped them write one of them, the Wuhan cover-up, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.

10:47.073 --> 10:53.596
I presented my dismay with my current situation best and first and best, probably, at the Red Pill Expo.

10:54.136 --> 10:56.697
Thanks to G. Edward Griffin for letting me speak there.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.619
And, of course, I'm trying to work on this thing on the basketball court.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.641
And it actually has a lot to do with me getting in shape.

11:05.281 --> 11:10.244
So a lot of my time is now spent every day trying to turn this ship around, if you will.

11:10.284 --> 11:12.845
I'm a 53 year old man and far from young.

11:13.926 --> 11:15.267
This is GigaOM Biological.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.068
I hope to offer you some hope this morning.

11:18.248 --> 11:23.331
Some hope that no one and everyone, everyone's going to see this at some point.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.792
No one can ignore it anymore.

11:25.572 --> 11:38.785
The history of this biology, the history of these biological ideas, the history of the pandemic, and the history of these people is all going to come together in one beautiful story of awakening.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.346
And I'm very, very excited.

11:41.487 --> 11:45.691
If you're listening from a ladder, please make sure that you keep two hands for the ladder.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.314
This is GigaOM Biological.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.435
Let me just switch over here.

11:52.062 --> 11:52.922
Good morning, everybody.

11:52.962 --> 11:53.562
Welcome to the show.

11:53.582 --> 11:57.623
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by Biologist.

11:57.663 --> 12:00.624
My name is Jonathan Couey, coming to you live from my garage.

12:01.044 --> 12:04.265
It is April 1st, 2025, and this is no joke to me.

12:05.586 --> 12:14.468
We have put everything on the line for the last five years to try and get the truth out, and I stumbled and fell a few times in the first few years.

12:15.688 --> 12:23.955
I took paychecks not knowing why I was getting paid, trying to understand or believe that we were going to get free.

12:24.996 --> 12:41.008
And in the end, I find myself in the same wilderness I was at the beginning of the pandemic, but now with a little more self-assurance that where I am is closer to the truth than you can get by using social media skillfully.

12:44.386 --> 12:47.929
It's Tacos Tuesday, and tacos are not for everybody.

12:47.969 --> 12:52.413
Taco Tuesday is not for everyone, but it is for anyone who likes tacos.

12:53.254 --> 12:57.478
And Truth Tuesday would be, you know, for anybody who likes the truth.

12:58.799 --> 13:04.223
And this is definitely a message that's not for everyone, because not everyone wants to hear

13:05.034 --> 13:06.995
that it's about the grandchildren of Earth.

13:07.396 --> 13:11.219
For example, my brother doesn't want to hear that because he's not having any kids of his own.

13:11.299 --> 13:19.264
So essentially, it means that everything that's happening in the world right now has nothing to do with him and his choices don't matter at all.

13:19.325 --> 13:25.229
And what he says and what he passes on doesn't matter because he's not passing anything on.

13:26.434 --> 13:44.201
And that's the thing that has struck me most as a father of three during COVID-19, is that this whole psychological operation has, one aspect of it has been to separate us from our family and friends.

13:44.301 --> 13:47.382
It separated me successfully from my brother and his wife.

13:47.442 --> 13:51.104
It successfully separated me from my parents.

13:51.884 --> 14:02.606
And my parents and I are starting to work it out over email and text, but we're far from in regular communication and we're far from understanding where each other is.

14:05.407 --> 14:14.989
And they also could have potentially done that within households with a lot of kids, especially kids who went or were allowed to go back to college.

14:15.029 --> 14:16.309
And that's a crucial rift

14:17.165 --> 14:24.408
that is probably in existence in large swaths of America that we need to pay attention to.

14:25.088 --> 14:41.175
Because of course, when this is about the grandchildren of earth and the young adults that haven't yet had kids are being bombarded with messages about homosexuality and transsexuality and having kids is selfish and maybe you should only have one.

14:41.855 --> 14:51.942
They are setting up and perpetuating a population pyramid crisis that is going to lead to the depopulation of the earth inevitably.

14:52.943 --> 14:56.645
And it's not going to require a whole lot of extermination or famine.

14:57.166 --> 15:04.611
It's just going to happen because once, you know, 15 years from now, the population is going to look drastically different.

15:05.711 --> 15:11.055
And it won't have the same kind of nationalistic cohesion that it had when I was growing up.

15:11.996 --> 15:30.314
Despite growing up in a relatively completely white state as a brown kid, I still grow up thinking of myself as just an American white kid, even though when I look in the mirror, I understand I don't look like everybody else that I grew up with in northern Wisconsin.

15:32.580 --> 15:48.645
It's a mentality and the children of this generation are being raised to be hypersensitive to the outward facing phenotypes and what those supposedly mean about whether your ancestors were allowed to succeed or not.

15:49.325 --> 15:51.406
And this is an extraordinary place to be.

15:51.486 --> 16:00.469
It's part of the same mythology that has paralyzed us into believing that a novel virus is not only plausible, but obviously it happened and maybe even they covered it up.

16:03.149 --> 16:06.090
That's why there's a fake anti-vaccine movement in America.

16:06.150 --> 16:09.952
I mean, what better way for me to say it than that?

16:10.732 --> 16:13.854
There is an anti... I gotta put this up for a second.

16:13.894 --> 16:15.255
Hold on one minute.

16:16.595 --> 16:18.716
Just have to reset this guy over here.

16:20.117 --> 16:25.360
Sometimes the production crew, i.e.

16:25.420 --> 16:30.983
myself, is not ready to go with regard to... That's super tiny.

16:32.381 --> 16:33.181
I guess we can do that.

16:34.042 --> 16:34.942
Is this one going to be big?

16:35.583 --> 16:36.083
Am I big?

16:36.123 --> 16:36.343
Yes.

16:36.463 --> 16:36.663
Okay.

16:36.743 --> 16:37.584
I'm big over here.

16:37.684 --> 16:42.687
So I guess I could, I could technically do that, but I want to have the other one up, right?

16:42.967 --> 16:43.747
This one I want.

16:45.288 --> 16:45.528
Yeah.

16:45.568 --> 16:46.609
So it's for all the marbles.

16:46.649 --> 16:53.072
I mean, this is a message that's very hard to, to spread jovially.

16:54.553 --> 16:54.793
What?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.374
Why did you push that button?

16:56.454 --> 16:57.535
See, this is the kind of thing.

16:58.427 --> 17:00.410
And then I really don't want to be that tiny.

17:00.731 --> 17:01.652
I'd rather be bigger.

17:04.237 --> 17:07.422
It's not a very nice message to spread, but I think...

17:08.405 --> 17:30.044
This one is a little bit of a tweak on it because if your family and friends are Trump voters, if your family and friends are really into the Maha movement or believe in one or more of these pseudo heroes in this health freedom movement, then they are trapped by almost certainly

17:31.181 --> 17:34.682
what is best characterized as a fake anti-vaccine movement.

17:34.702 --> 17:59.570
And there may be very many people on the left who are wholly unaware of the idea that there is a genuine, verifiable, fake anti-vaccine movement, which has trapped a populist right into believing that they are in fact the anti-vaccine movement, legitimately fighting for things like free speech and free choice,

18:00.498 --> 18:07.162
Interestingly, if you're on the left, you know that free choice is often an argument used to motivate you.

18:07.742 --> 18:13.246
They have used health, freedom, and choice to motivate the right.

18:13.446 --> 18:18.849
And they have used a fake anti-vaccine movement with fake anti-vaxxers.

18:20.350 --> 18:27.254
And so if you could spread this message to your Trump voting friends, your Trump voting neighbors, not that Trump is bad,

18:28.624 --> 18:50.847
not that their ideas are wrong, but that the anti-vaccine movement in America has been fake since about 2015 when they went all in, full court press, and that you know a guy on the internet who could show them how it was done and give a few plausible reasons as to why it would have been done.

18:53.359 --> 18:56.161
you might be able to save your family and friends from that trap.

18:56.201 --> 19:04.966
And I'm not saying they're not going to vote for Trump, or they're not going to say that these other people are good guys, but they might cast doubt in the right direction.

19:05.226 --> 19:10.389
And the right direction to cast doubt is the fake anti-vaccine movement in America.

19:10.489 --> 19:12.030
Everything else is legitimate.

19:13.991 --> 19:14.191
I mean,

19:15.618 --> 19:22.143
in the sense of they are not doing something and being something else.

19:22.563 --> 19:26.486
Paul Offit is not pro-vaccine, but actually not.

19:28.806 --> 19:31.068
And that's the most important thing to understand.

19:31.168 --> 19:35.492
The anti-vaccine movement in America is almost exclusively fake.

19:35.712 --> 19:51.665
Everything that is widely visible and circulating and holding conferences and gathering here and there and everywhere, these are all fake actors that were inserted into this narrative before the COVID-19 pandemic.

19:53.237 --> 19:57.979
operation was even started, and most of them would even know that it was coming.

19:58.699 --> 20:07.603
None of them knew it was coming, but they were already in place, already doing the job of a fake anti-vaccine movement.

20:09.444 --> 20:17.547
And so the real message is, is that that same anti-vaccine movement assisted in covering up the murder and lies.

20:19.210 --> 20:38.599
murder and lies that were almost exclusively in America done with pure oxygen causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, you know the same thing that they blamed on COVID, that PCR was used malevolently for two or three years at least and maybe malevolently used up till today, although probably more sophisticatedly

20:39.867 --> 20:41.008
used in that way.

20:41.508 --> 20:47.310
And then finally, not using antibiotics for pneumonia or urinary tract infection or sepsis is a crime.

20:47.490 --> 20:49.111
It's an absolute crime.

20:49.151 --> 20:52.852
And that's what explains this graph right here, murder and lies.

20:53.392 --> 21:04.417
And so they need people on both sides of the aisle, on the left and the right, to ask really pressing, really important sounding questions that never ever approach

21:05.037 --> 21:07.419
these very simple conclusions.

21:07.519 --> 21:15.345
It could be about a lab leak, could be about natural virus, if you're in cleavage site, masks, social distancing, whether or not mandates are right.

21:15.905 --> 21:20.829
All of these things are hamster wheels that you can run in until the axle breaks.

21:22.370 --> 21:28.915
And you will never arrive at the possibility that murder and lies was used to create this mythology.

21:29.116 --> 21:31.978
Murder and lies is used to create this mythology.

21:34.468 --> 21:49.498
And so I hate to break it, you know, be that guy, but I just don't have any faith that anyone that is acting on stage is there by chance or is there to the chagrin of the directors of the show.

21:50.258 --> 21:54.000
And that's why, you know, we had the Honorable Tulsi Gabbard,

21:55.492 --> 22:00.857
I mean, it's what happened in front of Congress with this signal chat thing is kind of a joke, right?

22:01.077 --> 22:05.221
The fact that our, that Hagseth is basically made fun of as an alcoholic.

22:07.022 --> 22:14.287
that they're making fun of the, they're doing this stunt with this, this guy was set up to be this bad.

22:14.427 --> 22:22.953
Otherwise you can't explain why his FDA videos are so over the top ridiculous recommending the vaccine for children.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.235
He would, I saw that years ago.

22:26.872 --> 22:40.563
If you want to hear the honest truth about it, I heard at least three or four different actors in this show say that they called Marx to tell him not to do it to kids or something like that.

22:42.304 --> 22:47.508
I mean, there are lots of pieces to this puzzle that we haven't even dropped into the picture yet.

22:48.068 --> 22:52.332
And a couple of those pieces of the puzzle have to do with how many of these actors

22:53.393 --> 22:59.897
during the timeline of COVID went specifically for the FDA and specifically for Peter Marks.

23:00.397 --> 23:07.561
A couple of these actors actually claim to have personal contact, went to school with, have his cell phone number.

23:09.659 --> 23:21.389
And so to think that the very public firing resignation of this guy and the debate around why the circumstances are as they are is by chance is absurd.

23:21.910 --> 23:30.157
We were primed to see Peter Marks where he is right now already three or four years ago by these social media performers.

23:31.138 --> 23:35.442
The people that I'm identifying as those that are covering up for this murder and lies.

23:36.499 --> 23:40.302
and they're actively working, they're paid to be on social media.

23:40.362 --> 23:46.086
I know this is not a message for everybody, but anyone can hear that this is a message of hope.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.708
This means it's very simple.

23:48.646 --> 23:51.627
We just need to see the liars for what they're doing.

23:52.468 --> 23:56.790
Identify the way that they coordinate their message and then call them out on it.

23:57.770 --> 24:07.335
Not allow them to parade around on social media as if these interactions and these interviewing other people who interview other people is solving any problems.

24:08.271 --> 24:20.396
that the opinion of people who interview other people is even relevant if they're not actively trying to learn and demonstrating that they have some idea of how to synthesize recent events.

24:22.757 --> 24:26.418
Again, it's not a message for everyone, but it's a message for anyone who wants to know the truth.

24:27.861 --> 24:30.983
And so, I like to start with the truth all of the time.

24:31.564 --> 24:33.385
I think everyone should begin with the truth.

24:33.445 --> 24:36.847
The illusion is sustained only through your participation.

24:37.608 --> 24:40.109
Transfection in healthy people is a crime.

24:41.450 --> 24:42.771
RNA cannot pandemic.

24:43.532 --> 24:45.553
And intramuscular injection is dumb.

24:45.613 --> 24:46.414
It's not medicine.

24:47.374 --> 24:52.738
And these truths we've been saying for quite some time, all are there and part of

24:53.473 --> 24:56.057
the main illusion, which is that the U.S.

24:56.097 --> 24:57.880
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

24:57.920 --> 25:07.335
And if anybody wanted to show you that before the pandemic or during it, all they would have to do is suggest that you compare it to any other vaccine schedule in the Western world.

25:08.055 --> 25:16.623
And it would already become apparent to you that both the way we do it, the number of doses we do it, and how early we do it is malevolent.

25:17.264 --> 25:26.653
Nevermind if what I say is true, that intramuscular injection in general is dumb, then every vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

25:26.673 --> 25:28.674
So that's a pretty bold statement to make.

25:29.535 --> 25:50.373
on the internet and on youtube and have people just kind of ignore you and and send malicious emails about how you're lying about them or something like that ladies and gentlemen i'm just saying it you got to learn biology that's the way out if you can't learn it from me buy some books and read but you got to learn biology because it's for all the marbles this is definitely for all the marbles

25:51.015 --> 25:52.616
It's for all the grandchildren of earth.

25:52.896 --> 26:00.039
And so we need to get to people and get them to understand that there is a fake anti-vaccine movement in America.

26:01.100 --> 26:10.785
We need to get them to understand that very, very much by making them, challenging them to ask the question, what progress have they made?

26:12.426 --> 26:14.727
And that's why I really like making a calendar

26:15.789 --> 26:33.914
Here's a calendar for somebody that I know named Brandy who in 2015 started to think about whether or not vaccines should be mandated and was wondering why they would be and had an unvaccinated son and in about a year had progressed to the point where she was teaching people in person

26:34.514 --> 26:47.385
that they should just consider the broad ideas of injection versus ingestion of a pharmaceutical and then consider the fact that the injection doesn't have any liability that's very strange because the injection is full of garbage

26:49.870 --> 27:02.154
And that's a mom with an unvaccinated child who regularly says that she feels bad because, you know, she didn't really even speak out about her unvaccinated child until she was kind of forced to accept a mandate in California.

27:02.174 --> 27:05.055
And then she spoke out and that was already kind of late.

27:05.095 --> 27:06.696
She could have saved more people than that.

27:07.936 --> 27:09.337
She happened to be dead on December 7th, 2020.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.656
So that's one timeline you could compare.

27:14.076 --> 27:27.599
If you are an anti-vaccine person, I think a very legitimate place to get is where GigaOM Biological, myself, got all by ourselves without really knowing that Brandy had already gotten there.

27:27.919 --> 27:38.981
Maybe because it's hard to understand the significance of this conceptual location, this dichotomy between injection and ingestion and all of the biological differences therein.

27:40.071 --> 27:49.517
And I was just starting to say intramuscular injection is dumb, as Brandy was pointed out to me again by viewers, not by anybody else.

27:49.577 --> 27:51.498
It's certainly not the social media algorithm.

27:51.538 --> 27:53.759
If you like that, you might like Brandy Botton.

27:53.779 --> 27:54.580
That didn't happen.

27:55.506 --> 28:09.991
Let's compare the timeline of another guy in 2013, whose son was injured, given many vaccines coincident with an ear canal infection, questioned the rationale of vaccination in general, doesn't even use the word autism.

28:10.011 --> 28:17.354
He thinks that word is kind of bullshit and just calls his son vaccine injured or neurologically damaged.

28:17.934 --> 28:21.955
And he had 16 years of experience genetically modifying plants.

28:22.015 --> 28:23.716
Now, if this dude

28:25.205 --> 28:31.670
If this dude, because remember the Brandy that we talked about was, you know, 2015, 16, and then she was dead in 2020.

28:32.611 --> 28:40.076
This guy, 2013, he already knows, like years before Brandy, that autism's kind of a scam.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.118
I don't even know if vaccine is good.

28:42.218 --> 28:44.700
Certainly giving many vaccines is nuts.

28:45.541 --> 28:48.503
And he's a plant geneticist transforming guy, you know.

28:51.822 --> 28:57.868
Would it surprise you that in 2020 that guy was a health freedom anti-mandate activist?

28:58.349 --> 29:04.314
Would it surprise you that he was still telling the story about his kid getting vaccines during an ear infection?

29:04.835 --> 29:09.580
Would it surprise you that he already knew that COVID spread asymptomatically for about a week?

29:10.120 --> 29:22.644
Would it surprise you that he was already advocating for more PCR testing, or that antibodies are a not-so-perfect model for immunity, but we can still talk about them because natural immunity is real?

29:24.004 --> 29:30.426
Did you realize that he was just arguing that the vaccines, the COVID vaccine studies, were underpowered?

29:33.092 --> 29:48.063
The guy who didn't want to call it autism, but wanted to call it vaccine damage, wasn't even sure which one did it, was now a guy who worked on transfections and transformations in plants, was calling them vaccines and just complaining about the power in the study.

29:49.104 --> 29:53.227
He didn't say anything about what they really were, and he didn't mention brandy being dead.

29:55.069 --> 29:57.851
You know, the lady that said ingestion versus injection.

29:59.206 --> 30:09.572
Would it surprise you that that guy's been in front of the Senate and now is one of the main leaders of the health freedom movement that opposes medical mandates, advocates for free speech and free choice, and wants safe vaccines?

30:09.612 --> 30:14.975
Would that surprise you or would you be disturbed, especially if it followed five years of a pandemic?

30:15.675 --> 30:19.918
2013 to 2025, how's that for a timeline?

30:19.958 --> 30:21.979
Compare that timeline to Brandy's timeline.

30:23.510 --> 30:26.453
Hey guys, we're incredibly lucky today to have Dr. Anthony Fauci.

30:26.473 --> 30:27.794
How about this timeline?

30:27.854 --> 30:28.735
Here's Dr. Mike.

30:28.755 --> 30:31.338
Allergy and infectious disease branch of the NIH.

30:31.598 --> 30:35.422
You may have seen him on stage with Trump as he's part of the coronavirus task force.

30:35.622 --> 30:37.604
He's going to be answering some of our questions today.

30:37.924 --> 30:38.685
Let's get right to it.

30:38.945 --> 30:40.027
Dr. Mike, how are you?

30:40.668 --> 30:41.268
How's it going?

30:41.429 --> 30:44.433
Running around like a maniac here, but other than that, I'm good.

30:44.853 --> 30:45.654
I can only imagine.

30:45.695 --> 30:49.840
I heard your wife was forcing you to get at least four or five hours of sleep.

30:49.900 --> 30:50.982
I'm proud of her for doing that.

30:51.322 --> 30:54.407
Yes, four hours is all I'm doing, but she's the one that's doing it.

30:55.107 --> 30:56.848
All right, fair enough.

30:57.228 --> 31:00.730
Well, first of all, let me say a huge thank you for joining us on the YouTube channel.

31:01.051 --> 31:03.752
Everyone in the YouTube community really appreciates what you're doing.

31:04.112 --> 31:09.235
My whole channel is about fact checking, putting out accurate info, and you've essentially become the face for that.

31:09.636 --> 31:12.037
So huge thanks from all of us for that.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.839
Let's start by talking about social distancing.

31:15.979 --> 31:18.881
It's something that I've explained to my audience that's incredibly important.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.923
That's how we control the spread of this virus, the run on hospitals.

31:22.523 --> 31:25.425
There's been a lot of talk recently about curtailing that.

31:26.125 --> 31:30.768
I'm curious, not so much about the date, because as you said, the virus doesn't have a timeline.

31:31.448 --> 31:37.692
What is the yardstick that we're gonna be using to measure when it may be safe to curtail the social distancing?

31:37.752 --> 31:42.835
Is it number of those who are ill, fatalities, hospital preparedness, what say you?

31:42.955 --> 31:49.880
Well, it's a combination of things and it's gonna- Okay, so first of all, let's just point out the fact that Tony Fauci

31:50.896 --> 31:54.918
There's something really strange here, and in retrospect, you can see it, okay?

31:55.058 --> 31:56.739
I want to challenge you to see it.

31:58.420 --> 32:17.929
We are supposed to believe that Tony Fauci, on March 29th, 2020, is already keenly aware for a couple months that a lab leak, gain-of-function virus, has been leaked onto Earth and will likely go endemic.

32:19.082 --> 32:21.745
and kill maybe billions of people.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.187
And they may have funded it.

32:25.548 --> 32:31.974
There may be a paper trail, includes grant applications that will lead back to him.

32:35.538 --> 32:38.821
And we're supposed to believe that this is how cool he is.

32:41.003 --> 32:44.086
That this is, you know, running around, really excited.

32:47.418 --> 32:49.860
Think about that very carefully, please.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.161
It's something to consider.

32:51.181 --> 32:53.523
I'm gonna so much that I want you to watch it again.

32:53.543 --> 32:55.164
We become the face for that.

32:55.204 --> 32:55.744
How's it going?

32:55.904 --> 32:56.885
Running around like a maniac.

32:57.165 --> 32:57.806
Task force.

32:58.006 --> 33:00.007
He's gonna be answering some of our questions today.

33:00.308 --> 33:01.088
Let's get right to it.

33:01.348 --> 33:02.409
Dr. Mike, how are you?

33:03.070 --> 33:03.650
How's it going?

33:03.830 --> 33:06.692
Running around like a maniac here, but other than that, I'm good.

33:07.113 --> 33:07.933
I can only imagine.

33:07.953 --> 33:12.096
I heard your wife was forcing you to get at least four or five hours of sleep.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.237
I'm proud of her for doing that.

33:13.578 --> 33:16.660
Yeah, four hours is all I'm doing, but she's the one that's doing it.

33:17.361 --> 33:19.103
All right, fair enough.

33:19.483 --> 33:22.987
Well, first of all, let me say a huge thank you for joining us on the YouTube channel.

33:23.327 --> 33:26.010
Everyone in the YouTube community really appreciates what you're doing.

33:26.371 --> 33:31.497
My whole channel is about fact checking, putting out accurate info, and you've essentially become the face for that.

33:31.897 --> 33:33.859
So huge thanks from all of us for that.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.443
Let's start by talking about social distancing.

33:38.224 --> 33:41.127
It's something that I've explained to my audience that's incredibly important.

33:41.207 --> 33:44.211
That's how we control the spread of this virus, the run on hospitals.

33:44.791 --> 33:47.715
There's been a lot of talk recently about curtailing that.

33:48.375 --> 33:53.020
I'm curious, not so much about the date, because as you said, the virus doesn't have a timeline.

33:53.701 --> 33:59.946
what is the yardstick that we're gonna be using to measure when it may be safe to curtail the social distancing?

34:00.006 --> 34:05.089
Is it number of those who are ill, fatalities, hospital preparedness, what say you?

34:05.209 --> 34:12.315
Well, it's a combination of things and it's gonna be different through different regions of the country because you can't look at it as unidimensional.

34:12.495 --> 34:17.779
I mean, New York is clearly different from Washington and it's clearly different from Alabama.

34:18.459 --> 34:20.761
But in direct answer to your question,

34:21.337 --> 34:22.638
you look at two things.

34:22.758 --> 34:26.479
You look at the kinetics of the outbreak when you're in the middle of an outbreak.

34:26.539 --> 34:44.306
So once it starts reaching that point of plateauing a bit and coming down, you don't want to stop the social distancing, but you may be able to relieve the restrictions on movement in order to get basic supplies to people so that they're not just locked down.

34:44.446 --> 34:49.908
If you have an area that has very few cases, what you want to do is you want to test

34:50.663 --> 34:55.185
a lot in that area to get a feel for what the penetrance of the virus is.

34:55.645 --> 35:04.088
And when you get an individual case, you want to immediately identify it, isolate it, contact trace it and get it out of society.

35:04.469 --> 35:10.711
If you do that efficiently, you may be able to open up that community because you're doing good containment.

35:11.337 --> 35:15.680
You know, the two major pillars of containment, we try to stop the spread.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.881
And the other is mitigation.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.083
When you say, oh, my goodness, it's here.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.584
What are we going to do to prevent it from getting worse?

35:22.725 --> 35:31.050
Do you think that there would be any conditions where you think politicians may act too soon and start saying, let's start opening up some of these restrictions?

35:31.370 --> 35:33.832
What would happen in a red alert type scenario like that?

35:34.301 --> 35:35.861
Well, I think that would be unfortunate.

35:35.921 --> 35:39.182
And that's the thing that we that we advise against.

35:39.422 --> 35:48.165
If you do open up too soon, you can have the perverse effect that in as it's going this way, then it starts going back up.

35:48.665 --> 35:54.907
And then you essentially compound the need for the kind of things respirators, ventilators,

35:55.655 --> 35:57.998
hospital beds, ICU, things like that.

35:58.138 --> 36:05.325
You've talked a little bit about seasonality, the possibility that this virus may go away for the summer may return in the fall, certainly not a definite.

36:05.566 --> 36:10.070
But if that were to happen, what preparations can we take as ordinary citizens for the fall?

36:10.611 --> 36:14.735
And myself as someone who's on the front lines as a family medicine doctor, what can we do?

36:15.676 --> 36:17.058
Okay, first of all,

36:18.297 --> 36:28.307
If that happens, and to be honest with you, I think it's going to happen, I really don't see something as robustly transmitted as this disappearing the way SARS did.

36:28.828 --> 36:41.901
Particularly if we start to see an increase in infections in the Southern Hemisphere, Southern Africa, places like that, now as they enter their winter, which means for sure a cycle will come back.

36:42.461 --> 36:53.928
That means that as we go down in our cases, we've got to use that time to prepare that it doesn't happen to us to the extent that it did the first time around.

36:54.069 --> 36:56.730
That's why we've got to do the vaccine development that we're doing.

36:57.090 --> 37:02.294
We've got to do clinical trials in drugs, randomized controlled trials that prove things work.

37:02.874 --> 37:04.916
as opposed to maybe they're going to work.

37:05.076 --> 37:16.306
Those are the things that we need to do, as well as get the kind of testing capabilities so that you can do good containment without waiting until it gets into mitigation.

37:16.807 --> 37:17.908
We may have a window

37:18.664 --> 37:19.785
And it's not going to be over.

37:19.826 --> 37:22.469
We're going to breathe a sigh of relief when it starts to go down.

37:22.909 --> 37:25.652
But we need to gird ourselves that it may come back.

37:25.772 --> 37:27.134
You mentioned the clinical trials.

37:27.174 --> 37:31.179
There's hundreds of clinical trials going on right now testing all sorts of combinations.

37:31.299 --> 37:33.862
First, I'm going to stop here and move this this

37:36.535 --> 37:41.101
this line over because it should be after the first peaks.

37:41.201 --> 37:44.144
It's March 29th and that first peak is like right there.

37:44.204 --> 37:53.915
So we're on the way down and that's why they're calling, they're talking like this because the first wave has been stopped by the lockdown.

37:56.079 --> 38:00.123
And now they're talking about what happens if people open up too early.

38:00.183 --> 38:04.567
So one of the questions that's really important is whether people should open up early.

38:04.627 --> 38:13.114
He's starting to throw out a lot of words like contact tracing and containment and mitigation, respirators and ventilators.

38:14.075 --> 38:16.017
And seasonality is gonna happen.

38:16.057 --> 38:17.198
It's gonna come back.

38:17.318 --> 38:18.919
He's sure it's gonna come back.

38:18.979 --> 38:20.360
It's not gonna be like SARS-1.

38:21.673 --> 38:23.594
It's too contagious for that.

38:24.135 --> 38:29.379
So we need to start randomized control trials, because that's how you know if something works.

38:30.199 --> 38:33.342
Of course, we're not going to apply that to the COVID-19 vaccine.

38:33.362 --> 38:34.322
That would be absurd.

38:34.843 --> 38:36.844
And if we do, it's going to be underpowered.

38:36.904 --> 38:40.947
And there'll be people like Brian Hooker to tell us there weren't enough people in the trial.

38:41.047 --> 38:44.470
Or even Steve Kirsch can point out that, hey, look, some people died.

38:46.596 --> 38:51.303
So we've the testing capabilities are coming up here and this guy just goes along with it.

38:51.343 --> 38:57.132
This is just unwitting, you know, this is a a a well-trained

38:57.918 --> 38:58.479
physician.

38:59.019 --> 39:01.622
And so he's not going to question any of this stuff.

39:01.642 --> 39:06.246
He doesn't have the broad background in biology to be able to question this stuff.

39:06.707 --> 39:13.193
He has been thrown as much information as his brain could handle and hold on to in the last four or five years.

39:13.734 --> 39:19.440
And this training has resulted in no understanding, only flowcharts that he can move through.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.381
and assumptions that he works from.

39:22.541 --> 39:29.684
And the assumption that he's working from, number one, being this guy is a good guy, telling him, you know, the real thing here.

39:31.545 --> 39:36.126
Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, even plasma transfusions are all on the table.

39:36.647 --> 39:39.488
I know that we don't have any randomized controlled results yet.

39:40.088 --> 39:44.070
Do you have a medication or a treatment that you think is a front runner at this time?

39:44.730 --> 39:49.692
Well, you know, we have a remdesivir trial, that we do have a randomized controlled trial, and I would hope

39:50.345 --> 40:03.031
that within the next couple of months or less, and I would say or less, we're either gonna get an efficacy signal, then we can say, well, let's do it, let it rip with that drug, or we're gonna get nothing.

40:03.332 --> 40:05.793
And then we'll say, get it off the table and stop wasting time.

40:06.313 --> 40:08.214
But I think that's gonna be reasonably soon.

40:08.934 --> 40:15.938
And also the plasma transfusions, immune globulin, those kinds of things, monoclonal antibodies, they're all gonna be going into testing.

40:16.278 --> 40:17.478
Okay.

40:17.578 --> 40:23.640
What I meant about the randomized controlled studies is that we don't have the results to those studies yet, because that's why it's difficult to pick a frontrunner.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.041
We don't have the results.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.541
The N is not big enough yet.

40:27.961 --> 40:29.582
When we get a big enough N, we'll know.

40:30.102 --> 40:30.582
Absolutely.

40:30.762 --> 40:31.602
We need them empowered.

40:31.742 --> 40:37.204
Young people, they seem to be more affected, or at least that's what the media is telling us here in the United States.

40:37.364 --> 40:38.024
Is that true?

40:38.164 --> 40:40.525
And if so, why here more than in China?

40:40.805 --> 40:41.627
That's a good question.

40:42.008 --> 40:48.425
Everybody knows that the original China data made it look like young people virtually never got involved in a serious way.

40:49.108 --> 40:59.698
Then as we start getting into Italy, looking a little bit more like us, France, European countries and ourselves, we're starting to see individuals in their 30s and 40s.

40:59.758 --> 41:04.062
Now, if you look at them, still many of them have underlying conditions.

41:04.342 --> 41:10.508
What I'm suggesting is that they only had to do it to a few of those people with supplementary oxygen.

41:11.312 --> 41:19.846
and high flow and they could kill anybody they wanted to in a few hours they would develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and then any number of paths could take them to death.

41:21.309 --> 41:24.774
In addition of course the age the expected

41:29.418 --> 41:39.723
The life expectancy in America has gone down largely due to the opioid crisis that was allowed to go bananas from 2019 forward.

41:40.423 --> 41:47.387
And even if it is a little bit curtailing now, for the last five years it has been brutal and definitely contributed to

41:48.027 --> 41:51.949
an inordinate amount of people under the age of 40 dying.

41:51.989 --> 41:57.372
And that's a significant thing that at the time we could not have seen.

41:57.973 --> 42:02.395
We could have not realized the role that it would play in this narrative.

42:02.455 --> 42:16.703
And actually, it's hard to conceive of how few of these people, these victims of supplementary oxygen would be required in order for this to create more than an anecdotal impression on people.

42:17.406 --> 42:20.527
I mean, again, these are people on the internet are agreeing this is true.

42:21.368 --> 42:26.270
Even though they're 30 or 40, they have diabetes, they have hypertension, they have things like that.

42:26.330 --> 42:32.952
But if you look closely, you will see that there are young people who are otherwise well, who can get seriously ill.

42:33.413 --> 42:44.097
So we need to forget this, that if you're young, you're good to go, you have no... Anybody can get seriously ill if they go to the hospital testing positive for COVID, maybe having a low pulse ox,

42:46.984 --> 42:48.747
and given supplementary oxygen.

42:48.808 --> 42:58.725
That's the frustrating part about all these guys that are talking smack about there being no virus, because they have no explanation for what happened to people.

42:59.875 --> 43:03.419
But people who are wearing masks can have respiratory distress.

43:03.459 --> 43:22.138
People who are using a pulse oximeter to monitor their pulse ox for the first time in their life may be unaware that their pulse ox is regularly low because of their smoking or their lack of athletic prowess or their wearing of an N95 mask for eight hours a day because the TV's told them to.

43:24.116 --> 43:34.182
If you go to the hospital complaining of low pulse ox and they gave you supplementary oxygen in 2020, you may have been murdered.

43:37.283 --> 43:41.526
And it's interesting because we still need an explanation for why people died.

43:41.566 --> 43:45.968
We still need an explanation for why people got sick, specifically in hospitals.

43:46.569 --> 43:52.132
And it doesn't seem like very many people have the simple explanation that we're trying to give.

43:52.751 --> 44:00.139
which you guys all know very well now, if, shit, sorry about that.

44:01.280 --> 44:04.463
That's just for the green screen.

44:06.766 --> 44:13.853
If antigen tests and quick at home COVID tests were bullshit in 2020,

44:16.437 --> 44:20.738
and pulse ox from masks was enough.

44:21.478 --> 44:34.100
If these two things, or even just one of the two, could get you to go to a hospital like the FLCC told you to do, go to seek treatment if you test positive or if your pulse ox is below 96%.

44:34.560 --> 44:43.802
If you sought treatment because the TV terrified you, chances are, if you were given supplementary oxygen, you might have also been murdered.

44:45.211 --> 44:52.715
or potentially murdered, had things gone south for you, that's all you need to create a pandemic.

44:52.735 --> 44:53.415
See, nothing else.

44:54.656 --> 44:57.077
Now there are ways we could enhance it.

44:57.117 --> 44:59.539
There's ways that we could make it even more foolproof.

45:00.139 --> 45:08.964
And there are proven molecular biological techniques that don't need smoke and mirrors, don't need virology, don't need any of that stuff to be true.

45:10.273 --> 45:22.246
And yet for some reason or another, this is the only channel on the internet that can explain to you that it is as simple as misconstruing a background with spread.

45:23.107 --> 45:31.176
If these tests just misconstrued a background signal or many background signals has evidence of spread,

45:33.709 --> 45:38.692
And these things could be used to justify the use of supplementary oxygen.

45:38.792 --> 45:42.354
These things could be used to justify supplementary oxygen.

45:42.374 --> 45:43.215
There you have it.

45:43.575 --> 45:44.455
Murder and lies.

45:45.556 --> 45:52.320
And do you think for one second that this is a guy who thinks that the plan is about to fail?

45:53.621 --> 45:56.943
That if he says the wrong word that somebody might figure it out?

45:58.244 --> 46:01.846
Or does this look like a guy who's absolutely sure

46:02.910 --> 46:11.577
that there's no danger to him, no danger to his family, no danger to the people around him, and that everything is under control.

46:13.798 --> 46:14.779
Because that's what I see.

46:15.439 --> 46:27.028
I see a guy who knows exactly how the narrative is going to go, exactly how the narrative is going to be kept on the rails, and knows exactly that they have enough people in place on the internet to do it.

46:27.188 --> 46:30.751
And this guy, unwittingly, is one of them.

46:32.677 --> 46:35.999
Maybe wittingly, he just likes to be a part of saving the world.

46:36.099 --> 46:37.000
Sure, I get it.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.522
I thought I was doing that too when I was screaming lab leak in 2020.

46:46.607 --> 46:50.710
Problem, there are two issues with younger people you need to consider.

46:50.730 --> 46:58.475
A, you need to avoid infection just like everybody else, not only for your own health, but even if you get trivially involved,

46:59.142 --> 47:06.051
you can be a vector that would ultimately infect someone who does have a real risk of serious conditions.

47:06.431 --> 47:17.845
It's kind of like the young, healthy 25-year-old gets infected, goes home, infects grandma and grandpa or a 40-year-old uncle who has metastatic disease on chemotherapy.

47:17.885 --> 47:18.646
That's the problem.

47:18.746 --> 47:22.509
There's been some talk about the possibility of reinfection with COVID-19.

47:22.990 --> 47:30.436
Now, do you think that this is more an issue with testing, that the test remains positive, or are they truly being infected for a second time with the virus?

47:30.796 --> 47:35.160
You know, I don't know the answer to that 100%, but I would be willing to bet

47:35.800 --> 47:47.889
on my experience, and I'll bet your experience, that any virus that you have, if you do well, recover and clear the virus, if it acts like any other virus, you're gonna have lasting immunity.

47:48.029 --> 47:49.590
You're not gonna get reinfected.

47:49.830 --> 47:56.595
Yeah, the way that I've thought about it is there's certain illnesses where you get lifelong immunity, chickenpox, measles with your two vaccinations.

47:56.975 --> 48:02.639
So maybe this won't be lifelong immunity, but to say there's none where you can- I mean, there's a nice script right there, right?

48:02.759 --> 48:03.180
Oh, sorry.

48:03.720 --> 48:04.520
I didn't mean to do that.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.200
It's a nice script right there.

48:06.360 --> 48:13.242
He's saying, let me just escape and start that again, and then I will pause the video.

48:15.862 --> 48:23.403
He's saying- Hey guys, we're incredibly lucky today to have Dr. Anthony- Literally looking a little bit more like us, France, Europe.

48:23.643 --> 48:28.564
He's saying that there were two parts of that script that I thought was really good.

48:28.624 --> 48:32.105
First of all, he said that there are certain diseases like chicken pox,

48:33.288 --> 48:38.474
where you get lifelong immunity, or from your two measles shots.

48:39.155 --> 48:44.821
So that's not really the right way for him to have said that in that context, of course, because there is a rule.

48:45.322 --> 48:50.368
If you are born before 1957, you're not even recommended to take a measles shot.

48:50.428 --> 48:50.648
Why?

48:50.728 --> 48:52.070
Because you already had it.

48:55.199 --> 48:58.601
And the vaccine isn't really good for people that had it for some reason.

48:58.641 --> 49:10.810
The primary counter indication for any vaccine was prior infection to that target, which is interesting because that whole principle was thrown out during this.

49:11.711 --> 49:16.074
If you had it, you were still recommended to get it, at least by the CDC.

49:17.495 --> 49:21.238
And so he says lasting immunity, he doesn't say natural immunity.

49:22.465 --> 49:25.708
And this guy says lifelong immunity, not natural immunity.

49:26.189 --> 49:35.036
And of course, the other side, the right side, the fake anti-vaccine movement was very focused on the two words natural immunity, natural immunity.

49:35.577 --> 49:43.043
That was Mike Eden and Ryan Cole primarily were saying natural immunity, not lasting immunity or lifelong immunity.

49:44.104 --> 49:47.888
And you see that, that is a subtle difference that is part of this enchantment.

49:47.908 --> 49:48.889
It's designed that way.

49:50.093 --> 49:55.197
countries and ourselves, we're starting to see individuals in their 30s and 40s.

49:55.277 --> 50:01.222
Now, if you look at them, still, many of them have underlying conditions, even though they're 30 or 40.

50:01.262 --> 50:04.924
They have diabetes, they have hypertension, they have things like that.

50:04.984 --> 50:11.609
But if you look closely, you will see that there are young people who are otherwise well who can get seriously ill.

50:12.070 --> 50:16.313
So we need to forget this, that if you're young, you're good to go, you have no problem.

50:16.693 --> 50:19.115
There are two issues with younger people you need to consider.

50:20.000 --> 50:27.755
A, you need to avoid infection just like everybody else, not only for your own health, but even if you get trivially involved.

50:28.422 --> 50:35.347
you can be a vector that would ultimately infect someone who does have a real risk of serious conditions.

50:35.728 --> 50:47.116
It's kind of like the young, healthy 25-year-old gets infected, goes home, infects grandma and grandpa, or a 40-year-old uncle who has metastatic disease on chemotherapy.

50:47.156 --> 50:47.997
That's the problem.

50:48.317 --> 50:54.202
I think some people are unfortunately, darn it, I, is that right?

50:56.431 --> 51:03.016
I think some people are misunderstanding the supplementary oxygen narrative and getting a lot of sand in their folds.

51:03.736 --> 51:09.460
And it's unfortunate because it oftentimes is the same people who get the sand in their folds.

51:09.560 --> 51:18.506
So please take a deep breath and try to understand that the words have meaning and concept beyond the words themselves.

51:19.724 --> 51:35.720
If you understand that there are thousands of ways to kill people once they come to a hospital complaining of low pulse ox or complaining of a COVID-19 positive test, if you understand that, then you're on the same page as me.

51:38.563 --> 51:42.447
What I'm trying to point out is that all of those other things

51:43.576 --> 51:50.863
are covered by this bullshit narrative of these people had all kinds of comorbidities, so they were easier to kill.

51:52.604 --> 51:54.226
They were easier to kill.

51:55.467 --> 52:02.953
We have a much better narrative for why they died, and we can blame it on their positive COVID test and their comorbidities.

52:04.095 --> 52:07.678
Yes, there's lots of ways to kill people, but healthy people

52:08.595 --> 52:11.236
that came into the hospital because they were scared.

52:11.296 --> 52:29.344
Young people that came in because they were scared needed a fast track to the point where they could be not treated for pneumonia because pneumonia from a virus doesn't respond to antibiotics can be done with just supplementary oxygen.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.666
One of the progressions of ARDS is pneumonia.

52:33.789 --> 52:35.910
secondary bacterial pneumonia.

52:35.970 --> 52:40.113
The whole word secondary bacterial pneumonia is so stupid.

52:42.974 --> 52:49.198
And so be very careful in trying to criticize this work.

52:50.558 --> 52:57.642
If you think that I'm not delivering this message correctly, it's time for you to get your own stream and start trying to deliver it yourself.

52:57.842 --> 52:58.283
Everybody,

52:59.309 --> 53:05.252
It's time to start making your own posters, taking your own t-shirts and selling them, doing your own work.

53:06.573 --> 53:08.233
If it's that easy, do it.

53:09.054 --> 53:17.798
Because what I'm trying to do is convince people on the left that there is a fake anti-vaccine movement and it is contiguous with this fake COVID.

53:19.514 --> 53:36.658
And none of the people in the fake anti-vaccine movement have been able to explain how easy it would be to create the illusion of a pandemic using supplementary oxygen to get healthy people on the same road as people with comorbidities in a hospital.

53:38.058 --> 53:40.059
And you don't have to do it to that many.

53:43.345 --> 53:44.787
I hope that makes it clear.

53:45.427 --> 53:48.571
I'm not saying that everybody was killed the same way.

53:49.171 --> 54:01.965
I'm saying that there is a crucial piece to the puzzle, which everyone is ignoring, that gets them to the stage where they have a pneumonia that they can say is due to a virus.

54:02.165 --> 54:04.928
They do it with supplementary oxygen or ventilation.

54:06.479 --> 54:09.201
And they did it to a lot of people with comorbidities.

54:09.702 --> 54:11.243
Yes, but also healthy.

54:11.603 --> 54:13.305
That's why they can talk like this.

54:16.727 --> 54:20.510
There's been some talk about the possibility of reinfection with COVID-19.

54:20.971 --> 54:28.397
Now, do you think that this is more an issue with testing, that the test remains positive, or are they truly being infected for a second time with the virus?

54:28.789 --> 54:45.878
You know, I don't know the answer to that 100%, but I would be willing to bet on my experience, and I'll bet your experience, that any virus that you have, if you do well, recover, and clear the virus, if it acts like any other virus, you're going to have lasting immunity.

54:46.178 --> 54:47.539
You're not going to get reinfected.

54:47.739 --> 54:54.564
Yeah, the way that I've thought about it is there's certain illnesses where you get lifelong immunity, chickenpox, measles with your two vaccinations.

54:54.944 --> 55:00.928
So maybe this won't be lifelong immunity, but to say there's none where you can get reinfected in two weeks, something seems off.

55:01.088 --> 55:03.330
No, that's inconceivable to me that that's the case.

55:03.570 --> 55:05.972
I mean, you're going to have some degree of durable immunity.

55:05.992 --> 55:06.412
You're right.

55:06.832 --> 55:10.975
It may not be 50 years, but it's certainly going to be a matter of a few years.

55:11.275 --> 55:11.456
Sure.

55:12.756 --> 55:17.498
For myself as a healthcare provider, this is something my hospital system even asked me to ask you.

55:17.918 --> 55:31.124
When is it safe for us to return to work once we've either tested positive for COVID-19 or, you know, with a lack of testing kits, had an upper respiratory viral illness where we don't know if it was COVID-19, when can we return?

55:31.184 --> 55:34.205
Is it when... Upper respiratory viral illness.

55:34.245 --> 55:36.246
You see, it's always the same bullshit.

55:36.386 --> 55:40.888
Then they are exempt from using antibiotics and they can go forward.

55:41.508 --> 55:45.053
If they need to use supplementary oxygen, they could use supplementary oxygen.

55:45.073 --> 55:47.376
They could use remdesivir to treat that virus.

55:47.416 --> 55:50.280
They could do any number of things, including send people home.

55:54.722 --> 56:10.935
I think anybody that objects to me saying supplementary oxygen is working against us because supplementary oxygen is on too many people's medical reports as the way everything started when they got into the hospital and it explains 2020.

56:10.975 --> 56:12.596
It is enough to explain 2020.

56:15.930 --> 56:32.898
It's enough to explain 2021, it's enough to explain 2022 that in addition to tweaking any knob possible, simply giving oxygen when it's not necessarily, even 80% can potentially injure somebody.

56:34.219 --> 56:43.824
And I don't think that you can discard this because doctors need to understand this or there will be another respiratory disease

56:45.367 --> 56:55.010
going through our hospitals, which will be the result of the application of otherwise ridiculous protocols again.

56:55.751 --> 56:57.871
Supplementary oxygen is not that useful.

56:59.452 --> 57:01.793
Supplementary oxygen isn't that useful.

57:02.233 --> 57:09.515
There is a plethora of a giant pile of literature about this that goes back to the mid 80s.

57:10.216 --> 57:14.177
That's the extraordinary thing about the supplementary oxygen problem.

57:16.448 --> 57:31.252
You can't discount the fact that there was a cruise ship with an oxygen plant in New York City where this bomb went off, where supposedly it was fraudulently 25,000 people died.

57:31.932 --> 57:34.433
It's a combination probably of fraud and murder.

57:35.173 --> 57:44.456
Do not resuscitate orders and all of these things, but they pushed this oxygen as a story, them running out.

57:45.302 --> 57:49.888
They pushed this oxygen story as 60 liters a minute is okay.

57:50.429 --> 57:58.520
And they had people on the internet saying it so that other doctors in the United States would not realize, not see the absurdity.

57:58.580 --> 57:59.962
I mean, everybody else is doing it.

58:00.002 --> 58:01.745
That's how they've solved it in New York.

58:05.723 --> 58:15.665
I think discounting the supplementary oxygen as explanatory for a lot of the murder or the starting point of a lot of the murder is a very, very dangerous assumption to make.

58:15.725 --> 58:21.886
Fever subsides 24 hours after fever subsides or do we do a full 14 day or 21 day quarantine?

58:22.066 --> 58:31.248
If you are a healthcare provider or someone who is in a critical infrastructure and you need to get back to work to assume that you're infected

58:31.957 --> 58:39.863
What you can do is that you can wear a mask, take your temperature daily, monitor yourself if you get symptoms, get out of circulation.

58:40.203 --> 58:43.806
If not... You are really something else there, Free Mayonnaise.

58:44.366 --> 58:48.829
I mean, I find it impressive that you work so hard to argue about this.

58:49.870 --> 59:00.778
The simple fact is, is that they had to fool doctors with the TV programs and with the social media, and supplementary oxygen was talked about by people like Pierre Kory,

59:02.571 --> 59:07.779
Kyle Seidel, Nurse Erin, all of these people.

59:08.961 --> 59:14.390
And it's the idea that you get, that you call it week AF?

59:15.757 --> 59:21.961
I think you're just revealing yourself in the same way that you reveal yourself sometimes on the soapbox.

59:22.001 --> 59:28.364
I don't understand why you're doing it, but it does not discount the fact that there are many ways to murder people.

59:29.065 --> 59:32.927
What is important to understand is that no one else talks about it.

59:33.007 --> 59:35.168
No one else mentions the opioid crisis.

59:35.248 --> 59:41.892
No one else mentions that lots of people were probably started on the road to a COVID death

59:42.864 --> 59:45.649
by just supplementary oxygen because it's dumb.

59:46.390 --> 59:53.563
Because it's easy to get young doctors that are manning an over panicked ER to do that or nurses to do that.

59:54.325 --> 59:54.806
It's easy.

59:57.042 --> 01:00:02.588
But again, you know, if you don't like how I'm presenting it, I just suggest you start your own stream or go do it yourself.

01:00:02.669 --> 01:00:04.370
I'm sure you can teach it better than me.

01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:08.715
Assume you're infected, but do it in a way where you don't infect anybody else.

01:00:08.836 --> 01:00:13.962
Otherwise, every one of our health care providers are getting exposed every day.

01:00:13.982 --> 01:00:15.243
I don't even know what...

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.319
I don't even know what ambiguous hand-waving is.

01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:20.199
It's a crime.

01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:29.845
I don't know all the ways that they murdered people, but I know one of the ways that nobody's talking about and you seem to have a real problem with me talking about is supplementary oxygen.

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:31.386
Come on, man.

01:00:32.332 --> 01:00:36.095
how to go to work, and that's- Your mayonnaise has spread over too much bread, dude.

01:00:36.615 --> 01:00:40.338
That brings me to the topic of personal protective equipment, N95 masks.

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:44.882
As recently as last week, my hospital- It doesn't prove that the therapy works, dude.

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:47.024
It proves that it was part of their show.

01:00:47.684 --> 01:00:49.245
Are you that bad at this?

01:00:50.727 --> 01:00:52.808
They made a huge show of it.

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:55.446
Wow.

01:00:55.947 --> 01:00:57.368
I mean, it's pathetic, man.

01:00:57.909 --> 01:01:03.334
I'm going to try to ignore you in the chat for a little while just because I think you're lost or something.

01:01:03.354 --> 01:01:06.076
The hospital was in need of these donations.

01:01:06.336 --> 01:01:13.143
I actually went on a journey to purchase $50,000 worth of masks myself from construction workers and was able to donate them.

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.326
Why do you think there's such a shortage?

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:20.410
Obviously, there's huge demand because we need to constantly be using these masks.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:24.895
New York Presbyterian Hospital system, they use 40 to 70,000 masks a day.

01:01:25.095 --> 01:01:30.440
But do you also think there's an issue of hoarding here or some sort of customs issue of getting these masks shipped over?

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.762
It's a combination of all of the above.

01:01:33.262 --> 01:01:39.105
So one of the things... Okay, so I think the point is made here, right, that this whole narrative is laid out.

01:01:39.165 --> 01:01:40.246
He's reading a script.

01:01:40.346 --> 01:01:41.626
He's answering the questions.

01:01:41.686 --> 01:01:41.826
It's 2020.

01:01:42.627 --> 01:01:43.207
It's March.

01:01:43.727 --> 01:01:44.288
It's funny.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:53.612
Nobody's worried that their lab leak, you know, connection to this disaster impending 7 billion people dead.

01:01:54.613 --> 01:01:55.874
He's not worried about that.

01:01:57.654 --> 01:02:00.596
He's not worried about that because that has nothing to do with the truth.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:13.567
And so the idea that we're all fired up now about Tony Fauci having covered up the lab leak and that this whole show got us fired up about that is exactly visible here.

01:02:14.868 --> 01:02:16.628
He's had two months to shit his pants.

01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:20.370
He's had two months to be terrified that his emails are going to be leaked.

01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:25.392
So if we go on, a year later,

01:02:28.638 --> 01:02:34.640
They're on again together, and they're gonna talk about it after almost all the murder's over.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:44.864
If anyone who's involved in science to say you should never change your mind, doesn't understand what science is.

01:02:44.984 --> 01:02:47.905
Well, Dr. Fauci, thank you so much for joining us on the YouTube chat.

01:02:48.085 --> 01:02:54.347
You have no disagreement, Mr. Freeman, as you haven't been able to say what your disagreement is.

01:02:55.523 --> 01:02:58.484
You haven't been able to articulate it on Soapbox.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.845
You've never been able to articulate it everywhere.

01:03:00.965 --> 01:03:06.686
Your main message seems to be that I don't listen to people, or that I don't listen to you.

01:03:06.706 --> 01:03:12.968
I don't even know who you are, but you have identified yourself very well today, and I do appreciate that.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.202
It's been a year since you and I have spoken.

01:03:17.022 --> 01:03:21.645
We're doing it now in person, without masks on, thanks to the vaccine.

01:03:22.025 --> 01:03:23.807
How amazing is that?

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:38.116
Indeed, it's really one of the most important contributions in biomedical research, to so quickly and effectively get a vaccine that right now is performing in the real world even better than it did in the clinical world.

01:03:38.136 --> 01:03:42.259
Now, look at the difference between, you think he's just two years tired?

01:03:43.562 --> 01:03:45.503
Or now is he worried about something?

01:03:46.783 --> 01:03:55.446
I think he's now worried about the fact that the effectiveness illusion is going to be broken because people haven't taken it seriously.

01:03:55.486 --> 01:03:57.166
Because not enough people have taken it.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.227
Because the lockdowns didn't work.

01:03:59.267 --> 01:04:00.707
Because the stories didn't work.

01:04:00.747 --> 01:04:01.528
Because whatever.

01:04:02.828 --> 01:04:05.349
It's off the rails already.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:07.610
And he's worried.

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:09.550
He doesn't like where they are.

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.551
Could it be because of warp speed?

01:04:13.669 --> 01:04:22.956
that we were supposed to have two years of show, pomp and circumstance, development, trials, and we don't have that.

01:04:23.836 --> 01:04:25.137
It's not happening like that.

01:04:25.878 --> 01:04:30.341
And so this sucks because, you know, I gotta say what I'm supposed to say.

01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:32.202
I gotta stay on script.

01:04:32.282 --> 01:04:42.850
Like this vaccine is the best vaccine we've ever had because, you know, in 2007, Paul Offit already wrote a book about from cowpox to mRNA.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:51.059
And so I've got to stick to the script, even though, you know, unfortunately, it's going way faster than it was supposed to.

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:54.682
And this is not going to be great for whatever.

01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:58.805
Now it's going to be even more obvious that we're using placebo.

01:04:58.825 --> 01:05:02.028
I just don't really like where this is going.

01:05:02.088 --> 01:05:05.591
That's what he looks like he's saying, which is really impressive, I think.

01:05:08.328 --> 01:05:13.230
So you feel more confident in the vaccine now than perhaps you did in December 2020?

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:14.691
Oh, yeah.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:25.596
And the reason is that in December 2020, we had the results of the clinical trials, which were very impressive, you know, 94%, 95%.

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:36.721
But often is the case is that when you get into the real world of how the vaccine performs outside of the pristine conditions of the clinical trials,

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.964
It doesn't usually look as good as it looks in the clinical trials.

01:05:41.044 --> 01:05:48.389
You keep saying that disagreeing is unfortunate here, and that seems to be your message, Freeman Ace.

01:05:48.429 --> 01:06:00.279
So what's happening in the chat, if you're not paying attention to the chat, is there's somebody that has been communicating with our community for quite some time, who's slowly kind of morphed into this dude who

01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:14.247
who complains a lot and makes a lot of people angry on Soapbox and insults people because they're not very smart and belittles them from a point of anonymity.

01:06:14.327 --> 01:06:19.391
And now in the chat, he's pretending to have some objection to

01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:31.179
to how I was oversimplifying things, I guess, and that now I'm hedging my bets with the idea of repeating in the chat that Jay doesn't like disagreement.

01:06:32.537 --> 01:06:42.385
And this is really funny because, again, this is the panic that happens when they realize that the train can't be stopped anymore.

01:06:42.905 --> 01:06:48.690
That they're not going to be able to derail it by, I don't know, getting me mad or something like that.

01:06:48.750 --> 01:07:02.041
The clear message here is that this little social media performer was put in place with a script and he will continue to follow the script just like Tony Fauci will continue to follow his script

01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:09.020
even if it's off, even if the timeline isn't lining up anymore or they're not meeting their quotas.

01:07:09.878 --> 01:07:11.779
They are gonna stay on that script.

01:07:12.379 --> 01:07:21.505
They have to, because it's been laid in place for so long, it's almost hard to conceive another way of executing it.

01:07:21.585 --> 01:07:39.455
So they're gonna continue to perform on social media and perform on social media to the point where Paul Offit will also come on this guy's stream, to where in this stream, this guy's gonna talk about how the COVID-19 shots will eventually be on the childhood schedule, right?

01:07:40.802 --> 01:07:46.213
And Tony Fauci will say, yeah, that's, that's the logical place that it will go in 2021 in June.

01:07:50.481 --> 01:07:57.023
And so this is a script, but it's moving way too fast for the people it's supposed to trap.

01:07:57.763 --> 01:08:15.428
It's moving way too fast because on the other side of the aisle in 2021, there are people in June who are just now coming out on Brett Weinstein's show to say, hey, I invented RNA and I know a little bit about this stuff and ivermectin and zero COVID.

01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:20.350
the exact same month.

01:08:22.753 --> 01:08:23.874
Might even be the same week.

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:35.909
And so this narrative was prepared so that social media could be used as a weaponized system of control.

01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:46.765
And that narrative out there has some very simple moving parts that nobody will talk about, like the PCR test, like what happens to people when they go to hospitals.

01:08:46.805 --> 01:08:51.907
That includes, but is definitely not limited to, the use of supplementary oxygen.

01:08:51.947 --> 01:08:59.949
It's also the unbelievable misuse, not using antibiotics when it's a viral syndrome.

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:02.190
Probably that's the worst one.

01:09:03.570 --> 01:09:06.251
Because, you know, old people die of pneumonia all the time.

01:09:06.331 --> 01:09:10.753
We've seen that on the screen for three years now.

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:15.275
They lost control of pneumonia for a couple years and that's probably antibiotics.

01:09:18.365 --> 01:09:22.448
So I'm going to let this play a little while longer, and then we're going to go to the big dunk.

01:09:22.808 --> 01:09:25.910
On the contrary, we're seeing the opposite now.

01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:28.892
We're seeing that when you get data, not only from the United States.

01:09:28.952 --> 01:09:36.056
I mean, when I say data, I'm talking about hundreds of thousands of people being followed up in prospective cohort studies.

01:09:36.556 --> 01:09:43.501
The data are at least as good, if not even better, not only against what we call the wild type

01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:52.244
virus, namely the one that's the standard one, but when variants appear, the vaccine seems to do quite well against them also.

01:09:52.324 --> 01:09:56.306
So it really is very good news with regard to vaccines.

01:09:56.546 --> 01:10:00.367
In this year, how do you feel where we are in our current battle with the pandemic?

01:10:00.707 --> 01:10:12.252
Overall, I think it's very positive, but one of the things that we get concerned about is- He's so terrified that people are gonna figure out that it's a lab leak that he's really barely able to talk, right?

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:23.077
He's so worried that the funding stream that led to this pandemic is gonna lead back to his doorstep, isn't he?

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:33.587
I think the only thing he's worried about is the uptake of his bullshit placebo rollout isn't going very well.

01:10:34.007 --> 01:10:37.030
And since they didn't scare them well enough to take it up,

01:10:38.618 --> 01:10:50.256
then it won't have the psychological effect that they needed it to, which is to permanently brainwash generations to come into believing that, you know, intramuscular injection's a great way to give people medicine.

01:10:50.556 --> 01:10:54.282
Transfection is a great new way to medicate people.

01:10:57.952 --> 01:11:02.135
I see a very simple show now.

01:11:02.816 --> 01:11:17.247
Because even though if you look at all of the parameters, particularly most recently over the last month or two, is that the seven-day average of daily cases continues to come down

01:11:17.947 --> 01:11:18.427
and down.

01:11:18.588 --> 01:11:24.892
One of the issues with that is if we see the numbers go down and people say, well, then why should I get vaccinated?

01:11:25.413 --> 01:11:26.934
Everything seems to be going well.

01:11:27.595 --> 01:11:28.395
That's a mistake.

01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:40.364
If you don't really get the level down very, very low, there's always the concern and the real concern, not just theoretical, that you could start getting more infections.

01:11:40.725 --> 01:11:41.946
At least in this country,

01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:50.574
We're in a very fortunate situation that we have enough vaccines to vaccinate everybody.

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:59.485
When you look at other countries where they're literally and figuratively dying to get vaccinated because they don't have

01:12:00.186 --> 01:12:00.766
Enough facts.

01:12:00.806 --> 01:12:01.987
That is a hard sell.

01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:03.887
I mean, that is a hard sell.

01:12:03.947 --> 01:12:13.550
And I think it edifies the previous point that I made that this is a guy very different than the first guy where he thought, wow, this is the show that I've been waiting for.

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:15.331
This is the performance of my life.

01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:21.793
We just kicked off something I'm so excited about doing that I can hardly sleep.

01:12:21.893 --> 01:12:24.713
My wife forces me to sleep four hours a day.

01:12:24.754 --> 01:12:26.054
Does that look like this guy now?

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:36.648
Or does this guy look like a dude who's got things are way out of his control and he's just trying to mitigate the flood, the dam is breaking.

01:12:37.128 --> 01:12:40.569
And it's not a dam breaking on the gain of function narrative.

01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:49.231
It's a dam breaking on the bullshit play to get everybody to take mRNA under the pretense of a crisis that doesn't exist.

01:12:50.874 --> 01:13:03.698
an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that is being sculpted in any way possible to create the illusion of a pandemic, including losing control of pneumonia for a couple of years.

01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:07.879
That's why he looks like this.

01:13:07.939 --> 01:13:09.899
This was not the plan.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.761
You see how the deaths go away?

01:13:14.841 --> 01:13:19.402
The deaths were supposed to go longer and then go away later.

01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:23.055
you know, when the vaccine worked.

01:13:25.496 --> 01:13:26.637
It's remarkable.

01:13:26.717 --> 01:13:28.779
I really think that that's where we are.

01:13:29.299 --> 01:13:39.286
I mean, take India has two to three percent of their population is fully vaccinated and about 11 to 12 percent have received at least one dose.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:41.889
I mean, that is not good.

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:42.509
Absolutely.

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:55.917
Unbelievable kind of narrative curation here where they're just telling stories about shortage and suffering with no evidence whatsoever, but it totally played us into the, into the hog trap.

01:13:56.477 --> 01:13:59.219
We ran face first into the cage.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.562
So where do you think this guy is in 2025?

01:14:07.284 --> 01:14:08.685
What do you think he's doing now?

01:14:08.725 --> 01:14:11.188
Do you think he's gained weight or do you think he's skinnier?

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:16.893
Do you think he's coming around to the idea that some things were done wrong?

01:14:16.933 --> 01:14:18.434
What do you think they're using him for now?

01:14:18.514 --> 01:14:25.060
Remember, after 2021, Paul Offit was on his stream three times, two times in the last year.

01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:29.524
Also, Marty McCarty was on his stream once to say how our food is bad.

01:14:31.005 --> 01:14:58.399
So a very interesting train of people have been on his show But he does a lot of nonsense and it's a lot of bullshit and his thumbnails are professionally produced I mean this guy's got investors people have invested in his brand, you know the whole nine yards and And and they have used him I'm sure he makes a great living as a content creator quote-unquote The focus of content creation is probably what we should call these people

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:02.131
And I don't, I'm not a focus of content creation.

01:15:02.311 --> 01:15:04.173
I am the content creator.

01:15:04.774 --> 01:15:08.538
That's why when I reach over and do something like this, that's what happens.

01:15:08.578 --> 01:15:13.402
And when I reach over and push another button, you know, and it's not set up correctly, that's what happens.

01:15:14.464 --> 01:15:16.125
And none of these people are doing that.

01:15:17.086 --> 01:15:19.409
None of the people that you follow are doing that.

01:15:20.269 --> 01:15:21.551
You know, Robert Malone, uh,

01:15:23.902 --> 01:15:26.983
Any of these people none of them Tucker Carlson.

01:15:27.063 --> 01:15:30.204
These are not these are you know, even Kim Iverson.

01:15:30.504 --> 01:15:49.449
We're not no No The real the real independent bright web is people like me people like Mark Kulak who do everything they do One man shows one woman shows if there are any let me know But that's it

01:15:50.236 --> 01:15:51.797
And that's, this guy's not one of them.

01:15:51.837 --> 01:15:54.380
This guy's part of the machine following the script.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.061
So where is he in 2025?

01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:57.882
Where is he in 2025?

01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:02.726
So I forgot.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:05.269
He also interviews a guy with a couple of Axe books.

01:16:05.329 --> 01:16:09.032
This would have been an interview with Paul Offit, but I didn't throw it in.

01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:12.654
He's not necessarily anti-vaccine, but he wants safe vaccines.

01:16:12.975 --> 01:16:15.658
Yeah, so I'm pointing out that I think RFK Jr.

01:16:15.858 --> 01:16:17.500
is a threat to public health.

01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:20.002
You're saying he's being hypocritical?

01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:21.084
Yeah, he's being hypocritical.

01:16:21.164 --> 01:16:21.604
Absolutely.

01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:24.127
Do you know who the number one hypocrites are?

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:25.228
Healthcare providers.

01:16:26.369 --> 01:16:29.333
The reality is, if we don't get vaccinated with Jesus,

01:16:30.714 --> 01:16:32.395
we will face God on judgment day.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:36.457
I'm Dr. Mikhail Varshavsky, better known as Dr. Mike across social media.

01:16:36.657 --> 01:16:41.941
I'm a board certified family medicine physician who makes content online, improving health literacy.

01:16:42.241 --> 01:16:44.702
And today I'm surrounded by 20 vaccine skeptics.

01:16:48.144 --> 01:16:52.547
My first claim is that anti-vaccine lies cost lives.

01:17:02.627 --> 01:17:02.907
Hello.

01:17:03.128 --> 01:17:04.309
Hello, how are you?

01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:06.952
Doing fantastic, excited to talk about health.

01:17:07.312 --> 01:17:08.854
I just had a baby, seven months old.

01:17:09.715 --> 01:17:14.280
Now this is very malevolent, but I want you to see it because it's on YouTube and it's going viral.

01:17:15.976 --> 01:17:16.837
And this is Mike.

01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:22.604
I'm not showing you his belly, but his belly is really like Peter Thiel's belly in that 2019.

01:17:22.664 --> 01:17:24.927
Not like he looks now, but like he did in 2019.

01:17:25.027 --> 01:17:27.870
It's pushing out from underneath his scrubs.

01:17:28.871 --> 01:17:34.598
And so I don't want to embarrass him, but he is looking healthier and happier and more well-fed.

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:38.833
than he did when he was wearing that blue velvet suit in 2021.

01:17:39.734 --> 01:17:52.624
And here he is sitting around what are supposed to be 20 anti-vaccine people, vaccine skeptics that are going to sit at the table and have little debates with him and he's going to explain some things.

01:17:54.272 --> 01:18:11.990
Now, it shouldn't surprise you that his explanations are weak and they're very tried, but what should surprise you is how scripted it is that they don't have real, intelligent, well-read, thoughtful people as opposition, but instead have recruited apparently the

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:24.026
the most unrehearsed, unwell-read people that they could find with very certain opinions about things or a very willingness to ask this guy questions.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:28.271
A couple of them even have a crush on Dr. Mike whatever his name was.

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:32.796
And, you know, my baby, I was like, no, I'm not getting any vaccines.

01:18:32.836 --> 01:18:34.278
The doctors came in.

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:36.480
They made me feel like a very bad mother for not doing that.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.100
Right.

01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:38.101
I was very pressured.

01:18:38.462 --> 01:18:46.790
And then I had a family friend who had a baby at the same time, was a few months in, gave vaccines to the baby.

01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:51.415
And the baby had seizures and has had seizures since.

01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:57.756
And I've also had a friend who I went on a, um, mission trip with.

01:18:58.156 --> 01:19:01.078
And this pastor was totally healthy, two, two young girls.

01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:05.340
And this pastor literally got a heart attack out of nowhere.

01:19:05.981 --> 01:19:09.963
And the only thing was he took the vaccine and there's many cases like that.

01:19:11.044 --> 01:19:14.547
Well, first of all, congratulations on the birth of a seven month old.

01:19:14.787 --> 01:19:20.172
The fact that anyone made you feel bad in the healthcare system, I feel like is a failure on us in the healthcare system.

01:19:20.192 --> 01:19:21.373
So I'm sorry that happened to you.

01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:30.381
Um, in healthcare, it's very difficult to predict the future because there are so many unknowns and there's so many- That's what I'm talking about.

01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:35.245
Look, if you see what's under here, then he's a, he's a much bigger guy than he was a few years ago.

01:19:35.305 --> 01:19:37.547
So something's not going right for Mr. MD.

01:19:38.568 --> 01:19:38.668
Um,

01:19:39.748 --> 01:19:44.150
More importantly, what I want to point out is what he's about to tell is a lie.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:55.295
And it's a lie very specifically because it's a lie that I've heard Paul Offit tell in the exact same context with the exact same set of circumstances.

01:19:55.655 --> 01:19:56.755
I have a friend.

01:19:58.016 --> 01:19:58.276
Listen.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:01.597
any variables in health care.

01:20:01.657 --> 01:20:04.399
There are things that are a lot that are outside of our control.

01:20:04.519 --> 01:20:07.641
And we try to do the best with the limited amounts that we can control.

01:20:08.541 --> 01:20:14.345
So when we see two things happen simultaneously in health care, sometimes we think they have caused one another.

01:20:14.966 --> 01:20:24.172
But unless we see a pattern of that happening over and over again on a large scale, it's more likely that this is just a coincidence of things happening at the same time.

01:20:24.952 --> 01:20:30.059
For example, I have a friend of mine who is a physician who vaccinates children.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:41.555
Understand that if, like Jason says, this woman is playing a part and she becomes kind of convinced by Dr. Mike, that is effectively

01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:45.327
a social media illusion of consensus.

01:20:45.907 --> 01:21:09.174
It is an enchantment being cast on you because if you see in her face that she seems convinced that Mr. Mike is right, then even if you're not convinced by what Dr. Mike said, your brain will still be left with the feeling of contradiction in the sense of what I think is not what these two people think.

01:21:12.639 --> 01:21:16.261
Do you understand what I'm trying to teach there, what I'm trying to coach you into seeing?

01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:36.652
Is that if she belies to the viewer any signal that she's being persuaded by the words that this man is speaking, it becomes an illusion of consensus to your brain because your brain sees two people agreeing about something that you disagree with.

01:21:38.092 --> 01:21:38.633
Do you see it?

01:21:40.213 --> 01:21:41.054
I hope you can see it.

01:21:42.346 --> 01:21:43.087
very regularly.

01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:45.429
And they were about to give a child the vaccine.

01:21:45.929 --> 01:21:48.591
And before giving the vaccine, the child had a seizure.

01:21:49.132 --> 01:21:55.197
They went on and had more seizures throughout their life and ended up actually dying at a very young age because of a seizure disorder.

01:21:55.597 --> 01:21:56.618
The vaccine was never given.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.120
Had that happened two minutes later,

01:22:00.051 --> 01:22:00.892
What do you think would have?

01:22:01.372 --> 01:22:07.116
This is almost verbatim a story that Paul Offit and several other doctors tell.

01:22:07.816 --> 01:22:12.660
In fact, it wouldn't be surprised if you have a pediatrician that's told you this same story.

01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:17.163
That's how malevolent the situation is right now.

01:22:18.191 --> 01:22:36.156
If it's okay to lie to teenagers about the reasons they shouldn't use drugs, or if it's okay to lie to teenagers about why they shouldn't have sex, it's also okay to lie to parents about why they should take or not take vaccines, because the end justifies the means.

01:22:40.174 --> 01:22:53.080
And so this is a story that I know is a lie, because there's no way that Paul Offit tells the same, that all these doctors have a doctor friend who was just about to inject and somebody had a seizure.

01:22:53.241 --> 01:22:54.201
Holy man.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:23:01.385
Been in the mother's mind and in the father's mind in that situation, other than I definitely think that vaccine caused that problem.

01:23:02.365 --> 01:23:07.448
But it could have just as easily happened before, which it did, and the vaccine wasn't responsible.

01:23:08.368 --> 01:23:09.489
So it's very difficult.

01:23:09.569 --> 01:23:13.231
This chart down here is actually two charts.

01:23:13.971 --> 01:23:21.056
It is a chart from 2019 forward and then it's a chart from 2013 to 2020 or 21.

01:23:21.116 --> 01:23:24.218
So the CDC released data and then now it's very hard to go back before 2019.

01:23:24.818 --> 01:23:26.479
So this is like my own Excel file.

01:23:26.499 --> 01:23:27.019
I don't

01:23:36.605 --> 01:23:40.007
Off the top of my head, I can't explain to you how to get data before 2013.

01:23:41.008 --> 01:23:42.409
I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:47.773
And if you find it, I would love to have it because I would too, would like to have this continuing back farther.

01:23:47.793 --> 01:23:49.113
I just haven't gotten around.

01:23:50.094 --> 01:23:54.097
Sometimes that's a long chase, but that's the explanation for where this is.

01:23:54.157 --> 01:23:55.358
It's actually two graphs.

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:56.498
They're put right together.

01:23:57.419 --> 01:24:05.785
So I'm kind of almost, you know, there's a little bit of graphics happening here because they're not on the same graph right now.

01:24:12.295 --> 01:24:16.659
Um, so my point is again, and I'm just going to kind of wrap it up here.

01:24:16.679 --> 01:24:18.061
I think it's a good place to wrap it up.

01:24:18.882 --> 01:24:27.672
Um, what you saw there is, I don't know, maybe we have to go back just a little bit and see if, um,

01:24:29.363 --> 01:24:32.464
He's not necessarily anti-vaccine, but he wants safe vaccines.

01:24:32.964 --> 01:24:38.327
So make sure you see that at started, the first clip starts with something about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.788
And he responds with, I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:41.828 --> 01:24:43.409
is putting people in danger.

01:24:43.949 --> 01:24:53.393
And so what I would hope that you can understand is that Twiv is also saying that to their hundred thousand viewers and this guy's millions of viewers.

01:24:53.413 --> 01:24:59.055
There's lots of people on the left that are now saying that it's becoming really like he's killing people.

01:24:59.764 --> 01:25:03.107
He is endangering the lives of thousands of people in America.

01:25:03.127 --> 01:25:16.699
And that's a very dangerous narrative to now curate with an obviously staged event where no useful resistance or stance is going to be made.

01:25:16.739 --> 01:25:23.605
Because again, there is a fake anti-vaccine movement in America that is improperly,

01:25:26.928 --> 01:25:29.889
dishonestly represented on both sides.

01:25:30.249 --> 01:25:40.692
There is a fake anti-vaccine movement that is dishonestly representing and represented on both sides, on the right and on the left.

01:25:41.633 --> 01:25:51.336
And that has both sides trapped in thinking about this as a useful argument and these people as significant

01:25:53.018 --> 01:25:57.422
And what that does is that it gets people like Brandy Vaughn out of your sight.

01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:03.727
It gets the real biology out of your mind.

01:26:05.169 --> 01:26:13.656
And a video like this will get anyone on the left to once again reinforce the idea that that anti-vaccine movement is nuts.

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:16.859
The idea of being anti-vaccine is nuts.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.642
And Dr. Mike makes me feel comfortable in that.

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:24.029
That's the trap they're in.

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:38.915
And the trap that the Trump people are in are the frustration with, oh man, if I could have been on this show, I would have been able to explain why Dr. Mike, that there's no freedom and that they haven't done randomized control trials.

01:26:43.288 --> 01:26:45.950
Yeah, so I'm pointing out that I think RFK Jr.

01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.793
is a threat to public health.

01:26:48.853 --> 01:26:50.274
You're saying he's being hypocritical.

01:26:50.434 --> 01:26:51.375
Yeah, he's being hypocritical.

01:26:51.435 --> 01:26:51.895
Absolutely.

01:26:52.456 --> 01:26:54.437
Do you know who the number one hypocrites are?

01:26:54.637 --> 01:26:55.518
Healthcare providers.

01:26:56.639 --> 01:27:00.663
The reality is, if we don't get vaccinated... I might have to bring it to the front.

01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:05.847
Hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna escape, resume the show and escape, and I might have to bring this to the front.

01:27:05.907 --> 01:27:07.188
Let me see if I do that.

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:09.350
Um...

01:27:11.024 --> 01:27:16.409
I'll bring it to the front because then we can skip through it a little bit and you can see exactly how.

01:27:17.495 --> 01:27:18.696
how ridiculous this is.

01:27:18.716 --> 01:27:21.698
He's not necessarily anti-vaccine, but he wants safe.

01:27:22.219 --> 01:27:32.306
Isn't it possible that there's people reporting things that after we look at it and judge it off of the VAERS system, that it is in fact not shown to be causative?

01:27:32.386 --> 01:27:35.549
And so here we are talking about the VAERS network.

01:27:36.289 --> 01:27:40.372
And who is the curator of the VAERS network on the Trump side?

01:27:40.412 --> 01:27:42.094
It is, of course, Jessica Rose.

01:27:43.001 --> 01:28:10.702
the person with five post-secondary degrees, and the surfer who recently put another picture of her toes in the Spanish Ocean because she's flying around as a Brownstone Fellow, who also flew around for five years during the pandemic with people like Pierre Kory and Jill and Robert Malone.

01:28:14.929 --> 01:28:31.781
And now they are bringing up the very issue that Epigirl from the Spars pandemic document, the same issue that Jessica Rose has been curating for five years, the VAERS system, and whether or not this has any useful information in it or not.

01:28:32.702 --> 01:28:33.643
It's pretty remarkable.

01:28:34.703 --> 01:28:36.825
But in fact, the coincidence or correlation.

01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:41.464
So yes, I would say that correlation.

01:28:41.484 --> 01:28:44.847
Actually getting the disease will give you a better response.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.009
But do you know what you have to do in order to get that response?

01:28:48.029 --> 01:28:51.972
Like get the virus in you?

01:28:52.433 --> 01:28:55.815
Correct, which means you have to have all the potential risks.

01:28:56.276 --> 01:29:03.101
All the potential risks of the virus are much worse than the risks of the vaccine because

01:29:04.127 --> 01:29:05.670
The vaccine's a vaccine.

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:06.452
It's safe.

01:29:06.672 --> 01:29:07.955
It's not transfection.

01:29:07.995 --> 01:29:12.403
This guy isn't smart enough to know what transfection is or that it could have been called that in 2020.

01:29:15.273 --> 01:29:20.456
And again, we're perpetuating this narrative, and a lot of these people aren't informed enough to understand it.

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:21.797
They go, oh yeah, that's right.

01:29:21.837 --> 01:29:30.883
I remember social media, when I was skillfully using it in 2020, told me that I had to be really afraid of the virus, that even you wouldn't really want to get it.

01:29:30.983 --> 01:29:38.268
Like, it would be absurd to think that exposure to this thing, this new thing, we would even consider it.

01:29:39.201 --> 01:29:46.082
of having severe disease, death, and largely we've forgotten how serious these viruses and bacteria are.

01:29:46.703 --> 01:29:51.704
We have forgotten how serious these virus and bacteria are.

01:29:51.724 --> 01:29:53.764
He doesn't even know his own narrative.

01:29:53.824 --> 01:29:54.944
That's really hilarious.

01:29:55.004 --> 01:29:57.905
In 2025, he is still fumbling.

01:29:58.285 --> 01:29:59.465
In the 20s, in the 50s, in the 80s,

01:30:02.694 --> 01:30:06.016
Deadliness of those diseases has been largely forgotten.

01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:09.798
One of the vaccines we give to children is called Haemophilus influenza.

01:30:10.358 --> 01:30:11.559
That causes meningitis.

01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:13.160
We don't see that anymore.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:23.286
The residents that were trained 20 years before me, every time they were in the emergency room, they learned how to do a spinal tap to diagnose this type of meningitis because of that bacteria.

01:30:23.986 --> 01:30:25.127
I've never learned how to do it.

01:30:26.013 --> 01:30:27.114
I'm not trained how to do it.

01:30:27.554 --> 01:30:32.437
Now we have to rely on interventional radiologists to do the procedure because of vaccines.

01:30:32.938 --> 01:30:40.442
It's really interesting because the Hib-Titer vaccine is not a good vaccine and the Hib vaccine is, it's bad.

01:30:40.622 --> 01:30:42.984
It's really bad, probably just a placebo.

01:30:44.225 --> 01:30:45.205
It's just terrible.

01:30:45.906 --> 01:30:52.970
So the reason why I say that vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity is because you don't have to survive the actual illness.

01:30:53.351 --> 01:30:53.631
Okay.

01:30:54.051 --> 01:30:55.213
Well, that was my question.

01:30:55.353 --> 01:30:55.634
Thank you.

01:30:55.714 --> 01:30:57.296
Appreciate that.

01:30:57.316 --> 01:30:57.637
Thank you.

01:30:57.957 --> 01:31:00.221
See, so these are not anti-vaccine people.

01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:05.890
These are just skeptics that get cleared up from talking to the great Dr. Mike.

01:31:09.878 --> 01:31:11.179
Hey, Dr. Mike Eliezer.

01:31:11.339 --> 01:31:11.659
Pleasure.

01:31:11.759 --> 01:31:12.260
Nice to meet you.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:12.980
Nice to meet you as well.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.222
I was actually binge watching your video this week thinking it was going to be you.

01:31:16.242 --> 01:31:18.484
I didn't think it was going to be you.

01:31:18.584 --> 01:31:20.265
You are very good faith, which I respect.

01:31:21.286 --> 01:31:26.949
Can I ask you a question in terms because as a vaccine skeptic, the burden of proof is on you to show that vaccines do work.

01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:29.351
So what evidence would you have that vaccines actually work?

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:35.364
So vaccines, unlike other drugs, and there have been claims made about this.

01:31:35.424 --> 01:31:36.706
See, I think this is false.

01:31:36.746 --> 01:31:38.848
And I think we've made progress from here.

01:31:39.849 --> 01:31:42.372
And I think Brandy had made progress from here.

01:31:42.512 --> 01:31:44.675
I don't think that's the right way to put it.

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:46.377
I think you should put it even better.

01:31:46.957 --> 01:31:51.603
I think you should put it to this guy to explain why intramuscular injection isn't dumb.

01:31:52.779 --> 01:31:59.680
How do you justify intramuscular injection as the application of medicine to augment the immune system of an otherwise healthy person?

01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:06.062
How does that mechanistically relate to your understanding of the immune system?

01:32:06.082 --> 01:32:06.782
You're a doctor.

01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:21.485
Explain to me why intramuscular injection's a great way to augment the immune system and try to cite some of what you understand as the organization of the immune system so that I get a better picture of where that is in your mind.

01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:25.668
See, that's a biology question.

01:32:25.728 --> 01:32:27.549
That's a biology discussion.

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:29.531
This is not a biology discussion.

01:32:29.551 --> 01:32:37.797
This is a semantics discussion or a yes or no discussion, a go or no go discussion.

01:32:38.544 --> 01:32:45.292
this in the wrong direction, where people say that vaccines aren't as tested as, let's say, pharmaceuticals.

01:32:46.334 --> 01:32:54.984
Because vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent disease, we test them an incredibly higher amount than pharmaceuticals.

01:32:55.124 --> 01:32:56.686
That's just ridiculous, of course.

01:32:57.859 --> 01:33:00.201
So that means three marks.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:05.684
We give them to children who are unable to report the consequences.

01:33:05.764 --> 01:33:18.452
We put it in a place where the consequences are much more likely to be temporarily unrelated in the mind of the patient, especially coupled with the fact that those patients are often under two years old.

01:33:18.932 --> 01:33:21.574
This is of course ridiculous.

01:33:23.186 --> 01:33:24.867
but understand what this is.

01:33:25.007 --> 01:33:27.689
This is five years of cat herding.

01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:44.120
This guy is part of the left, part of the accepted Fauci, Offit narrative, and he was put in place, curated, coached, and he is there right now, fully on board, and he has no idea how wrong he is.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:50.824
He believes everything he says because everybody around him agrees with him.

01:33:52.008 --> 01:33:55.949
The illusion of consensus extends to anyone and everyone he talks to.

01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:06.333
And so he's happy to defend it with certainty to these people who are also trapped, albeit by the other side of the trap.

01:34:06.373 --> 01:34:08.734
They're in the same trap that he's in.

01:34:11.174 --> 01:34:21.438
The Scooby-Doo narrative of a novel virus that was leaked in a mud puddle and is now all around the world.

01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:29.932
And so none of those people in that room will ever challenge him to explain why unvaccinated people are so healthy.

01:34:30.713 --> 01:34:35.638
He will never be able to explain why it is that in places where

01:34:41.403 --> 01:34:51.805
In places where it's been investigated, the simple application of vaccines leads to detrimental outcomes, up to five times worse outcomes in the children.

01:34:52.546 --> 01:34:53.406
Just one shot.

01:34:55.526 --> 01:35:03.048
And why isn't that we're not talking about the big biological idea of the difference between injecting intramuscularly versus ingesting it?

01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:11.249
That idea, remember, was from Brandy Vaughn, who was dead in December 7th, 2020.

01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:17.853
Certainly would have been a formidable opponent to the whole coronavirus narrative.

01:35:17.933 --> 01:35:32.363
She probably would have been very, very happy to tell you that it's better to get natural immunity, and natural immunity to all of these things is better, and that we get stronger when we get infected, and we make growth spurts when we get infected, which is,

01:35:33.203 --> 01:35:41.248
some of the things that she was saying that I think are kind of sketchy and probably not that much, you know, data to support these claims.

01:35:42.048 --> 01:35:46.711
And in some ways, those claims kind of undermined this main point.

01:35:46.771 --> 01:35:48.272
And I don't think that was her fault.

01:35:49.284 --> 01:36:03.528
I think that she was just so spellbound and stunned that she was the only person that was trying to get this message out, like she was trying to get it out, that she was just overwhelmed and then they got rid of her.

01:36:05.008 --> 01:36:07.269
And again, I would challenge you to compare that

01:36:08.075 --> 01:36:26.131
to the record of somebody like Brian Hooker, who in 2013 did not use the word autism, only wanted to talk about vaccine neurological damage, questioned the rationale of vaccines in general, and had 16 years of genetically modifying plants to produce medicine.

01:36:26.972 --> 01:36:42.112
And yet somehow or another in 2020, rather than being aware that this is a transfection, being misrepresented as a novel vaccine, he was more informed about the aspects of the novel virus that everybody needed to be paying attention to.

01:36:42.132 --> 01:36:44.475
He was more informed about

01:36:44.975 --> 01:37:00.384
the natural immunity idea, he was more informed about the vaccine studies being underpowered, and the worst part maybe is that he just went along with saying all of the things that he was told to say without mentioning Brandy.

01:37:02.985 --> 01:37:10.850
Even though he was in movies with her, and on stage with her, and at meetings and conferences with her for years before the start of the pandemic.

01:37:12.657 --> 01:37:17.581
People are being murdered in America at this time, and he is talking about the virus.

01:37:18.362 --> 01:37:19.883
An asymptomatic spread.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:36.837
And now, five years later, he's one of the health freedom leaders, right behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's had also a decade to do something about vaccines, and he's gonna check the adjuvants pretty soon.

01:37:36.857 --> 01:37:41.441
I think he's gonna get around to that in this term of Donald Trump's presidency.

01:37:43.183 --> 01:37:53.525
go back to ICANN, the Informed Consent Action Network, and find out that they were actually founded on this day, April Fool's Day, in 2016.

01:37:54.105 --> 01:37:59.587
And the movie Vaxxed was also released on that date.

01:38:01.907 --> 01:38:05.948
And the movie Vaxxed had a huge cast that included Brian Hooker there,

01:38:07.004 --> 01:38:10.667
and all kinds of people that we don't know and have never heard of before.

01:38:10.707 --> 01:38:13.309
The entire Pauly Tommy family.

01:38:13.349 --> 01:38:21.935
Oh there's Brandy Vaughn right there just above Dave Wakefield and Dave Weldon, the guy that Pauly says

01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:44.935
uh is going to be the head of the CDC in 2017 in a video with Brandy and then on the bus and then actually he was nominated for that in 2020 although of course his his hearing didn't happen but that's pretty interesting Stephanie Seneff is there um interesting list of characters in Vaxxed One and then

01:38:46.167 --> 01:38:54.831
Of course, in 2019, there was Vax 2, but the production crew was actually much larger than the acting crew this time.

01:38:55.491 --> 01:39:04.955
The acting crew really only had Suzanne Humphries, Brian Hooker, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jimmy Kimmel, Pauly Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield.

01:39:05.015 --> 01:39:10.438
So remember, the first movie had a huge cast of anti-vaxxers and a huge cast of parents

01:39:11.358 --> 01:39:16.260
and lots of stories to tell, and included Brandy Vaughn.

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:24.862
And after Vaxxed won, of course, you know, people tell Brandy all the time about how she presents this stuff so well, and she's such a compelling presenter.

01:39:25.342 --> 01:39:28.983
But when they made Vaxxed 2, they didn't bother to put anybody in it.

01:39:29.024 --> 01:39:31.484
They just kept it to themselves and Polly's in it.

01:39:31.604 --> 01:39:33.365
And look at this production team.

01:39:34.025 --> 01:39:44.610
Isabella Tommy, co-producer, Jonathan Tommy, co-producer, Polly Tommy, executive producer, Robert F. Kennedy, executive producer.

01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:45.430
It's interesting.

01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:54.294
It's an interesting list of people that were in the first, the scientific advisors, Suzanne Humphreys and Brian Hooker.

01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:57.756
And so, you know, three years later,

01:39:59.088 --> 01:40:03.510
Um, they, they decide not to include Brandy Vaughn and they don't include anybody.

01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:05.171
It's just them, just them.

01:40:06.032 --> 01:40:20.079
Um, and so those people are also now part of the health freedom movement, opposing medical mandates, advocating for free speech and free choice and advocating for safe vaccines, just like kind of Brian Hooker's doing.

01:40:21.425 --> 01:40:25.308
It's almost like they didn't make any progress from 2016 until now.

01:40:25.388 --> 01:40:28.891
It was always been a health freedom movement.

01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:40.240
Interestingly, in that vaxxed movie too, of course, was Suzanne Humphreys, who already had a book in 2013 called Dissolving the Illusion or Illusions.

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.623
And it was about smallpox and measles and sanitation and clean water.

01:40:44.404 --> 01:40:48.187
And the truth about flu vaccines is supposedly how she got there.

01:40:49.892 --> 01:40:56.278
But in 2018, we saw her talking with Brandy Vaughn saying that she gave up on MDs.

01:40:56.338 --> 01:40:59.801
She recommends parents talk to other parents with unvaccinated kids.

01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:03.984
She can say the unvaxxed are the most healthy in 2018.

01:41:04.645 --> 01:41:07.187
She can say it's more than just vaccines though.

01:41:07.207 --> 01:41:09.970
It's also antibiotics, but she can't explain why.

01:41:11.519 --> 01:41:14.884
or I guess you have to go to a Facebook Live and pay in order to find out why.

01:41:14.904 --> 01:41:17.908
And no needles when your kid is sick.

01:41:18.008 --> 01:41:21.573
Very similar to Brian Hooker's message from 2013 on.

01:41:22.814 --> 01:41:26.700
Ah, they gave a bunch of vaccines to my kid when he had an ear infection and that's what went wrong.

01:41:28.925 --> 01:41:32.448
interesting parallels in their narratives years apart.

01:41:32.868 --> 01:41:40.273
Don't forget that she was the primary actor of Vaxxed 2 and the scientific advisor for the movie as well.

01:41:40.714 --> 01:41:49.700
And then this year she got on Joe Rogan, started out with Cinnamon Has Vitamin C. She quoted Paul Offit about the chemistry of various forms of mercury.

01:41:50.201 --> 01:41:54.304
She said it was more than just vaccines, but also antibiotics, but still couldn't explain why

01:41:54.784 --> 01:42:01.249
And I think she said something about no needles when your kid is sick, but I don't even know, because I couldn't stand that whole two and a half hours of nonsense.

01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:03.030
Saying nothing.

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.253
Effectively saying nothing.

01:42:07.153 --> 01:42:23.025
After, from being, having a book in 2013 until now, she's basically not progressed far enough to say intramuscular injection is dumb, or RNA pandemics are ridiculous, or this was always a transfection and Brian Hooker could have told you that in 2013.

01:42:26.127 --> 01:42:47.232
that actually she could have even told you that Paul Offit could have told you that in 2007 because he wrote a book titled Vaccinated from Cowpox to RNA the Remarkable Story of Vaccines but instead she quoted Paul Offit about the chemistry of mercury in the Joe Rogan interview I mean I can't make this up

01:42:50.612 --> 01:42:54.253
And so if you think that this ends, it's all the same story.

01:42:54.313 --> 01:43:09.159
If you look at somebody like a Columbia professor by the name of Mary Holland, who claims that her son was injured by some component of the MMR and just wants vaccines tested, she was able to say that, I'm democracy now in 2015.

01:43:09.219 --> 01:43:18.302
Then she took over as part of the World Mercury Project becoming Children's Health Defense in 2018, and then helped participate in the movie Vax 2,

01:43:19.162 --> 01:43:43.655
and helped participate in the ignoring of Brandy Vaughn and the promotion of, oh yeah, Brian Hooker, the geneticist, and Polly, Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield, the foreign meddlers, who had pulled the exact same stunt, anti-vaccine stunt, to sway voters in the UK about eight years before.

01:43:46.436 --> 01:43:47.317
I can't make this up.

01:43:48.496 --> 01:43:58.718
because of course Mary Holland is now one of the heads of the anti-vaccine movement and she will recite the narrative on stage.

01:44:00.276 --> 01:44:04.682
She will recite the narrative on stage until the job is done.

01:44:19.039 --> 01:44:23.020
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.921
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

01:44:26.401 --> 01:44:30.562
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

01:44:30.622 --> 01:44:33.023
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin.

01:44:33.043 --> 01:44:33.703
I was fine.

01:44:34.323 --> 01:44:41.085
Now that, that seems like bullshit to me because I've heard her say many times that she had COVID and it was very strange.

01:44:43.148 --> 01:44:44.789
And that doesn't sound very strange.

01:44:44.869 --> 01:44:49.130
It sounds like she got it and she took ivermectin and it went away.

01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:52.291
And I don't even know how she proved that she had natural immunity.

01:44:52.751 --> 01:45:04.675
But again, as I said before, unlike Tony Fauci saying lasting immunity, unlike Dr. Mike saying lifelong immunity, these guys on this side said natural immunity.

01:45:06.872 --> 01:45:08.193
And that's not an accident.

01:45:08.393 --> 01:45:15.677
That is a semantic difference which allows that enchantment to take hold and the people that are trapped in it don't see it.

01:45:15.757 --> 01:45:25.243
They don't see that difference that those people debated natural immunity in the context of lifelong immunity or lasting immunity.

01:45:26.809 --> 01:45:28.730
You debated natural immunity.

01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:33.894
And so you're actually, we were talking about two different things and talking past each other.

01:45:34.314 --> 01:45:47.604
And so many times free speech and medical freedom are talking past mandates and biology and justifying these things because by design, they're not meant to mesh.

01:45:49.022 --> 01:45:51.463
because meshing gears gets stuff done, right?

01:45:51.523 --> 01:45:53.384
It's grinding gears that we're doing here.

01:45:53.704 --> 01:45:55.564
It's grinding gears that she's doing.

01:45:55.604 --> 01:46:07.209
If she says that she was able to travel because she had natural immunity, when Robert Malone says he took the shot to travel, even though he already had natural immunity.

01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:12.851
And those two are on the same team.

01:46:14.363 --> 01:46:21.585
part of the intellectual advisory committee that has ultimately fueled the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:21.725 --> 01:46:22.405
all these years.

01:46:22.865 --> 01:46:30.648
Make no mistake about it, Mary Holland was his original general campaign manager when he declared for president.

01:46:31.488 --> 01:46:39.450
She came back to CHD two weeks after I was hired by Laura Bono and Brian Hooker.

01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:42.531
And she's the person who fired me.

01:46:43.615 --> 01:47:12.406
It's not to say that Brian Hooker is a good guy or he's done everything right, but it is to say that there is a set of people that is behaving so obviously pro-narrative, pro-Scooby-Doo, pro-Deep State performance, and her track record from 2015 to now completely edifies that interpretation.

01:47:14.358 --> 01:47:33.192
And Mary Holland could explain why somebody like Brian Hooker with such an extensive list of experiences and knowledge could be absorbed into a health freedom movement simply because he has an adult acoustic, acoustic adult vaccine damaged child.

01:47:37.835 --> 01:47:38.836
And they can leverage that.

01:47:43.157 --> 01:47:56.403
It's a very dark place we are in because this is a fake anti-vaccine movement that has helped Trump get elected, is helping herd the cats on the right side of the political spectrum in America.

01:47:56.423 --> 01:48:06.048
And these people are as bamboozled as many people on the left are on a completely different set of enchantments.

01:48:06.148 --> 01:48:11.230
And it's a very dangerous place for our young people to be surrounded by adults like this.

01:48:17.045 --> 01:48:19.206
Because that's who Mary Holland is bamboozling.

01:48:19.246 --> 01:48:20.566
She's bamboozling adults.

01:48:21.207 --> 01:48:28.950
Kids are bamboozled by social media and adults on social media and the kids that follow adults on social media.

01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:33.212
So if we want to protect our college kids, we need to out these people.

01:48:33.252 --> 01:48:43.256
If we want to protect our young parents, we need to out these people as a fake anti-vaccine movement so that the truth can actually get out there and we can actually save children.

01:48:44.036 --> 01:48:47.357
We can save our grandchildren from being part of this experiment.

01:48:47.497 --> 01:48:57.160
Or maybe we can create a world where this experiment or it can be attempted without enslaving our grandchildren, but instead enriching them.

01:49:00.341 --> 01:49:09.584
Because if it's this valuable and this important, it has this much potential, then we ought to be able to make it so that everybody, you know, by contributing to it, by participating in it,

01:49:11.129 --> 01:49:12.170
gets a decent payout.

01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:15.452
Are we talking about universal income now?

01:49:15.472 --> 01:49:17.473
Are we talking about digital current?

01:49:17.553 --> 01:49:18.434
Oh my goodness.

01:49:19.315 --> 01:49:22.477
Sounds like they're going to get their AI the data one way or another.

01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:33.855
whether the good guys do it or the bad guys do it, they're probably going to get this data because this project has too much money behind it, too much planning behind it, too many books behind it.

01:49:33.955 --> 01:49:43.661
There's racks and racks of books that were written in sequence to curate and massage this narrative into existence where we are the sum of our genes.

01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:53.486
And so, you know, never mind what we said at the beginning of the stream, where Walt Whitman says, if anything is sacred, it is the human body.

01:49:54.554 --> 01:50:02.300
we've been led to believe that human rights are sacred, that our right to freedom, our right to choose is sacred.

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.003
No, ladies and gentlemen, the human body is sacred.

01:50:06.103 --> 01:50:08.185
Our human biology is sacred.

01:50:09.406 --> 01:50:19.994
And if we think our rights are sacred, if we think our right to choose is sacred, then we've already unwittingly given up

01:50:21.701 --> 01:50:28.624
on the foundation of what is sacred, that us, the individual, what you do with your life on earth.

01:50:28.904 --> 01:50:33.485
Because in a hundred years, everybody that's living on this planet is going to be dead.

01:50:34.766 --> 01:50:40.328
So it doesn't really matter all the stuff that you buy,

01:50:42.017 --> 01:50:46.258
all the causes that you stand for, all the signs that you carry.

01:50:46.298 --> 01:50:52.079
What matters is what you create, what you're ready to build, what you're ready to pass down to your children.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:51:03.222
And I want to pass down a true history that understands why the last 40 years have been the way they are, the last 50 years have been the way they are, and what was motivating these people.

01:51:04.093 --> 01:51:14.703
to try and assess what that data was that they would need and how to store it and how to feed it into a machine learning algorithm that would start to make predictions that they could validate about human biology.

01:51:15.323 --> 01:51:19.407
And they have been all in on this idea for a very long time.

01:51:19.848 --> 01:51:25.493
And even though it's failing, even though it's miserably failing, they're all in, they have to be all in.

01:51:27.054 --> 01:51:29.797
Because their assumption is, is that it's eventually going to work.

01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:36.667
That's why these people were put in place, why the whole coronavirus narrative was there.

01:51:37.188 --> 01:51:41.192
That's the part about it that Brandy didn't get and a lot of other people don't get.

01:51:41.272 --> 01:51:46.819
This is not about money, although that's an easy way to make things move and to make gears mash.

01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:51.153
It's a multi-generational plan that's got nothing to do with money.

01:51:51.213 --> 01:51:59.041
It's about what you can build, what you can create, what you can establish that will last into the generations to come.

01:51:59.442 --> 01:52:10.433
And these people working for the slavers understand that that motivation is very different than what you're going to do for the next three weeks or stockpiling food for the next 72 hours.

01:52:13.513 --> 01:52:23.980
That's why there's so much money out there that can, that establish so many different networks of pseudo dissidents, that none of these people are real.

01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:31.525
None of them are real because they are all essentially part of the same illusion that those individuals represent on social media.

01:52:31.565 --> 01:52:33.527
But this is how they move the money around.

01:52:34.527 --> 01:52:39.591
Substacks and nonprofits and fellows and world travel,

01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:42.751
It's all the same illusion.

01:52:42.791 --> 01:52:57.338
That's why none of these people will tell you that the only thing they have is synthetic recombinant genetics, using bacteria to make a lot of DNA, using enzymes to make a lot of RNA, has just gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.

01:52:57.418 --> 01:52:59.099
That's all they've got, nothing else.

01:53:00.134 --> 01:53:10.763
And they use that to fake virology because they can make large quantities of pure DNA and then transfect or transform cell cultures and then claim that what's happening is virology.

01:53:12.745 --> 01:53:22.873
Claim that what they are following around is virology when really, when you put DNA on a cell culture and the cell culture divides, it's not surprising to find the DNA in the cultures dividing.

01:53:24.695 --> 01:53:27.016
And yet they can use this simple,

01:53:28.115 --> 01:53:36.502
ability to create large quantities of pure DNA to do all of the bullshit that they do and call virology and call gain of function.

01:53:36.522 --> 01:53:40.966
And it's really just transformation and transfection of animals and cell culture.

01:53:41.466 --> 01:53:45.329
And that is the simple explanation for why no virus

01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.650
is a trap.

01:53:47.131 --> 01:53:54.935
Why having the opinion that there was no virus with no further explanation doesn't free our children from this narrative.

01:53:54.995 --> 01:54:01.978
It doesn't equip them to argue their way out with the retarded adults that they are surrounded by.

01:54:02.478 --> 01:54:07.521
So Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman are never going to equip young people

01:54:08.081 --> 01:54:14.310
to argue with the bamboozled adults that they are inevitably going to be surrounded by in the coming years.

01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:21.119
They will, in fact, make them unable to interact with those adults, which would be a disaster.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.922
We need to equip our young people

01:54:24.963 --> 01:54:41.313
to argue with both sides of this malevolent narrative, both sides of this trap, so that irrespective of who and what adult they come up against, they are able to succinctly describe that the only thing they have is recombinant genetics.

01:54:42.338 --> 01:54:47.700
and recombinant genetics are enough to create any PCR fraud they want to.

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:55.964
And a background signal with fraudulent PCR tests would be all they would need to misconstrue a background as spread.

01:54:57.804 --> 01:55:09.069
And this can be explained to the left and to the right and couched in the right way for the left and the right, depending on the questions that they ask, as long as you understand the foundational principle biology here.

01:55:10.515 --> 01:55:14.577
just like explaining that overcycling isn't the thing.

01:55:15.638 --> 01:55:18.539
What you need to understand is it's really, really easy.

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:20.601
They could have produced a large quantity.

01:55:21.021 --> 01:55:33.728
They could produce as much as is in this pen, and that would be enough DNA to put it anywhere they wanted to and find it in a people, in a cruise ship, in a wet market, and it would be enough to find it in all of those places.

01:55:35.854 --> 01:56:00.210
And it would be just as simple as Murray Gardner carrying the AIDS virus home in a Eppendorf tube and bringing it to Bob Gallo's lab as it would be for me to bring a very hot positive PCR signal to a coronavirus anywhere I wanted to go once it was made using the standard industrial processes available at any pharmaceutical company that makes a biologic.

01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:06.551
And so transfection is a crime and it was before the pandemic.

01:56:06.591 --> 01:56:14.833
It was only used on cancer patients and genetically deficient people and it failed every time and transfection remains a crime now.

01:56:15.374 --> 01:56:17.254
It is not an investigational vaccine.

01:56:17.294 --> 01:56:18.555
It hasn't proven its worth.

01:56:18.655 --> 01:56:29.958
The reason why you think or social media and mainstream media thinks and tells us that it is, is because in reality, they could have met and did meet any manufacturing quota

01:56:30.658 --> 01:56:31.539
with placebo.

01:56:32.079 --> 01:56:35.000
That's why that story that Tony Fauci was telling is so relevant.

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:38.983
You know that other countries are short and you know they can't get the vaccine they want.

01:56:39.023 --> 01:56:41.864
They're literally dying to get a vaccine over there.

01:56:42.325 --> 01:56:50.349
His all part of driving the narrative, get your placebo, because once you take a placebo, you're bamboozled.

01:56:52.893 --> 01:57:02.429
Once you take the placebo and then you don't get sick, once you take the placebo and you don't have a reaction, now you believe that, well, vaccine didn't hurt me.

01:57:02.449 --> 01:57:04.693
I didn't get sick from it.

01:57:11.525 --> 01:57:14.426
Endemicity is another illusion that you can attack.

01:57:14.506 --> 01:57:20.609
It's another way that you can approach this question and try to understand what endemicity means.

01:57:21.269 --> 01:57:29.793
And all of the biological assumptions that are made when you use a word like that to describe what a molecule can do or has done.

01:57:32.054 --> 01:57:33.794
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:57:33.834 --> 01:57:39.937
Nonspecific PCR tests on a background would have been enough, especially if they don't talk about 2020 where all the murder occurred.

01:57:40.999 --> 01:57:44.001
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb, RNA can have pandemic.

01:57:44.501 --> 01:57:46.622
And transfecting healthy people is a crime.

01:57:47.163 --> 01:57:53.546
You know, there was a population pyramid problem and they probably managed it really well and continue to manage it now.

01:57:54.587 --> 01:57:55.828
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:57:56.988 --> 01:57:58.629
Sorry for the interruption earlier.

01:57:58.649 --> 01:58:06.172
I think it's important to interact with you guys in the chat and make sure that I try to, you know, clear up anything that's there.

01:58:06.232 --> 01:58:11.995
And sometimes, you know, it's not, sometimes it's not possible to clear it up because people aren't interested in that.

01:58:12.035 --> 01:58:12.856
They're interested in,

01:58:14.096 --> 01:58:15.077
in causing trouble.

01:58:15.877 --> 01:58:32.728
In this case, it seems like Free Mayonnaise wants to make sure that anybody that's hearing him is gonna try to think about the possibility that Jay doesn't like disagreement, which I don't really know what the motivation is for that.

01:58:33.828 --> 01:58:42.894
But suffice it to say that we've got our work cut out for us, we've got a lot of stuff to do, and we've got it all planned out now after all this work.

01:58:43.504 --> 01:58:44.445
And so it's going to be fun.

01:58:44.485 --> 01:58:46.027
Tomorrow is a journal club.

01:58:46.047 --> 01:58:48.750
We're going to be talking about the microbiome of honeybees.

01:58:49.351 --> 01:58:54.016
And then on Thursday, we're going to have our first biology 101 lecture for the new year.

01:58:54.496 --> 01:58:55.337
I'm excited about that.

01:58:55.357 --> 01:59:02.084
And then Friday, we'll do our first weekly gigaohm biological high resistance low noise information brief.

01:59:02.965 --> 01:59:31.063
If you want to support the stream, please go to get going biological calm and find a way to support the stream Thank you very much Simon Thank you very much Steven and all these other people that are coming through in the clutch Yeah, it's it's fantastic we had another car bill this weekend which nobody ever needs to take their car to the mechanic And so when you have to go it's always you know It's just brutal

01:59:33.078 --> 01:59:37.623
Anybody living in Pittsburgh and knows a Southside mechanic that's trustworthy, that would be great.

01:59:37.643 --> 01:59:38.784
We're looking for one.

01:59:39.084 --> 01:59:43.709
And yeah, if you want to share the replay, please go to stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:59:43.749 --> 01:59:46.312
And if you want to communicate with us, go to gigaohm.bio.

01:59:46.552 --> 01:59:48.514
And we have a little soapbox there as well.

01:59:48.874 --> 01:59:49.916
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:51.137
See you guys again soon.
