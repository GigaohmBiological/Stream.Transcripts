WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:20.160
Can you give me a sound check please I

01:20.960 --> 01:25.200
Should be okay, but I just want to make sure I don't start out too quickly

01:25.200 --> 01:31.880
And respect the fact I haven't been on in a little while. I apologize for being away

01:55.200 --> 02:13.520
The latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario

02:13.520 --> 02:18.520
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario

02:25.200 --> 02:35.280
Good to see you Mark. Good to see you Pamela. I am Katniss and

02:35.840 --> 02:43.560
Suitspider first in according to my little rank here. That means you get the big money today. Well done

02:44.480 --> 02:47.360
Just send me your address and the check will be in the mail

02:49.760 --> 02:52.640
Don't let the iPad fall in the watermark. I

02:53.640 --> 02:59.520
Think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society

02:59.920 --> 03:04.240
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

03:06.680 --> 03:10.280
There is a very real difference between the people

03:11.720 --> 03:13.720
the people who are

03:13.720 --> 03:20.720
Raised in a world where they trust people they trust others and because they trust others they have a built-in vulnerability

03:21.680 --> 03:23.840
a built-in deficiency of

03:24.720 --> 03:29.960
Compared to the people who are raised in a world where they don't trust others because when you're raised in a world where you don't trust

03:29.960 --> 03:34.240
You can always learn to trust but when you're raised in a world where you trust first

03:34.240 --> 03:38.000
It's very difficult to train that person to know when to not trust someone else

03:39.680 --> 03:44.000
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

03:44.000 --> 03:50.240
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie. You know, I don't think I'm a liar

03:50.240 --> 03:55.600
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I

04:18.000 --> 04:24.440
Protect yourself at all times follow my instruction. Keep it clean touch gloves if you wish. Let's do it

04:25.560 --> 04:28.040
Sweaty bombs. This is so crazy

04:28.800 --> 04:35.360
Like these bumps. This is so crazy. I feel so nervous like what in the world man

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
You

04:54.800 --> 05:01.360
Good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

05:02.840 --> 05:04.840
This is king of biological

05:04.840 --> 05:13.680
If you have been following me for a while you are here at the top of the wave we are

05:14.200 --> 05:16.200
staying focused on the biology

05:16.400 --> 05:21.720
Don't take the beta on television or on social media and we try to love our neighbor as best we can

05:22.880 --> 05:31.040
This is how it works people contribute to my work, and that's all we're doing here. It's a viewer funded show

05:32.280 --> 05:34.280
It's a one-man band

05:34.840 --> 05:41.560
I've got a website or two a place to talk soon. There's gonna be a place where this stream will be instead of twitch

05:41.560 --> 05:48.760
I don't want to promise too much yet, but I think in a couple three weeks or less. We should be able to get there

05:51.240 --> 05:56.400
Mike Vandenberg mixed date. I'm not really sure I think maybe even in maybe two weeks

05:58.520 --> 06:04.280
But we'll see in the meantime subscribe if you can share if at all possible

06:05.400 --> 06:09.920
This work right now is being made exclusively possible by these people

06:12.040 --> 06:14.040
Greg James has been absolutely

06:15.760 --> 06:19.840
instrumental in making this happen for you and for me and

06:20.800 --> 06:23.480
It's without without Greg's belief in me

06:23.480 --> 06:28.000
I definitely wouldn't be here without the support and belief of many of these other people here

06:28.600 --> 06:33.760
None of them are small and stature in terms of what they've contributed to me and my family

06:33.760 --> 06:38.920
And I think them all very very much if you think your name's supposed to be on there probably will be if it's not already

06:45.840 --> 06:50.960
Yeah, so we'll update it about once a week we can't do it much more than that

06:55.960 --> 07:02.760
Free occupation and to try and do something at the very end ladies and gentlemen illusion is sustained only through your active participation

07:03.760 --> 07:09.200
What that basically means is that they scared you into a corner and you didn't really know what to do

07:09.200 --> 07:12.120
but but it starts with non compliance and

07:13.240 --> 07:18.400
Yes, I'm talking about those things too. You gotta just stop gotta stop completely

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
Scott

07:21.920 --> 07:28.120
Shara actually suggested we had to drop our insurance because that's that's already playing in

07:28.600 --> 07:30.280
to the system

07:30.280 --> 07:32.280
I'm not sure if I can I can

07:32.840 --> 07:37.600
In good conscious recommend that to everybody because some people have decent insurance and a good

07:38.160 --> 07:43.160
doctor within that insurance, but you do definitely need to do your due diligence and

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
Do what you can for your family

07:47.120 --> 07:53.080
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Kingo and biological high resistance low noise information great brought to you by biologist

07:53.200 --> 07:56.960
My name is Jonathan Cooley. This is the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

07:57.600 --> 08:01.200
It is 634. I wanted to be out of 18 18

08:02.280 --> 08:05.320
But I didn't make it. I'm human just like you

08:12.200 --> 08:20.760
We are still working hard to try and free ourselves from what has turned out to be almost exclusively an exercise

08:21.960 --> 08:27.040
And it is an exercise that seems to have been brought out and brought upon us

08:27.720 --> 08:32.000
by the conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits and

08:32.280 --> 08:39.000
Of our opinions and this is not just to refer to what we would now call as the pandemic

08:39.000 --> 08:44.800
but we're talking about the beginning of the planet of the apes remake we're talking about the

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the way that they have

08:48.000 --> 08:52.720
intricately woven this idea of a pandemic into different tabletop

08:53.280 --> 08:59.480
Exercises and this kind of thing and so we have been manipulated for a long time to believe that public health is a thing

08:59.720 --> 09:06.480
That vaccines are things that that diseases and global global pandemics are a thing

09:07.280 --> 09:11.320
And and this is something that hasn't been

09:13.960 --> 09:15.960
It wasn't started just in

09:15.960 --> 09:21.560
2020 and you need to really understand that if you really want to understand the full breadth and depth of what we're what we're up against

09:21.560 --> 09:25.360
and that's what I think the combination of the biology that I

09:26.360 --> 09:35.280
Sort of helped bring to the fore and the history and the people that mark you satanika and mark Gulak has done so well

09:37.280 --> 09:43.640
Archiving on his website in a way that everyone can simply look at the people and look at the connections and see

09:43.800 --> 09:49.760
Who worked with who and who taught who and where these ideas originated and then see how how?

09:50.760 --> 09:59.000
Desecrated the the sacred biology is becoming very very rapidly as we move move through the pandemic into the next phase of whatever this is

10:00.800 --> 10:06.000
I'm gonna shift down here to the bottom one of the things that again, I like to bring up a lot is that

10:06.840 --> 10:14.320
the intellectual dark web was a group of people that was placed before the pandemic positioned before the pandemic it was like a

10:15.040 --> 10:19.160
Sort of test run of how if we yell in this tube over here

10:19.160 --> 10:21.120
You know, can we hear it in that tube over there?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
Or can we hear it in those tubes over there?

10:23.120 --> 10:30.360
And so they had already begun playing before the pandemic with people like Joe Rogan to see if we you know

10:30.360 --> 10:34.960
subtly drop a hint about this pasta in in the back of his video

10:34.960 --> 10:39.960
how many people buy it if he you know talks about the benefits of

10:40.520 --> 10:43.840
X Y and Z combination of nutrients, you know

10:43.840 --> 10:49.560
How many people seek those out as he as they're watching the podcast and can we keep track of those metrics?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.560
And of course all of those

10:51.880 --> 10:58.040
Algorithms and all of those data pipes were set in place before the pandemic on Facebook Twitter

10:58.320 --> 11:01.360
You name it and then even more cleverly

11:01.760 --> 11:09.440
Through the censorship of the pandemic they drove people to even more alternative places like like signal and telegram

11:09.440 --> 11:11.440
And who knows who has the backdoor to those?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.560
platforms, but you can almost

11:15.200 --> 11:19.960
It's almost without a doubt that each one of those platforms has a backdoor. Otherwise they may

11:20.400 --> 11:32.200
You could argue not even be allowed to exist because of this because of the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses being an important element of democratic society

11:32.200 --> 11:40.960
In fact, I would argue that in the pandemic it has been the single most important part of the execution of the pandemic the controlling of

11:41.800 --> 11:49.960
People's minds and people's attention and more importantly what questions they were asking did not allow anyone to exercise

11:50.160 --> 11:53.200
Informed consent because we were arguing about the wrong things

11:53.280 --> 12:00.040
We were curious about the wrong things we wanted the answers to the wrong questions and therefore even when we got our answers

12:00.120 --> 12:05.200
we were bamboozled into believing we were exercising informed consent when we were not and

12:06.160 --> 12:13.440
At the very base of this is the idea that there was a novel pathogen that no one had any

12:13.600 --> 12:20.720
Previous immunity to and therefore we all needed to worry, you know, is it gonna be me that has the bad reaction?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.720
Is it gonna be me?

12:23.760 --> 12:25.760
The worst case scenario

12:26.080 --> 12:30.000
That there is a very real difference between the people

12:31.440 --> 12:36.920
The people who are raised in a world where they trust people they trust others and

12:37.720 --> 12:43.520
Because they trust others they have a built-in vulnerability a built-in deficiency of

12:44.480 --> 12:49.680
Compared to the people who are raised in a world where they don't trust others because when you're raised in a world where you don't trust

12:49.680 --> 12:53.960
You can always learn to trust but when you're raised in a world where you trust first

12:54.000 --> 12:57.680
It's very difficult to train that person to know when to not trust someone else

12:58.240 --> 13:03.720
Now there's two things here that I want to point out the first one is is to give him a little bit of credit

13:04.360 --> 13:12.240
The whole context of this discussion is that he didn't have a perfect relationship with his parents and therefore he grew up not trusting adults

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
now in some

13:15.360 --> 13:20.480
Broad sense I have something in common with him other people probably have something in common with him

13:20.480 --> 13:26.760
If you had a parent or parents that were either abusive or left early or you know

13:26.760 --> 13:28.760
whatever disappointed in some way that

13:29.640 --> 13:37.920
Somehow is sitting in your psyche as evidence that not all adults are trustworthy and you were especially unable to find an

13:38.160 --> 13:42.000
Alternative trustworthy adult you could be pretty messed up

13:42.160 --> 13:49.360
But if you had bad parents, but you found a history teacher or a biology teacher or an older brother or something like that or a grandma

13:50.000 --> 13:55.640
That could explain to you why these people were flawed how they were flawed and despite their flaws you could trust them

13:56.200 --> 14:00.720
Then you could develop a a system and understanding for how do you?

14:01.320 --> 14:06.880
Tell when somebody is trustworthy. How do you see you you understand that people all people lie?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.800
that's the that's what he's really talking about here and

14:12.240 --> 14:15.600
The idea that some children can grow up

14:16.160 --> 14:22.840
With the idea that nobody lies is a is a that he's misleading the young with this statement right here

14:24.000 --> 14:31.080
Because the only way the only way in my imagination that someone can grow up thinking that

14:31.480 --> 14:39.920
The vast majority of people telling the truth are all around the world is if you believe that you must respect everyone's lived experience

14:40.920 --> 14:47.880
That you believe that everybody's story is worth telling everybody's opinion is worth listening to every every

14:48.600 --> 14:51.760
Every stance or or angle is a right

14:54.120 --> 15:01.600
Kind of like when somebody says that you know what about the parental rights of parents who are parents of trans kids

15:02.160 --> 15:04.160
don't they have any rights and

15:05.160 --> 15:07.160
So in this scenario

15:07.480 --> 15:15.960
Where everybody's opinion matters and where where we have to respect people's lived experience now you get in a situation where trust doesn't matter

15:16.680 --> 15:20.800
Because you're forced to take people's word. You're almost not allowed to

15:21.560 --> 15:25.880
Distrust or doubt stories or hey man, are you really being all totally honest here?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.360
That's offensive

15:29.360 --> 15:34.680
And so this is misleading the young because again, he's on a podcast here trying to be all cool

15:35.240 --> 15:39.320
You know, he's the everyday spy. He's supposed to work for the CIA

15:39.320 --> 15:46.080
And now he's revealing this on all the bros with shows about how it works and how liars work. No, he's not

15:46.880 --> 15:50.960
Because the fundamental truth is is that there are adults that are paid to lie

15:52.440 --> 15:58.360
The fundamental truth is is that our government uses lies in misdirection in order to govern us and most of us

15:58.360 --> 16:02.720
We're not aware the breadth and the depth of this the use of this technique and

16:03.680 --> 16:07.680
Most of us underestimated how much of biosecurity and

16:08.800 --> 16:15.520
Defense and in general might be ghosts and hoaxes and and mythologies to make sure

16:15.760 --> 16:20.360
That the dollars and the incentives keep flowing in the same directions for decades

16:21.560 --> 16:27.440
So that they have command over where these initiatives and attentions are placed

16:27.920 --> 16:33.520
And so he's misleading people right here. This is not being honest even though it sounds like, you know

16:33.520 --> 16:38.680
If people grow up trusting people then they're vulnerable and if they grow up not trusting people then they're not vulnerable

16:38.920 --> 16:42.360
That is ridiculously oversimplifying how this works

16:46.160 --> 16:50.760
But it's also missing this huge point of you know how the culture is now

16:51.400 --> 16:56.000
Pivoting especially with people in university and people in high school where you know

16:56.000 --> 17:02.320
The whole idea of having a debate where you can take a position that you don't necessarily believe and this is almost a lost art now

17:04.080 --> 17:08.800
And so I'm just saying it sounds simple. It sounds cool. It's totally misleading

17:10.000 --> 17:14.920
And it's everywhere on the internet, but sometimes you get moments of brilliance

17:15.600 --> 17:19.920
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

17:19.920 --> 17:26.160
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie. You know, I don't think I'm a liar

17:26.160 --> 17:31.520
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar

17:33.000 --> 17:36.560
He thinks it's really important not to be a liar. This is the guy who

17:37.040 --> 17:40.520
Just said that drastic was started by what?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
Metzel is that his name?

17:44.280 --> 17:50.520
I mean, he lies regularly on purpose because he's paid to do it. Some of the stuff

17:50.520 --> 17:57.240
He says is perfectly on target and others of it is just lies. He's lied before he'll lie again

17:57.240 --> 18:00.320
He thinks it's important not to be a liar, but he is a liar

18:01.160 --> 18:04.200
He has lied. He will lie again

18:05.960 --> 18:08.920
So none of those things that he said are lies except

18:09.640 --> 18:11.240
that

18:11.480 --> 18:13.480
That means that he's a liar

18:15.080 --> 18:21.640
And I'm getting really tired of people that are spectacularly committed to lies when they know they don't need to be

18:23.720 --> 18:27.720
People that are spectacularly committed to lies when they could just ignore me

18:29.560 --> 18:34.360
There are telegram groups with aerial photos of my old house

18:34.360 --> 18:41.280
There are signal chats that are talking about my various

18:42.280 --> 18:44.280
psychoses

18:47.560 --> 18:49.560
And for what?

18:49.960 --> 18:55.080
We're talking about those things because they don't want us to acknowledge that this is the truth

18:55.880 --> 18:57.880
That we are surrounded by liars

18:58.200 --> 19:04.680
And it only takes a spectacular commitment to this lie in order for us to get across the finish line

19:04.680 --> 19:06.680
All the other stuff is extemporaneous

19:08.280 --> 19:11.240
If they hurt some guy who's renting his house in Pittsburgh

19:12.760 --> 19:15.400
With 3,000 followers who's even going to notice

19:19.640 --> 19:27.400
And so it's they're happy to be spectacularly committed to lies about me and lies about my family lies about people who

19:28.200 --> 19:32.280
I've collaborated with like mark kulak or jessica hockett

19:33.800 --> 19:35.800
They're happy to

19:36.920 --> 19:42.600
Because they know that the algorithm and this is something that has really become obvious to me now in the past couple weeks

19:42.600 --> 19:44.520
They know that the algorithm

19:44.520 --> 19:51.480
Will allow me to see their their snide tweets and allow me to see the the snide remarks

19:51.720 --> 19:53.400
But the entire

19:53.400 --> 20:00.200
Rest of the web sees what the rest of the algorithm wants them to see eventually all of us are going to just see

20:00.840 --> 20:03.320
our own little mirror image of

20:04.120 --> 20:10.520
Whatever reality actually is and so we'll get almost nothing of the actual reality that other people see

20:13.320 --> 20:15.320
To a large extent it's already there

20:17.160 --> 20:19.560
And so with a with a wave of his hand

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
And the tap of the magic wand

20:22.440 --> 20:28.920
Somebody takes over an already well-developed military algorithm that was running a short microblog

20:30.520 --> 20:32.520
application

20:32.600 --> 20:35.000
Proports to buy it for billions of dollars

20:35.720 --> 20:41.400
Changes nothing but now has access to it and control over it. So it was well worth the money

20:42.600 --> 20:45.960
But in reality, it's still probably being run by the people above him

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
Because

20:48.760 --> 20:53.960
Because it's always been a tool of control. They're all liars. You see it's not it's not a

20:55.320 --> 21:01.400
It's not good enough to think that most of these people don't know what's going on. That's that's just not acceptable anymore

21:02.360 --> 21:08.120
It's not acceptable to think that that Tucker Carlson might be a patriot if we're just lucky

21:08.520 --> 21:13.240
He might actually be a patriot that's actually just fighting for our grandchildren

21:16.760 --> 21:23.640
That's absolutely positively wrong and we need to be aware of it. It's not a it's not a something or a possibility. They're not

21:24.520 --> 21:29.000
Alex Jones is not fighting for our grandkids. He's he's just not

21:30.120 --> 21:33.720
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away

21:34.200 --> 21:39.480
Before he made the footage from the golf cart with the with the owl on the side

21:39.880 --> 21:42.520
It's possible that Alex Jones was a good guy

21:43.720 --> 21:45.720
But not anymore

21:45.800 --> 21:47.800
A long long time ago not anymore

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
Same with this one

21:54.840 --> 21:57.560
It's just one big it's one big show

21:59.640 --> 22:01.640
And and if we don't start to see

22:02.200 --> 22:06.200
That it's one big show pretty soon if we don't see how it was done

22:06.680 --> 22:08.920
We're not going to be able to get our kids to see it

22:08.920 --> 22:14.600
We're not going to be able to get college kids to see it because in a couple more years maybe even after this election

22:16.120 --> 22:19.640
Everybody's already going to be done and moved on and they're not going to want to talk about it anymore

22:19.640 --> 22:22.440
You know like a divorce or a or a bad girlfriend

22:25.000 --> 22:28.760
And therefore we do really have a limited time and that's really what they all know

22:29.320 --> 22:34.840
We they it felt like this about six months already. We described it as they're running out the clock

22:36.040 --> 22:42.280
That's all they're doing is running out the clock team worst case scenario is running out the clock with this stuff about dna

22:42.280 --> 22:47.400
And you know getting in front of the senate and saying the same thing over and over again like we said before

22:54.920 --> 22:56.520
I won't go through this right now

22:56.520 --> 23:02.840
But teamwork case scenario was really important people in the beginning of the pandemic to get us to believe in this mystery

23:02.840 --> 23:06.520
That needed to be solved and we're still solving now today

23:07.480 --> 23:11.720
That's what this is. That's how they got us. That's how they got most of the tv watching public

23:13.240 --> 23:17.000
If you want to shock your family and friends and get them out of this

23:17.000 --> 23:24.280
These are the kinds of statements you need to say intramuscular injection in many combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

23:24.680 --> 23:26.520
And then try to explain it

23:26.520 --> 23:29.240
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent because

23:29.800 --> 23:34.040
There are hundreds of thousands of doctors and biologists that should have known the

23:34.440 --> 23:37.960
Transfection in healthy animals who was a dumb idea

23:38.920 --> 23:41.880
Would not be able to use fully augment the immune system

23:41.880 --> 23:46.760
They should have known and because they didn't say anything or didn't speak up or even worse

23:47.320 --> 23:49.320
Told people to do it anyway

23:49.320 --> 23:55.000
These people are all culpable and they had very very least oh everybody in their lives in apology

23:57.400 --> 24:01.640
And viruses are not patterned integrity is there something all of us are going to learn in the next couple years

24:01.640 --> 24:06.280
I mean, that's just inevitable. Why are they doing this? Let's think very carefully

24:06.280 --> 24:08.280
They have inverted

24:09.480 --> 24:16.600
How we think of ourselves in terms of our sovereignty and therefore they are on the cusp of being able to tell our teenagers

24:17.000 --> 24:19.960
And our college kids that have surrendering your dna

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
surrendering your medical data

24:24.360 --> 24:30.760
To the nih is just that's what you do that the how are you gonna the way to help is to give it all up

24:31.640 --> 24:33.160
And

24:33.160 --> 24:40.040
The argument that the human genome project has been making since its inception is that we have if we had enough copies

24:40.600 --> 24:45.640
If we had enough games of gold if we had enough games of chess if we had enough

24:46.200 --> 24:50.280
Examples of the human genome and the medical data that goes along with it

24:50.280 --> 24:54.600
We could feed that to an AI and the AI could learn to play chess

24:55.160 --> 25:00.040
The AI could learn to play go and the AI could learn to rearrange and fix

25:00.760 --> 25:02.760
the human genome

25:03.960 --> 25:09.400
That's the story that's the that's the game right there. All the other stuff is probably related to it

25:09.400 --> 25:11.800
But essentially that's where we are they've been trying to

25:12.440 --> 25:17.880
Transform the way we think about ourselves for the last 30 years so that they're when they decide

25:18.280 --> 25:22.760
To eventually flip the switch on this transhuman agenda this futurist agenda

25:23.000 --> 25:29.320
Which they've already kind of flipped the switch on it will be something that you can no longer resist your kids can't resist because the iD

25:29.480 --> 25:37.000
Already in place because the censorship on the internet is already in place because the the digital currencies are already in place

25:37.000 --> 25:40.440
And so when they decide to actually do it, it's already over

25:42.120 --> 25:46.440
And I don't think we have that long to stop it. I don't I don't

25:47.480 --> 25:52.040
I don't think we have that long to teach these college kids what actually happened

25:52.520 --> 25:58.200
And to apologize to them for letting them go back to college letting them take part in a year of testing

25:58.200 --> 26:00.520
letting them take shots

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
Instead of just keeping them home

26:02.920 --> 26:05.960
Letting them get a part-time job and smoke some weed in the garage

26:07.320 --> 26:09.480
With their friends, you know

26:12.120 --> 26:17.560
Because that's what that's what we should have done with our college kids not necessarily the smoking in the garage part

26:17.560 --> 26:20.920
But we should have kept them home. We should have let them get a part-time job

26:21.480 --> 26:23.480
We should have let them take a

26:23.880 --> 26:25.880
Leadership course

26:25.960 --> 26:26.920
In Wyoming

26:26.920 --> 26:29.720
We should have sent them on an internship somewhere. We should have

26:30.520 --> 26:31.960
Done anything

26:31.960 --> 26:36.360
But sent them back into the arms of people who could change their mind about stuff

26:37.880 --> 26:41.400
That could change the rules at any time that could recommend

26:41.960 --> 26:45.560
Medical procedures at any time and change their mind about them later

26:47.880 --> 26:53.400
All of these things with financial incentives behind them. Why did we let our children go back into that mouth?

26:54.360 --> 26:56.520
That the monster. Why?

26:58.920 --> 27:04.040
These are the kinds of things that we need to talk about these are the kinds of things we need to focus on none of the other

27:04.600 --> 27:10.840
None of this other social media garbage matters at this stage because they murdered Americans to get this to happen

27:11.320 --> 27:13.800
That's the real truth of it that I want to get out today

27:14.200 --> 27:19.000
Is that they murdered Americans and they some I think they probably murdered other people other places as well

27:19.400 --> 27:22.760
But in America there was especially a lot of murder in order to make sure

27:23.240 --> 27:27.400
That the worst case scenario was believed that there would be numbers to put on the news

27:27.640 --> 27:32.840
And so the spread of bad ideas was much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of any RNA molecule

27:34.680 --> 27:39.960
And all the people that participated in the spread of these ideas and haven't rained it in yet

27:41.160 --> 27:43.480
Haven't put the brakes on yet

27:43.480 --> 27:49.240
Haven't gotten out of the car and said i'm done with this these people are becoming more and more culpable

27:50.120 --> 27:56.520
There is becoming less there's less and less excuse to say that I didn't know that there was I was just so fooled

28:03.640 --> 28:06.440
But our neighbors and our friends

28:07.320 --> 28:14.440
And our co-workers are being fooled right now about the pandemic potential and badcaves about the pandemic potential that's accessible in laboratories

28:14.440 --> 28:18.360
Either through serial passage or even through genetic engineering

28:20.200 --> 28:25.480
And they are already aware that the who is interested in changing the way that we think about our democracy

28:25.480 --> 28:29.720
But they believe it's under the pretense that worst case scenario is possible

28:30.840 --> 28:34.040
That we just dodged the bullet of worst case scenario this time

28:35.320 --> 28:40.120
That's why they're not totally on board would let's just get out of the un and forget this nonsense

28:40.200 --> 28:41.640
Let's forget about it

28:41.640 --> 28:45.960
They can't because the worst case scenario is still in the back of their head

28:49.720 --> 28:53.560
And it's still knocking on social media it's still knocking on pbs news hour

28:55.720 --> 29:00.680
And so we're trapped in this little paradigm right now that that badcave viruses are a danger

29:02.760 --> 29:04.360
And that you know

29:04.360 --> 29:09.080
There are people like paul off it and tony fauci telling us that millions of people were saved

29:09.720 --> 29:11.720
That would have otherwise died

29:13.000 --> 29:17.560
If we hadn't transfected billions of people and they're still not calling in a transfection

29:17.640 --> 29:23.240
No one has using the word transfection to describe the transfections

29:26.840 --> 29:30.520
And I think we can keep going on about you know, what are these people doing?

29:30.600 --> 29:34.920
But they're not they're not using the word transfection correctly. They're just not

29:36.760 --> 29:41.000
And so I think it would be instructive to just see where the state of the thing is where

29:41.560 --> 29:44.520
Where's the best place to look? You know, if you get rid of all these people

29:44.520 --> 29:48.680
You just reveal the illusion of consensus is behind it all the time. It's just there

29:50.360 --> 29:53.480
It's just there in the background. You look at social media. Oh, there they are

29:54.040 --> 29:56.840
Cool. What do they got to say? You wipe that all away

29:58.040 --> 30:02.760
And it's just an illusion of consensus. It's all those people agreeing on very specific things

30:02.840 --> 30:05.240
Even the way that they're said and when to talk about them

30:07.240 --> 30:10.360
And then amplifying each other and oh, this guy's really smart

30:10.760 --> 30:13.880
That girl knows what she's talking about. Oh, thank goodness for her

30:15.160 --> 30:16.120
I

30:16.120 --> 30:18.840
Can't wait until somebody finally listens to him

30:22.120 --> 30:25.480
And Brett Weinstein can get 50,000 followers a month

30:26.680 --> 30:29.400
And marcoolac gets like 140

30:32.440 --> 30:38.120
Jessica hockett might lose 200 followers a month. I might lose 200 followers a month sometimes

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That's how my stuff goes

30:41.960 --> 30:44.360
And i'm not worried about it. I'm not whining about it

30:44.360 --> 30:49.160
I'm saying that there is a mechanism out there that creates this illusion of consensus

30:49.160 --> 30:51.560
That's not just a bunch of people agreeing

30:52.120 --> 30:56.440
Okay, that's the thing that I would really like people to start to contemplate

30:58.920 --> 31:01.400
It's not just people agreeing

31:02.280 --> 31:07.000
It's also an algorithm that puts certain messages in front of you

31:07.880 --> 31:15.160
And makes it appear as though other people are seeing the messages that you throw out the replies that you throw out the kinds of

31:15.800 --> 31:19.400
Arguments that you see are almost neutered or invisible

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
to many other people

31:22.760 --> 31:27.720
Hidden behind see more replies or you know offensive replies or whatever it is

31:28.760 --> 31:35.000
Multiple clicks sometimes and sometimes they're just not there people like myself Jessica hockett marcoolac

31:37.000 --> 31:38.680
There are people

31:38.680 --> 31:44.440
Whose posts on the other hand come right where they're supposed to go maybe they can even click on who they want to see it

31:45.320 --> 31:47.320
Guarantee to see it

31:48.040 --> 31:53.160
They also use bots to do it so bots will follow you and then people who want you to see things

31:53.160 --> 31:56.760
Even if you don't follow them can use those bots that follow you

31:57.320 --> 32:02.360
And then when those bots retweet what they say that shows up in your feed, but you can't really connect for how it is

32:02.760 --> 32:04.760
But it's because they've got bots

32:05.480 --> 32:11.240
And so twitter is being gained and it can only be gained by the people number one who understand it and number two

32:11.640 --> 32:17.640
Who are not suppressed by the algorithm? And so those people are necessarily connected to something bigger

32:18.920 --> 32:26.680
And that's what his most revealing about twitter is that you can see the network on twitter and I think that they have overextended

32:29.240 --> 32:34.440
And I think it's they're like a read but they they're not a read they're supposed to bend like a read

32:34.440 --> 32:38.200
But they're not bending like a read they're like a piece of bamboo and they're really going to snap quick

32:42.920 --> 32:45.880
And that is really this teamwork case scenario illusion

32:45.960 --> 32:51.000
That's this idea that there was a gain of function virus the gain of function is real that they knew at the whole time

32:51.000 --> 32:55.240
That it was probably a lab leak and that's why there's so much of this variance out there

32:55.240 --> 32:59.880
And that's why it continues to evolve because of the fear and cleavage site and yada yada yada

32:59.880 --> 33:03.080
All the stories that we heard about the spike and the dangers of it

33:03.960 --> 33:06.360
It's all teamwork case scenario

33:08.760 --> 33:12.840
And I want to take another shot at explaining it because I really think it's important to

33:13.880 --> 33:18.840
To get this right and uh, it's a it's a jazz show, you know, it's a jazz show

33:19.240 --> 33:23.960
But we've got to understand the limited spectrum of debate that we are being held in

33:25.000 --> 33:28.600
We've got to be able to feel all the sides of it so that we can break free of it

33:28.920 --> 33:30.920
And

33:30.920 --> 33:34.120
So I thought chd tv might be a good place to see

33:36.600 --> 33:40.600
The sort of state of the art of where we are and and this is uh post

33:41.560 --> 33:43.400
post senate

33:43.400 --> 33:48.600
Interviews with mary holland so we're going to look at a few of these interviews and we're going to talk about them

33:48.600 --> 33:53.080
I'm going to take a little notes and we're going to see where we are with regard to the narrative

33:53.560 --> 33:55.560
So

33:55.560 --> 33:59.800
Good morning children's health defense today is monday march 4th

33:59.960 --> 34:02.200
And i'm very excited to share with you

34:02.840 --> 34:10.360
Interviews that I was able to do last monday at the briefing that senator ron johnson organized in washington dc

34:10.760 --> 34:16.520
I was able to meet with several of the people who spoke and some who did not know I do need these

34:17.320 --> 34:19.320
And I think you can find this really interesting

34:20.040 --> 34:21.960
Sorry about that

34:21.960 --> 34:26.280
Good morning children's health defense mary holland here president of chd

34:26.280 --> 34:32.360
And i'm delighted to be here with frank gaffney who will tell us about why he's here and why this is important

34:32.440 --> 34:34.440
Frank tell us who you are i'm here

34:35.000 --> 34:41.400
As the executive chairman of the center for security policy and the co-founder of what we call the sovereignty coalition of which

34:41.400 --> 34:44.520
They're very proud that your outfit is a member

34:45.240 --> 34:50.280
Uh, because you've put on a program that is of surpassing importance

34:50.520 --> 34:53.480
Uh, i'm a huge fan of senator johnson of course

34:54.280 --> 34:59.960
But also of children's health and and work that you all are doing

35:01.080 --> 35:04.920
specifically to make sure that we now compound

35:05.640 --> 35:09.640
the mistakes that were made in the pandemic 1.0

35:10.440 --> 35:13.640
specifically by that i mean that the

35:14.440 --> 35:21.080
The entity that i believe was really a driving force behind most of the mistakes about

35:21.880 --> 35:23.880
the origins the mistakes about the

35:24.440 --> 35:25.400
nature

35:25.400 --> 35:30.760
The stakes about the transmissibility the mistakes about what we should do about the cobit

35:31.960 --> 35:33.960
pandemic virus what we would call it

35:34.680 --> 35:40.600
namely the world's health organization i'm very proud to see that you're sporting the vietnamar sovereignty coalition on iron

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
And

35:42.840 --> 35:47.320
I think that we are parallelously called simply indeed three months away

35:48.120 --> 35:49.560
from having

35:49.560 --> 35:51.560
that organization

35:52.440 --> 35:53.800
Rewarded

35:53.800 --> 35:57.160
For its malfeasance not just incompetence. I believe malfeasance

35:57.640 --> 36:00.520
Personally, I think at the direction of the chinese communist party

36:01.560 --> 36:02.680
with

36:02.680 --> 36:04.120
uneventionably

36:04.200 --> 36:06.840
Hidden power, but frank, let me let me let me push back

36:06.920 --> 36:12.440
It's so clearly unconstitutional for the united states federal government to give up power

36:13.000 --> 36:19.880
To over health to a foreign organization or an international body when health has been historically at the state level

36:20.280 --> 36:27.160
Why is this so threatening because it's it clearly at some point would be found unconstitutional assuming the constitution for mates

36:27.400 --> 36:28.280
but

36:28.280 --> 36:34.600
Well, that's an assumption and what we've been watching of course including in the pandemic what boy doe

36:35.320 --> 36:39.160
Or huge erm roaches in our constitutional frame. It was as you know

36:40.200 --> 36:43.080
And more to the point what is in prospect now?

36:43.400 --> 36:46.680
I think is this idea that well, yes

36:46.680 --> 36:51.880
It may be unconstitutional but by the time some court gets around to saying so, you know

36:51.960 --> 36:56.280
And in joining it or otherwise sweet, you know blocking all of this

36:57.000 --> 37:00.040
An enormous amount of dent just where they died and then mary you

37:00.600 --> 37:05.800
Were very close to all of this so I know you were up where I'm sure most of your members are as well that

37:08.200 --> 37:10.200
What went down

37:10.520 --> 37:12.520
back in the course of

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
2020 and 2021 to

37:15.640 --> 37:17.240
was

37:17.240 --> 37:18.520
at the

37:18.520 --> 37:25.000
Instigation I would argue certainly with the advice of the world real football sensation and what

37:25.800 --> 37:28.280
you know that translated it into was

37:30.360 --> 37:32.360
medical practitioners

37:33.000 --> 37:35.560
First nurses medical institutions

37:36.120 --> 37:40.520
The health and the system industry research centers universities

37:41.480 --> 37:46.440
The governments all decided that they had to do daisery water ghee

37:46.920 --> 37:49.080
Goldville fleas I should make of the heist

37:50.040 --> 37:53.720
Well in the years the world health organization actually has the authority

37:53.720 --> 37:57.560
Heaven to it buy all of these nations to not only

37:58.680 --> 38:02.760
Tell us when we have a public health emergency of international concern

38:02.760 --> 38:06.680
But what we must do about it, right and that is with a compulsory

38:07.240 --> 38:09.320
quality to it not just an advisory one

38:10.280 --> 38:14.920
And so I'm just very concerned that that alone plus

38:15.720 --> 38:17.720
you know the surveillance

38:17.960 --> 38:21.640
Apparatuses that they're going to be putting into place plus the censorship

38:22.040 --> 38:24.520
Apparatuses, they're going to be putting in place plus the

38:25.080 --> 38:26.840
biological

38:26.840 --> 38:28.840
weapons proliferation

38:28.840 --> 38:30.680
Apparatuses, they're going to be putting into place

38:32.280 --> 38:37.240
If we don't have any time to to waste so what can our viewers do Frank?

38:37.320 --> 38:43.640
How can they support this effort to have this be off the table?

38:44.520 --> 38:52.200
It's the right question and I'm hoping that today's event will be a catalyst for both answering it and impelling it

38:52.920 --> 38:59.080
I just you know, there's a lot of details here, but just at the top line level. I've got a three-part

39:00.040 --> 39:02.200
Approach that I think would make all the difference

39:03.080 --> 39:04.440
one is

39:04.440 --> 39:06.440
for us to depart

39:06.440 --> 39:08.440
the world health organization, right

39:09.000 --> 39:10.760
secondly

39:10.840 --> 39:15.880
We should we not we must I think defund the world health organization, right?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.120
and third

39:18.120 --> 39:24.360
We must defang the world health organization. Harsh defund defanged or I like it the 3d

39:24.760 --> 39:26.760
and once you got those

39:27.320 --> 39:30.840
underway, I think everything becomes a lot more tractable

39:31.800 --> 39:34.600
Now can we do that without the support of the Biden administration?

39:34.600 --> 39:39.320
Which is in fact, as you know prime clover behind all of this it remains to be seen

39:39.320 --> 39:42.600
but I just have to say, Mary, in the space of just the past few days

39:44.120 --> 39:46.120
capped by this particular event

39:46.680 --> 39:53.560
I think there's a new impetus behind all of this people are becoming aware and people are becoming engaged super

39:53.800 --> 39:55.960
Thank you so much, Mr. Gaffney. Oh, bless her

39:57.400 --> 40:00.680
Okay, hold on. Let me get this camera running and see if I can get this this

40:02.440 --> 40:04.440
This up here

40:05.560 --> 40:07.560
Yes, great

40:07.640 --> 40:10.040
So senator ron johnson's little meeting here

40:10.040 --> 40:14.200
The first one we're talking about is a guy by the name of frank working for the center of security

40:14.680 --> 40:16.680
Center for security policy

40:16.680 --> 40:18.680
CHD is a member of their coalition

40:18.760 --> 40:22.520
They oppose the who the who caused these entities to behave incorrectly

40:23.080 --> 40:30.120
So he seemed to state that other governments and whatever behaved the way they behaved because the who declared a pandemic and so

40:30.840 --> 40:32.840
It is the who's fault

40:33.320 --> 40:35.800
To a certain extent, I don't think he's wrong. I just

40:36.760 --> 40:42.920
I don't think we should absolve any of these people in leadership positions from having not pulled the plug on this

40:43.240 --> 40:44.360
Operation

40:44.360 --> 40:46.840
Any of these people could have stopped it

40:47.240 --> 40:50.360
But none of them did and I think that means that they are all

40:50.920 --> 40:55.800
disqualified from leading in the future if you really believe that what we did was incorrect

40:55.800 --> 41:03.800
So he says depart the who defund the who defang the who why don't we just leave the un

41:04.760 --> 41:07.480
Because the un is actually the who

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
And so why don't we leave the un?

41:11.160 --> 41:13.160
No one wants to say that

41:13.640 --> 41:17.320
I find it strange. Maybe it's because it's unrealistic. I don't know

41:18.040 --> 41:19.560
But to me

41:19.560 --> 41:22.280
I agree with the this whole business here

41:22.280 --> 41:28.120
But again after all that talk that guy was an american and we didn't talk about the prep act being

41:28.600 --> 41:34.440
Struck and we didn't talk about the back scene act from 1986, you know being

41:35.400 --> 41:38.920
Restored to its original status. We didn't talk about any

41:39.560 --> 41:41.800
Real solutions in america, right?

41:41.800 --> 41:49.640
We're talking about dealing with an international organization run by you know international people that we have very little control over other

41:49.640 --> 41:53.880
Than writing checks and he already got through saying that we don't even write the biggest check

41:53.880 --> 41:58.680
And even if we stop it doesn't seem to matter they'll get out there get their money from other places

41:58.760 --> 42:00.840
And if we still go along with it, then who cares?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.120
And so this is really

42:04.440 --> 42:10.520
It feels disingenuous. I guess I also saw in the chat that he's been on the ban in war room quite a few times

42:10.600 --> 42:15.960
So that's a for me. That's a pretty big red flag. I don't know what to say about that. Okay. Let's uh

42:16.600 --> 42:18.840
Let's do the next guest. Here we go

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
So

42:21.000 --> 42:26.120
Tell us a little bit about what you're going to be saying to this briefing that senator johnson's put together

42:26.360 --> 42:30.520
So we'll be discussing the dna contamination that what you found inside the m&r

42:30.760 --> 42:37.800
Vaccines and what implications that may have for the quality of the vaccines and any sort of clinical side effects that they may present

42:38.920 --> 42:41.560
What are you finding in your research on the vaccine?

42:42.120 --> 42:45.560
The dna contamination is actually quite varied lot to lot

42:45.640 --> 42:51.240
We have seen some that have ct scores, which is a pcr score people may be familiar with from covet testing

42:51.720 --> 42:53.720
Um that are as low as 12 and 13

42:54.280 --> 43:00.120
Covet testing you may have been deemed positive at 35, which is a a million fold less rna

43:00.120 --> 43:03.240
Then what they're finding in the shot says as a contaminant that's injected

43:03.960 --> 43:10.280
Uh, we're also finding that there are fragments of dna in there that are active inside of a million cells very recently

43:10.360 --> 43:17.880
We have we have transfected these things into the million cells and we can see some evidence that the dna is getting replicated in the cell

43:18.520 --> 43:24.280
Um, so that's a big deal because in the past we thought, well, maybe the dna it'll get destroyed as it goes into the cell

43:24.440 --> 43:30.280
What we're seeing now is there's evidence that actually it's it's growing in number when it gets into the cell for brief periods of time

43:30.840 --> 43:37.080
Uh, and it is surviving several passages of cells. So we take cells and transfect them with the vaccines

43:37.400 --> 43:39.240
Um, this is work that will least done over in germany

43:39.640 --> 43:43.240
Um, the cells express spike protein. We can see that with the amino histochemistry

43:43.720 --> 43:48.280
You then take a portion of those cells and regrow them in another flask for like another three to six days

43:48.840 --> 43:52.920
And uh and measure again and we can see rna and dna from the vaccines still

43:53.560 --> 43:58.200
Now correct me if i'm wrong, but we were all told that there could be no dna integration. Isn't that right?

43:58.440 --> 44:04.680
We're told several things we were told. Um, it wouldn't last long. We were told this dna contamination wouldn't get into the cells

44:04.680 --> 44:08.920
That's wrong. We were told if it did get into cells it would disappear and never get into the nucleus

44:09.560 --> 44:11.400
Now we're finding all of those things were wrong

44:11.800 --> 44:15.480
Uh, now we're beginning to look at whether it's getting into the nucleus right now

44:15.800 --> 44:17.640
By looking for dna integration

44:17.640 --> 44:21.080
We have some very preliminary evidence that needs to be verified with longer reads

44:21.080 --> 44:26.520
But we can find pieces of dna from the spike sequence in the vaccine that is fused with chromosome 12

44:26.920 --> 44:28.280
And chromosome nine

44:28.280 --> 44:34.440
What we don't know is whether it is actually in the chromosome or whether this is some type of extra chromosomal thing going on

44:34.600 --> 44:38.120
And we did this all with cancer cell lines and the this is a key part

44:38.120 --> 44:41.240
So listen to this carefully. They did this all with cancer cell lines

44:41.240 --> 44:44.600
So he's going to tell you why that's a problem problem with cancer cell lines

44:45.000 --> 44:49.240
Is they go through a process known as chromophrypsis, which is like the genome shatters a little bit

44:49.640 --> 44:53.000
Some pieces of dna don't get carried on to the next generation

44:53.480 --> 44:58.840
Uh, and it so we we don't know whether our dna is integrated to the actual chromosome or whether it is something that's a

44:59.480 --> 45:03.080
An extra chromosomal mess that might get eliminated. So

45:03.720 --> 45:10.200
So so that's a pretty big deal. I'm not saying that I'm going to argue about it now what that means for the signal

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
But if we go to the tape

45:15.240 --> 45:18.600
What we basically have is there are dna in the vaccines

45:20.040 --> 45:27.240
She used the phrase. What did you find in your research on the vaccines? I guess this should be one stroke here

45:28.120 --> 45:31.800
Um, so like two or three or four or five times

45:31.880 --> 45:36.200
They repeated the word vaccines here and the only time he used the word

45:36.660 --> 45:40.200
Transfection was when he said we transfected these into cell culture

45:42.200 --> 45:47.000
All the other times that they refer to it in this interview, they're going to talk about it as a vaccine

45:47.000 --> 45:51.400
They're not going to call it transfection unless it's in a cell culture now. I would

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I would argue that's not helping

45:55.560 --> 46:00.440
I would argue that we're missing a huge opportunity here for somebody like kevin mccurn and somebody with

46:01.000 --> 46:05.960
The the pedigree and the background and the authority to say you know what?

46:06.360 --> 46:09.960
These are just transfections and transfection was a very common

46:10.760 --> 46:15.400
A common methodology used on the academic bench for at least the last decade and a half

46:15.400 --> 46:18.520
And it's really become ubiquitous in the last decade

46:19.480 --> 46:22.600
We're almost every laboratory no matter what experiment they're doing

46:23.000 --> 46:27.240
In vitro or in vivo somewhere along the line they're going to transfect something with something

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And so why not open with that?

46:33.000 --> 46:39.480
Because then we would get to the truth and with the justice much faster because we would be plain and and simple

46:40.040 --> 46:44.600
There's a term that they could have told you in 2020

46:45.080 --> 46:50.360
Which would have led all of us to probably make a very different decision at least have a very different impression

46:51.000 --> 46:54.360
On the unknown nature of transfection in healthy humans

46:55.320 --> 47:01.160
And yet somehow or another we only are using the word transfected in cell culture to

47:01.720 --> 47:09.880
Somehow imply that the word transfection is really specific for a laboratory preparation or for for in vitro work. It's not

47:11.400 --> 47:15.960
When you use RNA to express a protein in a living animal, it's called

47:16.920 --> 47:20.440
Transfection if you put it in a lipid nanoparticle, it's called

47:20.520 --> 47:25.080
Transfection if you wrap it around gold particles, it's called transfection

47:26.840 --> 47:30.760
If you use electricity, it's called electroporation, but still transfection

47:35.000 --> 47:42.200
And so another thing that got reinforced here was that PCR testing and the PCR testing values were of a certain cycle

47:43.160 --> 47:47.720
And so lower cycles being a higher signal was reinforced here

47:48.520 --> 47:54.360
Which also kind of got everybody's wheels going from 2020. Oh, yeah, that's right. They cycle to like 45

47:54.680 --> 47:56.840
And that's why there were so many false positives

47:58.680 --> 48:00.680
That's by design

48:01.160 --> 48:04.520
That's why they dropped that comment in there. That's why that comment is there

48:07.240 --> 48:14.760
And so this is very important to listen to critically and to hear it well because yes kevin mccurnan appears to be on our team

48:15.160 --> 48:17.320
Yes, mary holland appears to be on our team

48:17.320 --> 48:23.400
But there's still an illusion that needs breaking and whether they're wittingly or unwittingly caught in the illusion

48:23.480 --> 48:25.480
We've got to point it out

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
And in this case we can be pretty confident it wouldn't matter who is holding the microphone

48:33.560 --> 48:37.880
The odds of them being bamboozled by kevin mccurnan if he wants to is

48:38.600 --> 48:40.600
nearly a hundred percent

48:41.560 --> 48:47.640
I consider myself a fairly well-read biologist. I know quite a bit about basic molecular biology

48:47.640 --> 48:53.240
But if he wanted to take me to school on on the the state of the art of these things

48:53.240 --> 48:55.880
I'm quite certain that at some point I would just have to yield

48:56.920 --> 49:00.840
I don't know what that is and what that is. What that is. I don't know what that means. I don't know what you just said

49:00.840 --> 49:03.000
There it is you've done you win

49:03.000 --> 49:04.840
I get it

49:04.840 --> 49:10.440
But when we're talking about fidelity of RNA copying when we're talking about looking at the previous literature of coronavirus

49:10.680 --> 49:12.760
When we're talking about basic immunology

49:13.320 --> 49:17.800
That's not a place where he can necessarily bowl anybody over

49:22.280 --> 49:25.480
And in fact I would argue that somebody who's well-read

49:25.960 --> 49:31.560
Really well-read in immunology and knows how to argue the the pathogen or sorry

49:32.680 --> 49:39.080
The damage associated molecular patterns versus pathogen associated molecular patterns can argue linked recognition

49:39.800 --> 49:46.520
Can argue the difference between tolerance and T cells and the payer's patches and intolerance of

49:47.000 --> 49:52.520
T helper cells and and effector cells in in circulation from the lymph nodes

49:53.640 --> 49:55.640
Then that that's beyond him

49:58.200 --> 50:02.840
And so that's why we're here right now. It's fine. There is DNA in there. It's garbage

50:02.840 --> 50:06.600
That's great, but transfection and its best form and its purest form

50:07.000 --> 50:10.200
Would have been wholly inappropriate for humans and my argument is

50:10.680 --> 50:17.480
Because he started he cut his teeth on the human genome project then made a a fortune making companies and selling them

50:17.480 --> 50:19.720
patenting things and selling those patents

50:21.400 --> 50:23.080
That he definitely knew better

50:23.080 --> 50:29.160
He definitely knew that the odds of them removing the DNA from the RNA after using a process like

50:29.560 --> 50:36.520
He coli to double that DNA to copy that DNA to make recombinant DNA in a sufficient quantity to produce enough

50:36.600 --> 50:38.600
RNA to put it in billions of shots

50:39.000 --> 50:44.040
He would have known already very early on in the process that they uh

50:44.840 --> 50:46.840
That's not going to go so well

50:47.320 --> 50:55.400
They've got to be full of baloney. They can't possibly be doing it that that that didn't need this experiment to happen

50:58.280 --> 51:01.800
That's why I was confident in objecting to transfecting

51:02.360 --> 51:06.520
Healthy humans back in 2020 and 2021. That's why I was confident

51:07.800 --> 51:09.800
Because you don't need data to know that

51:10.440 --> 51:15.240
Transfection in healthy humans who was absurd. We've got mountains

51:15.720 --> 51:20.040
Infinite data from all the mice all the hamsters

51:20.920 --> 51:27.000
All the monkeys all the marmosets all the everybody that's been transfected in a laboratory. We've got the data

51:27.880 --> 51:33.880
There's not one animal model. There's not one experimental preparation where this is used

51:34.840 --> 51:37.160
As a as a you know just go on

51:38.120 --> 51:41.400
Let the animal live and keep doing experiments. That's not how it works

51:44.520 --> 51:47.320
And they know that I knew that

51:50.520 --> 51:54.120
And anyone that worked as an academic biologist in almost

51:55.080 --> 51:58.840
Any capacity should have known that

52:04.040 --> 52:08.200
All right, this is going to keep going because I think there's two people on this this interview, but this is pretty good

52:08.280 --> 52:10.280
Need longer reads to sort that out

52:10.600 --> 52:15.240
Um, but it's very concerning in that this was found. Uh, really the first time we looked

52:15.640 --> 52:18.520
Uh, which didn't so it didn't take a whole lot of effort to do this the

52:19.320 --> 52:21.160
Our collaborator sent us cells

52:21.160 --> 52:27.640
We we looked at them with qpcr throughout pastaging found some that were still positive after the second passage and sequenced and then now

52:28.280 --> 52:30.280
I'm just going to be a

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Because I didn't sign

52:33.080 --> 52:38.600
A non-disclosure agreement and I didn't take the $8,000 that was offered to me as I left CHD

52:38.600 --> 52:40.040
I don't have any

52:40.040 --> 52:45.720
Obligation not to say anything about what I know the experiment that he's describing here was set up by me

52:46.680 --> 52:49.880
The cells he got are from germany where they were

52:50.440 --> 52:58.920
Transfecting using the transfection, which is the investigational vaccine the lipid nanoparticle the Pfizer product

52:59.800 --> 53:08.120
They were transfecting cell cultures so that they would have control tissue that expressed the spike protein that they could stain and then also

53:08.760 --> 53:10.760
compare to

53:10.760 --> 53:12.520
the tissue of

53:12.520 --> 53:14.040
dead people

53:14.040 --> 53:19.080
to see what the spike protein staining looks like in people who died of

53:19.720 --> 53:21.640
the transfection

53:21.640 --> 53:27.880
And so this material being available was the perfect place to check and see if there was integration

53:29.400 --> 53:31.400
That was my idea

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
And i'm glad it happened

53:36.920 --> 53:42.040
But we're still kind of in no man's land because it's cancer cells because as he explained the cancer

53:42.920 --> 53:47.080
The the the actual genes of these cells often shatters he says

53:48.120 --> 53:54.840
And so then if there is any nuclear transport of the lipid nanoparticle and the DNA in it or the RNA in it

53:55.400 --> 54:03.240
Then in a cancer cell the integration that occurs might not necessarily be equivalent to any integration that would occur in a healthy cell in your body

54:03.320 --> 54:05.320
That's not dividing

54:05.880 --> 54:07.880
That's not immortal

54:08.680 --> 54:12.840
And so he did say that and he admits that that's a caveat, but it's not

54:16.200 --> 54:21.000
He's definitely using it as evidence for the the possibility, but we already knew

54:22.280 --> 54:28.120
That's the thing we already knew that that possibility was there and we knew there were a whole other host of possibilities

54:28.680 --> 54:30.680
That make it just as bad or worse

54:30.680 --> 54:32.680
And

54:33.720 --> 54:38.440
And so I really believe I really arguing this that this is just a red herring

54:38.440 --> 54:40.440
It's great to call attention to

54:40.920 --> 54:42.120
It's exciting

54:42.120 --> 54:47.560
But the bottom line is is that if you believe that there's DNA in the shot and that that has some significant

54:48.040 --> 54:51.960
Sway and what the outcome was then you believe that if you get rid of it that you can

54:52.440 --> 54:56.040
Adjust the significantly the outcome of a mass

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
transfection like this

54:59.560 --> 55:01.080
And that may be

55:01.080 --> 55:08.840
Possibly a significant number of adverse events and deaths due to the transfection were actually due to the DNA and that

55:10.680 --> 55:14.200
What I believe is almost certainly a misconception that even if it is

55:14.600 --> 55:17.880
It is a small fraction of what actually hurts everybody

55:18.360 --> 55:25.800
Which could anywhere be from the endotoxin to the spike protein to the to the immune system attacking where the spike protein is two

55:26.760 --> 55:31.400
Antibodies that are formed to the spike protein two antibodies that are formed to who knows what

55:33.960 --> 55:37.000
Anticell memory that's formed to those who knows what's

55:38.600 --> 55:40.600
Self antigens are not

55:40.920 --> 55:42.920
auto antigens

55:42.920 --> 55:48.840
Auto antilipid antigens we are antibodies. We don't know all the possibilities that could occur

55:49.400 --> 55:53.720
With this lipid nanoparticle mRNA transfection technology

55:54.360 --> 55:57.960
Now if it's got DNA in it, that's that's another thing

55:59.240 --> 56:01.240
But it isn't the thing

56:01.400 --> 56:05.400
The thing was at the very beginning when they murdered a bunch of people in America

56:05.800 --> 56:13.880
To make us believe that we had a weird choice to make between a very deadly virus with a fear and cleavage site that was spreading faster than any virus in history

56:14.600 --> 56:17.320
And making people drop dead on the street and in Wuhan

56:17.800 --> 56:22.680
We had to choose between that and an experimental technology that lots of people are telling us are going to be just fine

56:22.680 --> 56:26.440
And it's really, you know, you have RNA and lipids and sugars in your body

56:26.440 --> 56:29.080
So this is nothing that you don't already have it won't hurt you at all

56:35.400 --> 56:38.680
Bang there was a first time we looked we found two integration events

56:38.920 --> 56:45.160
But this doesn't really speak to the due diligence of those that put out these shots doesn't it is astonishing that

56:45.800 --> 56:51.560
We don't have this type of surveillance given how cheap DNA sequencing is now. I mean there are sequencers now on space stations

56:51.640 --> 56:53.640
They're so cheap and portable

56:53.960 --> 56:58.040
That it it's mind-blowing that this isn't getting done in every single lot

56:58.520 --> 57:02.200
You get a loan it didn't get that at all and the genotoxicity studies were

57:02.840 --> 57:05.240
weren't done because they claimed this pure mRNA

57:05.800 --> 57:11.880
Um now that's that's really concerning because if you go through modernist own patents, you can find that they knew about this

57:12.520 --> 57:16.840
They knew that DNA was an ocogenic risk through insertional mutagesis

57:16.840 --> 57:21.720
And they worked hard to invent new techniques to try and get rid of this and then they do have less DNA than Pfizer

57:22.440 --> 57:27.800
Um, so when you start seeing that the the companies have patents that speak to these problems yet the regulators

57:27.800 --> 57:31.320
Won't read those patents to know vin, they'll deny that these things are a problem

57:31.560 --> 57:37.000
There's a massive disconnect going so let's talk about sv 40 because you and I talked about that on chd tv

57:37.080 --> 57:41.720
You found sv 40 in these shots simian virus 40, which I liked what he said there

57:41.720 --> 57:45.400
I liked the fact that he said sequencing is so cheap

57:45.880 --> 57:50.760
I like the fact that he said that because that's a little bit true and a little bit not true

57:51.560 --> 57:52.920
um

57:52.920 --> 57:56.840
You still have to design primers correctly. You still have to run the reaction correctly

57:56.840 --> 58:01.880
You still have to do controls and so they're it's cheap, but it still requires some mastery

58:02.920 --> 58:05.560
It still requires some due diligence and so

58:06.360 --> 58:12.600
Just like with the pcr testing it's very easy to assume that all pcr testing was the same everywhere it definitely wasn't

58:13.240 --> 58:20.120
It's very safe to us. It's very easy to assume rather that all the sequencing and all the different countries is the same and it definitely wasn't

58:22.680 --> 58:27.480
We can't even be sure that the pcr testing occurring in the same city was that was equivalent

58:28.120 --> 58:32.120
If different firms using different products or different machines or different people

58:32.760 --> 58:35.000
And different collection techniques were being used

58:37.160 --> 58:42.280
And so one of the illusions that I think is being protected here when we focus on the dna

58:42.840 --> 58:46.120
Is the illusion that was created by the 250 odd

58:47.000 --> 58:52.120
PCR tests that were rolled out at the beginning of the pandemic to create this illusion of a huge ramp up

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
of cases

58:54.920 --> 59:00.280
The idea that we had drive up testing and that we were using that as evidence of spread was absurd and

59:00.840 --> 59:04.760
People like kevin mccernan actually should have known that but instead

59:05.400 --> 59:11.320
They published papers which kind of supported the idea of of of pcr just

59:12.280 --> 59:15.720
Objected to the pcr primers that were being used

59:16.680 --> 59:19.320
Suggested that a better protocol could be designed

59:20.040 --> 59:22.280
And here in this interview as I pointed out

59:22.680 --> 59:28.520
He reinforced that pcr was working and that overcycling pcr could give you false positives

59:28.920 --> 59:31.000
When I have been arguing a very different thing

59:32.360 --> 59:34.200
That the background is already hot

59:35.160 --> 59:39.480
And for many of these short amplicons that they say were specific for this

59:40.040 --> 59:46.920
Virus the chances are very good that there were lots of false positives there because the background was hot because these signals were not as unique

59:47.400 --> 59:52.120
As they said they were and that we have no data zero data absolutely

59:53.480 --> 59:58.920
Zero data from before the pandemic about how any of these 250 odd tests would have looked

59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.240
How many false positives they would get and the only testing we really have

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.880
To say that they work is done in perfect laboratory conditions with only one

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.360
Pure product to detect

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.920
And so sure the primers work in that scenario and sure the primers are specific in that scenario

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:22.360
But that's very different than trying to amplify all of the rna reverse transcribed from a nasal swab

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.320
And so these are the kinds of things that I believe

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.240
With my whole heart and mind if kevin mccernan wanted to bring this down these are

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.360
He would be the only person you'd need to have talk

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:43.000
Because he could summarize across the whole pandemic from the very start what was done wrong

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.560
And why these technologies and the fidelity of them was exaggerated

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.680
The fidelity of the PCR tests were exaggerated the quality controlling of the PCR tests with non-existent

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.040
The lateral flow tests were almost all coming from china. I mean give me a break

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.880
None of these

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.480
Technologies were adequately quality controlled proven to be

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.560
Testing for a new virus and never compared to one another

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:14.520
So the idea that somehow we have real data about how many cases there were from 2020 going forward is absurd

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.360
And yet none of that narrative is being tested

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.040
Not in that narratives being questioned none of those methodologies are being questioned and the guy who could reveal

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:31.960
The limitations of these methodologies the overextended nature of the biosecurity narrative that we're currently engaged in

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360
This guy's not testing it at all

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:41.080
And he's focused very exclusively on telling mary all about the consequences of the dna in the shot

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.760
Darn it

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.800
Is known to be associated with cancer, right? Oh, this is

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.440
We didn't find the whole virus. The whole virus is about 5,000 bases long

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.080
This is as long as the sp40 origin of

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.800
40 because you and I talked about that on chdtv

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.800
You found sp40 in these shots simian virus 40, which is known to be associated with cancer, right?

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.080
So we didn't find the whole virus. The whole virus is about 5,000 bases long

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:15.400
We did find the sp40 origin of replication, which is important. I'll touch on that the sp40 promoter

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.240
And the sp40 enhancer and one other piece of it that

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.360
Part of the polyase signal those four pieces

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.760
But the sp40 enhancer has been published by david dean to be a nuclear targeting sequence

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.960
So all the people who are claiming this will never get to the nucleus are really aware that no

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.360
There's the sequence in this plasma drives it straight there

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.960
The other piece of the operation there is sp40 origin replication

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:41.320
That's a million origin of replication what that means is when that gets into a million cell it starts making more of itself

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.960
Uh, so that's I think that's a very important

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.720
Risk that the regulators need to consider they have these regulations speaking to nanograms of dna

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.640
And they treat all dna is equal

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.920
And you can't do that because some dna can amplify when it gets inside of a cell

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.120
Therefore the limit that you could allow should be arguably lower for anything that can self amplify

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.160
Um, the the regulations are too blind to this

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.520
Um now that we have sequencing tools that we have today

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080
That we shouldn't have this

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.720
Any any any dna is fine like we have the capacity to read exactly everything that's in there

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.760
And we should be a hell of a lot more intelligent about what we allow in the vaccines

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.720
And so we should be a hell of a lot more intelligent about what we allow in the vaccine

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.520
So another one after another opportunity to say they're just transfections

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.240
This is an old technology and we should have done known better to use this in healthy humans

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.280
They're not saying that at all. They're saying they're contaminated. They're adulterated. This could have been better

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:44.760
This could have been fixed and a large amount of the downside can be attributed perhaps to the dna in the shots

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.200
It's not good. It's it's

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.320
We really have got to try and bring more people to understand that

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.520
The brood beer perfect version of

01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.360
Transfection would not be appropriate for your kids and if you're if your grandmother is healthy

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.800
Then no transfection is good for her

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.240
If your grandmother is working in the garden every day and gets up at five in the morning and reads and then eats two eggs and bacon for

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.800
Breakfast and then you know hasn't smoked since she was 18 and

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.960
I don't know goes for a walk every morning and and and where's uh tennis shoes that that look

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.280
It looks silly because they're bright pink

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.200
Well goodness sakes you don't give her a transfection either

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:36.600
And yet that's right now the prevailing narrative that's right now the prevailing target that's right now where these are most appropriate for

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.160
The vulnerable the vulnerable

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.720
We got to be careful ladies and gentlemen. This is not over yet if we can get some of these people on our team it would be great

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920
So given what you've learned so far

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.560
What's next and and do you think that we need to have any immediate changes in policy?

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.080
Independent of our findings. I think we need changes of the policy, but in terms of what we have found

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.120
Um, I think we have to be screening

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.240
Vaccinated biopsies cancer biopsies

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.400
Uh, perhaps blood banks like there is concern over okay. We we now have the the blood supply contaminated with this

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.960
There's quantitative PCR. We could be using for screening that

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:27.400
Um, there's there's lactating mothers that are concerned that this is in the breast milk shortly after um, I mean think about how the the

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.440
Donated blood supply would collapse if if suddenly there was a story where

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:39.320
People who are having cancer if you looked at the cancerous tissue, you could find integration of the spike protein

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.480
Uh

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:47.320
RNA sequence in it or maybe sv40 or something. I don't know what we're gonna find. I don't know what he's gonna find

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.360
Maybe he'll find nothing and declare it. It's okay

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.320
All's well. I don't know

01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:00.040
But I want you to see the potential downsides here that go all the way back to the beginning

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.200
They murdered americans so that people would take this seriously. They murdered americans

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.680
So that people would would comply

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.480
So that people would go along with it and take their shot when it was their turn

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:19.560
They murdered americans to do that with protocols with lies and with social changes that allowed all kinds of

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360
causes of death to skyrocket

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.800
And then they blamed it all on the novel virus

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:30.360
And it doesn't seem like mary holland and kevin mccurnan are aware

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.320
of the

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:39.560
proportion of people and deaths that can't really be attributed to a spreading pathogen

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.480
Even though people like denny rancor have been on chd tv a couple times

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.200
Even though i'm sure kevin mccurnan knows who he is because i've been talking about denny rancor for at least two years

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.200
The first time i put any slides of his in my slide deck was in 2021

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.320
So i don't know. I mean everybody should know already

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.320
But it seems like nobody can seem to get over that hump

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.280
There is a novel virus if killed millions of people millions more were saved it probably came from gain of function and it will come again

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.160
There's dna in the shot

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.800
After vaccination we had a paper out last week that showed it was in the placenta

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.440
So all types of questions are showing up now the crossing paper showed it in heart tissue

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.800
So

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.600
It's by the bio distribution of these ellen peas are everywhere and it's bringing with it all of this payload

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:43.800
That isn't being well monitored yet. We have we've never been in a better position to be able to sequence all the rna and dna in a vaccine

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.880
If we're going to use these platforms, so

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.800
I think they do need to have far better transparency on the on the qc

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.400
And then what you'll see today in this in this meeting is independent of the dna contamination issues

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.360
There is a host of other problems with these vaccines that they should be pulled from the market immediately just over those alone

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:06.520
I think I think the dna contamination is more of a signature a forensic signature of absolute and competent

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.880
Think about how easy it would have been to say right there

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.960
There's a whole host of other problems that stem from the fact that these are just

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:20.920
Transfections and we knew already a long time ago that transfecting your healthy grandmother or transfecting your healthy child

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:27.640
Or allowing your college aged kid to be transfected multiple times was absurd

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.600
But did he say it?

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.920
No, he didn't

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.560
Listen again, please

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.520
It's damning to be able to sequence all the rna and dna in a vaccine if we're going to use these platforms

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.560
So

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.920
I think they do need to have far better transparency on the on the qc

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.600
And then what you'll see today in this in this meeting is independent of the dna contamination issues

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.560
There is a host of other problems with these vaccines that they should be pulled from the market immediately just over those alone

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.640
I think I think the dna contamination is more of a signature a forensic signature of absolute incompetence

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.760
That's going on in the regulatory system now that I like and that just shows itself because it's a very traceable molecule

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.680
Thank no, I like I like what he said there. I like that part

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:18.680
That was very nice that the dna signature is really just a sign of their incompetence a sign of what they did

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.040
But it's a shortcut that people like kevin mccernan

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.040
Who have been in the bio technology space

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.120
the bio

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120
pharmaceutical space for decades

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.840
Have been making things with plasmid since this inception of the human genome project and understands

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:44.520
How difficult it is to clean those projects up those those products up understands how monoclonal antibodies are made

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.920
Is a molecular biological

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:54.840
Methodological genius knows already knew that transfection would be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.760
Robert Malone knew that transfection would be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:08.760
Harvey rice should have known that transfection would be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:17.400
And so the fact that these people are complaining that they didn't understand that their biological knowledge was not sufficient that they

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.480
Didn't really get the big picture of the immune system well enough to understand that transfection in its greatest best

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.920
Purest form wouldn't be appropriate for healthy humans. That's their problem

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.040
They have to repent for that they need to atone for that

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.840
You can't let them off the hook

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.840
They should have known they've been touring the world

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.880
They've been going on podcast saying what they know but when why didn't they just say no from the very beginning

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.160
These don't belong in healthy humans. Why is it so hard to say that

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:05.880
Unequivocally without caveats or butts or what ifs

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.640
Just know

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640
Harvey rice can't say it either

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.680
Do so much dr. McCurnan

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.840
Dr. McCurnan

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.360
Dr. Harvey wish

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.640
Professor emeritus of the Yale school of public health. Harvey welcome. Thank you. Great to be with you

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.840
So talk to us about what you're going to be saying at this briefing that senator ron johnson's convened

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320
Well, i'm talking about my

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.600
Hypothesis about why the vaccines were forced on everybody all over the world

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.960
Mostly unnecessary if not all unnecessarily and the reasons why I think uh, we've been through this and a lot of this comes

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.560
from

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.680
Bobby's book the the Wuhan cover-up book where he

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.800
In great detail explained all of the factors that led to the generation of the virus

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:05.320
And and the cover-up over its leakage and but there's more to it that he hasn't gotten to but other people have talked about like Mike bens on tucker

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.520
Carlson and others have been talking about this and this is a very important topic right now

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.960
So you're going to be focused on why it happened as well as the epidemiology is that right? Well

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.480
In my opinion, the vaccines were forced on the population because

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.120
Making the virus virus of that bioengineer. There's no questions a man made virus

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.680
And the problem with that is that offensive bio weapon development violates the

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.200
1975 bio weapons treaty. So all bio weapons research has to be dual use

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.520
That means the the virus has to be generated for dual use purposes and the research itself has to be dual use

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:52.600
Now here for the and one of those dual uses could be to establish the illusion of pandemic potential

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:59.800
So that the government could use the illusion the threat of pandemic potential to change the way we were governed

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.000
to invert our sovereignty to permissions

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.280
to restrict our movement

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.840
and to transfect us to use

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.680
use

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:17.480
Transfection on the population so that it could be rolled out as a methodology tested and eventually used en masse

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.320
Bill Gates is in transfecting his kids and himself

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.320
Benjamin Netanyahu is in transfecting his family

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:34.360
Come on ladies and gentlemen, this is a national security priority a national security operation and the people inside of the operation aren't participating

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400
They're watching it happen

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.320
They are the ones who are actually in the audience

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440
We are stuck on stage

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:53.960
And we don't know it we think we're out in the street living real life on the internet

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.880
Real life on social media and we're not

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.240
We're on stage surrounded by scenery and actors

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.440
Liars and illusions

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.600
And this is nothing more than that

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.680
Wittingly or unwittingly these people are participating in this biosecurity illusion

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.480
of gain of function viruses

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.440
The effectiveness of vaccines the need for vaccines without being able to explain what's really going on

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.800
the decades of biological history that underpin this movement

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.920
the decades of

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.200
Intellectual history that underpin this movement

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:48.280
That have distorted the way that we think about RNA and DNA distorted the way we think about our immune response to any of these challenges

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.760
to our environment

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.200
It's absolutely atrocious where we are right now

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.240
And if I didn't think I would get sued by this person

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.360
I would play a recording that I have of him

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160
An absolute fool of himself

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.400
He didn't know the word

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.760
Transfection when I spoke to him and he told me that covid is still a very serious virus because

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.360
Despite being double vaccinated and using hydroxychloroquine in a prophylactic way

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:26.360
He still got infected by covid for a third time and it was two weeks of terrible illness

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.360
So you better darn well respect the virus says harvey rice

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.320
Oh, yeah, he took ivermectin too after he got infected and it still was two weeks of horrible

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
It's the most comical

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.320
Recording of this man i've ever found

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.240
So insistent and you know what my response was well, wow, I guess

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.440
hydroxychloroquine the two shots and ivermectin don't do anything for you

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.800
So what do you really know?

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.880
What do you really understand about what's going on if everything that you believe was proved wrong in the story

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.400
You just told i guess hydroxychloroquine doesn't work prophylactically

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.480
I guess ivermectin doesn't really shorten the duration of the disease

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:17.080
I guess two shots doesn't stop you from getting infected either because this is your third infection

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.880
And now he wants you to believe that it was forced on you for some

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.720
Biosecurity reason but not not lied about

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320
And so here we have again a little twist and turn and bait and switch

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.200
Making it much more complicated that it needs to be ockham's razor is not in anybody's pocket here

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:48.280
i'll tell you that much right now complicated stories with lots of moving parts that involve lots more

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:55.640
Crazy mythologies nutty biology crazy possibilities instead of just liars

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.440
See that's the whole thing it's just liars if you just see that it's liars then we don't need any of this magic

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.760
We don't need any of this mythology stop lying

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.640
That's the whole point

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.640
It's a

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.240
Bioweapon virus gets out of the lab and it's not dual use

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.920
It proves that all that research was was fraud that it was violating the law

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.480
So in order to offset that problem it has to be shown to be dual use

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.400
The only way you can show something to be dual use is if there's a vaccine

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.680
So the vaccine had to come out even though it what the research was shoddy

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.880
It was done, you know in a very rapid fashion a year later a year too late

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.600
Yeah, you can understand a vaccine for for a pandemic has to be out before the pandemic

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.640
Right not a year into it that that's absurd

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.640
So but in any event

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:53.160
So the vaccine had to be out for the public theater to show that there was a dual use in the first place

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.600
So so the vaccine then becomes part of the cover up of the bioweapons league is that accurate exactly?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.320
Wow, I mean

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.440
Mary's got it. Well done. She's smarter than me. I don't understand harvey

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.600
I don't get what he means the vaccine came too late. It's got to come before the pandemic

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:19.640
But I mean we have video after video of them saying that they wanted an am monoclonal antibody cocktail within 60 days

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:26.200
They wanted a vaccine within 60 days a vaccine with an that I don't I don't see that

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.040
It doesn't have to come before the pandemic. They showed the time frame

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.640
The virus can be detected before the pandemic even kicks off

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.400
Lockdowns can slow down the peak of the pandemic

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.400
What is he talking about?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.160
And so the epidemiologist is not going to talk at all about epidemiology

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.720
He's just going to wax intellectual about his theory that

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.200
Biosecurity state had to cover up a bioweapon by rolling out a vaccine that didn't work or something like that

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.680
What in the hell is going on here?

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.440
How is this person speaking in front of the senate?

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.520
Why was this person in romania

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.800
in november of 2023

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:19.720
I mean seriously we got nothing better than professor of emeritus of yale school of public health

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.720
I

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.040
Man, oh man, I'm just I'm just I can't believe it. I know it's hard to believe it

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.520
But it's for me. It's really hard to believe that we are here

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400
It really is

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.560
Hi

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.760
I just have been watching the the tucker karlson michael ben's interview, which I think is profound about what's really been happening

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.920
That's two tucker karlson's in a row

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.680
All of these forces going on outside of public awareness

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.640
Is is nefarious. That's tucker karlson. I've plugged again

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:08.600
So now we're talking about censorship and and and government controlling the narrative on social media yada yada yada yada

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.400
They're plugging tucker karlson again the liar

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.400
Tucker

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:19.080
Tucker karlson the liar. I don't know what else to say. I know lots of people like him, but he's a liar

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:25.720
And he does the bidding of the state he moved to twitter because that's what they needed him to do

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:35.000
Because they needed more narrative control on twitter because they needed to get him off box because he was starting it

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It was too much for there

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240
Something like that. I don't know what their deal is

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.560
But he's definitely a liar

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.040
If i'm invited to be on tucker's show, I won't go

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.120
If I was invited on alix jones's podcast, I wouldn't go

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:58.520
And if I went on joe rogan's podcast there wouldn't be a podcast because I would start out by saying you know all these people are liars

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.400
Right

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:05.240
Wait, dude. We can't have this podcast. This isn't gonna work. All right. Well roll one up then because this is all I got to say

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.680
That's how long the joe rogan podcast would be with me

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.040
Because I would want to start out with the obvious part that they murdered people in order to get this to work

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.320
And they lied about it and they continue to lie about it

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:27.720
It is a spectacular commitment to lies that allows the professor emeritus harvey rice the epidemiologist to not mention at all

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.760
There's no epidemiological data evidence of spread

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.000
For him to go in front of the senate and not talk at all about all cause mortality

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.080
I

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.560
Mean that's that's when you see it clearly. What are we doing here?

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.600
What kind of clown show is this?

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.200
We're gonna go to the next slide need harvey. We've been back

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:06.680
I loved in your in your remarks. You said that that that that bringing home to people

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:14.120
Really how serious and grave and outrageous the situation is particularly in the vaccine adverse event reporting system

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.360
Would you tell us more about that?

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.680
Yeah, well the two things

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.280
It's it's been three or four years. Oh, so I hope that it's already clear

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:31.000
She started out Jessica rose fact fact fact and that in her presentations. She said fact fact tech

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:35.320
This is dr. Jessica rose. I see she's only got one of her four monikers here

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:42.120
She's an immunologist a computational biologist a molecular biologist and also a virologist

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.680
Sometimes she also says

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.760
um

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:52.040
Like applied mathematician too. So there's lots of hats that she can wear today. She's wearing immunologist

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.520
And she said fact fact fact now interestingly enough

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840
Jessica rose was also in

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560
Romania in November of

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:05.080
2023 where she also saw the presentation of

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.400
Denny Rancor and also

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:16.200
Took a selfie with Denny Rancor, but in her list of fact fact fact fact she never said that there is no

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.240
Epidemiological evidence of spread

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:26.200
Fact there's no there are many borders that that the virus apparently couldn't cross fact

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.400
the viral deaths were correlated with with things like poverty instead of

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:37.240
You know where it should have been maybe with age or something like that these facts

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.560
from the data

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
which were first sort of

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:48.440
Illuminated by by Denny Rancor as early as 2020. We're not part of her list of facts

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.480
It's an important thing to note

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.440
I

01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:01.880
Looking into this data and it's pretty irrefutable what it's showing and this is CDC data. It's their own data

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.880
um

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:11.160
And it's time to stop trying to prove like to convince people of what's going on because it's so evident

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.400
It's time to just start stating it is fact

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.320
And I I can't remember who remarked on it today, but um

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880
It's absolutely true. I think it was Brett

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.160
That we as scientists don't talk like that unless some things kind of

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.920
Up like we don't say this is a fact in science

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.280
But you can be more comfortable doing that in data, but I've never done that before but

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:42.840
It's repeats for years of today. What are the key facts that our viewers may know, but need to know well

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.040
Two things off the top of my head the magnitude of the

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.360
The input into theirs, which is the vaccine adverse event recording system in the context of the covid shots is off the scales in comparison to the last 30 years

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.720
And it's not only the magnitude of the reports

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:09.400
It's the range of pipes of adverse events which speaks to the comprehensiveness of the damages that we're seeing clinically

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.160
And what she should if she wanted to integrate across this jessica if you're watching

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.360
What you should say here is that these this huge bouquet

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.440
this

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.440
swath of

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.240
Of effects from the virus. I'm sorry

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:36.120
The effects from the transfection that are codified in the bears system that you have been investigating for the last three years

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.080
Speaks to the danger of transfection

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.320
It speaks to the wide ranging

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.600
Possibilities that are all downsides of transfecting healthy people

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.600
And jessica has talked to me on my stream. She's talked to me on other streams

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.560
We used to be in steve kersha steering committee together. We've had lots of zoom meetings

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:08.040
She knows this she should know this if she's an immunologist computational biologist virologist

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.920
Applied mathematician and molecular biologist. She should know this

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.400
And it should be exactly what she says here

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.960
Not just that these are evidence that people are getting heard, but they're evidence that all of this stuff

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:32.360
Was already known it was going to happen. They knew that because transfection is inappropriate in healthy humans. How long?

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.240
three seconds

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:42.200
three seconds would it take to say the reason why there are so many is because people like michael yeden and

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.080
Jonathan cooey and

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:52.840
And and and peter makala all said very early on that this was going to cause a whole host of problems because you can't express

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.920
Foreign protein in a healthy human and expect it not to go wrong

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.480
Why not say that

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.760
Why make it so difficult why make it so detailed, you know that they don't those don't matter anymore

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.720
it's extraordinary

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.720
gonna go back a little bit

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.640
of the

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:26.840
The input into veers, which is the vaccine adverse event recording system in the context of the covid shots is off the scales in comparison to the last 30 years

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.200
And it's not only the magnitude of the reports

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.080
It's the range of pipes of adverse events

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.800
Which speaks to the comprehensiveness of the damages that we're seeing clinically

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.280
So it's leaves rustling in the wind

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:46.760
Yeah, it's leaves rustling in the wind that say that it was criminally negligent to ever transfect anyone

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.040
And that needs to be said

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.440
That everybody with a biology degree should have known

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:03.560
And it seems so inconsistent as you're saying with anything that we've ever called a vaccine before it seems much more consistent with what we've always called a poison

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.800
Yeah, well, um

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:12.760
They're not vaccines by any stretch of the imagination say it or definition say it's our lipid nanoparticles carrying

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:20.280
Genetic material. They're transfections. You know probably more recently. We've discovered it doesn't just contain modified mRNA

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.760
Tanes DNA, which comes with an entire boatload of additional problems

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.880
And it's been written off as not a problem

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.480
Yeah

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:37.240
So what what what to head for you in in doing research on this Jessica

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600
backing up

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.600
Anybody who wants me to

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.440
From any point of view that I can immunologically

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.760
Iochemically molecular biology math stats, whatever

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:57.240
I'm just going to be a support system as I have been I don't plan on launching any new things myself at the time

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.160
um

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.360
And hopefully I'm going to catch some more words soon

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.440
Is there anything else you want to tell us

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.400
Just thanks for everything that you do the diligence. Thanks for being here

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.720
Not not just witnessing risk for reporting on it. I I have a

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.160
I haven't been to one of these ever in my life

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.120
and

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:26.280
I just feel that this one is different from the other one somehow like we've we've reached a

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.920
boiling point

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.440
I think that's right. It was quite uh, it was four hours that was action-packed to be well

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:40.200
I think there were 27 speakers and senator johnson and it was every dimension of this and

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.200
The people who are speaking who are really speaking out of

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Outrage and immediacy. We we have to turn this around now. There's not a lot of waiting time

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:55.000
There's no doubt about that. I I think we are at a critical point and

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:01.160
one thing I would have liked to have said if I had any general closing remarks, I I can say them here is

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:08.440
To anyone who thinks that you should underestimate the seriousness of the problem we have right now globally

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Um rethink because we're we're in the sh it like we really are and we

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.800
For anyone who watched this hearing today

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.760
We had belgium israel canada united states germany

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:30.040
Romania forgive me for who i'm missing we're coming together because we have to we have a shared problem and we need to

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:38.360
We need to give anything. Uh, we may be underestimating the scope of the horror. Yeah, we're we're we can't it's hard to overstate it

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.400
But that's okay because uh, you know, there's still some optimism now. There there was this thing

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.120
Um, that happened

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.960
I'm gonna switch back here quick

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.520
And there was this uh thing that happened at some point in that four-hour stream that I did

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:57.720
About the senate hearing where I said why are we having so many foreigners speak?

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:04.440
Why are all these white people speaking? We went around the world to bring white men to speak in front of the senate

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.680
And and some people didn't really appreciate that remark. It was like three hours in and i'm not

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.400
I'm not here to apologize for that remark that remark was meant to provoke something

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:17.560
because

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.320
in the senate

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.640
Where american laws are written and where american laws can be changed

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.400
Where the voting american public is represented

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:37.800
I think we have a very limited need for foreigners to be present and to testify as to what happened around the world

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.160
Although it's fine if you think that those people were valuable

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:51.320
But I would suggest to you it's just as strange that we've had groups of americans the same more or less group of americans touring the world

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.400
Old

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.680
Stockholm

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.040
Italy

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:59.320
Costa Rica. I don't know where they all go. Maybe it wasn't Costa Rica

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.240
You know cruises off the coast of turkey

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.200
These things all happened

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:12.280
And why are these americans these same americans spending so much time courting

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:18.600
The narrative in other countries controlling the narrative leading the charge in other countries

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:26.920
Aren't you at least kind of suspicious why these americans are on world tours and it's all the same americans

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:32.200
The ones with deep long connections to the thing we're supposed to be fighting

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.560
I don't know if anybody who's given a presentation in front of the who should be trusted

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.400
Is that crazy?

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.880
And yet here we are

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.440
A

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:53.240
Whole senate presentation organized by the presentations selected by a person who gave a presentations in front of the who

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.400
And nobody's batting an eyelash at it

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:04.040
A guy who is as deeply connected as to be best buddies with david home

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.400
I mean how much more connected can you be than that?

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.520
That he's claimed in an interview

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:17.080
Side-by-side with with steven hat fill that he was vetted for possibly heading up science

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.880
at us amort

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.640
and now he's allowed to organize a

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.360
COVID discussion

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.680
That's supposed to be meaningful

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:35.880
That's supposed to have some value for our grandchildren. I'm sorry, but that's that's not what happened here

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520
I

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.760
I'm delighted to introduce dr. Brett Weinstein

01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.840
With the dark horse podcast evolutionary biologist now a fellow at the brownstone institute

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.600
Just here participating in the briefing that senator johnson convene welcome. Thank you

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.600
So

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.400
So you uh the the tagline for this briefing was what are they hiding?

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400
And I believe you started your remarks with

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:23.000
They're hiding everything we know i'm pretty sure that during the course of my stay at the at children's health defense more than once

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.800
either a donor connected to Brett Weinstein or

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.480
Yeah as something like that

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:38.520
Contacted chd to say that jonathan cooey is saying bad things about Brett Weinstein and you should make him stop

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.120
Can't make those things up

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.480
That happened

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.920
Christine grace actually also sent a couple letters or emails to mary holland saying that jay was

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.400
Slandering her and disparaging her online and that he should be rained in and stopped

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.000
And there were others

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:00.920
But Brett's one in particular that I remember very well because I find it funny now

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.800
That just like that after I was laid off my my position was ended in on january 4th

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.080
And I was offered eight thousand dollars and a non-disclosure agreement

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.000
Here we have Brett Weinstein being interviewed by the president of children's health defense at the senate

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.200
It's fun. It's fun times

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:31.080
It's really really fun times and i'm sure that everybody that really understands what's going on is also going to label me now as an obvious medler

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.160
Obviously right from the back of my garage with a green screen

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.000
And a computer and 3,000 followers on twitch. I'm the medler

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.440
It couldn't possibly be any of these people

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.400
It couldn't possibly be any of these people

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.760
So

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.960
I wonder if she's going to ask him why she didn't play why he didn't play bobby's

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.720
interview from

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.680
November of 2021 until February of

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.520
2023

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.520
I wonder if she'll ask him that

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840
I wonder if she'll ask him about his dad

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.000
and uh

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.360
And

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.520
His dad's relationship with bobby's dad

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.760
Was it good? Was it long? Did you have a barbecue with him?

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.800
You know, are they going to ask any of that? Nah, probably not either

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.280
This is pretty much just a promotion of him

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.360
profession of professor of evolutionary biology where

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.680
At what university does he hold this prestigious title

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.840
At least you could just put phd or something but professor of evolutionary biology. I don't think so

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.800
Say a little bit more about that. Well, um, yeah, I they are hiding everything

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:52.360
And

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:59.160
What I mean by that is that they are sabotaging all of the mechanisms that we would normally use to figure out what's true

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:06.520
And that sounds like a wild exaggeration, but it isn't the fact is it's not even just a an attack on the university system

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.560
It's an attack on every single university. The research done there is low quality

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.840
Not repeatable and so what he wants you to believe is that the university system is twisted but him

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.680
He's fine and actually he's the one you should turn to

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:24.280
The university of Austin is somebody you should turn to

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:31.000
The brownstone institute is somebody you should turn to and now they've made him a fellow. I wonder how much money they give him

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.360
Do they give him any money? Gosh, I hope they don't

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.240
I mean seriously if the brownstone institute gives out fellowships and the fellowships have any money at all

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560
I

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.800
Mean man. Oh man. Why give it to this guy

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.480
How can this possibly be?

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.920
I think you know the answer

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.800
I think you know the answer

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.760
There is a controlled limited spectrum of debate. These people are being placed to control it

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.520
They have been placed

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:17.400
To control it. They will continue to control it and anybody that happens to jump in the boat and rock the boat a little bit

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.880
Will get thrown immediately out. It doesn't matter

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:26.120
What kind of integrity you have what books you help with what citations you you contribute

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.680
It doesn't matter what you do if you rock this boat of the novel virus

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.480
If you rock this boat where nobody's talking about the childhood vaccine schedule

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.080
All these people are saying wow children's health defense is so great. We love what you guys do

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.080
What exactly do you do?

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.520
What exactly does children health defense do? Why can't anybody say it?

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.960
Children's health defense

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.040
What do they do? Do they oppose the childhood vaccine schedule?

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:05.560
Do they believe that all intramuscular injection of combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb or not?

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
What are they actually doing?

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760
Why aren't they praising

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.040
The green book the vax unvax book. Why don't they say that wow children's health defense

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.000
You sure put out a whopper with that book that thing is fantastic brian hooker is a hero

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.560
Why is it just always we love what you guys are doing support the organization you guys are great

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:39.160
Wow, you're just you're just awesome calling attention to all these things what things

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:48.200
The childhood vaccine schedule should we stop it? Should we pause the childhood vaccine schedule until it's evaluated?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.520
Objectively

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:57.080
Should we impose strict liability on pharmaceutical products? Is that something that children's health defense advocates for?

01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.280
I can't tell what's going on here

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:05.000
But it doesn't seem to be a very good representation of children's health defense and what they're doing

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.440
She opened by plugging another nonprofit called the center for

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.120
security studies or security policy

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.080
And then that guy plugged maryll nasa's new anti who doors to freedom

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.960
non-profit

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.920
There's a lot of weird

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.600
conflicts of interest

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.320
Coming from the president of children's health defense here

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.320
And we're not being very clear taking this opportunity to say what children's health defense does and why they do it

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.120
Or is it now really transforming into this amorphous health freedom

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:48.120
And just some kind of big top 10 where everybody can have a booth

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.560
But we don't really take any particular stance on anything

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.680
We just want to be health freedom and we want everybody to be able to say what they want to say

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.320
That is a disaster

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.160
We need children's health defense to step up right now and take firm stances on things

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:15.640
We need children's health defense to stand on firm ground and say things that people can understand and restate and digest

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.600
We need people who can speak clearly not people like Brett Weinstein

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.880
And yet here they are promoting the liar Tucker Carlson promoting the intellectual dark web

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:31.400
Member and founding member maybe Brett Weinstein

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.240
And we're going to overlook the fact that the president of

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.320
children's health defense came to Brett Weinstein's podcast in the 21 of November to give a

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:49.480
Brilliant three-hour interview in Brett's own house and Brett didn't release it until February of 23

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.880
We're going to ignore the fact that Brett Weinstein was not

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:05.080
For Bobby when Bobby spoke in front of of the streets or the the square in Berlin in October of 2020

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.240
He did not support that he was pro mask. He was pro lockdown. He was pro hard lockdown

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.880
And Bobby was saying ignore all of it. You see the problem here

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.720
Did we forget that that happened? Apparently we did

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.000
We don't have much time to wake up ladies and gentlemen

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:32.920
We don't have much time to wake up. We are being given false false saviors

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.640
fake

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.040
Resistance

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:45.880
This is not really questioning the foundation of public health. It's not really questioning the foundation of of alipathic medicine

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.760
This is just this is just mealy mouth

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.160
Limited spectrum of debate gnome Chomsky style

01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:01.720
Well, the lessons taught there are actually in large measure not even true anymore things that are verifiably false are taught as if they are true

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.600
Um our regulatory agencies work exactly in reverse

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.360
They protect regulators from from citizens not the other way around

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.840
So something is attacking all of the mechanisms in civilization

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.640
That are supposed to seek the truth and act upon it and that's not a coincidence

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:26.680
So I think you also concluded your mark saying we need to save the west which is a pretty profound statement

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.360
Tell us what you mean by that

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.440
Well, so I defined the west a little differently than other people. I define it in a way that I think

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.320
Uh is maybe a lesson to it but more natural. I would say the west is

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.360
the agreement what aside our

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.560
lineage level differences and to collaborate with anybody who

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:53.880
Has something that they bring do you understand how unhelpful this is when we are standing in the american senate where american laws are written

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.120
And american laws can be changed where the votes of american people are supposed to be

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.880
Sort of influencing how we move forward as a country

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:08.760
Do you know how ridiculous it is for him to be talking in these very unspecific terms about the west and saving it?

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.800
We are in the midst of a car crash. There is an oak tree coming

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.880
And he's talking about car crashes in general

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.040
And how in general you can avoid car crashes. We're in one right now

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.280
We need to hit the brakes and turn the steering wheel right now

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.080
You're sitting in the driver's seat the senate of the us government and you have decided to talk about other car crashes

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:42.920
And car crashes in general hypothetical car crashes

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:52.840
That's what we're dealing with here. We are being bamboozled. We are being actively bamboozled and we're supposed to watch this through our screens

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.600
Through our phones and think something meaningful is happening when it's not and we've got to put actual

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160
We've got to call it what it is

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:04.360
These people are performing they've been performing for four years

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.040
And so far none of the people that I see here are people that I trust

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:11.400
And it's because they have not earned it

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.600
Because they're unable to

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:19.240
Tell the whole story because they've been focused on the same damn thing for four years

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:26.680
How is it possible that somebody who claims to have a degree in immunology computational biology applied mathematics

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.280
Immunology molecular biology and and and and biochemistry

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.400
Is so hyper focused on veers and still can't seem to call transfection what it is

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:47.640
Kill still hasn't taught a basic immunology done in a basic immunology lecture or a basic immunology series on sub stack

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.480
What's going on?

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.480
How can you not see it?

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.040
Joking around about about surfing

01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.880
This is a person who apparently is an israeli citizen and a canadian citizen

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:10.920
And has spent about half of her time in these two places boy suffering a lot. I wonder what job she lost speaking out against veers

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.520
Oh wait, nothing

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.360
She's never had a tenure track position. She's never been at a university and tried to make it as a scientist

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.600
I don't know what she's doing, but she's got nato on her funding list

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.120
And her first few papers are virology papers

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:39.960
That's why she's not usefully questioning anything if she has the background to do it because

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600
It's not her job

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.520
It's also not her job to call out these childhood vaccines

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.240
That the whole vaccine schedule in america is bunk

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.960
It's not her job to say that so she's definitely not going to do it

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.240
Even though she's got a show on chd she's not going to do it

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.880
Just like mary doesn't do it

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.280
I

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.960
One time she could say yeah, the primary focus is the vaccine schedule

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.200
We're trying to call attention to it

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:18.520
And the the covid vaccine is just the latest iteration in this and we've got to be very careful as we move forward nothing zero zip

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.600
Stop lying

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.840
Come on guys. You got to see it for what it is

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.800
The table is worth collaborating with so that is such a powerful idea

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.200
It is so productive that it has created an incredibly vibrant society

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.560
Here in the u.s

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:43.480
But it has also become contagious and it has spread throughout the world because once people see how dynamic and productive a system that is

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.960
They want to participate

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.480
And that system is now in grave jeopardy

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:53.320
It is falling apart because we've become obsessed with

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.680
Ways in which it is imperfect which is a terrible mistake

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.680
but even worse because the

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.760
the

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:08.520
Democratic structure at the heart of it consent of the governed is under attack by something that is uncomfortable with the idea that we should have

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
power over our own future

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.360
Why not just say liars?

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.760
Because people are spectacularly committed to a lie or a series of lies

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:25.480
They're not saying it because this is a limited spectrum of debate that's not supposed to free us

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.360
So another term that you used and i've heard you use is called the cartesian crisis

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.200
Would you explain to us what you mean by that?

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.280
Sure, it's a little a little arcane, but

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160
I use it because rene decarp

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:44.520
Had a kind of crisis when he realized that there were a great many things that he understood to be factually true

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.880
But that he had established essentially none of them itself

01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:53.080
And that meant that there was reason to doubt that he where he thought he was somebody who was based in fact

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.320
He was really taking a lot on authority

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:01.160
And this resulted in him ultimately trying to establish that he could say anything was factual

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.400
And that's where we get the famous proof cardido ergo soon. I think therefore I am

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.800
Right now. I don't think that's a very good proof of anything because um, but nonetheless

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:10.760
It's a very important

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.160
Yeah, because it allows us to go on and do important things

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:18.520
But the reason I say cartesian crisis is because we are now in the nightmare

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:25.560
That rene decarp feared he might be in where all of the things that he thought were factual might not even be correct and

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.360
Because our

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.720
Our truth seeking apparatus has been under such intense attack

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.360
We don't know what's true

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:40.520
Some things that are very easy to establish this amount of difficult scientific question to figure out whether or not

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.400
mRNA vaccines cause turbo cancers

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.720
That's a very straightforward scientific problem

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:51.720
But we are nonetheless left to grapple with anecdote because to the extent that there are studies they're likely to be

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440
set up to sail and

01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:03.640
The rest is anecdote. So we are left to make sense of the world without the most obvious basic tools without

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:10.760
Anything that flows to us from the enlightenment and that is indeed a very dangerous predicament

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.040
Uh, rather than of course characterizing it as we are up against and arguing with people who are our liars

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Are spectacularly committed to a lie

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:29.480
And so by obfuscating that simple fact it makes it very difficult for people to engage in useful resistance

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.320
That's that's what this guy does

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.880
in a nutshell

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:39.800
It's exactly what what arthur asked in the chat like what what what in the f is he saying?

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.040
He's saying way more than he needs to say when you could just say that

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.400
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and these people are

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.960
Spectacularly committed to the lie

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.640
Done zero zip none of that is here

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:57.640
We don't do anything simple because it's not the point the point is to have

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:03.480
The illusion of a very vigorous debate inside of this limited spectrum of understanding

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.720
It's got to be a very vigorous debate. That's why he's got to talk like that

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.520
It's an illusion

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:17.000
So anything else you'd like any other hopeful notes you like to say to the chd audience?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.520
Well, yeah, okay. I'll end on a hopeful note, and I truly believe this

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.280
And

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.480
In evolution we talk about something called the adaptive landscape

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.120
It's a metaphor that helps us understand some subtle processes and evolution and the idea is

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.680
that opportunities are

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:41.480
Peaks on this adaptive landscape and there are valleys that keep you from going from a low peak to a higher one

01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.160
Now that the important thing to realize is that

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:49.800
We have to leave the peak. We're on this is not a sustainable place

01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:54.200
We can't run a society this way which means that we will have to go through an adaptive valley

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:58.600
So to the extent that people see things is very very dark. They're not imagining it

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.000
But that's inevitable. There's no guarantee that we get through the adaptive valley

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.480
Please understand that this is a complete reveal

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.440
This is a jackpot right here

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
My argument has been that since

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.400
2017 already Brett Weinstein was being placed with this evergreen thing

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.440
placed on social media to have some

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.480
Alternative stance on things to have some alternative presence on things

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:30.680
And then him and his brother and joe rogan a bunch of other people started coordinating bros with shows

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:35.640
Until they had a little presence and in 2019 they had a presence

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.840
And on his eighth podcast

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:44.920
He agreed with sam heres that when the real pandemic comes when 70 percent of the people are being killed by a virus

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.720
That we won't have time for these anti-vaxxers

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.400
And that was by design

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:57.320
Because Brett Weinstein is keen on the fact that we can't run the planet like this

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.400
Brett Weinstein is keen on the fact that there are too many people

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:06.600
And so we're going to have to do something the ruling class is going to have to make some decisions

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.520
He sounds like the club of roamed guy right here

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.880
Make no mistake about it

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:19.960
He's using this opportunity to reveal that he essentially is absolutely and totally on board

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.720
With whatever peter teal elon musk and all the other

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.880
Billionaires in the world have in store for us as they slowly ramp the population down

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:33.240
To whatever they think the carrying capacity is of the earth

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.360
And meanwhile try to take all the generational wealth they can away from us

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:44.520
And convert our children to medical experiments as we are

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:49.400
Slowly ramped down over a couple generations

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.400
That's what's happening here and his family is probably in on it

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.720
He's probably part of that elite group or sure as hell wants to be

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.920
And he's admitting it right here because we are at a peak

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:10.440
In civilization in the adaptive landscape and we can't stay on this peak forever. We're going to have to go through a valley

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:16.120
Which I guess will be the civil war that starts

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.600
after the

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.600
election goes south and the

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:27.160
Immigrants on every street corner in our big cities are are are given the signal to burn everything

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.400
Then I guess that's where we'll be and he will be on this internet

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.920
Thing trying to calm us down and be part of whatever the ruling class wants him to do

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.400
Listen to this so carefully so that you can hear what I just heard

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.520
Something called the adaptive landscape. It's a metaphor that helps us understand some subtle processes and evolutions

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.600
And the idea is that

01:54:52.840 --> 01:55:00.840
Opportunities are peaks on this adaptive landscape and there are valleys that keep you from going from a low peak to a higher one

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.520
Now that the important thing to realize is that

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.160
We have to leave the peak. We're on this is not a sustainable place

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.560
We can't run a society this way which means that we will have to go through an adaptive valley

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:18.040
So to the extent that people see things is very very dark. They're not imagining it

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.040
But that's inevitable

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:22.360
There's no guarantee that we get through the adaptive valley

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:27.000
But the fact that it's dark is not evidence that we should turn around and go back up the hell we came from we can't

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.240
That's not a long-term plan. We can't

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:32.120
Yeah, the the wonderful thing is

01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:38.040
All of the there's no going back to letter jackets and and prom dates

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.840
There's no going back to

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.960
Not sleeping with anybody until you're married. There's no going back to they're just being

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.320
Gay and straight and everything else is you know, maybe you should talk to your doctor about it

01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:57.800
There's not going back to you know private lives and public lives. We're going back

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:03.160
Sexuality is never going back. These things are never going backwards according to him

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.400
So how much what conservative values does he have

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.080
Because I would like to go back

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:19.080
I'd like to go back to high school basketball games

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:26.040
I'd like to go back to high school dances. I would like to go back to raising our children with teachers that teach subjects

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.680
And that are afraid to have relationships with their students beyond that subject because it's inappropriate

01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:36.680
And

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:47.880
Instead we are moving at a at light speed from whatever peak we are on to whatever valley

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.040
We are being led to by these people

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.680
A valley of confusion and doubt and fear and uncertainty

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:03.240
And we don't have to go there

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:09.000
We can all log off of twitter right now. We can all log off of facebook right now. We can all

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.080
Just stop

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.800
But we can't

01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:17.080
We could

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:19.080
but we can't

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.560
And so we need places to go. We need to get through this critical mass where we are

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.680
decentralized

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.400
Get rid of these people and these apps these these networks

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:37.560
We've got to face it. We can't look for someone to save us. We're going to have to save ourselves

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:46.120
And even if you think about saving yourself what you're really doing is is is saving yourself spiritually

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.960
We need to reawaken that

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480
We need to reawaken that

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:56.520
That understanding in all of us

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.960
The reverence for for the natural world the reverence for the sacred

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.480
respect for privacy

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:09.880
The definition of what class is

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:17.560
Like not class like like upper class and lower class but class like having class

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:27.400
I don't even know how many kids at my kids school would be able to define it like my kids could define what class is

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:35.880
For my basketball team having class is when you get a foul called on you you don't go what you raise your hand

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.560
That's having class

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:48.280
You knock somebody down on the court you pick them up if you block somebody's shot you don't flex in front of them you walk

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.680
That's having class

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.280
Nobody's got that anymore. Nobody cares about that anymore

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.360
It's fine to lie

01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.880
In order to get ahead

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.840
It's fine to fake it until you make it on social media

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:07.160
How many people that we follow right now are faking it until they make it

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.720
Because none of my papers on pub met or fake

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.040
My job at the University of Pittsburgh wasn't fake

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:19.080
My

01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:20.440
My

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.440
Captain in the us Navy boss

01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.560
At the University of Pittsburgh isn't fake

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:29.160
My bike ride to where Binglu died wasn't fake

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.600
My belief that there was a a a lab leak wasn't fake

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:41.240
But my also my belief that natural immunity to previous RNA signals of this nature previous

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:48.200
Pathogen associated molecular patterns or damage associated molecular patterns was going to be more than sufficient

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.720
To protect us from whatever they claimed this was

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.600
In

01:59:55.160 --> 02:00:01.480
2020 the fact of the matter is I was ahead of almost everybody I knew except for Mike Eden

02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:06.040
Knut with Kowski and and and Wolfgang Wodach

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:10.440
And those are the people that pulled me forward to where I was basically if I wasn't already there

02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:16.600
I believed much more after I saw what they were saying and heard how they said it

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.560
But

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.560
Like it or not I had the requisite

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:28.760
Biology and the requisite reading skills to read myself in to figure that out on my own by May of 2020

02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:34.440
And I said it very clearly to members of the worst case scenario team

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.040
That I was streaming with for five weeks straight

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.920
What if we're just mistreating people with protocols that killed

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.240
And

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.920
We're testing on a hot background. So there's actually nothing there. We're just engaged in a great big

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.760
great big confusing ridiculous

02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.000
Psychological operation more than anything else and that's really where we are

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:10.600
That's still being denied here not being debunked here by by professor of evolutionary biology

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:16.200
People with integrity and capacity have all been antagonized by the same enemy

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.320
We're all on the same team at this point and being on the same team with all of those people

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:25.080
With who have all of this insight and courage and integrity

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.000
That's exactly the team you want

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:33.560
It's the right team for us to head into the adaptive valley and find the peak on the other side because frankly the futures depending

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:37.800
The adaptive valley and the future on the other side. I love it. Thank you so much

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.040
I

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:47.880
Here we go senator ron johnson will he at least say something my distinct honor to introduce senator johnson who just held this remarkable

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:55.560
Briefing with 26 27 experts and people speaking about what's been going on in covet talk to us about that

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.240
Well, this is an interesting event because in the past we've really focused on

02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:02.680
The medicine and the medical research and then the you know

02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.760
What the what the vaccines are how they are supposed to work

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.600
How we relied to about them how they can cause harm that type of thing

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:16.600
And we had an opportunity here with the international crisis summit coming here to seepak and bring you a lot of people so

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:19.080
um, organ with dr. Malone we we

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.080
Got a panel of people to talk about more of the wine

02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:25.960
And how how did this happen?

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.600
And really the consensus is there is an elite group of people operating

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.720
Within governments within non-governmental organizations

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:40.920
That are controlling the narrative. Nobody can really point to exactly who's running it who's controlling it, but it's happening

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.480
And the censorship is profound. It's damaging

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:53.160
It's destructive. It's being orchestrated by the vice administration now if we're having a using the analogy of a a tug of war here

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.440
Or we're using the analogy of the train being started and stopped by people pretending to do so

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.520
It really appears as though ron johnson is just fooled

02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:06.680
He thinks that that robert malone has

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.480
There's no conflicts of interest there

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:16.600
There's no reason to believe that that guy might be playing for the other team the team that he says we can't identify that we can't figure out

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
There is someone out there

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:27.640
There's someone some entity out there that's in different governments. It's working against us that that brought this upon us

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:33.400
But he doesn't seem to be able to consider the possibility that those people were in the room with him

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:40.760
Some of them were wittingly or unwittingly on that other team that he's describing that I would say is like

02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.440
Peter teal and elon musk and bill gates and all of the other rich people in the world

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.960
The billionaires are faking rivalries between each other

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.520
That

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.080
That's the main thing that occurs here

02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:04.600
I don't doubt that billionaires call ron johnson and and say things into his ear that make ron johnson believe that they're fighting when they're not

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.520
And so it's not

02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:17.080
Surprising that in the end we have somebody like robert malone still able to organize the entire list of

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.960
speakers at a senate event

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:26.440
But it shows you that we are not going to get free until we change that

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:35.000
We're not going to get free until somebody like senator ron johnson understands the the breadth and the depth of the theater that's going on here

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.040
It's not it's it's somewhere between the sabotaging of a large tug of war

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
with a few people pretending to pull

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:47.800
It's somewhere between that and a full on train stopping theater

02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:53.080
Like i've used a lot of times where people are pretending to do things and they're not necessary at all

02:04:54.680 --> 02:05:00.600
And ron johnson doesn't appear to be aware of the fact that the biosecurity state

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.920
And the billions if not trillions of dollars that it represents would be very willing

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:13.560
To lie about pandemic potential in order to gain the control over the whole

02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:21.560
Of the globe for the next foreseeable future multiple generations even so of course they would lie about it

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:28.840
We we owe that we got that okay, uh, and we also know that people are really spreading disinformation misinformation

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:35.400
Is the government and the cold and cartel? Yeah, um, not not the people that we

02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:39.720
Have had in our panels that are just providing a different perspective and you have different

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.360
Uh a different narrative. Yeah

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.080
And second opinion and that's

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.720
I think so what i'm arguing is and I think that this is a very valid argument is that we don't

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:55.480
I don't know who in that room is part of it, but people in that room are definitely part of it as

02:05:56.200 --> 02:06:00.040
As I heard, um malcom x say one time at the start of a speech

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:02.600
inevitably

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:07.640
Um, there are friends and there are also enemies in every big crowd

02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.520
And in this room that's group of people that was assembled by robert melon

02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:15.960
There are almost certainly people who are working against america

02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:23.320
To make sure that our children are indeed successfully converted into experimental subjects

02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:29.880
And so our children cannot be allowed to understand that the vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:32.700
They cannot be allowed to understand that that

02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:37.820
Transfection being rolled out in the way that it was was criminally negligent and that doctors

02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:45.900
Thousands and thousands of doctors and thousands and thousands of academic biologists did or should have known better

02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:50.380
We're not there. We're not even close because this is

02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:52.700
a completely

02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:58.300
Controlled debate it is a limited spectrum of debate with lots of fireworks inside of it

02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:06.220
But nothing actually happening with regard to speaking to the fact that americans were murdered for this to happen

02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:12.220
Nobody's saying it not even senator ron johnson will say it mary's not going to say it one thing

02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:14.620
I I pointed out that i've learned during combatives

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:20.460
It is amazing how much mankind has learned the knowledge we've acquired over the millennia

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.540
But keeping that in mind what we don't know

02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:28.620
Vastly I mean vastly exceeds what we do know

02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.580
So as we pursue the truth

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.580
We need to pursue with that

02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:38.220
Humility in mind. I mean of that reality. I love that at the very beginning of the briefing

02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:40.380
You said we have to pursue all of this with humility

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:46.220
We we don't know the one thing that we are not pursuing is the possibility. Oh, sorry. This is ron johnson again

02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:52.140
So one of the things that we are not pursuing is the possibility that the gain of function

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.540
Mythology that we have been

02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:59.580
Tricked into absorbing as a result of the mystery of the novel virus

02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:04.060
And all of the drama associated with that cover up

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:12.780
That we're not questioning the foundations of this anymore and we're not questioning the foundations of public health

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:14.780
Which is the horrible

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:20.380
Criminal vaccine schedule in america the one that when compared to all other vaccine schedules

02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:23.500
It becomes very very obvious that it's ridiculous

02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:26.860
And it cannot be real

02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:31.740
And so how is it that the president of children's health defense that knows that

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:37.740
Should know that better than anyone is not saying it in any of these opportunities

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:45.660
When they can characterize the the work of children's health defense, they're bringing awareness

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:53.740
They have a big top tent of of health freedom, but they have no specific goals or message anymore

02:08:56.380 --> 02:09:02.380
Now do you know why I was laid off from chd because they don't like to have me in a meeting

02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:07.500
Saying this like why aren't we going for the throat yet

02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:15.580
Why wasn't chd having a conference in georgia saying that look the vaccine schedule's criminal

02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:20.060
That's how we're going to start with it. Now. We're going to have these other people speak and they're going to

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:24.140
Support that idea. No, it was much more confused than that

02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:31.180
Put together by somebody with their own nonprofit who then booked everybody in that conference

02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.540
From her nonprofit

02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:41.500
And so that's chd and all of those beautiful people and all of that beautiful energy being undermined

02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:44.940
By the organizers of their own conference

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.660
And

02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:54.140
Now I don't think I have to fill in any blanks for who those organizers were or who they were hired by it wasn't it wasn't brian hooker

02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:02.300
Brian hooker didn't pick any of those speakers as far as I understand it

02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:07.900
Think about that the chief scientific officer of children's health defense

02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:12.620
Has not consulted about who should speak at a children's health defense conference

02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:16.220
During a critical time point in the pandemic

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:26.620
And instead the organizer decided to have all of the members of her own steering committee of her own nonprofit be the speakers

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:33.740
And she was paid to organize that conference which is crazy because she was paid to organize that conference by chd

02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:37.740
And then all those people came there and raised money for themselves instead of chd

02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:42.140
And there wasn't even a message about what chd stands for like the a you know

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:44.620
criminal vaccine schedule

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:50.780
That's chd being undermined

02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:58.940
And all the good energy and all the people in chd being essentially hamstrained

02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:05.420
Because the good that they want to do the message that they want to send isn't being sent

02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.980
And

02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:13.900
The bold stance that they should and want to take that many and most of the people that actually have

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:19.340
Any skin in the game like an injured child want chd to take they're not going to take that stance

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.900
Why

02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:26.140
Because brian hooker is not in charge

02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:34.140
Because brian hooker didn't even get to pick one speaker for the chd conference in georgia last year not one

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.420
And

02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:41.180
There are people who's responsible for that

02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:48.460
That's how this works ladies and gentlemen, that's why

02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:56.620
Chd is where they are and not farther along because there are people that are actively undermining their progress

02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:00.060
And keeping us locked in

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:04.620
On things that actually are very supportive of the current status quo

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.740
the current crisis the current confusion

02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.100
And the current new paradigm

02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:16.940
Or what I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain read what I do

02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:18.860
I go to demoy

02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:22.140
Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen. I have nothing against demoy and I live there for four years

02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:25.980
I go to demoy. I infect a couple of sentinel cases in demoy

02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:29.740
I go to seattle. I infect a couple of cases there

02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:32.220
I go to north carolina

02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:34.060
I go to wisconsin

02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:40.940
What i'm doing is i'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition

02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:44.540
These individuals complain again. This is a central nervous system condition

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:46.700
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do

02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:52.140
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms

02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.260
And then what I do the real bug that I use

02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.340
Is the internet

02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.900
I take attribution for that. Yes. I'm a terrorist group

02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:07.020
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x y and z

02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:09.340
These people are really sick with this

02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:13.260
But then I say others who are also infected will show subdromal

02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:17.820
predrome signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety

02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.140
sleeplessness

02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:21.580
agitation

02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:25.900
What i've now done is i've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal

02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:30.780
And i've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door

02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:37.740
The cdc comes back and says nonsense. That's not real. I come back and say that's fake news

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:41.740
And as a consequence of doing that what I do is I create a schism

02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:44.540
Between the polis and the public health system

02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:50.940
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government

02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:56.140
Now I would suggest that this list is updated better now

02:13:56.140 --> 02:13:57.420
So i'm going to read it really quick

02:13:57.420 --> 02:14:01.180
I have military response with the ability to drive local mass casualty events

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:03.740
This is really what jessica hocket has been working on

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:07.980
And other people from panda have been zeroing in on in italy and elsewhere

02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:14.380
And I think it's very important to understand that it looks more like mass casualty events that didn't spread

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:16.620
They happened very rapidly

02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:21.740
As many as 20,000 people are supposed to die between three weeks and four weeks in new york city

02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:24.380
We don't know where these bodies are. We don't know these names

02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:31.900
We never saw any full trucks or anything like that. So this is just all nonsense right now and unsubstantiated yet

02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:36.060
These numbers were used to extrapolate the worst case scenario and predict it

02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:43.100
They co-opted and pre-selected a group of narrative controllers on media social media

02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:47.340
People like Brett Weinstein and sam heris were pre positioned

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:50.700
They didn't have to know that a pandemic was coming

02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:59.100
But why on earth would sam heris say anything like that so fortuitously in december of 2019

02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:06.780
That when the next pandemic comes and 70 percent of the people are dying that we won't be able to tolerate anti-vaxxers anymore

02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:11.260
That wasn't random and you can't see it as random

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.500
A combination of background signal and nonspecific test is spread

02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:22.460
This is something that the panda summary that they recently put out jumps on top of this is the something that I said first

02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:25.260
In may of 2020

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.660
Not because I figured it out all by myself

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:35.580
But because this was what made sense given the biology that we were experiencing that we were told and that was previously recorded before the pandemic

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:40.060
They use the island nations to demonstrate that lockdowns work

02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:45.900
Because they also didn't roll out testing there that was a specific and now people are going to argue

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:51.500
That no, they were testing and there was no virus in australia. Well, then they used a test that worked

02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:59.180
And the idea that the testing was the same everywhere around the world is just an absurd

02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:01.260
Assumption

02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:06.460
That no one should be making because in america alone there were 250 different tests

02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:08.140
Come on guys

02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:13.260
We've got to wake up and when people push dumb ideas like that when people say oh, yeah

02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:16.700
But they were testing in australia and there was no positive tests

02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:25.100
You just have to slap those people down as being ridiculous because you are taking the data from the state and accepting it at face value

02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:29.340
When we have already established that they will lie to win

02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:32.220
They will lie to govern us

02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:39.420
In fact lies are part of the standard modus of veranda at veranda when they do these kinds of operations

02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:42.060
He just told you

02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:47.740
The financial and legal incentive to call covid complicated things

02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:55.740
The coordinated propaganda campaign to drill the worst case scenario was extremely important and most of these people were involved in it in one way or another

02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:58.700
The

02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:06.860
Once you started orchestrating the acceptance of the transfection to come by blaming these crazy things

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:12.060
On the s1 or on the furin cleavage site or on the hib inserts

02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:17.980
You started to confound and to confuse people to

02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:23.580
Think that the virus was capable of amazing things that in reality those amazing things

02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:25.980
the jessica rose talked about this

02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:34.220
Huge list of side effects of of adverse effects that come from these things was expected because that's how awful of an idea

02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:37.660
Transpecting healthy humans was and remains

02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:43.820
And a lot of these people should have known that in 2020 like I did

02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:52.460
And so you increase the all-cause mortality that's happening by changing all these things under the

02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:57.500
pretense of fear and uncertainty and doubt about the worst case scenario to come

02:17:58.060 --> 02:18:05.340
And then you blame it all on the novel virus and you continue to do it by having senate meetings where you don't acknowledge that protocols killed people

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:11.900
Hardly at all. You don't say that that opioid deaths have skyrocketed over the last five years

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:18.220
But over the last 10 years have been rising very consistently and shouldn't be called all cause mortality

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:24.300
But should be caused excess deaths all the time because nobody should be dying from opioid overdose

02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:32.780
Nobody should be dying from from drunk driving those are all excess deaths

02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:39.500
And if you calculate excess deaths based on how many people died last year of all those causes you are missing murders

02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:41.820
And

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:48.540
Now if you can process that if you can hold that thought in your head understand that with intention

02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:51.740
Understand with good planning

02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:55.100
Understand with a spectacular commitment to lying

02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:00.540
You can accomplish a hell of a lot more than has ever been accomplished before

02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:05.660
Now combine that with censorship on the internet and and false

02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:13.260
amplification of other peoples and false amplification of limited spectrums of debate and making them seem like they're really important

02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:21.980
Can fool a whole globe into thinking that there's a cover up of a lab leak happening and fool a whole globe into thinking that they witnessed

02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:25.660
The spread of a gain of function virus and that's what these people did

02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:33.500
And that's why solving the mystery of the gain of function lab leak cover up gets the public to accept the entire paradigm

02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:36.860
And then more importantly it gets us to teach it to our kids

02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:47.020
And it's hidden behind this

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:52.860
It's hidden behind that fate

02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:56.860
I'm going to escape from this and start it up again

02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:01.580
Because sometimes it just gets tired

02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:05.580
Oh

02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:07.580
My goodness, what's happening here

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:10.060
It's very tired

02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:15.100
And so here we are I got the the the the narrative as I summarized it back here

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:19.500
And then I've got some of these other positions here, you know, nature's scary enough

02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:23.340
Um, the faith is basically right here, right? This is the

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.460
The main faith of the show right here

02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:31.180
Um gain of function lab leak is the worst case scenario or a lot of these people over here

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:36.060
Viruses are real but they lied about covid you might characterize a lot of these people like this

02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:39.980
And then as you move over here, there are no viruses and all of these are just

02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:42.300
I'm not arguing or

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:44.300
Selecting any of these. I'm just showing you

02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:51.100
Where we are and what we're talking about and then they added some more stuff recently like israel has the right to defend itself or

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:58.940
Vaccines are contaminated or the dod is responsible or the vaccine saved millions and then we got more arguing about that stuff

02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:03.660
But what you don't see

02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:09.820
And what you can see very very plain as day if you just open your eyes

02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:14.220
Is that they murdered americans to take over the world?

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.900
New york city

02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:24.780
And the story of new york city that jessica hocket is telling and comparing into chicago for example

02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:27.660
That story was sufficient

02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:38.060
And if they indeed if there really was 26,000 people that were killed by a combination of protocols and lack of antibiotics and whatever else they did

02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:43.340
Remdesivir whatever. I don't know they didn't use remdesivir right away. I don't think in new york city

02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:48.140
And they murdered americans in order to sustain the illusion

02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:53.100
Of a pandemic and to sustain the fear of worst case scenario

02:21:53.900 --> 02:22:00.620
And we're not talking about it. Then all of these people are in trouble. All of these people are against america

02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:06.300
Now it's very strange that almost all the no virus people

02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:09.500
Except for the one that had a grant to do

02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:12.620
biometrics in prisons

02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:13.900
and

02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:20.460
A picture of him shaking hands with andrew quomo is the only american in that group up there of no virus people

02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:23.340
Everybody else is actually five ice countries

02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:34.620
And so you can see very clearly they needed to they need to have the world

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:38.380
Turn against america. So what what what

02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:43.340
James giordano is talking about. I think

02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:47.580
Yes, he's telling the story about how one country could attack another country

02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:52.220
But what we're seeing here is actually a fracturing of the western world

02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:56.460
Against america and the only way for america to

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:01.580
Only way for us to fix it is for america to pull up its big boy pants

02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:08.300
Admit that we have to admit that we lost control of our government and take control back again

02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:16.940
We have to advocate for national sovereignty around the world. We have to advocate for global cooperation and diplomacy

02:23:18.460 --> 02:23:26.300
And we have to fight against as nick hudson said so so well anything that is advocated as a global problem

02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:31.660
Anything that is advocated as a global solution must be rejected

02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:35.020
Because they murdered people to take over the world

02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:38.380
They have lied to people to take over the world

02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:42.860
And more importantly they have murdered americans because it is the

02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:50.540
The trust in america's leadership it is the ability for america to lead based on its legislative

02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:53.500
system

02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.500
And the rights codified within it

02:23:56.780 --> 02:23:58.780
That they needed to take down

02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:03.020
And so this is an operation against america. That's why we are in the most danger

02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:07.900
That's why they're that we need to pull our pants up and take take control

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:11.660
And that's why they want us to fight the who and not

02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:13.260
Congress

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:21.020
That's why they want us to advocate for congress to do an investigation because then it will be the system investigating itself

02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:31.020
We need to get our spiritual and moral closets in order

02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:37.740
We need to apologize to the young people for abdicating the responsibility of understanding

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:45.260
And for allowing this to have resulted in the murder of hundreds of thousands of americans

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:50.780
And as long as we're not talking about the murder of hundreds of thousands of americans

02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:52.700
Then as far as i'm concerned

02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:56.220
These people aren't doing their job they're arguing about you know

02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:00.540
Who's misrepresenting who's work or who is first on whatever

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:08.700
If you're not talking about the murder of americans in order to get the world to buy in

02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:12.620
I don't think you're trying to win

02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:17.020
If you're not talking about the vaccine schedule in america as being a criminally

02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:21.980
A criminal enterprise you're not trying to win if you're not saying the transfection

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:27.180
We should have known better. It was criminally negligent in 2020 to have anybody advocated for it

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:33.020
Then you're not really trying to win and that's why i'm thinking that a lot of these people aren't trying to win

02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:37.100
They're no better than paul off it who says that if we know one thing for sure

02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:39.420
transfection works

02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:44.140
They're no better than anybody else who equates the mystery virus to excess deaths

02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.620
They're no better than anybody else who

02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:51.260
ignores the fear and uncertainty and doubt ignores the do not resuscitate orders in new york city

02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:55.820
That led to this mass casualty events ignores the confounding of these things

02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:00.940
like lack of antibiotic use with the virus ignores the poor use of steroids ignores

02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:04.780
Remdesivir and medazolam ignores the opioid deaths

02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:11.100
They're all doing it. It doesn't matter if you're paul off it or jessica rose or or or harvey

02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:13.340
Harvey rice

02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:16.140
They all should know by now. It's four years in

02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:20.780
The math has been done by dennis rancor the math has been done by

02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:28.460
Mark kulak the math has been done by jessica hockett and by jonathan angler and by martin kneel and other people

02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:36.300
And yet they ignored the financial incentives they ignored the track and trace they ignored the masks

02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:39.100
They ignored all these things that perpetuated the idea

02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:45.900
Of a worst-case scenario and they ignored the pcr fraud the lateral testing fraud and the ridiculous sequencing fraud

02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:47.900
They didn't address any of it at all

02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:50.220
none of it at all

02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:52.220
In fact, they reinforced it

02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:59.500
Kevin mccurnan didn't say that at the start of the pandemic i was objecting to the pcr test because their primers were crap

02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.900
He just explained how pcr works

02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:17.420
And so again, you know the the the lawyer for chd that does all the interviews with the jd after her name is she gonna

02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:26.140
Say anything about strict liability is she gonna talk about how the cicp and the vicp are violations of our seventh amendment rights

02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:31.900
And that we should advocate for that is she gonna say that that's chd's position no

02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:46.540
And so the all the epidemiologists in the room no evidence of spread didn't notice it at all didn't bother to invite denny rancor

02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:52.380
I don't know the limited spectrum of debate seems pretty pretty intact to me

02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.420
Seems like it was pretty intact

02:27:58.460 --> 02:28:05.100
Seems like we're still on this road where the novel virus happened and gain a function happens and it'll happen again

02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:11.100
We're still in the car with these people the same people that were in

02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:14.940
So many of these other shows

02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:17.900
I'm pushing all the same ideas

02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:28.940
Some of the people you trust are responsible for seeding guiding and maintaining the pandemic confusion

02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:32.380
They're doing it right now. They did it in front of the senate last week

02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:36.860
Some of them know some of them don't

02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:43.100
But at some point we're gonna have to wake up that none of these people are trying to save us

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:45.180
They are either broken

02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:46.780
coerced

02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:49.420
Or participating because they know

02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:52.060
What Brett Weinstein said is true

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:57.740
That we can't stay on this peak that there's a valley coming and that we have to try and survive the valley

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:04.700
Everybody in the ruling class is of course going to survive the valley, but you know us regular people

02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:07.660
Who weren't our houses we're going to have trouble

02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:11.660
Better get some chickens

02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:17.820
You can afford a plot of land, you know, like at the foot of a national park or if you can afford a winery

02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:22.220
Otherwise you're going to be pretty much SOL

02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:30.140
And this is how they did it and they're still doing it what happened in front of the senate was a lot of this

02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:38.620
People doing what they have been practicing for the last four years and enacting it out Jessica rose. Oh my goodness the VAERS data

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:43.260
Brett Weinstein. Oh my goodness the censorship

02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:51.900
Pierre Corey. Oh my goodness. I vermectin was was really given a bad name

02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:58.460
And kevin mccurnan. Oh my goodness. There's adulteration in the shots

02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:01.660
It's all part of this

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:09.500
It's all part of this limited spectrum of debate getting you to ask the wrong questions so that you never escape

02:30:10.140 --> 02:30:15.900
And getting you to think that these people are leading the way and so you don't have to do anything just wait for them to stop

02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:21.660
I vermectin and hydroxychloroquine were likely semi safe

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:26.540
Medications, but I vermectin is probably not something you want to take all the time

02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:31.020
Hydroxychloroquine is probably not something you want to take all the time although people do

02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:33.820
when they have lupus or you know

02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:38.540
Nobody takes ivermectin all the time though to cure river blindness

02:30:40.860 --> 02:30:48.780
And so we are being bamboozled these are part of the bamboozlement to distract you to make you think that there was a novel virus that needed some novel solutions

02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:51.660
And that's not true

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:58.540
The double stranded contamination is being used to justify that the transfection kind of worked it could have worked better

02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.460
But they rushed it, you know because of all this other stuff. It's nonsense

02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:09.420
The diffuse proposal is part of this limited spectrum of debate where it's supposed to get you to solve the the mystery and

02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:14.540
Be further evidence that the mystery is solved and in their deed there was a cover up. This is all a lie

02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:21.340
They created the pandemic with previous scientific papers

02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:24.060
That created the illusion of pandemic potential

02:31:24.460 --> 02:31:26.460
They created the pandemic by

02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:33.740
Doing tabletop exercises for the last 20 years to brainwash these people to convince these people in the bureaucracy that this was the way

02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:36.460
And that this was the plan

02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:43.660
And then they created a illusion of spread using mash casualty events and testing and then they fueled the narrative with worst case scenario

02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:46.300
for months if not years

02:31:47.020 --> 02:31:51.660
And twisted around in there all the expected complications of the transfection to come

02:31:52.220 --> 02:31:56.860
So that when we transfected people we could confound that with the spike of the virus

02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:05.420
And people who knew about the the fear and cleavage site very early and zeroed in on the spike very early

02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:09.340
They're almost certainly a part of this wittingly or unwittingly. They were given a tip

02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:15.980
And told that it would do well for them if they if they if they you know followed instructions

02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:20.140
And so they did and it's a secure national security operation. So they felt cool about it

02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:24.140
They probably were given a lanyard or a or it had to sign somewhere

02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:28.460
And so they felt extra special to be part of the governing structure of america

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:33.980
And that's certainly what they think they are now part of the governing structure of america

02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:34.940
He's

02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:39.660
Brett Weinstein considers himself part of the ruling elite it wouldn't wouldn't surprise me if

02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:44.780
Mary holland considers herself part of the ruling elite or that guy for the center of

02:32:45.180 --> 02:32:48.620
Security policy he considers himself part of the ruling elite

02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:52.060
Robert Malone

02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:55.180
considers himself part of the ruling elite

02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.780
And together they have taken on the task of convincing us that the

02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:04.300
Transfection and the and the virus can be confusing

02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:07.660
They both have overlapping effects

02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:13.100
Because it's convenient for the governing elite to like this

02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:17.580
It's convenient for the governing elite to believe this

02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:21.340
And so Robert Malone is serving

02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:25.820
the elite by perpetuating this narrative by by

02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:32.380
In fact, he could have a special place inside of the the ruling elite because of his ability to

02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:38.140
sustain this illusion of the biology of viruses the biology of

02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:43.340
Of transfection the biology of pharmaceutical products in general this illusion

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:52.060
It's been hammered into us for decades now that antibodies equal immunity and vaccine antibodies are great

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:57.900
Look at that spike protein variant go on into the future and change color like that

02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:00.780
Isn't it such a perfect cartoon for

02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:06.780
Francis Collins to have used repeatedly on his blog during 2020 to make sure that we understood

02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:12.140
The immunology and depth that we could exercise informed consent as we decided whether or not to

02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:16.060
Transfect our grandkids or transfect our grandparents

02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:23.900
We are trapped right now in a new world order

02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:30.540
Defined by pandemic potential and if you want to get out of it, you cannot let this lie become the truth

02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:38.060
That senate hearing was about the lie becoming the truth about making sure that you didn't ask the right questions

02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:41.900
So that the lie could become truth if you want to avoid this

02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:48.620
You're going to have to dispel the worst case scenario. You're going to have to actively fight against these people who don't care

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:53.820
If the cultural cultural fabric of america is ripped in half

02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:59.340
They don't care if there is chaos that's created as we move from this peak to this valley

02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:06.380
And reorganize the way we are governed because they know that they are on the team of those people that intend to be governing on the other side

02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:08.380
of that valley

02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.980
And they are perfectly happy with enslaving your children and enslaving the next generation

02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:19.660
They're perfectly happy with it because has bret Weinstein said this is no way to run a civilization

02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:23.020
We can't do this. This is no way to do it. This is not sustainable

02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:29.740
Make no mistake about it bret Weinstein knows what this is all about

02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:33.020
He knows that they have to invert the way that we think about ourselves

02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:37.980
So that we don't think of ourselves our biology is sacred our genetics is sacred

02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:43.820
Has something that is an irreducible complexity that shouldn't be messed with we have to surrender

02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:49.420
We have to move from this peak to a valley

02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:58.700
We have to not allow our children to get on this train where there's a faith in a novel virus

02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:01.580
And we have defeated epidemics in the past with vaccines

02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:05.740
Bret still thinks vaccines in general are the best idea we've ever had

02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:13.740
Novel coronaviruses cannot jump from species and then perpetually circulate the globe for five years. That doesn't happen

02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:18.220
There are no PCR false positives

02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:25.500
If the amplicon gets amplified it gets amplified you have to sequence it to find out what got amplified and then still you don't prove

02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:29.260
That anything else exists besides that amplicon

02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:36.860
And the variants are not evidence of spread they're not continuing evolution

02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:42.220
They could either be a background that has been characterized and and formulated into a

02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:45.180
phylogenetic tree that never existed

02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:50.140
It could be that we are tracing continued release of different variants

02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:52.060
Because they're testing

02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.420
Transfection

02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:58.460
It could be any number of things because this is a crime scene because RNA doesn't do pandemics

02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:02.780
Because the only thing that they could do this with is a clone

02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:07.180
Because they've been using cloning technologies to study viruses for decades

02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:11.420
So there's no ongoing RNA pandemic

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:18.140
This illusion of consensus is wrong. We are in the fifth year of this illusion and it must be broken

02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:20.940
We don't need some kind of Cartesian blah blah blah

02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:28.540
The illusion is the consensus that Brett Weinstein and other people have agreed on in front of the senate that there was a novel pathogen

02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:32.460
That it killed millions of people that millions more were saved from

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:40.060
Thank heaven transfection works better than expected, but it is contaminated. So we do have to fix it. We got to admit that

02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:46.140
The faith in the novel virus is completely and totally intact

02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:48.940
And it's a lie

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:55.500
It's almost certainly a conflated background signal. It's almost certainly

02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:01.420
RNA and DNA noise in the background that can be conflated into whatever they wanted to be conflated with

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.100
because they did not ever try to be

02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:08.380
highly specific

02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:10.140
highly precise

02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:11.900
They tried to use

02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:13.740
a broad strokes

02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:20.380
Because it was worst case scenario. They were trying to avoid so a few false positives even a lot of false positives is better than false negatives

02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:24.620
They lied ladies and gentlemen, it's just a lie

02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:30.860
We have to advocate for a pause in the all childhood vaccines in america

02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:34.300
We have to advocate for strict liability in all pharmaceutical products

02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:38.700
We have to investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events

02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:42.620
We have to investigate the use of transfection to create the illusion of a pandemic

02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:45.260
However, many different ways that is possible

02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:48.540
We have to take back sovereignty over our children

02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:54.220
And we have to leave the un entirely and that would include the who of course because the who is part of the un

02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:59.340
You can see these people are not trying to get us out because they don't advocate for a pause

02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:05.660
In the vaccine schedule and an investigation of it in america. They don't advocate for strict liability even though they're lawyers

02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:12.380
They don't mention the deadly protocols at all when they're recapping what happened

02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:16.940
With the pandemic. What are they hiding? They're hiding the deadly deadly protocols

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:20.540
They're hiding the misuse of antibiotics and steroids

02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:23.820
They're hiding the misuse of ventilators

02:39:24.940 --> 02:39:30.460
They're hiding the the obfuscation of the word transfection and how everybody should have done known better

02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:38.060
They're they're they're obfuscating the use of cloning technology to actually perpetuate rna virology to begin with

02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:43.100
And they don't seem to be able to summarize across the entire show

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:52.380
And most of these people when they do argue they argue about people and motives rather than the biology that I talk about they argue about my motives

02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:54.700
They argue about who i'm

02:39:54.700 --> 02:40:01.100
Controlled opposition working for instead of just talking about the points that i'm making here the biology that I talk about

02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:06.700
And that's how you know the gig ombiological needs your support

02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:10.780
Because I don't have any other support other than you my viewers

02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:14.140
You are the ones that decide whether this show goes on

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:20.220
Maybe my sub stack subscribers as well, which I don't have very many of but I do thank you all for doing it

02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:26.140
We are at a time point where they need our children. They want our grandchildren. They don't want us

02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:31.740
That's why they're lying to us so that we will lie to our grandchildren so that we can't figure it out

02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:37.100
Ladies and gentlemen, the AI can't do it, but they have bamboozled rich people into believing it can

02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:40.620
If we just had more data, that's the promise

02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:45.020
That's the new world order that we're in and the reality is very simple

02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:49.900
It's codified in the book do and it's so ironic that doing has come out this week

02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:54.060
A world where they completely got rid of

02:40:54.860 --> 02:40:56.860
artificial intelligence because

02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:59.820
When you turn your thinking over to machines

02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:07.580
In hopes that you will be free what you end up doing is you turn over your thinking to the people with the machines

02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:14.620
They want you to think that AI in the future is dangerous. AI is already bamboozled you

02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:18.860
AI is already tricking you into believing that your message is getting out

02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:22.380
AI has already fooled me into believing that my message is getting out

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:25.180
And it's not

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:30.700
Not if you're using their their formats not if you're using their forms not if you're using their applications

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:33.740
That's why we are moving to peer tube

02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:40.460
And we're never going to look back at twitch again. That's why we are going to move to soapbox and we're not going to look back

02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:44.540
At tweeting again except to bring people where we are off

02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:50.460
We're not going to go to gab. We're not going to go to locals. We're not going to run to rumble

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:54.860
We're going to build our own website. We're going to host our own server

02:41:56.940 --> 02:41:58.940
And we're going to do it right

02:42:00.700 --> 02:42:07.420
Now you might point out that other people are doing this there's a peer tube france. There's a peer tube chdeu

02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:11.660
But it's got to be a small

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:13.900
Start and when we're going to grow

02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:17.500
And we're going to network and we're going to expand

02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:21.260
Until we stop them from being able to enslave our children

02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:29.740
Police ladies and gentlemen stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:37.020
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:41.260
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned

02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:49.900
You

02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:55.580
Ladies and gentlemen, you can support me at giggle and biological.com you can find

02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:59.420
Our little soap box at giga ohm dot bio

02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:02.060
and soon we're going to have a

02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:07.180
A streaming platform at stream dot giga ohm dot bio

02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:11.100
You can support me at that one time link there. You can also scroll down

02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:16.620
You can find a PO box. You can find a phone number and you can find links to subscribe

02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:24.380
And the subscribers are what keep this going. I thank you all very very much for doing so you can also contact me there at that link

02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:30.140
Thank you very much for joining me. These are the people that support my work. These are the subscribers

02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:36.700
I owe them really my life at this stage. My family owes them a great great great

02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:40.620
You know a battleship of gratitude

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:43.980
If you can't afford to subscribe, please

02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:49.500
Take the time to share my work on twitter and elsewhere as we move away from those places

02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:54.220
You can still help us throw the information out there and try to get it as far as we can

02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:59.180
I think um next weekend is going to be the first weekend where we might be on peertube if we're lucky

02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:03.900
And next weekend will also be the following not this coming weekend, but next weekend

02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:07.660
Um, we'll be the the the premiere of the new star trek

02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:09.420
Um

02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:12.540
I have to tell you that this week we're going to be on today tomorrow

02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:17.740
Thursday, uh, wednesday and thursday and then I will be off for four days because I will be traveling to a

02:44:18.540 --> 02:44:19.740
uh in

02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:21.500
a broken science

02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:23.020
um gathering

02:44:23.020 --> 02:44:24.860
uh over the weekend coming up

02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:29.180
Um, and that will be it's like a critical thinking bootcamp

02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:32.060
I'm really excited about it. I think it'll be really fun

02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:36.300
I'm very privileged to have been invited to it and I hope that's going to be very exciting

02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:37.900
So this week we'll be on

02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:44.140
Tomorrow wednesday and thursday and then we'll have probably four days off and i'll be back on tuesday again just to keep everything

02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:48.700
Going don't forget that the truth is not available on television

02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:53.100
Um, you're going to have to find um alternative sources for your news

02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:58.700
And I hope that giga ohm biological for science news for biology for common sense

02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:02.700
Um giga ohm biological might be the place that you will come

02:45:02.940 --> 02:45:10.460
Um, we've come a long ways and it's all thanks to people like greg and steve and and rodney

02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:13.020
And uh, I just can't thank you all

02:45:13.980 --> 02:45:19.420
Enough for all of the help that you've given it my family and I will see you again tomorrow

02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:29.580
That was hilary wasn't supposed to be hilary that was hilary

02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:36.300
Good night ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining me lovely lovely lovely to see you all
