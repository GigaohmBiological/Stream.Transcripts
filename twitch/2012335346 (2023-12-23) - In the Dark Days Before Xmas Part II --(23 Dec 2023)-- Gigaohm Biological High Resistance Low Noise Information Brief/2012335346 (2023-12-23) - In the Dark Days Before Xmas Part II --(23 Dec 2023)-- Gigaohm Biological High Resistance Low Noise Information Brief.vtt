05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.880
or so. Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show. This is Giga Ohm

05:09.880 --> 05:12.920
biological, a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by

05:12.920 --> 05:16.740
a biologist. My name is Jonathan Cooley. I'm coming to you live from Pinsirig,

05:16.740 --> 05:20.960
Pennsylvania, from the back of my garage. That's why you hear a heater blowing

05:20.960 --> 05:25.840
right now. It's a self-contained room back here, not attached to the rest of

05:25.840 --> 05:30.840
the house. And that's why I can be loud and obnoxious even at night. It is the

05:30.840 --> 05:39.000
23rd of December, 2023. We are in the dark days before Christmas. And my lungs

05:39.000 --> 05:42.120
are recovering. I didn't cough very much today. I probably should have drank a

05:42.120 --> 05:46.880
little more water than I did. And so maybe there's definitely still some

05:46.880 --> 05:50.280
crud to come out of there, but I'm feeling a lot better than I was yesterday.

05:50.280 --> 05:56.040
This is, again, Giga Ohm biological, the safest way to get biology in your head.

05:56.480 --> 06:03.720
A good friend of mine, Jeff from Earth, recently had some stuff removed from his

06:03.720 --> 06:10.760
skull. And that little flap there that you see cut in the shape of an Ohm symbol

06:10.760 --> 06:16.400
is something that he actually requested from his doctor because of this show. So

06:16.400 --> 06:20.600
I'm very honored that Jeff decided to carve his head like that. I'm not asking

06:20.600 --> 06:25.600
anyone else to do that. I'd actually just, if you could share my work somewhere

06:25.680 --> 06:30.280
where I don't normally get to share it, that would be quite enough. There are

06:30.280 --> 06:33.600
also ways to subscribe and that kinds of stuff. But for now, we're not talking

06:33.600 --> 06:39.040
about that because we have some really hot wood on the fire. There's some really

06:39.040 --> 06:44.960
big momentum. But the train is pulling into the station and college kids and

06:44.960 --> 06:49.040
your neighbors. They're all still planning on getting on the train when it

06:49.040 --> 06:54.200
stops in the station. We cannot let them get on that train. That train is this

06:54.200 --> 06:58.200
faith in a novel virus, the idea that we've defeated disease in the past,

06:58.520 --> 07:03.080
especially epidemics using vaccination, the idea that novel coronaviruses can

07:03.080 --> 07:08.400
jump from one species to another and really wreck one. The idea that PCR is

07:08.400 --> 07:12.320
useful and that asymptomatic transmission is a real thing, not only for

07:12.320 --> 07:17.920
coronavirus, but lots of other stuff. Variants, all this other nonsense, all

07:17.920 --> 07:21.600
the way up to the mythology of gain of function viruses, we cannot let our

07:21.640 --> 07:26.400
children grow up with this mythology. That's the goal is to not let them get

07:26.400 --> 07:31.760
on that train. I've been arguing for almost three years now with this

07:31.760 --> 07:37.760
program, in particular, the biology is the way out. I think number one, if you

07:37.760 --> 07:42.440
want to crack the facade, start off with what do you think about the vaccine

07:42.440 --> 07:46.440
schedule in the United States? And if they kind of flinch, and then say,

07:46.440 --> 07:49.640
have you ever compared the vaccine schedule in the United States to any

07:49.640 --> 07:56.680
other Western country? And you go from there, because this is the argument

07:56.680 --> 08:00.880
that nobody wants to have, nobody wants to discuss. And actually, I think a lot

08:00.880 --> 08:05.840
of these faux dissident people are actually working to protect, not just

08:05.840 --> 08:10.680
the faith in a novel virus, but a faith in the vaccine schedule and the ritual

08:10.680 --> 08:16.360
that it represents. So advocate for strict liability for all pharmaceutical

08:16.400 --> 08:20.360
products that would include vaccines and strict liability. I'm trying to spread

08:20.360 --> 08:26.760
that phrase because that means everything to a lawyer. And so if you, you

08:26.760 --> 08:32.120
know, research that term and learn to understand it well, you'll get why it

08:32.120 --> 08:35.840
cuts right to the chase. You don't have to mention any laws or any any

08:35.840 --> 08:40.720
particular acts or sections of acts or whatever you just say, I want to restore

08:40.720 --> 08:45.160
strict liability to all pharmaceutical products, including vaccines. And then

08:45.160 --> 08:48.360
with regard to investigating the pandemic, I think it's very important to

08:48.440 --> 08:53.400
investigate in the correct direction, first being adequately tally up the

08:53.600 --> 08:57.280
deadly protocols that were used, the absurd protocols that are still being

08:57.280 --> 09:04.280
used, remdesivir, etc. to cause mass casualty events in early 2020. It could

09:04.280 --> 09:08.120
be that we'll find ventilators did it. We could be that we find ventilators

09:08.120 --> 09:11.320
that hooked up to the internet, or did it, we could find that there is another

09:11.480 --> 09:17.720
explanation that we're not yet aware of. And then we have to learn how these

09:17.720 --> 09:22.760
mass casualty events in combination with transfection in as few as five

09:22.760 --> 09:28.680
patients was used to create the illusion of the pandemic. And by that illusion, in

09:28.680 --> 09:32.480
particular, for number four, what I'm referring to is the molecular biology of

09:32.480 --> 09:36.800
the pandemic, the sequences that were found around the world, that were able to

09:36.800 --> 09:45.960
be cultured in some capacity in the current virology lingo. So that a

09:45.960 --> 09:50.080
sequence could be generated and then a clone generated so that forever after

09:50.080 --> 09:56.000
they could be used as reference samples. And it's that little bridge from the

09:56.080 --> 10:02.160
sequence to the clone from the cultured virus to the sequence to the clone that

10:02.160 --> 10:06.800
they try to make as gray as possible, because they want you to believe that

10:06.800 --> 10:12.080
from the patient, Sohomish County man, they got a sample sent into the CDC, and

10:12.080 --> 10:16.000
then the CDC is culturing it and distributing it around the world, or has

10:16.040 --> 10:20.640
allocated it into such small amounts that they have infinite quantities of it.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.600
When in reality, it is a sequence that has been made into a clone and then that

10:25.720 --> 10:27.640
clone is manufactured and distributed.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.320
And so reclaim sovereignty over our bodies and those of our children and

10:34.320 --> 10:37.800
withdraw from the who in the UN entirely, there are people who are more expert on

10:37.800 --> 10:41.760
the last one than I am, but I think it's a generally good way to think about

10:41.760 --> 10:46.840
things for now. Try to bring your government local. In the end, your state

10:46.840 --> 10:51.280
government should be very much under your control. And you should understand

10:51.280 --> 10:55.400
it very well how it works. And you should be focused on it. And the federal

10:55.400 --> 11:00.000
government should, for the most part, not be in our hair. And our local

11:00.000 --> 11:03.680
government should be something that we are very aware of in participating in

11:03.960 --> 11:09.440
all capacities. And it's actually inverted right now. They have our all of

11:09.440 --> 11:13.520
our attention on national races, none of our attention on state races or local

11:13.520 --> 11:20.720
races, where the real levers of power for our own lives really are are or

11:20.760 --> 11:27.320
potentially could be. And so I want to just start again with this because I'm

11:27.320 --> 11:30.680
going to add a slide to this explanation. And so I think it's important to roll

11:30.680 --> 11:34.320
up the hill from the beginning, even if you know you've you've driven this part

11:34.320 --> 11:38.320
of the of the ride before. So they've misled us about the pandemic potential

11:38.320 --> 11:42.120
that's found in laboratories and in the wild and in genetic stitching. And the

11:42.120 --> 11:46.680
idea for this has been brewing for a very, very long time. And I'm going to make

11:46.680 --> 11:51.120
the argument tonight that a lot of the scientific investigations that have

11:51.120 --> 11:54.840
incurred over the last 20 years with regard to coronaviruses were all part

11:54.840 --> 12:00.600
of this illusion, creating this idea that there is a there is a coronavirus

12:00.600 --> 12:04.160
out there with potential for a pandemic. And it's worth looking for it. And we

12:04.160 --> 12:07.960
have looked for it. And this is how we look for it. And this is what we found

12:07.960 --> 12:13.520
in the past, et cetera. Even those papers should be considered potentially

12:13.520 --> 12:18.880
fraudulent, as has been declared by people like the farewell to virology

12:18.880 --> 12:23.880
authors. And I'm sure Stephen Lanka and these people who preceded them. And so

12:23.920 --> 12:28.880
it is without a doubt now that the main hypothesis on the table should be that

12:28.880 --> 12:34.440
these people have gone through all these motions for so long with the idea of

12:34.440 --> 12:42.640
indoctrinating or or or cementing this idea of viruses in our culture in our

12:42.640 --> 12:48.680
ideas, in our movies, in our mythology, so that when deployed as it was in 2020,

12:48.680 --> 12:54.720
that nobody would be wise enough to to snap out of that to question it. No,

12:54.720 --> 12:58.240
no, really, I mean, come on, no, really, you know, nobody's going to say that.

12:59.360 --> 13:05.080
And again, the few that did were sufficiently.

13:05.080 --> 13:12.960
I don't know what the right word is, but they were sufficiently.

13:17.400 --> 13:22.520
What is the right word? I mean, they were not argumentative, not standoffish, not

13:24.600 --> 13:28.760
a little bit of everything so that you couldn't really there was they were they

13:28.760 --> 13:34.880
weren't even there really to help anybody. They weren't even there to say,

13:34.880 --> 13:38.840
okay, so what's the solution? They were just to be naysayers about the fact that

13:38.840 --> 13:42.080
there was no virus and went on and on and on about it's really extraordinary.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.320
I don't want to waste any time with that idea just to say that it's extraordinary

13:45.320 --> 13:51.000
how long and how much damage that the management of that idea did. It was as

13:51.000 --> 13:56.840
important as any other part of this narrative control. And so I've been

13:56.840 --> 14:00.720
plugging Bobby's book because I've gotten quite a few excerpts in there.

14:00.720 --> 14:05.080
I've already read to over the last couple days about infectious clones.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.440
I'm not going to get one out today because that actually went upstairs.

14:08.440 --> 14:13.760
Oh, no, well, that doesn't matter. We'll read one again in a few days.

14:15.160 --> 14:19.000
How the pandemic was created to have I have been trying to explain it as a

14:19.000 --> 14:23.960
Scooby-Doo. I've been trying to explain it as a mystery that we were enticed

14:23.960 --> 14:28.640
into solving a mystery that we were enticed into solving by

14:31.520 --> 14:41.520
people's dramatic oration in the Senate and argumentative behavior and testimony

14:42.520 --> 14:46.880
where Rand Paul and Tony Fauci went at each other and then all the news

14:46.880 --> 14:54.520
programs covered it. The Fox angle and the MSNBC angle, the view angle and the

14:54.520 --> 15:01.880
daily wire angle. And this went on and on and on until it just became

15:01.880 --> 15:06.160
almost impossible for any of us not to get sucked into this idea that wait,

15:06.160 --> 15:10.080
wait, wait, you know, even biologists started to think that, well, you know,

15:10.080 --> 15:18.240
a natural coronavirus is really not probably not going to do a pandemic,

15:18.240 --> 15:25.520
but a laboratory one could. And in fact, Alina Chan's paper, the, the, the

15:25.520 --> 15:29.880
illustrious Alina Chan who wrote one of those books back there, didn't we have

15:29.880 --> 15:35.000
a book by her there? Oh, no, I didn't put that on there because I'm jaded about

15:35.000 --> 15:38.480
her because at the beginning of the pandemic, when she was coming out with

15:38.480 --> 15:43.280
these beautiful preprints about the sequence of the virus being so stable

15:43.840 --> 15:50.560
compared to the sequence, temporal sequence of sequences that we got from

15:50.560 --> 15:54.240
the first SARS virus, they varied quite a bit with each sequence that was

15:54.280 --> 16:01.520
reported. There was lots of changes. And in this case, um, is comparatively,

16:01.520 --> 16:05.120
you know, changing very, very, very slowly more compared to the end of the

16:05.120 --> 16:08.560
pandemic than the beginning of the pandemic, which is really curious now if

16:08.560 --> 16:13.720
you think about it. But that preprint came out and everybody was really

16:13.720 --> 16:17.680
excited about it. And she got her book deal and she got put at the Broad

16:17.680 --> 16:20.840
Institute and, you know, got a permanent position or something like that,

16:20.840 --> 16:25.920
working on chromosomes or artificial chromosomes. But lo and behold, that

16:25.920 --> 16:30.440
preprint just disappeared. The idea that the sequences were, were changing

16:30.440 --> 16:34.360
much more rapidly for SARS-CoV-1 than SARS-CoV-2 and how interesting that

16:34.360 --> 16:41.640
was that that paper's never been published. And so it's actually very

16:41.640 --> 16:46.720
strange because that paper that preprint was very convenient for outlining

16:46.720 --> 16:52.120
this narrative of, wow, this virus is super stable. And also this Australian

16:52.120 --> 16:56.280
guy, Petrovsky, put out a paper that said, Oh, wow, look at how enriched the

16:56.280 --> 17:03.280
fear the the ACE2 receptor homology or affinity is. It's like 11 times higher

17:03.320 --> 17:11.200
than the next closest one. Super. I mean, it it's way unnatural. And so there was

17:11.200 --> 17:16.840
this collective synchrony between papers that people were publishing and and

17:16.840 --> 17:21.120
preprints coming out that even though they were completely different ways of

17:21.120 --> 17:25.800
looking at the virus, they seem to point to the same thing. Oh my gosh, it's very

17:25.800 --> 17:32.200
stable and it's highly high affinity. And it's got this all these little funny

17:32.200 --> 17:35.920
parts to it that seem to have homology to all kinds of stuff, depending on who

17:35.920 --> 17:40.880
you talk to. Well, it can't be any other thing than a, than a lab leak.

17:51.840 --> 17:55.960
And that's actually what they wanted you to think, right? That's actually what

17:55.960 --> 17:59.480
they wanted you to think. So how was the pandemic created? How did they get us

17:59.520 --> 18:06.000
to solve this mystery? How, how were we set up over the last two decades or

18:06.000 --> 18:09.920
more? Well, first they were seeding the gain of function narrative with

18:09.920 --> 18:15.080
scientific programs like EcoHealth Alliance and the program and Ralph

18:15.080 --> 18:20.520
barracks lab. And seeding the gain of function narrative with scientific

18:20.520 --> 18:25.840
programs and peer reviewed publications from those programs for years before

18:25.840 --> 18:31.600
the pandemic. And some of them could be legitimate investigations into these

18:31.600 --> 18:38.600
RNA signals that are found in the wild. They could be legitimate investigations

18:38.600 --> 18:44.320
using PCR, but the way that it's represented as pandemic potential is

18:44.320 --> 18:50.640
definitely, it's definitely story writing, it's definitely potential creating

18:50.640 --> 18:55.280
it's not that they haven't found any, they haven't demonstrated it. But

18:55.280 --> 19:00.480
they have written papers about it. They have written grants about it. They've

19:00.480 --> 19:07.320
given secret meetings about it and, and, and conferences about them. And over

19:07.320 --> 19:14.480
many, many years, conduct regular upper level exercises, drilling the

19:14.480 --> 19:18.160
response to a gain of function pandemic crisis. Well, you know, they've done

19:18.200 --> 19:25.040
that. Not just event 201, but the list is gigantic. The best one is the

19:25.040 --> 19:29.800
spars pandemic from 2017, the one that basically tells the story of where we

19:29.800 --> 19:37.040
are right now, even with vaccine injury having to be admitted. Reluctantly,

19:37.040 --> 19:41.360
after about four or five years after the original rollout or something like

19:41.360 --> 19:47.200
that, it's a spectacularly creepy story about an outbreak of a virus in

19:47.240 --> 19:52.960
2025. And then by 2028, they have to admit that the vaccine caused injuries.

19:53.680 --> 20:00.280
And so it's a very detailed document about all the stages from declaration

20:00.280 --> 20:08.080
to moving onward. And they've been doing this for decades. We know that look

20:08.080 --> 20:12.800
at look up Tara tool and how many, how many of these has she run or been a

20:12.800 --> 20:19.160
part of? Seating the mass casualty events with complications expected for

20:19.160 --> 20:23.200
transfections. So here we are at the beginning of the pandemic. And here is

20:23.200 --> 20:30.800
one of the biggest plans is to seed the mass casualty events with complications

20:30.800 --> 20:34.120
expected for the transfection. And then this is more complicated than this

20:34.120 --> 20:39.200
that because they're also going to make sure that the statements that the

20:39.640 --> 20:45.720
doctors and the hospital administrators make to the to the news programs that

20:45.720 --> 20:50.360
they give to the newspapers that they give to the news outlets, say the right

20:50.360 --> 21:02.000
things. Cardiac, kidney failure, multi organ failure, all these things

21:03.080 --> 21:08.560
attributed to COVID-19. I'm, I'm starting to understand as things that

21:08.600 --> 21:14.680
were seeded in the complications of the mass casualty events on purpose,

21:14.680 --> 21:19.960
paid attention to on purpose, because they were anticipated consequences of

21:19.960 --> 21:24.440
the rollout of transfection. And so what better way to do it than to have a

21:24.440 --> 21:28.760
common thread between the virus and the transfection, which is the antigen,

21:28.760 --> 21:34.440
the spike protein. And so if you can attribute these, these multi organ

21:34.440 --> 21:40.080
failures, these neural pathic events, these, these kidney failures, and

21:40.080 --> 21:47.720
cardiac cardiac disease, all to the spike protein and call it a Swiss Army

21:47.720 --> 21:52.520
knife. And then you put that Swiss Army knife into the transfection, you can

21:52.520 --> 21:58.760
actually easily see how logically the skilled TV watchers are going to follow

21:58.760 --> 22:05.720
this and say that I understand. And so seating the narrative of T

22:05.720 --> 22:10.720
Morse case scenario, those medlers in the background, seating them with a

22:10.720 --> 22:14.880
narrative that had complications in it that were expected from the

22:14.880 --> 22:27.480
transfection, like amyloidosis, like prion disease. What a perfect plan.

22:29.120 --> 22:33.200
Just a little bit better than the spars pandemic plan where they rolled out of

22:33.200 --> 22:37.720
XC, it didn't work out that well, and then they had to admit the damages that

22:37.720 --> 22:44.320
were done. Now here, if done correctly, according to this plan, they won't

22:44.320 --> 22:47.880
have to admit that the vaccine did anything this spike protein will have

22:47.880 --> 22:54.120
done it. The biological toxin that they didn't understand well enough. And so

22:54.120 --> 22:58.080
they used it as an immune engine, but it didn't work out because sometimes

22:58.080 --> 23:03.960
well, it's got this bad stuff going on with it. And Peter McCullough told us

23:03.960 --> 23:08.440
not even two days ago on a stream that the spike protein is the reason why

23:08.440 --> 23:13.400
transfection does all the damage that it does. And I would say that's wrong. I'm

23:13.440 --> 23:16.760
not saying that the spike protein is or isn't toxic. I'm saying the

23:16.760 --> 23:22.840
transfection of any foreign protein would cause lots of the damage that we

23:22.840 --> 23:26.920
are seeing now. And most if not all of it.

23:30.280 --> 23:35.080
Making the response to the dedicated declared crisis, a national security

23:35.080 --> 23:41.600
operation to restrict open discussion of response by narrative directing

23:41.640 --> 23:46.040
participants, I'm going to read that one more time, making the response to the

23:46.040 --> 23:51.920
declared crisis, a national security operation to restrict open discussion of

23:51.920 --> 23:58.800
the response by narrative directing participants. So as health and human

23:58.800 --> 24:08.320
services, and I don't know who, but whoever was conducting this and making

24:08.320 --> 24:12.600
sure that these mass casualty events happened and happened with the right

24:12.600 --> 24:18.680
outcomes and the right interpretation. Whoever these people are, some of them

24:18.680 --> 24:26.400
were then co-opted. You know, people that really ran into the fire may have been

24:26.400 --> 24:32.520
co-opted. You show up, you see something you're not supposed to see. It's not

24:32.520 --> 24:35.760
what you thought you were going to find when you showed up in New York City.

24:36.240 --> 24:41.160
And then you get pulled aside. Maybe by somebody in in camouflage, I have no

24:41.160 --> 24:46.760
idea. But you get pulled aside and you get told that this is the way it's going

24:46.760 --> 24:51.800
to be. This is how it's going to happen. And you need to go along with it

24:51.800 --> 24:56.600
because this is a national security issue because because we don't know how far

24:56.600 --> 24:59.840
this is going to go. We don't know how bad it's going to be. Thank you very

24:59.840 --> 25:07.080
much. And these people thinking that they were helping thinking that they

25:07.080 --> 25:11.240
were getting on board with something that they wanted and needed to get on

25:11.240 --> 25:14.280
board with it was even more serious than they thought it was going to be when

25:14.280 --> 25:21.120
they got in their car and drove to New York. We're co-opted. We're given a

25:21.120 --> 25:28.040
choice. You can just forget what you saw here. You can walk out the door or you

25:28.040 --> 25:36.440
can help us do this. And if they told you that the vaccine was a new vaccine

25:36.440 --> 25:40.080
that we just needed to get it in all the arms and we would be invincible as a

25:40.080 --> 25:45.440
country, would you really disbelieve them? How many people would have the

25:45.440 --> 25:54.400
courage or the strength of the wherewithal in February of 2020 to disbelieve a

25:54.440 --> 26:02.920
military colonel and his lieutenant. I don't know if those those ranks mean, you

26:02.920 --> 26:07.000
know, I don't know if you would ever have that together. Maybe a colonel and his

26:07.000 --> 26:11.560
captain. I don't know what it would be. No, it would be lieutenant, right? I don't

26:11.560 --> 26:18.200
know. Anyway, major. How about that? Colonel and the major. But what what I

26:18.200 --> 26:23.400
guess what I'm saying is is that we are at a stage now if you acknowledge that

26:23.440 --> 26:27.000
it was a national security issue, a national security priority, then well,

26:27.000 --> 26:33.640
whoever was involved in making sure that the response went off as it should,

26:34.800 --> 26:40.640
according to the rehearsed, because that's another thing you need to consider.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.680
You know, this is just me throwing stuff out there. That's another thing you need

26:44.680 --> 26:52.160
to consider if we know of how the event 201 and dark winter and the spars

26:52.160 --> 26:59.840
pandemic and crimson contagion and all the other countless tabletop exercises,

27:00.360 --> 27:02.080
those are the ones that weren't secret.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.080
Those are the ones that weren't classified. Those are the ones that didn't

27:09.080 --> 27:14.720
happen in the military and go on reported. Those aren't the ones that

27:14.720 --> 27:20.960
happened behind closed doors. Those are the ones that were filmed for release.

27:22.920 --> 27:28.480
And so it's important to understand that whatever plan was executed, there's no

27:28.480 --> 27:34.760
other way to look at it other than a plan. You can rewind to 2020 and realize

27:34.760 --> 27:40.600
that a lot of us thought that it was a spontaneous calamity for which we were

27:40.600 --> 27:47.160
spontaneously reacting, but three years later, sorry, four years later, you can't

27:47.160 --> 27:53.400
possibly think that anymore. Not when all of these things down through that four

27:53.400 --> 27:59.520
years line up so nicely. Everyone's behavior, everyone's words, everyone's

27:59.520 --> 28:03.760
lack of forward progress lines up perfectly if you know which people to look

28:03.760 --> 28:08.720
at. And that's not by accident.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.760
It's because people have been put in place to direct the narrative and those

28:14.800 --> 28:19.560
people are definitely not involved in an open discussion about the response.

28:19.560 --> 28:24.880
They are in a controlled limited spectrum of debate because they are

28:24.880 --> 28:26.800
narrative directing participants.

28:37.560 --> 28:44.040
And so the toxicity of the virus and the transfection are confounded to allow

28:44.040 --> 28:46.800
the pandemic to prove transfection successful.

28:49.000 --> 28:49.920
And there's the plan.

28:51.760 --> 28:57.040
You got Peter Desak and Tony Fauci working on number one for about 20 years

28:57.040 --> 29:03.600
along with a lot of people at NIH and ID and Nathan Wolf and all these kinds of

29:03.600 --> 29:09.760
clowns. Then you're conducting these exercises in in government and you got

29:09.760 --> 29:13.120
all these people running those things. Those things are take a long time to put

29:13.120 --> 29:18.880
together. Then you are seeding the mass casualty events at the beginning of the

29:18.880 --> 29:25.040
pandemic with complications. You tell people to be careful. Watch out for do

29:25.040 --> 29:28.560
not resuscitate those people that have heart attacks because you might spread

29:28.560 --> 29:34.040
the virus and then blame all those heart attacks on the virus blame all those

29:34.040 --> 29:36.040
cardiac arrests on the virus.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.720
And now cardiac arrest from the transfection can be blamed on the virus or

29:40.720 --> 29:44.800
the spike protein. Same thing with seeding the narrative with a team of worst

29:44.800 --> 29:48.920
case scenario clowns that are out there telling a billion people are going to

29:48.920 --> 29:53.440
die and encouraging people to stay home and make masks for their friends.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.880
People that are used to working doing surgery on monkeys doing light

30:01.880 --> 30:09.480
microscopy with contaminated vials of old un unrefrigerated vaccine.

30:11.720 --> 30:17.720
And then after you have worst team worst case scenario out there telling you that

30:17.720 --> 30:21.720
people are going to be able to make this stuff in their garage even a person with a

30:21.720 --> 30:23.720
high school biology book.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.720
Now making the response to the declared crisis and national security operation

30:30.720 --> 30:34.720
means that people can't talk. People have to just take their book deal or their

30:35.280 --> 30:39.080
sub stack or their three topic assignment and shut their mouth.

30:41.080 --> 30:46.160
You don't get to talk about everything you only can talk about bears and every

30:46.160 --> 30:48.360
once in a while please mention the spike protein.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.240
And you can only talk about bears and every once in a while you can mention the spike

30:55.240 --> 31:01.280
protein and you you should talk about amyloidosis and the spike protein.

31:02.280 --> 31:07.280
And you should get really hot about hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin and then

31:07.280 --> 31:12.280
after about two months just drop hydroxychloroquine and stick on Ivermectin.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.280
That's going to be your plan and at the end you'll be able to write a book about

31:16.280 --> 31:17.280
that.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.280
It doesn't matter you know really anymore.

31:23.280 --> 31:27.280
It matters that people wake up and it matters that we snap out of it.

31:27.280 --> 31:30.280
I don't want to blame anybody or say who did what.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.280
I just need people to realize that we have been had.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.280
Some of our friends have been had.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.280
Some of our allies have been had.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
Some of them know.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.280
Some of them don't.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.280
But we need to start saying it plainly.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.280
This has been planned for a very long time.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.280
There's a lot of people who are actively participating in the plan knowing that

31:53.280 --> 31:58.280
it's kind of a combination of not looking away or looking away and not

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
looking away kind of thing.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.280
There was a novel virus.

32:05.280 --> 32:11.280
Millions have died and millions more were saved from came from gain of function

32:11.280 --> 32:14.280
because gain of function is real and a virus will come again.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.280
This is the Christmas story they want us telling.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.280
This is the Christmas story they want us discussing.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.280
The Christmas Carol they want us singing.

32:29.280 --> 32:34.280
Four years ago ladies and gentlemen we found ourselves on this road where

32:35.280 --> 32:41.280
there was a coronavirus leak in China circulating in China.

32:45.280 --> 32:49.280
And right away from the very beginning there were people that were ready to

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
give us a ride.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.280
Dan Sarotkin was right there.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.280
A bunch of different people in the group drastic on Twitter were right there

32:57.280 --> 32:59.280
to give you a ride in a car.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.280
Tony Fauci was there right away to give you a ride in a car.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.280
And so it goes.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.280
Joe Rogan was there.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.280
He could give you a ride with Mike Ulsterhome.

33:16.280 --> 33:23.280
And so all of us got picked up on this ride by different people at different

33:23.280 --> 33:27.280
times jumping in and out of the car that we're riding in that's supposed to

33:27.280 --> 33:29.280
get us out of here back to the city.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.280
Somewhere are you gas station where you can.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.280
Call for a ride.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.280
And most of these people were medlers.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
With just one message.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.280
One idea.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.280
One solution.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.280
One certainty and everything else.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.280
I'm not really sure about that.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
I don't know about that stuff.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
That's not my specialty.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.280
I didn't really look into that.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
Wow.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
That's cool.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.280
I think somebody else does that.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.280
And so they've really changed the way we think.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.280
We had changed the way young people think.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.280
That's the scariest part.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.280
But I've got guests in the house now for a few days that are also very much

34:16.280 --> 34:17.280
trapped in this right now.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.280
Very, very much trapped in this right now.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.280
And it's not a.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.280
It's not a small thing.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.280
It's a very complicated place to be.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.280
And we've got to start to try very hard to have more sympathy and

34:36.280 --> 34:39.280
understanding for these people so that we can find a way in.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.280
Because we don't want to go in with everybody.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.280
Rough and tumble.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.280
We want to go in with compassion.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
I want to find a way to talk to these people.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.280
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.280
Worst case scenario.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.280
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.280
In 2020.

35:04.280 --> 35:08.280
It was worst case scenario.

35:09.280 --> 35:14.280
And everybody that was pushing worst case scenario in 2020 was part of the

35:14.280 --> 35:17.280
reason why so many people took the shot.

35:18.280 --> 35:23.280
Why so many people went to the hospital and got put on a protocol that killed

35:23.280 --> 35:24.280
them.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.280
Anybody that was pushing the worst case scenario.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.280
The red dragon event.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.280
The laboratory leak.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.280
The deadly virus made by gain of function.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.280
The most contagious virus in history.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.280
Anybody that was pushing that is responsible for people going to the

35:46.280 --> 35:50.280
hospital and getting put out a deadly protocol and is responsible for

35:50.280 --> 35:53.280
enabling billions of people.

35:55.280 --> 36:00.280
To be injected with a lipid nanoparticle RNA DNA concoction medicine.

36:01.280 --> 36:06.280
Then in the best case scenario.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.280
Transfected them with a protein that somebody intended.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.280
That's the best case scenario.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.280
The worst case scenarios are are a bouquet.

36:18.280 --> 36:22.280
And so I still am kind of having a hard time understanding how it is

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
that we aren't breaking free quite yet.

36:26.280 --> 36:30.280
But it's because people are still just riding in the car.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.280
And they're still listening to the people that are in the car with

36:34.280 --> 36:38.280
them and they haven't paid enough attention in order to know that

36:38.280 --> 36:41.280
these people are manipulating them that these people are misleading

36:41.280 --> 36:43.280
them that we are being taken.

36:45.280 --> 36:49.280
And we have been taken because it is we are going into the fifth year

36:50.280 --> 36:58.280
2020 2021 2022 2023 2024.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.280
I didn't think it's I didn't think it would be possible.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.280
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.280
Oh, I didn't change that scenario.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.280
I'm afraid.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.280
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
essentially a worst case scenario.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.280
I'm afraid that I mean, what does this mean?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
Doesn't this tell you something doesn't this mean?

37:33.280 --> 37:35.280
Doesn't this mean something?

37:35.280 --> 37:37.280
Is this a glitch in the matrix?

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
Is this a what's going on here?

37:43.280 --> 37:48.280
What could this be other than an obvious sign that we have been

37:48.280 --> 37:49.280
manipulated?

37:51.280 --> 37:56.280
An obvious sign that there are hucksters and medlers around who

37:56.280 --> 37:57.280
maybe have been paid.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
I don't know.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.280
And I don't know by who.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.280
To seed a worst case scenario to make sure that the fear

38:05.280 --> 38:09.280
uncertainty and doubt and the confusion that comes from those

38:09.280 --> 38:15.280
three would be present long enough to run the clock out.

38:16.280 --> 38:19.280
And what are we running the clock out on the control group,

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
of course?

38:22.280 --> 38:24.280
The people who can show you that the

38:24.280 --> 38:28.280
transfection caused those problems, not the virus, but the

38:28.280 --> 38:29.280
transfection.

38:31.280 --> 38:36.280
And the unfortunate thing is, is that they really planned not to

38:36.280 --> 38:38.280
have a control group at this stage.

38:38.280 --> 38:42.280
They really planned not to have a control group at this stage.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.280
They thought they'd at least get you.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.280
They thought they'd at least get you with a flu vaccine.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.280
But it's over now.

38:52.280 --> 38:55.280
And if we keep the steady pressure on, it will end.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.280
I don't know why the heater's running for so long.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.280
Go turn it off.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.280
No more free fries with the booster.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.280
I mean, it's a total rip off now.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.280
And so the latest sort of wackiness going on with Dr.

39:18.280 --> 39:22.280
Robert Malone, undisputed inventor of the RNA vaccines,

39:22.280 --> 39:26.280
chief disambiguation wizards, bioethics, expert

39:26.280 --> 39:29.280
vaccinologist, virologist, immunologist, clinical trial

39:29.280 --> 39:31.280
specialist, and grant consultant.

39:33.280 --> 39:37.280
Robert Malone responded to a random account on Twitter,

39:39.280 --> 39:43.280
at least as far as I know, a random account, who was

39:43.280 --> 39:46.280
replying to a previous tweet of Robert Malone's and saying

39:46.280 --> 39:49.280
that not Trump, but Kennedy needs to be elected.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
And with all due respect,

39:53.280 --> 39:55.280
I believe you know this.

39:55.280 --> 39:59.280
And Robert Malone replied, nope, with not a capital N,

40:00.280 --> 40:03.280
does not have the necessary management skills.

40:04.280 --> 40:08.280
Exhibit one with not a capital E, C-H-D.

40:09.280 --> 40:15.280
Now, it's quite extraordinary, really, because as I understand

40:15.280 --> 40:20.280
the story, when Robert Malone first came out, you know,

40:21.280 --> 40:26.280
and pulled the shoot on his, on his multi decade career

40:27.280 --> 40:32.280
in vaccinology, immunology, virology, bioethics, disambiguation

40:32.280 --> 40:34.280
and vaccine invention,

40:35.280 --> 40:39.280
after he pulled the rip cord on that shoot on his shoot

40:39.280 --> 40:43.280
and ditched that career in order to try and save the world.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.280
One of the first people that he contacted or the first

40:47.280 --> 40:51.280
organizations that he contacted was Children's Health Defense.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.280
Hey.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.280
Hey, man.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.280
One of the first places he contacted was C-H-D.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.280
Children's Health Defense.

41:05.280 --> 41:12.280
Legend has it that Robert Malone sat Bobby down

41:12.280 --> 41:15.280
and said that he had to watch my stream,

41:16.280 --> 41:19.280
the stream that I did in the beginning of January,

41:20.280 --> 41:23.280
2022, with Charles Rixi.

41:25.280 --> 41:32.280
Legend has it that Robert Malone was vetted at his farm

41:33.280 --> 41:38.280
over a couple days and C-H-D decided that he was a good guy.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.280
Brought him into the fold.

41:43.280 --> 41:48.280
I think he had some contact with Bobby,

41:48.280 --> 41:51.280
some communication with Bobby, even maybe helped with some

41:51.280 --> 41:53.280
of the early drafting of the book.

41:57.280 --> 42:01.280
And so it's very strange because Robert Malone

42:01.280 --> 42:05.280
was also at Bobby's announcement in Boston.

42:06.280 --> 42:13.280
And Mark Koolack has done a nice video.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.280
We were kind of surprised.

42:15.280 --> 42:19.280
I didn't realize that Robert Malone and Meryl Nast

42:19.280 --> 42:21.280
were such good friends, but it became very obvious

42:21.280 --> 42:25.280
when Robert Malone was there and Meryl kind of circled

42:25.280 --> 42:28.280
out through the crowd and met Robert Malone in the middle

42:28.280 --> 42:29.280
of the aisle.

42:29.280 --> 42:33.280
And they shared a hug that you don't give somebody

42:33.280 --> 42:36.280
that you don't know very well and respect a hug like that.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.280
I've never gotten a hug from Meryl Nast.

42:38.280 --> 42:42.280
I mean, I'm not saying that I expect a hug from Meryl Nast,

42:42.280 --> 42:49.280
but this was a hug that you give to your friend.

42:52.280 --> 42:56.280
And so for whatever it's worth,

42:57.280 --> 43:01.280
Robert Malone is close with Meryl and presumably was close

43:01.280 --> 43:04.280
with Bobby and with other people in the organization.

43:05.280 --> 43:11.280
And so for him to say so callously, nope,

43:12.280 --> 43:15.280
you know, the implication he is here, Bobby does not have

43:15.280 --> 43:18.280
the necessary management skills to be president.

43:19.280 --> 43:23.280
And exhibit number one is CHD, children's health defense.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.280
That's a pretty extraordinary statement.

43:26.280 --> 43:32.280
Now I'm not saying yes or no, whether I think CHD is a Swiss

43:32.280 --> 43:38.280
clock of an organization or a court's digital clock.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.280
I don't know how I would characterize the organization.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.280
It's a very large organization that I just joined.

43:45.280 --> 43:48.280
I can tell you for absolute certain that some of the best

43:49.280 --> 43:54.280
people and most dedicated people in the universe work at CHD.

43:55.280 --> 43:59.280
And it just seems like an extraordinary thing to say

43:59.280 --> 44:03.280
about an organization that as I understand it was one of the

44:03.280 --> 44:08.280
first places where he sought refuge and support and found it.

44:14.280 --> 44:15.280
It's just something to note.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.280
I mean, really, you know, what can I say?

44:17.280 --> 44:20.280
I've been pestering him for a while.

44:21.280 --> 44:27.280
And so I just would like to understand really what's going

44:27.280 --> 44:32.280
on here because I think there's something weird with regard

44:32.280 --> 44:34.280
to affiliation.

44:34.280 --> 44:38.280
Oftentimes it feels as though there's the implication that

44:38.280 --> 44:41.280
he's a Republican or he's a conservative or,

44:41.280 --> 44:44.280
and he says those words a lot like I'm a conservative

44:44.280 --> 44:48.280
or a libertarian or I'm for freedom or something like that.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.280
But I think his previous history is basically democratic.

44:53.280 --> 44:58.280
I think all of their previous sort of online signature is kind

44:58.280 --> 45:00.280
of more or less democratic.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.280
And his good friend Steve Kirsch is a very large donor

45:03.280 --> 45:07.280
to the Democratic National Committee or with DNC or whatever.

45:07.280 --> 45:13.280
So it's hard for me to see congruence

45:13.280 --> 45:14.280
here.

45:14.280 --> 45:18.280
I don't know what's going on, but I know that this is a very

45:18.280 --> 45:24.280
feels like it's a very off-tech tweet.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.280
We'll just see what we'll see what happens after this.

45:30.280 --> 45:33.280
You know, Jesse Ventura might call Bobby and run for president.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.280
And then, you know, a couple months later he could get,

45:37.280 --> 45:40.280
you know, somehow taken out of the picture and then Bobby could

45:40.280 --> 45:44.280
become president just like his chapter 13 in his book called

45:45.280 --> 45:47.280
Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.280
That was funny last night, right?

45:55.280 --> 45:57.280
So the bad idea is keep spreading.

45:59.280 --> 46:03.280
And Henry Kissinger's idea keeps spreading very well.

46:03.280 --> 46:07.280
This manner of governing is working very well, especially with the

46:07.280 --> 46:10.280
Internet and the algorithms turned against us.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.280
This is an interesting video that I thought you'd just be

46:15.280 --> 46:16.280
interested in hearing.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.280
This was like last night.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.280
If he had wanted to argue that he could not get a fair trial in

46:22.280 --> 46:25.280
Washington, then the legal system is such that he could have made

46:25.280 --> 46:26.280
that argument.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.280
He did.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.280
They said no.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.280
And they said no.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.280
Listen, this is interesting.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.280
There's going to be a civil war in this country.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.280
You're saying there's going to be?

46:33.280 --> 46:35.280
I think it is an absolute fact.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.280
And I'll tell you.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.280
So you think that the law is being weaponized against everybody

46:39.280 --> 46:42.280
having anything to do with January 16 years?

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Oh, oh, oh.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.280
So first, did you know that there are people who are acquitted on

46:46.280 --> 46:50.280
January 6 because they showed up.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.280
Open sidewalks, no gates.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
Police fanned them in and opened the doors.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.280
And then when they went to court, they said, Your Honor, here's a

46:56.280 --> 46:57.280
video of the cop welcoming me in.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.280
The cop said you're right.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.280
Case dismissed.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.280
Did you know that?

47:00.280 --> 47:01.280
It should be.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.280
Could not get a fair trial in Washington.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.280
Then the legal system is such that he could have made that

47:05.280 --> 47:06.280
argument.

47:06.280 --> 47:07.280
He did.

47:07.280 --> 47:08.280
They said no.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.280
And they said no.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.280
Listen, this is interesting.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.280
There's going to be a civil war in this country.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.280
You're saying there's going to be?

47:13.280 --> 47:15.280
I think it is an absolute fact.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.280
It is not going to be a civil war in this country.

47:18.280 --> 47:25.280
If Tim Poole's talking about himself and people like him, they

47:25.280 --> 47:29.280
can use these terms and they can play those video games, but they've

47:29.280 --> 47:30.280
got no idea.

47:30.280 --> 47:35.280
They couldn't even go camping for a long weekend, I don't think.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.280
And maybe I'm talking a little too much smack.

47:37.280 --> 47:42.280
Maybe Tim Poole can backpack for three weeks and he's a, he's a

47:42.280 --> 47:45.280
total outdoorsman, but I'm doubting it.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.280
I'm doubting it.

47:47.280 --> 47:50.280
And so this whole talk of civil war, what does that really mean?

47:50.280 --> 47:55.280
Like people tweeting from their houses at each other until they

47:55.280 --> 47:56.280
starved to death.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.280
Like I don't, I don't really understand what he means by a civil

47:59.280 --> 48:00.280
war.

48:00.280 --> 48:04.280
People just going to go confront random people in the street and

48:04.280 --> 48:07.280
ask them what team they're on and then shoot at them if they're not on

48:07.280 --> 48:08.280
their team.

48:08.280 --> 48:09.280
I mean, I don't get it.

48:09.280 --> 48:14.280
I don't know what that means.

48:14.280 --> 48:18.280
I don't know what a civil war in the United States really means.

48:18.280 --> 48:22.280
Other than something that would be necessarily orchestrated by the

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
state.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.280
Because nobody in Pittsburgh is going to rise up against their

48:27.280 --> 48:30.280
neighbors or it's just not going to happen.

48:30.280 --> 48:35.280
And anybody that, that tried to do some of those things.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.280
I mean,

48:36.280 --> 48:44.280
24 21% of the people in, in Pennsylvania concealed carry.

48:44.280 --> 48:48.280
I don't know what to tell you.

48:49.280 --> 48:52.280
I, I, I think this is all hype.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
I think it's all stuff to scare you.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.280
And I think it's all stuff to take away focus from the things that

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
we need to focus on.

48:58.280 --> 49:01.280
Tim Poole's never going to talk about the vaccine schedule that you

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
can be assured of.

49:02.280 --> 49:05.280
Because that's not part of the limited spectrum of debate that

49:05.280 --> 49:06.280
he's in charge of.

49:06.280 --> 49:11.280
Not the, the, the shiny distractions that he's responsible for

49:11.280 --> 49:14.280
putting in people's heads.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.280
That's what's interesting about the limited spectrum of debate.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.280
You know,

49:18.280 --> 49:24.280
there's also just a limited amount of debate that anybody can do.

49:24.280 --> 49:29.280
One approximation is somewhere around 39,000 thoughts per day you

49:29.280 --> 49:30.280
can have.

49:30.280 --> 49:35.280
And so if you let your phone or Twitter or Facebook decide what

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
you're going to think about,

49:36.280 --> 49:41.280
then you surrender a certain number of those 30,000 thoughts to

49:41.280 --> 49:46.280
the algorithm, to YouTube, to the TV, to college basketball.

49:46.280 --> 49:50.280
To a good book.

49:50.280 --> 49:54.280
But you only have 30,000 thoughts every day from when you wake up

49:54.280 --> 49:55.280
when you go to sleep.

49:55.280 --> 49:59.280
And so the more of those thoughts are pleasant, are constructive,

49:59.280 --> 50:05.280
are motivating, are not depressed or backwards looking or, you know,

50:05.280 --> 50:07.280
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

50:07.280 --> 50:11.280
It's really important to see that this limited spectrum of debate is

50:11.280 --> 50:15.280
so powerful because you only have a limited time to think.

50:16.280 --> 50:21.280
And so if you go down your Twitter's feed and you watch five

50:21.280 --> 50:25.280
dumb videos that take a total of five minutes, then you've given up

50:25.280 --> 50:28.280
a certain amount of those 39,000 thoughts that you have per day

50:28.280 --> 50:32.280
and you can never get them back.

50:32.280 --> 50:37.280
That's the danger of not spending time together.

50:37.280 --> 50:41.280
That's why I think I like doing it live because I at least feel like

50:41.280 --> 50:45.280
I'm not, I'm not missing that.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.280
You know, I'm just going along with it.

50:47.280 --> 50:53.280
I'm trying to really communicate to that person and to that person.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.280
Because it is really important to understand that we need to take

50:56.280 --> 51:01.280
back our thoughts, our daily thoughts, what we spend our time on.

51:01.280 --> 51:07.280
If you spend your time six hours with a stream with somebody like

51:07.280 --> 51:11.280
Rixie and McCare and what can possibly happen there other than

51:11.280 --> 51:17.280
you surrendering thousands of your thoughts and your consciousness

51:17.280 --> 51:20.280
is prime real estate.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.280
I wasn't sure if it was on the screen.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.280
I had to look.

51:26.280 --> 51:29.280
And so we have had the sense that free thinking is going on when

51:29.280 --> 51:30.280
we've listened to Brett Weinstein.

51:30.280 --> 51:33.280
We've had the sense that free thinking is going on when we listen

51:33.280 --> 51:36.280
to Robert Malone, but it is an illusion that very few of us

51:36.280 --> 51:39.280
could see through, but we did.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.280
And it's starting to spread now.

51:41.280 --> 51:46.280
It's starting to crack now because they were supposed to run out the clock.

51:46.280 --> 51:49.280
But the clock is running out faster than they thought it would.

51:49.280 --> 51:54.280
We've gotten farther down the fuse than they thought we would.

51:54.280 --> 51:59.280
They thought they could delay us with the DNA.

51:59.280 --> 52:04.280
They thought they could delay us with the with the frame shift.

52:05.280 --> 52:07.280
It didn't delay us at all.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.280
It wasn't a story at all.

52:08.280 --> 52:14.280
It went away immediately because people aren't buying it anymore.

52:14.280 --> 52:18.280
The only thing they have left is to make sure that we don't find out

52:18.280 --> 52:21.280
how many of us are actually awake.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.280
That's what's most frightening right now because I think it's even

52:24.280 --> 52:28.280
possible that most of us are in America, especially in places like

52:28.280 --> 52:33.280
Pittsburgh, there are almost no one on board anymore.

52:33.280 --> 52:37.280
With the exception of those people that are really, you know,

52:37.280 --> 52:42.280
working at the universities, working in the schools.

52:42.280 --> 52:45.280
That sounds terrifying when I speak it out loud, but those are the people

52:45.280 --> 52:46.280
that are still in.

52:46.280 --> 52:52.280
Everybody else isn't even the people that work there as janitors

52:52.280 --> 52:56.280
and service people they're not in.

52:56.280 --> 53:01.280
They have to pretend they're in, but they're not in.

53:01.280 --> 53:05.280
These people are pretending they're in, but they're not in.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.280
That's what happened at the beginning of the pandemic.

53:08.280 --> 53:12.280
That's what Jordan Peterson did almost four months into the

53:12.280 --> 53:13.280
pandemic.

53:13.280 --> 53:20.280
He told us to wait six months more.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
And so that's right.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.280
This new world order is just continuing to go on.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.280
That's why Catholic did come out.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.280
That's for sure why he came out.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.280
They need to run out the clock.

53:30.280 --> 53:39.280
So they called in for a sub a ref sub sub ref.

53:39.280 --> 53:43.280
And Catholic has come in now to add a little bit of, you know,

53:43.280 --> 53:45.280
twist to the sandwich, but it's the same.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.280
It's the same hamburger.

53:47.280 --> 53:49.280
The lettuce is now on the bottom.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.280
That's all.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.280
Because it's the same story that it came from a lab that that

53:55.280 --> 53:58.280
potential is real that we had to do something that all these people

53:58.280 --> 54:01.280
have been preparing for this and look at came.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.280
But then we did stuff wrong.

54:03.280 --> 54:06.280
It's the worst of the narratives.

54:06.280 --> 54:10.280
Because that's the one that's the closest to becoming the truth.

54:10.280 --> 54:14.280
That's the lie that's closest to becoming the truth right now.

54:14.280 --> 54:18.280
There are six books that I can had on the screen 15 minutes ago

54:18.280 --> 54:27.280
that all categorize and characterize and tell that story.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.280
It's crazy.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.280
But Bobby's book has the other biology in it.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.280
Bobby's book has the other side in it.

54:36.280 --> 54:44.280
Bobby's book has the text in it that can you, you can see it.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.280
We got it in there.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.280
A lot of people aren't happy with what got in there.

54:49.280 --> 54:55.280
I don't know what to say other than, you know, I didn't write the book.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.280
And there may be another one.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.280
Because we don't want the lie to become truth.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.280
We need people to understand what the truth really is.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.280
I think we're really close to being able to speak it out loud.

55:08.280 --> 55:12.280
And the challenge really is to get people to understand that it was,

55:12.280 --> 55:14.280
it was pantomime.

55:14.280 --> 55:20.280
So much of it was pantomime so much about the debate in the beginning.

55:20.280 --> 55:23.280
The arguments in the beginning was pantomime.

55:28.280 --> 55:36.280
And I can't stress enough how I think one of the most important pantomimes to understand is

55:36.280 --> 55:39.280
hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.

55:39.280 --> 55:45.280
Two substances probably that could be expected reasonably well not to do any harm and maybe even have some

55:45.280 --> 55:50.280
general benefits given the poor health of the American population.

55:50.280 --> 56:04.280
And they were applied as part of a narrative where there was a novel virus that needed novel treatments.

56:04.280 --> 56:14.280
And these treatments were almost always deployed with antibiotics and steroids, azithromycin and dexamethasone.

56:15.280 --> 56:27.280
And so the representation of Ivermectin as being effective and prophylactically useful by Brett Weinstein was likely part of this.

56:27.280 --> 56:32.280
He doesn't ever need to know that that's what he did.

56:32.280 --> 56:38.280
But that's probably what he was set up to do, asked to do.

56:39.280 --> 56:46.280
Maybe he just thought that doing it was the right thing to do given that Robert Malone and some of these other people, you know, they're there.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.280
I don't know who manipulated who.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.280
I don't know who misled who.

56:51.280 --> 56:58.280
I just know that in the end, people were convinced to participate in a train stopping and starting.

56:59.280 --> 57:00.280
Pantamine.

57:01.280 --> 57:08.280
And not just one guy, but hundreds of them along this train to make it look like they were really stopping and really starting it.

57:09.280 --> 57:15.280
And really trying to fight for our freedom. You know, we're in this hot tub for you guys.

57:15.280 --> 57:20.280
We're taking pictures of our fancy shoes because we're doing this for you guys.

57:20.280 --> 57:26.280
We're flying all around the world for COVID summits because we want to save you guys.

57:29.280 --> 57:34.280
We're donating all of our money from our sub stack to no, sorry.

57:35.280 --> 57:39.280
I'm raising money for. Oh, yeah.

57:47.280 --> 57:55.280
And so we've been converting this. I think I'm going to stop here though. I was supposed to actually stop one pack here. Yeah, I want to stop right here because.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.280
Not only are we told this, but these these.

58:00.280 --> 58:07.280
We'll come back to the mystery viruses because what I really would like to play is this. I got this video up here.

58:08.280 --> 58:10.280
I think. Yeah.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
It is a video by a Spanish.

58:16.280 --> 58:20.280
A Spanish molecular biologist, a Spanish chemist.

58:21.280 --> 58:25.280
I think he will introduce his his background hits a rather.

58:26.280 --> 58:30.280
I'm going to speed up the film a little bit. It should take us about 30 minutes.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.280
And what I would like you to recall.

58:34.280 --> 58:36.280
I'm sorry. This is such a broken up show.

58:37.280 --> 58:48.280
I would I would like you to recall the lipid nanoparticle preparation expert that was on the McCann broadcast a number of times by the name of Christine Grace.

58:48.280 --> 58:54.280
She also presented at this Vay John health three day long COVID.

58:56.280 --> 59:01.280
Thing with with a German dude who was selling supplements.

59:02.280 --> 59:07.280
And that German dude has actually been streaming with McCann lately, which is very interesting.

59:09.280 --> 59:16.280
As you know, Peter McCulloch is the chief scientific officer of the wellness company, another supplements company.

59:17.280 --> 59:31.280
So it's interesting to think about kind of the money that's moving around why it's moving around and what roles these people would play in moving that money around or or creating the momentum for those products to be sold.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.280
And of course, all the detox to the spike protein.

59:36.280 --> 59:40.280
It really feeds into this idea that the spike protein was toxic.

59:40.280 --> 59:56.280
This spike protein was toxic for the virus and for the shot and confuses people on that as a connection between the cause and effect or an illusion of cause and effect that's actually not there and divorces that from blaming it on transfection.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.280
And that's really the fundamental enchantment that they are casting here.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:08.280
Besides the preservation of the vaccine schedule in general as the main ritual of public health.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:28.280
But with regard to transfection, it is especially important to see that they still are basically in the same place where they're trying to say that the virus did bad things, including multi system inflammatory syndrome and all kinds of other stuff that the.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280
Transfection was expected to do.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:41.280
And I think this is the biggest trick that they pulled on us. It's absolutely what they did and what they would have done if they would have planned this appropriately.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:56.280
They not only seeded the mass casualty events with a predisposition to create cardiac events in order to be able to blame cardiac events on a spike protein of the virus.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:05.280
And therefore the cardiac events expected to occur after transfection can also be blamed on that spike protein rather than on transfection.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:23.280
And they also seeded a team of worst case scenario artists that from the very beginning were already seeding the toxicity of the spike protein as a gain of function virus gain a function protein and capable of generating amyloidosis or pre on disease.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:36.280
Knowing full well or unwittingly these people incorrectly tied that to a non circulating protein.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.280
A protein that was only reported and found in a couple patients according to them.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:52.280
Attributing it to that protein so that they could protect the idea that the transfection would cause those maladies.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:02:08.280
And so now if and when I don't know that it will happen, but if and when pre on disease from transfection should arise or amyloidosis should increase in those people that have been transfected.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:18.280
These people will be horribly disingenuous about where it comes from and horribly uncurious about whether these people are vaccinated or not.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.280
I assure you, transfected or not. Excuse me.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.280
That's where we are. We are we are actually a couple dominoes ahead.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:33.280
That's why we're able to read this, but without a doubt that's where we are.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:40.280
And they need to try and stay ahead of what is expected to happen with repeated transfection.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:50.280
That's why this idea was seeded already long ago by the same exact people who are still seeding it now who are still saying it now.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:03:02.280
And it will slowly trickle up the chain until before you know it, Robert Malone will say that pre on disease and amyloidosis are rising and it might be the shot.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.280
But it could have been the virus too. Maybe it's this nasty spike protein.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.280
It's coming, ladies and gentlemen. We are now ahead. We can see it.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:24.280
And so if it doesn't come, they're responding to this show right here. Oh, wow. That's a giant, giant ego. Please deflate.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.280
They're not responding to this show.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:36.280
Nobody responds to this show except for Mark Koolack. Mark Koolack is the only guy who watches and responds to this show.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.280
So kudos to Mark. Yo, yo. Here we go. I'm going to play this thing.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.280
I might have to adjust the speed as we're going here. Yeah, this will be good.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:54.280
I think you're going to like it a lot. And remember, when I got off track there, Christine Grace told us about the lipid nanoparticles.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:05.280
And so I wonder if you learned anything from Christine Grace and whether or not what you learned from Gabrielle Segella is going to help you with that or vice versa.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.280
Okay, let's do speed here. Hold on. Get this speed up.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280
Full screen. We're a speed.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.280
Hold on here.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:38.280
My name is Gabrielle Segella. I am an independent research biochemist, specialized in chemistry of microemulsions and colloidal systems.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:54.280
The numerous controversies that have recently arisen around the Pfizer-BioNTech community vaccine have led me out of scientific curiosity, but also from an ethical standpoint, to examine in-depth several chemical, physical and toxicological.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:04.280
I'll slow it down just a little more. Sorry about that. I know this is not the best way to do it, but let's put a number in it.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.280
What are you doing here? Oh, I'm not up there.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.280
What is going on?

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.280
Oh, I don't have anything playing. Is that what's happening here? Sorry, guys. This is really annoying.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.280
Seriously? What are you doing here, demon? There we go.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:58.280
My name is Gabrielle Segella. I am an independent research biochemist, specialized in chemistry of microemulsions and colloidal systems.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:22.280
The numerous controversies that have recently arisen around the Pfizer-BioNTech community vaccine have led me out of scientific curiosity, but also from an ethical standpoint, to examine in-depth several chemical, physical and toxicological aspects, which I consider very important, regarding the composition of this medicinal preparation.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:48.280
The results of my scientific research have been published in Italy by the journal ND Disinfection, and also published in peer review by the American International Journal of Vaccine Theory Practice and Research, with the title Chemical Physical Criticality and Toxicological Potential of Lipid Nanomaterials contained in an mRNA vaccine.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:07:03.280
With this video, we will attempt to convey an understanding even among non-exposed of the subject, but most of all, to simplify several aspects of my investigation that are, in my opinion, fundamental and most significant.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:32.280
The Pfizer-BioNTech medicinal product, called Community COVID-19 mRNA BNT162B2, was placed on the European market with a conditional authorization issued by the European Medicines Agency, the EMA, on the 21st of December 2020, while the first EMA assessment report was released on the 19th of February 2021.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:59.280
What is it? Here you can see the qualitative-quantitative composition. First of all, let's say that it is a colloidal suspension. What is a colloidal suspension? Simplifying the concept as much as possible, I'll show you an example. This is a suspension which we chemists define as isotropic. That is to say, homogeneous.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:15.280
Of solid particles that are suspended homogeneously throughout the liquid mass. We can see in the entire liquid phase, in all directions, the homogeneity of this suspension.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:29.280
When, on the other hand, the colloidal suspension loses its stability, phenomena occur that are described in chemistry under the category of coalescence.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:49.280
What does this mean? It is that phenomenon occurring after a loss of stability of the suspension, by which the particles dispersed in the colloidal suspension join each other, begin to aggregate and agglomerate, giving rise to the formation of larger particles. That is to say, of aggregates.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:09:07.280
And this is the phenomenon that you see represented in this slide. In the suspension that was previously homogeneous, you notice now the appearance of particles. It is not homogeneous anymore.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:21.280
These aggregates, these larger droplets of various sizes, which you can observe, are in fact the aggregates and agglomerates, resulting from the loss of stability of the colloidal suspension.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:45.280
The formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Here is the qualitative-quantitative composition of the medicinal preparation. You can see, first on the list, the active ingredient. That is to say, the mRNA strand,

01:09:45.280 --> 01:10:14.280
called with the code name BNT162B2. It is the ingredient that will lead to the codification of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, in the cell of the host organism. Then we notice four components, which are lipids, the so-called functional lipids. That is, those substances that have a particular importance for the formation, the structuring,

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:38.280
as we will see later, of the nanoparticles that are created, and which incorporate the active component, the mRNA. Two of these are functional lipids, the other two are structural lipids, which therefore participate in the structuring of the nanomaterial that will then be formed.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:55.280
But let's focus for a moment on the first two, ALC0315 and ALC0159, because they are substances that have never been registered in pharmacopeia, and so we can say they are totally unknown.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:07.280
They are defined novel excipients by the EMA, and it must be underlined that they have never been used before in a medicinal preparation.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:33.280
Then we note the presence of four other components, which constitute the so-called pH buffer. That is to say, that set of substances that serve to maintain the pH of the whole composition at a value as close as possible to the physiological value of the human organism, which is 7.4.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:57.280
These components of the pH buffer are, as you can see, electrolytic components. What does electrolyte mean? An electrolyte is a substance which, in aqueous solution, undergoes the division into ions, that is to say, in ionic compounds, electrically charged, and therefore able to conduct electric current.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:26.280
Electrolyte, as the etymology of the term indicates, is a substance capable of conducting electricity. Water, for example, which, in the absence of electrolytes, would not conduct electricity, instead, with the presence of these ionic compounds, is able to conduct electricity. In the formulation we are considering, the electrolytes are made of inorganic salts, that is, inorganic minerals.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:40.280
At this point, a question arises. The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine is made of lipid nanoparticles. What are they? Let's try to schematize, to simplify everything.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:56.280
The typical structure of such a nanoparticle is quite complex. You can see it represented in this slide. It has an envelope that is composed of and held together by those structural functional lipids mentioned before.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:07.280
Within this envelope, there is the mRNA strand that should be conveyed inside the host cell, etc., etc.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.280
How could we represent the complexity of this structure, so as to make it very easy to understand?

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.280
First of all, let's clarify the terminology that we will be using.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.280
First of all, the nanometric dimension. What is meant by nanometer?

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.280
An nanometer is an extremely microscopic measurement.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.280
An nanometer corresponds to a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:44.280
We are therefore talking about a measure tens of thousands of times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:14:05.280
To schematize, we could compare it to a bicycle. Imagine a bicycle, obviously nanometric in size, whose length, in this case, is less than 100 nanometers.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:15.280
And the frame of this bicycle is made up of those functional and structural lipids that we saw before in the composition of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:30.280
You see here the ALC-0315, which is the most important, and the ALC-0159, the two functional lipids, and the other two structural lipids.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:44.280
Well, the nanobicycle is guided by, or more exactly, it incorporates in itself the mRNA strand, which constitutes the real cyclist, the thing which must be used.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.280
It must be conveyed, and which is hooked to the bicycle, thanks to its negative charge.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:08.280
In other words, the fact that the mRNA strand is negatively charged allows a better association, a better connection to the positively charged nanobicycle.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:19.280
Once completed the whole pattern of the nanobicycle, our bike is now able to run, thanks to all of its components.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:28.280
Remember that the purpose of all this is to convey the cyclist, the mRNA, inside the host cell.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:47.280
Once inside the host cell, the nanobicycle, having reached its final destination, gives rise, after the release of the mRNA, to the coding of the component of SARS-CoV-2, known as spike protein.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:55.280
So, I don't know how far he's going to get in his explanation, so I want to stop it here for a second.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:05.280
If we go back a little bit to that picture of the nanoparticle, number one thing to realize is that those are all the little bicycles there, right?

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.280
This isn't the bicycle.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.280
The bicycles are all inside the larger particle.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.280
It's the small bicycles that they're talking about.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:24.280
Now, he does say that this is all the whole nanoparticle, but when he talks about nanobicycles, he's talking about this.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:35.280
These little configurations here where the negative little RNA molecule is completely surrounded by positive headed lipids, that at the right pH are fine.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:42.280
In the right combination of cholesterol and peg and whatever they're fine.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.280
The cold enough temperature, they're fine.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.280
But they're not stable, they're colloidal suspensions.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:17:04.280
Colloidal suspensions that depend on the pH and the charge of all of those molecules remaining stable and not being changed by the solution in which they're floating.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:25.280
What you need to see them as is a very ionically magnet on the table, some of which might be electromagnets, and if you change the magnetic fields in the room, then they might jump apart and go different ways and whatever.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280
This is what you're dealing with here.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280
This is what he's trying to describe from a chemical perspective.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:56.280
These nanobicycles are a combination of semi rigid molecules that when mixed in the right way result in this combination of RNA being negative surrounded by these lipid nanoparticles or these lipids, excuse me, and these other structural lipids functional and structural.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:04.280
And the reason why they're functional is because if their charge changes, then they will let the RNA go.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280
And that's what makes them functional.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:16.280
They stay encapsulating the RNA until a certain pH change occurs and then they release the RNA and that's where he's going to get now.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.280
I've just started over wherever it is because he's such a good explainer.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.280
It's nice to hear it again.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:37.280
If the zeta potential is too low, it's in itself the mRNA strand, which constitutes the real cyclist, the thing which must be conveyed and which is hooked to the bicycle thanks to its negative charge.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:50.280
In other words, the fact that the mRNA strand is negatively charged allows a better association.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.280
A better connection to the positively charged nanobicycle.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:08.280
Once completed the whole pattern of the nanobicycle, our bike is now able to run thanks to all of its components.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:17.280
Remember that the purpose of all this is to convey the cyclist, the mRNA, inside the host cell.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:37.280
Once inside the host cell, the nanobicycle, having reached its final destination, gives rise after the release of the mRNA to the coding of the component of SARS-CoV-2, known as spike protein.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:47.280
Now, that's annoying in a way because, of course, nobody seems to be able to tell the whole story.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.280
Don't get me wrong, I'm not seeing Gabrielle as a bad guy.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:20:06.280
I'm just saying that it would be awesome, wouldn't it, if he would just insert in here that we don't know what happens because the protein or the RNA and DNA and what they made for RNA, assuming that the RNA does what they see.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.280
If you say it does, it's supposed to make the spike protein. That's how he should say it.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:18.280
But instead, he states it very normally like, no, no, it's going to make the spike protein for sure, but the lipid nanoparticles are what he knows about.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280
Just see it that way.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:31.280
Another extremely important parameter in this representation is what is called the zeta potential.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.280
The concept of zeta potential could be compared to the pressure of the tires of the nanobicycle.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.280
If the tire pressure is excessive, then the zeta potential is too high.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.280
The tires could explode, and therefore, the bicycle would not function anymore.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:21:00.280
If the zeta potential is too low, the tires are too deflated, and also in this case, the bicycle would no longer be able to carry out its task, which is to say, to convey the mRNA.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:07.280
Etcetera, etcetera. Another extremely important parameter is that of the bicycle track.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:21.280
The track in this case is regulated by the pH, that is to say, by the buffer that guarantees a certain pH value corresponding to the physiological pH of the human organism, which is 7.4.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:35.280
Well, this positive charge of the nanobicycle, however, has been reported and is known as having high toxicity, as we can read here.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:50.280
Unfortunately for liposomes, which are other forms of nanomaterials, are a little larger than the lipid nanoparticles we are talking about, and for lipid nanoparticles,

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:58.280
elevated toxicity has been reported, which can be a problem for the application of such preparations as pharmaceutical products.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:05.280
Well, who says so? Who says this? BioNTech itself says this.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.280
The very manufacturer of the vaccine of Pfizer BioNTech.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:24.280
In a patent granted on November 26, 2019, that is to say, just over a year before the authorization granted by the EMA.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:39.280
The manufacturer of this composition, a year earlier in one of his patents, declared that that preparation with that structure was not indicated.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.280
Was not suitable for use as a pharmaceutical product.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:59.280
What would happen if I added a pH buffer containing electrolytes to a cationic nanoparticle system, such as the one we've been talking about?

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:20.280
Well, first of all, for the purpose of our scheme attization, we can represent an electrolyte as a nail, a nail that has a positively charged head and negatively charged tip.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:43.280
What happens if I throw these nails representing the components of the PBS buffer, which is the buffer used by Pfizer BioNTech, on the cycle track where nanobicycles are transiting, the track that had been regulated on a physiological pH, as we said, etc.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:49.280
What can happen to the nanobikes on the track, traveling toward the inoculation?

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.280
Well, some nanobicycles may very well avoid the nails.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.280
But suppose that one of these nanobicycles runs over a nail.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:18.280
Well, what would happen? What would happen is simply that the zeta potential, symbolized by the nanobicycles' tire pressure, would immediately crash.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.280
The nanobike running over the nail would get its tires flattened and ruined. It would fall apart.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.280
But you say it's only one nanobicycle, no big deal.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:59.280
However, we must consider that billions of other nanobicycles are traveling on that cycle track, some of which could very well collide with the nanobicycle that is broken down, and lead to the formation of clusters of various sizes of nanobicycles.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:07.280
That is, agglomerations, if they are larger, or aggregations, if they are smaller.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:28.280
This is confirmed as well by what you can read here in this slide, in the presence of the pH buffer called PBS, the one used by Pfizer BioNTech, lipid nanoparticles with a positive charge ratio, like those we have seen, form larger particles, which is to say, aggregations.

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:48.280
And agglomerations. As a consequence, the whole composition loses its homogeneity. And who says that? It is said once again by BioNTech, the manufacturer itself, in the same patent, granted one year earlier.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:26:11.280
Oh, you dummy. And the reason why that is, right, is because the electrolytes that are found in the pH buffer cause the fine nanoparticles to change their chemical composition, changing their charge.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:21.280
And zeta potential, as best as I can understand it, is the potential for particles to come together or stay apart.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:38.280
So it's kind of a charge stability kind of thing. And so the higher the potential is, the more likely it is that when the charge is released, or when the charge situation is disrupted, that they'll all come together.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:50.280
And it's kind of like, you know, if you have a perfect colloidal suspension of all positively charged on the inside, wrapped around a negatively charged thing, then they're fine.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:58.280
But the moment one starts breaking down, they all start breaking down. It all goes very quickly. And that's kind of a high zeta potential.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:08.280
If you have a low zeta potential or neutral, then there's not much tendency for them to come together. Something like that, I'm probably getting it wrong.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:20.280
But it's supposed to describe the sort of way that these particles behave and either come together in agglomerations and aggregations or not.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:29.280
It actually also has to do with the pKa or the apparent pKa of these compounds. And so he'll probably talk about that next.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:36.280
And your factor of this composition, what happens if I'm apart?

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:41.280
Gregations, if they are smaller.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:28:04.280
This is confirmed as well by what you can read here in this slide. In the presence of the pH buffer called PBS, the one used by Pfizer-BioNTech, lipid nanoparticles with a positive charge ratio, like those we have seen, form larger particles, which is to say, aggregations and agglomerations.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:23.280
As a consequence, the whole composition loses its homogeneity. And who says that? It is said once again, by BioNTech, the manufacturer itself, in the same patent, granted one year earlier, on November 26, 2019.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:33.280
They say that using that pH buffer containing those electrolytes, what we have just said happens. Larger particles are formed.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:47.280
And what can happen then if this composition is administered parentially, that is, in this case, intramuscularly, that is, through an intramuscular inoculation.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:29:05.280
Let's imagine that this is a highway. We will call it the parentero highway. The transit for bikes should be forbidden. It's not a bike track. And so what if that composition say, what if that group of nanobicycles was to run on this highway?

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:27.280
Well, it is easy to imagine, in the presence of those nails, they would immediately cause accidents of the kind that we have defined, aggregations, agglomerations, floculations, which are just more serious precipitation phenomena, as they are actual flakes of various particulates.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:45.280
Coalescence is, calculations, and phase separations. A bit like what happens with rancid milk, where the two phases separate. The fat phase separates from the aqueous phase. And this is also confirmed by what you read here.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:30:01.280
The use of a pH buffer, often necessary for pharmaceutical applications, and the presence of ionic compounds, can lead to aggregation of lipid nanoparticles, which makes them unsuitable for parental application to patients.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:30.280
They literally state that they are unsuitable for applications such as the intramuscular inoculation of a vaccine. Who says that? Once again, BioNTech, the manufacturer itself, in the same patent, dated November 26, 2019. That is to say, one year before the authorization granted by the EMA to market the vaccine, produced, manufactured by Pfizer BioNTech.

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:45.280
And we also read, in the presence of the pH buffer called PBS, the same effect, which is to say the formation of these aggregations, these agglomerations, these floculations, these coagulations, is more prominent.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:57.280
Lipid nanoparticles with a positive charge ratio, form larger particles. This is what BioNTech says in the same patent one year before the authorization was granted.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:10.280
Well now, to sum up, we have a patent. A patent granted on November 26, 2019 to BioNTech.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:25.280
In this patent, several principles are asserted. The different characteristics that a preparation intended for immunotherapy, that is, vaccination, must have.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.280
What is asserted in this patent?

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:56.280
Substantially, we read that an mRNA-based composition intended for immunotherapy, one, should not contain in its formulation, an ionic buffer such as PBS, in order to prevent phenomena of aggregation, agglomeration, floculation of lipid nanoparticles,

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.280
with all the toxicological consequences that we have hypothesized.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:11.280
Two, should not contain in its formulation ionic compounds such as sodium chloride.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.280
Present in the composition of the Pfizer BioNTech medicinal preparation,

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:28.280
in order to prevent aggregation, agglomeration, floculation of lipid nanoparticles, with all the related toxicological consequences.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:41.280
Three, it should not be injected parentially due to its instability when it is in the physiological conditions of the extracellular district.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:33:01.280
This, I repeat, is stated in BioNTech's 2019 patent. A little over a year later, BioNTech was granted a conditional marketing authorization for a preparation,

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:30.280
namely, the medicinal preparation community, PBS sucrose, by Pfizer BioNTech, which, one, contains an ionic buffer such as PBS based on inorganic electrolytes that may promote the phenomena of aggregation, adlomeration, floculation of lipid nanoparticles, with all the related toxicological consequences.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:47.280
Two, contains ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, which may promote the phenomena of aggregation, agglomeration, floculation of lipid nanoparticles, with all the related toxicological consequences.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:58.280
Three, it is inoculated parentially, with the risk of causing instability of the composition,

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:05.280
when it is placed after inoculation in the physiological conditions of the extracellular district.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:27.280
In other words, on one hand, we have a patent of the manufacturer BioNTech entitled RNA formulation for immunotherapy, containing very strict and specific indications and recommendations such as

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:40.280
avoid electrolytes, avoid adding electrolytic ionic compounds into the composition of a vaccine based on mRNA and lipid nanomaterials.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:49.280
On the other hand, we have a composition authorized by the EMA on December the 21st, 2020, which says

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:57.280
everything okay, nothing to object about the presence of electrolytes.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:08.280
And furthermore, in the patent dated November the 26th, 2019 of BioNTech, it is asserted

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.280
that type of composition is not suitable for intramuscular inoculation.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:27.280
In the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine authorized by the EMA on December the 21st, 2020, it is said that it is suitable for intramuscular inoculation.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:43.280
Among the main adverse effects that can be associated to the formation of aggregations, coagulations, agglomerations, floculations, coalescences within the host organism,

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:56.280
in the organism in which this composition is inoculated, it is plausible to contemplate and enumerate the following reactions that epidemiological statistics are confirming.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:24.280
You find, for example, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, cardiovascular disorders, myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombotic phenomena, ischemic stroke, peristhesius, sudden metastases, autoimmune diseases, skin reactions of various kinds, alterations of the menstrual cycle, activation of herpes zoster, neurological and hepatic diseases.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:49.280
Thy diseases, thyroid diseases, sudden deaths, etc. One wonders, why? Why a formulation that is obviously admittedly unstable and therefore careless, incautious, dangerous, imperfect is marketed and administered to billions of individuals around the world?

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:57.280
How is this possible? Why? We will try to understand some more, moving on.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:08.280
Now, let's find out how Pfizer-BioNTech tried to solve the obvious stability problems of its medicinal preparation.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:21.280
In other words, how to solve the transport and storage problems of a thermodynamically unstable colloidal system?

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:35.280
Easy, brilliant idea. Bring it to some glacial temperatures. That is to say, 72 degrees below zero centigrade.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:55.280
Here the reason for the freezing, the medicinal preparation called, community by Pfizer-BioNTech, is an aqueous suspension of thermodynamically unstable lipid nanomaterials, which must be frozen at 72 degrees below zero centigrade.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:04.280
This suspension, after the thawing and dilution phases, becomes the finished product intramustually injectable.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:22.280
Once it arrives at its destination, the vial of the concentrated vaccine must be thawed. That is to say, brought back to room temperature of about 25 degrees centigrade.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:35.280
Once brought to room temperature, the vaccinating operator will have to proceed with a further phase, the dilution phase of the concentrate.

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:47.280
The dilution phase is done by adding to the volume a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride, which means another electrolyte.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:39:00.280
After completing the dilution phase, there is the mixing phase, which must take place according to precise instructions of the manufacturer.

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:11.280
Namely, gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake, stirred, but not shaken.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:27.280
The diluted vaccine should appear as a whitish dispersion, with no visible particles. If particles are present, or if discoloration occurs, do not use the diluted vaccine.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:50.280
At this point, finally, the phase of intramuscular inoculation can take place, during which the colloidal suspension, already destabilized by the addition of another dose of electrolyte solution, undergoes a further thermal shock,

01:39:51.280 --> 01:40:02.280
passing from room temperature to the temperature of 37 degrees centigrade of the human body, for a total temperature difference of 109 degrees centigrade.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:10.280
The phases of thawing and dilution therefore imply, on the one hand, a heating.

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.280
And on the other, the addition of an extra amount of an electrolyte.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:23.280
It is important to note that this can increase the risks of further destabilization of the colloidal structure.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:37.280
That is, the well-known coagulation phenomena, as reported in the Tregani encyclopedia, where you find the definition of coagulation in chemistry.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:53.280
Coagulation can be caused by heating, but above all, by the action of chemical agents, in particular electrolytes, that alter the ionic strength of the solution, and therefore further destabilize it.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:09.280
On the 18th of October, 2021, the EMA announced on its website that the CHMP, Committee for Human Medicinal Products in Europe, had approved a ready-to-use formulation of community.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.280
This formulation does not require dilution prior to administration.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:25.280
It will be available in packs of 10 vials, 60 doses, can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees centigrade for up to 10 weeks.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:38.280
According to the singular announcement, the new community formulation, ready for inoculation, no longer requires dilution, with obvious advantages of storage, transport, and logistics.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:48.280
And on page 14 of the EMA report of the 14th of October, 2021, the new formulation is revealed.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:42:04.280
And with it, some details that tend to prove, both on a chemical, physical, and toxicological level, the evident instability and potential danger of the previous composition.

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:18.280
In fact, in the new formulation of community, called Tris Sucrose Finish Product, containing the same active, chemically modified mRNA, etc., etc.,

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:31.280
the same functional lipids, the same supporting excipients at the same concentrations, all the electrolytes that were present in the previous electrolytic formulation, have disappeared.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:41.280
In the occasion, the original product was renamed as PBS Sucrose, where PBS stands for Phosphate Buffered Saline.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:56.280
And on page 15 of the report, it is clear that the original cuminate PBS Sucrose vaccine, injected in billions of doses worldwide, has been modified.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:07.280
Not only for greater ease of handling, for logistical and storage reasons, but also, first and foremost, to improve its stability.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:17.280
This, finally, is the first evident admission, although partial and swamped by logistical justifications.

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:44.280
It is the first clear admission that the previous PBS Sucrose electrolytic version was not sufficiently stable, and consequently presented greater toxicological risks than the non-electrolitic version Tris Sucrose, later formulated by Pfizer BioNTech, and promptly authorized by the EMA.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:44:06.280
So, at this point, a normal sentient human being, operating within the framework of logic, and having in mind the community interests, would think, well, the manufacturer, Pfizer BioNTech, although with some delay, had repented, had changed its mind, and had corrected the previous formulation.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:22.280
The previous imperfect, wrong, dangerous formulation was replaced with a less unstable, and perhaps less dangerous, composition without electrolytes. Not at all.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:30.280
The electrolyte version, unstable, needing dilution before inoculation, remains surprisingly, on the market.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:52.280
Characterized by a purple cap with the instructions, dilution required for subjects aged 12 years and older, next to the new one with a grey cap, dilution not necessary, but also for subjects aged 12 years and older.

01:44:53.280 --> 01:45:06.280
Both versions are, however, authorized for marketing in Europe, always with the formula, authorization subject to conditions.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:31.280
What is now proven and irrefutable, is that the community PBS Sucrose vaccine is, one, unstable, two, ineffective, three, insecure, and therefore, it is what can be defined an imperfect medicine.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.280
And what is meant by imperfect medicine?

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.280
Article 443 of the Italian Penal Code explains it to us.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:58.280
Anyone who holds for trade, markets, or administers, defective or imperfect medicines, is punished with imprisonment from six months to three years, and with a fine of not less than 103 euros.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:09.280
In the notes of Article 443 of the Penal Code, the definition of imperfect medicinal product says,

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:21.280
the medicinal product qualifies as defective or imperfect, if its therapeutic efficacy is lacking or significantly diminished.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:38.280
As for example, in cases where it has expired, or there has been an error in production, or it is devoid of necessary components or contains active ingredients that are not correctly dosed.

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:58.280
To conclude, we can simply presume that the several risk factors that we have examined, and that are reported in greater detail in my study, have inevitably compromised the stability, shelf life, functionality,

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:14.280
and consequent toxicological potential of the medicinal product called community PBS Sucrose of Pfizer BioNTech, causing a heterogeneity of adverse effects, potentially variable from batch to batch,

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:22.280
from bio to vial, from vaccinator to vaccinator, from vaccinated subject to vaccinated subject.

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:30.280
In a sort of, ineluctible, uncontrollable, and indecipherable, Russian roulette.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:55.280
Okay, so I think that's a pretty good study there by Gabriella.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:06.280
I'm a little hesitant to speak too much about it, because there are some parts of it that I'm a little annoyed with.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:15.280
Again, he's making the argument that the reformulation is potentially more stable, but it's still a transfection, it's still being manufactured.

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:34.280
It's still a colloidal suspension, which has inherent instability and still will be returned to put in a place where there are plenty of electrolytes put in a place where there are the pH is not going to be stabilized by the buffer that it's sitting in or by the

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280
trace anymore.

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:58.280
And so what happens to those positively charged lipids is that after they release their RNA, because they get inside of an endosome of a cell, presumably, and the pH inside of an endosome is sufficiently low, that the lipids will release the RNA,

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:09.280
then those lipids, when they get outside of that endosome, those lipids are like reactive oxygen species because their pKa is so high.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:25.280
And so they can really destroy things inside of the cell, they can disrupt the electron transport chain, they can do all kinds of really crazy things that because of their nature, because of their extreme pKa, which is their ability to kind of pull

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:35.280
protons away from other molecules, it's really bad news, or pull electrons, I guess it would be, so pull negative charge.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:44.280
A reactive oxygen species know they're pulling positive things, so they create them though, they create reactive oxygen species and that's the problem.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:59.280
And again I'm not a chemist, I play with chemistry and so I'm still trying to understand this chemistry, it could be that Christine Grace knows this chemistry very well and is just not a very good presenter, but I got a lot more from Gabrielle's presentation

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:12.280
that I ever got from listening to hours of Christine Grace talk with McCarron and Rixie, or even the presentation that she did at that conference which should have had some degree of content in it and it really didn't.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:28.280
Although I did hear the word zeta potential and I did hear the word positively charged lipids a few times during and she listed things that could happen, which weren't that different from what Gabrielle talked about, but again his explanation is a lot more understanding

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:35.280
and more understandable it cites the colloidal suspension and the inherent instability of it.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:44.280
It also highlighted the idea that they didn't use the cold to stabilize the RNA.

01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:53.280
They told us this the whole time that the RNA had to be at minus 70 because RNA, RNA and the lipid nanoparticles are protecting the RNA.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:51:03.280
We had to store it at minus 72 because the colloidal suspension needed to be stored at minus 72. Do you see how deceptive that is?

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:18.280
And so now this new formulation doesn't need to supposedly, doesn't need to be stored up to 10 weeks at two to eight degrees C.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:31.280
It's a very different mixture apparently, a very different colloidal suspension that's far more stable, no dilution necessary.

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:36.280
Not sure what to think about that. But anyway, that's where we are.

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:48.280
You can look up his last name and you can find that paper pretty easy. You just see it there and look for lipids and maybe one other keyword and you'll definitely, definitely, definitely find it.

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:55.280
So yes, I think all intramuscular injection needs to be ended.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:59.280
We do not want our children getting on this train.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:09.280
I'm just going to just going to snap it out here right now and make sure that we we ended on a good note.

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:15.280
So that one should have that. That should be there. Yeah, we're just going to do it. That's good enough.

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:26.280
So I really think it's important to think in solutions, even though I hate that, you know, it comes from a management class or something like that, but biology is the way out.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:33.280
And I think the way out is to force everyone challenge everyone to admit that the vaccine schedule has to be bunk.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.280
It has to be a criminal enterprise. There's no other explanation for it.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:46.280
And in some other Western countries, it's basically a scam, but in America, the contrast, the number of shots, how early they come.

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:59.280
It's just an abomination and we need to speak out about it and anyone in the movement, anyone in the movement who came during COVID and hasn't figured that out yet is got to be.

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.280
We've got to be on them.

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:16.280
You can't have come out and thrown away your career and fought for medical freedom and figured out that the whole system was against you and figured out that everything was twisted and then not come to the conclusion that the vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.280
Stop lying.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:30.280
Advocate for strict liability for all pharmaceutical products investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events investigate the use of mass casualty events and transfection to create the illusion of a pandemic.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:37.280
Claim sovereign claim sovereignty over our bodies and those of our children and withdraw from the who and the UN for now.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:41.280
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining me.

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:48.280
This has been Giga on biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:57.280
I'm very, very happy to say that we are going to continue well into 2024 until this illusion is broken.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:15.280
I say into 2024 because I think there's a small, tiny ray of sunshine coming in under the crack of the door that suggests that maybe 2024 is going to be a little more special than we thought.

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:32.280
There is a possibility that mistakes are being made, that the facade is cracking and that people are going to start to understand what it means when we say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.280
They're going to start to understand what it means when we say the transfection healthy humans has to be criminally negligent.

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:41.280
They knew they knew about the lipid nanoparticles.

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.280
They knew they couldn't control where they went.

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:55.280
Peter Cullis told us that we knew that the transfection would never ever be able to interface with the body and augment the immune system.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.280
They knew it.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.280
They knew it.

01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.280
They knew it.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280
It is criminally negligent and they all darn well knew it.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.280
And viruses aren't patterned integrity.

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.280
We don't have to say that viruses aren't real.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.280
We need to be more sophisticated in that.

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.280
I think they aren't.

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.280
I think the viruses in the cartoons are definitely not real.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:19.280
But the way that the no-virus people have gotten us here is something they all need to cop to.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.280
But they're right.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.280
There wasn't a coronavirus and it wasn't isolated and they killed people in hospitals.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.280
And the part about killing people in the hospitals somehow never got into any of the discussions.

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:41.280
In fact, the no-virus people set the layer of debate exclusively to no-virus isolation and purification.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.280
You couldn't talk about anything else.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.280
And that's how you know that they weren't playing the game fair.

01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:47.280
They weren't trying to win.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:50.280
They weren't trying to find common ground.

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.280
And now we're trying to find common ground.

01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:01.280
We're trying to find common ground about transfection, common ground about the vaccine schedule, common ground about our sovereignty.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:03.280
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining me.

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.280
I'll see you again tomorrow night.
