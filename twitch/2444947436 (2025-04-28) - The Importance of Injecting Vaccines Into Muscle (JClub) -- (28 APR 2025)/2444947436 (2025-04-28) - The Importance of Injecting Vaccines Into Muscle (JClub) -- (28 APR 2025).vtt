00:22.093 --> 00:24.755
Bird flu has been circling the globe for decades.

00:25.275 --> 00:33.862
So the discovery in 2024 that the deadly pathogen had jumped from a wild bird to a cow came as a shock to virus watchers.

00:34.542 --> 00:40.687
Now, in just over a year, the virus has ripped through America's dairy herds and poultry flocks.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.809
It has jumped to other mammals, including humans.

00:44.850 --> 00:46.471
70 Americans have caught the virus.

00:46.851 --> 00:47.852
One has died.

00:48.653 --> 00:50.674
Long feared as a possible pandemic,

00:51.144 --> 01:05.070
Doctors and veterinarians fighting the virus told us Biden's government was slow to act, while the Trump administration has now laid off more than 100 key scientists, all as the virus keeps spreading.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.912
The story will continue in a moment.

01:08.932 --> 01:09.972
Sounds exciting, doesn't it?

01:12.513 --> 01:20.517
At present, we're given a stick, and they put a blindfold on us, and we're sent into a gunfight, and we're losing.

01:21.852 --> 01:22.533
we are losing.

01:23.736 --> 01:29.628
Veterinarian Dr. Kay Russo told us we are running out of time to stop bird flu.

01:31.184 --> 01:37.410
She was called in when the virus, H5N1, hit this dairy herd in Colorado last summer.

01:38.090 --> 01:42.755
It cost the farm about $400,000 to treat its sick cattle.

01:43.235 --> 01:44.396
Wow.

01:44.757 --> 01:47.459
Some protective gear.

01:47.619 --> 01:47.960
Yep.

01:48.800 --> 01:47.960
$400,000.

01:49.841 --> 01:52.804
We didn't bring anything onto the farm ourselves.

01:52.924 --> 01:53.705
There's no front or back.

01:53.725 --> 01:54.526
There's no front or back.

01:54.666 --> 01:55.567
It's high fashion.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.708
It's real high fashion.

01:57.662 --> 02:04.030
It's not clear how bird flu is spread from cow to cow, but milking equipment is a prime suspect.

02:04.851 --> 02:09.497
The virus is thought to linger on the auto milker, waiting for the next cow.

02:09.777 --> 02:10.458
The virus.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.662
Workers here in milking parlors have also fallen sick.

02:14.383 --> 02:16.586
So what concerns you the most?

02:17.079 --> 02:19.822
the pandemic potential for a virus like this one.

02:20.523 --> 02:23.186
And, you know, that is the worst case scenario, right?

02:23.407 --> 02:25.229
And ultimately one we want to avoid.

02:25.589 --> 02:28.833
I can't say that that's going to happen, but we don't want to play with fire.

02:29.730 --> 02:33.651
The worst case scenario, ladies and gentlemen, the worst case scenario.

02:33.771 --> 02:36.632
Cows were suffering from a mysterious disease.

02:37.152 --> 02:40.193
Their fevers... This was like three days ago.

02:40.213 --> 02:42.774
They were coughing, drooling, lethargic.

02:43.474 --> 02:46.275
Soon, there were more sick cattle in neighboring states.

02:46.915 --> 02:51.636
Kay Russo joined a conference call of worried vets to try to figure it out.

02:52.156 --> 02:53.416
I started asking questions.

02:53.837 --> 02:55.317
What are the birds doing on the farm?

02:55.737 --> 02:58.858
And one of the veterinarians replied, well, they're all dead.

02:59.352 --> 03:02.353
So they're seeing dead birds on the farms.

03:02.413 --> 03:02.613
Yep.

03:02.753 --> 03:06.834
You know, we started to see the cats that were demonstrating neurologic symptoms.

03:07.634 --> 03:11.635
And more alarmingly... Neurologic symptoms.

03:11.735 --> 03:13.816
It's the cat flu from the Simpsons.

03:14.076 --> 03:14.796
Oh my gosh.

03:14.836 --> 03:21.018
To confirm Russo's worst fears, H5N1 had jumped to cattle for the first time.

03:21.598 --> 03:25.579
In past outbreaks, bird flu has often been deadly in people.

03:26.229 --> 03:30.992
If you look at cases worldwide of H5 influenza, the mortality rate's 50%.

03:32.513 --> 03:36.676
And so we're all kind of, you know, talking to each other, what does this mean?

03:37.497 --> 03:40.039
And that was a scary space to be in.

03:40.885 --> 03:46.952
Despite the urgency, Russo and other vets told us the Biden administration was slow to act.

03:47.693 --> 03:49.134
Oh, a month before the you.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.876
So this is supposed to be in 2024.

03:51.257 --> 03:53.059
And now we're in 2025.

03:53.119 --> 03:54.380
And she's even more worried.

03:54.421 --> 03:56.283
That's that's what we're actually seeing here.

03:56.323 --> 03:56.823
Wow.

03:56.923 --> 03:57.404
Impressive.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.146
US Department of Agriculture.

03:59.454 --> 04:06.898
required cows to be tested before interstate travel and 10 months before a raw milk testing program was launched.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.540
Today, some states test weekly, some hardly at all.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.581
A raw milk testing, right?

04:13.601 --> 04:16.483
Because it's not in pasteurized milk, it's in raw milk.

04:17.363 --> 04:21.666
Do we have enough information about how this virus is spreading?

04:22.506 --> 04:23.447
I would say today, no.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.888
And that comes down to

04:27.165 --> 04:36.169
Boots on the ground where you have a strike force that comes in the middle of an outbreak and it just starts collecting data.

04:36.729 --> 04:38.450
Oh wow, that's awesome.

04:38.490 --> 04:42.471
A strike force that comes in in the middle of the night and just starts collecting data.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.913
Like they break your back door open and they start swabbing your kids.

04:47.733 --> 04:51.715
Russo told us at the moment, the virus has the upper hand.

04:52.515 --> 04:53.636
I think it's a numbers game.

04:54.693 --> 05:01.396
And the more we let it move unchecked, the more likely we're going to have even a bigger mess on our hands.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.498
Are we really supposed to believe this is a serious person?

05:05.858 --> 05:09.780
Removing them with trailers and driving egg prices sky high.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.002
Now, a new strain of bird flu has been discovered in cattle.

05:14.502 --> 05:17.243
It has led to more severe disease in some people.

05:18.038 --> 05:21.679
This is a threat that is very significant and very real.

05:21.899 --> 05:22.640
Who is this guy?

05:22.660 --> 05:26.461
I recognize also this is a moment where it's easy to sound like an alarmist.

05:26.761 --> 05:31.002
What I'm here to tell you is this is a very serious threat to humanity.

05:31.803 --> 05:36.604
And the longer we let this persist, the greater the risks are going to be.

05:37.084 --> 05:45.047
Okay, so I don't know how you feel about this, but 60 Minutes is the place where Peter Daszak made his debut

05:46.849 --> 05:49.771
and Peter Daszak was actually featured a few times.

05:51.051 --> 05:58.536
Actually, on 60 Minutes is where George Webb made his TV debut as a bad guy in the coronavirus narrative.

06:00.277 --> 06:09.342
I find it extraordinary now that we are being introduced to yet another new virologist who is, you know, really terrified of the next pandemic.

06:10.903 --> 06:18.989
And we're about to hear in this video, I believe that it's not only in cats and in people and in cows, but I mean, it's everywhere.

06:20.751 --> 06:24.634
Dr. Cameron Khan is an infectious disease physician in Toronto.

06:25.194 --> 06:31.479
His company, Blue Dot, was among the first to flag the virus in China that became the COVID pandemic.

06:32.640 --> 06:37.023
Among the first to flag the virus that became the COVID pandemic.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.945
His firm was one of the first.

06:41.277 --> 06:41.817
Come on.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.299
On told us bird flu is just as concerning.

06:45.860 --> 06:49.602
He showed us how fast the virus has spread among dairy cattle.

06:49.742 --> 06:57.466
It seems like here's a map with different colors and circles and colored in States to show how fast it's spreading.

06:57.506 --> 07:03.570
I mean, this is actually worse than the, than the Johns Hopkins map.

07:03.630 --> 07:07.012
This is even, this is like for four year olds.

07:08.376 --> 07:09.957
Almost a wildfire to me.

07:09.977 --> 07:11.058
Yeah, absolutely.

07:11.178 --> 07:12.258
A wildfire.

07:12.358 --> 07:13.219
Wow, look at it.

07:13.239 --> 07:16.061
So this is virtually the whole country.

07:16.161 --> 07:16.601
Pretty much.

07:16.741 --> 07:17.461
Oh my gosh.

07:17.782 --> 07:24.646
Next, Dr. Cameron Kahn showed us a map of all the confirmed human cases of bird flu in the last five years.

07:25.386 --> 07:28.088
Most have been in Asia until now.

07:28.871 --> 07:38.754
What you start to see around 2024 is you start to see a case in Texas, and then you start to see this sudden, rapid increase in cases across the country.

07:38.794 --> 07:39.914
All over the place.

07:40.074 --> 07:48.397
What's happening here is wild birds have infected cows, who have then infected other cows, who have then infected humans.

07:48.617 --> 07:51.838
And so there's this complex web of all of these different

07:52.478 --> 07:55.501
animal species now passing the virus in different directions.

07:55.761 --> 07:57.983
Is this one of those things you have never seen before?

07:58.283 --> 08:01.706
The world has never seen this kind of situation.

08:02.026 --> 08:06.390
And it's showing us that the virus is capable of adaptation, if you allow it.

08:06.870 --> 08:12.295
It will just get better and better at infecting other mammals, including potentially humans.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.558
Most of the confirmed cases in the U.S.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.819
have been farmworkers.

08:17.379 --> 08:18.901
Most had mild symptoms.

08:19.361 --> 08:22.783
the one person who died had underlying health conditions.

08:23.443 --> 08:29.926
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus still poses a low risk to the general public.

08:30.366 --> 08:34.168
But Kahn told us many cases are going undetected.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.369
Why do you say that?

08:36.169 --> 08:44.213
So, in a recent study of dairy workers... In a recent study of dairy workers, the P values were significant.

08:45.493 --> 08:46.634
In a recent study,

08:48.433 --> 08:50.375
This is remarkable.

08:50.415 --> 08:52.538
We're talking about asymptomatic spread.

08:52.578 --> 08:54.800
We're talking about it building in the background.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.724
We're talking about nobody having any previous immunity to this virus.

08:58.785 --> 09:03.550
It's all kind of frighteningly similar to the nonsense that went on five years ago.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.292
It's almost like we're in a hamster wheel.

09:08.701 --> 09:16.710
their blood was tested for antibodies to H5N1, not looking for the virus, but looking for the immune system's memory of this virus.

09:17.070 --> 09:24.238
And it turns out that 7% of them, one out of roughly every 15 workers, actually had antibodies to H5N1.

09:25.305 --> 09:25.925
people are not.

09:26.106 --> 09:48.642
So antibodies to H5N1 are an indication of its presence but not of its where in that temporal line of exposure those antibodies were generated and to what exact damage associated molecular pattern those antibodies are associated with even if their test pulls them down.

09:50.270 --> 09:55.855
And that's part of the remarkable exaggeration of specificity that goes on here.

09:55.875 --> 10:12.628
Whenever they talk about antibodies, whenever they talk about measuring immunity, they are by definition getting you to argue on their terms, using their definitions, and using their sort of rubric for defining all of these arguments.

10:12.688 --> 10:13.969
And so you can't ever win.

10:15.000 --> 10:27.221
The rules are rigged, and the language is rigged, the definitions are rigged, so that even if you end up getting a checkmate, the end result is that your team still loses because you're playing their game.

10:28.183 --> 10:45.258
As long as you keep playing chess when the real game is over there and it has to do with your kid's future and your kid's medical records and the way that your kids think about themselves as sovereign individuals, then you're playing chess for, you can get as good at it as you want to.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.018
You're not gonna win.

10:46.058 --> 10:48.821
It's just a social media hamster wheel.

10:49.802 --> 10:55.727
And we cannot allow our kids to inherit the next generation of this hamster wheel.

10:56.601 --> 11:01.980
The next iteration of social media will be even more malevolent and even more difficult.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.942
to usefully spread information on.

11:07.102 --> 11:31.516
I am still kind of optimistic that some of these decentralized, federalized sort of social media platforms like PeerTube and Soapbox and that can make a decentralized network that essentially allows people to build communities online that understand the same information the same way and interpret reality the same way so that they can act collectively.

11:32.605 --> 11:36.706
which is really what an internet should do if it was doing what it's supposed to be doing.

11:37.927 --> 11:39.907
Which would be good for almost everybody, right?

11:39.967 --> 11:48.650
That's the whole concept that it seems so easy, you know, just let it go, but they've never, ever, ever let it go.

11:50.070 --> 11:54.572
Otherwise, think about that for a second, run that simulation, where would we be by now?

11:57.318 --> 12:10.847
This is, this is remarkable because again, it's a, it's a hamster wheel and the people that usefully like really skillfully use social media and TV, they are stuck in this because now they're going to argue with that veterinarian.

12:10.887 --> 12:13.268
Now they're going to argue with this guy in the funny glasses.

12:14.929 --> 12:19.432
And as long as we argue with these people, then we're already playing by their rules.

12:19.492 --> 12:22.214
We're already using their terms and their definitions.

12:23.240 --> 12:30.707
And as long as we do that, then we will never really make any progress in teaching our children what this illusion is all about.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.771
Generally getting very sick from this.

12:35.331 --> 12:37.193
So what's the reason for all the alarm?

12:37.633 --> 12:41.557
Influenza is a particularly formidable virus.

12:41.877 --> 12:43.258
It is constantly changing.

12:44.329 --> 12:51.153
And the more that we allow it to evolve and adapt by infecting people, I mean, this is kind of Darwinian evolution here, right?

12:51.974 --> 13:00.499
It can change in ways that actually make it even more deadly or more easily transmissible or even resist against some of the antiviral medications that we have.

13:01.579 --> 13:04.941
Khan told us every new infection increases the odds.

13:05.002 --> 13:08.083
So that's already kind of the semantic enchantment.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.985
You could kind of hear it there where he was being very imprecise.

13:12.146 --> 13:13.687
And a lot of that imprecision

13:15.234 --> 13:40.601
in the new biology 101, it's going to be very obvious to you, that imprecision is taking some genetic concepts which have been, you know, established to a large extent in bacteria or in yeast, for example, and then generalizing those molecular mechanisms across all higher organisms, all higher hyper symbiotic pattern integrities.

13:41.809 --> 13:43.410
And that's a ridiculous notion.

13:43.590 --> 13:53.538
It's a very ridiculous notion because it doesn't respect that same component's presence in those pattern integrities, those higher ordered organisms.

13:54.278 --> 14:06.627
So this is going to be a long trek in terms of trying to establish an alternative way of talking about biology without using their terms, without being limited by their concepts.

14:06.687 --> 14:09.710
Because their concepts are often as simplistic

14:10.538 --> 14:22.754
as finding something that works in a dish with bacteria and assuming that that same concept is present and fundamental to understanding higher organisms like ourselves.

14:22.834 --> 14:28.761
And that is part of this bad biology that they think they can do because they found DNA.

14:29.955 --> 14:31.836
DNA means that evolution is real.

14:31.896 --> 14:35.038
And so all these assumptions are just, they're all there for them.

14:35.158 --> 14:36.299
They get to have all of them.

14:36.359 --> 14:39.841
And that is the basis for this bad biology.

14:39.881 --> 14:45.285
It's the basis for that cognitive trap that we've been in from that perspective since high school biology 101.

14:46.725 --> 14:55.911
And it relies, this whole narrative relies on you accepting that one fundamental omission, that we are a symbiosis.

14:55.991 --> 14:56.311
And that's,

14:57.845 --> 15:12.653
omitting that is what allows them to tell these tall tales about viruses which can, you know, develop resistance to antivirals is the equivalent to resistance to antibiotics.

15:13.133 --> 15:19.177
This whole concept is fundamentally rooted

15:20.549 --> 15:21.689
in this bad biology.

15:21.709 --> 15:29.713
And if you change that bad biology to a new model, then all of these other misleading concepts just kind of evaporate.

15:29.753 --> 15:39.436
That's what I think is so compelling about, about attempting to, to describe a new model of biology 101.

15:40.177 --> 15:44.158
Bird flu could lead to severe disease as we saw during COVID.

15:44.779 --> 15:45.739
In North America,

15:46.247 --> 15:49.610
Six people now have ended up in the hospital with bird flu.

15:50.091 --> 15:54.475
More worrying, five people had no known exposure to sick animals.

15:55.195 --> 15:57.718
One girl in Mexico died two weeks ago.

15:58.447 --> 16:05.209
We are really at risk of this virus evolving into one that has pandemic potential.

16:05.489 --> 16:10.311
And the reality is, none of us know whether this is next week or next year or never.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.432
I don't think it's never.

16:13.152 --> 16:15.973
But it may be here far sooner than any of us would like.

16:17.154 --> 16:20.795
Many scientists told us vaccines could be our best defense.

16:21.335 --> 16:26.757
There is a vaccine for bird flu, but it has not been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.

16:27.352 --> 16:31.996
Moderna has a new one, but the Trump administration has paused its final funding.

16:32.596 --> 16:34.658
There are vaccines for poultry, too.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.780
I'm pretty sure that's no longer the case.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.981
I'm pretty sure Moderna got its final funding.

16:39.001 --> 16:40.002
Correct me if I'm wrong.

16:40.863 --> 16:45.607
But they haven't been used because many of America's trading partners... I love the ones up at the top there.

16:45.627 --> 16:47.108
...do not import vaccinated birds.

16:47.748 --> 16:51.852
A glimmer of hope, the USDA's milk testing program.

16:52.072 --> 16:55.695
This is repurposed from COVID testing from three or four years ago.

16:56.548 --> 17:04.411
repurposed from COVID testing three or four years ago as he points to a $100,000 automated machine.

17:05.931 --> 17:07.372
Think about that for a minute.

17:08.332 --> 17:10.093
Think about that for a minute.

17:10.153 --> 17:18.956
There are companies in America with the sort of, how would you say it, technological infrastructure to just test

17:19.898 --> 17:26.664
And so they have the financial incentive to buy into any of this bullshit because they have the stuff.

17:26.864 --> 17:27.845
Well, you need cakes.

17:27.965 --> 17:28.826
I can bake cakes.

17:28.906 --> 17:29.626
I got the oven.

17:30.187 --> 17:33.710
I bought this really super fat oven, the best oven that money could buy.

17:33.750 --> 17:38.454
I got four of them for the pandemic because at the beginning of the pandemic, everybody needed cakes.

17:39.034 --> 17:41.056
But then everybody stopped needing cakes.

17:41.416 --> 17:44.279
But if you guys need cakes, oh man, that's perfect for me.

17:48.581 --> 17:58.326
Dr. Keith Paulson is director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Lab, part of the USDA's plan to test raw milk for H5N1.

17:58.386 --> 18:00.287
And of course it's in Wisconsin, right?

18:00.347 --> 18:08.310
I mean, anywhere where there's that many animals, there's gonna be a whole group of people ready to help out with this.

18:08.350 --> 18:14.473
I mean, they're gonna spread the word through their little networks about, you know how much money you can make in a dairy state in the coming years?

18:14.553 --> 18:15.454
Get busy, boys.

18:17.363 --> 18:21.924
Pasteurization kills the virus, but raw milk can be loaded with it.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.285
Is this where you would identify the virus?

18:25.485 --> 18:26.425
I said it.

18:26.485 --> 18:27.185
I just said it.

18:27.405 --> 18:29.866
One positive cow in a group of a thousand.

18:31.826 --> 18:42.488
Forty-five states are now doing some form of... Think about the exaggerated level of specificity and accuracy that that implies.

18:42.568 --> 18:45.769
That they can find one cow in a thousand

18:48.752 --> 18:51.374
And it won't be any false negatives.

18:51.394 --> 18:53.015
There won't be any false positives.

18:53.096 --> 18:58.440
It's just that one positive in a thousand because their test is that good.

19:01.743 --> 19:05.325
I mean, that is some remarkable level of salesmanship.

19:06.566 --> 19:10.890
Paulson told us it's helped to slow the spread of the virus in some states.

19:11.050 --> 19:11.891
That's a good point.

19:12.171 --> 19:14.413
Zardoz in the chat is saying PCR.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.534
They haven't said how they're testing yet.

19:16.574 --> 19:17.996
And I think that's by design.

19:18.837 --> 19:26.980
They don't want you to think about the particular methodology used, whether they're using lateral flow testing or blood testing or PCR.

19:27.180 --> 19:35.022
Obviously, they're using PCR because they are repurposing those PCR machines from COVID, but they didn't actually say it.

19:35.142 --> 19:37.043
They just kind of implied it, which is good.

19:38.720 --> 19:45.825
When you see the outbreak curve level off or start to decline, do you go like, phew, we dodged one?

19:46.286 --> 19:50.709
I don't think we go, phew, until we're deactivated, our lab.

19:50.849 --> 19:52.831
We're still in outbreak response mode.

19:53.071 --> 20:01.957
And while we may have fewer detections, we know that there are still viruses circulating based on all the data from the virologists that we're talking to.

20:02.358 --> 20:04.259
And we want to make sure that we catch it fast.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.222
The CDC is trying to ramp up its testing.

20:08.683 --> 20:15.767
But there's another... Are those CDC workers or are those guys just the milkers of that cows in that commercial farm?

20:15.807 --> 20:16.807
What the hell is this?

20:17.128 --> 20:17.528
...problem.

20:18.128 --> 20:23.391
Almost half of farm workers are undocumented and may be reluctant to be tested.

20:23.471 --> 20:35.658
With their N95 masks... If we're not testing people, if we're not looking for people who might get it, if we're not looking for evidence of an early cluster of human-to-human transmission, then we're going to miss it.

20:36.198 --> 20:38.239
Everybody knows who Rasmussen is, right?

20:40.516 --> 20:42.238
Everybody knows who this lady is.

20:42.318 --> 20:42.578
Wow.

20:42.638 --> 20:43.919
That's that's remarkable.

20:43.959 --> 21:05.858
Look at that that pin It's almost like it's almost like they're trying to tell you that yeah, it's people that are working with Canadians It's like a NATO operation and anybody that's been to Canada and America repeatedly Might be a problem They're like orchestrating this across borders and

21:08.410 --> 21:17.114
There's a Georgetown virologist that now works for some vaccine thing in Canada, and that's not unusual.

21:17.174 --> 21:25.238
This lady who was sure it's natural, it can't be a lab leak, and now she's on TV again?

21:25.738 --> 21:27.259
That's part of the hamster wheel.

21:28.314 --> 21:55.192
Hamster wheel of the scooby-doo the hamster wheel of the lab leak the hamster wheel of of censorship of fake people taking fake positions with extreme certainty and Here she is again taking an extreme position with extreme certainty about the high fidelity of her biology It's remarkable when you can see it clearly how hard they're going at it.

21:55.212 --> 21:56.973
This is this is a full-court press.

21:57.053 --> 21:57.894
This isn't a joke

21:58.971 --> 22:03.015
Dr. Angela Rasmussen is an American virologist working in Canada.

22:03.635 --> 22:11.203
Rasmussen told us it's not just the number of human cases that is alarming, but that the virus is jumping to more mammals.

22:11.763 --> 22:12.103
Llamas?

22:12.123 --> 22:18.770
Every new spillover gives the virus another chance to evolve and potentially spread person to person.

22:19.804 --> 22:31.250
So we are now seeing the viruses spread from birds to cattle and now to foxes, goats, pigs, rats, cats, raccoons.

22:31.490 --> 22:35.332
The fact that this virus can infect so many different types of mammals.

22:35.513 --> 22:37.994
Seven, seven.

22:39.995 --> 22:41.996
Plus it's, we're talking about birds, right?

22:42.196 --> 22:42.576
Seven.

22:42.596 --> 22:44.397
This is, this is,

22:48.783 --> 22:49.583
Can you see it yet?

22:49.663 --> 22:53.105
Can you see where the new Biology 101 fits in here perfectly?

22:53.925 --> 23:04.370
Because the story that they told us about coronavirus was that it had the highest specificity for ACE2 that they'd ever seen.

23:06.127 --> 23:23.977
And yet somehow or another, its extremely high specificity also led to it being found in zoo animals and in all the white-tailed deer in North America, even though it had the most high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor ever.

23:26.058 --> 23:29.040
And yet here now, we have a story of the flu.

23:30.498 --> 23:51.494
infecting all kinds of species with no discussion whatsoever about what receptor mechanism might underlie this phenomenon that heretofore was only attributed to a lab generated virus with a specificity so high it had never been seen on earth before.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.793
And yet now that phenomenon is relatively normal.

23:55.833 --> 23:58.354
That's what we expect from all these viruses.

23:58.894 --> 24:00.795
And we're just finding it everywhere.

24:00.915 --> 24:02.776
Think about that for a second.

24:04.237 --> 24:17.564
For almost two and a half years, we were told that COVID had all kinds of attributes that had never been seen before and was like a lottery being won because it was jackpot after jackpot after jackpot.

24:19.099 --> 24:25.986
Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, something like that.

24:26.986 --> 24:41.000
Like the HIV inserts, the furin cleavage site, the specially spaced restriction enzymes that make it obviously manufactured, all of these hints

24:43.658 --> 24:51.062
And in the first two years, it was ACE-2, ACE-2, ACE-2, ACE-2, ACE-2 inhibitors, Bradykinin.

24:51.483 --> 24:53.504
It was all about this ACE-2.

24:56.486 --> 25:00.708
And for now, we don't have to talk about the mechanism of receptors at all.

25:00.748 --> 25:02.829
It's just in all these, it's just crazy.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.030
It's in all these animals.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.592
And we, you know, cause flu can do that, I guess.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.801
is a huge concern in terms of its ability to infect people.

25:12.101 --> 25:22.785
One of your colleagues told us that if this should spiral into a pandemic, this flu could make COVID look like a walk in the park.

25:23.025 --> 25:23.405
I agree.

25:24.846 --> 25:25.446
You're scaring me.

25:26.246 --> 25:27.607
I'm scared about it myself.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.688
I don't sleep very much these days, Bill.

25:29.948 --> 25:31.909
I'm scared of it myself.

25:32.169 --> 25:34.810
I don't sleep much these days, Bill.

25:37.634 --> 25:38.394
Stop lying!

25:42.996 --> 25:44.736
I'm scared of it myself, Bill.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.637
I don't sleep much these days, she says.

25:51.498 --> 25:57.680
Rasmussen was among the scientists given expert briefings by the Biden administration in 2024.

25:58.321 --> 26:02.342
She told us Biden's team miscalculated the threat at first.

26:02.922 --> 26:05.523
It was some gambling and some wishful thinking.

26:06.087 --> 26:08.491
thinking this isn't actually going to be that big of a deal.

26:09.112 --> 26:10.834
And it turns out it was a very big deal.

26:11.555 --> 26:20.409
It's an interesting set of circumstances, right, where the COVID pandemic kind of just starts in Trump's little

26:21.604 --> 26:23.186
while Trump is on the way out.

26:23.226 --> 26:30.272
And then for four years, we just have, you know, total control over the narrative and whatever we want to say, we can do whatever we want and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

26:30.732 --> 26:39.540
And then Trump comes in office again, and now we're going to start another narrative just like this, where, you know, it looks like they predicted it right.

26:39.881 --> 26:43.004
We saw it, we said it, here it comes, and it's the same people.

26:44.141 --> 26:45.362
Which is strange, right?

26:45.402 --> 26:51.004
Because now they have this guy in the White House and they can say that he ignored it and they can say that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.785
defunded or fired these people.

26:53.426 --> 27:04.011
And so the whole kind of incompetence narrative is set up again, but it's now set up on a pretty left-right sort of controlled demolition of America style.

27:04.491 --> 27:05.212
Holy shit.

27:06.012 --> 27:13.656
Now we're really set for an implosion because with Trump the first time, it was Fauci.

27:15.612 --> 27:17.053
And it was Francis Collins.

27:18.693 --> 27:20.274
And it was Rochelle Walensky.

27:20.434 --> 27:29.778
And it was, you know, all these people that had trained under Fauci for years and worked on HIV for years before they participated in this narrative.

27:29.838 --> 27:32.599
These are people who already understood.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.162
But now we're in a different situation.

27:38.262 --> 27:43.144
Now, it seems like we're in a situation where it's going to be easy to blame the whole executive branch.

27:45.270 --> 27:49.214
where it's going to be very easy to sort of take it down to the studs, if you will.

27:52.457 --> 27:55.920
And, and I think that that's what we should be aware of.

27:56.120 --> 28:08.252
That's what we should be afraid of here, because this same narrative executed now with Jay Bhattacharya at the head of the NIH with, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:08.352 --> 28:09.113
at the head of HHS.

28:13.755 --> 28:16.777
What happens when he declares a bird flu pandemic?

28:20.819 --> 28:22.980
Because remember, he's part of the executive branch.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.121
He's not an independently elected brain here.

28:27.082 --> 28:31.344
We're talking about somebody who essentially has to do what he's told or he can be replaced.

28:34.866 --> 28:35.466
Like it or not.

28:36.772 --> 28:44.277
That's independent of the other accusations and other speculations that I've made about the people behind him.

28:45.779 --> 28:49.600
the Trump administration gotten its arms around this problem?

28:49.880 --> 28:51.901
No, I would say is the short answer.

28:52.581 --> 28:59.644
But the other, the longer answer is that I don't actually entirely know what is what is going on.

28:59.724 --> 29:00.284
Why is that?

29:00.804 --> 29:07.186
Many of the people who are working on this, at least at CDC, have have been fired from the federal government.

29:07.766 --> 29:10.947
So the influenza division at CDC has been decimated.

29:11.087 --> 29:13.048
And in fact, there is a communications ban

29:13.588 --> 29:15.851
that has been put on these federal workers.

29:16.091 --> 29:16.932
What do you think of that?

29:17.813 --> 29:25.460
I think it's insane, actually, that I have to have conversations on encrypted messaging apps with my colleagues who I would normally just send emails to.

29:26.381 --> 29:28.063
Hundreds of federal scientists.

29:28.363 --> 29:32.767
I don't know why that last part has anything to do with the first part.

29:32.908 --> 29:37.112
If all these people got fired, then why do you need to send encrypted messages to them?

29:39.356 --> 29:46.459
What does that have any, that's such a weird story to tell and put on 60 minutes on, that's an edited interview.

29:47.239 --> 29:49.040
So they selected that soundbite.

29:55.462 --> 30:04.105
Just like they selected to show you George Webb in February of 2020, talking about some Dutch lady and the Wuhan military games.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.386
It was, none of this is by accident.

30:09.051 --> 30:12.213
...and health workers who track bird flu have been laid off.

30:12.774 --> 30:14.315
Some may be rehired.

30:14.775 --> 30:22.480
The CDC declined to answer our questions, saying it continues to respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak.

30:22.980 --> 30:31.066
Colorado vet Kay Russo and others told us... They edited it out there or talked over it, but she said worst case scenario again there, which is pretty funny.

30:31.666 --> 30:32.907
...they feel stymied.

30:33.510 --> 30:40.271
The current distrust of science and vaccines is hurting their fight to try to prevent the next pandemic.

30:40.852 --> 30:45.893
I would scorch the earth if this ends up in children deaths.

30:46.733 --> 31:01.976
And so as a mother, as a veterinarian, as a scientist, I'm just asking you trust us because I will do everything in my power and there's plenty of folks behind me that will do the same to keep this from getting to that point.

31:02.432 --> 31:06.433
So if kids die of bird flu, she's gonna burn the whole earth.

31:07.974 --> 31:16.657
I don't really get that statement at all, other than, again, we're talking about somebody auditioning.

31:17.998 --> 31:24.200
Auditioning to be a more prominent player in the theater by which we are governed.

31:25.911 --> 31:33.876
Most of these people do not understand the difference between what they are doing and just trying to succeed career-wise, and that's the sad part.

31:34.797 --> 31:45.984
We have so many people that are still absolutely trapped in mainstream media narratives, in mainstream media reality, or in social media reality.

31:47.325 --> 31:55.130
And the most dangerous adults are trapped in social media reality, where they think that mainstream media is incapable of carrying the truth.

31:59.625 --> 32:06.189
And the truth has something to do with aliens and warp speed and what's underneath the pyramids.

32:11.273 --> 32:15.456
This is the most malevolent sort of warfare.

32:16.590 --> 32:39.920
It's the most malevolent sort of governance where mythologies and actors and scripts are used on television to create the illusion of consensus about a phenomenon, about a social, a socioeconomic phenomenon, a biological phenomenon, even a multi-generational phenomenon.

32:42.847 --> 33:04.034
That is how we are governed, until we start to be able to actively question everything that comes into our ears, instead of hanging on for dear life as the information goes past us, or even worse, passively sitting there with no muscle tone at all as the information just kind of washes over us.

33:07.881 --> 33:11.863
The bottom line is that if you're not acting, someone else is.

33:12.383 --> 33:15.044
If you're not thinking, someone else is doing it for you.

33:16.025 --> 33:28.970
And in the case of 60 Minutes, unless you're actively seeking the mythology and trying to understand the mythology that is being projected here, then you're already just in a hamster wheel.

33:28.990 --> 33:29.871
There's no truth here.

33:31.032 --> 33:35.957
There's nothing to be sieved and then you have the golden nugget of truth.

33:36.137 --> 33:41.823
There's nothing other than they need your children to believe this.

33:42.584 --> 33:44.946
They need us to teach our children this.

33:45.206 --> 33:45.907
That's what they need.

33:51.331 --> 33:55.435
So if you would like to be notified of the stream, please send an email to that email right there.

33:55.455 --> 34:05.324
If you're going to share this afterward, please share stream.gigaom.bio where you should be able to also download it and post it wherever you want to make clips, however you want to, please do so.

34:05.424 --> 34:08.267
If you can find a way to make your family, uh,

34:11.175 --> 34:22.421
more safe and secure and raise money for your family by taking cuts from these videos and putting them on your own YouTube channel and collecting whatever revenue you get from it, please do.

34:23.321 --> 34:34.047
If you think you can turn my work into better written materials and raise money that will help your family get into the future and spread this to other families, then please do.

34:35.067 --> 34:35.948
I don't want any

34:36.930 --> 34:42.753
Your money that you earn through your hard work using these ideas because these ideas are not mine.

34:42.793 --> 34:52.238
These are ideas are conglomeration and a remix at best and so I humbly Thank you very much for being here.

34:52.278 --> 35:04.005
And if you can and want to support this work, please go to gigoloandbiological.com And find a way to do so we only make make it because of those people Thank you very much

35:08.790 --> 35:08.950
you

35:23.817 --> 35:24.257
The end.

35:44.983 --> 35:45.063
so

36:12.321 --> 36:13.882
And good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

36:13.922 --> 36:14.522
Welcome to the show.

36:14.562 --> 36:16.544
This is Gingo on Biological, a new biology 101.

36:17.144 --> 36:20.146
Life is a pattern, integrity with a trajectory across time.

36:21.167 --> 36:23.368
The voice that you're hearing is Jonathan Cooey.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.670
I am the chief biologist of Gingo on Biological.

36:25.690 --> 36:30.674
I am coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania out of the back of my garage, even though it seems like I'm doing magic.

36:31.334 --> 36:33.274
I'm just really badass at what I do.

36:33.294 --> 36:40.516
Yeah, the stain of my previous work can be found on PubMed, but also throughout the internet.

36:40.836 --> 36:44.277
Unfortunately, Panda lost all of my presentations from a few years ago.

36:45.717 --> 36:51.119
But I am really well represented, actually, in the work of Woodhouse76 on Substack.

36:51.659 --> 36:56.900
Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler regularly take my ideas and water them down and then

36:57.620 --> 37:01.042
tend to argue with people like Claire Craig or Pierre Corey.

37:01.082 --> 37:21.352
But in reality, all of these ideas that these clowns are parroting are actually just stuff taken from my work or from Mark's work or from other people, because these are really, these are part of the team of people behind Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the whole Skyhorse publishing nonsense.

37:22.232 --> 37:25.634
They're also behind Jay Bhattacharya's placement at NIH.

37:26.734 --> 37:29.595
I guess that's about all I can really tell you.

37:30.135 --> 37:34.376
It is a bunch of people that don't have our best interests in mind.

37:35.117 --> 37:38.458
They are auditioning to be part of the governance structure.

37:39.378 --> 37:40.718
This is Gigoland Biological.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.019
It is a journal club today on the 28th of April, 2025.

37:43.599 --> 37:44.799
Biology is the way.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.701
And so I think it's always very important to test our biology to make sure that we know what we're talking about.

37:49.741 --> 37:52.642
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the children of earth.

37:53.782 --> 37:54.882
It's for all the marbles.

37:55.122 --> 37:55.583
Good morning.

37:55.623 --> 37:56.003
Good morning.

37:56.043 --> 37:56.563
Hello.

37:56.783 --> 37:57.523
How are you?

37:59.043 --> 38:16.088
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America And so I don't want to make too much of a big deal about that But I do think it's really important to start there And make sure that everybody has a clear idea of what I'm trying to suggest I think that there is a fake anti-vax in movement in America and

38:16.468 --> 38:17.909
and it's been around for many years.

38:17.969 --> 38:45.411
I think it has its roots in the fake anti-vax movement in the UK around the MMR vaccine and centered around a man by the name of Andrew Wakefield, who coincidentally came to the United States, became rich, recycling this, I would say, sort of political and social capital to manipulate the health freedom movement in America and essentially cut its legs out.

38:46.913 --> 38:51.577
with the intention of using it as a way of propelling someone like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:51.657 --> 38:52.398
into the White House.

38:53.438 --> 38:56.721
I think they've come short or fell short of that goal.

38:57.862 --> 39:00.144
But, you know, it's where we are.

39:00.444 --> 39:08.852
And when you're engaged in such a long con, then you got to stick to your story, even when you don't quite get where you want to be.

39:09.773 --> 39:12.436
Because it's required loyalty to get this far.

39:14.218 --> 39:15.359
And so you've got to stick to it.

39:15.459 --> 39:16.581
And I think that's where we are.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.803
I think it's unfortunate, but that's where we are.

39:19.184 --> 39:27.053
My experience tells me that these people are part of this concerted effort to hide this magnificent background.

39:28.274 --> 39:45.597
on which that PCR is supposedly working to give us a very high fidelity read on all the variants of bird flu and all the places that it can be found, as well as previously the wonderful phylogeny of the COVID virus as it evolved over the last five years.

39:45.638 --> 39:52.799
This is all based on this nonsense, bad biology 101, where evolution because DNA, that's about the best way to summarize it.

39:53.659 --> 39:59.804
They found DNA and therefore Darwin was right and all the implications of it are that, you know, it's a species thing.

39:59.824 --> 40:01.505
You should be concerned about the species.

40:01.565 --> 40:05.128
We should, you know, take control of the evolution of the species.

40:05.208 --> 40:12.033
Anybody that's smart enough to understand this realizes there's a moral imperative to take control of the evolution of the species.

40:12.093 --> 40:20.679
And that is essentially how these people think and how they make the equations on the board, which essentially cancel out God on both sides of the equation.

40:23.533 --> 40:34.541
And so the way that I am trying to break people open on this idea is to make sure that people understand that what happened during the pandemic can be summarized as murder and lies.

40:34.621 --> 40:36.462
That's unfortunate, but it's really true.

40:36.562 --> 40:49.151
Not everybody understands, maybe it's manslaughter, but an anticipated rise in expected deaths, an anticipated rise that could be seen in the population pyramid of all the countries of the West,

40:50.080 --> 41:15.685
This anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was misconstrued as evidence of an RNA pandemic using murder and lies, sophisticated lies like the PCR test, sophisticated lies like whole genome sequencing of the virus, sophisticated lies like using supplementary oxygen in place of ventilators that we were running out of, that Elon Musk was gonna convert his factory to making.

41:17.369 --> 41:21.010
These are the kinds of myths that have never been debunked.

41:21.170 --> 41:33.115
And instead, they've moved right on as quickly as possible to the talking specifically about COVID shots and whether the shots were contaminated or not, or whether they, you know, that, that, that

41:34.130 --> 41:38.394
completely ran the clock out on this fundamental part of the narrative.

41:38.454 --> 41:51.966
And unfortunately, this phenomenon even, the idea that there was a population pyramid that could have predicted the rise in all-cause mortality, that just not using antibiotics for pneumonia

41:52.546 --> 42:04.537
could cause a significant rise in all-cause mortality in hospitals if you just told people that antibiotics are inappropriate for the novel virus and that the novel virus doesn't even need to be tested for.

42:04.577 --> 42:05.017
It's tough.

42:05.678 --> 42:07.760
We can't do it because the FDA won't let us.

42:09.682 --> 42:19.089
No one else in this narrative besides Mark Kulak has tried to assemble a list of explanations which rules out a novel virus very successfully.

42:19.689 --> 42:20.149
Only us.

42:20.890 --> 42:31.137
Everybody else is convinced that this equation requires a mystery virus that killed millions of people and that probably came from a gain-of-function laboratory and likely could come again.

42:32.796 --> 42:37.622
And that is how you can understand that you haven't actually been freed by any of these people.

42:37.662 --> 42:44.531
You have been permanently imprisoned in this mystery-solving exercise that you have acquiesced to accepting.

42:46.254 --> 42:50.059
It's all fraud, it's all lies, and it's primarily murder.

42:54.395 --> 42:56.857
Now, you can summarize it in a lot of ways.

42:56.877 --> 42:58.578
You can have that long list over there.

42:58.658 --> 43:02.580
You can just say that number one, not using antibiotics for pneumonia is a crime.

43:02.620 --> 43:17.690
And so anybody that can look back on the COVID pandemic and see that one of their relatives was treated like that, or that your head of your department told you that you had to treat people like that, can look back and say, wait a minute, maybe he's right.

43:19.079 --> 43:28.323
Maybe those CDC protocols made me essentially murder people or injure them in a way that could be misconstrued as COVID.

43:29.524 --> 43:33.125
And of course, we all know the story that most of the COVID was spreading in hospitals.

43:33.165 --> 43:48.432
It wasn't spreading in hospitals or being generated by the inappropriate treatment of people in hospitals that included primarily the acceptance of a viral syndrome for which antibiotics were inappropriate.

43:50.839 --> 43:56.382
So then couple that with the opioid crisis being allowed to let go free, wild.

43:58.163 --> 44:02.846
Couple that with do not resuscitate orders in specific places during specific times.

44:03.727 --> 44:04.888
Maybe some suicides.

44:05.648 --> 44:08.450
But I think these two are more than enough, especially this one.

44:09.330 --> 44:13.113
The leading cause of death for people under 40.

44:14.517 --> 44:17.741
That's gonna be a problem with regard to lowering life expectancy.

44:17.781 --> 44:19.543
Now, why do we keep hammering on that?

44:20.063 --> 44:26.971
Because there are two numbers that everybody keeps accepting when they accept the pandemic narrative.

44:27.011 --> 44:31.316
The numbers, one, is that there are some number of people who died of COVID.

44:32.745 --> 44:47.852
And number two is that some of those people were not old people, and that's why the life expectancy in America has plummeted for the first time significantly since the 1918 pandemic flu.

44:49.092 --> 44:52.174
There are lots of people, including Vincent Rackaniello,

44:53.394 --> 45:06.224
And Tony Fauci, who would argue exactly that, and Pierre Kory would argue exactly that, that if it's not COVID, it is the COVID shots which have caused this lowered life expectancy.

45:06.344 --> 45:09.407
And that is an absolute lie.

45:09.447 --> 45:10.408
The math is there.

45:10.568 --> 45:15.692
Anybody that wanted to investigate could find that there is a significant number of Americans

45:16.132 --> 45:29.493
included in this opioid epidemic that have died way earlier than they should have and by definition that has shifted that number in a way that this novel virus doesn't necessarily need to have done.

45:30.250 --> 45:34.093
But all of these people are certain that it did.

45:34.553 --> 45:45.800
And when I say all of these people, I mean Tony Fauci and Mary Holland and Peter Daszak and Robert Malone and Francis Collins and Kevin McKernan.

45:45.820 --> 45:52.044
They're all certain that there was a novel virus that could be sequenced, that was followed, that evolved, that killed people.

45:52.465 --> 45:53.906
It was a strange disease.

45:54.446 --> 45:57.628
And now there's a spike protein in people because we transfected them.

45:57.708 --> 45:58.969
I mean, gave them a vaccine.

46:02.031 --> 46:20.945
And so death certificates could definitely be faked for money because it was worth a lot of money and because hospitals are managed by corporations for the profit margin, and PCR was not a useful diagnostic tool, but because of the pandemic, the magic trick of the pandemic, we have PCR in all of our hospitals doing all kinds of work now.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.948
And that's not by accident.

46:25.288 --> 46:26.309
That is by script.

46:26.669 --> 46:27.630
That is by plan.

46:29.878 --> 46:38.952
And a lot of people, including myself, got sucked into those first couple years of arguing about a lab leak and effectively not realizing that PCR was where we should have been fighting.

46:40.236 --> 46:42.958
where the fake death certificates are where we should have been fighting.

46:42.978 --> 46:46.561
The opioid epidemic is where we should have been fighting.

46:46.982 --> 46:51.125
The pure oxygen and ventilation causing ARDS is what we should have been talking about.

46:51.145 --> 46:59.712
There's 10 years, 20 years of literature in the primary literature and even in textbooks about critical care where this is talked about at length.

47:01.694 --> 47:06.518
And yet everybody missed it for somehow because we were talking about ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.

47:10.020 --> 47:11.141
instead of antibiotics.

47:15.645 --> 47:18.507
And so mandates are slave speak.

47:18.567 --> 47:23.752
If you're arguing about mandates being bad, then you're speaking slave speak.

47:25.754 --> 47:27.015
Vaccines are a mythology.

47:28.396 --> 47:29.677
Autism is a mythology.

47:30.658 --> 47:33.861
Gain of function is a mythology and AI is a mythology.

47:34.926 --> 47:37.227
How much clearer can I be here?

47:37.508 --> 47:38.908
Let's try to be a little clearer.

47:39.449 --> 47:41.850
Making poisoning kids is a choice?

47:41.930 --> 47:42.891
That's silly.

47:44.051 --> 47:47.093
So talking about mandates is actually slave speak.

47:48.934 --> 47:50.916
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

47:51.738 --> 47:53.540
That's why vaccines are a mythology.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.220
It's just dumb.

47:55.041 --> 48:01.426
So autism is a mythology that complicates intramuscular injection being dumb.

48:01.606 --> 48:08.111
If intramuscular injection is dumb, we don't need a thousand explanations for autism.

48:08.131 --> 48:14.276
We don't need to come up with the environmental and genetic causes of autism if intramuscular injection is dumb.

48:15.097 --> 48:21.058
So I hope I'm being very clear, trying to be simple, autism complicates intramuscular injection is dumb.

48:21.458 --> 48:23.559
And intramuscular injection is definitely dumb.

48:25.759 --> 48:28.940
But you know, I'm open to the possibility that it's not.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.881
The title of this program is The Importance of Injecting Vaccines into Muscle.

48:32.941 --> 48:43.703
It would be crazy if there was actually an article in the British Medical Journal titled The Importance of Injecting Vaccines into Muscle, because if there's that

48:44.568 --> 49:14.123
article and I have been saying intramuscular injection is dumb than any of these people could have corrected me at any time they wanted to by just pulling this article up and reading it and saying how crazy it is that, you know, the guy who used to work for CHD and before that used to work for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine is saying something is so crazy as intramuscular injection is dumb when the importance of injecting vaccines into muscle is the title of an article.

49:18.171 --> 49:20.372
The language is the enchantment, ladies and gentlemen.

49:20.413 --> 49:25.336
Virology is just applications using synthetic DNA, so gain-of-function is just a mythology.

49:26.216 --> 49:27.637
And language is the enchantment.

49:27.677 --> 49:29.479
How they talk about it is the enchantment.

49:29.499 --> 49:32.621
You argue with them using their terms, and you lose.

49:32.901 --> 49:34.342
More importantly, your kids lose.

49:37.116 --> 49:38.897
So let's have a little journal club here.

49:38.957 --> 49:40.538
This is the title of the paper.

49:40.859 --> 49:47.984
Remember, I just want to make sure you see the overarching idea here is intramuscular injection is dumb and autism complicates that.

49:48.664 --> 49:53.668
It makes something very complicated out of something very, very simple.

49:54.889 --> 50:06.717
We don't need a book like James Lyons Wyler's New York Times bestseller, Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism, if intramuscular injection is just plain dumb.

50:09.264 --> 50:16.909
So let's read this article and see if it's convincing about why intramuscular injection is important for vaccines.

50:16.969 --> 50:21.491
And the subtitle is different patients need different size needles.

50:23.773 --> 50:25.374
It sounds almost, yeah.

50:25.794 --> 50:26.054
Wow.

50:26.074 --> 50:26.294
Okay.

50:26.374 --> 50:26.975
Anyway, here we go.

50:26.995 --> 50:28.676
I'm just going to read this because I think it's fun.

50:30.276 --> 50:37.347
Most vaccines should be given via intramuscular route into the deltoid or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.

50:38.048 --> 50:45.440
This optimizes immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimizes adverse reactions at the injection site.

50:46.641 --> 50:51.145
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of administering vaccines correctly.

50:51.806 --> 51:05.458
And so I'm sure that the bibliography of this paper is just a magnificent collection of articles that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt the unbelievable convenience biologically

51:06.491 --> 51:07.753
of intramuscular injection.

51:07.773 --> 51:18.091
I mean, it's just so awesome that now that we have hypodermic needles, we can take advantage of intramuscular injection because it's so freaking cool.

51:19.444 --> 51:27.605
This optimizes the immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimizes the reactions at the injection site.

51:27.645 --> 51:30.786
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of administering vaccines correctly.

51:31.406 --> 51:43.268
Clinical practice needs to reflect considerations about the right length and gauge of needles used to ensure that those vaccinated get the immunological benefits of the vaccine without local side effects.

51:43.968 --> 51:47.049
Now, local side effects are an interesting thing.

51:47.089 --> 51:47.969
So essentially,

51:48.709 --> 51:52.772
The only thing this paper is worried about are local side effects.

51:52.792 --> 51:54.493
We're not talking about autism.

51:54.734 --> 51:55.594
I mean, that's crazy.

51:56.415 --> 51:58.116
We're just talking about local side effects.

51:58.156 --> 51:59.918
I wonder what those local side effects are.

52:00.358 --> 52:11.586
Injecting a vaccine into the layer of subcutaneous fat where poor vascularity may result in slow mobilization and processing of antigen, it is a cause of vaccine failure.

52:12.707 --> 52:16.170
For example, in hepatitis B, rabies, and influenza vaccines.

52:17.028 --> 52:31.534
Compared with intramuscular administration, subcutaneous injection of hepatitis B vaccine leads to a significantly lower seroconversion rates and more rapidly decaying, sorry, and more rapid decay of antibody response.

52:31.554 --> 52:33.355
So first and foremost, here we have it.

52:34.015 --> 52:45.120
If you accept their model of seroconversion, you accept their model of antibodies as a sign of immunity, then you are accepting their testing methods,

52:46.052 --> 52:48.154
You are accepting their methodologies.

52:49.115 --> 52:59.423
You are accepting this concept that antibodies present can be a specific signal for a specific experience.

53:00.865 --> 53:07.090
Imagine that, that they would say that we can test your brain for antibodies that are specific for a memory that you just had.

53:07.550 --> 53:12.815
We can tell if you played poker this week or not because it will leave antibodies in your brain and we can test for them.

53:15.871 --> 53:23.256
It's a very similar claim that we can test your blood for a sign that you have been exposed.

53:25.578 --> 53:28.620
And you accept all of that in one go if you read this paper.

53:28.660 --> 53:33.823
It just leads to significantly lower seroconversion is the enchantment.

53:34.724 --> 53:39.547
If you understand what seroconversion means and don't question it, you're done.

53:42.318 --> 53:51.381
Traditionally, the buttocks were thought to be an appropriate site for vaccination, but the layers of fat do not contain the appropriate cells that are necessary to initiate the immune response.

53:51.982 --> 53:54.222
Phagocytic are antigen-presenting cells.

53:54.643 --> 54:09.048
It's interesting, right, that you would put fat in places maybe not just to store it, but also maybe to protect things or, you know, to make it, you know, you're more robust, less, you know, small punctures and abrasions will be even less of a problem then, right, or something.

54:09.088 --> 54:09.748
I don't know.

54:09.768 --> 54:10.809
That doesn't make any sense.

54:14.669 --> 54:27.319
The antigen may also take longer to reach the circulation after being deposited in fat, leading to a delay in processing by macrophages and eventually presentation to the T and B cells that are involved in the immune response.

54:27.339 --> 54:34.544
So there's a very poor representation of the immune response, as though the presentation happens to both T and B cells.

54:34.604 --> 54:35.225
That's, of course,

54:36.705 --> 54:43.048
In addition, antigens may be denatured by enzymes if they remain in fat for hours or days.

54:43.548 --> 54:53.052
Are you telling me that Brandy Vaughn was right and we have many ways at our barriers of processing toxins and getting rid of them before they actually get into the blood?

54:53.472 --> 54:54.813
That would be nuts, wouldn't it?

54:55.353 --> 55:05.121
Wow, okay, so the importance of these factors is supported by the findings that thicker skin folds are associated with a lowered antibody response to vaccines.

55:05.261 --> 55:06.142
Wow, curious.

55:07.003 --> 55:12.487
Some severe, sorry, serious reactions to intramuscular injections are rare.

55:13.450 --> 55:25.675
In one series of 26,294 adults, of whom 46 had received at least one intramuscular injection, only 48 had local adverse effects.

55:27.896 --> 55:32.397
However, subcutaneous injections can cause abscesses and granulomas.

55:32.457 --> 55:33.358
I think that's cancer.

55:34.558 --> 55:34.958
Hmm.

55:36.159 --> 55:39.180
So if something can be injected subcutaneously,

55:40.700 --> 55:45.403
and cause abscesses or granulomas, but in the muscle that's, it doesn't happen.

55:45.443 --> 55:45.963
It's interesting.

55:46.424 --> 55:52.447
Muscle has probably spared the harmful effects of substances injected into it because of its abundant blood supply.

55:52.987 --> 55:55.429
Oh, abundant blood supply.

55:56.350 --> 55:57.770
So it needs to get into the blood.

55:58.351 --> 56:03.594
You don't want it to sit somewhere and stay at the local injection site.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.916
You want it to get into the blood, huh?

56:08.252 --> 56:19.395
I thought that the whole point was to make it stay there and that one of the reasons why you had to aspirate is because you didn't want to get it into the blood too fast or something.

56:19.975 --> 56:20.715
Anyway, okay.

56:22.175 --> 56:30.877
Adipose tissue having a much poorer drainage channels retains injected material for much longer and therefore also susceptible to its adverse effects.

56:31.217 --> 56:34.358
In the cases of vaccine in which antigens are absorbed to

56:35.658 --> 56:46.022
Antigen is adsorbed to an aluminum salt adjuvant, such as those for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines.

56:46.042 --> 56:46.902
That's a lot of aluminum.

56:47.423 --> 56:58.627
The intramuscular route is strongly preferred because superficial administration leads to an increased incidence in local reactions, such as irritation, inflammation, granuloma formation, and necrosis.

56:59.707 --> 56:59.967
Huh.

57:01.128 --> 57:03.709
But necrosis doesn't happen in the muscle because it leaks out

57:04.565 --> 57:06.566
It gets out fast enough, it gets in the blood quick.

57:07.166 --> 57:07.606
That's cool.

57:08.627 --> 57:09.067
Interesting.

57:09.747 --> 57:14.849
So injection technique and needle size both determine how deep a substance is injected.

57:15.089 --> 57:15.629
Interesting.

57:15.649 --> 57:16.430
Okay.

57:16.950 --> 57:23.673
So again, we're getting kind of into a gray area here because I thought John Campbell and, and, and Mark Giraudeau had figured it all out.

57:23.713 --> 57:27.474
That it was really just the bolus theory and, and all you have to do is aspirate.

57:27.514 --> 57:31.956
And then most of these, if not all of these adverse reactions would simply go away.

57:34.699 --> 57:45.287
So let's see, injection technique involves stretching the skin flat before inserting the needle or pinching a fold of skin before injection, which may necessitate the use of longer needles.

57:46.788 --> 57:50.731
So you have to know how thick their skin is and how much fat they have before you can hit their muscle?

57:51.581 --> 57:52.382
God, go figure.

57:52.562 --> 57:56.425
I wonder how many people were doing that during the, yeah, okay, anyway.

57:57.526 --> 57:58.887
Is it different in kids?

57:59.267 --> 58:03.431
How thick is the kid's muscle in its skin and different kids and stuff?

58:03.731 --> 58:05.893
I wonder, huh, that's weird.

58:06.253 --> 58:17.823
To make sure the needle reaches the muscle and that the vaccine does not seep into subcutaneous tissue, the decision on size of needle and injection site should be made individually for each person.

58:18.985 --> 58:20.185
Hey, come over here, little kid.

58:20.225 --> 58:27.188
I want to pinch you, measure your skin thickness before I select from this whole range of needles here I have in this drawer.

58:31.850 --> 58:38.492
Imagine making such a big deal out of the size of the needle if intramuscular injection is just dumb.

58:39.352 --> 58:40.613
Just think about this.

58:42.062 --> 58:48.925
In a recent, sorry, it should be based on the person's age, the volume of material to be administered, and the size of the muscle.

58:49.745 --> 58:57.829
In a recent study, the thickness of the fat pad above the deltoid muscle of the upper arm was measured in 220 adults using high frequency ultrasonography.

58:58.489 --> 59:04.712
A wide variation exists in the thickness of the deltoid fat pad with women having significantly more subcutaneous fat than men.

59:05.332 --> 59:06.233
No way!

59:07.585 --> 59:21.516
A standard 5 eighth inch needle would not have achieved sufficient penetration for true deltoid intramuscular injection in 17% of men and nearly 50% of women in the study population.

59:21.576 --> 59:25.980
For men weighing 59, maybe safer to use a one inch needle.

59:26.380 --> 59:30.063
And for women over 90 kilograms, you might need a one and a half inch needle.

59:30.544 --> 59:33.026
Oh, you're a pretty fat lady.

59:33.386 --> 59:34.987
We got a special one for you.

59:36.670 --> 59:42.275
Health care professionals may hesitate to use longer needles on the ground that they are likely to cause the patient more discomfort.

59:42.315 --> 59:49.141
However, skeletal muscle has a poor supply of pain fibers compared with skin and subcutaneous tissue, which you still have to go through.

59:50.182 --> 59:52.224
Consideration should be given to needle gauge.

59:52.284 --> 59:52.825
That's this.

59:53.846 --> 59:57.749
A wide bore needle ensures the vaccine is dissipated over a wider area.

01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:06.694
Reducing the risk of localized, ooh, I don't know that that's, how is that the case?

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:08.875
That's weird.

01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:13.358
A standard size needle will not guarantee successful intramuscular injection in all people.

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:27.406
When intramuscular injection vaccine administration is needed to ensure optimal immunogenicity and minimize local reactions, a selected of non-fixed needles, pre-filled syringes may have provided with a fixed needle on the barrel.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:38.769
See, so he's arguing against the vaccine technologies, the fill and finish vaccine technologies that Robert Malone has been brokering for a couple decades now.

01:00:39.189 --> 01:00:41.110
Maybe that's the problem.

01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:46.835
Should be able to allow healthcare professionals to select the length and gauge of needle appropriate to each patient.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:50.198
What an interesting idea here we're at.

01:00:52.452 --> 01:00:56.635
So just to summarize, I think that RNA cannot pandemic and they won't argue with that.

01:00:57.516 --> 01:01:03.560
In fact, now that we've established it, Sukrit Bhakti says that we shouldn't talk about it anymore, which I kind of find funny.

01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:06.202
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:12.126
I think that's also something that they won't challenge because the best challenge that they have is what we just read.

01:01:14.013 --> 01:01:18.557
And yes, it was a transfection and transformation in the population pyramids, but let me just explain it.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.339
Okay, let me just explain it frame by frame it.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:28.186
I get kind of tired, you know, sometimes I think I'm leading horses to water and they don't drink.

01:01:29.347 --> 01:01:32.589
But I'm gonna keep working because I think it's worth it.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.292
If nothing else, it helps me work out some of these ideas.

01:01:36.676 --> 01:01:43.659
So I've drawn this picture before with the intention of trying to illustrate how bad intramuscular injection is as an idea.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.061
And biologically, I think it's extremely bad.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:53.124
But one of the interesting things about this diagram, and this diagram is composed essentially of a tube.

01:01:54.325 --> 01:02:00.948
It is a tube that is you with one side branch of the tube, which is your lungs, okay?

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:06.748
And then this is essentially a simplified version of the human body.

01:02:08.076 --> 01:02:33.415
and if we draw the outside here like this and then we make this a hole like that here you see and this can also be a hole right here and then essentially you have the inside right this tube and this tube is on the outside here that's a hole and a hole so food can go in that hole and then the waste products come out this hole and also air can go in this hole

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:37.407
And it can go back out the same hole, see?

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:39.068
Air goes in, air goes in.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:47.475
Air, food, and waste, yeah?

01:02:48.555 --> 01:02:56.261
And so the argument against intramuscular injection is that, I hope this red is full.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:59.223
I might not have filled this pen, so I apologize if it's not full.

01:02:59.783 --> 01:03:04.367
The idea is, is that at the border here, there is the immune system.

01:03:05.134 --> 01:03:15.178
The immune system is organized around the border and that border is the skin and it is all the epithelium inside your gut and all the epithelium inside your lungs.

01:03:15.278 --> 01:03:15.518
Yes.

01:03:16.619 --> 01:03:18.059
And so that's why I draw it like this.

01:03:18.159 --> 01:03:25.822
And then this is the other side of the diagram because you've been, you've been turned into a grapefruit and you've been cut in half, but wow, this is really bad.

01:03:25.962 --> 01:03:27.043
I got to put my glasses on.

01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:27.923
That's the problem.

01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:30.913
I'm trying to focus back and forth and it ain't working.

01:03:48.072 --> 01:03:55.596
that inside our guts we're essentially carrying around a compost heap and we're not dying with this compost heap inside of us.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.857
It's not burning out of control.

01:03:57.977 --> 01:03:59.098
It's not toxic.

01:03:59.358 --> 01:04:14.946
It's a real fine balance, in fact, in here with the food we eat that somehow or another, the symbiosis between the bacteria in our gut and ourselves allows us to carry around soil

01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:17.764
in our intestines.

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.369
And that's a pretty magnificent feat.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:21.951
It's pretty magical.

01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:28.242
And the reason why intramuscular injection to augment that system is so silly is because you're putting

01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:36.520
intramuscular injection goes right in here to the middle where all of the orientation of the immune system is from inside out.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:46.068
The whole organization of phagocytic cells, of the epithelium, of the T cells and B cells, the resident

01:04:47.389 --> 01:04:52.214
The resident cells, they're all organized in a fashion which has an orientation.

01:04:52.414 --> 01:04:56.118
Even in the lungs, there's an inside-out orientation.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.140
There's an inside-out orientation.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.502
On your skin, there's an inside-out orientation.

01:05:01.002 --> 01:05:03.364
And in the gut, there's an inside-out orientation.

01:05:04.105 --> 01:05:16.349
And so by putting intramuscular injection as a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting this system here, you are putting it in a place that is actually privileged already.

01:05:16.449 --> 01:05:23.591
It is already thought to be pathogen free or damage associated pattern free.

01:05:25.205 --> 01:05:36.029
Now, the interesting thing about this cartoon is that this is just the cartoon that is designed to explain my intramuscular injection is dumb from the perspective of the immune system.

01:05:36.469 --> 01:05:46.652
But what if we took this picture and we made it contain the hypersymbiosis that we're talking about in Biology 101?

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:49.433
So I hope this will work.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:51.393
I don't know which one of these is blue.

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:52.934
Is it this one?

01:05:53.968 --> 01:05:55.530
Can you see the blue difference there?

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.052
I hope you can see the blue difference.

01:05:57.092 --> 01:06:06.185
So if we put the bacteria here in our gut as little blue droplets.

01:06:08.018 --> 01:06:14.043
And so these bacteria in our gut are the bacteria that help us digest all of our food and process all of that.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:25.272
A lot of work is done by our friends, the bacteria, and they produce and release a lot of byproducts that are useful to us.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:30.616
If we didn't have a microbiome, then we wouldn't be able to accomplish all the things that we accomplish.

01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:31.257
We wouldn't live.

01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:35.425
You want to see and do an experiment on this.

01:06:35.465 --> 01:06:44.912
A very easy experiment to do is to go to your local drugstore and buy a product called Miralax and use it for about three weeks.

01:06:45.652 --> 01:06:47.573
Now, please do not do this.

01:06:47.774 --> 01:06:48.594
Do not do this.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:56.580
But it is a way that if one really wanted to prove to yourself that this is true, you can do it in a heartbeat because Miralax is a terrible product.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:01.143
What Miralax does is it takes all the water out of your intestine.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:07.851
And the idea of it is somehow it's supposed to be a laxative.

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:15.673
But what it does is that it decimates the microbiome.

01:07:15.693 --> 01:07:23.595
And oftentimes when children are prescribed Miralax and they're on it for any length of time, they end up going bananas.

01:07:24.694 --> 01:07:27.135
And there's lots of stories about this.

01:07:27.215 --> 01:07:28.176
People know this.

01:07:28.536 --> 01:07:29.737
They've known it for a long time.

01:07:29.777 --> 01:07:33.719
In fact, CHD has known it for a long time and really hasn't done anything.

01:07:33.739 --> 01:07:50.828
And if you go to CVS right now and you go to their counter, right next to the flu vaccine sign, you will see underneath it, Miralax is available over the counter in large quantities as if anybody that's constipated should just use this product.

01:07:50.868 --> 01:07:53.029
And I cannot stress the danger

01:07:53.888 --> 01:07:57.710
that this product represents to somebody becoming permanently dysregulated.

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:01.251
So here's your microbiome.

01:08:02.171 --> 01:08:13.056
The most important thing to understand is that the microbiome is composed of bacteria and their phages.

01:08:13.796 --> 01:08:15.417
Now, depending on what book you read,

01:08:16.212 --> 01:08:18.873
You know, you can read a lot of different microbiology books.

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:24.174
You can read a book like this one, which is titled The Genetics of Bacteria and Their Viruses.

01:08:27.275 --> 01:08:30.036
Or you can read a book like Virology.

01:08:31.476 --> 01:08:34.757
And there are very, very different conclusions that you will come to.

01:08:34.797 --> 01:08:44.720
But let's just suffice it to say that the bacteriophages that are passing through our body freely, through our gut epithelium freely,

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:52.611
are moving throughout all of our bodies and have been found in the liver and in the brain and in the heart and in all the places that they've looked.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:09:06.176
And so, one of the aspects of this picture, which is never really drawn in Biology 101 textbooks, is that there is continuous phage circulation

01:09:08.502 --> 01:09:10.522
within the gut and throughout the body.

01:09:10.742 --> 01:09:14.243
So the bacteria are not necessarily moving across the gut wall.

01:09:14.303 --> 01:09:19.424
They might move in and out of the Peyer's patches every night, but they're not moving in and out of the gut wall.

01:09:19.464 --> 01:09:21.585
They're basically trapped in the mucus.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:33.187
And so the phages are the ones that have the ability to move freely through the mucus and move freely past the epithelial barrier into circulation.

01:09:34.554 --> 01:09:51.178
And so one of the things as these phages are in circulation that could happen is that we could make antibodies to certain phages and preferentially support the phage communication of certain kinds of microbes in our gut.

01:09:51.718 --> 01:10:00.960
Essentially, if there are certain microbes which are beneficially using phages to communicate and enrich each other's environment,

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:16.358
then we could help those microbes by selecting their phages and working against or eliminating the phages of other microbes that we don't necessarily want and have not developed a symbiotic relationship since we were born.

01:10:18.393 --> 01:10:22.195
bacteria can pass through the mammary glands of your mother.

01:10:22.256 --> 01:10:31.241
And so if you were breastfed, its chances are that the majority of your gut microbiome was established by the bacteria which passed through your mother's milk.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:46.211
And therefore, your body would also learn the phages of those bacteria first in infancy and probably then develop a bias to them in the sense of when new bacteria started to become present in your gut as you ate new food.

01:10:49.653 --> 01:10:56.257
that those bacteria would have a hard time competing with the resident bacteria from the very beginning because their phages won't be tolerated.

01:10:58.658 --> 01:11:12.806
And so you can see the potential for disaster if your immune system is primarily there as part of a hyper symbiosis between you and that bacterial colony, that soil that you're carrying around in your gut.

01:11:15.008 --> 01:11:18.290
And that interplay is impossibly complex.

01:11:19.298 --> 01:11:33.441
And so trying to augment that by intramuscular injection becomes even more preposterous than before you thought of our symbiosis as so special as this, as so primary as this.

01:11:33.561 --> 01:11:43.824
And this is just the first very thin layer of a new biology 101, where you don't just think of the individual as the person in the genes.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:50.212
But you think of him or her as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

01:11:52.992 --> 01:11:54.013
It's a terrible picture.

01:11:54.313 --> 01:11:56.394
We're going to draw much better pictures in the future.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:02.236
But I'm just trying to get these ideas out there in a way that people can understand them.

01:12:02.836 --> 01:12:05.577
And I think I got to take a lot of shots at it before I'm going to get it right.

01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:08.938
And so I'm going to keep working on that.

01:12:10.038 --> 01:12:13.400
And I hope you'll be here for me as we keep going with this.

01:12:15.805 --> 01:12:40.891
So I think it's really important to explain to our kids how amazing that background is, how irreducibly complex the background of bacteria and their phages are in our microbiome, on our skin, in our environment, such that it is impossible for them to have tracked with such high fidelity a signal like the spike protein or an N protein or H5N1 avian flu.

01:12:44.346 --> 01:13:01.259
And of course, the most parsimonious example for the jumping of species of COVID or the jumping of species of an avian flu is that they're just infecting the same bacteria and that we all share a common set of symbiotic bacteria.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.922
We have a common theme.

01:13:05.303 --> 01:13:11.347
And so it's not surprising if occasionally we find a signal that should be tied to phage communication

01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:16.897
And we find that signal across lots of contemporary species.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:22.687
That's not that surprising because again, the foundation of life on earth is the microbiome.

01:13:23.668 --> 01:13:25.691
We carry soil in our guts.

01:13:27.981 --> 01:13:29.782
We can think our way out, ladies and gentlemen.

01:13:29.802 --> 01:13:31.063
That's what a biology coach is.

01:13:31.103 --> 01:13:38.726
I'm trying to get this stuff running on the hardwood, and it's gonna happen, but I'm just this close, I'm this close.

01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:42.868
Just to very review the Bad Biology 101, evolution because DNA.

01:13:42.888 --> 01:13:44.509
So DNA equals genes.

01:13:44.649 --> 01:13:46.970
Once they got there, now they can do whatever they want to.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.592
Genes is such a big word, they can use it for whatever they want.

01:13:50.012 --> 01:13:51.873
But genes generally cause disease.

01:13:52.513 --> 01:13:56.857
or genes create vulnerabilities that autism jumps out from.

01:13:57.678 --> 01:14:04.525
Genes code for proteins, but that's not sufficient to explain the pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

01:14:05.045 --> 01:14:09.930
But, nevertheless, these people have made an argument for a very long time that genes

01:14:11.349 --> 01:14:14.191
are the nature of the nature versus nurture.

01:14:14.211 --> 01:14:22.637
But since genes don't have the trajectory across time in them, because genes just code for proteins, then that's not possible.

01:14:22.717 --> 01:14:24.418
That's not all there is.

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.540
So it's already an illusion.

01:14:27.441 --> 01:14:32.523
If we keep going with this, then you can see that their model, most DNA is unnecessary.

01:14:32.643 --> 01:14:34.024
That's gotta be ridiculous.

01:14:34.844 --> 01:14:37.345
Because again, they're missing most of the data that's required.

01:14:38.226 --> 01:14:39.987
What diseases are nurtured then?

01:14:40.027 --> 01:14:41.767
This is one question you might ask yourself.

01:14:41.787 --> 01:14:43.988
Where are the codes for the trajectory across time?

01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:47.590
And which one do we need to understand more?

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:53.813
This is all part of the sort of illusion that they are perpetuating with this bad biology.

01:14:54.943 --> 01:15:03.407
But you can break out by realizing that most DNA is not understood, that protein sequences does not make a pattern integrity.

01:15:03.908 --> 01:15:10.671
If you realize that genes limit the possibilities or create limits on the possibilities, and that's about all they can do.

01:15:11.152 --> 01:15:14.173
They provide a template, maybe a storage thing, we don't know.

01:15:14.253 --> 01:15:15.414
But the idea

01:15:15.954 --> 01:15:18.896
that we already understand it is absurd.

01:15:19.676 --> 01:15:24.158
Self-assembly of proteins and folding and this kind of thing is definitely not the answer.

01:15:24.198 --> 01:15:29.721
You can't just mix all these things in the right quantity and now you'll have life, even though that's also part of this.

01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:37.905
And I think a good idea that I'm gleaning from Joshua Lederberg is the idea of eugenics versus euphenics.

01:15:37.985 --> 01:15:39.946
It's still kind of a dichotomy that I don't like.

01:15:40.546 --> 01:15:45.248
But it is a side of the coin that heretofore has not really been discussed.

01:15:45.329 --> 01:15:51.832
So eugenics would be the idea of, oh, we're going to fix the genes that are bad and make humans better.

01:15:51.872 --> 01:15:56.214
We're going to take over the evolution of the species by changing the DNA.

01:15:57.975 --> 01:16:01.317
Joshua Lederberg would have said that's absolutely ridiculous.

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:12.685
Until we understand the euphenics, how to optimize development, how to optimize the trajectory across time, then we can't possibly understand how to change the

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.881
plan for that trajectory across time.

01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:18.442
We have to understand that first.

01:16:18.922 --> 01:16:23.685
And so again, I'm just trying to accentuate the idea that this bad biology is what got us here.

01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:24.605
It's what we're trapped.

01:16:25.065 --> 01:16:28.307
There are no diseases blamed on bacteriophages.

01:16:29.108 --> 01:16:37.152
He had a very parsimonious explanation for why the bird flu is now found in so many different places is because it is a bacteriophage.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:43.115
The signal that they are purporting is bird flu is actually a bacteriophage signal.

01:16:43.877 --> 01:16:45.677
What signal do they say they're finding?

01:16:45.717 --> 01:16:48.118
We don't know because they don't need to say it anymore.

01:16:48.158 --> 01:16:53.639
Because we're so far down in this narrative trap that they don't even need to say it anymore.

01:16:53.659 --> 01:16:56.800
Bacteriophages are free to pass the gut barrier.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.601
They've been found wherever we look for them and they are very abundant.

01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:05.662
Interestingly, they are free to move through mucus.

01:17:07.103 --> 01:17:08.323
Just like on coral reefs.

01:17:09.912 --> 01:17:14.837
just like in the slime of fish, just like in the mucus of your gut, and in your lungs.

01:17:15.217 --> 01:17:20.582
And there is a fundamental reason for it, because that is a fundamental part of the hypersymbiosis.

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:33.573
And mitochondria, they are the remnants, they are the endosymbionts, and it is very possible that there is phage communication between the mitochondria of our cells and our microbiome directly.

01:17:34.153 --> 01:17:36.074
What is a pie with a tat?

01:17:36.214 --> 01:17:39.196
What is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time?

01:17:39.737 --> 01:17:43.399
I really think this is our task at hand.

01:17:43.779 --> 01:17:51.985
We have to take these ideas, the ideas about mitochondria, we have to think about payers patches, we have to think about what antibodies really do

01:17:52.847 --> 01:17:54.529
and whether they interact with phages.

01:17:55.830 --> 01:18:05.220
And if that's the case, then this pattern integrity with a trajectory across time has to do with mitochondria being endosymbionts, part of that phage communication.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.886
So messing with the immune system is messing with the regulation of mitochondria.

01:18:11.026 --> 01:18:11.807
Weird, right?

01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:13.369
That autism is mitochondria.

01:18:15.492 --> 01:18:18.333
And that endosymbiosis is really Lynn Margulis.

01:18:18.914 --> 01:18:24.036
If you're looking for a book, you're looking for Symbiosis in Cell Evolution by Lynn Margulis.

01:18:24.176 --> 01:18:24.676
It's a good one.

01:18:24.696 --> 01:18:25.657
You can get it on eBay.

01:18:26.557 --> 01:18:29.718
Peyer's Patches versus Rhizophagy.

01:18:30.319 --> 01:18:32.200
That will be our journal club in a couple days.

01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:43.167
You can learn a lot by looking at how plants roots interact with soil bacteria and how nutrients are extracted from soil bacteria.

01:18:43.307 --> 01:18:47.610
And then maybe see an interesting analogy with payers patches.

01:18:48.951 --> 01:18:50.893
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

01:18:51.313 --> 01:18:52.674
This is for your grandchildren.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:55.216
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:18:55.596 --> 01:19:01.040
You have to learn why and what this background is composed of and what Joshua Lederberg knew.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:07.051
and what Lynn Margolis knew and what we're learning again, what Brandy probably would have loved to learn with us.

01:19:08.065 --> 01:19:09.366
Thank you very much for being here.

01:19:09.406 --> 01:19:14.388
Don't forget they have not differentiated from the background That was it.

01:19:14.548 --> 01:19:15.209
I think that's it.

01:19:15.269 --> 01:19:16.389
I'm just gonna end it right there.

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:18.851
That's gonna be repeated This is gonna go here.

01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:26.395
So I will just say this one again Non-specific PCR tests with placebos ladies and gentlemen, it's very very easy.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.275
Very very simple.

01:19:27.815 --> 01:19:34.739
Thank you much for being here Thank you everybody for sharing the stream and I will see you again tomorrow

01:19:35.615 --> 01:19:37.436
I think we're going to try to put a little streak together.

01:19:37.456 --> 01:19:44.140
I don't know how many days in a row we'll get to, but I feel like there's a lot of work to be done and there are a lot of study halls.

01:19:45.341 --> 01:19:49.963
So I'll start with like a short study hall and then I'll do a journal club or something like that afterward.

01:19:51.384 --> 01:19:52.565
Double headers for a while.

01:19:53.265 --> 01:19:56.147
Thank you very much for being here and I will see you again tomorrow.

01:21:23.085 --> 01:21:25.133
Share it everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:25.294 --> 01:21:26.137
Share it if you can.

01:21:26.178 --> 01:21:26.800
Thank you very much.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.282
See you tomorrow.
