00:36.920 --> 00:46.360
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.200
I want people to complain.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.320
So what do I do?

00:49.320 --> 00:50.800
I go to Des Moines.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.160
Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines, I live

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
there for four years.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.360
I go to Des Moines, I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.960
I go to Seattle, I infect a couple of cases there.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.920
I go to North Carolina, I go to Wisconsin.

01:05.920 --> 01:11.400
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly

01:11.400 --> 01:13.120
morbid condition.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.120
These individuals complain.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.880
Again, this is a central nervous system condition, so they're complaining of whatever the bug

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
may do.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.560
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.040
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.360
I take attribution for that.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.440
Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.960
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and

01:35.960 --> 01:39.160
symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.640
These people are really sick with this.

01:40.640 --> 01:47.800
But then I say, others who are also infected will show subdramal, predramal signs of lethality

01:47.800 --> 01:53.400
and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.000
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've

01:58.040 --> 02:01.880
got every individual who's worried well, flooding the public health system, banging

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
on the door.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.080
The CDC comes back and says, nonsense, that's not real.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.680
I come back and say, that's fake news.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.840
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis

02:14.840 --> 02:16.800
and the public health system.

02:16.800 --> 02:26.120
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

02:26.280 --> 02:32.560
I also now know that our friend Jonathan Couey, who some of you will know from his lab leak

02:32.560 --> 02:39.160
series early in the pandemic called JC on a bike journal club on a bike, that he also

02:39.160 --> 02:41.120
has advanced the version of this hypothesis.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.520
So I don't claim it to be unique.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.680
I do think I arrived at it independently.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.480
Oh, look, JC on a bike was timed out by Risa.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.320
Oh, timeout, JC on a bike.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.160
JC on a bike.

02:55.240 --> 03:02.160
Yeah, well, I'm wise enough to know when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Look at round.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.600
It's JC on the bike, who says Vader didn't study music in college.

03:25.160 --> 03:34.600
Where, you know, I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.240
So that's the best I can do with that.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.680
I have no particular insight with regards to this.

04:08.240 --> 04:26.640
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
scenario.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.640
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
scenario.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
Stop lying!

04:33.640 --> 04:58.520
See, if you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally and these

04:58.520 --> 05:02.120
COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine okay, but actually they're kind

05:02.120 --> 05:07.240
of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines and, you know, anything with really

05:07.240 --> 05:11.360
rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada saying

05:11.360 --> 05:19.560
nine months is actually JJ Coe's insistence and I think he's right on calling them transfections

05:19.560 --> 05:26.560
rather than vaccines.

05:26.560 --> 05:44.080
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

05:44.080 --> 05:50.680
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.080
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
It's embarrassing.

05:55.080 --> 06:05.080
The rules protect us up at all times, follow my instructions, keep it clean, touch gloves

06:05.080 --> 06:08.080
if you wish, and let's do it.

06:08.080 --> 06:15.080
This is so crazy, like these bumps, this is so crazy, I feel so nervous, like what

06:15.080 --> 06:37.880
in the world, man?

06:37.880 --> 06:42.880
A serious discussion about prion disease.

06:42.880 --> 06:49.720
Bret Weinstein on Jimmy Dore, yeah, you know, again, he said transfection too late.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.120
He admitted it on Tucker Carlson that if he had said it earlier, it might not have been

06:54.120 --> 06:59.040
the same thing, it would have been the truth instead of something that is or isn't true.

06:59.040 --> 07:04.880
Don't forget, not only can they, they can throttle you, but they can also fool you into

07:04.880 --> 07:08.880
thinking you're being seen less because it's just a matter of what's perceived to be

07:08.880 --> 07:16.880
true, totally organic.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.880
A serious discussion about prion disease, I think we can do that, we're not going to

07:20.880 --> 07:25.880
do it today or tonight, but I think we can do that, I think we should, I think lots of

07:25.880 --> 07:32.880
people are.

07:32.880 --> 07:42.880
It's a little loud there.

07:42.880 --> 07:50.880
It's about the whole mess, this is going to be about the whole mess, and incidentally,

07:50.880 --> 07:58.880
chronic wasting disease or whatever it's called in deer was discussed on the Joe Rogan podcast

07:58.880 --> 08:06.880
and by Mr. Olsterholm, Dr. Olsterholm, when he showed up on Joe Rogan's podcast to seed

08:06.880 --> 08:12.880
the narrative that this was a natural zoonosis.

08:12.880 --> 08:19.880
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses

08:19.880 --> 08:23.880
is an important element in democratic society.

08:23.880 --> 08:29.880
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government

08:29.880 --> 08:36.880
which is the true ruling power of our country.

08:36.880 --> 08:44.880
Olsterholm was seeding the narrative about pre-ons already back exactly at the beginning of the narrative

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
at the Joe Rogan start of the narrative.

08:47.880 --> 08:55.880
In fact, as we looked at yesterday, AI and its potential was already seeded near the beginning of the pandemic

08:55.880 --> 09:02.880
already ripe for the picking and then kind of mixed in with some of the stuff and we'll see it tonight.

09:02.880 --> 09:11.880
We just don't want to forget our history and hopefully everybody who's watching knows some people who can see when shown

09:11.880 --> 09:17.880
because those who do not see are not savable right now.

09:17.880 --> 09:27.880
This is the biology that is easier to ignore, easier to ignore.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.880
It's easier to just go along with it than to realize you've been bamboozled.

09:31.880 --> 09:38.880
I mean, it's painful to realize you've been bamboozled. I cried about it.

09:38.880 --> 09:50.880
My friend Nathan passed away. I cried for many days because I realized that not coming out of this bamboozlement early enough

09:50.880 --> 09:57.880
thinking that I had already pulled myself out when I realized that there wasn't really a pandemic that was any danger to anybody.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.880
I thought I already figured it out.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.880
When I figured out that even if it was a lab leak, it wasn't going to be that big a deal.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.880
I thought I figured it out, but I still hadn't figured it out.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.880
I still couldn't see the bricks at the back of the theater then.

10:10.880 --> 10:18.880
I knew they were lying, but I was still buying a lot of the scenery. I was still buying a lot of the actors.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.880
And so I didn't know where the theater ended yet.

10:22.880 --> 10:30.880
It took me another year and a half or two years to see where the theater finally ended.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.880
Good evening, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon.

10:34.880 --> 10:47.880
Wherever you are in this great planet, it's 11 o'clock almost in the evening here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:47.880 --> 10:55.880
Just like to give you a chance to read this if you haven't read it before.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.880
This is a stream brought to you by a patch clamp physiologist.

10:59.880 --> 11:13.880
GigaOhm is the resistance of the seals that are required in order to make the high resistance low noise recordings that are the sort of bread and butter of patch clamp physiology.

11:13.880 --> 11:18.880
And so this is GigaOhm Biological high resistance low noise information brief, which is named after that.

11:18.880 --> 11:24.880
You can find me at gigaohmbiological.com and you can also find me at gigaohm.bio.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.880
Or like a Twitter substitute there.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.880
You can find my confession at the link called Scooby.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.880
You can find a way to support me one time there at the first link.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.880
I would link to this brief. I'll link to the schedule.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.880
You can find a phone number where you can call me and I often answer lately.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.880
You can also leave a voicemail there, email address, and then of course subscribers.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.880
I got to ask you to subscribe if you can.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.880
Share it with people who can subscribe.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.880
Did I say subscribe?

11:54.880 --> 11:59.880
Because this is my day job, my night job, my whole job.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.880
I'm going to try and make this work.

12:02.880 --> 12:08.880
Starting next week there's going to be weekly PDFs and slide decks will be available a little more.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.880
All of these people are so far taking the risk.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.880
I think you should take the risk too.

12:13.880 --> 12:21.880
If we get enough people doing this, this will become perhaps one of the premier science news sources on the Internet.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.880
And something that can be there every day.

12:24.880 --> 12:29.880
And some days maybe multiple times with shorts that are available to download.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.880
All kinds of plans we have in the works.

12:33.880 --> 12:41.880
I've got some collaborators, some secret squirrels working with me now and I hope this is going to get better and better.

12:43.880 --> 12:50.880
I don't know, you're right on time.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.880
Right on time, Lake Lady.

13:13.880 --> 13:24.880
They're probably going to bump this, so I'm going to give this actually a little click back here.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.880
They don't like that one part with that lady's voice.

13:27.880 --> 13:35.880
And for some reason I think that's a copyrighted clip from a movie or something that my old buddy dubbed in there a long time ago.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.880
So I'm going to clip back here to this original beat.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.880
I apologize for that.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.880
Rather abrupt transition.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.880
I assume that most people are not dancing to the street and so that didn't disrupt anybody's.

13:47.880 --> 13:55.880
Jive, we've been lost on this road for a long time, ladies and gentlemen, where people keep telling us that there was a novel virus and millions of people died from.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.880
The millions more were saved from, that likely came from gain of function and it will definitely come again.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.880
And we're trying to escape.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.880
We're trying to find a ride on the side of the road here.

14:05.880 --> 14:15.880
And every time we get picked up by a new set of medlers, a new set of storytellers, and in the end they keep telling us the same dang story.

14:15.880 --> 14:29.880
Always comes right back around to not talking about their fact that there's no evidence of spread in New York City, not talking about the fact that infectious clones are the only interesting thing to talk about with respect to coronavirus biology,

14:29.880 --> 14:42.880
talking about the usefulness of placebo batches, and not talking about the fact that transfection, everybody in academic biology should have done known better, that transfection in healthy humans is dumb.

14:42.880 --> 14:49.880
Doctors in hospitals should have known that the protocols were murder and many of them did.

14:49.880 --> 15:01.880
All of the virologists and all of these people that have any ideas about how RNA and DNA work should know better than they should know that gain of function is a mythology.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.880
They should know that we've, and it should be knowable.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.880
It should be knowable for them that we have been led to solve a mystery.

15:11.880 --> 15:18.880
It should be knowable to them that the only thing that would be required is a spectacular commitment to lies.

15:18.880 --> 15:31.880
And so we have to have optimism and hope that these people are still convertible, that we could still have a mass conversion inside of academic biology that realizes that this PCR was a scam.

15:31.880 --> 15:45.880
That these sequences have to be a scam that the RNA spilled in a puddle or tracked out on the back of someone's shoe could not possibly could not possibly circulate the globe for five years running.

15:45.880 --> 15:55.880
And so we have to deal with a carefully traceable phylogenetic tree of sequences that mainly change at one protein of 31.

15:55.880 --> 16:01.880
No ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time that this mythology comes to an end, a screeching halt if we can.

16:01.880 --> 16:11.880
But since we're on a starship going at light speed or warp 10, I don't know if we're going to be able to come to a screeching halt, but we've got to slow this thing down.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.880
The starship to slow down to impulse power.

16:14.880 --> 16:26.880
And that's really what we're working on right now here at Eagle Home Biological, trying to get this thing to slow down to impulse power and drop out of warp speed.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.880
I don't know how easy that's going to be to do.

16:29.880 --> 16:35.880
This is GigaOhm Biological, a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:35.880 --> 16:43.880
My name is Jonathan Couey. I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh in the back of my garage. I apologize. We have a lot of basketball today.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.880
And I apologize for getting on late. We just had a lot of things going in order to keep.

16:48.880 --> 17:01.880
We had our Dutch grandma here for a month over Christmas and it was the kind of family.

17:02.880 --> 17:10.880
How do you say it? Lubricant, the family, you know, there was a missing piece in our family.

17:10.880 --> 17:17.880
And it turns out that one of the ways that that missing piece could be replaced is have an OMA around.

17:17.880 --> 17:27.880
I have a spectacular mother-in-law and she's a wonderful friend and a talented gider.

17:27.880 --> 17:34.880
You know, she knows how to step in and say things in a way that doesn't step on people's toes.

17:34.880 --> 17:49.880
You know, it's not that she never gets feedback from the kids or whatever, but, you know, for someone's mom, I mean, just a real class act.

17:49.880 --> 17:57.880
And it's been like three days of just misery here, not really, but, you know, we just miss the lady.

17:57.880 --> 18:06.880
We miss you very much. And, yeah, it requires a little bit more teamwork on the part of my wife and I,

18:06.880 --> 18:15.880
because before I could hand off to OMA, and OMA just had everything under control and definitely had everything under control with V.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.880
And so, yeah, it takes me a little bit longer to get down here and push the button.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.880
So I apologize, but we're going to record one every night. Don't worry.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.880
Let me turn this music down a little bit over here. It's a little bit more awkward.

18:28.880 --> 18:33.880
I got an older computer over here now again. I had to downgrade, so to speak.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.880
Still got to get that thing in a box.

18:36.880 --> 18:41.880
Let me get out of this and get me a new slide deck up here.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.880
Cancel. I don't know why you're doing that to me.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.880
And that's where I want it. Yeah, that's right.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.880
I hope this evening finds everybody well.

18:55.880 --> 19:01.880
I have a noise in the background of my stream last night. It's not in the recording, but it seems to be on Twitch.

19:01.880 --> 19:09.880
And I can try to apologize for that. I don't really know what good it does to apologize for it, but I do apologize.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.880
I'm trying to clean things up. I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this new computer that might be bleeding some noise in there.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.880
This is GigaOhm Biological the safest way to get biology into your head.

19:21.880 --> 19:27.880
We are on a nightly basis, basically trying to dissect the idea that we were tricked into solving a mystery.

19:27.880 --> 19:34.880
I use the analogy of Scooby-Doo because this is a cartoon about a group of teenagers and their big giant dog.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.880
Who solve mysteries on a nightly basis depending on what town they're in.

19:39.880 --> 19:49.880
And inevitably the mysteries are always solved by the removing of a mask and the revealing of a rich guy or a bad guy or the groundskeeper.

19:49.880 --> 19:54.880
Who are all trying to steal something or protect some criminal operation.

19:54.880 --> 20:03.880
And so inevitably they have to set a trap and then the trap is sprung and then the guy gets caught and then they take off the mask and they find out what was chasing them around

20:03.880 --> 20:10.880
and scaring everybody for 20 minutes is actually something they could have just stopped and tackled because it was just a fat old man who smokes cigars.

20:10.880 --> 20:19.880
But anyway, the point is that we have been tricked by people on TV, by people in government, by people in the military,

20:19.880 --> 20:29.880
probably by people in the pharmaceutical industry, probably by people in industries in parallel to an adjacent to the pharmaceutical industry.

20:29.880 --> 20:38.880
Probably by lots of different people we have been hoodwinked into believing that this was a real pandemic, a real crisis.

20:38.880 --> 20:47.880
Some of these people have been waiting for many, many years to try again and get the worst case scenario to be fully believed around the world.

20:47.880 --> 20:59.880
And more and more often it's more and more regularly it's becoming obvious to me that this was an elaborate science fiction theater.

20:59.880 --> 21:06.880
And it was executed with such exquisite attention to detail that several of these narratives...

21:06.880 --> 21:11.880
What I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain. So what do I do?

21:11.880 --> 21:14.880
I've played this at the beginning and I'll play it again as I switch.

21:14.880 --> 21:19.880
I go to Des Moines. I live there for four years. I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

21:19.880 --> 21:24.880
I go to Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there. I go to...

21:24.880 --> 21:30.880
You heard this a lot of times. You haven't necessarily read this list a number of times though.

21:30.880 --> 21:37.880
And so I'll read this list to you and try to discuss it just briefly to make sure you see I hear a lot of wind.

21:37.880 --> 21:42.880
Is that okay? Is that still a decent amount of volume or is my better here?

21:42.880 --> 21:50.880
A military response with the ability to drive local mass casualty events.

21:50.880 --> 21:56.880
What I'm suggesting here is that the military may have been involved in places like New York City,

21:56.880 --> 22:01.880
maybe in places like Italy, not the American military then necessarily,

22:01.880 --> 22:08.880
but a military force there to coordinate and assure that the mass casualty event occurred

22:08.880 --> 22:13.880
and that the mass casualty event was recorded in the proper way.

22:13.880 --> 22:18.880
The military might have also been involved in intercepting the early responding people,

22:18.880 --> 22:23.880
the really good Samaritan people that would show up at the beginning of such a mass casualty event

22:23.880 --> 22:30.880
as its existence was broadcast on the news in order to see the narrative that Dr. Giordano was talking about

22:30.880 --> 22:34.880
where people are complaining about this novel pathogen.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.880
They needed to complain about it on the news and when they did that people like Pierre Corey

22:39.880 --> 22:44.880
and people like Nurse Aaron rushed to New York to help.

22:44.880 --> 22:52.880
Some of them rushed to New York to help under the fain or the disguise of being a nurse rushing into the fire

22:52.880 --> 22:56.880
and were likely already co-opted long before the pandemic,

22:56.880 --> 23:02.880
especially given her track record with anti-vax groups in Florida previous to the pandemic.

23:02.880 --> 23:09.880
But Pierre Corey could have very easily been a good guy running into the fire

23:09.880 --> 23:17.880
and meeting this military presence that was there to drive a local mass casualty event

23:17.880 --> 23:20.880
and make sure that it was interpreted correctly.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.880
And he may have been co-opted.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.880
We need your help.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.880
We need you to make a video for us that says that we're at war with this virus

23:28.880 --> 23:30.880
that to take everybody seriously.

23:30.880 --> 23:35.880
And even if he told them, yeah, but I don't see anybody here anymore,

23:35.880 --> 23:38.880
they would tell him, yeah, but you just missed it.

23:38.880 --> 23:44.880
Like three weeks ago there were there were 5,000 people dying a week here in New York.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
You just missed it.

23:45.880 --> 23:51.880
Oh, really? Wow. So the trucks just left? Yeah, the trucks just left.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.880
As far as Corey knows, that's what happened.

23:54.880 --> 24:00.880
He wasn't there when it happened. He got there right after it happened.

24:00.880 --> 24:05.880
And so he did all that he could help a co-opted, pre-selected group of narrative controllers.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.880
Maybe he met Nurse Aaron there and Nurse Aaron convinced him.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.880
Told him what she saw.

24:13.880 --> 24:19.880
Told him the same thing that she said from the bed of a hotel room at the heart of this pandemic

24:19.880 --> 24:22.880
right about Elmhurst Hospital.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.880
The pandemic nurse.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.880
A combination of background signal and nonspecific test is spread.

24:29.880 --> 24:37.880
Now we need molecular biologists and we need some exemplars of all of these tests that were used in the United States.

24:37.880 --> 24:50.880
Some 250 odd emergency use authorized PCR diagnostics were circulating in the United States being used to track and trace, etc.

24:50.880 --> 24:56.880
We need some samples of these things so that we can see exactly what they were.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.880
If they were highly specific with nested primers, that might mean one thing.

25:01.880 --> 25:08.880
If they had no nested primers and they were aimed at random stuff, then that might mean something completely different.

25:08.880 --> 25:19.880
But we're looking at a combination of background signal and a nonspecific PCR test to create the illusion of spreading positivity.

25:19.880 --> 25:28.880
And the way you break that illusion is to say that there is nothing that we have no data about how this signal would look before 2020.

25:28.880 --> 25:36.880
So if it would look exactly the same with a wave and a wave and a wave wherever we put the test, we don't know.

25:36.880 --> 25:44.880
Because before 2020, there were zero emergency use authorized PCR diagnostics.

25:44.880 --> 25:52.880
In 2021, there were 222 in the United States alone.

25:52.880 --> 25:59.880
We find all the lateral flow testing and stuff that was going on overseas and in Europe and here.

25:59.880 --> 26:12.880
A financial and legal incentive to call COVID again the legal incentive in New York was was absolutely malevolent because you were legally indemnified from malpractice.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.880
Whatever the danger of malpractice or the potential for malpractice.

26:16.880 --> 26:25.880
If there was a diagnosis of COVID in New York for over a month, maybe longer, a coordinated propaganda campaign to drill confusing worst case scenario.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.880
Well, that was done on television, of course.

26:27.880 --> 26:32.880
Everything from build back better to the new normal to 15 days to slow the spread.

26:32.880 --> 26:42.880
These kinds of ideas that were repeated over and over again in the UK, it was even worse with their sage people.

26:42.880 --> 26:50.880
This drove the idea that something was happening in coordination with this mass casualty event in a few places around the world.

26:50.880 --> 26:56.880
COVID hospital protocols capable of increasing all cause mortality, but then had to be ignored on TV.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.880
And again, I've explained it with the analogy.

26:59.880 --> 27:19.880
If you could go into every operating room and recalibrate the anesthesia so that the anesthesiologist would inadvertently kill 15% of his or her patients more than would normally die on the table.

27:20.880 --> 27:35.880
If you could go and tweak all of the ventilators in a hospital so that they would kill 50% of the people that were put on them.

27:36.880 --> 27:51.880
These are the kinds of things that you could use to increase all cause mortality in such a way that would be indiscernible from a spreading pathogen if the assumption was that there was a spreading pathogen.

27:51.880 --> 28:01.880
And this is the monumental mistake that we were led to make by a combination of all this theater, these theatrics.

28:02.880 --> 28:06.880
Emergency social policies capable of increasing all cause mortality.

28:06.880 --> 28:21.880
This is the kind of thing like do not resuscitate orders for EMTs in New York City and then conflating the increase in heart attack deaths with COVID rather than the fact that the EMTs were told not to resuscitate.

28:22.880 --> 28:27.880
Convince a public that the lab leak cover up was happening before their eyes.

28:27.880 --> 28:37.880
Of course, that's why Rand Paul and Antonio Fauci had such a ridiculously over the top argument in front of everybody in Congress about gain a function.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.880
It wasn't because Rand Paul lacks decorum.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.880
It wasn't because Tony Fauci was just defending honest research.

28:46.880 --> 28:58.880
It was because they wanted to convince every Tom Dick and Harry that their mystery to solve was is this a real pandemic from a bad cave or is this a real pandemic from a laboratory.

28:59.880 --> 29:05.880
So that no matter what conclusion Tom Dick or Harry came to there, it would be a real pandemic.

29:06.880 --> 29:24.880
And finally, they use the island nations, you know, New Zealand, Australia to demonstrate that lockdowns work and they went extra dramatic with the videos that we saw for us to make it feel as though, wow, we don't have it as bad as they do.

29:25.880 --> 29:34.880
So we might as well accept our, you know, state by state policy. At least we have that in America because boy, they got it tough down there. Don't they? Holy cow.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.880
That's exactly by design.

29:40.880 --> 29:50.880
It's exactly by design because the Australians in the New Zealanders have also been led to believe that that lockdown actually did save them for a while.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.880
And now they're being led to believe that it's only the shot that's hurting them.

29:57.880 --> 30:04.880
But they have already accepted that there was a virus. They have already accepted that there was circulation and spread. They just avoided it.

30:05.880 --> 30:14.880
And so in a lot of ways, the operation worked on them as well, but since that's not the economy that we're really trying to destroy. It doesn't matter so much.

30:15.880 --> 30:28.880
And so that's really where we are. Most of these people are unwitting participants. Most of these people were put into places of influence before the pandemic and found themselves between a rock and a hard place as this thing unrolled.

30:31.880 --> 30:37.880
But four years into this into the fifth year, none of these people have an excuse at this stage.

30:38.880 --> 30:45.880
And some of the people that are rising to the absolute top are right there at the bottom at the top. These no virus people, the Bailey's.

30:46.880 --> 31:06.880
Cowan and and and Kaufman. They don't look half bad anymore, although I have to still say that I think that some of them, if we analyze deep enough, we could find and point to people in that group who were so focused.

31:08.880 --> 31:13.880
So focused on the viral debate and so.

31:14.880 --> 31:26.880
Unable to articulate that, okay, so people are not dying from a virus because viruses don't circulate. There may not even be viruses. So why are people dying and then explaining it.

31:27.880 --> 31:34.880
Calling it what it was, which was murder in hospitals, I atrogenic murder.

31:35.880 --> 31:49.880
And I never heard that from them. I only heard confrontations where it was about virus or no virus. Do you believe in the virus or not? Cooey believes in the virus. So then we can't talk to Cooey or Cooey's a bad guy because he's perpetuating this thing about viruses.

31:50.880 --> 31:57.880
And so it disqualified any conversation at all. You couldn't talk rationally with them. It didn't make sense, but he would all they would go on.

31:58.880 --> 32:04.880
They went on stream with a couple people. They went on stream with with some really nasty people too.

32:07.880 --> 32:25.880
It's just strange because now, of course, I guess it's fine now, but I just want everybody to know that I got taken by the combination of all of it. And part of the combination was the absurd behavior of some of these people in that group.

32:26.880 --> 32:46.880
Mainly Kaufman and Cowan. And I think they urged coached Christine Massey into her sort of rage that I don't think is is is genuinely directed at anybody other than just the frustration that she knows the truth that there's no virus.

32:47.880 --> 33:08.880
She's been drilled into believing that her foyas are so exculpatory or so condemning or whatever the right word is. I think those two are opposite words, but they're so important that they have to take the front stage all the time and it's just it's ridiculous on its face.

33:09.880 --> 33:26.880
And so it feels very much as though she's being used again to create this absurdity to create this sort of impossible bridge that that, you know, we should have been working together already two years ago when I wanted to have.

33:27.880 --> 33:34.880
Sam Bailey on my stream to talk about the absurdity of the PCR test and the the impossibility that it could be used correctly.

33:35.880 --> 33:44.880
And then suddenly it never happened again and I became person non grata until I started speaking for CHD. Then it was even worse.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.880
And now six months later here I am on the outside again.

33:52.880 --> 34:02.880
Because this message isn't compatible with a lot of different people and organizations apparently.

34:03.880 --> 34:20.880
So what are we doing here if we can't talk about the fact that that this narrative is being preserved in books that this narrative is being preserved over and over and over again by the people that are supposed to be breaking us freely.

34:22.880 --> 34:33.880
The people that are have voluntarily taken the torch out of other people's hands stepped in front of other people on stage taking the microphone out of people's hands.

34:35.880 --> 34:47.880
And by people who were given a microphone not earning one, but given one put in places of influence even before the pandemic that they didn't deserve.

34:48.880 --> 34:55.880
Theatrix to put people on the internet that could help govern the populace.

34:56.880 --> 35:04.880
As Bernays said it's it's the governing of the habits and whims of the populace.

35:06.880 --> 35:11.880
And keeping us away from questioning this faith is what all of these people have done wittingly or unwittingly.

35:12.880 --> 35:18.880
And as we dissect this little people narrative here we can save our children.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.880
That's what this is all about.

35:22.880 --> 35:27.880
Saving our children from growing up to believing that pandemic potential exists in bad caves.

35:28.880 --> 35:29.880
That it can be accessed by cell culture.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.880
That it can be accessed through serial passage or or genetic stitching.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.880
That's the biology that Bret Weinstein teaches.

35:40.880 --> 35:46.880
That's the Brett that's the biology that's written in all of those books.

35:47.880 --> 35:58.880
It's the biology that all of these people have been pushing since before the pandemic Sam Harris has been pushing 75% lethality in a virus.

35:59.880 --> 36:07.880
You know until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

36:08.880 --> 36:14.880
You know and you know it's not it's you know measles plus and okay I can tolerate what you think about measles because.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.880
You know not that many people die from it. It's just a big hassle in the end.

36:20.880 --> 36:28.880
But no one when we have this new pandemic that is you know got 75% mortality and.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.880
It's not it's.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.880
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.880
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

36:39.880 --> 36:44.880
And this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.880
I mean so.

36:46.880 --> 36:51.880
I'm pleading with you to understand that these people are not there by accident.

36:53.880 --> 37:00.880
That Brett just didn't decide to be on his eighth podcast just before the pandemic was declared by accident.

37:01.880 --> 37:15.880
I can already hear the thing in in in somebody's head saying yeah but wait a minute JC on a bike started his neuroscience channel like a few months before.

37:16.880 --> 37:26.880
The pandemic started and then he was on his bike he just happened to be riding his bike and talking about coronavirus but I'll give you one excuse why that doesn't work.

37:27.880 --> 37:37.880
Because I was working at the University of Pittsburgh already for a couple years and I had already been filming for a long time and I can show you all that footage a lot of it's still on a hard drive because I was doing it for safety purposes.

37:39.880 --> 37:46.880
So I didn't I should have had a YouTube channel going for a few years and I was just lazy I never really pulled the trigger.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.880
Bret Weinstein was placed there.

37:52.880 --> 38:01.880
Bret Weinstein went through years of setup years of setup ladies and gentlemen this is a multi generational game.

38:02.880 --> 38:09.880
Don't think for one second that there's just a few weeks of planning and then that's all the farther they go every once in a while no.

38:10.880 --> 38:23.880
This is a long scripted long gained out they've done this a few times event 201 is a public version of what they've done behind the scenes probably many more times.

38:24.880 --> 38:39.880
The spars pandemic and those kinds of things that are freely available those are the public versions don't think for one second that there also aren't top secret versions that have even a more dramatic effect on the people that participate.

38:41.880 --> 38:52.880
Event 201 is not as effective even if it has a plushie for everybody at the door when they leave it's not as effective as a secret event 201.

38:53.880 --> 39:10.880
A secret event 201 at a secret location where you have to go through security and have special clearance to get there will have a lot more effect on those that participate then some kind of open broadcast event with Bill Gates on stage.

39:11.880 --> 39:24.880
I assure you and that's what they did besides the setup of coronavirus biology as pandemic potential a unique pandemic potential actually if you think about it.

39:28.880 --> 39:36.880
And conducting regular upper level exercises the secret ones are the ones that really matter the ones that really hit home the ones that really get people fired up and make them believe.

39:37.880 --> 39:52.880
And then of course they've gained it out already they knew what these transfections would do because they've been working with these lipid nanoparticles for a while they've been working with transfection for years they already knew that one of the biggest dangers would be this endothelial

39:53.880 --> 40:07.880
transfection and this potential inflammatory reaction of the endothelium and of myocarditis and this kind of thing it's all connected it's all the same basic tissue all connected together in the circulatory system.

40:08.880 --> 40:21.880
And so a transfection of the circulatory system is a super bad idea and so they seeded some of these symptomologies the most expected ones all of them into the narrative of the virus from the virus.

40:23.880 --> 40:27.880
And they did it through team worst case scenario.

40:29.880 --> 40:41.880
They did it through a plan where they said do not resuscitate people who are having heart attacks because you might spread the virus and then blame those heart attacks and increase cardiac problems on the virus.

40:42.880 --> 40:51.880
And now it's conveniently confounded when we say that these these transfections are causing myocarditis well the spike proteins in both.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.880
And the average Joe is fooled.

40:57.880 --> 41:10.880
Now if you make this a national security issue now you make this a national security priority and every once in a while a few guys in suits with sunglasses show up with the little curly wires behind their ears and they tell you okay you're being briefed.

41:10.880 --> 41:16.880
You either go home and shut your mouth or you keep going and you don't say this this and this anymore got it.

41:17.880 --> 41:37.880
I know that sounds very Hollywood movie but that's the way these things work and that's what they needed to do from a military perspective in order to make sure that everybody would take the shots compliance 100% compliance was the only objective and so lying is okay exaggeration is okay.

41:38.880 --> 41:52.880
Because we don't know under the pretense that we don't know we can tell you well the worst case scenario we do know and that is absolute disaster planet wide destruction so worst case scenario is pretty bad you better do what you told.

41:53.880 --> 42:03.880
And now they have successfully in the minds of the average people on the street confounded the toxicity of the virus with the toxicity of the transfection.

42:04.880 --> 42:22.880
And so it's going to be hard to tell these people they've been fooled into believing that the potential toxicities of the virus are much greater than the potentials for the toxicities in the shot even though they are largely parallel because the spike protein is found in both.

42:22.880 --> 42:30.880
Please understand how diabolical that mythology is because it implies a whole bunch of things that aren't true.

42:30.880 --> 42:41.880
Number one the fidelity of the spike protein in either viral infection or in transfection is by no means the fidelity that they imply.

42:42.880 --> 42:56.880
And what I mean by that is is that if there is a viral infection that can be called a coronavirus infection and the protein complement that is produced is very very wide and heterogeneous.

42:57.880 --> 43:10.880
It is not a single protein it's a bouquet of them because the copying of translation of and folding of it's all very very variable we're not doing a DNA thing here.

43:13.880 --> 43:25.880
And when you transfect someone with this terrible RNA product we don't know what you get on the other side but it's definitely not a well folded high fidelity copies of the same thing.

43:26.880 --> 43:36.880
We know that frame shifting can occur and substitutions and this kind of thing like wobble based it's all a mess.

43:39.880 --> 43:55.880
And yet they have convinced the average person on the street the skilled TV watcher that this very simple narrative that you can understand that Bret Weinstein can explain to you that the spike protein of the virus caused myocarditis.

43:56.880 --> 44:09.880
And so the spike protein in the transfection causes myocarditis Bret Weinstein and his wife Heather have explained this numerous times and still believe it.

44:10.880 --> 44:21.880
They are unaware of the fact that's what they want you to believe they're unaware of the fact that they were part of seating this narrative to confuse these things but they were.

44:22.880 --> 44:34.880
And it's very possible that they are unaware that they were involved in this there it's unaware because they weren't they were using bandanas they locked down for a year.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.880
They said we should have locked down harder so that we could get to zero covid faster.

44:40.880 --> 44:53.880
That if we all knew the Freemason secret weapon which is some random dosage of Ivermectin I guess that we could have ended this pandemic in 60 days of forced drugging.

44:55.880 --> 45:04.880
These are the kinds of ideas that they came up with so we can't expect them to be sophisticated enough to know that they were actually fooled or used.

45:05.880 --> 45:10.880
In deceiving the worst case scenario but we can try to inform them.

45:11.880 --> 45:20.880
And if they ignore what we are telling them if we ignore what we show them how devastating it was that each one of us any of us.

45:21.880 --> 45:31.880
That bought that line that there was a gain of function virus that it was potentially circulating the globe in a way that a regular virus wouldn't do because this one has a fear and cleavage site in it.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.880
And it may have been serial serially passaghed in humanized mice.

45:37.880 --> 45:58.880
So we may be dealing with something that we've never before seen says Charles Rixi says Kevin McCarron says Richard Fleming says all of the virologists says all of the people whispering behind the scenes and says Bret Weinstein says Yuri Dagan says the drastic team all these people

45:58.880 --> 46:07.880
seeded this worst case scenario narrative that was a gain of function virus that was unlike anything we've ever seen before.

46:08.880 --> 46:16.880
And it was so important to see this scenario so that people were terrified into transfecting themselves.

46:17.880 --> 46:18.880
That was the goal.

46:18.880 --> 46:44.880
And so they purposefully created mass casualty events and exaggerated it and projected off of them as the worst case scenario was happening purposefully across the board worst case scenario in the heads of state worst case scenario at the CDC level worst case scenario on the news worst case scenario in academia.

46:49.880 --> 47:07.880
And that's because they didn't do any of this math they didn't talk about any of the things that we've talked about nightly nightly nightly that they killed people in hospitals in a variety of ways in a changing ever evolving set of ways that ultimately ended up to include ventilation

47:08.880 --> 47:16.880
and they are now trying to tell us that severe and long COVID comes with kidney damage. Are you kidding me.

47:23.880 --> 47:31.880
And over and over and over again sorry I gotta go back on oh my gosh I gotta go back to now.

47:32.880 --> 47:58.880
Over and over and over again we seem to be forgetting 2020 and 2021 where this massive PCR and testing fraud took place where millions of tests millions of tests were manufactured that had never been manufactured before distributed sold used and acted upon.

47:59.880 --> 48:23.880
Setting millions if not billions of dollars in motion wasted funneled away from our economy and perpetuating this narrative that some of these some of these deaths over here could be accurately converted to COVID deaths using one of these many fraudulent.

48:24.880 --> 48:28.880
Fraudulent. Holy fraudulent laboratories.

48:29.880 --> 48:43.880
Do you understand that all of the laboratories that did any of the testing in 2020 and 2021 when Bret Weinstein was wearing a mask and advocating for lockdowns and not saying a damn thing about the damage we were doing to our children.

48:44.880 --> 48:49.880
That this testing those labs they're all gone.

48:50.880 --> 48:55.880
None of them exist anymore those buildings are empty those machines are gone.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.880
We don't know what they did.

48:59.880 --> 49:10.880
They could have taken all of those swabs and sold the DNA as remnants and never tested a damn thing just given us random results back and we wouldn't be able to find out nothing nothing zero.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.880
It's an emergency.

49:17.880 --> 49:26.880
Again, I do not want to diminish the value and the expertise of our national health care societies and international exercise like the WHO and the CDC.

49:27.880 --> 49:36.880
However, I think those are our bodies that are built for peacetime and not for war and we're at war right now with this virus and one of the main issues that we've seen is that.

49:37.880 --> 49:48.880
And so I'm trying to give Dr. Corey the benefit of the doubt that because he showed up after what we have seemed to identified as the worst part of New York.

49:49.880 --> 50:03.880
It's likely that he was asked to help spread the message of worst case scenarios so that compliance could be had and we can make sure that whatever he just missed happening in New York wouldn't happen anywhere else.

50:04.880 --> 50:17.880
I do think it's really possible that there are not all bad guys here that there are people who tried to do the right thing at the beginning and have slowly come to realize that they were a little bit taken.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.880
It wasn't quite as simple as they were told.

50:21.880 --> 50:26.880
It was a little more complicated and it definitely has to do with national security so now they're all a little scared.

50:27.880 --> 50:29.880
They're all a little weirded out.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.880
That's what I think's going on here.

50:36.880 --> 50:42.880
I think that's what's going on with a lot of these people because they talk behind the scenes very differently than they talk on their stream.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.880
They talk very differently behind the scenes than they tweet.

50:46.880 --> 50:54.880
I get a lot of really sweet voicemails and a lot of really sweet messages but I get a lot of really crappy tweets from the same people.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.880
And so there's different games going on here.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.880
There are different egos getting in the way.

51:02.880 --> 51:15.880
There are just people that haven't been kicked out of the moving truck enough to really understand what's going on and some of them already know exactly what's going on and that's why they're very comfortable obfuscating the truth.

51:16.880 --> 51:22.880
Some of them have known that they have been part of the ruling governance structure for many years.

51:23.880 --> 51:32.880
Joe Rogan is not unaware of how vital his program is to the governing structure of America and the world.

51:33.880 --> 51:37.880
He's not unaware of it because that's why he gets a hundred million dollar contract with Spotify.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.880
And Bret Weinstein aspires to be that kind of influencer.

51:43.880 --> 51:47.880
He wants to be that kind of tool for the ruling elite.

51:48.880 --> 51:53.880
But he wants to be thought of one of those tools that also has a brain of his own.

51:54.880 --> 51:58.880
I don't think he looks at Joe Rogan and sees an equal.

51:59.880 --> 52:06.880
I think one of Bret Weinstein's biggest weaknesses is that he doesn't see an equal very often at all.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.880
And that's a pretty bad misconception to be trapped in.

52:11.880 --> 52:17.880
There's a lot of people here who need to wake up a lot of people who need help waking up.

52:18.880 --> 52:25.880
I at one point in time was just as asleep as the rest of them where I thought it was a lab leak of a gain of function virus.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.880
But at least from the very beginning I was convinced that that didn't matter.

52:30.880 --> 52:35.880
That even worst case scenario we should still bet on our natural immunity.

52:35.880 --> 52:43.880
We should still bet on our health and optimize that rather than count on some kind of countermeasure or count on transfection.

52:44.880 --> 52:50.880
I knew from the very beginning that antibodies were and was a no brainer dumb idea.

52:51.880 --> 53:01.880
I didn't say it quite like Joe Lee does, but I was saying in 2020 that antibodies to a respiratory virus were a pretty dumb idea, especially IgG

53:02.880 --> 53:04.880
because they're in the blood.

53:04.880 --> 53:10.880
I didn't specifically say that they can't cross the lung blood barrier, but I mean that was kind of implied.

53:11.880 --> 53:21.880
And so we are dealing with a scenario where there are meddlers around who are attempting to take different parts of the truth

53:23.880 --> 53:30.880
and run with those parts, but they can't seem to summarize across the whole narrative.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.880
And that's how you know they're meddlers.

53:35.880 --> 53:47.880
If they come along and they tell you all about the contamination of the shot, but then they forget about the fact that the best case scenario for transfection is still bad, you can see that they're a medler.

53:48.880 --> 53:58.880
If they come along and tell you that they figured out that autism and all these things are caused by one thing, you know, like they just need to aspirate because it's the bolus theory.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.880
Then you know that they're meddlers.

54:02.880 --> 54:12.880
And if you come along and you say something like, I think I figured out how autism is caused and it's because all of these vaccines cause antibodies and antigens to make chains in the blood.

54:13.880 --> 54:25.880
It may be part of the mechanism, man, but it's not explaining everything because these are complex systems with complex consequences and complex chains of cascades of.

54:26.880 --> 54:33.880
Of patterned integrity that all go wrong in different directions and simple explanations are exactly the way that they have trapped us in the past.

54:36.880 --> 54:47.880
And I'm afraid that there are still people that are being put in our way offering us simple explanations that we're supposed to see as slam dunks when they're not slam dunks.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.880
The sacred biology is not a slam dunk.

54:50.880 --> 55:02.880
It's a lifelong process of trying to learn and understand exactly how wickedly complex a mammal is, never mind a human being.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.880
And so we were bamboozled by drastic.

55:08.880 --> 55:14.880
We were bamboozled by the lab leak and we were bamboozled by the same, these same people who seeded it.

55:14.880 --> 55:31.880
The scooby doo narrative of whether this was a lab leak or a natural virus was exquisitely seeded by a group named drastic on Twitter, of which I was a member and by people of the intellectual dark web who waxed intellectual about this very mystery.

55:32.880 --> 55:56.880
And we heard yesterday Bret Weinstein talking with with Lex Fridman on June 25, 2021, just two weeks after he had Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch on his podcast and they shook the world with three easy ways to end the pandemic.

55:57.880 --> 56:09.880
And so these people have been pretending to be part of a group of intellectual responders, intellectual first responders to the pandemic.

56:10.880 --> 56:20.880
And they have been slowing the role of the train and they have been assisting the train and starting again for several rounds now because they're really good guys.

56:21.880 --> 56:33.880
And they have every interest in stopping the pandemic. They had every interest in in preserving our rights and our sovereignty is they have every interest in preserving the freedoms of our children.

56:34.880 --> 56:38.880
Or so we are led to believe.

56:39.880 --> 56:51.880
And so unwitting participants in this narrative, of course, gets sucked in by these people because they get attention from them and they think, wow, look, Bret Weinstein's got my back.

56:51.880 --> 56:54.880
Bret Weinstein mentioned me on his podcast.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.880
I thought that a few times.

56:56.880 --> 57:00.880
The first time he mentioned me on his podcast, I thought, oh, sweet.

57:00.880 --> 57:06.880
A couple of weeks from now I'm going to be a guest on his show. I guarantee that he's setting it up right now.

57:07.880 --> 57:17.880
A couple of months later I got mentioned again. This time while he was on the couch with Robert Malone, I thought, okay, now when he comes back from England, I'm going to get a chance to be on his show.

57:20.880 --> 57:23.880
And it kept happening like that.

57:24.880 --> 57:38.880
Where my biology was kind of represented, okay, but not really overly simplified to the point of sort of making it not quite as powerful and convincing.

57:38.880 --> 57:51.880
But then more importantly, regularly, and I've played many of those clips regularly attributed to himself on purpose, exquisitely like right there, not subtly.

57:52.880 --> 57:59.880
I know other people have come up with this idea, but I came up with it on my own. Who says that?

57:59.880 --> 58:12.880
Except for somebody who's trying to purposefully insert themselves into a performance to audition for contribute to or maintain a performance.

58:12.880 --> 58:16.880
You can't step in front of me, man. I'm on stage.

58:17.880 --> 58:22.880
You can't, I'm using your lines because I'm on stage and you're not.

58:22.880 --> 58:26.880
That's the attitude that Bret Weinstein has.

58:26.880 --> 58:31.880
And he has that attitude because he was placed on stage and he knows that.

58:36.880 --> 58:43.880
These debates where we didn't talk about antibiotics or steroids, where we didn't talk about emergency biohazard protocols,

58:44.880 --> 58:49.880
where we didn't talk about the financial incentives at all, or we didn't talk about elderly care home malfeasance.

58:49.880 --> 58:55.880
But we discussed regularly about we don't know if this virus, if we even make immunity to this.

58:55.880 --> 59:12.880
I show you a tweet in the beginning of the stream where in 2020, Bret Weinstein is seeding that narrative, which was codified in the John Snow memorandum where all of these public health leaders stated distinctly that we're not even sure

59:12.880 --> 59:19.880
if natural immunity to this virus is possible. Why would there be no natural immunity possible to a virus?

59:19.880 --> 59:25.880
Well, Bret Weinstein will tell you because it might be a gain of function virus.

59:25.880 --> 59:29.880
And if it's a gain of function virus, we won't know if we can make natural immunity.

59:29.880 --> 59:38.880
All bets are off. And incidentally, people were just smart enough to notice that the guy that's standing at the back of the train pretending to stop it

59:38.880 --> 59:43.880
and the guy at the front of the train is pretending to stop it, they're pretty coordinated.

59:43.880 --> 59:49.880
That's pretty impressive how well they do that.

59:49.880 --> 01:00:03.880
And so, of course, people noticed that although in the John Snow memorandum they didn't explicitly say that it was a lab leak, they sure talked about it like it could have attributes heretofore never seen in a previous RNA virus.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.880
Why would they talk that way?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:30.880
And talking about vitamin D dismissal, for example, Tony Fauci went on Jennifer Garner's Instagram and talked about the fact that he was taking 4,000 units of vitamin D a day, but he wasn't sure whether he could recommend that for everybody and that we should see our doctors.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:42.880
He never said that anywhere else, but people heard it and people chatted about it and other people heard it and chatted about it to get regular people to chat about it.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:59.880
And they were also participating in this pretending to contribute to the train's movement, starting and stopping this theater of how a pandemic is fought, how a narrative is opposed how we get to the truth.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.880
How people are being censored.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.880
That was all part of the train exercise.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:15.880
It was all the people at different doors standing there doing the same thing this guy does, maybe with different noises or different motions, but all pretending to stop the train.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.880
And we were spellbound by these people.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.880
We were overwhelmed by these debates.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.880
When PCR cycle counts, did they matter?

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:49.880
Yes, but not as much as the fact that those PCR tests just were not as specific as academic biologists thought they should be thought that they were implying they were that a diagnostic implies they were when you call them a PCR diagnostic and you're an academic

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:56.880
biologist, you think, Holy cow, that might that thing must be incredibly specific.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.880
You would be wrong, of course.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:07.880
And so also there were people talking really vehemently about the idea that, well, you know, there's going to be these troublemakers that are going to say there's no virus.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:15.880
So there's going to be these troublemakers who are going to say that it's all 5G thing is the 5G's causing the virus. So don't let those people fool you.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.880
Stop lying.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:27.880
And so all of these debates made you accept the Scooby-Doo mystery and to accept the challenge of the Scooby.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880
I'm going to figure this out.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:38.880
I'm going to figure out why all these things are so important. I'm going to figure out why all these people are arguing about all this stuff. It must mean something.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.880
I mean, I can't believe how good they did it with hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.880
Two drugs that are all totally underutilized.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:58.880
And on the background of the United States would have been likely to make 50% of the people that took them probably feel good for some reason or another.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:16.880
And especially if they were inflamed, especially if they were in having inflammation, if they were having some kind of immune response, then potentially these anti inflammatory agents could have helped, but they weren't going to hurt anybody.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:41.880
And so doing show randomized control trials with obviously incorrect concentrations or doses, obviously incorrect usage or late application made it very easy for the same people to stand along the train and pretend to start and stop it, arguing about all that randomized control trial wasn't fair.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.880
Oh, that metadata proves it once and for all.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:54.880
And that went on for a long time with Ivermectin in 2021 and 2022, my friends, a long time.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:05.880
People were pretending to stop and start the train arguing about Ivermectin all the while, not questioning the novel virus.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:24.880
And they also did it at lots and lots of conferences, lots and lots of little meetings in the United States. There've been all kinds of little meetings where people show up for a weekend and rent a cheap hotel and meet in a meeting room and use PowerPoint

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.880
to take pictures of each other's shoes.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.880
And they've traveled far and wide.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.880
Belgium.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.880
They've done week long cruises off the coast of Turkey.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:52.880
And in November 18th and 19th, 2023 in Bucharest Romania, all of these people were there on stage for a couple days, presenting their latest findings.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Their latest fifth generation warfare messages.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:09.880
Some friends, some medlers, all participants in the Scooby-Doo in one way or another, wittingly or unwittingly.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:18.880
But the way that they are most likely controlled is that they invite you to one of these parties and make you feel important.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.880
They make you feel heard.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.880
They tell you that I've got a bigger platform than you. I'm going to promote you on my platform.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.880
And then on their platform, they say your name.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:35.880
And they say the one convenient thing about you that they can that won't hurt the narrative.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.880
It's there in the black letters. There was a novel virus. Millions died and millions more were saved from it.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.880
Likely came from getting a function and it will come again.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:53.880
And so they made Denis Rancourt feel like a friend feel like he was heard feel like he was part of the inside crew.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:03.880
And then they promoted Denis Rancourt's data about 17 million people getting killed by a shot and did not promote the data showing that the shot was killing mostly old people.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:14.880
It didn't promote the data that showed that the virus did not spread anywhere. There's no evidence for it at all. They didn't promote that data at all.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:22.880
But because he's friends and because they made him feel so welcome in Romania, he doesn't dare correct them.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:41.880
Same with Byram Bridle, the guy that Bret Weinstein and Robert Malone came out exactly to cover up the ongoing scandal in Canada where this guy Byram Bridle had gotten a FOIA request fulfilled by the Japanese government and found out the lipid nanoparticles go everywhere

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.880
and he went on the news and started talking about it.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:07:03.880
So they had to queue up the emergency crew and here came Bret Weinstein and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch on the Bret Weinstein podcast on June 11, 2021

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:12.880
to preempt to step right in front of at least on the American scene to step right in front of Byram Bridle.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:24.880
And so he's in Romania wide to make sure that he feels like he's still being heard. We got this dude. You didn't make a sacrifice for nothing.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:34.880
Even even Nick Hudson, who's got a message that there was no pandemic. There's no evidence of spread. There's no evidence in the numbers. It didn't happen. It's only happening now.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Even that guy needs quieting down.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.880
So they invite him to a Romanian conference. They talk to him. They treat him nice. They take him as a friend.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.880
And then after that conference is over, they 100% ignore him.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:08:00.880
Maybe Brian, Ryan Cole in the same position. You know why I like Ryan Cole because he was actually very, very well off before the pandemic. He had no reason to flip.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.880
He had no reason to turn.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:12.880
Now he may not be able to say certain things because he's read in because of the of the guys in the suits with the with the little earpieces.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.880
I could be, but anybody could be in that position.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:27.880
But the rest of these people, I think we can we can safely assume they have risen to notoriety artificially.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:42.880
That there's something so fishy about their background that there's just no other conclusion to come to. None of these people fit these these bills in yellow. None of them fit the bill of a freedom fighting.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:51.880
You know, I did a reluctant dissident. None of the the people in yellow are reluctant dissidents.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:09:07.880
Some of them have been making a living off of this vaccine system off of this bio weapons and and bio weapons mythology for decades.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:16.880
And so that's how we've come to celebrate Christmas in 2023 new year 2024 still believing in a novel virus.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:28.880
Because of a carefully crafted narrative, a carefully controlled release of a narrative that was a Scooby Doo mystery unsolved for you in real time.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:40.880
Just sit back and relax. Enjoy your Netflix and occasionally check in because this Scooby Doo team has got everything under control. They are going to solve the puzzle.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:49.880
And what they have instead done is engaged in a very limited spectrum of debate that is curated by them.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:10:01.880
To make sure that the presuppositions of the state are never questioned and always reinforced. That's what those people are doing to us.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:18.880
I want you to listen to an old video of Noam Chomsky from 1994 or 1996 where he explains how this limited spectrum of debate is used to govern the United States and the world.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:26.880
Do you believe what you read in the media? I'm not talking about dye and fergie but about the important stuff, the politics and economics.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.880
Has it ever occurred to you? It could be a system of propaganda designed to limit how you imagine the world.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.880
Well, that's the view of Noam Chomsky who's been teaching here in Boston for the past 30 years.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:49.880
Described as a narrative leading dissonant, he's based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where, although it's very cold, it isn't exactly the Gulag Archipelago.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:56.880
As a working journalist myself, I've come to talk to Professor Chomsky about bias in the media.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:23.880
All-wells nightmare, a place where propaganda rules where thought is controlled.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.880
Come here, it's attention. Here is a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:36.880
It's now a familiar, chilling Cold War fable. Most of us would say it's old hat. But is it?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.880
The thought police are joining you.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.880
The chief job of a newspaper is to inform.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.880
For decades, the freedoms of thought and expression have been central to Western democracy.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.880
The media sees itself as free, fearless, stroppy, and for many in power the press are too strong.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.880
So the idea that all-wells warning is still relevant may seem bizarre.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.880
But not to Noam Chomsky who thinks the image of a truth-seeking media is a sham.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:20.880
Chomsky has devoted his life to questioning Western state power.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.880
Having virtually invented modern linguistics for the age of 30, Chomsky joined the gathering swell of protest in the 60s.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:39.880
I'm Noam Chomsky, I'm a faculty at MIT, and I've been getting more and more heavily involved in anti-war activities for the last few years.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:51.880
Since then, Chomsky has championed a brand of anarchism, becoming deeply hostile to established power and privilege.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:57.880
And in recent years, he's refined what he calls the propaganda model of the media.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.880
On a brighter note, commercial break.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:08.880
He claims that the mass media brainwash under freedom, not only do the media systematically suppress and distort,

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.880
but when they do present facts, the context obscures their real meaning.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:25.880
The invasion of East Timor by the Indonesian army caused indescribable slaughter hundreds of thousands died.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:33.880
But it was more or less ignored by the mainstream Western media because Chomsky argues we were selling arms to the aggressors.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.880
But wars where the West's interests directly involved get a different treatment.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.880
But Chomsky, coverage of the Gulf War was servile.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.880
Trivial criticisms were aired, fundamental ones were ignored.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880
Hello, I'm Jumar. I see you high.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.880
I'm actually, Chomsky has numerous critics.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880
Which chair has been allotted?

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.880
Is the media so influential?

01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880
I'm over here.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:06.880
Have dissident views really been excluded in an age of relative media diversity in the age of the internet?

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880
This is one of...

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.880
What about Chomsky's own access?

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.880
What about this very programme?

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.880
Okay, I'm reading your own stuff.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:20.880
Professor Chomsky, could we start by listening to explain what the propaganda model as you call it is?

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:28.880
For many people, the idea that propaganda is used by democratic rather than nearly authoritarian government will be a strange one.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.880
Well, the term propaganda fell into disfavor around the Second World War.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:54.880
But in the 1920s and the 1930s, it was commonly used and in fact advocated by leading intellectuals, by the founders of modern political science, by Wilsonian progressives, and of course by the public relations industry, as a necessary technique to overcome the danger of democracy.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:01.880
The institutional structure of the media is quite straightforward. We're talking about the United States, but it's not very different elsewhere.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:11.880
The major... there are sectors, but the agenda setting media, the ones that sort of set the framework for everyone else, like the New York Times and the Washington Post and so on.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.880
These are major corporations, parts of even bigger conglomerates.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.880
Like other corporate institutions, they have a product with Anna Market.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.880
Their market is advertisers, that is, other businesses.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.880
Their product is relatively privileged audiences, more or less.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.880
They're selling audiences.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880
They're selling privileged audiences.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.880
They're selling privileged audiences.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.880
These are big corporations selling privileged audiences to other corporations.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:43.880
Now, the question is, what picture of the world would a rational person expect to come out of this structure?

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.880
Then we draw some conclusions about what you'd expect, and then we check, and yes, that's the picture of the world that comes out.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:59.880
And is this anything more than the idea that basically the press is relatively right-wing with some exceptions because it's owned by big business, which is a truism as well known?

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:16.880
Well, I would call the press relatively liberal. Here I agree with the right-wing critics, so especially the New York Times and the Washington Post, which are called, without a trace of irony, the New York Times is called the establishment left in, say, major foreign policy journals.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:27.880
And that's correct, but what's not recognized is that the role of the liberal intellectual establishment is to set very sharp bounds on how far you can go this far and no further.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880
Give me some examples of that.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:44.880
Well, let's take, say, the Vietnam War, the probably the leading critic, and in fact, one of the leading dissident intellectuals in the mainstream is Anthony Lewis of the New York Times, who did finally come around to opposing the Vietnam War about 1969,

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.880
about a year and a half after corporate America had more or less ordered Washington to call it off.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:17:01.880
And his picture from then on is that the war, as he put it, began with blundering efforts to do good, but it ended up by 1969 being a disaster and costing us too much.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.880
So what was that on the criticism?

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.880
What would the non-propaganda model have told Americans about the Vietnam War at the same time?

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.880
The same thing that the mainstream press was telling them about Afghanistan.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:29.880
The United States invaded, first of all, in the 1950s, it set up a standard Latin American style terror state, which had massacred tens of thousands of people, but was unable to control local uprising and everyone knows every specialist knows that's what it was.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.880
And when Kennedy came in in 1961, they had to make a decision because the government was collapsing under local attack.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.880
So the US just invaded the country.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:44.880
In 1961, the US Air Force started bombing South Vietnamese civilians, authorized napalm, craft destruction.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:54.880
Then in 1965, January, February 1965, the next major escalation took place against South Vietnam, not against North Vietnam, not as a sideshow.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.880
That's what an honest press would be saying, but you can't find a trace of it.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.880
Now, if the press is a censoring organization, tell me how that works.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:13.880
You're not suggesting that proprietors phone one another up, or that many journalists get to their copy spiked, as we say.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.880
It's actually Orwell.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:25.880
You may recall, has an essay called Literary Censorship in England, which was supposed to be the introduction to animal farm, except that it never appeared.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:32.880
In which he points out, look, I'm writing about it, a totalitarian society, but in free, democratic England, it's not all that different.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.880
And then he says, unpopular ideas can be silenced without any force.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.880
He gives a two sentence response, which is not very profound, but captures it.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.880
He says, two reasons.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:54.880
First, the press is owned by wealthy men who have ever interested in not having certain things appear, but second, the whole educational system from the beginning on through,

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.880
just gets you to understand that there are certain things you just don't say.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.880
Well, spelling these things out, that's perfectly correct.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.880
I mean, the first sentence is what we expand.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.880
This is what I don't get, because it suggests that, I mean, I'm a judge who'd let me, are self-sensoring.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.880
No, not self-sensoring.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:19.880
There's a filtering system that starts in kindergarten, and goes all the way through.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.880
And it's not done work 100%, but it's pretty effective.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.880
It selects for obedience and subordination.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.880
And especially, I think...

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.880
So stroppy people won't make it to the population, behavioralists.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.880
Behaviour problems.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:45.880
If you read applications to a graduate school, you'd see that people will tell you he doesn't get along too well with his colleagues.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880
You know how to interpret those things.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.700
I'm just interested in this because I was brought up, like a lot of people, probably

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:57.680
post-Watergate film and so on, to believe that journalism was a crusading craft and

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.160
that there were a lot of disputatious, stroppy, difficult people in journalism.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.280
And I have to say, I think I know some of them.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:09.520
Well, I know some of the best and best known investigative recorders in the United States.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.800
I won't mention names, but I would, whose attitude toward the media is much more cynical

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800
than mine.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.600
In fact, they regard the media as a sham and they know and they consciously talk about

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.240
how they try to play it like a violin.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.640
If they see a little opening, they'll try to squeeze something in that ordinarily wouldn't

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.400
make it through.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.360
And it's perfectly true that the, I'm sure you're speaking for the majority of journalists

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:40.720
who are trained, have it driven into their heads, that this is a crusading, a profession,

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:45.120
adversarial, we stand up against power, a very self-serving view.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.880
On the other hand, in my opinion, I hate to make a value judgment, but the better journalists

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.160
and in fact the ones who are often regarded as the best journalist have quite a different

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.160
picture.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.000
And I think a very realistic one.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
How can you know that I'm self-sensory?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
How can you know that you're self-sensory?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I don't say you're self-sensory.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.880
I'm sure you believe everything you're saying.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.480
But what I'm saying is if you believe something different, you wouldn't be sitting where

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480
you're sitting.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.480
Boom!

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.480
There it is, right there.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480
Boom, right there.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.280
I think that's also in the chat a little bit where we say that Bret and Eric would

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.920
sell their souls to be seen as scientific visionaries.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:23.440
I think there are a lot of journalists who would write anything they're told to write

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.680
in order to keep their job, in order to rise through the ranks of an organization like

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.120
that.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:38.320
And certainly if you were told that we will help you rise in a Joe Rogan-esque way on

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.120
the internet to become an independent member, maybe even the leader of an organization

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:52.160
called Loosely the Intellectual Dark Web, and you had the right kind of ego, it would

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.600
be a very enticing offer.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.600
And once you were sitting in that chair and then the pandemic kicked off and they told

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:08.200
you they needed their help, in order to get compliance, we'll take care of you.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.100
It's very easy to see how this was done.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.480
Even if they were unwitting at some point, they have figured it out.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.520
At some point, they had to have figured it out.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:24.240
At some point, they have to have figured out that the vaccine schedule is a scam.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:30.380
You can't be a medical freedom fighter for four years in this pandemic and not eventually

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.480
have said, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.440
What about the childhood vaccine schedule?

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:41.760
If you haven't asked that question out loud, if you're still saying like Bret Weinstein,

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.280
that the vaccine schedule is amazing and the vaccines are a miracle, they're the best idea

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.280
ever.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:54.240
They're such an amazingly elegant methodology.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.600
Then you are not a genuine thinker, you're really not, you just missed it, you lost it,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:06.600
you are incompetent as a biologist, you're incompetent as a doctor, you should be ashamed

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.200
of yourself.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:14.880
If you aren't aware now, at this stage, you need to get aware, you need to apologize

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:21.440
to your patients, to your family and friends, for not having figured out that RNA can't

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:28.200
pandemic, the transfection can't immunize you and that immunization by intramuscular

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:34.640
injection doesn't make any sense given what little we do know or think we know about

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:40.040
the immune system.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:46.840
But of course, all these deep thinkers were put in place and told to argue about things

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:51.840
that would not free us from this cage and more importantly, would not free our children

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.280
from this cage.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.960
So it didn't matter what car you got into, you would find someone in there or a combination

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:07.680
of people that would tell you nothing that would clear your mind of this mystery, nothing

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.240
that would clear your mind of these questions, nothing that would get you walking in the

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:20.280
right direction, you would always, always be more confused, always be more complicated,

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:27.320
always be oversimplified, never ever would you be led to question the novel virus, the

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:33.240
death of millions that millions more were saved and the gain of function was real or

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.120
not.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:40.000
None of these people will question that, ladies and gentlemen, not one of them will question

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.920
it.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.920
That's pretty remarkable.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.720
These are the people that we got in the car with.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.600
We were forced to get into the car with these.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.440
These were the only people that had cars on the internet.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:03.520
These were the people that were on all the podcasts circulating around all of the languages.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.480
If you got into the car with Robert Malone, you would definitely still believe in a novel

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.480
virus.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.040
You definitely still believe in a lab leak.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.200
You definitely still believe in gain of function.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.160
You definitely still believe that a virus would come again because he would have already

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.360
convinced you that a biology student in their garage with the proper eBay acquired

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.320
equipment could easily breed a new pandemic.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:33.840
Actually, he's also got a book out called the lies my government told me in the better

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.440
future coming.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.640
What's very curious about it is that he, I think when he first started to throw his career

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:51.040
away to save the world, he went to children's health defense.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.600
And I think children's health defense actually vetted him, you know, like, you know, had

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.520
some people check him out, even spent some time with him to see if he was really worth

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.160
supporting.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.400
And they decided to publish his book.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:12.720
You see, this book is actually published under the children's health defense logo.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.800
That's actually, you know, under Skyhorse publishing, I think they have their own little

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800
little thing.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.520
You know, I mean, they do some things with Skyhorse and some things were this one, but

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.080
I think they have their own little publishing thing now in cooperation with Skyhorse.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.800
And so child children's health defense is on his book.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.000
That's pretty cool for him.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.040
That's pretty has pretty cool that children's health defense put their, put their, their

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.120
rep on the line for him and published his book got it out there.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.600
That's super cool.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.360
Actually I think the truth about Wuhan with Andrew Huff is also published by Skyhorse

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360
publishing.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:56.080
So between Skyhorse publishing and these house label of children's health defense, they get

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.320
a lot of books out there that are worth reading.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.600
I think also Brian Hooker's book, Greed and Yellow book is so worth buying probably the

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.800
best book that children's health defense has put out in a while, although I'm kind

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.000
of, of course, I've got a little soft spot for the Wuhan cover up.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.080
But anyway, my point is is that Robert Malone probably has a lot to thank children's health

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.720
defense for because he, they, you know, they helped him get, get, get started in this dissident

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.440
movement.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.480
And I guess that's why if you would have gotten in the car with Robert Malone a long

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.400
time ago and thought he was a really cool dude and had been following him for a while

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.960
and seeing that he was aligned with children's health defense and seeing that he, you know,

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.280
likes Bobby a lot and follows Bobby around and was at a lot of conference, like at the

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.720
first children's health defense conference and, and at Bobby's inauguration.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.800
I mean, you'd think, wow, this guy's really in it.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.680
He's really in it to win it.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.960
And then suddenly he tweets out, no, I don't think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a really

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.040
good candidate for president because he's not a very good manager and exhibit one, according

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.920
to Robert Malone, his CHD isn't that weird.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.160
So CHD published his book.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.360
He's been promoting Bobby as a smart guy for a while now and, and, and, and used CHD to

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:30.720
publish his book and his good friend, Meryl Nass, up until as far as I know is, is, has

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:37.000
been affiliated with working for Ben and a scientific advisor for CHD and for Bobby

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.960
for many years now.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.560
And she's got a long record of being opposed to anthrax vaccines.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:55.480
And so she's got a real clear track record and a clear association with CHD, the same

01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:02.640
beautiful organization that is associated with the movie Vaxxed and associated with

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:09.280
really some of the biggest heroes in my mind of the anti-vaxx movement, like Brian Hooker.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.680
One of the few organizations in America that's really taking a stand against the vaccine

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.800
schedule and, and calling it for what it is, trying to push some of the, the best lawsuits

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.040
forward as far as I can tell.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.000
And so having come from that angle, thinking that Robert Malone had a lot of respect for

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.560
the organization, a lot of respect for the guy and a lot of the rest of the guy at the

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.120
head of it, and also a lot of respect for the people within it, seeing as one of his good

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:43.660
friends Meryl Nass is one of those people at the top of that pyramid of scientific advisement

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:50.420
of the, of the organization as far as I could tell before the pandemic.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.220
And what in the world is he doing here?

01:29:54.220 --> 01:30:00.860
Calling CHD, I don't know, I guess he's implying it's not a very well managed organization

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:07.700
that chooses its primary scientific advisors is, is Meryl Nass, it's not a very good organ,

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:14.700
what does that really mean?

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:23.060
And what does it mean to take a pop shot at CHD where your friend is affiliated where

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:28.660
your friend Bobby is affiliated with your friend Meryl is affiliated where all of these

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:33.620
heroes to the health freedom movement are affiliated that came through for you and published

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:37.060
your book.

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:42.900
And just like that, you throw them under the bus as a movement worth discarding for Donald

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:51.940
Trump, Donald Trump has better management skills than, than Robert F Kennedy Jr. and

01:30:51.940 --> 01:31:02.460
Donald Trump has, has presided over countless bankruptcies, countless interlayered LLCs,

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.740
and yet Robert Malone makes the argument that Donald Trump is a better presidential

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:14.780
candidate than Robert F Kennedy Jr. after getting his book published by the nonprofit

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:20.820
that Robert F Kennedy Jr. helped found what the world is going on here.

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.980
What car did we get into?

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:30.580
I thought I was in a car getting a ride to a gas station now I'm walking on the moon.

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.100
What's happening in this theater?

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.100
What's going on?

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:40.740
These people have lost their minds.

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:49.780
He listed on a sub stack quite some time ago already a whole list of medlers.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:56.100
Catherine Austin Fitts was on that list of medlers and George Webb was on that list of

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.100
medlers.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:07.660
Interestingly, George Webb was even given a link by Robert Malone, a link to a CBS 60

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.940
minutes broadcast at the start of the pandemic.

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:19.580
I mean, if he's a bad guy and you don't want anybody to follow him, why give links to a

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.180
60 minutes episode where he's featured?

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:27.140
We should watch that 60 minutes clip for a second and see what that's all about because

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:33.180
the last time Robert Malone told me to watch something, he told me to watch a Peter Kullis

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:38.460
video because Pieter Cullis probably should have gotten the Nobel Prize as well.

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:42.980
And then we found a Peter Kullis video from 2022 where he admitted that he wasted the

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:48.340
lives of four postdocs trying to get the LNP's to go somewhere that they wanted them to go

01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:51.140
and they could never do it.

01:32:51.140 --> 01:33:02.380
So Byram Bridle's data and his whistleblower account was completely corroborated by what

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:11.500
Pieter Cullis freely admitted in a Garnier lecture at a university in in Canada.

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.220
It's it's it's laughable.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:18.380
And so what are we going to find if we follow another lead from Robert Malone's list of

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:19.380
bad guys?

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.380
What are we going to find over here?

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.380
I wonder interesting.

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:24.380
This could be cool.

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:28.380
Oh, I didn't clip it.

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.380
Sorry.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:34.980
A priority of the new president and Congress will be reigning in the giants of social media

01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:43.340
on this Democrats and Republicans agree their target is a federal law known as section 230.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:49.540
In a single sentence, it's set off the big bang helping to create the universe of Google

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:52.700
Facebook, Twitter and the rest.

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:59.460
Some critics of the law say that it leaves social media free to ignore lies, hoaxes and

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:03.340
slander that can wreck the lives of innocent people.

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:06.780
Now keep in mind that this is March 2020.

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.820
So this is right at the seeding event of the pandemic.

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.020
We haven't actually locked down yet.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.900
And so we're still trying to seed the narrative that this pandemic could be a lot worse than

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.740
we thought.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.500
And we're already actually going to see the narrative of maybe it's a lab pandemic.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.700
And that's going to be in here, but not really in here.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:35.380
What's actually in here, it's under the guise of internet harassment.

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:40.780
And of course, you guys are all well aware that AI and the combination of anonymity and

01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:46.180
anonymity on the internet is going to be used to create the perfect brew for everybody to

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:53.340
demand or beg for internet digital ID so that there's no more anonymity on some of

01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:54.820
these platforms.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:01.060
And so at the beginning of the pandemic, they already intertwined these narratives, the

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:08.100
narrative of the need for better controls over the internet and censorship on the internet

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:13.660
and why censorship is so dangerous with the ongoing pandemic.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:20.260
I want you to see how this enchantment is so miraculous, how it's so beautiful, how

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:26.780
it's so diabolical that when somebody tells you there's fifth generation warfare being

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:33.340
waged on you that they're talking about 60 minutes, watch this carefully, listen carefully.

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:36.460
One of those critics is Lenny Posner.

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:43.580
After a tragedy in his own life, Posner has become a champion for victims of online lies

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:51.540
people including Mātya and Matt Benasi, who overnight became the target of death threats

01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:54.220
like these.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:57.660
The story will continue in a moment.

01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:05.100
We're going to put a bullet in their skull, let's load up the trucks, let's go get them,

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.900
let's hang them.

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.100
They posted our address, our full address, where we live.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:18.260
The hate, focused on Mātya and Matt Benasi, was unleashed by a hoax that claims she brought

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:21.020
COVID-19 into the world.

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:26.580
It's changed and migrated over the 70 plus videos that they've had about us, but 70?

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:34.620
Yeah, if you actually go through all the videos, there is a total of 70 videos across multiple

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.460
YouTube channels.

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:42.860
The videos claim Mātya Benasi carried the virus to China on a bicycle.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.380
She was invited there as a member of a U.S. military cycling team.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:53.740
Mātya is a Dutch immigrant, American citizen and soldier who served in Iraq.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:37:02.460
In 2019, during an international military Olympics, she crashed in Wuhan, where COVID-19 was discovered

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.460
two months later.

01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:10.300
Her collision with the internet began after an innocent article about the race.

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:14.780
And somebody came across it and they had Wuhan in and they took a run with it.

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.460
Oh, we got a person.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:22.220
Your name, the name Wuhan, and the rest only takes a lot of imagination.

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.220
Correct.

01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.900
What were they saying about you?

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:30.020
First they said I brought it to China and when I crashed, I spread it and that I spread

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:33.020
it in the hospital, which I never was in the hospital.

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:39.220
All these lies about vials in my bicycle, hittin', and I have no idea.

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:43.620
It's going to be this person by the name of Mātya Benasi, and we're going to fall.

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:49.460
The absurdity was spelled out literally by a hoax peddler named George Webb.

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.340
Now, do you think it's possible that George Webb got on 60 minutes because he's just

01:37:54.340 --> 01:38:02.340
a hoax peddler because they're just innocently covering some guy on the interwebs who harassed

01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:07.140
this Dutch person who cycled in the Wuhan games?

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:14.940
Do you really think that this is all just an elaborate gumshoe style story?

01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.140
They're just doing the background.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.500
We're just following wherever the lead goes.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:26.380
No, ladies and gentlemen, this is an elaborate fifth generation warfare narrative being given

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:32.380
to our old people, young people, anybody that's watching this video live, trying to

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:36.900
figure out why we're about to be stuck in our house.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:43.580
And Robert Malone shared it as part of the evidence for this guy being a relevant harasser

01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:48.860
in his own little universe.

01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:54.780
Peter and Ginger Bregan are also listed as bad guys by Robert Malone, but somehow or

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.380
another, that suit hasn't gone anywhere.

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:05.900
It was just a lot of fire and smoke and thunder that never went anywhere, but made sure that

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:10.420
that book that they've got that I've shown many times gets sold, the book about a lab

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:16.060
leak, the book about a bioweapon that the Bregan's wrote gets sold because Malone added

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:21.060
them to his list too.

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:24.980
And so once you start to see that actually most of the people on the list are not bad

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:32.740
guys, but actually part of this controlled spectrum of debate, this very limited spectrum

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:38.380
of debate with fake adversaries, it starts to become very clear.

01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:43.380
Now why I have this person here is because Dr. Paul Cottrell actually became connected

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:47.380
to be very early in the pandemic as part of a group of people that wanted to stream with

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:49.980
me every weekend.

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.540
They were also part of team worst case scenario.

01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:56.620
Paul Cottrell never told me that he was working with George Webb, George Webb had me blocked

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.940
from the beginning of the pandemic.

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:05.660
So I would never make that connection between him and John Goodman and and and or Jason

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:08.260
Goodman and John Cullen.

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.700
I would never make the connection with Paul Cottrell back to Addy ads and all these other

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.820
people either.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:19.900
I would just think that Paul Cottrell was some kind of pseudo doctor on the internet

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.100
that I couldn't really figure out.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:28.740
But at least I had Mr. Dr. Kevin McCarran there to help me make sure that we wouldn't

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.620
let these no virus people get away with their with their nonsense and we wouldn't let any

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:35.980
of these 5G mythologies take off.

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:43.020
And we would stop this silver salesman Paul Cottrell while George Webb still says to this

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:48.380
day that one of the biggest heroes in the pandemic is Dr. Paul Cottrell even though

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:53.820
he knows Dr. Paul Cottrell is not a doctor.

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:59.460
He has a fake PhD in some kind of chaos theory.

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.500
It's a fake PhD.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:09.620
And if it's not a fake PhD in the sense of it's wholly made of of of of of of lies that

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:15.140
it's a fake PhD in the sense that nothing really significant was done in order to earn

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:18.700
this doctor of philosophy.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:24.540
And it certainly has nothing to do with medicine or biology even though he and George Webb

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:31.460
worked very hard to make sure that you would as easily as possible confuse him and think

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:38.820
that he was a medical doctor because they represented it that way all the time.

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:44.220
And so what an interesting closing of the loop here because Robert Malone actually

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:53.940
did a couple interviews on stream with Paul Cottrell in 2021 when he finally did pull out

01:41:53.940 --> 01:42:00.860
or pull up to the curb and say, Hey, I'm going to help you guys.

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:04.660
And so that's again why I think it's very important for you to see that I'm not trying

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:12.180
to make this about me but because of where I have stood because of where I have sat because

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:18.980
of who has contacted me when and the order in which they have denied me it has become

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:21.900
very obvious that all of these people are connected.

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:28.820
There's no possible way that three years after being on stream with Paul Cottrell where Paul

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.580
Cottrell was posing as a doctor telling us that Remdesivir would work telling us that

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:38.220
the worst case scenario red dragon event was happening that no less than 60 days was

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.020
needed for lockdown.

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.020
All of these crazy things to see the worst case scenario at the start of the pandemic

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:51.700
he was calling it a flying AIDS already back then along with Dr. Kevin McCarran who harassed

01:42:51.700 --> 01:43:02.940
me nonstop for four years as following me around like a clown car are all connected

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:07.460
because otherwise Robert Malone wouldn't have a year and a half later in 2021 gone

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:14.220
on a stream with Paul Cottrell hey already known fake doctor Jason Goodman called him

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:20.460
out as a fake doctor in 2020 everybody knew that he was a fake doctor in 2020 so why

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:30.380
in the world in 2021 would Robert Malone go on his podcast only later to turn around and

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:35.580
say that George Webb is a is one of the baddest baddies that he's got to deal with

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:44.860
on the web the ultimate harasser he's as much of a victim as this Machia Banasi apparently

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:50.660
George Webb just unleashed the same kind of ridiculousness on George Webb as he unleashed

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:57.620
on Machia Banasi at least that's what George that's what Robert Malone wants you to believe

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:05.020
please see how magically this little sub stack play gets you to accept that there was a

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:09.780
virus that there was something to argue about that there were medlers and that Robert Malone

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:18.940
is not one of them don't you see how terrible malevolent this this enchantment is and don't

01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:26.420
you see why I'm so passionately trying to break it because these people are known to me they

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:33.820
are known to me in a way which makes this glowingly incongruent there is no way that

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:37.940
all of these stories can be true there's no way that all of these people are telling

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:42.820
the truth there's no way that these people are not liars and I don't like to use the

01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:49.460
word because it's so accusatory but they have misled us about who they are they have misled

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:54.660
us about what their motivations are and they have misled us to ask the wrong questions

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:59.940
so that our children will be enslaved by these weaponized piles of money that are in

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:07.540
our are paying them with comfort and fame and promise of membership ladies and gentlemen

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:15.060
we have to wake up now this is not a joke there can be no other explanation for these

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:22.180
things that when you line them up the right way it's like bong wow that's pretty weird

01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:32.340
how that all just kind of lines up he has a following among the deep state phony conspiracy

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:40.900
crowd what has this meant to you I was looking over my shoulder a lot I was scared for my life

01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:47.940
you were taking all that seriously yes once my address was posted that that was it for me that

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:54.660
because they mean danger my family it was like 60 or 70 death threats over the span of you know

01:45:54.660 --> 01:46:01.620
four or five weeks they called the police and the FBI which got them nowhere and the reason why

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:07.380
the FBI and the police don't want to talk to you is because even though we're receiving death threats

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.540
they didn't say we're coming to the Benazis to kill them tonight they need a crime to have been

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:15.940
committed that's correct and you're trying to prevent a crime from being committed absolutely

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:23.060
right about now you might be thinking they should sue but that's the problem they can't file

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:30.100
hundreds of lawsuits against internet trolls hiding behind aliases and they can't sue the internet

01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:35.140
platforms now would you find it remarkable that after they explain to you that you can't sue the

01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:41.220
internet platforms because of this act 230 or whatever that makes it impossible for people to

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:45.060
sue the platforms because the platforms aren't liable for what people post on them

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.340
that they're also going to reinforce the sandy hook

01:46:52.660 --> 01:47:02.020
shooting in this story so they're going to bring someone on who who has a son who died at sandy

01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:11.940
hook and they're going to use his his his example of internet lies and the pain that they cause

01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:19.700
and the fights that you have to engage in in order to fight against them to show you a parallel

01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:26.340
between this and what happened between Benazis and Webb and they're going to bring out another

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:34.260
parallel after that of a news reporter who was killed live on air and then that video was

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:40.180
reposted to youtube hundreds of times and they couldn't ever get it removed and the dad really

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:47.700
felt like it's just lame that these these internet platforms have no ability to control their platform

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:53.860
they can't censor bad things and it's just lame that we don't have more control over them at the

01:47:53.860 --> 01:48:01.300
beginning of the pandemic and so behind the scenes they can point to this CBS news

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:08.180
60 minute special report and say see the internet's really out of control we got these people

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:13.780
claiming that there's some kind of lab leak that was planted in a bicycle we got these people saying

01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:20.020
that sandy hook didn't happen we got these people who are reposting these borderline snuff videos

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:25.460
and none of these platforms seemed to want to do anything and now we are at the doorstep

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:31.300
of an impending pandemic we need to send some people over to those places with suits on

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:37.540
and make sure that these these internet platforms are under control so that this misinformation

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:45.860
is not a part of of the disaster that could be the pandemic it's the perfect video to play at

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:51.700
the beginning of the pandemic that also just happens to put in place a couple key trolls

01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:02.900
it seeds a couple key narratives albeit in a very absurd way but it already ceded the narrative

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:09.540
in the most mainstream skilled tv watchers that wait what they release something what does that

01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:14.660
even mean can you release a virus that seems strange if you released a virus that you could put in

01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:21.380
vials inside of a bicycle bicycle frame could it pandemic all of those questions were asked

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:25.780
and answered in the last three minutes that we just watched

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:29.700
whether you like it or not

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:39.380
and people as sophisticated as a cashier at the grocery store all the way up to somebody

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:47.700
as sophisticated as a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh could be fooled by this

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:55.300
elaborate of an operation this elaborate of a messaging scheme and I was

01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:04.660
in most of us were and so we need to talk about it so that other people can see it

01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:09.940
so that other people see that we're not claiming to have always seen through it and I know that

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.300
there are people out there that had saw through it from the very beginning I know there were

01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:19.940
but even the people that could see through it from the very beginning were insufficient at

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:25.460
articulating what exactly was going on what exactly was so incongruent that we needed to stop believing

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:25.780
them

01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:32.740
and some of those people were purposefully

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:40.900
unable to articulate the reason why we shouldn't believe in these people and still saying partial

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.340
truths that's the whole trick

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:53.060
so you can't say that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread or the whole illusion vanishes

01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:59.220
you can't do this this this math or the whole illusion vanishes Robin Malone's never going to

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:04.340
talk about Remdesivir and how many people had killed just like George Webb is never going

01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.980
to talk about Remdesivir and how many people it killed

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.980
just like George Webb's not going to talk about Madaz Lam and how many people had killed in the

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:18.020
UK and Robert Malone's not going to talk about it either Paul Cottrell's not going to talk about

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:23.940
the lack of antibiotic use in 2020 and 2021 just like Robert Malone's not going to talk about it

01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:30.100
George Webb's not going to talk about the do not resuscitate orders that Jessica Hockett has

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:35.860
found in New York City and Robert Malone's not going to talk about Jessica Hockett's data in

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:42.500
New York City and neither is Paul Cottrell because they're all on the same team the worst case scenario

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:50.340
team that keeps the virus narrative alive so we don't talk about the the raw costs of Medicare

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:55.940
and how much we've avoided how convenient it is that we're now testing all these new

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:03.140
transfections and these new genetic vaccines out on all of these new diseases on all of these

01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:09.220
old people under the pretense that they're vulnerable while there's still no talk of strict liability

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:15.380
Robert Malone's never going to say the word strict liability that's like the the the garlic to his

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:22.740
vampire that's like the kryptonite to his Superman are you kidding me strict liability would would

01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:34.580
end the industry that he has risen from to talk about the CICP and the VICP as a as a seventh

01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:41.540
amendment violation of all of the conservative essays that Robert Malone puts out 17 pages a

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:47.860
day sometimes twice that much he's never going to write a a conservative essay about the seventh

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:52.900
amendment and what role it should play in our interactions with pharmaceutical companies he's

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:57.300
never ever going to write that essay don't you see

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.020
somebody from CHD might

01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:10.660
so we know how it was created it was created with this worst case scenario team and this

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:15.140
control of the narrative under a national security priority

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:21.380
so that the toxicity of the virus and the toxicity of transfection could be confounded with this

01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:27.780
mythology and that is the new world order that they want our children to grow up in and they will if

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:38.500
we allow this lie to fade away and become the truth they are trying to break us they are trying to

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:46.100
break us for a generation so that there will be a blip break they want that because they want

01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:54.660
the fabric of the West America and Europe to break so that they can replace it with a mythology

01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:03.780
place it with a digital prison that's what this really is all about the virus and the vaccine

01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:10.500
schedule are all part of this slippery slope that have led us to the eventual digital id

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:16.660
and digital currency digital prison all part of a long-standing plan to chip you

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:23.860
make no mistake about it ladies and gentlemen that's where we're headed chipping our children

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:30.980
maybe you're maybe your laptop in your in your and your computer will have a scanner for the

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:36.580
chip too so then your digital id can be the chip that's what they're doing to us that's

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.700
what they're erasing that's the train that they've got us on from the very beginning when they

01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:46.420
scared us from the very beginning with this lab leak narrative with this scooby-doo mystery

01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:51.380
they scared us to getting on this train and when you got on the train you accepted the fact that

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:56.820
vaccination was a strategy that we had used in the past to defeat pandemics and therefore

01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:02.660
adopting that strategy again wasn't crazy you have accepted that novel coronavirus is

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:10.500
jump you heard you heard Bret Weinstein say it to Lex Fridman yesterday that yes they do jump

01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:17.140
false positives for PCR are rare that asymptomatic spread happens we've heard

01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:23.540
Heather and Bret talk about it for months and months and years and years variants are evidence

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:28.900
of spread they've also talked about that relentlessly not that they could be part of an ever expanding

01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:34.900
background of bs but that they are evidence of spread and finally that we spend money on

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:39.860
gain and function research so we better argue about it these are all agreed on things in this

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:43.540
faith that Bret Weinstein is a high priest up

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.820
and these people George Webb Robert Malone Paul Catrell are never going to talk about

01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:57.380
how RNA replicates in the wild they're never going to talk about this

01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:05.220
pretty useful analogy between an analog tape and a CD where the digital copy can be copied with

01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:10.180
much higher fidelity and therefore is much easier to share with your coworkers and with your fellow

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:19.460
researchers and RNA viruses are the analog tape RNA viruses can't copy themselves

01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:22.900
and that's why they're very hard to culture

01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:24.820
Robert Malone's never going to explain this

01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:32.660
Robert Malone has spent four years avoiding telling us anything useful about viruses and

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:38.980
a couple times he has screwed up have been touchdowns for me especially that video where he says that

01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.540
the vast majority of viral particles are replication competent they don't do anything just float around

01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:48.820
they do nothing interactive the immune system but they can't copy themselves because they're

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:51.860
an incomplete genome they've got errors they're missing genes

01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:59.540
because RNA doesn't copy itself that way so this is not a hijacking of our system

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:05.540
but it's the use of an existing one at best and the only way that we can study it is by not

01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:12.820
using these RNA by culturing them but by converting them to a DNA that can be fairly

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:21.860
high fidelity replicated in cell culture or rather bacterial culture very standard molecular

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:28.260
biological techniques using plasmids where each plasmid is replicated in its own bacterial culture

01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:33.380
and then they can be joined through ligation methods which we think we may have seen evidence

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:39.300
for in the sequence purported to be found in Wuhan which doesn't indicate so much that it was a

01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:44.980
laboratory virus as much as it indicates that it was man-made which can only be one thing

01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:52.020
an infectious clone after ligation of these DNA that you can add an RNA polymerase and

01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:58.740
you can convert it to RNA and then that RNA will appear to be infectious and replication competent

01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:05.140
for a time on cell culture will appear to be infectious if injected into the nasal cavity of

01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:12.020
an animal and it will appear to do those same things in other people's laboratories if you send it to them

01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:23.220
and so RNA isn't grown in a dish it is grown first as DNA in the form of it and then made into

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:29.060
what they call infectious RNA clones and you could do that at scale just like they made

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:34.500
the RNA shots at scale which means that if you wanted to get this in a lot of places around the

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:39.460
world and then claim it was evidence of spread there's a real easy way they could have done it

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:46.580
and they've been doing this process for decades that's how coronavirus biology is done

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:53.700
and i believe that the no-virus people were part of obfuscating this very simple fact

01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:02.820
and that's why we were stuck with this this narrative for so long why it was so hard to break

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:10.420
out of it because no virus position was meant to be and made to be ridiculous instead of logical

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:20.500
but there was no pandemic virus these these tests are not evidence of a novel virus spreading

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:25.460
around we don't have evidence that seven million people were killed by a new RNA

01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:32.340
those seven million people were killed by dumb protocols and dumb drugs applied

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:41.540
in dumb ways with dumb assumptions but we want to be led to believe that thank heaven

01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:46.020
transfection work better than we thought that's the illusion the five years now we're on the

01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:51.140
fifth year don't underestimate how important it is to point that out to your family and friends

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:55.060
that you're trying to wake up the faith is a lie that's for sure

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:04.260
so the way out is biology we need to advocate a pause on all childhood vaccine schedule in the

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:10.580
united states you can hear when people say that that they are good people call for strict liability

02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:16.500
we call for an investigation into these smash casualty events that people like Jonathan Engler

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:23.300
and Martin Niel and Jessica Hockett are investigating and have delineated for us we need to reclaim

02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:29.140
sovereignty over our children's bodies and our own and we need to get ourselves out of the who

02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:35.460
make the who disappear make our cdc disappear if you want to see the medlers they don't advocate

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.940
against the childhood vaccine schedule in america as the fraud that it is they don't advocate for

02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:46.260
strict liability they rarely are if ever cite the deadly protocols as being the primary cause

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:55.860
of death rarely if ever just go down that huge list of those people rarely if ever do they talk

02:00:55.860 --> 02:01:03.060
about the fact that iatrogenic death is the primary means where people left the world not a novel

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.900
virus they don't use the word transfection until very recently and then when they did they still

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:15.460
don't really use it in the humble way that they should they don't use the word clone to summarize

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:20.100
anything they don't use the word swarm they attack people rather than ideas and they whine

02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:26.740
about their own censorship even as they rise and most importantly you can see them because they

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:35.140
can't summarize across the whole show they've never bothered to try unlike me and a few other

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:41.700
people who have been trying to do it for four years ladies and gentlemen they are doing this

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:45.780
because they want to convert us to a different form of rule a different form of governance

02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:50.340
so they can collect our data and feed it to an ai that doesn't even exist under the pretense in

02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:55.460
the faith that it will eventually allow the transhuman futurists to come true

02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:05.220
if you believe in the sacred biology the the irreducible complexity that is the beauty of

02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:10.100
biology like i do if you have the common sense that your grandmother gave you

02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:14.340
then you know that this artificial general intelligence is going to solve squat

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:20.740
ladies and gentlemen please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate

02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:28.580
the control group by any means necessary it has been fun tonight it has been real i hope it has

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:37.780
been real fun for you um this has been giggle and biological where intramuscular injection by any

02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:42.580
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:46.980
transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned

02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:53.460
integrity thanks very much for joining me guys um trying to keep the energy a little higher

02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:58.580
trying to keep the positivity a little higher it doesn't always work um because this is uh

02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:04.500
it's kind of becoming a feeling like a rock and a hard place here and so i've got to ask you once

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:10.100
again like i did in the beginning to share my work as far and as wide as possible and if you

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:16.500
can't afford to please support it in some way financially that includes just one-time donations

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:23.140
as little as one dollar is great um but also uh the subscribers would be great and you could

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:30.260
scroll down at giggleandbiological.com and become a subscriber for either $10 a month um i think

02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:36.500
another one is some kind of every three months and then once is once a year um and if i could get

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:42.900
a thousand subscribers i think um we could be building maybe really the best science news

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:50.100
independent science news source on the internet um and i think that should be our goal i think

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:58.420
it's a worthy goal um and i think uh i think i've earned a chance of that and so i'm hoping that

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:05.380
over the next couple months um uh i can make that that a reality and i hope that these people will

02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:10.980
continue to support me continue to share my work and that you will um so that we can get this list

02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:18.660
long enough so that we can be unstoppable um right now we're still pretty stoppable um and so uh

02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:24.660
yeah thanks to everybody who has had the guts to stick their neck out up until now for me and for

02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:30.740
my family um and i i hope that we can get more people on board thank you very much for joining

02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:38.820
me and i will see you again very soon um in fact i guess i'll see you again tomorrow thanks

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:54.180
i don't have a subscribe tab on twitch because i don't want to give any money to this platform
