01:30.000 --> 01:55.920
What did you think, Christy? Was it a good video? Was it worth your time? I really, I

01:55.920 --> 02:03.120
kind of like the way Greg works through it. It's a hard sell, so it's a tough

02:03.120 --> 02:09.000
subject to put through in 40 minutes. I'm really curious what you thought.

02:25.920 --> 02:55.880
You're scheduled for 60 minutes.

02:55.880 --> 03:04.240
What's next? It's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere

03:04.240 --> 03:09.640
are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

03:15.080 --> 03:20.720
Hey, listen to this gang. Teenage sleuths solved bone hijacking mystery. Captain Cutler

03:20.720 --> 03:26.400
and his wife take it into custody by sure. That was some plan they had. First spreading

03:26.400 --> 03:32.240
the phony story about Cutler and then stealing the yachts from the marina. That night on

03:32.240 --> 03:37.080
the beach, Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of the ship. Yeah, but

03:37.080 --> 03:44.920
like his diving suit got covered with that kooky glowing seaweed. And that's where the

03:44.920 --> 03:58.680
glowing ghost story came from. Well, that clothes is the mystery. How did Scooby do with that?

03:58.680 --> 04:01.080
I guess that's another mystery.

04:19.880 --> 04:24.840
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Giggle and biological. A high resistance low noise

04:24.840 --> 04:35.640
information brief brought to you by a biologist. It's the 21st of September, 2023. So I'm gonna

04:35.640 --> 04:44.000
be peeking out my mic a little bit and turn myself down. Maybe get some music. I don't know what's going on here.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Gotta speed this up now. Yeah, so tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Eastern time, you can watch on CHD TV.

04:53.400 --> 05:01.800
My podcast with Brian Hooker. I think it's gonna be a really neat one. I think it turned out okay.

05:02.520 --> 05:08.040
I hope it turned out all right. But at 10 a.m. tomorrow, you can see that on CHD TV.

05:11.080 --> 05:18.920
I got a really other kind of excellent thing to announce today, which I think is really pretty cool.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.760
I don't know where it's gonna go, but we're gonna find out right now.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.640
Yes, that's how it's supposed to go. Just a little bit earlier, maybe would be better. But,

05:35.640 --> 05:40.520
you know, it's too bad. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Giggle and biological.

05:40.520 --> 05:45.720
A high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist. My name is Jonathan

05:45.720 --> 05:51.960
Cooey. I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Greetings to all of you. And thank

05:51.960 --> 05:57.160
you for joining me. The scroll up and above there are the people that are supporting this stream.

05:57.160 --> 06:04.520
Some of them have been supporting me for as long as two or three years. And so, it's taken me a

06:04.520 --> 06:08.680
while to figure out how I wanted to do it. But I think it's just best kind of to have them on

06:08.680 --> 06:13.800
screen most of the time. You can always turn it off later. Again, like I just wanted to say,

06:14.440 --> 06:19.960
I mentioned in the intro, there's going to be a 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.

06:22.120 --> 06:28.760
You can watch me be interviewed by Dr. Brian Hooker on CHD TV. I think his show is called

06:28.760 --> 06:38.200
Doctors and Scientists. I guess doctors, scientists and podcasters now. But yeah, it was a neat talk.

06:38.200 --> 06:44.280
It was fun because he let me talk in very broad strokes. I got to draw a picture.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.400
And the people that listened to it thought it was pretty good. So I hope it comes out all right.

06:49.400 --> 06:55.000
It's a broad discussion about all the reasons why Transfection is in a good idea. And then on

06:55.000 --> 07:00.840
top of that, why this particular version of Transfection isn't a very good idea.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.880
And so that's, of course, our message for the last few weeks now or the last few months now.

07:07.880 --> 07:13.640
We've been trying to say it over and over again, that I think what has happened as a result of

07:13.640 --> 07:18.920
our exploration of this immunology, our deep dive into this immunology over the last three years

07:19.880 --> 07:26.920
has made me pretty confident in saying that I think it's not about vaccines, you know,

07:27.560 --> 07:32.280
what it is is this idea that we can augment the immune system by injecting a combination of

07:32.280 --> 07:38.680
substances into our muscle. It's just a dumb idea. And I don't know how we really got there.

07:38.680 --> 07:44.200
I don't know if we need to really figure that out. I just think we need to come to a conclusion

07:45.080 --> 07:51.160
that we should have come to probably a long time ago, which is that the,

07:53.160 --> 07:57.880
is there a little black edge to the? Yeah, there sure is.

07:58.360 --> 08:03.960
Um, that we should have come to this conclusion quite some time ago and we don't know really why

08:03.960 --> 08:12.280
we haven't. But it might be because of the way this kind of therapeutic class is protected both

08:12.280 --> 08:19.800
legally and culturally in our Western society. But we really need to wake up and apologize to

08:19.880 --> 08:28.200
our children for having, um, sort of abdicated this responsibility. I want to point you back

08:28.200 --> 08:31.720
one more time. I guess I should have taken this slide out, but I'm going to do it anyway. I

08:31.720 --> 08:37.080
want to point you back one more time to this twiv episode because the twiv episode that I did

08:37.080 --> 08:43.560
a few days ago discusses how neutralizing antibodies aren't necessary for a guinea pig model of

08:44.040 --> 08:50.360
viral immunity. And more importantly, in this podcast, they talked very specifically about the

08:50.360 --> 08:57.960
three dimensional epitopes and the, the idea that the sequence of the protein is not really as

08:57.960 --> 09:03.000
important as the three dimensional folding. And that's called a quaternary epitope. And that

09:03.000 --> 09:09.640
discussion is really enlightening because it gets you a much better idea of the breadth and the depth

09:09.640 --> 09:14.200
of the oversimplification that they've done with regards to trying to tell you that antibodies

09:14.840 --> 09:23.080
to a spike protein are somehow vital to your survival of a coronavirus infection. And then they go on

09:23.080 --> 09:28.920
to talk about a second paper, which is basically CRISPR and RNA viruses, but they kind of skirt

09:28.920 --> 09:33.560
around the idea that they need pure RNA to do this and that pure RNA is really the only way they

09:33.560 --> 09:45.640
can do any of this RNA virology. So I think it's okay probably to, to pan over here.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.720
These people have changed the way that we think about stuff. And specifically, they've changed

09:53.720 --> 09:58.760
the way we think about respiratory disease, our immune response to it all caused mortality and

09:58.760 --> 10:04.520
where it comes from and how much of it there is and what vaccination is and how, you know,

10:04.520 --> 10:08.200
intramuscular injection of stuff has worked before. Why won't it work now?

10:11.640 --> 10:20.200
And this ridiculous change in immunology 101 and this ridiculous, overbearing fear, confusion,

10:20.200 --> 10:31.400
uncertainty and doubt allowed them to push school boards and town councils and daycare centers

10:31.400 --> 10:37.880
and everybody to think that these kinds of things were a good idea and top down hospital

10:37.880 --> 10:45.400
administration driven by the CARES Act drove this, you know, directive of as long as you follow

10:45.400 --> 10:50.200
the orders of the CDC, we can't be blamed for anything that happens. So if you want to keep your

10:50.200 --> 10:58.360
job here, you're going to follow the directives of the CDC, which included remdesivir in America,

10:58.360 --> 11:05.320
Madazolem in the UK. And generally speaking, three pills were just dropped off of the charts of

11:05.320 --> 11:12.440
being used. And these end up being some of the most effective treatments antibiotics for secondary

11:12.440 --> 11:20.680
pneumonia. And the way that they've gotten away with this is that they've controlled the spectrum

11:20.680 --> 11:27.080
of the narrative. And I think it's very important for everybody who's now just joining the stream

11:27.080 --> 11:33.160
for the first time or has been joining me every night for the last 14 or 15 nights. We've got

11:33.880 --> 11:40.840
to think carefully about how every one of the steps that we were led through is likely a part

11:40.840 --> 11:48.040
of this controlled narrative. Hydroxychloroquine was played in a certain way in 2020 and has never

11:49.080 --> 11:59.400
made its way back into the conversation. Hydroxychloroquine was the solution that the United

11:59.400 --> 12:08.760
States government stuck 20,000 pills of in 2020. Hydroxychloroquine was the end point drug for which

12:08.760 --> 12:15.320
several precursor factories, factories that made precursor drugs for hydroxychloroquine or

12:16.040 --> 12:25.800
finished hydroxychloroquine. Am I saying it right? Yeah. They were burned in 2020. So

12:25.800 --> 12:33.400
Ivermectin factories didn't burn in 2020, but hydroxychloroquine factories did. The United States

12:33.400 --> 12:39.240
government did not stock up on Ivermectin pills. They stocked up on hydroxychloroquine pills.

12:40.280 --> 12:48.200
The late Zevzalenko who treated more than 200 people in Congress used hydroxychloroquine and zinc.

12:51.800 --> 12:57.320
And so this is a big deal because it's never come back into the discussion because why?

12:57.800 --> 13:04.760
Because the discussion has been very carefully curated by people like Brett Weinstein who pushed

13:04.760 --> 13:14.120
Ivermectin as one of the three ways that strangers could hang out together in June of 2021. You could

13:14.120 --> 13:21.240
be vaccinated and infected like my friend Robert Malone or you could be double vaccinated like

13:21.240 --> 13:30.360
my friend Steve Kirsch or you could use smart prophylaxis like me, Brett Weinstein and take

13:30.360 --> 13:40.920
Ivermectin. And so I find it very curious that hydroxychloroquine the only substance that has a

13:40.920 --> 13:50.680
paper in 2005 which is specifically looking at in vitro inhibition of coronavirus uptake in cell

13:50.680 --> 13:59.080
culture. The only drug that showed any promise the only drug actually that Tony Fauci himself is

13:59.080 --> 14:08.120
actually on videotape probably not videotape but video recording saying that hydroxychloroquine

14:08.120 --> 14:18.840
is a drug that shows promise for combating SARS viruses and it's not in the conversation anymore

14:19.480 --> 14:26.440
but there are books being written about Ivermectin. Why is that ladies and gentlemen do you think

14:26.440 --> 14:34.520
that's real? I don't think that's real and I'm trying very hard to dive into that I'm going to

14:34.520 --> 14:42.200
bring some more ammunition to that fire as we go along but for now I just wanted to preface that

14:42.200 --> 14:47.000
thought tonight to make sure that your wheels are still thinking you're still looking back

14:47.000 --> 14:53.880
while your memory is still sharp enough to remember it because if we let them keep rushing

14:53.880 --> 15:00.040
us into the future and distracting us with all kinds of other things we're going to forget about

15:00.040 --> 15:09.000
2020 when everybody was doing the most lying when everybody was doing the most lying

15:09.160 --> 15:17.480
or let's say the most look-away doctrine I don't know I ain't looking there

15:21.720 --> 15:27.240
don't let them let you forget you have to remember the only way we're going to get out of this is

15:27.240 --> 15:37.240
an accurate history of what happened in 2020 and 2021 it's the only way they lied to us about this

15:37.320 --> 15:42.200
stuff in order to swap our rights around and I think some of these people

15:42.920 --> 15:49.960
wittingly or unwittingly are involved in this lie and if we look carefully back at 2020 I believe

15:49.960 --> 15:57.000
that we can see and when we can see then we can see our way out we can show other people the way

15:57.000 --> 16:06.280
out because that's where the light is as crazy as it sounds we've got to look at 2020 and 2021 if

16:06.280 --> 16:13.560
we're going to find how this narrative trap was created and I think we have to look back at the

16:13.560 --> 16:17.720
people who have been telling us the story over and over again who have been falsely

16:18.760 --> 16:24.360
falsely censored you know like Russell Brand is being censored right now so censored that

16:24.360 --> 16:30.360
everybody on the internet is talking about it so censored that Jimmy Dorr has five different little

16:30.360 --> 16:36.520
shorts about it so censored that he's going to go on everybody's podcast and talk about it now

16:36.520 --> 16:44.040
wow so YouTube's not paying you anymore must be rough it sounds like the same game they played with

16:44.760 --> 16:52.120
with Brett Weinstein when Robert Malone was on his podcast it's not really censorship

16:52.120 --> 16:58.280
if it gets you more popular it's not really censorship if it funnels all of your people

16:58.920 --> 17:05.800
into your subscribership it's not really censorship if everybody in the world starts talking about it

17:07.400 --> 17:13.640
then it's more like the opposite of censorship it's promotion no publicity's bad publicity ladies and

17:13.640 --> 17:20.360
gentlemen and so these people you know we've been talking about all these people and so I thought

17:20.360 --> 17:26.680
for our for our throwback Thursday we would go back to a couple people that we know

17:27.480 --> 17:32.360
and I thought you might find it curious that of all the people that Robert Malone has done a

17:32.360 --> 17:39.080
podcast with would you find it surprising that he's done a podcast with Paul Catrell in 2021

17:39.080 --> 17:44.280
about a month after he was on the Brett Weinstein podcast

17:46.760 --> 17:54.280
that's a little interesting isn't it the extremely fake MD from New York City the guy that was running

17:55.240 --> 18:00.840
or trading for years before that he lived like once block away from Wall Street

18:01.400 --> 18:08.200
but supposedly according to the very reliable and highly trustworthy George Webb he was traveling

18:08.200 --> 18:17.080
back and forth to Harvard on a bus to do med school actually it's biology before you go to med

18:17.080 --> 18:21.960
school but I'll repeat med school med school med school med school it's actually the biology

18:21.960 --> 18:30.200
program that you do before med school but but Dr. Paul Catrell who did chaos theory and in

18:30.200 --> 18:38.680
equities trading that's his PhD and that's the guy that Robert Malone decided to do a podcast with

18:39.400 --> 18:47.240
would you find that at all curious would you find it at all curious if Robert Malone in 2021

18:48.200 --> 18:51.640
had done a podcast with Paul Catrell

18:54.440 --> 19:03.080
Paul Catrell bus Dr. MD George Webb's most trusted scientific advisor

19:04.760 --> 19:12.600
and incidentally remember that George Webb is listed in Robert Malone's worst cyberstalkers

19:12.680 --> 19:20.680
where Robert Malone conveniently links to George Webb's appearance on 60 minutes in 2020

19:22.200 --> 19:28.840
I mean it's almost like a laughable joke but I have to watch the video and you have to watch

19:28.840 --> 19:35.240
the video so that you understand that this isn't a joke not when all the videos are still on YouTube

19:36.040 --> 19:44.920
it's evidence it's evidence in plain sight that we are being played by a group of people

19:44.920 --> 19:52.200
who has ulterior motives that I don't know what they are but they're not the well-being of the

19:52.200 --> 19:59.320
conservative wing of the United States I'll tell you that much who ha let's see if we can find

19:59.400 --> 20:06.120
these futurists here I'm going to escape from this for a minute there he is look at that guy

20:06.840 --> 20:09.400
I think he was thinner back then in 2021

20:10.840 --> 20:17.800
after 9-11 I've worked with virtually all of the nature and it does start like that so I apologize

20:17.800 --> 20:24.440
but it starts with N9-11 so I'm not really sure what they cut out there but Dr. Paul Catrell is there

20:25.080 --> 20:28.200
and then the global enlightenment radio network is what you see

20:29.160 --> 20:35.800
vaccine candidates for bio-defense purposes I was at the tip of the spear in in bringing

20:36.360 --> 20:42.360
the public health agency Canada vaccine forward that we now call the Merck Ebola vaccine I got

20:42.360 --> 20:48.200
Merck involved and I got the money from the Norwegian government that funded the ring vaccination trials

20:48.840 --> 20:56.440
and then I have also been right at the forefront of drug repurposing for first for Zika there's a

20:56.440 --> 21:05.560
number of papers relating to Zika and Zika pathogenesis and drug repurposing started a company that went

21:05.560 --> 21:11.560
bankrupt I've done I think four different startups in my life and because there was no funding for

21:11.560 --> 21:17.400
drug repurposing and then since the beginning of this outbreak I got a call from a

21:18.840 --> 21:24.520
and remember the intelligence community that was in Wuhan that I've published with in the past

21:25.480 --> 21:33.240
was in Wuhan during the fourth quarter of 2019 and he called me on January 4th of 2020 and

21:33.240 --> 21:39.720
told me that I need to get my team spun up because this new pathogen so we started working on

21:40.280 --> 21:49.000
computational screening and docking of entire library of licensed drugs and that eventually

21:49.000 --> 21:56.280
led to my self administering some of those when I okay so he said computational screening he didn't

21:56.280 --> 22:03.400
say he didn't say that he made a model of x-ray crystallography he said something about docking

22:04.360 --> 22:10.920
but that could be an x-ray crystallography model of proteins and then docking them

22:12.520 --> 22:18.840
but it's not clear if he ran all the known pharmaceuticals through this x-ray crystallography

22:18.840 --> 22:26.280
modeling program and then tried to dock them with the three cl protease but anyway he describes

22:26.280 --> 22:31.560
it differently every time this is a 2021 description so maybe he's pretty

22:32.520 --> 22:39.960
it became infected with the biogen outbreak at the end of February 2020 and that led to the

22:39.960 --> 22:47.640
discovery of femotidine or pepcid I wrote the north well contract for that together with Jim

22:47.640 --> 22:53.240
Talton on north well screwed up those trials but we've carried on I've got multiple papers

22:53.240 --> 22:57.160
published or impressed involving femotidine and then the combination of femotidine and

22:57.240 --> 23:03.880
cellicoxid and it's taken the first of those papers was uploaded in July of 2020 it's been

23:03.880 --> 23:07.560
through peer review three times and still not been published it's been approved in peer review

23:07.560 --> 23:13.000
three times and then pulled by the editors of frontiers at the last minute just like Pierre

23:13.000 --> 23:18.200
Corey's paper was but those those are the trials that we finally have FDA clearance to proceed on

23:18.760 --> 23:24.200
so I'm one of not very many people that understand this whole spectrum of vaccines

23:24.200 --> 23:32.040
pandemics drug repurposing pharmacology and molecular virology so there's a new drug that is

23:32.040 --> 23:36.600
in clinical trials three I believe it's called I mean you're pronouncing wrong but

23:37.480 --> 23:42.680
malnew pyro kind of talking about the Merck product yeah yeah yeah it's originally called

23:42.680 --> 23:48.040
the IDD 2801 it was initially funded by the crew that I work with at the defense threat reduction

23:48.040 --> 23:54.520
agency we tried to get it in as part of the formulations we freezing a multi drug approach

23:55.080 --> 23:59.240
and we wanted to include it as so I think that's kind of interesting because it's kind of rare

23:59.240 --> 24:07.480
that he mentions ditra and here he mentions it right away the team that I work with I'm just

24:07.480 --> 24:14.360
gonna spool it back so we can hear that that seems to be missing from recent talks yeah yeah it's

24:14.360 --> 24:19.720
originally called the IDD 2801 it was initially funded by the crew that I work with at defense

24:19.720 --> 24:26.440
threat reduction agency we tried to get it in as part of the formulations we freezing a multi drug

24:26.440 --> 24:31.080
approach and we wanted to include it as the antiviral in our in our combination the other

24:31.080 --> 24:37.240
agents are anti-inflammatories but Merck acquired it from Ridgeback the same character that I was

24:37.240 --> 24:42.840
just referring to that works for the three letter agencies used to report to the assistant secretary

24:42.840 --> 24:51.720
for preparedness and defense Bob Cadillac he helped broker the Merck deal so yeah EIDD 2801

24:51.720 --> 24:58.440
there are so the the name it has to do with the Emory drug discovery group Ration Aussies a famous

24:58.440 --> 25:03.880
member of that so that's the origin of the original acronym and there are others at Emory that feel

25:03.880 --> 25:08.280
that this is a highly inappropriate compound to be advancing because of potential reproductive

25:08.280 --> 25:12.760
toxicology issues that they're concerned about we'll see how that bears there's also so this

25:12.840 --> 25:17.640
is this is one of the new hopes for direct acting antiviral the other one is the Pfizer

25:18.440 --> 25:23.640
three seal protease inhibitor so when Tony Fauci kind of did his great pivot two weeks ago and

25:23.640 --> 25:27.880
suddenly started talking about well we need drugs that we can administer early and turn

25:27.880 --> 25:32.440
cob it into something like the common cold he was only really thinking about these two agents and

25:33.320 --> 25:40.040
he he has no enthusiasm for repurposed drug um at the DOD fortunately we're entirely separate

25:40.040 --> 25:47.080
from Dr. Fauci's control and oversight and so we're able to pursue the science that we see

25:47.080 --> 25:52.280
as most appropriate and we've been focusing on drug repurposing as I okay um is anyone else

25:52.280 --> 25:55.960
hearing this I think I have to scroll it back again I mean this is a real

25:56.440 --> 26:00.440
uh

26:05.480 --> 26:16.440
what is he doing did he just say we the DOD and we several times the DOD and we did you hear it

26:16.440 --> 26:22.200
remember Katherine Watt and a bunch of other people said that the DOD is doing this

26:22.520 --> 26:30.280
remember that Sasha latipova said hey you know the DOD is doing all of this it's the DOD

26:33.640 --> 26:39.240
what did he just say listen carefully because this is vital to understanding how this story has

26:39.240 --> 26:45.720
evolved see how that fares there's also so this is this is one of the new hopes for direct acting

26:45.720 --> 26:51.400
antiviral the other one is the Pfizer uh three seal protease inhibitor so when Tony Fauci

26:51.400 --> 26:56.040
kind of did his great pivot two weeks ago and suddenly started talking about well we need drugs

26:56.040 --> 27:00.760
that we can administer early and turn and cob it into something like the common cold he was only

27:00.760 --> 27:06.680
really thinking about these two agents and uh he he has no enthusiasm for repurposed drug um

27:07.400 --> 27:11.720
at the DOD fortunately we're entirely separate from uh Dr. Fauci's control

27:11.720 --> 27:26.600
and oversight and so we're able to pursue the science that we see as most appropriate

27:34.200 --> 27:38.600
and we've been focusing on drug repurposing as I said from the beginning of the of 2020

27:39.080 --> 27:45.240
and uh we actually uh in the trials we had designed a three-arm outpatient trial that would be placebo

27:45.240 --> 27:51.320
versus silicoxib and formatidine versus silicoxib formatidine and ivermectin but the FDA created

27:51.320 --> 27:56.840
such a storm with their objections to including ivermectin they put clauses in there that were

27:56.840 --> 28:01.640
so intenable would have taken us six months to a year to satisfy them so we just drop the ivermectin

28:01.640 --> 28:07.240
arm but the data suggests that the triple combination is really potent and and surprisingly the

28:07.320 --> 28:12.680
addition of so we've been very laboratory focused in terms of so the formatidine and silicoxib

28:12.680 --> 28:18.120
combination even in certainly in outpatients but in inpatients we can see uh a point of

28:18.120 --> 28:22.680
inflection in a lot of the key labs uh that are predictive of outcomes of cob it when we start

28:22.680 --> 28:29.480
administering drug it's quite striking we we now can manage cob it um using classical laboratory

28:29.480 --> 28:33.480
assays and make decisions about clinical management one of the things that was intriguing about the

28:33.480 --> 28:38.360
addition those with ivermectin is that we saw much more rapid improvement of leukocyte

28:38.360 --> 28:45.800
fraction um in the cbc parents uh and uh it it appears that there is some benefit in terms of

28:45.800 --> 28:52.600
lymphocyte recovery and uh but then there's the recent data out of israel that that i had thought

28:52.600 --> 28:56.600
was was not going to be forthcoming there's long been speculation that ivermectin might have

28:56.600 --> 29:01.240
some direct acting anti-viral activity and and the new israeli double-blame randomized clinical

29:01.240 --> 29:06.360
trial with only 55 i think is right around 50 or 60 patients its statistical significance

29:06.920 --> 29:13.320
um and demonstrated that there is an antiviral component to the ivermectin activity so uh you

29:13.320 --> 29:17.160
know i we'll we'll be testing uh for monidine and silicoxib because that's what we could get

29:17.160 --> 29:22.440
through the fda and that took us three months of negotiation uh but uh i suspect that in the end

29:22.440 --> 29:27.800
people will find that the triple might be even more useful there so for three months

29:28.520 --> 29:34.680
robert malone was in negotiation for trials for combinations of

29:34.680 --> 29:41.720
femotidine silicoxib ivermectin and then he dropped ivermectin and it's these three other ones

29:43.160 --> 29:51.960
for at least three months so that would be what january february march february march april

29:52.600 --> 29:59.560
something like that and already by april i was saying natural immunity and we didn't need

29:59.560 --> 30:03.720
to shut down and i think we're we're exaggerating and what's going on

30:06.680 --> 30:10.680
maybe we shouldn't be ventilating everybody and i'm not an md but it seems like that's what

30:10.680 --> 30:15.800
everybody's complaining about and why are we talking about natural immunity why are we talking

30:15.800 --> 30:24.200
about antibodies who's using masks and he was spending three months working with the fda to try

30:24.200 --> 30:32.520
and get trials and euas for these repurposed drugs and here in this particular discussion he's

30:32.520 --> 30:36.760
not talking about hydroxychloroquine at all even though when he went on joe rugen he mentioned it

30:37.560 --> 30:46.120
let's see maybe i'll keep going by by address that spectrum of pharmaceuticals and so you saw

30:46.120 --> 30:51.560
the fluvoxamine data came in positive today that's more news um something like 38 percent

30:51.560 --> 30:58.200
35 percent our protection in rct's ivermectin and that same trial did not show efficacy

30:58.200 --> 31:03.640
but they administered the ivermectin late and it relatively low doses so okay it's going to be

31:03.720 --> 31:07.880
made that that one was kind of set up to fail for the ivermectin arm but the fluvoxamine definitely

31:07.880 --> 31:13.160
hit statistical significance so we now need to add fluvoxamine as another agent uh that we already

31:13.160 --> 31:20.680
knew that i mean think about how absurd it is that we're talking about just drugs you know

31:20.680 --> 31:28.120
patented drugs that have no real use on the market and now we're trying to use them to apply to everyone

31:28.840 --> 31:37.000
who has a viral disease that's detectable by a pcr and this guy who's a master of molecular

31:37.000 --> 31:44.840
biology has been working on retroviruses since the start is not at all worried about the pcr being

31:44.840 --> 31:52.840
used incorrectly he's not at all worried about the a specificity of of laminar flow tests he's

31:52.840 --> 31:59.800
not at all worried about the misapplication of pcr without nested primers he's only worried

31:59.800 --> 32:06.520
about getting EUAs for these repurposed drugs to save people's lives you know because there was a

32:06.520 --> 32:16.200
38 percent you got to see it for what it is ladies and gentlemen at the time in 2021 this still

32:16.200 --> 32:22.280
sounded like really smart and really great and while at least he's doing something can't believe

32:22.280 --> 32:25.480
this guy came forward aren't we lucky that he's on our team

32:28.280 --> 32:34.760
but it's not really like that ladies and gentlemen this is august 2021 when everybody

32:34.760 --> 32:43.640
already should have been saying stop when i had already published something that said stop in may

32:44.600 --> 32:53.480
that i started writing in december of 2020 and should have really published in january of 2021

32:58.440 --> 33:02.280
we need to really consider what this means we need to really see what it means

33:03.560 --> 33:11.480
and then we need to reevaluate whether this faith in a novel virus that we had to shut down for

33:12.200 --> 33:18.600
that the mRNA saved a lot of people from and that although it was rushed it can be better

33:18.600 --> 33:24.040
and that this was gain of function and so we need to be afraid about it coming again this

33:24.040 --> 33:31.480
faith we need to get rid of it we need to dismiss it and this guy is one of the central priests

33:33.480 --> 33:38.520
and if you see him on any podcast now in 2023 he will not go against any of those

33:38.520 --> 33:44.200
tenements that there was a novel virus that we had to shut down he spent three months trying to

33:44.200 --> 33:58.280
find repurposed drugs with ditra the mRNA saved millions of people and it was again a function

33:58.280 --> 34:02.600
virus so another one will come again uh you know i i don't know how it turned you have been

34:02.680 --> 34:08.680
to the fluboxamine story but uh i'm i'm in touch with steve kirsch you know almost hourly he's the

34:08.680 --> 34:15.480
one that funded the george washington studies gw new uh um this is a different he's in touch with

34:15.480 --> 34:18.760
steve kirsch almost hourly

34:24.760 --> 34:29.560
prince so this is now the fourth study about fluboxamine uh that's something that i'm aware of

34:29.560 --> 34:33.560
that's great you know see the main the watchers need to realize that there is

34:33.560 --> 34:40.760
there's more tools in the toolbox as researchers like yourself um are hey look those screens work

34:40.760 --> 34:45.640
usually those screens are just blank but it looks like they actually do work that's kind of cool

34:45.640 --> 34:51.480
investigating compounds to try to fight the disease coven 19 or you know the virus stars coke too

34:51.480 --> 34:57.240
sir isn't necessarily the vaccine and the way fauci has been spinning it it was

34:57.240 --> 35:01.640
moderna moderna moderna from very from the kick call you know it was like that scene right

35:01.640 --> 35:09.080
that scene of the rc and moderna was created by darva um so uh there's yeah there's all kinds of

35:09.080 --> 35:13.400
angles here that i prefer not to go into having to do with bill and will indicate

35:13.400 --> 35:18.600
foundation and the tight relationships there and they're lobbying and uh you know zuckerberg

35:18.600 --> 35:26.920
chan and uh robert with johnson and w h o and facebook and there's just a huge array of folks

35:26.920 --> 35:32.200
that are with with money and power that have gone all in on vaccines as the only solution

35:32.920 --> 35:36.760
and i think i i'm a vaccinologist but my assessment from the outset was that

35:37.880 --> 35:42.040
that the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement based on prior work with coronavirus vaccine

35:42.040 --> 35:46.440
development was so great that in the timelines to demonstrate a safe and effective vaccine

35:46.440 --> 35:52.360
were so long and the uh risk that this was going to hit the states remember i started in in the

35:52.360 --> 35:57.640
beginning of january i was docking compounds on january 11th after the uh seafood market

35:57.640 --> 36:05.320
wuhan seafood market virus sequence was first uploaded he was docking compounds now i'm not sure

36:05.320 --> 36:12.920
if this refers to the model of x-ray crystallography that he talked about in later videos this year

36:13.000 --> 36:19.240
from earlier this year or earlier last year remember this is 2021 we're now in 2023

36:19.240 --> 36:29.640
this is pretty long time ago and mark twain told us a very wise observation that he always told

36:29.640 --> 36:36.120
the truth because then he didn't have to remember anything and so it's pretty easy to keep all your

36:36.120 --> 36:43.960
details straight if you're telling the truth it gets harder to keep your details straight when

36:43.960 --> 36:51.160
some of those details are not the truth and so i can't make any statements about what's the truth

36:51.160 --> 36:57.400
and what's not with anyone else talking but i can tell you that after listening to hours and hours

36:57.960 --> 37:04.680
of robert melones description of how he entered the race for a coronavirus cure

37:06.280 --> 37:12.760
and then how he stepped out of it as he went on the bread wine steam podcast that narrative has

37:12.760 --> 37:23.720
changed narrative has evolved and i'm not sure that that necessarily belies honesty it could also

37:23.720 --> 37:30.920
suggest something else and here i think is a good couple things that we've caught him on the

37:30.920 --> 37:39.080
we and the d-o-d we're able to do things aside from fauci so he referred to himself as part of

37:39.080 --> 37:46.280
the department of defense and he also said that the team that he's working with was dtr a detra

37:47.000 --> 37:54.040
defense threat reduction agency and the scientific director or the head of the scientific part of

37:54.040 --> 38:02.600
that organization is david hone a guy who used to sleep on his couch back in postdoc days

38:03.960 --> 38:09.240
so there's a lot of interesting things in this video that aren't necessarily repeated in the

38:09.240 --> 38:18.760
video with with steven hatville or in the videos with with uh alison or or with chan and joy for

38:18.760 --> 38:26.920
example i didn't focus on three cl pro which is what the uh um fizer drug is is inhibiting it's

38:26.920 --> 38:30.920
protease and rather i focused on the pat pain like protease because i knew that there was

38:30.920 --> 38:36.840
already a lot of candidates out there and a lot of attention on three uh cl pro i so the pat pain

38:36.840 --> 38:42.760
like proteases the protease which cuts the poly protein into its functional parts so in case

38:42.760 --> 38:51.560
you're unaware the way the cartoon of the infectious cycle goes the virus enters the cell it somehow

38:52.200 --> 38:58.280
unencapsulates the RNA and the RNA finds a ribosome and it translates

38:59.160 --> 39:09.080
uh or f open reading frame one a an open reading frame one a encodes for poly proteins one a and

39:09.080 --> 39:16.440
one b or one a and one a b and those are all those two poly proteins actually need to be cut into

39:16.440 --> 39:25.320
several other proteins which can then assemble into the subunits of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

39:25.320 --> 39:35.720
and its chaperone proteins and so you could go for a number of different enzymes but one of the

39:35.720 --> 39:41.400
enzymes is required to cut that up i think that's the pat pain uh protease if it's not

39:42.760 --> 39:49.400
then that protease does a similar job with another aspect of of the genome of the virus

39:50.360 --> 39:55.320
and and the Pfizer is one of many that are that are candidates for inhibitors of three seal pro

39:55.320 --> 40:00.680
these are both serine proteases and serine proteases inhibitors are notoriously nonspecific in the

40:00.680 --> 40:08.200
pharmaceutical industry and prone to uh dose limiting toxicity and complications so uh time

40:08.200 --> 40:13.320
will tell how that plays out and i you know i wish them the best but in with my group of pharmaceutical

40:13.320 --> 40:21.080
experts uh we've always been very wary of the potential risks associated with focusing on serine

40:21.080 --> 40:28.600
protease so so the potential risks for focusing on serine protease i presume is what he's implying

40:28.600 --> 40:35.320
is that it's not very specific so when you take a protease inhibitor you're also going to inhibit

40:35.320 --> 40:40.280
your own proteases which could have all kinds of effects that we don't really know i presume

40:40.360 --> 40:45.320
that's what he's saying so i see invasion one is that the name the invasion

40:46.120 --> 40:51.800
invasion one if he knew the risk of ad was so high that why would he ever take a jab for

40:51.800 --> 40:59.480
something that he had just recently had there's no question that that's 100 correct and it makes

40:59.480 --> 41:06.760
robermalone not look very smart for a guy who really knows everything about the immune system and

41:07.240 --> 41:15.400
viruses and virology and genetics and patents and and fill and finish technologies for

41:16.200 --> 41:22.520
for vire uh vire vaccine production it's certainly pretty silly to write a paper

41:23.320 --> 41:31.080
about antibody dependent enhancement get the virus at the biogen conference in in february and then

41:31.080 --> 41:36.760
take the shot before you go on on bread wine steins podcast because you had to travel

41:38.680 --> 41:45.480
like you're not clever enough to get a vaccine card without getting the vaccine because you know

41:45.480 --> 41:53.560
it's dangerous i mean it's extraordinary it's extraordinarily tall tale of woe

41:55.160 --> 41:59.560
the cocktail that you've been investigating is that with or without the corticosteroids

42:00.040 --> 42:03.880
great individual that matter of fact we've got strong data that if you add dexamethasone you

42:03.880 --> 42:08.840
kill people uh that they no i'm not kidding you can laugh the paper is out there we just had

42:08.840 --> 42:12.680
it provisioned yeah paul control just laughed about how many people in there to hear him

42:12.680 --> 42:17.640
that if you add dexamethasone you kill people uh that they no i'm not kidding you can laugh the

42:17.640 --> 42:21.480
paper is out there we just had it provisionally accepted i just got to make a couple modifications

42:21.480 --> 42:24.920
about how many people i mean don't get mad at him for laughing he's not an m d

42:25.880 --> 42:30.040
his phd that he calls himself dr paul control it's right there

42:31.400 --> 42:38.680
dr paul control i have to yell really loud before you can see on the side of my screen that it says

42:39.480 --> 42:43.640
that it says jonathan jay cooey phd but it doesn't say doctor cooey

42:46.600 --> 42:52.200
and there's a reason why i make that choice and there's a reason why paul control makes that choice

42:53.160 --> 42:58.040
robert malone doesn't have to do his podcast robert malone can do a million podcasts he just

42:58.040 --> 43:04.520
came out two months before this on bret wine steam he's the most interesting man in the world

43:04.520 --> 43:11.880
right now why in the heck is he on a podcast with paul control who's laughing about the fact

43:11.880 --> 43:18.440
that if you add dexamethasone to his cocktail of cures you can actually kill people or you can

43:18.520 --> 43:24.040
laugh about it but it's uh funny we've got strong data that if you add dexamethasone you kill people

43:25.160 --> 43:28.760
that they no i'm not kidding you can laugh the paper is out there we just had it

43:28.760 --> 43:31.880
provisionally accepted i just got to make a couple modifications about how many people in the

43:32.520 --> 43:37.880
study group were smokers uh which you know affects not a risk um and not always in a negative way

43:38.680 --> 43:45.480
so um they were not active smokers they were recovered smokers uh in that actually because of

43:45.480 --> 43:51.000
the groups they were in it actually makes our conclusions even stronger but uh you know if

43:51.000 --> 43:56.520
if your readers or if you want to post a link um i can send you the uh we put everything up on

43:56.520 --> 44:02.040
preprint servers right away because of the nature of the emergency and uh so the formatidine

44:02.040 --> 44:07.400
plus celococcib with them without dexamethasone paper it's readily available um on a preprint

44:07.400 --> 44:13.160
server and it clearly shows uh we jump from zero percent case fatality rate in hospitalized

44:13.160 --> 44:20.040
cobbid wcho you know four to six um to uh something like 23 or 25 mortality in the presence of dexamethasone

44:20.600 --> 44:27.960
we then verified it's not generally understood by most docs but the uh the data supporting dex

44:28.680 --> 44:33.560
is really quite tenuous it it took a lot of statistical manipulation to show statistical

44:33.560 --> 44:38.520
significance it's in a very small cohort that it does reach statistical significance it's very

44:38.520 --> 44:43.640
limited um it should not be used as widely as it's being used based if you're going to go fully

44:43.640 --> 44:50.600
evidence-based uh and um we're there's overlap in terms of the mechanism of action with celococcib

44:50.600 --> 44:56.920
any more if the uh the data supporting dex is really quite tenuous oh dexamethasone

44:56.920 --> 45:01.720
a lot of statistical manipulation to show statistical significance it's in a very small cohort

45:01.720 --> 45:06.680
that it does reach statistical significance is very limited um it should not be used as

45:06.680 --> 45:12.280
widely as it's being used based if you're going to go fully evidence-based uh and um we're

45:13.080 --> 45:17.640
there's overlap in terms of the mechanism of action with celococcib when you add the two

45:17.640 --> 45:23.320
they're definitely more toxic and lethal and uh this was verified in a platform trial called

45:23.320 --> 45:28.280
iSpyte that hasn't been published yet uh that we also funded through DoD. Absolutely somebody in

45:28.280 --> 45:33.720
the chat therapy McDonough is pointing out that just a minute ago he told us that it reached

45:33.720 --> 45:40.680
statistical significance for 37 percent of the people and so he got his p-value and now

45:41.400 --> 45:47.400
his his drugs are significant but dexamethasone needed extra special statistical treatment or

45:47.400 --> 45:53.320
something like that it's pretty disingenuous if you're going to use p-values and then criticize

45:53.320 --> 45:59.720
other people for using p-values it's pretty weak we had we had counseled that they should not

45:59.720 --> 46:04.520
proceed with the trial arm in the presence of dex but they insisted that they do so because

46:04.520 --> 46:11.080
they considered it standard of care in their uh they're basically a WHO56 cohort so this is under

46:11.880 --> 46:18.040
high flow oxygen or or intubation and uh so that is where dex is indicated uh they insisted that

46:18.040 --> 46:22.200
we had to have dex on board and they wanted to go ahead with the trial and in fact they verified

46:22.280 --> 46:28.840
that uh the trends were such that we would be uh um i don't know how to say this delicately uh

46:29.640 --> 46:34.680
more more patients would be lost on the triple combination their study also has a standard of

46:34.680 --> 46:40.200
care remdesivir and and i suspect that your viewership may be aware that remdesivir's efficacy is

46:41.160 --> 46:46.840
not quite what we led to believe uh in and uh most would say that it doesn't support the license

46:46.840 --> 46:51.720
that it has right now the authorization in any case that's that's a tangent that's going down

46:51.720 --> 46:57.240
a rabbit hole going down a rabbit hole you don't want to just say that they're poisoning people

46:57.240 --> 47:05.000
with it Robert that's going down a rabbit hole it doesn't have the efficacy that we were sold on it

47:06.440 --> 47:11.400
are you kidding me and i don't want to talk about it that's going down a rabbit hole so i'll just

47:11.400 --> 47:20.120
leave it there in august of 2021 when you could have said you know all of my drugs work better

47:20.120 --> 47:27.480
than remdesivir but they've been given remdesivir for a year already because when did they start

47:27.480 --> 47:31.960
giving remdesivir ladies and gentlemen who's the first person they treated with remdesivir

47:32.920 --> 47:41.240
thanks to marcusatonic marculac we know without a doubt that it's because of sahomich county man

47:41.240 --> 47:47.640
in washington state where the first guy was treated for what passionate compassionate

47:47.640 --> 47:54.680
whatever with remdesivir the guy wasn't even really sick we don't even know where the hell he went

47:55.480 --> 47:59.800
but we sequenced his virus was so much so that we built our PCR test on it

48:02.600 --> 48:08.680
and that guy was the first case where we used remdesivir a few weeks later tony fauci would

48:08.680 --> 48:17.160
sit on the couch of the white house right next to uh debra burks and explain how similar it was

48:17.960 --> 48:23.480
to with the early part of aids when we didn't know what to use against aids and now we don't

48:23.480 --> 48:31.320
know what to use against coronavirus but here we are and we're reducing hospitalization from 14 to 11

48:31.320 --> 48:38.920
days and so we're giving it an EUA and we're telling everybody in the united states to use it in

48:38.920 --> 48:47.560
hospitals and after a year of doing that more than a year of doing that that's what robert melon

48:47.560 --> 48:58.520
has got to say about it uh but yeah remdesivir's efficacy is and and i suspect that your viewership

48:58.520 --> 49:05.720
may be aware that remdesivir's efficacy is um not quite what we were led to believe uh in uh most

49:05.720 --> 49:10.760
would say that it doesn't support the license that it has right now the authorization in any case

49:10.760 --> 49:14.920
that's that's a tangent that's going down a rabbit hole uh but yeah stay away from the steroids if

49:15.000 --> 49:18.440
you're going to use fomotic and cellophaxis and it's a good thing and you'll see in a paper

49:18.440 --> 49:22.520
you've got a lengthy discussion he just stopped that's it that's all he's going to say about

49:22.520 --> 49:31.720
remdesivir it's being used nationwide he's just going to stop right there no more because it's a

49:31.720 --> 49:42.760
rabbit hole why because somebody said snake venom maybe should uh in that one uh in which

49:42.760 --> 49:48.040
I extensively quote tony fauci for an interesting review paper he did on decks a few years ago um

49:48.600 --> 49:54.120
decks decks is like a great big hammer to the immune system and uh absolutely not you know a

49:54.120 --> 49:58.600
case can be made that that decks is a great drug if you've got hospitalized coven and you want to

49:58.600 --> 50:03.320
pump your numbers up by getting them out the door and transferring them to a extended care facility

50:04.120 --> 50:07.720
instead of having them die in your hospital to be a little bit jaded but in fact that's what goes

50:07.720 --> 50:16.120
on is there's a lot of manipulation of hospital case fatality rates by offloading uh um uh

50:16.120 --> 50:23.080
patients to uh um various triage options and and decks is a great way to stabilize and get out

50:23.080 --> 50:28.520
the door and that is one way that is used in some hospital environments that's very interesting

50:28.520 --> 50:34.440
so let's let's pin it to the antibody dependent enhancement and vaccine associated disease

50:34.520 --> 50:39.800
enhancement now what's your take on what's going on with delta i'm from your observation where you're

50:39.800 --> 50:44.360
where you're sitting and all the resources you're doing i see high processes um so there's a

50:44.360 --> 50:48.520
that i just mentioned the Lancet paper that's just out that you haven't had a chance to read yet uh

50:48.520 --> 50:53.480
which takes patients that were uh basically two months out from vaccination that are break

50:53.480 --> 50:58.360
your cases and examines their characteristics so there's no real solid control in in the sense

50:58.440 --> 51:06.360
that you don't have um delta in uh unvaccinated or delta in um you know there's kind of like three

51:06.360 --> 51:13.560
cohorts right there's vaccinated there's previously infected unvaccinated and then there is uh naive

51:13.560 --> 51:20.040
unvaccinated those are three key cohorts and this only examines the one which is vaccinated at a

51:20.040 --> 51:24.680
time point it's a slice of patients that are breakthroughs at a time point of approximately

51:25.560 --> 51:30.920
eight weeks after vaccination so basically at completion of those two so this is peak

51:31.720 --> 51:38.360
for immune response uh in theory and what they found was that in the patients who

51:39.320 --> 51:45.080
had these breakthrough infections i think the number i don't have a paper here in front of me so

51:45.080 --> 51:52.040
fact checkers please don't skewer me uh forgive me for my elderly mind that is not a steel trap

51:52.120 --> 52:00.760
as it might once have been but i think it was 20 plus fold higher levels of of viremia then observed

52:00.760 --> 52:08.280
um uh with uh previously with alpha variant and this is in the vaccinated cohort uh infected

52:08.280 --> 52:14.600
with delta so comparing historic data involving alpha infections in the unvaccinated two uh

52:14.600 --> 52:20.680
delta infections in the uh previously vaccinated times two months prior uh in those breakthroughs

52:20.680 --> 52:27.080
they saw a huge increase in the overall titer relative to the comparator but then uh what they

52:27.080 --> 52:31.320
found was the characteristics of the breakthrough cases was that they were the subset that had

52:31.320 --> 52:38.120
relatively low titers uh so basically it's not that the the case is being made that it's not the

52:38.120 --> 52:44.280
distribution of breakthroughs is not uniform in this cohort that is two months out after vaccination

52:44.280 --> 52:50.680
but rather is is uh skewed into the cohort of vaccine recipients that were relatively low

52:50.680 --> 52:56.600
responders why does this matter um what we're seeing in the israeli data and now uk and some

52:56.600 --> 53:01.080
of the other countries that are coming online is that particularly in the israeli case delta hit

53:01.080 --> 53:06.280
at about six months you know four to six months after they finish their massive vaccine campaign

53:06.280 --> 53:10.920
and in israel we had uh really good vaccine uptake that's part of why Pfizer selected

53:10.920 --> 53:17.240
and did a special deal with uh um israel uh in that has some interesting contract terms i'm told

53:17.880 --> 53:24.680
having to do with uh um prohibited disclosure of adverse events that are collected um but yes

53:25.320 --> 53:30.680
i have this straight eatedly from his early scientists uh it's not publicly disclosed so so

53:30.680 --> 53:34.680
they they Pfizer went into israel because it's a very compliant population in fact they got very

53:34.680 --> 53:39.560
good vaccine uptake and then you may recall a few weeks ago Pfizer announced that the uh

53:39.560 --> 53:43.720
vaccine was going to need to be boosted at six months because the durability was poor

53:44.360 --> 53:49.720
and uh you may recall dr fauci reprimanding them for making that statement and then two weeks later

53:49.720 --> 53:55.560
this became u.s government policy and they're now about to roll out uh revax nation uh dose number

53:55.560 --> 54:01.640
three at six months in uh high-risk elderly and immunocompromised so that's pretty well an

54:01.640 --> 54:06.680
admission of this so the thing about the israeli getting group getting hit by delta at a brown six

54:06.680 --> 54:12.040
months is that that is just the window when they're starting to move into their the majority

54:12.040 --> 54:19.640
of their population being in the uh uh waning phase or uh no longer effective phase of the primary

54:19.640 --> 54:24.440
vaccine that they received and as you know and i'm understanding that your viewership is a more

54:24.440 --> 54:28.520
sophisticated audience uh the highest risk for antibody-dependent enhancement is in the waning

54:28.520 --> 54:35.000
phase because the slope is long so there's kind of like two windows of high risk if you can think of

54:35.000 --> 54:41.720
my uh intersection of these two straight lines of my hands uh if if you imagine the peak uh here

54:41.720 --> 54:48.520
is um shortly after uh completion of two doses the the ascending phase of the immune response is

54:48.520 --> 54:55.080
fairly steep and so the time the delta t in which you cross between um the threshold of immune

54:55.080 --> 55:00.600
response response necessary for protection and as you're climbing towards peak response it's fairly

55:00.600 --> 55:05.320
short it's very brief and then there's a long declining phase and so when you cross that window

55:05.320 --> 55:10.440
where you still have antibodies but insufficient tighter of antibodies and presumably insufficient

55:10.440 --> 55:15.880
tighter of the most potent antibodies uh because of the waning phase you have a much longer window

55:15.880 --> 55:21.800
of stability we still have antibodies around it combined the virus but if you don't have enough

55:21.800 --> 55:27.320
it will neutralize so he's really just finishing off here with the idea that anybody's antibodies

55:28.040 --> 55:34.440
right and and and actually paul asked him to go right into antibody-dependent enhancement and

55:35.320 --> 55:43.160
and and uh vaccine-induced uh disease enhancement or something like that which is all basically

55:43.160 --> 55:50.760
the same thing you make antibodies which can protect the virus from complement attack you make antibodies

55:51.400 --> 55:59.800
that can make the virus uh more likely to be taken up by other cell types you can protect the virus

55:59.800 --> 56:06.360
from neutralizing antibodies you can stabilize the spike protein in an open configuration after

56:06.360 --> 56:12.040
fear and cleavage with uh the right antibody there's almost infinite possibilities because of what

56:12.040 --> 56:18.600
we talked about with regard to what epitopes really are they're not sequences of amino acids

56:19.400 --> 56:25.000
they are three-dimensional electrostatic shapes and these three-dimensional electrostatic shapes

56:25.000 --> 56:31.800
are selected from the tertiary structure of the protein that is being processed and presented

56:31.800 --> 56:40.920
by the immune system there's no way for us to predict that that's a combinatorial nightmare of

56:40.920 --> 56:47.720
the possibilities that exist there and we have no idea how the body how the immune system sells

56:47.720 --> 56:53.240
decide about how that three-dimensional puzzle should be solved but here they are

56:54.040 --> 56:59.960
talking about potent antibodies and not so potent antibodies um it's all the same

57:03.320 --> 57:08.360
and so that's the end of the video but uh it was you know it's a it's a it's a throwback

57:08.360 --> 57:15.400
Thursday I mean that was the idea it's not um it's not maybe not surprising that it's uh that

57:15.400 --> 57:24.360
it's like that um and so yeah let's just remember some things and then we'll go to go to sleep

57:24.360 --> 57:30.760
early I'm going to be done before 10 while that's exciting what is this saying

57:46.280 --> 57:51.560
so they told us this story about a dangerous novel virus right and how did they get us

57:52.200 --> 57:59.080
to believe it they got us to believe it with this consensus of an illusion of consensus rather

58:00.120 --> 58:07.000
it's the it's the laughter in the background it's the uniformity across every newscast

58:07.000 --> 58:11.160
it was the uniformity of of opinion created by censorship

58:11.800 --> 58:17.640
the yin and the yang of that or the yang of that would be the the laugh track

58:18.760 --> 58:25.560
in Seinfeld excuse me I think you forgot my bread bread dude the laugh track is an illusion of

58:25.560 --> 58:33.400
consensus that makes this funnier you want bread yes please three dollars nothing for you

58:34.120 --> 58:41.400
and without that illusion of consensus it has a very different feel

58:43.560 --> 58:50.040
and without the illusion of consensus them telling you that there was a dangerous novel virus

58:50.040 --> 58:55.480
spreading from the from the from somewhere in china and it was going to kill up to a billion

58:55.480 --> 59:02.360
people would have seemed absurd if there wasn't this illusion of consensus

59:03.880 --> 59:08.840
this illusion of consensus in the background and in the foreground and on tv and in what they

59:08.840 --> 59:16.520
covered up and what they lied about and the emails created an illusion of consensus that

59:16.520 --> 59:22.760
made all of us believe that something very dangerous was happening otherwise why would we

59:22.760 --> 59:32.200
shut down why would we shut down schools why would we close businesses why would we give kids

59:32.200 --> 59:38.920
iPads why would we separate people who have been married for 50 years on their deathbed

59:38.920 --> 59:43.960
why would we separate them if it wasn't just an absolute nightmare of a virus

59:47.080 --> 59:51.720
all these people aren't talking about what's important notice that Robert Malone again master

59:51.720 --> 01:00:00.040
of molecular biology when discussing the fraud of the pandemic the fraud of the pandemic never

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:08.200
evolved around PCR testing it never even came close to revolving around PCR testing he was too

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.960
busy getting EUAs when the PCR test was being used to justify all the lockdowns to justify the spread

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:25.720
of a novel virus whose sequence was found all over the world in a week and the guy who's been working

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.520
with people like you know a Murray gardener the guy who brought the AIDS virus home in a

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:37.240
eppendorf tube in his pocket after having stolen it from the lab in France and he brought it back

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:50.040
to gallows lab as I recall Robert Malone worked with him this is not nobody this is a guy who has

01:00:50.920 --> 01:01:02.920
intellectual and scientific roots that go right down to the the clay bottom the moistest soil of the

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:14.200
swamp his roots go deep and long into this history and for whatever reason his the vine of his

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:23.000
history weaves right through it all and a lot of these people need more scrutiny because they're

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.040
just not talking about things that they could be talking about where is anybody but Jessica

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:35.080
Hockett talking about what happened in New York City Pierre Corey left a job in Wisconsin to go

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:42.120
work in New York City why isn't Pierre Corey shouting from the rooftops about Jessica Hockett's data

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:51.000
he threw away his career at the University of Wisconsin as an ER guy critical care guy and went

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.320
to New York City because they wouldn't let him treat patients the way he wanted to be treated

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:02.600
they to treat them in Wisconsin and then he went to New York and what did he find I don't know he

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:12.680
wrote a book about Ivermectin he lied to us about this stuff ladies and gentlemen

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:20.840
they lied to us about this by not talking about the light blue area by not talking about the between

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:28.200
50 and 60 thousand people that die every week in America and instead they told us a story about

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:35.720
a dangerous novel virus that could be detected by 250 different PCR tests and people like Robert

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:41.080
Malone and all the other people at the head of this are not questioning the PCR test at all

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:49.640
anymore when they go in front of the EU they're only talking about the Scooby-Doo that this is a

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:56.360
dangerous virus that was released from a laboratory gain a function you bad guys and that's not possible

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:05.080
because a natural coronavirus swarm cannot pandemic but an NIAID funded infectious clone may very well

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:12.280
have been used to seed the molecular sequence around the world and then the PCR test used to

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:21.240
rope in all-cause mortality the protocol changes could have easily resulted in this excess mortality

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.920
that was here and the goal has always been a total surrender of individual sovereignty

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.320
and an enforcement of global fundamental inversion from basic human rights

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.840
to basic granted permissions

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.280
in scenarios one through three of the Scooby-Doo mystery it is a batcave virus that wasn't here

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:54.360
before and then showed up later went around the world for the last three years killed millions

01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.440
of people maybe we made some mistakes maybe we didn't maybe the mRNA was rushed maybe it wasn't

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.840
but there was definitely a novel virus we definitely had to do something it could definitely come

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:13.800
again because it's gain a function and what i'm saying is is that if you believe in a in that then

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:20.920
you you you might as well buy some igloos in florida because they have told us nothing about the

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:27.720
signal that was in 2018 nothing about the signal that was present in 2019 because there's no data

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.840
nobody was doing PCR for a coronavirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase or a coronavirus

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:42.040
end protein in 2019 so we have no baseline and so wherever we rolled out the test we got a certain

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.640
number of positives but they didn't correlate with symptoms all the time so then what

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.000
that's the problem this conflated background signal

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.920
using a PCR test that can't differentiate from it is how you turn some little bit of a signal into

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:08.280
a huge signal you take a little tiny signal in luhan and a bigger signal in iran and a few cases

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:15.880
in america like sohomish county man sequence them show everybody that the sequences are highly

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:21.960
correlative and say that something new is spreading just like in the picture above my head there's

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:31.160
the bat getting out of the petri dish but on the background of other viruses other signals other

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:42.040
RNA positives other PCR positives and so you don't have to have a perfect explanation it could be

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:48.280
endemic coronavirus if you like that one protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:54.680
it could be an infectious clone release that's also fine

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.920
but then transfection is still not medicine and it could be a transfection agent release

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:17.080
that too why not but then it's still protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:25.160
and so i think we've got to come to this you know this is the one that covers the most ground

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:31.800
this is the one that covers the most possibility space this is the one that takes into account

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:38.520
things in the correct ratios if the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:45.960
if the PCR tests they used in 2020 and 2021 were not specific for a particular coronavirus

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:51.720
then there is no other story to tell you want to find the clone let's go find it

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.480
you want to find the background signal let's go find it

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:04.200
but if you want to look for again a function virus and you want to look for spike protein

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.880
and you want to look for all these other stories about you know viruses being released over and

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:18.120
over and over again then you're not you're not adequately exploring this this first and most

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.800
parsimonious possibility that there is a background signal that is being conflated as a pandemic

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.040
much much easier than repeated releases of all kinds of clones and then careful coordination

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:38.680
of the sequencing of them and careful monitoring of their spread might sound very enticing

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:48.280
but it's highly unlikely because again once you realize that everybody's lying why wouldn't they

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:56.360
lie about that too once you realize that the foundation of this is lies he can't take anything

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:02.680
for granted anymore least of all again a function virus still spreading like wildfire around the

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.080
planet

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:14.600
uhah i don't know maybe i'm saying too much here but this is definitely it i'll skip the no virus

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.520
one for this time they changed the way we think they changed the way we think about certain things

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:24.280
and that's why they were able to get us to do certain things and the vast majority of those

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.640
changes were detrimental to our society and that's remained detrimental to our society

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.280
those are the things that people don't want to talk about like Robert Malone in this video

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:42.440
from 2021 where he doesn't want to talk about remdesivir because it's a rabbit hole

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.960
remdesivir doesn't have the efficacy that his you know sophisticated users obviously know that

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:57.400
are sophisticated viewers of Paul Catrell's podcast know that that remdesivir doesn't have

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.440
the efficacy that we were sold with it is but i don't really want to go into that because it's

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:10.920
a rabbit hole it's on my list it's on marx list of things that killed more people than the virus

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:22.920
by multiple orders of magnitude and even if there was a clone or a virus spreading the remdesivir

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:31.320
would never have helped clear it you want to make some argument that that denizen and and uh

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.280
Ralph Barrack said in a seminar that if you give it in the first day of infection it has some

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:44.040
effect fine but how do you know when that is and so it's irrelevant remdesivir is useless

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:51.240
unless you're using a clone and you're just you're using it like you're deploying it and so therefore

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.360
you know when you're going to be exposed to it otherwise remdesivir makes no sense at all

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:04.680
and it's a poison because as Robert Malone said when you interfere with protein synthesis it's

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:11.720
pretty a specific remdesivir does doesn't interfere with protein synthesis of viral proteins it

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.640
interferes with all protein synthesis in the body of a person who takes it so how's that gonna work

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.600
out sure it shows up as kidney failure but does that mean that that's all it does

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.840
this is the hypothesis that i think covers us this is the hypothesis that i think everybody

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.600
needs to be able to hold in their head as a form you know like a baseball or a basketball

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:49.160
if i say that and i say imagine holding a leather basketball in your hand most people can imagine

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.280
what that feels like the rough weight and size and we've got to get people to understand the

01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:00.440
biology of the of the immune system and the biology of transfection and the biology of our

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:07.400
name versus DNA and the fidelity impossibility here we've got to get people to understand

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:15.960
this as a hypothesis so that they can see how plausible this is and how comparatively absurd

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:23.240
most of the other parts of this are forms of this narrative are we've got to make people

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.680
be able to get across that finish line of understanding this biology that's the goal for the following

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:36.040
year because before we're going to be able to break free and wake people up they need to understand

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.720
that and then we can get them to understand this that it's about data it's about collecting

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.560
it's about what Jamie Metzel said yesterday at his opening speech for the Bayer conference

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.080
it's about collecting a billion or two billion genomes at all the medical and bioinformatics

01:11:53.080 --> 01:12:03.400
that go along with it you can find me at gigome dot bio it's https colon backslash backslash like

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:10.360
that you know just that little thing up there it's like a twitter but it's not twitter and

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.240
we're all there now and it's starting to work out okay so I think this might catch on and you can

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:22.600
watch to follow other people as well there it's just that open fetaverse of decentralized servers

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.200
all sharing their their data and then you can find all my links there excuse me as well

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.760
please remember the transfection is not immunization and actually intramuscular injection of any

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.040
combination of chemicals to augment the immune system seems pretty dumb to me please stop all

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:46.120
transfections in humans and that's because they're trying to eliminate the control group by any

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:56.200
means necessary in case you're forgotten um this is gigome biological high resistance low noise

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:05.000
information stream brought to you by a biologist tomorrow at 10 a.m oh yeah thanks to the broken

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.160
science initiative if you haven't seen Greg's talk I'm going to do that I think some one of these

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:16.040
days coming up very shortly um support the the broken science initiative by sharing their podcasts

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.880
and stuff like that I'm not suggesting you need to support them or go buy stuff but they are a

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:28.680
really great idea um and they're moving forward with curriculums and books and and stuff so right

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:34.360
now the podcast is the thing to share and just get the word out that this exists in the Greg and

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:40.920
and Emily are working so hard to push this aspect of of broken science out of our society

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.400
and then tomorrow morning at 10 a.m eastern time if you go to the chd website you will see live on

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:55.240
chd tv the recording from yesterday will show up at 10 a.m so um I hope it's okay I do make

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.400
I will say right here that I do make a little mistake about dc sign because I get it mixed up

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:10.040
in my head and I I kind of am right that it's that it can stimulate T cell uh activate T cells

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.600
it can stimulate receptors on T cells it can also stimulate receptors and it's a receptor

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:21.000
found on dendritic cells but I didn't adequately characterize it I kind of mentioned it and stumbled

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.400
around on it so that's probably the one part of this that I'm not going to be happy about when I

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:31.080
see it tomorrow but anyway I hope you enjoyed the uh the stream tonight it's done before 10 o'clock

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.520
so I'm really happy about that I might get to bed on time thanks very much for joining me I'll

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:44.520
see you guys again tomorrow

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:19.640
so

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520
You
