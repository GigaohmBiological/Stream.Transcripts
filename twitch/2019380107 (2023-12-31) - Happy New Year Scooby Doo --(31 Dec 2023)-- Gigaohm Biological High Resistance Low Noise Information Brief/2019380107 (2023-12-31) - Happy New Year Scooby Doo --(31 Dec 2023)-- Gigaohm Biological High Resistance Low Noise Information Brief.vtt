WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:19.760 --> 01:24.200
Oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh time out JC on the bike

01:25.120 --> 01:32.720
JC on the bike it's JC on the bike it's JC on the bike yeah well I'm wise

01:32.720 --> 01:39.280
enough to know when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one look at

01:39.280 --> 01:46.000
round it's JC on the bike who says Vader didn't study music in college

02:24.200 --> 02:26.200
I

02:54.200 --> 03:13.520
And a T cell response in particular the cells that have that RNA they're

03:13.520 --> 03:17.120
making that spike protein will get attacked so hold on I want to pause you

03:17.120 --> 03:21.400
because I advanced a hypothesis on dark horse which is now just come right

03:21.400 --> 03:24.180
back up so I want to catch people up and then I want you to pick up your

03:24.180 --> 03:28.820
explanation so what I argued I believe I came up with this independently

03:28.820 --> 03:32.660
but I believe Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar as his

03:32.660 --> 03:35.660
Jonathan Cooey

03:55.180 --> 03:59.780
scene if you think about it you know if we're defining vaccine really

03:59.780 --> 04:03.060
liberally and these COVID vaccines are vaccines the flu vaccines vaccine okay

04:03.060 --> 04:05.980
but actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things

04:05.980 --> 04:11.340
vaccines and you know anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that

04:11.340 --> 04:15.900
you need shots within a year you know Canada saying nine months is as actually

04:15.900 --> 04:20.420
JJ Cooey's insistence and I think he's right on calling them

04:20.420 --> 04:29.900
transfections rather than vaccines so my name is Jonathan Cooey and I started

04:29.900 --> 04:35.420
this whole show in 2020 and I named it Giga Ohm biological because when I was

04:35.420 --> 04:41.060
an academic biologist I used to make what was called Giga Ohm seals as I

04:41.060 --> 04:46.220
recorded from individual neurons as depicted in this cartoon that's where

04:46.220 --> 04:50.820
Giga Ohm biological comes from and it actually is a very high resistance low

04:50.820 --> 04:56.220
noise recording and I hope that this information brief will be a very high

04:56.220 --> 05:01.620
resistance low noise recording as well Giga Ohm biological does need your

05:01.620 --> 05:09.340
support as we go into 2024 it's very possible that things will lead to the

05:09.340 --> 05:13.460
need for ever more support of this channel especially because as we've

05:13.460 --> 05:19.060
confessed to having been bamboozled the attacks have only increased and the

05:19.060 --> 05:25.980
pressure from all directions including those probably least expected may lead

05:25.980 --> 05:31.180
to this being a canned shaking operation on the internet again and if that does

05:31.180 --> 05:38.620
happen I need subscribers I think I think it would be if anybody out there

05:38.620 --> 05:45.180
still on the fence Japanese television I need people only so many and then this

05:45.180 --> 05:53.180
becomes almost invincible embarrassing anyway this stream is going to be

05:53.180 --> 05:59.980
dedicated to my friend NJB if there is any even a chance that what is

08:38.620 --> 08:40.620
you

09:38.620 --> 09:40.620
tell me

10:39.620 --> 10:46.660
well it is the 31st of December 2023 and there was no spread in New York City

10:46.660 --> 10:49.860
infectious clones are the only real threat placebo batches were likely

10:49.860 --> 10:54.220
distributed in transfection healthy mammals is dumb the protocols were

10:54.220 --> 10:58.340
murder gained a function as a mythology the Scooby-Doo is real and all it took

10:58.340 --> 11:03.540
was a spectacular commitment to lies in order to sustain a faith about a novel

11:03.540 --> 11:06.540
virus where millions of people died and millions won was safe

11:06.540 --> 11:12.740
I'm going to definitely come again just keep going biological

11:21.060 --> 11:28.340
oh that little glitchy glitcher there I saw a little glitchy glitcher there darn

11:28.340 --> 11:35.500
it definitely saw a glitch there I saw like Spock and somebody standing there

11:35.500 --> 11:40.900
that's not supposed to be visible some timing went off there darn it any who

11:40.900 --> 11:46.220
let's go back to the front screen here welcome to the show ladies and gentlemen

11:46.220 --> 11:54.100
happy new year it is the 31st of December 2023 I might have said something

11:54.100 --> 11:57.260
different earlier somehow that feels like it's the first time I've actually said

11:57.260 --> 12:01.100
that correct welcome to the show this is going on biological high resistance

12:01.100 --> 12:04.100
low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist in the back of his

12:04.100 --> 12:12.180
garage of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania USA Earth I hope that you are finding

12:12.180 --> 12:16.620
yourself in a cozy place surrounded by friends I hope you're not listening to

12:16.620 --> 12:21.020
this alone and if you are listening into alone I hope it's because you've chosen

12:21.020 --> 12:26.180
to you know just not be in the hubbub and craziness of what is essentially just

12:26.180 --> 12:30.380
another day the solstice was a couple weeks ago that was a significant event I

12:30.380 --> 12:36.020
mean really you know New Year's Eve what is it really other than an excuse for

12:36.020 --> 12:39.380
people to get drunk or kiss somebody that they couldn't normally otherwise kiss

12:39.380 --> 12:43.740
just like mistletoe really right giggling biological is the safest way to get

12:43.740 --> 12:49.340
biology into your head so happy new year happy new year to you out there Jeff

12:49.340 --> 12:55.700
I'm sorry that the tattoo didn't work out as well as you had hoped but it's

12:55.700 --> 13:03.180
still roughly the same shape anyway this is where we are we're trying to avoid

13:03.180 --> 13:09.300
our children boarding the train boarding the train that is the faith in a novel

13:09.300 --> 13:16.020
virus and unfortunately the way this is seems to have been working out is that

13:16.020 --> 13:22.740
everybody is seeming to ignore our conversion our eventual realization that

13:22.740 --> 13:29.700
most of this all of this was smoke and mirrors and instead everyone insists on

13:29.700 --> 13:35.660
suggesting that we still don't get it and we really are trying to succinctly

13:35.660 --> 13:41.180
describe what it is that we get and what it is we are trying to avoid we are

13:41.180 --> 13:44.900
trying at giggling biological to prevent you from passing on to your

13:44.900 --> 13:49.380
children the idea that we have defeated disease in the past using

13:49.380 --> 13:54.780
vaccination we are trying to stop you from passing along these other bad ideas

13:54.780 --> 14:00.020
that include PCR working and that variants are evidence of spread and that we spend

14:00.020 --> 14:03.300
money on getting a function research we don't want your children to grow up

14:03.300 --> 14:10.020
believing any of that and so I believe that the way out is biology and I think

14:10.020 --> 14:15.100
if we use this in this scenario we need to advocate for a pause on all childhood

14:15.100 --> 14:18.900
vaccinations in the United States and yes if you are out there and you have

14:18.900 --> 14:24.020
children I am advocating for you right now to seriously consider the possibility

14:24.020 --> 14:29.140
of never giving your children a doctor recommended CDC recommended vaccination

14:29.140 --> 14:34.180
again if you're about to have a child you have a wonderful opportunity a

14:34.180 --> 14:39.380
wonderful opportunity to have a control group child that is unvaccinated and

14:39.380 --> 14:47.540
just see what happens maybe you'll end up with a really ornery non reading non

14:47.620 --> 14:53.260
verbal frustrating child who's very emotional and hard to connect with maybe

14:53.260 --> 14:58.060
not I think we should be advocating for strict liability for all pharmaceutical

14:58.060 --> 15:01.740
products and I think anybody that's not using that language is probably

15:01.740 --> 15:05.860
selling you something I think we should investigate the use of deadly protocols

15:05.860 --> 15:10.820
to cause mass casualty events which were then misconstrued to create the

15:10.820 --> 15:17.660
illusion of a pandemic I would like also and serious investigation into the

15:17.660 --> 15:24.020
possible use of transfection in order to augment this illusion of a pandemic

15:24.020 --> 15:29.820
with real molecular biology I want you to reclaim sovereignty over your body

15:29.820 --> 15:34.580
and that of your children and I want Congress to be forced to end the CDC

15:34.580 --> 15:38.580
and withdraw from the who in the UN entirely

15:40.580 --> 15:47.020
the pandemic was created very specifically I explained this on the 23rd of

15:47.020 --> 15:51.780
December but the contents of my 23rd of December show were deemed totally

15:51.780 --> 15:57.060
inappropriate by people who have significant influence over me and so I

15:57.060 --> 16:03.300
removed that show on the 23rd in respect to those people and I am

16:03.300 --> 16:12.260
recapping that show here minus the information or content that was deemed

16:12.260 --> 16:17.660
inappropriate the pandemic was created in the following way and I'd like to

16:17.660 --> 16:21.180
explore this in a little more detail tonight

16:21.180 --> 16:25.300
seeding the gain of function narrative with scientific programs and peer

16:25.300 --> 16:29.220
reviewed publications for years before the pandemic you cannot underestimate

16:29.220 --> 16:33.220
how important this is and you can see the signals of it based on the fact that

16:33.220 --> 16:38.380
not very many people work on these things and the ones who do are connected

16:38.380 --> 16:46.660
to the top it's not like I could just go and start a coronavirus lab and that is

16:46.660 --> 16:52.140
by design because those papers needed to be out there at the same time as they

16:52.140 --> 16:58.300
were having regular upper level exercises i.e. secret meetings which were

16:58.300 --> 17:02.780
drilling in the idea that a response to a gain of function pandemic would be

17:02.780 --> 17:08.300
necessary in the future because of this existing national security threat

17:08.300 --> 17:12.980
seeding the mass casualty events with complications expected for

17:12.980 --> 17:17.100
transfection went right along with seeding the narrative of the worst team

17:17.100 --> 17:22.020
worst-case scenario with complications expected for transfection in other

17:22.020 --> 17:30.740
words they had to plan to transfect us all along and the idea was to have a

17:30.780 --> 17:38.020
number of symptoms blamed on the viral syndrome which would then confound the

17:38.020 --> 17:45.380
expected let's say adverse events that were going to inevitably follow with the

17:45.380 --> 17:51.500
rollout of transfection so then the real important detail here is making the

17:51.500 --> 17:57.500
response to the declared national cry sorry making the response to the declared

17:57.500 --> 18:02.420
crisis a national security operation to restrict open discussion of response

18:02.420 --> 18:08.660
by narrative directing participants in other words anybody that was co-opted by

18:08.660 --> 18:14.940
the narrative was also really signed in granted limited security clearance or

18:14.940 --> 18:18.220
something like that that would put them in a position where they felt very

18:18.300 --> 18:28.300
obligated to stick to the writing whenever they signed and the toxicity of

18:28.300 --> 18:32.100
the virus and transfection are confounded to allow the pandemic to prove the

18:32.100 --> 18:37.620
transfections successful ultimately successful with some hiccups successful

18:37.620 --> 18:45.300
with some obvious you know upgrades successful with some obviously obvious

18:45.300 --> 18:50.300
evolution of the technology that's the idea here that's how the pandemic was

18:50.300 --> 18:57.900
created that was the plan all along and of course we can see that in retrospect

18:57.900 --> 19:02.700
by looking at how number two these upper-level exercises were so orchestrated

19:02.700 --> 19:09.580
how they were written and how so on those same basic patterns this this event

19:09.580 --> 19:14.780
actually falls that can't be solely because they plan so well it's also

19:14.780 --> 19:27.020
because they planned so well and that's how we got here to be here in let's

19:27.020 --> 19:34.900
say you know four years I mean can you believe it four years and now we're here

19:34.900 --> 19:40.060
with this novel virus that killed millions I've heard seven million as a

19:40.060 --> 19:44.540
number around the world thrown around a lot over the last few days I heard

19:44.540 --> 19:53.100
Seth Seth whatever his name is on on Bill Myers Bill Maher's thing saying

19:53.100 --> 19:58.300
seven million people died like often extraordinary number to have in his head

19:58.300 --> 20:02.060
and repeat over and over again seven million people died but many more

20:02.060 --> 20:06.900
millions were saved from that novel virus and gain a function is real it's

20:06.900 --> 20:10.660
probably the source of where this came from ultimately and the virus will come

20:10.660 --> 20:15.540
again that's where we are this Christmas

20:17.100 --> 20:22.940
Christmas 2023 I mean it's and that's just that's just extraordinary and I

20:22.940 --> 20:34.060
hope all of you had a great one but as we move on into 2024 I don't think this

20:34.060 --> 20:39.220
analogy has lost any strength or any power at all the idea that we were

20:39.220 --> 20:44.500
fooled into solving a mystery the idea that we were tricked into thinking that

20:44.500 --> 20:51.340
we were uncovering liars funding streams grant proposals we weren't supposed to

20:51.340 --> 20:57.620
see whistleblowers we weren't supposed to see on camera all this stuff it's all

20:57.620 --> 21:02.740
a theater designed to make us feel like we figured out the mystery we solved it

21:02.740 --> 21:11.740
wow bad guys caught excellent that's what they want us to believe and for the

21:11.740 --> 21:16.940
most part the skilled TV watchers have been fooled here's an example of one of

21:16.940 --> 21:19.980
the headlines from the time that Joe Rogan was attacked and here are some others

21:19.980 --> 21:23.460
the Washington Post Joe Rogan is using his wildly popular podcast to question

21:23.460 --> 21:26.580
vaccines experts are fighting back remember there was a petition apparently

21:26.580 --> 21:29.460
from 300 doctors and they looked into that and those people weren't even doctors

21:29.460 --> 21:32.940
it's crazy the Atlantic Joe Rogan show may be done but is it actually deadly

21:32.940 --> 21:36.060
oh my god they were telling the truth this is propaganda this is coordinated

21:36.060 --> 21:40.620
how does this happen to people today Dr. Fauci says Joe Rogan is incorrect to

21:40.620 --> 21:44.220
tell young people not to get vaccinated I think Fauci was incorrect to go round

21:44.220 --> 21:47.620
of various government agencies disparaging the lab leak theory when it

21:47.620 --> 21:50.820
increasingly seems like that's exactly how this whole process began and they

21:50.820 --> 21:56.580
indeed participated in the funding of that very lab NBC Joe Rogan's COVID

21:56.580 --> 21:59.620
vaccine misinfo matters this is important actually this is why we've all

21:59.620 --> 22:02.860
got to really care about this well they failed didn't they but believe me that

22:02.860 --> 22:07.500
mentality has not gone away if you are a dissenting voice you will be attacked

22:07.500 --> 22:10.660
if you're an individual communicating online you're likely be censored let's

22:10.660 --> 22:13.220
know in the chat if you've had your free speech impaired and if you're a public

22:13.220 --> 22:17.940
figure the attacks could be unprecedented immersive coordinated and

22:17.940 --> 22:21.620
terrifying the United States wasn't alone in spending large sums of taxpayer

22:21.620 --> 22:24.740
dollars to promote its agenda the Trudeau government invested over six

22:24.740 --> 22:27.740
hundred thousand dollars in hiring social media influences to advance

22:27.740 --> 22:31.060
federal directives including the push for Canadians to get vaccinated and

22:31.060 --> 22:34.860
boosted his headline fed spent more than six hundred thousand hiring influencers

22:34.860 --> 22:39.620
in 2021 as ctv reports health Canada spent the most on hiring influences to

22:39.620 --> 22:43.060
promote government information a hundred thirty thousand six hundred dollars was

22:43.060 --> 22:46.540
spent towards an influencer campaign in support of the COVID-19 vaccination

22:46.540 --> 22:49.860
marketing and advertising campaign none of this is to mention Pfizer's

22:49.860 --> 22:54.300
vaccine campaigns paying celebrities to rhapsodize about marvellously safe and

22:54.300 --> 22:58.780
effective mRNA inoculation Travis Kelsey a professional football player

22:58.780 --> 23:01.900
watched and revered by many young American men in particular promoted

23:01.900 --> 23:06.420
game the updated booster shot on flu vaccine in the same visit here's a story

23:06.420 --> 23:10.740
about that the Washington Post NBC and the New York Times should have held the

23:10.740 --> 23:14.460
Biden administration's feet to the fire for promoting experimental vaccines in

23:14.460 --> 23:18.260
all Americans irrespective of risk and continued revelations regarding

23:18.260 --> 23:22.300
concerning side effects they miserably failed to do so the last standing

23:22.300 --> 23:26.420
bulwark against government propaganda and censorship is crumbling before our

23:26.420 --> 23:30.780
eyes losing relevant by the month perhaps a solution for media institutions

23:30.780 --> 23:33.820
to earn back credibility is to critically cover federal agencies

23:33.820 --> 23:38.220
misinforming the public rather than take funds to promote their agendas we have

23:38.220 --> 23:45.020
no reliable legacy state or corporate media anymore stay free see it first on

23:45.020 --> 23:50.860
rumble so is that an announcement that we don't have any more free media any

23:50.860 --> 23:54.620
more no more free state media was that an announcement or is he just telling us

23:54.620 --> 23:57.540
something that we already know I think he's telling us something we already know

23:57.540 --> 24:03.740
right and there's no real new information there with regard to the lab

24:03.740 --> 24:08.620
leak being the likely source of this and they funded it that was the Scooby-Doo

24:08.620 --> 24:16.780
in a nutshell with with Russell Brandt using Joe Rogan as a as a tool to

24:16.780 --> 24:24.620
explain that they solve the puzzle and by solving their mystery you accept

24:24.620 --> 24:29.380
their monsters that's really the trick here by solving their mystery you accept

24:29.380 --> 24:33.180
their monsters so the first thing you need to understand is that with the

24:33.180 --> 24:36.660
seating of the gain of functionality with scientific programs this is the

24:36.660 --> 24:43.940
real basis of everything this is where the no-virus people I guess I would

24:43.940 --> 24:49.460
best give it to Stephen Lanka and and these these people that were already on

24:49.460 --> 24:57.060
the AIDS the AIDS illusion there's a Greek lady Elena something else who was

24:57.060 --> 25:06.140
really big on on exposing the the lack of isolation of the HIV virus but the

25:06.140 --> 25:11.220
seating of the gain of function narrative by eco-health alliance and the Wuhan

25:11.220 --> 25:15.900
lab and all this other stuff could have could be sorted out to figure out who

25:15.900 --> 25:21.220
who took advantage of who to see this pandemic potential as an idea they didn't

25:21.220 --> 25:25.780
and and the the virus the no-virus people have been very good about pointing out

25:25.780 --> 25:32.340
that they have never proven the existence of pandemic potential highly high you

25:32.340 --> 25:41.300
know highly fidelity excuse me high fidelity replication of RNA in in

25:41.300 --> 25:47.140
bats this kind of in culture they've never shown this and in fact the way

25:47.140 --> 25:52.380
that they have created the pandemic potential as an idea is using PCR and

25:52.380 --> 25:58.620
metagenomic sequences sequencing as methodologies and then by that using

25:58.620 --> 26:03.820
them over and over again and calling that evidence of pandemic potential then

26:03.820 --> 26:11.620
they were setting up PCR and sequencing as bona fide evidence of these viruses

26:11.620 --> 26:17.060
so that the years of scientific programming and and the grant funding and

26:17.060 --> 26:20.900
these these papers that were released even if there were only a couple of

26:20.900 --> 26:27.700
years were in the background establishing the idea that these viruses were

26:27.740 --> 26:34.140
circulating when the only evidence they had were these these ridiculously faint

26:34.140 --> 26:40.380
RNA shadows that they claimed were evidence of a circulating pathogen pool

26:40.380 --> 26:46.820
and again what that did was it created the idea of pandemic potential and it

26:46.820 --> 26:51.180
created the illusion that these methodologies are really pulling something

26:51.180 --> 26:55.220
out of this noise in the background that's meaningful and also potentially

26:55.220 --> 27:01.260
dangerous and so as we were wandering on this road and we were looking for

27:01.260 --> 27:06.540
someone to pick us up and and give us a ride to somewhere none of the

27:06.540 --> 27:13.340
discussion of pandemic potential is an idea or PCR or metagenomic sequencing or

27:13.340 --> 27:18.260
even regular Sanger sequencing none of that discussion challenges the

27:18.260 --> 27:23.260
existence of a novel virus and none of that challenges how those million people

27:23.420 --> 27:27.620
died in the United States the Denver challenges whether or not this gain of

27:27.620 --> 27:32.180
function is real or it's just something that they're they're hocus-pocusing in

27:32.180 --> 27:38.180
the in a in a dish to try and give us the idea that it's real no one's even got

27:38.180 --> 27:42.700
that on their radar yet even though we've been saying it for almost two years

27:42.700 --> 27:48.940
now that we have been fooled it's only a question of how deep we have that we

27:49.260 --> 27:55.340
come to understand that being fooled and nothing is more frustrating than

27:55.340 --> 27:59.100
having been here for this long and having still people trying to

27:59.100 --> 28:04.740
mischaracterize how we got here why we got here or who kept us from getting

28:04.740 --> 28:12.260
here earlier but if you would have gotten into the car with a bunch of no

28:12.260 --> 28:15.940
virus people you would not have gotten here any earlier than anyone else

28:16.220 --> 28:19.900
because for some reason or another they couldn't put the whole picture together

28:19.900 --> 28:30.740
to make a coherent statement to anybody they could only sling sling sling and so

28:30.740 --> 28:34.580
the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of

28:34.580 --> 28:39.300
any RNA molecule and I would argue that the no-virus people in the way they

28:39.340 --> 28:45.900
tried to spread that idea was as dangerous as the people who were

28:45.900 --> 28:50.860
spreading the gain of function viruses are real and this is a spike protein

28:50.860 --> 28:58.260
causing amyloidosis that's just as dangerous two sides of an absurdity

28:58.260 --> 29:06.420
coin no molecular biology at all exists molecular biology you know with nuclear

29:06.420 --> 29:13.420
weapon potential exists two sides of the absurdity coin both of which were

29:13.420 --> 29:18.020
wielded against us to make sure that basically we wouldn't figure out that

29:18.020 --> 29:25.980
this was really really was a theater and whether or not all of these people now

29:25.980 --> 29:31.380
come to the middle and start to absorb parts of the narrative and absorb parts

29:31.380 --> 29:44.820
of the Scooby-Doo we have to see it for what it is if we're gonna escape and so

29:44.820 --> 29:49.100
high-level narratives I'm sorry I could probably go back to that conducting

29:49.100 --> 29:53.700
regular upper-level exercises and drilling the response to again a

29:53.700 --> 29:59.020
function pandemic crisis exactly what we got here with with this you know

29:59.100 --> 30:03.180
getting an illusion of consensus about this potential this illusion of

30:03.180 --> 30:08.660
consensus extends across fields and lots of biologists believe it lots of

30:08.660 --> 30:15.780
bureaucrats believe it lots of doctors believe it and this took years for this

30:15.780 --> 30:22.020
to be formed it took years for this to be set up and then we release book after

30:22.020 --> 30:26.820
book after book reinforcing this idea reinforcing that that's what happened

30:26.820 --> 30:31.260
giving people an opportunity to go in depth and really think deep about how

30:31.260 --> 30:38.220
this happened that's how this surrender of our individual sovereignty is going

30:38.220 --> 30:47.700
to be enacted if we don't wake up now and I'm part of it I didn't wake up

30:47.700 --> 30:56.580
early enough to see what's going on here and even even even even with the

30:56.580 --> 31:02.380
opportunity to get that get some of this biology into Bobby Kennedy's book we are

31:02.380 --> 31:09.100
still being ignored when it could be used as an opportunity it's used as an

31:09.100 --> 31:16.580
opportunity to attack when it could be read and critiqued and pointed out that

31:16.620 --> 31:22.580
there's there's a passage in there that's pretty lame but it's a quote from a

31:22.580 --> 31:26.340
certain time in a certain part of my understanding and the evolution of it

31:26.340 --> 31:37.060
and it got put in the book and so the way that these secret meetings have

31:37.060 --> 31:41.580
reinforced pandemic potential the way that these books have reinforced pandemic

31:41.580 --> 31:48.220
potential the way that we are protecting this faith in a novel virus has gotten

31:48.220 --> 31:55.100
us here that's why Nathan is not with me anymore with his family anymore excuse

31:55.100 --> 32:01.660
me for being so egoistic Nate's not with his family anymore because I couldn't

32:01.660 --> 32:07.580
figure this out early enough because I couldn't break free of this mythology

32:07.580 --> 32:13.620
and because I was surrounded on all sides by people who were trying to make

32:13.620 --> 32:25.500
sure that I wouldn't and so what I was surrounded by from February of 2020

32:25.500 --> 32:32.900
onward was Timor's case scenario Timor's case scenario in the beginning of

32:32.900 --> 32:40.580
2020 was actually partly drastic on Twitter but also some of the intellectual

32:40.580 --> 32:48.420
dark web was seeded as the Timor's case scenario from early 2020 even late 2019

32:48.420 --> 32:54.620
and specifically they were seeded with ideas which could be used to confound

32:54.620 --> 32:58.660
the effects of transfection knowing the transfection was going to be rolled

32:58.660 --> 33:05.500
out as a countermeasure and so it's literally turning into worst case scenario

33:05.500 --> 33:10.100
depending on who you got picked up on the road by who you who you found

33:10.100 --> 33:14.780
yourself in a live stream with who you found yourself following you were

33:14.780 --> 33:19.380
gonna hear someone telling you that it was gonna be worst case scenario and

33:19.380 --> 33:24.260
worst case scenario leads to this faith in a novel virus it leads to this idea

33:24.260 --> 33:28.500
that there are things we don't understand there are coronaviruses that can cause

33:28.540 --> 33:33.960
a pandemic the coronaviruses spread asymptomatically and that they can kill

33:33.960 --> 33:38.460
people depending on who gets them and the variants are evidence of spread and

33:38.460 --> 33:46.940
evolution almost everyone you got in the car with would be talking about this

33:46.940 --> 33:50.580
stuff and if you got in the car with no virus people you'd be talking about

33:50.580 --> 33:57.100
isolation purification and talking about foyas all the time instead of talking

33:57.100 --> 34:02.580
about the murder of thousands of Americans that was used to justify the

34:02.580 --> 34:09.820
pandemic response all around the world the murder or the faking and fainting of

34:09.820 --> 34:15.100
deaths in America that were reported around the world that were used we have

34:15.100 --> 34:20.420
to investigate this crime to find out whether these mass casualty events were

34:20.420 --> 34:25.580
real and then do a take account of exactly how real they were and then

34:25.620 --> 34:29.780
cop to the fact that these mass casualty events which are not evidence of spread

34:29.780 --> 34:34.860
were used to justify the pandemic response and used to see the narrative

34:34.860 --> 34:44.140
that led to the faith in the novel virus and talking about isolation and

34:44.140 --> 34:49.380
purification of viruses until you're blue in the face will not get us there does

34:49.380 --> 34:55.180
not codify adequately what they did to us so that we can free our family and our

34:55.180 --> 35:00.580
friends and our neighbors and our countries and our governments it gets us

35:00.580 --> 35:06.100
lost in the never-ending loop and they've known that from the very beginning

35:06.100 --> 35:11.980
that's their job that's the job of everyone who has been part of this worst

35:11.980 --> 35:22.500
teamwork case scenario everyone I'm gonna escape out for just a second and

35:22.580 --> 35:25.580
restart that

35:30.020 --> 35:38.700
the fact of the matter is you can see them very clearly now and the same

35:38.700 --> 35:43.740
people are still pushing the same narratives some people that were pushing

35:43.740 --> 35:47.860
amyloidosis and pre-on disease about the spike protein and its gain of

35:47.860 --> 35:52.380
function properties that were engineered into it in 2020 are now pushing that

35:52.380 --> 35:59.660
still and now it has to do with the transfection and the sad part is is that

35:59.660 --> 36:05.020
amyloidosis protein misfolding and maybe even worse could have been

36:05.020 --> 36:11.500
expected from transfection on a grand scale and so how convenient is it that

36:11.500 --> 36:15.660
teamwork case scenario in 2020 was saying the same things that they're saying now

36:15.660 --> 36:20.300
only now applying them to transfection

36:20.620 --> 36:25.620
confounding the effects of the spike protein in particular with the effects

36:25.620 --> 36:30.780
of transfection again to protect the methodology from critique as they were

36:30.780 --> 36:36.540
there from the beginning to do sent seeding the worst case scenario so that

36:36.540 --> 36:39.620
the fear confusion and doubt would take hold that the narrative could be

36:39.620 --> 36:43.300
propelled that the Scooby-Doo could be seated and to be there through the

36:43.300 --> 36:48.540
whole thing to make sure that it stayed on its rails

36:49.540 --> 36:54.220
it's not a matter of what counts what what's true that counts in this case it's

36:54.220 --> 36:59.020
a matter of what these people have managed to convince us is true

37:00.700 --> 37:05.380
and we've gone through this a lot but I think it's very important to keep

37:05.380 --> 37:11.740
recalling that these people had no principles until 2022 they had no

37:11.740 --> 37:18.420
principles until 2022 and even in 2021 they took a long mealy mouth route to

37:18.420 --> 37:21.660
finding their principles

37:25.100 --> 37:29.980
now it's really interesting that the first time I ever reached out I'm gonna

37:29.980 --> 37:33.580
show that thing now I was gonna show it later but for some reason I got on the

37:33.580 --> 37:38.860
the no virus thing where am I now here I'm on the Jordan Peterson slide okay so

37:38.860 --> 37:42.220
I'm gonna go back down to the bottom here I'm just going to show you this

37:42.220 --> 37:49.060
really quick because I think it's kind of cool

37:49.700 --> 37:58.060
here is the first email that I ever sent to Dr. Sam Bailey and it was sent on 810

37:58.060 --> 38:05.620
2021 August 10th 2021 dear Dr. Bailey or hello Dr. Bailey I'm a former

38:05.620 --> 38:08.580
research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of

38:08.580 --> 38:12.700
Medicine of course they have taken me off their website but you can still find me

38:12.700 --> 38:17.940
on PubMed and I give her a link I've been trying to teach the basic biology at

38:17.940 --> 38:24.700
play here since last year including on my YouTube channel JC on a bike where I

38:24.700 --> 38:28.860
was doing journal club for neurobiology until this all started you have

38:28.860 --> 38:33.860
remained one of my favorite rocks to swim to when I think I might be losing

38:34.060 --> 38:38.140
my grip thanks for that if you'd ever like to do an interview with someone that

38:38.140 --> 38:41.460
could really dig deep into the biology with you I'd love to interview on my

38:41.460 --> 38:50.500
twitch screen stream be well Jay Kui sounds pretty antagonistic sounds really

38:50.500 --> 38:57.060
awful doesn't it like wow that's crazy what a mean guy hey dear Jay thanks for

38:57.060 --> 39:00.180
reaching out and for the opportunity to be interviewed on your twitch stream at

39:00.180 --> 39:03.140
the moment I am heavily pregnant and just trying to get out my last set of

39:03.140 --> 39:07.300
YouTube videos done before having my baby in the next few months few weeks

39:07.300 --> 39:10.460
sorry unfortunately I can't commit to any more interviews until I've had my

39:10.460 --> 39:14.660
baby but perhaps we'll be possible in a few months once I know where things are

39:14.660 --> 39:18.820
at best wishes Sam Bailey and I said yes warmest wishes what wonderful news I

39:18.820 --> 39:23.140
would be delighted if you'd revisit this information please or invitation please

39:23.140 --> 39:26.900
do take care there are many predictions about an acceleration of nonsense

39:26.900 --> 39:31.380
coming I hope it's fake news thanks for taking the time to respond I look

39:31.380 --> 39:36.660
forward to hearing all as well with you and yours sincerely Jonathan Jay Kui

39:37.940 --> 39:41.300
why is that important because that's August 2021

39:42.900 --> 39:52.500
that's August 2021 and that's after I wrote my review and it is after my July

39:52.500 --> 39:58.580
2020 and May 2020 months where I repeated over and over again that we were being

39:58.580 --> 40:04.100
fooled by a background and a confounding PCR signal and that natural immunity to

40:04.100 --> 40:07.460
whatever this was was fine

40:09.060 --> 40:13.380
so we were at GIGO and biological we've been extraordinarily ahead of the

40:13.380 --> 40:17.060
curve like we could have taken a six-month vacation and come back and still

40:17.060 --> 40:20.660
people would have been catching up to us

40:20.660 --> 40:28.180
and so it is with somewhat annoyance then that I I feel like we're still here

40:28.980 --> 40:34.100
in the midst of this snowstorm of nonsense still trying to fight the same people

40:35.060 --> 40:42.660
pushing the same silly ideas and even after I've tried to create the momentum to get out of this

40:42.660 --> 40:49.300
ditch still people pretty much ignore all of it and I'm not sure really what it's for

40:50.420 --> 40:55.540
but I do know that a lot of people are are unable to participate in the discussion because

40:56.100 --> 40:58.820
they are part of a national security operation

41:00.740 --> 41:04.660
I don't know who they're affiliated with they could be affiliated with private contractors

41:04.660 --> 41:09.940
with clearances or or or with the government itself and human health and human services or

41:10.820 --> 41:13.620
or asper or or whatever I don't know

41:15.220 --> 41:20.500
but that it would explain very easily why so many people stay on message in such a weird

41:20.500 --> 41:26.100
android-like way and so with that spectacular commitment to lies

41:27.220 --> 41:34.660
for national security reasons we are effectively confounding the toxicity of whatever agent

41:34.660 --> 41:42.500
was out there whatever protocols we used whatever do not resuscitate orders we gave

41:42.500 --> 41:46.660
whatever ridiculous stuff we did in 2020 to create

41:47.540 --> 41:51.140
mass casualty events and the excess deaths that we needed including letting

41:51.780 --> 41:53.700
opioid epidemic run wild

41:56.900 --> 42:03.140
we have just confounded all of this nonsense with the effects of the shot

42:08.100 --> 42:13.380
and the idea is of course to blame it all on the virus and the shot does nothing because that's

42:13.460 --> 42:18.980
just a vaccine when in reality they knew the shot would do all this damage and it would

42:18.980 --> 42:24.500
knew that it would have long-term consequences and so they seeded a narrative of a novel virus

42:24.500 --> 42:29.620
starting to circulate with these novel consequences so when they showed up they could blame it on the

42:29.620 --> 42:36.580
newest variant JN1 or whatever as the heart attacks start coming in they're already telling you that

42:36.660 --> 42:39.940
there's going to be a increase because of this new variant

42:44.740 --> 42:49.140
and so it's the same game it continues to be the same game

42:50.900 --> 42:57.220
all right let's jump into it a sad soul can kill you quicker far quicker than a germ that's by

42:57.220 --> 43:04.580
John Steinbeck I'm not just so sure how true that is but I think it's a good conversation

43:04.580 --> 43:11.220
starter you know as people start making decisions about what to do with regards to the holidays

43:11.220 --> 43:16.820
right you know it's something incredibly sad about the holidays where people were alone and

43:16.820 --> 43:24.180
isolated and hopefully now with with vaccines with with wise choices about air quality and

43:24.180 --> 43:31.700
ventilation with you know jumping on treatment and testing this can be hopefully a holiday season

43:32.260 --> 43:36.500
where people are not alone and we can make some smart choices to allow people to

43:36.500 --> 43:44.100
to be together and not have sad souls and so the idea of course is is that that was all necessary

43:44.100 --> 43:48.980
because it was so bad and we did good job and the people that didn't go to do a good job made it

43:48.980 --> 43:54.260
worse and now the people that really know what's right are still doing what's best which is taking

43:54.260 --> 43:58.500
vaccines and wearing masks and social distancing and blah blah blah blah

43:59.380 --> 44:03.860
encouraging their grandparents to get all the vaccines getting their flu

44:07.620 --> 44:12.740
that's what these people are doing that's where we are in 2023 going into 2024

44:14.900 --> 44:16.660
I don't think there's anything on this screen

44:19.300 --> 44:24.420
and again we got here with this limited spectrum of debate we got here with these

44:25.220 --> 44:33.300
people who I mean again I keep coming back to the no virus thing but the no virus people also

44:33.300 --> 44:40.980
never ever ever would allow a open debate about things it was always a very limited spectrum of

44:40.980 --> 44:48.020
debate and they argued that they were making sure that the content of the discussion would be limited

44:48.020 --> 44:53.700
to virology and to the isolation or purification of viruses but what's really interesting is is

44:53.780 --> 45:02.500
that there were a couple gigantic openings for them that they never took openings that included

45:02.500 --> 45:06.900
emails that were written by me where I said that I think there's a possibility where all of us

45:06.900 --> 45:12.740
could be right on the resistance and we could unite on this idea of being all kind of right

45:14.100 --> 45:19.060
they would have no part of it even after we expanded the idea to say that even though if

45:19.060 --> 45:26.340
they've exaggerated the phenomenon of natural viruses there are clones and you and I both may

45:26.340 --> 45:31.940
not understand how these things work in culture or how they would work in application in quantity

45:33.940 --> 45:40.180
no discussion nothing zero zip send us some papers where there's some evidence of these clones

45:43.060 --> 45:48.820
again fighting desperately to keep this limited spectrum of debate very lively

45:48.820 --> 46:02.180
and angry but not having really any genuine interest in resolving the debate in coming together

46:02.180 --> 46:09.780
in an earnest desire to save the world otherwise they would put forth the people that have been

46:09.780 --> 46:17.540
there for the longest otherwise they would be humble enough to say that this has been going

46:17.620 --> 46:22.260
on for a lot longer in this person and this person and this person are the people you should turn to

46:26.180 --> 46:29.380
but of course Kaufman and Cowan don't do that

46:31.860 --> 46:36.100
they I don't know I'm just sure that even if they come around now

46:38.500 --> 46:45.060
I'm absolutely certain and you can see it in that email in August 2021

46:45.860 --> 46:51.860
I had contact with them and I had nothing but nice things to say I wanted to talk to them

46:51.860 --> 46:57.700
I wanted to be convinced I was fine with being convinced at the same time as that was going on

46:57.700 --> 47:08.100
people like people like the raccoon tamer were playing videos about Bimbo Bailey or something

47:08.260 --> 47:12.660
like that and she was having pictures of hot dogs in her mouth and stuff

47:17.300 --> 47:21.940
it's an extraordinary theater ladies and gentlemen extraordinary theater that was created how this

47:21.940 --> 47:28.500
pandemic was done and it was done from all levels it was done from coordinated private contracting

47:28.500 --> 47:33.780
to control the narrative and to make sure that the people who are all wandering around during

47:33.780 --> 47:37.780
the course of this pandemic would get picked up by different automobiles and every one of those

47:37.780 --> 47:40.900
automobiles would be filled with people that would never lead them to the truth

47:43.620 --> 47:48.580
and so it doesn't matter what combination of people you choose off of this screen the likelihood

47:48.580 --> 47:55.780
of you choosing a combination that got you free in 2020 or 2021 was zero

47:55.780 --> 48:09.300
and that's how we've gotten here that's how we've gotten here that's how this will become the truth

48:10.740 --> 48:15.620
because the people that are going to get promoted and then are going to move on and that are rising

48:15.620 --> 48:22.500
in their popularity and their significance are all not questioning the novel virus not questioning

48:22.500 --> 48:27.060
spread not acknowledging the data that says there's no spread

48:29.700 --> 48:36.580
even some people who have produced the data that show there's no spread are not really pushing the

48:36.580 --> 48:45.460
idea that their data shows there was no spread and I can think of at least two people with all kinds

48:45.460 --> 48:53.460
of work put into analyzing the data of the pandemic and they both have data which shows that

48:53.460 --> 49:01.860
there was no spreading respiratory pathogen no spreading risk additive pathogen was going anywhere

49:01.860 --> 49:10.900
ever and none of them say it they say that the vaccines are deadly they say that they're lying

49:10.980 --> 49:18.900
about vaccine deaths sure they do that's fine but they don't question the existence of the virus

49:18.900 --> 49:28.100
at all and in fact they often reinforce it and I was doing that for most of my my pandemic

49:30.580 --> 49:37.300
right up until 2022 when I realized that it was all clones that it could all be done with clones

49:38.020 --> 49:41.940
that clones could explain the two or three places where it was cultured that's it

49:43.620 --> 49:48.420
clones could explain it all and it just really depends on how much molecular biology do you need

49:48.420 --> 49:58.260
to be real how much is real but the idea of a high fidelity RNA virus is not supported by

49:58.260 --> 50:04.660
anything in biology and so therefore they needed to pull this scam where all of these people would

50:04.660 --> 50:09.380
be co-opted into pushing a particular part of the story sticking to a particular part of the

50:09.380 --> 50:16.180
narrative just like if you were to help this guy with his illusion on the train you'd have to stick

50:16.180 --> 50:22.980
to a particular part of the train you'd have to stay out of his way otherwise very quickly

50:22.980 --> 50:26.820
he would get in his way and then it would be obvious that you weren't doing anything to stop

50:26.820 --> 50:31.860
the train or he wasn't because you'd bump into him and it would look oh wait well oh wow the train

50:31.860 --> 50:34.260
stopped and you guys bumped into each other you didn't do anything

50:36.820 --> 50:45.220
that's why this this analogy is so apt because in order for 50 people to coordinate with him in

50:45.220 --> 50:53.300
order to pull this analogy off with 50 people he would need to practice you would need to have a

50:53.300 --> 51:00.980
plan and a script and you would need to get out keep out of each other's way and that's what all

51:00.980 --> 51:06.820
of this was that's what the exploration of hydroxychloroquine and the exploration of ivermectin

51:07.940 --> 51:13.140
was all about that's what the discussion of the spike protein as evidence of gain of function with

51:13.140 --> 51:17.780
all the tinkering in it that's what that was all about the discussion of it being

51:17.780 --> 51:22.180
gated function so that maybe we can't make immunity to it because it's been engineered to not be

51:22.900 --> 51:26.020
able to make immunity to it that was part of it

51:26.020 --> 51:35.940
and i got sucked in like everybody else i got sucked in because i had people coming to my house

51:36.820 --> 51:38.820
i had people coming to my house

51:41.860 --> 51:46.420
i got a whole board over there of the number of people that have been to pittsburgh to my house

51:48.260 --> 51:55.060
trying to come to my house ladies and gentlemen these medlers for four years they've been coming

51:55.060 --> 52:01.460
to my house and that's why i didn't understand this illusion fast enough

52:03.780 --> 52:10.180
that's why i have to say i'm sorry to nate's family and every other family that i didn't save

52:10.180 --> 52:20.820
couldn't come quick enough to this it's my bad but it was a very firing operation i

52:20.820 --> 52:24.980
droxychloroquine and ivermectin are both likely widely beneficial

52:27.940 --> 52:29.460
and certainly we're going to hurt anything

52:31.540 --> 52:38.980
and they were given in combination with other known pharmaceutical interventions medicines

52:38.980 --> 52:46.500
that would be known to help with these respiratory situations so it's it's it's unfortunate but this

52:46.660 --> 52:52.260
is the reality of it these stories were also part of it they were they were to cover up

52:52.260 --> 52:59.220
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were to cover up the usefulness of things like azithromycin

52:59.220 --> 53:01.780
and dexamethasone when used appropriately

53:04.260 --> 53:10.900
and the countless other things that people like perechory and and peter mccullough were using

53:10.900 --> 53:17.540
in their protocols they all probably helped but the idea that we were accentuating and selling

53:17.540 --> 53:21.940
books about hydroxychloroquine and selling books about ivermectin that's the problem

53:26.420 --> 53:30.660
because that doesn't tell the whole story of what was actually going on there that there was a

53:30.660 --> 53:36.820
covid protocol or covid protocols recommended by the who hand by the cdc often which weren't

53:36.820 --> 53:42.980
in agreement and then there were also these off-book protocols that included a whole bouquet

53:42.980 --> 53:48.340
of different substances but we only ever talked about ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine really

53:50.340 --> 53:55.780
even joe rogan was a case in point in this where he had six or eight different things and they said

53:56.340 --> 54:03.300
that he had ivermectin he had monoclonal antibodies also and a couple other things so it's it's

54:03.300 --> 54:08.020
strange and untruthful but it is how they did it

54:11.700 --> 54:16.580
and once you see who was pushing these narratives and how they were pushing it and how they were

54:16.580 --> 54:26.260
elevated you start to see from the perspective of retrospect looking back it's impossible for

54:26.260 --> 54:33.380
all this stuff to line up like this it's impossible it's impossible for Brett Weinstein's

54:33.380 --> 54:39.780
podcast from december 2019 to line up with all of the lab leak stuff and then line up with all of

54:39.780 --> 54:47.380
the the the tv narrative and then all of the everything that it was there until he recorded a

54:47.380 --> 54:53.860
stream with bobby kennedy that he didn't release for 14 months and all of the the the things that he

54:53.860 --> 54:59.460
knew from me in the background that he never said out loud that can't all line up for four years

54:59.460 --> 55:07.620
and not be something else this doesn't line up for four years straight and all of these people's

55:07.620 --> 55:10.820
behavior unless they aren't doing this it's not possible

55:19.220 --> 55:23.540
it's like saying that a bunch of airplanes with smoke trails just flew randomly and suddenly

55:24.020 --> 55:27.060
they wrote Shakespeare in in the sky

55:31.700 --> 55:37.460
these people were coordinated somehow by some entity or entities

55:41.060 --> 55:46.820
maybe it was the five-eyes governments and their intelligence agencies coordinating

55:46.820 --> 55:52.980
the response it wasn't the American government alone because not only did they need the excess

55:52.980 --> 55:57.940
deaths in america to create the illusion of a mystery virus spreading in america but they needed

55:57.940 --> 56:05.620
those other countries to lock down they needed those other countries to go crazy and to put on this

56:05.620 --> 56:11.620
huge theater of of draconian lockdown and then be allowed to say that see we don't have any

56:11.620 --> 56:16.980
covid because we locked down meanwhile the united states is murdering people but we're saying

56:17.620 --> 56:23.620
it's covid spread and blaming it on people who didn't lock down people that aren't wearing masks

56:25.620 --> 56:32.020
and that diabolical psychological operation that was executed on the whole world with coordination

56:32.020 --> 56:39.060
from small agents and large social media entities algorithms the whole nine yards

56:41.300 --> 56:45.460
it's the excess deaths in the united states that were used to sell that the excess deaths that

56:45.540 --> 56:52.420
were not due to a spreading pathogen that at least a couple very prominent people with data collection

56:52.420 --> 56:59.300
has their schtick no all too well that there was no spread they all know all too well that

56:59.300 --> 57:03.860
there's no evidence for spread they know all too well that there's evidence for all kinds of other

57:03.860 --> 57:10.580
malfeasance which caused those mass casualty events and they're not talking about it

57:10.740 --> 57:15.460
they're saying that the vaccine killed a lot of people yes it did

57:17.140 --> 57:21.460
but the vaccine could not have been rolled out the transfections could not have been rolled out

57:21.460 --> 57:28.580
as a countermeasure without these people dying without all of these opioid deaths increasing and

57:28.580 --> 57:35.300
being ignored without the death certificate fraud that we know went on without the financial incentives

57:35.300 --> 57:39.460
without the tracking trace crap that all went on the mass the closures the mandates and without

57:39.460 --> 57:48.580
the PCR and lateral flow test fraud and likely the sequencing fraud none of this could have happened

57:50.100 --> 57:56.180
without coordination and all of this works against the idea of a gain of function virus leaked as

57:56.180 --> 58:01.540
a dual bio weapon blah blah crap amyloidosis prion

58:01.860 --> 58:09.300
they all of this stuff works against it because none of these things are honestly

58:09.300 --> 58:15.380
subtracted from the total by any of these people they say there's a novel virus and there were

58:15.380 --> 58:22.980
deadly deadly protocols and they say that seven million people around the world were killed

58:23.460 --> 58:33.860
and that's a lie because that's not doing the math and if you do the math there's no mystery virus

58:36.980 --> 58:44.260
there's zero epidemiological evidence of spread somebody hanging out with Steve Kirsch all the time

58:44.260 --> 58:50.660
has all kinds of data that there's no evidence for spread somebody that went to Romania and met

58:50.660 --> 58:56.500
all of the big stars of the dissonant movement and they all promoted him he's also got evidence

58:56.500 --> 59:01.300
that there's zero epidemiological evidence of spread but doesn't they don't seem to talk about that

59:02.340 --> 59:06.820
they seem to be really keen on focusing on the deaths caused by the transfections

59:10.020 --> 59:14.580
nobody's talking about all the money we're saving from all these Medicare patients that were killed

59:15.380 --> 59:21.860
nobody's talking about strict liability for some pharmaceutical products they're talking about

59:21.860 --> 59:27.540
EUA extensions to Marburg and Ebola countermeasures and they're definitely not talking about the

59:27.540 --> 59:33.060
vaccine schedule and the damage it does being a Seventh Amendment violation because we can't sue

59:33.060 --> 59:40.020
the government for those damages nobody's talking about that nobody's talking about the vaccine

59:40.020 --> 59:47.060
schedule in America being criminal they're only talking about things that can't do damage to

59:47.060 --> 59:53.700
the heart of the matter let's say that there are no viruses in the world at all is that really

59:53.700 --> 59:57.540
what you need to be saying then or do you need to be saying that there are no viruses at all

59:57.540 --> 01:00:07.540
therefore stop vaccination

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.860
i think you need to be safe stop vaccination and i don't mean transfection i mean all of it

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:25.540
the entire criminal schedule built on the immunomethology that ultimately from which pandemics

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.100
have come ultimately this new world order with bat cave viruses is what they're doing

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:39.220
with this immunomethology and if we let this past be erased we let this past be forgotten we let

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:48.660
2021 be forgotten if we let 2020 and 2021 be forgotten then we will lose

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:56.260
and in 2020 and 2021 none of these people were speaking up

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.820
and the ones that were were specifically pushing a worst case scenario

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:17.300
and once you see it once you see that all the people that are prominent now that were prominent

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:24.580
in 2020 and 2021 were pushing the worst case scenario following the directives of the worst case

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:30.180
scenario debating the directives of the worst case scenario advocating for the intelligence

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:35.860
of the worst case the obvious common sense worst case scenario you better use a bandana because

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.780
if this is a gain of function virus boy you are in trouble

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:50.660
and so can all the molecular biology be a fraud no so therefore the alternative of no virus is

01:01:50.660 --> 01:02:00.100
insufficient but is this infectious cycle real probably not are there highly pathogenic coronaviruses

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:08.660
that can circulate the earth almost definitely not are there gain a function viruses that can

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:14.580
be created in a laboratory and travel the world because they're so good at what they do no no no

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:21.300
we can barely find them in the wild and the best description i've come up with is this

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:30.980
mixtape idea that they can't make RNA do anything good because it's RNA it doesn't have the fidelity

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:39.140
of DNA the analogy being the cd and so what you can do with a cd you can't do with

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:44.740
audiotape because audiotape doesn't have that fidelity and RNA is very similar to that

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.220
audiotape it doesn't have that high fidelity copying mechanism it makes errors regularly

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.860
and those errors tend to be detrimental and catastrophic for the fitness of the molecule

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:04.020
and therefore growing it in culture and sustaining it that way is impossible they don't do it

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:09.860
instead what they do is they sequence it and they generate that sequence in a DNA molecule

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.420
and then they make quantities of that DNA molecule the DNA molecule being in the analogy of cd

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:23.220
they make that into small fragments that are circularized circular circular

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:32.420
and they are put into bacterial cultures where they are grown into higher quantities

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:40.420
those DNA can then be you know gathered and mixed with a culture sorry a commercial enzyme or

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:46.340
put into cell culture or electroporated into a cell culture and that can allow them to do these

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:53.780
basic virology experiments and to to standardize across laboratories because again they're starting

01:03:53.780 --> 01:04:00.420
with a DNA standard which is converted to RNA and so although there will be some variation in the RNA

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:08.180
produced from that DNA clone that RNA will be as close to an RNA clone of that original virus

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:14.740
sequence as you could possibly get given the limitations of DNA versus RNA replication given

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:21.860
the limitations of RNA replication in bacterial culture etc but you're going to have a quantity

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:30.740
of RNA and a purity of RNA that could never be produced from the original whatever that RNA sequence

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:36.740
signal that you see in the wild and that's the important reason to understand infectious clones

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:44.020
as a methodology because if they work they are the primary way that any virology is done because

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:50.660
you can't grow viruses in a lab it got to start somewhere else it doesn't last that long and

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:58.180
infectious RNA clones are the answer and also the possible you know criminal methodology by

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:04.820
which this sequence or sequences have been distributed around the world it could be as little as two

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:10.740
or three patients which allowed the sequence to be to be cultured to be sequenced and then to be

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:18.180
disseminated around the world as the evidence of spread or it could be the opposite worst case

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:25.460
scenario where they are regularly spraying or introducing RNA or DNA clones of the new sequences

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:29.220
into our sewers into our water supply into the air I don't know

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:40.260
as bacteriophages or as lipid nanoparticles or as aerosolized virus-like particles I don't know

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:47.860
choose your patent but there's no doubt that they can make this RNA in quantity because

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:54.100
they do it for commercial product they do it for commercial products for academic biology and for

01:05:54.100 --> 01:06:00.020
pharmaceuticals all the time it's a question of just upping the game using the right equipment

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.340
in the right sizes would it be perfect no of course not but they could definitely do it

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:10.980
this is not technology imaginary technology this is real and the fact that people don't want to

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:19.460
discuss this as a source of the molecular biological signal that was misconstrued as the pandemic

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:25.700
is another sign that people aren't really playing fair you can say there are no viruses in the wild

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:34.020
and this could still be real and in reality what we are dealing with is in that case would be

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:42.900
a security state which has decided to go so far as to test biological agents

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:50.820
which are self-replicating RNA molecules and test them by releasing them and saying that they are

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:59.540
coronavirus zoonotic jumps and for the last 20 years we have been testing genetic engineering

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.900
technology or or transfection technology by releasing it into the wild

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:18.260
that's the other end of this very very you know this is this is real

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.100
this is what they claim they can do this is what all virologists understand as

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:29.700
standard operating procedure but most of them haven't made the connection that

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:38.820
this belies the idea that that viruses are capable of circulating the globe for four or five years

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:49.700
straight but we're here now and we can see the people that have ignored this idea and continue

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:57.380
to ignore the idea that the methodology of infectious clones generated from DNA sequences

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:04.820
is the foundation of this RNA virology field in general and so until we understand it better

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.620
we can't take it for granted we can't take it at face value the no-virus people were right but

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:13.140
they haven't played their cards correctly so that no one really got converted

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:20.020
now i'm going to try and play those cards with them and i hope that at some point we

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.740
can come to the realization that it's it's it's now or never

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:34.020
either we realize that they could have fooled us on purpose with the knowledge of the background

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:42.340
and with the release of a or the the application of molecular biology to create the signals that

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:46.100
they use to cause this illusion of consensus

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.860
and so we have been confused into believing that millions were killed by a novel virus and millions

01:08:53.860 --> 01:09:00.740
more were saved and this faith is almost unshakable because they have so many preachers in place

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:09.380
they have so many acolytes in place and those acolytes have many many followers because the

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:15.780
algorithms have been used to amplify them the stunts of censorship have been used to amplify

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:22.740
them the introduction of new social media during their censorship has been used to amplify them

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:30.260
and it continues to this day a guy like me who has been consistently trying

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.460
still has a fraction of the number of followers on anything that i have right now compared to

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:43.300
some of these people who are able to put out 15 page sub stacks eight times a week

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:51.460
and who also do podcasts all over the world and also travel all over the world and and go on

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:57.300
cruises with people and go it's hot tubbing with people all these they have time for all of this

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:05.220
because they have professed the faith and anybody who is crashing this faith has been discarded

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.980
anybody who's trying to question that faith has been attacked

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:17.940
unless you got on that one crazy team and then everybody just kind of you know just kind of

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:25.860
disappears and so here we are our kids are about to board this train our schools are about to board

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:33.060
this train many of them are already sitting in their seats whoops waiting for the train to

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:43.300
is it running no waiting for the train to pull out of the station and so we must dispel this idea

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:48.820
that we have defeated disease and epidemics in the past using vaccination we must dispel this

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:55.780
idea that novel coronaviruses can jump from other species and can pandemic we must dispel this idea

01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:03.620
that PCR can be used to track things i have heard from several doctors now that they have a battery

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:09.140
test that they use to test from anywhere from four to seventeen different pathogens with a single

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:16.820
PCR swab we have to get away from this idea that asymptomatic spread is real we have to get away

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:22.180
from the idea that variants are evidence of both spread and continuing evolution of a single virus

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:26.500
and that the vaccine is causing it that this new variant is going to be especially dangerous

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.300
and that everybody knew it was going to be that way we have to get off of this train

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:37.860
the way that we do it is with the biology we advocate for a pause on all childhood vaccinations

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:43.700
we advocate for strict liability for all pharmaceutical products and we investigate the crime that is

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:49.060
the pandemic while we reclaim our sovereignty over our bodies and our children and we force

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:57.060
congress to close the cdc and withdraw from the who and the un entirely if you want to see who the

01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:03.540
medlers are you can see them by watching what they do and don't do they do not advocate against

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:08.260
all childhood vaccines in america they don't they don't even touch the vaccine schedule at all

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:15.780
they don't advocate for the strict liability for all pharmaceutical products they were most of

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:21.060
them were were involved in advocating for the use of novel products for the novel virus

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.540
so they're definitely not an EUA's for them they're not definitely not going to

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:31.540
advocate for strict liability and they rarely if ever cite the use of deadly protocols to cause

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:38.180
mass casualty events as a meaningful data point in other words rather than saying it regularly

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:43.380
that people were murdered in the united states in order to create the illusion of a pandemic maybe

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.460
people were murdered in italy but people were murdered in order to create mass casualty events

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:55.780
that were misconstrued as spread and in retrospect in multiple data sets we can see that there is

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:04.740
no evidence for spread so everyone needs to reorient and that's why i'm here apologizing on

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.060
this late hour having figured it out

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:18.100
they do not use the word transfection they do not use the word clone to explain anything

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:25.140
they attack people instead of ideas and they are unable to summarize across the entire show and

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:34.180
that should be capital s show because it is around the entire capital s show that this is

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:39.940
happening you got to be able to tell the whole story if you're really focused on their their

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:46.020
squashing ivermectin and that's your only thing you want to talk about squashing ivermectin is

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.100
evidence that there are bad guys out there then you are not playing fair

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.700
if your idea is to say that there's amyloid coming and it's amyloid coming and amyloid

01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:01.700
is always coming i told you amyloid is coming you're not playing fair because they murdered

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.860
people in america in order to create the illusion of spread they murdered people

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.060
and if you were really trying to win that was something that you would say

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.620
oops the video stopped there for a second story about that so we are at a time point

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:28.100
where human diversity is at its peak for all time and there will never be more genetic diversity

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:34.180
available again but i think we can flip this around a little bit try to be a little bit more

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.500
positive what can we do about this we are at a time point where human genetic potential is at its peak

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:45.060
and there is still time for humanity to awaken to a new vision of our future and i do really think

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.700
that that is how we have to look at 2024 they are going to try and break us

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.660
make no mistake about it they are going to try and break us and i think they're going to break

01:14:54.660 --> 01:15:02.020
us with a lot of different sort of a lot of different drama and a lot of different strife

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:10.660
but if we stay focused on the biology and do not forget our near past of 2020 and 2021 and work

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:18.340
ever diligently to accurately bring everyone to account on team worst case scenario we are

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:28.420
going to win so please stop transfections in humans and please the elimination of the control group

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.700
is still in danger intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:39.140
augmenting the immune system is dumb and transfection healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:42.100
are not pattern integrity so i know this was not a new show

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:53.300
but because i had to take down my my 23rd of december show i wanted to replace it with another one

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:59.220
which would cover a lot of the same things and especially this list of how actually the pandemic

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:04.740
was done because i think it's pretty close and i do think the team worst case scenario is definitely

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:14.340
part of this central part of this plan and these these various people that are still trying to

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:20.900
ignite conflict between them and trying to accentuate conflict between them are really still trying

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.860
to close the loop on the limited spectrum of debate and make it appear very lively

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:31.780
but if it's pretty lively between people that are all part of this then we're not actually

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:37.860
escaping and i think that's what we're still witnessing so please keep your head up

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:45.220
if you can please go to giga-homebiological.com and scroll down you can also find a green

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.380
green button there it says support giga-home you can also find the soapbox link there which

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:59.380
we're going to be using in 2024 and now you can find a schedule you can also find a place to leave

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:04.500
a voicemail um which would be kind of cool because i would like to play some of these voicemails

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:10.020
on air but nobody seems to leave them and then finally if you can um subscribing would be really

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.780
great because i do think giga-homebiological is going to need your support this year

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:22.740
big things big things are going to happen this year i think so um the the closer we are to free

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:30.660
and uh independent and financially not dependent on anyone else um the more likely we are to move

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:36.900
the ball forward thank you very much happy new year i'm going to go upstairs and enjoy a drink

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:43.700
before the fireworks start and uh anyway thanks very much i will see you again tomorrow this is

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:50.180
the start of a new streak um i don't know how long the streak is going to be but uh i'll see on

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:53.380
january first on the flip side ladies and gentlemen thank you very much

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.060
um beep beep beep beep beep beep
