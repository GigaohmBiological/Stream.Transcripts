WEBVTT

00:00.347 --> 00:01.988
Jiminy Christmas, that's annoying.

00:02.928 --> 00:04.969
Testing 1, 2, 3, test!

00:05.249 --> 00:06.870
Hopefully this is working now.

00:08.530 --> 00:12.692
Always something here on the show.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.573
Always something.

00:14.693 --> 00:16.033
This should be a notebook.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.075
This should be a blank screen.

00:20.675 --> 00:23.957
Gosh darn it, that is so frustrating.

00:24.797 --> 00:27.238
Always so frustrating.

00:28.658 --> 00:29.859
Hang on to your pantyhose.

01:23.683 --> 01:24.543
Yeah.

03:12.648 --> 03:15.609
Ladies and gentlemen, watch Ruth.

03:17.351 --> 03:25.095
All through this film, Ruth has been thinking, what can I possibly do that will amaze everyone?

03:26.756 --> 03:28.177
I think she's come up with the answer.

03:28.257 --> 03:28.998
Just keep your eye on her.

04:08.220 --> 04:08.402
you

08:39.417 --> 08:40.300
♪ Lost in the music ♪

09:42.186 --> 09:42.869
I'm

11:04.888 --> 11:08.989
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

11:11.169 --> 11:12.729
I think truth is good for kids.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.950
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

11:17.451 --> 11:19.091
We want everybody to feel good.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.452
That's not, that's not the way life is.

11:23.952 --> 11:27.873
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

11:29.654 --> 11:30.374
And I have lied.

11:30.394 --> 11:31.434
I'm sure I'll lie again.

11:31.454 --> 11:32.374
I don't want to lie.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.215
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

11:34.335 --> 11:35.375
I try not to be a liar.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.235
I don't want to be a liar.

11:36.795 --> 11:39.516
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

11:55.349 --> 11:57.230
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

11:57.330 --> 12:10.238
His name is JJ Cooley and I believe he's a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.681
the the

13:19.235 --> 13:23.258
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, good afternoon, good night, wherever you are.

13:23.278 --> 13:27.120
We are here again at Giga Home Biological.

13:29.982 --> 13:32.424
I hope you enjoyed the Frank Zappa opening.

13:33.645 --> 13:42.191
Every once in a while you need a good cleanse and Don't You Ever Wash That Thing was the title of that sequence of music.

13:42.251 --> 13:44.532
Some of the best ever recorded in America.

13:45.529 --> 13:46.729
or by an American band.

13:47.730 --> 13:56.632
Your consciousness is still that prime real estate that we're fighting for and I hope you're still fighting for yours and that of your kids.

13:59.153 --> 14:02.454
I hope that you're still fighting for these truths to get out.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.495
I'm starting my second cup of coffee.

14:05.555 --> 14:07.736
I don't think coffee was the bad guy here.

14:11.690 --> 14:18.615
There's a couple parts of that song, Hapazzo Girl, that are some of the best grooves that have ever been created live on a stage.

14:18.695 --> 14:25.699
I'm telling you, if you have Spotify or something like that, look that song up and listen to it in headphones so you can understand.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.801
There's two drummers that are ripping that up, too.

14:28.861 --> 14:34.685
I don't know if you could hear that from the stereo sound or not.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.408
I'm really excited about the show today.

14:39.508 --> 14:40.369
I'm not going to...

14:41.673 --> 14:49.275
I gotta try and keep a level head as I move through this one because it's going to be very easy for me to get too fired up about this.

14:49.795 --> 14:59.317
I just want to be as objective as possible as we try to peel back this onion and try to learn our history before they erase it.

15:00.778 --> 15:05.359
Try to take back the power from the charlatans that we inherited from our parents.

15:06.979 --> 15:09.460
We don't want to pass this mythology on to our children.

15:10.925 --> 15:15.747
And I think it's going to be a tricky needle to thread in order to make gentle the life of this world.

15:15.787 --> 15:23.309
Their plan is to not make gentle the life of this world so that they can go from this chaos to a new kind of order.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.050
And we're going to try to avoid that.

15:26.430 --> 15:27.331
But it's going to be tricky.

15:33.021 --> 15:49.313
and in America it's been a it's been a long we have a long history of a wave of lies being governed by a wave of lies and so if we're going to teach our children to see the wave and be able to surf their way back to shore safely

15:50.977 --> 16:05.877
We're going to need to teach them the truth about biology, but also the truth about money and the truth about banking and the truth about real politic and the truth about vaccines, the truth about human rights and what human rights are or what they aren't.

16:07.348 --> 16:10.249
And that's what I'm really excited about today.

16:10.289 --> 16:13.369
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

16:13.429 --> 16:27.113
And if not, you might be a person that needs to learn to stay focused on the biology, maybe needs help not taking the bait on TV and social media, and maybe needs to be reminded again, shown by example of how to love your neighbor.

16:29.190 --> 16:39.665
The way this works is that people share the stream every week and a very few people have decided to subscribe to the channel either through Substack or my own website at GigaOMBiological.com.

16:39.725 --> 16:42.770
Any way that you do share the work is very appreciated.

16:42.830 --> 16:43.751
Every little bit helps.

16:44.432 --> 16:49.936
At some point the threshold is going to be reached and there won't be any stopping this anymore.

16:50.497 --> 17:00.904
I'm starting to see the activity on stream.gigahome.bio where we have an archive of everything and where you can also watch live if you don't want to watch on Twitch.

17:01.485 --> 17:09.471
It's got a little bit more of a delay but other than that it's the same video and more importantly you're not on Jeff Bezos's

17:10.331 --> 17:12.612
I think Twitch belongs to Amazon, doesn't it?

17:12.792 --> 17:15.754
Anyway, we're trying to make a paradigm shift happen here.

17:15.774 --> 17:21.397
We're trying to shift our understanding of not only the pandemic, but of how we've been governed.

17:21.437 --> 17:36.665
And if we shift that correctly, our kids, by themselves, will drop their hands from their eyes, stop participating in the sustaining of this illusion, and start to engage and inform noncompliance just like we are trying to do.

17:38.038 --> 17:40.060
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giggle and Biological.

18:06.738 --> 18:07.700
Good morning, everyone.

18:07.800 --> 18:12.387
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:12.427 --> 18:18.918
My name is Jonathan Couey, and I come to you live as often as possible as I can from the back of my garage.

18:18.938 --> 18:19.499
I gotta take a...

18:24.658 --> 18:27.501
I don't want to be overly dramatic, but I'm a human just like you.

18:27.561 --> 18:32.947
Sometimes I get nervous, sometimes I get a little excited, sometimes I just get a little nervous.

18:32.987 --> 18:42.337
Today I'm a little nervous because I'm going to put a couple balls on the tee and take a swing at them that I haven't really done in the past.

18:43.218 --> 18:47.042
And I'm going to introduce you to a couple things.

18:47.143 --> 18:50.526
And I think there's a threshold that's being reached.

18:50.586 --> 18:52.208
I don't want to get too excited about it.

18:52.689 --> 18:55.632
They are just trying to run out the clock, right?

18:55.772 --> 18:56.733
That's what they're doing.

18:56.753 --> 18:58.054
They're running out the clock here.

18:59.396 --> 19:08.884
I don't know if it's running out the clock to some catastrophe, disaster, crisis, nuclear weapon, cyber attack, or election.

19:10.425 --> 19:15.750
But whatever they're doing, I feel like we have forced a few moves.

19:15.850 --> 19:25.038
And so as a Friday show, I just wanted to cover a bunch of things and do a few things that I don't normally do, a bit more of a firehose kind of show.

19:28.171 --> 19:32.492
I have garden fresh mint tea here, I've got coffee here, and I've got water down there.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.013
And so we're just going to get to work.

19:34.813 --> 19:36.854
One thing I wanted to show you I'm very excited about.

19:36.874 --> 19:41.615
I've got two separate versions of Man and His Future.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.776
One version is the original American first edition.

19:46.156 --> 19:48.137
I don't think this book has ever been opened.

19:48.877 --> 20:05.331
Really, and then I also got this English Version which I mean it's the same book It's printed all they're all printed by the same, but they have different title pages and this one is from a library I Wonder if anyone else has been able to acquire a book.

20:06.092 --> 20:06.913
They're really sweet.

20:07.833 --> 20:08.954
I think after I'm done

20:10.003 --> 20:13.487
I don't know, admiring them and stuff, I'm probably going to send one to Mark.

20:13.547 --> 20:19.113
I just, I've started to have a sort of affinity for old books now.

20:19.874 --> 20:24.399
Since the start of the pandemic, I've taken the strategy of trying to get books that are pre

20:25.500 --> 20:27.302
pandemic about a lot of these things.

20:27.382 --> 20:38.950
And then you start to get, you know, I have, for example, a friend of mine, Tao, Tao in Norway, has the guy who brought these two books to my attention.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.512
And these are extraordinary books.

20:41.112 --> 20:48.298
because the ideas that are in these books are actually some of the ideas that are in these books.

20:48.338 --> 20:53.703
And then you start to see that all these people were writing kind of the same ideas down.

20:54.183 --> 21:07.615
Tragedy and Hope back there on the table is another one of those books where when you read it, and you got to read it again and again, I'm on my second read now of that book.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.002
you just see that there are a lot of ideas that are very parallel in there.

21:13.263 --> 21:26.912
And the original, the first chapter of this book is something that at some point, very soon, I think I'm gonna take the time to read aloud as a podcast or as a broadcast, because it's just so good.

21:27.472 --> 21:33.176
And how they talk about how we need to move forward as a race, it's extraordinary.

21:33.956 --> 21:34.317
And so,

21:36.573 --> 21:39.515
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances.

21:39.555 --> 21:42.237
Can you just test for me just to see what happens?

21:42.378 --> 21:45.300
I'm going to do a transition right now, and I'm going to talk through it.

21:45.540 --> 21:51.485
And I want somebody in the chat to tell me whether the audio cuts out during the transition or not.

21:52.465 --> 22:06.872
Somebody was I've been trying to figure it out and when I recorded it's there, but some people say it's not So I'll start reading this and then I'm gonna transition over to the corner and you tell me whether this audio It's already lagging a little Anyone else have that problem?

22:06.892 --> 22:14.015
I don't think it should be Give me a little sound check.

22:14.436 --> 22:14.936
It's all good.

22:14.956 --> 22:14.976
I

22:16.431 --> 22:17.431
Yeah, okay, good.

22:17.691 --> 22:19.692
So let's do this transition.

22:19.752 --> 22:25.054
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

22:25.534 --> 22:26.395
Did you hear that all?

22:26.795 --> 22:27.355
That was fine?

22:27.975 --> 22:29.276
Did I lose that on anybody?

22:29.876 --> 22:35.118
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and I can't do my weatherman thing.

22:36.078 --> 22:37.079
RNA, all good.

22:37.139 --> 22:37.579
Okay, great.

22:38.395 --> 22:39.576
RNA cannot pandemic.

22:41.197 --> 22:44.439
You know, so GigaOM Biological is the escape key that everybody needs.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.681
And yes, that's really my keyboard here.

22:48.442 --> 22:48.702
See it?

22:49.002 --> 22:50.323
And it's really got that key.

22:50.743 --> 22:55.366
You can actually order keys online with your own design for like a dollar.

22:55.727 --> 22:57.788
So don't think it's like some kind of fancy thing.

22:57.828 --> 22:59.729
I think I had to order three, so I paid $8.

23:00.090 --> 23:04.513
It's extraordinarily cheap actually, but what you gotta know

23:05.433 --> 23:22.820
is what first you got to have a keyboard that has those keys and then you got to know which row you're in which i didn't understand at first but each row has a different shape of key um it's subtly different and so you could put the wrong row there but it wouldn't match well anyway i digress

23:25.525 --> 23:36.729
A couple days ago, we had on a guy by the name of Dan Cohen, and I really strongly recommend that you listen to that and ponder the ideas that we discussed there.

23:36.789 --> 23:44.572
Not necessarily take them all on board and start sharing them with the rest of the world, but just take them on board for yourself.

23:44.672 --> 23:47.173
That's what GigaOM Biological is most about.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.234
It's about coming here and trying to be

23:50.475 --> 23:59.384
sort of build up a habit of trying to learn something new every day and see a new way of understanding their illusion.

24:01.226 --> 24:10.616
The spread of bad ideas is really what we are combating here and so yesterday we actually looked at a really interesting video

24:11.617 --> 24:37.831
from the PBS NewsHour that featured a guy by the name of Chris Martinson, who just very like, I guess, eight months ago or so, was on a stream with Kirsch and Bridle and McKernan, talking about the DNA contamination and talking about what might or might not happen in Canada because the Canada Health people have admitted that it's in there and admitted that it's bioactive and it's SV40 and yada, yada, yada.

24:38.371 --> 25:00.104
And I thought it was very interesting to remind everybody or show everybody that didn't know that Chris Martinson actually got a pretty amazing boost from nothing less than the PBS NewsHour before the pandemic, sort of promoting him as a guy who was aware that money comes from thin air and that's a problem someday.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.506
And that's an interesting,

25:03.803 --> 25:06.165
It's not an anecdotal data point.

25:06.225 --> 25:31.884
It's a real big data point if you think about how also around that same time, people like Brett Weinstein were conspicuously placed in the public eye, running against the administrative powers of a small university and being allowed to speak in front of Congress about the pain that he suffered that resulted in his half a million dollar settlement with Evergreen.

25:32.364 --> 25:50.732
So it's a very similar kind of pseudo promotion, a very kind of, you know, putting all the pieces on the board in place, giving them what appears to be legitimacy before the pandemic so that, you know, when you're following Chris Martinson and he says, wow, this could be a lab leak and they could be covering it up.

25:51.112 --> 25:54.014
You're already on board with the Scooby-Doo because you trusted him.

25:54.054 --> 25:57.015
He was, you saw him first on the PBS NewsHour.

25:59.431 --> 26:01.952
And so it becomes very, very extraordinary.

26:03.253 --> 26:13.917
And I think that if you listen to this gentleman here, I think you're going to find a very interesting set of things.

26:13.957 --> 26:14.978
Let me just make sure.

26:14.998 --> 26:18.399
I want to make sure I get this right here.

26:29.264 --> 26:30.530
His name is Joe, and...

26:35.370 --> 26:38.631
And I'm just going to say his name is Joe, because I guess his name is Joe.

26:39.092 --> 26:42.293
But I'm already in contact with the Liberty Perspective.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.934
The Liberty's Perspective is on Rumble.

26:45.294 --> 26:47.295
He's only got 31 followers.

26:47.835 --> 26:54.298
And if there's anything that you do today, I want you to go and go to Rumble and search for the Liberty Perspective.

26:54.338 --> 26:58.480
You'll find that the top of his channel has a dark bell on it.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.062
And it's just the Liberty Bell there in kind of an overly contrasted image.

27:04.639 --> 27:07.521
And I want you to somehow subscribe to him if you can.

27:07.561 --> 27:18.229
If you don't have an account on Rumble, I guess you can't, but I want to find a way to signal to this guy that he's being seen, you know, and I really think it's worth promoting.

27:18.370 --> 27:30.959
I found it very interesting that he had this, he's got a series of videos that talk about the idea that the language that they use often signals what set of laws they are trying to

27:32.000 --> 27:33.181
they are trying to promote.

27:33.401 --> 27:46.547
And I did not see what he so eloquently shows in these couple videos, where there are people in place all around our health freedom movement that are promoting the UN.

27:48.488 --> 27:58.073
Remember that one of the things that they said on the PBS NewsHour about Chris Martinson yesterday, why did that not work?

27:58.153 --> 27:59.214
Oh, because I was looking at the

28:00.455 --> 28:04.857
Cause I was looking at the, I'm going to, oh, I'm sorry.

28:04.897 --> 28:05.697
I'm going to fail here.

28:06.498 --> 28:09.619
Um, I want to go back one more.

28:10.299 --> 28:10.499
Yes.

28:11.520 --> 28:23.885
Um, the thing about Chris Martinson, when we watched it yesterday, it started right in the beginning that he was a consultant for the UN, a consultant for big corporations and non-governmental organizations alike.

28:26.886 --> 28:28.187
Might've even said hedge funds.

28:30.458 --> 28:41.606
So that's pretty extraordinary because we're really talking about a very small group of interests and people that are being propped up by weaponized piles of money in the background.

28:42.446 --> 28:51.313
There's no way to explain how Chris Martinson, the dissident, is on the PBS NewsHour before the pandemic, except that he was there.

28:51.333 --> 28:51.953
I mean, that's not...

28:54.107 --> 29:03.074
That's not any, there's no other way to explain it any more than there's a way to explain how Alex Jones has been made to appear as though he's kind of legitimate again.

29:03.494 --> 29:11.261
And then Robert Malone and, and, and, and Bobby Kennedy and, and, and Brett Weinstein all do interviews with him.

29:11.301 --> 29:12.281
I mean, it's just crazy.

29:12.902 --> 29:14.423
I don't know if Bobby Kennedy did, did he?

29:14.683 --> 29:15.044
I don't know.

29:15.224 --> 29:15.644
I'm sorry.

29:15.764 --> 29:18.066
I might've made that, that might've been, I might've made that up.

29:22.324 --> 29:25.787
So the Liberty perspective, you can see a picture of CHD here behind me.

29:26.287 --> 29:30.430
You can see Mary Holland there, and you can see Bobby Kennedy standing there.

29:30.450 --> 29:36.415
And then you can see some clown in the background who looks like a giant that's holding his fist in the air.

29:40.558 --> 29:44.601
I want to play this guy's video, because I think he's seen something that I haven't seen.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.763
And I think it's really important for you to see it.

29:46.783 --> 29:48.164
I don't know.

29:48.384 --> 29:48.885
But anyways.

29:52.210 --> 29:53.011
Get down through here.

29:53.812 --> 29:56.315
We see this right here that all these judges are just thinking.

29:56.355 --> 30:05.566
Oh, this is a grand old freaking this human rights shit It's taking over our freaking Constitution is just wonderful all this collectivism just freaking taking over our Constitution Just great.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.748
You got expert presenters in here.

30:07.768 --> 30:12.274
You got all these guys in here They're all

30:13.171 --> 30:36.611
human and constitutional rights person, international law people, okay, NYU person, these are all NYU people, it's an NYU organization, okay, more human rights, human rights, human rights, global, global justice clinic, this is that guy from the, oh, and look who we have here, the coordinator, Mary Holland, research scholar and director, graduate lawyering program.

30:37.752 --> 30:41.435
Isn't she, well, let's look down here.

30:42.284 --> 30:43.225
Who's Mary Holland?

30:43.925 --> 30:46.667
This is from the defender, Children's Health Defense, right?

30:47.707 --> 30:54.691
Children's Health Defense puts out Mary Holland, JD, is the president and general counsel of Children's Health Defense.

30:57.793 --> 31:02.295
I just seen her on, you know, you see her around.

31:02.576 --> 31:05.717
They just had a big meeting down there about stuff that was going on.

31:06.278 --> 31:08.579
Saw her on the Shannon Joy show, Shannon Joy.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.360
You know, um,

31:12.790 --> 31:29.484
But there's some things that piqued my interest on her, and I just wanted to dig into her, just to see who the hell she was, because some things that aren't jiving with me, as far as, she's supposed to be a medical leader in the medical freedom movement, okay?

31:29.524 --> 31:39.692
She's calling things out here and there, but I don't know what it is, I just wanted to look into her, and I find out she's involved in all this human rights stuff, and I just wanted to show you what human rights are.

31:40.993 --> 31:41.674
So here she is.

31:43.001 --> 31:47.703
Okay, Mary Holland, President and General Counsel for Children's Health Defense.

31:47.863 --> 31:54.947
She's been writing and advocating for better vaccine laws and policy, served on a faculty of NYU school from 2002 to 2019.

31:55.347 --> 32:11.035
I saw somewhere where she was from either Harvard or Columbia too, but relatively, they got this, and she wrote a brief to the American

32:11.821 --> 32:18.165
European Court, sorry, European Court of Human Rights by Mary Holland, okay, in Children's Health Defense.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.387
March 19th, March 19th, 2020.

32:23.468 --> 32:31.232
Relatively, quote, relatively few Americans realize that lawsuits related to human rights in Europe can ultimately be heard in international court.

32:32.673 --> 32:40.437
Well, if you follow the philosophy through, all human rights laws can be held in international court under the, you know,

32:41.027 --> 33:04.695
Universal Declaration of Human Rights says right in there, one of the articles, I can't remember which one, people have a right to an international order in which the human rights can be, you know, realized.

33:06.809 --> 33:10.931
So in theory, it doesn't hold just for European humans, you know?

33:11.151 --> 33:12.552
But anyways, thank you.

33:15.933 --> 33:17.694
So... This is funny.

33:18.174 --> 33:18.775
His dog.

33:19.555 --> 33:21.356
Sorry, P. It's my dog growling at me.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.757
Tony, I've been doing this for an hour, all right?

33:24.077 --> 33:25.838
I'm sorry, P. Maybe you're a jerk.

33:25.858 --> 33:28.579
Here you go, baby.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.781
She gets sick hearing me talk about this shit, too.

33:34.246 --> 33:43.870
But anyways, people must first file cases regarding individual rights in their home countries.

33:47.091 --> 33:53.213
Children's Health Defense strongly supports the rights of individuals to make voluntary choices regarding vaccines.

33:54.994 --> 34:02.335
Children's Health Defense brief cites the Nuremberg Code and the 2005 UNESCO Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.

34:03.036 --> 34:04.276
Why would they cite UNESCO?

34:05.136 --> 34:05.336
Ha!

34:06.536 --> 34:07.697
I was wondering the same thing.

34:07.717 --> 34:08.937
I mean, that's what I was wondering.

34:09.257 --> 34:10.177
What the hell are they getting out of?

34:10.717 --> 34:12.237
But anyways, they got this star down here.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.598
We'll get to that in a second.

34:15.658 --> 34:16.358
Okay, February 28th, 2020.

34:16.398 --> 34:16.478
She...

34:22.105 --> 34:31.088
She, uh, wrote an object, a request for amicus, uh, third party intervention, Mary Holland, general counsel and vice chair of children's health defense.

34:31.108 --> 34:32.428
Okay.

34:32.749 --> 34:32.989
Cool.

34:33.029 --> 34:41.371
Vaccines are pharmaceuticals, pharmacological preparations capable of providing the body with acquired active immunity.

34:44.612 --> 34:44.953
Okay.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.373
Medical freedom movement.

34:47.994 --> 34:49.234
We're up against the fricking,

34:51.945 --> 35:14.498
massive public-private partnership pushing the narrative of pathogenic viruses or whatever which we need all these vaccines for and she's saying vaccines are for pharmaceutical preparations capable of providing the body with acquired active immunity by stimulating the production of antibodies against certain pathogens.

35:15.138 --> 35:18.600
So she's pushing the narrative.

35:19.452 --> 35:40.027
right out of the gate she's pushing the narrative yeah all this but you know they can and do provide immunity in some individuals but they are also known to be ineffective in some and cause injury and death in some compulsory vaccination violates fundamental human rights

35:47.014 --> 35:50.477
Is she familiar with the collectivism behind with the human rights?

35:50.517 --> 36:10.052
Is she familiar with the social contract theory, the collectivism and the social contract theory that says no right can be considered outside the context of the duties owed to society and that all rights are,

36:12.483 --> 36:22.308
only yours only so long as they serve the collective, as they serve the society at large.

36:25.729 --> 36:29.491
And that if the sovereign or the prince says that you should die, you should die.

36:29.511 --> 36:34.354
It's Rousseau, you know, social contract right there.

36:35.334 --> 36:35.974
But anyways, um,

36:38.328 --> 36:42.793
Vaccines are pharmaceutical preparations capable of providing the body with acquired active immunity.

36:43.714 --> 36:46.617
They can and do provide immunity in some individuals.

36:47.237 --> 36:48.519
Pushing the narrative, man.

36:48.939 --> 36:49.860
Pushing the narrative.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.462
Okay.

36:51.502 --> 36:56.467
This, this case involves the rights and health of individuals, families, and public.

36:57.585 --> 36:59.947
I want you to note that in blue, individuals, families, and public.

36:59.987 --> 37:00.968
This is her writing this.

37:01.008 --> 37:11.739
The grand chamber must decide whether the Czech Republic's compulsory vaccination law exclusively for children complies with the European Charter of Human Rights.

37:13.741 --> 37:16.564
Czech law, like similar laws in other countries.

37:19.527 --> 37:20.488
What's going on here?

37:21.420 --> 37:49.373
in other countries affects the right to life, the right to informed consent, the right to freedom of religion and conscious, the right to... I would just posit the question if anybody knows or was aware that Mary Holland, in her capacity as vice chair and chief or general counsel of CHD, was writing statements in the context of European law.

37:52.503 --> 38:12.650
I wonder how many big funders of CHD understand that that's where her time and our money, their money is going, to writing statements which support UNESCO as a set of laws or ideals that we should all think about instead of working under the pretense that the U.S.

38:12.710 --> 38:14.911
Constitution is the supreme law of the land.

38:17.904 --> 38:25.986
adopting this language around human rights instead of our rights in America, the Bill of Rights, the constitutional rights.

38:26.526 --> 38:34.068
Instead, we're talking about human rights, which is now a different, amorphous topic, which is now being defined by these people.

38:35.469 --> 38:37.969
A limited spectrum of debate defined by what?

38:38.049 --> 38:39.910
The European Union, the UN,

38:41.949 --> 38:43.450
UNESCO is the UN, right?

38:43.510 --> 38:45.752
So there's human rights are defined by the UN.

38:45.832 --> 38:49.775
Your human rights laws can be tried in the international court.

38:49.835 --> 38:51.176
So now, oh, wow.

38:51.256 --> 38:58.661
What if I'm a human rights violator if I spread misinformation about RNA virology?

39:00.262 --> 39:01.703
The UN could come after me then.

39:05.290 --> 39:06.791
not trying to make up things here.

39:06.932 --> 39:08.773
I'm just trying to show you where he is.

39:09.234 --> 39:11.516
He is leading you to see what's going on.

39:12.096 --> 39:14.438
They are not fighting for us.

39:14.599 --> 39:31.014
They are participating in this theater, which legitimizes the who, legitimizes UNESCO, legitimizes referring to those things as being, you know, authorities or a collection of texts that needs to be understood.

39:34.721 --> 39:47.200
And that's pretty extraordinary because I wonder if we can find any evidence of Mary Holland being a internationally skilled lawyer and with international law expertise.

39:50.942 --> 39:52.003
I just, I don't know.

39:52.143 --> 39:56.006
I think he's got something very big here and he's onto it in the right way.

39:56.467 --> 40:06.115
And he's come to the sea, the alien from a completely, I mean, obviously this is not an academic biologist who's recovering from 20 years of having tried to get tenure.

40:06.676 --> 40:10.479
This is a completely different dude, but he sees it exactly like I do.

40:12.160 --> 40:18.446
Bodily autonomy, the right to education, parental rights, and the right to equal protection and the right to due process.

40:20.302 --> 40:29.889
Thus, what appears on its face to be a simple balancing test between the individual and society is in fact extremely complex.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.693
It's very hard to decide between individual rights.

40:35.433 --> 40:47.342
Actually, it's made pretty simple by the collectivism because the balance between the individual and society and the collectivism that the human rights comes from, it simply says those individual rights are collective rights.

40:48.160 --> 40:53.984
and they're only yours to the point that they benefit society at large.

40:55.385 --> 41:00.149
As soon as- This is the real model of public health, exactly what Joe just said.

41:00.189 --> 41:12.498
This is the model of public health that if you go back almost four years ago, we heard in several different videos, Tony Fauci's wife, Christine Grady, describe in detail.

41:14.477 --> 41:23.620
a community health model, a communist health model, a societal health model, a public health model.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.860
These are all the same.

41:25.460 --> 41:30.862
Your duties to the society as a whole, you must protect them.

41:30.902 --> 41:34.543
We have to weigh the individual rights with society.

41:34.563 --> 41:39.344
You see, that's the argument that they want you to engage in.

41:41.169 --> 41:44.971
that Meryl Nass wants you to engage in, that Mary Holland wants you to engage in.

41:45.011 --> 42:00.157
They want you to actively argue about that instead of realizing that, wait a minute, before the pandemic, there was no debate about society rights or societal rights or societal needs versus the, in America, we don't do it that way.

42:01.138 --> 42:02.478
I don't know how it is in Canada.

42:02.518 --> 42:03.759
I don't know how it is in the UK.

42:03.779 --> 42:08.021
I don't know how it is in the EU and the rest of those countries, but I know in America,

42:09.127 --> 42:13.230
Technically speaking, legally speaking, we don't do it that way.

42:13.310 --> 42:17.733
Individual rights are the thing here.

42:18.514 --> 42:20.996
The liberty of an individual.

42:24.138 --> 42:25.659
So it's very, very cool.

42:25.759 --> 42:26.540
This is Joe.

42:26.620 --> 42:28.641
This is the liberty perspective on Rumble.

42:29.562 --> 42:30.563
I think you should check him out.

42:31.343 --> 42:37.408
It benefits society that you, if it's been deemed by the planners that you need to get the jab.

42:40.234 --> 42:44.518
AJAB, you need to get the JAB and you don't have a social contract.

42:44.798 --> 42:48.040
You have a social contract responsibility to get the JAB.

42:49.622 --> 42:54.686
You don't have a human right to not wear a mask if that's what's been deemed by the planners.

42:57.088 --> 42:59.189
That's what's best for the collective, for you to wear the mask.

42:59.469 --> 43:05.854
You don't have an individual collective right to not wear a mask if it's been deemed what's best for the collective.

43:06.515 --> 43:07.656
Same goes for the JAB.

43:09.093 --> 43:10.574
Same goes for anything else.

43:13.917 --> 43:19.002
Yeah, they play all these fricking games in here making you think, oh, how wonderful fricking human rights are.

43:19.042 --> 43:26.628
They get you to, see, human rights are the synthesis between our fricking real freedom and real rights and full-blown communism, okay?

43:26.908 --> 43:35.656
While you give up your fricking individual rights and your liberty, okay, for the synthesis, the fucking thing is in the middle, which means you basically compromised

43:37.054 --> 43:46.836
everything already, and now you're going to fight for these frickin' human rights over the full-blown communism they actually really are in the end anyways.

43:46.856 --> 43:46.916
See?

43:48.076 --> 43:49.376
He says it perfectly.

43:51.597 --> 43:54.918
This case involves the rights and health of individuals, families, and the public.

43:57.318 --> 44:03.059
What appears to be a simple balancing test between the individual and society is in fact extremely complex.

44:05.500 --> 44:06.900
Convoluted is more likely.

44:07.501 --> 44:09.762
I think convoluted would be a better word for that.

44:10.262 --> 44:20.747
But anyways, to make voluntary choices regarding vaccines, the Children's Health Defense Brief, Cicenderenberg Code, and the 2005 UNESCO Declaration of Bioethics.

44:23.468 --> 44:25.129
Bioethics in human rights.

44:26.670 --> 44:31.212
And this is, I bring it down here, this is that bioethics in human rights.

44:31.632 --> 44:33.413
I'll read you a couple quotes for it.

44:34.582 --> 44:40.804
Remember, I'm pulling out some words in here, principles, ethics, values, social transformation, bioethics.

44:41.305 --> 44:45.086
I'm pulling out different things in here and color coding them so that you can pick them out.

44:47.487 --> 44:53.629
Okay, recognizing that this declaration is to be understood in a manner, this is what she cited.

44:54.110 --> 44:56.991
This is what Mary Holland cited, okay?

45:00.052 --> 45:00.312
Up here.

45:03.115 --> 45:05.996
As a representative of children's health defense.

45:06.776 --> 45:14.119
Recognizing that this declaration is to be understood in a manner consistent with domestic and international law in conformity with human rights.

45:14.619 --> 45:16.039
In conformity with human rights.

45:16.079 --> 45:18.540
Have you ever read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?

45:24.437 --> 45:43.914
You can't know what that sentence means unless you've read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

45:43.994 --> 45:52.101
Recognizing that this declaration is to be understood in a manner consistent with domestic and international law in conformity with human rights law,

45:52.580 --> 46:19.438
Recalling that the Constitution of UNESCO, adopted on 16 November 1945, considering UNESCO's role in identifying universal principles based on shared ethical values to guide scientific and technological development and social transformation in order to identify emerging challenges in science and technology, taking into account the responsibility

46:20.859 --> 46:31.444
of the present generation towards future generations, and that questions of bioethics, which necessarily have an international dimension, should be treated as a whole.

46:31.464 --> 46:33.805
All of them should be treated as a whole.

46:34.806 --> 46:39.088
Nothing, no part of the context should be considered without the whole of the context.

46:39.829 --> 46:46.632
Drawing on principles already stated in the Universal Declaration on Human Genome and Human Rights,

46:47.313 --> 46:56.455
the International Declaration on Human Genetic Data and taking account not only of the current scientific context, but also future developments.

46:59.035 --> 47:01.796
Okay.

47:01.856 --> 47:05.557
This is what she was referring to there, that she cited.

47:05.697 --> 47:16.359
Aware that human beings are an integral part of the biosphere with an important role in protecting one another and other forms of life, in particular animals, okay,

47:17.130 --> 47:18.350
Where have we heard that before?

47:18.670 --> 47:20.491
That's your collectivist One Health approach.

47:20.871 --> 47:21.171
Okay.

47:21.571 --> 47:26.313
She's literally citing that she's drinking the Kool-Aid on the One Health approach right there.

47:26.673 --> 47:26.973
Okay.

47:28.033 --> 47:38.416
Recognizing that based on the freedom of science and research, scientific and technological developments have been and can be of great benefit to humankind in increasing inter-alien.

47:39.980 --> 47:40.781
Don't know what that is.

47:41.181 --> 47:55.197
Life expectancy and improving the quality of life and emphasizing that such developments should always seek to promote the welfare of individuals, families, groups, or communities and humankind as a whole.

47:55.217 --> 48:01.544
That's right out of her Mary, Mary Holland.

48:02.003 --> 48:07.644
individuals, families, and public, literally, almost verbatim, right out of that thing that she cited.

48:07.684 --> 48:11.425
So she's showing she's drinking the Kool-Aid on this stuff.

48:11.966 --> 48:19.567
Promote the welfare of individual, family, groups, and communities and humankind as a whole in the recognition of the dignity of the human person.

48:19.947 --> 48:21.928
Doesn't this kind of sound like Russell Brand?

48:21.968 --> 48:24.669
Constitution doesn't protect people, it protects persons.

48:24.749 --> 48:25.669
Remember personhood?

48:27.003 --> 48:33.526
and universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

48:33.927 --> 48:42.591
Again, you don't know what this human rights observance of human rights is unless you've read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

48:43.272 --> 48:45.553
I did a show on the difference between

48:47.938 --> 48:54.382
I did a show on the difference between human rights and our natural, endowed by our creator, individual rights and liberty.

48:55.023 --> 48:56.163
And you should really watch that.

48:56.243 --> 48:57.264
I go down through it.

48:57.384 --> 49:00.446
I show it through collectivist doctrine on how it's different.

49:00.806 --> 49:10.152
So, if you want to look into this more, I go into how they're actually different even in more detail on that show.

49:10.172 --> 49:14.215
You can look it up on the Liberty Perspective, you know, it's home site on Rumble.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.524
And I'll show all my shows on that.

49:16.544 --> 49:17.665
You can find it right there.

49:18.585 --> 49:20.526
This guy's got to have more views, man.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.167
It's got to happen, my friends.

49:22.287 --> 49:23.868
Please get this guy more views.

49:23.928 --> 49:24.549
Check this out.

49:25.489 --> 49:29.592
So if we go over here to the, this is Man and His Future.

49:29.652 --> 49:35.735
Hopefully I will not rip a page of this book on camera again, like I did with my old encyclopedia.

49:35.775 --> 49:39.538
This is just taken out of The Future of Man, Evolutionary Aspects.

49:40.098 --> 49:43.180
It is the introduction that's written by Julian Huxley.

49:44.175 --> 49:45.717
I'm just going to read this paragraph here.

49:46.158 --> 49:57.896
Of course, I could continue on, but there's a PDF that's available online, and I really profoundly urge people to spend a little time every day reading.

49:58.863 --> 50:12.351
No more social media tidbits or whatever, but spend 20 minutes in the sun, on your porch, in your bedroom, in the morning before you look at a screen, have a book, and read something from it.

50:12.371 --> 50:15.993
It doesn't have to be the same book all the time if you're not that way or you can't do it.

50:16.473 --> 50:22.797
It just has to be an excerpt, something that gets your mind going with the written word, with the printed word.

50:23.317 --> 50:25.919
The world has become a unit de facto.

50:27.111 --> 50:35.922
Sooner rather than later, it must become a unit de jour, I don't, not sure, by submitting itself to a unitary system of self-government.

50:37.304 --> 50:43.392
Since the human habitat is one and indivisible, its resources must be explored as a global whole.

50:44.867 --> 50:59.680
And since thought knows no frontiers, the ideas of every kind are diffusing faster and faster all over the world's surface, demanding recognition, posing questions, generating conflicts.

51:00.657 --> 51:16.349
And so I think you can imagine how this is going to describe how the control of information and ideas and the careful curation of them is going to be the way that they can achieve the goals that they want to achieve.

51:16.389 --> 51:20.692
This is all the same, unfortunately,

51:21.761 --> 51:42.113
It appears to be, from my perspective, all the same kinds of themes that are hidden in the background of these people that get promoted to the top of these places so that they are effectively sabotaged from doing anything useful and instead play a integral role in getting these ideas out there over the years.

51:42.193 --> 51:47.696
And in fact, that document being written at the beginning of the pandemic in February and March of 2020 is very bad.

51:52.208 --> 52:00.055
I don't know, but anyway.

52:01.376 --> 52:03.457
So the question is, are we still in the car with them?

52:04.778 --> 52:07.501
And the answer is, of course, yes, definitely we are.

52:07.801 --> 52:11.864
And we are affecting the way that these performers behave.

52:12.665 --> 52:13.986
They were already off script.

52:14.567 --> 52:19.751
They were already responding to our work much more than I think we probably imagined.

52:20.808 --> 52:23.294
And here is a wonderful example of how that's going.

52:23.335 --> 52:27.786
This is Sasha Latapova, the mother of a

52:30.510 --> 52:51.538
daughter who I believe, while she was a minor, had a YouTube channel with many hundreds of thousands of followers that was promoted before the pandemic by Alex Jones, who now claims to be a dissident who is opposing Robert Malone and getting in arguments with Lynn

52:51.898 --> 52:53.679
Flynn on Twitter.

52:54.259 --> 52:59.821
But these people were all part of the same traveling circus for a while in 2023.

53:00.501 --> 53:01.982
So it's pretty dubious to me.

53:02.442 --> 53:12.365
And it seems much more likely that these are simply manufactured rivalries, fake rivalries like, like, like, like, you know, World Wrestling Federation type stuff.

53:12.706 --> 53:15.947
And it's interesting, because here's Sasha promoting the idea

53:16.647 --> 53:23.531
that I guess bioweapons are made and deployed, biotoxins sprayed over the area.

53:23.571 --> 53:33.156
This can be done by plane or drones, you know, because for the first year or so that she was visible, it was exclusively batch story.

53:34.197 --> 53:40.160
She didn't have anything to say about RNA virology in general or gain of function being a mythology at all.

53:42.202 --> 53:57.597
And in fact, a lot of the times that she's been touring the world, do you realize that this woman has spoken four times to the Coronavirus Investigational Committee in Germany?

53:57.778 --> 53:58.618
Four times?

54:00.821 --> 54:01.641
I mean, come on.

54:02.679 --> 54:06.602
She's been everywhere, like on Shannon Joy a few times.

54:06.662 --> 54:11.907
Like, this is not, this is just obvious at this stage that we're being played.

54:13.008 --> 54:24.418
Just like it seems as though she let her minor daughter be used to play hundreds of thousands of people before the pandemic, which is really frightening to me as a parent.

54:25.959 --> 54:30.083
And here she is now doing a little show together with Kevin McKernan.

54:30.950 --> 54:37.655
but at the same time also doing a show where they disagree about stuff and argue about stuff.

54:41.257 --> 54:58.530
And I believe that her job is to kind of absorb some pieces of the biology that we've been teaching with a kind of way of discrediting them with her other activity or just because of her record as a parent before the pandemic.

54:59.210 --> 55:02.894
so that whenever they want to, they can torpedo anybody that's associated with her.

55:03.695 --> 55:12.205
And in the meantime, she plays this role of, I don't know what, I guess somebody screaming over there while someone else is screaming over here.

55:12.245 --> 55:14.187
And so she makes a lot of noise.

55:14.247 --> 55:15.068
That's all she does.

55:16.135 --> 55:21.878
And each time she makes noise, she makes a little more noise that seems to be related to our work.

55:22.058 --> 55:33.064
A couple months, three months ago, she decided to finally, or rather her handlers, decided that it was okay or she needed to absorb the Giordano video.

55:33.665 --> 55:37.667
At some point, she said clones was a great idea to me, just like Jessica Rose did.

55:38.615 --> 55:46.280
But at a certain moment, they realized that that narrative that I was pushing was not a narrative where they released clones and then the clones went flying all around.

55:48.221 --> 55:50.242
And that didn't work for them anymore.

55:50.322 --> 55:53.164
So they had to torpedo me and their relationships with me.

55:53.224 --> 55:55.285
And so this is what you see happening now.

55:55.345 --> 56:03.170
This clown show will continue to go on and they will continue not to address the fundamental concerns that we have.

56:03.630 --> 56:05.311
They'll just use some of the words.

56:06.783 --> 56:13.545
They're not actually going to start to summarize all the points and connect all the dots.

56:13.605 --> 56:15.345
I mean, that would be ridiculous.

56:15.905 --> 56:28.549
But they need to get into a position, like she did two years ago, where she could get in front of Craig Pardecoper and take over the story of the different batches, just like she got in front of

56:29.289 --> 56:40.078
Catherine Watt and her very detailed presentations about the legal traps that we're in and summarized it down to the DoD and Catherine Watt said it's the DoD.

56:40.779 --> 56:53.830
And then getting really mad because she has Catherine Watt's, you know, I guess Catherine Watt has approved her representation of her on the internet because she herself is not on the internet and then claims that people are attacking her.

56:56.917 --> 57:01.262
Let me make very clear, Sasha Latapova, if she's an American citizen, she's also a traitor.

57:03.365 --> 57:14.798
And the evidence is in her parenting style, as exhibit A being her daughter and her daughter's activity on the internet before the pandemic.

57:14.858 --> 57:15.940
I mean, I rest my case.

57:18.595 --> 57:21.977
that there's no more, no one should pay attention to her.

57:22.057 --> 57:24.719
No one should be subscribed to her substack anymore.

57:25.160 --> 57:28.582
Everybody should let go of this person and stop paying attention.

57:29.062 --> 57:38.469
And anyone that promotes her from here on out should be instantly discredited as either not paying attention well enough or being part of this charade.

57:40.774 --> 57:55.384
just like, I'm sorry to say, but Steve Kirsch should be in that category, Robert Malone should be in that category, Kevin McKernan should be in that category, and we need to work very hard to try and get as many people to see that they belong in that category.

57:55.444 --> 58:01.488
They were part of the worst case scenario operation that was executed on us from the very beginning,

58:02.268 --> 58:10.851
And they got us to believe that we were engaged in a very lively discussion about freedom and democracy and free speech.

58:11.391 --> 58:17.473
And man, oh man, it was terrible because I bought into it just like everybody else.

58:17.513 --> 58:25.096
And when we bought into it, we were part of that illusion of consensus because we were arguing about the same things and debating about the same questions.

58:28.424 --> 58:33.486
And this has been going on for decades, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.

58:33.566 --> 58:40.928
That's why on April 24th, 2020, there's still a video on YouTube of this guy telling you exactly why.

58:41.388 --> 58:47.430
Well, we're going to need some real impressive evidence if they're going to prove it's a lab leak, because right now, basically everything

58:48.730 --> 59:00.274
has an ancestor and so it's probably been around for 40 or 80 years and at some point there was a mutation but there was nobody sequencing it in the background because there aren't sequencing everywhere and it's the FDA.

59:00.414 --> 59:01.794
FDA got to get out of the way.

59:03.194 --> 59:04.015
Watch the video.

59:04.955 --> 59:12.337
There's no other way to explain it now, now that you know that he cut his teeth at the Human Genome Project and got to take IP out of it and make millions.

59:15.950 --> 59:20.271
This guy is in on it from the beginning, in on the controlled narrative.

59:20.671 --> 59:26.312
And I'm afraid there are other people in on the controlled narrative as well, playing a role in this stuff.

59:27.252 --> 59:32.674
I want to remind you that at one point in time, I really thought that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:32.734 --> 59:38.575
was a good guy, that maybe he was, since he was 14, trying to position himself.

59:39.275 --> 59:41.717
to get revenge for his father and his uncle.

59:43.098 --> 59:56.026
I've become less and less convinced of that every day, and as much as I wanted to believe in him for a while, he's never lied to my face, but his behavior in public and what the things that he says are just shocking.

59:56.847 --> 01:00:04.572
This is a transmission from a couple days ago, if not a day ago, and you can see the sponsors of it.

01:00:05.413 --> 01:00:08.354
They range from Amazon to all kinds of fake

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:18.202
cryptocurrencies, and now we're going to listen to him, I believe, say what they've always planned to say.

01:00:19.603 --> 01:00:21.845
And it's disappointing that I have to do this.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:26.648
I'm horrified that I have to do this, quite frankly, because I don't know where this gets me.

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.590
But this is the truth as I see it.

01:00:32.573 --> 01:00:35.215
Please welcome to the stage today's host, Michael Casey.

01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.190
Okay, this is quite a way to close out the day.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.812
Nice to see a nice big crowd of you all here.

01:00:51.072 --> 01:00:59.056
I don't think that our next guest needs any introduction, so I'm just gonna say please join me on stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:10.662 --> 01:01:13.443
Take a seat, sir.

01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:16.621
Okay.

01:01:27.727 --> 01:01:30.428
So, this is Coindesk.

01:01:30.448 --> 01:01:31.369
We're a media company.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.010
We had some news today.

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:37.232
So, as a good journalist, I am going to just go straight at this with a question.

01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:50.662
Keep in mind that one of the games that they've been playing with us since we were a child, since they've been playing this game on our parents, is that they get us fired up about one particular issue, and then they have candidates that get that one particular issue right.

01:01:50.722 --> 01:01:53.123
But they basically step on their own anatomy.

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:56.625
as they walk around other things.

01:01:57.025 --> 01:02:07.172
And this trick is magnificently evident in the stance and nuance and language choice with regard to vaccines.

01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:16.999
And then his almost incredible stance on other things and inability to see how climate change, for example,

01:02:17.899 --> 01:02:27.905
is being used against us in a way that's just absurd and confounding that with, you know, clean water and this kind of thing, which is, of course, something that all of us believe in.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:33.128
And so I've come to see it as really a magnificent, a very malevolent

01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:39.893
sort of shtick that is not very different than what people like Bernie Sanders did to us.

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:44.336
And it is just all one extraordinary show.

01:02:45.277 --> 01:02:57.066
And if you listen to his very succinct explanation to what happened to us in 2020, which I would argue, remember, there are people that wear the t-shirt that say the COVID shots are bad,

01:02:58.476 --> 01:02:59.977
But don't ask about 2020.

01:03:01.057 --> 01:03:01.917
Don't talk about 2020.

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:07.139
And here, we're going to get a very succinct explanation about what happened in 2020.

01:03:07.299 --> 01:03:09.840
And it's pretty impressive how wrong it is.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:19.124
For those who don't know, one of the candidates that Mr. Kennedy is running against was just convicted of 34 counts.

01:03:22.495 --> 01:03:27.736
of a felony, and that is unprecedented in American political history.

01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:37.459
So I'd be really keen to know what that means for you and how you interpret that as a factor in this race.

01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:48.581
Well, first of all, I'd say this was probably the weakest case of the cases that people have brought against him.

01:03:51.847 --> 01:03:56.674
I think it will, my belief is that it will end up helping President Trump.

01:03:57.831 --> 01:04:11.157
among a large part of American public who believes that the judicial system and the enforcement system have been weaponized against politically.

01:04:12.317 --> 01:04:13.978
And that's bad for our country.

01:04:15.078 --> 01:04:17.879
And I think it's a mistake for the Democratic Party.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:26.623
I think the Democratic Party believes that it has a candidate that can't beat President Trump and that they need to do it in the court.

01:04:28.299 --> 01:04:35.185
And that, and I think that's bad for our country, I think it's bad for democracy, and I think it's politically gonna backfire on him.

01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:39.850
You know, I don't, I'm not a fan of President Trump's, I'm running against him.

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:52.641
I'm running against him on the issues, on, you know, what he did, the debt, he ran up an $8 trillion debt, more than all of the presidents in our, from George Washington to George W. Bush combined.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.223
He shut down our country after promising that he was going to run America like a business.

01:04:59.404 --> 01:05:07.049
He shut down all of our businesses, 3.3 million businesses with no due process, no justice compensation, no scientific citation.

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.952
He embroiled our country in foreign wars.

01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:20.218
He divided the division that we have in our country is now largely to him and President Biden, and it's not a good thing for our country.

01:05:23.064 --> 01:05:28.691
And then his positions on the environment, et cetera, have been bad to me for our country.

01:05:28.711 --> 01:05:37.201
But I think that's what the election should be about, about arguing about those issues and not trying to eliminate people.

01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:40.505
I mean, the Democratic Party is trying to eliminate me.

01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:46.210
Okay, so now he's going to talk about himself, and we don't really need to listen to that.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:52.191
What we need to hear, of course, is that he says that it was the weakest case brought against Trump.

01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:56.752
Presumably, there are other cases that were brought against Trump that he's trying to remind us of.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.392
I find it very interesting.

01:06:01.552 --> 01:06:08.834
I've been told by a couple of my friends that it's absolutely probably just going to be eaten by the Supreme Court.

01:06:08.854 --> 01:06:09.454
It might even be

01:06:11.414 --> 01:06:20.661
you know, a lot of justices that agree that you didn't expect to agree that what they they're doing in New York City is ridiculous, our way in New York State is ridiculous.

01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:22.223
Now, again, I'm not a lawyer.

01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:22.763
So whatever.

01:06:23.944 --> 01:06:27.247
Bobby says it will help Trump and then the issues of what he did.

01:06:28.355 --> 01:06:31.878
what he says in that thing, which I find very interesting.

01:06:32.898 --> 01:06:38.903
He says that he increased the debt more than any other president.

01:06:39.883 --> 01:06:43.966
I guess that would be Warp Speed and the CARES Act, right?

01:06:44.026 --> 01:06:44.687
Is that what it was?

01:06:44.707 --> 01:06:51.351
I mean, we have to figure that out.

01:06:51.391 --> 01:06:53.032
I guess Warp Speed and the CARES Act.

01:06:55.149 --> 01:07:04.751
And he said he shut down America with no evidence, no whatever, no just compensation for the businesses.

01:07:04.811 --> 01:07:07.652
I'm not sure what the PPP program was.

01:07:07.692 --> 01:07:11.792
There was something about payroll, something or other, but I don't remember.

01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:15.053
But anyway, so he's blaming Donald Trump.

01:07:15.153 --> 01:07:16.933
And I'm not gonna argue this.

01:07:16.993 --> 01:07:19.154
I mean, obviously Donald Trump is the president.

01:07:21.024 --> 01:07:33.027
But I remember in 2020 a very big state by state debate because it's actually the states that decide and that the federal government couldn't really close anybody down.

01:07:33.067 --> 01:07:35.608
They could only recommend and the states had to do it.

01:07:36.088 --> 01:07:45.531
So it seems like this is kind of a disingenuous representation of what was actually going on in the media and probably behind the scenes as well in the Trump administration.

01:07:47.284 --> 01:07:54.489
It's very, very extraordinary, actually, that he says that he got us involved in foreign wars, which I'm not sure what he means there.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.590
It's not very specific at all.

01:08:02.438 --> 01:08:05.979
And then he divided the country, but the country was already divided.

01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:12.582
I mean, I know that there are some people that really don't like Trump, but they were already really not liking Republicans.

01:08:12.642 --> 01:08:18.324
So it's not, they just had a, somebody just adjusted the focus on their magnifying glass.

01:08:18.364 --> 01:08:20.125
And so the point of focus got hotter.

01:08:20.185 --> 01:08:20.565
That's it.

01:08:21.025 --> 01:08:27.728
I don't think it necessarily changed, you know, anything about the system and then his stance on the environment.

01:08:27.748 --> 01:08:29.849
So this is very extraordinary to me.

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:45.279
Because he's also seeming to take a pretty noncommittal stance on what Biden has done or hasn't done and what they did since Trump left office or didn't.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.641
And that's also very, very extraordinary to me.

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:55.388
Yeah, I don't know how to say it any other way than I find that very extraordinary.

01:08:55.408 --> 01:08:57.470
I'm going to let this play out just in case there's some more.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:59.852
It's impossible for me to get on all the ballots.

01:09:00.112 --> 01:09:01.514
I don't think that's democratic.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:11.904
When I grew up in a Democratic Party, I was trying to get as many Americans as possible enfranchised, get them to vote, get them legally to vote.

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:17.009
And now we have a Democratic Party that's trying to disenfranchise voters and to try to

01:09:18.373 --> 01:09:24.659
push candidates off with legal actions in the courtroom rather than the ballot box.

01:09:25.139 --> 01:09:30.184
Let's say they succeed in doing that, what kind of country are we left with?

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:41.114
We're left with a country where half the people are deeply embittered and angry and feeling like they've been screwed.

01:09:43.539 --> 01:09:45.561
And I don't think that's good for our country.

01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:47.082
This was a jury decision, right?

01:09:47.282 --> 01:09:48.483
This was a jury.

01:09:48.523 --> 01:09:49.324
This was not a judge.

01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:50.524
This was 34 counts.

01:09:50.544 --> 01:09:52.006
It was a very rapid decision.

01:09:52.026 --> 01:10:01.093
Do you yourself believe that the judicial system has been weaponized, or is your concern that there's a perception of this?

01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:04.475
I think the federal agencies generally have been weaponized.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.598
I mean, I'm being denied the Secret Service protection.

01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:10.080
The Secret Service itself

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:37.428
said that i'm at a enhanced risk and you know they had they had plenty of evidence and including you know four break-ins to my house as the election occurred by people who are mentally ill people have come to my event i gotta i gotta i gotta ask though okay if you

01:10:38.726 --> 01:11:02.775
If you say that Trump allowed the fake pandemic, at what stage would you forgive Trump for an illusion of consensus that actually included everyone?

01:11:06.121 --> 01:11:16.064
Did you really expect Donald Trump to learn virology quick enough to know that all those executives talking about antibodies were essentially lying to him?

01:11:16.504 --> 01:11:29.628
That all those pharmaceuticals, he should have known maybe, but Tony Fauci too, and Birx and Redfield, they all agree that there are viruses that go around the world all the time.

01:11:29.688 --> 01:11:31.748
We don't track them, but we're tracking this one.

01:11:32.309 --> 01:11:33.169
Could be a lab leak.

01:11:34.505 --> 01:11:37.266
Might be the worst case scenario, a billion people are dead.

01:11:37.306 --> 01:11:38.687
That's what Kevin McCarran said.

01:11:39.767 --> 01:11:41.148
They were running out of oxygen.

01:11:41.188 --> 01:12:01.657
They needed to get an oxygen generating ship to pull into New York City in order to have enough oxygen for all these people that we needed to be given high flow nasal oxygen because of their low pulse ox, according to Pierre Cory and Kyle Seidel.

01:12:03.806 --> 01:12:15.079
I understand he's the commander-in-chief, but if I was the commander-in-chief at the time, I wouldn't have known enough virology to know that these people were lying to me.

01:12:19.158 --> 01:12:21.781
And so I'm not absolving Trump of anything.

01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:27.588
I'm saying that with enough traitors in the right place, there wouldn't have been anything Trump could do.

01:12:27.668 --> 01:12:31.952
Remember, the emergency is not declared by him.

01:12:32.013 --> 01:12:35.156
It's declared by Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:38.199
And so they sort of kind of take control at that stage.

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.324
And they had a guy in charge that already knew how to do that.

01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:44.826
They had all kinds of people in place who knew how to do that.

01:12:44.886 --> 01:12:57.860
So even if Donald Trump wanted to try and drive the car, it's possible that there were a few fake steering wheels and a few fake gas pedals that he was given before he was able to do anything meaningful.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:26.860
And so to just summarize what Trump did as running up the debt, shut down America, ruining businesses, even though he promised to run America like a business, got us into foreign wars, divided the country, and has a bad reputation for the environment is a pretty disingenuous way of summarizing a terrible illusion of consensus that spread across both sides of the aisle, the red and the blue, that agreed that there was a novel virus that millions were danger from, dying from,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.921
and needed to be saved from.

01:13:31.564 --> 01:13:33.105
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:33.145 --> 01:13:45.457
went and spoke in Germany to tell everybody that the lockdowns were bad, the mandates were bad, the takeover of our rights was bad, but not that they would lie in order to do those things.

01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:51.314
Not that they would have lied over a couple decades in order to accomplish those things.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:51.915
No, no, no.

01:13:51.975 --> 01:13:52.995
It's a real virus.

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.096
It's a real pandemic.

01:13:54.156 --> 01:14:00.981
But we can't let this real pandemic allow them to invert our rights to and sovereignty to permissions.

01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:03.463
That's a very different argument.

01:14:06.277 --> 01:14:12.927
And that's exactly what Joe was showing, the Liberty Perspective guy, in the sense of talking about human rights.

01:14:13.087 --> 01:14:15.571
That's what Bobby was talking about in Germany.

01:14:16.011 --> 01:14:18.195
We all share human rights.

01:14:19.977 --> 01:14:21.600
So I'm fighting for human rights.

01:14:24.622 --> 01:14:39.594
And it gets very, very, very creepy if you realize that that phrase essentially is a backdoor for communism, for collectivism, the exact same stuff that the head of ethics at the NIH, Christine Grady, can only talk about.

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:43.958
She's never talked about Nuremberg or Helsinki or Belfort.

01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:44.438
Never.

01:14:54.542 --> 01:14:55.682
Oops, that should be that one.

01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:56.723
Yep.

01:15:00.944 --> 01:15:05.065
And I'm going to escape because it's not playing for some reason, but I think it will play now.

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:05.726
And I see it's 1228.

01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:08.967
So here's the deal.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.468
I'm going to do this tomorrow, I guess.

01:15:13.188 --> 01:15:14.669
The plan.

01:15:25.512 --> 01:15:40.502
The plan was to cover everybody's good buddy Malik on a podcast in 2024, because I want to see how he presents himself on other podcasts, his story, and how he explains what he did in 2020.

01:15:40.922 --> 01:15:54.491
Because again, I have the feeling that there are a lot of people that have been put in front of us by design who really don't want you to think about what they were up to in 2020 or what any of these other characters were up to in 2020.

01:15:55.632 --> 01:15:57.574
And so I want to see what Malik has learned.

01:15:57.634 --> 01:16:01.498
I want to see what he's learned since he had all of these brilliant people on his podcast.

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:11.428
He must have a pretty well-developed understanding of what's going on with regard to this, you know, Scooby-Doo mystery and all these liars.

01:16:11.508 --> 01:16:18.395
I'm sure it's going to be very insightful, but I'm not going to do that right now because I think it's important for me also to

01:16:18.976 --> 01:16:20.977
help my wife with this stuff at home.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.218
So I've already promised to do that.

01:16:23.638 --> 01:16:29.500
Ladies and gentlemen, it is very, very few things that are more dishonorable than misleading the young.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:38.463
I believe these people and others willfully and unwillingly and wittingly and unwittingly and knowingly and unbeknownst to them

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:44.534
are participating in this misleading of our young people.

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:51.279
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:59.104
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:16:59.525 --> 01:17:03.608
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:17:04.028 --> 01:17:05.189
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:13.376
I'll be on again tomorrow, I think at 10 o'clock, and we'll do that follow-up thing and maybe a couple other random samples.

01:17:16.038 --> 01:17:20.101
We got to keep the pressure up, so I think we're going to start doing a Saturday show for a few weeks.

01:17:21.442 --> 01:17:22.643
It's possible that I'll

01:17:24.401 --> 01:17:36.633
I'll balk on that only because, again, Saturday's a family day for us, Sunday's a family day for us, but the schedule of everybody else on Sunday makes it easier than Saturday.

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:39.576
It's not a Sabbath thing.

01:17:39.636 --> 01:17:45.022
I would like to take one weekend day off for my kids and for my wife.

01:17:46.463 --> 01:17:54.188
But sometimes we've got to put a little more pressure, so I think I can find an hour to do that study hall tomorrow.

01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:56.069
So thank you very much for joining me.

01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:58.671
If you like what you see, please share the stream.

01:17:59.051 --> 01:18:03.034
You can share it from stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:18:03.234 --> 01:18:09.318
That also shows up in Twitter as an embedded video, so it's a good way to share it on Twitter.

01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:10.999
It's much better than sharing

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:33.642
The twitch stream which will actually not gets won't circulate on Twitter because it's a it's a link that leaves the platform Whereas stream dot giga home dot bio and those links don't leave Twitter and so then Twitter likes those better So one of the benefits of sharing from that is to share from there and if you want to support my work like so many people

01:18:34.894 --> 01:18:38.643
I don't even know what to say to some of you that have stepped up.

01:18:39.385 --> 01:18:42.352
You can go to gigoandbiological.com and we really appreciate it.

01:18:42.372 --> 01:18:43.013
Thank you very much.
