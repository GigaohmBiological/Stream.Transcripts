Testing 1, 2.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.558
Test 1, 2.

00:06.438 --> 00:06.678
Test 1, 2.

00:06.979 --> 00:08.559
This is GigaOM Biological.

00:08.619 --> 00:09.580
Test 1, 2.

00:11.561 --> 00:12.001
Testing 1, 2.

00:15.083 --> 00:15.603
Got it.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.923
Test 1, 2.

00:17.104 --> 00:17.904
There he is.

00:17.924 --> 00:19.585
I finally made it in.

00:22.126 --> 00:23.086
Can you hear me yet?

00:24.827 --> 00:26.168
Can you hear me yet?

00:31.297 --> 00:36.860
Oh, I got to move my camera really have to sit over here just to be in the middle.

00:42.163 --> 00:44.044
Just a little to just move it a little.

00:45.724 --> 00:46.885
Maybe you can't hear me yet.

00:47.145 --> 00:47.485
Hello.

00:47.525 --> 00:47.926
Hello.

00:48.546 --> 00:49.686
Testing one, two.

00:51.708 --> 00:52.388
Now you can hear me.

00:52.708 --> 00:53.528
Okay, great.

00:53.568 --> 00:53.949
Hello.

00:54.629 --> 00:54.929
How are you?

00:55.469 --> 00:59.612
I've been I've been talking to you for like, since you joined in 45 seconds ago, and then just realized you can hear it.

00:59.712 --> 01:00.152
It's all good.

01:03.007 --> 01:03.688
Yeah.

01:03.908 --> 01:06.590
I mean, I can do it like like this, I suppose.

01:08.492 --> 01:10.533
I suppose this would work, then you don't have to move your camera.

01:10.654 --> 01:10.814
Right.

01:10.874 --> 01:13.015
I just do it like this instead of the close up.

01:13.196 --> 01:13.476
I don't know.

01:13.836 --> 01:14.717
Oh, no, I don't mind.

01:14.797 --> 01:15.938
I can I can switch.

01:15.958 --> 01:16.778
Oh, you can move it easily.

01:16.818 --> 01:17.719
I mean, it doesn't matter to me.

01:18.340 --> 01:18.900
I really don't care.

01:19.260 --> 01:19.801
OK.

01:21.442 --> 01:22.783
Yeah.

01:22.823 --> 01:23.644
Are we live on your end?

01:23.864 --> 01:24.284
Yeah, we are.

01:25.065 --> 01:25.345
OK.

01:25.726 --> 01:27.227
OK.

01:27.627 --> 01:28.848
You want me to pause it quick?

01:28.888 --> 01:29.248
I can.

01:29.288 --> 01:29.869
It's no problem.

01:31.081 --> 01:31.862
It doesn't really matter.

01:35.064 --> 01:36.425
I mean, nobody's watching me.

01:36.506 --> 01:39.188
I mean, it's only the people that follow me every day.

01:39.268 --> 01:40.249
Otherwise, it's nobody.

01:40.429 --> 01:42.731
I haven't gained a follower in many, many months.

01:43.771 --> 01:49.456
Actually, I probably gained followers since the redacted thing in a way that I've never gained followers in years.

01:50.237 --> 01:50.917
Well, that's awesome.

01:51.698 --> 01:52.919
They even cut a clip of it.

01:52.959 --> 01:56.862
I don't know if you noticed that, but they cut a clip and put it on their own Twitter and stuff.

01:57.042 --> 01:58.844
It's quite remarkable, actually.

01:59.634 --> 01:59.854
Yeah.

02:00.154 --> 02:00.955
Yeah.

02:01.975 --> 02:12.300
They they found, you know, what what I was saying and the clip of you and compelling and as anyone who's an honest actor would and should.

02:12.560 --> 02:23.805
And so I hope there's a lot more of that and we can collaborate and and get your message out there more and start challenging, you know, this elaborate

02:24.866 --> 02:25.246
PSYOP.

02:26.027 --> 02:28.608
Yeah, I wish we had a better name for it.

02:28.648 --> 02:33.509
I think a lot of people always get turned off by these words that the other team also uses.

02:34.169 --> 02:35.690
What, of PSYOP?

02:35.710 --> 02:40.492
Yes, PSYOP and conspiracy theories and fifth generation warfare.

02:40.512 --> 02:46.214
It's frustrating because of course it's kind of like, you know,

02:47.216 --> 02:49.697
You got to choose one of their weapons in order to fight them.

02:49.777 --> 02:56.359
But we've got to sort of in a way invent our own set of descriptive tools.

02:56.499 --> 02:57.620
I've noticed that you do that.

02:57.820 --> 03:00.061
I mean, illusion of consensus, these kinds of things.

03:00.081 --> 03:04.022
And then I noticed, you know, and I know you're I mean, we're not we're not live on my end.

03:04.282 --> 03:05.903
You know, I'm not recording on my end yet, but.

03:06.806 --> 03:08.727
you know, I noticed that got taken.

03:08.907 --> 03:11.848
Isn't that Bhattacharya's podcast name?

03:12.029 --> 03:12.709
Yeah, we take that.

03:12.929 --> 03:13.989
So yeah, no, I can't.

03:14.370 --> 03:19.112
I can only claim that I was using it on slides before him and that he was a friend of mine.

03:19.152 --> 03:20.553
I don't know if he stole it or not.

03:20.633 --> 03:27.076
I mean, you know, I mean, yeah, it's not I can't be the first person to have said those three words together.

03:27.916 --> 03:28.836
Yeah, of course, of course.

03:28.936 --> 03:39.941
No, but I mean, I think, you know, one of the things that I think I've seen you do and I'm trying to do myself at least is provide analogies for people to understand it.

03:40.881 --> 03:44.343
You know, that's I think that's really useful in having.

03:45.883 --> 03:53.206
Memorable ways, you know, whether it's your what it's, you know, some of the analogies that I've seen you use that I thought were really useful.

03:54.907 --> 03:57.468
Well, now my I was just thinking of them now, my brain just

03:58.300 --> 03:59.302
I got it.

03:59.803 --> 04:00.263
It's all good.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.888
I really hate, for example, these kinds of things.

04:02.948 --> 04:10.400
But but anyway, we can talk about that in the, you know, I mean, I think I think, you know, my my like lighter and, you know, my my

04:10.902 --> 04:14.864
they yell yelling fire in a crowded theater, these kinds of things.

04:14.904 --> 04:17.745
So then people I think it really helps people conceptualize it.

04:19.105 --> 04:32.570
What has been done to them and and how it's all worked, because it is it's extremely elaborate and it's it's like a house of mirrors, you know, and and you think you're out of it and turns out, you know, you're still in it and you're oh, man.

04:32.610 --> 04:34.951
So it's it's really it's very challenging.

04:35.051 --> 04:38.953
And I mean, one of the things, you know, that I notice is like

04:41.784 --> 04:54.411
Myself, I got so much wrong at the beginning, and pretty much everybody got stuff wrong at the beginning, even if they were the greatest experts.

04:55.151 --> 05:10.379
And if your analysis hasn't changed over time as you've gotten new information or noticed patterns or figured things out that you were not aware of or were caught up in, if you haven't changed, then I don't believe you, basically.

05:11.525 --> 05:40.148
I mean, I would I would be willing to bet that if you reflected on your own personal, you know, stories that are closest to your heart, like Haiti or Israel, I bet you would find very similar things where actors or people that have been in prominent had a prominent voice in these arenas of debate have surprisingly made surprisingly little progress in their ability either to communicate their position or for it to evolve in any meaningful way.

05:41.367 --> 05:54.097
And that was what I find extraordinary with my own experience in this, what is oftentimes, you know, grossly overgeneralized as a anti-vax movement and now a health freedom movement.

05:55.979 --> 05:59.642
I've had this experience with a lot of people that no matter what,

06:00.746 --> 06:16.354
new evidence or new set of circumstances presents itself, they still seem to be stuck in a sort of, I don't know what the right word is, if it's a paradigm or just a concept that they can't let go of.

06:16.554 --> 06:29.041
And as a result, at some moment you could see it as being bullheaded or stubborn, but after years and years and now it has to be, at some point you come to accept the fact that there's something else happening there.

06:30.345 --> 06:36.511
I mean, there's, yeah, the question, you know, there's definitely witting actors and there are a lot of unwitting actors.

06:36.571 --> 06:50.785
And I think there's some sort of psychological phenomenon that, I mean, I've seen this in different issues that, you know, when it's just like one guy saying that this is all phony or whatever.

06:52.765 --> 07:08.360
people are you know there's a big price to speaking out socially it's like a psycho it's like a social phenomenon um and if you are like you know you have x hundreds of thousands on twitter or this or that and you have your people and your dm groups and like

07:09.702 --> 07:13.825
then do you really like want to upset that?

07:14.025 --> 07:20.009
And, you know, all of a sudden you're going to be out of those DM groups or signal groups, like in your case, you know, with this stuff early on.

07:20.029 --> 07:22.370
But there's but that's not only in this COVID thing.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.291
And so it's if you do that.

07:25.652 --> 07:30.696
you know, as long as it's just like one or two voices that, you know, people can dismiss as crazy.

07:31.077 --> 07:31.717
That's one thing.

07:31.817 --> 07:38.863
But when the hegemony starts to be challenged, then it's, you know, more people will come out and feel safer.

07:39.624 --> 07:44.308
So, I mean, I've seen that in a number of things, and I hope that

07:45.888 --> 07:52.174
You know, we can start to shift the thing here because I mean, you're doing great work for a small audience.

07:53.495 --> 07:57.960
But I want to try to get your message out there and wake people up.

08:01.428 --> 08:04.670
This is I mean, this is one of the things that I'm going to say when we record.

08:04.770 --> 08:11.913
I want to say on record, but it's like the one of the questions like what they asked me on redacted is how did you get in touch with Jake?

08:12.553 --> 08:16.495
And that's and that's, you know, like what led me to reach out to you.

08:16.835 --> 08:25.219
And basically it was a process of being able to ask the right question, because once you have the right question, then that can lead you to the right answer.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.841
So, you know, I when I contacted Danny Rancourt,

08:29.221 --> 08:34.724
who, you know, I know I was I saw your criticism of his work, which I find compelling.

08:35.104 --> 08:37.185
And it's something I think he should be asked about.

08:38.566 --> 08:41.968
But I said, Danny, I really I'm sorry.

08:42.088 --> 08:44.789
I really suspect that there actually wasn't a pandemic.

08:45.389 --> 08:56.655
And, you know, in his position was, well, it doesn't really matter if there's a pandemic because none of it would have been justified if, you know, none of like it doesn't matter if it's possible or not.

08:56.715 --> 08:57.636
It wouldn't have been justified.

08:58.176 --> 08:58.296
And

08:59.264 --> 09:06.006
I don't really agree with that because that's how they that's how they justify it.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.046
You know, you open the debate.

09:07.086 --> 09:09.007
And so anyway, he he connected me.

09:09.427 --> 09:10.907
He suggested I get in touch with you.

09:11.047 --> 09:16.249
So my process is basically I mean, there's a there's a whole bunch of it.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.369
But how did I get to reach out to Jake?

09:18.389 --> 09:19.670
He's a very interesting story.

09:19.690 --> 09:23.731
But I don't want to get into that in like that's something maybe I should

09:24.318 --> 09:38.989
I don't know, I'd rather for this recording that you and I just, I just basically get right to you instead of like a 15 minute, or maybe I'll just try to record something after, like a quick thing and put it up front.

09:39.049 --> 09:39.630
I don't know, but.

09:40.750 --> 09:48.817
I mean, I'm fine with you pushing the button right now, just start recording and, but I, I think the, the goal of getting a first,

09:50.160 --> 09:56.666
let's say, meaty 20 or half 20 minutes or a half hour as best we can, I think is a good idea.

09:56.866 --> 10:04.032
And so I'll try not to say too much about who I am, other than a very short through the corner kind of explanation.

10:04.753 --> 10:08.476
With that book, with that book in mind, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.577
And exactly.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.959
And then, yeah, yeah.

10:13.109 --> 10:15.111
Yeah, I mean, that's basically the question I'm going to ask.

10:15.172 --> 10:19.617
And so like, um, but then we can use that as like a jumping off point.

10:19.657 --> 10:23.341
So anyway, I have, I have a few questions written and then we can just take it anywhere.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.824
Um, so, okay, I'll start recording.

10:27.366 --> 10:28.087
Awesome sauce.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.222
All right, Jay, thanks a lot for doing this interview.

10:43.683 --> 10:52.829
First, so can you first tell me how you became involved in the COVID question and the lab leak theory?

10:54.591 --> 10:56.572
Yeah, very, very short story.

10:56.652 --> 10:59.454
First of all, thanks very much for finally having me on your show.

10:59.494 --> 11:01.716
And I don't mean that in a derogatory way.

11:01.776 --> 11:06.219
I mean, just like, wow, how long we've known each other and how long this whole narrative has been going on.

11:08.058 --> 11:15.741
how long it's taken for, I don't know, for all of these stories to become believable and relevant enough.

11:17.061 --> 11:19.742
I think it's really remarkable.

11:20.022 --> 11:23.884
I have to plead the, I don't know what the right thing to plead is.

11:23.924 --> 11:31.967
I have to plead ignorance in the sense of at the start of the pandemic, I was a academic biologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, minding my own business.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.929
I was struggling to get tenure somewhere.

11:35.949 --> 11:45.996
I had been dragging my wife and family around the world based on my career that was eventually going to take off, you know, when I got tenure or got on the tenure track.

11:46.056 --> 11:50.739
And so in the meantime, we had been scraping by as postdocs.

11:50.819 --> 12:02.727
And, you know, I basically understood biology as anyone else understood biology in academia before the pandemic, you know, DNA and the Human Genome Project and all that stuff.

12:03.789 --> 12:11.080
And so when the pandemic started, I accidentally found myself riding my bike to and from work.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.427
And I had been doing journal club on my bike.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.530
So I was talking about neuroscience papers.

12:17.570 --> 12:17.911
That's my

12:18.547 --> 12:19.408
That was my field.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.469
I was a neurobiologist.

12:20.509 --> 12:27.895
And so I was talking about papers that I was sharing with my students on my bike ride and making a YouTube video of it.

12:28.695 --> 12:37.082
That's kind of a story in and of itself, but I had been recording for safety reasons and eventually discovered that I could hear my voice on the camera.

12:37.102 --> 12:42.586
And so I just started putting YouTube videos up and it started to become an excuse for me to edit videos.

12:42.626 --> 12:43.227
I was having fun.

12:44.764 --> 13:08.542
And actually, if you want my honest, absolutely naked opinion or admission on this, one of the reasons why I thought it was so cool was because I thought that, you know, maybe teaching on social media and becoming some kind of noteworthy social media person might make me uniquely appealing to a faculty that wanted to have, you know,

13:09.262 --> 13:12.406
a lecturer that also, you know, did stuff online or something.

13:12.747 --> 13:14.989
I just imagined that, well, who else is doing this?

13:15.049 --> 13:15.991
Nobody was doing it.

13:16.051 --> 13:21.037
So I thought it would be a good idea as a way to make my CV more appealing.

13:21.097 --> 13:26.423
Again, only thinking about achieving tenure, which had been my goal for like, you know, 15 or 16 years.

13:28.309 --> 13:39.073
Um, and so when the pandemic broke out, I did three bike rides very naively, um, about coronavirus and what I could read in a couple of weeks.

13:39.554 --> 13:42.475
Um, because I thought, what the heck, I'm going to read these papers anyway.

13:42.535 --> 13:44.556
Why not do journal clubs about these papers?

13:45.436 --> 13:54.460
Um, you know, Michael Osterholm, for example, had gone on Joe Rogan and started talking all kinds of things about all kinds of papers that I had just read.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.560
So I thought, why can't I talk about these papers?

13:56.620 --> 13:57.361
And so I did that.

13:58.414 --> 14:06.704
And that got the attention of the faculty, it got the attention of a newspaper where I was quoted in the Washington Times.

14:06.784 --> 14:14.453
It's not a high-level newspaper like the New York Times, but it is a newspaper that got the attention of the faculty to which I was warned that

14:15.154 --> 14:29.341
they had seen my YouTube channel and I wasn't a virologist and I shouldn't talk to any more newspapers so at that stage I was already pretty impressed and thought wow I must be on to something here and it was very easy for me to convince myself given the

14:30.197 --> 14:34.262
circumstantial circus at the time that this could be a Lably cover-up.

14:34.402 --> 14:48.558
And so I found myself very quickly arguing with faculty members in the hallway about masks and about transmission, you know, R-naught numbers in the New York Times versus the primary literature.

14:49.439 --> 14:53.603
arguing about who Ralph Baric was and wasn't and all this other thing.

14:54.303 --> 15:07.294
And so I think the best way to describe myself would be an unwitting participant in this incredible drama that was a potential lab leak that was resulting in a

15:07.754 --> 15:19.240
pandemic, the worst case scenario, according to some of the people that were talking to me and streaming with me and inviting me to stream with them, the worst case scenario could have been a billion people dead.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.141
And so lockdown was of paramount importance.

15:22.222 --> 15:32.007
And this debate I got all sucked up into because people had seen my bike rides and said, hey, this is a guy who is speaking out, let's talk to him.

15:32.347 --> 15:32.407
Or

15:33.587 --> 15:33.948
Dan.

15:34.468 --> 15:35.730
That's what I was led to believe.

15:36.050 --> 15:45.221
I was also led to believe that I was involved in some kind of Twitter chat group that was an international group of people that was also solving the mystery of the lab leak.

15:45.801 --> 15:47.844
And this group was called Drastic.

15:49.325 --> 15:51.929
And I reviewed all three papers that

15:52.952 --> 15:54.613
were eventually peer-reviewed and published.

15:54.653 --> 16:15.022
They all have my review on them while I was still a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh and so some ways you could even see that as this anonymous group of people on what was Twitter at the time kind of recruiting me and a couple other people like Rosanna Segreto from Canada who also had a faculty position to publish

16:16.338 --> 16:24.444
Papers about the lab leak or the sequence that that belied a lab leak at the time I I didn't know what a fear and cleavage site was it was just thrown at me.

16:24.504 --> 16:35.072
It is obviously Evidence and by the time I could read papers about it and understand what it meant and what it didn't mean That was like three years later And so in the meantime, oh, sorry, go ahead

16:35.839 --> 16:54.914
No, no, let me say, I mean, one thing I think it's important to emphasize how this Twitter group that you became part of, Drastic, was hailed in the mainstream media as a group of like sleuths who were going to figure out that this was from a lab, that there was a lab leak.

16:55.575 --> 16:58.137
And, you know, where was Drastic written up?

16:58.177 --> 16:59.538
I mean, it was it was promoted heavily.

17:00.546 --> 17:07.508
Drastic was written up in Vanity Fair and it was also reported by Tucker Carlson while he was still on Fox.

17:09.389 --> 17:18.951
It was completely, it was reported incorrectly, just to make sure that, you know, we go as quickly as possible with the truth here so that nobody needs to doubt it.

17:19.912 --> 17:27.714
Twitter groups, you know, these DM groups are maintained by the person that establishes the group, so there can only be one person who did it.

17:28.754 --> 17:33.999
DRASTIC was a group that was was assembled by an account named Billy Bo Stixson.

17:34.039 --> 17:49.533
Now Billy Bo Stixson as far as I understand is still an anonymous account on X and is still the administrator of one of the two DRASTIC sites because DRASTIC at some point broke into two groups which you know maybe is a different discussion for a different day.

17:50.731 --> 18:03.721
But the point would be that that group put together by that account was incorrectly described in Vanity Fair and by Tucker Carlson in 2021 as having been started by a Frenchman

18:08.510 --> 18:13.674
by the name of Gilles, oh gosh, Demeneaux or something like that.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.215
I could show you that later.

18:16.016 --> 18:20.098
And Jamie Metzl, which is really a funny name to drop in there.

18:20.139 --> 18:24.822
Jamie Metzl being a futurist and a guy involved in a lot of this stuff before the pandemic as well.

18:25.883 --> 18:30.206
A government official and big cold war liberal kind of cold warrior.

18:30.986 --> 18:31.166
Yeah.

18:31.287 --> 18:32.267
Big interventionist.

18:32.327 --> 18:32.527
Yeah.

18:32.648 --> 18:32.988
But yes.

18:33.810 --> 18:38.052
And so that was a very interesting thing that at the time I went bananas.

18:38.112 --> 18:39.753
I was like, how are we going to stand for this?

18:39.793 --> 18:42.634
We can't let Tucker misreport who we are.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.435
And they were all like, no, no, it's cool.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.196
At least our name got out there.

18:46.216 --> 18:46.936
And I'm like, what?

18:47.497 --> 18:48.597
Our name got out there?

18:48.617 --> 18:50.358
They said it was the wrong guy.

18:50.438 --> 18:51.519
And like, they didn't care.

18:52.699 --> 19:00.764
So at some point in time, I started to really doubt the authenticity of this group of people for a number of different reasons.

19:00.824 --> 19:02.385
Again, that could be a whole show.

19:03.426 --> 19:10.531
But anyway, I decided to go off on my own and one of the things that I thought would be a responsible thing to do as a biologist

19:12.331 --> 19:15.612
was to learn this immunology better than I knew it previously.

19:15.652 --> 19:20.674
So of course I had taken immunology before and I knew all the, you know, the standard note cards.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.934
I could tell you what the note cards said.

19:23.555 --> 19:32.837
But I didn't understand the primary literature and I wasn't as mature of a biologist as I was at this time when I had learned immunology.

19:32.857 --> 19:34.318
And so I thought I'd revisit it.

19:35.058 --> 19:41.542
and especially with respect to what was known about the immunology of coronavirus because this is of course what we're talking about.

19:42.082 --> 19:55.390
And there's quite a plethora of literature out there about RNA virology and RNA viruses and you know respiratory disease and all this stuff and so it's a pretty deep hole that you need to dig and there's a lot of dirt to move but

19:56.832 --> 20:02.176
As a neurobiologist, as an academic neurobiologist, I was not unfamiliar with this task.

20:02.596 --> 20:20.410
I think it's important to know that if you're a skilled biologist in the academic setting, your main goal is to find a place in the quest for knowledge that not very many people are currently mining in that is also potentially going to have a couple of gems in.

20:23.692 --> 20:34.120
Inevitably, you need to read into a lot of different niches, a lot of different corners of the cutting edge of knowledge in order to understand whether or not there's space there for you to work.

20:35.431 --> 20:47.783
And so when you're, especially as a budding academic biologist, you train with somebody and you might be lucky enough to train with somebody that is going to hit the Nobel Prize in like a year or just did.

20:47.883 --> 20:58.073
And so they have so much funding and they have so many different ideas that they can work on that you potentially could be given that little space within which to work.

20:58.573 --> 21:00.135
And because you're given it by

21:01.429 --> 21:28.809
I'm trying to think of a good analogy here, but if you are apprenticing with a known basketball star, and this can get you farther in life, like if you can get an apprenticeship with LeBron James, or you get an apprenticeship with some guy who's just a D3 player, then when you apply for your job as a basketball coach, the guy who apprenticed with LeBron James will automatically seem to carry a little bit more weight.

21:29.349 --> 21:37.333
And I think a lot of this kind of thing is occurring when it comes to thinking about these ideas.

21:37.373 --> 21:40.695
I just lost my train of thought because something walked into the room.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.716
Can you remind me what I was just saying there?

21:44.317 --> 21:45.297
Sorry.

21:47.958 --> 21:56.243
Where you were going as an academic biologist, I mean, I guess, well, here's my question.

21:57.362 --> 22:01.588
How did this lead you to working with Robert Kennedy Jr.?

22:02.348 --> 22:09.297
Yeah, so I want to think about what I was just saying there because I had a point and I don't know why I lost it.

22:09.557 --> 22:10.298
Oh, it's annoying.

22:10.919 --> 22:11.600
I'm very sorry.

22:13.334 --> 22:20.419
Well, the point is that I tried to relearn this immunology, and I really wanted to do what I thought was responsible.

22:20.559 --> 22:30.125
And so, given the fact that all these people were talking about worst case scenario being years, and they were already talking about how my kids were not going to go back to in-person school in the fall,

22:30.865 --> 22:32.147
I had plenty of time to do it.

22:33.268 --> 22:40.417
And the more I learned, the more frustrated I became with what was on TV and what they were saying and what was on Saturday Night Live about antibodies.

22:40.937 --> 22:45.883
And it just started to drive me nuts because I started to realize that this same story had been told before.

22:46.664 --> 22:56.992
It had been told before for the swine flu and for the flu vaccine and for all these different things that I didn't understand were out there and were a problem before.

22:57.753 --> 23:04.398
And so I tried as best I could to stay focused on the idea that, OK, I still couldn't rule out a lab leak.

23:04.538 --> 23:05.879
It still made sense to me.

23:06.600 --> 23:15.406
But my question was, could they use the excuse of a lab leak to do all that they're doing, even if they knew that the lab leak was just smoke?

23:16.586 --> 23:24.489
And so I didn't bother to try and tap into the specifics of the biology because I kind of thought that was a red herring.

23:24.529 --> 23:31.511
And the reason why is because as an academic biologist, I used virology on my bench.

23:31.891 --> 23:42.255
So I have been transfecting animals for a decade already or more, where I take a mRNA, or sometimes it's a DNA in an adenovirus,

23:43.135 --> 23:57.111
and I will put it in a place in the brain and it may have some kind of targeting mechanism or it may just do its thing wherever you put it and it will change the expression of a protein locally and then I use that as a tool.

23:58.052 --> 24:04.058
It could be a label, it could be a switch, a control mechanism, it could be an on switch or an off switch.

24:04.499 --> 24:08.262
There's lots of different things that you can now do with that if I just speak in general terms.

24:08.803 --> 24:21.495
And so I'd been doing that for a long time and when this thing, at the end of 2020, they started to go on TV and Bill Gates in particular really pissed me off, went on TV and started to explain what I knew

24:22.580 --> 24:29.503
was transfection as a next generation vaccine or an investigational vaccine, I went bananas.

24:29.563 --> 24:37.026
And that was the first time where I had a confrontation with someone in the hallway where I felt as though

24:38.348 --> 24:44.412
Okay, you're not, you're not, you're really not listening from the very moment that I speak to you because here's the ding.

24:45.373 --> 24:55.620
At the University of Pittsburgh, it didn't matter whether you were working on monkeys or, or, or rats or mice, the chances are you were using some form of transfection.

24:56.200 --> 25:06.367
The vast majority of the tools that are used on the academic bench for transfection are based on adenovirus, but there are also lots of tools that use a lipid nanoparticle.

25:07.782 --> 25:14.364
Now, the point would be that I went to people that I thought would listen carefully.

25:15.424 --> 25:24.286
And I said that, look, they just went on TV and they explained what we use on our bench, what we buy from our suppliers.

25:24.966 --> 25:28.567
They described it as an investigational vaccine, but it's not any different.

25:29.304 --> 25:33.267
In fact, the Johnson and Johnson one is an adenovirus.

25:33.367 --> 25:36.629
And it's one of the adenoviruses that we use in our labs.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.449
It's number 25.

25:37.850 --> 25:38.930
What are we doing here?

25:39.551 --> 25:41.532
Are we really going to not speak out?

25:42.272 --> 25:47.436
And most of them would not say, they would just say, it's not, I don't, I'm, I don't know.

25:47.496 --> 25:49.677
I mean, I'm, I don't, it's my, my expertise.

25:50.858 --> 25:55.701
Some of them would say, go far as to say they, well, they must have, you know, tested it.

25:55.781 --> 25:56.722
They must have, you know,

25:57.242 --> 25:59.645
It must be something different about it.

25:59.725 --> 26:06.073
Otherwise, they have some mechanism in their head where they can dismiss it.

26:06.233 --> 26:08.216
They don't have to investigate further.

26:09.077 --> 26:13.582
After a while, I got really exasperated because they were starting to roll it out in old people.

26:13.743 --> 26:14.243
I'm just like,

26:16.148 --> 26:18.729
Healthy old people are now being transfected.

26:18.789 --> 26:20.571
What exactly are we doing here?

26:20.651 --> 26:33.100
I mean, and they rolled out adenovirus first, and I was trying to argue that adenovirus is the, well, I was confused.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.601
I mean, I didn't know.

26:34.621 --> 26:40.285
Adenovirus was the one we were most familiar with, and in the context that I used it,

26:41.127 --> 26:43.048
there would always result in a lesion.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.428
And we can describe that later.

26:44.468 --> 26:48.010
We can, I guess, maybe now just keep going in this train of thought here.

26:48.710 --> 26:57.954
But when you transfect an animal in the context of the work that I do, there is an inevitable immune response in the brain where those neurons will be attacked and destroyed.

26:58.514 --> 27:07.877
So, in order to accomplish the experimental goal that you would always have in an experiment with a mouse, you also need the anatomy.

27:07.937 --> 27:21.021
So, you sacrifice the animal and you preserve the brain and then you do an anatomical reconstruction of where it was that you expressed those proteins and, you know, maybe how bright they were so you can see how many proteins were expressed.

27:21.601 --> 27:23.101
Again, I'm overgeneralizing here.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.922
Anybody with the technical knowledge would know that.

27:25.662 --> 27:27.664
I'm just trying to explain it for the layperson.

27:28.285 --> 27:37.034
And so the point is, is that if you do these transfection experiments, it was already well known that you can't just transfect a mouse and then have this

27:38.140 --> 27:40.642
manipulation that you do be permanent.

27:40.762 --> 27:41.702
That's not how it works.

27:41.782 --> 27:47.366
Instead, you have this window where the manipulation occurs because the protein is being expressed.

27:47.426 --> 27:51.328
And then you have this window where the immune system responds to that change.

27:51.889 --> 27:58.033
And usually that's a detrimental response, usually a lesion or whatever the animals, the neurons are destroyed.

27:58.633 --> 28:04.177
And so if you wait too long to terminate the experiment and sacrifice the animal, your anatomy

28:05.120 --> 28:09.410
will not have neuronal structures in it and that kind of thing.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.515
It'll just have a blank place where

28:12.361 --> 28:13.842
the genes were expressed.

28:13.922 --> 28:20.806
And so that is a well known downside of using this in monkeys, because monkeys are very expensive.

28:20.866 --> 28:34.574
And so if you transfect a monkey, it's pretty much a terminal experiment in about 12 weeks, or you've now permanently altered this monkey by deleting those or some of those neurons that have overexpressed that protein that you wanted to express.

28:34.614 --> 28:36.495
So in other words,

28:39.008 --> 28:44.859
Even at the academic bench, we were kind of still at the cusp of realizing the

28:45.874 --> 28:50.037
methodological and technical limits of this manipulation.

28:50.097 --> 28:56.021
Because again, it was of limited use in monkeys for the simple fact of what happens after you do this.

28:56.061 --> 29:06.088
You can't, for example, make an optogenetic manipulation in the basal ganglia of a monkey and then have it remain stable for the rest of the monkey's life.

29:06.588 --> 29:08.029
That's not how that would work.

29:08.229 --> 29:15.394
And so any experiments where they've done these kinds of manipulation in monkeys, generally speaking, are sacrificed then again

29:16.094 --> 29:27.419
to demonstrate the anatomical specificity of the targeting, justify the conclusions based on that anatomy, but also to avoid this inevitable immune response.

29:27.499 --> 29:37.444
So, going back to this argument with people, with faculty members, if you present this idea to faculty members and then say, you don't want to transfect your grandma,

29:39.425 --> 29:40.625
They didn't grasp it.

29:40.766 --> 29:45.829
I didn't even grasp the full sense of what I was saying at the time, but I knew I was warning in the right way.

29:45.849 --> 29:50.372
I mean, it's only even years later that I understand how right I was about it.

29:50.432 --> 29:57.838
But this was the point where the University of Pittsburgh said you should go home and turn it mail in your badge and keys.

29:57.958 --> 30:05.463
And so I started working very hard to put it on the internet and to teach people what I thought I knew.

30:07.328 --> 30:32.585
Drastic basically kicked me out because they wanted to investigate the origin of the virus and I didn't and I was pretty destitute in April of 2022 so a year Or so after I had been told to go home and more than a year after my brother and parents stopped talking to me because they They assumed that getting fired at the University of Pittsburgh meant I was obviously the jackass.

30:32.605 --> 30:35.146
They always thought I was and so

30:36.627 --> 30:45.149
Yeah, I was, uh, if it wasn't for the belief that my wife had in me and the faith that my, my, my family had in me, I don't know if I would have made it.

30:45.209 --> 30:51.390
I had a few really important, um, viewers at the time also that were, were basically floating my rent.

30:51.751 --> 30:55.331
Um, and, uh, they have remained good friends ever since.

30:55.751 --> 31:02.013
Um, it's, uh, just serendipity really that we were, we were really in trouble and, uh,

31:03.297 --> 31:08.422
In April 2022, I got a phone call, actually two phone calls on the same day.

31:09.343 --> 31:15.489
One was from a guy's voice who I immediately recognized and I fell to my knees in front of my wife.

31:15.549 --> 31:23.536
We were sitting, at the time we had a beautiful house on a hill that we lost because I lost my job.

31:26.184 --> 31:33.350
And we were sitting on our front lawn overlooking this nice neighborhood we lived in and the kids were playing and the phone rang and I picked it up.

31:34.591 --> 31:38.594
And I didn't normally answer non-phone numbers but it was from California.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.230
I heard this voice and I just couldn't believe it.

31:42.830 --> 31:46.471
And I would do an impression now, but it would be not nice.

31:46.511 --> 31:50.052
But just asking, can I speak to Jonathan Cooley, please?

31:50.092 --> 31:52.992
And those words said in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

31:52.952 --> 31:53.332
's voice.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.113
And so I flipped out.

31:55.293 --> 31:56.813
I'm like, yeah, this is him.

31:56.853 --> 32:00.113
Like, oh my gosh, I can't believe you're calling me.

32:00.173 --> 32:01.214
Like, we're going to win.

32:01.294 --> 32:08.075
I was freaking out because I thought at that moment that this was the time that the tide was going to turn.

32:10.101 --> 32:23.484
And about a half an hour later, I got a phone call from Senator Ron Johnson, who basically told me the same thing, that he had just seen my stream and that he really wanted a brief and that this was, you know, this was a big deal.

32:25.685 --> 32:29.606
And of course, we're now here in 2025, almost three years later.

32:29.646 --> 32:31.066
Well, really three years later now.

32:32.806 --> 32:36.467
And nothing has really happened that I imagined would happen.

32:37.207 --> 32:39.408
And I'm about as disappointed as I've ever been.

32:40.590 --> 32:54.114
Not in the sense of I'm suffering and my family's out in the street or something like that, but just that I I'm sure that this truth is not mine I'm sure that this truth was out there before me.

32:54.174 --> 33:09.319
That's what's only reason why I'm I'm still fighting because I finally Figured out that there were people that came before me that the same people that are now Pretending not to know who I am even though they've all at one point in time told me they thought I was great

33:11.218 --> 33:22.124
These people also stood in front of somebody else as well named Brandy Vaughn, who had a lot of the same big biological ideas that I've come to by myself or on my own with a lot of wandering.

33:23.185 --> 33:27.707
She already had nailed down before the pandemic in 2015 and 2016.

33:28.647 --> 33:31.049
And I just wasn't aware of her.

33:31.149 --> 33:33.350
And maybe more importantly, I wasn't made aware of her.

33:34.441 --> 33:50.112
But my viewers made me aware of her earlier this year and since then it's really made me feel a lot better about where I'm going and also a little more nervous because Brandy died in the beginning of or at the end of 2020 and under some questionable circumstances.

33:50.172 --> 34:00.900
And so I'm just resting on the laurels that Brandy Vaughn had almost the same language for a couple of key points for me that I think are going to be

34:02.657 --> 34:07.100
I don't know what the right word is, acidic for the narrative that we're currently under the spell of.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.401
I think it's really going to be able to dissolve a lot of it.

34:10.002 --> 34:13.604
And so anyway, I got to work for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:13.644 --> 34:14.805
for about a year and a half.

34:14.945 --> 34:18.547
I guess what I should really say is I worked for Children's Health Defense.

34:18.587 --> 34:19.828
You can see the name right there.

34:21.229 --> 34:26.212
Children's Health Defense publishes their own books with Sky Horse Publishing.

34:27.192 --> 34:33.478
Um, and, uh, so I worked as a, an editor and kind of a guy who helped with the citations of this book.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.260
I'm also quoted in here.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.043
I don't know why he listed me in the cast of characters, but he did.

34:38.063 --> 34:38.623
It's really nice.

34:39.424 --> 34:41.346
Um, and the index even has my name in it.

34:41.366 --> 34:43.048
You can find all the quotes for me in there.

34:44.029 --> 34:44.109
Um,

34:44.995 --> 35:02.728
I did find it a little frustrating, though, working on that book because there are a number of things in this book that are in here under the auspicious of being quotes, even though they remain in there unchallenged.

35:02.809 --> 35:03.689
And so, in other words,

35:04.875 --> 35:19.199
you know, irrespective of whether something might be an exaggeration or maybe a falsification or something that later showed up to be nonsense, what people said and when they said it was kind of the priority of writing this book.

35:20.239 --> 35:28.602
And so even the context of some of the quotes that I've said in here, you know, if I was to be really honest, you know, I don't

35:29.625 --> 35:31.706
they need to be explained better than they're in here.

35:31.726 --> 35:41.949
They're used in a very specific way by the author, where I guess, you know, I aired on the side of, I want to be in the book.

35:42.109 --> 35:44.310
I want my quotes to be able to be in the book.

35:44.370 --> 35:47.711
I want to be able to put some key references in the book.

35:48.712 --> 35:57.275
And I want to make sure that more importantly, certain things about the story are not overrepresented and cannot be exaggerated beyond,

35:58.444 --> 36:00.185
you know, beyond refute.

36:00.445 --> 36:03.327
And so I think I managed to do that.

36:04.307 --> 36:12.932
And I managed to do it in a way that actually ended up with me still being listed on the front page of acknowledgements rather than some obscure place in the book.

36:12.972 --> 36:24.618
And so I think that that's an advantage now, because the biology of RNA pandemics is one that I've come to understand very differently than I knew when I was riding my bike.

36:25.559 --> 36:25.740
Right.

36:25.820 --> 36:28.804
Let me let me let me let me ask you about that, Jay.

36:29.986 --> 36:36.656
So, I mean, I think I'm going to I'm going to pause it for a second, actually, on my side.

36:36.676 --> 36:36.837
Go ahead.

36:39.760 --> 36:46.662
I mean, I think this is the thing is, Jay, I think this is the kind of thing we're going to be able to talk about for hours and hours.

36:46.802 --> 36:47.282
You know what I mean?

36:47.322 --> 36:52.123
It's like we could do several streams and we could do we could like we could talk for six hours right now.

36:52.443 --> 36:56.544
Yeah, but we don't need to because I've got a 10 minute it's a 10 minute elevator pitch from here.

36:57.884 --> 36:58.464
OK, OK.

36:58.565 --> 36:59.505
I mean, I'm just saying.

37:01.685 --> 37:07.827
People are especially going to be I think the hook here is the RFK thing, so.

37:09.372 --> 37:11.674
I would, so I guess what I'll ask you, well.

37:12.235 --> 37:12.795
Okay, go ahead.

37:12.895 --> 37:17.659
No, go ahead.

37:17.759 --> 37:17.979
Okay.

37:18.700 --> 37:36.936
So, so how did you, so in the middle of researching this book, Robert F. Kendi's book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, you came to a radically different opinion that the entire premise of the book

37:37.856 --> 37:42.500
was phony and impossible, biologically impossible.

37:43.341 --> 37:44.162
How did you come to that?

37:44.762 --> 37:47.905
And what did what did he say when you told him?

37:49.647 --> 37:52.569
So all credit to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

37:53.190 --> 37:58.955
First of all, let me be very clear on my streams and in a lot of my other personal work.

37:59.761 --> 38:05.567
I'm very, very vocal about the fact that I think a lot of people go on social media and lie, and they lied in concert.

38:06.748 --> 38:09.911
But in my best evaluation, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:09.952 --> 38:11.093
has never lied to me.

38:12.214 --> 38:18.781
At one point in time when I was teaching him this idea, he said that this was not the book for this idea.

38:20.362 --> 38:25.427
In some ways, you know, you could maybe construe that as saying he understands what I taught him.

38:25.487 --> 38:30.112
I don't want to go so far as to say I know what he knows, but I know that I've tried to teach it to him.

38:30.172 --> 38:33.695
So the reason why I say all credit to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:33.735 --> 38:35.557
is because he's the guy who asked me the question.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.060
And it just so happened that serendipitously I had been

38:40.001 --> 39:07.077
Trying to wrangle this idea or or this idea was stuck in my teeth Let me say it that way for a while and I was trying to understand what it meant and whether or not it was just some fancy Semantic phrase or whether it really meant something and let me give you an example in the lab leak Scooby-Doo mystery that we've been solving there's a villain named Ralph Baric and one of the

39:07.777 --> 39:19.408
you know skills of this villain is that he has this no-see-um technique and the no-see-um technique allows him to stitch molecules together and nobody can see that it was man-made.

39:20.129 --> 39:31.299
Now this is one of those sort of I think kind of magic phrases that makes everybody kind of snap into some enchantment that they not only accept the idea

39:32.000 --> 39:41.583
that there is a need to disguise the stitching of molecules together, otherwise they'll give it away or they'll have fingerprints or something like that.

39:42.084 --> 39:51.387
Not only does that snap you into believing that concept exists, but it also snaps you into believing that there is something that has been solved and that

39:51.927 --> 39:55.349
This Ralph Barrett guy has an exclusive monopoly on this technique.

39:55.810 --> 40:16.462
So it's a very, it's a very deceptive thing that if they wanted to, as a national security state, over many years in meetings and in public shows and on social media, they could seed these ideas in very deceptive ways so that after a decade

40:17.082 --> 40:28.311
The concept of an RNA with special properties that could be somewhere and then everywhere is not unusual that people have been talking about it hypothetically for a long time.

40:29.072 --> 40:34.496
And so there were a lot of there were countless movies about it, about like a about pandemics and outbreaks.

40:34.617 --> 40:38.099
And I mean, there was like there's an entire genre of

40:39.406 --> 40:45.169
a virus escapes from some lab or some horrible accident gone wrong and it, you know, destroys the world.

40:45.369 --> 40:45.549
Yep.

40:45.749 --> 40:48.911
And so this is where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:49.131 --> 41:01.797
is writing this book and we're plugging along and usually my day consisted of meeting with some people who wanted me to check this citation or that citation or find a citation for a, you know, this place that needed one.

41:03.836 --> 41:12.298
Quite frankly, I think that there were three people whose only job was to type the word C-I-T-E in parentheses.

41:12.338 --> 41:12.998
That's all they did.

41:14.719 --> 41:25.361
Anyway, he asked me, and honestly, I don't remember if it was in a Zoom meeting or if it was via email, but he asked me to teach him what infectious clones were.

41:26.286 --> 41:36.655
And so I had been working on this because I realized that this was a theme throughout some of Barrick's papers, through a lot of David Baltimore's papers.

41:37.216 --> 41:51.788
And in fact, a lot of the early papers that are talking about gains in methodological understanding in RNA virology and in DNA virology stemmed around the making of manufacturing of clones.

41:52.614 --> 42:02.360
And so the important, this is an important aspect of the story that a lot of people don't really understand because it has been so often misconstrued.

42:02.960 --> 42:11.325
And so it's the perfect segue, I think for, let me see if I can cut this over here and put this up over here.

42:13.267 --> 42:17.029
I'm just gonna switch really quick and try to explain what's going on here.

42:17.879 --> 42:19.080
with infectious clones.

42:19.680 --> 42:32.226
So when you do virology, especially with RNA virology, very typically what you're doing is you have some kind of host, and I apologize I haven't drawn a bat in a while,

42:33.703 --> 42:35.623
you have some kind of host, right, a bat.

42:36.764 --> 42:39.204
I'm going to leave it there because that's good enough bat for me.

42:40.805 --> 42:43.265
And from that bat, you would get this sequence.

42:43.625 --> 43:00.249
And the sequence is a series of, you know, RNA or DNA, it's actually DNA that comes out of this, this read that they find it could be metagenomic sequencing, or it could be something where they use primers for a very conserved region of the

43:01.009 --> 43:04.972
the genome like the RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

43:05.072 --> 43:18.502
Now, as a layperson virologist, it's important to understand that RNA, when it's found in the wild, is never found in a high quantity.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.564
It's not found in a high purity.

43:20.804 --> 43:26.889
It's found in an incredible array of noise, almost inestimable.

43:27.549 --> 43:30.910
Because you're talking about a single molecule that you're looking for.

43:31.170 --> 43:36.912
And whether or not there are 10 copies or 100 copies, there are not millions of copies.

43:36.992 --> 43:42.493
And none of them, by virology's own admission, are identical.

43:42.773 --> 43:49.135
In fact, somehow or another, they wax intellectual about how identical genomes would be a problem for viruses.

43:49.175 --> 43:50.656
They need to mutate all the time.

43:50.716 --> 43:54.357
But these contradictory ideas end up just kind of

43:56.141 --> 43:59.943
They just kind of destroy themselves when you take them to their logical conclusion.

43:59.983 --> 44:03.984
But what happens in any RNA paper is this is the trick.

44:04.464 --> 44:09.326
They find this sequence, and I apologize, my pen is probably out of ink.

44:11.087 --> 44:14.989
They find this sequence in the wild and what they do is that they reconstruct it.

44:15.029 --> 44:15.829
They just make it.

44:16.949 --> 44:39.188
So if they, for example, find a, you look at any of these papers that, and this is where I learned it, how I learned it, is going back to the papers with Barak and Shi, Shengli Shi, and you look what they did, they will find sequences using any technique you want, I don't care, you use primers aimed at conserved regions, or you use metagenomic sequencing that is

44:40.009 --> 44:48.432
pre-set to find coronavirus sequences that you have already pre-determined are what you're looking for.

44:49.433 --> 44:52.934
And they find those sequences and they synthetically make them.

44:54.174 --> 45:01.377
And I draw a circle like this with a little arrow here because that's what these molecular biologists draw as a little plasmid.

45:01.797 --> 45:03.798
They make a DNA plasmid of it

45:05.051 --> 45:14.576
And then using any number of commercial means, they make a lot of that DNA that represents the original RNA that they claim to have found in the wild.

45:15.937 --> 45:26.202
And now, depending on how they want to do the actual virology experiment, they could take this DNA and make it RNA first, and then put that on a cell culture.

45:28.032 --> 45:47.402
and that would be transfecting a cell culture or they could take this DNA and they could package it in an adenovirus or another kind of virus and they could transform because there is slightly different language for using a viral vector and DNA to change a cell culture.

45:47.442 --> 45:48.643
This is transformation.

45:52.885 --> 45:56.227
And using RNA to do the same thing and that's transfection.

45:58.348 --> 46:09.957
So technically speaking, if you wanted to look at the COVID interventions, the adenovirus should have been called a transformation and the RNA would have been called a transfection.

46:11.318 --> 46:14.920
But already going back to Jesse Gelsinger, they haven't used the correct words.

46:14.980 --> 46:18.303
When Jesse Gelsinger died, they called them gene therapies, just like they did.

46:18.963 --> 46:20.324
now in 2020.

46:20.825 --> 46:26.409
So my point would be is that virology itself is based on this false equivalence.

46:26.489 --> 46:28.331
Now why is this a false equivalence?

46:28.411 --> 46:39.540
Because if I use commercial or laboratory recombinant DNA

46:40.666 --> 46:54.276
To make this RNA or to transform these cells with DNA, I am starting with a DNA or an RNA at a pure quantity that does not exist in nature.

46:55.437 --> 47:01.842
I want you to imagine the worst case scenario for how bad this is because it is that bad.

47:02.443 --> 47:07.867
They do not find a single contiguous sequence in the wild.

47:07.947 --> 47:09.008
Not a single one.

47:09.758 --> 47:16.921
What they find are fragments, and then they assume that these fragments represent what they call the whole.

47:17.521 --> 47:29.945
It would be very similar to finding a small scrap of a book outside, and if it fits into the Encyclopedia Britannica somewhere, then you say that the Encyclopedia Britannica was in your backyard.

47:30.865 --> 47:34.627
And if you choose the right kind of book, or you choose the

47:35.620 --> 47:43.322
the right kind of abundant background signal, then making that claim could just be a wholly manufactured lie.

47:43.842 --> 47:59.685
And so one of the possibilities that happened in the pandemic is that there is a loud, incredibly loud background signal up there, and they have represented that as a very high fidelity signal that they can differentiate from a background when they really cannot.

48:00.512 --> 48:09.938
and in fact most of coronavirus biology is based on this concept that they find a broken fragmented signal they assume

48:11.089 --> 48:16.413
the whole signal, which is again based on fragments that were found earlier, I guess.

48:16.473 --> 48:21.876
I mean, if you try to trace this all the way back, there's just really assumption after assumption after assumption.

48:22.036 --> 48:34.165
And if in five years they have added five more genes to the coronavirus genome because they discovered them now, it'll be very dubious just like this has been so far to assemble.

48:34.185 --> 48:35.385
And you can go all the way back.

48:35.986 --> 48:37.167
I mean, I've tried my best.

48:38.207 --> 49:03.963
Some of the books that I've gone back to are books that are just thrown out of libraries that are that are coronavirus meetings from the Netherlands and other places These these phenomenon are real But how they are represented and more importantly how they have been represented in the past say decade or so Is not and so that's very important to understand because as an academic biologist It has been tricky for me to whoops.

49:04.003 --> 49:04.344
Sorry to

49:04.924 --> 49:08.653
to juggle the to juggle the idea that

49:13.500 --> 49:15.240
that all these people can be so wrong.

49:15.580 --> 49:27.583
There has to be a way to reconcile most of the observations that we've made in the past and most of the observations that are being made now with what we really understand in biology.

49:27.623 --> 49:36.825
It can't just be that everything's a mythology and all viruses are fake and all disease is fake and all health is fake.

49:36.865 --> 49:38.445
And there is a tendency, I think, for the

49:43.001 --> 49:49.042
the operation that we are in to tempt us with those kinds of oversimplified.

49:49.742 --> 49:52.383
I like to say you're tempted with two different things.

49:52.403 --> 50:05.946
You either have to accept a stupid, complicated explanation that you're too unsophisticated to critique, or you have to accept a dumb, simple explanation that is just obviously not right.

50:06.446 --> 50:07.726
And either way, you lose.

50:08.386 --> 50:12.687
And in the biological sense, I think this has been a multi-generational

50:13.843 --> 50:18.728
Operation that's what's so frustrating about it for me as an academic biologist.

50:18.888 --> 50:35.584
I mean why just to flip back here really quick Oops, let's see over here and I want to do this and I want to do this You know this this understanding and this is probably for your viewers that that saw your first show without me To kind of address some of those people.

50:35.604 --> 50:35.825
Hold on.

50:35.865 --> 50:36.265
Let me drink I

50:40.390 --> 51:01.699
The foundation of RNA virology, of coronavirus virology, is that coronaviruses somehow or another have figured out a way to use RNA as a genetic material and exist outside of us, evolve independent of us, and are out there to get us.

51:02.839 --> 51:07.161
And this is so beyond preposterous for the simple fact

51:08.672 --> 51:12.975
that no one would be teaching you evolution if it wasn't for DNA.

51:13.056 --> 51:15.898
No one would be talking about genes if it wasn't for DNA.

51:16.438 --> 51:20.341
Nobody would be talking about heredity if it wasn't for DNA.

51:20.421 --> 51:23.984
Nobody would be doing the human genome project if it wasn't for DNA.

51:24.024 --> 51:32.611
And all of the magical things that DNA has, from a chemical perspective, have to do with the fact that it is double-stranded.

51:33.392 --> 51:36.835
The double-stranded nature of it makes it very chemically stable,

51:37.802 --> 51:39.864
It makes it enzymatically resistant.

51:40.444 --> 51:53.193
It makes it easy to proofread and has the potential for proofreading and error repair over longer timescales than any single chain nucleic acid like RNA.

51:53.853 --> 52:03.921
And so all of the magic that is attributed to everything that we understand or think we understand about the magic of life is not present in RNA.

52:03.981 --> 52:07.103
And yet for some reason, we are being compelled to accept

52:08.410 --> 52:11.695
that RNA itself in a mud puddle can be dangerous.

52:11.895 --> 52:19.607
And in fact, can go from being in a mud puddle to being in the background forever, which is what they tell us happens with coronaviruses.

52:19.667 --> 52:20.949
They go endemic.

52:21.570 --> 52:23.733
And so this concept in my...

52:24.574 --> 52:30.056
you know, very humble opinion as a lifelong biologist, I think it's absolutely bunk.

52:30.156 --> 52:31.356
It's not possible.

52:31.576 --> 52:44.321
And they have no, you know, there's five or six papers about how the XON gene can proofread in coronaviruses, but they have no direct evidence to explain what's going on, how it's happening.

52:44.801 --> 52:49.283
And even their evidence that they purport to suggest gives them some

52:50.123 --> 53:07.077
you know, extra functionality here does not overcome this central problem of what DNA brings to their mythology of biology versus what RNA cannot bring by definition.

53:07.177 --> 53:12.961
And yet we allow it to be the foundation of RNA virology.

53:13.001 --> 53:16.504
And so we've got to rein this in, in the sense of

53:18.826 --> 53:34.965
what they are allowed to claim and how much they claim and that includes you know the manufacture of things and and the release of things and and the only thing they can do is make a lot that's that's that's the trick here and that's the most important thing to understand is that

53:36.733 --> 53:44.815
Any protein biologic, this is just something else I've come to understand only in the five years of learning that I've had to do for the pandemic.

53:44.875 --> 53:48.316
It's not something that I could have told you before the pandemic.

53:48.356 --> 53:52.237
It's probably something that Brandy Vaughn, who used to work for Merck, probably could have told you.

53:52.777 --> 54:06.060
But any protein biologic, so a protein biologic, probably the most common example for people that are listening would be an antibody.

54:08.096 --> 54:12.997
The way that these protein biologics are made, and this is before the pandemic, right?

54:13.037 --> 54:15.377
We were making protein biologics before the pandemic.

54:15.397 --> 54:16.418
This is for sure.

54:17.478 --> 54:27.340
Is that you make the DNA, you grow that DNA in a bacterial culture, and then in any number of ways you go from RNA to protein.

54:28.200 --> 54:32.320
And you can do this RNA to protein step using a commercial enzyme.

54:32.340 --> 54:33.461
You could use it as cells.

54:33.501 --> 54:34.441
You could do whatever you want.

54:34.481 --> 54:35.901
I mean, there's lots of ways that they do it.

54:37.170 --> 54:40.832
But the gist of it is you could even use the bacteria to make the protein.

54:40.852 --> 54:49.697
But at some point, when you make the protein biologic, you have to separate all the manufacturing biological material out.

54:49.977 --> 54:58.002
All the bacterial endotoxins, all the bacterial cell walls, all the bacterial enzymes, all the DNA that the bacteria copied for you.

54:58.562 --> 55:21.677
all the RNA that the bacteria used or the cell culture used to make the protein, all that stuff has to be cleaned away so that you just have the protein because RNA and DNA and bacterial endotoxins and cell culture, fetal cell culture residue is not good for the immunogenicity of your protein biologic.

55:21.757 --> 55:24.179
It's so not good that if the

55:25.540 --> 55:34.844
process by which these contaminants are removed fails, then the entire batch is usually thrown away because you can't really run it again.

55:35.044 --> 55:36.024
It won't work like that.

55:36.785 --> 55:38.085
I don't know the full reasons.

55:38.125 --> 55:40.746
Maybe it's just because it's too expensive to run a batch again.

55:41.967 --> 55:44.828
And so protein biologics are very expensive to make.

55:45.508 --> 55:51.251
And what you'll notice here is that in the middle of this, this manufacturing process is RNA.

55:53.427 --> 56:12.386
And so what I'm suggesting to you is that all pharmacological manufacturing plants that were already making any form of protein biologic already had all the infrastructure, all the culture vats, all of the technicians that were necessary to make the RNA for a mRNA shot.

56:14.468 --> 56:34.538
I think actually the infrastructure or the manufacturing infrastructure to make adenovirus was more closely controlled or let's say, held by a handful of people that were willing to build that infrastructure to make adenovirus because that wasn't a protein.

56:34.818 --> 56:40.621
I mean, adenovirus is not something that's used in medicine very often, so it's really only an academic product.

56:41.201 --> 56:49.723
So that's an interesting thing to spin here, too, because big pharmaceutical companies would have had the infrastructure that could have been easily adapted, i.e.

56:50.203 --> 57:00.224
stopped short, to make the RNA, but comparatively few pharmaceutical companies, in my estimation, would have had the infrastructure to make the adenovirus version.

57:01.605 --> 57:08.006
And so that's a curious little thing to add here, but the point being, again, that this is a well-understood

57:09.385 --> 57:15.309
fact that this contamination was going to be there, that this is a problem that is there.

57:15.329 --> 57:22.913
And that's why I find it incredibly dubious that we have so many people in front of us right now that have the career experience to know this.

57:23.871 --> 57:40.565
to know that they would have been expected not to be able to make a perfect RNA, that any manufacturing technique would have produced flawed RNA, any manufacturing technique would have probably produced DNA contamination and endotoxin contamination.

57:41.105 --> 57:44.768
And so this elaborate show and dance over the last five years

57:45.609 --> 57:54.871
basically, you know, not to sound, but I predicted it because this is what we already knew about the shortcomings of this methodology.

57:55.331 --> 58:05.313
And it's not surprising that if you let a pharmaceutical company make the RNA, that it would be the same as the RNA that we would have used on our, on our bench as transfection.

58:05.373 --> 58:08.953
And so we are in a stage where obviously, darn it, I did it again.

58:09.814 --> 58:11.634
We are at a stage where, uh,

58:13.427 --> 58:20.771
I think the populist right in America has been kind of captured in a health freedom movement that's not real.

58:22.031 --> 58:27.154
And it's something that existed before the pandemic.

58:27.954 --> 58:39.660
It's this, what's really crazy is that it really seems like this same play happened in 1999 in the year 2000 in the UK with Andrew Wakefield and a few of these- Can I pause you?

58:39.700 --> 58:40.341
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

58:41.441 --> 58:43.302
I'm going to pause my side again.

58:43.723 --> 58:45.263
I mean, here's the thing.

58:47.105 --> 58:54.829
This is very engaging for me, but my concern is that... Just steer me back.

58:55.269 --> 58:55.970
It's all good.

58:56.370 --> 59:09.858
Yeah, just for my audience, it's like, what I want is more conversational, so people get to know, you know, Jake, you're like, you're teaching calculus when we would need to be teaching, like, you know, what two plus two is.

59:10.984 --> 59:13.025
you know what I mean, basic arithmetic.

59:14.026 --> 59:18.528
You know, maybe a little bit of, maybe we can get into some like algebra, the first day of algebra, you know what I mean?

59:19.009 --> 59:22.571
So I want to get- No, I don't know why we got on transfection, to be honest.

59:22.631 --> 59:24.011
I don't know if it's your fault or my fault.

59:24.031 --> 59:28.754
Well, I mean, what you said about that is really important, and it's something that I want to talk to you about.

59:28.854 --> 59:38.940
I just fear that like, basically, the other thing is, I think that because you're used to streaming by yourself, and not only you're a teacher, you're a professor,

59:40.441 --> 59:52.411
And that's kind of like your nature and you're so used to streaming rather doing I want this to be like much more conversational Where not that I want to talk much but like where were you know what I mean?

59:52.451 --> 59:54.593
Like you're addressing people who have been

59:55.615 --> 59:59.377
caught up and want to understand the political forces.

59:59.718 --> 01:00:04.401
And probably, honestly, most of the people, like you're casting pearls before swine.

01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:09.064
They're not going to be able to really understand a lot of scientific stuff you're putting out.

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:17.189
I mean, a lot of it, when you're talking about this stuff, I don't have the basic literacy to understand a lot of what you're saying scientifically.

01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:18.990
I don't know how I got there.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:19.530
I just go.

01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:29.540
it's it's fine just ask another question because i i have not gotten to any slides that tells you why we're not we're not really on i mean i mean we're 47 minutes in i which

01:00:33.345 --> 01:00:35.866
Yeah, but you can edit it however you want.

01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:37.347
I'm not worried about that.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:43.170
So if you want to just kind of say that this is where the conversation starts and play this part first, I don't really bother me.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:58.037
OK, yeah, I mean, we could do that, but I'd probably ask you a little bit of the same questions again, because, like, I mean, it's not that I'm trying to get you to, like, denounce RFK, but that's the hook for people because, OK, now he's HHS, he's, you know, Maha, all this stuff.

01:00:58.178 --> 01:01:02.440
But he didn't want to hear what his top advisor had to say, like,

01:01:03.408 --> 01:01:03.490
Um

01:01:04.324 --> 01:01:04.544
Why?

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:05.105
Oh, yeah.

01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:07.026
So that's the only reason why we were there.

01:01:07.066 --> 01:01:12.611
The only reason why we were there is because, you know, we were trying to you're trying to understand what clones are.

01:01:13.432 --> 01:01:31.807
And the point is, is that that when he asked me about infectious clones, you start to realize that that the only thing that the biosecurity state had, the only thing that that the intellectual property market of the pharmaceutical company is based on is this protein biologics.

01:01:32.287 --> 01:01:32.407
And

01:01:34.249 --> 01:01:54.421
So if you see that as the limit of the technology, the limit of the technology in the national security state and also the limit of the technology at the academic bench, and then they just kind of started at the beginning of the pandemic and misconstrued it as something new and novel and investigational, and this is a

01:01:59.004 --> 01:02:06.586
as disingenuous as claiming that there is a new RNA signal out there and we can study it by making a lot of it.

01:02:08.426 --> 01:02:21.289
And so, for me, it was the bridge that got me, was understanding that the molecular biology that I had used on my bench is no different than the molecular biology that these people are using and calling virology.

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:35.807
And at the same time as they're misrepresenting this virology as being very high fidelity, that same technology is now being represented as this new spanking new, you know, innovation that it's not.

01:02:35.927 --> 01:02:43.791
And so both sides of the equation are supported by the same basic illusion that they have something more than synthetic DNA, which they don't.

01:02:44.537 --> 01:02:48.199
Gotcha, okay, so that's why it's it's hard to do that though, right?

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:59.904
It's really hard to do that and it's very very hard for me to get it out in a way that I can remember You know very succinctly where I'm walking I'm trying to I'm trying to do it But you know, it's it's a lot of times do it in total layman's terms.

01:03:00.065 --> 01:03:01.225
Yeah terms is challenging.

01:03:01.265 --> 01:03:04.026
It's Yeah, I get what you're what you're saying.

01:03:04.106 --> 01:03:04.987
I mean, I'm just trying to think

01:03:05.347 --> 01:03:12.295
How would I summarize, you know, if I go on redacted or something again, you know, well, let's take it from a, let's take it from a different spin then.

01:03:12.335 --> 01:03:20.625
I mean, if you, if you ask me a different question, like, um, where I was also going with it in that big picture of, of, um.

01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:24.543
There had to be a biological explanation.

01:03:24.623 --> 01:03:39.616
So not only does there have to be a biological explanation for most of the contents of our biology books, maybe albeit a different interpretation of some of these observations, not all of these scientists are actively creating an illusion and lying about stuff.

01:03:39.636 --> 01:03:43.500
They're making observations and putting them in the wrong context or making the wrong assumptions.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:54.709
And so for me, one of the most important things was realizing, and you mentioned this at the beginning of the program, that what is Denny Rancourt doing?

01:03:54.769 --> 01:04:11.903
Well, one of the most amazing interviews that I ever did was with Jason Levine, where I was able to actually ask Denny live, what do you think about the idea that the population pyramid is contributing to this, that there is a known or anticipated rise in all-cause mortality?

01:04:11.923 --> 01:04:12.623
How could it not?

01:04:13.744 --> 01:04:15.785
I don't know why I didn't think about that.

01:04:16.105 --> 01:04:19.106
I mean, I took classes in college where I learned about population pyramids.

01:04:19.886 --> 01:04:29.810
Well, the crazy part is that I saw a presentation by a guy by the name of Peter Zahan, who talks all about world global stuff, stuff, whatever.

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.871
He's a guy with a beard and mustache, and he's always talking about China dominance.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:35.232
And that was the guy who

01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:41.029
who pointed out population pyramids, but was pointing it out in a completely different context.

01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:47.117
And a light bulb went on in my head like, oh my gosh, this is like an eclipse.

01:04:47.377 --> 01:04:53.705
If you know that this phenomenon is coming and the rest of the people don't know it's coming, you can tell them whatever you want.

01:04:54.346 --> 01:05:01.751
Yeah, it's like my daughter when I, you know, like it's almost like putting something behind my daughter's ear and being like, wow, look what I found.

01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:02.511
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:02.631 --> 01:05:15.399
It is exactly like that, especially if you knew this was coming for a couple of decades and you positioned people with right with all of the necessary, you know, clout and narrative and infrastructure to execute it.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.901
I mean, and then she thinks it's behind her ear all the time.

01:05:19.262 --> 01:05:19.382
Right.

01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:26.296
She's she's like programmed to think to think that, you know, so they really believe.

01:05:26.317 --> 01:05:27.717
I mean, OK, she figures that a joke.

01:05:27.777 --> 01:05:28.998
It's a joke when she gets old enough.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:45.326
But I mean, I guess I think it's actually relevant and important to explain, you know, the way that you that you came to believe or realize that the lab, the lab leak theory was bunk.

01:05:46.156 --> 01:06:07.002
and that therefore the thesis of the Wuhan cover-up was bunk was you know I was I mean I don't want to put words in your mouth I'm just trying to figure out like a way to say that in like a minute and a half or two minutes like imagine if you were on like Tucker or something if he was like J. Cooley come on we got this all wrong like what happened you were like I realize this is bullshit

01:06:07.722 --> 01:06:13.507
because I was using those same tools, you know, as an academic biologist, I was transfecting animals all the time.

01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:14.047
And I knew that.

01:06:14.107 --> 01:06:16.669
And then I realized this can't be because of this and this.

01:06:16.809 --> 01:06:20.772
I mean, I can't say it for you, but like I'm just trying to figure out a way.

01:06:21.775 --> 01:06:22.495
to avoid it.

01:06:22.515 --> 01:06:37.943
And, you know, people can obviously go to your stream and then say, you know, and that's where they can, you know, watch the full kind of get the full treatment where you bust out, you know, the notepad and like explain it in in that level of detail.

01:06:38.003 --> 01:06:48.428
But but I think for for our purposes on this, it's going to be people who are just like they're going to, you know, I think they're going to maybe glaze over.

01:06:48.649 --> 01:06:49.189
Yeah, sure.

01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:49.749
I get it.

01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:50.329
I get it.

01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:51.570
You know what I mean?

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:57.605
I just have to, I don't think, like I said, you can edit it how you want.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:58.966
I don't mind at all.

01:06:59.086 --> 01:06:59.407
And if you.

01:07:00.515 --> 01:07:03.538
If you want to hate, honestly, I don't care though.

01:07:04.118 --> 01:07:04.599
I don't care.

01:07:05.259 --> 01:07:05.980
You don't edit it.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:06.820
I don't care at all.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.162
It's really no, no, no, no.

01:07:08.202 --> 01:07:09.102
I understand that.

01:07:09.403 --> 01:07:11.645
It's just that I don't I don't want to.

01:07:11.805 --> 01:07:13.366
I'm trying to avoid having to edit.

01:07:13.586 --> 01:07:14.247
And I don't.

01:07:14.507 --> 01:07:17.149
And for a couple of reasons, I don't have time.

01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:18.490
I'm working on my documentary.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:24.455
And so what I'd like to do is is get like sort of you and I calibrated where we can have

01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:37.678
like in terms of what the sort of, um, not parameters, but the style of conversation that I think will be most conducive to getting your message out there to a broader audience.

01:07:37.778 --> 01:07:42.419
And then those that want to get the full treatment can go watch your stream.

01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:52.181
And, but I mean, I, but what I guess then how much do you want to avoid saying that, you know, I don't want to speculate on whether, I mean,

01:07:55.143 --> 01:07:57.445
If RFK is the angle, then what's the angle?

01:07:57.485 --> 01:08:03.831
Am I saying that he's ignoring me, or he's being kept away from me, or he's being controlled?

01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:06.254
I don't have an opinion on that.

01:08:06.414 --> 01:08:09.276
I just... Yeah, so you could say that.

01:08:09.296 --> 01:08:10.878
I think that's perfectly fine to say.

01:08:11.038 --> 01:08:12.960
I don't know why he did.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.502
This is what he said.

01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:21.647
You know, but and I can say, well, I think that's a question he should be asked.

01:08:21.707 --> 01:08:29.512
You know, you are I mean, and that's what I was saying in my stream and on the redacted thing and that it's a fair question.

01:08:29.632 --> 01:08:33.875
And more people should listen to what you have to say.

01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:34.915
You know, other like

01:08:37.119 --> 01:08:45.423
journalists and streamers and alternative media, whatever, should be hearing out what you have to say.

01:08:46.763 --> 01:08:48.304
And it's a fair question.

01:08:48.844 --> 01:08:49.664
And like, I don't know.

01:08:50.545 --> 01:08:53.786
And then we can talk about, I mean, I don't know.

01:08:53.806 --> 01:08:55.067
There's a million ways to take it.

01:08:56.826 --> 01:09:21.512
I think speaking in court and sort of brought like with broader painting with broader strokes in a way, well, not not like generalizing, but touching on broader themes than like sort of detailed scientific explanations for this would be more impactful and productive and would drive more to

01:09:23.801 --> 01:09:26.523
would get it out there more.

01:09:26.623 --> 01:09:38.531
And then, you know, like I said, the people that want to go and listen to the full stream, the streams that you do where, I mean, you don't need me to be able to lay this scientific stuff out.

01:09:38.551 --> 01:09:41.533
I'm just sitting here as basically an audience member at this point.

01:09:41.913 --> 01:09:42.373
You know what I mean?

01:09:42.493 --> 01:09:42.774
Yeah.

01:09:43.034 --> 01:09:45.355
I mean, I feel like after I say

01:09:46.636 --> 01:09:51.619
You know, I don't think RNA virology is real as they as they describe it.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:58.102
And I don't think that RNA can can support the biology of RNA doesn't support a pandemic.

01:09:58.142 --> 01:10:01.964
I don't know how to go past that without explaining to people.

01:10:02.204 --> 01:10:02.364
Right.

01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:09.469
how much we already know and have known for a very long time about the limitations of RNA.

01:10:09.649 --> 01:10:20.577
I mean, if RNA could pandemic, the use of RNA in all of these laboratories and the use of DNA with SV40 in all of these laboratories, which is happening all over the world all the time.

01:10:21.698 --> 01:10:28.600
The SV-40 contamination in the Pfizer shot is the first time SV-40 has ever been on earth and made in mass production.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.021
It's used all the time in almost every commercial plasmid that's sold on earth.

01:10:33.622 --> 01:10:41.324
So, to find a signal of SV-40 somewhere and blame it exclusively on some product from Pfizer or somebody else is absurd.

01:10:41.464 --> 01:10:42.464
It's absurd.

01:10:42.644 --> 01:10:43.365
It's absurd.

01:10:43.585 --> 01:10:46.846
It's like saying, I found a Cubs hat in my room.

01:10:46.886 --> 01:10:49.987
Therefore, I know for sure that, you know,

01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:59.394
Now I can't come up with anybody's name, you know, but like Ron say was in my house, you know It's like no he wasn't he's like old and gone, right?

01:10:59.754 --> 01:10:59.954
Right.

01:11:00.535 --> 01:11:16.708
Well, so I think you know that and like when you're I think Like the the cassette tape analogy will be really useful for people because then they can be you know, they can be like, okay this guy Jay Cooley who advised, you know when they're in conversation, they're drinking a beer later.

01:11:16.748 --> 01:11:19.931
They're talking to their wife They're like this guy who advised or helped

01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:23.638
But that's also why I say that thing about evolution, right?

01:11:23.678 --> 01:11:26.725
Because that whole concept of

01:11:27.634 --> 01:11:51.913
Inheritable disease and what you get from your mom and dad and Mendel and and evolution and Darwin was proven right when we found DNA is all based on This wonderful, you know mythology if you will a story of how DNA explains it that the double-stranded nature of DNA explains it all because it's chemically stable because it can be proofread because errors can be fixed and

01:11:52.193 --> 01:11:58.037
And so it's just this unbelievable solves all the problems that we couldn't explain before.

01:11:58.098 --> 01:12:01.340
And RNA fits none of those categories, none of them, zero.

01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:07.505
And yet somehow or another, we're supposed to believe that RNA can go from a mud puddle to in the background forever.

01:12:08.225 --> 01:12:09.146
That's the story.

01:12:09.206 --> 01:12:13.889
That is the idea that if you put a fear and cleavage site, then it'll happen even faster.

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.972
In the background forever, meaning can pandemic, can just be.

01:12:17.072 --> 01:12:18.133
Because that's what it is.

01:12:18.213 --> 01:12:19.354
It's never going to go away.

01:12:20.351 --> 01:12:21.633
That's always going to be there.

01:12:21.693 --> 01:12:29.105
And so we're supposed to believe that this is a process that's ongoing instead of just a background signal that's being misconstrued as such.

01:12:30.006 --> 01:12:31.609
Yeah.

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.811
Okay.

01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:39.739
It's really hard because, again, remember the point is they have a biological phenomenon, a really loud signal.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:49.412
All they had to do was sweep a little bit of it together by death certificate manipulation and murder, and now you have points that they can point to as a disease.

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.700
This is really not that complicated.

01:12:54.460 --> 01:13:00.465
And so when I get into the explanation, I'm really already hearing people saying, yeah, but what proof do you have?

01:13:00.526 --> 01:13:04.088
It's really big ideas that they can't argue against.

01:13:04.169 --> 01:13:05.790
It's not single papers.

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:11.295
It is a fundamental concept as arguing that you go light speed in a Volvo.

01:13:11.355 --> 01:13:12.415
No, you can't do that.

01:13:12.696 --> 01:13:12.896
No.

01:13:13.336 --> 01:13:13.516
Yeah.

01:13:13.897 --> 01:13:13.977
OK.

01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:17.832
OK, so that's good.

01:13:18.153 --> 01:13:18.374
Hold on.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.839
You know, I'm going to run to the back.

01:13:19.879 --> 01:13:20.261
Yeah, sure.

01:13:20.281 --> 01:13:20.482
Go ahead.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.486
OK, so then.

01:14:14.206 --> 01:14:16.847
Just start with a question again, see if we can get a clip for you.

01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:18.287
Or not a clip, but a start again.

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:21.769
I'll just think a little more conversationally and try to stop earlier.

01:14:22.449 --> 01:14:22.829
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:22.869 --> 01:14:30.831
I mean, I think that'll help if it's more conversational and less, yeah, more conversational, basically.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:32.312
I think that'll help.

01:14:32.332 --> 01:14:34.052
I mean, I kind of just want to, like, I mean.

01:14:34.072 --> 01:14:35.573
Give me 20 minutes and see if you're happy.

01:14:35.593 --> 01:14:35.633
OK.

01:14:40.889 --> 01:14:51.931
Okay, let me I mean I kind of just almost I don't know I'd have to like see the beginning again But I almost just want to like I don't want to start over because it's you know, yeah, go ahead though It's fine.

01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:53.292
See if we get another summary.

01:14:53.332 --> 01:15:03.854
You could make it a break after you do your sponsorship or something My I have no sponsorship my wife my there you go I

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:11.367
I mean, the thing is, I don't want to restate the same question I asked before.

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:14.909
How did you get involved in this, you know, question altogether and lab leak?

01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:17.231
And how did you become involved with Kennedy?

01:15:18.792 --> 01:15:19.092
So.

01:15:19.653 --> 01:15:22.915
Well, then just start with.

01:15:23.956 --> 01:15:25.777
So the book came out and then what happened?

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:36.445
Because that's that's basically, you know, where where we were at, if you ask, OK, so you wrote this book with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and then what happened?

01:15:36.485 --> 01:15:37.066
And I can just.

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:48.264
I mean, I guess, OK, well, what I what I want to ask is, I mean, you know, I think if I restate basically the last question, so you wrote this, you helped write this book.

01:15:48.284 --> 01:15:49.905
I just started recording.

01:15:56.487 --> 01:16:02.269
So you helped write Robert Kennedy's book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, and in the middle of writing that,

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:08.460
you came to a completely different conclusion than was presented in the book.

01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:16.803
Not only the conclusion, the very thesis of the book you realized was not true, was biologically impossible.

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:21.944
So can you explain what changed your mind in the middle of that process?

01:16:22.064 --> 01:16:22.804
What happened?

01:16:23.004 --> 01:16:25.685
And when you brought it to Kennedy, what did he tell you?

01:16:28.639 --> 01:16:33.085
Well, it has to do a lot with being a long-trained biologist.

01:16:33.105 --> 01:16:35.508
In the 30,000-foot view, I realize that all of the

01:16:39.764 --> 01:16:42.505
the magical properties of DNA aren't present in RNA.

01:16:42.905 --> 01:16:45.045
And when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:45.105 --> 01:17:01.749
asked me to explain virology and what virology meant by infectious clones, it was through that process that I realized that most of virology was really exaggerated in terms of what they found and then what they were able to do in a laboratory, what they were able to recapitulate.

01:17:03.049 --> 01:17:06.790
Let me ask you, what are infectious clones and why would he want to know that?

01:17:08.202 --> 01:17:21.152
It's a term that's described and referenced in a lot of virology papers where they will claim to have found a virus in a bat and then they will make an infectious clone version of it and that's basically all they say.

01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:28.938
They'll say we made an infectious clone of what we found and then they cite whatever, you know, methodological paper that they

01:17:29.844 --> 01:17:31.446
that has the details of how they did it.

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:42.118
But what that means, you have to track that down, but when you get back to it, you always find out that what that means is they took that sequence that they found in the wild and they made a synthetic DNA copy of it.

01:17:43.135 --> 01:17:45.297
And the reason why that became very significant.

01:17:45.337 --> 01:17:46.358
So let me interrupt.

01:17:46.478 --> 01:17:46.638
Sure.

01:17:46.658 --> 01:17:52.462
You're saying they can take a they can take a bat that they find find in a cave, whatever it may be.

01:17:53.023 --> 01:17:56.145
Take some DNA sequence, you said.

01:17:56.165 --> 01:17:58.507
It depends on what they claim.

01:17:58.567 --> 01:18:03.410
Ultimately, if they're sequencing, it has to be DNA because all sequences are generated from DNA.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.851
There's no.

01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:08.054
Well, until very recently, there weren't very many good ways to sequence RNA directly.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:21.466
So in all of the virology papers that this mythology is based on, they're usually finding an RNA in the wild by first converting all the RNA they find to DNA and then sequencing that DNA.

01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:23.887
That's a technical detail.

01:18:23.907 --> 01:18:24.467
It doesn't matter.

01:18:24.507 --> 01:18:26.728
But yes, ask your question again.

01:18:29.085 --> 01:18:39.469
Well, my question is basically, why would RFK want to know what an infectious clone is and what would be the significance of an infectious clone?

01:18:39.509 --> 01:18:41.910
What did you realize is the significance?

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:44.871
Well, I mean, it's the basis of all virology.

01:18:44.931 --> 01:18:47.312
I think that's what hit him when he's reading.

01:18:47.372 --> 01:18:48.573
And I do think that he

01:18:49.332 --> 01:18:58.427
He tries to read some of these abstracts in these papers and he sees this coming up in the methodologies a lot, that they made an infectious clone to approximate what they found.

01:19:00.327 --> 01:19:08.313
The point being, again, it feels very much like kind of a genuine question that I just looked for a genuine answer.

01:19:08.353 --> 01:19:20.241
But the result of that answer was that an infectious clone is not recapitulating, to use the big word, but it's not replicating what happens in nature.

01:19:20.321 --> 01:19:25.165
And that was something I've tried to explain a lot of times very simply.

01:19:27.326 --> 01:19:28.327
But if you...

01:19:31.504 --> 01:19:54.169
It's it's really hard to explain but what they find in in an animal or purport to measure in an animal is is exclusively an incomplete sequence It is a it is a very noisy signal and assumptions need to be made in order to

01:19:55.476 --> 01:20:21.086
make a consensus sequence and then that consensus like we'll just agree that this is probably what the book reads so for example i mean this is a terrible but it may be okay if you found 30 pages of this book random 30 pages and then you tried to approximate the rest of it based on what you read on those 30 pages you wouldn't get it right obviously you wouldn't get it right but you'd have a book

01:20:21.926 --> 01:20:27.787
And if you wanted to, you could take that book to a printing press and make thousands and thousands of copies of that book.

01:20:27.847 --> 01:20:31.008
Now, would it be this book that you say you found in the wild?

01:20:31.028 --> 01:20:33.568
Well, of course not, because you only found 40 pages.

01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:35.668
But you would have a book.

01:20:36.308 --> 01:20:38.869
And if you put that book in a library, people would check it out.

01:20:39.549 --> 01:20:40.729
And people might even read it.

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.670
And they might have an opinion about it.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:46.130
But does that make it the book that you think it is, the book that you say it is?

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.691
And so with coronavirus biology, they find a fragment

01:20:51.738 --> 01:20:58.822
They assemble what they claim is the whole book and then they put that book in a cell culture and study whatever happens and call that virology.

01:20:58.882 --> 01:21:03.164
Now, up until very recently, this has been a very innocuous practice.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:20.657
But now they've started to claim that certain combinations of RNA can do all kinds of things, like kill billions of people, or ruin economies, and this kind of thing, and cause flying AIDS, or cancer, or whatever other things they're talking about.

01:21:20.737 --> 01:21:23.378
And this is a mythology.

01:21:23.418 --> 01:21:27.021
It can't happen because it's based on RNA, and RNA doesn't have any of these.

01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:31.584
Even if DNA did, which I think is a legitimate question to revisit,

01:21:32.564 --> 01:21:41.831
to what extent we understand the fidelity of DNA, the central role of DNA in our biology and all biology, that's a legitimate question to revisit.

01:21:41.891 --> 01:21:49.937
But the idea that RNA in the special context of coronaviruses can do all this special stuff is just wrong.

01:21:49.997 --> 01:21:51.198
It's wrong, wrong, wrong.

01:21:51.959 --> 01:21:52.839
And so,

01:21:53.900 --> 01:22:00.103
You asked the question, what did he do when you explained it to him?

01:22:00.143 --> 01:22:07.946
The first thing he did was allow me to get a quote on page 441 in the book, which says that they wouldn't even need a virus to do it.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:16.490
He allowed me to have free reign to put all the citations in that I think are important, including a Totora and Bavari paper.

01:22:17.647 --> 01:22:23.369
And then he helped me to get hired by Children's Health Defense after the book was published.

01:22:23.649 --> 01:22:33.433
And I thought that I was going to go forward as a guy at Children's Health Defense who would teach this biology and it would be all good.

01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:36.974
But that didn't work out.

01:22:37.114 --> 01:22:37.715
I actually

01:22:40.626 --> 01:22:49.511
To summarize it very quickly, I got fired by CHD in January of 2024 because I spoke about Robert Malone on my stream.

01:22:50.372 --> 01:23:00.618
And it was Mary Holland who fired me, along with Brian Hooker, and the exact timestamp of my podcast was given to me.

01:23:01.298 --> 01:23:08.562
And it's extraordinary, really, in retrospect, because my podcast was what got RFK to trust me and hire me as an advisor.

01:23:08.622 --> 01:23:15.366
And so my podcast being ultimately the reason why Mary Holland decided to fire me, I've just had to kind of

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.446
move on from there.

01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:33.393
And it has become very obvious to me that part of this show, this spell that the populist right in America has been put under, is being orchestrated by this health freedom movement that's never really made any progress.

01:23:34.113 --> 01:23:41.896
For Mary Holland, it's been about the adjuvants of the MMR vaccine for about 15 years, and she's never made any progress in understanding, even though

01:23:42.577 --> 01:23:46.122
She's had interaction with a lot of people who've come farther than her.

01:23:46.944 --> 01:23:49.188
And instead, she's the one who's still in front of us.

01:23:49.528 --> 01:23:50.830
And that's what frightens me.

01:23:50.991 --> 01:23:52.653
I think that there are some people who

01:23:53.632 --> 01:23:58.714
who shouldn't be there because it's obvious they haven't made progress.

01:23:58.814 --> 01:24:08.517
And I went from not understanding any of this as being possibly a mythology to where I am now in five years.

01:24:08.637 --> 01:24:21.541
And in the meantime, a lot of these people are still where they were in 2020 when I met them, where they're still concerned about mandates and happy that the mandates got taken away and still very concerned about things that they call COVID vaccines.

01:24:23.562 --> 01:24:35.511
It's just extraordinary to me that all of these people who are in this health freedom movement didn't start, for example, with the vitamin K shot and the hepatitis B vaccine, which are both given in the first day of birth.

01:24:36.432 --> 01:24:44.498
It seems like to me that if you were really fighting this fight for what you're fighting for, number one, you say that intramuscular injection in general is dumb.

01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:53.725
But more importantly, you say that giving these immune-augmenting injections on the day of birth is just absurd.

01:24:53.745 --> 01:24:58.849
And we should have started there already 10 years ago.

01:24:58.909 --> 01:25:09.837
But instead, people like Mary Holland started with an adjuvant of the unknown, unidentified adjuvant of the MMR vaccine and are still there 10 years later.

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:16.841
So it's extraordinary because essentially when you ask the question, what did Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:16.881 --> 01:25:17.141
do?

01:25:17.382 --> 01:25:18.022
Kind of nothing.

01:25:18.082 --> 01:25:26.267
He just handed me off to CHD and until until they couldn't stop me from progressing further.

01:25:26.967 --> 01:25:30.849
That's that's the way that I see it, as as as pessimistic as it sounds.

01:25:33.471 --> 01:25:38.113
That wasn't very conversational, but yeah, this is my it's a hard story to tell.

01:25:39.094 --> 01:25:39.574
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:40.415 --> 01:25:40.715
I mean,

01:25:43.864 --> 01:25:48.427
Uh, I'm trying to, I, I'm, I don't know.

01:25:48.447 --> 01:25:54.511
I feel like it's, uh, going to be a challenge to figure out how to like stitch this together.

01:25:54.611 --> 01:26:00.474
And, um, It's all good.

01:26:00.634 --> 01:26:07.818
I mean, I get it, but, um, you can just keep asking questions and I can keep trying to respond or we can try and record it again.

01:26:07.878 --> 01:26:08.179
I don't know.

01:26:08.459 --> 01:26:08.839
It's up to you.

01:26:12.082 --> 01:26:12.483
I get it.

01:26:12.865 --> 01:26:18.162
I mean, it might be that you need to give me questions beforehand so that I can kind of figure out.

01:26:19.346 --> 01:26:26.370
what what response you're not looking for, but you know what kind of level of response you're looking for.

01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:29.052
I'm trying to stay at the 30,000 foot level, but I can.

01:26:29.092 --> 01:26:29.492
Right.

01:26:29.532 --> 01:26:30.193
No, I could tell.

01:26:30.233 --> 01:26:30.673
I could tell.

01:26:30.733 --> 01:26:31.894
And it's not it's not easy.

01:26:31.934 --> 01:26:34.595
It's it's like you're you know, and I totally get it.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:38.158
I mean, I completely understand it and I and I respect it.

01:26:38.238 --> 01:26:41.720
You know, I know that it's like it's just a different it's a different format.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.362
I'm just trying to think of like how to, you know,

01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:56.153
get your message across to a different kind of audience or an audience that's not initiated.

01:26:56.213 --> 01:27:03.356
And it's like you're teaching, you know, I mean, I think it's kind of like the audience that you have built

01:27:04.355 --> 01:27:06.797
is probably much, you know, is more equipped.

01:27:06.817 --> 01:27:10.919
They've been listening to you for years and gone with you kind of on your journey.

01:27:11.599 --> 01:27:11.799
Right.

01:27:11.819 --> 01:27:16.762
But what if we what if you just get out of the weeds and try to tie it to something that you also worked on?

01:27:16.802 --> 01:27:22.105
You know, if there are explanations for all the deaths that don't involve a virus, then why is there a virus?

01:27:22.906 --> 01:27:23.146
Right.

01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:29.570
I mean, basically, like what I what I want, what I want to use, OK, the RFK thing.

01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:31.171
And like, I mean, that's the hook.

01:27:31.271 --> 01:27:33.372
And then a jumping off point of like, OK,

01:27:34.464 --> 01:27:36.005
What the hell happened and why?

01:27:36.225 --> 01:27:39.667
I mean, those are, you know, like million dollar.

01:27:39.967 --> 01:27:41.828
Those are like trillion dollar questions.

01:27:42.029 --> 01:27:46.331
You know, I mean, we saw the you know, like why did they do this?

01:27:46.471 --> 01:27:50.233
What is this elaborate theater actually about?

01:27:50.794 --> 01:27:52.795
You know, the FDA stuff you talked about.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:53.455
I mean, all the

01:27:55.051 --> 01:27:58.452
Yeah, I mean, that that would be the the other elevator pitch, right?

01:27:58.492 --> 01:27:59.892
I mean, that's like I want I want this.

01:28:00.012 --> 01:28:13.796
I want I want it to be as kind of political as possible, actually, because that's I mean, what I see, Jay, is like how I use I use especially like X is it's an ideological battleground like you can go after people.

01:28:13.876 --> 01:28:19.438
If we had a really good clip where like I put it, you know, through some A.I.

01:28:19.558 --> 01:28:23.179
editor or whatever of you being like explaining

01:28:24.787 --> 01:28:25.688
What the hell happened?

01:28:25.788 --> 01:28:28.610
And it's literally one minute long that could go viral.

01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:36.898
And I'm like, I'm already the same way that the redacted stuff has gotten you some attention and your audience has has grown.

01:28:37.558 --> 01:28:44.424
Like I have people deeming me who, you know, are incensed about what you said or writing at me.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.586
And those are the people that

01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:49.784
you know, that shows where you're like hitting on something.

01:28:51.424 --> 01:28:59.107
And so that's the kind of stuff that like and that's just with the redacted clip, which, you know, was not like very well planned out.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:06.049
It was I just, you know, I mean, I guess the question becomes what when you say you wanted to be political, so.

01:29:07.633 --> 01:29:10.236
I can do it a million ways, right?

01:29:10.536 --> 01:29:12.778
The population pyramid is the eclipse.

01:29:13.478 --> 01:29:14.699
But what did they use it for?

01:29:14.779 --> 01:29:19.043
Well, they used it to continue the illusion of the Human Genome Project.

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:21.125
The Human Genome Project was not completed.

01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:39.824
The Human Genome Project is just a technological rollout and a development project to get the sequencing technologies going and the storage of sequence data good enough so that at some point in time they could invert our sovereignty into experimental animal status and collect all that data that they needed.

01:29:40.544 --> 01:29:43.546
They needed all of our, they need all of our data.

01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:44.887
That's what this is really about.

01:29:44.967 --> 01:29:48.228
So if you want a political angle, the political angle is like 20 or 30 or 40 years long.

01:29:49.915 --> 01:29:52.860
It's a, they knew this phenomenon was coming.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.881
What are they going to use it for?

01:29:53.901 --> 01:29:59.970
Well, they're going to invert our sovereignty into experimental animal status so that they can collect all this data.

01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:03.175
And the most important thing here for me is this,

01:30:05.027 --> 01:30:08.708
So many people say this is about depopulation, but it's really not.

01:30:08.888 --> 01:30:11.069
The depopulation is going to happen anyway.

01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:16.531
The population pyramid already tells us that the population is going to crash.

01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:18.272
We don't need to kill people.

01:30:18.792 --> 01:30:22.993
What we need to do is collect all the data that's available before all these people are gone.

01:30:23.893 --> 01:30:24.894
That's what they're doing.

01:30:24.954 --> 01:30:29.015
There's not going to be this many children born ever again in human history.

01:30:29.415 --> 01:30:29.755
Never.

01:30:30.836 --> 01:30:31.196
Never.

01:30:32.486 --> 01:30:33.886
That's the trick to realize.

01:30:34.047 --> 01:30:39.828
Never, as these population pyramids collapse, there will never be this many babies born again.

01:30:39.948 --> 01:30:45.930
The next 20 years is the last population bump they're going to have to measure this many genomes.

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:48.791
There will never be this many games of go to collect again.

01:30:49.632 --> 01:30:50.952
You can't make babies fake.

01:30:53.653 --> 01:31:01.278
And then what does their attempt at completing the Human Genome Project... I'm not recording, by the way, now.

01:31:01.318 --> 01:31:01.798
I paused it.

01:31:01.838 --> 01:31:02.418
No, it's all good.

01:31:03.519 --> 01:31:04.500
It just really doesn't matter.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.140
I'm recording.

01:31:06.821 --> 01:31:08.322
This is the argument.

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:09.403
This is the discussion.

01:31:11.544 --> 01:31:12.365
Will they get it?

01:31:12.705 --> 01:31:13.526
Can they get it?

01:31:13.666 --> 01:31:14.106
I don't know.

01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:19.490
But incrementally speaking, from the day that Joshua Lederberg said,

01:31:20.646 --> 01:31:29.570
that we would use computers to crack the human genome and that the Human Genome Project was assembled to get the methodologies necessary.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:40.695
They always knew that sequencing your genome would be worthless, just like feeding in a single game of Go to a computer and then telling the computer to solve that game would have been stupid.

01:31:41.522 --> 01:31:41.742
Right.

01:31:42.383 --> 01:31:48.007
And so then what does what does the human what does completing the Human Genome Project do for them?

01:31:48.508 --> 01:31:59.056
They imagine that at some point a non existent computer with a non existent database set to data set that doesn't exist yet will solve the Human Genome Project.

01:31:59.096 --> 01:31:59.757
That's what they think.

01:32:00.495 --> 01:32:02.155
And what will that give them, a solved human?

01:32:03.075 --> 01:32:10.097
I guess the ability to reprogram it, I guess the ability to do something with it, an insight that they don't have right now.

01:32:10.177 --> 01:32:21.079
One of the things to recall, or maybe not recall, but to understand better, is that the Human Genome Project suggests that something has been solved, but it hasn't.

01:32:21.159 --> 01:32:29.060
Remember, if you can find a bunch of proteins encoded in the DNA, that doesn't tell you anything about the pattern integrity

01:32:29.815 --> 01:32:31.536
that those proteins are expressed in.

01:32:31.576 --> 01:32:36.999
They can't look at your DNA and tell you when you went into puberty and when your puberty ended.

01:32:37.519 --> 01:32:43.762
They can't look at your DNA and explain why you didn't turn out to be this height, but you turned out to be that height.

01:32:44.182 --> 01:32:49.985
They can't look at your DNA and even explain why you're the weight that you are right now and the weight you were when you were a teenager.

01:32:50.485 --> 01:33:07.199
and when your beard started to grow because those are all things that are encoded across a temporal time course that they haven't found anything in the DNA code that suggests how this developmental time course that for your frontal cortex took 22 years

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.581
None of that is understood in the genome.

01:33:11.621 --> 01:33:16.704
So they can say that they completed the human genome, but they don't know what it means.

01:33:16.764 --> 01:33:24.327
And they certainly can't find all of the information that we already know is necessary to encode Dan Cohen.

01:33:25.248 --> 01:33:31.691
As a baby to where you are as an adult, that's all apparently in the DNA, even though none of that information is visible to us.

01:33:33.057 --> 01:33:38.721
So the Human Genome Project is imagining that an AI might start to see that.

01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:47.166
An AI might be able to look at a billion genomes and then start to extract those signals which we could never extract on our own.

01:33:47.506 --> 01:33:48.546
That's what they imagine.

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:49.787
Is that true?

01:33:49.887 --> 01:33:50.387
I don't know.

01:33:50.688 --> 01:33:59.473
Possibly, but I can assure you that that's what they believe and they've believed it since Joshua Lederberg first able to sort of articulate this goal.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:02.687
Um, okay.

01:34:03.127 --> 01:34:21.440
And so I think that, I think that everybody that's involved in this wittingly or unwittingly is being taken along to slowly change this system over so that the collection of medical data, the collection and cataloging of genetic data is done in such a way so that the data is uniform.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.660
Cause that's one of the problems.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.202
You can't have 40 different formats for this data.

01:34:25.642 --> 01:34:29.325
You can't have it stored in 40 different formats in 40 different places.

01:34:29.385 --> 01:34:30.626
That's why they announced the.

01:34:31.246 --> 01:34:33.507
the Stargate AI thing in the first place.

01:34:33.547 --> 01:34:35.728
You got to be able to store it, organize it.

01:34:35.908 --> 01:34:44.591
All these people from the moment the Human Genome Project was conceived understood that the data needed to be stored in a way that could be shared across time and space.

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:50.354
And so they had to come up with different agreements on how we should spread the data and how we should encode it.

01:34:50.394 --> 01:34:54.475
And that's been going on iteration after iteration for this very purpose.

01:34:55.396 --> 01:34:56.176
Absolutely.

01:34:57.247 --> 01:35:11.020
That's the same reason why when they did this to Jesse Gelsinger in 2000, and then they had a congressional hearing about it, they were talking about gene therapy and anybody that took part in a gene therapy experiment as risking their lives.

01:35:12.602 --> 01:35:16.406
And now we rolled it out as an investigational vaccine and nobody talked about it like that.

01:35:17.286 --> 01:35:18.207
I mean, it's just...

01:35:19.139 --> 01:35:24.864
It is absolutely a political thing, because this whole mythology is a political thing.

01:35:25.584 --> 01:35:26.445
Right, right, right.

01:35:26.485 --> 01:35:28.206
Yeah, that's what I mean by a political thing.

01:35:28.266 --> 01:35:33.610
Not like a red-blue thing, like, oh, let's get people mad at RFK or whatever.

01:35:34.051 --> 01:35:38.194
No, I'm like, what's the real purpose of all of this?

01:35:38.254 --> 01:35:39.695
What are we really looking at?

01:35:41.677 --> 01:35:44.821
And like, why should people, you know, why should people care?

01:35:45.541 --> 01:35:46.903
And and this kind of thing.

01:35:46.963 --> 01:35:48.504
This is this is what I'm trying to get at.

01:35:50.026 --> 01:35:51.147
So I think being able.

01:35:51.948 --> 01:35:54.290
Yeah, if we can like sort of.

01:35:56.112 --> 01:35:56.432
I mean.

01:35:58.555 --> 01:36:03.740
It's such a big animal and it's and it's a it's a complex thing and it's

01:36:07.074 --> 01:36:14.016
So it's it's hard to it's hard to, you know, talk about in a really brief period, but, you know, in a short time.

01:36:15.496 --> 01:36:25.299
And I mean, there's so much that, you know, we could spend like hours just talking on the construction of the image of a pandemic, how they did that.

01:36:25.499 --> 01:36:29.701
And then, you know, and then eventually, you know, hours later, you could do.

01:36:30.621 --> 01:36:34.302
OK, so then why did they do it and what is the I mean, it's like you could do

01:36:35.043 --> 01:36:39.527
some crazy documentary series that would just be a mind melter, you know, but.

01:36:42.269 --> 01:36:44.531
So that's the challenge, how to take something like that and.

01:36:46.252 --> 01:36:48.534
And yeah, I mean, I don't know what to say, I try it every day.

01:36:48.554 --> 01:36:50.155
Right, right, right.

01:36:50.395 --> 01:36:53.718
But you but your but your strategy is is is good.

01:36:54.018 --> 01:36:56.180
I mean, I'm not I'm not criticizing your strategy at all.

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.963
It's just it's just different because you're you've got like

01:37:01.533 --> 01:37:23.620
your audience that you've cultivated and you do lengthy streams and it's not like conversational where it's like you, you know, talking to some like big personality who doesn't know, like, you know, who's, who's, I'm just saying like, imagine if you, like, imagine if you were on, uh, like some big channel that had, do you know what I mean?

01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:27.422
How can we get your message across that way?

01:37:27.462 --> 01:37:34.946
And I think what you were just explaining is that but people are going to have to know who is who is Joshua Lederberg and like what and what is the Human Genome Project?

01:37:35.006 --> 01:37:38.668
And, you know, I mean, most people they're like, I'll put it this way.

01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:49.575
When most people watch any of these like alternative media shows, it's a lot of the kind of same sort of themes over and over about Ukraine, about Gaza.

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:55.665
about, you know, Trump and, you know, Thomas Massey and this, you know what I mean?

01:37:55.725 --> 01:37:58.948
It's not like deeper concepts.

01:37:59.008 --> 01:38:05.574
So you have to be able to like, I don't know, that's the challenge is finding a way to deliver that.

01:38:05.794 --> 01:38:12.621
And so that's, I mean, and that's what I want to, you know, I'm not even saying assist you, but accompany you on that.

01:38:13.146 --> 01:38:13.566
I get it.

01:38:13.766 --> 01:38:15.587
I mean, it's just, I don't know what to say.

01:38:15.687 --> 01:38:20.789
At the center of this are things that people have been killed for saying.

01:38:21.609 --> 01:38:26.411
At the center of this are statements like intramuscular injection as medicine are dumb.

01:38:27.011 --> 01:38:30.472
I mean, that's where my life's work is going.

01:38:31.653 --> 01:38:32.873
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:38:32.913 --> 01:38:34.333
I don't know how to say it any easier.

01:38:34.454 --> 01:38:37.014
These were always transfections and transformations.

01:38:37.054 --> 01:38:38.315
I don't know how to say it any easier.

01:38:38.775 --> 01:38:45.121
Well, you can say, you know what you could I mean, and that's one of the things that you do, you can say, Look, these are the five most important things to know.

01:38:45.462 --> 01:38:51.307
And like this, and, you know, but you have to, like, in some way, explain what, like, why RNA can not pandemic?

01:38:51.327 --> 01:38:52.789
What, what is a transfection?

01:38:52.929 --> 01:38:58.815
You know, I mean, and I know you did explain that to me, you gave me a detailed explanation, which I have recorded on this, on this stream.

01:38:58.975 --> 01:39:02.198
So it's the challenge of like, how do you communicate that

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.751
like in a way that people can sort of understand.

01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:14.413
The other way is, you know, that you can, I think, do that is just point out that no one's able to challenge me.

01:39:14.493 --> 01:39:15.814
You know, here's my position.

01:39:16.154 --> 01:39:19.395
OK, I'm not going to go in detail and explain every aspect of it right now.

01:39:19.715 --> 01:39:23.596
But I know there are people who know better and none of them will talk to me.

01:39:23.696 --> 01:39:25.836
None of them will challenge me.

01:39:25.956 --> 01:39:29.237
None of them will debate me if if my idea is so wrong.

01:39:29.617 --> 01:39:30.778
Well, let's just have a a

01:39:32.219 --> 01:39:33.840
moderated debate, whatever.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.160
Let's just talk about it.

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.701
Why is everyone so afraid of that?

01:39:37.962 --> 01:39:41.683
You know, these are the kinds of things that I think it's like.

01:39:44.705 --> 01:39:57.791
Getting into that arena, I think, can it's I mean, that's why I say it's like as much as I I hate X and social media, it really is a place that you can get into.

01:39:58.596 --> 01:40:11.186
like you can get into ideological struggle and debates and challenge people who like you wouldn't be able to otherwise, because you don't get invited onto the shows and onto the conferences and, you know, onto those debate stages.

01:40:12.007 --> 01:40:15.309
So it's harder for them to curate the narrative in the exact same way.

01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:21.574
There are ways to to like, you know, beat the algorithm in a way on in places like that.

01:40:23.195 --> 01:40:26.518
So, I mean, and that's why I think like, you know, if we can take

01:40:28.092 --> 01:40:38.816
your converse, you know, our conversation, whatever, and then actually take it, put it into an AI, uh, whatever program that cuts like one minute shorts.

01:40:39.596 --> 01:40:48.340
And that's the complete antithesis of like what intellectual people do is one minute shorts, but it is very effective.

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.541
Um, and those can go viral and all of a sudden you got,

01:40:52.885 --> 01:41:01.549
20,000 or 30,000 or 100,000 views of like, wait, this guy helped write RFK's book and he basically blew him off.

01:41:01.689 --> 01:41:03.790
Like, and I know it's more complicated than that.

01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:05.451
It's not that he blew you off, but.

01:41:06.832 --> 01:41:14.075
You know, you were sort of like silenced in a way that took you a while to figure out you were being silenced, it was done, right?

01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:17.024
That's my point.

01:41:17.324 --> 01:41:19.225
So, I mean, we can strategize more.

01:41:19.265 --> 01:41:21.247
I'm happy to like even just talking.

01:41:22.388 --> 01:41:25.910
You know, I I don't want to like I don't want to waste your time, number one.

01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:27.512
And I don't think you feel like I'm wasting your time.

01:41:28.592 --> 01:41:31.935
But I'm trying to figure out how to be the most effective.

01:41:32.015 --> 01:41:38.120
So like if it's if it's best to like just talk and strategize first, we can do that.

01:41:41.082 --> 01:41:45.025
Yeah, I'm just I'm trying to figure out like how exactly to take this.

01:41:47.062 --> 01:41:48.563
Does that make sense?

01:41:48.583 --> 01:41:48.883
Yep.

01:41:49.223 --> 01:41:51.584
I, I, I guess it's just really up to you.

01:41:51.984 --> 01:41:53.885
Um, you're kind of the interviewer.

01:41:53.965 --> 01:41:57.266
If you, if you, uh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

01:41:57.466 --> 01:42:05.189
I mean, if you watch the last charge, if you watch the last stream that I did, then you, you are, um, I get whoops.

01:42:05.309 --> 01:42:05.669
Let's see.

01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:06.450
I can do that.

01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:07.950
Be able to do that.

01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:11.912
I watched, I watched, uh, no, I didn't get to watch all of it, but I was like, this is great.

01:42:11.972 --> 01:42:14.213
Like, you know, it's perfect.

01:42:14.933 --> 01:42:15.013
Um,

01:42:16.627 --> 01:42:31.589
So, but it's the kind of thing, it's the kind of thing that it's like, I would send to some people to watch, but like, it's, it would be like, I mean, where, where would you like, how, how, how,

01:42:36.068 --> 01:42:37.790
There's a million different angles on it.

01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:43.194
For example, I can show you Skyhorse book after Skyhorse book, starting with a book from 2008.

01:42:45.216 --> 01:42:48.679
In the epilogue of the book, it says that RFK is going to be vice president.

01:42:50.541 --> 01:42:51.522
It's a Skyhorse book.

01:42:52.196 --> 01:43:04.064
You know, the same book publisher that published two books in 2010 and 2012 by Andrew Wakefield about the MMR vaccine and the possible, you know, adjuvants.

01:43:04.824 --> 01:43:12.790
And the same book company that published the environmental and genetic causes of autism that I think's a bullshit book by a bullshit author.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:18.954
And then the same book company published all of Robert Malone's books, who I'm sure

01:43:19.694 --> 01:43:26.577
is a traitor to our grandkids and the reason why I got fired from CHD and revealed CHD as the operation that it is to me.

01:43:27.057 --> 01:43:37.481
I mean, we can talk about sky horse books, we can talk about biology, we can talk about people, we can talk about ideas, but it always comes back to the fact that, I mean,

01:43:40.225 --> 01:43:42.246
It's really simple ideas in the end.

01:43:42.306 --> 01:43:43.827
These people are just lying.

01:43:43.887 --> 01:43:50.250
And the only real debate is whether or not RFK knows or whether RFK is just being bewildered by people around him.

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.871
That's the only debate in my head.

01:43:52.411 --> 01:43:57.934
And most people are pretty, pretty done with him and accept the fact that he's just part of that crew.

01:43:58.914 --> 01:43:59.115
Right.

01:43:59.155 --> 01:43:59.615
Exactly.

01:43:59.755 --> 01:44:10.000
I mean, yeah, which is, you know, why I brought up the whole thing recently, as you correctly inferred that, you know, when he, when his whole, like,

01:44:10.529 --> 01:44:20.695
comment about anti-Semitism, his official statement about anti-Semitism being like a health crisis, and which is, you know, so people were like, what the hell?

01:44:20.735 --> 01:44:22.936
So I'm, you know, want to use that as a jumping off point.

01:44:22.977 --> 01:44:23.597
I mean, the other thing.

01:44:24.281 --> 01:44:39.578
The thing that one of the things I found compelling in what you were saying, and you know, as I was trying to be more conversational, I asked you is, why would he want to know what clones are, unless he suspects that like, well, maybe that could be the explanation of what's happening here.

01:44:39.638 --> 01:44:42.081
That's kind of like, you know, if he's

01:44:43.069 --> 01:45:03.353
Well, then again, now you're, now you, again, you're, you're asking the right question, but you're going to get the detailed answer because the only way to understand it is detailed and what you need to now hear then just for this conversation between me and you is the reason why I think they asked me to look at infectious clones was because there is a way to spin that.

01:45:05.013 --> 01:45:11.154
And you can spin that as if you make an infectious clone of the magic RNA, then you can cause a pandemic.

01:45:12.162 --> 01:45:12.923
That's the spin.

01:45:13.604 --> 01:45:14.305
And it's wrong.

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:15.246
It's wrong.

01:45:15.506 --> 01:45:17.348
But that's the spin they want to put on it.

01:45:17.408 --> 01:45:21.994
That if you make an infectious clone, then you're making a very dangerous bioweapon.

01:45:22.034 --> 01:45:26.660
What I would suggest to you is you're just making a pure quantity of something that otherwise would never be found.

01:45:27.979 --> 01:45:29.060
And that is the trick.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:56.220
They can lie about the potential of that pure quantity, but what that pure quantity does, and that's what the extraordinary thing, if you look at the contents of this pen, it's like three milliliters, three milliliters of pure DNA of the spike protein would be enough spike protein DNA to put it anywhere on earth, thousands of places, and it could be found with PCR for weeks after you put it there.

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:00.123
And it would just have to be in water, not anything else.

01:46:00.963 --> 01:46:11.311
And that would be enough for them to find positivity anywhere in people, in hospitals, on cruise ships, and in laboratories and claim that they found it.

01:46:11.391 --> 01:46:22.780
So any biosecurity actor that wanted to create the illusion of finding a sequence or a sequence being found everywhere, it is trivial to do it.

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.861
Like it's a joke.

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:29.882
It would cost less than a thousand dollars and most of the cost would be the flight to go around putting it places.

01:46:29.922 --> 01:46:30.382
That's it.

01:46:31.743 --> 01:46:39.328
And they now have the existence quantities to make liters because that's how they make protein biologics.

01:46:40.449 --> 01:46:51.517
So it would be trivial for them to claim what they're finding is spontaneous when it could easily be planted or even easier it could have always been there.

01:46:51.597 --> 01:46:52.338
That's the trick.

01:46:53.049 --> 01:47:02.300
You know, if you claim that the Bible's spreading everywhere on earth and you're finding it wherever you look, in every library, in every hospital, in every hotel, well guess what?

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.942
It's not spreading, it was already there.

01:47:04.903 --> 01:47:05.123
Yeah.

01:47:06.645 --> 01:47:06.825
Right.

01:47:08.186 --> 01:47:11.809
Again, this is, you know, you ask the question and the answer is there.

01:47:11.909 --> 01:47:12.629
I've thought of it.

01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:17.553
It's just that the answer is detailed enough so that, you know, lots of people glaze over.

01:47:17.613 --> 01:47:21.055
They want to understand it, but they don't want to work.

01:47:21.575 --> 01:47:24.437
They want to have a very simple, dumb explanation.

01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:29.341
Well, the dumb, simple explanation is it is for all the marbles, so yes, they lied to you.

01:47:29.901 --> 01:47:32.984
They want to enslave your grandkids so they lied to you.

01:47:33.465 --> 01:47:37.909
And they are told that they're being on the winning team if they go along with this lie.

01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:39.751
It's pretty simple, I think.

01:47:40.732 --> 01:47:40.892
Yeah.

01:47:42.454 --> 01:47:43.995
Yeah, this is well, this is the challenge.

01:47:44.095 --> 01:47:48.780
What about what about if instead of this interview that you interview me and Mark Kulak?

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.725
Because Mark Kulak can probably keep me focused on the bigger picture better than I can keep myself focused.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:57.703
Well, I need to I mean, it's I mean, I'm I've never spoken to Mark.

01:47:57.743 --> 01:47:58.703
I'm happy to talk to him.

01:47:59.104 --> 01:48:01.885
I've watched I've watched his stream a little bit.

01:48:01.965 --> 01:48:08.028
I haven't watched much because I watch yours more when I'm like going to focus on that issue.

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:08.728
But

01:48:13.922 --> 01:48:23.789
I mean, I'm open to that possibility, but really it should be, it's my job as the interviewer to, you know, make sure I'm sort of getting out of you what I want to get out.

01:48:24.089 --> 01:48:25.130
You never had a chance.

01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:32.115
So you don't know how much of a spout I am, you know, so now you, maybe you understand the geyser you're dealing with and you can craft.

01:48:32.155 --> 01:48:33.856
Yeah, yeah, no, which I appreciate.

01:48:34.056 --> 01:48:35.577
It's like, no, it's, it's awesome.

01:48:35.657 --> 01:48:42.002
It's, you know, it's much better than, uh, than the other, you know, the opposite that like, um, but, uh,

01:48:43.095 --> 01:48:44.036
Yeah, I have to.

01:48:44.256 --> 01:48:44.816
I have to.

01:48:46.378 --> 01:48:47.779
Basically, I'm going to have to.

01:48:47.819 --> 01:48:53.923
The thing is, I'm going to have to cut you off sometimes and I don't want to do that, but I'm but I'm going to have to sometimes.

01:48:54.444 --> 01:48:55.024
Does that make sense?

01:48:55.204 --> 01:48:59.327
You need a you need to have a buzzer and then then you can do it really easy.

01:48:59.968 --> 01:49:00.548
All right.

01:49:03.711 --> 01:49:07.454
OK, so, I mean, here's the thing I would have to I'll have to interject more.

01:49:08.094 --> 01:49:09.715
But if you.

01:49:11.236 --> 01:49:11.617
Can.

01:49:13.641 --> 01:49:16.202
try to be more concise.

01:49:16.302 --> 01:49:20.042
And I'm not saying that means don't talk about anything scientific or whatever.

01:49:20.482 --> 01:49:21.823
If it's essential, it's essential.

01:49:21.903 --> 01:49:22.743
Like, I get that.

01:49:24.263 --> 01:49:28.164
But like, what did RFK, you know, tell you?

01:49:28.304 --> 01:49:33.425
And, you know, how did you get involved with him and what was his response?

01:49:33.885 --> 01:49:37.006
Or why did you come to think this was not the case?

01:49:37.206 --> 01:49:42.567
I mean, give like a two minute explanation, if possible, where

01:49:43.724 --> 01:49:46.065
Um, I don't know.

01:49:46.265 --> 01:49:49.147
And then, and yeah, I don't know.

01:49:49.307 --> 01:49:55.790
It's, I'm asking you to do something that's, that's not exactly your, uh, your speed.

01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:59.952
Um, that, you know, is the opposite of what you do.

01:49:59.972 --> 01:50:07.736
It's, it's kind of in some way, it's, it's like the same as when I talk to like my rabbi in some way about like Judaism and, you know, stuff about like understanding.

01:50:07.756 --> 01:50:09.817
How about, how about just, uh,

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:15.419
I mean, start recording, first of all, because I don't want to say anything smart that you like that it's not recorded.

01:50:16.539 --> 01:50:24.203
Well, what I want to do is kind of like reset in a way, because it's going to be at this point, it'll be so hard.

01:50:24.323 --> 01:50:27.584
I mean, yeah, but I mean, I get what you want to reset.

01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:28.064
I hear it.

01:50:28.304 --> 01:50:33.867
I just think of it from the perspective of I'm trying to put myself in your shoes, OK?

01:50:33.887 --> 01:50:39.849
It's not hard for you or your viewers to understand that that the that the social media narrative

01:50:40.481 --> 01:50:52.146
and that there are actors on social media that are actively following a script, which benefits their handlers, which benefits the piles of money that pay them.

01:50:53.266 --> 01:51:04.791
And the theater that is Gaza, which is not just a theater, but it's also real people, I get that, that theater is a very controlled theater.

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:11.790
And you might be one of the few spontaneous, non-controlled voices in that theater, for all I know.

01:51:13.392 --> 01:51:15.213
Yeah, I feel that it's very controlled.

01:51:15.233 --> 01:51:19.437
The more I, oh man, it drives me crazy.

01:51:19.917 --> 01:51:21.238
And it's really the same.

01:51:21.298 --> 01:51:27.644
People don't understand that they're participating in a controlled, look at, okay, here's a perfect example.

01:51:27.964 --> 01:51:31.427
What's happening right now, okay.

01:51:32.304 --> 01:51:38.489
I mean, I could say a lot about this, but it's exactly the same way that you're saying how it's very much controlled.

01:51:38.569 --> 01:51:40.230
Most of the people don't realize it.

01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:53.139
And the way, like nobody will actually take... I mean, it's a great analogy because essentially nobody believes that RFK's, you know, a position on anti-Semitism is an informed one.

01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:59.144
Nobody believes that he's saying that because he goes to his grave believing that he's, you know,

01:52:00.124 --> 01:52:01.445
Speaking out on the rights.

01:52:01.505 --> 01:52:03.925
It's the same thing with gain-of-function viruses.

01:52:03.985 --> 01:52:08.467
If you're told that that's what the story is, then you go along with it if you're going to rise in this hierarchy.

01:52:08.507 --> 01:52:08.887
That's simple.

01:52:08.907 --> 01:52:09.387
Exactly.

01:52:09.867 --> 01:52:11.648
So that's the thing is like, you know what?

01:52:11.968 --> 01:52:16.409
What if we actively avoid getting into the science of it?

01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:19.310
And because it's like.

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:28.993
And if you're like, look, I can prove that an RNA pandemic is completely fake.

01:52:29.531 --> 01:52:32.732
but it is not a real thing.

01:52:33.092 --> 01:52:33.673
I can prove it.

01:52:33.713 --> 01:52:42.176
You put me up against, to debate anybody, Robert Malone or RFK or any single one of them in a, I'll expose it.

01:52:44.377 --> 01:52:53.601
But they don't want, RFK is playing political games and does not wanna talk, like it makes you, you know what I mean?

01:52:54.161 --> 01:52:56.382
It's playing political games because

01:52:57.631 --> 01:53:24.234
i don't know you know i think you can't say i mean you could be like i can't say rfk uh... uh... lied to me or mistreated me or anything like that it is an essential absolutely important question to anyone who claims to care about public health about the way our country's going about are the future of our country our children our grandchildren and the fact that he

01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:27.210
would not do it and basically.

01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:45.294
Sent me on my on my way and went ahead and published this book, knowing that it is that it very well may be based on a totally faulty premise that is useful for, you know, some some.

01:53:46.554 --> 01:53:50.217
powerful interests really says everything.

01:53:50.337 --> 01:53:53.119
And there needs to be a lot more questions asked about that.

01:53:53.279 --> 01:53:59.224
And, you know, I mean, this is like what I would say if I were going on redacted again and talking about you or whatever.

01:53:59.424 --> 01:54:03.267
And this is what I tried to do the other day, that it's like, why the fuck is nobody talking about.

01:54:04.428 --> 01:54:07.150
Jake, who in this whole RFK, you know, I mean, those are the things.

01:54:09.271 --> 01:54:12.514
I get that, like, you've been through so much shit that you're like,

01:54:14.525 --> 01:54:18.849
You have you have your strengths and your personality and your character of what you do.

01:54:19.029 --> 01:54:19.890
You are a teacher.

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:24.394
And like that's and it's not just since covid, you've been a teacher like you were teaching.

01:54:24.554 --> 01:54:25.434
Were you teaching before?

01:54:25.494 --> 01:54:25.635
No.

01:54:26.055 --> 01:54:29.978
Yeah, I taught I taught high school even before I decided to go into my PhD.

01:54:30.038 --> 01:54:37.084
No, this this seriously, the thing is, man, the problem the problem is, is that a teacher has a message and I have a priority message.

01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:40.848
I ultimately don't want to waste my time

01:54:42.849 --> 01:54:44.450
Talking about these people.

01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:55.036
I want to talk about the ideas that they consistently ignore and and ultimately the story right now is that that It isn't about a particular shot.

01:54:55.136 --> 01:54:57.098
They want to make it about a particular shot.

01:54:57.198 --> 01:55:00.520
It's about intramuscular injection in general and this is not a

01:55:01.676 --> 01:55:26.933
if if we can't make that into a political message i get it but i don't have a political message about robert f kennedy junior because he's just as bad as merrill nass and maryland and all these other people yeah yeah no i get it i get it it's just a tool it's something much bigger i'm just saying that's a jumping off point and it's like if the fact that i mean is what i said not true the fact if robert f kennedy is willing to publish a book

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:43.469
his top advisor, or the scientist who he credited as the most important, essential in writing this book, says is false and told him so, that is a major, that's a scandal.

01:55:43.769 --> 01:55:45.570
That's scandalous, and that is political.

01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:53.995
It is, or it just reveals that there is a national security priority to collect the data and to have people think that there's pandemics, right?

01:55:54.015 --> 01:55:54.275
Both.

01:55:54.336 --> 01:55:55.716
That's what's behind the scandal.

01:55:57.358 --> 01:56:00.641
I'm saying it needs to be called a scandal and like okay fine.

01:56:00.682 --> 01:56:14.558
That's my job to do it I'm like the journalist who's you know seeing you know what you're doing and kind of and sees that story for what it is, but I just feel like we need to find a way

01:56:15.612 --> 01:56:27.977
a formula for this interview that's going to deliver your message, that's going to just get, I mean, your message.

01:56:28.017 --> 01:56:37.140
You don't have one, you know, one, like, I understand what, you know, you have, you've kind of boiled it down to like five or six points.

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.842
RNA, RNA can't bandemic, intramuscular injection is dumb, etc.

01:56:43.982 --> 01:56:51.896
those are the points that you go after but like we need to find a way to pry in to the narrative and I think

01:56:53.325 --> 01:56:54.286
the RFK thing.

01:56:54.386 --> 01:56:55.347
It's just the jumping off.

01:56:55.547 --> 01:56:56.928
It's just the diving board to get.

01:56:57.248 --> 01:56:57.769
Do you know what I mean?

01:56:58.709 --> 01:57:04.434
Well, I mean, really, you know, that story is is him probably not wanting to do what he's doing right now.

01:57:04.474 --> 01:57:11.740
You know, the Mercury, the World Mercury Project was his thing, and that changed its name in 2018 to Children's Health Defense.

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.244
So, I mean, the political angle on this is is deep, dude.

01:57:16.344 --> 01:57:17.084
I don't know how to

01:57:18.446 --> 01:57:26.112
I don't know, if you just want to say that I'm in the book but he doesn't talk to me anymore and why, that's all you can really say.

01:57:26.452 --> 01:57:34.859
No, no, there's like more I want to say about that, but there's like, you know, like I said, the question I had before

01:57:37.138 --> 01:57:38.719
After that is okay.

01:57:38.739 --> 01:57:42.980
So well, I kind of mixed in with that is like how did you come to this conclusion?

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:54.943
which obviously is a scientific question and I mean what you were saying to me about Transfecting monkeys and then you have to kill them soon after that was like chilling for me.

01:57:55.003 --> 01:58:00.545
That's fucking terrifying everyone should be like that should that's that's a massive scandal and

01:58:01.084 --> 01:58:02.786
I don't think it's a massive scandal at all.

01:58:02.826 --> 01:58:04.148
Why is that a massive scandal?

01:58:04.949 --> 01:58:06.230
That's how science is done.

01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:08.793
That's how it's been done for years and years and years.

01:58:08.833 --> 01:58:10.475
No, no, I'm saying that that's what was done.

01:58:10.535 --> 01:58:12.097
Isn't that what was done to people then?

01:58:12.918 --> 01:58:13.598
No, no, no.

01:58:13.678 --> 01:58:14.139
That's the...

01:58:17.503 --> 01:58:22.866
I don't think people, the vast majority of people that were transfecting, it did not go in their brain.

01:58:23.626 --> 01:58:27.709
It could have, it could have, but these are directly injected to the brain.

01:58:27.769 --> 01:58:30.470
So it's a little different, but it's the same concept.

01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:31.431
It's the same tool.

01:58:31.591 --> 01:58:31.811
Yeah.

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:32.591
Right.

01:58:32.791 --> 01:58:33.071
Okay.

01:58:33.111 --> 01:58:33.232
Yeah.

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:33.832
So it's all right.

01:58:33.852 --> 01:58:34.672
It's not going into the brain.

01:58:34.792 --> 01:58:35.753
It could have though.

01:58:35.813 --> 01:58:41.136
And it definitely goes into the brain and babies because baby's blood brain barrier is not developed.

01:58:42.173 --> 01:58:42.453
Right.

01:58:42.513 --> 01:58:48.195
So like if you I mean, when you were explaining that technology, that was like bone chilling.

01:58:48.275 --> 01:58:49.635
And that's such an important thing.

01:58:49.735 --> 01:58:52.556
I mean, so there there are aspects of it that I think are.

01:58:52.936 --> 01:58:55.477
And remember, that's also part of the story, right?

01:58:55.517 --> 01:59:01.358
You get recruited into this book and you have this really important message also about the shot.

01:59:01.478 --> 01:59:02.999
And that's not in this book either.

01:59:03.899 --> 01:59:05.739
When can I tell everybody about that?

01:59:05.799 --> 01:59:08.840
Well, when we hire you at CHD and then they hired me at CHD.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.421
And when can I tell everybody about that?

01:59:10.521 --> 01:59:11.461
Well, I don't know.

01:59:12.472 --> 01:59:13.953
I mean, that's also important.

01:59:14.033 --> 01:59:18.758
It's all part of the same, you know, I saw the UFO that nobody else has seen.

01:59:19.778 --> 01:59:28.026
And now he's, you know, this, this whole measles thing that he's on, this measles thing was set up by Rolling Stone already in 2016.

01:59:28.086 --> 01:59:29.507
I mean, that's extraordinary.

01:59:30.441 --> 01:59:34.244
The idea that, you know, Mary Holland hasn't had to change her tune since 2015.

01:59:35.044 --> 01:59:38.827
And that we're now talking about the MMR again.

01:59:38.847 --> 01:59:39.307
It is.

01:59:39.327 --> 01:59:40.548
I, okay.

01:59:40.668 --> 01:59:41.509
I'm, I'm with you.

01:59:41.549 --> 01:59:44.090
The thing is, I think like, okay.

01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:56.879
When I ask you that stuff, when I ask you like what RFK told you and you know, how you, how you came to that conclusion and what RFK told you when you told him that

01:59:57.608 --> 02:00:07.438
when you start talking like it has to be a more concise answer because you start talking about Mary Holland and like people are not going to know who Mary Holland is.

02:00:08.179 --> 02:00:14.545
You know, people aren't people aren't going to know like the the intricacies of CHD in this kind of thing.

02:00:14.605 --> 02:00:14.946
And like,

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:22.744
Yeah, again, it depends on the answer you want.

02:00:22.784 --> 02:00:27.608
If you want the biological one or the political one, the political one's been going on for a while.

02:00:27.928 --> 02:00:42.899
I mean, it essentially seems like Steve Bannon saw that the anti-vax movement could be used as a very effective populist right tool in the UK, and he recruited the same jackasses and brought them over here to America and did the same thing.

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:44.881
with them.

02:00:45.982 --> 02:00:52.986
And at some point, RFK got roped into the same game, and I got roped into the same game.

02:00:53.066 --> 02:00:56.569
And once I figured out that these people weren't playing to win, I went on my own.

02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:57.389
That's where I am.

02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:01.352
And so the hit piece on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:01.432 --> 02:01:11.859
is that he had the franchise player, and CHD had a franchise player that could have ended all of this nonsense, and they chose to let me go off on my own and ignore me.

02:01:12.748 --> 02:01:14.189
And that is all those people.

02:01:14.329 --> 02:01:18.291
And all those people are behind RFK, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:18.331 --> 02:01:21.472
and Mary Holland, who was his campaign manager in the first instance.

02:01:22.853 --> 02:01:29.697
And Tony Lyons of Skyhorse Publishing is still his main advisor, along with Del Bigtree.

02:01:29.717 --> 02:01:30.897
I mean, it's just absurd.

02:01:31.037 --> 02:01:31.678
It's absurd.

02:01:32.563 --> 02:01:42.394
And the fact of the matter is, is that the right in America has been captured by these posers who are all essentially Democratic operatives as far as their political history goes.

02:01:42.434 --> 02:01:45.116
They can't possibly actually really be Republicans.

02:01:45.854 --> 02:01:51.000
So it's so weird that, I mean, I have a hard time explaining it, but that's the gist of it.

02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:57.247
I thought I got on the right team, and very clearly I got on a team that was already in the business of sabotage a long time ago.

02:01:58.028 --> 02:02:01.452
And it's possible that even right now, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:02:01.532 --> 02:02:01.932
is just a

02:02:03.767 --> 02:02:10.432
a coattail riding person who, if they could have gotten him into the vice presidency, they definitely would have, but they didn't.

02:02:10.532 --> 02:02:21.361
And so now he's here and I don't know what he's doing, but he's not doing what he promised he would do all those years ago when he changed the name of World Mercury Project to CSD.

02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:22.883
I think what you're saying is perfect.

02:02:23.043 --> 02:02:30.669
Like, I think if I ask you that same question, how did you come to this conclusion and what did

02:02:31.732 --> 02:02:33.273
You know what happened when you told him that?

02:02:33.313 --> 02:02:35.734
And he's and, you know, he basically.

02:02:37.314 --> 02:02:40.276
Gave you, you know, he said, this isn't the book for that, OK?

02:02:41.816 --> 02:02:44.438
But, you know, and why then?

02:02:45.098 --> 02:02:53.742
You know, I think Robert Kennedy is basically part of a bigger operation that's been going back decades that aims to achieve this.

02:02:53.902 --> 02:03:01.185
And we are, you know, there are a variety of characters and actors who have

02:03:01.938 --> 02:03:08.204
um, who are in place to basically guide a narrative.

02:03:09.224 --> 02:03:14.889
Um, you know, I mean, you put it, you clearly put it better than I do, but, but that kind of thing.

02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:21.795
Um, I mean, I think that would, that would be a good way to answer it.

02:03:22.035 --> 02:03:22.536
It's just like,

02:03:25.362 --> 02:03:31.525
Some of it has to be broad strokes and there are certain things we'll really dive into and certain things we won't.

02:03:31.945 --> 02:03:34.126
That are like better just on your stream.

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:34.707
Do you know what I mean?

02:03:35.067 --> 02:03:35.327
Yeah.

02:03:38.168 --> 02:03:38.909
That's my feeling.

02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:44.631
So I think only because of my schedule we're gonna have to try it again.

02:03:44.932 --> 02:03:45.392
Oh man.

02:03:45.972 --> 02:03:46.312
Stop.

02:03:46.793 --> 02:03:47.313
Get out of here.

02:03:48.593 --> 02:03:51.636
Um, no, I have to take the boys to basketball soon.

02:03:52.416 --> 02:03:53.457
Um, yeah, it's almost two.

02:03:53.777 --> 02:03:54.858
Um, okay.

02:03:54.918 --> 02:03:58.221
Well, um, are you willing to do this with me again?

02:03:58.241 --> 02:04:01.383
I mean, I know it's not start tomorrow morning again, if that's what you want.

02:04:01.423 --> 02:04:07.468
I mean, I, I, I think that you, if you can give me your platform or a very, very important opportunity.

02:04:07.528 --> 02:04:11.431
So I want, I want you to get the sound bite you want.

02:04:11.632 --> 02:04:15.014
I just don't want it to be able to be misconstrued by anybody.

02:04:15.054 --> 02:04:15.455
That's all.

02:04:15.755 --> 02:04:16.495
Um, other than that.

02:04:17.301 --> 02:04:17.481
let's
