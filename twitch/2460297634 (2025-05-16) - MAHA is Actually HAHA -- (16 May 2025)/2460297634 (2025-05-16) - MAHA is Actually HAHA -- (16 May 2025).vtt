WEBVTT

00:07.490 --> 00:08.405
BEEP BEEP

00:32.900 --> 00:47.473
Good morning, everybody I had to update a couple computers suddenly and I wanted to make sure that all was set up and then it does get to Be always there's one more thing needs to happen It looks like everything's back in sync and all the drivers like each other again.

00:47.593 --> 00:55.841
So I think I'm on the air You can confirm that in the chat if you want to it looks to me like after the restart delay.

00:55.861 --> 00:55.881
I

00:57.004 --> 01:05.789
Left-hand Monkey Wrench was original in the chat at 1119, but I do see Tazik's Cube as being the guy who was the number one.

01:06.389 --> 01:07.550
5x5s, he says.

01:09.491 --> 01:10.571
V says it's all good.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.234
How was the movie last night, Hatari Mama?

01:16.274 --> 01:21.337
Let me know in the chat while we watch this first absolutely awesome clip.

01:21.437 --> 01:22.558
Welcome to the show, everybody.

01:26.729 --> 01:36.573
We could call them peasants or poor people or they're jungle people coming out of native cultures that haven't had the benefit of a Western education, choosing my words.

01:37.653 --> 01:41.295
And so they would have these vaccine campaigns for yellow fever.

01:42.255 --> 01:44.056
These people would go get their yellow fever shot.

01:44.596 --> 01:46.797
And then they would say, well, if one is good, two is better.

01:47.137 --> 01:47.937
They get back in line.

01:48.477 --> 01:48.717
Wow.

01:48.737 --> 01:49.998
And they get another shot, they kill them.

01:50.919 --> 02:00.386
Okay, that's the nature of these hotter live attenuated vaccines is it's just a question like everything of getting the dose right.

02:00.867 --> 02:02.788
And if you exceed it, it'll get you.

02:03.609 --> 02:07.872
So the idea was you get the benefits without some of those risks.

02:08.913 --> 02:09.593
What's not to like?

02:11.095 --> 02:19.381
And what's overlooked is that one of the other key discoveries that were made right about the same time, I think I was 29, maybe 30 at that point,

02:21.202 --> 02:24.565
at this company called Vykel, was the negative control.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.008
Yes, I used to do negative controls, like much of the industry.

02:29.189 --> 02:38.236
And the negative control of the RNA without the fat part, without the positively charged fat globs,

02:40.942 --> 02:47.326
actually worked better for producing protein in a mouse model.

02:48.547 --> 02:49.927
And- Did you hear that, Mark?

02:50.127 --> 02:56.411
So that gave rise to this seminal science paper that at the time it was published about the same time, remember Cold Fusion?

02:56.431 --> 02:57.512
Yeah.

02:57.692 --> 03:01.414
So Cold Fusion was out and everybody's like, nah, that's not going to happen.

03:01.474 --> 03:03.715
But they made a big deal about it and then it turned out to be

03:04.916 --> 03:06.877
misinterpretation of their data.

03:08.077 --> 03:16.960
And everybody thought that this naked DNA and naked RNA paper that we put out was going to be another one of those that was a flash in the pan and turns out that we just didn't know what we were doing.

03:17.680 --> 03:23.502
But it's been reproduced all over the world and has a huge number of citations and it works.

03:23.842 --> 03:29.444
And there was a company that was advancing this tech.

03:31.041 --> 03:44.106
in particular, not using pseudo-uridine, that was funded by an obscure investor named Elon Musk called CureVac.

03:45.587 --> 03:58.432
And in the race for the COVID genetic vaccine product, CureVac, to my eyes, did it right.

03:59.602 --> 04:04.646
They did more rigorous, methodical dose escalation studies.

04:05.847 --> 04:10.851
And BioNTech now sold their stuff to Pfizer, so it's BioNTech-Pfizer.

04:11.331 --> 04:13.933
And Moderna kind of went for the grand slam.

04:14.914 --> 04:22.660
And they dosed their animal models initially and then their human trials with really quite high doses of this stuff.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.642
That's been one of the problems is they overdosed it.

04:25.953 --> 04:29.659
Whereas, CureVac kind of did it more methodical, dose escalation.

04:30.099 --> 04:31.241
Found the sweet spot.

04:31.341 --> 04:37.251
And, well, they never got there because they disclosed their initial results at a lower dose.

04:38.177 --> 04:41.478
and everybody else at the same time came out with their high dose results.

04:42.238 --> 04:49.500
And the antibodies, now you're now at a point where you understand that just because you got antibodies, it ain't necessarily saying that it works.

04:49.760 --> 04:49.980
Right.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.761
Okay, but that was another one of the lies that were sold to us.

04:52.921 --> 04:53.961
Yeah.

04:54.542 --> 04:58.283
And the antibody titers were higher when you got the dose higher.

04:58.323 --> 04:59.103
Now, if you adjusted

05:00.097 --> 05:24.026
I'll just interrupt here to point out that he is making these two guys, by listening to them, you are made to accept that antibodies are real and that they can be measured by the commercial devices that are used to measure them in the context that these guys are talking about, which is all a series of assumptions layered on one another.

05:25.205 --> 05:42.280
that we now understand from the Antibody Patent Paradox Law Review article is based on biology that's not quite as specific and as well understood as was previously implied, especially in a lot of this intellectual property.

05:43.101 --> 05:47.985
And so that same intellectual property is the intellectual property that underpins

05:48.829 --> 06:03.384
These lateral flow tests and these PCR exams and all of these notions of immunity are based on measuring and quantifying specific titers of antibody, which

06:06.267 --> 06:07.548
These guys still accept.

06:08.208 --> 06:17.053
They also, without question, accept PCR as a way of tracking the virus, as a way of testing whether or not you have a lot of virus or a little virus.

06:17.553 --> 06:27.099
And this is also something that none of these people in this joke on America ever question because that is the actual foundation.

06:27.939 --> 06:29.580
of the actual narrative.

06:29.640 --> 06:37.342
These guys are still talking about the Scooby-Doo, where they've figured out a mystery about a novel virus that's probably actually from a laboratory all along.

06:37.882 --> 06:40.343
And so that makes the spike protein really dangerous.

06:40.363 --> 06:44.084
So we were really dumb to have made a vaccine to it.

06:44.164 --> 06:45.845
I mean, a vaccine to it.

06:46.345 --> 06:48.568
You see, they always use the word.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.371
They've never gotten past the slave speak.

06:51.451 --> 06:52.192
It's remarkable.

06:52.352 --> 06:54.054
For Dose, they're about the same.

06:54.575 --> 07:00.522
OK, but in the in the kind of media narrative... Look at his smile.

07:01.523 --> 07:05.967
Guided government decision-making and big money.

07:06.127 --> 07:08.729
It's a bit like getting in line for the yellow fever vaccine twice.

07:08.869 --> 07:09.990
It's just more is better.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.512
But what could possibly go wrong, right?

07:13.773 --> 07:21.859
And so that remains an undeveloped thread, and CureVac tried to fight the patent battle

07:23.120 --> 07:24.301
And they've largely lost.

07:25.102 --> 07:27.944
And they're going to be constrained to the dustbin of history.

07:28.064 --> 07:30.065
Is there a place for mRNA?

07:30.085 --> 07:31.886
Because it looks like there's this tidal wave.

07:31.906 --> 07:33.347
Everyone wants it in vaccines.

07:33.447 --> 07:35.289
I've had this question so many times.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.910
The first time I had it was- Well, let me move to a quite different question.

07:37.930 --> 07:39.211
I don't want to be boring here.

07:40.032 --> 07:44.535
Well, let me just give you the- because I've come up with a glib answer that is my go-to now.

07:45.676 --> 07:48.638
And the usual version is, can mRNA be safe?

07:49.198 --> 07:49.338
Yep.

07:49.638 --> 07:49.938
Okay.

07:49.978 --> 07:50.718
As a technology.

07:51.199 --> 07:54.940
And my answer is pigs could fly if they only had wings.

07:55.260 --> 07:58.741
We can speculate that this could be done or that could be done.

07:58.801 --> 08:01.262
And then you would have to do the studies and see if that's the case.

08:01.962 --> 08:05.803
Uh, but, um, you know, anything's possible.

08:07.824 --> 08:17.727
So I would kind of argue that this is a genuinely flat out admission that he has no principles at all, because in theory, he didn't learn anything.

08:17.767 --> 08:18.867
He didn't already know.

08:19.716 --> 08:20.156
in 2020.

08:21.877 --> 08:27.841
But in 2021, when he finally spoke out on the Bret Weinstein podcast, he did not say this.

08:29.262 --> 08:30.062
Pigs could fly.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.084
He did not say that at all.

08:34.745 --> 08:41.589
He told everybody that he took two because he had to travel, even though he knew that there's no way for it to be safe.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.170
I just,

08:43.055 --> 08:45.038
These stories are incongruent.

08:45.579 --> 08:58.036
This joyous man here is not a man who has been injured by a technology that he thought in 2020 was worth him using two of in order to travel internationally.

08:58.616 --> 09:09.261
with Stephen Hatfield, who joked on the Tommy podcast that both he and Robert Malone had forgotten their vaccine cards or didn't have one when they went to Rome.

09:09.321 --> 09:22.868
So it's strange because he tells a story about having taken the vaccine in order to travel, and Stephen Hatfield, a now special advisor to HHS on pandemics, tells a story to Tommy on the Tommy podcast

09:23.348 --> 09:28.851
that actually when he went to Rome with Robert Malone, neither of them had a vaccine passport, and it didn't matter.

09:32.693 --> 09:38.155
Because Robert forgot his, I think is what actually he says, which is, again, it's a narrative.

09:38.196 --> 09:39.116
They're on together.

09:39.156 --> 09:40.217
They're working together.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.017
What's the word?

09:42.057 --> 09:42.918
They're in cahoots.

09:43.318 --> 09:43.658
It is.

09:44.058 --> 09:44.639
It's real.

09:45.539 --> 09:47.860
And this is a joke on America.

09:48.100 --> 09:48.801
It's scary.

09:54.366 --> 09:54.946
It gets worse.

09:54.966 --> 09:58.307
Vaccines for bird flu.

09:59.007 --> 10:08.749
And the statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology.

10:08.789 --> 10:09.949
And I just gagged at that.

10:13.370 --> 10:16.090
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.311
Do you believe, you know, because I mean,

10:21.749 --> 10:24.310
Do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

10:28.112 --> 10:34.936
I think that, so for instance, some of these, like yellow fever is an example.

10:36.617 --> 10:43.701
I think that another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three-year-old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

10:44.522 --> 10:50.725
And there has developed, I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

10:54.535 --> 11:01.357
I think that, so for instance, some of these, like yellow fever is an example.

11:03.018 --> 11:10.100
I think that another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three-year-old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

11:10.300 --> 11:10.500
Yes.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.881
Do you believe that some vaccines are good?

11:16.701 --> 11:23.495
I think that, so for instance, some of these, like yellow fever is an example.

11:25.188 --> 11:32.253
I think that another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three-year-old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

11:32.453 --> 11:32.653
Yes.

11:33.073 --> 11:37.076
And there has developed this kind of vaccine cabal cohort.

11:39.398 --> 11:43.220
I could name a couple of prominent names of academics.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.923
Peter Hotez comes to mind, Bill Offit comes to mind.

11:48.043 --> 11:48.584
Yeah.

11:48.664 --> 11:54.888
People that have vested financial interests and career interests in the logic that

11:55.448 --> 11:57.969
He just lists people who are part of the hamster wheel.

11:58.029 --> 12:08.455
Peter Hotez and now, see if you can drink the amount of whiskey that you would be required to drink if you had to drink every time he said Paul Offit's name in the next two minutes.

12:09.755 --> 12:13.780
that, and there's many of them, they just are the tip of the iceberg.

12:14.721 --> 12:26.015
People that have bought into the idea that the, as Tony Fauci said, when presented with data on vitamin D and influenza, he said, no, we treat flu with vaccines.

12:27.373 --> 12:38.338
There is a logic that it relates to the Overton window, the range of acceptable dialogue in this space, that you shall not talk about certain things.

12:39.599 --> 12:45.862
And there are certain truisms that everybody that is an insider on the cool kids club,

12:46.602 --> 12:55.008
gets all the money and controls the decisions and sits on the advisory committee on immunization practices and the FDA advisory committees, et cetera, et cetera.

12:55.428 --> 13:00.432
They all have to kind of buy in to be part of the club in certain assumptions.

13:00.632 --> 13:03.774
And one of them is that you treat infectious disease with vaccines.

13:03.854 --> 13:04.515
That's the way it is.

13:05.095 --> 13:10.219
And it is so stupid because I think there are places

13:11.311 --> 13:28.793
for certain cohorts, you know, I think you really have to age stratify, you have to stratify by pre-existing conditions, and you have to look at the context, you know, but this, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

13:31.323 --> 13:41.811
certain cohorts, I think you really have to age stratify, you have to stratify by preexisting conditions, and you have to look at the context.

13:42.171 --> 13:45.614
But this idea of everything becomes a nail.

13:46.274 --> 13:50.658
And we recently had Paul Offit come out on a podcast, I don't know if you caught that.

13:51.398 --> 13:58.784
Paul Offit is busy trying to throw Tony Fauci into the bus at the moment and say that it was Tony Fauci who was responsible for the decision.

13:59.884 --> 14:03.026
to jab everybody as opposed to age stratify it.

14:03.347 --> 14:05.488
Kind of did the same thing with AIDS, by the way, too.

14:05.548 --> 14:07.629
He really wanted, you know what I mean?

14:07.669 --> 14:08.450
Everyone's at risk.

14:08.550 --> 14:18.716
And Remdesivir and AZT, and he's got this long history of, you know, hitting everything with the same hammer and not respecting the nuance.

14:18.977 --> 14:24.280
And when you unpack what Offit reports, whether or not it's, you know, it's very convenient for Paul Offit to say.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.462
Do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

14:29.515 --> 14:38.104
Uh, I think that, uh, so for instance, some of these like yellow fever, um, is an example.

14:39.005 --> 14:46.852
Uh, I think that the, the, the, another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three-year-old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

14:47.053 --> 14:47.253
Yes.

14:47.673 --> 14:51.617
And there has developed this kind of vaccine cabal cohort.

14:52.798 --> 14:57.784
Uh, um, I could, I could name a couple of prominent names of academics.

14:58.325 --> 15:02.489
Uh, um, Peter Hotez comes to mind, Bill Offit comes to mind.

15:03.090 --> 15:11.239
Uh, people that have, uh, vested financial interests and career interests in the logic that, uh, and there's many of them.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.341
They just are the tip of the iceberg.

15:14.302 --> 15:25.605
people that have bought into the idea that the, as Tony Fauci said, when presented with data on vitamin D and influenza, he said, no, we treat flu with vaccines.

15:26.985 --> 15:33.487
There is a logic that it relates to the Overton window, the range of acceptable dialogue in this space.

15:35.347 --> 15:37.888
Do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

15:38.993 --> 16:07.595
it relates to the Overton window, the range of acceptable dialogue in this space, that you should, I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good, that, and there's many of them, they just are the tip of the iceberg, people that have bought into the idea that the, as Tony Fauci said, when presented with data on vitamin D and influenza, he said, no, we treat flu with vaccines.

16:09.723 --> 16:14.125
I mean, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

16:15.365 --> 16:23.408
It's to the Overton window, the range of acceptable dialogue in this space, that you shall not talk about certain things.

16:25.068 --> 16:30.950
And there are certain truisms that everybody that is an insider on the kind of the cool kids club.

16:31.550 --> 16:40.074
that gets all the money and controls the decisions and sits on the advisory committee on immunization practices and the FDA advisory committees, et cetera, et cetera.

16:40.514 --> 16:45.497
They all have to kind of buy in to be part of the club in certain assumptions.

16:45.717 --> 16:48.859
And one of them is that you treat infectious disease with vaccines.

16:48.939 --> 16:49.579
That's the way it is.

16:50.179 --> 16:55.282
And it is so stupid because I think there are places

16:56.380 --> 17:07.906
For certain cohorts, I think you really have to age stratify, you have to stratify by preexisting conditions, and you have to look at the context.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.648
But this idea of everything becomes a nail.

17:12.368 --> 17:15.811
And we recently had Paul Offit come out on a podcast.

17:15.831 --> 17:16.751
I don't know if you caught that.

17:17.492 --> 17:27.379
Paul Offit is busy trying to throw Tony Fauci into the bus at the moment and say that it was Tony Fauci who was responsible for the decision to jab everybody as opposed to age stratify it.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.582
He kind of did the same thing with AIDS, by the way, too.

17:31.742 --> 17:32.483
Just kind of?

17:32.503 --> 17:33.664
You know what I mean?

17:33.764 --> 17:34.564
Everyone's at risk.

17:34.664 --> 17:44.833
And Rem Disappear and AZT, and he's got this long history of hitting everything with the same hammer and not respecting the nuance.

17:45.093 --> 17:52.720
And when you unpack what Offit reports, whether or not it's very convenient for Paul Offit to say this, he wasn't busy objecting back in the day.

17:53.540 --> 18:08.254
But, and I'm sure he could pick up his phone and talk to Tony Fauci any day of the week at any point in time as one of the most important vaccinologists in the United States, because he basically redid

18:09.915 --> 18:12.157
a vaccine that was causing intussusception.

18:12.958 --> 18:18.903
And, you know, a case can be made that what they really did was cook the data so that they didn't get the adverse event that they picked up.

18:19.043 --> 18:21.585
By the way, I mean, you're talking about the rotavirus vaccine.

18:21.625 --> 18:24.207
Intussusception is sort of like your intestines, you know.

18:24.327 --> 18:24.988
Fold onto it.

18:25.028 --> 18:26.229
Fold onto themselves.

18:26.309 --> 18:26.969
Onto themselves.

18:27.009 --> 18:27.970
It can be deadly.

18:27.990 --> 18:28.771
Yeah, you get obstruction.

18:28.891 --> 18:36.778
And Paul Offit was on the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices for the CDC that approves and recommends the vaccines.

18:37.338 --> 18:38.620
for the childhood schedule.

18:39.020 --> 18:49.732
He was on that committee, did not recuse himself for getting a rotavirus vaccine onto the schedule while he was making one, had a multi-million dollar deal.

18:49.832 --> 18:55.359
It's one of the greatest examples of- Pretty much in your face.

18:55.399 --> 18:56.780
Pretty much in your face.

18:56.941 --> 18:57.141
All right.

18:59.740 --> 19:00.762
Good morning, everybody.

19:00.842 --> 19:01.843
Welcome to the show.

19:01.863 --> 19:04.266
I hope I made my point with that video.

19:04.306 --> 19:05.448
That was just very recently.

19:05.488 --> 19:09.292
I don't know exactly how recent it could have been a couple months ago or a couple weeks ago.

19:09.352 --> 19:09.693
I don't know.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.634
Does it really matter?

19:12.336 --> 19:14.439
That's not the Robert Malone that we saw in 2021.

19:16.521 --> 19:17.942
And that's not the message.

19:18.643 --> 19:20.844
So there were principles that he didn't have.

19:21.485 --> 19:23.406
I think there were lots of lies that he told.

19:23.926 --> 19:30.891
And I think if you want to see them, you can go look up his work with the George Webb associate, Paul Cottrell.

19:31.391 --> 19:41.018
You can go look up his work with the podcast from 2023 or two with Jay Bhattacharya is really remarkable.

19:41.078 --> 19:42.439
And it's still on Spotify.

19:42.839 --> 19:45.441
It's just a real gem of a list of admissions.

19:46.842 --> 19:48.083
I will be back in a second.

19:48.123 --> 19:50.145
I still gotta figure out what song I'm gonna play here.

19:53.688 --> 19:54.889
I don't care how you get there.

19:54.909 --> 19:57.572
I don't care what you do to get there.

19:57.592 --> 20:00.234
The goal is to win.

20:17.239 --> 20:29.403
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

20:44.953 --> 20:54.888
Regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin

21:06.306 --> 21:09.727
He says, son, can you play me a memory?

21:10.648 --> 21:13.889
I'm not really sure how it goes.

21:14.629 --> 21:21.852
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete when I wore a young man's clothes.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.665
Sing us a song, you're the piano man.

21:39.586 --> 21:43.151
Sing us a song tonight.

21:43.251 --> 21:46.415
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody.

21:47.536 --> 21:49.158
And you've got us feeling all right.

22:05.598 --> 22:19.976
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there's some place that he'd rather be

22:23.527 --> 22:31.050
He says, Bill, I believe this is killing me, as a smile ran away from his face.

22:31.070 --> 22:39.293
Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star if I could get out of this place.

22:40.053 --> 22:42.494
Oh, la, la, la, dee, dee, da.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.976
La, la, dee, dee, da.

22:52.193 --> 23:07.058
Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talking with David Who's still in the Navy And probably will be flying

23:18.601 --> 23:32.808
The waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinking alone

23:52.401 --> 23:54.102
You're the piano man.

23:54.722 --> 23:57.604
Sing us a song tonight.

23:58.124 --> 24:01.826
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody.

24:02.726 --> 24:04.787
And you've got us feeling all right.

24:20.643 --> 24:35.182
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see To forget about life for a while

24:41.147 --> 24:52.931
And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, man, what are you doing here?

25:08.287 --> 25:21.341
You're a piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you got us feeling all right

25:39.993 --> 25:55.083
asking ye shall receive something like that um there's a zoom link in the chat if you want to join now i won't put your face on you don't have to put your face on but i guess that was the whole idea of the zoom link so there is one in the chat if you want to join it

25:55.743 --> 26:00.128
You'll be able to see the stream there as well, because I am streaming to the Zoom meeting.

26:00.508 --> 26:08.217
I really just pulled that song out of my basketball playlist, which is actually quite a long playlist.

26:08.257 --> 26:09.398
Welcome to the show, everybody.

26:09.438 --> 26:10.400
Good to see everyone.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.441
I'll be here in a second.

26:15.146 --> 26:15.566
The End

26:45.493 --> 26:52.526
I don't know, I don't know if we'll leave that zoom link open forever if nobody joins it and I'm not suggesting that you need to.

26:52.546 --> 26:55.712
I just wanted to show you how easy it would be to do that.

26:57.401 --> 27:05.852
to have a little Zoom meeting of GigaOM Biological fans and viewers, to put faces to names in the chat.

27:05.912 --> 27:06.713
I'm all about that.

27:06.853 --> 27:10.618
I like to build a community, even if it's from people from far away.

27:10.678 --> 27:13.061
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice you hear is that of Jonathan Cui.

27:13.081 --> 27:15.844
I'm Chief Biologist at GigaOM Biological, coming to you live.

27:16.365 --> 27:18.465
from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

27:19.566 --> 27:32.548
I helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America, write the book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, and afterward was hired as a staff scientist by Children's Health Defense, who later fired me for talking about Robert Malone.

27:33.049 --> 27:44.791
And that's why I regularly feature Robert Malone as a timeline, because I do think that Robert Malone is essentially an insider, somebody operating for the larger weaponized piles of money

27:45.351 --> 28:02.881
that run this show and I think Jay Bhattacharya is more or less an unwitting participant who's agreed to do what he's told and and and order people around based on what he's told and you know be this middle manager guy I guess I don't know he was my friend at one point there's not any

28:03.581 --> 28:07.723
You know, there's not any nefarious reason why these these photos exist.

28:07.763 --> 28:16.446
We we met a couple times couple three times during the pandemic and he seemed like a reasonable guy when I met him and a funny dude and etc.

28:17.226 --> 28:19.747
I'm trying to bring this to the basketball court.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.048
It's taken me a long time.

28:21.608 --> 28:28.870
to get in shape enough so that I'm not embarrassed like I kind of am of the first few episodes of JAC on the hardwood.

28:29.070 --> 28:44.514
My ideas are also kind of misrepresented, but represented, obfuscated, diluted on a substack called Woodhouse 76, which is primarily written by an American by the name of Jessica Hockett, although it's kind of a brainchild, I assume, of

28:46.075 --> 29:09.391
Nick Hudson and just Jonathan Engler where they have conversations with these people like Claire Craig and Pierre Corey Mike Eden and even Jay Bhattacharya apparently Using my ideas, but a watered-down version of them, but you know, that's how this works That's why after presenting to Panda so many times they still haven't managed to find any of those videos I guess they didn't record them something like that.

29:09.972 --> 29:11.853
Oh, I hear somebody in that in that in

29:12.273 --> 29:29.154
in that thing you gotta you gotta mute yourself in your in your zoomie zoomer oh my goodness is that welcome to eagle holy buckets there's some people in the chat in there i see you guys wow nice cool um there's some people in the zoom meeting ah i didn't expect that that's nice

29:30.294 --> 29:31.955
Yeah, so this is GigaOM Biological.

29:32.695 --> 29:36.817
If you want to share the stream, please share it from stream.gigaom.bio.

29:37.357 --> 29:39.558
I'm going to bounce out of here for a second.

29:40.298 --> 29:44.440
Actually, I probably can't do that during the live stream because I'm living to YouTube.

29:45.060 --> 29:49.882
But it's really quite extraordinary how impossible it is for GigaOM to grow on any of these platforms.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.043
That's why we've

29:52.051 --> 29:57.194
decided to try this PeerTube instance, which is stream.gigaom.bio.

29:57.614 --> 30:09.180
It seems to work really well for me most of the time, but if you have any complaints during the live stream or replay, please let me know so that I can decide whether it's working well enough or not.

30:10.721 --> 30:15.624
I do think I just transition right away here to another video before I go to my main

30:16.860 --> 30:28.511
Before I go to my main video, I want to start out with this just to let you know that I believe, and I think I have a lot of

30:41.559 --> 30:52.483
evidence from my interaction with them that Robert Malone is part of a group of people behind these would-be mystery solvers.

30:52.523 --> 30:54.104
That's the best way to describe them.

30:54.144 --> 31:08.790
Because everybody that has risen to a point of prominence in the Trump administration on this side of the narrative, on the MAHA side, the Health Freedom Movement narrative, has risen on this sort of

31:10.200 --> 31:32.636
amorphous objection to something about vaccines, an amorphous understanding of what autism is, an amorphous understanding of the importance of the microbiome for something, and kind of being convinced that this is a pivotal moment in this truth movement.

31:33.757 --> 31:49.240
And I think that this is an elaborate hoax, which has been perpetrated on America over the course of almost two decades, but certainly in the last decade, it has been carefully orchestrated by a number of key players and behind them,

31:50.211 --> 31:56.133
I think are people related to the Human Genome Project, to the Department of Energy, to the Department of Defense.

31:56.713 --> 32:06.016
And one of those people that has been put in front of us on the sort of conservative social media bubble that we're in is Robert Malone.

32:06.096 --> 32:16.720
And Robert Malone is a crucial sort of landmark to look at through this timeline to see that it's impossible for his

32:18.697 --> 32:32.351
fingerprints to be in all of these places over this long of a time period and then have him just be a innocent emu farmer and horse breeder who's come out of retirement to save the world and consults for the Vatican now.

32:34.924 --> 32:36.705
So I am thrilled to have.

32:37.125 --> 32:42.808
And so that's how we have Jay Bhattacharya at the head of NIH telling us the gain of function is real.

32:43.008 --> 32:45.589
Bringing science back into the NIH.

32:46.629 --> 32:56.874
There was a lab leak, and I want to get to that here in a second, but I've got to touch on the news of the day, and it's not really his area of expertise, but the president just signed an executive order to lower drug costs.

32:58.615 --> 33:01.336
Doctor, welcome to the program, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.

33:01.696 --> 33:03.597
Any comment on that as we get started here?

33:04.807 --> 33:07.609
Sure, it's actually something I studied in a past life.

33:07.829 --> 33:21.197
Just ask yourself the question, what would happen if Donald Trump put out an executive order that fireworks were not to be sold in the United States anymore?

33:23.079 --> 33:24.039
What would happen then?

33:25.040 --> 33:25.620
What happens?

33:25.660 --> 33:27.241
What's the enforcement mechanism?

33:27.281 --> 33:29.783
Who's gonna start stopping all that?

33:32.025 --> 33:32.685
How does that work?

33:33.046 --> 33:34.387
Do they send the ATF in?

33:34.447 --> 33:35.307
What's going on here?

33:35.908 --> 33:40.711
It's just trying to get you to ask the real questions like, so what?

33:40.951 --> 33:47.616
And a good friend of mine has often coached me recently to make sure that I'm answering the question, so what?

33:49.276 --> 33:51.538
as a counterpoint, asking the question, so what?

33:51.598 --> 33:59.102
Make sure you don't allow people on these podcasts to say things without justifying with the so what.

33:59.162 --> 34:05.505
Like they can't just tell you that, you know, A is a bad guy because B has been oppressed.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.361
and then not explain the so what of it.

34:09.662 --> 34:11.843
That's just getting you to accept something.

34:11.883 --> 34:18.367
And here, we are being made to accept a lab leak, the potential for more lab leaks, the terrifying nature of it.

34:19.087 --> 34:26.971
Not that dissimilar to Kim.com two years ago on Twitter talking about how they're much better than nuclear bombs.

34:30.020 --> 34:37.626
The difference in drug prices between the United States and Europe is sharp and alarming, and it's been persistent for decades.

34:38.226 --> 34:47.013
The Americans pay... So wait, they just state that there was a lab leak, but first we're going to talk about drug prices.

34:47.133 --> 34:48.855
That is the kind of malevolent,

34:50.416 --> 34:52.177
It's neuro-linguistic programming.

34:52.237 --> 34:57.421
Start with three assumptions, then not talk about them for 10 minutes, and then come back to those assumptions.

34:57.581 --> 35:01.164
It's not even a magic trick.

35:01.304 --> 35:03.886
It's neuro-linguistic programming.

35:03.926 --> 35:10.431
It's well-tested language tricks that have been used in advertising and in movies.

35:12.443 --> 35:22.974
and now can be used in a military fashion on social media because we have acquiesced to its ubiquitous use in place of real thinking.

35:25.762 --> 35:30.847
between two to five times, sometimes as high as 10 times the price of the same drug.

35:31.147 --> 35:34.931
I mean, if I could show you what my studio looks like, it's a hell of a lot better than that.

35:35.051 --> 35:39.575
And Verla behind the glass with the three kids up on the, on the control deck.

35:39.595 --> 35:42.178
Can you guys, um, signal in for a minute?

35:43.259 --> 35:43.759
There we go.

35:43.839 --> 35:44.440
See, there we go.

35:44.500 --> 35:44.900
That's it.

35:44.961 --> 35:45.221
Nice.

35:46.342 --> 35:47.403
As Europeans do.

35:47.943 --> 35:50.126
And, uh, you know, as a professor who has a,

35:50.885 --> 35:58.228
you know, as a PhD in economics, I'll tell you, when you see persistent price differences like that, that indicates a very unhealthy market.

35:58.888 --> 36:06.551
And in this particular case, what it means is that American consumers essentially are being taken advantage of.

36:06.591 --> 36:11.573
American patients are paying through the nose for drugs that Europeans pay for.

36:13.635 --> 36:18.879
I mean, he's not so I am thrilled to have he's nothing but a mouthpiece for the administration.

36:18.919 --> 36:21.140
He's not doing anything at NIH.

36:21.220 --> 36:39.453
I mean, quite frankly, you could think of him as the opposite of Francis Collins, who I'm sure had a very, very well thought out agenda for a very long time as he was at the head of NIH, you could almost see this as potentially an outward signal that NIH is just unmoored.

36:40.314 --> 36:41.335
They've, they've

36:42.279 --> 36:44.362
detached all the boats from the harbor.

36:44.382 --> 36:47.406
They're just letting them float away.

36:47.426 --> 36:50.511
It's, it's actually kind of scary.

36:51.872 --> 37:13.066
I mean, if you know what you're seeing here and you understand how we flipped from somebody like Francis Collins with a 20 or 30 year time plan that he had 20 or 30 years to make excuses about and claim multiple times that the Human Genome Project had reached a new landmark, what kind of director is Jay Bhattacharya gonna be?

37:14.527 --> 37:16.769
Think about that as you listen to this video.

37:16.789 --> 37:18.110
This cannot be good.

37:19.099 --> 37:27.345
Especially when you realize that for some odd reason, this guy spent a weird amount of time around me.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.407
He's on my phone.

37:32.452 --> 37:34.173
We're in trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

37:34.213 --> 37:39.115
And unfortunately, I'm one of the few people who's seen this alien from so many different angles.

37:39.155 --> 37:42.776
So I gotta give this up while I can give it up.

37:42.856 --> 37:48.559
I gotta make sure that as many people hear it as possible because this, for me, this is just wacky.

37:49.219 --> 37:59.764
The kind of stuff that's happening right now, I could not have predicted a year ago because it would have been essentially like, okay, take all the people on your chalkboard

38:00.564 --> 38:04.267
and then put them in places that you least expect them to get to.

38:04.827 --> 38:05.388
Boom.

38:06.549 --> 38:06.789
Right?

38:06.949 --> 38:12.113
At some point, I didn't even think of the idea that Bobby Kennedy would ever run for office.

38:12.853 --> 38:19.899
I thought he was an anti-vax guy and an environmentalist who called me because he wanted help and he wanted to help me.

38:22.483 --> 38:25.784
I was like fooled when he said he was going to run for office.

38:25.824 --> 38:27.845
I thought, Oh my goodness, this is amazing.

38:27.925 --> 38:33.687
Like, could this really be the, the start of something that nobody imagined?

38:35.868 --> 38:42.390
Then I stumbled on this, this Jesse Ventura book from Skyhorse publishing.

38:42.410 --> 38:47.212
And it's still, it still took years to sink in, in reality, like maybe even

38:49.696 --> 38:54.457
and maybe even two full years before I understood the depth of the play.

38:56.498 --> 39:02.299
But this is a long con, ladies and gentlemen, with a number of people recruited a number of years ago.

39:03.179 --> 39:13.662
And then they have wittingly and unwitting recruits that they're using, that they're not grooming is the wrong word, but sort of training along.

39:16.451 --> 39:24.175
And the ones that are, you know, they are naive enough or busy enough to be useful, they've used them.

39:24.575 --> 39:27.236
But the vast majority of them, they just get stood in front of.

39:28.236 --> 39:30.598
Very few like Brandy Vaughn get killed.

39:32.859 --> 39:38.841
But this, this is remarkable because this is exactly where we are right now in American history.

39:38.861 --> 39:41.963
And you have to wonder what's actually going on at the FBI.

39:44.111 --> 39:58.358
If Comey thinks that it's okay to do what he did and they're making all this big fuss about the fact that it's a numerical threat to the president, maybe it's just an obvious statement about what's possible.

39:59.639 --> 40:09.524
That a statement like that is protected by free speech, that there's nothing Trump can do about it, that Trump will do nothing about it.

40:11.303 --> 40:14.867
that the FBI has nobody to do anything about it.

40:14.907 --> 40:17.610
They're talking about the Secret Service should do something about it.

40:17.650 --> 40:19.111
I mean, think about this for a minute.

40:21.574 --> 40:23.316
This is a theater, ladies and gentlemen.

40:23.336 --> 40:24.737
It's a very interesting theater.

40:24.757 --> 40:29.643
I wonder what, I don't know, Bill Barr would think about this and what his response would be.

40:32.173 --> 40:38.857
Because this is the funny part of the theater on the internet right now.

40:39.018 --> 40:51.346
And I think, quite frankly, it's very important for us to, as a country, to get off of X. X is only going to get worse.

40:52.680 --> 41:16.768
X is gonna be the place where AI is gonna be allowed to run rampant and that we're gonna ask Elon Musk to clean it up or to save us from the fakes or anything like, all of that's gonna happen on X if we continue to use that platform and continue to acquiesce to it because all of these people insist on using it.

41:18.217 --> 41:34.064
It's not for nothing that Nicole Shanahan, a billionaire owner of Google, said something like, oh yeah, my account on X is just thoughts that come from my head right to the phone, because that's what you should think of everything on Twitter as.

41:38.406 --> 41:42.848
OK, so let's see if this is worth going for a little while.

41:45.109 --> 41:46.350
No, not.

41:48.556 --> 41:49.037
Oh, it's over?

41:49.278 --> 41:49.478
What?

41:50.120 --> 41:51.021
Did I start?

41:51.082 --> 41:52.765
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya on with us.

41:52.785 --> 41:56.393
He's from the... There won't be any R&D on drugs.

41:57.119 --> 42:26.091
but the president's executive order does that help europeans look this is not fair to americans this is actually lowering the investment that we ought to be making on are at the for drug uh... and so that uh... the that they should be paying prices that are equal to a level of americans pay in america to playing might much lower prices that we do pay much closer to competitive prices uh... it's a huge move forward and i would like to have to be at what they what you're at what you're going to do and what the drug companies do in response but uh...

42:26.571 --> 42:29.033
To me, I've been hearing about this problem for decades.

42:29.213 --> 42:33.196
It's the first time I've seen a president really take a big step forward to try to address it.

42:33.276 --> 42:39.321
I mean, as somebody who is in, you know, research for a very long time, doesn't the promise of AI, AGI, ASI,

42:44.665 --> 43:02.451
lessen this whole thing of we need gobs of money to be able to do R&D, because that should, you know, maybe five years from now, begin to cut those costs dramatically to take that chair away from the table, or put that chair back into the table, if you will.

43:03.611 --> 43:05.832
Yeah, no, that is actually a quite promising thing.

43:05.852 --> 43:11.854
So, I mean, just to give one example, there's this technology called AlphaFold that allows

43:13.200 --> 43:25.148
scientists to much more easily understand how proteins will fold on each fold and how, and as a result, hopefully, and he was dramatically reduced broad development expenditures.

43:25.808 --> 43:29.851
This guy has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.

43:30.831 --> 43:38.256
Alpha fold was given to him on his script, which he can freely hold in his hands and read because he's not on camera.

43:40.805 --> 43:42.566
Wow, I mean, this is shocking.

43:42.626 --> 43:46.987
Glenn Beck says, what about AI, JGSI, ASI, GI?

43:47.587 --> 44:02.571
What about all the abbreviations for machine learning that just basically try to exaggerate its usefulness and it's differentiated from brute force computing instead of, you know, and make people believe that it's about to wake up and take over.

44:03.071 --> 44:05.832
This is a massive joke.

44:06.718 --> 44:09.420
You can't see it with this Marlboro Man picture, you know?

44:09.520 --> 44:19.527
Come on, the head of the NIH is on a podcast with a guy with that studio who uses this graphic and we're supposed to take this seriously.

44:20.888 --> 44:23.090
But that's what social media says is reality.

44:24.191 --> 44:25.852
This is the good part of the internet, right?

44:28.390 --> 44:30.013
We have to wake up to where we are.

44:30.234 --> 44:32.097
We have to wake up to where our friends are.

44:32.578 --> 44:38.250
We have to wake up to where our family is, because some of our family members think that this is the shizzle.

44:38.991 --> 44:44.194
that these guys are, man, Jay Bhattacharya is one of the few guys we can all agree on, right?

44:45.315 --> 44:50.258
Says Krauss and Kali Means.

44:51.038 --> 44:59.263
I mean, it's... Drug development is always gonna be expensive, so you still have to run randomized, large-scale clinical trials, and those are gonna be expensive.

44:59.963 --> 45:08.028
But the initial steps of drug development with AI, and as well, the clinical trials are gonna be much more efficiently run over time.

45:09.169 --> 45:33.926
I don't think it's worth dismissing the fact that Robert Malone supposedly at the beginning of the pandemic was using AI to screen all of the known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog for potential interactions with the 3C protease of the

45:36.553 --> 45:48.696
and some other proteins of the virus using computer generated or a computer model of x-ray crystallography of those proteins.

45:49.497 --> 46:02.661
And on a Tommy podcast, he also said he was using laser scanning confocal microscopy, which kind of implied that he was doing a lot of cell cultures with fluorescence and then just reading them in bulk.

46:05.618 --> 46:17.606
And so he was feeding those results into AI, or he was using laser scanning confocal microscopy to test candidates that the AI picked out.

46:17.626 --> 46:20.808
But anyway, that was all three weeks in January.

46:21.649 --> 46:28.214
And by then he was already treating himself with funmotidine, albeit a very, very much higher dose than you use when you use Pepsin.

46:28.234 --> 46:30.175
But you know, this is experimental.

46:30.195 --> 46:34.458
And so it's not very ethical for him to tell that, that he did that to himself.

46:35.845 --> 46:44.370
But he did, and that's part of the same story as him taking the mRNA to travel and then being also vaccine injured for a while.

46:46.111 --> 46:52.274
And so that guy, Robert Malone, is actually seminal in this guy making NIH director.

46:52.674 --> 47:00.359
And I can only assume that because before the election, I saw Jay Bhattacharya at a barbecue

47:01.059 --> 47:16.792
And he told me at the barbecue and then also at a dinner and then also at the hotel the next day when I was waiting to get my whatever ride to the airport that I should just stop naming names and just teach the biology because you're so good at it.

47:16.812 --> 47:19.655
But just stop saying Robert Malone's name.

47:23.448 --> 47:34.857
Now, unfortunately, if Jay Bhattacharya was put up to that by a very, very smart intelligence agent, and I'm now being played into saying Robert Malone's name for the rest of my life, I guess then I am a victim.

47:36.018 --> 47:39.899
However, I am not stopping saying Robert Malone's name.

47:39.960 --> 47:56.286
I will continue to say Robert Malone's name because I think he's central to this narrative, very similar to the Spars pandemic narrative, but with many more players, many more layers, and a many much, much more thorough script

47:56.986 --> 48:08.132
with many little convoluted traps inside of it so that there's lots of places for people to argue independently of each other and never step on anybody's toes and everybody gets a substack and it's all well and good.

48:10.853 --> 48:19.577
That you need to have trillions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars to develop a single drug, we hope will become a thing of the past.

48:19.938 --> 48:23.539
In any case, there's no reason why Americans should be shouldering the burden for the whole rest of the world.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.241
The developed world should be bearing this burden together.

48:27.093 --> 48:36.743
Let me switch, you know, I originally reached out to you because I wanted to talk to you about the HHS halting work at high-risk infectious disease labs.

48:37.043 --> 48:42.989
Now that's exactly the same kind of neurolinguistic programming that they use in a comedy routine.

48:43.509 --> 48:45.151
I'm going to give you an example of it.

48:47.513 --> 48:50.957
One of the best, so you can sort of map out, what is that?

48:53.325 --> 48:54.826
Please tell me, okay, shit.

48:55.026 --> 48:56.807
I thought I saw something else in my backyard.

48:58.669 --> 49:07.815
If you watch a really well done comedy routine, you will see that certain jokes come back about 10 minutes later.

49:08.975 --> 49:10.797
They come back about eight minutes later.

49:10.837 --> 49:14.739
And the way that they come back as a reference, which ties back to the original thing.

49:15.299 --> 49:18.161
One of the best examples I have is this,

49:22.542 --> 49:43.175
episode with the golf balls and Kramer comes in and he's got a bucket full of balls and he says let's go to the ocean and hit these in it'll be the best thing ever and then all the way through the thing there's all kinds of jokes about golf balls and stuff like that and there's a there's a whale that gets that gets beached and and and and

49:44.276 --> 50:01.487
and George always wanted to be a marine biologist and at the very end of the the show George is telling this story about the sea was angry that day and he gets swept up on top of the whale and he looks down into the blowhole and there's a golf ball in it and that's the end of the episode and it's a

50:02.953 --> 50:10.778
This tactic can be applied in a podcast where you start out the podcast with assumption, assumption, assumption.

50:11.299 --> 50:12.239
There was a virus.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.301
Millions of people died from it.

50:14.601 --> 50:16.182
And it was probably from gain of function.

50:16.202 --> 50:23.047
But let's talk about this executive order from Trump on on lowering drug prices and tell me what you think that means relative to the EU.

50:23.407 --> 50:26.229
And then 10 minutes later, we come back to this.

50:26.489 --> 50:30.572
And so you're all your brain is almost like, oh, yeah, that's that's right.

50:30.592 --> 50:31.592
Oh, great.

50:31.732 --> 50:32.213
Thank you.

50:32.253 --> 50:32.773
That feels good.

50:32.853 --> 50:33.173
Good.

50:33.833 --> 50:40.937
It's very similar to how it feels when the story comes and you're almost like, oh my gosh, is George going to pull out a golf ball?

50:43.538 --> 50:44.618
But it's more subtle.

50:45.379 --> 50:46.379
It's more malevolent.

50:47.039 --> 50:48.800
But it's just as effective.

50:48.880 --> 51:01.326
But instead of laughing, what happens is this assumption of a gain-of-function virus and virology and the fact that they can make these things and design them is accepted.

51:02.208 --> 51:06.729
and one magic bingo around the world.

51:06.929 --> 51:11.610
And I can't believe this is true, but you tell me.

51:12.411 --> 51:16.032
So there was an incident that... There you go.

51:16.112 --> 51:16.812
Callback.

51:16.892 --> 51:18.352
That's what it is in improv.

51:18.692 --> 51:20.133
That's what it is in comedy.

51:20.733 --> 51:20.833
And

51:21.853 --> 51:35.974
and and priming the mark would be another way to think about it in a longer con excellent gentlemen thank you if or ma'am if that's what it is at supposed to be all cat ladies in the chat according to a bio lab i don't know that apparently

51:37.133 --> 51:48.477
what happened is there was a, I don't know, a personal squabble between people and a contractor actually punched a hole in the other person's bio lab suit.

51:49.318 --> 51:55.560
I don't know to get them sick or whatever, but it, it was, I mean, is that what happened at that bio lab?

51:55.600 --> 51:56.781
I think it was at Fort Dietrich.

51:58.521 --> 52:00.362
That is exactly what happened.

52:00.382 --> 52:00.762
I learned.

52:01.122 --> 52:01.282
Yeah.

52:01.322 --> 52:05.804
It was, it was, I haven't been scared about anything in the shop except for that one

52:06.737 --> 52:09.940
I learned about this about three weeks into the job.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.882
I haven't been scared about anything on this job except this.

52:13.963 --> 52:17.045
I learned about it about three weeks after I was on the job.

52:17.505 --> 52:18.206
Stop lying!

52:18.406 --> 52:19.907
Oh, no, actually, I shouldn't say that.

52:19.967 --> 52:20.988
Jay's not lying there.

52:21.048 --> 52:27.372
I'm sure he's actually... This script was given to me three weeks after I got on the job.

52:27.432 --> 52:29.194
That's how it should have been said.

52:33.308 --> 52:35.849
No way, did Kevin Spacey have a hole in the suit?

52:36.229 --> 52:37.009
Are you kidding me?

52:37.769 --> 52:38.470
That's awesome.

52:39.390 --> 52:39.770
Wow.

52:39.930 --> 52:41.270
Yeah, positive pressure.

52:41.310 --> 52:41.950
There you go.

52:42.211 --> 52:42.971
Excellent point.

52:43.131 --> 52:43.691
Well done.

52:43.871 --> 52:44.771
Bing, bang, boom.

52:45.471 --> 52:47.352
Also, man, my chat is sharp.

52:47.972 --> 52:49.333
My chat is sharp today.

52:49.633 --> 52:56.455
Since the beginning of April, it turns out that there had been a incident a few weeks before.

52:56.475 --> 52:59.595
Right before I joined as the NIH director,

53:02.407 --> 53:10.676
at Fort Detrick, a part of the lab is run by the National Institute of Health, and it's a DSL-4 lab, which is the highest biosecurity level lab.

53:11.997 --> 53:17.383
I mean, the lab, the experiments done there are on some really nasty bugs.

53:17.623 --> 53:20.847
I mean, you know, Ebola, a whole bunch of like

53:21.334 --> 53:29.016
viruses and pathogens that if it gets out in the population or if it infects lab workers, it's just feeling quite deadly.

53:29.196 --> 53:35.838
There is no possible way he's doing anything but saying what he's told because this guy doesn't know anything.

53:35.898 --> 53:40.940
He, I have him saying on my podcast about nine different times.

53:42.100 --> 53:43.841
I really don't know Jay, you're the biologist.

53:45.054 --> 53:46.636
I don't know, Jay, you're the biologist.

53:46.696 --> 53:48.978
I defer to you, Jay, because you're the biologist.

53:49.879 --> 53:55.105
And now he's an absolute expert in bioweapons and the contents of Fort Detrick.

53:55.766 --> 54:04.496
I guess because at NIH, once you get the directorship, they just take you around to all the facilities, show you the room, make sure you know how to get in the parking garage, that kind of stuff.

54:06.037 --> 54:24.945
And what I'd learned was that there'd been this incident just a couple weeks before I joined as director of the NIH where a lab worker had cut a hole in a biocontainment suit of a fellow worker with the express intention of getting that worker infected.

54:25.954 --> 54:28.557
That sounds like a great place to work.

54:29.637 --> 54:31.259
Maybe that's, Oh, wow.

54:31.399 --> 54:34.822
You know, I mean, Bruce Ivins was probably doing that to people.

54:34.862 --> 54:35.843
He just never got caught.

54:37.164 --> 54:43.770
If that, if that, if that, and apparently it was over some lovers that are, or I'm not sure exactly the full details.

54:43.790 --> 54:45.312
There's an ongoing investigation of that.

54:45.812 --> 54:52.158
Um, uh, what I learned was that, that, that, that the, uh, not just that this incident had happened,

54:52.999 --> 54:57.723
which actually has a threat, not just to the worker, but also if that gets out.

54:58.323 --> 54:58.624
Yeah.

54:58.704 --> 55:03.127
I mean, it's just, I mean, I was actually, I mean, I was absolutely livid.

55:03.647 --> 55:07.310
Um, and so, uh, what I did is like, I got mad.

55:07.931 --> 55:17.238
So what I did was, Oh, I can't wait to hear what Jay Bhattacharya does when he's mad first, he straightens up his spine lab on an operational shutdown.

55:17.867 --> 55:33.702
secured all of the vials of the nasty bugs in a safe environment, made sure that the animals were cared for, that they're in the lab, and we're not going to open that up until the safety environment of the lab is absolutely solid.

55:34.382 --> 55:39.584
The contractor that was overseeing this, I think, did a very lax job.

55:39.604 --> 55:49.289
What I learned is that this goes back to the Biden administration, that the safety environment in the lab essentially downplayed these kinds of security problems.

55:50.389 --> 55:54.931
If you're going to run experiments on these bugs, and I'm not, personally, I'm not

55:55.649 --> 56:10.804
sold that all of you can confirm that we're doing but in any case if you're going to run them you have a absolute responsibility to have zero tolerance for safety problems right is that uh... it's but but but the uh... the issue here was just a one-off thing it was something

56:11.504 --> 56:21.069
That was problematic in the safety culture of this lab where I don't like I cannot guarantee That if we reopen the lab right now, that would be a safe environment.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.289
I won't reopen the lab.

56:22.429 --> 56:22.889
Thank you.

56:22.909 --> 56:24.030
That's the case Thank you.

56:24.070 --> 56:24.470
Thank you.

56:24.530 --> 56:24.950
Thank you.

56:25.731 --> 56:27.892
I mean shouldn't that person be punished?

56:28.152 --> 56:33.094
I mean that really is attempted murder and maybe even on a mass scale and

56:34.585 --> 56:41.890
I mean, there's an ongoing investigation, so I shouldn't say much more about this, but it's one of those things where I was actually actively scared when I first heard it.

56:41.910 --> 56:47.915
Yeah, I mean, I think Americans are actively scared because none of this stuff should be happening.

56:48.415 --> 56:58.122
I mean, we are just, we're just an accident or a stupid move or an intentional leak away from mass death.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.784
And you know, you keep hearing people like Bill Gates say,

57:01.124 --> 57:02.846
We're on the verge of another pandemic.

57:03.446 --> 57:03.746
Why?

57:04.147 --> 57:04.387
Why?

57:04.807 --> 57:07.750
I mean, why are we on the verge of another pandemic?

57:07.930 --> 57:08.791
Do you think we are?

57:08.811 --> 57:12.915
I mean, you know, pandemics happen.

57:12.975 --> 57:14.216
That's happened all throughout history.

57:14.917 --> 57:18.300
The key thing to me, though, Glenn, is we don't want, we don't want to cause one.

57:18.320 --> 57:22.804
We don't want to increase the risk of them.

57:23.445 --> 57:26.407
The irony of this past pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic,

57:27.583 --> 57:33.809
is that it was very likely caused by actions aimed at stopping pandemics from happening.

57:34.669 --> 57:38.913
There was almost a hubris, but it is hubris.

57:39.113 --> 57:51.965
There was this idea that we could somehow, if we go into the bat caves of China and all the wild places, bring all of those viruses that we find there and pathogens that we find there into the lab, catalog them,

57:52.392 --> 57:57.853
we can somehow prevent all pandemics from happening, make them more transmissible, more dangerous to humans.

57:58.173 --> 58:03.394
We can somehow, as a result of that exercise, make it less likely to have pandemics happening.

58:03.974 --> 58:08.795
But of course, what we found out is the opposite is true, that you can't do this kind of work entirely safely.

58:08.975 --> 58:17.417
And actually, even if you fully accomplish what was the aim of that research program, which is to go out in the wild places and find the pathogens,

58:18.283 --> 58:20.184
you wouldn't protect anybody against the pathogen.

58:20.224 --> 58:32.772
Because what would happen is, when and if the outbreak happens, whatever countermeasures you designed for them would already be out of date, because the evolutionary biology of these viruses is that they mutate very rapidly.

58:33.532 --> 58:40.336
And so when they got into the population, the countermeasures you prepared for, which you never tested any humans, very likely would not work.

58:43.218 --> 58:46.200
Have we stopped all of the gain-of-function stuff now?

58:46.360 --> 58:47.621
Are you convinced it's done?

58:49.318 --> 59:00.561
Yeah, so last week, President Trump signed an absolutely historic executive order that puts a full pause on all gain-of-function work throughout the government.

59:01.501 --> 59:07.623
And we implemented that pause at the NIH, and I'm sure the rest of the government has done the same.

59:08.723 --> 59:11.104
Over the next 90 days, we're going to develop a framework.

59:11.904 --> 59:13.405
And here's how the framework's going to work, right?

59:13.425 --> 59:15.105
So you have to be a little careful here.

59:15.145 --> 59:17.206
So gain-of-function can mean many things.

59:17.266 --> 59:18.626
So for instance,

59:19.441 --> 59:22.862
Insulin is produced via a gain-of-function exercise.

59:23.222 --> 59:31.985
There's no risk of a pandemic being caused by it, but you take a bacteria, E. coli, you change so they can produce insulin, and that's how you produce human insulin.

59:32.325 --> 59:34.026
There's a completely safe thing to do.

59:34.995 --> 59:50.100
On the other hand, you take a virus, like a bat virus, a virus that has these sort of coronavirus-like properties, add a purine cleavage site, and manipulate it so they can infect human cells more easily.

59:50.740 --> 59:52.961
Well, now you have the potential to cause a pandemic.

59:53.981 --> 01:00:01.023
If you're gonna do an experiment like that, you, the scientist alone, or scientists alone, should not get to decide whether that risk is worth taking.

01:00:01.444 --> 01:00:02.664
The public should have a say.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:14.984
The public should be able to say, no matter what knowledge you think you're going to gain from that, it's not worth the risk of causing a worldwide pandemic that's going to kill 20 million people and cost $25 trillion or something.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:18.005
And that's exactly what the framework's going to do.

01:00:18.065 --> 01:00:27.047
It's going to say, if I, the scientist, wants to run this project, the public will have a veto over that, say, no, you're not allowed to do it because it's not worth it.

01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:28.868
Most science won't be affected by this.

01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:30.749
Most science has no chance of causing a pandemic.

01:00:31.009 --> 01:00:32.069
But any science that does,

01:00:32.669 --> 01:00:35.870
is going to be subject to this very, very strict regulatory framework.

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:41.871
We're on with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who is... I think you should be very upset as an American.

01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:46.412
You should be very, a little bit concerned that the NIH has been unmoored.

01:00:48.052 --> 01:00:58.494
And wonder who else has been appointed, who else is being hired, who else is being fired, and how this huge budget... What's happening?

01:00:59.514 --> 01:01:00.855
How is it being rearranged?

01:01:00.915 --> 01:01:02.036
What is occurring here?

01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:03.877
Because you should be very concerned.

01:01:05.859 --> 01:01:18.207
And the social media themes that are going around right now with AI babies and fake AI videos are not anything to do with the possible sabotage of our government from inside.

01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:24.252
I'm very, very concerned because this sounds like incredible incompetence.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:25.753
This guy's way over his head.

01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:38.097
And now he's circulating exclusively on what I can only consider to be the corners of the internet where most US citizens will never hear him.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.378
And that's by design.

01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:55.163
Those people are being shown a completely different image of America and American politics, a completely different set of ideas to argue about, and a completely separate

01:01:56.983 --> 01:02:06.526
list of questions to ask while we are being herded into this trap where we're supposed to be really focused on the COVID shots and forget about 2020.

01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:14.228
The premiere of this, uh, you know, silence the silence or whatever.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:33.593
completely focuses on the COVID shot and forgets about the fact that there were Americans that were murdered as part of an operation to create an illusion of an ongoing pandemic around the world and point at America as a country that failed to take heed.

01:02:35.114 --> 01:02:38.797
And none of these pseudo-patriots, these false patriots,

01:02:39.657 --> 01:02:48.446
seem to be aware that actually that's when the crucial parts of the narrative were laid down, including the PCR testing, the full sequencing of the virus.

01:02:50.648 --> 01:02:54.051
The existence of the virus was established in 2020.

01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:57.546
accepted in 2020.

01:02:58.707 --> 01:03:08.930
More importantly, the establishment of the PCR as the gold standard for tracking and finding and measuring its presence was established in 2020.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.331
And so never mind whether there are viruses or not.

01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:16.073
If there are no viruses, then PCR is bullshit and they're still using it.

01:03:16.513 --> 01:03:19.874
If there are no viruses, then vaccines are bullshit.

01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:25.030
And that's the argument that they trapped you in, you see?

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:30.074
If there are no viruses, if there are no viruses, and that's not the way that you should have been thinking about it.

01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:38.361
You should have been thinking about the idea that intramuscular injection is good for what reason?

01:03:39.722 --> 01:03:44.946
You should have been thinking about a healthy child needs augmentation for what reason?

01:03:47.461 --> 01:03:50.281
And we should have been encouraged to think very deeply about it.

01:03:50.321 --> 01:03:54.102
And there should be a number of people on earth that have thought very deeply about it.

01:03:54.142 --> 01:04:00.783
But it turns out that apparently there's only a couple people who have ever thought deeply about it and they've failed to really think deeply enough.

01:04:02.263 --> 01:04:17.146
Like Suzanne Humphries and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker, who just, after all these years, have just been unable to come to the, you know what, maybe just injecting shit with metal tubes is dumb.

01:04:18.575 --> 01:04:20.256
It might not even matter where you put it.

01:04:20.296 --> 01:04:28.598
It just is kind of dumb because it's, you know, a few steps away from any natural interaction with whatever our biology is.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.781
You know, it's like a chainsaw for a tree.

01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:46.404
I mean, I guess you can, I guess, you know, it probably won't always kill the tree, but it's hard to argue that you needed to have a chainsaw for it to have a healthy tree.

01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:55.646
It's a pretty hard argument to make and yet we make the argument about intramuscular injection and we make it especially absurdly in America.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:06.191
And that difference in absurdity is never pointed out by anybody that purports to be fighting for this as part of Maha because it's actually a joke on America.

01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:11.803
is a hero in my book, now the director of the National Institutes of Health.

01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:16.405
Is an apology good enough for the National Institute of Health?

01:05:16.485 --> 01:05:19.547
I mean, should anybody go to jail for what has happened?

01:05:19.747 --> 01:05:27.811
And what is that like to walk into that building when you were, you know, enemy number one to many in that building, you know, during the pandemic?

01:05:29.752 --> 01:05:31.373
You know, it's been interesting.

01:05:31.453 --> 01:05:34.194
It's certainly a big turn of fate where I was sort of the

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:52.781
uh i mean subject of devastating takedowns and called all kinds of names by folks who were in the well you got to repeat exactly what the newspapers and the social media memes were right a devastating takedown that was the email that circulated and released by francis collins but that was by accident

01:05:53.382 --> 01:06:12.889
just like the main victim in the movie that they just premiered last night, just happened to have multiple interactions with Peter Marks from the FDA on camera, on Zoom, so that we could use it in our feature length film about how this woman was injured by the vaccine, although you can't really see it when she's on camera anymore.

01:06:13.189 --> 01:06:21.832
And we can occasionally drop in some of these people, you know, like the guy that lost his hockey playing son, but we'll give him like five minutes and we'll just keep the focus on this lady.

01:06:22.782 --> 01:06:26.164
and her many interactions with Peter Marks, because Peter Marks is a bad guy.

01:06:27.285 --> 01:06:47.237
You know, I had a professor from the University of Pittsburgh meet me for coffee in 2022 to tell me a story about how Peter Marks was the bad guy, and that he, this guy from the University of Pittsburgh, had published a paper where he showed that there was a reversed sequence from Moderna that was patented in 2000-whatever and now was found in the coronavirus sequence.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.621
And he told Peter Marks, and so Peter Marks knows that there's evidence it's a lab leak.

01:06:53.241 --> 01:06:54.462
That guy met me for coffee.

01:06:54.522 --> 01:06:56.962
I can't tell you his name because I'm afraid he'll sue me.

01:06:57.303 --> 01:06:59.683
But you can look up that paper, and he's the last author.

01:07:00.143 --> 01:07:03.184
He's still a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:15.548
And he actually met with me in 2022 to try and make sure I understood that he was taking a big risk by publishing that paper about there being a high probability that this sequence could never have come together by accident.

01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:20.031
I hate it.

01:07:20.191 --> 01:07:36.142
I hate the fact that I have so many personal stories that point to these people being one orchestrated, malevolent group of actors performing in elaborate theater so that America and the world believes that something that happened that didn't.

01:07:36.242 --> 01:07:42.547
It's just the management of the population pyramid and the using of the population pyramid to their advantage.

01:07:44.338 --> 01:07:57.030
sculpting it with murder and lies, and then putting a bunch of people on the internet, clueless or not, on a script that will never free anyone from this huge, ridiculous mythology.

01:07:58.743 --> 01:08:00.043
in this building where I now lead.

01:08:00.704 --> 01:08:11.287
But at the same time, I found many, many excellent scientists, many people devoted to advancing human knowledge for the benefit of all people.

01:08:11.307 --> 01:08:13.768
I mean, most scientists are like that.

01:08:13.788 --> 01:08:15.848
They're not trying to create havoc.

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:19.810
And so I've been trying to find allies, and I found a lot of allies in the building.

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.871
You asked what should happen regarding pathologies.

01:08:24.318 --> 01:08:25.940
I mean, to me, apologies.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:35.112
I mean, I think the key thing, I personally, I'm very, very happy to apologize on behalf of American public health to the American people for the failures during COVID.

01:08:35.472 --> 01:08:37.575
But the key thing going forward is a reform.

01:08:38.183 --> 01:08:50.153
How do we change the institution so that it's focused on the health needs of the American people rather than these utopian schemes to like end all pandemics without any heed whatsoever to the risk that they take?

01:08:51.134 --> 01:09:03.765
Science is a very, very powerful kind of idea and institution, but it needs to be focused on real human needs, real health, in particular for the NIH, real human health needs.

01:09:04.678 --> 01:09:11.642
And there have to be guardrails so that scientists understand that they operate in the context of public support.

01:09:11.762 --> 01:09:14.364
We function on taxpayer money.

01:09:14.644 --> 01:09:16.425
We have to answer the taxpayers.

01:09:17.145 --> 01:09:26.791
And so that's been the challenge is trying to keep the light of science alive while still reminding scientists that we are not acting just as

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:45.079
So I have made the point many times on my stream that the way they got away with it is that they use placebos to make it safe, besides the non-specific PCR tests on a background and they just misconstrued a spread.

01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:46.220
They made the

01:09:46.960 --> 01:10:01.246
these transfections safe because most of them were placebo and of course there's an elaborate hoax out there about there's all these different dosing and we heard Robert Malone in the beginning here saying that that the Conpertys were doing all kinds of different dosing and it's just all absurd.

01:10:01.646 --> 01:10:11.270
What they were doing is most of it was placebo because that made it cheap, it made it safe, it made it reliable, it made it not need to be stored, and it made it very easy to manufacture.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.071
I mean that's a pretty good scam.

01:10:14.966 --> 01:10:16.887
for companies that don't make that much money.

01:10:16.927 --> 01:10:19.187
This was a great way to make some money.

01:10:19.227 --> 01:10:20.048
Yes, that's true.

01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:26.750
But the real companies that were making money were a lot more valuable than these companies.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:30.611
Now, placebos made it safe, it made it cheap, it made the profit higher, sure.

01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:34.232
But I want you to understand also what placebos do.

01:10:35.413 --> 01:10:37.653
Because placebos also made it possible.

01:10:38.373 --> 01:10:39.834
Because placebos actually work.

01:10:46.468 --> 01:10:48.769
This is a remarkable little pill.

01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:52.570
It comes in all shapes and sizes.

01:10:54.650 --> 01:11:02.372
It can relieve pain, treat depression, and has even helped ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

01:11:04.853 --> 01:11:07.193
And yet, it isn't a wonder drug.

01:11:08.153 --> 01:11:10.354
In fact, there isn't anything in it.

01:11:13.638 --> 01:11:16.140
As a scientist, it's unbelievable.

01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:19.342
These pills are placebos.

01:11:20.183 --> 01:11:20.963
Dummy pills.

01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:22.605
Sugar pills.

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:25.106
I'm thinking, he wants me to take sugar pills?

01:11:26.487 --> 01:11:27.668
This isn't going to work.

01:11:28.389 --> 01:11:32.852
But the latest research is starting to show why placebos do work.

01:11:34.053 --> 01:11:35.774
And how you could make the most of them.

01:11:55.396 --> 01:12:02.360
At the home of British cycling, at the Manchester Velodrome, some of the country's top cyclists have gathered together.

01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:04.741
They're elite.

01:12:06.102 --> 01:12:08.804
Many are national champions, past or present.

01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:13.649
They've been brought together by Dr. Chris Beattie.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:21.834
He wants to see if he can give them some pills to help them do something that would normally take months of training.

01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:27.977
He wants to see if he can make them cycle faster than ever before.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:31.879
We're going to get all the riders onto the track to do a sprint time trial.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.462
And we're going to get an idea from that how fast they are, their baseline speed.

01:12:37.182 --> 01:12:39.984
Then four hours later, we're going to give them a couple of these.

01:12:41.704 --> 01:12:44.306
and we're expecting these to have an effect on their performance.

01:12:47.809 --> 01:12:55.594
The cyclists have been invited to take part in an experiment looking at the effect of legal performance-enhancing supplements.

01:12:55.614 --> 01:12:57.616
Yes, you must believe!

01:12:58.156 --> 01:12:59.758
You must believe!

01:12:59.778 --> 01:13:02.840
We will be testing a new ergogenic aid.

01:13:04.136 --> 01:13:09.340
Half of you will be getting what we'd call a standard ergogenic aid, which is caffeine.

01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:15.045
The other half will be getting caffeine with some nitrate and some bicarbonate in those capsules.

01:13:15.165 --> 01:13:18.027
And we're expecting that to do slightly better.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:27.675
So to evaluate this, we need two time trials from you, absolutely 100%, absolutely everything you've got in both time trials.

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:41.961
The cyclists baseline performance is measured to get a sense of their natural competitive time.

01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:55.170
And then it's time for the pills.

01:13:56.551 --> 01:13:58.032
Okay, we've got the baseline performance.

01:13:58.372 --> 01:14:01.194
We now are going to give them some of these and see what effect these have.

01:14:02.344 --> 01:14:08.049
One by one, the cyclists receive their performance enhancing capsules from members of Chris's team.

01:14:08.789 --> 01:14:11.872
Hi Lisa, you've been randomised today to receive the caffeine.

01:14:13.853 --> 01:14:16.456
Today you've been randomised to take the mixed supplements.

01:14:16.496 --> 01:14:20.699
Hannah, today you've been randomised to receive the pure caffeine.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.103
Today you've been randomised to receive the new supplements.

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.392
But nothing about today is quite as it seems.

01:14:30.513 --> 01:14:33.255
Both sets of pills are exactly the same.

01:14:34.956 --> 01:14:39.639
The cyclists are actually taking part in a very different experiment.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.561
These are the capsules we're going to be using today.

01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:45.583
We've got a couple of red ones and a couple of red and white ones.

01:14:45.664 --> 01:14:48.766
They're fairly large and they look like they mean business.

01:14:50.247 --> 01:14:52.048
They are, however, filled with cornflour.

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:56.151
Cornflour.

01:14:58.129 --> 01:14:59.710
not sugar, so that's better.

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:08.254
Chris wants to see if the cornflour can improve the cyclist's times, even though they already do all they can to be as fast as possible.

01:15:09.435 --> 01:15:13.537
But having raced just a couple of hours ago, the riders are tired.

01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:19.140
The thought of doing two in one day, it'd never happen.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:24.803
You'd normally race one and then a day or so, you'd start again, but two in one day is going to be interesting.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:31.458
It's fair to expect that their second race of the day would be slower.

01:15:32.902 --> 01:15:35.348
It's time to see what the pills can do.

01:15:40.746 --> 01:15:44.668
Okay, so first of all, I would point out that that's not actually good.

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:51.690
If they never race twice a day, then they don't know what happens if they race and then wait four hours and then race again.

01:15:51.730 --> 01:16:04.474
And I can speak from experience that if I work out in the morning, jumping rope, doing calf raises and free squats, and then go to the gym like five hours later, I can feel the difference that if I don't do it.

01:16:04.514 --> 01:16:06.075
And sometimes the difference is better.

01:16:07.236 --> 01:16:14.125
It's warming up becomes easier and I'm bouncier for longer than if I didn't work out in the morning.

01:16:14.185 --> 01:16:18.851
And so I'm not sure it's perfect control, but okay, whatever, let's see.

01:16:19.212 --> 01:16:20.393
I'm not trying to rip on it.

01:16:20.413 --> 01:16:21.415
The whole show is great.

01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:22.757
This is not the only example.

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:53.082
I think if the transfection was just a live dose of the spike protein RNA, perfect and ready to go as they claim it is on the brochure, that the vast majority of people that got that would probably die in the next five years.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:54.022
That's what I think.

01:16:55.023 --> 01:16:58.746
I don't think that that is a very bad prediction.

01:16:58.786 --> 01:17:02.849
The only reason why it's not coming true is because the vast majority were placebo.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:11.683
I actually said that to my friend, Nathan, on my porch in October of 2020.

01:17:11.924 --> 01:17:15.746
I can't even remember anymore.

01:17:15.766 --> 01:17:16.106
I think it's 2024.

01:17:16.146 --> 01:17:17.207
I guess it would know 2023.

01:17:17.247 --> 01:17:17.207
2022, 2023.

01:17:24.324 --> 01:17:29.408
He was here for another reason and he was pretty flabbergasted.

01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:30.489
The book hadn't come out yet.

01:17:30.529 --> 01:17:32.111
If the book had come out, I would have given him one.

01:17:32.171 --> 01:17:33.172
So the book hadn't come out yet.

01:17:33.192 --> 01:17:45.444
It was October 2023 and he was here for another reason and he came to the house and we hung out on the porch and I explained what I was doing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:45.484 --> 01:17:48.827
and how I was making a living in the basement and he says, you really think that you can

01:17:49.468 --> 01:17:50.568
that you can keep going.

01:17:50.628 --> 01:17:53.709
And I'm like, but, but this is the, yeah, absolutely.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:18:00.972
And then later in the same conversation, he said, so you still think that there's a possibility that I could die from the COVID shot?

01:18:01.032 --> 01:18:02.312
I said, absolutely.

01:18:02.392 --> 01:18:02.633
I do.

01:18:03.733 --> 01:18:08.775
And he actually died a month later, an aneurysm.

01:18:11.035 --> 01:18:15.737
He was able to say to his wife that he's going to be fine when they got in, when he got in the ambulance.

01:18:15.777 --> 01:18:18.398
And when they got to the hospital, he was gone, brain dead.

01:18:22.882 --> 01:18:23.823
So it's not funny.

01:18:23.963 --> 01:18:24.923
This is not a joke.

01:18:25.664 --> 01:18:31.246
And what's happening here, what they pulled off, the only reason why they could pull it off is because placebo works.

01:18:31.526 --> 01:18:32.207
It's real.

01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:45.021
Do you feel that the second ride felt easier?

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:48.624
The first one, it got progressively harder during the ride.

01:18:48.644 --> 01:18:54.930
The second ride, after about a lap and a half out of the four laps, it kind of got to a point where it was hurting, but then it never got any worse.

01:18:56.411 --> 01:18:58.713
The second ride felt better, yes.

01:19:00.455 --> 01:19:03.798
I went, like, half a second quicker, which is quite a lot over that distance.

01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:04.138
Yeah.

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:07.561
I felt as if I was a little bit quicker the second time around.

01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:09.963
I felt really tired before I took it.

01:19:10.316 --> 01:19:15.840
I think it may have started to kick in whilst I was warming up and I got a bit of a burst of energy and felt ready to go again.

01:19:18.102 --> 01:19:28.631
In spite of the fact that the riders were tired from their earlier race, analysis of today's times shows that more than half of them were quicker with the cornflower.

01:19:35.393 --> 01:19:40.797
The placebo has even helped one cyclist to ride faster than ever before.

01:19:44.139 --> 01:19:48.582
I think it's very conspicuous that that rider said that they never do it twice.

01:19:48.782 --> 01:19:49.542
It never happens.

01:19:49.562 --> 01:19:50.923
They never do it twice in a day.

01:19:52.024 --> 01:19:53.685
I really think you can't discount that.

01:19:53.725 --> 01:19:56.747
That's a huge flaw in this first illustration.

01:19:56.767 --> 01:19:58.008
I'm kind of disappointed in that.

01:19:59.684 --> 01:20:00.784
It was really, really good.

01:20:00.804 --> 01:20:02.825
Really surprised to go quicker in the second run.

01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:03.366
Really pleased.

01:20:03.406 --> 01:20:05.506
And a personal best as well by two tenths of a second.

01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:08.008
And to beat a couple of lads that are in today that normally beat me.

01:20:08.448 --> 01:20:15.271
Now what he should come to the conclusion of is that since it's a placebo, it couldn't have been the mental part of it.

01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:21.133
It might have been the physical change of having exercise done the same thing four hours before, but he won't.

01:20:21.193 --> 01:20:23.914
And that's pretty remarkable, actually, if you see it.

01:20:24.234 --> 01:20:24.875
Big surprise, yeah.

01:20:24.915 --> 01:20:25.275
Really happy.

01:20:27.717 --> 01:20:29.359
So, I mean, you did a PB.

01:20:29.619 --> 01:20:33.182
You felt the effects of the substance.

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:35.745
The capture we gave you was a placebo.

01:20:38.027 --> 01:20:38.588
All right, OK.

01:20:39.188 --> 01:20:39.669
Really?

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.551
Really?

01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:42.491
Wow.

01:20:46.696 --> 01:20:50.900
Today's trial is just a demonstration of what placebos can do.

01:20:52.486 --> 01:20:58.389
but it's typical of what Dr. Beattie has found in over a decade of experiments with hundreds of athletes.

01:20:59.609 --> 01:21:05.412
It's really, I'm sure that he's done the experiment more often, but this particular experimental design is bad.

01:21:05.452 --> 01:21:13.256
They should have just done the run the next day, or they should have shown us a video without that guy saying that we never do two in one day because that blew it.

01:21:13.516 --> 01:21:18.378
Every study we've done, we've found a mean placebo effect.

01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:26.890
In sports performance generally, we can see improvements quite frequently of 2-3%.

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:35.918
Well, 3% in many sports is probably the difference between first place in the Olympics and not being in the top 10.

01:21:36.379 --> 01:21:38.681
So we're talking quite a substantial difference.

01:21:38.781 --> 01:21:42.985
It's a little bit like your car's going a little bit faster, but you're not using any more petrol.

01:21:44.006 --> 01:21:47.289
Why that's happening, however, is still open to question.

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:56.516
It seems the pills that the cyclist took have the potential to make a real difference.

01:21:57.016 --> 01:22:00.020
And it's clearly nothing to do with the corn flour in them.

01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:07.128
So how can a pill with nothing in it help someone to cycle faster than ever before?

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:08.750
While they're hammering it home.

01:22:20.856 --> 01:22:25.718
Since the advent of modern medicine, placebos have been treated with skepticism.

01:22:26.778 --> 01:22:29.139
It has been assumed that they can do nothing.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:36.682
They've been used only as dummy pills that new drugs have to beat to be considered effective.

01:22:39.503 --> 01:22:45.926
But in recent years, a number of studies have shown that there may be more to a placebo than we thought.

01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:56.329
A few years ago, Dr. David Kalmes decided to do a rather controversial experiment.

01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:05.792
For 15 years, he's been fixing broken backs by injecting them with a special kind of surgical cement.

01:23:08.313 --> 01:23:12.714
That looks something you need some skill for.

01:23:13.895 --> 01:23:19.657
But then, Dr. Kalmes noticed something that made him question how effective the procedure was.

01:23:23.697 --> 01:23:34.380
I was aware of some rare cases where, believe it or not, the wrong vertebral body was treated for whatever reason, and patients seemed to get some relief from that.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:44.063
So there was some reason to suspect that there were numerous factors at play in the apparent effectiveness of the cement.

01:23:45.424 --> 01:23:47.145
He decided to do something unusual.

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.030
All right.

01:24:12.691 --> 01:24:16.053
He decided to put this established procedure to the test.

01:24:19.356 --> 01:24:27.522
He designed a trial in which some patients would be given the real procedure, and some would be given a placebo.

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:32.886
But in this case, the placebo couldn't be a dummy pill.

01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:35.889
It would have to be a fake operation.

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:44.745
There was skepticism from many people about whether this was worth doing.

01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:48.629
I recall being at a meeting that I remember being screamed at.

01:24:49.369 --> 01:24:57.514
at that and then later on being called a heretic for raising the specter of the placebo effect in interventional procedures.

01:24:58.354 --> 01:24:58.954
Nevertheless.

01:24:59.455 --> 01:25:04.738
Okay, already students in the chat, is there a placebo effect possible here?

01:25:04.798 --> 01:25:07.379
Have they designed this experiment right or not?

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:12.782
If they're gonna do a fake operation, that means they're gonna use deep anesthesia.

01:25:13.783 --> 01:25:17.385
And if they use deep anesthesia, I'm not sure what that does for back pain.

01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:29.914
I've had back pain for the last like three weeks because I jumped wrong about three weeks ago and then it moved from vertebrae to vertebrae all the way down until the last couple days it was actually making my hips hurt and now it's gone.

01:25:31.095 --> 01:25:39.965
But I don't know how fast that would happen if I was put under muscle relaxants and deeply anesthetized for a couple hours and then woken up.

01:25:41.445 --> 01:25:58.393
And so they're completely discounting the possibility that narcosis and anesthesia in a situation where you have muscle and nerve pain could result in, you know, a changed situation.

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:01.094
It's really remarkable and they're presenting it as placebo.

01:26:01.174 --> 01:26:02.514
He went ahead with the trial.

01:26:03.635 --> 01:26:06.256
All he needed was to recruit some patients.

01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:22.847
A few years ago, Bonnie Anderson had an accident that led her to join the trial.

01:26:26.345 --> 01:26:32.689
Well, when I slipped on the tile floor in the kitchen here, my feet went off underneath me.

01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:33.930
I went flat on my back.

01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:35.170
I could not move.

01:26:35.711 --> 01:26:38.413
And I thought, oh dear, I told Donna, I'm afraid I broke my back.

01:26:38.553 --> 01:26:48.519
One question you could ask yourself, DOTUS in the chat, you could ask yourself, have they shown you any evidence that the cancer is in only people who took the shots?

01:26:49.895 --> 01:26:57.377
because if not, then that would be one very good argument against the shots are not responsible for an increase in cancer.

01:26:57.737 --> 01:27:16.363
There could be just the fact that we have a lot of aging out old people in the population that if they didn't die from COVID or from the protocols by going to the hospital, then maybe what they have done is just become unhealthy like they would expect to be and contribute to rising numbers of cancer in America.

01:27:16.383 --> 01:27:17.583
The young examples,

01:27:18.243 --> 01:27:21.327
Examples of young people with cancer, that's a completely different story.

01:27:21.347 --> 01:27:38.267
And if they've been transfected, it's very possible that the hot doses were sent to college groups because of course they knew, of course they knew that a hot dose of a transfection in a frail old person would result or could result in an immediate death.

01:27:39.397 --> 01:27:42.862
They killed old people with oxygen and other things.

01:27:43.022 --> 01:27:46.046
They didn't kill old people with live transfections.

01:27:46.086 --> 01:27:49.251
And what would they really learn from transfecting adults anyway?

01:27:51.454 --> 01:27:53.476
If they did it, they did it just to get rid of them.

01:27:53.537 --> 01:27:55.059
They're collecting data.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:28:04.586
Think about what happens if they transfect an entire university population with all of their medical records surrendered as part of their admissions process.

01:28:04.906 --> 01:28:07.946
And then a certain percentage of them get sick after the pandemic.

01:28:07.986 --> 01:28:15.008
Well, then they have a perfect fricking experiment on a young group of experimental animals.

01:28:15.168 --> 01:28:18.608
And they have them for four years and they have them beyond that.

01:28:18.748 --> 01:28:21.589
If they're not aware that they are in this list.

01:28:24.161 --> 01:28:38.726
And so if they, cancer goes up in those people, they're getting prime data, the best kind of data, even on these, all these different, very small examples, because it's not going to be one thing, but they're getting data on everything.

01:28:39.906 --> 01:28:52.951
The prevalence of myocarditis, the prevalence of long COVID, the prevalence of, of cancers, the prevalence of any medical calamity after the injection of live RNA.

01:28:55.253 --> 01:29:04.259
and they don't have to do it to anybody else, nobody on the street, nobody at CVS, because you wouldn't want somebody at CVS to take a shot from some random person and then just pass out.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:23.791
You got to do that stuff, you know, in a controlled setting, like at a university where everybody's on board, where the health department could be linked to a huge conglomerate of corporate health providers, and ultimately linked to a database like Epic.

01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:39.812
so that somebody like Nicole Shanahan could get a hold of all that data and use AI to interface it back with the genetic data collected from the monthly or weekly PCR required testing that was also done on the same campuses.

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:46.474
Isn't that a easier explanation for why they would only put the hot doses where they had access to all the data?

01:29:46.774 --> 01:29:49.194
There are probably a lot of hot doses in Israel too.

01:29:49.594 --> 01:29:52.515
And that would be great because they could track them with that beautiful,

01:29:53.175 --> 01:29:55.816
that beautiful health care system database.

01:29:55.876 --> 01:29:58.637
Maybe they did the same thing in the NHS with certain places.

01:29:58.797 --> 01:29:59.297
I don't know.

01:29:59.697 --> 01:30:05.839
But I assure you, anywhere where they weren't going to bother, anywhere where it might get out, everything controlled very well.

01:30:06.259 --> 01:30:09.820
Otherwise, you can't explain how it's possible that they bottled so much of it.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.561
It broke my back.

01:30:14.861 --> 01:30:17.502
The pain was just very, very severe.

01:30:19.096 --> 01:30:20.357
I couldn't stand up straight.

01:30:20.397 --> 01:30:23.080
I'd have to, you know, just kind of hold on to something.

01:30:26.063 --> 01:30:28.565
She was in pain all the time.

01:30:29.226 --> 01:30:30.287
She could do very little.

01:30:30.307 --> 01:30:34.511
Well, I'd help him with the dishes, but he did all the vacuuming.

01:30:34.551 --> 01:30:36.092
He really did more of the work for me.

01:30:36.113 --> 01:30:37.674
That part hasn't really changed that much.

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:48.832
When Bonnie saw the doctor, a vertebral fracture was confirmed.

01:30:51.233 --> 01:30:52.674
She was enrolled on the trial.

01:30:55.435 --> 01:31:00.217
On a cold October morning, Bonnie arrived at the hospital ready for her operation.

01:31:02.619 --> 01:31:03.519
But she has a fracture!

01:31:03.539 --> 01:31:09.282
She could know whether she was having a vertebroplasty or the pretend procedure, the placebo.

01:31:10.714 --> 01:31:17.056
Dr. Kalm has developed an elaborate ruse to ensure that patients wouldn't work out which group they were in.

01:31:19.437 --> 01:31:24.939
If they induce her, that's pretty incredible because not everybody takes to anesthesia very well.

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.940
That's a pretty, wow, that's incredible.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.902
Given medication by vein, was sterilely prepped and local anesthesia was given.

01:31:33.962 --> 01:31:44.668
And only after the anesthesia was given onto the bone did we press the button to see whether the patient was randomized to the full vertebroplasty or to the placebo.

01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:57.774
In both cases, no matter how they were randomized, we then opened the cement, which has a very strong odor like nail polish remover, to really simulate it for everybody in the room.

01:31:58.075 --> 01:32:02.337
And if they were randomized to vertebroplasty, we then inject cement down into the bone.

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:09.136
If they were randomized to placebo, we opened the cement.

01:32:09.697 --> 01:32:11.197
We had a script that we followed.

01:32:13.978 --> 01:32:17.160
We pressed on the back and said, OK, ma'am, the cement is going in now.

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.400
Everything's going fine.

01:32:18.861 --> 01:32:19.801
Things are going well.

01:32:20.141 --> 01:32:21.102
A few more minutes here.

01:32:21.122 --> 01:32:21.962
OK, we're all done.

01:32:22.462 --> 01:32:26.604
So we really simulated the procedure for the patient.

01:32:29.105 --> 01:32:31.526
OK, I mean, it's local anesthesia only.

01:32:31.626 --> 01:32:32.647
I guess I can buy it.

01:32:34.207 --> 01:32:36.228
The surgery did work very, very well for me.

01:32:37.349 --> 01:32:38.369
It did so much for me.

01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:40.170
I was really active.

01:32:43.752 --> 01:32:50.656
The procedure transformed her life.

01:32:53.378 --> 01:33:00.642
Within a week of the injection, I was able to play golf and I took it a little bit easy, but I was able to play golf almost every day.

01:33:02.083 --> 01:33:02.964
That's pretty remarkable.

01:33:03.004 --> 01:33:05.025
But did the bone heal?

01:33:05.085 --> 01:33:07.487
Because like he said, she had a vertebra fracture.

01:33:07.507 --> 01:33:11.149
Now she's playing golf with a vertebra fracture because the placebo worked?

01:33:11.749 --> 01:33:13.931
Something about this story is not right yet.

01:33:14.191 --> 01:33:14.711
It's weird.

01:33:14.751 --> 01:33:16.012
Return to some of my duties.

01:33:17.453 --> 01:33:19.134
As far as, yeah.

01:33:19.754 --> 01:33:22.275
Well, I don't vacuum, but I fire his dishes and stuff.

01:33:22.815 --> 01:33:28.078
He won't say that, but it's true.

01:33:28.098 --> 01:33:28.878
Interesting.

01:33:28.938 --> 01:33:33.700
That's... Strike two, really, I think.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.521
Something doesn't ring right about that, but whatever.

01:33:49.304 --> 01:33:56.710
I thought they were both so successful that I just could go ahead and do what I wanted to do without any problem.

01:33:57.971 --> 01:33:58.211
Wow.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:02.194
And it wasn't just Bonnie that responded so well to the placebo.

01:34:03.635 --> 01:34:09.440
When the results of the other 130 patients on the trial came in, they surprised everyone.

01:34:13.345 --> 01:34:23.510
There was no statistically significant difference in degree of pain relief between the patients who underwent verteoplasty and placebo.

01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:34.515
And more importantly, there was no statistically significant difference in improvement in function between the patients who underwent verteoplasty and placebo.

01:34:38.635 --> 01:34:50.519
This study and another in Australia both suggest that a pretend procedure can be as effective as vertebroplasty, which has been carried out on over a million people.

01:34:51.299 --> 01:34:51.540
Wow.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:58.922
Both the real thing and the placebo made patients better than if they'd received no treatment.

01:35:00.163 --> 01:35:03.924
So how could a pretend procedure be so effective?

01:35:04.753 --> 01:35:12.358
Also realize that a pretend diagnostic could be as effective in the sense of, oh my gosh, I tested positive for it.

01:35:13.559 --> 01:35:14.680
I feel strange.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.662
Oh my gosh, I tested positive for it.

01:35:17.762 --> 01:35:19.423
I can't taste anything anymore.

01:35:19.923 --> 01:35:21.004
Is this gum real?

01:35:21.024 --> 01:35:33.272
Around the world, scientists are investigating how a placebo works.

01:35:34.798 --> 01:35:42.077
They're trying to find out what's happening inside your body and brain when you experience a placebo effect.

01:35:54.113 --> 01:35:54.854
Yes, of course.

01:35:54.874 --> 01:36:04.821
I do think that that's a good point to push out there, that the sameness should be significant, not the difference not significant.

01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:12.207
So that's, again, using p-values to prove yourself or call something an observation is already failing.

01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:21.990
it's a public holiday in the Italian Alps.

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:27.773
Tourists are heading up the mountain to spend a day skiing in the shadow of the Matterhorn.

01:36:32.056 --> 01:36:36.339
I still think you can't discount the possibility that a complete and local

01:36:37.415 --> 01:36:49.079
anesthesia that included muscle relaxers on the spot, applied needle-wise to your spine, might actually fix a great number of back problems.

01:36:49.179 --> 01:37:05.505
Because, again, my limited experience with a long back and how the pain can move over time, over a week or two, from wherever it happens in the middle of your back, all the way down to your sacrum, and it's happened a number of times in my life, that there's some kind of, you know,

01:37:06.986 --> 01:37:12.007
elaborate symphony of bone and muscle and sinew that gets out of alignment.

01:37:12.027 --> 01:37:16.789
And then that kink has to go all the way down that system until it comes out the end in my experience.

01:37:16.809 --> 01:37:28.572
And if you could just relax everything, all those nerves and autonomic muscles that are designed to protect your spinal cord have gotten triggered and are out of balance in their contractions.

01:37:29.312 --> 01:37:36.423
So if you just loosened everything up, forced everything to release, and then brought it all back online, the balance is there again.

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:44.555
And so even a fractured vertebrae doesn't hurt as much as it did, as when you kinked your back, fracturing that thing and then setting those

01:37:45.316 --> 01:37:47.817
those proprioceptors off of balance.

01:37:47.857 --> 01:37:51.439
The proprioception is what causes all those muscles to cramp.

01:37:51.499 --> 01:38:00.403
It's the receptors that sense, holy shit, you're about to set your spine off of balance and it could result in paralysis.

01:38:01.144 --> 01:38:03.705
So I'm going to cause extreme pain.

01:38:05.674 --> 01:38:07.955
It's not that dissimilar to why neck hurts a lot.

01:38:07.975 --> 01:38:18.361
It's not that dissimilar to why if your neck moves in two different directions at the same time too far, your consciousness, your whole body's going to go limp because you don't want to fight it anymore.

01:38:18.381 --> 01:38:21.062
You want to drop or you might break your neck.

01:38:21.442 --> 01:38:25.684
This is very, very, very interesting.

01:38:25.744 --> 01:38:26.325
I love this.

01:38:27.806 --> 01:38:32.248
But for Fabrizio Benedetti, it's just another day in the office.

01:38:35.925 --> 01:38:50.895
Instead of driving to the lab, or instead of taking a bus or a train, we take a cable car.

01:38:51.156 --> 01:38:53.057
The landscape is beautiful.

01:38:53.077 --> 01:38:54.378
It's a beautiful day.

01:38:58.821 --> 01:39:04.285
But Fabrizio's laboratory isn't at the top of the mountain just for the sake of a pleasant commute.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:13.654
He's using the low oxygen levels at high altitude to conduct an unusual experiment.

01:39:14.575 --> 01:39:23.765
He's trying to find out whether a placebo effect is imagined or whether somehow a placebo can cause real changes in our bodies.

01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:28.695
Okay, so here we are inside the station.

01:39:28.895 --> 01:39:30.418
There are a couple of labs.

01:39:30.878 --> 01:39:32.080
We have a living area.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.764
We have two bedrooms, the kitchen, the bathroom.

01:39:34.944 --> 01:39:37.267
Italian-Swiss border is more or less here.

01:39:37.287 --> 01:39:40.412
We work in Switzerland, we sleep in Italy.

01:39:42.193 --> 01:39:49.720
For the past few years, Fabrizio has been bringing volunteers like Marco to his mountaintop laboratory to be studied.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:59.568
He's conducting an experiment to see if anything happens to people when they expect extra oxygen but don't actually get it.

01:40:00.729 --> 01:40:05.974
So what we do is we give real oxygen or placebo oxygen.

01:40:06.054 --> 01:40:08.797
The tank of the oxygen is empty.

01:40:09.377 --> 01:40:13.561
And we compare the effect of real oxygen with placebo oxygen.

01:40:15.263 --> 01:40:15.763
Interesting.

01:40:16.704 --> 01:40:17.264
I like this one.

01:40:17.284 --> 01:40:23.790
Fabrizio gives Marco a canister of what he's told is oxygen and sets him off on a 30-minute hike.

01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:25.312
Wow, cool.

01:40:26.644 --> 01:40:28.045
I want to do this experiment.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:29.725
Now, this is right up my alley.

01:40:29.765 --> 01:40:30.765
I would love to do this.

01:40:31.446 --> 01:40:36.247
Even mild exercise, that's pretty tiring and difficult.

01:40:38.688 --> 01:40:40.649
That's the reason why we are here, of course.

01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:49.172
Fabrizio wants to know as much as possible about what's going on inside Marco's body and brain.

01:40:50.185 --> 01:40:53.846
his heart rate, brain activity, and even the neurotransmitters.

01:40:53.886 --> 01:40:56.447
I mean, I see it in the chat, brain symbiotic action.

01:40:56.487 --> 01:40:57.708
The opposite is also true.

01:40:57.768 --> 01:40:59.209
Bad thoughts make you feel ill.

01:40:59.329 --> 01:41:07.452
I would go so far as to say that the FLCCC telling people that if their pulse ox was below 96, they should go to the hospital.

01:41:07.912 --> 01:41:10.073
There were probably lots of Americans.

01:41:11.153 --> 01:41:15.095
And when their pulse ox went below 96, they started to panic.

01:41:15.933 --> 01:41:21.076
put on a mask, isolate and watch it go lower as they put on another mask.

01:41:21.656 --> 01:41:27.959
And then finally, you know, gave in and said, I better go to the hospital because I think I might be having, I might have it.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.280
Absolutely.

01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.821
It works in the negative direction.

01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:37.344
And Smith is in his system are all being monitored at this altitude.

01:41:37.924 --> 01:41:40.065
Extra oxygen would be a great help.

01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:47.913
If there is extra oxygen, of course, the muscles get more oxygen, so their performance improves.

01:41:56.818 --> 01:41:59.900
Sounds like Kitchen Nightmares from Gordon Ramsay.

01:42:04.583 --> 01:42:10.206
As they hike further, Marco is easily able to outpace Fabrizio's team of scientists.

01:42:14.141 --> 01:42:17.224
You can see I cannot see him anymore, actually.

01:42:19.226 --> 01:42:22.390
But of course Marco doesn't have any extra oxygen.

01:42:25.092 --> 01:42:29.837
So, has the fake oxygen just given him some kind of psychological boost?

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.243
Or has it changed something in his body?

01:42:38.203 --> 01:42:44.889
By analyzing the data he's gathered from Marco and the other subjects he's studied, Fabrizio has the answer.

01:42:48.232 --> 01:42:52.196
It's all to do with the level of a neurotransmitter called PGE2.

01:42:52.216 --> 01:42:54.858
Interesting.

01:42:54.878 --> 01:42:56.540
I know that.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.984
When we get up to high altitude, the low oxygen levels cause our blood oxygen levels to fall.

01:43:03.001 --> 01:43:06.104
This makes our PGE2 levels go up.

01:43:07.105 --> 01:43:12.470
And that leads us to feel some of the familiar symptoms of altitude sickness, like pain.

01:43:14.371 --> 01:43:17.134
But extra oxygen can ease the problems.

01:43:18.015 --> 01:43:22.919
When we give oxygen, there is a dramatic decrease in PGE2.

01:43:22.999 --> 01:43:28.224
This is the typical response after oxygen administration with real oxygen.

01:43:29.588 --> 01:43:37.818
The lower PGE2 level that comes from giving oxygen helps us to feel less pain and therefore work harder.

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:44.666
But if you give someone fake oxygen, you wouldn't expect the PGE2 levels to change.

01:43:46.749 --> 01:43:54.091
But in this case, we give fake oxygen, which means placebo oxygen, and there is no change in blood oxygen saturation.

01:43:54.171 --> 01:44:01.733
You see, we have 84% of blood oxygen saturation, but there is a decrease in PGE2 anyway.

01:44:04.414 --> 01:44:15.837
This means that this decrease is not due to oxygen in the body, but... I'm starting to feel something really weird here.

01:44:16.806 --> 01:44:24.150
But this is also bullshit unless he can show us that when he doesn't use oxygen, his PGE levels don't drop, they go up.

01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:26.050
They didn't tell us that.

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:28.972
They didn't show us that data because that would be the control, right?

01:44:29.032 --> 01:44:34.655
Go hike 10 times over the course of 10 days, the same track, you know, get in shape.

01:44:34.815 --> 01:44:41.638
And while you're doing it, let's see your oxygen deprivation occur and see the compensation that occurs.

01:44:41.738 --> 01:44:43.419
And now let's give you oxygen.

01:44:44.494 --> 01:44:46.215
and see what markers change.

01:44:46.715 --> 01:44:54.278
And then let's give you placebo oxygen and show that your brain can make some of those markers change, but not all of them or something.

01:44:54.318 --> 01:45:01.441
And then you'd have a story, but instead we have one marker and we're only shown that we expect it to go down.

01:45:01.501 --> 01:45:03.942
If we give people oxygen, this is what it looks like.

01:45:04.362 --> 01:45:14.206
And when we give him fake oxygen, it also goes down, but we haven't actually been shown that it doesn't go down or that it goes up when he doesn't have oxygen.

01:45:16.837 --> 01:45:19.599
That's a very crucial piece of data that's missing here.

01:45:19.779 --> 01:45:22.762
That is due to expectation to a placebo effect.

01:45:30.869 --> 01:45:44.080
The fake oxygen is causing real physiological changes in Fabrizio's subjects, decreasing their levels of PGE2, causing them to feel less pain and allowing them to work harder.

01:45:44.747 --> 01:45:50.169
It's not imagination, you know, it's not a pure psychological effect.

01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:52.030
It's a real neurobiological effect.

01:45:54.951 --> 01:45:55.472
Somehow.

01:45:57.152 --> 01:45:58.933
But he says that they worked harder.

01:45:58.993 --> 01:46:03.015
So did we also see a higher performance than without oxygen?

01:46:03.055 --> 01:46:09.618
You see, that's, they haven't shown us that data and that's not, that's not normal.

01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:11.879
This is the third time they've done that to us.

01:46:13.769 --> 01:46:30.462
Because one thing I can assure you placebo will work for is to make the total number of adverse events from intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a healthy human, a healthy person.

01:46:31.884 --> 01:46:39.510
You can make that number of events go way down if most of them are saline placebo injections.

01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:42.152
You still could have something from that, but I'm telling you,

01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:50.972
This is a very interesting thing if they've convinced us all these years that placebos can work as well as they can, when maybe they can't.

01:46:51.732 --> 01:46:55.973
Maybe there is something to do with mind over matter, but none of these are examples of that yet.

01:46:56.773 --> 01:47:03.895
I didn't see any proof of any mind over matter in either any of these three so far, except for maybe the lady

01:47:04.595 --> 01:47:17.855
with a fractured vertebra, but we don't have any time course of when the vertebra fractured versus when they did the surgery versus when the pain went away, you see, because she has pain while she has the broken vertebra.

01:47:19.218 --> 01:47:21.279
Maybe they let it heal to a certain extent.

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:27.082
Then they do the fake surgery with complete local anesthesia to release all those painful muscles.

01:47:27.162 --> 01:47:29.004
She wakes up and it's fine.

01:47:29.084 --> 01:47:33.706
And you know, the healing process of the vertebra has continued.

01:47:33.746 --> 01:47:39.149
And so now she can play golf and it wasn't placebo effect at all, which is really interesting.

01:47:39.509 --> 01:47:43.852
Fake oxygen is producing real chemical changes in people's bodies.

01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:50.073
It shows us just how real and measurable the placebo effect can be.

01:47:51.334 --> 01:47:55.196
What it doesn't tell us is how that's happening.

01:48:06.084 --> 01:48:09.626
Boulder, Colorado, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

01:48:12.537 --> 01:48:17.741
Thorweger is trying to figure out how a placebo can change the chemicals in our bodies.

01:48:19.702 --> 01:48:23.365
He's getting ready for another day, inflicting... Holy shit!

01:48:23.445 --> 01:48:33.332
You know, in a way, you could see this video as trying to make people believe that placebos really work, almost to the point where they're so working that they're not really useful as controls.

01:48:34.275 --> 01:48:35.735
Whoa.

01:48:36.715 --> 01:48:41.636
I didn't think I was going to come to that conclusion while watching this video, but I'm starting to come to that conclusion now.

01:48:41.696 --> 01:48:47.077
Because again, none of these examples are very convincing to me, even with the slightest amount of analysis.

01:48:52.638 --> 01:48:57.979
We do the thermal pain test a lot because it's not damaging and safe, but it is painful.

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:01.680
Jake, come on in.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.780
You can have a seat right here.

01:49:04.215 --> 01:49:11.242
Tor is hoping to fool Jake into believing that a standard moisturizer is a powerful pain relief cream.

01:49:12.984 --> 01:49:18.008
He begins by applying some moisturizer to Jake's arm and tells him what it is.

01:49:20.891 --> 01:49:24.455
It won't provide any pain relief and will serve as a control.

01:49:26.969 --> 01:49:33.654
On a different spot, he applies some lidocaine, a local anesthetic, which will dampen the pain that Jake feels.

01:49:34.454 --> 01:49:39.618
We already know that it blocks pain, but we're just gonna look and see whether it changes pain in your brain.

01:49:40.038 --> 01:49:40.338
Okay?

01:49:41.399 --> 01:49:44.021
And finally, there's more moisturizer.

01:49:44.781 --> 01:49:47.864
But Jake is told that it's also a local anesthetic.

01:49:52.407 --> 01:49:55.229
We'll do the analgesic on both of these spots.

01:49:59.708 --> 01:50:13.678
I mean... Hey, we'll just wait just a minute for that to... This is not that surprising when you've seen those videos where they have a mannequin hand and you put your hand in a mirror box and it looks like it's kind of your hand and then they hit the hand with the hammer.

01:50:15.699 --> 01:50:16.599
It's very similar.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:25.966
So we're going to give you a series of your level 8 temperatures, Jake, and just use the trackball there and just write what you feel moment by moment and track your pain continuously.

01:50:26.246 --> 01:50:27.547
Okay, so we're ready to go in.

01:50:31.897 --> 01:50:37.658
And so the whole study has data taken from this guy as he tracks his pain with a mouse ball.

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:47.920
This is the pain rating scale.

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.600
It's rating his pain continuously.

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:54.021
And the anchors here are no sensation to strongest imaginable sensation.

01:50:55.541 --> 01:50:58.522
Jake's first heat treatment is on the control area.

01:50:59.625 --> 01:51:03.368
All right, Jake, we've got it tuned and ready to go for the first task here, OK?

01:51:05.249 --> 01:51:08.471
With no anesthetic, it's not a pleasant experience.

01:51:08.951 --> 01:51:09.532
It's going up.

01:51:10.732 --> 01:51:14.215
And it's just about very strong.

01:51:14.255 --> 01:51:14.675
Very strong.

01:51:14.715 --> 01:51:15.135
That's good.

01:51:16.856 --> 01:51:17.557
That was the control.

01:51:17.697 --> 01:51:19.258
This is with the lidocaine.

01:51:19.298 --> 01:51:20.078
Just rate what you feel.

01:51:20.098 --> 01:51:21.379
We'll be scanning.

01:51:24.802 --> 01:51:28.224
On the lidocaine site, the pain is noticeably reduced.

01:51:30.658 --> 01:51:34.724
So with the control cream, they were between very strong and strongest imaginable.

01:51:34.744 --> 01:51:36.065
So they're pretty high.

01:51:36.566 --> 01:51:40.611
And with the actual lidocaine cream, they're between strong and very strong.

01:51:40.651 --> 01:51:42.013
So there's a substantial drop.

01:51:42.554 --> 01:51:43.896
Substantial drop.

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:46.739
And over several patients, it became significant.

01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:58.643
But how will Jake fare when the same heat is applied on the moisturizer that Thor has said is lidocaine?

01:51:59.123 --> 01:52:03.165
Last one, lidocaine number two.

01:52:03.705 --> 01:52:09.927
When he felt this temperature on the control area, he rated his pain above very strong.

01:52:11.168 --> 01:52:11.788
Let's see what happens.

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.161
Oh, this one is the lowest so far, actually.

01:52:26.201 --> 01:52:29.443
So that trial is lower than any of his lidocaine trials, actually.

01:52:31.345 --> 01:52:36.588
The basic conclusion is that here, the placebo response for him is about as large as the lidocaine response is.

01:52:38.869 --> 01:52:39.450
OK, Jake.

01:52:42.552 --> 01:52:46.394
OK, so students in the chat, what's retarded about this?

01:52:47.815 --> 01:52:50.436
I can tell you one example of what's retarded about this.

01:52:51.037 --> 01:52:52.298
You can take two pins.

01:52:53.342 --> 01:52:58.492
And you can put them on the, on a, take two pins.

01:52:59.898 --> 01:53:03.400
and put them on a ruler like this so that they're different distances apart.

01:53:04.541 --> 01:53:10.185
And you will find that on different parts of your body, you can tell that the pins are apart or not.

01:53:10.345 --> 01:53:21.252
So if you put them about an inch apart, for example, and put that on your leg or on your back, you can find places on your body where you can't tell the difference between two pins and one pin if they're an inch apart.

01:53:21.312 --> 01:53:23.233
But on your finger and your hand, of course you can.

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:44.037
And so that is also probably playing into this if they're not using his hands, if they're not using something as a control, or they haven't established a control, then they could have just serendipitously placed the test spot in between two, you know,

01:53:45.672 --> 01:53:49.555
in between two regions of the skin that are only served by two different nerves.

01:53:49.595 --> 01:53:51.916
And that's, we already know how that anatomy works.

01:53:52.537 --> 01:53:59.861
So the idea that they didn't adequately control for that by explaining to you why they chose where they chose and how they chose it.

01:54:00.762 --> 01:54:02.543
Again, this is kind of sketch to me.

01:54:02.843 --> 01:54:03.123
Wow.

01:54:04.764 --> 01:54:05.825
So how did that feel by the way?

01:54:05.845 --> 01:54:07.086
It feels less painful.

01:54:10.874 --> 01:54:14.715
So I told you before that we're applying the real lidocaine on all four sites, right?

01:54:15.395 --> 01:54:17.436
But actually, we didn't apply the lidocaine on all the sites.

01:54:19.877 --> 01:54:22.658
So what we actually did is we applied the control here.

01:54:22.758 --> 01:54:24.498
So these were where your pain readings were highest.

01:54:25.178 --> 01:54:26.899
These two were both the real lidocaine.

01:54:27.853 --> 01:54:29.314
And these two were the placebo.

01:54:29.614 --> 01:54:32.135
See, that's the perfect place for that.

01:54:32.235 --> 01:54:34.737
That's the perfect place for that experiment to happen.

01:54:34.917 --> 01:54:39.759
And I'm not saying that they planned it, but I'm just saying that that's where that sensitivity is different.

01:54:40.219 --> 01:54:46.462
I'm not saying, this is just, I just, you know, they could have done better trying to prove to us that they did something like that.

01:54:46.562 --> 01:54:46.743
Like.

01:54:47.223 --> 01:54:51.845
Do you feel like it worked or do you feel like... The lidocaine or the placebo?

01:54:51.865 --> 01:54:52.766
The placebo.

01:54:52.786 --> 01:54:53.366
Definitely, yeah.

01:54:55.973 --> 01:55:07.220
The significance of Tor's work is that by scanning the brains of people as they experience a placebo effect, he's revealed clues about how a placebo works.

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:10.021
Wow.

01:55:10.061 --> 01:55:15.925
This is also extremely sketchy if he's using MRI as evidence.

01:55:16.767 --> 01:55:18.268
Extremely sketchy.

01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:26.715
As a neuroscientist, I can tell you that there's so much bullshit out there that's created by these rainbow pictures, and it's not good.

01:55:27.135 --> 01:55:43.408
People at placebo treatment, what we see is the release of endogenous opioids, which is the brain's own morphine, in a number of brain areas, including this area here, which is the periaqueductal gray, which is really a critical site for opioid-mediated pain control.

01:55:44.252 --> 01:55:50.535
What about, what about, sorry, what about when they just give him, give him the pain?

01:55:50.595 --> 01:55:52.456
Does that also release the opioids?

01:55:52.516 --> 01:55:54.677
Because then again, what are we talking about here?

01:55:56.258 --> 01:55:58.139
They're not showing us the control.

01:55:58.179 --> 01:55:59.300
They're not teaching us.

01:56:04.042 --> 01:56:12.906
What that means is that the placebo effect is tapping into some of the pain, same pain control circuitry as opiate drugs, like morphine.

01:56:15.071 --> 01:56:17.393
What about what happens when you just feel pain?

01:56:17.433 --> 01:56:19.635
Do we tap into our opioids then too?

01:56:19.715 --> 01:56:20.416
I bet we do.

01:56:21.357 --> 01:56:21.897
And then what?

01:56:22.038 --> 01:56:28.984
Is the pain inducing it more in the placebo situation or less, but still enough?

01:56:29.465 --> 01:56:30.866
Do you see what's missing here?

01:56:30.906 --> 01:56:32.728
This is a ridiculous, wow.

01:56:32.748 --> 01:56:34.950
This is the fourth time they're doing it.

01:56:36.186 --> 01:56:41.810
What Thor has shown goes to the heart of the mechanism of how a placebo works.

01:56:43.172 --> 01:56:43.972
A dummy pill.

01:56:44.533 --> 01:56:53.540
And of course now you have to accept that the MRI data is real and that MRI can be used to discern different conditions in the brain and we've accepted that and now it's revealing that

01:56:53.980 --> 01:57:00.365
It's opioids and PGE that are released or not released as a result of the placebo.

01:57:00.405 --> 01:57:02.046
And that's what's happening in your mind.

01:57:02.086 --> 01:57:08.911
And so then now they're really bamboozling you into thinking that we've also figured out some working parts of the human mind as well.

01:57:08.951 --> 01:57:14.154
We could hijack those with some kind of nanoparticle from James Giordano.

01:57:15.615 --> 01:57:20.599
Or cream or surgery can release the naturally occurring painkillers in our brains.

01:57:22.816 --> 01:57:26.279
And it isn't just painkillers that a placebo can activate.

01:57:31.803 --> 01:57:38.348
Our brains are capable of producing countless chemicals that we need to stop pain or to feel it.

01:57:38.788 --> 01:57:42.671
Countless chemicals seems to imply an irreducible complexity.

01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:43.712
I don't know if they meant that.

01:57:44.553 --> 01:57:47.135
To energize us or to help us sleep.

01:57:49.645 --> 01:57:54.569
And a placebo can mimic many of them, from aspirin to alcohol.

01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:59.812
The placebo effect taps into our natural pharmacy.

01:58:01.153 --> 01:58:03.235
Drugs work because we have receptors for the drugs.

01:58:04.155 --> 01:58:05.216
Ah, I'm getting it now.

01:58:05.276 --> 01:58:08.939
They really want you to believe that chemicals, chemicals, chemicals.

01:58:09.059 --> 01:58:11.161
Your consciousness is just chemicals.

01:58:11.721 --> 01:58:15.063
And if we fool your consciousness, you'll release the same chemicals.

01:58:15.644 --> 01:58:18.546
And so far, I haven't really seen evidence of that.

01:58:20.697 --> 01:58:29.422
And I certainly haven't seen evidence that convinces me that it's not much more complex than these bullshit simple stories that they're telling you here.

01:58:33.064 --> 01:58:38.128
And that means that there's some endogenous chemicals that our brains are producing that act on those receptors.

01:58:38.368 --> 01:58:38.628
See?

01:58:38.748 --> 01:58:47.833
Receptors evolve to respond to those natural- Receptors have evolved to respond to- Oh my gosh, wow, why don't you use all the bad words?

01:58:48.374 --> 01:58:49.274
Holy shit.

01:58:49.694 --> 01:58:50.175
Chemicals.

01:58:51.914 --> 01:58:58.976
So a placebo can produce real results by tapping into the chemical systems that our bodies have evolved.

01:59:00.657 --> 01:59:05.238
Just like modern medicines, a placebo effect relies on chemicals.

01:59:06.079 --> 01:59:08.039
The chemicals in our brains.

01:59:08.259 --> 01:59:11.240
Wow, I mean, we are going all the way back to this.

01:59:13.201 --> 01:59:15.282
We are just physics and chemistry.

01:59:16.212 --> 01:59:16.953
Holy crap.

01:59:16.993 --> 01:59:17.693
Isn't it awesome?

01:59:17.813 --> 01:59:19.454
I did not think it was going to be like this.

01:59:19.514 --> 01:59:22.336
I thought it was going to be like placebos and prove it.

01:59:22.376 --> 01:59:35.145
And then I could say like, you know, see why they would, but placebos work in the context that I'm saying that they work in because placebos allow all the adverse events from poisoning to go away.

01:59:35.825 --> 01:59:43.630
That's why it's almost certain that even the, the vaccine schedule in America, as it stands is probably a lot of placebo.

01:59:43.650 --> 01:59:46.152
Otherwise there'd be a lot more damaged children in America.

01:59:47.432 --> 02:00:07.196
I'll go to my grave thinking that especially with regard to these these transfections It was an enormous number of placebo the most the most hot doses went to the healthiest Americans because they would get the most data from them and You know possibly identify the genetic vulnerabilities to transfection I

02:00:21.411 --> 02:00:25.256
Scientists want to know just how much a sugar pill can do.

02:00:27.379 --> 02:00:31.465
Can it only affect conditions which rely on self-reporting, like pain?

02:00:31.485 --> 02:00:34.950
Or could it do much more?

02:00:50.145 --> 02:00:52.986
Paul Patterson lives on the outskirts of Vancouver.

02:00:53.926 --> 02:00:57.887
It gives him easy access to the woods and mountains on the edge of the city.

02:00:57.907 --> 02:01:06.469
But 12 years ago, life took a turn for the worse when he started to develop some unsettling symptoms.

02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:10.950
I started to notice my stride wasn't right.

02:01:12.251 --> 02:01:17.152
My doctor referred me to a podiatrist, something wrong with my ankle, my foot, whatever.

02:01:20.649 --> 02:01:26.312
So the podiatrist had me in a couple weeks later and he goes, oh my gosh, you don't need a podiatrist, you need a neurologist.

02:01:26.332 --> 02:01:36.598
So I went back to my GP and got referred to a neurologist and he wouldn't look at me and he said, okay, you have Parkinson's.

02:01:38.179 --> 02:01:41.461
Well, holy smoke, that was quite traumatic.

02:01:41.521 --> 02:01:43.081
I was in tears for sure.

02:01:46.423 --> 02:01:49.225
It came as a complete shock to Paul and his family.

02:01:50.558 --> 02:01:52.739
and eventually forced him to give up his job.

02:01:56.101 --> 02:02:00.183
Parkinson's is caused by an inability of the brain to release dopamine.

02:02:01.764 --> 02:02:05.926
As well as affecting our mood, dopamine helps to regulate our movement.

02:02:07.427 --> 02:02:12.769
With medication, Paul can get the dopamine he needs to keep his symptoms under control.

02:02:14.250 --> 02:02:15.711
So I take Sinemet CR.

02:02:16.251 --> 02:02:17.732
Control release is the pink one.

02:02:18.675 --> 02:02:23.016
And the two white ones are two and a half milligrams each of bromocryptins.

02:02:23.196 --> 02:02:25.277
And as you see, I'm upright.

02:02:25.297 --> 02:02:25.897
I'm mobile.

02:02:25.997 --> 02:02:26.717
My shoulders are back.

02:02:31.558 --> 02:02:39.900
A few years ago, Parkinson's researcher, Professor John Stosel, decided to test this effective medication against a placebo.

02:02:41.738 --> 02:02:50.525
We've always known that how people do when they have a serious condition has a lot to do with their attitude.

02:02:51.506 --> 02:02:53.027
And that's intriguing to me.

02:02:54.789 --> 02:02:56.850
Paul was recruited onto John's trial.

02:02:57.811 --> 02:03:00.854
It would require him to stop taking his medication.

02:03:01.854 --> 02:03:04.817
Without it, even walking can be difficult.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:11.261
about a year and a half ago, I guess, I was about 50 feet from my house.

02:03:12.302 --> 02:03:13.642
I could literally see the front door.

02:03:13.662 --> 02:03:18.223
I was sitting on the sidewalk, on the curb, and I couldn't get home.

02:03:20.964 --> 02:03:21.764
That was something else.

02:03:21.984 --> 02:03:26.565
It took me about a half hour to get home from 100 feet.

02:03:26.585 --> 02:03:27.786
Yeah.

02:03:35.356 --> 02:03:37.597
Paul headed into hospital for the trial.

02:03:38.117 --> 02:03:43.219
Without having had his medication, his Parkinson's symptoms in full flare up.

02:03:45.079 --> 02:03:47.000
And that's when they gave me this capsule.

02:03:49.721 --> 02:03:54.403
And they give you a half hour, 45 minutes, you know, normal period of time for the meds to kick in.

02:03:57.824 --> 02:04:01.365
And boom, I was thinking, this is pretty good.

02:04:02.025 --> 02:04:03.326
My body becomes erect.

02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:08.342
My shoulders go back and I needed to go to the bathroom.

02:04:08.382 --> 02:04:09.782
So I said, well, I don't need any help.

02:04:09.882 --> 02:04:10.502
I'm fine.

02:04:10.602 --> 02:04:15.303
And he all struck my way down the hall and went to the bathroom.

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:20.224
That Paul hadn't been given any active medication.

02:04:21.084 --> 02:04:22.704
He'd been given a placebo.

02:04:25.845 --> 02:04:33.266
I would ask the question if he hadn't been on medication in the first place with this work, because he could have set up a situation where the

02:04:34.474 --> 02:04:43.062
The balance or the circuit in his brain that needs DOPA, L-DOPA, I think is what they said there he was taking.

02:04:44.927 --> 02:04:58.599
was stimulated into producing DOPA because of the fact that its receptors, you know, these are pretty complex feedback loops that if disrupted, getting them started again, you know, you can think of it kind of like a water wheel.

02:04:58.619 --> 02:05:06.085
I mean, if you've been dumping water on the water wheel enough, and it's turning, then you might not need very much water to come and keep it going.

02:05:06.997 --> 02:05:16.700
And so you can imagine a scenario where the daily dosing of DOPA had created a lot of circuitry in his brain that expected certain things to happen when he took it.

02:05:17.201 --> 02:05:25.303
And so when he took a placebo after that previous experience, his brain had sufficient water flowing so that the water wheel turned anyway.

02:05:26.224 --> 02:05:31.525
Now I know that's a pretty weak example, but I'm trying to point out that this is not a perfect placebo.

02:05:31.966 --> 02:05:32.886
It's not even close.

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:36.067
Oh, I was shocked.

02:05:36.408 --> 02:05:37.888
There's no way I could have done that.

02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:45.873
I fully understand the effects of my medicine, so how could a nothing create those same feelings?

02:05:47.094 --> 02:05:48.775
I was, yeah, I was really shocked.

02:05:53.197 --> 02:06:01.502
Brain scans of patients with Parkinson's that were responding to the placebo helped to explain how Paul's symptoms had faded.

02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:09.877
This slide shows three scans all taken from the same person with Parkinson's disease.

02:06:10.658 --> 02:06:13.421
So now you see the activity at baseline.

02:06:13.581 --> 02:06:17.325
They are pushing MRI scans again, which really, really are.

02:06:20.134 --> 02:06:40.004
They have been really widely discredited as the high fidelity measuring instrument that they were once lauded as during this, the early 2000s, right when the Human Genome Project became really important, they started looking at, you know, it's crazy how much, this is so much snake oil.

02:06:40.224 --> 02:06:42.045
And they come in with no medication.

02:06:42.645 --> 02:06:45.867
Their Parkinson's is not well controlled.

02:06:46.187 --> 02:06:47.908
There's a loss of dopamine in the brain.

02:06:48.268 --> 02:06:49.769
So we see lots of activity here.

02:06:51.476 --> 02:06:56.898
With so little dopamine, someone with Parkinson's would be struggling to- Lots of activity there.

02:06:59.539 --> 02:07:00.719
I'm not sure that's right.

02:07:02.059 --> 02:07:07.981
I see why he says there's lots of activity there, but I'm not sure why there's a lot of activity there with the dopamine.

02:07:08.061 --> 02:07:09.182
We'll have to see if that's right.

02:07:10.262 --> 02:07:15.684
I thought the basal ganglia went away in Parkinson's, which would mean less production.

02:07:15.724 --> 02:07:17.164
It would mean less activity.

02:07:17.505 --> 02:07:18.645
Move and function.

02:07:20.177 --> 02:07:30.927
Now we look at the middle slide, and this is after the person is told that they're going to get active drug, but in fact they receive placebo.

02:07:31.407 --> 02:07:39.034
And you can see a striking reduction in activity here, which indicates that their brains- But where is that?

02:07:39.394 --> 02:07:40.816
What part of the brain is this?

02:07:40.876 --> 02:07:42.397
What resolution are we looking at?

02:07:42.437 --> 02:07:44.539
You see how much chicanery is going on?

02:07:44.599 --> 02:07:46.521
This guy knows exactly what he's doing.

02:07:47.523 --> 02:07:50.305
He's getting grant money because he's featured on the BBC.

02:07:50.345 --> 02:07:51.446
It's going to help him a lot.

02:07:51.607 --> 02:07:53.488
Have released a lot of dopamine.

02:07:55.090 --> 02:08:02.716
The intense red colors in the striatum area of the brain show how little dopamine is present at baseline.

02:08:03.977 --> 02:08:11.304
The decrease in the red coloring shows how the placebo can release dopamine just like the real drugs.

02:08:15.259 --> 02:08:21.247
What we found is that it's very interesting because I don't think that's how those color codes work.

02:08:21.367 --> 02:08:22.930
Red is the, it's weird.

02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.470
Okay, whatever.

02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:30.059
Somebody with Parkinson's disease, a placebo can release as much dopamine as amphetamine or speed can.

02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.381
What an awesome question in the chat right now.

02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:35.602
That is the winning question.

02:08:35.642 --> 02:08:37.143
We're going to end on that question.

02:08:37.643 --> 02:08:41.605
Do they ever tell a patient they got placebo and then see them regress?

02:08:42.205 --> 02:08:47.447
Now that is the best question that could have ever come in the chat.

02:08:47.627 --> 02:08:48.228
Well done.

02:08:49.068 --> 02:08:50.669
Gold star for the weekend.

02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:52.890
Holy man, that's a home run.

02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:55.672
Thank you very much for thinking along, ladies and gentlemen.

02:08:55.752 --> 02:08:58.693
Thank you very, very much for thinking along.

02:08:58.773 --> 02:09:00.114
Wow, that's kick-ass.

02:09:00.214 --> 02:09:02.095
I'm very, very happy with that one.

02:09:02.195 --> 02:09:02.575
Wow.

02:09:03.176 --> 02:09:03.736
Nice work.

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:06.618
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

02:09:06.658 --> 02:09:10.560
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

02:09:12.041 --> 02:09:23.370
Please make sure you understand that they took a non-specific background, and they made non-specific tests that could find it, and they told us it was evidence of spread, and the way they got away with it is with placebo.

02:09:24.251 --> 02:09:26.592
Don't accept PCR as a diagnostic.

02:09:26.693 --> 02:09:32.778
It's nonsense, and finding their ghost using their test does not make the ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster.

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:34.399
Thank you very much for being here.

02:09:34.819 --> 02:09:36.760
Thank you very much for making it all the way to Friday.

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.000
Five days in a row again.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.340
Boy, am I tired.

02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:43.021
I might be taking the weekend off unless... Nah, I'm gonna probably take the weekend off.

02:09:43.061 --> 02:09:43.441
We'll see.

02:09:44.282 --> 02:09:47.603
Intramuscular injection is not a valid way of administering medicine.

02:09:48.043 --> 02:09:51.324
Transpecting healthy people was always a crime and Robert Malone knew it.

02:09:51.904 --> 02:09:57.105
And the population pyramid is a problem they've been actively managing with murder and lies.

02:09:57.225 --> 02:09:58.386
Thank you very much for being here.

02:09:58.446 --> 02:09:59.446
I'll see you guys again soon.

02:10:21.944 --> 02:10:28.010
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it,
